25|$|According to the Hurt Report, most {{motorcycle}} {{riders in}} the United States would over-brake and skid {{the rear wheel}} and under-brake the front when <b>trying</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> avoid a collision. The ability to countersteer and swerve was essentially absent with many motorcycle operators. The often small amount of initial countersteering input required to get the bike to lean, which may {{be as little as}} 0.125 seconds, keeps many riders unaware of the concept.|$|E

25|$|Jousting is a martial game or hastilude {{between two}} {{horsemen}} wielding lances with blunted tips, often {{as part of}} a tournament. The primary aim was to replicate a clash of heavy cavalry, with each opponent <b>trying</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> strike the opponent while riding towards him at high speed, if possible breaking the lance on the opponent's shield or jousting armour, or unhorsing him. The joust became an iconic characteristic of the knight in Romantic medievalism. The participants experience close to three and a quarter times their body weight in G-forces when the lances collide with their armor.|$|E

[...] With the peloton not <b>trying</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> chase them, they built a ten-minute lead {{by the middle of}} the stage. In the second half of the stage, there was some sunshine, but also strong crosswinds: with Sky, Tinkoff and Etixx–Quick-Step working hard at the front of the peloton, there were splits in the group. Alexander Kristoff was in the second group on the road, but he was able to get back to the front as the groups came together.|$|E

Friday {{reported}} back for pre-season training in bad condition, and although Hurley claimed that Friday was <b>trying</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> regain fitness, the forward was having trouble with his asthma, had lost some of his pace and was obviously unfit. Although his performances during August quickly improved, they were still not up to his previous standard and the Evening Post revealed on the 30th that Reading were preparing to sell him [...] "to a First Division club". After scoring in two successive Reading home wins on 4 and 7 September, against Walsall and Wrexham respectively, Friday {{took part in a}} third consecutive victory on the 13th, away against Northampton Town. After this he missed two matches, according to the Post because he was suffering from flu, and {{when he returned to the}} team was far from his best; [...] "Suddenly he had lost a yard and his control of the ball was not as good", Hurley recalled.|$|E

500|$|... "No Surprises", {{recorded}} {{in a single}} take, is arranged with electric guitar (inspired by the Beach Boys' [...] "Wouldn't It Be Nice"), acoustic guitar, glockenspiel and vocal harmonies. The band strove to replicate the mood of Louis Armstrong's 1968 recording of [...] "What a Wonderful World" [...] and the soul music of Marvin Gaye. Hoping to achieve a slower tempo than could be played well on their instruments, Godrich had the band record the song at a faster tempo, then slowed the playback for Yorke to overdub his vocals onto, creating an [...] "ethereal" [...] effect. Yorke identified {{the subject of the}} song as [...] "someone who's <b>trying</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> keep it together but can't". The lyrics seem to portray a suicide or an unfulfilling life, and dissatisfaction with contemporary social and political order. Some lines refer to rural or suburban imagery. One of the key metaphors in the song is the opening line, [...] "a heart that's full up like a landfill"; according to Yorke, the song is a [...] "fucked-up nursery rhyme" [...] that [...] "stems from my unhealthy obsession {{of what to do with}} plastic boxes and plastic bottles... All this stuff is getting buried, the debris of our lives. It doesn't rot, it just stays there. That's how we deal, that's how I deal with stuff, I bury it." [...] The song's gentle mood contrasts sharply with its harsh lyrics; Steele said, [...] "even when the subject is suicide... O'Brien's guitar is as soothing as balm on a red-raw psyche, the song rendered like a bittersweet child's prayer." ...|$|E

With tensions tightening in the South, some Northern states, such as Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh organised anti-English riots involving violence and lawlessness against government properties. Thus as the North-South divide further deepened, {{the stage was set}} for conflict between the Congress-led government and the opposition parties, but the scale and development of the conflict were expected by none.|$|E

(Roger was an accomplished 2-D artist whose drawings and painting of horses and other wildlife showed a detailed understanding of musculature and anatomy.) But he also argued that Patterson had [...] "nowhere near the knowledge or facilities to do so—nor for that matter, did anyone else ... When I talked {{about some of the}} more technical details of biomechanics, he (Patterson) showed the familiar blank look of a student who had lost the drift of the explanation, but was still <b>trying</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> pay attention.

2500|$|Boltzmann's {{kinetic theory}} of gases seemed to presuppose {{the reality of}} atoms and molecules, but almost all German {{philosophers}} and many scientists like Ernst Mach and the physical chemist Wilhelm Ostwald disbelieved their existence. During the 1890s Boltzmann attempted to formulate a compromise position which would allow both atomists and anti-atomists to do physics without arguing over atoms. His solution was to use Hertz's theory that atoms were Bilder, that is, models or pictures. Atomists could think the pictures were the real atoms while the anti-atomists could think of the pictures as representing a useful but unreal model, but this did not fully satisfy either group. Furthermore, Ostwald and many defenders of [...] "pure thermodynamics" [...] were <b>trying</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> refute the kinetic theory of gases and statistical mechanics because of Boltzmann's assumptions about atoms and molecules and especially statistical interpretation of the second law of thermodynamics.|$|E
2500|$|After he {{returned}} to Washington, Dulles advised Eisenhower that the Arab states believed [...] "the United States will back the new state of Israel in aggressive expansion. Our basic political problem ... {{is to improve the}} Moslem states' attitudes towards Western democracies because our prestige in that area had been in constant decline ever since the war". The immediate consequence was a new policy of [...] "even-handedness" [...] where the United States very publicly sided with the Arab states in several disputes with Israel in 1953–54. Moreover, Dulles did not share any sentimental regard for the Anglo-American [...] "special relationship", which led the Americans to lean towards the Egyptian side in the Anglo-Egyptian disputes. During the extremely difficult negotiations over the British evacuation of the Suez Canal base in 1954–55, the Americans generally supported Egypt, though at the same time <b>trying</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> limit the extent of the damage that this might cause to Anglo-American relations.|$|E

Janet goes for her delicate wisp, but {{it sounds as if}} she's <b>trying</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> maintain the crispness, straining to keep from cracking. Nelly delivers a slippery grind, making this also the obligatory 'time to get your sex on' number." [...] Don Baiocchi of Blogcritics was mixed, writing that [...] "to kick off a comeback with the mediocre 'Call On Me,' a duet where she actually makes Nelly sing, is just plain wrong. 'Call on Me' wasn't the way to do that." [...] He also noted that [...] "details like the tiny hand claps in 'Call On Me' are bizarre missteps." [...] Evan Serpick of Rolling Stone wrote that [...] "it shamelessly re-creates 'Dilemma,' the St. Louis rapper's collaboration with Kelly Rowland."

2500|$|Gillespie was criticised for {{defacing}} a Make Poverty History poster {{signed by}} all the acts at the Glastonbury Festival in 2005. Gillespie scribbled over this and wrote [...] "Make Israel History."

We did a lot of work for the Hoping Foundation to raise money for children in the Palestinian refugee camps and the lady who got us involved is Bella Freud, Lucian Freud's daughter and Sigmund Freud's great granddaughter. They had to flee Austria to escape Nazi persecution, and she believes in the Palestinian cause. To say we're anti-Semitic is a smear, so you'd better watch what you're saying. Because you oppose one country's government's policies doesn't mean to say that you hate all the people from that country. I don't like Bush or Putin or Tony Blair, but I don't hate American, Russian or British people. Most people are just <b>trying</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> get by." [...] In 2012 he stated that he believed the British coalition government were reactionary quasi-fascists. The statement was prompted by the use of Primal Scream's song [...] "Rocks" [...] at the Conservative Party Conference.|$|E

[...] He had so little money that he lived like [...] "a subway rat, pale and frail, <b>trying</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> believe in" [...] the novel he was writing.

It's this preposterous tale about these preposterous people, and you don't know what's going to happen next, and you're tired of eating chicken livers and fettuccine, and you're alone in this little square concrete apartment, there's no air or earth, and pretty soon it was hard for me to distinguish what was going on in my head and what was going on on the outside."
