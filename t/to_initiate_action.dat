25|$|In 2015 two Chabad schools, Yeshiva in Melbourne and Yeshiva in Bondi, {{came under}} the {{scrutiny}} of Australia's Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse. As a result of testimony by victims such as Manny Waks, founder of Tzedek {{as well as by}} school officials and religious leaders, several rabbis in the Jewish community have resigned or been delisted. Philip Dalidakis, son of a Jewish immigrant and currently Southern Metropolitan Member of the Victorian Legislative Council, called on the Prime Minister and Premier <b>to</b> <b>initiate</b> <b>action</b> making the Chabad Yeshiva more accountable. He proposed that financial support from the government be withheld until all leaders who helped cover up abuse resign. He further called for the production of all reports, letters and emails related to the concealment of abuse, the creation and enforcement of clear, specific rules for Yeshiva leaders {{and the creation of a}} fund to compensate victims.|$|E

2500|$|Law {{professor}} Gary Francione, an abolitionist, {{argues that}} all sentient beings {{should have the}} right not to be treated as property, and that adopting veganism must be the baseline for anyone who believes that non-humans have intrinsic moral value. Pursuing improved welfare conditions is like campaigning for [...] "conscientious rapists" [...] who will rape without beating, he argues. Philosopher Tom Regan, also a rights theorist, argues that animals possess value as [...] "subjects-of-a-life", because they have beliefs, desires, memory and the ability <b>to</b> <b>initiate</b> <b>action</b> in pursuit of goals. The right of subjects-of-a-life not to be harmed can be overridden by other moral principles, but Regan argues that pleasure, convenience and the economic interests of farmers are not weighty enough.|$|E

However, in a 2010 interview, Castro expressed regret about his earlier stance on first use: [...] "After I've seen what I've seen, and knowing what I know now, it wasn't worth it at all." [...] Castro also ordered all anti-aircraft weapons in Cuba to fire on any US aircraft: the orders had been to fire only on groups of two or more. At 6:00am EDT on October 27, the CIA delivered a memo reporting that three of the four missile sites at San Cristobal and the two sites at Sagua la Grande appeared to be fully operational. It also noted that the Cuban military continued to organize for action but was under order not <b>to</b> <b>initiate</b> <b>action</b> unless attacked.|$|E
