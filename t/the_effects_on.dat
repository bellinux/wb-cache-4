5|$|After {{hostilities}} ended, {{a survey}} {{team from the}} Manhattan Project that included William Penney, Robert Serber, and George T. Reynolds was sent to Hiroshima to evaluate {{the effects of the}} blast. From evaluating <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> objects and structures, Penney concluded that the yield was 12 ± 1 kilotons. Later calculations based on charring pointed to a yield of 13 to 14 kilotons. In 1953, Frederick Reines calculated the yield as 13 kilotons. This figure became the official yield.|$|E
5|$|An {{immediate}} concern of environmentalists was the potential {{use of chemical}} dispersants. To keep big slicks from washing ashore, dispersants {{can be used to}} break the oil into small droplets that disperse throughout the water column. There are significant concerns about the health effects of the dispersants and <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> aquatic life. Coast Guard officials overseeing the cleanup indicated that no chemical dispersants were being used but did not immediately rule the use of them out.|$|E

Pregnant sheep are also a useful model for human pregnancy, and have been used to investigate <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> fetal development of malnutrition and hypoxia. In behavioral sciences, sheep have been used in isolated cases for the study of facial recognition, as their mental process of recognition is qualitatively similar to humans.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, Emil du Bois-Reymond and Hermann von Helmholtz, {{following}} {{the work of}} their teacher Johannes Peter Müller showed the electrical inpulses which pass along nerves; but unlike Müller's views, that such impulses were able to be observed. Richard Caton in 1875 demonstrated electrical in the cerebral hemispheres of rabbits and monkeys.

5|$|A {{laboratory}} study examined <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> the Antarctic scallop of {{an increase in}} lead, copper and mercury content in the water. It was found that a rise in levels of heavy metals led to quite severe morphological changes in the scallop and a reduction in lysosomal membrane stability. Another experiment involved transplanting scallops from a clean water area to a bay where effluent from an Antarctic base was released. It was found that the scallops were relatively unaffected by the outflows and this resulted in the belief that benthic marine communities were unlikely to be severely affected by such discharges.|$|E

5|$|Olivia {{suggests}} {{the possibility that}} the effect is due to quantum entanglement between Alice in the prime universe and Derek in the parallel one. Alice previously told Olivia that Derek died recently from trying to replace a faulty fuse after they flipped a coin to decide who would replace it, and Walter surmises that the parallel universe Alice died in a similar fashion due to a different outcome of the coin flip. Alice's connection to the parallel universe Derek is causing the crack. As the building starts to exhibit the initial signs of a singularity and Broyles (Lance Reddick) prepares to release the amber, Olivia and Peter attempt to persuade Alice that the man she sees is not really her husband. Alice does not believe them until Derek starts to refer to their children.

5|$|Optic nerve sheath {{fenestration}} is {{an operation}} that involves the making of an incision in the connective tissue lining of the optic nerve in its portion behind the eye. It is not entirely clear how it protects the eye from the raised pressure, {{but it may be}} the result of either diversion of the CSF into the orbit or the creation of an area of scar tissue that lowers the pressure. <b>The</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> the intracranial pressure itself are more modest. Moreover, the procedure may lead to significant complications, including blindness in 1–2%. The procedure is therefore recommended mainly in those who have limited headache symptoms but significant papilledema or threatened vision, or in those who have undergone unsuccessful treatment with a shunt or have a contraindication for shunt surgery.|$|E
5|$|Some {{knowledge}} of physiology and {{the physics of}} diving is considered necessary by most diver certification agencies, as the diving environment is alien and relatively hostile to humans. The physics and physiology knowledge required is fairly basic, and helps the diver to understand {{the effects of the}} diving environment so that informed acceptance of the associated risks is possible. The physics mostly relates to gases under pressure, buoyancy, heat loss, and light underwater. The physiology relates the physics to <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> the human body, to provide a basic understanding of the causes and risks of barotrauma, DCS, gas toxicity, hypothermia, drowning and sensory variations. More advanced training often involves first aid and rescue skills, skills related to specialised diving equipment, and underwater work skills. Further training is required to develop the skills necessary for diving in a wider range of environments, with specialised equipment, and to become competent to perform a variety of underwater tasks.|$|E
