25|$|Before Hus left Prague, {{he decided}} <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> which gave a new {{dimension}} to his endeavors. He no longer put his trust in an indecisive King, a hostile Pope or an ineffective Council. On 18 October 1412 he appealed to Jesus Christ as the supreme judge. By appealing directly to the highest Christian authority, Christ himself, he bypassed the laws and structures of the medieval Church. For the Bohemian Reformation, this step was as significant as the 95 theses nailed {{to the door of the}} Wittenberg church by Martin Luther in 1517.|$|E

25|$|Poincaré {{states that}} {{mathematics}} (analysis) and physics {{are in the}} same spirit, that the two disciplines share a common aesthetic goal and that both can liberate humanity from its simple state. In a more pragmatic way, the interdependence of physics and mathematics is similar to his proposed relationship between intuition and analysis. The language of mathematics not only permits one to express scientific advancements, but also <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> back to comprehend the broader world of nature. Mathematics demonstrates the extent of the specific and limited discoveries made by physicists. On the other hand, physics has a key role for the mathematician - a creative role since it presents atypical problems ingrained in reality. In addition, physics offers solutions and reasoning - thus the development of infinitesimal calculus by Isaac Newton within the framework of Newtonian mechanics.|$|E
25|$|For instance, in the ABA {{transfer}} system {{a group of}} say eight racers {{sign up for the}} 17-18 Intermediate class. That is more than enough to have three motos (four is the minimum). Moto #1 will have all eight racers. The first two finishers qualify for and do not race again until the Main. Moto #2 will be a second heat for the remaining six racers; again, the first two across the finish line from that group will go the Main. Finally, a third moto of the remaining four riders is run, from which the first two racers across the finish line will be taken to the Main, forming a six-man Main. The last two racers do not qualify (DNQ) and therefore do not race in the Main, do not collect any points, trophies, a chance <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> in advancement to a higher amateur level or if they are professionals, prize money.|$|E
25|$|After {{experiencing}} {{a decade of}} warfare with an increasingly higher profile, the FARC needed another conference to establish a more sophisticated military plan for its future operations. The conference was held in late 1970s {{under the leadership of}} Manuel Marulanda and Jacobo Arenas, which by then were the FARC's key leaders. According to some historical reports about the FARC in the 1970s, they then decided to form a military academy similar to the ones in existing socialist countries, like those in the Soviet Union, Cuba, and also like those employed by its enemies, like the United States and the United Kingdom. The FARC identified several difficulties that made the situation increasingly complex due to the growing threat of the enemy, and decided <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> forward in a different form, through maintaining a policy of advanced military training. FARC had built a training structure in a totally different way, not directly comparable with those of orthodox military organizations, as each level of training had to end with a period of combat experience in real life warfare, before progressing to the next level.|$|E

There was no room for a third party between the Mountain, which was identified with the Republic, and royalism, which was the ally of the enemy.

Shinoda also said that, in comparison to Minutes to Midnight, the new album would have a bigger [...] "thread of consistency" [...] and would be more experimental and [...] "hopefully more cutting-edge".|$|E

For this reason, he enjoyed [...] "China", and opined that [...] "The China plot, which thankfully focused less on Michael's craziness than his (and his coworkers') relationship with Oscar, demonstrated how well-drawn the show has been even {{when it comes to}} its more peripheral characters." [...] He also said the episode was [...] "vintage Office." ...|$|E

500|$|Q {{performs}} her own stunts in the series. The actress {{liked to}} have her character [...] "be able to do her own thing," [...] as it is an action series where females play lead roles; during her film career, she noted [...] "but in movies, alongside big action men, we've always got <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> back and let the men shine. And in this, it's about the women who know what they're doing." [...] At some point Q set up a three-week long training period {{for the rest of}} the cast to make their fight scenes in the series believable; she had her partner, an action director, bring his stunt team to train them. In filming the stunts she was already used to working in an environment where filming in television would be faster than in American films, because of her time starring in films in Asia, which usually took two to six weeks.|$|E
500|$|In January 2003, Taking Back Sunday toured {{with the}} Used and the Blood Brothers. They headlined the Takeover Tour in March and April, {{with support from}} From Autumn to Ashes and Recover. The group was due to tour the UK with Brand New in May and June, however, all of the shows were {{cancelled}} amongst rumours of the band breaking up. In early May, the group issued a statement, explaining that [...] "There have {{been a series of}} personal events with members of the band ... We need very much <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> back at this time". Around this time, Nolan (citing exhaustion from touring) left the band, and Cooper followed shortly afterwards. According to Lazzara, Nolan and Cooper were [...] "having trouble because everything was happening so fast. Going from being home ... to being gone all the time and having your whole life consumed and almost defined by the band that you’re in is a lot to handle". The band briefly considered breaking up. Nolan and Cooper formed Straylight Run with Nolan's sister, Michelle, and Breaking Pangaea drummer Will Noon.|$|E
500|$|In 2015, Nolan's {{production}} company Syncopy formed {{a joint venture}} with Zeitgeist Films, to release Blu-ray editions of Zeitgeist's prestige titles. Their first project was Elena (2011) from director Andrey Zvyagintsev. As part of a Blu-ray release of the Quay brothers animated work, Nolan directed the documentary short Quay (2015). He also initiated a theatrical tour, showcasing the Quays' In Absentia, The Comb and Street of Crocodiles. The program and Nolan's short received critical acclaim, with Indiewire writing in their review that the brothers [...] "will undoubtedly have hundreds, if not thousands more fans because of Nolan, and for that The Quay Brothers in 35mm will always be one of latter's most important contributions to cinema". In 2015, Nolan joined The Film Foundation's board of directors, a non-profit organization dedicated to film preservation. Having been instrumental in keeping the production of film stock alive in the 21st century, Nolan invited over 30 representatives from leading American film archives, labs and presenting institutions to participate in an informal summit entitled Reframing the Future of Film at the Getty Museum in March 2015. On 7 May, it was announced that Nolan and Martin Scorsese had been appointed by the Library of Congress to serve on the National Film Preservation Board (NFPB) as DGA representatives. In 2016, Nolan and Thomas opted <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> back and only serve as executive producers on Zack Snyder's [...] (2016), the sequel to Man of Steel. Later that year, Nolan was featured in the documentary Cinema Futures (2016) by Austrian filmmaker Michael Palm.|$|E

500|$|Trying {{to resolve}} Larkin's {{contradictory}} opinions on race {{in his book}} Such Deliberate Disguises: The Art of Philip Larkin, the writer Richard Palmer quotes a letter Larkin wrote to Betjeman, as if it exposes [...] "all the post-Motion and post-Letters furore about Larkin’s 'racism' as the nonsense it is":"The American Negro is trying <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> forward that can be compared only to the ending of slavery in the nineteenth century. And despite the dogs, the hosepipes and the burnings, advances have already been made towards giving the Negro his civil rights {{that would have been}} inconceivable when Louis Armstrong was a young man. These advances will doubtless continue. They will end only when the Negro is as well-housed, educated and medically cared for as the white man."Reviewing Palmer's book, John G. Rodwan, Jr. proposes that: [...] "a less forgiving reader could counter by asking if this does not qualify as the thought of a “true racist”: 'I find the state of the nation quite terrifying. In 10 years’ time we shall all be cowering under our beds as hordes of blacks steal anything they can lay their hands on.' Or this: 'We don’t go to cricket Test matches now, too many fucking niggers about.'"Despite controversy about his personal life and opinions, Larkin remains one of Britain's most popular poets. In 2003, almost two decades after his death, Larkin was chosen as [...] "the nation's best-loved poet" [...] in a survey by the Poetry Book Society, and in 2008 The Times named Larkin as the greatest British post-war writer. Three of his poems, [...] "This Be The Verse", [...] "The Whitsun Weddings" [...] and [...] "An Arundel Tomb", featured in the Nation's Top 100 Poems as voted for by viewers of the BBC's Bookworm in 1995. Media interest in Larkin has increased in the twenty-first century. Larkin's collection The Whitsun Weddings is one of the available poetry texts in the AQA English Literature A Level syllabus, while High Windows is offered by the OCR board. Buses in Hull displayed extracts from his poems in 2010.|$|E
2500|$|The basic step of lindy hop, a swingout, is {{the basis}} {{of a large number of}} the {{traditional}} lindy hop moves and is done to eight counts of music. While the basic step is generally universally similar, the resurgence on lindy hop in the 1990s lead to two distinctly different styles of the basic step: the [...] "Brooklyn" [...] style and the [...] "smooth" [...] style. In the Brooklyn style of the basic step, the lead leads a follow <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> back on the first count of the step (similar to the footwork of the basic step in east coast) whereas, in the smooth style, a lead leads the follow <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> forward on that same first count. From scene to scene, dancers are often familiar with completely different styles, steps, moves, and patterns of lindy hop. When a number of local scenes come together in events such as a lindy exchange, dancers can often be seen exchanging dance moves with one another.|$|E

There is a conflict in her novels where there is support for individuality, political freedom, and equality for women, while the novel is vague in its judgement of democracy for mass politics.|$|E
