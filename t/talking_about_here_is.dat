5000|$|This is what Ukrainian {{music critic}} and {{journalist}} Oleksandr Yevtushenko wrote {{in one of}} his compilations on contemporary Ukrainian music:"I first heard the group OPALNYI PRYNZ on the broadcasts of the Ukrainian service of Radio Liberty. The songs Hey Ukraino!, Nash Prapor were played every day. That {{was at the end of}} the 1980s. But to find out anything about the group was only possible after the release of their first album Mandry. And after that as music of the [...] "secretive inhabitants of Lviv" [...] Ukrainian Radio started to play them and the became radio-hits. Rostyslav Shtyn and company came out into the information field. But they did not try to conquer it, because first and foremost they were concerned with the creation of a European level of musical infrastructure with their own agency, recording studio. What we are <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> a well equipped national factory of stars. The idea didnt leave Rostyslav alone. Thank God, that he gathered his organizational skills and musical talent. First of all there was his musical education - Rostyslavs education is as a violinist. There was the persistent work with stars of multifarious stages. At the end of the 1980s the main matter became his group OPALNYI PRYNZ. It was created by: Yuri Shtyn (his younger brother), who plays keyboards, sings, and writes the music and lyrics, Toomas Vanem - lead guitar and still one other keyboardist Roman Brytsky and singer and guitarist Rostyslav Shtyn. The path of OPALNYI PRYNZ cardinally is different from generally accepted schemes. Because for they had the idea of technical and financial independence and perfect quality of how they sounded. The group signed a contract with one German producers centre and received the possibility of publishing its materials on both sides of the Iron Curtain. At the end of 1990 OPALNYI PRYNZ realizes its next project - the album Nova Revolyutsiya. Indisputably, all the tracks of the album are woven with the tectonic changes in the life of Ukrainian society. Its impregnated with movement towards freedom, the feeling of change. Concurrently it is beautifully recorded. And the video clip to the song Nash Prapor was shown on Ukrainian television all the way through to the year 2000. Some people confirm, that this clip was shown on MTV in honor of Ukraines declaration of independence in 1991. Nova Revolyutsiya - these are very strong and unique compositions Khlib po vodi (Bread upon the water), Rozmyti dorohy (Washed out roads), Ty na viyni (You are at war), Simnadtsyate veresnya (1939 The Seventeenth of September), Braty po zbroyii (Brothers in Arms). These are songs that one does not forget. Regardless of their primarily studio plane of existence, OPALNYI PRYNZ had a considerable influence on the formation of Ukrainian rock-music, certain models in their sound in particular, we are talking about the synthesis of ethnic music with rock. It is possible that they were the first that did it delicately and convincingly. Its incredible, but OPALNYI PRYNZ even today sounds fresh and real." ...|$|E

40|$|This is an {{excellent}} review of gene/environment interactions on behavior and, in spite of being a bit dated, is an easy and worthwhile read. They start with twin studies which show the overwhelming impact of genetics on behavior. They note the increasingly well known studies of Judith Harris which extend and summarize the facts that shared home environment has almost no effect on behavior and that adopted children {{grow up to be}} as different from their stepbrothers and sisters as people chosen at random. One basic point that they (and nearly all who discuss behavioral genetics) fail to note is that the hundreds (thousands depending on your viewpoint) of human behavioral universals, including all the basics of our personalities, are 100 % determined by our genes, with no variation in normals. Everyone sees a tree as a tree and not a stone, seeks and eats food, gets angry and jealous etc. So, what they are mostly <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> how much environment (culture) can affect the degree to which various traits are shown, rather than their appearance. Finally, they discuss eugenics in the usual politically correct fashion, failing to note that we and all organisms are the products of nature’s eugenics and that attempts to defeat natural selection with medicine, agriculture, and civilization as a whole, are disastrous for any society that persists. As much as 50 % of all conceptions, or some 100 million/year, end in early spontaneous abortion, nearly all without the mother being aware. This natural culling of defective genes drives evolution, keeps us relatively genetically sound and makes society possible. However, {{it is now clear that}} overpopulation will destroy the world before dysgenics has a chance.

40|$|Abstract. Since {{a number}} of {{quantitative}} studies of pair programming (the practice of two programmers working together using just one computer) have produced somewhat conflicting results, {{a number of}} researchers have started to study pair programming qualitatively. While most such studies use coding schemes that are fully or partially predefined, we have decided to go the long way and use Grounded Theory (GT) to ground each and every statement we make directly in observations. The first intermediate goal, which we <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>here,</b> <b>was</b> to produce a coding scheme that would allow the objective conceptual description of specific pair programming sessions independent of a particular research goal. The present article explains how our initial attempts at using the method of Grounded Theory failed and which practices we developed to avoid these difficulties: predetermined perspective on the data, concept naming rules, analysis results metamodel, and pair coding. We expect these practices be helpful in all GT situations, in particular those involving very rich data such as video data. We illustrate the operation and usefulness of these practices by real examples derived from our coding work and also present a few preliminary hypotheses regarding pair programming that we have stumbled across. ...|$|R

40|$|This article follows on from Primerr. 1 There, I <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> {{errors and}} {{complexities}} {{as a function}} of the weighted errors or mappings of prime intervals. <b>Here,</b> I <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> the error as the root mean squared (RMS) de-viation of a set of intervals from just intonation. For a regular temperament this RMS error is still independent of the number of notes in the tempered scale. A model of composite intervals is a bit less arbitrary than one that only looks at prime intervals. In that sense the errors and complexities I <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>here</b> <b>are</b> more meaningful than those in Primerr. Where the two are in agreement, you can view this article as validating Primerr. However, choosing a set of intervals that doesn’t repeat every octave, and the weight to assign to each interval, still requires a lot of arbitrary choices. From that view-point, everything <b>here</b> <b>is</b> still wrong, but not as wrong as in Primerr. I show the general formula for the weighted RMS error of a set of composite intervals in the optimal tuning of a given temperament class, where the tuning itself remains implicit. The formula is not much more complicated than that for the TOP-RMS error. The same formula also leads to a measure of the com-plexity of a regular temperament. I don’t derive it from first principles but it’s probably something to do with the RMS complexity of the given intervals. I discuss the special case of equally weighted errors within a given Tenney (product) limit and show that in all cases the formula is identical to that for the RMS error of prime intervals with arbitrary weights. To cover more general cases, I propose a simple model for systems that don’t only depend on the prime weights. In the light of this I look at Farey limits, where all intervals are taken from the lowest partials in a harmonic overtone series. 1 "Prime Based Error and Complexity Measures", Available a...|$|R

The interview comes from a resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Khumalo	The baobab tree, it is already prepared as food. Because if you leave it to dry, inside the pulp becomes a powder. That powder you can keep for use in future or at the time you are just receiving it. If you have done that, that powder you can now mix it with water and make a sour drink. You can also use this sour drink to make porridge. The porridge is very good. The germs are destroyed because germs do not want to multiply in an acid condition. So when it is sour the germs cannot easily multiply. We like to use sour foods to prepare the porridge for infants so that when we are working in our fields the children can eat that porridge which will not have had germs or bacteria multiplying easily because of the sour situation. So that is why we like to use the baobab tree. Bafana	What then are actually the nutritional benefits of this particular fruit? Khumalo	I can say one, it is rich in vitamin C. Vitamin C is good for the bones to grow. So the vitamin C which is there works with other nutrients to strengthen the bones of our young people and ourselves especially the aged and the children. Bafana	Is the baobab fruit readily available throughout the year or is it a seasonal fruit? Khumalo	Although baobab fruit is seasonal {{as long as it is}} not opened it can be kept throughout the year so that you can have the use of the baobab fruit throughout the year. Bafana	I know the baobab fruit has a hard core, how could you tell when it is ripe? Khumalo	It becomes dry. Once it is ripe it becomes dry and you can pick it and go and keep it within the home so that it can be used at any time so that it can strengthen our bodies working with these other nutrients to strengthen our systems. Bafana	You mentioned in fact two recipes that you could prepare food from. You mentioned the porridge and you also mentioned the drink. Are recipes for the preparation of this fruit written down or most of the time you can rely on memory? Khumalo	Generally as you know we Africans do not usually write about our things, we <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> them. We demonstrate by cooking and so the family is going to learn. I have tried to write some of these recipes down. Bafana	Where you have farmers near a remote location who may not have access to maybe a project like yours where you are writing down the recipe, can the recipe be retained by memory and if so what are the really the hooks to remembering it? Khumalo	The recipes I have <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>here</b> <b>are</b> very simple. One, you pound the white stuff of the pulp inside, not the seed but the pulp. When that pulp you have made it into a powder you can mix it with water, it is very easy and you drink or you can make your porridge. When the porridge is ready you can pour your white powder there and mix it. It is your choice of how you want to make the porridge sour. If you want to prevent the germs you have to cook it together with the porridge so that it is already mixed. Do not mix it when you are eating because if you are mixing when you are eating the bacteria will have already multiplied. But if you mix it when it was hot the sourness of my porridge, the acidity of my porridge will prevent the multiplication of germs. You should not cook and leave the porridge sour and put to stand for a long time. Always put it when it is hot so that there is no multiplication of bacteria. So you know it is safe. Bafana	Given the nutritional benefits of wild fruit such as the baobab that you have <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> can wild fruit then be promoted as an alternative to the usual fruits? Khumalo	Oh yes, you know especially in these days when the situation of HIV/AIDS needs what we usually call antioxidant, you need vitamin C, vitamin A and other vitamins which will work as antioxidants.
