500|$|More {{than one}} scene proved {{problematic}} for Breezy {{during the filming}} of the episode, as the decontamination room set was an enclosed four wall set, meaning that in the scene where Archer rubs down Porthos with decontamination gel, Breezy's trainer Scott Rowe couldn't be on the set with her. Normally {{he would have been}} behind the camera assisting the director by ensuring the dog is looking wherever the scene required. He hoped that with him off the set, that Breezy would look where required and not directly at the camera. In order to prepare for the scene where Porthos leaps out of an immersion tank and into Archer's arms, Rowe had a mock-up created so he could practice it with Breezy. He said that [...] "By the <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> into it on that one day to prep on set with Scott, she was jumping out of it into my arms, but I had to make sure that she's going to jump out and do it into Scott's arms." [...] In the final scene, not only did Breezy leap into Bakula's arms, but she also licked him repeatedly on the face. This wasn't due to training, but because they wiped food on Bakula's face.|$|E
2500|$|This {{was a time}} of {{transition}} between the beat movement and the hippie era, when the Village flourished as a creative mecca. [...] "The Village was a really neat place to be at that <b>time.</b> <b>We</b> <b>went</b> to the theater that was to become the Fillmore East; it wasn't called that yet, but they were starting to have some rock concerts, like Chuck Berry. ... I began to let my hair grow and become a real New York hippie", he recalled.|$|E

Sharpton called the comments [...] "abominable", [...] "racist", and [...] "sexist", and repeated his earlier demand that Imus be fired. Imus said, [...] "Our agenda is to be funny and sometimes we go too far. And this <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> way too far. Here's what I've learned: that you can't make fun of everybody, because some people don't deserve it." ...|$|E

2500|$|On his {{recovery}} from illness Gartside returned to London {{and went straight}} into the studio with the group to begin recording the album {{at the end of}} 1980. It was recorded at Berry Street Studio in London, with the exception of [...] "Faithless" [...] which was recorded at Island Studios (now renamed Sarm Studios). The band were able to take their time with the recording and to employ guest musicians including Mike McEvoy and Joe Cang because their label Rough Trade paid each member a salary of £50 per week, as well as giving them a generous advance to record the album. Gartside explained that the album had taken several months to make because [...] "a lot of the ideas for this album, particularly lyrically, weren't finalised by the <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> into the studio, so we decided to do a couple of days at a time. Also, we were working with Adam Kidron, who was at the time committed to Delta Five [...] and Pere Ubu and Orange Juice, so it took that much longer to complete. Plus the fact that there's quite a few other musicians playing on it, many of whom could only work two hour schedules." ...|$|E
2500|$|Flying Hawk {{was born}} about full moon of March 1854, {{a few miles}} south of Rapid Creek, Lakota Territory. His father was Oglala Lakota Chief Black Fox, also known as Chief Black Fox I, Cut Forehead and Great Kicking Bear. Chief Black Fox (c. 1800-c. 1880) had two wives who were sisters who bore him {{thirteen}} children. Iron Cedar Woman, the youngest sister, was Flying Hawk's mother and had five children. The other wife had eight children. [...] "In a fight with the Crows, Chief Black Fox was shot below the right eye with an arrow. [...] It was so deep {{that it could not}} be pulled out, but had to be pushed through the ear." [...] Chief Black Fox died when he was eighty years old. [...] "When my father was dead a long <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> to see how he was on the scaffold where we put him. [...] His bones were all that was left. [...] The arrow-point was sticking {{in the back of his}} skull. [...] It was rusted. [...] We took it home with us." [...] Kicking Bear (c. 1846-c. 1880) was Flying Hawk's full and older brother. Kicking Bear was a noted warrior and leader of the Ghost Dance. [...] Black Fox II ("Young Black Fox") was Flying Hawk's half-brother and named for his father. Crazy Horse was the first cousin of Flying Hawk. [...] "Though nine years the senior of Flying Hawk, Crazy Horse and Flying Hawk were constant close friends and associates, and they were cousins." [...] Rattling Blanket Woman, the mother of Crazy Horse, was the sister of Iron Cedar Woman, the mother of Flying Hawk and Kicking Bear. [...] They would have addressed Crazy Horse as ciye, or 'elder brother'. Sitting Bull was Flying Hawk's uncle, Chief Flying Hawk’s mother Iron Cedar Woman and Sitting Bull’s wife being sisters. [...] At the age of 26, Flying Hawk married two sisters, [...] Goes Out Looking and White Day. Goes Out Looking bore him one son, Felix Flying Hawk. White Day had no child.|$|E
