2500|$|The Haubitze M1 {{was best}} {{described}} as an enlarged 24 cm Kanone 3. It used {{many of the same}} design principles as the smaller weapon including the dual-recoil system and a two-part carriage capable of all-around traverse when mounted on its firing platform. It also disassembled into six loads for transport. The loads were cradle, barrel, <b>top</b> <b>carriage,</b> bottom carriage, front platform and turntable and the rear platform. Each piece on its trailer was towed by a [...] Sd.Kfz. 9 half-track. A seventh half-track towed the gantry crane required to assemble the weapon. The gantry crane (powered by a generator on its towing vehicle) would be erected at the new firing position and would take about two hours to assemble the entire weapon.|$|E

Also present were members of the Royal Family, governors-general and prime ministers of the Commonwealth realms, officers of state, and representatives of many faiths. Afterwards, a formal lunch was held in Westminster Hall. The Queen returned to Buckingham Palace at 2:20 pm, in an open <b>top</b> <b>carriage</b> procession and escorted by The Household Cavalry Regiment. The King's Horse, Royal Horse Artillery fired a 60 gun salute during the procession.|$|E
50|$|The Mrs 18 was {{designed}} to replace the obsolescent World War I-era 21 cm Mörser 16. While the gun design itself was nothing innovative, the same cannot {{be said for the}} carriage. It {{was one of the first}} weapons, if not the first in quantity production, that used the interesting dual-recoil system. The barrel recoiled normally in its cradle, but, in addition, the whole <b>top</b> <b>carriage,</b> which carried the barrel and its cradle, recoiled across the main part of the carriage. This system damped out the recoil forces and made for a very steady firing platform. This carriage was also used for the 17 cm Kanone 18 in Mörserlafette and the 15 cm Schnelladekanone C/28 in Mörserlafette.|$|E
5000|$|Consisting of a {{stationary}} linear base and a moving carriage, roller slides work similarly to ball bearing slides, {{except that the}} bearings housed within the carriage are cylinder-shaped instead of ball shaped. The rollers crisscross each other at a 90° angle and move between the four semi-flat and parallel rods that surround the rollers. The rollers are between [...] "V" [...] grooved bearing races, one being on the <b>top</b> <b>carriage</b> {{and the other on}} the base. The travel of the carriage ends when it meets the end cap, a limiting component. Typically, carriages are constructed from aluminum and the rods and rollers are constructed from steel, while the end caps are constructed from stainless steel.|$|E

5000|$|The K 3's gun {{design was}} nothing innovative, {{but the same}} cannot {{be said for the}} carriage. Rheinmetall placed a lot of {{emphasis}} on ease of assembly. It did not require a crane because it used electric winches, mounted on the carriage, to pull various parts through a system of inclined ramps, guide rails and runways. It also used the Rheinmetall's dual-recoil system, first seen on the 21 cm Mörser 18. The barrel recoiled normally in its cradle, but, in addition, the whole <b>top</b> <b>carriage,</b> which carried the barrel and its cradle, recoiled across {{the main part of the}} carriage.

50|$|This weapon {{originated}} with the acquisition in 1912 of a 75 mm gun designed by Col. Deport of the French Army. The US Army wished {{to examine and}} adopt a split-trail carriage, which would allow a higher elevation for indirect fire and dropping shells into trenches. This carriage type was used on the prototype 3-inch model of 1913, which was later designated the 3-inch Gun M1916 after a major carriage redesign, prompted by field trials of the M1913. By early 1917 only 34 weapons had been completed; one source traces this to the Ordnance Department developing the weapon without input from the Field Artillery, compounded by a complex <b>top</b> <b>carriage</b> intended to allow 45 degrees of traverse. Shortly after the American entry into World War I, the US Army decided to adopt French and British weapons, and modify their own weapons where possible to accept French or British ammunition. The M1916 was modified to a 75 mm bore, including alteration of existing weapons, permitting interchangeability of ammunition with French guns as the 75 mm Gun M1916.|$|E

50|$|During World War 2 Riseley {{was used}} by the USAAF as a base to store and fill bombs which were then {{forwarded}} to local American air bases. A large camp was set up at the <b>top</b> of the <b>Carriage</b> Drive to Melchbourne House to house the troops. The camp included a cinema. The American airmen stationed in Riseley Camp occasionally held parties for local children and there are still residents living in Riseley who can recall attending the children's parties on the camp. A 'Forward Filling Station' was set up in the woods at the <b>top</b> of the <b>carriage</b> drive where bombs were filled with gas. The last remaining containers of gas were removed in the 1970s. However remnants of deadly mustard agent and its breakdown products still remain in part of Coppice Wood near Riseley in an area which is currently fenced off and surrounded by warning signs about toxic chemicals. This mustard gas was mean to have been removed in 1988 and then again in 1998 but some of it still remains in the wood. Bombs were also stored on the then closed Sharnbrook Road just past the junction with the Butts.|$|R

5000|$|The {{move from}} Winter Quarters to Utah saw Green Flake once again giving his all.

[...] Although here all credit is given to Green's master, it is evident from his own life that Green had a personal desire to be {{an active member of the}} LDS faith and help fellow Latter-day Saints in any way he could. Green was instructed by James Flake to take the mules and carriage, cross the plains with the first company of Saints, send the carriage and mules back with some of those who would return to Nebraska, and remain out west himself to build a house for the Flake family in preparation for their arrival.|$|R
