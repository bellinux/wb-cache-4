5|$|Proposals for a UNPA {{date back}} to the UN's {{formation}} in 1945, but largely stagnated until the 1990s.

5|$|After {{the fall}} of Singapore the Australian Government and many Australians feared that Japan would invade the Australian mainland. Australia was ill-prepared <b>to</b> <b>counter</b> such an attack as the RAAF lacked modern {{aircraft}} and the RAN was too small and unbalanced <b>to</b> <b>counter</b> the Imperial Japanese Navy. Additionally, the Army, although large, contained many inexperienced units and lacked mobility. In response to this threat most of the AIF was brought back from the Middle East and the Government appealed to the United States for assistance. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill attempted to divert the 6th and 7th Divisions to Burma while they were en route to Australia, but Curtin refused to authorise this movement. As a compromise two brigades of the 6th Division disembarked at Ceylon and formed part of the island's garrison until they returned to Australia in August 1942.|$|E

5|$|An initial UN counteroffensive out of Masan proved {{ineffective}} in stopping the North Koreans from advancing. In the subsequent fight, the 35th Infantry {{was able to}} repel the North Koreans at the Battle of Nam River and were highly regarded for these actions. However, the 24th Infantry performed very poorly at the battles of Blue Mountain and Haman, forcing the 25th Division to muster reserves <b>to</b> <b>counter</b> the North Korean gains against the 24th.|$|E

5|$|Budgeted at £300,000 – an {{increase}} of one fifth over Thunderbirds Are Go – in their approach to writing the sequel the Andersons decided to script a more light-hearted adventure <b>to</b> <b>counter</b> {{the seriousness of the}} original.

5|$|During the night, another storm broke (this time {{probably}} a thunder-storm, possibly with a south easterly wind), preventing the Allies from setting off southwards <b>to</b> <b>counter</b> the Persian detachment sent {{around the outside}} of Euboea.

This part of the Persian fleet was thus also shipwrecked, losing most of the ships.|$|E
5|$|During {{the years}} {{preceding}} {{the siege of}} Venice, {{it was believed that}} the Ottoman Empire had preparations underway to attack Malta. This suspicion became stronger when a well-groomed man, who had approached the Order to serve as engineer and offer his wealth of knowledge about fortifications, disappeared shortly after having surveyed Malta's fortifications. Consequently, the Order began its preparations <b>to</b> <b>counter</b> any possible attack by the Ottoman army.|$|E
