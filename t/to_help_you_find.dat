Cloud Search lets users search for {{information}} {{across the entire}} G Suite product lineup. Users can also search for contacts, with results including the person's contact details, as well as events and files in common. The Cloud Search mobile app features [...] "assist cards", described by Google as [...] "a new way <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> the right information at the right time. Using Google's machine intelligence technology, these cards can help you prepare for an upcoming meeting or even suggest files that need your attention". Google states that Cloud Search respects file-sharing permissions, meaning that users will only see results for files they have access to. The initial global rollout of Cloud Search introduced the functionality for G Suite Business and Enterprise customers, with Google stating that more functionality will be added over time, including support for third-party applications.|$|E

WSO also offers guidance as to the number of employees of each type that should be hired on a month-by-month basis. These decisions are the key to meeting seasonal demand changes in the best possible way. While WSO can be used in any environment, it is ideally suited to determining staffing mixes in environments with seasonal demand—it is in these environments that optimizing staffing can be particularly difficult. As inputs, the WSO requires information on the number of employee types (where types might be such things as full-time, part-time, and contract employees). For each employee type, WSO requires information on the employees 2 ̆ 7 productivity, hiring and termination costs, and attrition rates. For each month in the planning horizon, you must also specify the aggregate number of full-time-equivalent employees that will be necessary to meet forecast customer demand. As outputs, the WSO identifies the number of employees of each type that should be hired and terminated each month. It also presents the overall cost of the staffing plan, the cost by month of the recommended plan, and the number of each type employee that are expected to be working each month. WSO is a web-based tool that allows you to create, evaluate, and save different scenarios. This enables you to determine the effect on performance of such things as changing the available types of employees (using or not using contract employees, for example), changing the employee retention rates, and changing the employee productivity levels. We include a sample scenario, so that you can see how WSO works without having to first enter data...|$|R
40|$|Weight gain {{occurs when}} you eat more {{calories}} than your body uses. For example, there are 3, 500 calories in a pound. If a person eats 3, 500 calories and does not burn these calories, he/she will gain a pound. If a person burns 3, 500 calories more than is eaten, he/she will lose a pound. Will I gain weight when I quit smoking? When you quit smoking, you burn calories at a slower rate. Therefore, some people who quit smoking will gain weight because of this slow-down in their metabolism (the process that converts food into energy and controls {{the rate at which}} your body burns calories). Some people who quit smoking also increase their food consumption. Smokers who quit of-ten use food to deal with feelings of boredom, stress, or as a reward for not smoking. Also, those who quit often complain that they miss doing something with their hands and their mouth. <b>You</b> might <b>find</b> yourself snacking and eating more often {{to take the place of}} smoking. How can I avoid weight gain after quitting smoking? It is possible to stop smoking and not gain weight. Get the <b>help</b> and encouragement <b>you</b> need from people who support your efforts to quit. Talk to your health care provider about healthy eating or join a support group. Re-member that fad diets do not generally work. To reduce your cravings, try the following: ■ Eat a balanced and varied diet that contains fruits and vegetables. ■ Be sure to eat breakfast. ■ Limit foods high in fats and avoid concentrated sweets. ■ Drink plenty of water. ■ Eat slowly and stop eating when you feel full. ■ Increase your activity level to burn off calories more quickly. ■ Consider using nicotine replacement therapy during your quit attempt. It may <b>help</b> <b>you</b> avoid weight gain. How can exercise help? Exercise can help because it burns calories and stimulates your metabolism. When you exer-cise and burn more calories than you consume, your body uses fat for energy. Exercise also helps control your appetite and makes you want to eat less. Exercise decreases the urge for a cigarette and <b>helps</b> <b>you</b> deal with stress. Exer-cise improves your mood, your skin and body tone, as well as increases your strength. Where can I get <b>help</b> <b>to</b> quit smoking?
