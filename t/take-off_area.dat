50|$|Glen Beach, at the {{far right}} of Camps Bay beach, is known as Camps Bay's best surfing beach. Short, fast rides and a small <b>take-off</b> <b>area</b> makes Glen Beach {{one of the hardest}} of Cape Town's beach breaks to surf and has {{resulted}} in a strong local atmosphere.|$|E
50|$|In the {{southern}} coast, Salgueira Beach is a reflective Beach with swells from Northwest to southwest, with rocky outcrops and people as conditioning factors {{with a small}} <b>take-off</b> <b>area</b> {{in the middle of}} the beach. In the past, the local surfer community did not allowed beginners or outsiders to use this spot, known as localism in surf culture. Currently the spot is accessible to all. it is very popular among bodyboarders. During high tide, it is suitable for longboard and surf. Nearby Lagoa Beach has a spot suitable for novice surfers.|$|E
50|$|Because of {{the loose}} {{soil in the}} Asramam area, the landing and <b>take-off</b> <b>areas</b> were {{prepared}} by bringing huge quantities of red laterite soil from the hilly areas. The aerodrome had strong barbed wire fencing round it, with two entry points, one at {{the south and the}} other at the north. There were no buildings in the aerodrome, not even a shed, although there was a concreted area {{in the shape of a}} ring where the planes stopped after landing. It was here that the passengers alighted and boarded the plane. Planes used to land sometimes once in two months. The airport then came under the control of Kerala Public Works Department (PWD). Residents of Asramam knew in advance about the arrival of planes, because the PWD authorities, on getting information about a coming arrival, hoisted a windsock on a tall wooden mast.|$|R
25|$|Once {{a balloon}} pilot has {{completed}} {{a minimum of}} 3 solo take-offs, accumulated a minimum of 50 hours flight time in untethered balloons and 300 hours total balloon flight time, his licence may then be further endorsed for <b>take-offs</b> in built-up <b>areas.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{construction}} work for this airport began on September 23, 1935. The {{intention was to}} make a longer runway, but it proved impossible to accommodate for more than 475 meters, because the eastern portion of the land was very low. Part of the field had to be modified, in particular where the plane hit the ground during landing and <b>take-off.</b> This <b>area</b> covered more than 100 metres of the runway, and had to be paved with a mixture of sand and stone.|$|R
40|$|In many {{unmanned}} aerial vehicle (UAV) applications, ﬂexible trajectory generation algorithms {{are required}} to enable high levels of autonomy for critical mission phases, such as <b>take-off,</b> <b>area</b> coverage, and landing. In this paper, we present a guidance approach which uses the improved intrinsic tau guidance theory to create 4 -D trajectories for the desired time-to-contact (TTC) with a landing platform tracked by a visual sensor. This allows us to perform maneuvers with tunable trajectory proﬁles, while catering for static or non-static starting and terminating motion states. We validate our method using a rotary-wing UAV to land on a static platform. Results from simulations and outdoor experiments show that our approach achieves smooth, accurate landings with easily adjustable parameters...|$|E
40|$|Despite of {{the level}} of visual aquity, European Records in long jumping are greater in class F 12 (visual acuity 2 / 60) than class F 13 (visual acuity 6 / 60) both in males and females. The aim {{of the present study was}} to compare the biomechanical {{parameters}} of the final strides of the approach and the take-off in class F 12 and F 13 long jumpers. 19 class F 12 (males: 13, females: 6) and 12 class F 13 (males: 4, females: 8) long jumpers participating in the 2009 International Blind Sports Association European Championships were recorded using a stationary digital video camera (sampling frequency: 300 fps). Key biomechanical parameters were extracted with a typical 2 D-DLT kinematical analysis. Differences between groups were investigated using Independent samples t-test. Results indicated that the official distance was 6. 07 m ± 0. 55 and 5. 52 m ± 0. 91 for F 12 and F 13 respectively (p<. 05). Significant differences were also observed concerning the vertical take-off velocity (F 12 : 2. 8 m/sec, F 13 : 2. 4 m/sec), the support leg's knee flexion (F 12 : 18. 2 deg, F 13 : 25. 2 deg) and the knee joint flexion velocity (F 12 : 7. 4 rad/sec, F 13 : 10. 2 rad/sec) at the take-off board and the knee maximum flexion angle at the last stride (F 12 : 116. 8 deg, F 13 : 125. 4 deg). In conclusion, F 12 performed better than F 13 because of the more advantageus utilization of the factors defining the vertical component in the long- jump take-off. Additionally, the different last stride maximum knee flexion angle might imply differences concerning the mechanics of the placement of the take-off leg. It is possible that factors such as the size and surface properties of the 1. 22 m x 1. 00 m chalked <b>take-off</b> <b>area</b> used in F 12 competition may contribute to the differences observed in the study...|$|E

50|$|The Thorshavn and Klarius Mikkelsen, {{along with}} Lars Christensen, {{were back in}} the Vestfold Hills area in the 1936-37 summer. An area to the {{immediate}} north of the Vestfold Hills was used as a <b>take-off</b> and landing <b>area</b> for a seaplane, from which oblique aerial photos were taken for mapping purposes. The first map of the Vestfold Hills, derived from this imagery, was published after World War II.|$|R
25|$|At Tan Son Nhut, the VNAF's {{system of}} command and control was {{developed}} over the years with assistance from the USAF. The system handled the flow of aircraft from <b>take-off</b> to target <b>area,</b> {{and return to the}} base it was launched from. This was known as the Tactical Air Control System (TACS), and it assured positive control of all areas where significant combat operations were performed. Without this system, {{it would not have been}} possible for the VNAF to deploy its forces effectively where needed.|$|R
50|$|After World War II the {{airfield}} was handed {{back to the}} LGC and gliding operations resumed.In the post-war years {{the airfield}} was expanded as neighbouring fields were purchased, and the gradual replacement of wood and fabric gliders by high performance glass fibre gliders, often constructed using advanced materials such as carbon fibre. These modern gliders required longer <b>take-off</b> and landing <b>areas,</b> and {{large areas of the}} airfield were levelled. Bungee launching from the crest of the Downs became less frequent as the aerotow became more viable, and as winch launches were able to achieve greater height. The club training fleet was modernised, and is constantly kept up to date.|$|R
5000|$|The {{airspace}} immediately {{surrounding the}} heliport {{is called the}} Primary Surface. This area coincides in shape and size with the designated <b>take-off</b> and landing <b>area.</b> This surface is a horizontal plane equal to the elevation of the established heliport elevation. The Primary Surface is further broken down into three distinct regions. These are, the Touchdown and Liftoff (TLOF) area, the Final Approach and Takeoff (FATO) area and the Safety Area. [...] The TLOF is a load-bearing, generally paved area, normally centered in the FATO, on which the helicopter lands and/or takes off. The FATO is a defined area over which the pilot completes {{the final phase of}} the approach to a hover or a landing and from which the pilot initiates takeoff. The FATO elevation is the lowest elevation of the edge of the TLOF. The Safety Area is a defined area on a heliport surrounding the FATO intended {{to reduce the risk of}} damage to helicopters accidentally diverging from the FATO.|$|R
40|$|Aviation {{technologies}} and concepts {{have reached a}} level of maturity that may soon enable an era of on-demand mobility (ODM) fueled by quiet, efficient, and largely automated air taxis. However, successfully bringing such a system to fruition will require introducing orders of magnitude more aircraft to a given airspace volume than can be accommodated by the traditional air traffic control system, among other important technical challenges. The airspace integration problem is further compounded by requirements to set aside appropriate ground infrastructure for <b>take-off</b> and landing <b>areas</b> and ensuring these new aircraft types and their operations do not burden traditional airspace users and air traffic control. This airspace integration challenge may be significantly reduced by extending the concepts and technologies developed to manage small unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) at low altitude - the UAS traffic management (UTM) system - to higher altitudes and new aircraft types, or by equipping ODM aircraft with advanced sensors, algorithms, and interfaces. The precedent of operational freedom inherent in visual flight rules and the technologies developed for large UAS and commercial aircraft automation {{will contribute to the}} evolution of an ODM system enabled by UTM. This paper describes the set of air traffic services, normally provided by the traditional air traffic system, that an ODM system would implement to achieve the high densities needed for ODM's economic viability. Finally, the paper proposes a framework for integrating, evaluating, and deploying low-, medium-, and high-density ODM concepts that build on each other to ensure operational and economic feasibility at every step...|$|R
