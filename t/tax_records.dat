5|$|Hieratic is a simplified, cursive form of Egyptian hieroglyphs. Like hieroglyphs, hieratic {{was used}} in sacred and {{religious}} texts. By the 1st millennium BC, calligraphic hieratic became the script predominantly used in funerary papyri and temple rolls. Whereas the writing of hieroglyphs required the utmost precision and care, cursive hieratic could be written much more quickly and was therefore more practical for scribal record-keeping. Its primary purpose was {{to serve as a}} shorthand script for non-royal, non-monumental, and less formal writings such as private letters, legal documents, poems, <b>tax</b> <b>records,</b> medical texts, mathematical treatises, and instructional guides. Hieratic could be written in two different styles; one was more calligraphic and usually reserved for government records and literary manuscripts, the other was used for informal accounts and letters.|$|E

In the first two years, he tried to use the charity to buy and preserve a tract of land in New Hope, Pennsylvania. This venture failed in 1998 when the property owner declined Borislow's offer. Following this, D made donations to the Clearwater Endoscopy Center and the Center for Digestive Healthcare in Clearwater, Florida until 2001. Since then, it has issued varied grants to causes Borislow supported, such as $2.75 million to two yeshivas and $173,450 to a West Palm Beach, Florida private school. <b>Tax</b> <b>records</b> indicate that Borislow and George Farley, {{the chief financial officer}} of the non-profit, split approximately $2.1 million in profits from 2001-2005, while $1.6 million went to charitable causes. Borislow drew criticism in 2007 when he paid himself $1.7 million through the charity.|$|E
5|$|The {{area was}} {{populated}} in the Stone Age by Inari Sami people {{shortly after the}} last glacial period ended about 8000BC. The first documents from the area are <b>tax</b> <b>records</b> from the 16th century. The Inari Sami originally subsisted on hunting, gathering and especially fishing; later they began to complement this by reindeer husbandry, and later still by farming and herding cattle and sheep. The area belonged to the Inari Siida beginning in the Middle Ages. Until the border was closed in 1852, the Sami from Norway came during winter to herd their reindeer. The closing of the border caused some Norwegian Sami to settle {{in the area and}} continue with reindeer husbandry. This caught on among the Inari Sami, and the amount of husbandry increased during the 20th century. People in the area traveled up Lake Inari and onwards to the coast of Finnmark, Norway, to fish during summer. Records of markets in Finnmark date back to the 16th century, and in the 1880s about 150 people traveled to the coast each year. Logging in the southern part boomed during the 1920s, when logs were driven down the Pasvik River to Elvenes and Jakobsnes in Norway. Previously there were birch forests in the fells, but in the 1960s their leaves were eaten by the caterpillar of the autumnal moth, leaving the fells barren. The construction of the Paatsjoki River Hydroelectric Plants starting in the 1940s had a strong negative effect on the fish population; in 1976 the authorities therefore enforced the obligatory introduction of fish in Lake Inari.|$|E

The theoretical part of the thesis introduces and specifies the issue of various business record keeping systems, valuation method analyses and assets and debts record keeping. Units of accounts and accounting principles and rules are specified here. The end of the theoretical part states the reasons for transition and specifies general transition principles. Tax and accounting procedures are analysed. The chapter titled Own Solution elaborates on individual stages of transition based on the analyses of data provided by the entrepreneur. A method utilising data bridge (created on the basis of carried out assets and debts inventory taking) has been used. The chapter titled Tax Incidence quantifies the tax implications of transfer from <b>tax</b> <b>record</b> to keeping accountancy as regards referable and deductible items. It presents comparison of tax base as calculated on the basis of <b>tax</b> <b>record</b> and on the basis of double-entry accounting.
