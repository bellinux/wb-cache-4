5|$|East of {{this station}} on the IND side are <b>turnouts</b> for a {{connection}} to Phase 3 of the Second Avenue Subway, clearly visible from a moving train, which would allow future service from Queens towards Midtown and Downtown Manhattan. Also to the east, the eastbound track of the IND line rises to the upper level of the tunnel, as both IND tracks are located on the upper level of 63rd Street Tunnel for the trip under the East River. The two tracks on the lower level of that tunnel are being connected to the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) via the East Side Access project. The project will bring trains from the LIRR's Main Line to Grand Central Terminal, but, as of December 2016, the lower level is currently unused.|$|E

5|$|The EU {{accession}} referendum {{passed with}} 66.27% votes cast in support, 33.13% against the proposed joining of the EU and 0.60% invalid or blank votes; it also passed in all Croatian counties. The greatest {{support for the}} referendum was recorded in Međimurje and Brod-Posavina counties, at 75.73% and 72.61% respectively. The lowest support for EU accession was recorded in Dubrovnik-Neretva County, where 42.22% of votes were cast against the proposal. The average official turnout for the referendum was 43.51%; the highest official <b>turnouts</b> were recorded {{in the city of}} Zagreb and in Varaždin County at 55.13% and 53.66% respectively. The result was binding on the Croatian Parliament; as a consequence, it ratified the accession treaty on 9 March 2012. The outcome was welcomed by all political parties represented in Croatia's parliament; some right-wing politicians objected to the low turnout and what they consider a loss of independence.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the <b>Turnout</b> Drift Operating Envelope Calculation is to {{identify}} the design parameters of the typical <b>turnout</b> drift and advance the preliminary design of the typical <b>turnout</b> drift. The scope of this calculation requires the <b>turnout</b> drift geometry be identified in sufficient detail to provide input to develop a typical <b>turnout</b> drift design. This <b>turnout</b> drift design strategy {{will be used to}} develop a preliminary <b>turnout</b> drift design for each distinct grouping of <b>turnout</b> drift type. The calculation will define the operating envelope of the relevant interfaces such as the <b>turnout</b> drift invert and the ventilation door. This information will be used to describe the space allocation of the <b>turnout</b> drift components and operating equipment. The <b>turnout</b> drift is an elemental component of the subsurface repository design layout.

5|$|The westernmost part of {{the line}} entailed {{aggressive}} completion of the 63rd Street Tunnel, {{as well as the}} connections from the tunnel to the IND Sixth Avenue Line and the BMT Broadway Line. The 63rd Street tunnel under the East River would have two subway tracks on its upper level and two LIRR tracks on its lower level. The cross-river portion of the line would reduce overcrowding on the IND Queens Boulevard Line, on the IRT Flushing Line, and on the 60th Street Tunnel's services. The 63rd Street tunnel would facilitate service between the Queens Boulevard Line and the Second Avenue Subway, via bellmouths west of Roosevelt Island which turn south towards Midtown and Lower Manhattan; these <b>turnouts</b> may be used for the third and fourth phases of a new Second Avenue Subway project, which started in 2007.|$|E
5|$|When {{proposed}} in the mid-1960s under the MTA's Program for Action, the Archer Avenue and 63rd Street subway lines were two parts of a major planned expansion of Queens Boulevard line service. The 63rd Street tunnel would have facilitated service between the Queens Boulevard line and the Second Avenue Subway, via bellmouths west of Roosevelt Island which turn south towards Midtown and Lower Manhattan. These <b>turnouts</b> {{may be used for}} the third and fourth phases of the Second Avenue Subway. The proposed connection to the LIRR Rockaway Beach Branch resurfaced, with proposed branch lines along other LIRR lines to outer Queens areas without rapid transit service. Expected to be completed by the mid-1970s and early 1980s, these plans (the most important of which are outlined below) were derailed by the 1970s fiscal crisis, which delayed the completion of the Archer Avenue and 63rd Street lines.|$|E
5|$|To {{catch the}} public's attention, this train {{was not simply}} rolled out of the factory; it made a dash {{from one end of}} the CB, in Denver, to the other, in Chicago on May 26, 1934. The {{railroad}} spared no expense in planning the operations. All other trains along the Zephyrs route were diverted to sidings and the <b>turnouts</b> were spiked into the proper alignment for the Zephyrs run. Track and maintenance of way workers checked every spike and bolt along the train's route to ensure that there would not be any problems, and temporary speed signs were installed along the route to warn the Zephyrs crew of curves that would be dangerous at high speeds. On the day of the dash, every road grade crossing was manned by a flagman to stop automobile traffic ahead of the train and to ensure that the crossing was clear. Stations along the route were protected by local police officers and members of the American Legion and the Boy Scouts of America.|$|E

25|$|An {{improved}} junction {{replaces the}} diamond with <b>turnouts,</b> {{which can be}} of as fine an angle as possible, so that this junction can carry branch traffic at high speed. This configuration assumes power operation of the points, as high speed <b>turnouts</b> are generally not suitable for mechanical operation. The high speed <b>turnouts</b> may require more than one point machine each. The <b>turnouts</b> can have no superelevation while the curve in the branch can; therefore the radius in the <b>turnouts</b> must be greater than the radius of the curve in the branch.|$|E

40|$|Voting is a habit. People {{learn the}} habit of voting, or not, based on {{experience}} in their first few elections. Recent {{research has shown that}} elections that do not stimulate high <b>turnout</b> among young adults leave a 'footprint' of low <b>turnout</b> in the age structure of the electorate as many individuals who were new at those elections fail to vote at subsequent elections. Elections that stimulate high <b>turnout</b> leave a high <b>turnout</b> footprint. So a country's <b>turnout</b> history provides a baseline for current <b>turnout</b> that is largely set, except for young adults. This realization requires us to take a new approach to understanding the mainsprings of <b>turnout</b> change [...] and hence of <b>turnout</b> decline. In this paper we theorize about the longitudinal effects on <b>turnout</b> of changes in the character of elections, and test this theory using data from every one of the 22 countries that have held elections continuously since 1945 : 356 elections in all. Recent research into voter <b>turnout</b> has repeatedly demonstrated the importance of generational replacement in <b>turnout</b> change (Miller and Shanks 1996, Lyons and Alexander 2000; Putnam 2000, 2001; Blais et al. 2001; Franklin and Wessels 2002; Blais and Dobrzynska 2003; Franklin 2003 a, 2003 b). <b>Turnout</b> change, it appears, is led by the youngest members of the electorate who, as they age, become set in their ways at a level of <b>turnout</b> that may differ from the level demonstrated by previous or later electoral cohorts. Two questions arise from this finding: (1) what is it that leads different generations to display different levels of <b>turnout?</b> And (2) in what ways do generational differences in <b>turnout</b> generate <b>turnout</b> change over time? In this paper we address these questions employing data relating to all the elections conducted since World War II in a [...] ...|$|R
25|$|The {{nature of}} {{elections}} also varies between nations. In the United States, negative campaigning and character attacks {{are more common}} than elsewhere, potentially suppressing <b>turnouts.</b> The focus placed on {{get out the vote}} efforts and mass-marketing can have important effects on turnout. Partisanship is an important impetus to turnout, with the highly partisan more likely to vote. Turnout tends to be higher in nations where political allegiance is closely linked to class, ethnic, linguistic, or religious loyalties. Countries where multiparty systems have developed also tend to have higher <b>turnouts.</b> Nations with a party specifically geared towards the working class will tend to have higher <b>turnouts</b> among that class than in countries where voters have only big tent parties, which try to appeal to all the voters, to choose from.|$|E

40|$|Aggregate <b>turnout</b> {{rates are}} among the central {{indicators}} of democratic performance in the American polity. Despite the considerable implications of macro <b>turnout,</b> however, most studies of <b>turnout</b> focus in-stead on the micro level. As a consequence, we know little about how local, political, and historical in-fluences have impacted <b>turnout</b> {{over the course of}} American political development. The result is a somewhat impoverished conception of <b>turnout</b> that often removes the political from political participa-tion. In this article, I argue for a new, macro-level perspective that highlights the political dimension of <b>turnout</b> by placing <b>turnout</b> in the local political settings in which it has taken place. I contrast two com-peting explanations of macro <b>turnout</b> variation across local electorates, a political account and Elazar’s cultural thesis, and discuss their implications for the political geography of macro <b>turnout</b> in American electoral history. I then examine this political geography by employing a local indicator of spatial asso-ciation (a LISA statistic) to identify the spatial structuring of macro <b>turnout</b> in the United States from 1828 through 2000. I demonstrate that a political perspective provides greater leverage than Elazar’s cul-tural perspective in explaining the political geography of macro <b>turnout</b> in the United States...|$|R
