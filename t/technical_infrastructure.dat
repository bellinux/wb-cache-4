As input to the framework, characteristics of interdependencies and {{the objectives of the}} modelling framework are discussed. The overall approach is to divide the modelling of <b>technical</b> <b>infrastructures</b> into two parts, a topological part and a functional part. The topological part describes the structure and how components are connected. The functional part describes the flow of the infrastructure and how the system reacts when strains affect it. This generic approach of how to model individual infrastructures then enables the inclusion of dependencies in and analyses of a “system-of-system” model. Three perspectives of vulnerability analyses are also presented: global vulnerability, critical components and geographical vulnerability. The presented framework is utilized in, but not limited to, the context of vulnerability analyses in Chap. 6 for two different types of interdependent <b>technical</b> <b>infrastructures...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Technical</b> <b>infrastructures</b> of {{the society}} are {{becoming}} more and more interconnected and interdependent, i. e. the function of an infrastructure influences the function of other infrastructures. Disturbances in one infrastructure therefore often traverse to other dependent infrastructures and possibly even back to the infrastructure where the failure originated. It is becoming increasingly important to take these interdependencies into account when assessing the vulnerability of <b>technical</b> <b>infrastructures.</b> In the present paper, an approach for modelling interdependent <b>technical</b> <b>infrastructures</b> is proposed. The modelling approach considers structural properties, as employed in graph theory, as well as functional properties to increase its fidelity and usefulness. By modelling a fictional electrified railway network that consists of five systems and interdependencies between the systems, it is shown how the model can be employed in a vulnerability analysis. The model aims to capture both functional and geographic interdependencies. It is concluded that the proposed modelling approach is promising and suitable in the context of vulnerability analyses of interdependent systems...|$|R

A modelling approach for interdependent <b>technical</b> <b>infrastructures</b> is proposed and three perspectives for the analysis of vulnerabilities are introduced, addressing the complexities associated with comprehensively analysing <b>technical</b> interdependent <b>infrastructures.</b> An empirical analysis of the railway system in southern Sweden is conducted, a system consisting of seven interdependent supporting systems.

The proposed method addresses this problem. In exemplifying the method, an analysis of an electric power distribution system in a Swedish municipality is presented. It is concluded that the proposed method facilitates the identification of critical sets of components for large-scale <b>technical</b> <b>infrastructures...</b>|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{treats the}} subject of risk and {{vulnerability}} analysis of large-scale <b>technical</b> <b>infrastructures.</b> In particular {{the focus is on}} the development of methods for vulnerability analysis of electrical distribution systems. The methods and the concepts behind them should nevertheless also be seen as applicable to other <b>technical</b> <b>infrastructures.</b> Robust and reliable <b>technical</b> <b>infrastructures</b> are a prerequisite for modern society. If they fail to deliver their services, severe consequences arise. Two major crises in Sweden regarding the supply of electricity have clearly showed the magnitude of the consequences on society and its dependency on a reliable electricity supply and the emergency response necessary to return to normal. Furthermore, most <b>technical</b> <b>infrastructures</b> depend on a reliable power supply for their proper functioning. The power supply in turn relies on some of these for its proper operation and control. There is a need for methods aimed at assessing the vulnerability of the interconnected infrastructures the society depends upon. In the thesis two approaches, or methods, of assessing the vulnerability of <b>technical</b> <b>infrastructures</b> are presented: global vulnerability analysis and critical components. The applicability of the methods was tested by empirical studies of three electrical distribution systems in Sweden. The result from the global vulnerability analysis clearly shows that distribution systems are highly vulnerable to some type of perturbations. The results from the analysis of critical components show that the methods can be used for finding and ranking components that are critical for the system and that they render a very feasible way to test the system for N-k contingencies. The design approach of the methods was to use a network model and a corresponding physical model of the electrical distribution system. The network model contains the topological information. The physical model describes the behavior of the network. Performance measures have been developed to describe the consequences of perturbation to the network. The studies indicate that these measures are relevant for describing vulnerability of an electrical distribution system and in finding its critical components. The design approach of the methods constitutes an important step towards vulnerability analysis of interdependent infrastructures. The results from applying the methods can be useful for emergency mitigation and preparedness planning. The results can further be visualized in the form of geographical vulnerability maps. These maps can facilitate the discussions between persons working in different fields...|$|R
