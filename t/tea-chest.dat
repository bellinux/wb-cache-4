25|$|In 1955, the {{brothers}} Barry, Robin and Maurice Gibb {{moved back to}} their father Hugh Gibb's hometown of Chorlton-cum-Hardy, Manchester, England, and formed a skiffle/rock-and-roll group, the Rattlesnakes, which consisted of Barry on guitar and vocals, Robin and Maurice on vocals, and friends Paul Frost on drums and Kenny Horrocks on <b>tea-chest</b> bass. In December 1957, the boys began to sing in harmony. The story is told {{that they were going}} to lip sync to a record in the local Gaumont cinema (as other children had done on previous weeks), but as they were running to the theatre, the fragile shellac 78-RPM record broke. The brothers had to sing live and received such a positive response from the audience that they decided to pursue a singing career. In May 1958, the Rattlesnakes were disbanded when Frost and Horrocks left, so the Gibb brothers then formed Wee Johnny Hayes and the Blue Cats, with Barry as Johnny Hayes.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the value of a measure of children’s attention to predict ADHD diagnoses. Theoretical and empirical literature on ADHD, children’s attention, assessment of children’s attention, and the <b>TEA-Ch</b> (Thames Valley Test Company, 1999), an objective measure of the attention, were reviewed. The <b>TEA-Ch</b> was designed without cutoff or overall scores from which to make inferences on performance. In an attempt to demonstrate the clinical utility of the measure, this study empirically investigated the strength of children’s performance on the <b>TEA-Ch</b> to accurately predict the presence or absence of an ADHD diagnosis, as well as relations between age, gender, and diagnosis. Additionally, cut points were established to investigate another method for identifying diagnoses with the <b>TEA-Ch.</b> Participants included 166 clinic-referred children whom received psychoeducational evaluations. Three subtests of the <b>TEA-Ch</b> were used as predictors of diagnosis. Results indicated that none of the subtests served as significant predictors of the presence or absence of an ADHD diagnosis. Contrary to expectation, the sustained attention component of the <b>TEA-Ch</b> did not serve as a better predictor than the selective and switching attention components. Similarly, the cut point findings were also contrary to expectation in that typical performance as opposed to low performance served as a better identifier of diagnosis for all three attention components. Consistent with expectations, the 2 standard deviation cut points yielded higher percentages of correctly identified cases. There were no significant differences in performance on the <b>TEA-Ch</b> between the children with and without ADHD diagnoses. As expected, there were significant relations between both age and gender and diagnosis the sample. Future research should include all subtests of the <b>TEA-Ch</b> as predictors of ADHD...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{explore the}} psychometric {{properties}} of the Test of Everyday Attention for Children (<b>TEA-Ch)</b> {{in the context of a}} Chinese setting. METHODS: Confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to examine the construct validity of the Chinese version of the <b>TEA-Ch</b> among a group of 232 children without attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Test-retest reliability was tested on a random sub-sample of 20 children at a 4 -week interval. Clinical discrimination was also examined by comparing children with and without ADHD (22 in each group) on the performances of the <b>TEA-Ch.</b> RESULTS: The current Chinese sample demonstrated a three-factor solution for attentional performance among children without ADHD, namely selective attention, executive control/switch, and sustained attention (chi(2) (24) = 34. 56; RMSEA =. 044; p =. 075). Moreover, the whole test demonstrated acceptable test-retest reliability at a 4 -week interval among a small sub-sample. Children with ADHD performed significantly more poorly than healthy controls in most of the subtests of the <b>TEA-Ch.</b> CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study demonstrate that the test items remain useful in China, a culture very different from that in which the test originated. Finally, the <b>TEA-Ch</b> also presents several advantages when compared to other conventional objective measures of attention.

500|$|The group first rehearsed in Shotton's {{house on}} Vale Road, {{but because of}} the noise his mother told them to use the {{corrugated}} air-raid shelter in the back garden. Rehearsals were moved from the cold air-raid shelter to Hanton's or Griffiths' house—as Griffiths' father had died in WWII, and his mother worked all day. The band also often visited Lennon's mother at 1 Blomfield Road, listening to her collection of rock and roll records by Elvis, Shirly and Lee's [...] "Let the Good Times Roll", and Gene Vincent's [...] "Be-Bop-A-Lula" [...] which they added to their repertoire. After his tenure on <b>tea-chest</b> bass, Nigel Walley became the group's manager.

40|$|The Test of Everyday Attention for Children (<b>TEA-Ch)</b> is a {{reliable}} neuropsychological assessment of attention control in children. Methylphenidate (MPH) {{is an effective}} treatment to improve attentional difficulties in children with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Previous studies investigating the effects of MPH on attention performance of children with ADHD have produced mixed results and prior MPH usage may have confounded these results. No previous study has tested the effects of MPH on the entire <b>TEA-Ch</b> battery. This study investigated the effects of MPH on attention performance using the entire <b>TEA-Ch</b> in 51 medication-na?ve children with ADHD compared with 35 nonmedicated typically developing children. All children were tested at baseline and after 6 weeks: The children with ADHD were medication-na?ve at baseline, received MPH for 6 weeks and were tested whilst on medication at the second testing session. A beneficial effect of MPH administration was found {{on at least one}} subtest of each of the three forms of attention (selective, sustained, and attentional control) assessed by the <b>TEA-Ch,</b> independent of practice effects.

40|$|Children with {{attention}} deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) were examined on four subtests of the Test of Everyday Attention for Children (<b>TEA‐Ch)</b> when on and off stimulant medication. Performance was assessed relative to 18 individually age‐matched controls. Children with ADHD performed significantly worse on <b>TEA‐Ch</b> measures when off compared to when on stimulant medication. This was found in both predominantly inattentive (n = 6) and combined inattentive and hyperactive‐impulsive (n = 12) subtypes. The age‐matched controls significantly improved with repeated testing on most <b>TEA‐Ch</b> measures. Significant {{differences were found between the}} unmedicated children with ADHD and age‐matched controls on sustained attention (Score! and Walk Don’t Walk) and attention control measures (Same and Opposite Worlds). When the ADHD group was on stimulant medication, with the exception of the Walk Don’t Walk subtest, no significant differences were found between them and the age‐matched controls. Unlike the <b>TEA‐Ch</b> subtests, the significant differences between the two groups on the Test of Word Reading Efficiency (TOWRE) subtests remained when attentional status was altered in the children with ADHD. The study supports further investigations of the <b>TEA‐Ch</b> as a measure sensitive to changes in stimulant medication in children with ADHD. ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Test of Everyday Attention for Children (<b>TEA-Ch)</b> {{has been}} {{validated}} {{in different countries}} demonstrating {{that it is an}} instrument with a correct balance between reliability and duration. Given the shortage of trustworthy instruments of evaluation in our language for infantile population we decide to explore the Spanish version of the <b>TEA-Ch.</b> Methods. We administered <b>TEA-Ch</b> (version A) to a sample control of 133 Spanish children from 6 to 11 years enrolled in school in the Community of Madrid. Four children were selected at random by course of Primary Education, distributing the sex of equivalent form. Descriptive analysis and comparison by ages and sex in each of the <b>TEA-Ch's</b> subtests were conducted to establish a profile of the sample. In order to analyze the effect of the age, subjects were grouped in six sub-samples: 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 years-old. Results. This first descriptive analysis demonstrates age exerted a significant effect on each measure, due to an important "jump" in children's performance between 6 and 7 years-old. The effect of sex was significant only in two visual attention measures (Sky Search & Map) and interaction age and sex exerted a significant effect only in the dual task (Score DT). Conclusions. The results suggest that the Spanish version of the <b>TEA-Ch</b> (A) might be a useful instrument to evaluate attentional processes in Spanish child population...|$|R

500|$|Burke and Hare murdered two lodgers in June, [...] "an {{old woman}} and a dumb boy, her grandson", as Burke later {{recalled}} in his confession. While the boy sat by {{the fire in the}} kitchen, his grandmother was murdered in the bedroom by the usual method. Burke and Hare then picked up the boy and carried him to the same room where he was also killed. Burke later said that this was the murder that disturbed him the most, as he was haunted by his recollection of the boy's expression. The <b>tea-chest</b> that was usually used by the couple to transport the bodies was found to be too small, so the bodies were forced into a herring barrel and taken to Surgeons' Square, where they fetched £8 each. According to Burke's confession, the barrel was loaded onto a cart which Hare's horse refused to pull further than the Grassmarket. Hare called a porter with a handcart to help him transport the container. Once back in Tanner's Close, Hare took his anger out on the horse by shooting it dead in the yard.|$|E
500|$|At {{some point}} in early-to-mid 1828 a Mrs Haldane, whom Burke {{described}} as [...] "a stout old woman", lodged at Hare's premises. After she became drunk, she fell asleep in the stable; she was smothered and sold to Knox. Several months later Haldane's daughter (either called Margaret or Peggy) also lodged at Hare's house. She and Burke drank together heavily and he killed her, without Hare's assistance; her body was put into a <b>tea-chest</b> and taken to Knox where Burke was paid £8. The next murder occurred in May 1828, when an old woman joined the house as a lodger. One evening while she was intoxicated, Burke smothered her—Hare was not present in {{the house at the}} time; her body was sold to Knox for £10. Then came the murder of Effy (sometimes spelt Effie), a [...] "cinder gatherer" [...] who scavenged through bins and rubbish tips to sell her findings. Effy was known to Burke, and had previously sold him scraps of leather for his cobbling business. Burke tempted her into the stable with whisky, and when she was drunk enough he and Hare killed her; Knox gave £10 for the body. Another victim was found by Burke too drunk to stand. She was being helped by a local constable back to her lodgings when Burke offered to take her there himself; the policeman obliged, and Burke took her back to Hare's house where she was killed. Her corpse raised a further £10 from Knox.|$|E
40|$|The {{validity}} of the DSM-IV subtypes is a recurring diagnostic debate in attention deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Laboratory measures, such as the test of everyday attention for children (<b>TEA-Ch)</b> can help us address this question. <b>TEA-Ch</b> is a test battery covering different aspects of everyday attention relating to selective and sustained attention and attentional control. The aim {{of the current study}} was to investigate whether this instrument can differentiate between combined (ADHD-C) and inattentive subtype (ADHD-I) of ADHD. Subjects were recruited from a multidisciplinary ADHD outpatient unit and tested free of medication. Sixty-four children with a diagnosis of ADHD were included (38 with ADHD-C; 26 with ADHD-I). The control group was 76 children recruited from primary and secondary schools. Children with ADHD performed worse than controls on 6 out of 9 <b>TEA-Ch</b> subtests. However a regression analysis revealed that <b>TEA-Ch</b> subtests made only a marginal contribution to the correct classification of ADHD, once the effects of IQ and age are controlled. Confirmatory factor analysis in our ADHD group demonstrated that the three factor structure achieved a poor fit. More detailed analysis suggested that inferior performance on the tasks designed to test vigilance was not the result of deficient-sustained attention. ADHD-C and ADHD-I showed very few differences across tasks. In conclusion, our results provided not much support for the value of the ADHD-C and ADHD-I distinction in predicting difficulties in everyday attention...|$|R
40|$|The {{current study}} {{examined}} two commonly used neuropsychological assessments of executive functioning {{in a sample}} of children and adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The Test of Everyday Attention for Children (<b>TEA-Ch)</b> is a performance-based, objective measure of executive functioning, and the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Functioning (BRIEF) is a subjective, parent-report measure. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to establish the factor structures of these measures to determine their appropriateness with a sample of youth with ADHD. The association of these assessment tools with functional outcomes (academic achievement, social functioning) was examined to establish their ecological and incremental validity. A three-factor model for the <b>TEA-Ch</b> and a two-factor model with modifications for the BRIEF emerged as the best fitting models for each measure. Regarding ecological validity, the Behavioral Regulation factor of the BRIEF was positively associated with social difficulties, and the Switching factor of the <b>TEA-Ch</b> was positively related to achievement in math, written expression, and math fluency. No support for the incremental validity of executive functioning measures was provided. Results have implications for researchers, clinicians, and educators who study, assess, treat, and educate youth with ADHD experiencing executive dysfunction and associated difficulties...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Persistent neurocognitive {{impairments}} {{occur in}} a fifth of children hospitalized with severe falciparum malaria. There is little data on the association between different neurological phenotypes of severe malaria (seizures, impaired consciousness and prostration) and impairments in executive function. METHODS: Executive functioning of children exposed to severe malaria with different neurological phenotypes (N = 58) and in those unexposed (N = 56) was examined using neuropsychological tests such as vigilance test, test for everyday attention test for children (<b>TEA-Ch),</b> contingency naming test (CNT) and self-ordered pointing test (SOPT). Linear regression {{was used to determine}} the association between neurological phenotypes of severe malaria and executive function performance scores, accounting for potential confounders. RESULTS: Children with complex seizures in severe malaria performed more poorly than unexposed controls in the vigilance (median efficiency scores (interquartile range) = 4. 84 (1. 28 - 5. 68) vs. 5. 84 (4. 71 - 6. 42), P = 0. 030) and SOPT (mean errors (standard deviation) = 29. 50 (8. 82) vs. 24. 80 (6. 50), P = 0. 029) tests, but no differences were observed in <b>TEA-Ch</b> and CNT tests. Performance scores for other neurological phenotypes of severe malaria were similar with those of unexposed controls. After accounting for potential confounders, such as child's age, sex, schooling; maternal age, schooling and economic activity; perinatal factors and history of seizures, complex seizures remained associated with efficiency scores in the vigilance test (beta coefficient (β) (95 % confidence interval (CI)) = - 0. 40 (- 0. 67, - 0. 13), P = 0. 006) and everyday attention scores of the <b>TEA-Ch</b> test (β (95 % CI) = - 0. 57 (- 1. 04, - 0. 10), P = 0. 019); the association with SOPT error scores was weak (β (95 % CI) = 4. 57 (- 0. 73 - 9. 89), P = 0. 089). Combined neurological phenotypes were not significantly associated with executive function performance scores. CONCLUSION: Executive function impairment in children with severe malaria is associated with specific neurological phenotypes, particularly complex seizures. Effective prophylaxis and management of malaria-associated acute seizures may improve executive functioning performance scores of children...|$|R
500|$|Burke met {{two women}} in early April: Mary Paterson (also known as Mary Mitchell) and Janet Brown, in the Canongate area of Edinburgh. He bought the two women alcohol before {{inviting}} them back to his lodging for breakfast. The three left the tavern with two bottles of whisky and went instead to his brother's house. After his brother left for work, Burke and the women finished the whisky and Paterson fell asleep at the table; Burke and Brown continued talking but were interrupted by McDougal, who accused them of having an affair. A row broke out between Burke and McDougal—during which he threw a glass at her, cutting her over the eye—Brown stated {{that she did not}} know Burke was married and left; McDougal also left, and went to fetch Hare and his wife. They arrived shortly afterwards and the two men locked their wives out of the room, then murdered Paterson in her sleep. That afternoon the pair took the body to Knox in a <b>tea-chest,</b> while McDougal kept Paterson's skirt and petticoats; they were paid £8 for the corpse, which was still warm when they delivered it. Fergusson—one of Knox's assistants—asked where they had obtained the body, as he thought he recognised her. Burke explained that the girl had drunk herself to death, and they had purchased it [...] "from an old woman in the Canongate". Knox was delighted with the corpse, and stored it in whisky for three months before dissecting it. When Brown later searched for her friend, she was told that she had left for Glasgow with a travelling salesman.|$|E
500|$|The {{order of}} the two victims next after Joseph is also unclear; Rosner puts the {{sequence}} as Abigail Simpson followed by an English male lodger from Cheshire, while Bailey and Dudley Edwards each have the order as the English male lodger followed by Simpson. The unnamed Englishman was a travelling seller of matches and tinder who fell ill with jaundice at Hare's lodging house. As with Joseph, Hare was concerned with the effect this illness might have on his business, and he and Burke employed the same modus operandi they had with the miller: Hare suffocating their victim while Burke lay over the body to stop movement and noise. Simpson was a pensioner {{who lived in the}} nearby village of Gilmerton and visited Edinburgh to supplement her pension by selling salt. On 12 February 1828—the only exact date Burke quoted in his confession—she was invited into the Hares' house and plied with enough alcohol to ensure she was too drunk to return home. After murdering her, Burke and Hare placed the body in a <b>tea-chest</b> and sold it to Knox. They received £10 for each body, and Burke's confession records of Simpson's body that [...] "Dr Knox approved of its being so fresh... but [...] did not ask any questions". In either February or March that year an old woman was invited into the house by Margaret Hare. She gave her enough whisky to fall asleep, and when Hare returned that afternoon, he covered the sleeping woman's mouth and nose with the bed tick (a stiff mattress cover) and left her. She was dead by nightfall and Burke joined his companion to transport the corpse to Knox, who paid another £10.|$|E
500|$|Lonnie Johnson {{played at}} the Royal Festival Hall in 1952 on a bill opened by a group led by the young Tony Donegan, who later took Johnson's {{forename}} as his own. [...] Donegan became the key figure {{in the development of}} the British skiffle [...] "craze", beginning in Ken Colyer's Jazzmen by playing American folk and blues songs, particularly those derived from the recordings of Huddie Leadbetter, during intervals to the accompaniment of guitar, washboard and <b>tea-chest</b> bass in a lively style that emulated American jug bands. After Colyer left in 1954 to form a new outfit, the band became Chris Barber's Jazz Band, and members of the band played [...] "race blues" [...] songs in concert intervals and recorded as The Lonnie Donegan Skiffle Group. They released their high-tempo version of Leadbelly's [...] "Rock Island Line" [...] in 1956 and it became a major hit, spending eight months in the Top 20, peaking at number six (and number eight in the U.S.). It was the first début record to go gold in Britain, selling over a million copies worldwide. This stimulated the explosion of the British [...] "skiffle craze" [...] and it has been estimated that in the late 1950s there were 30–50,000 skiffle groups in Britain. Sales of guitars grew rapidly and groups performed on banjos, improvised bass and percussion in church halls, cafes and the flourishing coffee bars of Soho, London. In addition to members of the Beatles, a large number of British rhythm and blues musicians began their careers playing skiffle, including Van Morrison, Ronnie Wood, Mick Jagger and Roger Daltrey. The fashion created a demand for opportunities to play versions of American folk, blues and jazz music that would contribute to the growth of a club scene.|$|E
40|$|An {{influential}} {{model of}} working memory (Baddeley, 1994) {{was used as}} a conceptual framework for testing the neurological dopamine hypothesis of Tourette Syndrome (TS) that predicts dysfunctions of the prefrontal cortex. We administered a variety of screening measures as well as tests of dual task performance to children with TS (N = 40, 6 females) and age, sex and IQ matched controls. Parent ratings of TS children (Child Behaviour Check List) indicated many more problems and particularly with the Attention scale, than equivalent ratings by control group parents. Standardised tests purported to measure frontal lobe functioning (Wisconsin Card Sort Test, Tower of London), and specific tests of dual task perfor-mance (<b>TEA-Ch,</b> Visual Tracking and Memory Span Test), were of primary interest. The results indicated no group differences on the Wisconsin Card Sort or Tower of London tests. In the dual task measures, however, children with TS counted fewer spaceship blasts (in either condition of the <b>TEA-Ch)</b> and had reduced digit span in dual task conditions. Dual task decrement was found to be greater when the two tasks were conducted in the same modality, than when they were conducted in different modalities. For verbal memory, TS children showed poorer immediate recall of five common words and took longer to name pictures than controls. In terms of the model, impaired functioning of the phonological loop and the central executive control loop are implicated in TS rather than a generalised deficit of the central executive.

Outcomes included feasibility and acceptability of MYmind, objective measures of children's attention and related problems, parent-reported child executive function and behavior problems, and parents' parental stress, parenting styles, and mindful parenting. The attendance rate of MYmind (>= 6 out of 8 sessions) was 91 %: only one family withdrew from the course. Participants expressed overall positive views about MYmind. They also expressed their changes after the course, barriers and facilitators for course participation and completion, and suggestions on course improvement. The overall satisfaction scores were 7. 3 (2. 1) and 8. 0 (1. 2) out of 10 among the children and parents, respectively. With respect to the quantitative results, after multiple testing correction, positive results with large effect sizes only occurred on the objective attention tests: "time per target," "attention score," and "map mission" of the Test of Everyday Attention for Children (<b>TEA-Ch)</b> and "omissions" of the computerized Conners' Continuous Performance Test 3 rd Edition (CPT 3), whereas no statistically significant changes were seen in other measures, i. e., children's other results in the <b>TEA-Ch</b> and CPT 3, parents' perceived child problems on the Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory (ECBI) and the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF), as well as parents' scores of the Parenting Stress Index (PSI), Parenting Scale (PS), and Interpersonal Mindfulness in Parenting (IM-P). The MYmind course is a feasible and acceptable intervention among Chinese children with ADHD and their parents.

The {{study was conducted}} with a repeated measures design, with a paired sample within-groups t-test adapted from the <b>TEA-Ch</b> Sky Search measure of selective attention, and the card game Blink as a selective attention intervention. The participants (n = 8) showed a significant increase in selective attention skills after playing Blink for a duration of roughly two weeks t(7) = - 3. 135, p = 0. 016, d = 1. 11, supporting the research hypothesis that a game-based intervention can be a useful tool for improving selective attention. The implication of the study was that it may be feasible to implement further educational and cognitive interventions for the target population through cost-effective game-based interventions...|$|R

40|$|The {{incorporation}} of technological advance-ments {{in higher education}} has started to brid-ge the gap in local, national and global deli-very of dental courses. This gap, including the global decrease in senior clinical academics, has influenced {{the development of new}} <b>tea-ching</b> and learning techniques. Institutional virtual learning environments (VLE) and other e-learning resources are now in higher de-mand [1, 2]. This paper describes how one such innovati-ve solutions has been IVIDENT (International Virtual Dental School), has enabled secure and seamless access to high quality e-con-tent and tools through an innovative, univer-sal flexible learning platform. IVIDENT, now UDENTE (Universal Dental E-learning) has been shown to offer new learning experiences for students of dentistry, but its approach can apply across all educational domains. UDEN-TE also benefits staff as it allows them to con-tribute and access resources through peer reviewed publishing processes, which ensure the highest quality in education [3]. UDENTE was developed thanks to a £ 2. 3 million grant from the Higher Education Fun-ding Council for England (HEFCE) and th...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{concerns}} the didactics of the civics. It {{focuses on a}} game in <b>tea-ching.</b> The conception of a game in the didactics is a basic phenomenon of the teaching at the second level at a basic school. First, the thesis includes a theoretical and interpretative part. It is di-vided into chapters and subchapters. Its focus is different kinds of games {{and the use of}} them in teaching of the civics. The topics of the chapters are didactic games, simulation, education by experience, a list of different games, dramatic and action games, language games, and the choice of games, respectively. There is a list of games in each chapter and their practical use in teaching. There are also given definitions in some parts. Second, there is a part concerning the practical evaluation of the games after their previous use during my teaching within my work experience at a basic school. The aim of the thesis is the attempt to draw a conclusion whether the pupils accepted the individual games during my teaching or not, and whether the games have brought any benefit to them...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine empathic {{competence}} in children born extremely preterm (EP, < 28 weeks) given vulnerabilities in social relationships. Empathy in typically developing children is mediated by executive functions. Executive functioning is also impaired in preterm children. Of particular interest in this study are the attentional components of executive functioning as mediators of empathic development. Thirty-two 7 -year-old EP children and 40 age-matched term children participated in the Project K. I. D. S program and completed the Kids Empathy Development Scale (KEDS), Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-IV), and Test of Everyday Attention for Children (<b>TEA-Ch).</b> Children born extremely preterm exhibited poorer performance on all measures. The mediating role of attention in empathy competence was not supported by mediation modelling when FSIQ was controlled. As predicted, the EP group showed weaker empathic development relative to typically developing children. They also showed poorer attentional abilities. However, the effect of preterm birth on empathy was not mediated by executive-level attention. The cognitive mechanisms underpinning poor empathy competence in EP children remain unclear. Future research needs to examine the role of inhibition, social–emotional recognition, and regulation...|$|R
