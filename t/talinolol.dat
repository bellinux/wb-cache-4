40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Surfactants used in {{pharmaceutical}} formulations can modulate drug absorption {{by multiple}} mechanisms including inhibition of intestinal P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Our {{objective was to}} analyze the effect of 2 surfactants with different affinity for P-gp in vitro on the intestinal absorption and bioavailability of the P-gp substrate <b>talinolol</b> in humans. METHODS: In vitro, the influence of surfactants on <b>talinolol</b> permeability was studied in Caco- 2 cells. In vivo, an open-label 3 -way crossover study with 9 healthy male volunteers was performed. Subjects were intubated with a 1 -lumen nasogastrointestinal tube. The study solution, containing either <b>talinolol</b> (50 mg), <b>talinolol</b> and D-alpha-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS) (0. 04 %), or <b>talinolol</b> and Poloxamer 188 (0. 8 %), was administered through the tube. RESULTS: TPGS, but not Poloxamer 188, inhibited the P-gp-mediated <b>talinolol</b> transport in Caco- 2 cells. In healthy volunteers TPGS increased the area under the plasma concentration-time curve with extrapolation to infinity (AUC 0 -infinity) of <b>talinolol</b> by 39 % (90 % confidence interval, 1. 10 - 1. 75) and the maximum plasma concentration (C max) by 100 % (90 % confidence interval, 1. 39 - 2. 88). Poloxamer 188 did not significantly alter the AUC 0 -infinity or C max of <b>talinolol.</b> CONCLUSIONS: This in vivo intraduodenal perfusion study showed that low concentrations of TPGS, close to the concentrations that showed P-gp inhibition in vitro, significantly increased the bioavailability of <b>talinolol.</b> The study design excluded modulation of solubility by TPGS and unspecific surfactant-related effects. The latter {{was supported by the}} absence of modulation of the <b>talinolol</b> pharmacokinetics by Poloxamer 188, which does not modulate P-gp. Therefore we consider intestinal P-gp inhibition by TPGS as the major underlying mechanism for the increase in <b>talinolol</b> bioavailability...|$|E
40|$|Bioavailability of <b>talinolol,</b> a 1 -adrenergic {{receptor}} antagonist, was {{enhanced by}} coadministration with grapefruit juice (GFJ) in rats, whereas GFJ ingestion markedly reduced {{the absorption of}} <b>talinolol</b> in humans. Because our recent study indicated that the inhibitory effect of GFJ on organic anion-transporting polypeptide (Oatp) - and P-gp-mediated <b>talinolol</b> absorption de-pends on the concentration of naringin in ingested GFJ, the apparent inconsistent findings {{may be explained by}} the species difference in the affinity of naringin for OATP/Oatp and P-gp multidrug resistance 1 (MDR 1 /Mdr 1) between humans and rats. Although human MDR 1 -mediated <b>talinolol</b> transport was not inhibited by 2000 M naringin, naringin inhibited human OATP 1 A 2 -, rat Oatp 1 a 5 -, and rat Mdr 1 a-mediated <b>talinolol</b> transport with IC 50 values of 343, 12. 7, and 604 M, respec...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Efflux {{transporters}} like MDR 1 and MRP 2 may modulate the pharmacokinetics {{of about}} 50  % of all drugs. It is currently unknown {{how much of}} the variation in the activities of important drug membrane transporters like MDR 1 or MRP 2 is determined by genetic or by environmental factors. In this study we assessed the heritability of the pharmacokinetics of <b>talinolol</b> as a putative probe drug for MDR 1 and possibly other membrane transporters. Methods <b>Talinolol</b> pharmacokinetics were investigated in a repeated dose study in 42 monozygotic and 13 same-sex dizygotic twin pairs. The oral clearance of <b>talinolol</b> was predefined as the primary parameter. Heritability was analyzed by structural equation modeling and by within- and between-subject variance and <b>talinolol</b> clearance was correlated with polymorphisms in MDR 1, MRP 2, BCRP, MDR 5, OATP 1 B 1, and OCT 1. Results <b>Talinolol</b> clearance varied approximately ninefold in the studied sample of healthy volunteers. The correlation of clearances between siblings was not significantly different for the monozygotic and dizygotic pairs. All data analyses consistently showed that variation of <b>talinolol</b> pharmacokinetics was mainly determined by environmental effects. Structural equation modeling attributed 53. 5  % of the variation of oral clearance to common environmental effects influencing both siblings to the same extent and 46. 5  % to unique environmental effects randomly affecting individual subjects. <b>Talinolol</b> pharmacokinetics were significantly dependent on sex, body mass index, total protein consumption, and vegetable consumption. Conclusions The twin study revealed that environmental factors explained much more of the variation in pharmacokinetics of <b>talinolol</b> than genetic factors.

The enantiomer affinity pattern of <b>talinolol</b> toward these two CDs was opposite in both aqueous and non-aqueous CE. However, the enantiomer affinity pattern {{for a given}} CD derivative did not change when aqueous buffer was replaced with non-aqueous background electrolyte. The structures of the analyte-selector complexes in both, aqueous and non-aqueous electrolytes were studied using rotating frame nuclear Overhauser effect (ROESY) NMR spectroscopy.

Unter den verschiedenen Zellkultur-Modellen gilt die Caco- 2 -Zelllinie als das aussichtsreichste System, um das intestinale Epithel zu simulieren. Das Caco- 2 /TC- 7 -Zellmodell wird im Rahmen dieser Arbeit eingesetzt um die Stereoselektivität der Resorption von Ofloxacin und <b>Talinolol</b> zu untersuchen. In der vorliegenden Arbeit wurden analytische Methoden mittels der Kapillarelektrophorese zur Bestimmung von Propranolol, die Enantiomeren von Ibuprofen, Ofloxacin und <b>Talinolol</b> aufgebaut. Enantiomeren-Trennung verschiedener ?-Blocker konnte auch erzielt werden. Darüber hinaus wurden die Methoden so verfeinert, dass Bestimmungen in der ng/ml Bereich möglich geworden sind. Die vorliegende Arbeit zeigt Übereinstimmungen hinsichtlich der Permeationskoeffizienten von Fluorescein-Na, Propranolol und Ibuprofen mit Literaturangaben und damit die Eignung des Caco- 2 /TC- 7 -Zellmodells für die Untersuchung der Absorption passiv permeierender Substanzen. Keinen Unterschied in der Sekretion zwischen L- und DOfloxacin am Caco- 2 /TC 7 -Zellmodell konnte festgestellt werden. Ofloxacin wird, wie in der Literatur beschrieben, stereoselektiv metabolisiert, somit ist die beobachtete Stereoselektivität eher auf den Metabolismus als auf die Sekretion zurückzuführen. Die Ergebnisse der Resorptionsuntersuchungen von <b>Talinolol</b> am Caco- 2 /TC- 7 -Zellmodell ergaben keine Sekretionsunterschiede der Talinolol-Enantiomeren und damit keine stereoselektive Diskriminierung. Eine stereoselektive Metabolisierung von <b>Talinolol</b> in der Darmwand ist bekannt und in der Literatur beschrieben. Die Arbeit zeigt deutlich, dass der Transport von <b>Talinolol</b> und Ofloxacin stereounspezifisch in Caco 2 /TC 7 Zellen verläuft. Die in der Literatur beschriebene Stereoselektivität ist eher auf den Metabolismus als auf die Sekretion durch P-gp-Transporter zurückzuführen. At recent time in vitro models always find {{accommodation}} and used {{more and more}} for the examination of transport and transport mechanisms. The Caco- 2 cell line {{is regarded as the}} most promising system under the different cell culture models to simulate the intestinale Epithelia. In this work the Caco- 2 /TC- 7 cell model is used as biological barriers to examine the stereoselectivity of the transport of ofloxacin and <b>talinolol.</b> Another part of this work deals with developments of new analytical methods using capillary electrophoresis for the determination of propranolol, the enantiomers of ibuprofen, ofloxacin and <b>talinolol.</b> In addition to stereoselective separation from <b>talinolol,</b> ofloxacin and ibuprofen, enantioseparation of different beta-blockers was obtained. Furthermore the methods were refined so that determination was possible in the ng/ml range. With regard to the permeability coefficients of passively permeated substances such as fluorescein-Na, propranolol and ibuprofen and the Caco- 2 /TC- 7 cell model here used is very suitable for the examination of the absorption for passively permeated substances. As a result of the experiments with ofloxacin, no difference could be detected in the secretion between L- and D-ofloxacin using the Caco- 2 /TC- 7 cell model. A stereoselective metabolism was described for ofloxacin by other workers. In the case of <b>talinolol,</b> a stereoselective secretion could be excluded. This results is very good in agreement with its of other workers, which proved that the differences of <b>talinolol</b> enantiomers is the reason of intestinal metabolic degradation rather than of <b>talinolol</b> transport by P-gp transporters. The enzyme involved in metabolic degradation of <b>talinolol</b> is CYP 3 A 4, which don't expressed in the caco- 2 /TC- 7 here used.

Vysotsky Blockade of kidneys’  1 -adrenoceptors with <b>talinolol</b> entailed in anesthetized rats a sodium-uretic {{response}} {{accompanied by}} inhibition of sodium reabsorption {{and an increase}} of the blood flow in cortical and external layers. Haloperidol prevented the increase of blood flow in the external layer but {{did not affect the}} cortical hemodynamic shift or the depressing influence of <b>talinolol</b> on the channel transport of sodium. The inhibiting agent for the callicrein-kinin system contrical and the inhibiting agent for prostaglandin synthesis indometacin did not alter the kidney response to the drug under study. The hemodynamic shift as well as the inhibition of sodium reabsorption seems to be unrelated either to excitation of receptors sensitive to dopamine, or to activation of the callicrein-kinin system or stimulation of prostaglandin synthesis.

The advanced compartmental absorption and transit (ACAT) model as part of the computer program GastroPlus™ was used to simulate the absorption and pharmacokinetics of valacyclovir, gabapentin, and <b>talinolol.</b> Each of these drugs is a substrate for an influx or efflux transporter and all show nonlinear dose dependence within the normal therapeutic range. These simulations incorporated the experimentally derived gastrointestinal distributions of transporter expression levels for oligopeptide transporters PepT 1 and HPT 1 (valacyclovir); System L-amino acid transporter LAT 2 and organic cation transporter OCTN 1 (gabapentin); and organic anion transporter (OATP 1 A 2) and P-glycoprotein (<b>talinolol).</b> By assuming a uniform distribution of oligopeptide transporter and by application of the in vitro Km value for valacyclovir, the simulations accurately reproduced the experimental nonlinear dose dependence. For gabapentin, LAT 2 distribution produced simulation results that were much more accurate than OCTN 1 distributions. For <b>talinolol,</b> an influx transporter distribution for OATP 1 A 2 and the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein distributed with increasing expression in the distal small intestine produced the best results. The physiological characteristics of the small and large intestines used in the ACAT model were able to accurately account for the positional and temporal changes in concentration and carrier-mediated transport of the three drugs included in this study.

Using the Caco- 2 system, polarity in transport of <b>talinolol</b> could be observed, the absorptive transport being {{much lower than the}} secretory transport (P(app-abs) = 1. 08 +/- 0. 29 x 10 (- 6) cm/s and P(app-secr) = 11. 74 +/- 0. 80 x 10 (- 6) cm/s). Inclusion of apricot extract (1 %) in the apical medium resulted in a statistically significantly diminished polarity (P(app-abs) = 4. 88 +/- 0. 96 x 10 (- 6) cm/s and P(app-secr) = 9. 39 +/- 0. 58 x 10 (- 6) cm/s, p < 0. 05). In addition, the inhibitory effect of apricot extract on P-gp related efflux mechanisms was shown to be concentration (0 % approximately 0. 1 % < 0. 3 % < 1 %) and pH dependent. Experiments performed with the Ussing chambers resulted in similar observations. In the rat in situ perfusion model, inclusion of apricot extract (1 %) in the perfusion medium resulted in a threefold increase of the amount of <b>talinolol</b> appearing in the collected blood compared to the reference condition (23. 6 +/- 5. 53 pmol/cm. min and 7. 13 +/- 1. 08 pmol/cm. min, respectively; p < 0. 05). Coadministration of this standardized apricot extract might be a safe and useful strategy to enhance the intestinal absorption of P-gp substrates.

The {{influence of the}} nature of substituents (methyl or acetyl) in positions 2 and 3 on the CD derivatives and of the electrophoretic medium (water or methanol) on the enantioselectivity and enantiomer affinity pattern (EAP) of these structurally related compounds was systematically studied.

In general, lower affinity and enantioselectivity were obtained in the presence of HDMS-beta-CD compared to HDAS-beta-CD. Reversals of EAPs were observed for all compounds. EAPs toward these two CDs were found to be opposite to each other in NACE for all compounds except carvedilol and in aqueous CE for atenolol, carteolol, <b>talinolol,</b> and sotalol. It is particularly noteworthy that opposite EAPs were also observed using the same CD derivative when the aqueous BGE was replaced with the methanolic one: for carazolol, carvedilol, and propranolol in the presence of HDMS-beta-CD and for acebutolol and carvedilol with HDAS-beta-CD.

CsA is commonly used as a substrate for P-gp-related efflux carriers and {{is characterized by a}} polarity in transport, the absorptive transport being much lowerthan the secretorytransport (polarityfactor: PF approximately 7). Of the 68 tested, nine extracts showed a decreased efflux of CsA (< 75 % of the reference value) and were retained for further experiments on the bidirectional transport of CsA across Caco- 2 monolayers. Results of these experiments showed that strawberry, orange, apricot and mint extract exert an inhibitory effect on intestinal P-gp-related functionality (PF < 4. 2). The effect of apricot extract was also studied on the bidirectional transport of <b>talinolol,</b> a specific P-gp substrate; inclusion of 1 %, v/v, in the apical compartment of Caco- 2 monolayers resulted in a significantly reduced polarity in the transport of <b>talinolol</b> (PF reference = 15. 5; PF in the presence of apricot extract = 2. 5). This study suggests that co-administration of fruit extracts might be a conceptually safe and useful strategy to enhance the intestinal absorption of P-gp substrates.

40|$|An {{approach}} has been developed for drug metabolism studies of non-radiolabeled compounds using on-line liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) combined with chip-based infusion following fraction collection. The potential of this approach, which improves the data quality compared with only LC/MS analysis, has been investigated {{for the analysis of}} in vitro metabolites of tolcapone and <b>talinolol,</b> two compounds with well-characterized metabolism. The information-dependent LC/MS/MS analysis enables the characterization of the major metabolites while the chip-based infusion is used to obtain good product ion spectra for lower level metabolites, to generate complementary MS information on potential metabolites detected in the LC/MS trace, or to screen for unexpected metabolites. Fractions from the chromatographic analysis are collected in 20 second steps, into a 96 -well plate. The fractions of interest can be re-analyzed with chip-based infusion on a variety of mass spectrometers including triple quadrupole linear ion trap (QqLIT or Q TRAP) and QqTOF systems. Acquiring data for several minutes using multi-channel acquisition (MCA), or signal averaging while infusing the fractions at approximately 200 nL/min, permits about a 50 times gain in sensitivity (signal-to-noise) in MS/MS mode. A 5 - 10 microL sample fraction can be infused for more than 30 min allowing the time to perform various MS experiments such as MS(n), precursor ion or neutral loss scans and accurate mass measurement, all in either positive or negative mode. Through fraction collection and infusion, a significant gain in data quality is obtained along with a time-saving benefit, because the original sample needs neither to be re-analyzed by re-injection nor to be pre-concentrated.

40|$|Although, {{pulmonary}} {{drug delivery}} {{is a well}} established means for targeting of drugs to the lungs {{for the treatment of}} respiratory diseases {{as well as for the}} systemic delivery of volatile anesthetic agents, drug absorption kinetics in the lung have not been subjected to extensive research. The main objective of this thesis was to investigate drug absorption characteristics of the lung barrier, using the isolated and perfused rat lung model and in vivo pharmacokinetic studies in rats. Physicochemically diverse drugs (i. e. atenolol, budesonide, cromolyn, cyanocobalamin, enalapril, enalaprilate, formoterol, imipramine, losartan, metoprolol, propranolol, <b>talinolol,</b> terbutaline, and the tetrapeptide TArPP) were used as model compounds. In connection to these investigations, a nebulization catheter device was successfully adapted and evaluated as a new technique for delivery of defined aerosol doses to the rat lung. In addition, a physicochemical profile of the inhaled drugs on the market worldwide during 2001 was made. The pulmonary first-order absorption rate constant and bioavailability were found to correlate to the drug lipophilicity, the molecular polar surface area, and the apparent permeability of Caco- 2 cell monolayers. In contrast to the intestinal mucosa and the blood-brain barrier, the pulmonary epithelium was highly permeable to drugs with a high molecular polar surface area. Accordingly, a small hydrophilic tetrapeptide (oral bioavailability ~ 0. 5 %) showed a complete bioavailability after pulmonary delivery to rats in vivo. Regional differences in bioavailability, absorption rate, and first-pass metabolism of the peptide was demonstrated after targeted delivery to different regions of the respiratory tract in rats in vivo. The high pulmonary bioavailability of the efflux transporter substrates losartan and <b>talinolol</b> provides functional evidence for an insignificant role of efflux transporters such as P-glycoprotein in limiting the absorption of these drugs from the rat lung. The results of this thesis demonstrate that the lung efficiently absorbs drugs with a wide range of lipophilicity.

Cells were grown in ThinCertTM tissue culture inserts in 12 -well Cellstar® cell culture plates. The membrane consisted of transparent polyethylene terephthalate (3 µm pores) and was coated with collagen. The cell number was determined using a Bürker chamber and 1 - 1. 3 * 106 cells were plated in each ThinCertTM. Cell viability was assessed by trypan blue exclusion. Five days after plating, HNEC formed microscopically confluent layers. Transport experiments were performed on day 10 or 11. Transport was assessed for 3 compounds: atenolol (paracellular transport), <b>talinolol</b> (P-glycoprotein substrate) and propranolol (transcellular transport). Concentrations were determined by HPLC (fluorescence detection). Data for CBF calculation were collected using an inverted microscope coupled with a high-speed digital camera; 1054 images were captured during 2 seconds. CBF values were determined for each pixel site separately by spectral analysis of the variation of the pixel intensity over time. Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) {{was applied to the}} intensity signal and CBF was computed as the frequency corresponding to the maximal FFT amplitude value in the range from 0 to 20 Hz. Viability of cells obtained by enzymatic dissociation from nasal biopsies ranged from 91. 8 % to 97. 1 %. Transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) increased as a function of time in culture and reached a plateau level after 7 - 9 days. Transport inserts with TEER values over the cell layer below 600 &[Omega]. cm 2 were excluded from transport experiments. Absorptive apparent permeability coefficient (Papp) values amounted to 0. 3 ± 0. 2, 0. 6 ± 0. 2 and 16 ± 5 x 10 - 6 cm/s for atenolol, <b>talinolol</b> and propranolol, respectively, illustrating the ability of the system to discriminate between compounds with different transport properties. No statistically significant differences in CBF could be observed when measuring CBF at defined days in culture. Inclusion of chlorocresol (0. 01 %) decreased CBF (to 55 %), but did not alter transport. For the first time, a system was developed in which the effect of compounds on CBF could be followed simultaneously with transport through the HNEC layer.

40|$|Absorption {{of drugs}} from the {{gastrointestinal}} tract {{is a complex}} process the variability of which is influenced by many physicochemical and physiologic factors. The two most important physicochemical factors that affect both the extent {{and the rate of}} absorption are lipophilicity and solubility. The rate and extent of absorption are governed by the solubility, permeability and stability of the drug, with solubility being a pH-dependent parameter for weak acids and bases. The gastrointestinal tract can be viewed as discrete sections with a variety of differential local pH environments ranging from the acidic stomach to the more basic small intestine. The multiple peaking, double peaking or secondary peaking phenomena can occur in the disposition of a variety of xenobiotics during drug development (the pre-clinical phase) and in subsequent clinical studies and use.

Average equilibrium solubility values for 10 poorly soluble compounds in HIF aspirated from both age groups showed high interindividual variability, but did not reveal significant differences. Characterization of the HIF from both age groups demonstrated compa- rable pH profiles, while concentrations of individual bile salts showed pronounced variability between individuals, however without statistical differences between age groups. Transepithelial permeation of the transcellular probe metoprolol was significantly increased in old rats (38 weeks) compared to the younger age groups, while the modulatory role of P-glycoprotein in transepithelial <b>talinolol</b> transport was observed in adult and old rats but not in young rats.

Compared to classical electrospray liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/ESI-MS) method development, with MALDI-MRM the tuning of the analyte in single MS mode is more challenging due to interfering matrix background ions. An approach is proposed using background subtraction. With LLE and using a 200 microL human plasma aliquot acceptable precision and accuracy could be obtained {{in the range of}} 1 to 1000 ng/mL without any LC separation. Approximately 3 s were required for one analysis. A full calibration curve and its quality control samples (20 samples) can be analyzed within 1 min. Combining LC with the MALDI analysis allowed improving the linearity down to 50 pg/mL, while reducing the throughput potential only by two-fold. Matrix effects are still a significant issue with MALDI but can be monitored in a similar way to that used for LC/ESI-MS analysis...|$|E
40|$|Every {{year the}} number of β-blockers on the {{pharmaceutical}} market is increasing, requiring systematization of their standardization methods. Aim of research. The aim of our research is to study literature data about identification and assay methods of β-blockers with different direction of action – selective (praktolol, metoprolol, atenolol, acebutolol, betaxolol, bevantolol, bisoprolol, celiprolol, esmolol, epanolol, esatenolol, nebivolol, <b>Talinolol),</b> non-selective (alprenolol, Oxprenololum, pindolol, propranolol, timolol, sotalol, nadolol, mepindolol, karteol, tertatolol, bopindolol, bupranolol, penbutolol, kloranolol) and combined (labetalol, carvedilol). Methods. The analytical review of literature sources about β-blockers analysis by physical, chemical, and physicochemical methods. Results. After literature sources’ analyzing {{it was found that}} physical and physicochemical constants are basically used for β-blockers pharmacopoeial analysis; both physicochemical values and chemical reactions are used in forensic analysis, resulting in the article. It was founded that titration methods, mostly acid-base titration method, are used for β-blockers assay in the analysis of substances. For β-blockers detection in biological fluids and dosage forms, active pharmaceutical ingredients and metabolites mixture separation one should prefer physicochemical methods, such as gas chromatography and liquid chromatography, absorption UV-Visible spectroscopy, fluorometry, etc. Conclusion. The results have shown can be used for the further search of the identification and assay optimal methods of β-blockers both pure and mixed with other active substances and excipients</p...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of zinc finger nuclease (ZFN) technology has enabled the genetic engineering {{of the rat}} genome. The ability to manipulate the rat genome has great promise to augment the utility of rats for biological and pharmacological studies. A Wistar Hannover rat model lacking the multidrug resistance protein Mdr 1 a P-glycoprotein (P-gp) was generated using a rat Mdr 1 a-specific ZFN. Mdr 1 a was completely absent in tissues, including brain and small intestine, of the knockout rat. Phar-macokinetic studies with the Mdr 1 a P-gp substrates lopera-mide, indinavir, and <b>talinolol</b> indicated that Mdr 1 a was function-ally inactive in the blood-brain barrier and intestine in Mdr 1 a(/) rats. To identify possible compensatory mecha-nisms in Mdr 1 a(/) rats, the expression levels of drug-me-tabolizing enzyme and transporter-related genes were com-pared in brain, liver, kidney, and intestine {{of male and female}} Mdr 1 a(/) and control rats. In general, alterations in gene expression of these genes in Mdr 1 a(/) rats seemed to be modest, with more changes in female than in male rats.

40|$|To {{study the}} {{potential}} interactions of naringin (NAR), <b>talinolol</b> (TAL) and protein-energy undernutrition (PEU) in the absorption process of saquinavir (SQV), perfusion experiments were {{performed in the}} small intestine of rats at different SQV concentrations. The results obtained demonstrated that SQV intestinal absorption was described by simultaneous passive diffusion (k(dif) = 3. 44 hr) and saturable absorption (V(ma) = 127. 31 mu M/hr; K(ma) = 10. 50 mu M) together with a capacity-limited efflux (V(ms) = 270. 53 mu M/hr; K(ms) = 23. 44 mu M). The competitive inhibition constants of NAR on the SQV input and efflux processes were [IC(50) ](a) = 3. 98 mu M and [IC(50) ](s) = 5. 00 mu M, respectively. NAR significantly decreased (23 - 29 %; p < 0. 05) or kept unaltered the absorption rate constant (k(a)) of SQV in function of the concentration of both compounds administered. Finally, SQV k(a) significantly increased in PEU status (around 1. 8 times) when the drug was perfused either in the presence (p < 0. 05) or in the absence (p < 0. 01) of NAR. The variations of SQV k(a) when the antiretroviral drug is co-administered with NAR and/or TAL reinforce their interaction in the absorptive process. Malnutrition may result in altered SQV absorption, and further studies are strongly recommended to analyse {{the impact of this}} finding on the pharmacokinetic drug profile...|$|E
40|$|A {{specific}} LC-MS/MS assay {{was developed}} for the automated determination of <b>talinolol</b> in human plasma, using on-line solid phase extraction system (prospekt 2) combined with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) tandem mass spectrometry. The method involved simple precipitation of plasma proteins with perchloric acid (contained propranolol) as the internal standard (IS) and injection of the supernatant onto a C 8 End Capped (10 mmx 2 mm) cartridge without any evaporation step. Using the back-flush mode, the analytes were transferred onto an analytical column (XTerra C 18, 50 mmx 4. 6 mm) for chromatographic separation and mass spectrometry detection. One of the particularities of the assay is that the SPE cartridge {{is used as a}} column switching device and not as an SPE cartridge. Therefore, the same SPE cartridge could be used more than 28 times, significantly reducing the analysis cost. APCI ionization was selected to overcome any potential matrix suppression effects because the analyte and IS co-eluted. The mean precision and accuracy in the concentration range 2. 5 - 200 ng/mL was found to be 103 % and 7. 4 %, respectively. The data was assessed from QC samples during the validation phase of the assay. The lower limit of quantification was 2. 5 ng/mL, using a 250 microL plasma aliquot. The LC-MS/MS method provided the requisite selectivity, sensitivity, robustness accuracy and precision to assess pharmacokinetics of the compound in several hundred human plasma samples...|$|E
40|$|Inhibition of P-glycoprotein (PGP) {{resulting}} from the co-administration of substrate drugs represents a potential source of drug–drug interactions. Although in vitro screens can readily identify such interactions, the accuracy with which they mimic interactions in tissues or their value in predicting interactions in vivo is unresolved. This was addressed for the model PGP substrate digoxin by comparing the modulation of its permeability across Caco- 2 cells and ex vivo human and rodent intestine by drugs for which pharmacokinetic data on interactions with digoxin in man is available. All five compounds (<b>talinolol,</b> omeprazole, verapamil, quinidine, cyclosporin) dose-dependently increased absorptive (A–B) digoxin permeability with maximal increases of 2. 2 – 4. 5 -fold across Caco- 2. Quantitatively similar increases were observed in ex vivo human and mouse intestine and studies in mdr 1 a(−/−) intestine confirmed that these interactions are mediated solely by PGP. In vitro changes in digoxin permeability were qualitative indicators {{of the increase in}} digoxin Cmax for these compounds in man, although accounting for the luminal drug concentrations expected for a given oral dose was a critical consideration. Based on a limited dataset these data suggest that Caco- 2 accurately mimics intestinal digoxin interactions and may be useful in predicting the threshold dose at which interactions become clinically significant. Further studies across a wider range of drugs are needed to determine the broader applicability of in vitro data for quantitative prediction of clinical drug interactions...|$|E
40|$|Presently, the Caco- 2 {{cell culture}} model {{is widely used}} during drug {{discovery}} and development as a predictive tool for the oral absorption of drug candidates. For transport experiments in the Caco- 2 system, HBSS-like buffered salt solutions are commonly used, although different shortcomings {{have been associated with}} the use of these buffers. In this paper, we investigated the effect of using fasted state simulated intestinal fluid (FaSSIF) as potential biorelevant medium for the drug permeability estimation across Caco- 2 monolayers. The transport characteristics of 19 model compounds were determined in the Caco- 2 cell culture model in the presence of FaSSIF as compared to classic transport medium. A sigmoidal relation was obtained when the estimated P(app), s of the apical to basolateral transport were plotted versus the reported values of the fraction absorbed in man. Although no effect of FaSSIF as compared to classic transport medium (TM) was observed on the total predictability of the model, an impact was demonstrated (1) on the bi-directional transport of actively transported drugs (including <b>talinolol,</b> digoxin and doxorubicin), (2) on recovery and (3) on the solubility and permeability estimation of poorly water-soluble drugs. The observed differences may be attributed to a P-gp inhibitory effect of sodium taurocholate (NaTC), micellar encapsulation by the NaTC/lecithin mixed micelles and/or an increase of the solubility of lipophilic drugs. As the experimental conditions should mimic the physiological in vivo conditions, the use of FaSSIF as medium during Caco- 2 experiments may improve the biorelevance of the model. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|A {{new type}} of {{interaction}} in which fruit juices diminish oral drug bioavailability through inhibition of uptake transport {{is the focus of}} this review. The discovery was based on an opposite to anticipated finding when assessing the possibility of grapefruit juice increasing oral fexofenadine bioavailability in humans through inhibition of intestinal MDR 1 -mediated efflux transport. In follow-up investigations, grapefruit or orange juice at low concentrations potentially and selectively inhibited in vitro OATP 1 A 2 -mediated uptake compared with MDR 1 -caused efflux substrate transport. These juices at high volume dramatically depressed oral fexofenadine bioavailability. Grapefruit was the representative juice to characterize the interaction subsequently. A volume–effect relationship study using a normal juice amount halved average fexofenadine absorption. Individual variability and reproducibility data indicated the clinical interaction involved direct inhibition of intestinal OATP 1 A 2. Naringin was a major causal component suggesting that other flavonoids in fruits and vegetables might also produce the effect. Duration of juice clinical inhibition of fexofenadine absorption lasted more than 2 h but less than 4 h indicating the interaction was avoidable with appropriate interval of time between juice and drug consumption. Grapefruit juice lowered the oral bioavailability of several medications transported by OATP 1 A 2 (acebutolol, celiprolol, fexofenadine, <b>talinolol,</b> L-thyroxine) while orange juice did the same for others (atenolol, celiprolol, ciprofloxacin, fexofenadine). Juice clinical inhibition of OATP 2 B 1 was unresolved while that of OATP 1 B 1 seemed unlikely. The interaction between grapefruit juice and etoposide also seemed relevant. Knowledge of both affected uptake transporter and drug hydrophilicity assisted prediction of the clinical interaction with grapefruit or orange juice...|$|E
40|$|The {{concomitant}} use {{of herbal}} medicines and pharmacotherapy is wide spread. We have reviewed the literature {{to determine the}} possible interactions between seven popular herbal medicines (ginkgo, St Johns wort, ginseng, garlic, echinacea, saw palmetto and kava) and conventional drugs. Literature searches were performed using MEDLINE, Cochrane Library and EMBASE and we identified 128 case reports or case series, and 80 clinical trials. Clinical trials indicate that St Johns wort (Hypericum perforatum), via cytochrome P 450 (CYP) andor P-glycoprotein induction, reduces the plasma concentrations (andor increases the clearance) of alprazolam, amitriptyline, atorvastatin, chlorzoxazone, ciclosporin, debrisoquine, digoxin, erythromycin, fexofenadine, gliclazide, imatinib, indinavir, irinotecan, ivabradine, mephenytoin, methadone, midazolam, nifedipine, omeprazole, oral contraceptives, quazepam, simvastatin, tacrolimus, <b>talinolol,</b> verapamil, voriconazole and warfarin. Case reports or case series suggest interactions of St Johns wort with adrenergic vasopressors, anaesthetics, bupropion, buspirone, ciclosporin, eletriptan, loperamide, nefazodone, nevirapine, oral contraceptives, paroxetine, phenprocoumon, prednisone, sertraline, tacrolimus, theophylline, tibolone, tryptophan, venlafaxine and warfarin. Ginkgo (Ginkgo biloba) decreases the plasma concentrations of omeprazole, ritonavir and tolbutamide. Clinical cases indicate interactions of ginkgo with antiepileptics, aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), diuretics, ibuprofen, risperidone, rofecoxib, trazodone and warfarin. Ginseng (Panax ginseng) may interact with phenelzine and warfarin. Kava (Piper methysticum) increases the clearance of chlorzoxazone (a CYP 2 E 1 substrate) and may interact with alprazolam, levodopa and paroxetine. Garlic (Allium sativum) interacts with chlorpropamide, fluindione, ritonavir and warfarin; it also reduces plasma concentrations of chlorzoxazone (a CYP 2 E 1 probe). Echinacea might affect the clearance of caffeine (a CYP 1 A 2 probe) and midazolam (a CYP 3 A 4 probe). No interactions have been reported for saw palmetto (Serenoa repens). Numerous interactions between herbal medicines and conventional drugs have been documented.

40|$|St. John&# 039;s wort (Hypericum perforatum, SJW) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} used herbal antidepressants for the treatment of minor to moderate depression. A major safety concern about SJW is its ability to alter the pharmacokinetics and/or clinical response of a variety of clinically important drugs that have distinctive chemical structure, mechanism of action and metabolic pathways. This review highlights and updates the knowledge on clinical interactions of prescribed drugs with SJW and the implication in drug development. A number of clinically significant interactions of SJW have been identified with conventional drugs, including anticancer agents (imatinib and irinotecan), anti-HIV agents (e. g. indinavir, lamivudine and nevirapine), anti-inflammatory agents (e. g. ibuprofen and fexofenadine), antimicrobial agents (e. g. erythromycin and voriconazole), cardiovascular drugs (e. g. digoxin, ivabradine, warfarin, verapamil, nifedipine and <b>talinolol),</b> central nervous system agents (e. g. amitriptyline, buspirone, phenytoin, methadone, midazolam, alprazolam, and sertraline), hypoglycaemic agents (e. g. tolbutamide and gliclazide), immuno-modulating agents (e. g. cyclosporine and tacrolimus), oral contraceptives, proton pump inhibitor (e. g. omeprazole), respiratory system agent (e. g. theophylline), statins (e. g. atorvastatin and pravastatin). Both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic components may play a role in the interactions of drugs with SJW. For pharmacokinetic changes of drugs by SJW, induction of cytochrome P 450 s (e. g. CYP 2 C 9 and 3 A 4) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) are considered the major mechanism. Thus, it is not a surprise that many drugs that interact with SJW are substrates of CYP 3 A 4, CYP 2 C 9 and P-gp. A comprehensive understanding of clinical drugs that interact with SJW has important implications in drug development. New drugs may be designed to minimize interactions with SJW; and new SJW formulations may be designed to avoid drug interactions. Further clinical and mechanistic studies are warranted to explore the interaction of SJW with other important drugs and the potential clinical impact...|$|E
40|$|To summarise, it can {{be stated}} that many psychotropic {{substances}} or drugs {{were used in the}} field of dentistry in East Germany (GDR). During the 1950 s the most commonly used psychotropic drugs used in dentistry in the GDR were herbal medizines, bromides, and bromid-urea derivatives, methyl pentinol Pentinol®), aconitine, caffeine, codeine, reserpine, numerous barbituric acid derivatives Lepinal® and Kalypnon®, the guaiacol glycerine ether Neuroton®, the benactyzine product Procalm®, the hydantoin derivatives Phenytoin AWD and Lepitoin® and in particular, the phenothiazine derivatives Propaphenin® (chlorpromazine) and Prothazin® (promethazine). The centrally acting analgesics Dolcontral® (pethidine) and Morphinum hydrochloricum AWD were used on in-patients, rarely on out-patients. The primary fields of indication in which psychotropic substances were administered were premedication, anxiolysis, postmedication, pain therapy, trigeminal neuralgia therapy, prophylaxis and treatment of incidents, as well as some forms of craniomandibular dysfunction. In the 1950 s premedication and anxiolysis did not yet enjoy the status they do today. In the 1960 s the first minor tranquilizers manufactured in the GDR – Meprobamat (1961) as well as the benzodiazepine derivatives Timosin® (chlordiazepoxide 1967), Faustan® (diazepam 1968) and Radedorm® (nitrazepam 1969) – came onto the pharmaceuticals market and were successfully applied for their respective purposes in nearly all fields of indication in dentistry. The minor tranquilizer Radepur® (previously Timosin®) and, in particular, Faustan® proved to be the treatment of choice in the spheres of premedication, anxiolysis, prophylaxis and treatment of incidents. In the early 1970 s the minor tranquilizer Rudotel® (medazepam 1973) and the antiepileptic agent Finlepsin® (carbamazepine 1974) came onto the pharmaceuticals market in the GDR. The non-cardioselective beta-blocker Obsidan® (propranolol 1969) and the cardioselective beta-blocker Cordanum® (<b>talinolol</b> 1976) displayed excellent effectiveness, especially in the premedication, anxiolysis, prophylaxis and treatment of certain cardiovascular diseases, but they did not succeed in becoming permanently established in the sphere of anxiolysis and premedication in dentistry. In the 1980 s there were not outstanding developments and changes as regards the application of psychotropic substances in dentistry. The broadest range of applications was that of the group of minor tranquilizers from the benzodiazepine class of drugs. All neuropsychotropic drugs in the GDR were available only on prescription. The centrally acting analgesics such as Dolcontral® and Morphinum hydrocloricum AWD were subject to the Narcotics Act. The benzodiazepines are currently still the medications of choice for anxiolysis and premedication in dentistry...|$|E
40|$|Novel {{in vitro}} and in vivo model systems to study intravaginal {{microbicide}} uptakeAnti-HIV microbicides are compounds that are vaginally or rectally administered prior to intercourse to prevent viral transmission. In {{the search for}} an effective product, insufficient drug permeation across the vaginal mucosa may cause failed protection in case of microbicides that are active {{at the level of}} the HIV host cells, which are mainly localized in the lamina propria. To evaluate the tissue penetration ability of vaginally applied drugs, we established a simple in vitro set up, consisting of an apical and basal chamber that are separated by a layer of HEC- 1 A cells. This procedure was validated by means of the model microbicides tenofovir, darunavir, saquinavir and dapivirine. The compounds solubility and tissue permeability were identified as key determinants for vaginal uptake. Saquinavir and dapivirine permeation across HEC- 1 A was low because of poor permeability and solubility, respectively. In contrast, tenofovir showed the highest transport attributable to its good aqueous solubility. In addition, the impact of formulation factors on the permeation potential was investigated. The inclusion of solubilizing cyclodextrins or polyethylene glycol resulted in an enhanced permeation of the hydrophobic compound dapivirine. An excipient-induced reduction in the permeability may however counteract the solubilizing effect, as demonstrated for the emulsion formulation of darunavir. The optimization of drug uptake by inclusion of formulation excipients must take into account this delicate balance. In a next step, the described in vitro approach was applied for the biopharmaceutical assessment of the diaryltriazine compound series which resulted in the selection of UAMC 01398 as the lead microbicide candidate, owing to its relatively high aqueous solubility in addition to its beneficial safety and activity profile. Two stable and safe aqueous-based gel formulations were identified for UAMC 01398 including a non-solubilizing gel and a gel containing the solubilizer sulfobutyl ether-ß-cyclodextrin (SBE-ßCD, 5 %); in addition, a film delivery system, consisting of the excipients hydroxypropylmethylcellulose and polyethylene glycol 400 with UAMC 01398 in the amorphous state, was developed. Compared to the non-solubilizing gel, the SBE-ßCD gel and the film formulation increased the UAMC 01398 uptake both in vitro across HEC- 1 A cell layers and in vivo in rabbits. The developed formulations are suitable for the vaginal delivery of UAMC 01398 and allow further in vivo evaluation of the microbicide potential of this compound. The possible use of a supersaturation strategy to overcome solubility issues of hydrophobic microbicides was demonstrated for dapivirine. Despite being in a thermodynamically unstable state, supersaturated dapivirine showed not to precipitate in the formulation vehicle as such and in biorelevant fluids in the presence of several excipients including hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, polyethylene glycol 1000 and cyclodextrins. Dapivirine transport across HEC- 1 A cell layers was higher for supersaturated gels compared to suspension gels. The supersaturated dapivirine (500 µM) gel containing 2. 5 % of SBE-ßCD significantly increased vaginal drug uptake in rabbits compared to a non-solubilizing suspension gel and an SBE-ßCD suspension gel. The supersaturation approach thus allows the formulation of hydrophobic microbicides at concentrations above their solubility, thereby enhancing their vaginal permeation. Vaginal uptake may also be influenced by drug transporters expressed in the vaginal epithelium. We confirmed the protein expression of the efflux transporters Pgp, BCRP and MRP- 2 in endocervical and vaginal tissue of premenopausal women. Several microbicide candidates including darunavir, saquinavir and maraviroc could be categorized as Pgp and MRP- 2 substrates and their disposition may thus be affected by these transporters. The Pgp transporter was observed to significantly reduce the vaginal uptake of the model Pgp substrate <b>talinolol</b> in vivo in rabbits when formulated in a neutral, but not in an acidic gel. Consequently, the expression of efflux transporters may limit the vaginal permeation of their substrates, including certain microbicides. In conclusion, we propose the implementation of in vitro solubility and permeability evaluation, including the assessment of transporter interactions, to estimate the vaginal tissue permeation potential of microbicides prior to progressing into animal or clinical studies. This procedure may contribute to the selection of promising microbicide candidates, as illustrated for the diaryltriazines, and to successful formulation development, as shown for UAMC 01398 and dapivirine. The in vitro drug transport across HEC- 1 A cell layers correlated well with the in vivo vaginal permeation as determined in rabbits. Formulation approaches that install solubilization or supersaturation are indicated to enhance vaginal drug uptake of poorly soluble microbicides. status: publishe...|$|E
