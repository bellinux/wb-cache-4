I still mourn the loss of what could have been, but I also feel deep gratitude for those who stood by me, for the lesson <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>must</b> never be afraid to ask for help, and for the feeling of summer that still remains.|$|E
5|$|In fact, {{building}} a society the Shaftesbury way {{is not a}} matter of imprisoning a presumed evil spirit of mankind. It is a matter of beauty and truth. Both Goethe and Voltaire were influenced by the 3rd Lord Shaftesbury. The former particularly reminded us <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>must</b> cultivate our garden. We all know about large prize-winning marrows, but are not succulent baby courgettes more perfect? Small is beautiful too...|$|E
5|$|Philosopher G. H. R. Parkinson notes {{a common}} {{objection}} to Kant's argument: that {{what ought to}} be done does not necessarily entail that it is possible. He also argues that alternative conceptions of morality exist which do not rely on the assumptions that Kant makes – he cites utilitarianism as an example which does not require the summum bonum. Nicholas Everitt argues that much moral guidance is unattainable, such as the Biblical command to be Christ-like. He proposes that Kant's first two premises only entail <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>must</b> try to achieve the perfect good, not that it is actually attainable.|$|E

5|$|In {{discrete}} tomography, {{a simplified}} {{version of the}} problem that has been frequently studied, the shape to be recovered is a polyomino (a subset of the squares in the two-dimensional square lattice), and the cross-sections provide aggregate information about the sets of squares in individual rows and columns of the lattice. For instance, in the popular nonogram puzzles, also known as paint by numbers or griddlers, the set of squares to be determined represents the dark pixels in a binary image, and the input given to the puzzle solver tells him or her how many consecutive blocks of dark pixels to include in each row or column of the image, and how long each of those blocks should be. In other forms of digital tomography, even less information about each row or column is given: only {{the total number of}} squares, rather than the number and length of the blocks of squares. An equivalent version of the problem is <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>must</b> recover a given 0-1 matrix given only the sums of the values in each row and in each column of the matrix.|$|E
25|$|Martin Luther {{summarized}} the commandment against shedding innocent blood as {{grounded in the}} fear and love of God, and as having {{both positive and negative}} aspects: negative in <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>must</b> neither harm nor hurt our neighbor’s body; positive in <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>must</b> help our neighbor and care for him when he is ill.|$|E

25|$|These two {{concepts}} of infinity and reality {{lie at the}} heart of Unger's program calling for metaphysical and institutional revolutions.

25|$|McLuhan {{believed}} {{that in order}} to grasp fully the effect of a new technology, one must examine figure (medium) and ground (context) together, since neither is completely intelligible without the other. McLuhan argued <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>must</b> study media in their historical context, particularly in relation to the technologies that preceded them. The present environment, itself made up of the effects of previous technologies, gives rise to new technologies, which, in their turn, further affect society and individuals.|$|E
25|$|His first {{consideration}} {{is that the}} existence of God has to be demonstrated philosophically, besides the theological reasons for belief, particularly if we consider to make a demonstration for the non-believers. Moreover, the believers could be accused of making a circular reasoning, when saying <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>must</b> believe in God because of the Scriptures, and in the authority of the Scriptures because they have been inspired by God. He further indicates how the very Scriptures say that the mind of man is sufficient to discover God.|$|E

25|$|Francis says <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>must</b> say “no to a {{financial}} system which rules rather than serves. Behind this attitude lurks {{a rejection of}} ethics and a rejection of God” (EG 57). He calls it “increasingly intolerable that financial markets are shaping the destiny of peoples rather than serving their needs, or that the few derive immense wealth from financial speculation while the many are deeply burdened by the consequences”. He adds that speculation in agricultural commodities is “a scandal which seriously compromises access to food {{on the part of}} the poorest members of our human family”.|$|E
25|$|If the {{immediate}} international situation {{is used as}} an excuse to get us to drop our opposition to the rearmament programme of the Government, the next phase must be <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>must</b> desist from any industrial or political action that may disturb national unity in the face of Fascist aggression. Along that road is endless retreat, {{and at the end of}} it a voluntary totalitarian State with ourselves erecting the barbed wire around. You cannot collaborate, you cannot accept the logic of collaboration on a first class issue like rearmament, and at the same time evade the implications of collaboration all along the line when the occasion demands it.|$|E
25|$|It (Independence) {{belongs to}} all of us and that is why we {{celebrate}} it. Do you think, however, that our nation from the outset needs only men to serve it? Women should also take their part as women did {{in the early years of}} our nation and Islam. From their examples we must learn <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>must</b> all contribute toward the development of our nation and that this cannot be done without being equipped with knowledge. So we should all attempt to acquire as much knowledge as possible, in order that we may render our services to society in the manner of the women of early Islam.|$|E

25|$|Subjectivity {{comes with}} {{consciousness}} {{of myself as}} a self. It encompasses the emotional and intellectual resources that the individual is born with. Subjectivity is what the individual is as a human being. Now the problem of subjectivity is to decide how to choose—what rules or models is the individual going to use to make the right choices? What are the right choices? Who defines right? To be truly an individual, to be true to himself, his actions should in some way be expressed so that they describe who and what he is to himself and to others. The problem, according to Kierkegaard, is <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>must</b> choose who and what we will be based on subjective interests—the individual must make choices that will mean something to him as a reasoning, feeling being.|$|E
25|$|Davidson {{argues that}} as a culture, our {{attention}} blindness represents a significant challenge <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>must</b> examine and meet head on; particularly since the Internet has revolutionized virtually every aspect of how our lives function now. The Internet, Davidson suggests, has catapulted us into an immediate, collaborative, and interconnected existence that {{is characterized by the}} sudden breakdown of barriers between private and public, work and play, domestic and foreign, office and home, etc. Davidson notes that although our lives have been irrevocably altered in these fundamental ways, our most important educational, corporate, and social institutions have not substantially changed in correlation with these upheavals. She claims that those in educational and corporate spheres continue to operate in 20th century modes (founded {{to meet the challenges of}} industrialization) as though we were currently not living through momentous, epochal changes.|$|E
25|$|In 1841 a {{difference}} arose between Cooke and Wheatstone {{as to the}} share of each in the honour of inventing the telegraph. The question was submitted to the arbitration of the famous engineer, Marc Isambard Brunel, on behalf of Cooke, and Professor Daniell, of King's College, {{the inventor of the}} Daniell battery, on the part of Wheatstone. They awarded to Cooke the credit of having introduced the telegraph as a useful undertaking which promised to be of national importance, and to Wheatstone that of having by his researches prepared the public to receive it. They concluded with the words: 'It is to the united labours of two gentlemen so well qualified for mutual assistance <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>must</b> attribute the rapid progress which this important invention has made during five years since they have been associated.' The decision, however vague, pronounces the needle telegraph a joint production. If it had mainly been invented by Wheatstone, it was chiefly introduced by Cooke. Their respective shares in the undertaking might be compared to that of an author and his publisher, but for the fact that Cooke himself had a share in the actual work of invention.|$|E
