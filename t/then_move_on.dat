5|$|Females become {{sexually mature}} at eight months, but mate no earlier than two years. Males mature later, at one-and-a-half years. Mating takes place {{throughout}} the year; peaks occur during {{spring and fall}} in Texas. Two peaks have been observed in India: from August to October and from March to April. Rutting males aggressively establish and defend their territories from other males, giving out loud grunts and engaging in serious head-to-head fights, pushing each other using horns. Aggressive display consists of thrusting the neck forward and raising it, folding the ears and raising the tail. The dominant male pursues the female with his nose pointing upward, smells her urine and shows a flehmen response. The female shows her receptivity by waving her tail and thumping the hindlegs on the ground. This is followed by several mounting attempts, and copulation. The whole process may {{last as long as}} six hours. The female will remain still for some time after copulation, following which she may start grazing. The male may <b>then</b> <b>move</b> <b>on</b> to mate with another female.|$|E

25|$|It is also {{possible}} for widely separated binaries to lose gravitational {{contact with each other}} during their lifetime, as a result of external perturbations. The components will <b>then</b> <b>move</b> <b>on</b> to evolve as single stars. A close encounter between two binary systems can also result in the gravitational disruption of both systems, with some of the stars being ejected at high velocities, leading to runaway stars.|$|E

25|$|The range {{covered by}} a hook move is the {{equivalent}} of two moves by a rook, or two moves by a bishop, depending on the piece. However, a hook move is functionally a single move: The piece cannot capture twice in one move, nor may it capture and <b>then</b> <b>move</b> <b>on.</b> It must stop before an intervening piece (unless it first changes direction to avoid it), and must stop when it captures, just like any other ranging piece. It can only change direction once per move.|$|E
25|$|Judy Garland's {{father and}} other {{significant}} {{people in her}} life were also gay. Frank Gumm would apparently seduce or at least keep company with very young men or older teens, <b>then</b> <b>move</b> <b>on</b> when told to leave or before his activities could be discovered. Garland's husband Vincente Minnelli was rumored to be a closeted bisexual. From {{the beginning of her}} Hollywood career, Garland liked to visit gay bars with openly gay friends Roger Edens and George Cukor, to the chagrin of her handlers at MGM.|$|E
25|$|The oldest {{method of}} nursing {{education}} is the hospital-based diploma program, which lasts approximately three years. Students take between 30 and 60 credit hours in anatomy, physiology, microbiology, nutrition, chemistry, and other subjects at a college or university, <b>then</b> <b>move</b> <b>on</b> to intensive nursing classes. Until 1996, most RNs in the US were initially educated in nursing by diploma programs. According to the Health Services Resources Administration's 2000 Survey of Nurses only six percent of nurses who graduated from nursing programs in the United States received their education at a Diploma School of Nursing.|$|E

25|$|In Move Mode, {{the player}} may advance or {{backtrack}} (limited) to previous screens. In {{a similar fashion}} to Look Mode, triggers {{will appear on the}} screen and a corresponding directional button must be pressed to move to them, adding a turn to the count. Unlike Look Mode, however, triggers in Move Mode do not require Trigger Points, so one may move as much as one likes, assuming there is no turn limit. Once the player has exited the final screen of a stage, the player will be prompted to save and <b>then</b> <b>move</b> <b>on</b> to the next stage.|$|E
25|$|On Tuesday evening, {{the areas}} around Marktplatz, Barfüsserplatz and Claraplatz {{are devoted to}} Guggekonzerts by the Guggemusik groups, who take turns to play on {{purpose-built}} stages to large crowds. The main Guggekonzert at Marktplatz draws thousands of spectators and is broadcast live by Telebasel, the local TV channel. The traditional Cliques, which march while playing piccolos and Basler snare drums, retreat to the side streets. The Guggemusik groups march through the city centre, then stop and play four to five songs and <b>then</b> <b>move</b> <b>on.</b> Some Guggemusik groups are also invited to play in cafés and restaurants to serenade the guests.|$|E
25|$|When {{children}} reach about 15–18 {{months of}} age, language acquisition flourishes. There is {{a surge in}} word production resulting from {{the growth of the}} cortex. Infants begin to learn the words that form a sentence and within the sentence, the word endings can be interpreted. Elissa Newport and colleagues (1999) found that humans learn first about the sounds of a language, and <b>then</b> <b>move</b> <b>on</b> to how to speak the language. This shows how infants learn the end of a word and know that a new word is being spoken. From this step, infants are then able to determine the structure of a language and word.|$|E
