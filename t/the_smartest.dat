5|$|Improving to 22 goals, 67 {{assists and}} 89 points in 57 games in 2008–09, Ellis led all OHL defencemen and {{finished}} second in team scoring to Taylor Hall. He ranked first {{in the league in}} assists, seventh in points and second in plus-minus rating (+52). As a result, Ellis was named to the OHL First All-Star Team and awarded the Max Kaminsky Trophy, beating fellow nominees P. K. Subban and Cameron Gaunce as the League's top defenceman. The distinction made him a finalist for CHL Defenceman of the Year, but he lost to Jonathon Blum of the Western Hockey League (WHL)'s Vancouver Giants. Ellis was additionally voted <b>the</b> <b>smartest</b> player, hardest shot and best offensive defenceman in the Western Conference in an annual poll of OHL coaches. Ellis later cited <b>the</b> <b>smartest</b> player selection as his most rewarding recognition to that date.|$|E

5|$|Hodgson {{finished}} {{the season with}} 43 goals and 92 points in 53 games, fourth in League scoring. The annual OHL coaches poll distinguished Hodgson as <b>the</b> <b>smartest</b> player (for the second consecutive season), the hardest worker, the best on faceoffs and the best penalty killer. In addition to OHL First All-Star Team honours, he was awarded both the William Hanley Trophy as the League's most sportsmanlike player and the Red Tilson Trophy as OHL player of the year. The media voted Hodgson ahead of forward John Tavares and goaltender Mike Murphy for the Tilson award. Hodgson was then distinguished over fellow major junior league MVP's Brett Sonne of the Western Hockey League (WHL) and Nicola Riopel of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) as the CHL Player of the Year.|$|E
5|$|On the hardwood, he was {{considered}} the consummate defensive center, noted for his unmatched defensive intensity, his stellar basketball IQ and his sheer will to win. Russell excelled at playing man-to-man defense, blocking shots, and grabbing defensive and offensive rebounds. Opponent Wilt Chamberlain said Russell's timing as a shot-blocker was unparalleled. Russell “was <b>the</b> <b>smartest</b> player ever {{to play the game}} ” according to Bill Bradley, Russell’s erstwhile Knicks opponent writing in 2009. He also could score with putbacks and made mid-air outlet passes to point guard Bob Cousy for easy fast break points. He also was known as a fine passer and pick-setter, featured a decent left-handed hook shot and finished strong on alley oops. However, on offense, Russell's output was limited. His NBA career personal averages show him to be an average scorer (15.1 points career average), a poor free throw shooter (56.1%), and average overall shooter from the field (44%, not exceptional for a center). In his 13 years, he averaged a relatively low 13.4 field goals attempted (normally, top scorers average 20 and more), illustrating that he was never {{the focal point of the}} Celtics offense, instead focusing on his tremendous defense.|$|E

Everyone mocks Oscar for his mistake, as Oscar is usually <b>the</b> <b>smartest</b> one in the office, having built this reputation by often correcting his coworkers.
