5|$|Investigators {{initially}} {{assumed that}} the arsenic used to poison the victims had come from rat poison, but when common adulterants used in rat poison failed <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> autopsies, {{they were forced to}} come up with a new theory. It was unlikely that the illiterate sisters would have been able to acquire arsenic through the usual method of visiting a chemist, a route more open to doctors than spinsters. Eventually it was discovered that common flypaper at the time contained arsenic, and that by soaking the flypaper in water, a solution substantially identical – including the same adulterants – to that found in a bottle at the Higgins residence could be obtained.|$|E
25|$|More modern {{approaches}} to playing the didgeridoo are starting <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> performances and lessons around the World.

25|$|Souths {{took part}} in {{the first game of the}} inaugural {{competition}} when it started on Easter Monday, 20 April 1908. They defeated North Sydney 11-7 at Birchgrove Oval. Souths won the inaugural Sydney premiership beating Eastern Suburbs 14-12 in the final and backed it up the following year in extraordinary circumstances when opponents Balmain refused <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> protest of the final being played as a prelude to a Kangaroos v Wallabies match. South Sydney kicked off to no one and were declared premiers.|$|E
25|$|Amid the Diocletian Persecutions, Anthony {{wished to}} become a martyr and in 311 went to Alexandria. He visited those who were imprisoned {{for the sake of}} Christ and comforted them. When the Governor saw that he was confessing his Christianity publicly, not caring what might happen to him, he ordered him not <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the city. However, the Saint did not heed his threats. He faced him and argued with him in order that he might arouse his anger so that he might be {{tortured}} and martyred, but it did not happen.|$|E

40|$|The {{transformation}} of business caused by e-business and e-commerce {{applications of the}} internet and related technologies demonstrates that information systems and information technologies are essential ingredients for business survival and success. The most often cited benefit of IT are integrating business process, increasing efficiency, sales, productivity, and competitiveness. This study is designed for determining where managers considering investment in information technology (IT) projects and users of financial statements can expect competitive advantage through an IT-enabled strategy <b>to</b> <b>shown</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> accounting performance measures. Thus it places a major emphasis on examining whether firms enjoying competitive advantage from IT is differ significantly from those who gain competitive advantage from other factors. Return on Assets (ROA) decomposition (DuPont Analysis) allows financial statement users to examine {{what is the difference between}} companies who gain competitive advantage <b>shown</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> accounting performance measures. From the hypothesis tested, we found that high IT-capable firms were not significantly different from their direct competitor on a number of accounting performance measure...|$|R
25|$|A {{record of}} a saucer-shaped object is from 1290 of a silver disc flying over a village in Yorkshire. Disc-like flying objects were {{occasionally}} reported throughout the millennium. For example, in a mass sighting over Nuremberg in 1561, discs and spheres were reported emerging from large cylinders (see woodcut at left). They are also claimed by ufologists <b>to</b> frequently <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> religious artwork.|$|R
25|$|On August 23, Atta's driver license was revoked in {{absentia}} after he failed <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> traffic court {{to answer the}} earlier citation for driving without a license. On the same day, Israeli Mossad reportedly gave his name to the CIA {{as part of a}} list of 19 names they said were planning an attack in the near future. Only four of the names are known for certain, the others being Marwan al-Shehhi, Khalid al-Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi. On August 30 he was recorded purchasing a utility knife from a Wal-Mart store near the hotel where he stayed prior to 9/11.|$|E
25|$|Toward {{the end of}} the Cucuteni-Trypillia culture's {{existence}} (from roughly 3000 BC to 2750 BC), copper traded {{from other}} societies (notably, from the Balkans) began to appear throughout the region, and members of the Cucuteni-Trypillia culture began to acquire skills necessary to use it to create various items. Along with the raw copper ore, finished copper tools, hunting weapons and other artefacts were also brought in from other cultures. This marked the transition from the Neolithic to the Eneolithic, also known as the Chalcolithic or Copper Age. Bronze artifacts began <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> archaeological sites toward {{the very end of the}} culture. The primitive trade network of this society, that had been slowly growing more complex, was supplanted by the more complex trade network of the Proto-Indo-European culture that eventually replaced the Cucuteni-Trypillia culture.|$|E
25|$|Deng Ai was {{promoted}} to General Who Guards the West (鎮西將軍) and {{put in charge of}} overseeing military affairs in the region. The reason for Jiang Wei's defeat at Shanggui was the failure of the Shu general Hu Ji <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> time with reinforcements to assist Jiang Wei. The failure of this ninth expedition resulted in Shu sustaining heavy losses of lives and resources; the people of Shu resented and hated Jiang Wei even more. Jiang Wei wrote a memorial to the Shu imperial court, requesting to be demoted as punishment. The court approved and demoted him to the position of General of the Guards (衞將軍). However, despite his demotion, Jiang Wei was still allowed to act in the capacity of his previous appointment as General-in-Chief (大將軍).|$|E

50|$|An {{accepted}} part of DC Comics history, Super-Turtle tends <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> once <b>in</b> a {{while in}} one form or another; e.g., a Super-Turtle figure hangs from the ceiling of the Planet Krypton restaurant in Kingdom Come, and he had a cameo appearance in the one-shot Superman and Batman: World's Funnest. Two one-page Super-Turtle stories were created for and appeared in the 2000 Silver Age series.|$|R

25|$|As {{it comes}} to word {{formation}} processes such as derivation and compounding, the earliest derivational suffixes <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> children's speech are those they hear adults use most frequently. (-er as the *'doer' of the action such as walker.) When {{it comes to}} compounds, children first make up names for agents and instruments that they don't know by a pattern (N-N), though {{some of them do}} not follow the pattern (*cutter grass for grass cutter). Then, they might have the right structure but the words are inappropriate since English already has words with the intended meaning such as car-smoke = exhaust. This process points to a preference for building words from other words, thus place less demand on memory than learning an entirely new word for each concept.|$|E
25|$|Ethel lives above Doctor Legg's (Leonard Fenton) {{surgery and}} works as the cleaner in the pub. She is {{somewhat}} of a troublemaker and often spreads the most insane rumours about and gets her words mixed up with hilarious consequences. She is famous for her questionable ability to read-palms and tea-leaves, once even earning a living from it. After Lou's death in 1988 Ethel and Dot become an inseparable double-act and although the two argue constantly, they actually depend on each other a great deal. Despite the fact that Ethel appears totally barmy, she can be quite astute when she wants and she is always the first {{to point out the}} malicious ways of Dot's villainous son, Nick Cotton (John Altman). Ethel is never afraid to stand up to Nick, even kneeing him in the groin once when he attempts to mug her. She also correctly figures out that Nick is trying to poison Dot to get her money, and she refuses to back down, despite Dot falling out with her because of her accusations. Following several falls and a broken hip, Ethel is persuaded to move out of her residence above the surgery and into sheltered housing in 1988. Although she is strongly opposed to this initially, she eventually comes to enjoy her new home, though she would continue <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> Albert Square regularly.|$|E
25|$|In 2012 Nicole visited Leanne {{after her}} brother Eric (Mick Andrews) had a severe {{schizophrenic}} episode. In 2014 Nicole and Vinnie Kruse (Pua Magasiva) returned to Tauranga after Leanne requested help with Eric once again. However, when Nicole suggested Leanne was the issue, she kicked her out only <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> Ferndale with Eric. Following Eric being sent into care, Leanne {{made it clear}} that she thought Nicole should date Vinnie over girlfriend Harper Whitley (Ria Vandervis). She returned to her role as receptionist at the hospital having sold her house in Tauranga. Leanne had a brief flirtation with Murray Cooper (Matthew Chamberlain) after mistakingly believing he and his wife Wendy (Jacqueline Nairn) were swingers. She began to date Nev Carlson (Stuart Devenie) much to the angst of Nicole, but he left her for one of his five ex-wives. Leanne soon found herself becoming a burden to her family but this changed when she began to date Howard Black (Michael Saccente) who lavished her in expensive gifts. Though it soon turned out he had a potentially terminal illness and he returned to America, with Leanne nearly joining him on the day of Nicole's wedding. In 2016 Leanne began to feel elderly and underwent plastic surgery only for the anaesthetic not to work, leading to her being awake during the aborted procedure. Feeling increasingly unwanted at work, Leanne was overjoyed when Howard returned to Ferndale. The two decided to marry and after realising how much she needed to move on, she left Ferndale. 3 months later, Leanne returned to Ferndale temporarily after her honeymoon with Howard although it soon turned out he had fallen overboard of the cruise ship and had drowned.|$|E

At the end, when he is {{pleading}} for Erin to not quit the department, she still sticks with her decision and for her mother to step in.|$|R
500|$|DeGeneres {{commented on}} her months of hinting at her {{sexuality}} {{and the media}} frenzy within the episode itself, giving Ellen Morgan's friends lines like [...] "Ellen, are you coming out or not?!" [...] and [...] "Yeah, quit jerking us around and come out already!" [...] Morgan's therapist comments that if Morgan does not come out she will [...] "continue to have these dreams and then it's going <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> your waking life as these little clues that {{get more and more}} obvious.

500|$|Table 5 {{shows the}} intransitive {{indicative}} inflection for patient person {{and number of}} the verb neri- [...] "to eat" [...] in the indicative and interrogative moods (question marks mark interrogative intonation—questions have falling intonation on the last syllable as opposed to most Indo-European languages in which questions are marked by rising intonation). The indicative and the interrogative mood each have a transitive and an intransitive inflection, but here only the intransitive inflection is given. Interestingly, consonant gradation like that in Finnish appears <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the verb conjugation (with strengthening to pp in the 3rd person plural and weakening to v elsewhere).|$|E
500|$|Pre-production went slowly. Weeks before filming began, Malick told Geisler and Roberdeau not <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> Australia {{where the}} film was being made, ostensibly because George Stevens Jr. would be the on-location {{producer}} supporting line producer Grant Hill. Malick {{told them that they}} had upset the studio for refusing to give up above-the-title production credit to Stevens. He did not tell them, however, that in 1996 he had a clause inserted in his contract barring the producers from the set. Geisler and Roberdeau were mystified about this behavior; Geisler told Entertainment Weekly, [...] "I didn't think he was capable of betrayal of this magnitude".|$|E

The artists were reported to be wearing fashionable dresses, with Knowles in [...] "a feathered dress" [...] and Gaga sporting [...] "something wild". In an interview with New York's Z100 radio station, Gaga further commented on her collaboration with Knowles, for the music video.

[...] Barnert also {{said it would be}} [...] "interesting" [...] to see whether [...] " [...] legion of fans from Port Charles will follow him to Genoa City." [...] Jill Farren Phelps developed a reputation and [...] "bad rap" [...] because she [...] "uses people" [...] according to Mark Pinter, an actor and friend of Phelps who had been hired by her to portray Marcus Wheeler on The Young and the Restless. Barnert noted that Burton is [...] "someone who has made his allegiance to Phelps clear" [...] which is why [...] "many fans" [...] had expected him <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> Genoa City [...] "eventually". TV Guides Michael Logan had also weighed in on the rumors, calling Burton's [...] "willingness" [...] to work in Los Angeles after leaving General Hospital to live in Nashville a [...] "puzzler". Logan suggested that there could have been more to his decision to quit General Hospital. Stephen Nichols, who had portrayed Tucker McCall on The Young and the Restless for over three years, was fired that December. Logan said Phelps, who was [...] "under orders" [...] to trim the show's budget, may have fired Nichols in order to afford Burton in lieu of him.|$|E
