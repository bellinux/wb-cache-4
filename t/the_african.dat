2500|$|A ship to {{transport}} <b>the</b> <b>Africans</b> to Liberia {{was engaged in}} June, 1829, and Waters Smith was ordered to prepare <b>the</b> <b>Africans</b> for embarkation. There were delays when the ship had to be replaced, and the departure point for <b>the</b> <b>Africans</b> was moved from St. Augustine to Fernandina, Florida. Smith had problems gathering <b>the</b> <b>Africans.</b> He had rented 36 of <b>the</b> <b>Africans</b> to Zephaniah Kingsley and another 20 to Joseph Marion Hernández. When Smith called for <b>the</b> hired-out <b>Africans</b> {{to be returned to}} him so that they could be shipped to Africa, Kingsley and Hernandez refused to do so, based on an opinion by the Collector of Customs for St. Augustine that <b>the</b> <b>Africans</b> were free men and therefore Smith had no authority to hire them out as slaves or to remove them from the possession of Kingsley and Hernandez and order them sent to Africa. Smith was able to bring <b>the</b> <b>Africans</b> into Fernandina, [...] "artly by force and partly by persuasion". Hernández never paid any of the money he owed Smith for <b>the</b> 20 <b>Africans</b> he had rented. Smith also paid Seminoles to bring in some of <b>the</b> <b>Africans</b> that had run away from Kingsley's and Hernández' plantations. Smith felt that he had to stay on guard in Fernandina because he suspected that slave dealers were planning to steal some of <b>the</b> <b>Africans</b> to carry them away for sale as slaves.|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{discusses}} the Mr. Kurtz?s reasons in civilizing <b>the</b> <b>Africans</b> and <b>the</b> {{effects of the}} civilization. The writer is curious to know Mr. Kurtz?s reasons in civilizing <b>the</b> <b>Africans.</b> Moreover, <b>the</b> writer is also curious to know the effects that occur due to Mr. Kurtz?s civilization in Africa. In the end, the writer wants to reveal whether Kurtz?s motivation to civilize <b>the</b> <b>Africans</b> will affect <b>the</b> <b>Africans</b> and Mr. Kurtz himself. In conducting the analysis the writer limits the analysis on Mr. Kurtz as the main character. For this purpose, the writer uses cultural approach and Post colonialism theory and several concepts which are Eurocentrism, Orientalism, and Mimicry. By applying the concept of Eurocentrism as the base in each Kurtz?s action while {{he lives in the}} center of Africa, the writer is able to find out that the major reason of Kurtz?s motivation in civilizing <b>the</b> <b>Africans</b> is Mr. Kurtz?s Eurocentric background. Furthermore, the writer uses Post colonialism and the concept of Orientalism to justify how Kurtz portrays <b>the</b> <b>Africans</b> as a colonized people. By using the concepts of Mimicry the writer is able to reveal the effects of the civilization that occur to <b>the</b> <b>Africans</b> is <b>the</b> courage to oppose Mr. Kurtz which makes him insane.

After the treaty was passed, the United States used fewer ships than the treaty required, ordered the ships based far from the coast of Africa, and used ships that were too large to operate close to shore. Between 1845 and 1850, the United States Navy captured only 10 slave vessels, while the British captured 423 vessels carrying 27,000 captives.|$|E
5|$|Crex {{is a small}} genus {{of birds}} in the rail family.

Unusually for their family, these are birds of dry habitats rather than wetlands; the Eurasian species mainly breeds in hay meadows, and <b>the</b> <b>African</b> crake in dry grassland. <b>The</b> <b>African</b> crake is sometimes given its own genus, Crecopsis, but is now more usually placed in Crex.|$|E
