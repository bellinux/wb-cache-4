30|$|Since {{atrazine}} is {{the small}} molecule, direct competitive immunoassay approach was employed to improve {{the sensitivity of the}} ME nanobiosensor. In <b>the</b> direct <b>competitive</b> immunoassay, <b>the</b> antibody is modified on the sensor surface and the signal response results from the binding of Atr–BSA molecule. Conversely, in <b>the</b> indirect <b>competitive</b> immunoassay, Atr–BSA is immobilized on the sensor surface and the response results from the binding of antibody molecule. According to the literature researches [38] and our results, <b>the</b> direct <b>competitive</b> immunoassay is feasible for small molecules monitoring. <b>The</b> indirect <b>competitive</b> immunoassay is highly sensitive to the analyte sample with trace concentration [39]. Although <b>the</b> indirect <b>competitive</b> immunoassay has a higher sensitivity [40, 41], it may be complicated to operate and difficult to implement for repeated reliable use [36]. However, <b>the</b> direct <b>competitive</b> immunoassay is very fast, simple to use, and self-contained—no additional reagents needed [36]. Thus, for the future development, <b>the</b> direct <b>competitive</b> immunoassay may be the most promising method.|$|R

5|$|Aside {{from sports}} that have world-wide appeal and competitions, {{such as the}} Olympic Games, the {{entertainment}} value of a sport depends on the culture and country {{in which it is}} played. For example, in the United States, baseball and basketball games are popular forms of entertainment; in Bhutan, the national sport is archery; in New Zealand, it is rugby union; in Iran, it is freestyle wrestling. Japan's unique sumo wrestling contains ritual elements that derive from its long history. In some cases, such as the international running group Hash House Harriers, participants create a blend of sport and entertainment for themselves, largely independent of spectator involvement, where the social component is more important than <b>the</b> <b>competitive.</b>|$|E

A review of the studies in <b>the</b> <b>competitive</b> effects of dogs on sympatric carnivores did not mention any research on competition between dogs and wolves. Competition would favor the wolf, which is known to kill dogs, however wolves tend to live in pairs or in small packs in areas where they are highly persecuted, giving them a disadvantage facing large groups of dogs.|$|E

5|$|Specialized bulk {{carriers}} {{began to appear}} as steam-powered ships became more popular. The first steam ship recognized as a bulk carrier was the British coal carrier SS John Bowes in 1852.

5|$|Substrate {{and product}} {{inhibition}} is where either the substrate or {{product of an}} enzyme reaction inhibit the enzyme's activity. This inhibition may follow <b>the</b> <b>competitive,</b> uncompetitive or mixed patterns. In substrate inhibition there is a progressive decrease in activity at high substrate concentrations. This may indicate the existence of two substrate-binding sites in the enzyme. At low substrate, the high-affinity site is occupied and normal kinetics are followed. However, at higher concentrations, the second inhibitory site becomes occupied, inhibiting the enzyme. Product inhibition is often a regulatory feature in metabolism and can {{be a form of}} negative feedback.|$|E
