5|$|Both the 1930s episode and the {{outbreak}} of competitive devaluation that began in 2009 occurred during global economic downturns. An important difference with the 2010s period is that international traders are much better able to hedge their exposures to exchange rate volatility due to more sophisticated financial markets. A second difference is that during the later period devaluations have invariably been effected by nations expanding their money supplies—either by creating money to buy foreign currency, {{in the case of}} direct interventions, or by creating money to inject into their domestic economies, with quantitative easing. If all nations try to devalue at once, <b>the</b> <b>net</b> <b>effect</b> on exchange rates could cancel out leaving them largely unchanged, but the expansionary effect of the interventions would remain. So while there has been no collaborative intent, some economists such as Berkeley's Barry Eichengreen and Goldman Sachs's Dominic Wilson have suggested <b>the</b> <b>net</b> <b>effect</b> will be similar to semi-coordinated monetary expansion which will help the global economy.|$|E

As integrators of local catchment and regional processes, freshwater ecosystems are also ranked highly sensitive to <b>the</b> <b>net</b> <b>effects</b> of multiple stressors, yet {{there has not been}} a large-scale quantitative synthesis. We analysed data from 88 papers including 286 responses of freshwater ecosystems to paired stressors and discovered that overall, their cumulative mean effect size was less than the sum of their single effects (i. e. an antagonistic interaction). <b>Net</b> <b>effects</b> of dual stressors on diversity and functional performance response metrics were additive and antagonistic, respectively. Across individual studies, a simple vote-counting method revealed that <b>the</b> <b>net</b> <b>effects</b> of stressor pairs were frequently more antagonistic (41 %) than synergistic (28 %), additive (16 %) or reversed (15 %). Here, we define a reversal as occurring when <b>the</b> <b>net</b> impact of two stressors is in the opposite direction (negative or positive) from that of the sum of their single effects. While warming paired with nutrification resulted in additive <b>net</b> <b>effects,</b> <b>the</b> overall mean <b>net</b> <b>effect</b> of warming combined with a second stressor was antagonistic. Most importantly, <b>the</b> mean <b>net</b> <b>effects</b> across all stressor pairs and response metrics were consistently antagonistic or additive, contrasting the greater prevalence of reported synergies in marine systems. Here, a possible explanation for more antagonistic responses by freshwater biota to stressors is that the inherent greater environmental variability of smaller aquatic ecosystems fosters greater potential for acclimation and co-adaptation to multiple stressors.

5|$|U.S. {{taxation}} {{is generally}} progressive, especially the federal income taxes, and {{is among the}} most progressive in the developed world. The highest 10% of income earners pay a majority of federal taxes, and about half of all taxes. Payroll taxes for Social Security are a flat regressive tax, with no tax charged on income above $118,500 (for 2015 and 2016) and no tax at all paid on unearned income from things such as stocks and capital gains. The historic reasoning for the regressive nature of the payroll tax is that entitlement programs have not been viewed as welfare transfers. However, according to the Congressional Budget Office <b>the</b> <b>net</b> <b>effect</b> of Social Security is that the benefit to tax ratio ranges from roughly 70% for the top earnings quintile to about 170% for the lowest earning quintile, making the system progressive.|$|E
5|$|In {{his book}} which {{presented}} {{the model to}} the general public, Paul Krugman used {{the example of the}} aircraft industry, with the two players being Airbus and Boeing. In fact, Krugman and Baldwin examined the industry for wide bodied aircraft {{in the context of the}} model in a 1988 paper. The authors calibrate an extended version of the model in order to examine the effect of a subsidy to Airbus by European governments, and its presence in a market which can only support two firms at most, worldwide. They find that the subsidy had an unambiguously negative effect on welfare of the United States and a positive effect on rest of the world, which benefits from lower prices. The result for Europe hinges on price elasticity of demand; for relatively inelastic demand <b>the</b> <b>net</b> <b>effect</b> of subsidy is positive with most of the benefits accruing to European consumers, but for elastic demand, social welfare in Europe goes down. Importantly, unlike in the baseline Brander and Spencer model, Krugman and Baldwin find that the changes to consumer surplus resulting from the subsidy and entry, dominate the effect of changes in firm profits in social welfare calculations.|$|E

5|$|This {{exception}} arises due to competing {{horizontal and}} vertical trends in the nuclear charge. Going along a period, the nuclear charge increases with atomic number as do the number of electrons.

40|$|This study {{assesses the}} mobile {{phone in the}} {{diffusion}} of knowledge for better governance in sub-Saharan Africa for the period 2000 - 2012. For this purpose we employ Generalised Method of Moments with forward orthogonal deviations. The empirical evidence is based on three complementary knowledge diffusion variables (innovation, internet penetration and educational quality) and ten governance indicators that are bundled and unbundled. The following are the main findings. First, there is an unconditional positive effect of mobile phone penetration on good governance. Second, <b>the</b> <b>net</b> <b>effects</b> on political, economic and institutional governances {{that are associated with}} the interaction of the mobile phone with knowledge diffusion variables are positive for the most part. Third, countries with low levels of governance are catching-up their counterparts with higher levels of governance. The above findings are broadly consistent with theoretical underpinnings on the relevance of mobile phones in mitigating bad governance in Africa. The evidence of some insignificant <b>net</b> <b>effects</b> and decreasing marginal impacts may be an indication that the mobile phone could also be employed to decrease government quality. Overall, this study has established <b>net</b> positive <b>effects</b> for <b>the</b> most part.

40|$|Trade policy {{reforms in}} recent decades have sharply reduced the distortions that were harming {{agriculture}} in developing countries, yet global trade in farm products continues {{to be far more}} distorted than trade in nonfarm goods.

The global LINKAGE model results suggest that removing those remaining distortions would reduce international inequality, largely by boosting net farm incomes and raising real wages for unskilled workers in developing countries, and would reduce the number of poor people worldwide by 3 percent. The analysis based on the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) model for a sample of 15 countries, and ten stand-alone national case studies, all point to larger reductions in poverty, especially if only the non-poor are subjected to increased income taxation to compensate for the loss of trade tax revenue. farm trade policy; income inequality; Poverty; price distortions...|$|R

40|$|The {{proposition}} that widespread gun ownership {{serves as a}} deterrent to residential burglary is widely touted by advocates, but the evidence is weak, consisting of anecdotes, interviews with burglars, casual comparisons with other countries, and the like. A more systematic exploration requires data on local rates of gun ownership and of residential burglary, and such data have only recently become available. In this paper we exploit a new well-validated proxy for local gun-ownership prevalence [...] the proportion of suicides that involve firearms [...] together with newly available geo-coded data from the National Crime Victimization Survey, to produce the first systematic estimates of <b>the</b> <b>net</b> <b>effects</b> of gun prevalence on residential burglary patterns. The importance of such empirical work stems in part from the fact that theoretical considerations do not provide much guidance in predicting <b>the</b> <b>net</b> <b>effects</b> of widespread gun ownership. Guns in the home may pose a threat to burglars, but also serve as an inducement, since guns are particularly valuable loot. Other things equal, a gun-rich community provides more lucrative burglary opportunities than one where guns are more sparse. The new empirical results reported here provide no support for a <b>net</b> deterrent <b>effect</b> from widespread gun ownership. Rather, our analysis concludes that residential burglary rates tend to increase with community gun prevalence. ...|$|R
