5|$|A new Prisons Act {{was passed}} in 1981, which updated the 1903 act and its eleven {{amendments}} with modern philosophies and practices – codifying departmental orders, instructions, and policy documents. The act was, however, slanted towards prisoner management and safety, as the government and opposition were mindful of public opinion, {{and the perception of}} lax security at Fremantle. The result was legislation criticised by the Criminal Lawyers Association, academics, and newspapers, including for minimal welfare provisions that did little to ensure prisoner welfare. <b>The</b> <b>department</b> <b>was</b> at the same time renamed the Prisons Department once more, to emphasise imprisonment as its primary responsibility.|$|E
5|$|An east–west freeway was {{originally}} planned as an Interstate Highway allowing traffic to access downtown Lansing in the 1955 General Location of National System of Interstate Highways (Yellow Book), an early proposal {{for what would}} become the Interstate Highway System. As originally proposed by the Michigan State Highway Department in 1958, the freeway was to be called I-296. <b>The</b> <b>department</b> <b>was</b> waiting on approval of a final numbering scheme the next year, before the first Interstates were signed in the state in 1959. By the time construction started on the Lansing freeway, it was numbered I-496.|$|E
5|$|Encouraged by {{her mother}} and sister, Murray decided to enroll at the newly opened {{department}} of Egyptology at University College London (UCL) in Bloomsbury, Central London. Having been founded by an endowment from Amelia Blanford Edwards, one of the co-founders of the Egypt Exploration Fund (EEF), <b>the</b> <b>department</b> <b>was</b> run by the pioneering early archaeologist Sir William Flinders Petrie, and based in the Edwards Library of UCL's South Cloisters. Murray began her studies at UCL at age 30 in January 1894, {{as part of a}} class composed largely of other women and older men. There, she took courses in the Ancient Egyptian and Coptic languages which were taught by Francis Llewellyn Griffith and Walter Ewing Crum respectively.|$|E

5|$|In 2011, {{construction}} {{began to}} widen I-94/I-69 approaching the Blue Water Bridge, a project completed in 2012. The widening project added dedicated lanes for local traffic and for Blue Water Bridge traffic {{with a new}} permanent welcome center expected to open in 2015, replacing the temporary one near Capac. The lane configuration changes have confused drivers in the area, especially those with outdated GPS devices, a problem first noted as <b>the</b> <b>department</b> <b>was</b> preparing to reopen the freeway in October 2012. As a result, MDOT installed updated signs complete with American and Canadian flags to help prevent drivers from heading to Canada by mistake.|$|E
5|$|Overall {{planning}} for Bodyguard and Ironside rested with John Bevan and the London Controlling Section (LCS). The LCS {{had been set}} up in 1942 following successes in deception in the Middle East by Dudley Clarke. After initial attempts at deception planning <b>the</b> <b>department</b> <b>was</b> tasked with bringing Bodyguard to fruition. One of their most useful deception channels was through double agents. During {{the early stages of the}} war, the Abwehr (German intelligence) had sent spies to Britain, but all of them either surrendered or were captured. Some, along with other volunteers, were used as an extensive misinformation network under the control of the Twenty Committee.|$|E

5|$|Warren {{joined the}} faculty of the Department of Radiology at the University of Rochester School of Medicine in 1926, {{becoming}} an Assistant Professor of Medicine. <b>The</b> <b>department</b> <b>was</b> a new one that had only been founded in 1921, based upon the ideals of medical education propounded by Abraham Flexner in his 1910 Flexner Report. The medical school had opened in 1925 and did not graduate its first class until 1929. Warren was one of the original group that Dean George Whipple assembled to staff the new medical school. At Rochester, Warren investigated the effects of artificial fever, including its possible use for treating gonococci infections. He was also interested in radiography.|$|E
5|$|As a {{cost-saving}} move, {{effective on}} July 1, 1934, the Georgia Board of Regents transferred {{control of the}} relatively large Evening School of Commerce to the University of Georgia and moved the small civil engineering program at UGA to Tech. The move was controversial, and both students and faculty protested against it, fearing that the Board of Regents would remove other programs from Georgia Tech and reduce it to an engineering department of the University of Georgia. Brittain suggested {{that the lack of}} Georgia Tech alumni on the Board of Regents contributed to their decision. Despite the pressure, the Board of Regents held its ground. The Depression also {{had a significant impact on}} the athletic program, as most athletes were in the commerce school, and resulted in the elimination of athletic scholarships, which were replaced by a loan program. Plans for an industrial management department to replace and supersede the Evening School of Commerce were first made in fall 1934. <b>The</b> <b>department</b> <b>was</b> established in 1935, and evolved into Tech's College of Management.|$|E

5|$|Buckner {{was given}} a medical leave of absence {{following}} Chickamauga, returning to Virginia, where he engaged in routine work while recovering his strength. His division was sent without him to support Longstreet in the Knoxville Campaign, while the remainder of Bragg's army was defeated in the Chattanooga Campaign. Buckner served on the court martial of Maj. Gen. Lafayette McLaws after that subordinate of Longstreet's was charged with poor performance at Knoxville. Buckner was briefly given command of Maj. Gen. John Bell Hood's division in February 1864, and on March 8, he was given command of the reestablished Department of East Tennessee. <b>The</b> <b>department</b> <b>was</b> a shell of its former self—less than one-third its original size, badly equipped, and {{in no position to}} mount an offensive. Buckner was virtually useless to the Confederacy here, and on April 28, he was ordered to join Edmund Kirby Smith in the Trans-Mississippi Department of the Confederacy.|$|E
5|$|During the 1970s {{and early}} 1980s the Department of the Environment {{assisted}} the Powis estate by lending government staff {{to repair the}} castle. Visitor numbers were falling, however, in part due the dilapidated condition of the property, and the estate became increasingly unable to afford to maintain the castle. After 1984, when the function of <b>the</b> <b>department</b> <b>was</b> taken over by English Heritage, a more systematic approach was put into place. This based around a partnership in which the Powis Estate would retain ownership of the castle and develop visitor access, {{in exchange for a}} £500,000 contribution from English Heritage for a jointly-funded programme of repairs and maintenance, delivered through specialist contractors. This included repairs to the parts of the curtain wall, which collapsed in 1990, and the redevelopment of the visitor's centre. Limited archaeological excavation was carried out in the outer bailey between 1992 and 1993 by the City of Hereford Archaeology Unit.|$|E
5|$|Penfold {{returned}} to the FCO in 1987, where he was appointed to {{a position in the}} West Indian and Atlantic Department, which was responsible for the Caribbean and South Atlantic. <b>The</b> <b>department</b> <b>was</b> divided between British Dependent Territories (for which Penfold was responsible) and independent nations. In the years before and during Penfold's tenure, the British dependencies had been the subject of several diplomatic incidents and were causing problems for the British government, to whom the international community looked to resolve problems with its dependent territories. The FCO had struggled to find new governors for the territories since the winding-up of the Colonial Service—which had historically provided most governors and many civil servants—in the 1960s. Thus, Penfold recommended in a policy paper that the Diplomatic Service be considered as a recruiting pool, and that governors be recruited earlier in their career rather than at the end. He also identified several posts which could be used for training potential governors, including the one he occupied and deputy governor posts such as that in Bermuda.|$|E

5|$|Planning for the {{demobilisation}} of the Australian military {{began at}} the end of 1942 when the Department of Post-War Reconstruction was formed. <b>The</b> <b>department</b> <b>was</b> involved with drawing up plans for determining veterans' entitlements and the assistance which would be provided to discharged personnel to help them settle into civilian life. This included planning the delivery of training, housing and ensuring that jobs were available. An important consideration was to ensure that civilian employment opportunities were created at an appropriate rate as the size of the military was reduced. In order to achieve this, it was decided to continue many wartime economic regulations such as price controls in order to limit inflation and direct resources to where the Australian Government believed they were most needed.|$|E
5|$|Through 1944 'A' Force {{was slowly}} winding down. Clarke was {{involved}} in planning Operation Bodyguard, a major cover plan for the Allied landing in Normandy, and he was tasked with executing the (largely political) deceptions in the Middle Eastern region. However, {{by the end of}} the summer 'A' Force's usefulness in operations had reached its end. On 13 October Clarke held a party (true to form, at a Cairo cinema) for the remaining members of the department. Command of the remaining tactical deceptions was transferred to Caserta. Clarke, along with a skeleton staff, remained in Egypt to tie up the loose ends of various operations and to begin his history of the department. In April 1945, Clarke left Cairo for London; on 18 June he called a meeting of the remaining 'A' Force members at the Great Central Hotel where <b>the</b> <b>department</b> <b>was</b> disbanded.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the biggest}} current {{challenges}} to wind power grid integration in the United States is the necessity of developing new transmission lines to carry power from wind farms, usually in remote lowly populated states {{in the middle of}} the country due to availability of wind, to high load locations, usually on the coasts where population density is higher. The current transmission lines in remote locations were not designed for the transport of large amounts of energy. As transmission lines become longer the losses associated with power transmission increase, as modes of losses at lower lengths are exacerbated and new modes of losses are no longer negligible as the length is increased, making it harder to transport large loads over large distances. However, resistance from state and local governments makes it difficult to construct new transmission lines. Multi state power transmission projects are discouraged by states with cheap electric power rates for fear that exporting their cheap power will lead to increased rates. A 2005 energy law gave the Energy Department authority to approve transmission projects states refused to act on, but after an attempt to use this authority, the Senate declared <b>the</b> <b>department</b> <b>was</b> being overly aggressive in doing so. Another problem is that wind companies find out after the fact that the transmission capacity of a new farm is below the generation capacity, largely because federal utility rules to encourage renewable energy installation allow feeder lines to meet only minimum standards. These are important issues that need to be solved, as when the transmission capacity does not meet the generation capacity, wind farms are forced to produce below their full potential or stop running all together, in a process known as curtailment. While this leads to potential renewable generation left untapped, it prevents possible grid overload or risk to reliable service.|$|E
