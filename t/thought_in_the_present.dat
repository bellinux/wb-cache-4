6000|$|No {{stranger}} {{situation can}} be imagined {{than that of}} these extraordinary young women at this juncture; it was so singular on Verena's part, in particular, that I despair of presenting it to the reader with the air of reality. To understand it, one must bear in mind her peculiar frankness, natural and acquired, her habit of discussing questions, sentiments, moralities, her education, in the atmosphere of lecture-rooms, of séances, her familiarity with the vocabulary of emotion, the mysteries of [...] "the spiritual life." [...] She had learned to breathe and move in a rarefied air, as she would have learned to speak Chinese if her success in life had depended upon it; but this dazzling trick, and all her artlessly artful facilities, were {{not a part of}} her essence, an expression of her innermost preferences. What was a part of her essence was the extraordinary generosity with which she could expose herself, give herself away, turn herself inside out, for the satisfaction of a person who made demands of her. Olive, as we know, had made the reflexion that no one was naturally less preoccupied with the idea of her dignity, and though Verena put it forward as an excuse for remaining where they were, it must be admitted that in reality she was very deficient in the desire to be consistent with herself. Olive had contributed with all her zeal to the development of Verena's gift; but I scarcely venture to think now, what she may have said to herself, in the secrecy of deep meditation, about the consequences of cultivating an abundant eloquence. Did she say that Verena was attempting to smother her now in her own phrases? did she view with dismay the fatal effect of trying to have an answer for everything? From Olive's condition during these lamentable weeks there is a certain propriety--a delicacy enjoined by the respect for misfortune--in averting our head. She neither ate nor slept; she could scarcely speak without bursting into tears; she felt so implacably, insidiously baffled. She remembered the magnanimity with which she had declined (the winter before the last) to receive the vow of eternal maidenhood which she had at first demanded and then put by as too crude a test, but which Verena, for a precious hour, for ever flown, would then have been willing to take. She repented of it with bitterness and rage; and then she asked herself, more desperately still, whether even if she held that pledge she should be brave enough to enforce it in the face of actual complications. She believed that if it were in her power to say, [...] "No, I won't let you off; I have your solemn word, and I won't!" [...] Verena would bow to that decree and remain with her; but the magic would have passed out of her spirit for ever, the sweetness out of their friendship, the efficacy out of their work. She said to her again and again that she had utterly changed since that hour she came to her, in New York, after her morning with Mr. Ransom, and sobbed out that they must hurry away. Then she had been wounded, outraged, sickened, and in the interval nothing had happened, nothing but that one exchange of letters, which she knew about, to bring her round to a shameless tolerance. Shameless Verena admitted it to be; she assented over and over to this proposition, and explained, as eagerly each time {{as if it were the}} first, what it was that had come to pass, what it was that had brought her round. It had simply come over her that she liked him, that this was the true point of view, the only one from which one could consider the situation in a way that would lead to what she called a real solution--a permanent rest. On this particular point Verena never responded, in the liberal way I have mentioned, without asseverating at the same time that what she desired most in the world was to prove (the picture Olive had held up from the first) that a woman could live on persistently, clinging to a great, vivifying, redemptory idea, without the help of a man. To testify to the end against the stale superstition--mother of every misery--that those gentry were as indispensable as they had proclaimed themselves on the house-tops--that, she passionately protested, was as inspiring a <b>thought</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> poignant crisis as it had ever been.|$|E

Cardiogenic differentiation in vitro and in vivo depends on FGF- 2. Interestingly, this factor does not control the number of precursors but regulates the differentiation process. These findings suggest that, besides its angiogenic actions, FGF- 2 could be used in vivo to facilitate the mobilization and differentiation of resident cardiac precursors in the treatment of cardiac diseases...|$|E

40|$|Past {{research}} suggests that under high elaboration conditions, source cred-ibility can play more than one role in persuasion.

Considerable research attention has been devoted to understanding the effects of source credibility (expertise and trustworthiness) on persuasion (Petty & Wegener, 1998; Pornpitakpan, 2004). Consistent with the predictions of multi–process theories such as the elabora-tion likelihood (Petty & Cacioppo, 1986) and heuristic–systematic (Chaiken, Liberman, & Eagly, 1989) models, it has been discovered that source credibility can affect persuasion through a variety of dis...|$|R

30|$|Fifth, past {{studies have}} found {{evidence}} that task-unrelated thought may demonstrate fluctuations (Carciofo, Du, Song, & Zhang, 2014; Giambra et al., 1989) similar to those we observed for freely moving thought or stimulus-independent thought. We did not find similar patterns for task-unrelated <b>thought</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> study, but {{this may be due}} to significant methodological differences among the studies. Giambra et al. (1989) conducted a sleep-deprivation study intended more to explore natural circadian rhythms of mind-wandering in isolation than fluctuations in real-world environments. Because they used a lab-based task, their participants were judged on whether they were paying attention to a particular narrow assignment they were given. On the other hand, Carciofo et al. (2014) had participants estimate when they were most likely to mind-wander instead of probing them throughout the day; they used a multi-item scale that is related to but different than task-unrelated thought to judge mind-wandering. By contrast, the current study presumably assessed participants’ attention to a variety of tasks performed in their everyday life—and did so while they were engaged in those tasks. Taken together, it is difficult to know whether the results of this study represent a true conflict with the literature or simply a difference between experience-sampling studies and lab-based alternatives.|$|E

Each MRSA isolate (one per patient) recovered in the Vaud canton of Switzerland from January 2005 to December 2008 was analyzed by the double-locus sequence typing (DLST) method and SCCmec typing. DLST analysis indicated that 1, 884 / 2, 036 isolates (92. 5 %) belong to four predominant clones. As expected from the local spread of a clone, most isolates within clones harbored an identical SCCmec type. However, three to seven SCCmec types have been recovered in every predominant DLST clone, suggesting {{that some of these}} elements might have been acquired locally. This pattern could also be explained by distinct importations of related isolates into the study region. The addition of a third highly variable locus to further increase the discrimi-natory power of typing as well as epidemiological data suggested that most ambiguous situations were explained by the second hypothesis. In conclusion, our study showed that even if the acquisition of new SCCmec elements at a local level likely occurs, it does not explain all the diversity observed in the study region.

The ratio of indigenous primary energy production to primary energy consumption is decreasing noticeably. Therefore, it is of great importance for Turkey {{to make use of}} its indigenous energy resources more effectively, including its solar energy potential.

METHODS: A total of 32 patients with drug naive ET were recruited prospectively from the Movement Disorders outpatient clinic. The patients were divided into a propranolol-responder group (n = 18) and a non-responder group (n = 14). We analyzed the pattern of cortical thickness and diffusion tensor WM changes between these two groups and performed correlation analysis between imaging and clinical parameters. RESULTS: There {{were no significant differences in}} demographic characteristics, general cognition, or results of detailed neuropsychological tests between the groups. The non-responder group showed more severe cortical atrophy in the left orbitofrontal cortex and right temporal cortex relative to responders. However, the responders exhibited significantly lower fractional anisotropy values in the bilateral frontal, corpus callosal, and right parietotemporal WM compared with the non-responder group. There were no significant clusters where the cortical thickness or WM alterations were significantly correlated with initial tremor severity or disease duration. CONCLUSIONS: The present data suggest that patients with ET have heterogeneous cortical thinning and WM alteration with respect to responsiveness to propranolol, suggesting that propranolol responsiveness may be a predictive factor to determine ET subtypes in terms of neuroanatomical heterogeneity...|$|E

40|$|In a {{earlier work}} [1, 2, 3, 4] {{we have put}} forward the {{hypothesis}} that two layers of thought can be identified in the human thought process, which we have called the ‘classical logical ’ layer and the ‘quantum conceptual ’ layer. In the classical logical layer thought processes are given form by an underlying Boolean logical conceptual process, its non deterministic ‘lack of knowledge ’ version modeled by Kolmogorovian probability and in an idealized form by a stochastic process. In the quantum conceptual layer, the thought process gets form {{under the influence of}} the totality of the surrounding conceptual landscape. The key event within this layer is that different concepts figure as individual entities, even when they are combinations of other concepts. A phenomenon of conceptual emergence is taking place in the quantum conceptual layer mathematically described by superposition within the quantum formalism used to model this layer. The quantum conceptual thought process is indeterministic in essence; i. e. there is not necessarily an underlying deterministic process. It is however an equally well structured layer than the classical logical one, and we belief that it is mainly the lack of insight about the structure of this quantum conceptual layer that often leads to the idea that the thought processes described in it are mainly unstructured and correspond to intuitive or irrational <b>thought.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> paper we analyze more in detail the cognitive and mathematical structures of these two layers of thought.

40|$|When {{introduced}} to mainstream psychological research {{nearly a decade}} ago, mind wandering was defined as unintentional, internally-focused thought. The requirement of an absence of intention was critical {{in terms of the}} conceptualization of mind wandering because, for the better half of the past century, considerable research has examined intentional, internally-focused thought. Thus, without the stipulation of an absence of intention, mind wandering would simply refer to a construct that has long been studied by researchers, which would therefore negate the utility of introducing the neologism “mind wandering” to the scientific community. Notwithstanding the critical importance of conceptualizing mind wandering as reflecting unintentional, internally-focused thoughts, in most studies on the topic, the requisite steps have not been taken to ensure that the reported mind wandering did in fact occur without intention. The foregoing is particularly problematic as it suggests that, in many studies, absent-minded mind wandering might have been confounded with intentionally-generated <b>thought.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> series of studies, I examined this possibility at both the trait and state levels, and found that, (1) in studies of mind wandering, people do in fact experience and report intentional internally-focused thought as reflecting “mind wandering,” and (2) intentional and unintentional internally-focused thoughts are differentially related to certain critical measures of interest, which indicates that they are dissociable cognitive experiences. These results suggest a serious problem with {{the current state of the}} literature on mind wandering: Namely, that mind wandering, as initially conceptualized and {{introduced to}} psychological research as reflecting unintentional internally-focused thought, has likely been conflated with a very different mode of thinking (i. e., deliberately engaged thought) ...|$|E

Modelled and measured sediment transport rates {{established for the}} Holderness coast {{are similar to those}} on comparable coasts elsewhere. The direction of sediment drift depends on wave approach, and determining sediment transport rates, cliff composition and cliff retreat rates allows a sediment budget to be prepared. The beach response predicted by the sediment budget was confirmed by field observations, with budget surpluses and deficits coinciding with full and depleted beach profiles respectively. The area of deficit in the north of the study area was associated with the reduced sheltering effect of Flamborough Head on sediment drift. At most profiles, especially those with a sediment deficit, high energy waves may remove the sand veneer completely, leaving the till platform exposed. These bare till patches which elsewhere have been called ords and have been regarded as unique, were <b>thought,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> study,to represent a normal beach response to limited sediment supply and prevailing offshore conditions. Beach evolution was also modelled formally, the range of beach profiles exhibited on the Holderness coast being grouped into a number of distinct types, and evolution among them described and predicted by a first-order Markov model.

With these <b>thoughts</b> <b>in</b> mind <b>the</b> <b>present</b> writers decided, some four years ago, to investigate patients of this type for the presence of an active fungus infection.

40|$|This paper {{examined}} the epistemological empiricism conception of Ibn Taimiyyah and John Locke {{based on the}} comparative analysis to obtain the complete description of epistemological empiricism thought of both, {{as well as its}} implications and consequences for the development of science and religious thought. To obtain the detailed answer about the two figures thought, it would be revealed the similarities and differences of epistemological empiricism of each by showing the elements that became the focus of both studies. Furthermore, from those, it will be sought the strange and weaknesses, and possible relevance of the two thought to find a new alternative as a reflective systematic model for the development of science and religious <b>thought</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> and future. Comparing the empirical thought of both figures above is important to do, due to the empirical tradition in the two mens’ world have a very extreme differences. In the west, Empiricism had contributed significantly to the epistemological assets or legacy and had {{led to the development of}} science and technology. In contrast, empiricism in the east, was suspected as a harmful tradition to the Islamic ideology. It was considered as the seed that gave birth to atheism. Based on the two thinkers empiricism, will appear the strategic idea that can be synthesized to developed modern science as well as Islamic thought. Bot of epistemology thought can be combine to reconstruct the Islamic epistemology which is more open and more mature, because in that context will emerge the theories of knowledge without eliminating the metaphysical and ethical authority. In the context of combination, the natural tendency of foundation of Islamic teaching should be the bases of policy as descript by Ibnu Taimiyyah, that human nature becomes the foundation of the human responsibility in the end after and imposition of responsibility or duty, are the necessities to obey Allah order and to leave the Allah prohibition. The natural tendency is a gift from Allah that guides the human being to the right path. </p...|$|E

En primer lugar examina la evolución de la situación en América Latina en los últimos 20 años, mostrando como el paso de dictaduras a gobiernos elegidos democráticamente no necesariamente se reflejó en una mejoría en los derechos humanos. Luego de describir el funcionamiento de la Comisión y la Corte Interamericanas de Derechos Humanos, analiza dos tendencias presentes en el actual debate sobre el futuro del sistema interamericano. Una posición calificada como "promoción-reforma" entiende que el sistema debería orientarse hacia actividades exclusivamente de promoción de los derechos humanos antes que tareas de protección. Para ello proponen reformar la Convención Americana sobre Derechos Humanos. La segunda posición, la denomina "protección-perfeccionamiento" ya que sostiene que la realidad actual de América Latina, requiere que la Comisión y la Corte se dediquen fundamentalmente a la protección de los derechos humanos. Finalmente el artículo presenta cinco objetivos que deberían orientar el trabajo del sistema y muestra cómo las dos posiciones anteriormente mencionadas difieren en cuanto a estos objetivos o a la manera de alcanzarlos. ABSTRACT: The article analizes {{the current}} debate within the inter-American System of human rights. The article begins by {{describing}} {{the evolution of the}} human rights situation in Latin-America over the last 20 years, from military dictatorships to elected goverments. The article points out that these changes do not necessarily imply an improvement in the enjoyment of human rights. After describing the functioining of the Inter-American Commission and Court, the article. describes two different lines of <b>thought</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> debate regarding the future of the Inter-American System. The first position "promotion-reform" suggests that the inter-American system should deal exclusively with promotional activities rather than protection functions. To accomplish that end, those who favor this position propose the amendment of the American Convention on Human Rigths. The second position "protection-perfectioning" points out that the situation in Latin America requires the Commission and the Court to deal principally with the protection of human rights rather than promotional activities. Finally, the article presents five different objetives of the inter-American system that should guide its work. The author shows how each of the two positions on reform have different points of view regarding the objectives of the system and regarding the methods the inter- American System should adopt in pursuing them. </p...|$|E
40|$|An {{emerging}} {{theme in}} the analysis of the gait of people with Parkinson’s disease (PD) is that the kinetic features such as joint power generated during the events of ankle push-off and hip pull-off required for propulsion and progression of the lower limb is diminished inspite of PD medication. However, there is lack of sufficient evidence from the proponents of these PD gait deficiencies. Furthermore, it was <b>thought</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> study that the cause of reduced joint power (if observed) could be attributed to their preferred slow walking speed Therefore, the research presented in this thesis investigated the pull and push-off events at usual walking speed (in healthy and people with PD) and at fast walking speed (in PD) to examine and substantiate what the other studies suggested. The first part of the investigation into pull and push-off was to characterise and describe these gait events in healthy people whilst the second part was carried out on people affected with PD. A laboratory protocol/setup was designed for {{the first part of the}} study that was modified for use in the second part. Fourteen healthy adults (mean age 63. 6 ± 7 years) participated in the first (laboratory based) study. Their gait was measured using a camera based motion analysis system (Coda mpx 30) and a force platform that was situated on an 8 m walkway. A gait laboratory test session was conducted per subject and the result of gait components of pull and push-off powers, ankle and hip joint angular excursion and corresponding gait velocity, stride length and cadence were recorded. Similar laboratory sessions with modification to the protocol/set up were also conducted (after an initial home clinical assessment and screening) for people with PD (n= 11, mean age 66. 4 ± 5. 07 years, disease duration 6 ± 3. 1 years, motor UPDRS score 24. 3 ± 9. 98) walking at their usual and fast speeds during their on phase of PD medication. The results showed that the gait of healthy subjects and subjects with PD was not significantly different from each other. Some PD subjects had greater pull-off and push-off powers than healthy subjects whilst a relationship between hip pull-off power and ankle plantarflexion suggests a compensatory strategy being used by PD subjects. PD subjects were able to significantly walk fast when asked to do so, with increments in the gait components. The results suggests that reduced pull and push-off powers are not applicable to all cases of PD and inspite of any diminished gait features their capacity to walk fast was still preserved...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{relationship}} between automatic thoughts and emotions presented during sexual activity and their correlation with sexual arousal was investigated. A total of 491 individuals (163 women and 232 men without sexual problems and 47 women and 49 {{men with a}} DSM-IV diagnosis of sexual dysfunction) completed the Sexual Modes Questionnaire (SMQ; Nobre and Pinto-Gouveia, Journal of Sex Research, 40, 368 – 382, 2003). Results indicated several significant correlations among automatic thoughts, emotions, and sexual arousal. Erection concern <b>thoughts</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> men and failure/disengagement thoughts and lack of erotic <b>thoughts</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> women <b>presented</b> <b>the</b> most significant negative correlations with sexual arousal. Additionally, sadness and disillusion were positively related to these negative cognitions and negatively associated with sexual arousal in both sexes. On the other hand, pleasure and satisfaction were negatively associated with the above-mentioned negative cognitions and positively associated with subjective sexual arousal in both men and women. Overall, findings {{support the hypothesis that}} cognitive, emotional, and behavioral dimensions are closely linked and suggest a mode typical of sexual dysfunction composed of negative automatic thoughts, depressive affect, and low subjective sexual arousal.

40|$|Mind-wandering {{refers to}} the {{occurrence}} of thoughts whose content is both decoupled from stimuli <b>present</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> current environment and unrelated to the task being carried out {{at the moment of}} their occurrence. The core of this phenomenon is therefore stimulus-independent and task-unrelated <b>thoughts</b> (SITUTs). <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> study, we designed a novel experience sampling method which permitted to isolate SITUTs from other kinds of distractions (i. e., irrelevant interoceptive/exteroceptive sensory perceptions and interfering thoughts related to the appraisal of <b>the</b> current task). <b>In</b> Experiment 1, we examined the impact of SITUTs on the performance of the Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART; a Go/No-Go task). Analyses demonstrated that SITUTs impair SART performance to the same extent as irrelevant sensory perceptions. In Experiment 2, we further examined SITUTs in order to assess the possible functions of mind-wandering. We observed that the content of most of reported SITUTs {{refers to the}} anticipation and planning of future events. Furthermore, this "prospective bias" was increased when participants' attention had been oriented toward their personal goals before performing the SART. These data support the view that an important function of mind-wandering relates to the anticipation and planning of the future...|$|R
