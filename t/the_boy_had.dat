5|$|The Duke of York's {{passion for}} all things naval and {{military}} rubbed off on young Churchill. Often accompanying the Duke inspecting the troops in the royal parks, {{it was not long}} before <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>had</b> set his heart on becoming a soldier himself. On 14 September 1667 (O.S.), he obtained a commission as Ensign in the King's Own Company in the 1st Guards, later to become the Grenadier Guards.|$|E
5|$|The press {{surrounding}} the Barker case {{led to the}} first calls about the Boy in the Box. Frank Guthrum, who discovered <b>the</b> <b>boy,</b> <b>had</b> decided not {{to call the police}} until he listened to reports of the Barker case on his car radio.|$|E
5|$|According to Dr. Abed El-Razeq El Masry, the {{pathologist}} {{who examined}} Muhammed, <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>had</b> received a fatal {{injury to the}} abdomen. In 2002 he showed Esther Schapira, a German journalist, post-mortem images of Muhammad next to cards identifying him by name. Schapira also obtained, from a Palestinian journalist, {{what appeared to be}} footage of him arriving at the hospital on a stretcher. During an emotional public funeral in the Bureij refugee camp, Muhammad was wrapped in a Palestinian flag and buried before sundown on the day of his death, in accordance with Muslim tradition.|$|E

5|$|Cancellor {{was found}} dead in his bedroom on the morning of 22 April. His body was covered, with long {{stockings}} over his legs and kidskin gloves on his hands. The only visible part of the body was his face. A medical man of Hopley's acquaintance named Roberts pronounced that <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>had</b> died of natural causes. When questioned, Hopley suggested that Cancellor died of heart disease and argued that he should be buried immediately. He wrote to the boy's father requesting the body's immediate removal and interment. After viewing his son's dressed body, Cancellor's father accepted Roberts' assertion for cause of death and agreed to the burial.|$|E
5|$|Contradicting {{the noon}} and 3pm timelines, Mohammed Tawil, {{the doctor who}} {{admitted}} Muhammad to the Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, told Esther Schapira that <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>had</b> been admitted around 10:00am local time, along with the ambulance driver, who had been shot through the heart. Tawil later {{said that he could}} not recall what he had told reporters about this. Records from the Al-Shifa Hospital reportedly show that a young boy was examined in the pathology department at midday. The pathologist, Dr.Abed El-Razeq El Masry, examined him for half an hour. He told Schapira that the boy's abdominal organs were lying outside his body, and he showed Schapira , with a card identifying the boy as Muhammad. A watch on a pathologist's wrist in one of the images appeared to say 3:50.|$|E
5|$|In 1782, Prince Alfred was inoculated against smallpox. The {{sickness}} {{proved too}} much for the child and in June he was taken to Deal with his governess Lady Charlotte Finch to recover. It was hoped that the sea air, bathing in the water, and horseback riding would improve his condition. While he was there, Alfred endeared himself to many, including an old woman whom he waved to. In spite of his charming disposition, he continued to break out in spots and his chest was troubling him. When he returned to Windsor in August 1782, the doctors inspected him and realized that <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>had</b> only weeks to live. After suffering bouts of fever and continuing problems with his chest, Prince Alfred died on 20 August 1782, at Windsor Castle, Berkshire, not even two years old.|$|E

5|$|Three years later, Jordan Chandler's alleged {{account of}} the {{relationship}} was detailed in a book by journalist Victor M. Gutierrez. The book {{was said to be}} based on a diary <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>had</b> kept at the time and included details of alleged sexual encounters between Jackson and him. In 1995, Jackson filed a civil suit against Gutierrez for slander; the jury found in Jackson's favor, awarding him $2.7 million in damages. However, that suit was unrelated to the book and the judgement does not serve to refute the allegations contained within. In 1996, Evan Chandler sued Jackson for around $60 million, claiming Jackson had breached an agreement never to discuss the case. In 1999, a court ruled in Jackson's favor and threw out the lawsuit.|$|E
5|$|With no way {{of knowing}} where <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>had</b> been taken—Momolo found out only in early July—the Mortaras, {{supported}} by the Jewish communities in Bologna, Rome and elsewhere in Italy, initially focused on drafting appeals and trying to rally support from Jews abroad. The greatly expanded public voice wielded by Jews in western European countries following recent moves towards freedom of the press, coupled with Jewish political emancipation in the Kingdom of Sardinia, Britain, France and the United States, caused Mortara's removal to gain press attention far beyond anything previously given to such incidents. The papal government was initially disposed to simply ignore Momolo's appeals, but reconsidered after newspapers began reporting on the case; the pontifical state's many detractors seized on the episode as an example of papal tyranny.|$|E

25|$|On 14 July 2004 {{a mother}} {{appealed to the}} Missouri Supreme Court to prevent the {{circumcision}} of her son after a county court and the Court of Appeals had denied her a writ of prohibition.

25|$|In an Italian Mickey Mouse story (Topolino E La Piramide Impossible), Mickey and Goofy {{travel back}} in time and by {{accident}} a young boy followed them back to the present. <b>The</b> <b>boy</b> <b>had</b> {{to go back to his}} own time and his memory of the future was erased, but before that he grabbed pieces of books. The boy of course became Nostradamus and the ripped pages from books explained his visions of the future. The story was made by Massimo Marconi and Massimo De Vita.|$|E
25|$|He {{remained}} at Bologna {{in the care}} of a pork butcher while his father played the horn in the orchestras of the theatres at which his wife sang. <b>The</b> <b>boy</b> <b>had</b> three years of instruction in the playing of the harpsichord from Giuseppe Prinetti, originally from Novara, who played the scale with two fingers only; Prinetti also owned a business selling beer and had a propensity to fall asleep while standing.

25|$|Septimius Severus {{grew up in}} {{the town}} of Leptis Magna. He spoke the local Punic {{language}} fluently and possibly the Berber language too, but he was also educated in Latin and Greek, which he spoke with a slight accent. Little else is known of the young Severus' education, but according to Cassius Dio <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>had</b> been eager for more education than he had actually got. Presumably Severus received lessons in oratory: at age 17 he gave his first public speech.|$|E
