25|$|On January 11, a Mississippi judge {{temporarily}} {{blocked the}} release of 21 inmates who had been given pardons or medical release.

Hood also criticized Barbour for failing to notify or speak with the families of victims before granting the pardons. He responded to criticism of his actions, saying that 90% of those involved had already been released from prison, many years earlier; he acted in order to allow them to find employment, get professional licenses, vote and hunt. He also stated that in 90% of the cases his decision was based on recommendations of <b>the</b> <b>parole</b> <b>board.</b>|$|E
