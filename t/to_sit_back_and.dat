5|$|The opening {{passages}} {{of the match}} were tentative. Faced with a hostile atmosphere, Liverpool were content <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> frustrate Roma. Despite this tactic, Liverpool {{took the lead in}} the 15th minute. Souness and Sammy Lee exchanged passes before passing to Craig Johnston on the right hand side of the pitch. Johnston played a high cross into the Roma penalty area, which was challenged for by Roma goalkeeper Franco Tancredi and Ronnie Whelan. The result was that Tancredi dropped the ball, Roma defenders tried to clear the ball, but Michele Nappi's attempted clearance bounced off Tancredi's back and fell to Liverpool defender Phil Neal who scored to give Liverpool a 1–0 lead. Two minutes later, Souness volleyed the ball into the Roma goal from close range, but his goal was disallowed for offside.|$|E
25|$|The land {{upon which}} the city was built, as well {{as much of the}} {{surrounding}} area, was obtained by Englishman Thomas Fenwick from the Native Americans. In 1869, businessman Isaac Coffin built the first beach-front cottage to receive paying guests. During those days, people arrived by stage coach and ferry. They came to fish off the shore, to enjoy the natural beauty of the Atlantic Ocean pounding against the long strip of sandy beach, to collect seashells, or just <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> watch the rolling surf.|$|E
25|$|The {{trail that}} splits from the {{snowmobile}} route {{a mile from}} the Platte Clove trailhead curves back another mile or so to Huckleberry Point, a steep and ledgy area which, due to past fires, offers many places <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> look down into the clove. Since the route is mostly level, and the roundtrip considerably shorter than that required for the whole mountain, it is popular with those who hike only occasionally. Care must be taken at the Point, however, since some of the ledges also sit above sharp drops.|$|E

Tony asks her what is wrong, but she persuades him <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>back</b> down <b>and</b> {{continue}} the session. Tony asks Melfi {{if she wants to}} tell him something. After a tense pause, Melfi says, [...] "No." ...|$|R
25|$|Dispensability in a {{group is}} {{described}} by Price as employees who join a work group and quickly begin to measure up their skills with {{the people that they}} are assigned to work with. If they feel that their skills are inferior to those around them, people tend <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> let the other more skilled workers carry the workload. Fairness {{in a group}} is when some group members feel that their voice is not heard in decision making because of their ethnicity, gender or other discriminatory factors. Instead of fighting for their voice to be heard many group members will decide to loaf in these circumstances.|$|E
25|$|During {{the late}} 1980s, Courtney {{was part of}} a {{movement}} within the UDA that became frustrated with the directions being taken by the UDA leadership. He argued that too little was being done by the movement in terms of killing republicans as the leaders were too happy <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> become rich from extortion and racketeering. Courtney was soon involved in conspiracies to overthrow the UDA leadership. These however came to nothing as the fallout from the Stevens Inquiries saw the existing leadership swept aside. For his part, Courtney would go on {{to become part of the}} new leadership that emerged in the 1990s around Johnny Adair.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} year, Wang Jian was recalled to lead {{a second}} invasion with 600,000 men. High in morale after their victory in the previous year, the Chu forces were content <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> defend against what they {{expected to be a}} siege of Chu. However, Wang Jian decided to weaken Chu's resolve and tricked the Chu army by appearing to be idle in his fortifications whilst secretly training his troops to fight in Chu territory. After a year, the Chu defenders decided to disband due to apparent lack of action from the Qin. Wang Jian invaded at that point, with full force, and overran Huaiyang and the remaining Chu forces. Chu lost the initiative and could only sustain local guerrilla-style resistance until it too was fully conquered with the destruction of Shouchun and the death of its last leader, Lord Changping, in 223 BC. At their peak, the combined armies of Chu and Qin are estimated to have ranged from hundreds of thousands to a million soldiers, more than those involved in the campaign of Changping between Qin and Zhao 35 years earlier.|$|E
5000|$|Vicki Vann {{songs are}} beautifully crafted to reflect an effortless, dynamic, and {{soothing}} voice that displays {{an artist who}} is deeply rooted in traditional sounds as well as current country music trends.

[...] Vicki Vann is one of country music’s hottest new artists.|$|R
3000|$|What’s {{been good}} {{is that it}} was different… it allowed people <b>to</b> sort of <b>sit</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> go well this isn’t how lectures usually run. So it did capture everyone’s {{attention}} straight away. (Student 1) [...]...|$|R

500|$|Weird Al {{also got}} me. He made a video, did a fake {{interview}} with me, spliced it with clips from my old interviews, {{and put it}} up on the Internet. He's a very funny motherfucker. When something like that happens, you have <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> say, [...] "Oh, he got me." [...] It's something you pick up from battles: you learn to be a good sport about a lot of stuff. If you want to dish it out, you've {{got to be able to}} take it.|$|E
500|$|Nutter said of {{the episode}} [...] "I really worked hard {{to make it a}} special show, because I thought it was special. It was Gillian's {{post-traumatic}} stress episode, because she had not really had the opportunity to vent her feelings about the whole Duane Barry situation. This was an opportunity <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> let all that happen." [...] Carter particularly liked the scene where a clearly disturbed Scully hugs Mulder, claiming it was a [...] "tender moment" [...] between two characters that had not shown that much affection for each other.|$|E
500|$|Hours {{following}} the second concert, {{the attacks on}} the World Trade Center in New York City, the Pentagon outside of Washington, D.C., and a crash near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, resulted in the loss of 2,993 lives. Following the events of September 11, Jackson rewrote [...] "What More Can I Give" [...] and expressed his views on the song, writing and music. [...] "I'm not one <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> say, 'Oh, I feel bad for what happened to them I want the whole world to sing , to bring us together as a world, because a song is a mantra, something you repeat over and over.

5000|$|In 1935 Kanae {{settled in}} Tokyo and {{returned}} to painting full-time. He produced a number of oils and watercolours that were exhibited in January 1940 at the Mitsukoshi gallery. The show was well received and attended, and in a dinner that followed Kanae proclaimed, [...] "I shall live until May of my eighty-fifth year. Therefore, I am going <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>back</b> now, <b>and</b> drink sake, and paint to my heart's content." ...|$|R
25|$|A djembe and dunun {{ensemble}} traditionally {{does not}} play music for people <b>to</b> simply <b>sit</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> listen <b>to.</b> Instead, the ensemble creates rhythm {{for people to}} dance, sing, clap, or work to. The western distinction between musicians and audience is inappropriate in a traditional context. A rhythm is rarely played as a performance, but is participatory: musicians, dancers, singers, and onlookers {{are all part of}} the ensemble and frequently change roles while the music is in progress.|$|R
50|$|The {{early stages}} of the Third Reich's {{expansion}} plans consisted of a series of annexations of territory where {{the majority of the population}} were culturally German. This started with the March 1938 Anschluss, the annexation of Austria. Next on the list came the Sudetenland, a portion of western Czechoslovakia. Czechoslovakia was not interested in giving it up, and unlike the Austrian example, it did not look like France and the United Kingdom were going <b>to</b> simply <b>sit</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> watch. Suddenly the possibility of a military confrontation looked very real.|$|R
500|$|Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club {{praised the}} episode for {{highlighting}} {{each of its}} characters, all of whom he said were at their best except for April, who he said seemed {{out of place in}} the camping storyline. He also said he was glad Ann's recent breakup with Chris [...] "has allowed her true colors to shine through". Matt Richenthal of TV Fanatic called it a [...] "tremendously enjoyable episode" [...] and [...] "mostly just a chance <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> spend time with these goofy, lovable individuals". He praised the new storyline for Ann Perkins, claiming it created more comedic potential for Jones. Matt Fowler of IGN praised the performance of Rashida Jones and Chris Pratt, and called Leslie's stress over failing {{to come up with a}} new idea a [...] "great little story". Alan Sepinwall of HitFix said [...] "Camping" [...] was not as funny as previous third season episodes but was still an enjoyable episode that he found more [...] "slow and contemplative", which he found indicative of the fact that the series was still on a strong track.|$|E
500|$|After half time, Dortmund {{were handed}} a {{way back into}} the match when Márcio Amoroso was brought down by Patrick Paauwe. Paauwe was spared Kohler's fate as he only {{received}} a yellow card. Amoroso scored the following penalty and the score was 2–1. Two minutes later, Amoroso was cautioned for diving in an attempt to win another spot kick. Just three minutes after Dortmund scored, Jon Dahl Tomasson who was playing his last game for Feyenoord before his move to Milan, [...] scored after beating the offside trap, and being put through by Shinji Ono. Dortmund once again found a {{way back into the}} match when Jan Koller volleyed home his shot from 25 metres on 58 minutes, after capitalizing on a weak defensive header. [...] Dortmund now assumed the ascendancy with attack after attack, whilst Feyenoord seemed content <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> try to see the game out. Dortmund tried everything to find the equaliser replacing Lars Ricken with Jörg Heinrich, and Ewerthon was replaced by Otto Addo, however it was to no avail as Feyenoord saw the game out to win 3–2 and continue their streak of never losing a European final.|$|E
500|$|By early 1972, Labor had {{established}} a clear lead in the polls; indeed, {{for the first time}} since 1955 its support was greater than the combined vote for the Coalition and DLP. Unemployment was at a ten-year peak, rising to 2.14percent in August (though the unemployment rate was calculated differently compared to the present, and did not include thousands of rural workers on Commonwealth-financed relief work). Inflation was also at its highest rate since the early 1950s. The government recovered slightly in the August Budget session of Parliament, proposing income tax cuts and increased spending. The Labor strategy for the run-up to the election was <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> allow the Coalition to make mistakes. Whitlam controversially stated in March that [...] "draft-dodging is not a crime" [...] and that he would be open to a revaluation of the Australian dollar. With the Coalition sinking in the polls and his own personal approval ratings down as low as 28 percent, McMahon waited as long as he could, finally calling an election for the House of Representatives for 2 December. Whitlam noted that the polling day was the anniversary of the Battle of Austerlitz – at which another [...] "ramshackle, reactionary coalition" [...] had been given a [...] "crushing defeat".|$|E

But as soon as Kev started his sketch the Prince decided <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>back</b> down <b>and</b> watch the full act. So impressed was he that instead of rushing off at the end he stayed even longer to congratulate Kev in person. Prince Philip {{was quoted as saying}} [...] "It’s a wonderful show.

50|$|Oldhead {{with his}} glasses and beard, grumpy and blasé, is quite happy <b>to</b> simply <b>sit</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> watch Marwin and Shorthead beating the living daylights out of each other. He often does this from his laboratory, where he invents various dooms-day {{machines}} and more or less necessary gadgets to reform the world. Like the others, he {{has been shown to}} be able of extreme greed, malice and violent outbursts, putting others on the line if it benefits his research. Much like Shorthead, however, he's been shown to be very compassionate and kind, even towards meathead. These instances are few and far between, though.|$|R
5000|$|Loews Theatres, {{also known}} as Loews Incorporated (originally Loew's), founded on June 23, 1904 by Marcus Loew, was the oldest theater chain {{operating}} in North America until it merged with AMC Theatres on January 26, 2006. From 1924 until 1959, {{it was also the}} parent company of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios. The Loews name is still used by AMC in many markets. Its slogan was [...] "Thank you for coming <b>to</b> Loews, <b>sit</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> relax, enjoy the show!!!", which was used in the chain's theater policy ads from the 1980s through the 1990s, when Sony rebranded the chain.|$|R
500|$|The {{production}} of Black Ice was delayed for several reasons. AC/DC left their label Atlantic Records, {{signed a deal}} with Sony Music and changed labels within Sony from Epic Records to Columbia Records. Bass guitarist Cliff Williams suffered an injury to his hand in 2005 {{and was unable to}} play for 18 months. While Williams was recovering, the Young brothers perfected the songs they had written. Angus revealed that there was no pressure from Sony for the band to release a new album, as the label was releasing DVDs and remasters of the AC/DC catalogue, and thus the group [...] "could afford <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> say we'll do another album when we think we've got all the goods." [...] In a 2004 interview, vocalist Brian Johnson said that Angus had written harder riffs than those on Stiff Upper Lip and that he would be writing song lyrics {{for the first time since}} the band's 1988 album Blow Up Your Video, but his input would end up minimal, with all tracks on Black Ice credited to the Youngs. Johnson explained that the brothers had done most of the lyrical job, and his collaboration was that he [...] "helped with melody and just filling in gaps that I thought needed filling in".|$|E
500|$|In April 1997, {{the band}} convened at Buck's Kauai {{vacation}} home to record demos of material {{intended for the}} next album. The band sought to reinvent its sound and intended to incorporate drum loops and percussion experiments. Just as the sessions were due to begin in October, Berry decided, after months of contemplation and discussions with Downs and Mills, to tell {{the rest of the}} band that he was quitting. Berry told his bandmates that he would not quit if they would break up as a result, so Stipe, Buck, and Mills agreed to carry on as a three-piece with his blessing. Berry publicly announced his departure three weeks later in October 1997. Berry told the press, [...] "I'm just not as enthusiastic as I {{have been in the past}} about doing this anymore [...] [...] [...] I have the best job in the world. But I'm kind of ready <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> reflect and maybe not be a pop star anymore." [...] Stipe admitted that the band would be different without a major contributor: [...] "For me, Mike, and Peter, as R.E.M., are we still R.E.M.? I guess a three-legged dog is still a dog. It just has to learn to run differently." ...|$|E
2500|$|One aspect Bellisario {{wanted to}} change {{was the way the}} {{character}} would interact with Tony.

50|$|During the boardroom, Alla and Felisha, again, argue, causing Felisha {{to break}} into tears. This {{occurred}} despite their supposed friendship. Trump told Alla that she was unmanageable, citing that Alla acts like a bully even though Felisha is nice to her. Felisha {{was the only one}} expected to be fired, but when Alla attempted to escape from the boardroom right after Felisha was fired, Trump told her <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>back</b> down <b>and</b> fired her as well. Ironically, prior to the boardroom, Felisha had given serious consideration to resigning rather than allowing herself to be fired, as she did not think Trump was likely to fire Alla, but Alla's verbal attacks motivated Felisha into defending herself.|$|R
2500|$|The differing {{marketing}} {{choices of}} the groups contributed to the conflict. Zong is resentful that Danone was happy just <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> collect money, and wanted {{to stop him from}} investing: [...] "Whenever we wanted to expand the business, they said no. They refused to invest more. But they let us spend the money and then when the ventures made money they wanted in," [...] he says.|$|E

In an October 2013 interview, Green stated that he preferred [...] "great interviewers who know when <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> listen" [...] rather than being an interviewer that [...] "wanted to be as funny as the guest and...get {{into a sort of}} competitive relationship with them".|$|E

5000|$|In {{all of the}} band's early performances, guitarists Marc Miller and Natalio Fowler both {{stood on}} large black boxes (or pedestals) towering over the audiences, {{a nod to the}} superiority {{complexes}} of rock bands. They would occasionally step down from the boxes to walk into the audience and stand in front of individuals in the crowd (while still playing) in an attempt to make them feel uncomfortable. This was later aided by the much self-publicized acquisition of wireless guitars. Drummer Christopher Freeland would intermittently get up from his set and barge around the stage, mumbling incoherent babble, only <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>back</b> down <b>and</b> lunge into another song. Miller and Fowler are noted for having the birth and death dates of Jimi Hendrix respectively.|$|R
