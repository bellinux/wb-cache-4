5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{was first}} observed near 50°W on August29. Later that day, reconnaissance aircraft flight reported a wind shirt and above average shower and thunderstorm activity, but no low-level circulation. At 0600UTC on August30, a tropical depression developed {{just east of}} the Lesser Antilles. Six hours later, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Ella. The storm moved through the Leeward Islands and entered the Caribbean Sea late on August30. A reconnaissance aircraft into Ella reported sustained winds between 55 and 60mph (95km/h). It was around <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> the Weather Bureau Office in San Juan, Puerto Rico began issuing bulletins and advisories. Ella strengthened into a Category1 hurricane at 1200UTC on August31, six hours later, before becoming a Category2 hurricane. On September1, Ella curved west-northwestward, and by later that day, made landfall on the Tiburon Peninsula of Haiti with winds of 110mph (175km/h). However, the storm was operationally thought to have remained offshore.|$|E

5|$|In the {{periodic}} table published by Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869, thorium and the rare-earth elements were placed outside {{the main body of}} the table, at the end of each vertical period after the alkaline earth metals. This reflected the belief at <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> thorium and the rare-earth metals were divalent. With the later recognition that the rare earths were mostly trivalent and thorium was tetravalent, Mendeleev moved cerium and thorium to group IV in 1871, which contained the modern carbon group (group 14), titanium group (group 4), cerium, and thorium, because their maximum oxidation state was +4. Cerium was soon removed from {{the main body of the}} table and placed in a separate lanthanide series; thorium was left with group 4 as it had similar properties to its supposed lighter congeners in that group, such as titanium and zirconium.|$|E
5|$|Pronovost {{appeared}} in 70 {{games for the}} Maple Leafs in 1967–68 and recorded 20 points, but he was held to only 34 games the following season. He missed {{the majority of the}} season to injury, and it was at <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> Maple Leafs president Conn Stafford Smythe suggested Pronovost should be installed as a player-coach of one of Toronto's minor league affiliates. He was offered a position with the Tulsa Oilers of the Central Hockey League (CHL), and though initially reluctant to go, the Oilers organization was able to convince Pronovost and his wife to move to the Oklahoma city. He played and coached for much of the year in Tulsa, but was briefly recalled back to Toronto part way through the 1969–70 NHL season. He recorded one assist in seven games with Toronto, the last of his NHL career.|$|E
5|$|The next Gilbert and Sullivan opera, Patience, {{opened at}} the Opera Comique in April 1881 and was another big success, usurping Pinafore's {{position}} as the longest running piece in the series with the second-longest run in musical theatre history. Patience satirised the self-indulgent aesthetic movement of the 1870s and '80s in England. To popularise the opera in America, in 1882 Carte sent one of the artistes under his management, the young poet Oscar Wilde, on a lecture tour to explain to Americans what the aesthetic movement was about. Carte told an interviewer at <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> he had fifteen theatrical companies and performers touring simultaneously in Europe, America and Australia.|$|E

Several other television roles were to follow including appearances on Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre and The Alfred Hitchcock Hour.

5|$|As {{the city}} of Kraków began to expand further {{under the rule of}} the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the new {{architectural}} styles also developed. Key buildings from the 19th and early 20th centuries in Kraków include the Jan Matejko Academy of Fine Arts, the directorate of the Polish State Railways as well as the original complex of Kraków Główny railway station and the city's Academy of Economics. It was also at around <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> Kraków's first radial boulevards began to appear, with the city undergoing a large-scale program aimed at transforming the ancient Polish capital into a sophisticated regional centre of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. New representative government buildings and multi-story tenement houses were built at around that time. Much of the urban-planning beyond the walls of the Old Town was done by Polish architects and engineers trained in Vienna. Some major projects of the era include the development of the Jagiellonian University's new premises and the building of the Collegium Novum just west of the Old Town. The imperial style planning of the city's further development continued until the return of Poland's independence, following the First World War. Early modernist style in Kraków is represented by such masterpieces as the Palace of Art by Franciszek Mączyński and the 'House under the Globe'. Secession style architecture, which had arrived in Kraków from Vienna, became popular {{towards the end of the}} Partitions.|$|E
5|$|Because Stuyvesant was {{so close}} to the World Trade Center site, there were {{concerns}} of asbestos exposure. The US EPA indicated at <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> Stuyvesant was safe from asbestos, and conducted a thorough cleaning of the Stuyvesant building, but the Stuyvesant High School Parents' Association has contested the accuracy of the assessment. Some problems, including former teacher Mark Bodenheimer's respiratory problems, have been reported—he accepted a transfer to The Bronx High School of Science after having difficulty continuing his work at Stuyvesant. Other isolated cases include Stuyvesant's 2002 Class President Amit Friedlander, who received local press coverage in September 2006 after he was diagnosed with cancer. While there have been other cases linked to the same dust cloud that emanated from Ground Zero, a spot precariously close to Stuyvesant, there is no definitive evidence that such cases have directly affected the Stuyvesant community. Stuyvesant students did spend a full year in the building before the theater and air systems were cleaned, however, and a group of Stuyvesant alumni is currently lobbying for health insurance as a result.|$|E

5|$|Upon being classified, the {{disturbance}} had a broad circulation that {{was difficult to}} locate, with moderate convection in its eastern periphery. The thunderstorms organized further, and MFR upgraded {{the disturbance}} to a tropical depression at 0000UTC on February19. Three hours later, the JTWC began issuing advisories on Tropical Cyclone 16S, and at 0600UTC that day, MFR upgraded the depression to a moderate tropical storm after an advanced scatterometer indicated winds of over 65km/h (40mph); as a result, the National Weather Service of Madagascar gave it the name Haruna. By that time, the circulation had become better organized with increased rainbands, and with an anticyclone aloft, the storm developed well-defined outflow. The structure of Haruna continued to become more symmetrical with a large radius of maximum winds, developing a ragged eye early on February20. Based on the improved appearance, MFR upgraded Haruna to a severe tropical storm at 0000UTC that day. About 12hours later, the agency upgraded Haruna further to tropical cyclone status, with 10minute winds of 120km/h (75mph). That day, an approaching trough weakened the ridge to the south, causing the cyclone to slow and move erratically. While Haruna was approaching the southwestern coast of Madagascar, it developed a 120km (75mi) wide eye, and the eyewall passed over Europa Island. Initially, MFR estimated that the storm would intensify to intense tropical cyclone status, and the agency assessed that Haruna reached 10minute winds of 150km/h (90mph) on February20. The next day, JTWC estimated peak 1minute winds of 185km/h (115mph). In contrast, MFR estimated at <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> the cyclone had peaked when the eyewall thunderstorms warmed, followed by the eye becoming less organized and the winds decreasing.|$|E
