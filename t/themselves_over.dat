Evidence for the Sevier Orogeny part of this period {{can be seen in}} the Taylor Creek area in the Kolob section of the park. Chunks of Moenave strata have been compressed to the point of thrusting <b>themselves</b> <b>over</b> the same formation in the Taylor Creek Thrust Fault Zone, located on the east flank of the Kanarra anticline.|$|E
5|$|Females {{predominantly}} scent mark {{with their}} anogenital scent glands, by squatting to rub their anogenital region along horizontal surfaces, such as tree limbs. Males, {{on the other}} hand, favor using the glands on their neck, muzzle, and chest, by embracing horizontal and vertical surfaces and rubbing <b>themselves</b> <b>over</b> them. Both sexes will occasionally scent mark in ways characteristic of the opposite sex.|$|E
5|$|By {{virtue of}} this variety and his interfusion of Western, Indian folk and Carnatic elements, Ilaiyaraaja's {{compositions}} {{appeal to the}} Indian rural dweller for its rhythmic folk qualities, the Indian classical music enthusiast for the employment of Carnatic Ragas, and the urbanite for its modern, Western-music sound. Ilaiyaraaja's sense of visualization for composing music is always to match up with the storyline of the running movie and possibly by doing so, he creates the best experience for the audience to feel the emotions flavored through his musical score. He mastered this art of blending music to the narration, which very few others managed to adapt <b>themselves</b> <b>over</b> a longer time.|$|E

5|$|Marx's {{ideas have}} had a {{profound}} impact on world politics and intellectual thought. Followers of Marx have frequently debated amongst <b>themselves</b> <b>over</b> how to interpret Marx's writings and apply his concepts to the modern world. The legacy of Marx's thought has become contested between numerous tendencies, each of which sees itself as Marx's most accurate interpreter. In the political realm, these tendencies include Leninism, Marxism–Leninism, Trotskyism, Maoism, Luxemburgism and libertarian Marxism. Various currents have also developed in academic Marxism, often under influence of other views, resulting in structuralist Marxism, historical Marxism, phenomenological Marxism, analytical Marxism and Hegelian Marxism.|$|E
5|$|The {{field of}} the stadium {{combines}} a number of elements {{for use in the}} jumping and throwing events. The long jump and triple jump areas comprise a straight, narrow 40-metre running track with a sandpit at one or both ends. Jumps are measured from a take off board—typically a small strip of wood with a plasticine marker attached—which ensures athletes jump from behind the measurement line. The pole vault area is also a 40-metre running track and has an indentation in the ground (the box) where vaulters plant their poles to propel <b>themselves</b> <b>over</b> a crossbar before falling onto cushioned landing mats. The high jump is a stripped down version of this, with an open area of track or field that leads to a crossbar with a square area of landing mats behind it.|$|E
5|$|One {{member of}} the Lord Nelson class was {{involved}} in {{what could have been}} a major accident on 23 January 1930.

No. 860 Lord Hawke was derailed at , Hampshire on 14 August 1940 due to enemy action. a bomb fell on the track ahead of the train, which was unable to stop in time. No. 852 received a direct hit from an enemy bomb on 18 April 1941, and was so severely damaged that it was not returned to service until June 1942. No. 854 suffered a firebox failure due to lack of water 23 April 1945, killing the fireman and injuring the driver. No. 851 Sir Walter Raleigh was involved in a serious derailment at Byfleet in December 1946, due to the poor condition of the permanent way. On 26 November 1947, No. 860 Lord Hawke was hauling a passenger train that was run into by another at , Hampshire due to a signalman's error. Two people were killed. No. 30854 Howard of Effingham was hauling a passenger train that overran signals and was derailed by trap points at , Hampshire on 20 July 1952.|$|E

5|$|In Paris, Zajączek {{quickly became}} {{involved}} with the active emigre groups there. Hoping to sway revolutionary France into supporting the Polish cause, many Poles, including him, volunteered to join the French Revolutionary Army, eventually leading {{to the creation of}} the Polish Legions in Italy led by Jan Henryk Dąbrowski, which became a part of Napoleon's army. On 8 March 1797 Napoleon ordered that Zajączek should be recognized as an active brigade general of the French army. That year he published a brochure on his experiences of the 1794 war, Histoire de la révolution de Pologne en 1794, in which he tried to justify his actions. Zajączek was, however, still unpopular among the Polish troops, many of whom blamed him for the fall of Praga; due to frequent personal conflicts, Zajączek chose to remain with the French army, rather than joining the Legions <b>themselves.</b> <b>Over</b> the coming years, he took part in the French Revolutionary Wars. He took part in the 1798 Egyptian Expedition. There he also served as a governor of several provinces, first, from July that year, of the Monufia Governorate, later, from January 1799, simultaneously of the Faiyum Governorate and Beni Suef Governorate. On 25 January 1800 he defeated Murad Bey at the Battle of Sédiman. In 1801 he was promoted to division general, and later took part in the failed defense of Alexandria.|$|E

25|$|The {{forests of}} conifers, principally of Norway spruce, are in {{particular}} {{present in the}} south of the park, around Tinäset, on the isle of Torrön and the peninsula of Öbyhalvön. These forests have not been logged since the 1950s and certain trees are <b>themselves</b> <b>over</b> 120 years old. These old trees as well as the presence of dead wood give this forest a very ancient appearance, and contribute to a great richness of lichens and fungi. The soil is often covered in moss, the characteristic species being Hylocomium splendens, but Anastrophyllum hellerianum and Nowellia curvifolia are also common. One can also find European blueberries and lingonberries in the undergrowth.|$|E
25|$|The Gundestrup {{cauldron}} {{was discovered}} by peat cutters in a small peat bog called Rævemose (near the larger Borremose bog) on 28 May 1891. The Danish government paid a large reward to the finders, who subsequently quarreled bitterly amongst <b>themselves</b> <b>over</b> its division. Palaeobotanical investigations of the peat bog {{at the time of}} the discovery showed that the land had been dry when the cauldron was deposited, and the peat gradually grew over it. The manner of stacking suggested an attempt to make the cauldron inconspicuous and well-hidden. Another investigation of Rævemose was undertaken in 2002, concluding that the peat bog may have existed when the cauldron was buried.|$|E
25|$|The Japanese {{could have}} {{wiped out the}} 17th Division, but they did not.

Later on 22 February, survivors of the 17th Division swam and ferried <b>themselves</b> <b>over</b> the Sittang in broad daylight. After smaller actions at the Battle of Pegu and Taukkyan Roadblock, the Japanese went on to take Rangoon unopposed, on 9 March. Fortunately for the survivors of 17th Division, they had dismantled their roadblocks, so those Indians who had escaped Sittang Bridge were able to slip away to the north.|$|E

25|$|Modern steel ties handle heavy loads, have {{a proven}} record of {{performance}} in signalized track, and handle adverse track conditions.

Steel ties are utilized in nearly all sectors of the worldwide railroad systems including heavy-haul, class 1s, regional, shortlines, mining, electrified passenger lines (OHLE) and all manner of industries. Notably, steel ties (bearers) have proven <b>themselves</b> <b>over</b> the last few decades to be advantageous in turnouts (switches) and provide the solution to the ever-growing problem of long timber ties for such use.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the Akkadians {{and their}} descendants, the Assyrians, whose Anatolian {{possessions}} were peripheral to their core lands in Mesopotamia, the Hittites were centred at Hattusa (modern Boğazkale) in north-central Anatolia by the 17th century BC. They were speakers of an Indo-European language, the Hittite language, or nesili (the language of Nesa) in Hittite. Attested {{for the first}} time in the Assyrian tablets of Nesa around 2000BC, they conquered Hattusa in the 18th century BC, imposing <b>themselves</b> <b>over</b> Hattian- and Hurrian-speaking populations. According to the widely accepted Kurgan theory on the Proto-Indo-European homeland, however, the Hittites (along with the other Indo-European ancient Anatolians) were themselves relatively recent immigrants to Anatolia from the north.|$|E
