5|$|Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen {{described}} the controversy as Denmark's worst international relations incident since the Second World War. The incident {{came at a}} time of heightened political and social tensions between Muslim majority countries and Western countries, following several, high-profile Islamic terrorist attacks in the Westincluding the September 11 attacksand Western military interventions in Muslim countries, such as Iraq and Afghanistan. <b>The</b> <b>cartoons</b> and the reaction to them aggravated already-strained relations. The relationship between Muslims in Denmark and the broader society was similarly at a low-point, and the conflict came to symbolise the misunderstandings between the Islamic community and the rest of society. In the years since, terrorist plots claiming to be in retaliation for <b>the</b> <b>cartoons</b> have been planned, and some executed, against targets affiliated with newspapers that published <b>the</b> <b>cartoons</b> or Denmark.|$|E
5|$|Supporters {{said that}} the {{publication}} of <b>the</b> <b>cartoons</b> was a legitimate exercise of free speech regardless {{of the validity of}} the expression, {{that it was important to}} openly discuss Islam without fear or that <b>the</b> <b>cartoons</b> made important points about topical issues. The Danish tradition of relatively high tolerance for freedom of speech became a focus of some attention. The controversy ignited a debate about the limits of freedom of expression in all societies, religious tolerance and the relationship of Muslim minorities with their broader societies in the West, and relations between the Islamic World in general and the West. Critics of <b>the</b> <b>cartoons</b> described them as Islamophobic, racist, or baiting and blasphemous to Muslims, possibly intended to humiliate a Danish minority. Others saw them as a manifestation of ignorance about the history of Western imperialism, double standards, and stereotyping.|$|E
5|$|Among others, Iran's {{supreme leader}} Ayatollah Ali Khamenei blamed a Zionist {{conspiracy}} for the row over <b>the</b> <b>cartoons.</b> Palestinian Christian diplomat Afif Safieh, then the Palestine Liberation Organization's envoy to Washington, alleged the Likud party concocted {{the distribution of}} Muhammad caricatures worldwide {{in a bid to}} create a clash between the West and the Muslim world.|$|E

5|$|The 12 {{cartoons}} {{were drawn}} by 12 professional cartoonists in Denmark.

5|$|The French satirical weekly {{newspaper}} Charlie Hebdo {{was taken to}} court for publishing the cartoons; it was acquitted of charges that it incited hatred.

5|$|The {{incident}} {{occurred at a}} time of unusually strained relations between the Muslim world and the West. This was a result of decades of Muslim immigration to Europe, recent political struggles, violent incidents such as September 11 and a string of Islamist terrorist attacks and Western interventions in Muslim countries. <b>The</b> <b>cartoons</b> were used as a tool by different political interests {{in a wide variety of}} local and international situations. Some debate surrounded the relationship between Islamic minorities and their broader societies, and the legal and moral limits that the press should observe when commenting on that minority or any religious minority group.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>cartoon</b> states that, annually, 118,481 babies out of 2 {{million will}} die before {{reaching}} their first birthday. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>cartoon</b> shows John E.

Before <b>the</b> <b>cartoon</b> ends, however, it returns to John as a baby, reminding the audience that John needs proper healthcare to survive. <b>The</b> <b>cartoon</b> then states that if every American paid just three cents a week, sufficient healthcare could be provided for John and babies everywhere.|$|R

5|$|Fox {{negotiated}} a deal which would prove extremely lucrative for Groening, {{in which he}} retained {{a large portion of}} revenue from merchandising. To animate the short segments, Brooks and company settled on Klasky Csupo, a small animation house who offered to produce <b>the</b> <b>cartoons</b> cheaply. Brooks initially just wanted to animate the shorts through the basic line drawings, and Klasky-Csupo offered color for the same cost. The studio only employed three young animators—CalArts graduates Bill Kopp, Wes Archer, and David Silverman—who adapted Groening's scripts for animation in one week, doing layouts, animation and inbetweening by hand in the very short amount of time. Groening submitted only basic sketches to the three, and assumed that the figures would be cleaned-up in production. However, the animators merely re-traced his drawings, which led to the crude appearance of the characters in the initial short episodes. Colorist Gyorgyi Peluce was the person who decided to make the characters yellow.|$|E

The feel of the show also changed and was also split into three sections.

5|$|Islam has {{a strong}} {{tradition}} of aniconism, and it is considered highly blasphemous in most Islamic traditions to visually depict Muhammad. This, compounded with a sense that <b>the</b> <b>cartoons</b> insulted Muhammad and Islam, offended many Muslims. Danish Muslim organisations that objected to the depictions responded by petitioning the embassies of Islamic countries and the Danish government to take action in response, and filed a judicial complaint against the newspaper, which was dismissed in January 2006. After the Danish government refused to meet with diplomatic representatives of the Muslim countries and would not intervene in the case, a number of Danish imams visited the Middle East in late 2005 {{to raise awareness of}} the issue. They presented a dossier containing the twelve cartoons from the Jyllands-Posten, and other information some of which was found to be falsified.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>cartoon</b> {{opens with}} Mickey and Clarabelle Cow in their {{dressing}} rooms applying blackface makeup for their roles. <b>The</b> <b>cartoon</b> {{is much more}} focused on the Disney characters' efforts {{to put on the}} play, than an animated version of Uncle Tom's Cabin. <b>The</b> <b>cartoon</b> contains many images of Mickey and the other characters using makeshift props as sight gags.|$|R

5|$|On 6 January 2006, the Regional Public Prosecutor in Viborg {{discontinued}} {{the investigation}} as {{he found no}} basis for concluding that <b>the</b> <b>cartoons</b> constituted a criminal offence because the publication concerned a subject of public interest and Danish case law extends editorial freedom to journalists regarding subjects of public interest. He stated that in assessing what constitutes an offence, the right to freedom of speech {{must be taken into}} consideration, and said that freedom of speech must be exercised with the necessary respect for other human rights, including the right to protection against discrimination, insult and degradation. In a new hearing resulting from a complaint about the original decision, the Director of Public Prosecutors in Denmark agreed with the previous ruling.|$|E
5|$|Peter Hervik {{said that}} the cartoon {{controversy}} must {{be seen in the}} context of an increasingly politicised media environment in Denmark since the 1990s, increasingly negative coverage of Islam and the Muslim minority in Denmark, anti-Muslim rhetoric from the governing political parties, and government policies such as restrictions on immigration and the abolishment of the Board for Ethnic Equality in 2002. Hervik said these themes are often ignored in international coverage of the issue and that they render conclusions that Jyllands-Posten and the Danish government were innocent victims in a dispute over freedom of speech inaccurate. Against this background, Danish Muslims were particularly offended by <b>the</b> <b>cartoons</b> because they reinforced the idea that Danes stigmatize all Muslims as terrorists and do not respect their religious beliefs.|$|E
5|$|Quimby {{accepted}} each Academy Award for Tom and Jerry's without inviting Hanna and Barbera onstage. <b>The</b> <b>cartoons</b> {{were also}} released with Quimby {{listed as the}} sole producer, following the same practice {{for which he had}} condemned Ising. When Quimby retired in late 1955, Hanna and Barbera were placed in charge of MGM's animation division. As the studio began to lose more revenue due to television, MGM soon realized that re-releasing old cartoons was far more profitable than producing new ones. In 1957, MGM ordered Hanna and Barbera's business manager to close the cartoon division and lay off everyone by a phone call. Hanna and Barbera found the no-notice closing puzzling because Tom and Jerry had been so successful.|$|E
