This research contributes to an improved understanding of the independent and interrelated effects of intrinsic and extrinsic motivations to use technological devices.

5|$|A {{preventative}} procedure (thoracotomy or thoracoscopy with pleurodesis) may be recommended {{after an}} episode of pneumothorax, with <b>the</b> <b>intention</b> <b>to</b> prevent recurrence. Evidence on the most effective treatment is still conflicting in some areas, and there is variation between treatments available in Europe and the US. Not all episodes of pneumothorax require such interventions; the decision depends largely on estimation {{of the risk of}} recurrence. These procedures are often recommended after the occurrence of a second pneumothorax. Surgery may need to be considered if someone has experienced pneumothorax on both sides ("bilateral"), sequential episodes that involve both sides, or if an episode was associated with pregnancy.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth and Mary {{were soon}} sent to Novigrad Castle, with John of Palisna as their new jailer. Margaret insisted that Elizabeth {{be put to}} death.

Sigismund marched into Slavonia in January 1387, with <b>the</b> <b>intention</b> <b>to</b> reach Novigrad and rescue the queens.

5000|$|The {{question}} is if <b>the</b> <b>intention</b> was <b>to</b> impose a punishment or [...] "civil proceedings". If <b>the</b> <b>intention</b> was <b>to</b> punish, that ends the inquiry. If <b>the</b> <b>intention</b> was <b>to</b> enact a regulatory scheme that is civil and nonpunitive, the Court must examine whether the scheme is so punitive as <b>to</b> negate <b>the</b> State's <b>intention</b> <b>to</b> deem it civil. Because the Court ordinarily defers to the legislature's stated intent, only the clearest proof will suffice to override that intent and transform {{what has been}} denominated a civil remedy into a criminal penalty.

Sam & Max Hit the Road is the ninth game to use the SCUMM adventure game engine, and also integrated the iMUSE audio system developed by Michael Land and Peter McConnell.

5|$|Meanwhile, in September 1952 another tank {{squadron}} was raised.

In 1954 the regiment received it first Ferret MK 1 Scout Car, enabling the raising of Reconnaissance Troop.

A quasi-experimental study with pre- and post-test measures in secondary education (n= 207) showed that parental involvement was beneficial <b>to</b> change <b>the</b> <b>intentions</b> <b>to</b> engage in certain unsafe behavior, and to reduce existing problematic behavior, particularly for boys.

The Buddha reluctantly replies that if he is killed in battle while his mind is seized with <b>the</b> <b>intention</b> <b>to</b> kill, he will undergo an unpleasant rebirth.

The Chinese government only allowed one child per Han family, with more children allowed to non-Han families. Since this planned birth policy was implemented based on local laws {{rather than on}} a national population law, the level of birth restriction differed in urban and rural areas.

40|$|Purpose – Based on {{organizational}} support theory, {{the aim of}} {{this paper}} is to examine the associations among perceived organizational support, successful aging in the workplace, job satisfaction, and <b>the</b> <b>intentions</b> <b>to</b> stay in organization among older workers. Design/methodology/approach – In total, 242 employees, aged over 45 years, were recruited to participate in a study from May to September 2009. Findings – Correlation showed that perceived organizational support and all five dimensions of successful aging in the workplace, (i. e. adaptability and health, positive relationship, occupational growth, personal security, and continued focus on goals), were significantly related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>intentions</b> <b>to</b> stay in <b>the</b> organization. Structural equation modeling showed that perceived organizational support was positively related to successful aging in the workplace, and the latter is related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>intentions</b> <b>to</b> stay, both directly and via the mediation of job satisfaction. Research limitations/implications – All data were self-reported and collected at one time point. Thus, common method variance may be an issue and causal inferences are not warranted. Practical implications – Successful aging in the workplace was significantly related to older workers 2 ̆ 7 <b>intentions</b> <b>to</b> stay. Managers may provide a wide range of organizational support and enhance successful aging in the workplace for older workers. Originality/value – This is the first study to empirically test the relations between successful aging in <b>the</b> workplace and <b>intentions</b> <b>to</b> stay among older workers.

In this innocuous town, a vicious two-day battle took place in which the Germans {{came face to face}} with the premier French tank, the Char B1-Bis, for the only time. One of these tanks, commanded by Pierre Billotte, proved invulnerable to German anti-tank fire and took 140 hits, and knocked out 13 German tanks (two PzKpfw IV and eleven PzKpfw III) and a number of anti-tank guns. It transpired that the French had concentrated their own armour there to mount another attack on the Sedan bridgeheads. The battle of Stonne took place between 15 and 17 May, and the town changed hands 17 times.
