50|$|In Central America, two noted {{events that}} feature <b>the</b> <b>carpets</b> is <b>the</b> {{community}} of Sutiaba in the municipality of León, Nicaragua and in Antigua Guatemala, {{both of which}} maintain the original purpose of use during Holy Week. Sutiaba is an indigenous community whose tradition dates {{back at least to}} 19th century according to written record. <b>The</b> <b>carpets</b> are made on what is called the Calle de Las Alfombras (Street of <b>the</b> <b>Carpets)</b> in <b>the</b> indigenous community of Sutiaba, meters from the San Juan de Dios de Sutiaba church. <b>The</b> <b>carpets</b> are created between Monday and Friday during Holy Week for the Good Friday procession. Each section takes about five to six hours with two to six people working on it depending on the complexity.

5|$|Like {{many films}} from the silent era, <b>The</b> <b>Carpet</b> from Bagdad was {{believed}} completely lost, but in 1982 an Oceaneering International diving expedition salvaged {{a number of}} artifacts from {{the wreck of the}} RMS Lusitania, including one reel of film. With the assistance of BBC technical advisor Laurie Ward, the BFI National Archive was able to recover images from several feet of the film, sufficient to identify the title, but not to restore any of the film to projectable condition. Although there was a theater on the Lusitania, this print of <b>The</b> <b>Carpet</b> from Bagdad was probably being taken to London as a film distributor's preview, as was the case for several other films known to have been on board.|$|E

He was asked by the CCRC to examine a red spot on <b>the</b> <b>carpet</b> visible in photographs underneath the scratches on the mantelpiece. He said the red spot matched a piece of nail varnish missing from one of Sheila's toes. He concluded that the scratch marks on the mantel had been created after the day of the murders.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Carpet</b> from Bagdad is a 1915 American silent {{adventure}} film {{directed by}} Colin Campbell {{and based on}} Harold MacGrath's 1911 eponymous novel.

5|$|Under his ownership, the Drawing Room was redecorated in a Renaissance Venetian style, In the process, Crace's {{stencilling}} {{was over}} painted and then covered by damasked silk, the Norton fireplace was removed, the furniture replaced with Edwardian pieces, and <b>the</b> <b>carpet</b> dyed by Sketchleys.

2500|$|The main {{borders of}} <b>the</b> <b>carpets</b> in <b>the</b> [...] "Paele" [...] and [...] "Lucca Madonna", {{as well as}} in [...] "Virgin with Child and Saints" [...] however, each show a non-Oriental undulating trefoil stem. Similar {{ornaments}} {{can be found in the}} borders of many carpets in Netherlandish paintings from the 15th to the beginning of the 16th century. The fringes of these carpets are often found at the sides of <b>the</b> painted <b>carpets,</b> not at <b>the</b> upper and lower ends. Either did <b>the</b> <b>carpets</b> have an uncommonly square shape, or maybe the artists have used some license and improvised with the authentic models. Alternatively, <b>the</b> <b>carpets</b> depicted by van Eyck and Petrus Christus could be of Western European manufacture.

2500|$|Oriental carpets {{were often}} {{depicted}} as a decorative element in religious scenes, and were a symbol of luxury, status and taste, although they were becoming more widely available throughout the period, which {{is reflected in the}} paintings.

5000|$|The largest event which {{features}} sawdust carpets in Mexico is in Huamantla, Tlaxcala. <b>The</b> <b>carpets</b> {{are part of}} the Feria de Huamantla which extend over the month of August.

Since 1941, Nuestra Señora de la Caridad leaves its sanctuary in a procession that wanders for eight km around the streets of the city.

50|$|Persian {{carpets and}} rugs of various types were woven in {{parallel}} by nomadic tribes, in village and town workshops, and by royal court manufactories alike. As such, they represent different, simultaneous lines of tradition, and reflect the history of Iran and its various peoples. <b>The</b> <b>carpets</b> woven in <b>the</b> Safavid court manufactories of Isfahan during the sixteenth century are famous for their elaborate colours and artistical design, and are treasured in museums and private collections {{all over the world}} today. Their patterns and designs have set an artistic tradition for court manufactories which was kept alive during the entire duration of the Persian Empire up to the last royal dynasty of Iran.

5|$|The {{epaulette}} shark was originally described as Squalus ocellatus by the French naturalist Pierre Joseph Bonnaterre in the 1788 Tableau encyclopédique et méthodique des trois règnes de la nature. The name was later changed to the currently valid Hemiscyllium ocellatum. The type specimen was a 35cm (14in) long immature male caught near Cooktown, Queensland, Australia. Other common names for this species are the itar shark and the blind shark (also used for Brachaelurus waddi). Goto's 2002 morphological analysis of <b>the</b> <b>carpet</b> sharks showed the genus Hemiscyllium as a polytomy, {{meaning that the}} phylogenetic relationships between the {{epaulette shark}} and its sister species could not be resolved.|$|E
