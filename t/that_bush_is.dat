On March 31, 2006, Dean testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee during hearings on censuring the president over the issue. Senator Russell Feingold (D-Wis.), who sponsored the censure resolution, introduced Dean as a [...] "patriot" [...] who put [...] "rule of law above {{the interests of the}} president." [...] In his testimony, Dean asserted that Richard Nixon covered up Watergate because he believed it was in the interest of national security. This sparked a sharp debate with Republican South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham, who repeatedly asserted that Nixon authorized the break-in at Democratic headquarters.

50|$|As the Hornblower novels progress, Bush often {{worries that}} Hornblower is depriving himself {{not only of}} food and rest, but also of human contact. Although Bush is an {{excellent}} judge of character, {{he is not a}} diplomat, and he must often keep his concern for his sensitive friend to himself as Hornblower is inclined to snap when Bush expresses it. Their friendship survives because of Bush's perseverance. In Hotspur, Hornblower decides <b>that</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>is</b> as resigned to the vagaries of Hornblower's mood as he is to the vagaries of wind and weather.|$|E
5000|$|Despite lampooning him on stage, Bush {{described}} Tony Blair as [...] "a {{decent man}} who made some bad decisions", and stated that she had [...] "come to ridicule beautiful Blair not vilify him".

5000|$|Linguist Mark Liberman of Language Log has {{suggested}} <b>that</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>is</b> not unusually error-prone in his speech, saying: [...] "You can make any public figure {{sound like a}} boob, if you record everything he says and set hundreds of hostile observers to combing the transcripts for disfluencies, malapropisms, word formation errors and examples of non-standard pronunciation or usage... Which of us could stand up to a similar level of linguistic scrutiny?" [...] Nearly a decade after George W.

5000|$|Bush {{has been}} parodied by the media, comedians, and other politicians.

5000|$|It {{is clear}} <b>that</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>is</b> {{grateful}} for your Blair's support and has registered {{that you are}} getting flak. I said {{that you would not}} budge in your support for regime change but you had to manage a press, a Parliament and a public opinion that was very different from anything in the States. And you would not budge either in your insistence that, if we pursued regime change, it must be very carefully done and produce the right result. Failure was not an option.I told Condi that we realized that the Bush administration could go it alone ... But if it wanted company, it would have to take account of its potential coalition partners. In particular:The UN dimension. The issue of the weapons inspectors must be handled {{in a way that would}} persuade European and wider opinion that the U.S. was conscious of the international framework, and the insistence of many countries on the need for a legal base. Renewed refusal by Saddam to accept unfettered inspections would be a powerful argument.|$|E

5000|$|In the USA {{reaction}} to the record was mixed. Awarding the record the title of [...] "platter du jour" [...] (i.e. album of the month), Spin observed that [...] "with traces of classical, operatic, tribal and twisted pop styles, Kate creates music that observes no boundaries of musical structure or inner expression". The review noted [...] "while her eclecticism is welcomed and rewarded in her homeland her genius is still ignored here - {{a situation that is}} truly a shame for an artist so adventurous and naturally theatrical", and hoped that [...] "this album might gain her some well-deserved recognition from the American mainstream". However, Rolling Stone, in their first ever review of a Kate Bush record, was unimpressed: [...] "The Mistress of Mysticism has woven another album that both dazzles and bores. Like the Beatles on their later albums, Bush is not concerned about having to perform the music live, and her orchestrations swell to the limits of technology. But unlike the Beatles, Bush often overdecorates her songs with exotica ... There's no arguing <b>that</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>is</b> extraordinarily talented, but as with Jonathan Richman, rock's other eternal kid, her vision will seem silly to those who believe children should be seen and not heard." [...] The New York Times characterized the album's music as [...] "slightly precious, calculated female art rock" [...] and called Bush [...] "a real master of instrumental textures," [...] while The Independent called Hounds [...] "a prog-pop masque of an album." [...] Pitchfork Media gave the album a score of 10/10. Spin called it an [...] "art-pop classic." ...|$|E
5000|$|In August 2015, Bush {{said that}} {{additional}} U.S. ground troops {{may be needed}} in Iraq (beyond the estimated 3,500 U.S. military trainers and advisers there now) to fight the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS or ISIL), but did not call for a major deployment of forces. Bush said that he favored building a new U.S. base in Iraq's al-Anbar province, [...] and embedding some U.S. troops with Iraqi armed forces to help train them and identify targets as joint terminal attack controllers (JTACs). Daniel W. Drezner, a professor of international politics at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, wrote in the Washington Post in August 2015 that: [...] "If you look at Bush's actual specifics on Iraq, {{most of the things}} he suggests — 'support the Iraqi forces,' 'more support to the Kurds,' 'restart the serious diplomatic efforts' — aren't all that different from the current administration's policies. Bush might propose more forward deployment of U.S. forces, but otherwise his Iraq policy boils down to 'I'll try harder.'" [...] Tim Mak of the Daily Beast, writing in August 2015, similarly noted <b>that</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>is</b> not pressing for [...] "an aggressive policy shift" [...] and that [...] "many of the things Bush is advocating for are being pursued by Obama and his administration," [...] including U.S. support for the Iraqi forces, provision of U.S. aid to Kurdish fighters, U.S. engagement with Sunni tribes, and U.S.-led airstrikes against ISIS. Mak noted that [...] "on the issue of arming the Kurds directly instead of the current policy, sending aid through the central Iraqi government, an issue his fellow Republicans have raised, Bush is silent." ...|$|E
