It was the experimental study using completely random design (CRD). The provided treatments were exchanging commercial ration proportion with fermented <b>tofu</b> waste <b>and</b> bran, R 0 = 100 % commercial diet, R 1 = 90 % commercial diet + 10 % <b>tofu</b> waste <b>and</b> bran fermentation, R 2 = 80 % commercial diet + 20 % <b>tofu</b> waste <b>and</b> bran fermentation, R 3 = 70 % commercial diet + 30 % <b>tofu</b> waste <b>and</b> bran fermentation, R 3 = 60 % commercial diet + 40 % <b>tofu</b> waste <b>and</b> bran fermentation. Based on variance analysis, it could probably be reached that treatment effects showed insignificant differences (P> 0. 05) to live weight, persentage of carcass, the intestines and fat abdomen broiler. Conclusion in this research is getting high level of the addition of <b>tofu</b> waste <b>and</b> bran fermented by using effective microorganism- 4 in rations relatively similar to yield commercial ration live weight, the persentage of carcas, the intestines and the abdominal fat broiler...|$|R

25|$|The Japanese brought bento and sashimi, and, {{although}} many of their vegetable seeds would not grow in the climate of the islands, they succeeded in making <b>tofu</b> <b>and</b> soy sauce. The homes of Japanese immigrants lacked ovens, so their cooking relied on frying, steaming, broiling, and simmering, leading to the popularization of tempura and noodle soups in Hawaii. By the early 20th century, the Japanese were the largest ethnic group and rice became the third largest crop in the islands.|$|E
25|$|Fat-free (defatted) {{soybean meal}} is a {{significant}} and cheap source of protein for animal feeds and many packaged meals. For example, soybean products, such as textured vegetable protein (TVP), are ingredients in many meat and dairy substitutes. The beans contain significant amounts of phytic acid, dietary minerals and B vitamins. Soy vegetable oil, used in food and industrial applications, is another product of processing the soybean crop. Traditional non-fermented food uses of soybeans include soy milk from which <b>tofu</b> <b>and</b> tofu skin are made. Fermented soy foods include soy sauce, fermented bean paste, natto and tempeh.|$|E

25|$|Commercial egg substitutes, such as Bob's Red Mill egg {{replacer}} and Ener-G egg replacer, {{are available}} for cooking and baking. The protein in eggs thickens when heated and binds other ingredients together. Flaxseeds will do the same: replace each egg with one tablespoon of flaxseed meal mixed with three tablespoons of water. For pancakes a tablespoon of baking powder can be used instead of eggs. Other ingredients include (to replace one egg): one tablespoon of soy flour and one tablespoon of water; a quarter cup of mashed bananas, mashed prunes or apple sauce; or in batter two tablespoons of white flour, half a tablespoon of vegetable oil, two tablespoons of water, and half a tablespoon of baking powder. Silken (soft) <b>tofu</b> <b>and</b> mashed potato can also be used. Recently, aquafaba has come into use as a popular egg replacement, it can even be whipped up like egg whites.|$|E

Japanese cuisine offers a vast array of regional specialties that use traditional recipes and local ingredients. The phrase [...] refers to the makeup of a typical meal served, but has roots in classic kaiseki, honzen, and yūsoku cuisine.

Tofu was widely consumed during the Tang dynasty (618–907), and likely spread to Japan during the later Tang or early Song dynasty.

The vegetarian dietary laws of Buddhism led to development of meat analogues as a replacement for the meat-based dishes that the Chinese were no longer able to consume as Buddhists.

40|$|Soybean is {{considered}} {{an important source of}} human food and animal feed. Okara <b>and</b> <b>tofu</b> whey are the main by-products of soymilk <b>and</b> <b>tofu</b> production. The distribution of enzymes β-amylase and lipoxygenase (Lox) from six soybean genotypes in protein extracts of okara <b>and</b> <b>tofu</b> as well as in soymilk <b>and</b> <b>tofu</b> whey was assessed. SDS-electrophoretic results showed that production process significantly affected high molecular mass protein fractions of soybean by-products. Low amounts of Lox in soymilk were registered, while in okara protein extracts <b>and</b> <b>tofu</b> whey this enzyme was present in trace. In tofu protein extracts, Lox was registered in higher quantity that might be the result of the aggregation process during formation of the tofu gel. Content of β-amylase in all soy protein products was high and similar to the content in soybean genotype. Content of β-amylase in okara depended on respective soybean genotype.
