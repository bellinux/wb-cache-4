EPLO facilitates this growing legislative exchange. Today, the TLD comprises bi-annual meetings (alternating between the US and EU capitals) on a number of topics of common interests (e.g., job creation and competitiveness, trade, cybersecurity, energy, foreign policy).

[...] The NTA was further extended to cover bilateral and multilateral trade in 1998, through the Transatlantic Economic Partnership (TEP). The Lisbon Treaty, ratified in 2009, established the European External Action Service as the EU's foreign policy institution. Since 2013, the US and EU have been engaged in discussions to create a free trade agreement, known as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership.|$|E

40|$|The US and EU have {{developed}} quite different frameworks for regulating agbiotech, {{but these were}} potentially compatible with transatlantic trade in GM products. How, then, did a trade conflict arise? This chapter challenges explanations centring on transatlantic regulatory divergence. Rather, the US-EU agbiotech conflict arose from contending <b>transatlantic</b> <b>agendas,</b> which have operated within and across the two jurisdictions. The analysis here extends insights from other academic accounts (Bernauer, 2003; Jasanoff, 2005; Toke, 2004; Isaac, 2002), while also disagreeing with some accounts. A <b>transatlantic</b> trade-liberalisation <b>agenda</b> set {{the context in which}} European protest could frame agbiotech as a dual threat of 'globalisation' and unknown risks. Greater controversy led to regulatory blockages and a trade conflict, which policy actors diagnosed in ways convenient for their own agendas. Promoting agbiotech, some politicians warned that EU regulatory delays or more stringent rules would be found illegal at the WTO. But this strategy backfired; instead it provided a vulnerable target for attack by 'anti-globalisation' activists. Citing US threats of a WTO case, opponents sought to delegitimise pro-agbiotech policies as a surrender to political and commercial pressures. From the late 1990 s onwards, some European policymakers articulated a new problem ? how 'to restore public and market confidence' ? as an imperative for institutional reform. This problem-diagnosis helped to bypass earlier disagreements about the 'scientific' basis of regulatory criteria, thus facilitating more precautionary approaches to risk assessment and GM labelling. These changes accommodated key aspects of the 'consumer rights' agenda, thus potentially establishing a stronger basis to legitimise EU decisions...|$|R

40|$|This book {{analyses}} {{the cooperation}} between the European Union and the United States on internal security and counter-terrorism since the 9 / 11 terrorist attacks. In particular, four areas of cooperation are examined: customs and supply chain security; judicial cooperation (the mutual legal assistance and extradition agreements); law enforcement cooperation (the Europol-US agreements); and the EU-US agreements for the sharing of air passengers’ data (PNR agreements). These cases are analysed through a conceptual framework based on the theories of international regimes, with the data being drawn from an extensive documentary analysis of media sources collected through the 'Nexis' database, official documents, and from 13 semi-structured elite interviews with US and EU officials. The book argues that the EU and the US have established a transatlantic internal security regime based on shared principles, norms, rules, and interests. While {{at the beginning of}} this process the EU had a more reactive and passive stance at the later stages both the EU and the US were active in shaping the <b>transatlantic</b> political <b>agenda</b> and negotiations.

Contrary to many conceptualizations, the eventual “excess” of data protection operates less against internal security than against the protection of privacy.

40|$|The {{last decade}} {{has seen the}} {{emergence}} of a set of ideas under the broad banner of neo-liberalism that connect international law and international relations. One of the key concepts in this burgeoning intellectual movement, revived from the 1970 s, is the idea of transnational governance, which posits that modern liberal states collectively organize their political life in ways that go beyond simple hierarchical relations between solitary sovereigns and individuals and instead rely on complex international networks linking various branches of government and key non-state actors. Transatlantic Governance in the Global Economy, edited by Mark Pollack and Gregory Shaffer, is an attempt to add empirical weight to this liberal theory.

40|$|This thesis {{represents}} {{an attempt to}} make an original contribution to knowledge about transatlantic institutions and transatlantic governance. It investigates attempts in the 1990 s to foster a 'new transatlantic dialogue' between the EU and the US, through three bilateral agreements: the Transatlantic Declaration (1990), the New <b>Transatlantic</b> <b>Agenda</b> (1995) and the Transatlantic Economic Partnership (1998). The thesis questions whether and to what extent the relationship has been institutionalised into a structure for transatlantic governance, and how the composition of transatlantic institutions impacts the way the transatlantic actors govern. Consideration is given to both 'who' governs in transatlantic relations and 'how', as evidence is sought to prove or disprove the claim that a decentralisation of decision-making powers has resulted in 'policy setting' and 'policy shaping' by lower level civil servants and non-state actors participating in transgovernmental and transnational institutions.

Much of the government-to-government interaction has been dominated by the need to produce "deliverables" on a laundry list of issues. Perhaps most frustrating, the NTA process, even when running relatively smoothly, has clearly not reduced the overall level of transatlantic tension, as is made evident by the current bout of the US. -European discord-one of the worst in years...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{represents an}} attempt {{to find out whether}} and to what extent transatlantic economic cooperation has been institutionalized in the last decade. More broadly, it is also a review of trade relations between the European Union and the United States in the past twenty years. Firstly, my claim is that the institutionalization of practices like trade dialogues and/or fora after the New <b>Transatlantic</b> <b>Agenda</b> had a weak impact on how transatlantic actors govern their respective economic ties. Consideration is given to both 'who' governs in transatlantic relations (either state and non-state actors) and 'how', as evidence is sought either in official documents and case-studies to prove or disprove the claim that a “re-centralisation” of decision-making powers has resulted in less 'policy setting' and 'policy shaping' by lower level civil servants and non-state actors. Moreover, another key issue is what drove the overall design and strategy of trade and economic relations forward, {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic. Extensive use of case studies, process-tracing, and interviews is applied to a wide range of topics, covering the period from the establishment of the New <b>Transatlantic</b> <b>Agenda</b> until the re-launch of the partnership with the Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC) in 2007. A particular attention is devoted to public opinion as an explanatory variable. Trade undisputedly reflects better than any other topic the determinants and features of decision-making, and shows how strongly they are shaped by a variety of factors. Non-tariff barriers to trade are one of the most important limits to transatlantic dialogue, especially in sectors such as food products, health, chemicals or data privacy. The role of private actors in (re) shaping regulatory standards is increased for example during current negotiations in Brussels and in Washington for the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. Finally, policy-making in the transatlantic sphere is adjusted to the needs and exigencies of the different relevant actors. Therefore, the peculiarity of the topic I am going to present can not be treated as if it was simply a matter of institutions, rational choices and bargaining. Policies are a result of a complex web of interactions, which can be framed by theories and are shaped by ideas and norms, as it will be shown in the theoretical part. I assume that political decisions can be explained by looking both at the different levels to which they are agreed upon and at the different factors they may be influenced by...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Hailed by President Clinton as the "roadmap for the 21 st century", the New <b>Transatlantic</b> <b>Agenda</b> (NTA) and the Joint Action Plan (JAP) were {{designed}} to be a watershed in US-EU relations. Rooted in the revolutionary changes of the late 1980 s/early 1990 s, the US and the EU realized that they were entering the uncertainty of a new and unprecedented political era - the post-Cold War world - which called for a fundamental overhaul of transatlantic relations. It quickly became obvious that the political dialogue between the two needed to be reinvigorated and incorporate a wider area of policy objectives. Ergo, it was necessary {{to move away from the}} ad hoc consultations common during the Cold War, and cope with issues which were formerly for the most part unilaterally dealt with by the United States. Only a few years after the first attempt of strengthening transatlantic ties culminated in the Transatlantic Declaration of 1990, policy makers on both sides of the Atlantic realized that further cooperation was called for. At the US-EU summit in Madrid on 3 December 1995, President Bill Clinton, Spanish Prime Minister and President of the EU Council Felipe Gonzalez, and European Commission President Jacques Santer announced a New <b>Transatlantic</b> <b>Agenda</b> (NTA) and a Joint Action Plan (JAP) to forge even closer ties between the United States and the European Union by implementing coordinated policies on a range of the most pressing economic, political, security, humanitarian, environmental and cultural issues. The initiative was a concise plan laying out concrete action plans to cope with today's interdependent world in which challenges facing the United States and the European Union could no longer be dealt with satisfactorily by either party acting alone. Transnational in nature, these challenges, such as international crime, drug trafficking, terrorism, environmental degradation and the spread of communicable diseases, required resources which exceeded those at the disposal of either the US or the EU acting alone. In particular, the two sides promised joined actions to work towards the following four goals: (I) promoting peace and stability and fostering democracy and development around the world (II) responding to new global challenges (III) contributing to the expansion of world trade and closer economic relations (IV) building social and cultural bridges across the Atlantic. Based on the Agenda, the Joint Action Plan is a more comprehensive document which contains 150 longer-term specific objectives from which a number are selected for regular updating of the Agenda between subsequent US-EU summit meetings. The following assessment explores the origins of the Agenda in general and the overall state of transatlantic relations during the 1990 's in particular. Furthermore, each policy area is discussed and evaluated from an American and European point of view. Lastly, potential points of friction are examined and a prospect for bringing the Agenda to fruition will be undertaken...|$|E
40|$|In this chapter, {{we attempt}} to provide some answers, {{on the basis of}} the {{empirical}} evidence presented in the preceding chapters, to the two sets of questions posed in the introduction to this volume. In the first section of this chapter, {{we attempt to}} explain the rise of new forms of transatlantic governance during the 1990 s, addressing three core questions: What's new about these transatlantic governance mechanisms? Why are they developing now? And why have the various actors in the new governance networks chosen to organize at the transatlantic level, rather than in some other international forums? In the second section, we examine the evidence of transatlantic governance across a wide range of issue areas, ranging from trade and standard setting to food safety, consumer protection, labor, and the environment, and we assess the relative explanatory power of the intergovernmental, transgovernmental, and transnational models of governance laid out in the introduction. In the third section, we conclude that transatlantic governance is increasingly governance by mixed networks of all three types of actors, albeit with a leading role for the Clinton administration and the European commission, which emerge as the primary architects of the New <b>Transatlantic</b> <b>Agenda.</b> Finally, returning to Rhodes's model of governance by mixed networks of public and private actors brought together by resource interdependencies, we examine the relative power of various actors within these transatlantic networks as a function of their respective resource endowments, and we speculate about the development of those networks in the coming years...|$|E
40|$|From the 1990 Transatlantic Declaration (TAD) to the 1995 New <b>Transatlantic</b> <b>Agenda</b> and Joint Action Plan (NTA/JAP), {{this paper}} argues that {{nothing short of}} a {{revolution}} occurred {{in the nature of the}} dialogue between the United States and the European Community. The change was from a high-ideological political manifesto to a common program for practical action, embodied in the JAP's 150 action items [...] from a summons to transatlantic solidarity in the aftermath of the Cold War to what former U. S. Secretary of State James A. Baker has described, with mixed admiration and disapproval, as a "laundry list. " Three main explanations for this major transformation of the Atlantic dialogue are offered. The first is "the failure of grand designs" [...] the inability of American and European statesmen to find a replacement project for the formerly supreme task of winning the Cold War. The second is the increased prominence of the business community, notably the members of the new Transatlantic Business Dialogue, in determining even U. S. and European officials' work agenda. The third is the rapid, vast spread of information technology, notably use of the Internet, which has so broadened the transatlantic dialogue today as to risk taking it largely out of the hands of diplomats. The NTA/JAP, in short, is a powerful engine of diplomatic change. In promoting it, U. S. and European Union government officials may have helped to promote themselves out of a job. The NTA/JAP can now grow almost organically, from the bottom up. If it does continue to proliferate and flourish, the political leaders of the Atlantic world may find that they have expressed themselves in a way that defines the limits of their own leadership, and opens space for a new idea of Atlantic citizenship...|$|E
40|$|The {{idea of a}} {{necessary}} fiction is explored below {{in a number of}} interrelated segments. The first section considers the nature of America's self-appointed 'global leadership' role in the post-cold war system, concentrating on the declinist versus global dominance arguments. The second section attempts to consider the Euro-defense debate in the context of overall transatlantic relations. The third section considers {{the question of whether the}} U. S. is reorienting its interests away from Europe towards the Pacific Rim. This section concludes by arguing that although Asia presents attractive markets for the U. S., strong economic and cultural links to Europe remain that on balance ensure a central position for Europe and U. S. foreign affairs. The next section considers the issue of whether fractious trade relations between the U. S. and the EU pose a challenge to the formation or enhancement of security ties between the two. It is suggested that the New <b>Transatlantic</b> <b>Agenda</b> may provide a useful vehicle for adjunct to the security dialogue by addressing trade and non-security related concerns. The fifth section examines the background and content of the two grand compromises (NATO's 1990 London Declaration and the January 1994 Brussels summit) that have shaped post-cold war European security. The most significant practical outcome of these compromises is the CJTF concept which, it is argued, has effectively consolidated U. S. leadership in both the NATO context but also, in a de facto manner in the exercise of 'Euro' options. As an interesting, but illustrative aside, the supply and dissemination of intelligence is considered as a significant example of this consolidation. The conclusion argues that the necessary fiction has established a workable modus vivendi where the main interests of the main actors are served and which may also constitute a stable platform for the development of other aspects of transatlantic relations...|$|E
40|$|This chapter aims {{to analyse}} the {{external}} dimension of EU criminal law through {{a discussion of}} the external profile of the AFSJ, the domicile of the EU’s acquis in the field of criminal law. It is argued that in view of growing security challenges from outside the EU borders, the external dimension of the AFSJ is not only crucial to EU internal but also, and perhaps most importantly, global stability and security. To this end, the preservation of the AFSJ necessitates inter alia EU international cooperation with non-Member States in criminal matters. Beyond the EU classic range of instruments, such as bilateral agreements with third countries on extradition or priorities set in the context of Association Agreements, EU international cooperation in criminal law also includes less known individual mechanisms. In the AFSJ context such mechanisms include, inter alia, a strategic partnership with Russia outside the context of the European Neighbourhood Policy, individual arrangements with the US covered by the New <b>Transatlantic</b> <b>Agenda,</b> as well as external aid programmes and institution building contributing to good governance {{and the rule of law}} in the Western Balkans. This chapter will commence with an analysis of EU criminal justice as an external policy. It will identify its restrictions based on the lack of criminal law competence in the foreign policy realm. In lieu of the lack of such competence, the chapter will then discuss the advancement of indirect EU international cooperation in criminal matters by identifying briefly the instruments available and their legal basis. It will then turn into some case studies, starting with a consideration of the EU’s strategic partnership with Russia and the potential of a new EU-Russia legally binding agreement with criminal law implications and the issues of legislative competence surrounding it. The chapter will move on to consider EU policy on capabilities enhancement in the Western Balkans as part of the development of regional cooperation with a view to EU accession. Once legal competence is established in this context, the purpose there is to evaluate the political competency of the EU to influence public policy in the field of criminal justice. We will also attempt to identify actual and potential stumbling blocks in the transfusion of EU rules and norms to neighbouring states. The time is ripe since the first forms of EU criminal law post-Lisbon have been enacted and a new constitutional dimension has attached to this field an external dimension which is worth observing...|$|E
