40|$|We {{describe}} a system which, building on previous <b>team</b> <b>action</b> recognition systems, performs a more in-depth analysis {{of an ongoing}} <b>team</b> <b>action</b> executed {{by a group of}} embodied agents. The system relies on <b>team</b> <b>action</b> states with human understandable semantics, estimates the current state and is able to make predictions or identify fringe cases such as incomplete or incorrectly executed <b>team</b> <b>actions.</b> The representation of the <b>team</b> <b>action</b> relies on a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN). We perform reasoning over the DBN using a samplingimportance-resampling particle filter. As a methodological illustration, we describe the process of model building for the bounding overwatch <b>team</b> <b>action.</b> We experimentally test our approach using data acquired from video recordings, and measure the system’s ability to recognize a <b>team</b> <b>action</b> and to estimate the current state. ...|$|R
40|$|Recognizing <b>team</b> <b>actions</b> in the {{behavior}} of embodied agents has many practical applications and had seen significant progress in recent years. One approach with proven results is based on HMMbased recognition of spatio-temporal patterns in {{the behavior}} of the agents. While it had been shown to work on real-world datasets, this approach was found to be brittle. In this paper we present two contributions which together can significantly increase the robustness of teamwork activity recognition. First we introduce a technique to reduce high dimensional continuous input data to a set of discrete features, which capture the essential components of the <b>team</b> <b>actions.</b> Second, we prefix the actual <b>team</b> <b>action</b> recognition with a role recognition module, which allows us to present the recognizer with arbitrarily shuffled input, and still obtain high recognition rates. We validate the improved accuracy and robustness of the <b>team</b> <b>action</b> recognizer on datasets derived from captured real world data. 1...|$|R

40|$|While <b>team</b> <b>action</b> {{recognition}} has {{a relatively}} extended literature, less {{attention has been}} given to the detailed realtime analysis of the internal structure of the <b>team</b> <b>actions.</b> This includes recognizing {{the current state of the}} action, predicting the next state, recognizing deviations from the standard action model, and handling ambiguous cases. The underlying probabilistic reasoning model has a major impact on the type of data it can extract, its accuracy, and the computational cost of the reasoning process. In this paper we are using Cascading Hidden Markov Models (CHMM) to analyze Bounding Overwatch, an important <b>team</b> <b>action</b> in military tactics. The <b>team</b> <b>action</b> is represented in the CHMM as a plan tree. Starting from real-world recorded data, we identify the subteams through clustering and extract team oriented discrete features. In an experimental study, we investigate whether the better scalability and the more structured information provided by the CHMM comes with an unacceptable cost in accuracy. We find that a properly parametrized CHMM estimating the current goal chain of the Bounding Overwatch plan tree comes very close to a flat HMM estimating only the overall Bounding Overwatch state (a subset of the goal chain) at a respective overall state accuracy of 95 % vs 98 %, making the CHMM a good candidate for deployed systems...|$|R

40|$|Recognizing and annotating the {{occurrence}} of <b>team</b> <b>actions</b> in observations of embodied agents has applications in surveillance and in training of military or sport teams. We describe the <b>team</b> <b>actions</b> through a spatio-temporal correlated pattern of movement, which can be modeled by a Hidden Markov Model. The hand-crafting of these models is a difficult task of knowledge engineering, even in application domains where explicit, natural language descriptions of the <b>team</b> <b>actions</b> are available. The main contribution {{of this paper is}} an approach through which the library of HMM representations can be acquired from a small number of hand annotated, representative samples of the specific movement patterns. A series of experiments, performed on a dataset describing a real-world terrestrial warfare exercise validates our method and shows good recognition accuracy even in the presence of noisy data. The speed of the recognition engine is sufficiently fast to allow real time annotation of incoming observations...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} {{we aim to}} {{describe}} dynamic aspects of social and collective attitudes in teams of agents involved in Cooperative Problem Solving (CPS). Particular attention {{is given to the}} strongest motivational attitude, collective commitment, and its evolution during <b>team</b> <b>action.</b> First, building on our previous work, a logical framework is sketched in which a number of relevant social and collective attitudes is formalized, leading to the plan-based definition of collective commitments. Moreover, a dynamic logic component is added to this framework in order to capture the effects of the complex actions that are involved in the consecutive stages of CPS, namely potential recognition, team formation, plan formation and <b>team</b> <b>action.</b> During <b>team</b> <b>action,</b> the collective commitment leads to the execution of agent-specific actions. A dynamic and unpredictable environment may, however, cause the failure of some of these actions, or present the agents with new opportunities. The abstract reconfiguration algorithm, presented in a previous paper, is designed to handle the re-planning needed in such situations in an efficient way. In this paper, the dynamic logic component of the logical framework addresses issues pertaining to adjustments in collective commitment during the reconfiguration process...|$|R
