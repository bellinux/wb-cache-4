40|$|ABSTRACT: Saprophytic and facultative {{parasitic}} fungi {{present in}} the coastal waters and adjacent pelagic areas of the Hawaiian Islands, and in coastal sands of the H awaiian, Line, and Phoenix islands, were isolated by plating methods. Isolates from all areas sampled indicate that abundant and varied fungus popu-lations do exist in these environments. The number of fungi obtained from the inshore neri <b>tic</b> <b>zone</b> was seven times that obtained from the oceanic zone. The fungus Anreobasidium pltllttla 11 S (De Bary) Arnaud was isolated repeatedly from oceanic waters. A comparison is made between the genera and {{the average number of}} isolates per liter of water known from the Atlantic Ocean with those found in this study of the Pacific Ocean. The number of fungi isolated from sand samples of the different islands ranged from 2 to 1, 600 per gram. Species diversity was evident throughout the samples. The leeward Hawaiian islands had a higher aver-age number of isolates per gram than any other island group. In conclusion the pr oblems of defining a marine fungus are discussed. OCEANIC AREAS {{in different parts of the}} world have been shown to be habitats for marine fungi (Johnson and Sparrow, 1961). Investi-gators, however, have usually concentrated on particular groups of fungi by use of selective isolation methods (Barghoorn and Linder, 1944; Moore and Meyers, 1959; Jones, 1962). Only one extensive analysis of marine waters for a general fungus population is known, and it was made in the northwestern subtropical Atlantic Ocean (Roth et al., 1964). References to the occurrence of fungi in the Pacific Ocean are found (1) as incidental to studies of bac-teria in marine water (ZoBell, 1946); (2) in studies of specialized fungi such as lignicolou...|$|E

The transfer efficiency o f the biological pump (1) depends upon how much sinking particulate organic carbon (POC) is remineralized and consum ed by resident biota within the ocean’s twilight zone. This downward POC flux in tile ocean comprises a complex mix ture o f living and dead cells, excretory products, detrital matter, and amorphous aggregates (2). Remineralization o f POC and associated bio elements sets tile concentration o f deep ocean nutrients and via subsequent upwelling is a feed back on tile strength o f primary productivity. Since the 1980 s there have been various at tempts to parameterize this flux attenuation (3), the m ost com m on being F = F 10 o(-/ 100) b, where z is the trap depth, F 10 o is the POC flux at 100 m, and b is a unitless parameter determinin...|$|E
40|$|Reconnaissance soil {{sampling}} within the catchment of streams containing anomalous levels of copper in drainage samples {{led to the}} discovery of disseminated copper mineralisation in the Black Stockarton Moor area of Galloway, Scotland. Analysis of aeromagnetic data and of a gravity survey of the area, previously mapped as an irregular complex of dykes, suggested that the region was underlain by laminar bodies of granodiorite. Geological mapping r evealed the presence of a major Caledonian multiphase subvolcanic complex intruding LOvler Palaeozoic turbidi tes, {{to the west of the}} Criffe! granodioritic plutonic complex. An induced polarisation survey delineated an arcuate anomaly about 6 km long and the resul t s of a simultaneous geochemical soil survey showed a zone with anomalous levels of copper (> 140 ppm to 5500 ppm) in the southern part of the area to be essentially paralle l to the IP anomaly but partially displaced to the east. A series of three deep angled drill holes and nine shallow holes sited on geochemical and geophysical anomalies confirmed the widespread presence of both veinlet and disseminated pyrite and copper mineralisation of the porphyry type. The Black Stockarton Moor subvolcanic complex is a composite of minor intrusive rocks, the ear l iest phase of which, comprising porphyri te dyke swarms, granodiorite sheet intrusions, small granodiori te stocks, breccia pipes, vent agglomerates with plugs of basic rock and a few basic dykes, predates the adjacent multiphase Crlffel plutonic complex. The second phase of subvo lcanic activity postdates the plutonic rocks and comprises intense en-echelon s igmoidal swarms of porphyrite dykes sharply discordant to the earliest phase rocks. A minor third phase consists of linear porphyrite dykes closely associated with fault - ing. Chemical analysis and mineralogical examination of the borehole material indicates that regular zonation can be observed in the style and intensity of both mineralisation and hydrothermal alteration. This zonation is regular fr om west to east across the IP and soil anomalies. A propylitic alteration zone with the development of chlorite. epidote and minor sericite in igneous rocks and of calcite, quartz, jasperoid, chlorite, amphibole, epidote and albite in sedimentary rocks occurs to the wes t. Within this zone hematite gradually gives way to increasing amounts of pyrite from west t o east. The propylitic zone passes into a sericitic alteration zone where sedimentary rocks are frequently bleached and igneous rocks pink or orange-coloured containing secondary quartz, chlorite and muscovite. Pyrite is most conspicuous within rocks of the outer sericite zone, the outcrop of which coincides roughly with the axis of the IP anomaly. Further east pyrite decreases but chalcopyrite and bornite with some chalcocite become relatively conspicuous and copper levels are the highest attained (in the 400 ppm to 1100 ppm range). save for isolated highly br·ecciated sections. Chemical zonation shows relative enrichment in Mn, Zn, As and Pb in the outer propyli <b>tic</b> <b>zone,</b> Ba in the serid tic 1 zone and Cu in the inner sericitic zone while As, Sb and Au are markedly concentrated with Cu and Mo in isolated brecciated section...|$|E
