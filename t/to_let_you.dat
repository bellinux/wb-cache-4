500|$|Higginbotham entered Purdue as a {{freshman}} in 1944. At the time, the student body was composed of approximately 6,000 white students, and 12 black students. Although eligible for admission, black students were not permitted {{to live in the}} dormitories. Higginbotham and the other 11 black students were placed in a building called International House, which was the only building that blacks could live in West Lafayette. The students slept in the attic, which was unheated. Higginbotham sought a meeting with the University President, Edward C.

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by {{executive}} producer Frank Spotnitz, and marked his directorial debut. Because of his position as both the writer of the episode and the director, Spotnitz later noted {{that it was hard}} to achieve perfection when filming the episode. However, he did note that, as both the writer and director, he had more creative control than usual. Originally Spotnitz did not have plans to direct the episode but was encouraged to do so by David Duchovny; Duchovny reminded Spotnitz that it would be the last Monster-of-the-Week (stand alone) episode to feature his character, Fox Mulder. After production and shooting was finalized, the rough cut of [...] "Alone" [...] was nine minutes over time and in order to compensate for the time, various sections were cut during final editing. Robert Patrick was very pleased with Spotnitz's work, stating, [...] "You're talking about some incredibly intelligent individuals, and they were very willing <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>you,</b> as an artist, discover what they were trying to do with the role. That's a wonderful environment to work in." ...|$|E

500|$|Morrowind, {{following}} the tradition established by its predecessors in The Elder Scrolls series, is a free-form world, with few constricting boundaries on the player's actions. From {{the beginning of}} the game, players are put in a world where they are left to roam, steal, quest and explore, without necessarily {{following the}} main quest. Lead designer Ken Rolston, asked prior to Morrowinds release what he thought were the [...] "core, untouchable design elements" [...] of the Elder Scrolls series which [...] "set them apart from other games," [...] responded immediately: [...] "Free-form experience." [...] In Rolston's view, the game's central plot is a chance to introduce the player to a cross-current of conflicting factions, background themes, and to the characters of the game, rather than the primary focus of the player's experience. [...] "Every [...] game has <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>you</b> create the kind of character you want, and then do the things you want.

500|$|... "Million Reasons" [...] {{is written}} in the key of C major with its tempo {{swinging}} around 64 beats per minute, and is accompanied by piano and guitar. Gaga's vocals span from G3 to E5 in the song, which in common time, follows a progression of C–Am–F–G, with a chorus of F–C–Am–G. During the song's chorus, Gaga croons [...] "You're giving me a million reasons <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>you</b> go / You're giving me a million reasons to quit the show". Its discussion of heartbreak and hope, as described by International Business Timess Nicholas Mojica, was guaranteed to [...] "resonate with [...] listeners" [...] of the record. Bustles Amy Roberts theorized that, {{like most of the}} songs from Joanne, [...] "Million Reasons" [...] had extra hidden depth in its lyrics and predicted it to be about Gaga's separated boyfriend Taylor Kinney. The phrase [...] "quit the show" [...] was described as a metaphor by Roberts about Gaga feeling dejected about her life, with the second verses confirming this. Both romantic heartbreak as catalyst and religious faith of the singer were represented as different sides of the lyrics. Roberts concluded by saying that [...] "hough the song may seem extremely fraught with sadness, confusion and heartache, its main message appears to be a pretty positive one".|$|E
500|$|Following the repeal, a {{committee}} of London merchants issued a public letter to Americans, warning them not to declare victory. Mason published a response in June 1766, satirizing the British position, [...] "We have, with infinite Difficulty & Fatigue got you excused this one Time; do what your Papa and Mamma bid, & hasten to return your most grateful Acknowledgements for condescending <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>you</b> keep what is your own." [...] The Townshend Acts of 1767 were Britain's next attempt to tax the colonies, placing duties on substances including lead and glass, and provoking calls from the northern colonies for a boycott of British goods. Virginia, more dependent on goods imported from Britain, was less enthusiastic, and, as local planters tended to receive goods at their river landings, a boycott {{would be difficult to}} enforce. In April 1769, Washington sent a copy of a Philadelphia resolution to Mason, asking his advice on what action Virginia should take. It is unknown who adapted that text for use in Virginia (Broadwater concluded it was Mason) but Mason sent Washington a corrected draft on April 23, 1769. Washington took it to Williamsburg, but the governor, Lord Botetourt, dissolved the legislature because of the radical resolutions it was passing. The Burgesses adjourned to a nearby tavern, and there passed a non-importation agreement based on Mason's.|$|E
