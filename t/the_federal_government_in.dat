5|$|Federal judges, when {{interpreting}} the Constitution, frequently use The Federalist Papers as a contemporary {{account of the}} intentions of the framers and ratifiers.

5|$|Increased {{presence}} of white settlers in Indian Territory prompted the United States Government {{to establish the}} Dawes Act in 1887, which divided the lands of individual tribes into allotments for individual families, encouraging farming and private land ownership among Native Americans but expropriating land to <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government.</b> <b>In</b> the process, railroad companies took nearly half of Indian-held land within the territory for outside settlers and for purchase.|$|E

5|$|The Compromise of 1850 set Texas's {{boundaries}} {{at their}} present form.

5|$|The debt {{payments}} weighed {{heavily on}} the Senators. For several years, Bryden tried to reschedule the debt on the arena.

It had re-invented itself as Covanta Energy and failed {{not long after the}} Enron scandal.

On August 1, 1944 the eight black employees being trained as streetcar motormen were to make their first trial run; that fact was used by the white PTC workers to start a massive sickout strike.|$|E

5|$|Biographer Stephen Henderson {{maintains}} that Macdonald {{played a key}} role in the wartime conscription crises that beset <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>in</b> 1942, and again in 1944, as Prime Minister Mackenzie King tried to avoid imposing compulsory military service overseas. Macdonald himself strongly favoured conscription rather than relying solely on voluntary enlistment. A committed internationalist, he believed it unfair that some bore the sacrifices of overseas service while others escaped what he saw as their military obligations. Macdonald realized however, that conscription was highly unpopular in French-speaking Quebec and that enforcing it would split the country at a time when national unity was crucial. He also recognized that in the early years of the war, voluntary enlistment was producing enough recruits to meet the needs of the armed forces.|$|E

From 1929 to 1971 the building housed Old Sun residential school, first run by the Anglicans and taken over by <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>in</b> 1969. It was converted to adult learning and stood as a campus of Mount Royal College from 1971 to 1978, at which point the Siksika Nation took over operations.

5|$|Hamilton {{regarded}} the second Pittsburgh convention {{as a serious}} threat to the operation of the laws of <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government.</b> <b>In</b> September 1792, he sent Pennsylvania tax official George Clymer to western Pennsylvania to investigate. Clymer only increased tensions with a clumsy attempt at traveling in disguise and attempting to intimidate local officials. His somewhat exaggerated report greatly influenced the decisions made by the Washington administration. Washington and Hamilton viewed resistance to federal laws in Pennsylvania as particularly embarrassing, since the national capital was then located in the same state. On his own initiative, Hamilton drafted a presidential proclamation denouncing resistance to the excise laws and submitted it to Attorney General Randolph, who toned down some of the language. Washington signed the proclamation on September 15, 1792, and it was published as a broadside and printed in many newspapers.|$|E
5|$|Hinde was {{an active}} businessman, {{pursuing}} real estate, construction, and publishing opportunities in Kentucky, Ohio and Illinois. In his early years, Hinde publicly opposed slavery. He also used his newspaper, The Fredonian, in Chillicothe, Ohio between 1806 and 1808, to highlight issues about Indian treaties and the conspiracy of Aaron Burr. He served in the War of 1812. In later years he was {{a pioneer in the}} settlement of Indiana and Illinois, and the expansion of the Methodist Church in these areas. He contributed to the Madoc Tradition and was a noted historian and biographer. Hinde cofounded the Wabash Navigation Company, which engaged in real estate speculation and dam construction. The company dammed the Wabash River next to Hinde's property, creating the Grand Rapids Dam. The dam was abandoned by <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>in</b> 1931.|$|E
