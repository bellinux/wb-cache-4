At home that night, Helen asks her husband Floyd, who is {{sitting in front of}} a window in his armchair, if he hears {{somebody}} walking outside. After he replies that he does not, the Phantom shoots him through their window. Helen inspects and sees Floyd dying. As she uses the telephone to call police, the Phantom breaks through <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> shoots her twice in the face. Despite her wounds, she drags herself {{out of the house and}} into a cornfield while the Phantom inspects Floyd's body. The Phantom stalks her with a pickaxe, but leaves when she gets help at a nearby house. News of this attack causes the town to panic, and people begin boarding up their windows.|$|E

After entering the house, one officer shouted again to identify himself, this time alerting the occupants. The occupants then became {{upset at the}} presence of the officers in the residence without permission. The officers arrested the adults and charged them with contributing to the delinquency of a minor, disorderly conduct, and intoxication. The defendants filed a motion to suppress with the trial court. The trial court sided with the defendants, and the city twice appealed to the Utah Court of Appeals and the Utah Supreme Court, which both affirmed the trial court's ruling.|$|E
50|$|The song uses {{an analogy}} {{of a common}} {{childhood}} fear of a windstorm to frame a young man's failing relationship with a woman. Here, the protagonist recalls being comforted by his mother as a gusting, howling wind smacks <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> causes him to be frightened. The scene then shifts to the present, where he reveals his relationship difficulties and a fight that causes the woman to leave. Upon hearing the screen door slam shut, he remembers his childhood and wishes aloud that her leaving is just temporary ("It's only the wind, and nothing more/not {{the end of my}} world, walking out the door"), knowing that in this case, he has no one to comfort him.|$|E

50|$|Over {{the next}} few days, many things happen. Skye now likes Jeffrey very much, and she, Jane, and Jeffrey play soccer and archery almost every day. They name their target Dexter Dupree, {{with a picture of}} Dexter's smirking face on it, and their soccer ball Pencey Military Academy. Also, Batty finds out that Cagney has rabbits, so she, Cagney, and Rosalind visit them in Cagney's apartment.. Yaz comes out from under the couch when Cagney has parsley, as usual, it's the first time Carla's ever come out when strangers are around, because she likes Batty so much. Rosalind and Batty start to visit the rabbits almost every morning. Sometimes Cagney was at his apartment, but usually he wasn't. Batty would always slip a carrot through <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> then she must latch the door. If she doesn't, Cagney explains, Yaz will run away, get killed by an animal, and then Carla would die of loneliness, since she and Yaz are best friends.|$|E
50|$|The Penguin, Hawkeye and Sparrow swing {{across to}} Robbins' terrace on giant umbrellas; Penguin enters through <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> he gasses Dawn to sleep. As Batman and Robin {{try to stop}} the Penguin, a {{powerful}} magnet the Penguin had positioned just outside is turned on and they are pulled to it because of the metal in their utility belts, immobilizing them. It is later revealed that Batman and Robin had escaped from the magnet by a room service waiter and return to police headquarters. Knowing Penguin is listening in through the umbrella's bug, they announce that the ransom will be paid at Wayne Manor and that Batman and Robin will be waiting inside the armor statues immediately inside in the entrance hall. The Penguin goes to Wayne Manor and returns the actress. He then uses his gas-umbrella to knock out anyone inside the statues. He returns to his hideout to find out that Batman and Robin were waiting there; there had been dummies inside the statues all along. The Penguin is apprehended.|$|E

5000|$|Four Brigham City police {{officers}} {{responded to a}} complaint of a loud party. They arrived at the offending residence at about {{three o'clock in the}} morning. They traveled {{to the back of the}} house to investigate the noise. From a location in the driveway, the officers peered through a slat fence and observed two apparently underage males drinking alcohol. The officers then entered the backyard through a gate, thereby obtaining a clear view into the back of the house through a screen door and two windows. The officers saw four adults restraining one juvenile. The juvenile broke free, swung a fist and struck one of the adults in the face. Two officers then opened <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> [...] "hollered" [...] to identify themselves. When no one heard them, they entered the kitchen. After entering, one of the officers again shouted to identify and call attention to himself. As those present in the kitchen became aware of the officers, they became angry that the officers had entered the house without permission.|$|E
5000|$|After {{a botched}} {{insertion}} in which giant bottom-feeders called [...] "Leviathans" [...] attack the squad and force them ashore, the team manages {{to make its}} way through the base's grounds, solving riddles that let them progress through the area as well as dealing with Umbrella's newest creation, called [...] "Trisquads," [...] which are essentially zombies who have retained enough intelligence and motor capabilities to use automatic weapons. When Karen Driver is accidentally infected with the T-virus after touching contaminated blood, the others rush through the many caves and underground tunnels searching for the bases' lab, fending off more of Umbrella's biological monstrosities. Steve takes Karen and manages to find the labs, but the two are then taken captive by Griffith. Karen turns into a zombie and kills one of Griffith's servant zombies while Griffith injects a stunned Steve with the T-virus. Under Griffith's orders, Steve lures Rebecca, David, and John into a trap in which John is severely wounded. Griffith then orders Steve to lock Rebecca and David in an airlock chamber and flood it. He then orders Steve to kill himself, which he does. As the chamber floods, Rebecca notices Karen's body and remembers that she carried a World War II [...] "pineapple" [...] fragmentation grenade with her as a good luck charm from her father. David pries the pin out of the ancient explosive and jams it in between <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> inside door of the chamber. The resulting explosion forces the outside door to open, allowing Rebecca and David to swim to the surface and to safety. The explosion forces the inside door to blow off its hinges, killing Griffith instantly.|$|E

FDR biographer Jim Bishop {{wrote about the}} death scene: [...] "… a snapping, snarling series of barks was heard. No one had paid any {{attention}} to Fala. He had been dozing {{in a corner of the}} room. For a reason beyond understanding, he ran directly for <b>the</b> front <b>screen</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> bashed his black head against it. <b>The</b> <b>screen</b> broke and he crawled through and ran snapping and barking up into the hills.

50|$|Screens with {{apertures}} {{small enough}} to block termites were developed in Australia and have widely used in the United States, mostly for plumbing penetrations, since the 1990s. One of the early uses of screens for pest exclusion was <b>the</b> implementation of <b>screen</b> <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> window coverings. <b>Screens</b> are required by building codes at vent openings. To exclude rats, screen openings must be ½” (13.7 mm) or smaller. To exclude mice, a screen aperture size of ¼” or smaller is required. Most insects can be excluded with screens measuring 1/16” (1.59mm) in aperture size, but to effectively exclude subterranean termites, required screen apertures measure 1/55” (0.46 mm). Application areas for <b>screens</b> in <b>the</b> building envelope include weep holes, soffits, gable and ridge vents, among others.|$|R
50|$|When the {{building}} opened in 1921, elevations to both Arlington Street and Piccadilly {{were faced with}} Portland stone. Wolseley's car showroom occupied the entire ground floor. The interior walls were of polished Portland stone with blue York stone dressings, and the floor laid with white and black marble in intricate geometric designs, which remain today. The ceiling consisted of nine domes supported by Doric columns finished in red Japanese lacquer. Red, black and gold lacquer were also used on <b>the</b> <b>doors,</b> <b>screens</b> <b>and</b> wall panels. Lighting was provided by elaborate bronze pendants and concealed lamps which threw their rays into the domes to be reflected to the floor. Apart from covering the red lacquer columns with a black wrapping, the present interior remains {{very close to the}} original designs of William Curtis Green.|$|R
40|$|In {{previous}} research 2 -year-olds {{have failed to}} show knowledge of solidity in a search task in which a ball rolled behind a screen and was stopped by a barrier. <b>The</b> <b>screen</b> had four <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> barrier was visible above the door hiding the ball. To establish what cues 2 -year-olds might be using, precise point-of-gaze measures were taken during the hiding event. A transparent <b>screen</b> with opaque <b>doors</b> provided two cues: (1) the ball could be tracked until it failed to emerge, and (2) the barrier’s position could indicate the correct door. Point-of-gaze measures revealed that children failed to use the more indirect cue of the barrier, which requires reasoning and spatial integration. Their search success was predicted only by the more immediate cue of actively tracking the ball. These findings support the claim that children use best those cues {{directly related to the}} object’s disappearance, while failing to use cues that entail higher cognitive demands...|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> {{effect of}} <b>screening</b> <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> windows on indoor density of Anopheles arabiensis in {{south-west}} Ethiopia: a randomized trial Fekadu Massebo 1, 2 * and Bernt Lindtjørn 2 Background: Screening of houses might have impact on density of indoor host-seeking Anopheles mosquitoes. A randomized trial of <b>screening</b> windows <b>and</b> <b>doors</b> with metal mesh, and closing openings on eves and walls by mud {{was conducted to}} assess if reduce indoor densities of biting mosquitoes. Methods: Mosquitoes were collected in forty houses using Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC) light traps biweekly in March and April 2011. A randomization of houses into control and intervention groups was done based on the baseline data. Windows <b>and</b> <b>doors</b> of 20 houses were screened by metal mesh, and openings {{on the walls and}} eves closed by mud and the rest 20 houses were used as control group. Mosquitoes were collected biweekly in October and November 2011 from both control and intervention houses. A Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) with a negative binomial error distribution was used to account for over dispersion of Anopheles arabiensis and culicine counts and repeated catches made in the same house. Results: <b>Screening</b> <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> windows, and closing openings on eves and wall by mud reduced the overall indoor densities of An. arabiensis by 40 %. The effect of screenings pronounced on unfed An. arabiensis by resulting 42 % reduction in houses with interventions. The total costs for <b>screening</b> windows <b>and</b> <b>doors,</b> <b>and</b> to close openings on the eves and walls by mud was 7. 34 USD per house. Conclusion: Screening houses reduced indoor density of An. arabiensis, and it was cheap and can easily incorporated into malaria vector strategies by local communities, but improving <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> windows fitness for screening should be considered during house construction to increase the efficacy of screenings...|$|R
50|$|The {{most obvious}} {{way to prevent}} the {{contraction}} and spread of direct contact diseases is to try not to touch door handles at all, of course {{this is not always}} possible. Therefore, thoroughly washing your hands after going to the bathroom or returning from a public place should be a behaviour that is instilled in children from an early age though this is not enough to stop most germs from breeding. Automatic doors {{are becoming more and more}} popular in hospitals, chemists and other public buildings due to them reducing the risk of cross-contamination since there is no need to handle the door at all. Another prevention technique, which is mainly used in luxury hotels, is the use of a doorman who will open <b>and</b> close <b>the</b> main <b>door,</b> <b>screening</b> visitors <b>and</b> deliveries. These mean passers through do not have to touch the door at all therefore eliminating all risk of catching or passing on direct contact diseases. Precautionary measures which can be taken in order to prevent such diseases include wearing gloves, using paper towel or tissues to open handles or using tools, like the loodini, to avoid using door handles all together.|$|R

30|$|In 1958, {{the writers}} Guy Debord and Michèle Bernstein, who were friends of Gallizio and co-founders of the “International Situationist”, invited Gallizio in person {{to give an}} {{exhibition}} at the “Galerie René Drouin” in Paris. The project was to cover the entire gallery space (from floor to ceiling) – the white walls which were normally adorned with paintings – with about 150 meters of industrial painting, thus converting the gallery into a synesthetic environment. It was for this project that Gallizio created, in 1958 – 59, La Caverna dell’Antimateria (“The Cave of Antimatter”; inventory number: 58 DT 38) as a “work-environment” that provided a concrete representation {{of the theory of}} the Anti-World and gave a voice to the new concept of matter as advanced by contemporary physics [1]. The work consisted of nine painted canvases that served to cover the ceiling, walls and floor, and six painted curtains to <b>screen</b> <b>the</b> front <b>door</b> <b>and</b> the staircase on the left wall. All the canvases were painted with different colours that were mixed and/or overlaid with each other. As reported in his Diario-Registro (“Diary-Register”), Gallizio used several pictorial techniques: “olio tradizionale” (“traditional oil”), “soffitto […] resine soffiate a polvere, graffite ad umido” (“ceiling […]: powder-blown resins, wet-painted engraved”), “pavimenti – tela di lino preparata con vinavil […] tecnica delle aniline alla nitro” (“floors: linen canvas prepared with vinavil […] nitro aniline technique”), “tecnica a fuoco, le grandi sacche vengono intaccate con ferro rovente e soffiate – si rompono le sacche con effetti grandi” (“Fire technique: the large bags are burned with a red-hot iron tool and then blown up – the bags break with great effects”). According to the testimony of his son, Giorgio Gallizio, in fact, the canvases for the ceiling were made {{on the roof of the}} “Experimental Laboratory of Alba” (where Pinot Gallizio created his works). On that occasion, the artist sewed bags containing pigments and firecrackers, and these were blown up in order to randomly sprinkle colours on canvases that had previously been prepared with Vinavil® glue [2],[3].|$|R
