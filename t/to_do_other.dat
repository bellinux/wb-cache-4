To be accepted and respected, he resolves to become Konohagakure's Hokage and surpass all previous leaders, no matter the difficulties. While becoming a ninja, Naruto forms friendships that he initially lacked, linking {{some of them to}} family relationships. Although Naruto sometimes finds himself unable to accomplish the tasks he proposes <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> <b>other</b> characters believe that he will be an excellent Hokage because of his positive impact on their lives.|$|E

Afterward, the group began working on the band's next studio album. McCaslin worked on the second album by his side-project, The Operation M.D. Jocz toured as a drummer for The Vandals, and Whibley toured with his then-wife, Avril Lavigne.|$|E
5|$|When {{the time}} came to begin You Only Live Twice, the {{producers}} were faced with the problem of a disenchanted star. Sean Connery had stated that he was tired of playing James Bond and all of the associated commitment (time spent filming and publicising each movie), together with finding it difficult <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>other</b> work, which would potentially lead to typecasting. Saltzman and Broccoli were able to persuade Connery by increasing his fee for the film, but geared up to look for a replacement.|$|E

5|$|General Douglas MacArthur, the {{commander}} of Allied forces in the SWPA, decided on 6June to postpone the Selaru operation until after Allied forces landed in the Philippines. This was not communicated to No.80 Wing, however, and Caldwell continued to develop plans for its involvement in the Selaru operation until late August. The effective cancellation of the operation left No.80 Wing without a clear mission, and its pilots were left with nothing <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>other</b> than train. In September Air Commodore Alan Charlesworth, {{the commander}} of North-Western Area, reported to Bostock that the wing's morale could drop {{if it was not}} either given an active role or transferred to southern Australia. During the same period No.80 Wing's pilots observed that No.1 Wing's Spitfires were making occasional strafing attacks on Japanese positions in the NEI and sought approval to conduct similar operations. Caldwell did not agree to this, however, as be believed that the risks associated with flying Spitfires to the edge of their range to attack unimportant targets outweighed any benefits to morale.|$|E
5|$|Prisoners in the Agra jail {{were trained}} and kept {{employed}} as carpet weavers {{as part of}} their rehabilitation. In 1886, 34 convicts travelled to London to demonstrate carpet weaving at the Colonial and Indian Exhibition in South Kensington. Karim did not accompany the prisoners, but assisted Jail Superintendent John Tyler in organising the trip, and helped to select the carpets and weavers. When Queen Victoria visited the exhibition, Tyler gave her a gift of two gold bracelets, again chosen with the assistance of Karim. The Queen had a longstanding interest in her Indian territories and wished to employ some Indian servants for her Golden Jubilee. She asked Tyler to recruit two attendants who would be employed for a year. Karim was hastily coached in British manners and in the English language and sent to England, along with Mohammed Buksh. Major-General Thomas Dennehy, who was about to be appointed to the Royal Household, had previously employed Buksh as a servant. It was planned that the two Indian men would initially wait at table, and learn <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>other</b> tasks.|$|E

25|$|In December 1982, the {{original}} Spirit line-up re-formed and recorded several songs {{from their first}} four albums (as well as a few new tracks) live on a soundstage. The band was joined by several guests, including Jeff Baxter and Bob Welch. The resulting Spirit of '84 (released internationally as The Thirteenth Dream) was initially recorded for an audiophile label; however, Mercury Records re-signed the band (including a California solo deal) and released the album in 1984. The album was only a moderate critical success and failed to chart. While some of {{the original}} members went on <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>other</b> projects, California and Cassidy continued touring with new members Scott Monahan on keyboards and Dave Waterbury on bass.|$|E

25|$|From {{the early}} 1970s, Forbes divided his {{energies}} between cinema, television, theatre and writing. In 1972, Forbes started {{work on the}} documentary, Elton John and Bernie Taupin Say Goodbye Norma Jean and Other Things (1973), which chronicled {{the life of the}} young Elton John and Bernie Taupin. The project took Forbes a full year to complete, and provided a behind-the-scenes look at the writing and recording of Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, including interviews with John, Taupin and band members, including Nigel Olsson and Dee Murray, as well as John's mother, Sheila, DJM label head Dick James and son Stephen, and footage of John's Hollywood Bowl concert in 1973. (Some of the footage was licensed for the Eagle Vision Classic Albums series Goodbye Yellow Brick Road documentary.) During the filming, Forbes formed a close friendship with John and Taupin, which led him <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>other</b> work with them, including photography on the Don't Shoot Me I'm Only the Piano Player and Goodbye Yellow Brick Road album sleeves. ITV transmitted the documentary in the UK on 4 December 1973 (in the US, ABC screened it) shortly after completion, and was later briefly issued on VHS.|$|E

She recovered fast enough to complete a Japanese tour, <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>other</b> European shows supporting Rainbow on their Difficult to Cure tour and to start working on new material for the next album. However, the gruelling schedule of recordings, promotional work and concerts had started to take its toll on the group, with bassist Enid Williams the first to give up, right {{after the release of}} [...] Wildlife in March 1982, an EP designed to launch the upcoming album. On the recommendation of Lemmy, Williams was replaced by Ghislaine 'Gil' Weston, former bassist of the punk band The Killjoys.|$|E

By 1959, Skelton {{was the only}} comedian with a weekly variety television show; others who remained on the air, such as Danny Thomas, were performing their routines as part of situation comedy programs. He performed a preview show for a studio audience on Mondays, using their reactions to determine which skits needed to be edited for the Tuesday program. [...] For the Tuesday afternoon run-through prior to the actual show, he ignored the script for the most part, ad-libbing through it at will.

500|$|In 1988, Kim Deal of the Pixies and Tanya Donelly of Throwing Muses became {{good friends}} {{when the two}} bands toured Europe together. Deal and Donelly spent time playing guitar and {{drinking}} beer, and shared musical ideas with each other. During the tour, and later in Boston—the hometown of both groups—the two friends often went clubbing together. On one outing at a Sugarcubes concert, dance music was playing between sets, and the two drunkenly decided to write and record some dance songs. They envisioned an [...] "organic dance band" [...] that would consist of Deal on bass, Donelly on guitar, and two drummers; they recorded Donelly's composition [...] "Rise" [...] with Throwing Muses' David Narcizo, and planned <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>other</b> originals, {{as well as a}} cover of Rufus and Chaka Khan's [...] "Tell Me Something Good". However, Deal and Donelly eventually decided that their dance music concept was not working well, and did not pursue it.|$|E
500|$|Carpenter {{had just}} made Dark Star but {{no one wanted to}} hire him as a director, so he assumed that he would make it in Hollywood as a screenwriter. The filmmaker went on <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>other</b> films with the {{intention}} of making Escape later. After the success of Halloween, Avco-Embassy signed him and producer Debra Hill to a two-picture deal. The first film from this contract was The Fog. Initially, the second film {{that he was going to}} make to finish the contract was The Philadelphia Experiment, but because of script-writing problems, Carpenter rejected it in favor of this project. However, Carpenter felt that something was missing and recalls, [...] "This was basically a straight action film. And at one point, I realized it really doesn't have this kind of crazy humor that people from New York would expect to see." [...] He brought in Nick Castle, a friend from his film school days at University of Southern California who played [...] "The Shape" [...] in Halloween. Castle invented the Cabbie character and came up with the film's ending.|$|E
500|$|Davis {{often left}} {{considerable}} time between band engagements, which allowed the musicians <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>other</b> work, so Kelly continued to record with other leaders, including {{with other members}} of the Davis band. In February 1959, when in Chicago for performances with Davis, Kelly was pianist on Cannonball Adderley Quintet in Chicago, and bassist Chambers' Go. Later that year, Kelly made his first album for Vee-Jay Records, in a quintet containing Wayne Shorter; Kelly returned the favor a few months later by playing on the saxophonist's debut as leader, Introducing Wayne Shorter. Kelly also recorded with Coltrane, including for one track, [...] "Naima", from the saxophonist's Giant Steps. When Adderley left Davis in late 1959, he attempted to recruit Kelly; although the pianist declined, he did participate in more recording sessions led by his former bandmate, as well as more with Griffin, Mobley, Morgan, and numerous others. Kelly made his first recording with guitarist Wes Montgomery in 1961; they then made Full House the next year; the pairing was described by The Penguin Guide to Jazz as [...] "an association that promised a lot and delivered more".|$|E
