40|$|This study {{investigated}} whether a corticosteroid mix containing <b>tixocortol</b> pivalate, budesonide, and hydrocortisone- 17 -butyrate could detect contact allergy to corticosteroids. 2 corticosteroid mixes, 1 {{with a high}} (mix I) and 1 with a low (mix II) concentration and the 3 individual constituents, each at 2 concentrations, were inserted into the standard series of 16 participating clinics. Tests were read on day (D) 3 or 4. 5432 patients were tested, and 110 (2. 0 %) had positive reactions to at least 1 of the 8 test preparations. Of the 8 preparations, mix I identified most allergic patients, followed by mix II, budesonide 0. 10 %, budesonide 0. 002 %, and <b>tixocortol</b> pivalate, both concentrations (1. 0 and 0. 10 %) tracing the same number. With the mixes, 53. 2 - 59. 6 % of <b>tixocortol</b> pivalate allergy was missed. 47 patients were allergic to either concentration of <b>tixocortol</b> pivalate, 25 % of these only to 1. 0 % and another 25 % only to 0. 10 %. Testing with mix I and <b>tixocortol</b> pivalate 0. 10 % picked up 98 / 110, testing with <b>tixocortol</b> pivalate 1. 0 % and 0. 10 % and budesonide 0. 10 % picked up 105 / 110. 3379 patients were read on both D 3 or D 4 {{as well as on}} D 7.

40|$|Of patch-tested {{patients}} with dermatitis, 4 - 5 % are allergic to corticosteroids. Four groups of corticosteroids are recognized (A-D), where substances {{from the same}} group may cross-react. We investigated the potential cross-reactivity pattern and dose-response relationship for several corticosteroids from group A. We also included the corresponding aldehyde to hydrocortisone, as this degradation product has been proposed to be immunogenic. Eleven patients shown to be allergic to <b>tixocortol</b> pivalate were patch-tested with several corticosteroids from group A, {{as well as with}} the aldehyde, all in serial dilutions. All 11 reacted to both <b>tixocortol</b> pivalate and hydrocortisone. The dose-response relationship for the corticosteroids tended to be similar to sensitizers lacking anti-inflammatory potential. Patients with simultaneous reactions to many substances had high patch-test reactivity to <b>tixocortol</b> pivalate and hydrocortisone, while {{patients with}} few such reactions showed low reactivity (p= 0. 001 and 0. 003, respectively). Several patients reacted to the aldehyde, supporting the theory that it is an intermediate in sensitization. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|<b>Tixocortol</b> pivalate, the 21 -thiol {{derivative}} of hydrocortisone. is a newly synthesized steroid with topical anti-inflammatory properties but is devoid of systemic glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid activities and toxicity. The {{mechanism of action}} appears {{to be similar to}} that of other corticosteroids with regard to steroid binding sites and prostaglandin biosynthesis, however. the disassociation between local and systemic effects is due to a 'first pass' liver metabolism and rapid transformation with in red blood cells. ln both open and controlled studies in patients with acute or recurrent distal colitis, clinical efficacy has been noted at doses of 250 mg to 1000 mg in 100 ml solution without an effect on scrum cortisol levels or blood chemistries. <b>Tixocortol</b> pivalate has consistently shown to be as effective as systemically absorbed steroids for the treatment of distal ulcerative colitis with out the undesirable effects associated with currently available steroid preparations...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND AND DESIGN: Most corticosteroid-allergic {{patients}} {{react to}} several corticosteroids. Irrefutable proof {{for the existence}} of cross-reactions is provided by reactions to substances to which the patient has never been exposed. Four groups of cross-reactions have been proposed, and our own observations support this. However, we have found that budesonide, in particular, tends to be involved not only in cross-reactions with corticosteroids of its own group (group B) but also with those of the ester group (group D). To test clinical observations on patients sensitive to corticosteroids and to establish a molecular basis for cross-reactivity patterns, a statistical analysis of our cases and a conformational study of major corticosteroids were performed. RESULTS: Statistically highly significant positive or negative correlations were found for the combination of <b>tixocortol</b> pivalate plus hydrocortisone and hydrocortisone plus budesonide, respectively. This indicates that budesonide and hydrocortisone or <b>tixocortol</b> pivalate detect different groups of corticosteroid-sensitive patients. Moreover, significant positive correlations were found between budesonide and amcinonide, both molecules belonging to the acetonide group C, and also between budesonide and some esters of group D such as hydrocortisone- 17 butyrate and alclometasone dipropionate. These clinical observations were fully supported by a conformational analysis of the electronic shape of corticosteroids involved in this study. Groups A, B, and D were found to be highly homogeneous within each group in terms of molecular structures, while significant differences were observed among the groups. The special behavior of budesonide can be fully explained on the base of its unique molecular structure. Finally, molecular characteristics have been defined for each group. This could be useful for the prediction of potential cross-reactions to new corticosteroid molecules. CONCLUSIONS: The statistical analysis confirms that <b>tixocortol</b> pivalate and hydrocortisone contact allergies are definitely associated, while reactions to budesonide are strongly correlated with the reactions to both the acetonide group and the ester group. These clinical observations are fully supported by the conformational analysis of the molecules involved in this study. <b>Tixocortol</b> pivalate and budesonide should certainly be added to the standard series for the detection of patients sensitized to corticosteroids. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|It {{would be}} ideal to treat {{inflammatory}} bowel disease with topical corticosteroids that are either not absorbed through the mucosa, or have a substantial first-pass hepatic metabolism. The topical use of hydrocortisone, prednisolone- 21 -phosphate or betamethasone {{is often associated with}} systemic side-effects. Newer corticosteroid preparations (prednisolone metasulphobenzoate, <b>tixocortol</b> pivalate, fluticasone propionate, beclomethasone dipropionate and budesonide) are usually associated with minimal systemic corticosteroid activity.

40|$|Corticosteroids are {{anti-inflammatory}} and anti-proliferative {{substances that}} also can induce sensitization, mainly through skin contact. In a sensitized individual, {{it can be}} hard to disclose the contact allergy at patch testing because the anti-inflammatory effect may mask the allergic contact reaction. This is primarily seen when patch testing to potent corticosteroids is performed and the reading is done early, when the anti-inflammatory effect still prevails. In this thesis I present a hypothetical model, which can explain the different situations that emerge, when the anti-inflammatory effect influences the elicitation depending on the individual degree of hypersensitivity in a sensitized subject. Some patients allergic to the corticosteroid budesonide only reacted to very low concentrations of the sensitizer at early readings. When patch testing the corticosteroid triamcinolone acetonide, concentrations 1000 to 10, 000 times lower than internationally recommended resulted in allergic reactions while the recommended concentration gave negative reactions. If testing with a corticosteroid at a high concentration results in a negative patch-test reaction, lowering the concentration may result in a positive patch-test reaction. Introducing another parameter into the model, the time factor, made it possible also to explain why negative patch test reactions are sometimes seen at early readings, while the tests may turn positive on late reading occasions. Therefore, not to miss contact allergy to corticosteroids, a reading after one week in addition to an early reading is advocated. The multi-centre study showed that 25 % of the allergic reactions to corticosteroids would have been missed if a late reading had not been done. The edge reaction, consisting of a blank centre representing the whole area of the test unit and surrounded by an eczematous infiltrate, is seen in some corticosteroid allergic patients when potent corticosteroids are patch-tested. This phenomenon can also be explained by the same model. If an edge reaction appears, a late reading or testing with a lower concentration should be done. I also investigated the cross-reactivity pattern for the two diastereomers of budesonide, the R and S diastereomers, and found that results concurred with the theory that the R diastereomer cross-reacts with other substances from the group to which it belongs, group B, while the S diastereomer cross-reacts not only with other group B substances but also with some esters of group D. No inhibition of the patch test reactions was observed when patch testing the corticosteroid <b>tixocortol</b> pivalate and potentially cross-reacting substances at high concentrations. Aldehydes of corticosteroids are thought to be intermediates in the sensitization process. The aldehyde of hydrocortisone was therefore tested in subjects allergic to hydrocortisone. Patients reacting to hydrocortisone also reacted to the aldehyde, speaking in favour of the aldehyde being an intermediate in the sensitization. When trying to elucidate whether a corticosteroid mix, consisting of the three corticosteroids budesonide, <b>tixocortol</b> pivalate and hydrocortisone- 17 -butyrate (Hc- 17 -B) in petrolatum, could disclose corticosteroid allergy I found that 60 % of the patients allergic to <b>tixocortol</b> pivalate were missed. Thus, in a corticosteroid mix containing budesonide and Hc- 17 -B, <b>tixocortol</b> pivalate should not be a part. Of the separate markers that were patch-tested simultaneously in petrolatum, budesonide 0. 10 % detected most allergic subjects, followed by budesonide 0. 002 % and <b>tixocortol</b> pivalate, both concentrations (1. 0 % and 0. 10 %) detecting the same number of patients. Hc- 17 -B at 1. 0 % detected more than 0. 10 %. Investigations on the stability of budesonide, <b>tixocortol</b> pivalate and Hc- 17 -B patch-test preparations in petrolatum disclosed that these were stable for at least one year in room temperature, refrigerated and frozen. Budesonide and <b>tixocortol</b> pivalate in ethanol showed the same stability. Hc- 17 -B 1. 0 % in ethanol was only stable frozen for one year and at room temperature for three months. In the study on local clinical relevance, the flare-up reactions in the budesonide-allergic individuals consisted not only of a severe deterioration of the Preferid® treated eczema but also toxicoderma-like eruptions with a conspicuous distribution. A correlation was found between contact allergy to budesonide and deterioration of the eczema treated with Preferid® cream containing budesonide. To study flare-up reactions at earlier budesonide test sites a systemic provocation with Pulmicort® Turbuhaler® (budesonide) via inhalation was performed in subjects allergic to budesonide but without asthma or other lung dysfunction. The study clearly showed that flare-up reactions were found after normal doses of budesonide. Therefore, a person hypersensitive to budesonide should not be given the drug as an inhalant. In the same study a new method in humans to test for cross-sensitivity was used. When budesonide was inhaled, a flare-up was noted where triamcinolone acetonide had been tested previously, indicating cross-reactivity between budesonide and triamcinolone acetonide...|$|E

A 38 -year-old male patient had first an allergic contact dermatitis to topically applied prednisolone acetate and then a disseminated eczematous exanthema upon oral intake of prednisone. A delayed-type sensitization to corticosteroids from group A such as hydrocortisone, prednisone and <b>tixocortol</b> pivalate was identified.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Contact {{hypersensitivity}} to corticosteroids {{is increasingly}} reported {{and has been}} identified as a problem of considerable clinical relevance. The prevalence of positive patch tests to corticosteroids ranges from 0. 2 up to 5 %. OBJECTIVE: The prevalence of positive patch tests to corticosteroids in Switzerland was determined in a multi-centre study of patients undergoing routine patch tests. METHODS: As representatives of corticosteroid groups, the following substances were used for screening: <b>tixocortol</b> pivalate and hydrocortisone for group A (hydrocortisone type), hydrocortisone butyrate for group D (hydrocortisone butyrate type) and budesonide for both groups B (triamcinolone type) and D. Patients positive for at least one corticosteroid were retested with the screening series and 12 corticosteroids commonly used in Switzerland. RESULTS: Among 3, 016 consecutive patients, 65 individuals (2. 2 %) with a total of 106 positive reactions were found. Retesting showed a concordance of 70 - 98 %, depending on the corticosteroid and the score of the positive reaction. In the subsequently tested corticosteroid series including 12 substances, 19 out of 56 screening-positive patients had a positive result to one or several corticosteroids. There were only few evident cross-reactive patterns in between the corticosteroids tested. CONCLUSIONS: Corticosteroids should be included in routine patch testing, because contact sensitization to a corticosteroid is of considerable practical importance. We confirm that as markers of corticosteroid sensitization <b>tixocortol</b> pivalate, budesonide and hydrocortisone butyrate may be suited, because there is no single corticosteroid which is a marker for all four corticosteroid groups. Patch test reactions of 2 + or higher have a better reproducibility than 1 + reactions...|$|E
40|$|Inhaled and {{intranasal}} corticosteroids (CS) {{are used}} to treat various inflammatory or allergic diseases of {{the upper and lower}} respiratory tract. Despite their wide use, only a few reports about their sensitization potential have been published. We determined the frequency, clinical signs and molecules responsible for skin allergic reactions following inhalation of corticosteroids amongst patients with identified and investigated "contact allergy" to corticosteroids. We reviewed clinical data, patch test results and sensitization sources in patients who reacted positively to corticosteroids tested in the K. U. Leuven Dermatology department during an 18 -year period. 12 subjects (out of 315 with contact allergy to CS) presented with allergic manifestations due to nasal or orally inhaled corticosteroids, 11 of which were due to budesonide and one to <b>tixocortol</b> pivalate. Amongst patients with "contact allergy" to corticosteroids, very few were found with allergic manifestations due to inhaled corticosteroids. Budesonide was the major allergen found. Other inhalation corticosteroids such as beclomethasone, mometasone and fluticasone derivatives may, in most cases, still be used, since they do not cross react with budesonide...|$|E
40|$|Topical {{corticosteroids}} and sunscreens are extensively used formulations, both as over-the-counter {{products and}} as prescription medicines. Topical corticosteroids {{are increasingly being}} recognized as causes of allergic contact dermatitis. Because of their anti-inflammatory property, contact allergy to these agents {{may be difficult to}} suspect and prove. With corticosteroid allergy, there are special issues in patch testing that need to be considered: Screening tests need to be done with budesonide and <b>tixocortol</b> pivalate, and delayed readings are essential to pick up all positive cases. Preventive advice needs to be tailored according to the structural and chemical peculiarities of a particular molecule. Sunscreen allergy is a significant part of cosmetic allergy; especially in cases of photoallergic reactions. Each passing decade is bringing forth new allergens in this class.

40|$|Topical {{corticosteroids}} are {{the mainstay}} treatment for atopic dermatitis (AD) and other inflammatory skin disorders. These drugs can cause however contact allergy whose exact prevalence {{in the general}} population is unknown, as is in patients suffering from inflammatory skin diseases. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the prevalence of contact sensitization to topical corticosteroids in pediatric patients with AD. For this purpose, 71 children with AD (mean age, 7. 6 yrs; range, 5 - 12 yrs) consecutively attending the pediatric ambulatory of our unit were evaluated. They all had used topical corticosteroids for more than 6 months during the last 2 yrs. Children were patch tested with the childhood series, with markers of sensitization to corticosteroid allergy and with the topical preparations used by the patients. The results of patch testing showed the presence of contact sensitization to corticosteroids (<b>tixocortol</b> pivalate, hydrocortisone- 17 -butyrate and with the commercial preparation named Locoidon) in only one patient (1. 4 %), suggesting that contact sensitization to topical steroids in AD children appears to be rare, despite the frequent use of such drug...|$|E
40|$|Because the glucocorticosteroid {{receptor}} {{seems to}} be uniform in the human body, there is currently no support for a possibility of separating the therapeutic and adverse glucocorticosteroid actions at the receptor level. However, based on {{a new generation of}} glucocorticosteroids characterized by a high first pass metabolism in the liver, it seems possible today co reach a more selective topical therapy of inflammatory bowel disease. The properties of three new glucocorticosteroids are presented: the highly potent budesonide, fluticasone propionate and <b>tixocortol</b> pivalate - the latter with only low topical potency. Their properties can be exemplified by budesonide, which is currently the best documented compound. The topical potency of budesonide is 200 and 15 times higher than chose of hydrocortisone and prednisolone, respectively. This means that there is a high potential for anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive actions on rectal and bowel mucosa. The compound is metabolically stable in the bowel compartment, which allows full retention of glucocorticosteroid activity in the target organ. However, when absorbed and distributed to the liver, there is a 90 % first pass hepatic metabolism co metabolites of very low potency. This suggests that after topical application to rectal or bowel mucosa, glucocorticosteroid activity in the systemic circulation is low. This is in contrast to prednisolone, which has a hepatic first pass metabolism of just 20 %...|$|E
