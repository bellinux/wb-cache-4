25|$|At {{the crack}} of dawn, scores of mud-covered, barely dressed devotees make their appearance, asking for alms and candles form the wide awake town folks. This {{practice}} mimics a biblical myth about St. John the Baptist, who {{was said to have}} done <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> his lifetime. A special mass culminates the occasion, reinforcing its spiritual nature to the people of Aliaga.|$|E

Sady Doyle who has been the target of online threats noted the [...] "overwhelmingly impersonal, repetitive, stereotyped quality" [...] of the abuse, the fact that [...] "all of us are being called <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>things,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> tone." ...|$|R
25|$|As {{early as}} 1913, David Waterston of King's College London {{published}} in Nature his {{conclusion that the}} sample consisted of an ape mandible and human skull. Likewise, French paleontologist Marcellin Boule concluded <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> 1915. A third opinion from the American zoologist Gerrit Smith Miller concluded that Piltdown's jaw came from a fossil ape. In 1923, Franz Weidenreich examined the remains and correctly reported that they consisted of a modern human cranium and an orangutan jaw with filed-down teeth.|$|E
25|$|Although the Britons {{gathered}} in considerable force, they {{are said to}} have been poorly equipped, as the Iceni had been disarmed before the rebellion. They placed their wagon train in a crescent at their end of the field, from which point their families could watch what they may have expected to be an overwhelming victory. Two Germanic leaders, Boiorix of the Cimbri and Ariovistus of the Suebi, are reported to have done <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> their battles against Gaius Marius and Julius Caesar respectively.|$|E
25|$|FIFA {{reviewed}} {{the possibility of}} increasing Suárez's ban but decided against punishing him for 'unsportsmanlike conduct'. This opened up a discussion on gamesmanship, asking {{the question of whether}} players in that situation should be condemned as a cheat, or applauded for their resourcefulness. One pundit, Paul Fletcher of the BBC, implied that most players would do <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> the 'heat of the moment' in order to avoid defeat. Ghana's sports minister, Akua Sena Dansua, called for changes to the rules in such circumstances.|$|E

60|$|Kennicott, Sam Clark, Jackson Elder, young Dr. McGanum, and James Madison Howland, {{teetering on}} their toes near the stove, conversed with the sedate pomposity of the commercialist.

25|$|In music theory, a {{distinction}} is made between a diatonic semitone, or minor second (an interval encompassing two staff positions, e.g. from C to D) and a chromatic semitone or augmented unison (an interval between two notes {{at the same}} staff position, e.g. from C to C). These are enharmonically equivalent when twelve-tone equal temperament is used, but are not <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> meantone temperament, where the diatonic semitone is distinguished from and larger than the chromatic semitone (augmented unison.) See Interval (music)#Number for more details about this terminology.|$|E
25|$|People began petitioning the King {{for relief}} against unfair judgments, {{and as the}} number of petitioners rapidly grew, so the King {{delegated}} the task of hearing petitions to the Lord Chancellor. As the early Chancellors lacked formal legal training and showed little regard for precedent, their decisions were often widely diverse. In 1529, a lawyer, Sir Thomas More, was appointed as Chancellor, marking {{the beginning of a new}} era. After this time, all future Chancellors were lawyers. Beginning around 1557, records of proceedings in the Courts of Chancery were kept and several equitable doctrines developed. Criticisms continued, the most famous being 17th-century jurist John Selden's aphorism:Equity is a roguish thing: for law we have a measure, know what to trust to; equity is according to the conscience of him that is Chancellor, and as that is larger or narrower, so is equity. 'Tis all one as if they should make the standard for the measure we call a foot, a Chancellor's foot; what an uncertain measure would this be? One Chancellor has a long foot, another a short foot, a third an indifferent foot: 'tis <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> a Chancellor's conscience.|$|E
500|$|In Coleridge's own life, {{he tried}} to follow {{the path of the}} philosopher, but the 10 July 1834 entry in Table Talk admits that he was unable to do so: [...] "so I own I wish life and {{strength}} had been spared to me to complete my Philosophy. For, as God hears me, the originating, continuing, and sustaining wish and design in my heart were to exalt the glory of his name; and, which is <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> other words, to promote the improvement of humanity. But visum aliter Deo, and his will be done." ...|$|E

They are usually built with lumber, though it is {{possible}} to use metal poles for the construction as well. This is more expensive, more time-consuming and generally harder for the homeowner to deal with once constructed. These homes also {{have many of}} the common features associated with most homes, such as shingles and drywall.|$|R

500|$|The word ale {{comes from}} Old English ealu (plural ealoþ), in turn from Proto-Germanic *alu (plural *aluþ), {{ultimately}} from the Proto-Indo-European base *h₂elut-, which holds connotations of [...] "sorcery, magic, possession, intoxication". The word beer comes from Old English bēor, from Proto-Germanic *beuzą, probably from Proto-Indo-European *bʰeusóm, originally [...] "brewer's yeast, beer dregs", although other theories {{have been provided}} connecting the word with Old English bēow, [...] "barley", or Latin bibere, [...] "to drink". On the currency of two words for <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> the Germanic languages, the 12th-century Old Icelandic poem Alvíssmál says, [...] "Ale it is called among men, but among the gods, beer." ...|$|E
500|$|John's Gospel {{presents}} {{the teachings of}} Jesus not merely as his own preaching, but as divine revelation. John the Baptist, for example, states in : [...] "He whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for he gives the Spirit without measure." [...] In [...] Jesus says, [...] "My teaching is not mine but his who sent me." [...] He asserts <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> : [...] "Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? The words that I say to you I do not speak on my own; but the Father who dwells in me does his works." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{captain and}} first line centre for Team Canada, Crosby played with {{different}} line mates {{in almost every}} game as the coaching staff struggled to find players capable of keeping pace with the superstar centre at the 2010 Winter Olympic Games in Vancouver, British Columbia, and again at the 2014 Winter Olympic Games in Sochi, Russia. Crosby's fellow countryman and Olympic teammate, Rick Nash of the New York Rangers was questioned by the media about this, at one point saying, [...] "I think he's a tough guy to keep up with. He's so fast. The way he thinks about the game seems like it's far beyond everyone else's process.

It considers feature detection more reliable since <b>the</b> <b>same</b> rendering engine {{may not necessarily}} support <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>things</b> <b>in</b> two different browsers using that engine.

500|$|In side plots, Nina has {{recovered}} different translations of the tomes about the First People, including one from William Bell's personal safe, and realizes {{that they all}} say <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> different languages. She identifies {{the name of the}} author of each book as an anagram of the name [...] "Sam Weiss", the bowling alley owner who she had directed Olivia to after her initial return from the parallel universe. She approaches Sam, who does not deny he wrote the books, and who explains that the doomsday device being constructed can either create or destroy a universe; how that will work will depend on Peter, who is biologically tuned to the device. Sam posits that Peter will most likely save the universe from which the Olivia he loves originates. The episode ends with Olivia reading the note from Simon, which states that Peter still has feelings for Fauxlivia.|$|E
500|$|HMS Caradoc was a [...] light cruiser {{built for}} the Royal Navy during World War I. [...] She {{was one of the}} four ships of the Caledon sub-class. Assigned to the Grand Fleet during the war, the ship participated in the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight in late 1917. Caradoc was briefly {{deployed}} to the Baltic in late 1918 supporting anti-Bolshevik forces during the British campaign in the Baltic and then was transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet in early 1919 and spent the next year and a half doing <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> the Black Sea during the Russian Civil War. The ship was withdrawn from the Black Sea in mid-1920 to observe the Greco-Turkish War of 1919–22 and the Chanak Crisis of late 1922. Caradoc spent {{most of the rest of}} her time between the World Wars overseas or in reserve with deployments to the Far East and the North America and West Indies Station.|$|E
500|$|While he commended {{the album}} for its [...] "variable quality", Alexis Petridis for The Guardian felt the record {{would not be}} able to transcend its target market, a core {{audience}} aged approximately 8 to 12 and female: [...] "To anyone else, the mystery of One Direction's success – or at least the sheer scale of it – remains as opaque as ever." [...] The latter view was shared by Ben Rayner of the Toronto Star: [...] "Unless you’re in the target demographic or are, perhaps, a mom who lived through <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> her youth, there's no point in even going near this record, of course, but the rest of us were never meant to in the first place." [...] Writing for HitFix, Melinda Newman maintained that the album [...] "masterfully hits its target", and concluded as follows: [...] "I’m so far out of the One Dimension demographic, I practically need a GPS to find it." ...|$|E

500|$|During Russ' trial, Mercedes {{decided to}} go to the court to testify for him due to Nancy Hayton (Jessica Fox), who {{explained}} to Mercedes that her sister died because Justin Burton (Chris Fountain) was [...] "too gutless to come forward and tell the truth". This encouraged Mercedes to [...] "take a long, hard look at herself", and she realised that she was doing <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> the situation with Warren. On her way to the court however, Mercedes was [...] "all over the place". According to Metcalfe, everyone was shocked when Mercedes walked into the courtroom. She said that Mercedes was unsure of {{what she was going to}} tell the court, [...] "but her alibi is vital to Warren's case - his fate lies in her hands". Metcalfe said that even if Mercedes and Russ ended their relationship, which they did shortly after she confessed the truth, would not matter because she believed that it would not take Mercedes [...] "long before she goes back to her old ways" [...] because [...] "that's just the type of person she is - Mercedes likes playing the field and having fun, and no man's going to change her" ...|$|E
500|$|Stewie and Bertram, Stewie says [...] "On my signal, unleash hell." [...] This is a {{reference}} to the opening scene of Gladiator. An Ice Age reference is made when Scrat, a character from the films, attempts to steal Peter's nuts. When Stewie invades Bertram's camp {{at the end of the}} episode Bertram quotes , repeating the line Darth Vader says when he senses Obi-Wan Kenobi on the Death Star. [...] When Peter names his kids, Peter mentions the kids from various shows that are currently airing at Nick at Nite. [...] When Brian mentions this, Peter begins naming Street Fighter characters. [...] Brian again points out this fact, after which Peter names various colors. [...] Sauron, the villain from The Lord of the Rings is shown as the Eye of Sauron in a scene where he is trying to find his lost contact lens. [...] A cutaway scene features Peter in a jail surrounded by inmates who force him to strip, squeeze his boobs together, and sing the chorus from Kelis's 2003 hit “Milkshake.” This is possibly an homage to the scene after the credits in the movie [...] in which Ben Stiller does <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> his fatsuit.|$|E
