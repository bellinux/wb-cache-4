5|$|In 2005, after {{a series}} of {{articles}} in the Los Angeles Times about the spending practices of the Getty Trust and its then-president Dr. Barry Munitz, the California Attorney General conducted an investigation of the Getty Trust and found that no laws had been broken. The trust agreed to appoint an outside monitor to review future expenditures. The Getty Trust experienced financial difficulties in 2008 and 2009 and cut 205 of 1,487 budgeted staff positions <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>expenses.</b> Although the Getty Trust endowment reached $6.4 billion in 2007, it dropped to $4.5 billion in 2009. The endowment rebounded to $6.2 billion by 2013.|$|E
5|$|The bungee jump {{was filmed}} at the Contra Dam (also {{known as the}} Verzasca or Locarno Dam) in Ticino, Switzerland. The film's casino scenes and the Tiger helicopter's {{demonstration}} were shot in Monte Carlo. Reference footage for the tank chase was shot on location in St. Petersburg and matched to the studio at Leavesden. The climactic scenes on the satellite dish were shot at Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico. The actual MI6 headquarters were used for external views of M's office. Some of the scenes in St. Petersburg were actually shot in London – the Epsom Downs Racecourse doubled as the airport – <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>expenses</b> and security concerns, as the second unit sent to Russia required bodyguards.|$|E
25|$|While the Continental Army camped at Newburgh, New York in {{the winter}} of 17821783, the army's {{situation}} neared a crisis. With the war all but won, officers and soldiers realized that they needed to get Congress to give them their back-pay before the army was disbanded. Meanwhile, one faction in Congress wanted the army dissolved in order <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>expenses</b> and return power to the states. Another faction wanted to use the army as a lever to push through higher taxes and a stronger central government. Washington was sympathetic with his officers but was afraid of the consequences of a large-scale mutiny. He notified Congress that he would do all that he could to stop the army from rebelling.|$|E

25|$|Greece has {{universal}} health care. In a 2000 World Health Organization report, its {{health care system}} ranked 14th in overall performance of 191 countries surveyed. In a 2013 Save the Children report, Greece was ranked the 19th best country (out of 176 countries surveyed) {{for the state of}} mothers and newborn babies. In 2010, there were 138 hospitals with 31,000 beds in the country, but on 1 July 2011, the Ministry for Health and Social Solidarity announced its plans to decrease the number to 77 hospitals with 36,035 beds, as a necessary reform <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>expenses</b> and further enhance healthcare standards. Greece's healthcare expenditures as a percentage of GDP were 9.6% in 2007 according to a 2011 OECD report, just above the OECD average of 9.5%. The country has the largest number of doctors-to-population ratio of any OECD country.|$|E
25|$|Worsening working conditions, mass {{layoffs and}} poor payroll {{have taken to}} the streets {{thousands}} of employees even {{in the early days}} of 2013. Probably the most dramatic and publicized case is Oltchim Râmnicu Vâlcea, one of the largest chemical companies in Romania. The company recorded losses of €90.3million in the fourth quarter of 2011, thus ending the year with a negative result of 270 million lei. The company's leadership was forced <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>expenses</b> and liabilities, even without announcing employees. The deplorable situation of the company triggered mass unrest, also fueled by several failed attempts to privatize the plant. Protests took place throughout the year, one of the largest being organized on 28 March, when nearly 1,500 employees refused to start work and blocked the traffic on national road DN64. The unrest escalated with the storming of company's headquarters on 4 July, while in the subsequent months, some employees launched a hunger strike.|$|E

Barkley had closed his law {{practice}} {{when he was}} elected to the Senate, so to pay for his wife's care, he supplemented his $10,000 annual salary with speaking engagements. He was the Democratic Speakers Bureau's most requested orator, surpassing Truman. A Pageant magazine poll of legislators chose Barkley and Republican Robert A.

The Barkleys sold their Washington, D.C. home and moved into an apartment <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>expenses.</b> Marny Clifford, wife of Truman's Naval Advisor Clark Clifford, nicknamed Barkley [...] "Sparkle Barkle" [...] for his care of his wife, who died March 10, 1947.

Workers were forced to use English manuals, even though only a few had a grasp of the language.|$|E
2500|$|The famine {{occurred}} {{at a time when}} the colonial government was attempting <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>expenses</b> on welfare. Earlier, in the Bihar famine of 187374, severe mortality had been avoided by importing rice from Burma. However, the Government of Bengal and its Lieutenant-Governor, Sir Richard Temple, were criticized for excessive expenditure on charitable relief. Sensitive to any renewed accusations of excess in 1876, Temple, who was now Famine Commissioner for the Government of India, insisted not only on a policy of laissez faire with respect to the trade in grain, but also on stricter standards of qualification for relief and on more meager relief rations. Two kinds of relief were offered: [...] "relief works" [...] for able-bodied men, women, and working children, and gratuitous (or charitable) relief for small children, the elderly, and the indigent.|$|E

2500|$|The {{government}} {{as well as}} different NGOs have been making efforts to increase public awareness of water scarcity and to encourage water conservation. One example is the Water Wise Women Initiative carried out since 2007 in initially five local communities throughout Jordan. The initiative builds on the efforts of volunteers organized in 50 community development centers by supported by the Jordanian Hashemite Fund for Human Development (JOHUD). It trains female volunteers called [...] "change pioneers" [...] in topics such as water saving, rainwater harvesting, water storage, plumbing, hygiene and water use for house gardening. It thus provides opportunities for women to generate income and <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>expenses</b> for bottled water, water bought from trucks and hired plumbers.

2500|$|The Late-2000s {{recession}} had {{an extreme}} {{impact on the}} sport marine industry. Job losses and cutbacks affected discretionary recreational spending more than most market segments. New boat sales were nil, so manufacturers cut their sponsorships. Some fisherman were forced {{to give up their}} boat ownership or team up with friends to save expenses. The tournament had not covered [...] expenses since 2004 and had spent $200,000 of their reserve fund to compensate, so in 2009 the board of directors made drastic changes to daily activities to ensure the future of the event. Two paid positions, an executive director and assistant were both eliminated to save over $90K per year. Bob Gipson, one of the tournament founders, resigned from the board of directors and assumed the executive director position at no salary. He then examined virtually every facet of the operation <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>expenses.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Hatikvah International Academy Charter School, a Hebrew {{language}} {{charter school}} that offers an International Baccalaureate program opened in September 2010 for grades K-7, {{with plans to}} add a new grade each year until an eighth grade is offered. A lottery is held each year, with separate draws for residents of East Brunswick Township and non-residents, to allocate {{the limited number of}} positions available for each class. The school plans to build a permanent structure as part of the Campus for Jewish Life (formerly known as the YM-YWHA of Raritan Valley) to replace its current facility the school has rented located near Trinity Presbyterian Church. Concerns have been raised regarding the funding for the school, which will come from the East Brunswick Board of Education budget, including $1.34 million for the 2010-11 school year, and that the district will not be able <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>expenses</b> by the amount that will be paid to the charter school. Hatikvah school officials emphasize that charter schools can often educate students at a lower cost than traditional public schools and that [...] "taxpayers do not pay an extra penny for having a charter school in town, period". The school received $75,000 in grants from foundations to cover the costs of applying for a charter and for getting the school operational. Hatikvah budgeted $11,033 per student for the 2010-11 school year, while the East Brunswick Public Schools budgeted $12,782 per pupil for that same year.|$|E
