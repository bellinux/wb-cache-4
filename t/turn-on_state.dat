40|$|Abstract. A {{performance}} degradation assessment method is proposed based on probability statistic of common <b>turn-on</b> <b>state</b> of power MOSFET circuit in this paper. Threshold shift transient characteristics of MOSFET are studied and the {{performance degradation}} behavior of a bridge power MOSFET circuit is simulated. Threshold voltage degradation of a power MOSFET circuit caused by half bridge arm is observed and {{the probability of a}} period transient common <b>turn-on</b> <b>state</b> is calculated to evaluate the degree. The result can be used to evaluate the performance degradation trend and can also provide data support for predicting the degradation degree before circuit failed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: IGBT (insulated gate bipolar transistor) {{has been}} widely used around the power {{industry}} as it has good switching performance and its excellent conductance. In order to reduce power loss during switch <b>turn-on</b> <b>state,</b> {{it is essential to}} reduce its resistance. However, trade off relationship between breakdown voltage and device conductance is the greatest obstacle on the way of improvement. Floating island structure is one of the solutions. Still, under optimized device condition for the best performance, improvement rate is negligible. Therefore, this paper suggests adding trench gate on floating island structure to eliminate JFET (junction field effect transistor) area to reduce resistance and activate floating island effect. Experimental result by 2 D simulation using TCAD, shows 20 % improvement of <b>turn-on</b> <b>state</b> voltage drop...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper aims to the {{research}} of high voltage lateral {{insulated gate bipolar transistor}} (LIGBT) and proposes the design for reducing the substrate leakage current of this device. The junction between LIGBT’s p-type substrate and n-epi layer may have a large electrical field and causes the hole current to flow during the <b>turn-on</b> <b>state.</b> To prevent this substrate leakage current, an n-type buried layer (NBL) and a p-type buried layer (PBL) are used. The double reverse biased pn-junction structure effectively reduces the vertical electric field such that the substrate current is reduced by four orders of magnitude. The break down voltage of the LIGBT is not hurt by this added structure at all...|$|E
40|$|A {{zinc oxide}} (ZnO) {{nanoparticle}} photodetector was fabricated using a simple method. Under a 5 [*]V applied bias, its dark current and photocurrent were 1. 98 × 10 - 8 and 9. 42 × 10 - 7 [*]A, respectively. In other words, a photocurrent-to-dark-current contrast ratio of 48 was obtained. Under incident light at a wavelength of 375 [*]nm and a 5 [*]V applied bias, the detector’s measured responsivity was 3. 75 [*]A/W. The transient time constants measured during the <b>turn-ON</b> and turn-OFF <b>states</b> were τON= 204 [*]s and τOFF= 486 [*]s, respectively...|$|R
30|$|The boost {{converter}} is wildly used for voltage step-up. However, its duty cycle {{would be too}} large when the input voltage is {{much smaller than the}} output. And for the actual power switch and diode, a certain delay between <b>turn-on</b> and turn-off <b>state</b> will probably result that the power switch is turned on before being cut off completely and the diode is cut off before conducting. Thus, the reliability is degraded. When the duty cycle approaches unity, a large pulse current will conduct through the diode in a short time, which leads to large the current stress of the diode and severe reverse recovery problem. This will greatly affect the efficiency and brings about a serious electromagnetic interference problem [9, 10, 11, 12]. By cascading another {{boost converter}}, a high voltage gain can be easily obtained. But the additional switch makes the control scheme more complex. And it may cause instability issue for cascaded systems.|$|R
40|$|Her X- 1 {{has been}} {{monitored}} nearly continuously in soft X-rays (2 - 12 keV) since February 1996 by the ASM on board RXTE. We present {{analysis of these}} observations which include 23 contiguous 35 -day cycles. We present the best yet average 35 -day cycle lightcurve for Her X- 1. 35 -day lightcurve features such as eclipses and absorption dips, and the alternating occurrence of the Main High and Short High states, are well measured. The occurrence of X-ray eclipse during the Low state is confirmed as {{is the presence of}} Main High states that ``turn-on'' sharply at orbital phases 0. 23 and 0. 68. The Main High state covers 35 -day phase 0 - 0. 31 and the Short High state covers phase 0. 57 - 0. 79, with phase 0 defined by Main High <b>state</b> <b>turn-on.</b> We find extended ingresses and egresses for the Short High state. Marching pre-eclipse absorption dips progressively become shallower during the Main High state. The marching pre-eclipse dip period is best determined from reanalysis of archival data as 1. 651 +/-. 002 days if the dip marching can be extrapolated from the Main High state into the Short High state or 1. 646 +/-. 003 using dips within single Main High states alone.

40|$|International audienceA novel {{method to}} {{stabilize}} the correlated color temperature in pcW-LEDs from their initial <b>turn-on</b> <b>state</b> to thermal equilibrium is proposed and demonstrated. Under the normal operation condition, it can stabilize the CCT of a pcW-LED by the positive matching of the blue LED peak wavelength to the phosphor excitation spectrum. When the operating temperature unavoidably becomes higher in the LED die quickly after the initial turn-on, the phosphor conversion efficiency degrades and the LED blue light performs red shift. With the positive matching, the red shift actually helps enhance the excitation efficiency of the phosphor to compensate the thermal quenching and efficiency degradation. Therefore, {{the ratio of the}} blue light to the yellow light can keep almost constant, as well as the CCTs. In the experiments, the CCT variation could be as small as from 7 K to 83 K in different cases. Finally, we introduce a new factor, the so-called guide number, which is used to count the total change of the enhancement in equivalent excitation efficiency and the relative reduction of the phosphor light emission. The guide number essentially helps in designing the matching blue LED die and phosphor pair for good CCT stabilization...|$|E
40|$|International audienceLooking {{back to the}} {{development}} of inverters using SiC switches, it appears that SiC devices do not behave like their silicon counterparts. Their ability to operate at high temperature makes them attractive. Developing drivers suitable for 200 °C operation is not straightforward. In a perspective of high integration and large power density, it is wise to consider a monolithic integration of the driver parts for the sake of reliability. Silicon is not suitable for high ambient temperature; silicon-oninsulator offers better performances and presents industrial perspectives. The paper focuses on a SiC BJT driver: it processes logical orders from outside, drives adequately the BJT to turn it either on or off, monitors the turn-off and <b>turn-on</b> <b>state</b> of the device, and acts accordingly to prevent failure. SiC BJT imposes specific performances different from the well known ones of SiC JFET or MOSFET. The paper addresses a preliminary analysis of a SOI driver, anticipating the behavior of SiC-BJT and the change in behavior at high temperature. A discret driver has been designed and fabricated. Elementary functional blocks have been validated, and a BJT converter successfully operated at high temperature with high efficiency (= 88 %...|$|E
