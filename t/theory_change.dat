40|$|In the January meeting we {{will ask}} Critical Advisors to propose new or adapted <b>theories</b> of <b>change</b> that can {{accomplish}} our shared vision for higher education. It will be useful, therefore, to review some of the <b>theories</b> of <b>change</b> {{that have already been}} used in efforts to improve quality and access in STEM education and to consider why some STEM reform efforts based on particular <b>theories</b> of <b>change</b> (whether implicit or stated) may be more or less successful than others. To this end, the principal {{purpose of this paper is}} to argue that <b>theories</b> of <b>change</b> are powerful yet often unacknowledged guides for human action for change. We first explain what a <b>theory</b> of <b>change</b> is; then we present our findings from a modest preliminary study of <b>theories</b> of <b>change</b> in a small sample of projects that the National Science Foundation solicited and subsequently funded to improve STEM education.

5000|$|Starting in 1983, Salmon became {{interested}} in theory choice in science, and sought to resolve the enduring conflict between the logical empiricist view, whereby theories undergo a logical process of confirmation and comparison, as against the Kuhnian historical perspective, whereby theory choice and comparison are troubled by incommensurability, the inability of scientists to even effectively communicate and compare theories across differing paradigms. [...] Recognizing that Kuhn's 1962 thesis in Structure of Scientific Revolutions was largely misunderstood—that Kuhn had not meant that scientific <b>theory</b> <b>change</b> is irrational but merely relative to the scientific community where the change occurs—Salmon believed that Bayesianism, which quantifies decisionmaking via subjective probability or [...] "degree of belief", could help close the seemingly unbridgeable gap between the logical empiricist view versus the Kuhnian historical view of theory choice and change.|$|E
5000|$|The {{philosophical}} {{concept of}} (scientific) structuralism {{is related to}} that of epistemic structural realism (ESR). ESR, a position originally and independently held by Henri Poincaré (1902), Bertrand Russell (1927), and Rudolf Carnap (1928), was resurrected by John Worrall, who proposes that there is retention of structure across <b>theory</b> <b>change.</b> Worrall, for example, argued that Fresnel's equations imply that light has a structure and that Maxwell's equations, which replaced Fresnel's, do also; both characterize light as vibrations. Fresnel postulated that the vibrations were in a mechanical medium called [...] "ether"; Maxwell postulated that the vibrations were of electric and magnetic fields. The structure in both cases is the vibrations and it was retained when Maxwell's theories replaced Fresnel's. [...] Because structure is retained, structural realism both (a) avoids 'pessimistic meta-induction' and (b) {{does not make the}} success of science seem miraculous.|$|E

50|$|The use of <b>Theory</b> of <b>Change</b> in {{planning}} and evaluation has increased exponentially among philanthropies, government agencies, international NGOs, the UN, and many other major organizations in both developed and developing countries. This has led to new areas of work, such as linking the <b>Theory</b> of <b>Change</b> approach to systems thinking and complexity. Change processes are no longer seen as linear, but as having many feedback loops {{that need to be}} understood. Consequently, <b>Theory</b> of <b>Change</b> is strengthening monitoring, evaluation and learning. They are also helping to understand and assess impact in hard to measure areas, such as governance, capacity strengthening and institutional development. Innovations continue to emerge.Despite the growing ubiquity of <b>Theory</b> of <b>Change,</b> however, especially in the development arena, understanding of the approach and the methods necessary to implement it effectively are not uniform. In fact, there is evidence of some confusion about what the term ‘theory of change’ actually means; in some cases, what some program developers describe as a <b>Theory</b> of <b>Change</b> is, in essence, simply log frame, strategic plan or another approach that does not encompass the complexity of the <b>theory</b> of <b>change</b> approach.|$|R

5000|$|Furthermore, Darden {{attempts}} to illumine the [...] "mysterious" [...] process of constructing scientific theories by positing various [...] "strategies" [...] that she claims are sufficient for solving actual historical cases of <b>theory</b> <b>change.</b> For example, Darden examines the Mendelian [...] "Theory of the Gene," [...] which underwent significant theoretical modifications from around 1900 (when Mendel was [...] "rediscovered") to 1926 (when Thomas Hunt Morgan published his famous textbook defining Mendelian theory in its roughly modern form). Looking at these cases, Darden describes procedures for devising the hypotheses that early twentieth-century Mendelian theorists actually proposed, although {{she does not}} claim that these theorists actually employed such procedures, or strategies. Ultimately, by constructing a list of such strategies for discovery, Darden hopes that scientists can use them to solve present theoretical problems that contemporary science encounters. As such, she advises scientists to use them, calling her model [...] "advisory" [...] (rather than [...] "descriptive" [...] or [...] "normative").|$|E
5000|$|One {{origin of}} the unified {{discipline}} is the historical approach to the discipline of the philosophy of science. This hybrid approach {{is reflected in the}} career of Thomas Kuhn. His first permanent appointment, at the University of California, Berkeley, was to a position advertised by the philosophy department, but he also taught courses from the history department. When he was promoted to full professor in the history department only, Kuhn was offended at the philosophers' rejection because [...] "I sure as hell wanted to be there, and it was my philosophy students who were working with me, not on philosophy but on history, were nevertheless my more important students". This attitude is also reflected in his historicist approach, as outlined in Kuhn's seminal Structure of Scientific Revolutions (1962, 2nd ed. 1970), wherein philosophical questions about scientific theories and, especially, <b>theory</b> <b>change</b> are understood in historical terms, employing concepts such as paradigm shift.|$|E
5000|$|Among {{the most}} {{influential}} challengers of this approach was Thomas Kuhn, who argued instead that experimental data always provide some data which cannot fit completely into a theory, and that falsification alone {{did not result in}} scientific change or an undermining of scientific consensus. He proposed that scientific consensus worked in the form of [...] "paradigms", which were interconnected theories and underlying assumptions {{about the nature of the}} theory itself which connected various researchers in a given field. Kuhn argued that only after the accumulation of many [...] "significant" [...] anomalies would scientific consensus enter a period of [...] "crisis". At this point, new theories would be sought out, and eventually one paradigm would triumph over the old one - a cycle of paradigm shifts rather than a linear progression towards truth. Kuhn's model also emphasized more clearly the social and personal aspects of <b>theory</b> <b>change,</b> demonstrating through historical examples that scientific consensus was never truly a matter of pure logic or pure facts. However, these periods of 'normal' and 'crisis' science are not mutually exclusive. Research shows that these are different modes of practice, more than different historical periods.|$|E

First, I present a taxonomy of seven responses to anomalous data: (a) ignoring the data, (b) rejecting the data, (c) excluding the data from the domain of the current theory, (d) holding the data in abeyance, (e) reinterpreting the data, (f) peripheral <b>theory</b> <b>change,</b> and (g) <b>theory</b> <b>change.</b> Second, I present an analysis of nine factors that are hypothesized to influence which of these seven responses an individual will choose.
