5|$|Even though Eris can be up {{to three}} times farther from the Sun than Pluto, it {{approaches}} close enough {{that some of the}} ices on the surface might warm enough <b>to</b> <b>sublime.</b> Because methane is highly volatile, its presence shows either that Eris has always resided in the distant reaches of the Solar System, where it is cold enough for methane ice to persist, or that the celestial body has an internal source of methane to replenish gas that escapes from its atmosphere. This contrasts with observations of another discovered TNO, , which reveal the presence of water ice but not methane.|$|E
5|$|Europa is the smoothest known {{object in}} the Solar System, lacking {{large-scale}} features such as mountains and craters. However; according to one theory, Europa's equator may be covered in icy spikes called penitentes, which may be up to ten meters high, due to direct overhead sunlight on the equator, causing the ice <b>to</b> <b>sublime</b> forming vertical cracks. The prominent markings crisscrossing Europa appear to mainly be albedo features that emphasize low topography. There are few craters on Europa, because its surface is tectonically too active and therefore young. Europa's icy crust has an albedo (light reflectivity) of 0.64, {{one of the highest}} of all moons. This indicates a young and active surface, based on estimates of the frequency of cometary bombardment that Europa likely experiences, the surface is about 20 to 180 million years old. There is currently no full scientific consensus among the sometimes contradictory explanations for the surface features of Europa.|$|E

5|$|The Giotto and Vega {{missions}} gave {{planetary scientists}} their first view of Halley's surface and structure. Like all comets, as Halley nears the Sun, its volatile compounds (those with low boiling points, such as water, carbon monoxide, {{carbon dioxide and}} other ices) begin <b>to</b> <b>sublime</b> from the surface of its nucleus. This causes the comet to develop a coma, or atmosphere, up to 100,000km across. Evaporation of this dirty ice releases dust particles, which travel with the gas away from the nucleus. Gas molecules in the coma absorb solar light and then re-radiate it at different wavelengths, a phenomenon known as fluorescence, whereas dust particles scatter the solar light. Both processes are responsible for making the coma visible. As a fraction of the gas molecules in the coma are ionized by the solar ultraviolet radiation, pressure from the solar wind, a stream of charged particles emitted by the Sun, pulls the coma's ions out into a long tail, which may extend more than 100millionkilometers into space. Changes in the flow of the solar wind can cause disconnection events, in which the tail completely breaks off from the nucleus.|$|E
25|$|Similar to the {{previous}} technique, the TIPS phase separation procedure {{requires the use of}} a solvent with a low melting point that is easy <b>to</b> <b>sublime.</b> For example, dioxane could be used to dissolve polylactic acid, then phase separation is induced through the addition of a small quantity of water: a polymer-rich and a polymer-poor phase are formed. Following cooling below the solvent melting point and some days of vacuum-drying <b>to</b> <b>sublime</b> the solvent, a porous scaffold is obtained. Liquid-liquid phase separation presents the same drawbacks of emulsification/freeze-drying.|$|E

25|$|The {{phase diagram}} {{explains}} why liquids {{do not exist}} in space or any other vacuum. Since the pressure is zero (except on surfaces or interiors of planets and moons) water and other liquids exposed to space will either immediately boil or freeze depending on the temperature. In regions of space near the earth, water will freeze if the sun is not shining directly on it and vapourize (sublime) {{as soon as it}} is in sunlight. If water exists as ice on the moon, it can only exist in shadowed holes where the sun never shines and where the surrounding rock doesn't heat it up too much. At some point near the orbit of Saturn, the light from the sun is too faint <b>to</b> <b>sublime</b> ice to water vapour. This is evident from the longevity of the ice that composes Saturn's rings.|$|E
25|$|There are {{indications}} that Ceres may have a tenuous atmosphere and water frost on the surface. Surface water ice is unstable at distances less than 5 AU from the Sun, so it is expected <b>to</b> <b>sublime</b> if it is exposed directly to solar radiation. Water ice can migrate from the deep layers of Ceres to the surface, but escapes {{in a very short}} time. As a result, it is difficult to detect water vaporization. Water escaping from polar regions of Ceres was possibly observed in the early 1990s but this has not been unambiguously demonstrated. It may be possible to detect escaping water from the surroundings of a fresh impact crater or from cracks in the subsurface layers of Ceres. Ultraviolet observations by the IUE spacecraft detected statistically significant amounts of hydroxide ions near the Cererean north pole, which is a product of water-vapor dissociation by ultraviolet solar radiation.|$|E
