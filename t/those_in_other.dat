40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to conduct amino acid profiling of two Japanese indigenous hens (Tosa-jidori; TJI and Ukokkei; UKO) and compared with a commercial hen (JL). Asparagine, leucine and proline levels in commercial layers were higher than <b>those</b> <b>in</b> both native Japanese chickens. Lysine and glutamate in UKO were higher than <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>others</b> and taurine was also higher than in JL. Serine in UKO was lower than <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>others</b> and methionine and cysteine were also lower than in JL. Arginine in TJI was lower than <b>those</b> <b>in</b> JL and UKO. No significant differences between breed/line were observed in histidine, threonine, glutamine, glycine, alanine, valine, isoleucine, tyrosine, phenylalanine and tryptophan. These results suggest that levels of dietary amino acid requirements might be different between native Japanese chickens...|$|R

Subjects were tasked with memorizing symbols in certain visual fields while ignoring <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>others.</b> <b>In</b> some subjects, the lingual gyrus was activated. The hemispheric activation of the structure was dependent on which visual field the subject was focused on. Hemispheric dependent gyrus activation has also been shown by isolating visual fields rather than by diverting focus.|$|R

5|$|Bulgaria has a {{universal}} healthcare system financed by taxes and contributions. The National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) pays a gradually increasing {{portion of the}} costs of primary healthcare. Projected healthcare expenditures for 2013 amount to 4.1 percent of GDP. The number of doctors is above the EU average with 181 physicians per 100,000 people, but distribution by fields of practice is uneven, there is a severe shortage of nurses and other medical personnel, and the quality of most medical facilities is poor. Personnel shortages in some fields are so severe that patients resort to seeking treatment in neighboring countries. Bulgaria ranks 121st globally by average life expectancy, which stands at 74.5 years for both genders. The primary causes of death are similar to <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>other</b> industrialised countries, mainly cardiovascular diseases, neoplasms and respiratory diseases.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, Australian {{researcher}} Jean Williams {{claimed that}} cancer {{rates in the}} town of Innisfail, Queensland were 10 times higher than the state average due to secret testing of Agent Orange by the Australian military scientists during the Vietnam War. Williams, who had won the Order of Australia medal for her research on the effects of chemicals on U.S. war veterans, based her allegations on Australian government reports found in the Australian War Memorial's archives. A former soldier, Ted Bosworth, backed up the claims, saying that he had been involved in the secret testing. Neither Williams or Bosworth have produced verifiable evidence to support their claims. The Queensland health department determined that cancer rates in Innisfail were no higher than <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>other</b> parts of the state.|$|E

Traditional Swiss cuisine uses ingredients similar to <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>other</b> European countries, as well as unique dairy products and cheeses such as Gruyère or Emmental, produced in the valleys of Gruyères and Emmental. The number of fine-dining establishments is high, particularly in western Switzerland.|$|E
5|$|The {{sinking of}} the {{hospital}} ship AHSCentaur on 14May1943 with heavy loss of life led the Advisory War Council to seek information from the RAN and RAAF on the actions being taken to protect shipping. While the RAN acknowledged that the Bathurst-class corvettes that made up most of its escort force were too slow, it argued that the losses suffered by escorted convoys were no worse than <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>other</b> parts of the world. Despite the Navy's assurances, Australia's anti-submarine forces were constrained by a shortage of training opportunities and poor coordination between the RAN, RAAF and the United States Navy. The Australian military had also not kept pace with improvements to British and United States ASW doctrine by fully implementing the tactics that had proven most successful in other theatres of the war.|$|E

5|$|In May 2012, Böcker {{announced}} that he was working on a concert of music solely from the Final Fantasy series, to be titled Final Symphony. The idea for the concert was first proposed by Uematsu in 2009 after Symphonic Fantasies; the concert had featured Final Fantasy music as one of its four components, but unlike the other three the music had been a straightforward medley rather than a more complicated arrangement. While Uematsu had asked the team to keep the arrangements similar to <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>other</b> Final Fantasy concerts, after the concert he felt that an opportunity had been missed to create something unique like the other three arrangements, especially the Secret of Mana section. He encouraged Böcker to take more liberties with the source material if the opportunity arose, and hoped that another concert could be created in the future. Böcker proposed Final Symphony later that year to Uematsu, and got approval from Square Enix while coordinating a Tokyo concert of Symphonic Fantasies. Final Symphony is the first concert consisting entirely of new Final Fantasy arrangements in over ten years, since 20020220 - Music from Final Fantasy.|$|E
5|$|Major {{declines in}} populations have been {{observed}} from 1980 onward in Sweden, Finland, northern Russia (Karelia) and the Baltic States, and smaller declines {{in much of the}} rest of northern and central Europe. The bird has been adversely affected in these areas by intensive agriculture, and in several countries it has been red-listed due to population declines of more than 50%. Numbers dwindled in the United Kingdom by more than 80% between 1966 and 2004; although populations in some areas such as Northern Ireland were stable or even increased, <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>other</b> areas, mainly England, declined even more sharply. The overall decline seems to be due to the low survival rate of young birds, which may be caused by changes in agricultural practices. The intensive farming methods used in northern Europe mean there is less pasture and meadow habitat available, and the supply of grassland invertebrates needed for the nestlings to thrive is correspondingly reduced.|$|E
5|$|The design {{report for}} the Bay Freeway project was {{published}} on February 10, 1970, and was subsequently distributed to the project. The report featured a new design for the freeway, including ramps to a parking garage serving the domed stadium and aesthetic standards meant to complement the existing Seattle Center. Five additional public hearings were held by the Seattle City Council in 1970, as support for the R.H. Thomson Expressway and other proposed freeways were the subject of highway revolts similar to <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>other</b> American cities. During the April hearing, former State Department of Highways director Charles Prahl spoke out against the Bay Freeway and predicted that it would cause traffic to back up onto I-5 during rush hour. Voters rejected a Forward Thrust initiative that would have built the proposed domed stadium at the Seattle Center on May 19, removing {{one of the main}} reasons to build the freeway and forcing the city council to consider scaling down the proposal. The June hearing resulted in the removal of the R.H. Thomson Freeway from the comprehensive plan as well as the widening of the Bay Freeway to six lanes to support an expected 2,610 drivers during rush hour.|$|E

5|$|The nasals make {{up most of}} the crest. Brown {{assumed that}} they {{extended}} from the beaks' tip to the highest spot along the crest and that, unlike <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>other</b> genera, the nasals meet in the centre and are not separated in front by an ascending premaxillary process. Brown however, mistook the praemaxillae for the nasals; the snout is actually largely formed by them and they do separate the nasals. Brown also thought that on the top and back of the crest, the whole external face is covered by the frontals. Again he made a mistake: what he assumed to be the frontals are in fact the nasals. The nasals end {{at the back of the}} squamosals in a hooked, short process. The prefrontals also make up part of the crest; however, Brown mistook the lower upper branch of the praemaxilla for the prefrontal. The actual prefrontal, triangular in shape, is located at the side of the crest base; it was by Brown seen as a part of the frontal. The real frontals, largely internal to the crest base structure, are not visible from the side.|$|E
