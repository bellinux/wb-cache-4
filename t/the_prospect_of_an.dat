5|$|On 13 March, the New Zealand Division {{moved to}} Syria to build fortifications in the Beqaa Valley, {{to protect against}} <b>the</b> <b>prospect</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Axis attack from Turkey. The {{regiment}} had to build roads at Laboue and Wadi Fa'rah, camping at Djedeida. In mid-May the road-building was finished and the regiment prepared for manoeuvres with the 4th and 6th New Zealand Infantry Brigades. On 21 May, the regiment moved into the desert for the manoeuvres. When the exercises were completed on 1 June, it returned to Djedeida for more training.|$|E
5|$|While Britain {{may have}} been militarily secure in 1940, both sides {{were aware of the}} {{possibility}} of a political collapse. If the Germans had won the Battle of Britain, the Luftwaffe {{would have been able to}} strike anywhere in southern England and with <b>the</b> <b>prospect</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> invasion, the British government would have come under pressure to come to terms: the extensive anti-invasion preparations demonstrated to Germany and to the people of Britain that whatever happened in the air, the United Kingdom was both able and willing to defend itself.|$|E
5|$|Hamdanid {{relations}} with Byzantium collapsed completely in 985–986, after the Fatimids took the Byzantine fortress of Balanyas. Sa'd al-Dawla refused to continue paying tribute. As a result, the Byzantines under Bardas Phokas invaded his territory and sacked Killis before retracing their steps and marching south to an unsuccessful siege of Apamea. In retaliation, Sa'd al-Dawla sent his troops to raze the famous monastery of Qal'at Sim'an. However, soon after that, in May 986, <b>the</b> <b>prospect</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> imminent {{conclusion of a}} peace between Byzantium and Egypt forced Sa'd al-Dawla {{to return to his}} earlier allegiance, and he re-affirmed his tributary status on the same terms as before. This did not prevent Sa'd al-Dawla from supporting the Byzantine general Bardas Skleros in his second rebellion against Basil II, once he was released from Buyid captivity in December 986, nor of recognizing Fatimid suzerainty in the same month, especially as Byzantium now descended into a civil war that lasted until 989.|$|E

5|$|Kenney {{read this}} Ultra {{intelligence}} {{in the office of}} the Supreme Allied Commander, South West Pacific Area – General Douglas MacArthur – on 25 February. <b>The</b> <b>prospect</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> additional 6,900 Japanese troops in the Lae area greatly disturbed MacArthur, as they might seriously affect his plans to capture and develop the area. Kenney wrote out orders, which were sent by courier, for Brigadier General Ennis Whitehead, the deputy commander of the Fifth Air Force, and the commander of its Advance Echelon (ADVON) in New Guinea. Under the Fifth Air Force’s unusual command arrangements, Whitehead controlled the Allied Air Forces units of all types in New Guinea. This included the RAAF units there, which were grouped as No. 9 Operational Group RAAF, under the command of Air Commodore Joe Hewitt.|$|E

25|$|Along {{with the}} desire for independence, {{tensions}} between Hindus and Muslims had also been developing over the years. The Muslims {{had always been a}} minority within the subcontinent, and <b>the</b> <b>prospect</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> exclusively Hindu government made them wary of independence; they were as inclined to mistrust Hindu rule as they were to resist the foreign Raj, although Gandhi called for unity between the two groups in an astonishing display of leadership.|$|E

25|$|For {{several weeks}} the Spanish siege guns pounded the {{fortress}} until a breach {{was made in}} the main wall. By this time, 42 of the 50 French artillery pieces were dismounted. Facing <b>the</b> <b>prospect</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> assault with his defenses compromised, Boisbrulé formally surrendered Bellegarde on 24 June. The remaining soldiers of the garrison marched into captivity. During the month-long siege, the French suffered losses of 30 killed, 56 wounded, and 1,450 captured. Spanish losses are not known.|$|E
25|$|Parliament was {{dissolved}} {{and house}} elections scheduled for 24 July 1988, with Prem again not standing for election. As in 1986, the election resulted in no single party winning enough seats to govern without a coalition. Thousands protested {{in front of}} Prem's house against <b>the</b> <b>prospect</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> unelected premier, until Prem finally {{announced that he would}} not accept the premiership. The Chart Thai party, led by General Chatichai Choonhavan, won the most seats in the election, and Chatichai became the new premier.|$|E

25|$|The World Cup {{was also}} criticised by the BCCI for its format because India failed {{to move on}} from the group stage after losing two of their three matches.

The {{elimination}} of both India and Pakistan also caused a large exodus of subcontinental fans from the Caribbean, and removed <b>the</b> <b>prospect</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> India vs Pakistan Super Eights match, generally {{considered one of the most}} revenue generating and electric matches in the tournament.|$|E

The band's first and only studio album, The Devil You Know, was released on 28 April 2009.|$|E
25|$|Concerns over <b>the</b> <b>prospect</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> attack soon dissipated. Air patrols {{conducted}} in improving weather conditions on 11 March did not locate any Japanese warships, and most units other than Fremantle Fortress' anti-aircraft and coast defence positions were stood down on 12 March. The units normally stationed in Western Australia {{returned to their}} usual locations and activities on 13 March, and the submarine tenders were escorted back to Fremantle by Adelaide. On 20 March Kenney advised Bostock {{that the threat of}} attack had passed, and ordered that all of the additional RAAF units sent to Western Australia be returned to their bases.|$|E

25|$|FitzGerald was {{the heir}} to the earldom of Desmond, but in 1585 his late father's estate was attainted by the Irish {{parliament}} and all its property confiscated by the crown. Most of the hereditary lands in the province of Munster then underwent a radical plantation by English settlers (see Plantation of Munster), but such was the loyalty attached to the FitzGerald name there that the government had good cause to fear a future rebellion. These events occurred during the Anglo-Spanish War (1585–1604), and English fear was increased with <b>the</b> <b>prospect</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> intervention by the Spanish, who had an historical affinity with the west coast of Ireland.|$|E
25|$|The {{draw for}} the quarter-finals, semi-finals and final of the Champions League {{was held on}} 14 March 2008. Despite English teams making up half of the numbers in the draw, United were drawn with A.S. Roma. This tie will see the fifth and sixth times that the Red Devils have played against their Italian rivals in the last 12 months; the {{previous}} four matches resulted in two wins, a draw and a loss, including United's Champions League record 7–1 win in the 2006–07 quarter-final. The winner of this quarter-final would meet either Schalke or Barcelona in the semi-finals, before facing Arsenal, Liverpool, Fenerbahçe or Chelsea in the final, setting up <b>the</b> <b>prospect</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> all-English final.|$|E
