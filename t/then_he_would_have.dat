5|$|In October 1956, Sunderland manager Bill Murray bought Revie for a £22,000 fee. Poor results {{left the}} Black Cats facing relegation {{towards the end}} of the 1956–57 campaign, but a late seven-game unbeaten run lifted them to safety, just one place above relegated Cardiff City. A {{financial}} scandal over illegal payments to players resulted in harsh sanctions at Roker Park from The Football Association and forced Murray's resignation. His replacement, Alan Brown, preferred a more physical style of play that did not suit Revie. Sunderland suffered relegation from the First Division for the first time in the club's history in the 1957–58 season, and Revie was dropped for the 1958–59 Second Division campaign in favour of a youth policy. In September 1958, he rejected the opportunity to sign for hometown club Middlesbrough – had he joined the club <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> played alongside captain Brian Clough and goalkeeper Peter Taylor.|$|E
5|$|John's first {{marriage}} probably dates to {{after his arrival}} in Serbia, though the identity of his first wife, if any, is unknown. If the next ruler of Valona, Alexander Komnenos Asen, was his son, <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been born circa 1346–1348, as he was already an adult in 1363–1366. This would place John's potential {{first marriage}} {{a few years before}} Alexander's estimated birth. Around 1350–1355, John married Anna Palaiologina, a granddaughter of Byzantine Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos and a widow of John II Orsini, the despot of Epirus. This marriage to an Epirote noblewoman consolidated and legitimised John's position in the region. Besides Alexander, another very likely child of John Komnenos Asen was a certain Komnena, the wife of Balša II who had succeeded Alexander as ruler of Valona in early 1372.|$|E

5|$|Newly crowned TNA X Division Champion, A.J. Styles, went on {{to defend}} his {{championship}} against Christopher Daniels in a 30-minute Iron Man match at Against All Odds. Styles had to defend the championship against Daniels at the event as per a pre-match stipulation to their bout on the January 21 episode of Impact!, in which if Styles failed to defeat Daniels in under 10 minutes, <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to give Daniels a title shot. Styles failed to win the contest in under ten minutes, which granted Daniels a title match. Dusty Rhodes then made the match a 30-minute Iron Man match.

25|$|Mickey Curtis said, {{also in a}} Criterion Collection interview, that he did {{not think}} he was a good actor, but Ichikawa said he just needed to act naturally. Ichikawa had heard that Curtis was very thin, so he decided to use him, as the {{characters}} in the story have eaten very little. Ichikawa specifically told each actor how he wanted them to react, and would not rehearse. Ichikawa expressed that the narrator (Tamura) could not be a cannibal because <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> crossed the ultimate low. Ichikawa consulted with his wife, Natto Wada, and they decided against having him eat human flesh. As a result, Tamura never eats any in the film because his teeth are falling out.|$|E

Although his advisers claim that his error in maintaining steady pressure rather than attacking was the result of using slightly too big a gear, which stopped his jumping away, I still think that it was in his head that Pou-Pou should have changed gears.|$|E

25|$|Immediately upon {{taking office}} in 1993, Chrétien {{cancelled}} {{the contract to}} buy the EH-101 helicopters and paid a $157.8 million termination fee to AgustaWestland. Additionally, Chrétien kept his Red Book promise of spending $6billion on infrastructure {{to stimulate the economy}} out of recession by signing the necessary orders, and to cancel the privatization of Pearson airport. The consortium that was due to take ownership of Pearson sued for breach of contract, which led the government to settle out of court in April 1997 for $60 million in damages. Chrétien phoned President Bill Clinton of the United States in November 1993 to ask him to renegotiate aspects of NAFTA. Clinton bluntly refused, saying that it had been extremely difficult to get Congress to ratify NAFTA, and if NAFTA was renegotiated, <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to submit the renegotiated treaty again for ratification, which was not something {{that he was going to}} do just for the sake of Chrétien. Clinton informed the Prime Minister that he either scrap NAFTA or accept it as it was, and at most he could offer were a few cosmetic concessions like writing a letter saying the United States was not interested in taking over Canada's energy and water. Chrétien chose the latter, and sought to portray Clinton's letter as a major American concession that constituted a renegotiated NAFTA, though in fact Clinton's letter was not legally binding and meant nothing. Only treaties ratified by Congress are legally binding on the U.S. government and presidential letters impose only a moral obligation, not a legal one, on the U.S government.|$|E
500|$|The victorious {{conclusion}} of the war cemented Heraclius' position as one of history's most successful generals. He was hailed as [...] "the new Scipio" [...] for his six years of unbroken victories and for leading the Roman army where no Roman army had ever gone before. The triumphal raising of the True Cross in the Hagia Sophia was a crowning moment in his achievements. Had Heraclius died <b>then,</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been recorded in history, {{in the words of}} the historian Norman Davies, as [...] "the greatest Roman general since Julius Caesar". Instead, he lived through the Arab invasions, losing battle after battle against their onslaught and tarnishing his reputation for victory. John Norwich succinctly described Heraclius as having [...] "lived too long".|$|E
500|$|The Gospel of Luke account {{appears to}} {{describe}} the event as an eclipse, and some non-Christian writers dismissed it in these terms. However, the biblical details do not accord with an eclipse: a solar eclipse could not have occurred {{on or near the}} Passover, when Jesus was crucified, and would have been too brief to account for three hours of darkness. [...] The [...] maximum possible duration of a total solar eclipse is seven minutes and 31.1 seconds. The only total eclipse visible in Jerusalem in this era fell later in the year, on 24 November 29 CE at 11:05 AM. Around the Sea of Galilee, it would have been visible for just one minute and forty-nine seconds. [...] For there to have been a partial or total eclipse of any duration while Jesus was crucified, <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> had to have been killed on November 24, 29 CE, about half a year later than scholars currently believe.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Tim Minear and [...] Vince Gilligan, and {{directed}} by Daniel Sackheim. Minear's original idea for the episode involved a convicted criminal {{who happened to be}} an atheist.

Although the police would be after him, only Mulder would believe he was working for the greater good. Minear noted that [...] "I pitched it and I was going to do it, eventually, until we found ourselves at a point in the year where we needed a script really fast." [...] Executive producer Frank Spotnitz suggested to Minear that the [...] "convicted atheist" [...] should actually be Robert Modell from the third season episode [...] "Pusher". After this was decided, Minear put aside the [...] "Word of God" [...] story, as it was called, teamed up with Gilligan, and the two wrote the final script.|$|E
500|$|Landy was {{initially}} hired to treat Brian Wilson by Wilson's wife Marilyn in 1975. Wilson publicly rebelled against the program, {{saying that the}} only reason that he went along with it was so {{that he would not be}} committed to a psychiatric facility. Beach Boys road manager Rick Nelson later claimed that Landy had attempted to exert unwelcome artistic control over the group. During the recording of 15 Big Ones (1976), group meetings were supervised by Landy, and discussions over each song for the record were reported to last for up to eight hours. Another report suggested that Landy had asked for a percentage of the band's income. At the command of Landy, Wilson appeared on Saturday Night Live, choosing to perform a solo piano rendition of [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] which received mixed feedback. Landy stood off-camera holding signs for Wilson that read [...] "smile". He said that critics misapprehended his motives, elaborating that Wilson's performance [...] "was a terrible thing" [...] as a one-shot, but if he continued making appearances, <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> gradually overcome his stage fright.|$|E
500|$|Byzantine {{accounts}} of Thomas's rebellion state {{that he did}} not in fact claim the throne under his own name but assumed the identity of Emperor Constantine VI, who had been deposed and murdered by his mother, Irene of Athens, in 797. Most modern scholars follow Lemerle, who dismisses this as yet another later fabrication. If it contains any truth, it is possible that this story may originate from Thomas choosing to be crowned under the regnal name of [...] "Constantine", but there is no evidence for such an act. The possible appropriation of Constantine VI's identity is linked in some Byzantine sources with the statement that Thomas was a rumoured supporter of iconolatry, as opposed to Michael's support for iconoclasm: it was under Constantine VI that veneration of the icons was restored. Nevertheless, the ambiguous phrasing of the sources, the iconoclast leanings of many themes in Asia Minor, and Thomas's alliance with the Arabs seem to speak against any open commitment to icon worship on his part. Indeed, given Michael II's conciliatory approach during his early reign, the icon worship controversy {{does not seem to have}} been a major issue at the time, and in the view of modern scholars most probably did not play a major role in Thomas's revolt. The image of Thomas as an iconophile champion opposed to the iconoclast Michael II in later, Macedonian-era sources was probably the result of their own anti-iconoclast bias. Warren Treadgold furthermore suggests that if true, Thomas's claim to be Constantine VI may have been little more than a tale circulated to win support, and that Thomas pursued a [...] "studied ambiguity" [...] towards icons, designed to attract support from iconophiles. In Treadgold's words, [...] "Thomas could be all things to all men until he had conquered the whole empire, and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> time enough to disappoint some of his followers".|$|E
