5|$|In the novel's final chapters, {{the three}} storylines {{intersect}} with increasing frequency. The tone of these chapters is especially dark as they deal primarily with the horrific torture {{and death of}} the assassins {{at the hands of}} the SIM, the failure of the coup, the rape of Urania, and the concessions made to Trujillo's most vicious supporters allowing them to enact their horrific revenge on the conspirators and then escape the country. The book ends as Urania prepares to return home, determined this time to keep in <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> family back on the island.|$|E
5|$|Outside of her work, Casson was {{a member}} of Bristol societies. She never lost <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> Welsh roots, {{discussing}} the similarities between Wales and Bristol with the Lord Mayor at a meal in 1931 and becoming president of the Bristol Cambrian Society in 1934. She also became the president of the Soroptimist Club of Bristol between 1938 and 1939 and was vice president of the Bristol branch of the British Social Hygiene Council in 1939.|$|E
5|$|To avoid {{identification}} with her former family or with Mormonism, Ina's mother reverted to using her maiden name, Coolbrith. The family resolved {{not to speak}} of their Mormon past, and it was only after Ina Coolbrith's death that the general public learned of her origin. Coolbrith did keep in <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> Smith relations, however, including a lifelong correspondence with her first-cousin Joseph F. Smith to whom and for whom she frequently expressed her love and regard.|$|E

5|$|Allingham met Dorothy Cator (1895–1970) in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk in 1918. They {{married the}} same year in Romford, when she was 22. They moved to Eastbourne, Sussex in 1960 and {{remained}} married until she died there from acute and chronic lymphatic leukaemia. They had two daughters, Betty (born 1920) and Jean (1923–2001). Jean emigrated to the United States and died aged 78 in 2001. At {{the time of his}} death Allingham believed that Betty had died. He had lost <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> in the 1970s following a family rift after the death of his wife in 1970. In fact Betty Hankin was still alive aged 89 when her father died, and living in Stroud, Gloucestershire. In addition to his one remaining daughter Betty, at {{the time of his death}} Allingham had seven grandchildren, 16 great-grandchildren, 14 great-great-grandchildren, and one great-great-great-grandchild.|$|E
5|$|C.J., however, {{seems more}} than {{reasonably}} distressed {{by the whole}} incident. She pays Hoynes a visit {{to give him a}} warning, and it becomes clear that {{she was one of the}} women with whom the Vice President had an affair. She makes it clear to him that, should he attempt smear tactics against any of these women, she will fight him on it, and he says he had no plans to include information about her in his book (when Hoynes' book is published in Season 6, a scene with C.J. confirms that he did not mention her in the book outside of her work as Press Secretary). C.J. later sadly relates to Toby how deeply she regretted sleeping with Hoynes. Distressed and in need of comfort, she decides to finally call her college boyfriend Ben, who has been trying to get in <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> (and been ignored or shunted aside) for quite a while.|$|E
5|$|Catherine Rottenberg {{argues that}} Larsen’s novella {{is a prime}} example of race and gender norms portrayed in the US. The main characters, Irene and Clare, and their {{struggle}} with their own identification problems in the novel, helps readers understand the difference between gender and race norms. These two central characters are able to pass as white women even though Irene does not fully pass over, and Rottenberg argues the difference between Clare and Irene by re-evaluating the idea of desire/identification. The mis-identification Clare deals with stems from her re-connection with Irene after twelve years of not speaking. Seeing Irene sparked a desire in Clare for her to get back in <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> African-American culture. Irene's identification trouble is associated with her need to feel safe and in control in her life, the main reason Irene chooses to pass over only on occasion. Irene doesn't want to put herself into a dangerous situation.|$|E

5|$|Shining Armor, Princess Celestia and {{the others}} {{apologize}} to Twilight for not believing her, and Princess Celestia commends Twilight Sparkle, for it was her instincts and conviction to them that ultimately saved the day; she is heralded as the one, true hero. The wedding ceremony is quickly rescheduled, with Twilight eagerly overseeing preparations for a much happier and profoundly appreciative Cadance. Shining Armor and Princess Cadance are married, and a celebration ensues, with Twilight as the wedding singer ("Love is in Bloom"). During the ceremony and the reception, Twilight's ingering anxiety of losing <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> brother is finally put to rest when Shining confesses that he persuaded Cadance to accept his proposal when he mentioned she would gain Twilight as a sister-in-law. Furthermore, just before the couple departs for their honeymoon, Shining thanks his sister for all she has done and the siblings reaffirm their love.|$|E
5|$|Although Suffolk was {{receiving}} minimal financial {{benefit from the}} new regime, he still took conspicuous part in all the major state ceremonies. Such events ranged from the 1465 royal wedding to tournaments such as that between Lord Scales and the Bastard of Burgundy in 1467. By this time the king's relations with the powerful Earl of Warwick had soured {{to the point that}} the discontented earl was fomenting rebellion against Edward. Suffolk remained loyal to his brother-in-law, and appears to have taken no part in the Neville/Woodville feud that occupied much of the second half of the decade. Suffolk particularly helped the king crush the Lincolnshire Rebellion in 1469 and participated at the Battle of Empingham early the following year. Edward was subsequently forced into exile however, and Suffolk appears not to have been trusted by the resurgent Lancastrian government, possibly because he refused to come to London to meet the chancellor, even if he appears to have come rapidly to terms with the new government personally. His wife kept in <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> exiled brothers in Burgundy. When Edward IV returned to England in March 1471, de la Pole joined him on that campaign, in which Edward regained his throne. Thus Suffolk also took part in the battles of Barnet (at which Warwick was killed) and Tewkesbury (at which the House of York finally crushed the remnants of the Lancastrian army).|$|E

25|$|Grand Duchess Vera {{was known}} in royal circles as an {{eccentric}} both in appearance and behavior.

After arriving in Australia, she settled in Melbourne and began working for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). She stayed in <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> parents who were by then living again in Perth. In September 2012, she {{had come back to}} Melbourne after visiting her father in Perth when he had a bout of ill health.|$|E
25|$|The two escort {{ships were}} unaware of what was {{happening}} to General Belgrano, as they were out of <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> in the gloom and had not seen the distress rockets or lamp signals. Adding to the confusion, the crew of Bouchard felt an impact that was possibly the third torpedo striking {{at the end of its}} run (an examination of the ship later showed an impact mark consistent with a torpedo). The two ships continued on their course westward and began dropping depth charges. By the time the ships realised that something had happened to General Belgrano, it was already dark and the weather had worsened, scattering the life rafts.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{this period}} {{she was in}} close and regular <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> parents, even though her father was {{increasingly}} busy with his political work. With the Labour Party victory in the 1945 election {{at the end of}} the War, Stafford had entered the cabinet as President of the Board of Trade, where he spent most of his time working on negotiations with the leaders of Indian independence, including Gandhi, Nehru and Jinnah. In November 1947, he became Chancellor of the Exchequer and most of the rest of his life he helped to manage the beginnings of the post-War recovery of Britain and the creation of the modern welfare state.|$|E

25|$|In her Cason manuscript, Josephine or Sadie {{wrote that}} she and Dora were homesick and {{returned}} to San Francisco with Sieber's help. If Sieber helped her, the only time period that fits Josephine's story is when Sieber was in the Prescott area at Camp Verde from 1873 to 1875. Josephine said that Sieber, who was German and may have recognized Josephine's German accent, guessed her situation and got in <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> brother-in-law Aaron Weiner. She said Weiner used a connection he had in Prescott to help Josephine get home. In January 1876, Josephine or Sadie left Prescott, stopped at a Los Angeles hotel, and returned to San Francisco before March 6.|$|E
25|$|While in Madras, Peter {{decided to}} officialise his {{relationship}} with Ovtchinnikova. The pair were married in a Danish consulate in September 1939. Aware of his family's disapproval of the relationship, but also possibly wishing {{to take advantage of}} the turmoil created by the recently declared Second World War, the Prince did not bother to inform either the Greek royal court or his parents about the marriage. The royal family learned of the mesalliance through the press a few weeks later. Prince George, affronted by his son's decision not to ask him or the King for permission to marry, disowned Peter and henceforward refused contact with him. Despite her own disappointment, however, Princess George remained in <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> son and continued to regularly send him money.|$|E
25|$|Four months later, Lily and Bart {{come back}} from their {{holidays}} in the Hamptons during which they renewed their vows.

Blair is running her mother's clothing company in Paris, Dan continues the writing of his book with Georgina, Nate is working at The Spectator, and Chuck is in Dubai trying to find what his father was doing there, before he faked his death and reappeared months ago, {{with the help of}} his father's translator, Amira (Andrea Gabriel). When the group receives the news that Serena has gone missing, Blair, Dan, Georgina and Chuck fly back to New York to find her. Ivy has moved in with Rufus letting him believe that she has no money anymore and no place to live to manipulate him and destroy Lily.|$|E
