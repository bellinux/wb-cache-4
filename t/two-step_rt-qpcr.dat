40|$|In this study, the {{performance}} of two real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assays {{for the detection of}} hepatitis A viruses (HAV) and GI and GII noroviruses (NoV) was tested in the presence of an environmental matrix by analyzing 15 inoculated environmental water samples. For the detection of HAV, an in-house <b>two-step</b> <b>RT-qPCR</b> from literature was compared with a commercial one-step real-time RT-PCR of Ceeram (La Chapelle-sur-Erdre, France). For the detection of GI and GII NoV, an in-house duplex <b>two-step</b> <b>RT-qPCR</b> assay was used and compared with the results obtained using two commercial singleplex one-step RT-qPCR assays of Ceeram (France). The performance of the two RT-qPCR assays was determined by comparing (1) standard curves, (2) the number of detected genomic copies, and (3) the influence of inhibition by RNA dilution. Both assays for the detection of GI and GII NoV performed likewise. For the detection of HAV, the differences in genomic copies detected were to some extent more apparent and in favor of the commercial one-step assay. When the HAV RT-qPCR assays were compared in terms of inhibition, {{the performance}} of the commercial one-step RT-qPCR kit was less affected for the detection of HAV in undiluted RNA in comparison to the in-house <b>two-step</b> <b>RT-qPCR</b> assay. On the other hand, inhibition had only a marginal influence on {{the performance of}} both assays for detection of HAV in the 1 / 10 diluted RNA. In conclusion, only minor differences were observed between the in-house RT-qPCR assays and the commercial one-step assays for the detection of HAV and NoV in environmental water samples...|$|E
30|$|The {{transcription}} {{levels of}} ctcH and ctcJ were assayed with RT-qPCR (Bio-Rad CFX 96). Sample preparation, RNA isolation, and the PCR were all conducted {{according to a}} previous study (Zhu et al. 2013). RT-qPCR was performed with the SYBR Green <b>Two-Step</b> <b>RT-qPCR</b> SuperMix (Takara). The transcription levels were normalized to the expression of 16 S rRNA. RT-qPCR was performed in three independent experiments, each in triplicate.|$|E
30|$|Various {{techniques}} have emerged to quantify miRNAs. MiRNA expression {{can be quantified}} by <b>two-step</b> <b>RT-qPCR,</b> which can provide relative quantification (Chen et al., 2005). MiRNAs can also be hybridized on microarrays, slides or chips with probes for hundreds of miRNA targets, and relative miRNA levels can be determined in different samples (Shingara et al., 2005). High-throughput sequencing methods {{can also be used}} to profile miRNAs (Buermans et al., 2010). RT-qPCR is usually performed as a standard for accuracy and sensitivity during the typical procedure to determine the miRNA expression profile. For this reason, the quality of the RT-qPCR system is closely related to the final determination and result.|$|E

40|$|Klebsiella pneumoniae is an {{opportunistic}} Gram-negative nonmotile {{bacteria that}} causes nosocomial infections. In these bacteria, nutrients {{as well as}} antibiotics are able to diffuse through the outer membrane via outer membrane porins, transmembrane protein channels. Loss of outer membrane porins, increased capsule production, and a highly mucoid phenotype are commonly observed among antibiotic resistant isolates of this pathogen. The goal {{of this study was}} to investigate changes in outer membrane porin expression and capsular polysaccharide production by K. pneumoniae as it transitions to a β-lactam antibiotic resistant phenotype. Klebsiella pneumoniae strain 43816, which is susceptible to β-lactam antibiotics such as cepthalothin, was exposed to increasing concentrations of cephalothin over a 14 -day period. During this period, daily samples of the bacteria were assessed for capsule synthesis, gene expression analysis, and changes in the physical appearance of the culture. At the end of the 14 -day exposure, cells had assimilated to survive in 7. 5 μg/mL of cephalothin, and had taken on a highly mucoid phenotype. High levels of capsular polysaccharides synthesis were confirmed by the uronic acid assay. Minimum inhibitory concentration assay showed treated cultures had become highly resistant to cephalothin. <b>Two-step</b> <b>RT-qPCR</b> demonstrated that this assimilated bacteria exhibited upregulation of magA, which has been linked to invasive, mucoid forms of Klebsiella infection. Additionally, cultures at the end of the treatment consistently showed downregulation of ompK 35 and ompK 36 and upregulation of ompK 26. These data demonstrate that low-level exposure to cephalothin can induce significant changes in cellular phenotype that may impact both the resistance and virulence profile...|$|E
40|$|Biomarkers are {{critically}} important for disease diagnosis and monitoring. In particular, close monitoring of disease evolution is eminently {{required for the}} evaluation of therapeutic treatments. Classical monitoring methods in muscular dystrophies are largely based on histological and molecular analyses of muscle biopsies. Such biopsies are invasive and therefore difficult to obtain. The serum protein creatine kinase is a useful biomarker, which is however not specific for a given pathology and correlates poorly with the severity or course of the muscular pathology. The aim {{of the present study was}} the systematic evaluation of serum microRNAs (miRNAs) as biomarkers in striated muscle pathologies. Mouse models for five striated muscle pathologies were investigated: Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2 D (LGMD 2 D), limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2 C (LGMD 2 C), Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). <b>Two-step</b> <b>RT-qPCR</b> methodology was elaborated, using two different RT-qPCR miRNA quantification technologies. We identified miRNA modulation in the serum of all the five mouse models. The most highly dysregulated serum miRNAs were found to be commonly upregulated in DMD, LGMD 2 D and LGMD 2 C mouse models, which all exhibit massive destruction of striated muscle tissues. Some of these miRNAs were down rather than upregulated in the EDMD mice, a model without massive myofiber destruction. The dysregulated miRNAs identified in the HCM model were different, with the exception of one dysregulated miRNA common to all pathologies. Importantly, a specific and distinctive circulating miRNA profile was identified for each studied pathological mouse model. The differential expression of a few dysregulated miRNAs in the DMD mice was further evaluated in DMD patients, providing new candidates of circulating miRNA biomarkers for DMD...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Occurrence of {{extrachromosomal}} dsRNA elements {{has been}} described in the red-yeast Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous, with numbers and sizes that are highly variable among strains with different geographical origin. The studies concerning to the encapsidation in viral-like particles and dsRNA-curing have suggested that some dsRNAs are helper viruses, while others are satellite viruses. However, the nucleotide sequences and functions of these dsRNAs are still unknown. In this work, the nucleotide sequences of four dsRNAs of the strain UCD 67 – 385 of X. dendrorhous were determined, and their identities and genome structures are proposed. Based on this molecular data, the dsRNAs of different strains of X. dendrorhous were analyzed. Results The complete sequences of L 1, L 2, S 1 and S 2 dsRNAs of X. dendrorhous UCD 67 – 385 were determined, finding two sequences for L 1 dsRNA (L 1 A and L 1 B). Several ORFs were uncovered in both S 1 and S 2 dsRNAs, but no homologies were found for any of them {{when compared to the}} database. Instead, two ORFs were identified in each L 1 A, L 1 B and L 2 dsRNAs, whose deduced amino acid sequences were homologous with a major capsid protein (5 ’-ORF) and a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (3 ’-ORF) belonging to the Totiviridae family. The genome structures of these dsRNAs are characteristic of Totiviruses, with two overlapped ORFs (the 3 ’-ORF in the − 1 frame with respect to the 5 ’-ORF), with a slippery site and a pseudoknot in the overlapped regions. These structures are essential for the synthesis of the viral polymerase as a fusion protein with the viral capsid protein through − 1 ribosomal frameshifting. In the RNase protection analysis, all the dsRNAs in the four analyzed X. dendrorhous strains were protected from enzymatic digestion. The RT-PCR analysis revealed that, similar to strain UCD 67 – 385, the L 1 A and L 1 B dsRNAs coexist in the strains VKM Y- 2059, UCD 67 – 202 and VKM Y- 2786. Furthermore, determinations of the relative amounts of L 1 dsRNAs using <b>two-step</b> <b>RT-qPCR</b> revealed a 40 -fold increment of the ratio L 1 A/L 1 B in the S 2 dsRNA-cured strain compared to its parental strain. Conclusions Three totiviruses, named as XdV-L 1 A, XdV-L 1 B and XdV-L 2, were identified in the strain UCD 67 – 385 of X. dendrorhous. The viruses XdV-L 1 A and XdV-L 1 B were also found in other three X. dendrorhous strains. Our results suggest that the smaller dsRNAs (named XdRm-S 1 and XdRm-S 2) of strain UCD 67 – 385 are satellite viruses, and particularly that XdRm-S 2 is a satellite of XdV-L 1 A. </p...|$|E
