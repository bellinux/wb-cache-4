500|$|In {{the wake}} of Labour's second defeat at the Scottish Parliament {{election}} of May 2011, which saw the Scottish National Party (SNP) form its first majority government, Gray announced his intention to step down {{as leader of the}} Labour MSPs later that year. A review chaired by Jim Murphy and Sarah Boyack into the party's structure in Scotland subsequently concluded that the next leader should lead the entire Scottish Labour Party rather than just its MSPs, as previous leaders had. Lamont declared her candidacy for the leadership election in September 2011 and launched her campaign on 7 November at Stirling University. She told delegates that Labour needed to reengage with the electorate if it wanted to govern again: [...] "We must listen and learn, show humility and seek again to talk for and to people's ambitions and concerns. Our real challenge is <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>in</b> Labour lost our way, lost our confidence and lost Scotland." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{agreement}} was initialed on 25 July 1963, just 10 days after negotiations commenced. The following day, Kennedy delivered a 26-minute televised {{address on the}} agreement, declaring that since the invention of nuclear weapons, [...] "all mankind has been struggling {{to escape from the}} darkening prospect of mass destruction on earth... Yesterday a shaft of light cut into the darkness." [...] Kennedy expressed hope that the test ban would be the first step towards broader rapprochement, limit nuclear fallout, restrict nuclear proliferation, and slow the arms race {{in such a way that}} fortifies US security. Kennedy concluded his address in reference to a Chinese proverb that he had used with Khrushchev in Vienna two years prior. [...] "'A journey of a thousand miles must begin with a single step,'" [...] Kennedy said. [...] "And if that journey is a thousand miles, or even more, let history record <b>that</b> <b>we,</b> <b>in</b> this land, at this time, took the first step." ...|$|E
500|$|Following the {{collapse}} of the federation in 1964, Southern Rhodesia then started calling itself Rhodesia and adopted a new flag {{at the behest of the}} Prime Minister of Rhodesia as a protest against the federation and the British government. The new flag used the same details as the previous one, but instead used a sky-blue background rather than the traditional dark blue. The new flag used the same colour as the Royal Air Force Ensign because the government wanted to make the Rhodesian flag more recognisable and it was chosen as a way to protest against the British government's treatment of Southern Rhodesia during their time as part of the Federation. After the breakup of the federation, black Rhodesians viewed the new flag as a symbol of white supremacy as it was created by Prime Minister Ian Smith's minority government and the British government did not veto the change despite having the power to do so. Following the Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI) in 1965, Rhodesia continued to use the flag of Southern Rhodesia as a symbol of loyalty to Queen Elizabeth II, despite the British government not recognising UDI. Smith said: [...] "Let there be no doubt <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>in</b> this country stand second to none in our loyalty to the Queen, and whatever else other countries may have done or may yet do, it is our intention that the Union Jack will continue to fly in Rhodesia and the national anthem continue to be sung." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hitchcock was lauded in Britain, {{where he}} was dubbed [...] "Alfred the Great" [...] by Picturegoer magazine. Additionally, his {{reputation}} was beginning to soar overseas {{by the end of}} the 1930s, with a New York Times feature writer stating: [...] "Three unique and valuable institutions the British have <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>in</b> America have not. Magna Carta, the Tower Bridge and Alfred Hitchcock, the greatest director of screen melodramas in the world." [...] Variety magazine referred to him as [...] "probably the best native director in England".|$|E

2500|$|Following Hitler's {{invasion}} of Czechoslovakia and Poland, Lindbergh decried suggestions that the United States should send aid to countries under threat, writing [...] "I {{do not believe}} that repealing the arms embargo would assist democracy in Europe" [...] and [...] "If we repeal the arms embargo with the idea of assisting one of the warring sides to overcome the other, then why mislead ourselves by talk of neutrality?" [...] He equated assistance with war profiteering: [...] "To those who argue that we could make a profit and build up our own industry by selling munitions abroad, I reply <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>in</b> America have not yet reached a point where we wish to capitalize on the destruction and death of war." ...|$|E

2500|$|While in Europe, the Lindberghs came to {{advocate}} isolationist views {{that led to}} their fall from grace {{in the eyes of}} many. In 1938, the U.S. Air Attaché in Berlin invited Charles to inspect the rising power of Nazi Germany's Air Force. Impressed by German technology and their apparent number of aircraft and influenced by the staggering number of deaths from World War I, Charles opposed U.S. entry into the impending European conflict. He suggested any military assistance to Britain might be done for improper financial reasons: [...] "To those who argue that we could make a profit and build up our own industry by selling munitions abroad, I reply <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>in</b> America have not yet reached a point where we wish to capitalize on the destruction and death of war." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tutu preached {{a message}} of {{forgiveness}} during a 1989 trip to Israel's Yad Vashem museum, saying [...] "Our Lord would {{say that in the}} end the positive thing that can come is the spirit of forgiving, not forgetting, but the spirit of saying: God, this happened to us. We pray for those who made it happen, help us to forgive them and help us so <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>in</b> our turn will not make others suffer." [...] Some found this statement offensive, with Rabbi Marvin Hier of the Simon Wiesenthal Center calling it [...] "a gratuitous insult to Jews and victims of Nazism everywhere." [...] Tutu was subjected to racial slurs during this visit to Israel, with vandals writing [...] "Black Nazi pig" [...] {{on the walls of the}} St. George's Cathedral in East Jerusalem, where he was staying.|$|E
2500|$|Zeman {{announced}} {{that he intended to}} visit Moscow for the 2015 Victory Day celebrations and the 70th anniversary of the liberation from Nazi Germany. He said {{that he was not going}} to look at military equipment, but rather to honour the soldiers who had sacrificed their lives. He described his visit to Moscow as an [...] "expression of thankfulness <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>in</b> this country don't have to speak German, if we would have become submissive collaborators of Aryan origin", and that [...] "we don't have to say Heil Hitler, Heil Himmler, Heil Göring, and eventually Heil Heydrich, that would have been particularly interesting". Most other EU leaders declared that they would not attend the events due to the conflict in eastern Ukraine. U.S. ambassador Andrew H. Schapiro criticized the decision, saying that it would [...] "be awkward" [...] if Zeman was the only politician from the EU at the ceremony. Zeman responded by banning him from the Prague Castle.|$|E

He will be missed in ways that I don't think we all understand yet. There was no question about his reputation. His approach was always a no-nonsense, no-politics approach.

He is one of the defining figures, one of the great figures in wine of our time." [...] Patrick Gleeson, executive director of the American Vineyard Foundation, who Meyer had mentored as a young lad said [...] "His vision and love for wine has undoubtedly made him a living legacy amongst friends, peers and those in the industry. Justin's passing will not diminish the influence he has had on the wine industry and hopefully it will inspire others to follow in his footsteps." ...|$|E
