It shows that the real impact of a (rational deterministic) speculative bubble depends on the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>asset</b> that is being speculated on. Speculative bubbles on equity raise the market value of firms, thus encouraging entrepreneurship, firm creation, investment, and growth.

Namely, the different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>asset</b> restructuring behavior will produce different effects of the financial value drivers on the same <b>type</b> <b>of</b> restructuring objects, and the same behavior <b>of</b> <b>asset</b> restructuring will produce different effects of the financial value drivers on different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> the restructuring objects...|$|R

This trend has potentially wideñranging implications for the intertemporal and cross-sectional allocation of risk, and for the macro economy, establishing the need for understanding ownership dynamics at the micro level. This paper offers {{one of the first}} such analyses using representative panel survey data. We focus on the two main <b>types</b> <b>of</b> risky financial <b>assets,</b> mutual funds and individual stocks. We extend existing univariate dynamic binary choice models to the multivariate case and take account of interactions between the two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets.</b> The models are estimated on data from the 1993 ñ 1998 waves of the Dutch CentER Savings Survey.

These findings can be explained by adjustment costs that make it optimal to stick to one <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>asset.</b> ...|$|R
