Deliberate self-harm {{is common in}} <b>the</b> <b>developing</b> <b>world.</b> Research into self-harm in <b>the</b> <b>developing</b> <b>world</b> is however still very limited although an important case study is that of Sri Lanka, which is a country exhibiting {{a high incidence of}} suicide and self-poisoning with agricultural pesticides or natural poisons. Many people admitted for deliberate self-poisoning during a study by Eddleston et al. were young and few expressed a desire to die, but death was relatively common in the young in these cases. The improvement of medical management of acute poisoning in <b>the</b> <b>developing</b> <b>world</b> is poor and improvements are required in order to reduce mortality.|$|E

In 2015 it resulted in 3.2 million deaths, up from 2.4 million deaths in 1990. More than 90% of these deaths occur in <b>the</b> <b>developing</b> <b>world.</b> The number of deaths is projected to increase further because of higher smoking rates in <b>the</b> <b>developing</b> <b>world,</b> and an aging population in many countries.

In <b>the</b> <b>developing</b> <b>world</b> children {{less than two years}} of age frequently get six or more infections a year.

The World Health Organization advocates zinc supplementation for severe malnutrition and diarrhea. Zinc supplements help prevent disease and reduce mortality, especially among children with low birth weight or stunted growth. However, zinc supplements should not be administered alone, because many in <b>the</b> <b>developing</b> <b>world</b> have several deficiencies, and zinc interacts with other micronutrients.|$|E

Sometimes the notion of suburb may even refer to people in real misery, who are kept at the limit of the city borders for economic, social, and sometimes ethnic reasons. An example in <b>the</b> <b>developed</b> <b>world</b> would be <b>the</b> banlieues of France, or the concrete suburbs of Sweden, even if the suburbs of these countries also include middle-class and upper-class neighborhoods that often consist of single-family houses.
