50|$|Scholars in {{international}} relations can be broken up into two different practices, realists and pluralists, of what they believe <b>the</b> ontological <b>state</b> of <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>is.</b> Realists believe {{that the world is}} one of only states and interstate relations and the identity of <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>is</b> defined before any international relations with other <b>states.</b> On <b>the</b> other hand, pluralists believe that <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>is</b> not <b>the</b> only actor {{in international}} relations and interactions between <b>states</b> and <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>is</b> competing against many other actors.|$|R
