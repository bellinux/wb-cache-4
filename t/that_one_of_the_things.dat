5|$|Carlsen {{was born}} in Tønsberg, Norway, on 30 November 1990, to Sigrun Øen, a {{chemical}} engineer and Henrik Albert Carlsen, an IT consultant. The family spent one year in Espoo, Finland, and then in Brussels, Belgium, before returning to Norway in 1998, where they lived in Lommedalen, Bærum. They later moved to Haslum. Carlsen showed an aptitude for intellectual challenges at a young age: at two years, he could solve 50-piece jigsaw puzzles; at four, he enjoyed assembling Lego sets with instructions intended for children aged 10–14. His father taught him to play chess {{at the age of}} 5, although he initially showed little interest in the game. He has three sisters, and in 2010 he stated <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> that first motivated him to take up chess seriously was the desire to beat his elder sister at the game.|$|E
500|$|As {{counsel for}} the prosecution, Hastings was the first {{barrister}} to speak. In his opening speech to the jury he criticised Booth for loving money rather than his country, saying <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> which the English prided themselves on was fair play, and [...] "no matter how loudly the defendant raises the cry of patriotism, I feel sure that your sense of fair play, gentlemen, will ensure a verdict that the defendant is unfit {{to sit in the}} House of Commons, as he has been guilty of fraud". Hastings then called Gruban to the witness stand, and asked him to tell the jury what had happened. Gruban described how Booth had claimed to have influence over David Lloyd George. Gruban was then cross-examined by Rigby Swift.|$|E
500|$|... “The Princess and the Pea” spurred on {{positive}} criticism, as well. In fact, critic Paul Hazard {{pointed out}} the realistic aspects of the fairy tale that make it easily relatable to all people. He believed that [...] "the world Andersen witnessed—which encompassed sorrow, death, evil, and man's follies—is reflected in his tales," [...] and most evidently in [...] "The Princess and the Pea." [...] Another scholar, Niels Kofoed, noticed that “since they involve everyday-life themes of love, death, nature, injustice, suffering, and poverty, they appeal to all races, ideologies, classes, and genders.” Moreover, Celia Catlett Anderson realized <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> that makes this story so appealing and relatable is that optimism prevails over pessimism, especially for the main character of the princess. This inspires hope in the readers for their own futures and strength within themselves.|$|E

500|$|... "Blame It on Lisa" [...] was {{met with}} {{negative}} reception in Brazil shortly after its broadcast in the United States. According to The Washington Post, [...] "an immediate media frenzy was born" [...] as the episode started receiving coverage in local newspapers and news programs on Brazilian television. An article published in the Houston Chronicle on April 8, 2002 stated that critics in the country were upset by the inclusion of clichés and stereotypes not related to Brazil, such as Brazilians having Spanish accents and wearing mustaches. The general Brazilian perception was that the episode mixed up their culture with that of surrounding Spanish-speaking Latin American countries. Alex Bellos, The Guardians correspondent in Brazil, commented <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> upsetting the Brazilians was the many inaccuracies featured in the episode, such as the conga and the macarena being popular dances in Brazil; the conga is actually a Caribbean dance, and the macarena {{does not come from}} Brazil nor is it frequently performed there.|$|E
500|$|Liz and Carol {{discover}} <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> {{they have}} in common is that they both love to watch The Muppets presenting award shows. Later, Liz reveals that she has a Life Alert Emergency Response necklace; this necklace helps the elderly contact emergency services in case of an accident. Carol wonders why Geico—an auto insurance company—has multiple mascots, a reference to Geico's advertising campaigns. Jack plans to seduce the gay interior designer that Avery hired and hopes to get the designer to agree with him to leave the apartment the way it is, explaining to Liz [...] "Do you know what a prize I am in the gay community? There's a term for it. I'm a bear. And I'm a daddy. I'm a daddy bear." [...] Before parting ways, Liz says to Carol [...] "See you October 14", a reference to the live episode of 30 Rock entitled [...] "Live Show" [...] that aired on October 14, 2010.|$|E

2500|$|Regarding the {{decision}} to do an episode about Anne Frank, Murphy said, [...] "We have a great writing staff but I will take credit for <b>that.</b> <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> we've done on the show is we take historical figures – {{last year was the}} Black Dahlia and this year is Anne Frank. The Black Dahlia particularly was a case that was never solved so we solved that case in our way. The Anne Frank thing was always interesting to me because after the war, much like the Anastasia case, there were many women who came forward after that diary and said, 'Well I'm the real Anne Frank,' and they were struck down. Many of them were found to be mentally ill and suffering from schizophrenia, so I read about those cases. Before we even wrote one word of it, I thought there was sort of only one actress I was interested in playing Anne Frank and that was Franka. So I brought her in and said, 'I'm gonna write this for you and would you do it.' And we had no script because we were very early on in the season. She loved the story and I sorta swore her to secrecy and God bless her heart she had like five months without telling anybody. I love how it came together." ...|$|E

Yet {{he could not help}} feeling {{infinite}} pity for the painter who had just made this strange confession to him, and wondered if he himself would ever be so dominated by the personality of a friend. Lord Henry had the charm of being very dangerous. But that was all. He was too clever and too cynical to be really fond of. Would there ever be someone who would fill him with a strange idolatry?

60|$|In any case, Austin found Pancho Brown {{was away}} buying {{tomatoes}} {{when he called}} at his office, and the Spanish clerk also informed him that Miss Brown and Mrs. Hatherly had left Las Palmas for a while. He fancied {{they had gone to}} Madeira, but was not certain, and Austin, who left him a message for Brown and a letter Jefferson had charged him with to be forwarded to Miss Gascoyne, went on to the telegraph office more dejected than ever. Jacinta had, usually, a bracing effect upon those she came into contact with, and Austin, who felt he needed a mental stimulant, realised now <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> that had sustained him was the expectation of hearing her express her approval of what he had done.

6000|$|Maisie {{had it on}} her tongue's end {{to return}} once more: [...] "But now he's free." [...] She remembered, however, in time <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> she had known for the last entire hour was that this made no difference. After that, and as if to turn the right way, {{she was on the}} point of a blind dash, a weak {{reversion}} to the reminder that it might make a difference, might diminish the crime for Mrs. Beale; till such a reflexion was in its order also quashed by the visibility in Mrs. Wix's face of the collapse produced by her inference from her pupil's manner that after all her pains her pupil didn't even yet adequately understand. Never so much as when confronted had Maisie wanted to understand, and all her thought for a minute centred in the effort to come out with something which should be a disproof of her simplicity. [...] "Just TRUST me, dear; that's all!"--she came out finally with that; and it was perhaps a good sign of her action that with a long, impartial moan Mrs. Wix floated her to bed.|$|E
60|$|The two ladies who, {{in advance}} of the Swiss season, had been warned that their design was unconsidered, that the passes would not be clear, nor the air mild, nor the inns open--the two ladies who, characteristically, had braved a good deal of {{possibly}} interested remonstrance were finding themselves, as their adventure turned out, wonderfully sustained. It was the judgment of the head-waiters and other functionaries on the Italian lakes that approved itself now as interested; they themselves had been conscious of impatiences, of bolder dreams--at least the younger had; so <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> they made out together--making out as they did an endless variety--was that in those operatic palaces of the Villa d'Este, of Cadenabbia, of Pallanza and Stresa, lone women, however reinforced by a travelling-library of instructive volumes, were apt to be beguiled and undone. Their flights of fancy moreover had been modest; they had for instance risked nothing vital in hoping to make their way by the Brünig. They were making it in fact happily enough as we meet them, and were only wishing that, for the wondrous beauty of the early high-climbing spring, it might have been longer and the places to pause and rest more numerous.|$|E
6000|$|Now, in {{the first}} place, I was writing under an assumed character, and must talk as the person would whose {{mouthpiece}} I made myself. Will any one familiar with the New England countryman venture {{to tell me that}} he does not speak of sacred things familiarly? that Biblical allusions (allusions, that is, to the single book with whose language, from his church-going habits, he is intimate) are not frequent on his lips? If so, he cannot have pursued his studies of the character on so many long-ago muster-fields and at so many cattle-shows as I. But I scorn any such line of defence, and will confess at once <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> I am proud of in my countrymen is (I am not speaking now of such persons as I have assumed Mr. Sawin to be) that they do not put their Maker away far from them, or interpret the fear of God into being afraid of Him. The Talmudists had conceived a deep truth when they said, that 'all things were in the power of God, save the fear of God;' and when people stand in great dread of an invisible power, I suspect they mistake quite another personage for the Deity. I might justify myself for the passages criticised by many parallel ones from Scripture, but I need not. The Reverend Homer Wilbur's note-books supply me with three apposite quotations. The first is from a Father of the Roman Church, the second from a Father of the Anglican, and the third from a Father of Modern English poetry. The Puritan divines would furnish me with many more such. St. Bernard says, Sapiens nummularius est Deus: nummum fictum non recipiet; 'A cunning money-changer is God: he will take in no base coin.' Latimer says, 'You shall perceive that God, by this example, shaketh us by the noses and taketh us by the ears.' Familiar enough, both of them, one would say! But I should think Mr. Biglow had verily stolen the last of the two maligned passages from Dryden's 'Don Sebastian,' where I find ...|$|E
