40|$|Abstract: In this study, the {{important}} kinematic and post-operative {{changes in the}} spinal column and rib cage after corrective surgery of scoliosis using the pedicle screw and rod derotation method was determined using a finite element scoliosis spine model, and the optimized instrumented levels for scoliosis correction was determined. A three dimensional FE scoliosis model was reconstructed by translation and rotation of a normal spinal column model using geometric mapping with x-ray and CT. By changing the fusion levels in the calculations, postoperative changes like Cobb angle, apical vertebrae axial rotation (AVAR), thoracic kyphosis, and rib hump were qualitatively analyzed. In the analysis of operative kinematics, the decrease in Cobb angle was most prominent in distraction than in deroation. Applying only the rod derotation was not effective in decreasing the Cobb angle and just caused {{an increase in the}} AVAR and rib hump. In the operative simulation, co-action of distraction and <b>translation</b> during <b>rod</b> insertion had a major impact on decreasing the Cobb angle and maintaining kyphosis. For the rod rotation, a decrease in the Cobb angle was obtained; however, this was accompanied by a simultaneous increase in the AVAR and rib hump. When the most extended instrumentation range with a 60 o rod rotation was used the Cobb angle was decreased in half, but an increase in the rib hump and AVAR also occurred. The optimum fusion level was found to be one level less than the inflection position of the thoracic spine curvature...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{publications}} {{confirm that}} moderate correction of thoracic hypokyphosis {{can be achieved}} by posterior instrumentation with hooks or pedicle screws. Twenty-four prospective and consecutive thoracic adolescent scoliosis patients with hypokyphosis (< 20 °) were operated on by posterior spinal fusion (PSF) with a specific method of reduction: Simultaneous <b>translation</b> on two <b>rods</b> (ST 2 R), performed by the same surgeon using stable anchorages such as screws or self-stabilizing claws. Radiographic parameters were measured preoperatively, at 1  month, 1  year and at 2  years minimum follow-up. In the coronal plane, the average main curve was significantly reduced from 51 ° to 17 ° and maintained at last follow-up, corresponding to an average correction of 67 %. In the sagittal plane, the average kyphosis angle was significantly improved from 9 ° to 30 ° postoperatively and to 32 ° at last follow-up, corresponding to a mean gain of 23 °. The 24 patients reported normal kyphosis at last follow-up (≥ 20 °). Reduction of scoliosis by ST 2 R is an effective method that gives coronal correction equivalent to all screw constructs and allows restoration of normal thoracic kyphosis...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE. To {{determine}} whether alterations in rod cGMP-gated channel function mediate retinal degeneration, a transgenic approach {{in which the}} � subunit of the rod cGMP-gated channel is reduced by the expression of an antisense RNA was used. METHODS. A 890 -bp fragment of the 5 � mouse rod cGMP-gated channel cDNA was cloned in the antisense orientation {{under the control of}} the strong bacterial cytomegalovirus promoter. This antisense construct was used to generate transgenic mice in which the expression of the antisense transgene was measured by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction. Histologic, immunocytochemical, and TdT-dUTP terminal nick-end labeling (TUNEL) analyses were performed on control and transgenic retina sections to determine the effects of antisense expression on specific cell types. RESULTS. The antisense RNA was able to inhibit the <b>translation</b> of the <b>rod</b> channel protein in an in vitro assay. Three transgenic mouse lines expressing the antisense construct were obtained. Molecular analyses showed that the antisense is expressed in the eye of each transgenic mouse line, where it reduces rod cGMP-gated channel RNA expression. Histologic and immunocytochemical data showed that transgenic retinas have a reduced number of photoreceptors and bipolar cells...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{previously}} demonstrated that an axially loaded weightless circular rod buckles helically when constrained within a circular cylinder. The effects of pinned and fixed end conditions {{on the behavior of}} such a helically buckled rod are investigated. Both end conditions locate the rod end on the cylinder axis. The pinned end condition considers the rod end free to rotate about all three axes, allows axial translation, and prevents radial movement. The fixed end condition allows axial rotation and <b>translation,</b> requires the <b>rod</b> end to be tangent to the cylinder axis, and prevents radial movement. Both end conditions are found to perturb the helix in an exponentially decaying manner for a distance of less than one pitch length. Far from the end, the rod behaves as an undisturbed constant-pitch helix. The distance from the rod end to the point of initial contact with the cylinder wall is calculated. Closed form analytical solutions are obtained for the deflected shapes and internal reactions of the end sections. The maximum internal bending moment for the pinned-end case is 19. 5 % higher in the end section than in the helical section. The maximum bending moment for the fixed-end case also occurs in the end section and is 1 % higher than in the helical section. The solution procedure applies to rods of either finite or infinite length. Experimental results confirm the analytical findings...|$|R
40|$|This {{project is}} a first {{iteration}} of an automated foosball table designed and created using servomotors provided by Yaskawa to create an interactive tradeshow display where guests can play against the algorithms developed in the PLC (programmable logic controller) controlling the servomotors. There will be a second iteration of the project done by a different team directly following this one. The motion components were selected {{with the intent to}} be able to surpass the reaction times and speeds of expert human players. There are a total of eight servomotors, four controlling linear actuators for <b>translation</b> of <b>rods,</b> and four controlling the rotation of rods. The table is equipped with a vision system that will output the location of the foosball, calculate the velocity, and predict the future ball location. Using the inputs from the vision system, the algorithms in the PLC decides how to move each rod. In addition to the motion and vision system, structures were designed and built to support the components. There is a scoreboard made from sheet metal parts that was intended to automatically keep score of the game. A vision arch was designed and manufactured using Aluminum extruded parts to support the scoreboard and camera of the vision system. A display case was designed and manufactured to house all the motion components and electrical components to ensure guests can not touch any moving or electrical parts while being able to see all the motion components of the system. A playfield cover was designed to prevent guests from touching the foosmen while the system is in motion. For the first iteration, motion system, display case, vision arch, and the scoreboard was completely designed and built. The motion system includes basic algorithm that only used position input to decide the positions of each rod individually in both rotation and axial directions to block or shoot the ball. The vision system, scoreboard, and playfield cover was not finished. Parts for the vision system was selected and purchased, but programming was not finished to output correct position and communicate with the PLC. To compensate, an HMI interface was created to simulate continuous ball position inputs to the PLC. Lighting issues with the vision system was not resolved. The scoreboard structure was built, but the electronics were not assembled and programming not finished due to time constraints. The playfield cover structure was designed, but the covering material (acrylic, wire mesh, etc) was not selected due to interference with the vision system. The second iteration of the project should finish the parts that are incomplete from this first iteration, such as the implementing the vision system, scoreboard, and playfield cover. The structural and motion components should be sufficient, but changes and improvements can be made as well. The major improvements would be to the programming of the PLC to include foosball strategies to better simulate a player...|$|R
