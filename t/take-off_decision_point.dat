40|$|Most {{research}} {{investigates the}} effect of a defendant’s race on severity of imposed legal sanction at only one of several <b>decision</b> <b>points</b> that comprise the criminal justice system. This myopic focus on what can be termed episodic discrimination is pro-blematic because racial discrimination evinced at one <b>decision</b> <b>point</b> may be amplified, negated, or even reversed at other <b>decision</b> <b>points.</b> Here we synthesize estimates of a defendant’s race on the severity of imposed legal sanction at each of the <b>decision</b> <b>points</b> encountered by a defendant as he or she progresses through the criminal justice system. Although initial results show that {{the effect of}} race on severity of outcome depends on the specific <b>decision</b> <b>point</b> analyzed, a synthesis of these race estimates in a meta-analysis reveals that the odds of receiving a severe sanction is approximately 42 % higher for a Black defendant even after controlling for prior record and other legal and extralegal variables. Thus, although the influence of a defen-dant’s race on the severity of sanction is statistically discernible at just two of the eight criminal justice <b>decision</b> <b>points,</b> a substantive cumulative racial discriminatory effect is evident when all the individual <b>decision</b> <b>points</b> are considered in their totality...|$|R

40|$|DI-GRUBER is a {{distributed}} Grid brokering service, {{with multiple}} <b>decision</b> <b>points.</b> Previously, the membership relationship among the <b>decision</b> <b>points</b> was statically defined.

The underlying mechanisms provide each <b>decision</b> <b>point</b> the necessary information regarding the location of other <b>decision</b> <b>points.</b> One interesting difference in this approach is that each <b>decision</b> <b>point</b> can have only a partial view of the brokering infrastructure, and hence the brokers’ performance suffers to some degree.

40|$|This {{qualitative}} study explores <b>decision</b> <b>points</b> in {{the careers of}} justice organizers. Organizing represents a cornerstone set of specialized practices by which power and participation may be promoted among poor and disenfranchised groups. Yet organizers (especially women, minorities, and working class) face challenges that can undermine their performance and sustainability. Instability in organizing careers means frequent and difficult (and understudied) <b>decision</b> <b>points</b> for organizers. The study relies upon an interdisciplinary framework, in-depth interview responses from 14 diverse participants, archival data, and fieldwork. Accounts of overall careers and 72 <b>decision</b> <b>points</b> were examined using case induction methodology. Findings have yielded a substantive theory that describes and suggests explanations for <b>decision</b> <b>point</b> processes and outcomes. Results suggest that personal histories and status quo factors acted upon <b>decision</b> <b>points,</b> and that <b>decisions</b> can {{be understood in terms}} of concurrent processes of sensemaking, decision-making, navigation of opportunity structures, and transition and transformation. The factors organizers considered at <b>decision</b> <b>points,</b> tensions and conflicts among these, diversity themes and disparities among organizers of different backgrounds, and dialectical patterns of development emerged, along with contextual influences, organizer strategies, and descriptive and evaluative output measures. Twelve types of <b>decision</b> <b>points,</b> associated with varying phases of careers, also emerged. I have posed hypotheses about the effects of personal characteristics and histories on status quo situations and understandings, and on variance in the process and outputs of <b>decision</b> <b>points.</b> Others address direct and indirect effects of status quo, variations in the process, contextual influences, and organizer strategies on outputs. While any one <b>decision</b> <b>point</b> did not predict long-term outcomes, the effects of short-term events and circumstances may be magnified during these junctures and have a cumulative effect. Overall, findings supported adaptive, psychosocial understandings of organizing careers. Sustainability and efficacy of organizers may depend upon achieving satisfaction, generating and devising new pathways, cultivating and economizing resources, building identity and relationships, and being adaptable and undergoing continuous transformation. Findings revealed both continued barriers facing women, working-class, and organizers of color, as well as progress in the establishment of opportunities and safe spaces to support their careers...|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} <b>decision</b> <b>points</b> is {{introduced}} {{as a tool}} for analyzing computational processes in dendritic trees. Using this concept, a simplified model of a dendritic tree is derived. The various nonlinear processes in dendritic trees are interpreted as "computational decisions" made at "decision points". This simplified model provides insights into the possible role of dendritic geometry and passive biophysical properties such as R m and R i. First, we demonstrate the computational limitations of passive dendritic trees in which the inputs are modeled as current injections. The advantage of adding nonlinearities into dendritic trees is then demonstrated, by analyzing the spatio-temporal integration properties of various nonlinear <b>decision</b> <b>points</b> at the dendritic tree. Distal dendritic <b>decision</b> <b>points</b> are found to be suitable for performing coincidence detection of synaptic events, while proximal and somatic <b>decision</b> <b>points</b> tend to act as integrators of synaptic inputs.

40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if a cognitive task analysis (CTA) could capture steps and <b>decision</b> <b>points</b> that were not articulated during traditional teaching of a colonoscopy. Methods: Three expert colorectal surgeons were videotaped performing a colonoscopy. After the videotapes were transcribed, the experts participated in a CTA. A 26 -step procedural checklist and a 16 -step cognitive demands table was created by using information obtained in the CTA.

40|$|This study {{introduces}} {{the concept of}} computational salience to explain the discriminatory efficacy of <b>decision</b> <b>points,</b> which in turn may have applications to providing real-time assistance to users of navigational aids. This research compared algorithms for calculating the computational salience of <b>decision</b> <b>points</b> and validated the results via three methods: high-salience <b>decision</b> <b>points</b> were used to classify wayfinders; salience scores were used to weight a conditional probabilistic scoring function for real-time wayfinder performance classification; and salience scores were correlated with wayfinding-performance metrics. As an exploratory step to linking computational and cognitive salience, a photograph-recognition experiment was conducted. Results reveal a distinction between algorithms useful for determining computational and cognitive saliences. For computational salience, information about the structural integration of <b>decision</b> <b>points</b> is effective, while information about the probability of decision-point traversal shows promise for determining cognitive salience.

40|$|Background: In spatial navigation, {{landmark}} {{recognition is}} crucial. Specifically, memory for objects placed at <b>decision</b> <b>points</b> on a route is relevant. Previous fMRI research in healthy adults showed higher medial-temporal lobe (MTL) activation for objects placed at <b>decision</b> <b>points</b> compared to non-decision points, even at an implicit level. Since {{there is evidence}} that implicit learning is intact in amnesic patients, the current study examined memory for objects relevant for navigation in patients with Alzheimer’s dementia (AD). Methodology/Principal Findings: 21 AD patients participated with MTL atrophy assessed on MRI (mean MMSE = 21. 2, SD = 4. 0), as well as 20 age- and education-matched non-demented controls. All participants watched a 5 -min video showing a route through a virtual museum with 20 objects placed at intersections (<b>decision</b> <b>points)</b> and 20 at simple turns (non-decision points). The instruction was {{to pay attention to the}} toys (half of the objects) for which they were supposedly tested later. Subsequently, a recognition test followed with the 40 previously presented objects among 40 distracter items (both toys and non-toys). Results showed a better performance for the non-toy objects placed at <b>decision</b> <b>points</b> than nondecision points, both for AD patients and controls. Conclusion/Significance: Our findings indicate that AD patients with MTL damage have implicit memory for object information relevant for navigation.
