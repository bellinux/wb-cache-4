5|$|Ryan {{supports}} a 10-year, $40 billion <b>tax</b> <b>break</b> for the petroleum industry, and has proposed cutting funding {{for renewable energy}} research and subsidies. As a legislative and policy aide to Rep. Sam Brownback of Kansas, Ryan opposed subsidies for ethanol fuel production.|$|E
5|$|Corzine was {{a sponsor}} of the Start Healthy, Stay Healthy Act. He {{supported}} providing a two-year <b>tax</b> <b>break</b> to victims of the September 11, 2001 attacks and help grant citizenship to victims who were legal resident aliens. He supported gun control laws, outlawing racial profiling, and subsidies for Amtrak. He was the chief sponsor, along with U.S. Senator Sam Brownback, of the Darfur Accountability Act. He voted against the Iraq War Resolution. Corzine was the prime sponsor, along with fellow New Jersey U.S. Senator Frank Lautenberg, of a federal version of John's Law, in memory of Navy Ensign John R. Elliott (a native of New Jersey), a U.S. Naval Academy graduate who {{was killed by a}} drunk driver. The legislation provides federal highway safety grant incentives to encourage states to impound the cars of DUI suspects. He was an early contributing blogger at The Huffington Post.|$|E
5|$|With the Canary Islands' {{power grid}} {{substantially}} disrupted, the Unelco-Endesa power company {{was forced to}} use temporary generators to boost power at sub-stations far from the main grid. In La Corujera in Santa Úrsula, these generators were poorly received and over 1,000local residents claimed {{to be affected by}} the noise and pollution. Children, the elderly and people with respiratory problems suffered most acutely. Roughly €25million (US$37.25million) was allocated by the government of the Canary Islands in relief and reconstruction funds. Of this total, €22.5million (US$33.5million) was used to repair infrastructure and utilities; €1.5million (US$2.2million) was used for agricultural relief; and €1million (US$1.5million) was used in home repairs. Due to the severity of crop losses, farmers would be given a grant from the government that would cover 50% of their losses, including infrastructural. A <b>tax</b> <b>break</b> was also given to most residents who suffered damage from Delta.|$|E
2500|$|In September 2008, the Internal Revenue Service {{issued a}} notice {{providing}} <b>tax</b> <b>breaks</b> {{to companies that}} acquire troubled banks. [...] According to analysts, these <b>tax</b> <b>breaks</b> were worth {{billions of dollars to}} Wells Fargo. [...] Vice Chairman Bill Thomas of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission indicated that these <b>tax</b> <b>breaks</b> may have been a factor in Wells Fargo's decision to purchase Wachovia.|$|R
50|$|<b>Tax</b> <b>breaks</b> {{are often}} {{considered}} to be a subsidy. This requires the assumption that a person's or an entity's money belongs to the government. Like other subsidies, they distort the economy; but <b>tax</b> <b>breaks</b> are also less transparent, and are difficult to undo.|$|R
5000|$|Politically {{the issue}} of <b>tax</b> <b>breaks</b> for {{domestic}} help (pigdebatten) has been a divisive one in Swedish politics and society for several years. The new coalition had put forward the idea of introducing such <b>tax</b> <b>breaks,</b> {{and went on to}} do so in 2007.|$|R
5|$|New York {{was unable}} to build on their 1970 success. Tarkenton left the team's 1971 {{training}} camp in a salary dispute, before coming back {{a few days later}} after signing a one-year contract. In place of a salary increase, Tarkenton had asked for a large loan to get a <b>tax</b> <b>break,</b> but the Maras turned it down, and made sure the press knew the raise and loan were denied. Johnson missed most of the season with a knee injury, and the Giants dropped to 4–10. Before the 1972 season they traded Tarkenton, who frequently feuded with Webster, back to the Vikings. Initially the trade produced positive results, as New York rallied to finish 8–6 in 1972. The 1972 team was led by veteran journeyman quarterback Norm Snead (acquired in the trade for Tarkenton), who led the league in passing and had the best season of his career. They set a still-standing team record on November 26 when they scored 62 points via eight touchdowns and two field goals. After the 1972 season however, the Giants suffered one of the worst prolonged stretches in their history. Meanwhile, Tarkenton would lead the Vikings to three Super Bowls and establish a Hall of Fame resume.|$|E
25|$|The {{generalised}} <b>tax</b> <b>break</b> {{was somewhat}} enacted in 2005, and {{included in the}} last Financial Measure. The opposition blamed Berlusconi for doing the <b>tax</b> <b>break</b> {{in one of the}} worst economic periods for the country, with no coverage for the resulting debt, and accused Berlusconi's allies of accepting the <b>tax</b> <b>break</b> in return for better power positions; during the negotiations for the Financial Measure, the National Alliance leader, and, at that date, vice-premier, Gianfranco Fini, was moved to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, and UDC leader Marco Follini, who had no ministerial role before that date, was chosen to replace Fini.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, Staggers {{authored}} legislation {{extending a}} <b>tax</b> <b>break</b> to volunteer firefighters excusing them from tax that are due {{beyond what is}} already withheld from paychecks.|$|E
50|$|Critics {{contend that}} low-income people, {{who are more}} likely to be uninsured, do not earn enough to benefit from the <b>tax</b> <b>breaks</b> offered by HSAs. These <b>tax</b> <b>breaks</b> are too modest, when {{compared}} to the actual cost of insurance, to persuade significant numbers to buy this coverage.|$|R
50|$|House Bill 4544 (“Corporate Responsibility” {{standards}} for state <b>tax</b> <b>breaks</b> & contracts) {{to require a}} firm eligible for obsolete property rehabilitation <b>tax</b> <b>breaks</b> to be {{in compliance with the}} corporate responsibility standards proposed by House Bill 4553. Passed in the House (108 to 0) on March 25, 2010.|$|R

25|$|Real {{estate and}} {{personal}} business property are taxable in Colorado. The state's senior {{property tax exemption}} was temporarily suspended by the Colorado Legislature in 2003. The <b>tax</b> <b>break</b> is scheduled to return for assessment year 2006, payable in 2007.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, Keating {{became the}} first {{governor}} in 50 years to achieve a tax cut in the state’s income tax. This combined with reduction in the sales tax, estate tax, and unemployment tax formed the largest <b>tax</b> <b>break</b> in the state’s history until that point.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, Feeney {{was one of}} {{the lawmakers}} who opposed a demand by Bud Selig that the state finance a new {{baseball}} stadium for the Florida Marlins. At that time, Selig had threatened that the Marlins might leave South Florida if they did not receive a <b>tax</b> <b>break.</b>|$|E
50|$|As mayor, Fischl {{introduced}} {{a series of}} <b>tax</b> <b>breaks</b> for businesses and established tax abatement zones, which were intended to encourage property development. Projects which were developed {{as a result of}} Fischl's <b>tax</b> <b>breaks</b> included the present day Wells Fargo corporate offices (formerly Wachovia) and the downtown Crown Plaza Hotel.|$|R
25|$|Paul {{voted on}} {{multiple}} occasions in 2007—2012 to block measures {{that would have}} eliminated or reduced <b>tax</b> <b>breaks</b> {{for oil and gas}} producers. For example, in January 2007, he voted against the Energy Independence and Security Act, which supporters said would have rescinded $14 billion in <b>tax</b> <b>breaks</b> for oil and gas drillers. In February 2008, he voted against the Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation Tax Act, which supporters said would have eliminated $18 billion in tax benefits for oil companies and substituted tax credits for wind, solar, and other renewable energy sources. In May 2008, he voted against the Energy Improvement and Extension Act, which supporters said contained provisions to cut <b>tax</b> <b>breaks</b> for oil companies and to expand <b>tax</b> <b>breaks</b> for alternative energies like solar and geothermal power, biodiesel fuels, and plug-in hybrid vehicles. In July 2010, he voted against the Consolidated Land, Energy, and Aquatic Resources Act of 2009, which would have removed federal caps on oil companies' liability for oil spills, and would have cut certain <b>tax</b> <b>breaks</b> for oil companies. In February 2011, he voted against a measure to reinstate royalties assessed for oil drilled when oil prices are high. In March, April, and May 2011, he voted against measures that would have allowed consideration of legislation to eliminate <b>tax</b> <b>breaks</b> for oil companies and promote production and use of alternative energy sources.|$|R
5000|$|In 2004, Allen founded Starcast Group, {{which was}} a {{business}} that locates debtors for possession and collection. This group later expanded and now contains twelve different entities. These include an asset location firm, debt collection practice (Signature Recovery), accounting & bookkeeping franchise (<b>Tax</b> <b>Breaks),</b> and an accounting software company (<b>Tax</b> <b>Breaks</b> Professional Software).|$|R
25|$|The {{company has}} {{reported}} annual profits since 2010. It can carry forward previous losses to reduce tax liability on future earnings. It earned $4.7billion in 2010. The Wall Street Journal estimated the <b>tax</b> <b>break,</b> including credits for {{costs related to}} pensions and other expenses can be {{worth as much as}} $45billion over the next 20 years.|$|E
25|$|By {{becoming}} more efficient, the plant saw increasing profits. The workforce increased to 900 by 2004. On April 2, 2004, Governor Ernie Fletcher announced a $40 million <b>tax</b> <b>break</b> {{that would help}} fund a vacuum degassing unit and modification to the slab caster, crucial to coke making and steel options. The modifications also made steel production for automobiles easier.|$|E
25|$|In China the car {{was sold}} as the Chevrolet Lechi. It {{remained}} in production until 2012, when an updated version was introduced as the Baojun Lechi. It is to be offered under both Chevrolet and Baojun brands during a transition period. The Lechi has also received certain powertrain updates, making the car economical enough {{to qualify for a}} subsidy and a <b>tax</b> <b>break</b> from the Chinese government.|$|E
5000|$|In 2007, Dotzler was {{instrumental}} in helping to pass tax incentives aimed at technology companies such as Google and Microsoft to build a facility in Iowa and invest {{millions of dollars in}} the state.

25|$|Before {{winning the}} 2001 general {{election}} and becoming Prime Minister of Italy, Berlusconi signed in a TV show a Contract with Italians, where he promised, if elected, to fulfil {{at least four}} of the five points included in it. One of the main points regarded a <b>tax</b> <b>break</b> for income levels, whereas The Olive Tree policy was essentially to maintain a progressive taxation system.|$|E
25|$|McCain {{would pay}} for {{individual}} tax credits primarily by eliminating the <b>tax</b> <b>break</b> currently offered to employers for providing health insurance to employees. On October 5, 2008, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, McCain's senior policy adviser, said the tax credits would also be funded in part from eliminating Medicare (United States) fraud and by changing Medicare and Medicaid payment policies to lower the overall cost of medical care.|$|E
25|$|As he {{had done}} in first term, Keating sought to grant broad-based tax cuts. To further reduce taxes, Keating won passage of an income <b>tax</b> <b>break</b> and of the {{creation}} of Oklahoma’s earned income credit system to benefit the poor. Also, under Keating’s auspices, both Democratic and Republican leaders in the Legislature launched studies to examine Oklahoma’s tax system, with the purpose of overhauling the entire system. During the study, the complete elimination of Oklahoma’s income tax was proposed.|$|E

5|$|One of Fletcher's {{priorities}} {{that was}} not resolved during the session was the correction of unintended tax increases on businesses that resulted from the tax reform plan passed in 2005. Fletcher called a special legislative session for mid-June so that the legislature could amend the plan and also authorize <b>tax</b> <b>breaks</b> designed to lure a proposed FutureGen power plant to Henderson. Republican Senate President David L. Williams asked Fletcher to include <b>tax</b> <b>breaks</b> for other businesses as well, but Fletcher insisted on a sparse legislative agenda. The session convened for five days and passed the <b>tax</b> <b>breaks</b> and amended <b>tax</b> reform plan unanimously in both houses. Fletcher applauded the legislature's efficiency.|$|R
25|$|A similar {{process had}} taken place with American oil {{companies}} in Venezuela a few years earlier. The American government granted US Aramco member companies a <b>tax</b> <b>break</b> known as the golden gimmick equivalent to the profits given to King Abdulaziz. In {{the wake of the}} new arrangement, the company's headquarters were moved from New York to Dhahran. In 1951, the company discovered the Safaniya Oil Field, the world's largest offshore field. In 1957, the discovery of smaller connected oil fields confirmed the Ghawar Field as the world's largest onshore field.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fall}} of 2002, the {{opposition}} Liberals began a round of attacks on perceived PC mismanagement. First, Jim Flaherty was embroiled in scandal when {{it was revealed that}} his leadership campaign's largest donor had received a highly lucrative contract for slot machines from the government. Then, Tourism Minister Cam Jackson was forced to resign when the Liberals revealed he had charged taxpayers more than $100,000 for hotel rooms, steak dinners and alcoholic beverages. The Liberals showed the Tories had secretly given a large <b>tax</b> <b>break</b> to the Toronto Blue Jays, a team owned by prominent Tory Ted Rogers.|$|E
25|$|Real estate trade groups, in response, {{claim that}} the {{abatement}} program makes it feasible to build residential housing in the first place. John Banks, president of the Real Estate Board of New York, claimed that the high construction costs, expensive land, and tax increases would make construction unfeasible without the <b>tax</b> <b>break.</b> One developer also claimed {{that they would be}} more likely to construct condos instead of rentals without the tax abatement because the differential would make condos comparably more profitable. The developer claimed that affordable rental units would take a hit without the 421-a program.|$|E
5000|$|Cook County Board of Review commissioners {{and their}} staffs {{investigated}} whether Froehlich used any [...] "undue influence" [...] to get <b>tax</b> <b>breaks</b> for businesses in Froehlich's district.

On July 29, 2009, the Board of Review, in a rare move, reversed four of the <b>tax</b> <b>breaks,</b> including the two hotels.
