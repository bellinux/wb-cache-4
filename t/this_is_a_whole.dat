For example, the kana [...] き ki is used for elements based on the kanji 木, which has ki {{as one of its}} basic pronunciations. The two upper dots are then used to indicate whether <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> character, 木, or an element of a compound character. For a whole character, both upper dots are added, for [...] 木 ki. For a partial character, one upper dot is used: The left upper dot alone indicates the first (left, top, or outside) constituent part of a kanji, as in [...] 村, and the right upper dot alone signals the final (right, bottom, or inside) constituent part of a kanji, as in [...] 林. For those kanji where an element is repeated more than once, a suffix corresponding derived from the braille digit plus a right upper dot indicates the number of times an element occurs, as in [...] = 森.|$|E

[...] <b>As</b> plans <b>were</b> being finalized, Jefferson Airplane were on the road, and by early December they were in Florida, believing the concert plans for Golden Gate Park were proceeding. But by December 4, the plans had broken down, in Paul Kantner's account, because the city and police departments were unhelpful; innate conflict between the hippies of Haight-Ashbury and the police was manifested in obstructiveness. Sears Point Raceway was suggested, but its owners wanted $100,000 in escrow from the Rolling Stones. At the last moment, Dick Carter offered his Altamont Speedway in Alameda County for the festival. Jefferson Airplane flew out of Miami on December 5. Kantner said the location <b>was</b> taken in <b>a</b> spirit of desperation: [...] "There {{was no way to}} control it, no supervision or order."
