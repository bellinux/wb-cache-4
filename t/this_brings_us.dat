25|$|<b>This</b> <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> back to Wittgenstein's {{reliance}} on indirect communication, and his {{reliance on}} thought-experiments. Some philosophical confusions come about because we aren't {{able to see}} family resemblances. We've {{made a mistake in}} understanding the vague and intuitive rules that language uses, and have thereby tied ourselves up in philosophical knots. He suggests that an attempt to untangle these knots requires more than simple deductive arguments pointing out the problems with some particular position. Instead, Wittgenstein's larger goal is to try to divert us from our philosophical problems long enough to become aware of our intuitive ability to see the family resemblances.|$|E

60|$|<b>This</b> <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> to {{our third}} question: Is the system which Communists regard as their goal {{likely to result}} from the {{adoption}} of their methods? This is really the most vital question of the three.|$|E
60|$|<b>This</b> <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> to an {{afternoon}} when the Gardens were white with snow, {{and there was}} ice on the Round Pond, not thick enough to skate on {{but at least you}} could spoil it for to-morrow by flinging stones, and many bright little boys and girls were doing that.|$|E

60|$|My inn {{had once}} been a part of an ancient ecclesiastical house, and I dined in a little {{octagonal}} common-room, like a font. As I was not able to cut my dinner, the old landlord with a shining bald head did it for me. <b>This</b> <b>bringing</b> <b>us</b> into conversation, he was so good as to entertain me with my own story,--of course with the popular feature that Pumblechook was my earliest benefactor and the founder of my fortunes.|$|R

60|$|And <b>this</b> <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> to a point. Some of {{the master}} minds before mentioned, having {{conceived}} the idea that telegraphic communication might be carried on under water, set about experimenting. Between the years 1839 and 1851 enterprising men in the Old World and the New suggested, pondered, planned, and placed wires under water, along which our Spark ran more or less successfully.|$|E
60|$|<b>This</b> <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> to {{a second}} {{characteristic}} of philosophical propositions, namely, {{that they must be}} a priori. A philosophical proposition must be such as can be neither proved nor disproved by empirical evidence. Too often we find in philosophical books arguments based upon the course of history, or the convolutions of the brain, or the eyes of shell-fish. Special and accidental facts of this kind are irrelevant to philosophy, which must make only such assertions as would be equally true however the actual world were constituted.|$|E
60|$|In {{these three}} voyages the evident {{purpose is to}} strip off the veil of habit and custom, with which men deceive themselves, and show the crude vices of {{humanity}} as Swift fancies he sees them. In the fourth voyage the merciless satire is carried out to its logical conclusion. <b>This</b> <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> {{to the land of}} the Houyhnhnms, in which horses, superior and intelligent creatures, are the ruling animals. All our interest, however, is centered on the Yahoos, a frightful race, having the form and appearance of men, but living in unspeakable degradation.|$|E
60|$|First.--Cadell's plans {{seem to have}} succeeded, and he augurs well as to {{the next}} two years, {{reckoning}} £30,000 on the stuff now on hand, and £20,000 on the insurance money, and £10,000 to be borrowed somehow. <b>This</b> will <b>bring</b> <b>us</b> wonderfully home.|$|R

50|$|A {{prediction}} for {{the possible}} range, following an optimum trajectory, {{has been given}} at 6700 km or as much as 10,400 km not {{taking into account the}} Earth’s rotation.

6000|$|... "I {{would not}} sell them for any price," [...] I said. [...] "My {{idea is to}} invest all the balance--except enough to {{purchase}} seed and feed us during winter if the crop fails--in cattle, buying a new mower, and hiring again to cut hay. It's locked-up money, but the profit should provide a handsome interest, and there's talk of a new creamery at Carrington, which promises a good market for milk. <b>This</b> <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> {{back to the old}} familiar position. We shall be prosperous men if all goes well, with just enough to pay our debts if it doesn't." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>This</b> <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> to Holbach's {{treatment}} of Morals. The moment {{had come to}} France, which was reached at an earlier period in English speculation, when the negative course of thought in metaphysics drove men to consider the basis of ethics. How were right and wrong to hold their own against the new mechanical conception of the Universe? The same question is again urgent in men's minds, because the Darwinian hypothesis, and the mass of evidence for it, have again given a tremendous shake to theological conceptions, and startled men into {{a sense of the}} precariousness of the official foundations of virtue and duty.|$|E
60|$|<b>This</b> <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> to {{the point}} of the matter. For if you compare the prodigious diversities in {{education}} and manner of life which reign in the different orders of the civil condition, with the simplicity and uniformity of the savage and animal life, where all find nourishment in the same articles of food, live in the same way, and do exactly the same things, you will easily understand to what degree the difference between man and man must be less in the state of nature than in that of society.[185] Physical inequality is hardly perceived in the state of nature, and its indirect influences there are almost non-existent.|$|E

3000|$|Interview quotation: We {{need to have}} an {{alternative}} resource to do practice on the laws of the football game, because, we have to study the rules by using only the LOG book and this book is not an interesting tool for education. <b>This</b> game <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> an innovation to study the rules.|$|R
6000|$|But <b>this</b> <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> to {{our other}} question, namely, how is our {{principle}} {{known to be}} true? Obviously, since it is required to justify induction, it cannot be proved by induction; since it goes beyond the empirical data, it cannot be proved by them alone; since it is required to justify all inferences from empirical data to what goes beyond them, it cannot itself be even rendered in any degree probable by such data. Hence, if it is known, {{it is not known}} by experience, but independently of experience. I do not say that any such principle is known: I only say that it is required to justify the inferences from experience which empiricists allow, and that it cannot itself be justified empirically.[11] ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{belief that}} the sun will rise to-morrow might be falsified if the earth came {{suddenly}} into contact with a large body which destroyed its rotation; but the laws of motion and the law of gravitation would not be infringed by such an event. The business of science is to find uniformities, such as the laws of motion and the law of gravitation, to which, so far as our experience extends, there are no exceptions. In this search science has been remarkably successful, {{and it may be}} conceded that such uniformities have held hitherto. <b>This</b> <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> back to the question: Have we any reason, assuming that they have always held in the past, to suppose that they will hold in the future? ...|$|E
60|$|A {{very common}} causal group {{consists}} of volitions {{and the consequent}} bodily acts, though exceptions arise (for example) through sudden paralysis. Another very frequent connection (though here the exceptions are much more numerous) is between a bodily act and the realisation of the purpose {{which led to the}} act. These connections are patent, whereas the causes of desires are more obscure. Thus it is natural to begin causal series with desires, to suppose that all causes are analogous to desires, and that desires themselves arise spontaneously. Such a view, however, is not one which any serious psychologist would maintain. But <b>this</b> <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> {{to the question of the}} application of our analysis of cause to the problem of free will.|$|E

50|$|In England, Henry VIII of England {{declared}} {{himself to be}} supreme head of the Church of England with the Act of Supremacy in 1531, repressing both Lutheran reformers and those loyal to the pope. Thomas Cranmer as Archbishop of Canterbury introduced the English Reformation in a form compromising between the Calvinists and Lutherans. <b>This</b> schism <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> today's Anglican Communion.|$|R
60|$|This {{being the}} Case, it follows {{of course that}} the general Mischiefs of Mankind, as well {{national}} and public, as family Mischiefs, and even personal, (except as before excepted) lie all still at the Devil's Door, as much as ever, let his Advocates bring him off of it if they can; and <b>this</b> <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> back again to {{the manner of the}} Devil's Management, and the Way of his working by human Agents, or if you will, the Way of human Devils, working in Affairs of low Life, such as we call Divination, Sorcery, Black-Art, Necromancy, and the like; all which I take to consist of two material Parts, and both very necessary for us to be rightly inform'd of.|$|E
60|$|And <b>this</b> <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> to {{the period}} at which we may resume our story. One word we must say as to Caroline. During the winter she had seen her lover repeatedly, and had written to him repeatedly. Their engagement, therefore, had by no means been broken. But their {{meetings}} were cold, and their letters equally so. She would have married him at once now if he would ask her. But he would not ask her. He was quite willing to marry her if she would herself {{say that she was}} willing so far to recede from her former resolution. But she could not bring herself to do this. Each was too proud to make the first concession to the other, and therefore no concession was made by either.|$|E
6000|$|Rule I.--It is {{not good}} form to climb onto the table. There is no doubt a great temptation to this. When you are {{struggling}} with a duck, and he wobbles over just as {{you think you have}} him, you forget yourself. The common plan is not to leap upon the table all at once. This is the more usual process: The carver begins to carve sitting. By-and-by he is on his feet, and his brow is contracted. His face approaches the fowl, {{as if he wanted to}} inquire within about everything except that the duck is reluctant to yield any of its portions. One of his feet climbs onto his chair, then the other. His knees are now resting against the table, and, in his excitement, he, so to speak, flings himself upon the fowl. <b>This</b> <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> to ...|$|E
50|$|The final {{story in}} <b>this</b> miniseries <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> to Northern Ireland. Liam, a mutant {{with the ability}} to blow things up, is dragged unwillingly into the turmoil and {{terrorism}} that has disturbed Northern Ireland for many years. Unwilling, Liam resists with all his might, disgusted and loathing of the terrorists who simply want to use his mutant powers to better their own position.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the main}} stated {{objectives}} of the Favela Bairro program was to allow squatter settlements {{to become part of}} the formal city. The focus of the study is to assess how different project solutions in the Favela Bairro program have used urban design tools to achieve this objective. A subsequent question concerns the extent to which urban design factors helped to improve the social integration of the settlements, and specifically to overcome poverty and exclusion conditions. <b>This</b> <b>bring</b> <b>us</b> to a another group of problems related to indicators to measure the attainment of these objectives from four perspectives: Spatial, Social, Economical and Political (citizenship and participation) This analysis highlights the major difficulties confronted by the design teams, and allows pinpointing the positive and negative impacts of the interventions on the communities and the cit...|$|R
