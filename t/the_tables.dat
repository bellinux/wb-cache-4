5|$|Bottom time is {{the time}} spent at depth before {{starting}} the ascent. Bottom time used for decompression planning may be defined differently depending on <b>the</b> <b>tables</b> or algorithm used. It may include descent time, but not in all cases. It is important to check how bottom time is defined for <b>the</b> <b>tables</b> before they are used. For example, tables using Bühlmann's algorithm define bottom time as the elapsed time between leaving the surface {{and the start of}} the final ascent at 10 metres per minute, and if the ascent rate is slower, then the whole of the ascent time needs to be considered part of the bottom time for the algorithm to remain safe.|$|E

5000|$|Each end of <b>the</b> <b>table</b> {{is divided}} into three scoring {{sections}} by straight lines across the width of <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> <b>The</b> scoring sections extend from the very edge of either end of <b>the</b> <b>table</b> towards <b>the</b> middle of <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> covering approximately one-third of the length of <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> <b>The</b> outer scoring section, at the end of <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> is labeled with the number [...] "3" [...] in the middle (for [...] "3 points"). The next section is adjacent to this section, of equal length (6 inches), and is labeled with a [...] "2." [...] The final section, [...] "1", is adjacent to section [...] "2." [...] This section continues {{all the way to the}} foul line. The foul line measures 6 feet from the end of <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> <b>The</b> center third of <b>the</b> <b>table</b> is unmarked. <b>The</b> line that separates the center third of <b>the</b> <b>table</b> and <b>the</b> beginning of the [...] "1 point" [...] section is called the [...] "foul line" [...] (a weight which does not pass the foul line closest to the player is removed from <b>the</b> <b>table</b> for <b>the</b> round). <b>The</b> <b>table</b> is surrounded by a gutter, or [...] "alley"; pucks that accidentally fall, or are knocked, into a gutter are out of play for the rest of the round.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>table</b> top and rim clamps {{hold and}} rotate {{the wheel to}} mount or {{dismount}} a tire. <b>The</b> <b>table</b> top is directly above the foot pedals and below the mount/demount mechanism. <b>The</b> <b>table</b> top is able to rotate clockwise and counter clockwise. <b>The</b> <b>table</b> top is shaped as the letter [...] "X", {{but it can be}} a circle in different tire changer models. On each end of <b>the</b> <b>table</b> top, there are pneumatic-powered rim clamps. These rim clamps move in unison to secure wheels onto <b>the</b> <b>table</b> top. Each rim clamp can be adjusted closer or further away from the center of <b>the</b> <b>table</b> top to accommodate smaller or larger wheels.|$|R

5000|$|Palladino {{normally}} {{refused to}} allow someone beneath <b>the</b> <b>table</b> to hold her feet with his hands. She refused to levitate <b>the</b> <b>table</b> from a standing position. <b>The</b> <b>table</b> being rectangular, she had to sit only at a short side. No wall of any kind could stand between Palladino and <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> <b>The</b> weight of <b>the</b> <b>table</b> was seventeen pounds. <b>The</b> <b>table</b> levitated to a height of 3 to 10 inches for a maximum of 2-3 seconds. She was an expert at freeing a hand or foot to produce phenomena. She chose {{to sit at the}} short side of <b>the</b> <b>table</b> so that her controllers on each side had to sit closer together, making it easier to deceive them. Her levitation of a table began by freeing one foot, rocking <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> and then slipping her toe under one leg. Since she sat at the narrow end of <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> this was made possible. She lifted <b>the</b> <b>table</b> by rocking back on the heel of this foot.

50|$|In this game, {{each player}} is dealt three cards, and five are dealt to <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> Players may trail or take cards from <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> {{if they have}} cards which match the cards on <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> or if they have two cards which {{add up to a}} card on <b>the</b> <b>table</b> and equal <b>the</b> <b>table</b> card's value.

5000|$|A turn {{begins with}} a player {{attempting}} to match one of the cards lying face-up on <b>the</b> <b>table</b> with a card of the same month in their hand.

5000|$|In one-on-one, {{each player}} is {{assigned}} a color of puck (4 pucks per player).

Each player tries to either land his puck closest to the end of <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> knock <b>the</b> opponent's pucks off <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> knock their own puck into a higher scoring area, or position a puck so that it will block their opponent from being able to hit another puck off <b>the</b> <b>table.</b>|$|R
60|$|It {{was very}} simple.

50|$|The {{tire changer}} has two foot pedals. The left pedal {{is called the}} clamp control pedal, a three {{position}} pedal that opens and closes the rim clamps. Once pressed, pneumatic pistons move the 4 rim clamps together or apart simultaneously. The right pedal is <b>the</b> <b>table</b> top pedal, which is a three position pedal that controls the rotation of <b>the</b> <b>table</b> top. When <b>the</b> <b>table</b> top pedal is pressed down, <b>the</b> <b>table</b> top spins clockwise. <b>The</b> <b>table</b> top spins counter clockwise when the pedal is raised.|$|R
