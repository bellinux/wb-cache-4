40|$|In this paper, {{we use a}} three flavor non-local Nambu [...] Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model, an~improved {{effective}} {{model of}} Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) at low energies, to investigate the existence of deconfined quarks in <b>the</b> <b>cores</b> <b>of</b> neutron stars. Particular emphasis is put on the possible existence of quark matter in <b>the</b> <b>cores</b> <b>of</b> rotating neutron stars (pulsars). In contrast to non-rotating neutron stars, whose particle compositions do not change with time (are frozen in), the type {{and structure of the}} matter in <b>the</b> <b>cores</b> <b>of</b> rotating neutron stars depends on the spin frequencies of these stars, which opens up a possible new window on the nature of matter deep in <b>the</b> <b>cores</b> <b>of</b> neutron stars. Our study shows that, depending on mass and rotational frequency, up to around 8 % of the mass of a massive neutron star may be in the mixed quark-hadron phase, if the phase transition is treated as a Gibbs transition. We also find that the gravitational mass at which quark deconfinement occurs in rotating neutron stars varies quadratically with spin frequency, which can be fitted by a simple formula.

To first approximation, these low-pressure regions form with little exchange of heat with the neighboring regions (i.e., adiabatically), so the local temperature in the low-pressure regions drops, too.
