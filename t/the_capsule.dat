5|$|After {{a poignant}} attempt at radio {{communication}} with a fisherman on Earth who speaks only Eskimo–Aleut, Stone resigns herself to being stranded and shuts down the cabin's oxygen supply to commit suicide.

5|$|The pseudo-tracking shot {{in which}} the camera appears to {{approach}} the Man in the Moon was accomplished using an effect Méliès had invented the previous year for the film The Man with the Rubber Head. Rather than attempting to move his weighty camera toward an actor, he set a pulley-operated chair upon a rail-fitted ramp, placed the actor (covered up to the neck in black velvet) on the chair, and pulled him toward the camera. In addition to its technical practicality, this technique also allowed Méliès to control {{the placement of the}} face within the frame to a much greater degree of specificity than moving his camera allowed. A substitution splice allowed a model capsule to suddenly appear {{in the eye of the}} actor playing the Moon, completing the shot. Another notable sequence in the film, the plunge of <b>the</b> <b>capsule</b> into real ocean waves filmed on location, was created through multiple exposure, with a shot of <b>the</b> <b>capsule</b> falling in front of a black background superimposed upon the footage of the ocean. The shot is followed by an underwater glimpse of <b>the</b> <b>capsule</b> floating back to the surface, created by combining a moving cardboard cutout of <b>the</b> <b>capsule</b> with an aquarium containing tadpoles and air jets. The descent of the rocket from the Moon was covered in four shots, taking up about twenty seconds of film time.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{behavior}} of an elastic capsule by an optical force {{in a uniform}} flow is examined by using the penalty immersed boundary method. <b>The</b> elastic <b>capsule</b> is subjected to the laser beam with Gaussian distribution in the perpendicular direction to the fluid flow. <b>The</b> elastic <b>capsule</b> migrated by <b>the</b> optical force along {{the direction of the}} laser beam propagation, and the migration distance is dependent on its properties. <b>The</b> oblate <b>capsule</b> with b/a = 0. 5 obeying the neo-Hookean constitutive law is first considered, and the effects of the surface Young's modulus and the initial inclination angle on the migration distance are studied. The migration distance of <b>the</b> oblate <b>capsule</b> is increased as the surface Young's modulus increases, and <b>the</b> non-inclined oblate <b>capsule</b> is more migrated than <b>the</b> differently inclined <b>capsules.</b> Then <b>the</b> spherical, oblate, and biconcave <b>capsules</b> obeying <b>the</b> Skalak constitutive law are considered.

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to produce encapsulated protein hydrolysates from Whitemouth croaker (Micropogonias furnieri) muscle and its industrialization byproduct. The protein hydrolysates were prepared from the muscle (MPH) and byproduct (BPH) from croaker by enzymatic hydrolysis using Flavourzyme®. The hydrolysates were encapsulated using phosphatidylcholine as the wall material of <b>the</b> <b>capsules.</b> <b>The</b> <b>capsules</b> were evaluated for particle size, polydispersity, encapsulation efficiency, zeta potential, morphology, thermal properties, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and antioxidant activity. The average size of <b>the</b> <b>capsules</b> for both MPH and BPH liposomes range between 266 and 263  nm with low polydispersity. <b>The</b> <b>capsules</b> showed high encapsulation efficiency of around 80 %. The FTIR analysis allowed suggesting that there was an effective ionic complexation between phosphatidylcholine and hydrolysate peptides.

40|$|We {{have studied}} the pH-and salt-mediated {{response}} of matrix-type polyelectrolyte microcapsules. <b>The</b> <b>capsules</b> were prepared by layer-by-layer (LbL) adsorption on decomposable CaCO 3 cores using model polyelectrolytes, namely poly-styrenesulfonic acid (PSS) and poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH). Salt-mediated LbL-made microcapsule fusion has been reported recently with a different polycation (R. Zhang, O. Kreft, A. Skirtach, H. Mohwald and G. Sukhorukov, Soft Matter, 2010, 6, 4742 - 4747) resulting in merging of <b>the</b> <b>capsule's</b> content and formation of anisotropic "Janus-like'' capsules indicating no polymer exchange between <b>the</b> <b>capsules.</b> Here we have studied PAH/PSS capsule behavior {{as a function of}} pH and salt concentration. Salt (NaCl) does not induce any changes in <b>the</b> <b>capsules</b> up to saturation concentration (6. 1 M). In contrast, several sequential processes have been identified for capsules in [HCl] > 0. 1 M: (i) shrinkage due to polymer network annealing, (ii) transformation from matrix-type to shell-type capsules due to oscillating inflating-deflating cycles caused by CO 2 formation, and (iii) collapse. The processes depend on acid concentration and the number of layers. If <b>the</b> <b>capsules</b> contact each other, there is an exchange of polymer molecules followed by fusion. The polymer exchange depends on the outermost layer that determines <b>the</b> overall <b>capsule</b> charge. Exchange is enhanced for <b>capsules</b> of <b>the</b> same outermost layer and can be caused by charge redistribution in <b>the</b> <b>capsules</b> at low pH (the negative charge of PSS is reduced (pK(a) 1) and the positive charge of PAH is in excess). Control over polymer exchange between <b>the</b> <b>capsules</b> is key in order to design capsules as well as to understand and to trigger fusion. We also show that the observed processes are not reversible and can be stopped at any time by replacement of acid with water. Stable gas-filled capsules can be produced by this method upon transformation from matrix to shell-type capsules...|$|R
