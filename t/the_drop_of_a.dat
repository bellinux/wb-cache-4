25|$|As a {{young man}} Flanders seemed to be heading for a {{successful}} acting career. He contracted polio in 1943 while serving in the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve {{and for the rest}} of his life was reliant on a wheelchair. He made a career as a prolific broadcaster on radio and later television, and together with his old schoolfriend, the composer Donald Swann, he wrote successful songs in the late 1940s and early and mid-1950s for revues in the West End of London. In 1956 they themselves performed some of these songs, along with new songs, in a two-man revue, At <b>the</b> <b>Drop</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Hat. This show, and its successor, At the Drop of Another Hat, ran with occasional short breaks from 1956 to 1967 and played in theatres throughout the British Isles, the US, Australia and elsewhere.|$|E
500|$|As a producer, Martin {{recorded}} the two-man show featuring Michael Flanders and Donald Swann, At <b>the</b> <b>Drop</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Hat, which sold steadily for twenty-five years, although Martin's breakthrough {{as a producer}} came with the Beyond the Fringe show cast album, which starred Peter Cook, Dudley Moore, Alan Bennett, and Jonathan Miller, and he would also produce the accompanying soundtrack album for David Frost's satirical BBC TV show That Was the Week That Was in 1963. Martin's work transformed the profile of Parlophone from a [...] "sad little company" [...] to a very profitable business.|$|E

Usually deployed on the right wing, Robben often cuts inside on his left foot to move to a more central attacking position, and uses his speed and dribbling skills to take on defenders until he finds the space to make an attempt on goal.|$|E

500|$|Carey {{confessed that}} she never tried to change the {{situation}} because [...] " [...] used to be insecure and cautious, and so [...] would {{listen to what the}} people said." [...] However, the control Mottola exerted over her career soon [...] "spilled into her personal life" [...] once they were married, increasing the amount of conflict between the two. Soon, it was obvious that their marriage was in shambles; as stated in a Vanity Fair article, [...] "the couple began to argue at <b>the</b> <b>drop</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hat." [...] Carey was very involved in the project, more so than she had ever been on an album. [...] "I went into this phase of recording, recording, recording and doing it really fast," [...] she told Time. [...] "This time, I had more time, and I focused more on what I wanted to do." [...] As Carey's career and work continued to reflect her views on how it should sound, her marriage to Mottola continued to [...] "deteriorate".|$|E
500|$|We met land crabs, too, {{and were}} sadly disappointed. They were small, {{no larger than}} an {{ordinary}} edible crab, with bloated shells and moderately long pincers. Some were of beetroot purple, others yellow or orange, apparently two colour-phases of the same species. They were shy, freezing with pincers erect when alarmed, usually to be found within a short distance of their burrows and ready to scuttle down at <b>the</b> <b>drop</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hat. In rainy weather they promenaded more freely, sometimes appearing {{at the side of}} road with arms waving like diminutive but aggressive hitch-hikers. Fringed mandibles [...] suggest a permanently turned-down mouth, giving them a disgruntled, unhappy expression; they were disagreeable rather than sinister and fell far short of their reputation. The first land crab I met was sitting in a prickly pear bush, sadly munching one of the brilliant red fruits and dribbling juice. I could never take them seriously after that.|$|E
500|$|IndieWire's Ben Travers praised Legion as [...] "the most intricate, {{intimate}} superhero {{story to}} date", highlighting {{its focus on}} [...] "an emotional journey for our leading lad", the central love story that turns the show [...] "from a 12 Monkeys mind-fuck to a Romeo & Juliet romance at <b>the</b> <b>drop</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hat", and its cast. At Variety, Maureen Ryan stated that Stevens' performance [...] "is the glue that keeps Legion from flying apart", {{and the relationship between}} Haller and Barrett provides [...] "moments of solace in a viewing experience that can otherwise be exceptionally intense." [...] After the first three episodes, Ryan said that [...] "the challenge of Legion will be to make David’s quest for wholeness {{more than the sum of}} its flashy and often captivating parts. But the humane core of the drama offers a reason to hope for the best." [...] Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter said, [...] "It might seem weird to have a Marvel show on FX, or to have it star that upper-crust Brit from Downton Abbey, filtered through the creator of Fargo, but somehow it all works." [...] He praised Stevens performance, and Hawley's [...] "optical hijinks" [...] even after the first episode, where the story starts to become more clear.|$|E

500|$|Referring to Columbia, Carey {{said in an}} {{interview}} [...] "That company, made a billion dollars from the raggedy girl he met at that party." [...] Throughout the marriage, Mottola, both Carey's husband and boss, carefully manipulated and controlled her career, crafting her into the adult contemporary/pop singer he sought her to be. With each album, Carey's genre influences and production styles evolved, leading her farther into R and hip-hop territory. By 1994, Carey was already the best-selling artist of the 1990s, and the labels best-selling act. Due to her continued success, Carey was able to take more creative control over subsequent projects. During the recording sessions for her fifth album Daydream (1995), the couple had already begun [...] "fighting at <b>the</b> <b>drop</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> feather", due to his controlling nature over their personal life and her career. They separated in 1997, and divorced the following year. Carey described her sixth album Butterfly (1997) as her magnum opus, and her greatest and most personal work, due to its personal and emotional background. On the album's title track– written by Carey for Mottola– Carey reached out to him, asking to allow her to be free like a 'butterfly', and if the two were 'meant to be', then the butterfly 'would return'. In {{an interview}} with Interview magazine, Carey described the importance the song held for her, as well as its meaning: ...|$|E
500|$|During {{the casting}} process, Keamy was {{described}} as a military type in his late-twenties who does not question orders. [...] Chris Carabott of IGN wrote that [...] "in a show that features characters fraught with uncertainty, Keamy is the polar opposite and his Marine mentality definitely sets him apart. [...] His team has a physical advantage {{and with the help of}} Mr. Widmore, they have a tactical advantage as well. [...] Keamy is like a bulldog being thrown into a cage full of kittens (except for [...] Sayid)". [...] Jay Glatfelter of The Huffington Post, stated that [...] "Keamy is Crazy! … out of all the bad guys on the Island—past, present, and future—Keamy has to be one of the most dangerous ones. [...] Not because of how big he is, or the weaponry, but his willingness to kill at <b>the</b> <b>drop</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hat. [...] That doesn't bode well for our Losties [...]" [...] Co-show runner/executive producer/writer Carlton Cuse has stated that he and the other writers create [...] "complex" [...] characters because they [...] "are interested in exploring how good and evil can be embodied in the same characters and [...] the struggles we all have to overcome the dark parts of our souls"; however, he later clarified that there is an exception: [...] "Keamy's bad, he knows he's bad, but he's ... a guy that does the job." [...] Damon Lindelof stated that [...] "the great thing about Keamy is that he is like a ... merciless survivor. [...] 's this great moment [...] where he just sort of hackie-sacks [...] over to where [...] Omar is standing. [...] Omar is certainly an acceptable casualty as far as Keamy is concerned." [...] According to a featurette in the Lost: The Complete Fourth Season – The Expanded Experience DVD set, Keamy likes [...] "heavy weaponry" [...] and [...] "physical fitness" [...] and dislikes [...] "negotiations" [...] and [...] "doctors".|$|E

2500|$|François Couture at AllMusic called Trondheim the [...] "crown jewel" [...] {{of the box}} set, {{saying it}} was [...] "some of [...] darkest and most thrilling music". John Kelman at All About Jazz {{described}} Trondheim as [...] "about as unapproachable as Henry Cow ever got, and yet amongst the densities and at times harsh realms are moments of profound beauty. The 80-minute improvisation ... demonstrates the kind of intuitive push-and-pull that could only come from musicians not just spending {{a great deal of}} time playing together, but also living together, with a potent ability to sometimes shift ambience and color at <b>the</b> <b>drop</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> dime." ...|$|E
2500|$|The opera also {{includes}} and parodies elements of melodrama, popular at the Adelphi Theatre.

[...] But Gilbert, in his customary topsy-turvy fashion, turns the moral absolutes of melodrama upside down: The hero becomes evil, the villain becomes good, and the virtuous maiden changes fiancés at <b>the</b> <b>drop</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hat. [...] The ghosts come back to life, foiling the curse, and all ends happily.|$|E
