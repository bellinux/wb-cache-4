25|$|In 1995 Morgan built a Mine <b>Train</b> <b>type</b> {{ride for}} Michael Bonfante {{for what was}} then called Hecker Pass — A Family Adventure in Gilroy, California. The coaster, Quicksilver Express, was {{manufactured}} in 1995 but sat at the Morgan Manufacturing facility for five years before it was finally installed in 2000. Bonfante Gardens {{opened to the public}} a year later in 2001. In 1995, Richard Kinzel of Cedar Fair asked Morgan to build a 200-foot hypercoaster for Valleyfair in Minnesota. Utilizing designer Steve Okamoto, whom he had worked with at Arrow Dynamics, Morgan opened Wild Thing in 1996. Morgan went on to build seven more steel coasters, including two more for Cedar Fair. D. H. Morgan Manufacturing also redesigned the former Arrow Coaster Steel Phantom at Kennywood Park in Pennsylvania.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} an alternative training approach that would improve transfer performance scores above traditional training approaches. Specifically, error-management training was proposed to help trainees learn complex tasks, {{as opposed to}} error-avoidant training approaches, which sought to give trainees step-by-step protocols for learning that would minimize the occurrence of errors during training. This {{study was designed to}} examine the effects of <b>training</b> <b>type</b> on transfer performance and transfer errors, as well as the effects of meta-cognition, emotion control and cognitive appraisals as mediators of the training type-performance relationship. A third issue of this {{study investigated}} the personality-training type interactions from a situation strength perspective. Participants (N = 181) from a Midwestern university completed four training trials and two transfer trials of a computerized version of a class scheduling task and completed surveys of relevant constructs. Results revealed that <b>training</b> <b>type</b> did not have an effect on transfer performance or errors, <b>training</b> <b>type</b> did not predict meta-cognition, emotion control and challenge appraisals, but did predict threat appraisals. Finally, personality did not have a main effect on performance, nor did it interact with <b>training</b> <b>type.</b> The relative contributions of this study was the effects of <b>training</b> <b>type</b> on cognitive appraisals (threat in particular) and its relevance for future theoretical frameworks of error management training research, the effects of <b>training</b> <b>type</b> on error attitudes and error attitude effects on performance. Previous operationializations of error management training also may not be as clear-cut as once thought...|$|R

2500|$|The {{target speed}} and {{location}} {{are used to}} display the target speed and distance to the driver.

If the train is approaching a red signal or the beginning of an occupied block the location will match the location of the signal or block boundary. The on-board equipment will calculate the permitted speed at any point so that the train, decelerating at the deceleration indicated by its braking curve, will stop by the stopping point.|$|E

2500|$|A major {{rebuilding}} {{of the main}} line from Wembley Park to Amersham was planned in the 1930s but delayed by the war. The line from Wembley to Harrow was rebuilt immediately {{after the war and}} the project was completed from 1956–1962, on a more modest scale than originally planned. Until 1961, passenger trains continued to be attached to a steam locomotive at [...] to run to Aylesbury. The rebuilding electrified the line from Rickmansworth to Amersham, transferring all Aylesbury services to British Railways. A pair of fast lines was added from Harrow to north of Moor Park by 1962, allowing outer-suburban trains to run fast to Moor Park. Aluminium A stock, originally unpainted, replaced the T stock and locomotive-hauled trains. More A Stock trains were built in 1962–63 to replace the trains on the Uxbridge service, giving the main line a single <b>train</b> <b>type</b> for all services. A Stock was 4-car units that could operate as four- or eight-car trains; normally operated as eight cars, a 4-car unit operated the Chesham shuttle. One person operation of the trains was proposed in 1972, but due to conflict with the trades unions was not introduced on the line until 1986.|$|E
