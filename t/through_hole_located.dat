40|$|Mr. Hays deserves {{commendation}} for {{an important}} con-tribution to the literature.

40|$|The {{oncoming}} of a {{new generation}} of subsonic transport aircraft (with supercritical wing and high by-pass ratio turbofans) led to an experimental study of wing nacelle jet pylon interference in transonic flow. To this end, a test set-up was developed at the ONERA S 3 Ch wind tunnel. The nacelle models represent a turbofan by means of two compressed air jets. The scale is 1 / 18. 5. The nacelles are fixed on a thrust balance measuring afterbody thrust and discharge coefficients. The wing is located between the sidewalls of the test section. Pressures are measured <b>through</b> 456 <b>holes</b> <b>located</b> on 8 airfoils. Drag coefficient of the wing is obtained by wake survey. The following parameters can vary (1) wing/nacelle position; (2) upstream Mach number (from 0. 3 to 0. 8); (3) jet pressure ratio; (4) with/without pylon and (5) type of nacelle. Wing nacelle interference can be studied by means of total thrust drag analysis as a functon of the various parameters. The test set-up is described and examples of results are presented...|$|R

25|$|The design {{came from}} Pininfarina. The design team at Pininfarina {{consisted}} of Ian Cameron, Guido Campoli, Diego Ottina and Emanuele Nicosia. With little surprise, they {{were led by}} design chief Leonardo Fioravanti, the designer of many contemporary Ferraris. The design was originated by Nicosia, but the guidance of Fioravanti was equally important. Being a trained aerodynamist, Fioravanti applied his know-how to set the aerodynamics layout of the car. This meant the large side intakes were not only a statement of style but actually functional – they drew clean air to cool the side radiators and then went upward and left the car <b>through</b> the ventilation <b>holes</b> <b>located</b> at the engine lid and the tail. As a result, the Testarossa did not need a rear spoiler like Lamborghini's Countach yet produced zero lift at its rear axle. The aerodynamic drag coefficient of 0.36 was also significantly better than the Lamborghini's 0.42.|$|R

In Germany, Raeder and his staff felt unable to issue Lütjens with any orders since they had no information {{on the state of the}} task force.Meanwhile, Lütjens took stock of his predicament. Firstly, he believed that he was shadowed by a force of ships with superior radar. Secondly, the element of surprise had been lost. Thirdly, the battleship was running low of fuel; his decision not to refuel in Norway or the Norwegian Sea now became relevant. Fourthly, he thought the force was led by the efficient battleship , which he thought was leading him into a trap with an enemy fleet alerted to Hoods fate. Fifthly, sea water had slowed him by two knots. His ship had lost some electrical power and salt water was threatening to enter fuel lines and shut down two boilers. Lindemann argued for a return via the Denmark Strait to Norway. In his view the ship was too fine a vessel to be risked in another unequal struggle. Lütjens rejected his suggestion. It would take him too close to the British Isles and expose him to the greatest concentration of enemy sea, air and coastal forces. According to survivors, the animosity between Lindemann and Lütjens was now beginning to extend to their respective staffs.|$|R
40|$|We {{studied the}} primary and {{secondary}} esophageal peristalsis in 36 patients with heartburn and acid regurgitation and in 14 asymptomatic volunteers. Primary peristalsis was elicited by ten swallows of a 5 -mL bolus of water and secondary peristalsis was elicited by intra-esophageal infusion of 5, 10, and 15 mL water, 0. 1 N hydrochloric acid and air. Esophageal contractions were measured by an 8 -lumen manometric catheter assembly incorporating a 6 -cm sleeve device. Contractions were registered at 3, 9, and 15 cm from the upper margin of the sleeve and the infusion was done <b>through</b> a side <b>hole</b> <b>located</b> at 12 cm. Twenty patients had normal endoscopic esophageal examination, 10 with normal (group I) and 10 with abnormal pH-metric examination (group II), and 16 had esophagitis (group III). The amplitude of contractions after swallows was lower (97. 8 ± 10. 0 mmHg) in the distal esophagus of group III patients than in controls (142. 3 ± 14. 0 mmHg). Patients of group III had fewer secondary contractions (water: 25 % of infusion) than patients of the other groups and controls (67 % of infusion). Patients of group III also had a lower amplitude of secondary peristalsis in the distal esophagus (water: 70. 1 ± 9. 6 mmHg) than controls (129. 2 ± 18. 2 mmHg).

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{results obtained}} during {{a research project}} aimed at realizing electrochemical single-molecule detection in water. By virtue of being inherently electrical in nature, electrochemical sensors are particularly well suited for integration with microelectronics compared to sensors based on other detection principles. They may thus enable cost effective, massively parallel analysis and diagnostics platforms. However, limited sensitivity and selectivity have been bottlenecks for years {{in the development of}} a wide range of bio-electrochemical sensors. In this project, a microfabricated nanogap device with significantly enhanced properties based on redox cycling is developed. With the ability to resolve single molecules, sensitivity is pushed to its most fundamental limit and selectivity can potentially be improved by distinguishing species via their single-molecule signatures. The nanogaps are fabricated with optical lithography and standard microfabrication techniques, they consist of two electrodes with a length in the range of 10 to 100 µm and a width of several microns embedded in the ceiling and floor of a nanofluidic channel with a height of ~ 50 nm. Redox molecules enter the detection region defined by the two electrodes <b>through</b> entrance <b>holes</b> <b>located</b> at the two ends of the channel. With the electrodes biased at high over-potentials, the molecules are oxidized and reduced repeatedly, generating an amplified current. Preliminary work to characterize and understand the behavior of the device, including how redox couples with different diffusion coefficients and reversible adsorption of analyte species influence its performance, are presented in Chapter 3 - 5. Based on a self-aligned fabrication scheme that minimizes the gap size and dead volume of the device, redox-cycling efficiency was further improved and electrochemical detection in aqueous solution with single-molecule resolution was achieved. This is the first reported electrochemical detection of single-molecules in water solution in a nanofluidic device. Further building on this approach, we also demonstrated the first study ever to characterize mass transport of individual redox molecules using an electrochemical method. Analysis of the distribution of first-passage times of single molecules suggests anomalous surface diffusion of adsorbed analyte molecules at ultra-low (10 pM) concentrations compared to measurements at high (µM to mM) concentrations...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} if copper nanoparticles could be utilized for two types of <b>through</b> <b>hole</b> plating in printed circuit boards, namely: as a catalytic material to initiate the electroless copper deposition process; and as a “conductive” layer which is coherent and conductive enough to allow “direct” electroplating of the <b>through</b> <b>hole.</b> The employment of nanoparticles means that an effective method of dispersion is required and this paper studies the use of mechanical agitation and ultrasound for this purpose. Design/methodology/approach – The paper utilized drilled, copper clad FR 4 laminate. The <b>through</b> <b>holes</b> were functionalized using a commercially available “conditioner” before being immersed in a solution of copper nanoparticles which were dispersed using either a magnetic stirrer or ultrasound (40 kHz). When the copper nanoparticles were utilized as a catalytic material for electroless copper plating, the efficacy of the technique was assessed using a standard “backlight” test which allowed the plating coverage of the <b>through</b> <b>holes</b> to be determined. As a control, a standard palladium catalysed electroless copper process was employed. The morphology of the electroless copper deposits was also analysed using scanning electron microscopy. In the “direct plate” approach, after immersion in the copper nanoparticle dispersion, the <b>through</b> <b>holes</b> were electroplated at 3 [*]Adm− 2 for 15 [*]min, sectioned and examined using an optical microscope. The distance that the copper electroplate had penetrated down the <b>through</b> <b>hole</b> was then determined. Findings – The paper has shown that copper nanoparticles can be used as a catalytic material for electroless copper plating. The coverage of the electroless copper in the <b>through</b> <b>hole</b> improves as the copper nanoparticle concentration increases and, at the highest copper nanoparticle concentrations employed, good, but not complete, electroless copper coverage is obtained. Dispersion of the copper nanoparticles using ultrasound is critical to the process. Ultrasonically dispersed copper nanoparticles achieve some limited success as a conductive layer for “direct” electroplating with some penetration of the electroplated deposit into the <b>through</b> <b>hole.</b> However, if mechanical agitation is employed to mix the nanoparticles, no <b>through</b> <b>hole</b> plating obtaines. Originality/value – The paper has demonstrated the “proof of concept” that copper nanoparticles can be utilized to catalyse the electroless copper process, as well as their potential to replace costly palladium‐based activators. The paper also illustrates the potential for copper nanoparticles to be used as a “direct plate process” and the necessity for using ultrasound for their dispersion in either process...|$|R
