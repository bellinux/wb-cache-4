40|$|This article {{draws on}} a {{longitudinal}} study of Australian (New South Wales) (n= 286), Canadian (n= 116) and Chinese (n= 91) police recruits to discuss participants understandings {{of the concept of}} obedience <b>to</b> <b>authority.</b> Results for this study, which was conducted within {{the early stages of the}} recruits’ training, indicate a significant degree of uncertainty amongst participants from all three jurisdictions when faced with varying situations involving obedience <b>to</b> <b>authority</b> issues. Policing researchers have long observed that recruits enter training with noble intentions and this is enhanced through elements of academy training, such as ethics education. In contrast, however, other researchers have found that once recruits commence their policing roles the negative aspects of police culture can impact adversely upon ethical decision making. In addition, the hierarchical nature of policing coupled with the authoritarian nature of academy training can instil in recruits obedience <b>to</b> <b>authority</b> attributes which can also erode ethical decisions. It is contended that understanding the perceptions of recruits and, in particular, those from New South Wales (NSW), concerning obedience <b>to</b> <b>authority</b> issues, may have implications for recruit training. By incorporating an understanding of obedience <b>to</b> <b>authority</b> along with associated practical scenarios within the academy training curriculum, inexperienced officers when faced with obedience <b>to</b> <b>authority</b> dilemmas in the field may be assisted...|$|R
5|$|As {{outlined}} in the 3,500-word Nichols letter, the hearing focused on 24 allegations, 23 of which dealt with Oppenheimer's Communist and left-wing affiliations between 1938 and 1946, including his delayed and false reporting of the Chevalier incident <b>to</b> <b>authorities.</b> The twenty-fourth charge related to {{his opposition to the}} hydrogen bomb. By including the hydrogen bomb, the AEC changed the character of the hearing, by opening up an inquiry into his activities as a postwar government adviser.|$|E
5|$|In late 1991, Syrian {{authorities}} arrested Nayyouf's {{wife and}} young {{daughter in a}} crackdown on members of the CDF in order to pressure Nayyouf to give himself up. On 10 January 1992, Nayyouf surrendered <b>to</b> <b>authorities.</b> After his arrest, Nayyouf was tortured at the Palestine Branch of Syrian Military Intelligence. Many of Nayyouf's colleagues in the CDF were also arrested, and at least 17 were tried alongside Nayyouf by the Syrian Supreme State Security Court (SSSC) in proceedings lasting from 29 February to 27 March 1992.|$|E

They found several in the northeastern section of the forest, within present-day Ventura County. In 1843 he found gold in San Feliciano Canyon near his first discovery. Mexican miners from Sonora worked the placer deposits until 1846, when the Californios began to agitate for independence from Mexico, and the Bear Flag Revolt caused many Mexicans to leave California.|$|E

5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{arrived at}} John F. Kennedy International Airport at around 4:00 pm EDT and taxied {{to a remote}} part of the runway. A three-man hostage negotiation team had been assembled in the air traffic control tower. NYPD detective Dominick Misino spoke with Demeke over the radio, assisted by FBI special agent John Flood and Port Authority detective sergeant Carmine Spano. After 70 minutes of negotiation, Demeke traded his pistol for the pilot's sunglasses and surrendered peacefully <b>to</b> <b>authorities.</b> All 94 passengers and ten crew were unharmed.|$|E
5|$|Work on {{the lines}} began in 1636, but no {{ceremony}} was carried out to commemorate laying the foundation stone due to controversy surrounding the construction.

In one home in Dale, Illinois, near Tuckers Corners and southwest of McLeansboro, the quake cracked interior walls, plaster, and chimneys. Using a type of victim study, the local post office surveyed residents and implemented a field inspection which indicated the strongest shaking (MM VII) {{took place in the}} Wabash Valley, Ohio Valley, and other nearby south-central Illinois lowlands.

The Santa Barbara County Fire Department initially responded around 11:40am to a report of a strong smell coming from the area. Fire crews found the crude oil flowing from a drainage culvert that passed under U.S. 101, and into the Pacific Ocean and reported the leak <b>to</b> <b>authorities.</b> Local pipeline workers {{did not know about}} the leak until they were notified by the state parks staff around noon that there was oil in the water. After struggling to find the leaking pipeline, workers located Line 901 where it had leaked and flowed into the storm culvert around 1:30pm. Clean-up efforts didn't begin for 16 to 18 hours.|$|E

Twenty-one additional students surrendered <b>to</b> <b>authorities,</b> and two students {{were killed in}} a shooting incident. The government decided to delay the assault, hoping for the safe evacuation of more students from the besieged mosque. President Pervez Musharraf issued an ultimatum on the evening of 7 July. The Pakistani army took over the operation and replaced the paramilitary troops deployed around the premises. A thirteen-year-old child escaped from the besieged mosque unharmed.|$|E
5|$|This poem can be {{interpreted}} as criticizing the failure of the salt monopoly established by Wang Anshi, embodied in the persona of a hard-working old man who was cruelly denied his means to flavor his food, with the severity of the laws and the only salt available being charged at rates that were too expensive. After his confession, Su Shi was found guilty in court, and was summarily exiled to Hubei Province.

In 1982, he offered a reward of $100,000 for Mengele's capture and insisted as late as 1985—six years after Mengele's death—that he was still alive. The Mengele family admitted <b>to</b> <b>authorities</b> in 1985 that he had died in 1979; the body was exhumed and its identity was confirmed.
