40|$|The Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) Directive {{entered in}} European Union {{legislation}} in 2001. The {{need for this}} new Directive came from a lack in the former one, the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Directive, on plans and programmes. The goal of the SEA Directive is to oblige the decision makers, of a programme or a plan, {{to take into account}} the environment. The SEA process can allow a thinking period on plans and programmes and what could be done to reduce damages and enhance the environmental performance of the plan or programme. The study investigates the SEA Directive and its interpretation and implementation in France and the UK. Two case studies, on SEA of Regional Economic Strategies, complete this study which aims at comparing the two countries’ implementation of the directive, what are the differences and similarities of the interpretation and implementation of the SEA Directive and find possible explanations. The study concludes that the two SEA’s are quite similar with all <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>required.</b> <b>Concerning</b> <b>the</b> Regional Economic Strategies, the UK seems to have done a better analysis and report of its region’s study. On the opposite the French region case needs to be completed as some lacks were found. For example, the opinion of the Préfet on the accuracy degree of information that should be in the evaluation and explanations on why this project had been chosen are missing in the French region environmental evaluation. But, even with some lacks the French SEA process is a good one. The study can not compare the consultation and monitoring parts as some documents, concerning the consultation part and the monitoring, are not available yet. This study is a final year research project which is seen as a diploma study in French’s school system...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Any higher {{education}} institute like a university {{should have a}} tentative future plan. The first step in establishing such a plan is to get <b>the</b> <b>required</b> <b>information</b> <b>concerning</b> <b>the</b> projected student enrollment {{for the next few}} years. Though an enrollment forecasting is a specific type of estimation - one that uses past information in some manner to arrive at an estimate of future enrollments. The basic assumptions are that some historical pattern exists, that this pattern can be identified and data can be collected to measure it, and that it reflects what is it to occur in the future. In this paper, we will show a systematic analysis of students data to identify the hidden historical pattern and its important parameters which is essential for the forecasting. A computer program will be developed based on that historical pattern. The computer program then {{can be used as a}} powerful simulation tool to project the future enrollment...|$|R
40|$|For {{shallow water}} naval operations, obtaining rapidly an {{accurate}} picture of the environmental circumstances often is of high importance. <b>The</b> <b>required</b> <b>information</b> typically <b>concerns</b> water column properties, sea surface roughness, and sediment geo-acoustic properties. Hereto a multi-sensor approach is required. In this context, the BP' 07 experiment {{has been carried out}} south of Elba (Mediterranean Sea), where several techniques of environmental characterization have been combined. A part of BP' 07 was dedicated to measurements carried out with a multibeam echosounder. This system provides depth information, but also allows for seafloor classification. The classification approach taken is model-based employing the backscatter data. It discriminates between sediments in the most optimal way by applying the Bayes decision rule for multiple hypotheses, implicitly accounting for ping-to-ping variability in backscatter strength. For validating the resulting geo-acoustic estimates sediment samples were collected. Here, besides the analysis of the depth measurements, the results of the seafloor classification using the multibeam data and a preliminary comparison with the sediment sample analysis are presented.
