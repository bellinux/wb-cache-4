5|$|In {{the game}} {{there are a}} number of <b>television</b> <b>sets</b> that can be found around the town in {{different}} places. They can be switched on and a short episode of the fictional series Night Springs will be played, which is influenced by the television series The Twilight Zone, created by Rod Serling in the late 1950s.|$|E
5|$|In the game, {{the player}} assumes control of American forces and must {{eliminate}} all Japanese forces around the atoll by air or naval combat. The Battle For Midway received largely negative reviews upon release. It was criticised for its incompatibility {{with black and}} white <b>television</b> <b>sets,</b> as the game was only accessible in a limited range of colours. The easy difficulty of the gameplay was also criticised.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the opening}} night's transmissions, WIN-4 {{undertook}} a television conversion program, aimed at encouraging residents to acquire new tuning equipment and converting <b>television</b> <b>sets</b> {{in the area to}} receive the station's allocated frequency. A transmitter was to be erected on Knight's Hill, however test transmissions were delayed due to rain.|$|E
40|$|This study aims {{to design}} and build an expert system that can {{diagnose}} damage to the <b>television</b> <b>set</b> based on the type and characteristics of the damage by using backward chaining method. The expert system in this study has been designed and built using the backward chaining method. It starts by proving the preliminary conclusions based on direct observations of users of the damage type to the <b>television</b> <b>set</b> that will be repaired, and the results show {{the facts and the}} rules appropriate to the type and characteristics of the damage to the <b>television</b> <b>set.</b> The expert system was proved capable of receiving, storing, and transferring knowledge from experts or repair technicians of the damage to the <b>television</b> <b>set</b> according to the type and characteristics of the actual damage to the <b>television</b> <b>set.</b> This expert system also proved to be able to function properly to diagnose problem of the <b>television</b> <b>set</b> based on the type and characteristics of the damage...|$|R

5|$|The primary {{consumption}} of indium worldwide is LCD production. Demand rose rapidly {{from the late}} 1990s to 2010 with the popularity of LCD computer monitors and <b>television</b> <b>sets,</b> which now account for 50% of indium consumption. Increased manufacturing efficiency and recycling (especially in Japan) maintain a balance between demand and supply. According to the UNEP, indium's end-of-life recycling rate is less than 1%.|$|E
5|$|A {{performance}} piece, {{the video}} features strobe lighting and falling glitter cut into shots of Garbage performing against a golden backdrop surrounded by <b>television</b> <b>sets</b> relaying real time {{footage of the}} band playing. Throughout the clip, there is also shots of a semi-naked man with running black eyeliner crawling on the floor, an Australian born actor and model named Greg Brown who appeared in other Samuel Bayer projects such as videos for David Bowie and Nirvana.|$|E
5|$|Despite not {{charting}} in Billboard magazine, {{the video}} reached the Top 10 for four consecutive weeks on Terra Networks' Top Music Video countdown. In the music video for the song, Queen is video taped showing sensual scenes by several cameras from different angles. Scenes alternate between a dance {{in a darkened}} room and Queen is a record studio and the cameras. She is surrounded by multiple computers and flat screen <b>television</b> <b>sets</b> which display the feeds from the cameras.|$|E

5|$|During the screenwriting process when Ephron {{would not}} feel like writing, she would {{interview}} people {{who worked for the}} production company. Some of the interviews appeared in the film as the interludes between certain scenes featuring couples talking about how they met, although the material was rewritten and reshot with actors. Ephron supplied the structure of the film with much of the dialogue based on the real-life friendship between Reiner and Crystal. For example, in the scene where Sally and Harry appear on a split screen, talking on the telephone while watching their respective <b>television</b> <b>sets,</b> channel surfing, was something that Crystal and Reiner did every night.|$|E
5|$|Electrons are {{important}} in cathode ray tubes, which have been extensively used as display devices in laboratory instruments, computer monitors and <b>television</b> <b>sets.</b> In a photomultiplier tube, every photon striking the photocathode initiates an avalanche of electrons that produces a detectable current pulse. Vacuum tubes use the flow of electrons to manipulate electrical signals, and they {{played a critical role}} in the development of electronics technology. However, they have been largely supplanted by solid-state devices such as the transistor.|$|E
5|$|The 24-man {{animation}} {{team was}} {{split into two}} groups. Half {{were assigned to the}} creation of the 15 new CGI creatures populating noitulovE (in Maya), while the other half created the backgrounds (in Houdini). Compositing work – combining the greenscreen shots with stock footage and CGI elements – was performed in Flame and Inferno. As the final commercial was to be shown on cinema screens, the animators worked at a resolution higher than that afforded by the 576i definition used by British PAL-encoded <b>television</b> <b>sets,</b> to improve the appearance of the advert when projected.|$|E
25|$|A smart TV {{device is}} either a <b>television</b> <b>set</b> with {{integrated}} Internet capabilities or a set-top box for television that offers more advanced computing ability and connectivity than a contemporary basic <b>television</b> <b>set.</b> Smart TVs may {{be thought of as}} an information appliance or the computer system from a handheld computer integrated within a <b>television</b> <b>set</b> unit, as such a smart TV often allows the user to install and run more advanced applications or plugins/addons based on a specific platform. Smart TVs run a complete operating system or mobile operating system software providing a platform for application developers.|$|R

5|$|The Wii console {{connects to}} the Internet through its {{built-in}} 802.11b/g Wi-Fi or through a USB-to-Ethernet adapter; either method allows players to access the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection service. The service has several features for the console, including the Virtual Console, WiiConnect24, Internet Channel, Forecast Channel, Everybody Votes Channel, News Channel and the Check Mii Out Channel. The Wii can also communicate (and connect) with other Wii systems through a self-generated wireless LAN, enabling local wireless multi-playing on different <b>television</b> <b>sets.</b> Battalion Wars 2 first demonstrated this feature for non-split screen multi-playing between two (or more) televisions.|$|E
5|$|The team {{designed}} venues {{that represented}} {{parts of the}} Beatles' history {{in order to create}} an atmosphere of authenticity. For example, the set of The Ed Sullivan Show was recreated from photographs and videos, including a rare color photograph in Apple's collection that showed the yellow tint used to enhance the video as shown on black-and-white <b>television</b> <b>sets.</b> The Cavern Club, Shea Stadium, Budokan, Abbey Road Studios and the rooftop of the Apple Corps Headquarters also appear as venues in the game. Fashions of the 1960s were researched to properly apply them to the various virtual crowds at these locations.|$|E
5|$|A {{major element}} of {{gameplay}} is the optional discovery and collection of manuscript pages from Alan Wake's latest novel—Departure. Although Wake does not remember writing this book, its storyline {{seems to be}} becoming real around him. These readable manuscript pages are scattered around the game world, out of chronological order; they often describe scenes {{that have yet to}} occur and act as warning and instructions for proceeding through upcoming challenges. Other optional collectibles include coffee thermoses scattered around the game world (100 in all), as well as discovering <b>television</b> <b>sets</b> which show different episodes of the fictional Night Springs series, radios airing talk and music from Bright Falls' local radio station, and textual signs around the town. The radio shows and signs provide {{a deeper understanding of the}} town's history and culture. The game's downloadable content episodes introduce other collectibles such as alarm clocks.|$|E

5|$|Carol buys a car, and the McCoys {{drive to}} an {{electronics}} store. As Doc buys a portable radio, he switches {{off the television}} set near the proprietor's desk broadcasting {{the news of the}} earlier incidents they were involved in. Suddenly, all the <b>television</b> <b>sets</b> in the store show Doc's picture, prompting him to leave immediately. The proprietor gets a glimpse of the picture, and calls the police. Doc steals a shotgun, followed by several shoot-outs and police chases. The couple escape by hiding in a large trash bin, only to end up {{in the back of a}} garbage truck that dumps its load at the local landfill. Filthy and frustrated, they argue about whether to stay together or split up. They decide to see things through.|$|E
5|$|Even though {{social impact}} of {{television}} in Croatia {{is considered to}} be imperfect and that of variable quality, television is important in the society because it offers a way for non-governmental organizations to communicate their concerns to the public and to criticize the government and other aspects of politics of Croatia. Television is the most widespread source of information in Croatiaon average 57% of the population of Croatia uses television as their primary source of information. That percentage varies significantly by geographic regionfrom 43% in Zagreb and areas surrounding the capital to 79% in Slavoniabut in every region it surpasses all other sources of information, the second most widely used source of information being the Internet averaging at 19%. In 2014 there were 1.755million registered <b>television</b> <b>sets</b> in the country.|$|E
5|$|The {{assassination}} attempt was captured on video by several cameras, including those {{belonging to the}} Big Three television networks; ABC began airing footage at 2:42p.m. All three networks erroneously reported that Brady had died. While the Cable News Network (CNN) {{did not have a}} camera of its own at the shooting it was able to use NBC's pool feed, and by staying on the story for 48 hours, the network, less than a year old, built a reputation for thoroughness. Shocked Americans gathered around <b>television</b> <b>sets</b> in homes and shopping centers. Some cited the alleged Curse of Tippecanoe, and others recalled the assassinations of Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr. Newspapers printed extra editions and used gigantic headlines; the United States Senate adjourned, interrupting debate of Reagan's economic proposals; and churches held prayer services.|$|E

5|$|Video {{output is}} through an RF {{modulator}} and {{was designed for}} use with contemporary <b>television</b> <b>sets,</b> for a simple colour graphic display. Text can be displayed using 32columns × 24rows of characters from the ZX Spectrum character set or from a set provided within an application, from a palette of 15 shades: seven colours at two levels of brightness each, plus black. The image resolution is 256×192 with the same colour limitations. To conserve memory, colour is stored separate from the pixel bitmap in a low resolution, 32×24 grid overlay, corresponding to the character cells. In practice, this means that all pixels of an 8x8 character block share one foreground colour and one background colour.|$|E
5|$|Moon {{grew up in}} Alperton, {{a suburb}} of Wembley, in Middlesex, and took up the drums during the early 1960s. After playing with a local band, the Beachcombers, he joined the Who in 1964 before they {{recorded}} their first single. Moon remained with the band during their rise to fame, and was quickly recognised for his drumming style, which emphasised tom-toms, cymbal crashes, and drum fills. He occasionally collaborated with other musicians and later appeared in films, but considered playing in the Who his primary occupation and remained {{a member of the}} band until his death. In addition to his talent as a drummer, however, Moon developed a reputation for smashing his kit on stage and destroying hotel rooms on tour. He was fascinated by blowing up toilets with cherry bombs or dynamite, and by destroying <b>television</b> <b>sets.</b> Moon enjoyed touring and socialising, and was bored and restless when the Who were inactive. His 21st birthday party in Flint, Michigan, has been cited as a notorious example of decadent behaviour by rock groups.|$|E
5|$|The Odyssey was {{released}} by Magnavox in September 1972. After initially ordering a production run of 50,000 units, prior to release Magnavox increased its production capabilities and built up a large stock of the systems, as market testing had shown an enthusiastic response to the console. The Odyssey was sold only through Magnavox dealers and not through general retailers; Magnavox felt that as the first video game console it would draw consumers into its stores. The device retailed for US$99.99, or US$50 when purchased along with a Magnavox television. There are conflicting reports between Baer and Magnavox employees as to whether Magnavox produced 120,000 or 140,000 consoles in 1972; additionally, Odyssey product manager Bob Fritsche recalls selling 69,000 units that year, while Baer recalls sales being closer to 100,000. Baer has stated that he felt the low initial sales were due to the high price—US$100 being the equivalent of US$587 in 2017—and because of Magnavox restricting sales to their dealerships and implying that the device only worked with Magnavox televisions. Other sources have stated that dealership salespeople would try to mislead customers to that effect {{in order to try}} to sell more <b>television</b> <b>sets.</b> Magnavox assistant product planner Don Emry has noted that the sales were in line with the original projections, if not with the production run.|$|E
