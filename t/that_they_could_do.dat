5|$|Macrae, Ismay and Churchill all saw fit {{to record}} these {{arguments}} over the technical issue of stickiness. As Eden had pointed out, {{there was a}} lot at stake. The British infantry and Home Guard had little with which to put up a fight against tanks and to any who had witnessed trials of Molotov Cocktails and SIP grenades it was evident <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> little to a modern tank other than to provide a blinding pall of smoke. What was needed was a hand weapon to deliver a coup de grâce by punching through the armoured plate. The sticky bomb could do the job and little else was available.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1907, U.S. naval and {{military}} planners {{had concluded that}} it would be impractical to repel an invasion of the Philippines. The best that could be hoped for was that the garrison could hold out on the Bataan peninsula until help arrived. In the 1920s it was estimated <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> so for about 60 days. By the 1930s, the planners had become decidedly pessimistic in view of the increased capability of aircraft, and by 1936 they were agreed that the Philippine should be written off. But in July 1941, this decision was abruptly reversed, and it became the policy of the U.S. government to defend and hold the Philippines. This was based, at least in part, in the belief that Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bombers could deter or defeat an invading force.|$|E
5|$|By August 1977, discussions {{had been}} held with the main cast from The Original Series, {{as well as some}} of the actors who had played {{recurring}} characters. While none had been signed at the time, Roddenberry expressed confidence <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> so with the exception of Leonard Nimoy, who had stated that he would not return to television. However, Nimoy said separately that the first offer he received from Roddenberry for Phase II was only for the pilot and then guaranteed appearances in two out of every 11 episodes that followed, which he rejected. Nimoy and Roddenberry were not on good terms, following a legal suit launched by the actor against Paramount over merchandising rights featuring his likeness; Roddenberry had refused to support Nimoy in the case. There was also a problem with the return of William Shatner: owing to the pay he was to receive for the pilot and the first thirteen episodes, the network wanted a contingency plan to replace him afterwards. Shatner was aware at the time that the plan was either to reduce his appearances after the initial episodes and reduce his ongoing fees, or to kill off the character permanently if he refused the pay cut. Negotiations began with Shatner on June 10, but it was not until September 12 that his return was announced.|$|E

25|$|The SLA's sordid {{behavior}} inevitably {{led to the}} {{alienation of}} many civilians and pushed some Sierra Leoneans to join the rebel cause. With morale low and rations even lower, many SLA soldiers discovered <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> better by joining with the rebels in looting civilians in the countryside instead of fighting against them. The local civilians referred to these soldiers as ‘sobels’ or ‘soldiers by day, rebels by night’ because of their {{close ties to the}} RUF. By mid-1993, the two opposing sides became virtually indistinguishable. For these reasons, civilians increasingly relied on an irregular force called the Kamajors for their protection.|$|E
25|$|During {{the period}} of the Napoleonic Wars, the East India Company {{arranged}} for letters of marque for its vessels such as the Lord Nelson. This was not so that they could carry cannon to fend off warships, privateers and pirates on their voyages to India and China (<b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> without permission) but so that, should they have the opportunity to take a prize, they could do so without being guilty of piracy. Similarly, the Earl of Mornington, an East India Company packet ship of only six guns, also sailed under a letter of marque.|$|E
25|$|Gemini's {{emergency}} launch escape {{system did}} not use an escape tower powered by a solid-fuel rocket, but instead used aircraft-style ejection seats. The tower was heavy and complicated, and NASA engineers reasoned <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> away with it as the Titan II's hypergolic propellants would burn immediately on contact. A Titan II booster explosion had a smaller blast effect and flame than on the cryogenically fueled Atlas and Saturn. Ejection seats were sufficient to separate the astronauts from a malfunctioning launch vehicle. At higher altitudes, where the ejection seats could not be used, the astronauts would return inside the spacecraft, which would separate from the launch vehicle.|$|E

25|$|The second Indian raid was {{conducted}} on the same target by eight Canberras led by Wing Commander Surinder Singh, which again left the airport's terminal and other buildings untouched. Two transport aircraft—a Lockheed Constellation belonging to the Portuguese airline TAP and a Douglas DC-4 belonging to the Goan airline TAIP—were parked on the apron. On the night of 18 December, the Portuguese used both aircraft to evacuate the families of some government and military officials in spite of the heavily damaged runway. During the first hours of the evening, airport workers hastily recovered part of the runway. The first aircraft to leave was the TAP Constellation commanded by Manuel Correia Reis, which took off using only 700 metres; the debris from the runway damaged the fuselage with 25 holes and a flat tire. To take off in the short distance, the TAP pilots had jettisoned all the extra seats and other unwanted equipment so <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> a 'short take-off'. The second to leave was the TAIP DC-4, piloted by TAIP Director Major Solano de Almeida. Both aircraft used the cover of night and very low altitudes to break through Indian aerial patrols and escape to Karachi, Pakistan.|$|E
25|$|On May 21, the {{families}} attempted {{to put forward}} a writ of amparo and accused the government of violating their rights by putting unnecessary barriers and forcing them to visit Mexico City {{to see the results}} of the DNA samples. On May 24, {{the families}} pushed their case to Mexico's National Human Rights Commission (CNDH) to help them retrieve the DNA samples from the PGR in Jalisco. The CNDH told the lawyer that the families no longer had to go to Mexico City for the DNA samples and <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> the procedures in Jalisco. The government was able to confirm the identity of 3 of the 8 civilians killed. They stated that their DNA samples matched those of the family members, but clarified that these people were killed in clashes with security forces on May 1 and not on May 19. The families of Villa Purificación contested the government's final decision, and stated that between May and May 19, dozens of people were killed in the town. They claimed that the Army safeguarded the morgues to prevent civilians from seeing the bodies and identifying them. On May 22, the families of the missing people returned to Villa Purificación.|$|E
500|$|The Byrds {{moved quickly}} to record a self-produced {{follow-up}} to Byrdmaniax, {{in an attempt to}} stem the criticism that the album was receiving in the music press and as a reaction to their own dislike of Melcher's overproduction.

500|$|The Beatles was {{recorded}} between 30 May and 14 October 1968, largely at Abbey Road Studios in London, with some sessions at Trident Studios. The group block-booked time at Abbey Road through to July, and their times at Rishikesh were soon {{forgotten in the}} atmosphere of the studio, with sessions occurring at irregular hours. The group's self-belief <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> anything {{led to the formation of}} a new multimedia business corporation Apple Corps, an enterprise that drained the group financially with a series of unsuccessful projects. The open-ended studio time led to a new way of working out songs. Instead of tightly rehearsing a backing track, as had happened in previous sessions, the group would simply record all the rehearsals and jamming, then add overdubs to the best take. Harrison's song [...] "Not Guilty" [...] was left off the album despite recording 102 takes.|$|E

After two months he was transferred to the Royal Naval College, Greenwich. While in Sussex, his health began to deteriorate and he cut down on his pipe smoking. After a few months at Greenwich, he took ill and was hospitalised. Diagnosed with lung cancer, naval doctors found <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> little for Worsley, and he was discharged. He opted to spend the last days of his life with his wife and the Bamford family, good friends who lived in Claygate, Surrey. He died in the Bamford house on 1 February 1943. [...] He was cremated after a well attended service held on 3 February at the chapel of the Royal Navy College.

In the meantime, while thinking how to progress from the war film tone of The First Avenger, the writers settled on the conspiracy genre for the screenplay, and cited Three Days of the Condor, The Parallax View, and Marathon Man as influences, feeling it better conveyed Captain America's trust issues and contrasting values {{in the new world}} he was living in, with Markus saying, [...] "If you put that 1940s man into present day geo-politics everything is going to seem like a conspiracy. It's just going to seem dirty and underhanded and shifty, and people won't be telling the truth." [...] Three Days of the Condor in particular was used as the main source of the script structure, following the idea that the protagonist is being chased by a threat they, along with the audience, only discover halfway through the film.|$|E
500|$|A soundtrack album {{consisting}} of hip hop and R songs {{was released on}} April 23, 2002, through Artemis Records. Eglee explained that he and Cameron began with the idea <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> a [...] "hip hop youth ensemble thing", noting that [...] "hip hop had become the dominant influence in the country [...] in the world" [...] and that they saw an opportunity to give the future of Dark Angel the soundtrack of contemporary American popular culture. In the soundtrack's liner notes, Eglee writes:Reminiscent of another time and place... {{that part of the}} Bronx in the late 1970s known as Fort Apache: a place that for white America, defined lack and limitation, violence and hopelessness. What white Americans couldn't see or hear then was the beautiful thing being birthed there, which, years later, would {{come to be known as}} Hip Hop.... This album remembers the foundations of Hip Hop as it contemplates its future. [...] Randy Gerston said that because of the near future setting of the series, he avoided any major hit songs as these would not sound futuristic. This gave them the opportunity to discover new talent instead. The album features predominately female hip hop and neo soul artists whose lyrics typically [...] "focus on the expression of female agency and power – particularly with regard to sexuality." [...] It peaked at No. 50 on the Top Independent Albums chart. Jason Birchmeier of AllMusic gave the soundtrack three out of five stars. He noted the lack of major artists on the album and commented that it [...] "seems to be a female-orientated soundtrack, perhaps because of the show's female lead character". Birchmeier said many of the songs were [...] "quite impressive" [...] and that it [...] "exceeds your expectations for a television show soundtrack".|$|E
