This all above leaded to various maternal problems included high maternal mortality ratio and deprived health services, especially in developing countries like India. But over the time government has made lot of efforts to revert this pathetic condition of mothers. And in pursuance of this govt. has started number of programmes and schemes to make the mothers counted. One of such scheme is Janani Suraksha Yojna (JSY) a safe motherhood intervention started in 2005 with the objective to bring down the MMR by promoting institutional deliveries, decline in domiciliary delivery, increase in ANC registration & checkups, TT immunization etc. so they are the performance (MCH) indicators of the scheme which if anytime get analyzed can provide us at least some sort of clue about the performance of scheme over the time. Same was tried to pave out in this study with the objective of: ‚Ä¢ To desk review various secondary data which is directly or indirectly related with JSY. ‚Ä¢ To assess the impact of JSY on various MCH indicators. Material and Methods: A desk review was done by collecting various secondary data and later on it was processed and analyzed by manually along with suitable statistical software. Results: There has been significant rise in the No. of institutional deliveries after inception of JSY which was around 32744 (48. 8 %) in 2003 - 04 on the other hand it was counted around 36589 (50 %) and 36045 (73. 1 %) in year 2006 - 07 & 2007 - 08 respectively. In the same way like above ANC registrations have got increased and MMR brought down. Conclusion: JSY has worked in accordance with objectives it was started in 2005 then. It played vital role in the reduction of MMR. So Govt. should try to launch more and more schemes like JSY to make the mothers life safe and fruitful...|$|E

Living in these simple pit houses people could work in any season, if necessary even in winter, but generally they returnd to their home settlements in southern Sakhalin after working. Fish bones of Pleurogrammus azonus Jordan et Metz, Gadus macrocephalus Tilesius and Clupea pallasii Valenciennes found in small scale cultural layers No. VI and V in Kafukai- 1 site, about 500 m north of Kafukai- 5, shows that people started winter fishing activity there.

Their main occupations were fishing and sea mammal hunting from autumn to spring season. Now they could keep many dogs and pigs by feeding them fish during the winter. To sum up, in the early stage of the Okhotsk culture, people started to use new territory as a summer camp by constructing and living in the temporary hut. Next they kept and used the site as an all year round camp with simple pit house. Finally people established a settlement with permanent pit houses made of massive log pillars...|$|E

The partitioning process can be modeled depending upon dominancy of being adsorptive or absorptive partitioning and referred with partition coefficient (Kp m 3. √é¬ºg- 1). Kp is related to liquid phase vapor pressure of a compound of interest. Due to difficulty related to model parameters, researchers have been developed a parameter called octanol air partition coefficient, KOA which can be directly measured and used to estimate Kp. Synthetic musk compounds (SMCs) are <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> semi volatile organic compounds which are resistant to degradation, lipophilic and have moderate vapor pressures. They {{have been widely used}} in detergents, soaps, cosmetics, perfumes to give nice odorous effect for the product of interest. Most of their chemical properties values based on estimation methods. This study designed to measure octanol-air partition coefficients (KOA) and supercooled liquid vapor pressures (PL) by GC retention time method as a function of temperature to estimate gas-particle partitioning of SMCs. In addition ten indoor air gas and particulate phase samples were collected from a university cafeteria to determine experimental partition coefficient in the indoor air environment. The log KOA and log PL values of synthetic musk compounds were ranged between 6. 42 to 8. 77 and 0. 52 to - 4. 53, respectively at 25 0 C. All of the compounds were detected in the gas phase and the concentrations ranged from 0. 27 ng/m 3 to 106. 8 ng/m 3. In the particulate phase only DPMI, ADBI, ATII, MX and MK were detected in the range of 0. 06 ng/m 3 to 210. 5 ng/m 3. Although the correlation between the gas-particle partitioning coefficient (KP) and PL was found as weak, KOA was determined as a good descriptor for gas-particle partitioning process...|$|E

40|$|The late Prof. Hans Van Werveke, in {{two very}} {{contentious}} articles, had {{contended that the}} monetary policies of Count Lodewijk van Male (Louis de Male) ‚Äòhad checked, for some time at least, the decay of the Flemish cloth industry‚Äô by allowing its industrial entrepreneurs (weaver-drapers) to pay their artisans in continually debased silver coins, thereby reducing their real costs and sales prices, which provided the only means by which ‚Äòit could hold out against foreign competition,‚Äô namely the growing threat from the English cloth trade. Although he subsequently wrote an important article on the 1390 monetary reform of the count‚Äôs son-in-law and successor, Duke Philip the Bold, neither he nor anyone else has examined the possible impact of that entirely contrary monetary policy, in strengthening the coinage, upon the Flemish cloth industry, {{at the very time}} that the English and Dutch cloth trades had taken advantage of the damages inflicted by the Ghent Revolt of 1379 - 85 and the Hanseatic Embargo of 1388 - 92, to invade Baltic and German markets. This study focuses in upon the consequences of that policy in aggravating ongoing conflict in the industry‚Äôs labour relations: in particular the ongoing strife between the weaver-draper entrepreneurs and the fullers, <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> wage-earning employees that enjoyed some protection from a guild organization. This 1390 monetary reform had necessitated a 25 -percent reduction in wages, along with other prices; and such wage cuts were bitterly resented, with threats of strikes from the fullers of Ghent, Kortrijjk, and Wervik. While compulsory arbitration from the ducal Council of Flanders did impose settlements, and new wages that endured unchanged until the 1420 s, it unwittingly set the stage for subsquent strikes, {{especially in the case of}} Kortrijk, by specifying wages in gold coins as well as in silver coins, with a fixed bimetallic ratio. When the duke‚Äôs grandson, Philip the Good, resumed drastic coinage debasements in the 1420 s (to help finance his wars), and in manner that drove up the relative value of gold coins, the Kortrijk fullers then demanded to be paid in gold; and with the drapers‚Äô refusal and a sharp rise in the cost of living, they and the Ghent fullers engaged in disruptive strikes. But the most serious consequence of Philip the Good‚Äôs monetary policy was to provoke an English retaliation in the form of bullionist payment regulations at the Calais Wool staple, where the Flemish drapers secured almost all their wools. Those onerous regulations and the conflicts that followed doomed both the English wool trade and the Flemish cloth industry to a sudden and irredeemable decline. ...|$|E
40|$|Laboratory serum {{biochemical}} {{tests are}} regarded by the Liver Study Group (LSG) of the WSAVA {{as an essential}} component of any liver investigation. The LSG categorised liver disease into four groups: vascular disorders, biliary disorders; parenchymal disorders and neoplasia. The laboratory tests that evaluate the liver have three categories. The cytosolic enzymes assess hepatocellular integrity; the cholestatic or inducible enzymes assess the biliary tree, liver excretory pathways and possible enzyme induction. The third category is the liver function tests which assess overall hepatic functional mass and portovascular integrity. The liver function tests commonly used include plasma ammonia concentration, serum bile acid concentrations and various tests that evaluate the uptake and conjugation of metabolites by the liver. Uric acid was once used as a liver test in the late 1950 ‚Äôs early 1960 ‚Äôs. Physiologically, uric acid is an attractive candidate for a liver function test. In most mammalian species serum uric acid levels only increase to the levels encountered in humans when there is hepatic dysfunction. Uric acid fell out of favour as a liver function test following the publication of two studies and one case report in the late 1950 ‚Äôs. The differences between hepatocellular integrity tests, cholestatic tests and tests of liver function were not fully understood at that time. The authors unfairly compared uric acid, essentially a liver function test, to a test of cholestasis. In addition the authors had very vague inclusion criteria for their liver disease cases. Despite the short-comings in these studies several prominent reference texts have since perpetuated their findings and uric acid fell out of the reckoning as a test of liver function. Many tests of liver function have been used over the years. Dynamic function tests have gained popularity again. Plasma ammonia concentration is a very reliable test of liver function but has very stringent sample-handling requirements which often make its application in the average clinic setting impractical. Serum bile acid concentrations, while not as sensitive or specific for portovascular shunting as ammonia, are widely regarded as the best test of overall liver function, especially with respect to non vascular-associated liver disease. However bile acid assays are not widely available in South Africa resulting in delays in turn-around times. In today‚Äôs climate of ever increasing costs, and demand for rapid turn around times, it would be very useful to veterinarians if a simple, rapid, cheap and robust assay could be found for evaluating functional hepatic mass. Uric acid would seem to have this potential and it is performed by most medical laboratories. In this study the serum uric acid concentrations and concentration of bile acids of a control group of normal dogs was used to compare to those in three other groups of dogs. Two of these groups had liver disease, and the third was a renal disease group. <b>The</b> <b>one</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> liver disease was comprised of dogs with congenital vascular anomalies while the second liver disease group was made up of dogs with various parenchymal liver diseases. Serum bile acid concentrations in the four groups were compared to the serum uric acid levels to assess the utility of uric acid as a test of liver function; and to measure the affects of diminished renal function on serum uric acid concentrations. There were significant differences in the serum bile acid concentrations between the two liver disease groups and the non-liver disease groups. Uric acid concentrations between all four groups did not differ significantly however. Serum uric acid was elevated in dogs with renal impairment. Therefore the findings in this study indicate that uric acid cannot be used as a test of liver function and is not comparable to serum bile acids in this regard.
