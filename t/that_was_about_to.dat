Although there were originally fourteen acts confirmed by the BBC, it was later announced on 5 March 2015 that 's Bobbysocks would join the line-up increasing the total to fifteen.

5|$|Series creator Rob Thomas {{included}} {{the scene in}} which Logan attacks Piz on his list of highlights from the third season. When Thomas first viewed the scene with his wife, she emitted an audible groan when she saw Logan walking through the cafeteria towards Piz, anticipating the fight <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> come. Thomas thought that most fight scenes on the show were not well-done, as they are filmed quickly and without a second unit. However, he {{was pleased with the}} final cut, stating that there was only one punch that he thought looked fake.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} days of January, 1894 a meeting of the Central Committee of the Fasci took place in Palermo to discuss the {{position}} of the movement. Two sharply contrasting positions emerged. De Felice Giuffrida, known for his anarchist tendencies, supported the need {{to take advantage of the}} situation of unrest to provoke a revolution on the island. However, the majority took an opposite view, arguing the need to proceed peacefully. A revolt was not only inappropriate, but it would be detrimental to the movement. The meeting condemned the violent incidents in various parts of the island, and launched an appeal to stay calm and not to retaliate. In the end De Felice Giuffrida accepted the position of the majority. But the die was cast for the authorities to arrest De Felice, Montalto, Petrina, and others. Garibaldi Bosco, Barbato and Verro were arrested on board the steamship Bagnara <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> leave for Tunis.|$|E

5|$|Reports of {{the brutal}} {{policies}} of the organization soon {{made their way to}} Phnom Penh and into the population foretelling the violence <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> consume the nation. There were tales of the forced relocations of entire villages, of the summary execution of any who disobeyed or even asked questions, the forbidding of religious practices, of monks who were defrocked or murdered, and where traditional sexual and marital habits were foresworn. War was one thing, the offhand manner in which the Khmer Rouge dealt out death, so contrary to the Khmer character, was quite another. Reports of these atrocities began to surface during the same period in which North Vietnamese troops were withdrawing from the Cambodian battlefields. This was no coincidence. The concentration of the PAVN effort on South Vietnam allowed the Khmer Rouge to apply their doctrine and policies without restraint for the first time.|$|E
5|$|Unknown to the brigade, {{units of}} the German 1st Parachute Division had parachuted onto Catania {{airfield}} to reinforce the Italians guarding the bridge and quickly moved to regain the crossing. The German paratroops attacked at dawn. The defenders at the bridge held out all day against infantry, armour and attacks by aircraft. South of the bridge, the 2nd Parachute Battalion also under attack, were able to call on naval gunfire support from the 6inch guns of the British cruiser , which stopped an assault <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> overrun their position. The men from the 1st and 3rd Battalions, although initially forced across the river, still held the southern bank until dark when they withdrew to the 2nd Battalion's position.|$|E
5|$|However, {{interest}} in the Cleveland Bay was waning, due to increased mechanisation, and the Great Depression of the early 1930s reduced exports by almost a third. There was a brief revival of {{interest in}} the late 1930s in the United States when they became popular as foundation stock for hunters. The decline continued, quickening after the Second World War; in 1960 the War Office stopped offering premiums on stallions, and many breeders discontinued breeding. By 1962, only four purebred stallions were present in the UK. Queen Elizabeth II saved the breed by purchasing Mulgrave Supreme, a stallion <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> be sold to a buyer in the United States. The stallion was bred to pure- and part-bred mares, and within 15years there were 36purebred stallions in the UK. Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, used the breed for many years in international driving competitions. In the late 1960s and 1970s, {{interest in the}} breed increased, and part-bred Cleveland Bays were in demand for use as riding horses, especially for use as hunters and jumpers. In 1964, a Cleveland Bay/Thoroughbred cross competed in show jumping in the Tokyo Olympics. Another half-bred Cleveland Bay competed for the British Olympic team in show jumping at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics, while a third was a reserve mount for the Canadian show jumping team at the 1976 Montreal Olympics. In the late 1960s and '70s, horses continued to be exported to many countries. Japan, the United States and Australia have continued to import the horses from England, and in New Zealand crosses between Cleveland Bays and native mares were in demand on cattle and sheep stations.|$|E

25|$|These writings, {{only some}} of which have survived, are often {{misunderstood}} to describe a belief that the Ramchal and his followers were key figures in a messianic drama <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> take place.

25|$|In 1807, {{a famous}} duel {{took place at}} Ardcandrisk between John Colclough and William Alcock. The main cause was an {{election}} <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> be held – each being opposing candidates. Colclough was killed and a huge crowd subsequently attended his funeral at Tintern Abbey. This was mainly because the Colcloughs were generally popular and considered liberal landlords and also because Colclough was the people's candidate. The Colclough family had been granted the former Abbey (part of which they used as a dwelling) and its extensive lands in the mid-16th century.|$|E

25|$|The first coup d'état {{in modern}} Syrian history {{was carried out}} in March 1949 by an army officer from Aleppo, Hussni Zaim. However, lured by the {{absolute}} power he enjoyed as a dictator, Zaim soon developed a pro-Egyptian, pro-Western orientation and abandoned the cause of union with Iraq. This incited a second coup only four months after his. The second coup, led by Sami Hinnawi (also from Aleppo), empowered the Popular Party and actively sought to realize the union with Iraq. The news of an imminent union with Iraq incited a third coup the same year: in December 1949, Adib Shishakly led a coup preempting a union with Iraq <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> be declared.|$|E
25|$|From the start, Gullit's {{time with}} Galaxy was troublesome. Not well-versed in the intricacies and {{specifics}} of the MLS such as salary cap and draft rules, the Dutchman never adapted well to the North American league. The ill-fated January 2008 acquisition of left back Celestine Babayaro (who was brought in on Gullit's personal wishes before getting dismissed quickly and unceremoniously without even getting {{a chance to play}} any competitive matches due to extreme lack of commitment in pre-season) {{set the tone for the}} league campaign <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> start.

25|$|With 85,000 soldiers, Coburg {{began the}} Siege of Landrecies {{to start the}} 1794 campaign. Pichegru made two relief {{attempts}} but both were repulsed. On 26 April one of the columns commanded by René-Bernard Chapuy was crushed at the Battle of Beaumont-en-Cambresis by the Duke of York. In this fiasco, the French suffered losses of 7,000 killed, wounded and missing, plus 40 guns and 50 ammunition wagons taken. When Chapuy was made prisoner his captors found Pichegru's plan of campaign on his person. This outlined the attack <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> be carried out in Flanders. These Republican French failures led to the surrender of Landrecies on 30 April 1796. French losses in the siege amounted to 2,000 dead from enemy action or sickness and 5,000 captured.|$|E

The public demonstration used an operational DLR train, DLR P86 number 11, which was on loan from GEC Transportation Projects.

25|$|Anand (1971) followed, {{in which}} Bachchan starred {{alongside}} Rajesh Khanna. His {{role as a}} doctor with a cynical view of life garnered Bachchan his first Filmfare Best Supporting Actor award. He then played his first antagonist role as an infatuated lover-turned-murderer in Parwana (1971). Following Parwana were several films including Reshma Aur Shera (1971). During this time, he made a guest appearance in the film Guddi which starred his future wife Jaya Bhaduri. He narrated part of the film Bawarchi. In 1972 he made an appearance in the road action comedy Bombay to Goa directed by S. Ramanathan which was moderately successful.

25|$|As Price neared Kansas City, {{he learned}} that General Curtis' Army of the Border had {{assembled}} in and around Westport, and was blocking his way west. Furthermore, Pleasonton's cavalry division was pressing Price's rear, and was heavily engaged with elements of his force in Independence on the 22nd (see above). Price had nearly 500 wagons with him, and he required a good ford over the Big Blue River to facilitate the passage of his supplies. Byram's Ford was {{the best in the}} area, and thus became a strategic point during the fighting <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> ensue around Westport. On October 22, Blunt's Union division held a defensive position on the Big Blue River's west bank. Around 10:00 a.m., parts of Shelby's division conducted a frontal attack on Blunt's men. This attack was a ruse because the rest of Shelby's men flanked Blunt's hasty defenses, forcing the Federals to retire to Westport. Price's wagon train and about 5,000 head of cattle then crossed the Big Blue River at Byram's Ford and headed south toward Little Santa Fe and temporary safety.|$|E
