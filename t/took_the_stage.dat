5|$|At {{the foot}} of the climb, the leading group only had a small {{advantage}} over the peloton and were soon caught. There were no lead-out trains in the final kilometres, with fewer than 60 riders left in the group. Tosh Van der Sande (Lotto-Soudal) was the first to sprint, but Kristian Sbaragli (MTN-Qhubeka) came past him and <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> victory. Degenkolb was the quickest in the final metres, but he had been badly positioned and was only able to finish second. José Joaquín Rojas (Movistar) finished third. The stage was Sbaragli's first win in over two years. It was the second win of his career and the first in a Grand Tour.|$|E
5|$|Spears {{talked to}} CNN about her {{involvement}} {{during the development}} of the tour, stating that she had designed the entire tour herself, including costumes and concept.

Konietzko then returned to Hamburg, where he joined up with Peter Missing in his new band Missing Foundation. Drummer Nicklaus Schandelmaier, who had recently moved to Hamburg from Frankfurt, also joined the group, and <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> name En Esch.

5|$|Notable {{changes were}} made to give the {{ceremony}} a sleek, interactive look while shortening {{the length of the}} ceremony. Cates announced that in certain categories, all five nominees would be up onstage prior to the announcement of the award. In other instances, the actor or actress would present the award in the audience. In addition, production designer Roy Christopher designed an technologically ambitious stage for the telecast that both saluted the past while look toward the future. The set prominently featured 26 high-definition video monitors floating over the first twelve rows of the audience and a 40-foot LED screen situated beneath a layer of plexiglass on the stage floor. Both screens were used display images of previous Oscar appearances as presenters <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> or random film clips during several commercial breaks. A gold rod featuring 23 different life-sized Oscar statuettes spiraling upward was placed at center stage.|$|E
5|$|Stage 12 into Briançon in France was the Giro's first high {{mountain}} stage, and it shook up the standings {{for the final}} time. Di Luca <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> win, twice attacking from an elite group of five that had made the climb together. As Noè finished nearly ten minutes behind, Di Luca took the pink jersey for a third time, while still holding the green jersey. As Di Luca concentrated on winning the race overall, Piepoli took the green jersey after stage 15, the race's queen stage, topping two of that stage's climbs in first position. His lead in the mountains classification quickly became unassailable, and he won the jersey in Milan. It was also on this stage that 's Eddy Mazzoleni distinguished himself as a podium contender, taking {{a minute and a}} half out of Di Luca to move into second overall. Schleck lost time to Di Luca and Mazzoleni, but gained time over other riders in the top of the overall standings and stood third overall.|$|E

5|$|The {{eleventh}} {{stage was}} contested in rainy conditions on a winding course. After an unsuccessful breakaway attempt by fifteen riders, Maximilian Sciandri, LeMond, and Michele Coppolillo attacked {{and formed a}} group off the front. Sciandri and LeMond crossed the line in first and second, respectively, while Coppolillo was caught by the peloton in the closing meters of the stage. The next day saw the race's first mountain-top finish, to Monviso. The group of main contenders reached the final climb together, with 's Jean-François Bernard launching the first attack which saw him gain a maximum advantage of around thirty seconds. The next to make a serious effort was Lejarreta, who was followed by Chioccioli, Massimiliano Lelli, and Sierra, who attacked with ten kilometers left in the stage. The trio caught up to Bernard and rode as a group to the finish. Lelli <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> as Chioccioli defended his lead. Bugno lost almost two minutes during the day.|$|E

5|$|The event's tenth stage {{featured}} a summit finish to Monte Terminillo. The general classification contenders {{were all in}} a group together {{as they reached the}} final climb of the day. Piotr Ugrumov {{was the first of the}} group to attack and was joined by Roberto Conti shortly after. Behind, Indurain led a chase group that contained Andrew Hampsten, Chiappucci, Giovannetti, and Luis Herrera, while general classification hopefuls Chioccioli and Fignon dropped off the back since they could not keep pace. The group caught Conti, who was alone after Ugrumov slowed, and from there, Herrera attacked to win the stage. The next day's route was an undulating one. Chioccioli, Roberto Pagnin, and Marco Lietti formed a breakaway group and gained an advantage of three and a half minutes over the main field which was led by Indurain's team, Banesto. The group remained in front, Pagnin <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> victory, and Indurain finished over two minutes later. With around nine kilometers remaining in the twelfth stage, there was an accident that saw Chiappicci and Giovannetti amongst others go down. The peloton continued on, gearing up for a sprint finish that Leoni won.|$|E

5|$|The {{first stage}} began on 15 May and {{stretched}} from Rome to Florence. The racing {{that day was}} marred by heavy rain, which led to ten withdrawals. Carlo Galetti won the stage ahead of Giovanni Rossignoli and Dario Beni. The next leg was also dogged by rain and very poor conditions {{on the road and}} saw the climbing of the Colle de Bacco. Giovanni Gerbi was the first rider to summit the Colle de Bacco. The climb wore Gerbi out and he was caught and passed by three riders and ultimately finished fourth on the stage. Vincenzo Borgarello was the first rider to cross the finish line in Genoa and won the stage, where a large crowd waited for the riders to finish. Rossignoli took the race lead after finishing two positions in front of Galetti. The race's third day of racing was the first to have clear weather. Race leader Rossignoli bested the likes of Giovanni Gerbi and Carlo Durando to win the stage and consolidate his lead in the general classification. The next stage was hotly contested, with the peloton staying together for the whole stage as Carlo Galetti <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> win.|$|E
5|$|The sixteenth saw {{no major}} {{shifts in the}} general {{classification}}. The top five riders in the general classification formed a leading group on the final climb {{but there were no}} major moves to create time gaps. Lelli <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> win after ahead of Bugno. The following day was the last in the Dolomites and saw the ascension of five major climbs, including the Cima Coppi Passo Pordoi. On the second climbing of Pordoi, Chioccioli attacked and rode {{to the top of the}} climb to win the stage by thirty-eight seconds. Lejaretta crashed on the day and lost over six and a half minutes, putting him out of contention for the podium and overall victory. Midway through the stage, Fignon abandoned the race. The eighteenth day of racing was a transition stage. Several attempts were made to form a breakaway group before a group of eight were successful in creating a gap. The group was caught with five hundred meters to go by the chasing peloton which was setting up for a field sprint. Silvio Martinello managed to outsprint the likes of Cipollini and Abdoujaparov to win the day.|$|E
