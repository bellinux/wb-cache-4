5|$|Scholars {{have also}} seen the novel as expressing <b>the</b> <b>values</b> <b>and</b> ideas of the Free Will Movement.

In contrast to Ophelia is Dinah, who operates on passion. During {{the course of the}} novel Ophelia is transformed, just as the Republican Party (three years later) proclaimed that the North must transform itself and stand up for its antislavery principles.|$|E

Second, the shocks to investment technology, {{as a main}} determinant of the external finance premium, explain <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> momentum premiums.

25|$|Parental {{views are}} perhaps the most {{essential}} factor in determining the socialization process which shapes new members of society. <b>The</b> <b>values</b> <b>and</b> standards used in child rearing are commonly closely related to the parent's occupational status. Parents from the professional class tend to raise their children to become curious independent thinkers, while working class parents raise their children to have a more communal perspective with a strong respect for authority. Middle class parents tend to emphasize internal standards and values while working class parents emphasize external values.|$|E

25|$|Feminist {{psychology}} {{is a form}} of psychology centered on societal structures and gender. Feminist psychology critiques the fact that historically psychological research has been done from a male perspective with the view that males are the norm. Feminist {{psychology is}} oriented on <b>the</b> <b>values</b> <b>and</b> principles of feminism. It incorporates gender and the ways women are affected by issues resulting from it. Ethel Dench Puffer Howes {{was one of the first}} women to enter the field of psychology. She was the Executive Secretary of the National College Equal Suffrage League in 1914.|$|E
25|$|According to its supporters, {{any attempt}} to solve global {{problems}} is undemocratic without some form of cosmopolitan democracy. The general principle of cosmopolitan democracy is to expand {{some or all of}} <b>the</b> <b>values</b> <b>and</b> norms of democracy, including the rule of law; the non-violent resolution of conflicts; and equality among citizens, beyond the limits of the state. To be fully implemented, this would require reforming existing international organisations, e.g. the United Nations, as well as the creation of new institutions such as a World Parliament, which ideally would enhance public control over, and accountability in, international politics.|$|E
