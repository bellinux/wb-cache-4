5|$|After an {{incident}} involving sentries on the Greek-Bulgarian border in October 1925, fighting began {{between the two}} countries. Three days after the initial incident, Greek troops invaded Bulgaria. The Bulgarian government ordered its troops to make only token resistance, and evacuated between ten thousand and fifteen thousand people from the border region, trusting the League <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> <b>the</b> <b>dispute.</b> The League condemned the Greek invasion, and called for both Greek withdrawal and compensation to Bulgaria.|$|E
5|$|Dunderdale also {{announced}} soon after being sworn {{in that she}} wanted to end a year-long strike on the Burin Peninsula that involved 15 home care workers. The government had been called on <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> <b>the</b> <b>dispute</b> but had refused to get involved seeing the workers are not direct employees of provincial government. Within 5 days of taking office Dunderdale's government reached an agreement with the workers which they unanimously accepted ending the 377-day strike.|$|E
5|$|In April 1864, Brazil sent Minister Plenipotentiary José Antônio Saraiva to {{negotiate}} with Atanasio Aguirre, who had succeeded Berro in Uruguay. Saraiva made an initial attempt <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> <b>the</b> <b>dispute</b> between Blancos and Colorados. Faced with Aguirre's intransigence regarding Flores' demands, the Brazilian diplomat abandoned the effort and sided with the Colorados. On 10 August 1864, after a Brazilian ultimatum was refused, Saraiva declared that Brazil's military would begin exacting reprisals. Brazil declined to acknowledge a formal state of war, {{and for most of}} its duration, the Uruguayan–Brazilian armed conflict was an undeclared war.|$|E

5|$|It was {{becoming}} clear that federal intervention was required <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> <b>the</b> <b>dispute,</b> despite the general {{policy of the}} Grant administration {{to stay out of}} the affairs of Southern states. The President often expressed annoyance with Southern governors who requested help from federal troops to combat regular waves of election year violence, with little compassion for the issues they faced. Grant and the United States Attorney General, George Henry Williams, issued a joint communique supporting Baxter and ordering Brooks to vacate the capitol. They also referred the dispute back to the State Legislature.|$|E
5|$|The French {{proposal}} {{was met with}} strong opposition from governing bodies representing the other Gordon Bennett nations, and at the instigation of Germany {{a meeting of the}} bodies was organised <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> <b>the</b> <b>dispute.</b> Although the delegates rejected the French model for the 1905 race, to avoid deadlock they agreed to use the new system of limits for the 1906 race. But when Théry and Richard-Brasier won again in 1905, and the responsibility for organising the 1906 race fell once more to the ACF, the French ended the Gordon Bennett races and organised their own event as a replacement, the Grand Prix de l'Automobile Club de France.|$|E
5|$|At Survivor Series 1993, Owen Hart was {{eliminated}} during a elimination match when he crashed into his brother Bret Hart, who was {{walking along the}} ring apron, causing Owen to lose his focus and be pinned by Michaels. After the match, Owen interrupted his brothers’ victory celebration to verbally attack Bret. He demanded a match with Bret <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> <b>the</b> <b>dispute.</b> Bret refused, and the brothers reunited over the Christmas holidays. They decided to focus their energy on taking the tag team title from the Quebecers. Their plan was temporarily put on hold when Marty Jannetty and the 1-2-3 Kid won the belts, but the Quebecers won a rematch the following week, guaranteeing that the Harts would get their title shot.|$|E

5|$|Production did not recommence and the Hoover {{production}} line remained closed permanently. On 19 September 1985, Sinclair Vehicles {{changed its name}} to TPD Limited, with a direct subsidiary named Sinclair Vehicles Sales Limited continuing to sell C5s. TPD only lasted until 15 October, when it was placed into receivership. The receivers announced that 4,500 C5s had been sold by Sinclair Vehicles, with another 4,500 remaining in the company's hands. £7.75 million was reportedly owed to creditors, of which £7 million was owed to Sir Clive Sinclair himself in reflection of his personal investment in the project. Hoover was not among the creditors, as Sinclair had managed <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> <b>the</b> <b>dispute</b> on terms that neither company would reveal.|$|E
5|$|Following lengthy {{discussions between}} Royal Mail {{managers}} and union representatives a deal <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> <b>the</b> <b>dispute</b> was {{finally agreed to}} on 8 March 2010. This would see Royal Mail workers receiving a 6.9% pay rise over three years (worth 2% in 2010, 1.4% in 2011 and 3.5% in 2012), while extra payments worth up to £1,400 would be made to full-time workers once all the agreed changes have been made. These will {{take the form of}} a £400 payment following the agreement of union members and a further £1,000 to be paid once the planned changes have been implemented. In addition the Royal Mail agreed to keep 75% of the workforce as full-time, rather than part-time staff, and to reduce working hours from 40 to 39 hours a week. In exchange, the CWU agreed to Royal Mail's modernisation strategy which include plans to introduce the automated walk sequencing machinery.|$|E
5|$|In 1349, John plundered a Venetian {{commercial}} ship {{which had}} been shipwrecked on the coast he controlled, {{in accordance with the}} medieval principle of jus naufragii. This act necessitated the involvement of Stephen Dušan in order <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> <b>the</b> <b>dispute</b> between Venice and John, as evidenced by an official document from 13 April 1350. Despite this conflict, under John the Principality of Valona was an active partner of Venice and Ragusa (modern Dubrovnik) in maritime commerce. Two receipts from 27 April 1350 document John's role as a mediator in cattle, sugar and pepper trade and reveal that he received significant income from the Valona customs. The customs was profitable because the port was often visited by merchant ships. Even though all of these documents were written in Slavic, John signed his name in Greek, which testifies to his Hellenisation. At the time, John also had ties with the Mamluk rulers of Egypt, who addressed him as “King of Serbia and Bulgaria” in correspondence.|$|E
50|$|The {{town was}} the scene of two parliaments held by the Latin Emperor Henry of Flanders, one in 1209 to receive the {{submission}} of the rebellious Crusader lords of the Kingdom of Thessalonica and southern Greece, and the second in 1210 <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> <b>the</b> <b>disputes</b> between <b>the</b> Crusader lords and the Roman Catholic Church prelates in Greece.|$|R

5|$|The Beagle {{conflict}} {{was still an}} unresolved problem with Chile, despite the 1978 Papal mediation. The military, troubled by {{the trial of the}} juntas, called for rejection of the proposed agreement and a continuation of the country's claim over the islands. Alfonsín called for a referendum <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> <b>the</b> <b>dispute.</b> Despite opposition from the military and the Justicialist party, who called for abstention, support for the resolution referendum reached 82%. The bill passed in the Senate by a single vote majority, as the PJ maintained its resistance. The Treaty of Peace and Friendship of 1984 between Chile and Argentina was signed the following year, ending the conflict. The human rights violations committed by the Chilean president Augusto Pinochet remained a contentious issue, as well as the revelation of Chilean help to British forces during the Falklands War. The Argentine church invited Pope John Paul II for a second visit to Argentina in 1987, to celebrate his successful mediation. He celebrated World Youth Day next to the Obelisk of Buenos Aires, and gave a mass at the Basilica of Our Lady of Luján.|$|E
5|$|Pedrarias {{travelled}} from Panama {{to take up}} {{his command}} of Nicaragua, and was greeted everywhere as the rightful governor. López de Salcedo attempted to leave the province and return to Honduras but was prevented by his rival's supporters. Pedrarias arrested López de Salcedo in March 1528 and forced him to relinquish some of his territory, although the Spanish monarch later rejected the settlement. Pedrarias kept López de Salcedo prisoner for almost a year. He released him after coming to an agreement with mediators, in which the jurisdictional limits of Honduras were defined by the Caribbean coast extending from Puerto de Caballos {{in the west to}} Cabo Gracias a Dios in the east and extending inland {{in the form of a}} triangle. This agreement effectively settled all jurisdictional disputes with Nicaragua; border disputes with Guatemala remained a problem. López de Salcedo returned to Honduras early in 1529 as a broken man; he was unable <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> <b>the</b> <b>dispute</b> between Méndez de Hinostrosa and Vasco de Herrera, and was held in contempt by many residents of Trujillo. In order to reestablish his reputation, he organised a large expedition to settle the Naco valley, where gold had been discovered. López de Salcedo, weakened by his ordeals, did not live to lead the expedition; he died early in 1530.|$|E
5|$|The {{agreement}} drafted {{between the}} French and Malagasy governments did not clearly establish a French protectorate over the island, partly because recent French military setbacks in the Tonkin Campaign {{had begun to}} turn popular opinion against French colonial expansion. The Malagasy crown agreed to pay ten million francs to France <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> <b>the</b> <b>dispute,</b> a sum that was partly raised through the unpopular decision to increase fanampoana (forced labor in lieu of cash taxes) to mobilize the populace in panning for gold in the kingdom's rivers. This expense, coupled with Rainilaiarivony's removal of $50,000 in silver and gold coins from the tomb of Ranavalona I to offset the cost of purchasing arms {{in the run-up to}} the First Franco-Hova War, effectively emptied the royal treasury reserves. Capitalizing on Madagascar's weakened position, the French government then occupied the port town of Antsiranana and installed French Resident-General Le Myre de Vilers in Antananarivo, citing vague sections of the treaty as justification. The Resident-General was empowered by the French government to control international trade and foreign affairs on the island, although the monarchy's authority over internal administration was left unchallenged. Refusing to acknowledge the validity of the French interpretation of the treaty, Rainilaiarivony continued managing trade and international relations and unsuccessfully solicited assistance from the United States in maintaining the island's sovereignty. In 1894, the French government pressed Rainilaiarivony to unconditionally accept the status of Madagascar as a French protectorate. In response, Rainilaiarivony broke off all diplomatic relations with France in November 1894.|$|E
50|$|A {{few days}} after his detention, six other people (from the Czech Republic, Ireland, Germany, Denmark, and the US) were {{detained}} and fined.

25|$|It is {{a matter}} of some dispute how much credit Dirichlet deserves for the modern {{definition}} of a function, in part because he restricted his definition to continuous functions....I believe Dirichlet defined the notion of continuous function {{to make it clear that}} no rule or law is required even in the case of continuous functions, not just in general.

St. Philip's insisted it retained title to the land (now at the junction of US Route 9, NY Route 403 and the Appalachian Trail) and it took an act of the state legislature <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> <b>the</b> <b>dispute</b> in favor of the friars.
