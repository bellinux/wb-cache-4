Season three of Enterprise features an ongoing story following an attack on Earth by previously unknown aliens called the Xindi. In this episode, Captain Jonathan Archer (Scott Bakula) attempts to convince the Xindi Council not to use their superweapon on Earth.

5|$|Mick St. John, {{a private}} investigator, dreams of being interviewed {{by a woman}} off-camera, where he reveals that he is 90 years old, and that unlike other vampires, he has {{standards}} and does not hunt women, children or innocents. Mick's job leads him {{to the scene of}} the murder of a young woman, where Beth, a reporter for the online newspaper BuzzWire, notices two large puncture wounds on the woman's neck. While walking around the scene, she meets Mick and tells him he looks very familiar, but he insists that they do not know each other. Beth gives the murder article a vampire theme, using the puncture wounds as inspiration. The article makes Josef, a 400-year-old vampire friend of Mick's, concerned for the safety of vampires. <b>To</b> <b>get</b> <b>more</b> <b>information</b> on the murder, Mick goes to the morgue, where his friend Guillermo (Jacob Vargas) supplies him with blood. Mick does not detect any traces of vampire contact on the dead woman, eliminating them as her reason of death.

Shiva, the fabled {{savior of the}} land of Meluha, rushes to save his wife Sati from the Naga, the {{supposed}} killer of Shiva's friend Brahaspati. The Naga escapes, leaving behind coins with strange engravings. After consulting with Sati's father Daksha and Dilipa, the king of Ayodhya, they come to know that the coin belongs to King Chandraketu, the ruler {{of the land of}} Branga in eastern India. Shiva and Sati travel to Kashi, where a community of Brangas inhabit, in order <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>more</b> <b>information</b> on the Nagas. They are accompanied in their journey by Shiva's General Parvateshwar, his associates Nandi and Veerbhadra, Ayurvati the doctor, and Bhagirath and Anandamayi, the prince and princess of Ayodhya. At Kashi, Parvateshwar gets mortally injured while trying to pacify a riot at the Branga community. The Branga leader Divodas administers a medicine on Parvateshwar; it works and the General is healed, but Shiva comes to know from Ayurvati that it contains herbs which is only available at Panchavati, the capital of the Nagas. He consults with Divodas and comes to know that Branga suffers from a mortal plague, which has led them to ally with the Nagas, in return for benefits. Shiva decides to travel to Branga but Divodas informs him that to reach there special ships need to be made, which would take about six months.|$|E

25|$|The timing flaw {{consisted}} of performing two tasks simultaneously—compressing previously acquired data to release space for more data, {{and making a}} second copy of the approach command sequence—that together overloaded the spacecraft's primary computer.

The distress call was received the afternoon of July 4, which alerted engineers {{that they needed to}} contact the spacecraft <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>more</b> <b>information</b> and resolve the issue. The resolution was that the problem happened as part of preparations for the approach, and was not expected to happen again because no similar tasks were planned {{for the remainder of the}} encounter.|$|E

He is {{responsible}} for historical negationism; he rewrites records and alters photographs {{to conform to the}} state's ever-changing version of history itself, rendering the deleted people [...] "unpersons"; the original documents are destroyed by fire in a [...] "memory hole". At work, he re-writes a Times article reporting on a government official condemned as a thoughtcriminal by writing a story on a nonexistent war hero named [...] "Comrade Ogilvy", and notes the state-sponsored media reporting an increase in the chocolate ration during an actual decrease. Despite his proficiency in his profession, Winston becomes mesmerized by the true past after seeing a photograph of three former high-ranking upper class Inner Party officials in New York, discounting the official government account that they had been collaborating with Eurasian officials. Winston tries <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>more</b> <b>information</b> about the true past, and purchases an old journal in an antiques shop in a proletarian neighborhood of London. In a place beside his flat's telescreen where he believes he cannot be seen, he begins writing a journal criticizing the Party and its enigmatic leader, Big Brother. By doing so, he commits a crime that, if discovered by the Thought Police, warrants certain death, and Winston quickly resigns himself {{to the fact that he}} will eventually be arrested for thoughtcrime. In the journal, he records his sexual frustration over a young woman maintaining the novel-writing machines at the ministry named Julia, whom Winston is attracted to but suspects is an informant. He also suspects that his superior, an Inner Party official named O'Brien, is a secret agent for an enigmatic underground resistance movement known as the Brotherhood, a group formed by Big Brother's reviled political rival Emmanuel Goldstein.|$|E
2500|$|The earlier graves at Indian Knoll {{were found}} down to five {{feet into the}} sand, with the more recent burials inside the shell midden. The deepest were better {{preserved}} {{as a result of}} the moist sand, even some of the bony tissues and infant skeletons remained intact. The grave structure was usually small, round, and filled in with black midden debris. The burials inside the midden showed no sign of formal walls, thus it is likely that individuals were placed in shallow depressions and filled in with the surrounding shell midden. Many of the skeletons placed in shallow graves, especially the skulls, were crushed and shown signs of disturbance. Most of the skeletons were found in tight coiled positions, which indicates the bodies may have been wrapped, [...] though there are a few instances of being placed sitting up, with even less fully extended [...] The large number of [...] burials caused graves to intrude into others accidentally, though multiple burials were common practice during the time the shell midden formed [...] between [...] the years 5500 and 2000 BC. [...] Multiple burials were also typically circular, but larger and lacked grave goods except for single projectile points near the chest cavities, which suggest violence near time of death. [...] Many skeletons were found dismembered, either unintentionally or as an act of mutilation. If a grave happened to be dug intruding [...] another, the original body may have become dismembered, but normally the bones would have been piled up and reburied. Occasionally pieces, such as skulls or limbs, were not recovered, which Robert Mensforth considered evidence for warfare and trophy taking. Grave goods were found within 187 burials, though shell beads, used for personal adornments or sewed on garments, were not counted as a deliberate grave goods in one study. The artifacts commonly associated with graves include pestles, hammerstones, grooved axes, projectile points with a few cases of copper and stone vessels.
