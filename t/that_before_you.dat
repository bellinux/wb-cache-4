2500|$|The radical {{nature of}} Kurzweil's {{predictions}} is often discussed. Anthony Doerr says <b>that</b> <b>before</b> <b>you</b> [...] "dismiss it as techno-zeal" [...] consider that [...] "every day {{the line between}} what is human {{and what is not}} quite human blurs a bit more". He lists technology of the day, in 2006, like computers that land supersonic airplanes or in vitro fertility treatments and asks whether brain implants that access the internet or robots in our blood really are that unbelievable.|$|E
2500|$|For a {{very simple}} example that captures {{the essence of the}} {{description}} above, [...] draw a circle on a flat sheet of paper. [...] Travel around the circle at a constant speed. [...] The derivative of your velocity, your acceleration vector, always points radially inward. [...] Roll this sheet of paper into a cylinder. [...] Now the (Euclidean) derivative of your velocity has a component that sometimes points inward toward the axis of the cylinder depending on whether you're near a solstice or an equinox. (At the point of the circle when you are moving parallel to the axis, there is no inward acceleration. At the point, the velocity is along the cylinder's bend, the inward acceleration is maximum.) [...] This is the (Euclidean) normal component. The covariant derivative component is the component parallel to the cylinder's surface, and is the same as <b>that</b> <b>before</b> <b>you</b> rolled the sheet into a cylinder.|$|E
2500|$|In December 1840, Thiers helped {{secure the}} {{election}} of Victor Hugo to the Académie Française, despite the opposition of the more conservative members. Hugo was accepted only on the fifth ballot, by a single vote. When elected, Hugo sent {{a copy of his}} new poem about Napoleon to Thiers, declaring to Thiers that Thiers was [...] "a man I honor and love; your spirit is one of those that seduces my own. One feels <b>that</b> <b>before</b> <b>you</b> entered the world of great affairs, you traversed that of great ideas. With my full sympathy, high estime and vivid admiration." [...] From 1840 through 1844, Thiers traveled around Europe, crisscrossing Holland, Germany, Switzerland and Spain and visiting he battlefields where Napoleon fought and meeting people who had witnessed them. In the meanwhile, his chief political rival, Guizot, the leader of the right wing in the Deputies, headed the government. He called new elections in July 1846, which Guizot's party narrowly won, with 266 seats of 449. However, in an ominous sign, ten of the twelve deputies from Paris opposed the government. As the King's [...] unpopularity grew, he suffered also a personal tragedy with great political implications; [...] his son, the heir to the throne, was killed in an accident. His grandson, the new heir, was only a child.|$|E
