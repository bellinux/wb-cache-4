40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{a common}} problem faced by those designing Less Than Truckload (LTL) delivery and pickup routes. Specifically, next day service for an LTL firm involves making the previous day's deliveries followed by <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>day's</b> pickups. If all information is known in advance, this is an instance of the general pickup and delivery problem [22].

5|$|Woodruff's {{contributions}} to surgery were important and long-lasting. In addition to performing the first kidney transplant in the UK, he devised {{a method of}} implanting a transplanted ureter in the bladder during transplants that is still used today. Furthermore, he established a large, efficient transplant unit in Edinburgh that {{remains one of the}} world's best. Although best known for these clinical accomplishments, Woodruff's {{contributions to}} the study of rejection and tolerance induction were equally important. Among these contributions, Woodruff's work with anti-lymphocyte serum has led to its wide use to reduce rejection symptoms in organ transplant recipients up to <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>day.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{program had}} some loose ends that {{manifested}} themselves later. Many refugees were not economically integrated and lived from government handouts. Critics {{noted that the}} refugees had become a special interest group that fostered resentment. The COMIGAL officials often decided not to split up refugees belonging to the same village, hoping to maintain social continuity. In some cases, Catholic priests refused to obey government directives to settle in certain areas. Many of the refugees also refused to relocate from the camps {{on the outskirts of}} the capital, wanting to live an urban lifestyle, and objecting to Diem's desire that they help developed inhospitable frontier territory where disease was more common and the economy less developed. On occasions, the reluctance to disperse away from Saigon resulted in protests outside Diem's residence. Many Catholic villages were effectively transplanted into southern territory. This was efficient in the short run but meant that they would never assimilate into southern society. They had little contact with the Buddhist majority and often held them in contempt, sometimes flying the Vatican flag instead of the national flag. Peter Hansen, an Australian Catholic priest and academic scholar of religion, has added that tensions between northern and southern Catholics were also present, due to issues of regionalism and local traditions. Hansen also said that northern Catholics took a more defensive attitude towards other religions than their southern co-religionists, and were more likely to see non-Catholics as a threat. He further noted that northern Catholics had a more theocratic outlook in that they were more willing to listen to the advice of priests on a wide range of issues, not only spiritual and ecclesiastical matters. These differences and the sense of segregation persist to <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>day.</b>|$|E

40|$|USDAs Risk Management Agency (RMA) offered {{livestock}} {{producers in}} selected pilot states, including Nebraska, a new insurance product in 2003 called Livestock Risk Protection (LRP).

Premiums for LRP insurance changed daily and depended on current market prices and market volatility. Unlike put option premiums that change based on <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>day’s</b> futures trade, LRP premiums were determined using the previous days futures and options prices. Since LRP could be purchased until 8 : 00 p. m. based on the previous day’s prices, it created an opportunity for adverse selection by enabling producers to purchase price insurance after knowing how <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>day’s</b> price changed. In cases where market prices decreased (increased) today, the same LRP insurance would be more (less) expensive tomorrow...|$|R
