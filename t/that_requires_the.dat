5|$|The {{forewings}} {{are short}} oblong leathery plates {{used to cover}} the hindwings like the elytra of a beetle, rather than to fly. Most species have short and leather-like forewings with very thin hindwings, though species in the former suborders Arixeniina and Hemimerina (epizoic species, sometimes considered as ectoparasites) are wingless and blind with filiform segmented cerci (today these are both included merely as families in the suborder Neodermaptera). The hindwing is a very thin membrane that expands like a fan, radiating from one point folded under the forewing. Even though most earwigs have wings and are capable of flight, they are rarely seen in flight. These wings are unique in venation and {{in the pattern of}} folding <b>that</b> <b>requires</b> <b>the</b> use of the cerci.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} the endomembrane system {{is linked to the}} origin of eukaryotes {{themselves}} and the origin of eukaryoties to the endosymbiotic origin of mitochondria. Many models have been put forward to explain the {{origin of the}} endomembrane system (reviewed in). The most recent concept suggests that the endomembrane system evolved from outer membrane vesicles the endosymbiotic mitochondrion secreted. This OMV-based model for the origin of the endomembrane system is currently the one <b>that</b> <b>requires</b> <b>the</b> least amount of novel inventions at eukaryote origin and explains the many connections of mitochondria with other compartments of the cell.|$|E
5|$|Most puzzles {{are located}} on {{recognizable}} eye-level panels scattered around the island, often connected with power cables that light up once a puzzle is solved and guiding the player to the next puzzle. Some puzzles incorporate the game's architecture, such as one <b>that</b> <b>requires</b> <b>the</b> player to view background elements through a semi-transparent puzzle panel to determine the solution. There are also non-obvious puzzles built into the environment itself, requiring the player to find the correct vantage point to complete the puzzle. At any time, the player can engage the maze-drawing mode, which {{is marked by a}} white border on screen. While in this mode, the player's avatar is prevented from moving and instead allows the player to use their controls to trace the path through a presented maze. The mode ends once the player solves the puzzle or cancels the mode. Normally, this mode is activated in front of a panel, moving the player's view directly to the panel to solve it, {{but it can also be}} activated at any other time to engage those puzzles that are based on vantage points. Nearly all puzzles provide immediate feedback if they have been solved correctly or not through sound effects or visual indication.|$|E

5|$|Proteins are {{targeted}} for degradation by the proteasome with covalent modification of a lysine residue <b>that</b> <b>requires</b> <b>the</b> coordinated reactions of three enzymes. In the first step, a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (known as E1) hydrolyzes ATP and adenylylates a ubiquitin molecule. This is {{then transferred to}} E1's active-site cysteine residue {{in concert with the}} adenylylation of a second ubiquitin. This adenylylated ubiquitin is then transferred to a cysteine of a second enzyme, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2). In the last step, a member of a highly diverse class of enzymes known as ubiquitin ligases (E3) recognizes the specific protein to be ubiquitinated and catalyzes the transfer of ubiquitin from E2 to this target protein. A target protein must be labeled with at least four ubiquitin monomers (in the form of a polyubiquitin chain) before it is recognized by the proteasome lid. It is therefore the E3 that confers substrate specificity to this system. The number of E1, E2, and E3 proteins expressed depends on the organism and cell type, but there are many different E3 enzymes present in humans, indicating that there is a huge number of targets for the ubiquitin proteasome system.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of the unsuitability of {{microbiological}} techniques, milk pasteurization efficacy is typically monitored by checking for the presence of alkaline phosphatase, which is denatured by pasteurization.

For this reason, presence of alkaline phosphatase is an ideal indicator of pasteurization efficacy.|$|E

25|$|Leading off of (25)'s {{inability}} to have third and first person features, Kratzer {{builds on the}} idea that third person features may be gender features instead of person features. The subset principle, which determines that a word can be inserted into a position it may not belong in as long as subsets of the features in the position match the word, allows the introduction of first, second or third person features in relative pronouns. First, second, and third person features can thus have gender features, which in turn would account for a verbal agreement <b>that</b> <b>requires</b> <b>the</b> word following subset principle to obey.|$|E

25|$|The {{police force}} of the Netherlands is divided into 25 {{regional}} forces and one central force. A Regional Police Board, made up of local mayors and the chief public prosecutor, heads each regional force, with a chief officer placed in charge of police operations. Police accountability procedures include the mandatory reporting of any incident during the discharge of duty <b>that</b> <b>requires</b> <b>the</b> use of force. The Rijksrecherche is the national agency responsible for the investigation of serious breaches of police conduct resulting in death or injury. In 2007 the Rijksrecherche conducted 67 inquiries related to police officers, 21 of which were for shooting incidents.|$|E
25|$|Concerning {{agriculture}} and silviculture, varying climatic {{conditions of the}} area have created a favorable environment {{for the development of}} agriculture, this being the second branch, as share and importance, in the economy of the county. An important role in this economic sector holds zootechnics, but crop production has also a significant share. Both vegetal and animal sector go through a period of transition characterized by reduced production from year to year, a situation <b>that</b> <b>requires</b> <b>the</b> adoption of measures to stimulate the recovery of agriculture. The importance of agriculture lies in the existence of the University of Agricultural Sciences and Veterinary Medicine that annually licenses more than 2,000 graduates, specialists in all fields of agriculture.|$|E
25|$|Because {{conversion}} of one tree to another by a {{minimum number of}} SPR operations is NP-Hard, solving the problem becomes considerably more difficult as more nodes are considered. The computational challenge lies in finding the optimal edit path, i.e., the one <b>that</b> <b>requires</b> <b>the</b> fewest steps, and different strategies are used in solving the problem. For example, the HorizStory algorithm reduces the problem by first eliminating the consistent nodes; recursive pruning and regrafting reconciles the reference tree with the gene tree and optimal edits are interpreted as HGT events. The SPR methods included in the supertree reconstruction package SPRSupertrees substantially decrease {{the time of the}} search for the optimal set of SPR operations by considering multiple localised sub-problems in large trees through a clustering approach.|$|E
