40|$|This paper {{presents}} a theoretical {{study of the}} process of damping of nonlinear vibrations in a two-mass model of a mechanical system with a <b>torsion</b> <b>damper.</b> The steady-state motion of the system subject to har-monic excitation is considered on the assumption of a uniform frequency and constant amplitude of the forcing torque. Simultaneous structural friction phenomena (passive damping) and the piezoelectric effect (active damping) are been considered as well. The problem is considered on the assumption of a uniform unit pressure distribution between the contac-ting surfaces of the friction discs and plunger.

40|$|The thesis {{comprises}} six {{papers with}} the overall theme of measurement, assessment and control of diesel engine noise, with an emphasize on control. The radiation of noise is shown {{to be dominated by}} {{the low end of the}} engine sides and by the engine front. The mode shapes of the crankcase, the oil sump and the timing transmission cover are investigated. The vibrations are measured and analysed through running mode, modal analyses and SEA. The noise radiation is explored in detail with near-field measurements of sound intensity. In the engine front, the noise radiation is shown to have contributions from the timing casing, the oil-sump front and the crankshaft torsion vibration damper. The radiation from the <b>torsion</b> <b>damper</b> is analysed by a regression analysis of measured intensity data and the vibrations of the damper are investigated with a laser-doppler vibrometer. The results show that the damper vibrates in the axial directions with vibration modes that both radiate noise and interfere with the radiation from the engine structure. It is shown that there in the engine front are strong coupled vibration modes between the timing cover and the oil sump front m the frequency range 500 Hz - 1 kHz. The importance of the strong vibration modes in the crankcase and the oil-sump sides is shown. The propagation paths of noise and vibration to the engine front have been examined with an SEA powerflow analysis and by opening the front cover to measure the sound power from the timing gears. The main excitations of the front cover are found to be by engine block vibrations below 1. 25 kHz and by tuning gears noise above 2 kHz. Various constructions to control the noise are tested. Two stiffeners are designed and tested to reduce vibrations m the engine low end, one ladder frame introducing stiffness at the crankcase flange and one bearing beam introducing stiffness at the main bearing caps. The stiffeners have hem evaluated by sound intensity measurements and mobility measurements. The ladder frame gave good noise reductions but the bearing beam merely caused frequency shifts of the bearing modes. A decoupling of the oil sump resulted in significant noise and vibration reductions. The timing cover is modified by increasing the damping and by decrease the radiation efficiency. Various interior panels are tested, like plexiglass and aluminium panels of different thicknesses, a rubber damping layer and a combined rubber/steel-sheet damping layer. A thin plastic sheet has low radiation efficiency and may thereby lower the noise emission. A slightly improved model for calculation of radiation efficiency of small irregularly shaped plates is suggested. The traditional SEA prediction model is shown to be ill-conditioned for engine applications. An improved model using geometric averaging is suggested and evaluated. The results show that the new SEA model is working well for frequencies down to 800 Hz for predictions of damping treatments, decoupling of the oil sump and for power-flow determinations. The concept of equivalent mass is found valuable and validations are made according to the consistency and reciprocity theories. A hemi-anechoic engine laboratory is constructed and evaluated. New efficient low-cost diffusing absorbers have been designed, the performance is evaluated with standard deviation analysis of sound pressure measurements. The performance of the absorbers is found to be compeatable with much more expensive commercial designs. Measured sound intensity in three-dimensional vectors is a powerful tool to identify and illustrate sound fields. When used in near-fields to identify complex noise sources large errors may occur. It is shown that the low relative levels of vector components and the reactivity of the sound field give large errors m repeated measurements. Analyses and comparisons are performed on a simple source and on an engine. A two- and a six-microphone probe were used that were hand-held and robot-controlled. It is concluded dig in point-intensity measurements on engineering noise sources, a 4 - 6 microphone probe and a precision positioner should be used to get reliable measurements.

Using an experimentally validated model for torsion thrust stand motion, an optimized diagnostic tool was designed to measure the expected performance values for the thruster. A thrust stand has been developed to simultaneously measure the shot by shot total impulse and propellant mass loss of the thruster, yielding a per shot specific impulse. The optimized system is capable of measuring total impulses up to 150 mN-s with a resolution of 0. 4 mN-s and mass losses up to 18 g with a resolution of 1 mg. Another thrust stand has been notionally designed capable of measuring the time dependant impulse profile of the thruster with microsecond resolution.

50|$|Post-war {{the use of}} {{torsion bar}} front {{suspension}} was {{a defining feature of}} British Morris cars, starting with the Morris Minor of 1948, its larger Morris Oxford MO counterpart and the upmarket Morris Six MS, plus the Wolseley-badged upmarket variants of the latter two models. The designer of these cars, Alec Issigonis, was inspired by the Traction Avant's suspension, although the Morris cars were rear-wheel drive and used conventional leaf springs for their rear axles. The Minor used lever arm dampers with its torsion bars while the Oxford and the Six used innovative telescopic dampers. The Minor remained in production largely unchanged until 1972 and was replaced by the Morris Marina which also used the <b>torsion</b> bar-lever arm <b>damper</b> system for its front suspension—one of the last new cars worldwide to be introduced with the system and which remained in production until 1984. The Oxford/Six platform was developed through several revised series which used Issigonis' torsion bar system until 1959 when the new Farina Oxford was introduced using front suspension with coil springs, lower wishbones and lever arm dampers.|$|R
40|$|Turbo {{generator}} shafts {{are often}} subjected to cyclic torsion resulting in formation of large longitudinal cracks {{as well as}} circumferential cracks. The presence of these cracks could greatly impact the shaft resonance frequencies. In this paper, dynamic response of a shaft with longitudinal and circumferential cracks is investigated through a comprehen-sive analytical study. The longitudinally cracked section of the shaft was modeled as an uncracked shaft with reduced torsional rigidity. Torsional rigidity correction factor (i. e., the ratio of torsional rigidity of the cracked shaft {{to that of the}} uncracked shaft) was obtained from finite element analysis and was shown to be only a function of crack depth to the shaft radius. The resonance frequency and frictional energy loss of a shaft with a longitudinal crack were found little affected by the presence of the crack as long as the crack depth was less than 20 % of the shaft radius even if the entire shaft is cracked longi-tudinally. Moreover, we showed that the longitudinal crack location could be more con-veniently identified by monitoring the slope of the torsional response along the shaft. The circumferential crack was modeled as a torsional spring with a torsional <b>damping.</b> The <b>torsion</b> spring and <b>damping</b> constants were obtained using fracture mechanics. For a shaft with both a longitudinal crack and a circumferential crack, the resonance frequency was governed by the longitudinal crack when the circumferential crack depth was less than 30 % of the shaft radius.

40|$|This thesis {{develops}} a finite element based dynamic modeling method for design {{and analysis of}} compliant mechanisms which transfer input force, displacement and energy through elastic deformations. Most published analyses have largely based on quasi-static and lump-parameter models neglecting the effects of <b>damping,</b> <b>torsion,</b> complex geometry, and nonlinearity of deformable contacts. For applications such as handling of objects by the robotic hands with multiple high-damped compliant fingers, {{there is a need}} for a dynamic model capable of analyzing the flexible multibody system. This research begins with the formulation of the explicit dynamic finite element method (FEM) which takes into account the effects of damping, complex geometry and contact nonlinearity. The numerical stability is considered by evaluating the critical time step in terms of material properties and mesh quality. A general framework incorporating explicit dynamic FEM, topology optimization, modal analysis, and damping identification has been developed. Unlike previous studies commonly focusing on geometry optimization, this research considers both geometric and operating parameters for evaluation where the dynamic performance and trajectory of the multibody motion are particularly interested. The dynamic response and contact behavior of the rotating fingers acting on the fixed and moving objects are validated by comparing against published experimental results. The effectiveness of the dynamic modeling method, which relaxes the quasi-static assumption, has been demonstrated in the analyses of developing an automated transfer system involved grasping and handling objects by the compliant robotic hands. This FEM based dynamic model offers a more realistic simulation and a better understanding of the multibody motion for improving future design. It is expected that the method presented here can be applied to a spectrum of engineering applications where flexible multibody dynamics plays a significant role. Ph. D.
