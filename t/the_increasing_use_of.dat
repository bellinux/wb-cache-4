5|$|During the Eastern Han, peasants {{could avoid}} {{the month of}} annual conscripted labor by paying a tax in {{commutation}} (gengfu 更賦). This development went {{hand in hand with}} <b>the</b> <b>increasing</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> hired labor by the government. In a similar manner, because the Eastern-Han government favored the military recruitment of volunteers, the mandatory military draft for peasants aged twenty-three could be avoided by paying a tax in substitution.|$|E
5|$|Shaughnessy mentored {{middle linebacker}} Bill George as the {{defensive}} play-caller. Bears coach Abe Gibron likened George to having Shaughnessy {{himself on the}} field. Shaughnessy worked to counter <b>the</b> <b>increasing</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> the forward pass. He emphasized man-to-man coverage, dropped linebackers or defensive ends into pass coverage, and utilized blitzes from multiple directions—which had previously consisted mostly of just a middle linebacker.|$|E
50|$|Given {{that there}} is {{established}} production of wind power plants and plant components, <b>the</b> <b>increased</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> wind power in Finland and elsewhere {{can be expected to}} create jobs in the sector. This would generate demand for professionals of all levels in mechanical, material and electrical technology.

There is also a recent unconfirmed report from Cambodia. Their large ranges and presumed high numbers mean {{that none of the}} crag martins are considered to be threatened, and all are classed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.|$|E
5|$|From {{the early}} 1860s whaling {{declined}} rapidly with <b>the</b> <b>increasing</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> petroleum, {{the onset of}} the Californian goldrush, and the American Civil War – with unfortunate consequences for the island. To explore alternative means of income Thompson, in 1867, purchased the Sylph which was the first local vessel to trade with Sydney (mainly pigs and onions). It anchored in deep water at what is now Sylph's Hole off Old Settlement Beach, but was eventually tragically lost at sea in 1873 which added to the woes of the island at this time.|$|E
5|$|From {{the overall}} stock of an {{estimated}} 458 million workers, 394million (86%) operate in the unorganised sector (of which 63% are self-employed) mostly as informal workers. There is a strong relationship between the quality of employment and social and poverty characteristics. The relative growth of informal employment was more rapid within the organised rather than the unorganised sector. This informalisation is also related to the flexibilisation of employment in the organised sector that is suggested by <b>the</b> <b>increasing</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> contract labour by employers in order to benefit from more flexible labour practices.|$|E

5|$|Sustainable use of {{materials}} has targeted {{the idea of}} dematerialization, converting the linear path {{of materials}} (extraction, use, disposal in landfill) to a circular material flow that reuses materials as much as possible, much like the cycling and reuse of waste in nature. This approach is supported by product stewardship and <b>the</b> <b>increasing</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> material flow analysis at all levels, especially individual countries and the global economy. The use of sustainable biomaterials that come from renewable sources {{and that can be}} recycled is preferred to the use on non-renewables from a life cycle standpoint.|$|E
5|$|During {{the later}} Roman Empire, the {{principal}} military developments were attempts {{to create an}} effective cavalry force {{as well as the}} continued development of highly specialised types of troops. The creation of heavily armoured cataphract-type soldiers as cavalry was an important feature of the 5th-century Roman military. The various invading tribes had differing emphasis on types of soldiers—ranging from the primarily infantry Anglo-Saxon invaders of Britain to the Vandals and Visigoths, who had a high proportion of cavalry in their armies. During the early invasion period, the stirrup had not been introduced into warfare, which limited the usefulness of cavalry as shock troops because {{it was not possible to}} put the full force of the horse and rider behind blows struck by the rider. The greatest change in military affairs during the invasion period was the adoption of the Hunnic composite bow in place of the earlier, and weaker, Scythian composite bow. Another development was <b>the</b> <b>increasing</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> longswords and the progressive replacement of scale armour by mail armour and lamellar armour.|$|E
5|$|Hillforts {{developed}} in the Late Bronze and Early Iron ages, around {{the start of the}} 1st millennium BC. The reason for their emergence in prehistoric Britain and their purpose has been a subject of debate. It has been argued that they could have been military sites constructed in response to invasion from continental Europe, sites built by invaders, or a military reaction to social tensions caused by an increasing population and consequent pressure on agriculture. The dominant view since the 1960s has been that <b>the</b> <b>increasing</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> iron led to social changes in Britain. Deposits of iron ore were located in different places from the tin and copper ore necessary to make bronze and, as a result, trading patterns shifted. The old elites lost their economic and social status and power passed into the hands of a new group of people.|$|E

5|$|In {{military}} affairs, {{the use of}} infantry with specialised roles increased. Along {{with the}} still-dominant heavy cavalry, armies often included mounted and infantry crossbowmen, as well as sappers and engineers. Crossbows, which had been known in Late Antiquity, increased in use {{partly because of the}} increase in siege warfare in the 10th and 11th centuries. <b>The</b> <b>increasing</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> crossbows during the 12th and 13th centuries led to the use of closed-face helmets, heavy body armour, as well as horse armour. Gunpowder was known in Europe by the mid-13th century with a recorded use in European warfare by the English against the Scots in 1304, although it was merely used as an explosive and not as a weapon. Cannon were being used for sieges in the 1320s, and hand-held guns were in use by the 1360s.|$|E
5|$|Under an 1898 {{agreement}} between the Estates Company and the Ship Canal Company, the latter committed to carry freight on their dock railway between the docks and the park and {{to the construction of}} a permanent connection between the two railway networks. The West Manchester Light Railway Company was set up the following year to take over the operations of the tramway and to lay additional track. In 1904 responsibility for all of the parks roads and railways passed to the Trafford Park Company, {{as a result of the}} Trafford Park Act of that year. The railway network could subsequently be extended as required, without the need to seek additional permissions from Parliament. The network was also connected to the Manchester, South Junction and Altrincham Railway near Cornbrook. At its peak, the estate's railway network covered 26route miles (42km), handling about 2.5 million tons of cargo in 1940. Like the rest of the park, it fell into decline during the 1960s, exacerbated by <b>the</b> <b>increasing</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> road transport, and it was closed in 1998.|$|E
5|$|With {{the ending}} of the Gupta Dynasty in {{northern}} India in the early 6th century, major changes began taking place in the Deccan south of the Vindyas and in the southern regions of India. These changes were not only political but also linguistic and cultural. The royal courts of peninsular India (outside of Tamilakam) interfaced between <b>the</b> <b>increasing</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> the local Kannada language and the expanding Sanskritic culture. Inscriptions, including those that were bilingual, demonstrate the use of Kannada as the primary administrative language in conjunction with Sanskrit. Government archives used Kannada for recording pragmatic information relating to grants of land. The local language formed the desi (popular) literature while literature in Sanskrit was more marga (formal). Educational institutions and places of higher learning (ghatikas) taught in Sanskrit, the language of the learned Brahmins, while Kannada increasingly became the speech of personal expression of devotional closeness of a worshipper to a private deity. The patronage Kannada received from rich and literate Jains eventually led to its use in the devotional movements of later centuries.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to discuss <b>the</b> {{consequences}} <b>of</b> citizens' <b>increased</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> public e-services for agency employees' work situation. Design/methodology/approach – In order to accomplish the purpose of the paper the authors focus on the way in which <b>the</b> <b>increased</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> public e-services also implies internal process and routine changes in public administration. The authors analyze work conditions for case officers at a government agency in Sweden by applying occupational ideal types to identify the specific work conditions in the studied case. The case study is based on qualitative data collected with a back office perspective. Findings – The findings indicate a new hybrid organization where <b>the</b> <b>increased</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> e-services challenges earlier demands for competence. The transformation of e-government has implications for job codification, rule observation, job specification, and interaction with the general public. Originality/value – The paper extends the knowledge on how <b>the</b> <b>increased</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> public e-services affects back-office work conditions, with an increased high level of complexity in work content, but with low level of work autonomy. It argues that studying back-office work conditions is an important management issue in public administration research as well as practice...|$|R
