5|$|The {{fact that}} a person prepares a weapon in order to defend {{themselves}} against expected attack does not preclude the defense from being legitimate and, according to courts, {{it may not be}} expected from a defender <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>and</b> rely on chance that a damage which is, both objectively and in the defender's subjective understanding, threatened to happen, will not take place. The defender may use proportionate accessible means in order to prevent an imminent attack and disarm the attacker.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority {{announced}} plans to renovate the train station. This, along the village's plans to revitalize the entire village of Sloatsburg, was thought to give the bland train station a more traditional look. This would include adding a roof to protect commuters and visitors from the elements, such as rain or snow, handicap-accessible ramps for wheelchairs, better lighting, more seats for people <b>to</b> <b>wait,</b> <b>and</b> a heated shelter. (A shelter exists, but is not heated). The village also wants to use a $50,000 grant from the state to construct a large municipal parking lot near the station. This would get more people to use the station, as because {{with the lack of}} facilities, the station is under-used. The preliminary design was made by Jeff Livingston, an architect on the Sloatsburg Revitalization Committee.|$|E

40|$|Management of {{consumer}} waiting experiences {{is critical for}} practitioners in that unpleasant waiting experiences may result in negative service evaluations. This study focused on consumers' queue waits during the pre-process phase of waiting experiences, i. e., before services are received, and investigated {{the extent to which}} relevant variables during this process may impact consumers' subsequent service experience evaluations. The investigation purported to expand and refine the expectation-affect-service evaluation relationship. Specifically, the framework examined the influence of predicted value of service on wait expectations (conceptualized as "consumer zone of wait tolerance" derived from the service literatures), the effects {{of consumer}}s' comparisons between <b>wait</b> expectations <b>and</b> perceptions (i. e., <b>wait</b> disconfirmation) <b>and</b> perceived <b>wait</b> duration on affective responses <b>to</b> <b>waiting,</b> <b>and</b> the impact of affective responses <b>to</b> <b>waiting</b> on service experience evaluations. In addition, this study predicted the moderating role of actions of the service provider from a social justice perspective in the relationship between affective response <b>to</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>and</b> service experience evaluation. Data were collected at two points in time (i. e., during <b>waiting</b> <b>and</b> at completion of service) via surveys completed by 393 adult consumers intercepted at three restaurants located in a southwestern city in the U. S. Hypotheses were tested through structural equation modeling, MANCOVA statistical techniques, and additional post hoc analyses. Findings suggest that both <b>wait</b> disconfirmation <b>and</b> perceived <b>wait</b> duration influence service experience evaluation through affective response <b>to</b> <b>waiting.</b> Results also revealed a positive relationship between predicted conditional value <b>and</b> zone of <b>wait</b> tolerance. The study provides support for social exchange theory and better understanding of the role of actions of the service provider in the relationship between affective response <b>to</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>and</b> service experience evaluation. Lastly, post hoc analyses lend credence to the concept that consumers' affective responses <b>to</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>and</b> service experience evaluations vary across the wait disconfirmation groups. Both theoretical and managerial implications are discussed and directions for future research are also provided...|$|R
5|$|Lieutenant General Charles Cornwallis led the British forces southward in the {{aftermath}} of the December26 battle. Leaving 1,400 men under Lieutenant Colonel Charles Mawhood in Princeton, Cornwallis advanced on Trenton with about 5,000 men on January2. His advance was significantly slowed by defensive skirmishing by American riflemen under the command of Edward Hand, and the advance guard did not reach Trenton until twilight. After assaulting the American positions three times, and being repulsed each time, Cornwallis decided <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>and</b> finish the battle the next day. Washington moved his army around Cornwallis's camp that night and attacked Mawhood at Princeton the next day. That defeat prompted the British to withdraw from most of New Jersey for the winter.|$|E
5|$|The Conservatives {{remained}} {{a minority in}} the House of Commons and {{the passage of the}} Reform Bill required the calling of a new election once the new voting register had been compiled. Disraeli's term as Prime Minister, which began in February 1868, would therefore be short unless the Conservatives won the general election. He made only two major changes in the cabinet: he replaced Lord Chelmsford as Lord Chancellor with Lord Cairns, and brought in George Ward Hunt as Chancellor of the Exchequer. Derby had intended to replace Chelmsford once a vacancy in a suitable sinecure developed. Disraeli was unwilling <b>to</b> <b>wait,</b> <b>and</b> Cairns, in his view, was a far stronger minister.|$|E
5|$|The {{need for}} a larger ferry on the Skarnsund service was also pressing. Cars often had <b>to</b> <b>wait,</b> <b>and</b> if the ferry sailed with full capacity, {{there was no room}} for {{passengers}} to leave their vehicles. Work to procure a new ferry to replace Skarnsund started in 1981. This resulted in the acquisition of the second-hand ferry Mosvik from Bergen, with a capacity of 24 cars, which entered service starting 9 December 1982. Skarnsund was leased to Namsos Trafikkselskap. In 1982, tickets for a single trip on the Skarnsund Ferry were NOK5 for an adult and NOK14 for a car with driver. On the Ytterøy service, it was NOK7 and 25, respectively. Discounts were available, up to 33% for cars and 50% for trucks and buses.|$|E

5|$|Although Theophilos's {{principal}} commanders, Theophobos and the Domestic of the Schools Manuel, both advised for {{a surprise}} night attack, the Emperor sided with {{the opinion of the}} other officers and resolved <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>and</b> launch his attack on the next day. The Byzantine army attacked at dawn, and initially made good progress: they drove back one wing of the opposite army, inflicting 3,000 casualties on the Arabs. Near noon, Theophilos resolved to reinforce the other wing, and detached 2,000 Byzantines and the Kurdish contingent to do so, abandoning his post and passing behind his own army's lines. At this point, however, Afshin launched his Turkish horse-archers in a ferocious counter-attack which stymied the Byzantine advance and allowed the Arab forces to regroup. The Byzantine troops then noticed the emperor's absence, and, thinking he had been killed, began to waver. This soon turned into a disorderly retreat; some men fled as far as Constantinople, bringing with them the rumour that the Emperor had been killed. Some units, however, were apparently able to retreat in good order and assemble at a place called Chiliokomon.|$|E
5|$|Dokeianos re-appears in 1050, when he {{held the}} titles of patrikios and vestarches, {{as part of an}} {{imperial}} expedition against the Pechenegs who raided Thrace. The imperial commander-in-chief, the eunuch praipositos Constantine, a militarily inexperienced court favourite of Emperor Constantine IX (r. 1042–55), listened to his advice on fortifying the army's encampment, but when the Pechenegs appeared before Adrianople, he refused to heed the opinion of the magistros Constantine Arianites <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>and</b> attack the Pechenegs on their return journey, and instead marched to meet them in the open field of Basilike Libas, resulting in a devastating defeat: Arianites fell, while Dokeianos was taken prisoner. As he was brought before the Pecheneg leader, however, Dokeianos seized a sword from one of his guards and slashed at the leader, cutting off one of his arms, whereupon the enraged Pechenegs killed him and, according to Michael Attaleiates, opened his belly, cut off his arms and legs and placed them in it.|$|E

40|$|Waiting {{is a part}} of {{everyday}} life. It is often characterised by its banality: its quotidian nature. Time spent waiting can be seen as boring, wasted, and at times painful or distressing, or conversely hopeful or full of potential. The experience of Motor Neurone Disease (MND) reveals a population for whom (limited) time has a significant impact on quality of life. This paper will argue that waiting, for people with MND, exemplifies the relationship between time, power and agency. In so doing we can better conceptualise the manifold ways in which time <b>and</b> <b>waiting</b> are experienced through choosing <b>to</b> <b>wait,</b> enforced <b>waiting</b> <b>and</b> <b>waiting</b> when time is known to be ‘running out’. Through a sociological analysis of multiple forms of waiting three key themes emerged that characterised waiting as powerlessness; emotional (as a form of production), and; alternating as an experience between patience and endurance. This paper challenges the passivity, universality <b>and</b> ambivalence ascribed <b>to</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>and</b> instead argues that waiting affects the ‘time left’ for people with MND. It also offers up a lens through which to view time through the multiple textures <b>and</b> tensions of <b>waiting</b> produced through chronic illness...|$|R
