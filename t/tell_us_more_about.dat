25|$|Qualitative {{research}} is sometimes {{said to have}} as its goal {{the understanding of the}} sample studied, rather than generalizing from the sample to the population. However, the results of qualitative research can be applied to other settings—as long as the reader of the research understands the limitations. For example, the research findings of a qualitative case study of primary school children in a particular school and their mobile phone usage will <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> the mobile phone usage of children in the general population, than of adults. However, the type of school (public or private), where it was located, and the socio-economic background of the students need to be taken into consideration when applying any findings to other settings (either schools or the general population of children).|$|E
500|$|GayNZ writer Craig Young places Ianto, like Buffys Tara, in {{a larger}} {{literary}} tradition, commenting [...] "just as Iphigenia's sacrifice {{at the hands of}} Agamemnon was necessary to set in train the events of Aeschylus's Oresteia... just as Ophelia's madness, suicide and accidental death led to the climatic duel between Hamlet and Laertes ... Ianto's death can be argued to be a dramatic necessity which adds to character and narrative development." [...] The article acknowledged there being some validity in criticisms of modern TV dramas which uphold that it is frequently the gay relationships which [...] "can never be seen to have long-term, fulfilled relationships". However, GayNZ questioned whether the pattern was solely gay, noting the equally tragic outcomes of homosexual and heterosexual relationships in American shows Buffy and Nip/Tuck. The website also took note of Ianto fans' displeasure when Jack was introduced to a new romantic partner in Alonso Frame (Russell Tovey) in Doctor Who episode The End of Time (2010), mirroring Willow's romance with Kennedy (Iyari Limon) in Season Seven of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. The article intentionally avoided making a definitive conclusion as to which [...] "side" [...] of the argument was correct. Young later compared Ianto's death with the subsequent killing off of core heterosexual couples in two British shows, Misfits and Being Human. These latter deaths are described as even more heartbreaking than Ianto's, and Young argues that these character deaths <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> transatlantic differences in storytelling than about portrayals of sexuality.|$|E

He does not tell all these events in chronological order but instead in sporadic episodes. The novel consists of several flashbacks which <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> Hata's life and his rituals.|$|E
40|$|Extract] This book {{presents}} {{a comprehensive review}} of whiplash. A diagnosis of whiplash <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> the mechanism of injury than it does about the actual patho-anatomical process, which hampers our ability to clinically manage this condition. The range of clinical presentations that may result from a whiplash-type injury are known as whiplash associated disorders (WAD). Whiplash associated disorders represent a complex pain condition that challenges both medical and allied health practitioners...|$|R
50|$|As {{the overall}} {{population}} changed between 1901 and 1911, also did the age structure. In 1901 the largest age groups were the 0-4 and 5-9 age groups. This follows the normal pattern {{of a growing}} population. But by 1911 the largest age groups were 25-29 and 50-54 years. This is the pattern of a declining population. As there were less soldiers in the population in 1911, this census <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> the native church of Ireland population.|$|R

Mr. Cariani describes the play’s subject as ‘falling in and out of love.’ It is just as much about pain.” ...|$|E
50|$|The NASA Origins Program {{was created}} in the 1990s to {{ultimately}} search for the origin of the universe. The theory that the Origins Program is based on is: since light travels at a constant speed until it is absorbed by something; there is still light {{that was part of the}} first light ever created traveling about the universe and ultimately some of that light is coming in the general direction of Earth. So a satellite system capable of collecting light from the beginning of the universe would be able to <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> where we came from.|$|E
50|$|The {{investigation}} of physical trace evidence involves examining {{the remnants of}} the subject’s past behavior. These remnants could be any number of items, and are usually divided into two main categories. Use traces indicate the use or non-use of an item. Fingerprints, for example, fall into the category of use traces, along with candy wrappers, cigarette cartons, and countless other objects. In contrast, products are the creations or artifacts of behavior. An example of a product might be a painting, a song, a dance or television. Whereas use traces <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> the behavior of an individual, products speak more to contemporary cultural themes.|$|E
40|$|A {{powerful}} and resonant drama, the reassessment {{of our history}} that Holy Day offers <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> our contemporary cultural preoccupations than about our past. Set as a mystery, encompassing today's two great contested aspects of Aboriginal history-frontier massacres and the stolen generations, the play is quite explicitly, concerned with apportioning blame. In proffering up one female (Aboriginal) as the unjustly accused perpetrator, then another, white, as the real (and unpunished) perpetrator, the play provides an ending that is as thought provoking as it is, ultimately, unsatisfying...|$|R
