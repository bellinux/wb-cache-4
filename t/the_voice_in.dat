5|$|In eastern Indonesia (i.e. in {{the music}} of the Toraja in South Sulawesi, in Flores, in East Kalimantan and in North Sulawesi), two-part harmonies are common, usually in {{intervals}} of thirds, fourths or fifths. Additionally, much music of the Middle East is generally homophonic, although polyphony is also an important texture, while Chinese music is generally thought to be homophonic, since instruments typically provide accompaniment in parallel fourths and fifths and often double <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> <b>in</b> vocal music, heterophony also being common in China.|$|E
5|$|In melody-dominated homophony, {{accompanying}} voices provide chordal {{support for}} the lead voice, which assumes the melody. Some popular music today might be considered melody-dominated homophony, voice typically taking on the lead role, while instruments like piano, guitar and bass guitar normally accompany <b>the</b> <b>voice.</b> <b>In</b> many cases, instruments also take on the lead role, and often the role switches between parts, voice taking the lead during a verse and instruments subsequently taking solos, during which the other instruments provide chordal support.|$|E

25|$|This {{primitive}} telephone {{was rapidly}} improved. The double electromagnet {{was replaced by}} a single permanently magnetized bar magnet having a small coil or bobbin of fine wire surrounding one pole, in front of which a thin disc of iron was fixed in a circular mouthpiece. The disc served as a combined diaphragm and armature. On speaking into the mouthpiece, the iron diaphragm vibrated with <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> <b>in</b> the magnetic field of the bar-magnet pole, and thereby caused undulatory currents in the coil. These currents, after traveling through the wire to the distant receiver, were received in an identical apparatus. This design was patented by Bell on January 30, 1877. The sounds were weak and could only be heard when the ear was close to the earphone/mouthpiece, but they were distinct.|$|E
25|$|Oba is {{also aware}} of the second sorceress {{and the fact that}} she knows {{something}} concerning his fate or nature. He hires a guide to the swamp, which he safely negotiates as well. The sorceress reveals that Oba is now a thrall to the Keeper of the Underworld and kills herself before Oba can do the deed. This, along with the fact that his guide has stolen all his money, enrages Oba. He is mollified somewhat by the treasure he finds in the sorceresses' cottage, but his rage returns when, after returning to the People's Palace, he spots his guide. After killing the guide, he is briefly jailed but escapes, using <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> <b>in</b> his mind to make the D'Haran guards do his bidding, and resolves to locate Richard Rahl.|$|E

25|$|Galen's {{principal}} {{interest was}} in human anatomy, but Roman law had prohibited the dissection of human cadavers since about 150 BC. Because of this restriction, Galen performed anatomical dissections on living (vivisection) and dead animals, mostly focusing on pigs and primates. This work was useful because Galen {{believed that the}} anatomical structures of these animals closely mirrored those of humans. Galen clarified the anatomy of the trachea {{and was the first}} to demonstrate that the larynx generates <b>the</b> <b>voice.</b> <b>In</b> one experiment, Galen used bellows to inflate the lungs of a dead animal. Galen's work on the anatomy remained largely unsurpassed and unchallenged up until the 16th century in Europe. In the middle of the 16th century, the anatomist Andreas Vesalius challenged the anatomical knowledge of Galen by conducting dissections on human cadavers. These investigations allowed Vesalius to refute aspects of Galen's anatomy.|$|E
25|$|Other {{studies suggest}} that hormones play also an {{important}} role in vocal fold maturation. Hormones are molecules secreted into the blood stream to be delivered at different targeted sites. They usually promote growth, differentiation and functionality in different organs or tissues. Their effect is due to their ability to bind to intracellular receptors, modulating the gene expression, and subsequently regulating protein synthesis. The interaction between the endocrine system and tissues such as breast, brain, testicles, heart, bones, etc., is being extensively studied. It has clearly been seen that the larynx is somewhat affected by hormonal changes, but surprisingly, very few studies are working on elucidating this relationship. The effect of hormonal changes in voice is clearly seen when hearing male and female voices, or when listening to a teenage voice changing during puberty. Actually, it is believed that the number of hormonal receptors in the pre-pubertal phase is higher than in any other age. Menstruation has also been seen to influence <b>the</b> <b>voice.</b> <b>In</b> fact, singers are encouraged by their instructors not to perform during their pre-menstrual period, because of a drop in their voice quality.|$|E
