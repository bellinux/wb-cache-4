5|$|Diagnosis is {{suspected}} based on lesion circumstances and clinical evidence, most prominently a neurological examination, for example checking whether the pupils constrict normally {{in response to}} light and assigning a Glasgow Coma Score.

5|$|Histologically, cholangiocarcinomas are classically well to {{moderately}} differentiated adenocarcinomas. Immunohistochemistry {{is useful}} in <b>the</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>and</b> {{may be used to}} help differentiate a cholangiocarcinoma from hepatocellular carcinoma and metastasis of other gastrointestinal tumors. Cytological scrapings are often nondiagnostic, as these tumors typically have a desmoplastic stroma and, therefore, do not release diagnostic tumor cells with scrapings.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a remote design of model predictive control (MPC) system with model <b>diagnosis</b> <b>and</b> model adjustment. <b>The</b> design incorporates <b>the</b> model <b>diagnosis</b> <b>and</b> model adjustment into MPC. Furthermore, <b>the</b> MPC, model <b>diagnosis</b> <b>and</b> model adjustment are integrated {{in the remote}} controllable MPC system. The technologies of. NET, XML-RPC, Ajax asynchronous interaction and plugin are adopted. To enhance the MPC operating performance, <b>the</b> <b>diagnosis</b> module <b>and</b> adjustment module are designed as independent plugins of MPC. Implementations of the design will benefit the practical application of MPC as well as promoting the acceptability and usage of MPC in industry...|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>and</b> {{classification}} of AML can be challenging, {{and should be}} performed by a qualified hematopathologist or hematologist. In straightforward cases, the presence of certain morphologic features (such as Auer rods) or specific flow cytometry results can distinguish AML from other leukemias; however, {{in the absence of}} such features, diagnosis may be more difficult.|$|E
5|$|An {{electroencephalogram}} (EEG) {{can assist}} in showing brain activity suggestive of {{an increased risk of}} seizures. It is only recommended for those who are likely to have had an epileptic seizure on the basis of symptoms. In the diagnosis of epilepsy, electroencephalography may help distinguish the type of seizure or syndrome present. In children it is typically only needed after a second seizure. It cannot be used to rule out <b>the</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>and</b> may be falsely positive in those without the disease. In certain situations it may be useful to perform the EEG while the affected individual is sleeping or sleep deprived.|$|E
5|$|Between May 1917 and May 1918, Mackinnon {{worked at}} the University War Hospital in Southamptom with William Fletcher from the Royal Army Medical Corps, {{focussing}} on <b>the</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>and</b> treatment of dysentery. The pair focussed on two forms of Shigella dysenteriae which had been identified by Simon Flexner and Kiyoshi Shiga. They discovered that the Flexner bacillus could go into intermission and be undetectable for periods of four to five weeks, making {{it very difficult to}} say when someone was no longer a carrier. They also found that men who were carriers of Shiga's bacillus would be prone to depression and would be no longer fit to be soldiers.|$|E

5|$|Diving {{medicine}} is the diagnosis, treatment {{and prevention of}} conditions caused by exposing divers to the underwater environment.

Hyperbaric {{medicine is}} another field associated with diving, since recompression in a hyperbaric chamber with hyperbaric oxygen therapy is the definitive treatment for two of the most important diving-related illnesses, DCS and arterial gas embolism.|$|E

5|$|The {{ability of}} the new {{reactors}} to create radioactive isotopes in previously unheard-of quantities sparked a revolution in nuclear medicine in the immediate postwar years. Starting in mid-1946, Oak Ridge began distributing radioisotopes to hospitals and universities.

In addition to medicine, isotopes were also used in biological, industrial and agricultural research.|$|E

The agents head to Allentown, Pennsylvania to see Betsy Hagopian, a Mutual UFO Network member who was previously discovered to be suffering from similar symptoms. The agents learn that Betsy has died, yet find someone using her phone line. They trace the call to Kurt Crawford (David Lovgren), a fellow MUFON member. Crawford tells them that {{all but one of the}} MUFON members Scully previously met have died of cancer. Scully is skeptical of Mulder and Crawford's claims that a government conspiracy and her abduction are behind her illness.|$|E
5|$|Seaborg was the {{principal}} or co-discoverer of ten elements: plutonium, americium, curium, berkelium, californium, einsteinium, fermium, mendelevium, nobelium and element 106, which, {{while he was still}} living, was named seaborgium in his honor. He also discovered more than 100 atomic isotopes and is credited with important contributions to the chemistry of plutonium, originally as part of the Manhattan Project where he developed the extraction process used to isolate the plutonium fuel for the second atomic bomb. Early in his career, he was a pioneer in nuclear medicine and discovered isotopes of elements with important applications in <b>the</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>and</b> treatment of diseases, most notably iodine-131, which is used in the treatment of thyroid disease. In addition to his theoretical work {{in the development of the}} actinide concept, which placed the actinide series beneath the lanthanide series on the periodic table, he postulated the existence of super-heavy elements in the transactinide and superactinide series.|$|E
