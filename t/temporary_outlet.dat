Thus, the analysis of the exchange rates evolution of the New Member States (NMS) of the European Union (EU) may constitute the basis for further research concerning these regional economies {{in the context of the}} changeover to Euro.

This provided entrepreneurs with a means of gaining access to prime retail space without the long term risk of lengthy leases...|$|R
