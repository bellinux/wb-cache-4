5|$|The series {{tells the}} story of the {{citizens}} of Kurōzu-cho, a fictional city which is plagued by a supernatural curse involving spirals. The story for Uzumaki originated when Ito attempted to write a story about people living in a very long <b>terraced</b> <b>house,</b> and he was inspired to use a spiral shape to achieve the desired length. Ito believes the horror of Uzumaki is effective due to its subversion of symbols which are normally positively portrayed in Japanese media, and its theme of protagonists struggling against a mysterious force stronger than themselves.|$|E
5|$|Fred Keenor {{was born}} in Cardiff, Wales, as one of eleven children. He {{was raised in the}} family home, a <b>terraced</b> <b>house</b> in Theodora Street in Roath, a suburb in Cardiff, by his father Robert Keenor and his mother Mary. His father worked as a stonemason in the city, working long hours {{in order to be able}} to afford the {{employment}} of Elizabeth Maler, a live-in nanny, to help his wife care for their children. Although they were not regarded as being in poverty, the family lived in cramped conditions, Keenor sharing a bedroom with three of his brothers in a house which did not have an inside toilet.|$|E

He played for the Rita Social Club after moving to Fitzroy, while his wife kept score. His daughter was also a scorer for the club. As recreational facilities and grass ovals were sparse in densely populated Fitzroy, the boys took to playing cricket in a cobblestone laneway between their <b>terraced</b> <b>house.</b> Here they played cricket with a tennis ball, home made cricket bat and a kerosene tin for a wicket.|$|E
50|$|<b>Terraced</b> <b>houses</b> in Australia refers almost {{exclusively}} to Victorian and Edwardian era <b>terraced</b> <b>houses</b> or replicas almost always found in the older, inner city areas of the major cities, mainly Sydney and Melbourne. <b>Terraced</b> <b>housing</b> was introduced to Australia in the 19th century.

50|$|<b>Terraced</b> <b>houses</b> {{were still}} {{considered}} desirable architecture {{at the start}} of the 19th century.

5|$|After the war, {{he started}} selling {{bicycles}} and motorbikes {{in a small}} shop in Brunswick Street, in the Kensington Fields area of Liverpool. He began selling and recharging batteries in 1925, opening a shop {{in the front room}} of his family's three-storey Georgian <b>terraced</b> <b>house,</b> called Phillips’ Battery Charging Depot, and had to install large accumulators in the cellar. Phillips ran the business for 30 years, even during WWII, but due to a decline in demand for batteries in the early 1950s (most people having electricity by then) he started selling household electrical goods. By late 1954, the shop was only selling records and record players; customers would buy recordings of American Country and Western, and Big Band music. As Phillips had supplied batteries to the Burtonwood air base during the war, he could buy and sell the latest records from America via his contacts there.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the 2011 census there were 817 people living in the parish. 13.2% were {{children}} up the age of 15 years. 52.3% were between 16 and 64 with 34.5 being 65 and older. This is an older population than in the rest of Somerset and England and Wales in general.

The housing is fairly evenly divided between detached, semi-detached and <b>terraced</b> <b>house,</b> with 5.7% living in flats.|$|E
5|$|In 1965, Fredrik Reinfeldt {{was born}} in Allmänna BB {{hospital}} in Stockholm and was the oldest of three brothers to his parents Bruno (1938-2016) and Birgitta Reinfeldt. At {{the time of his}} birth his parents lived in an apartment in Österhaninge, in the south of Stockholm County, but a short time afterwards the family moved to London, where his father worked as a consultant for Shell. Upon returning to Sweden, the family first lived in an apartment in Handen before moving to a <b>terraced</b> <b>house</b> in Bromsten in northwestern Stockholm. The Reinfeldt family was living in Bromsten when Fredrik's younger brothers, Magnus and Henrik, were born in 1969 and 1973. In 1976 the family moved into a single-family home in Täby in northeastern Stockholm County. His mother Birgitta was a leadership and management consultant, and some of her professional skills might have inspired and impressed the young Fredrik.|$|E
50|$|British {{property}} {{developers and}} estate agents often market new buildings as townhouses, following the North American {{usage of the}} term, to aggrandise modest dwellings and to avoid the negative connotation of cheap <b>terraced</b> <b>housing</b> built in the Victorian era to accommodate workers, see <b>Terraced</b> <b>houses</b> in the United Kingdom. The aristocratic pedigree of <b>terraced</b> <b>housing,</b> for example as survives in St James's Square in Westminster, is widely forgotten.

5|$|As {{recreational}} facilities and grass ovals were sparse in densely populated Fitzroy, Merv {{and his younger}} brothers played cricket in a cobblestone laneway between their <b>terraced</b> <b>house.</b> Here they played cricket with a tennis ball, home made cricket bat and a kerosene tin for a wicket. They were usually joined by other local children, two of whom became elite sportsmen: Allan Ruthven and Harold Shillinglaw. The group also played Australian rules football, kicking around rolled up cardboard and newspaper. Much of the batting skill displayed by the Harvey brothers {{has been attributed to}} these games played on the unpredictable bounce of the bumpy laneway. The surface also had a V-shaped slope inwards towards the centre of the lane, causing balls to deviate sideways after bouncing. As the laneway meant that the playing area was long and narrow, the young boys also had to learn to play the ball straight in accordance with orthodox cricket technique. The Harveys played another form of cricket in their concreted backyard using a marble instead of a ball, and a miniature bat. This sharpened their reflexes.|$|E
