5|$|Rey Mysterio versus Sabu {{was next}} in an Extreme Rules match with the World Heavyweight Championship on the line. The match started with several chair shots from both competitors. Sabu had {{the upper part}} {{for most of the}} match, {{executing}} an Arabian Facebuster and a Triple Jump Moonsault, but Mysterio kicked out of both moves. Mysterio regained the upper hand, as he executed a Seated Senton that sent both men through a <b>table</b> <b>at</b> ringside. Sabu countered a second Seated Senton attempt, and put Mysterio on a second <b>table</b> <b>at</b> ringside. Sabu proceeded to execute a Triple-Jump Somersault Splash, but Mysterio made it to his feet while on the table. This turned the move into a DDT, sending both men through the <b>table</b> <b>at</b> ringside. Although neither men were legitimately hurt, Dr. Ferdinand Rios came out and kayfabe declared that the match could not continue. This meant that Mysterio retained the World Heavyweight Championship.|$|E

Sixty of the 400 total <b>tables</b> <b>at</b> the casino are devoted to VIP guests, a high concentration in comparison to other Cotai casinos.|$|R

In July that year former captain Todd Blackadder was appointed Crusaders coach, and his former teammates Mark Hammett and Daryl Gibson were appointed as assistants.|$|E

5|$|The 2014 Winter Paralympic Games is {{the first}} such Paralympics hosted by Russia. Russia {{ratified}} the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities during that period. Notably at 2010 Vancouver their Paralympic team topped the medal <b>table</b> <b>at</b> the Winter Paralympics, while their Olympic team performed well below expectations at the Winter Olympics. This led the media to highlight {{the contrast between the}} achievements of the country's Olympic and Paralympic delegations, despite the greater attention and funding awarded to the Olympic athletes. The Russian Federation organizers of the 2014 Winter Paralympic Games have, since 2007, made efforts to make the host city Sochi more accessible.|$|E
5|$|The {{trioxide}} is {{volatile and}} sublimes at high temperatures. This prevents {{formation of a}} continuous protective (passivating) oxide layer, which would stop the bulk oxidation of metal. Molybdenum has several oxidation states, the most stable being +4 and +6 (bolded in the <b>table</b> <b>at</b> left). The chemistry and the compounds show more similarity to tungsten than to chromium; the instability of molybdenum(III) and tungsten(III) compounds, for example, contrasts with {{the stability of the}} chromium(III) compounds. The highest oxidation state is seen in molybdenum(VI) oxide (MoO3), while the normal sulfur compound is molybdenum disulfide MoS2.|$|E
5|$|Yet Brooks did {{not always}} ennoble her subjects. Inherited wealth freed her from the need to sell her paintings; she did not care whether she pleased her sitters or not, and her wit, when unleashed, could be devastating. A {{striking}} example is her 1914–15 portrait of Elsie de Wolfe, an interior designer whom she felt had copied her monochromatic color schemes. Brooks painted de Wolfe porcelain-pale, in an off-white dress and a bonnet resembling a shower cap; a white ceramic goat placed on a <b>table</b> <b>at</b> her elbow seems to mimic her simpering expression.|$|E
