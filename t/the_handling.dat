5|$|Almost {{nothing is}} known about the {{childhood}} of Marco Polo until he was fifteen years old, excepting that he probably spent part of his childhood in Venice. Meanwhile, Marco Polo's mother died, and an aunt and uncle raised him. He received a good education, learning mercantile subjects including foreign currency, appraising, and <b>the</b> <b>handling</b> of cargo ships; he learned little or no Latin. His father later married Floradise Polo (née Trevisan).|$|E
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>handle,</b> used to {{grip and}} {{manipulate}} the blade safely, may include a tang, {{a portion of}} the blade that extends into <b>the</b> <b>handle.</b> Knives are made with partial tangs (extending part way into <b>the</b> <b>handle,</b> known as [...] "stick tangs") or full tangs (extending the full length of <b>the</b> <b>handle,</b> often visible on top and bottom). <b>The</b> <b>handle</b> may include a bolster, a piece of heavy material (usually metal) situated at the front or rear of <b>the</b> <b>handle.</b> <b>The</b> bolster, as its name suggests, is used to mechanically strengthen the knife.|$|R

5|$|Amid the {{continuing}} uproar, Playford decided to grant clemency. The Royal Commission {{concluded that the}} guilty verdict was sound. Although a majority of those who spoke out against <b>the</b> <b>handling</b> of the matter—including Dunstan—thought that Stuart was probably guilty, the events provoked heated and bitter debate in South Australian society and destabilised Playford's administration, while bringing much publicity to Dunstan.|$|E
5|$|Because sugars burn easily {{when exposed}} to flame, <b>the</b> <b>handling</b> of sugars risks dust explosion. The 2008 Georgia sugar {{refinery}} explosion, which killed 14 people and injured 40, and destroyed most of the refinery, {{was caused by the}} ignition of sugar dust. In its culinary use, sugar that is exposed to a heat source causes caramelization to take place. As the process occurs, volatile chemicals such as diacetyl are released, producing the characteristic caramel flavor.|$|E

30|$|In {{order to}} touch <b>the</b> <b>handle,</b> <b>the</b> robot {{has to decide}} the height and the moving {{direction}} of the tool first. A statistical analysis [15] of the most frequent size of <b>handles</b> shows that <b>the</b> height of <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> is in a range from 99  cm to 103  cm. Based on this acknowledgement, the robot keeps the vertical rod of the tool in this range. Then the robot chooses right as its target direction to touch <b>the</b> <b>handle.</b> If <b>the</b> robot confirms that <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> {{is not in the}} current direction, it changes its direction to left and performs the process of locating <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> again. Here we present the process of the localization and confirmation of <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> in <b>the</b> direction of right, and it is similar for left.|$|R

5|$|During the 11th century, {{political}} rivalries divided {{members of}} the court due to the ministers' differing approaches, opinions, and policies regarding <b>the</b> <b>handling</b> of the Song's complex society and thriving economy. The idealist Chancellor, Fan Zhongyan (989–1052), was the first to receive a heated political backlash when he attempted to institute the Qingli Reforms, which included measures such as improving the recruitment system of officials, increasing the salaries for minor officials, and establishing sponsorship programs to allow a wider range of people to be well educated and eligible for state service.|$|E
5|$|However, he did {{not remain}} Chief of Staff for long. He was {{appointed}} Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff effective 1 July 1974. As Chairman, Brown was responsible for <b>the</b> <b>handling</b> of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974, and the Mayaguez incident, the final act {{of the war in}} Vietnam in 1975. He also dealt with the 1976 shootings and Axe Murder Incident in the Korean Demilitarized Zone, and oversaw the Panama Canal Treaty in 1977.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>handle</b> {{is made of}} {{the ivory}} of an {{elephant}} tusk, and not from a hippopotamus canine tooth as was first thought. <b>The</b> <b>handle</b> was carved along the axis of the tusk, as evidenced by a dark spot located above {{the head of the}} [...] "Master of Animals", which is the tip of pulp cavity of the tusk. Once extracted from <b>the</b> tusk, <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> was polished on both sides and hollowed out to receive the blade. The thickness of <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> around <b>the</b> tang of the blade varies from 2 to 3 mm, which explains that the ivory is cracked there, with some pieces lost. At the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>handle,</b> <b>the</b> edge was beveled, and probably received a crimp of precious metal that would have reinforced the assemblage of <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> with <b>the</b> blade. At the time of the purchase, Bénédite reported that he could see traces of gold leaf on the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>handle,</b> now gone. <b>The</b> assemblage supports the hypothesis that the knife was not functional: the tang of the blade is too short and <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> too thin for the knife to have been practical.|$|R
50|$|The {{coping saw}} blade is {{installed}} with the teeth pointing towards <b>the</b> <b>handle.</b> Unlike a hacksaw, {{which has the}} teeth pointed away from <b>the</b> <b>handle,</b> <b>the</b> coping saw cuts on the pull stroke. The coping saw blade is removable by partially unscrewing <b>the</b> <b>handle.</b> <b>The</b> blade is prevented from rotating {{by means of the}} short, steady bar provided where the blade is attached. Loosening <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> also allows <b>the</b> blade to be rotated relative to the frame as desired. Carefully aligning the finger with the steady bars at {{the top and bottom of}} the blade ensures that the thin blade is straight and not twisted along its length. Retightening <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> tensions <b>the</b> blade and locks it at the desired angle relative to the frame. The short steady bar nearest <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> is held securely between finger and thumb while <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> is tightened to ensure the blade remains at the desired angle. Unlike the fretsaw the coping saw blade has holding pins which lock securely into the angled slots of the rotatable blade holders.|$|R

50|$|Unlike other {{traditional}} combat weapon's, <b>the</b> Sewar's <b>handle</b> lacks a finger guard. Usually a ferrule made of brass is mounted {{at the base}} of <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> to better secure <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> and <b>the</b> blade. For ceremonial versions, a ferrule clamp is extremely ornate (Tampo). Its design can be rectangular, hexagonal, octagonal, or triangular (Glupa). Traditionally <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> is made of wood and often decorated with carvings or metal ornaments. Various versions of <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> are crafted differently, in styles such as the Hulu Boh Glimo or the Akar Bahar.|$|R
40|$|A cervix-to-rectum {{measuring}} device {{to be used}} in the treatment of cervical cancer is described.

The {{measuring device}} further includes means for coupling <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> to an intrauterine radiation applicator when the latter is positioned in the uterine cervix and the probe is inserted in the rectum to pivot <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> about <b>the</b> probe. A gear is provided which is adapted to pivot with the probe. A pinion pivotably connected to <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> meshes with <b>the</b> gear. A pointer fixed to the pinion is displaced in response to the pivoting of <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> about <b>the</b> probe, and this displacement can be read from a scale on <b>the</b> <b>handle,</b> providing an indication of the cervix-to-rectum distance...|$|R

5|$|Many crash {{survivors}} suffered long recoveries {{from the}} physical and psychological traumas they endured. A month after the crash, an orderly caravan of around 1,000 vehicles drove to JFK while some demonstrators laid wreaths in the international terminal lobby to protest <b>the</b> <b>handling</b> of the flight. Some survivors sued the FAA, accusing the agency of failing to ensure the flight's safety. In July 1990, Avianca offered $75,000 to crash survivors and the relatives of those killed. The U.S. government eventually joined Avianca and reached a settlement estimated at over $200million in damages to the victims.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>handle</b> is {{generally}} made from birch for better grip {{when used in}} snowy conditions. This also provides good control over the blade, particularly when using draw strokes, which are preferred when <b>handling</b> <b>the</b> knife with gloves, or while the hands are numb. The tang runs through <b>the</b> <b>handle.</b> <b>The</b> <b>handle</b> has no crossguard. Traditional material for the sheath is reindeer leather.|$|R

50|$|The user {{holds the}} gripper {{in one hand}} and squeezes <b>the</b> two <b>handles</b> {{together}} until they touch. Once touched, <b>the</b> <b>handles</b> are released and the movement is repeated. Variations of this basic movement include negatives below, and a variety of partial movements. For example, if the strength of the gripper is beyond that of the user, the user might apply maximum force, moving <b>the</b> <b>handles</b> as far as possible, even if <b>the</b> <b>handles</b> cannot be made to touch. Another partial movement involves using two hands to squeeze <b>the</b> <b>handles</b> within approximately 19 mm (3/4 inch) of each other, releasing one hand and then using the other hand to make <b>the</b> <b>handles</b> of <b>the</b> gripper touch each other. Negatives involve starting <b>the</b> gripper <b>handles</b> touching and then resisting as the gripper opens up, in an eccentric contraction.|$|R

30|$|As can be {{seen from}} Table  7, the maximum range along X and Y {{negative}} direction is greater than that along the positive direction. X negative direction represents moving <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> to <b>the</b> left and positive direction represents moving <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> to <b>the</b> right. Similarly, Y negative direction represents moving <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> close to <b>the</b> operator and the positive direction represents moving <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> away from <b>the</b> operator. It can be concluded that the motion of <b>the</b> operator’s <b>handle</b> toward himself/herself is greater than moving away from himself/herself. This means that asymmetric control interval is necessary for a haptic device-based system.|$|R
