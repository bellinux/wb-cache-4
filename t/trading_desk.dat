25|$|A {{synthetic}} ETF has counterparty risk, {{because the}} counterparty is contractually obligated {{to match the}} return on the index. The deal is arranged with collateral posted by the swap counterparty. A potential hazard is that the investment bank offering the ETF might post its own collateral, and that collateral could be of dubious quality. Furthermore, the investment bank could use its own <b>trading</b> <b>desk</b> as counterparty. These types of set-ups are not allowed under the European guidelines, Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS), so the investor should look for UCITS III-compliant funds.|$|E

This study examines how the efficiency of <b>trading</b> <b>desks</b> operated by fund families affects the performance and trading of affiliated funds. We introduce a novel approach to measure the efficiency of <b>trading</b> <b>desks,</b> which allows for comparisons across families with different investable universes. By operating efficient <b>trading</b> <b>desks,</b> which reduce <b>trading</b> costs, fund families improve {{the performance of their}} funds significantly. Furthermore, the lower trading costs resulting from more efficient <b>trading</b> <b>desks</b> enable mutual funds to trade more and hold less liquid portfolios...|$|R

25|$|In the U.S., the Federal Reserve most {{commonly}} uses overnight repurchase agreements (repos) to temporarily create money, or reverse repos to temporarily destroy money, which offset temporary {{changes in the}} level of bank reserves. The Federal Reserve also makes outright purchases and sales of securities through the System Open Market Account (SOMA) with its manager over the <b>Trading</b> <b>Desk</b> at the New York Reserve Bank. The trade of securities in the SOMA changes the balance of bank reserves, which also affects short-term interest rates. The SOMA manager is responsible for trades that result in a short-term interest rate near the target rate set by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), or create money by the outright purchase of securities. More rarely will it permanently destroy money by the outright sale of securities. These trades are made with a group of about 22 banks and bond dealers called primary dealers.|$|E
25|$|Expiry (or Expiration in the U.S.) is {{the time}} and the day that a {{particular}} delivery month of a futures contract stops trading, as well as the final settlement price for that contract. For many equity index and Interest rate future contracts (as well as for most equity options), this happens on the third Friday of certain trading months. On this day the t+1 futures contract becomes the t futures contract. For example, for most CME and CBOT contracts, at the expiration of the December contract, the March futures become the nearest contract. This is an exciting time for arbitrage desks, which try to make quick profits during the short period (perhaps 30 minutes) during which the underlying cash price and the futures price sometimes struggle to converge. At this moment the futures and the underlying assets are extremely liquid and any disparity between an index and an underlying asset is quickly traded by arbitrageurs. At this moment also, the increase in volume is caused by traders rolling over positions to the next contract or, in the case of equity index futures, purchasing underlying components of those indexes to hedge against current index positions. On the expiry date, a European equity arbitrage <b>trading</b> <b>desk</b> in London or Frankfurt will see positions expire in as many as eight major markets almost every half an hour.|$|E

2500|$|Hedged/Arbitrage/Swap investors: Proprietary <b>trading</b> <b>desk</b> or hedged-funds {{using as}} core {{strategy}} Convertible Arbitrage which consists in, for {{its most basic}} iteration, as being long the convertible bonds while being short the underlying stock. Buying the convertible while selling the stock {{is often referred to}} as being [...] "on swap". Hedged investors would modulate their different risks (e.g. Equity, Credit, Interest-Rate, Volatility, Currency) by putting in place one or more hedge (e.g. Short Stock, CDS, Asset Swap, Option, Future). Inherently, market-makers are hedged investors as they would have a trading book during the day and/or overnight held in a hedged fashion to provide the necessary liquidity to pursue their market making operations.|$|E
2500|$|Fossil fuel companies: Traditional {{fossil fuel}} {{corporations}} could benefit or lose from stricter global warming regulations. [...] A {{reduction in the}} use of fossil fuels could negatively impact fossil fuel corporations. [...] However, the fact that fossil fuel companies are a large source of energy, are also the primary source of carbon dioxide, and are engaged in energy trading might mean that their participation in trading schemes and other such mechanisms might give them a unique advantage and makes it unclear whether traditional fossil fuel companies would all and always be against stricter global warming policies. [...] As an example, Enron, a traditional gas pipeline company with a large <b>trading</b> <b>desk</b> heavily lobbied the government for the EPA to regulate CO2: they thought that they would dominate the energy industry if they could {{be at the center of}} energy trading.|$|E

50|$|The {{evolution}} of proprietary trading at banks {{reached the point}} where many banks employed multiple traders devoted solely to proprietary trading, with the hopes of earning added profits above that of market-making. These proprietary <b>trading</b> <b>desks</b> were often considered internal hedge funds within the bank, performing in isolation away from client-flow traders. Proprietary desks routinely had the highest value at risk among other <b>trading</b> <b>desks</b> at the bank. At times, investment banks such as Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank, and the former Merrill Lynch earned a significant portion of their quarterly and annual profits (and losses) through proprietary trading efforts.|$|R
