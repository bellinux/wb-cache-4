5|$|All LMS tenders {{were given}} {{their own unique}} {{identity}} numbers and they <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> constructed {{in advance of the}} locomotives they would be paired with. Hence, they were made in four batches, Nos. 9703–9709, 9743–9752, 9798–9817 and 10622-10624.|$|E
5|$|Danish country vicarages {{from this}} period <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> built in the same style as farmhouses, though usually rather larger. A fine example is Kølstrup Vicarage near Kerteminde in {{north-eastern}} Funen. The house itself is a thatched half-timbered building with a large rectangular courtyard flanked by outhouses.|$|E
5|$|In Canada, as {{elsewhere}} in the world of European colonies, the frontier of European exploration and settlement <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a linguistically diverse and fluid place, as cultures using different languages met and interacted. The need for a common means of communication between the indigenous inhabitants and new arrivals for the purposes of trade, and (in some cases) intermarriage, {{led to the development of}} Mixed languages. Languages like Michif, Chinook Jargon and Bungi creole <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> highly localized and were often spoken by only a small number of individuals who were frequently capable of speaking another language. Plains Sign Talk, which functioned originally as a trade language used to communicate internationally and across linguistic borders, reached across Canada, the United States and into Mexico.|$|E
50|$|Disease by P. syringae <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> favoured by wet, cool {{conditions}} - optimum temperatures {{for disease}} <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> around 12-25°C, although this can {{vary according to}} the pathovar involved. The bacteria <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> seed-borne, and are dispersed between plants by rain splash.|$|R
50|$|Nests <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> large, {{containing}} about 150 cells. Combs of {{the nest}} also <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> large, reaching 15X20 cm. The nests are single-layered and circular or umbrella-shaped. The nests <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> supported by longer pedicals than are found in other vespids.|$|R

5|$|The {{other type}} was the mainland; these <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> larger because their {{pastures}} provided richer nutrients. They {{came in a}} range of colours, most frequently dun or red. These types have now been crossbred so that there is no distinct difference.|$|E
5|$|The precise {{demographics}} of the readership of street newspapers is unclear. A pair of 1993 surveys conducted by Chicago's StreetWise suggested that the paper's readers at the time <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> college-educated, with slightly over half being female, and slightly over half unmarried.|$|E
5|$|Another major 20th-century {{composer}} {{who engaged}} Beecham's sympathies was Sibelius, who recognised {{him as a}} fine conductor of his music (although Sibelius <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> lavish with praise of anybody who conducted his music). In a live recording of a December 1954 concert performance of Sibelius's Second Symphony with the BBC Symphony Orchestra in the Festival Hall, Beecham can be heard uttering encouraging shouts at the orchestra at climactic moments.|$|E
50|$|Flowers of “Dendrobium pulchellum”, <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{fragrant}} {{with broad}} leaves. The leaves of Charming pulchellum <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> very fragile and <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> larger in size {{when compared to}} other sub-species. They are erect when they are young and as they age they <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> droop due to their increasing size.|$|R

50|$|Their goals <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{efficiency}} oriented {{rather than}} effectiveness oriented. The industry <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> mature, with well defined technology, products, and market segments. Most sales <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> repeat or replacement purchases. Individual strategic business units typically have moderate to {{low levels of}} autonomy.|$|R
5|$|As the {{demographics}} of the readership broadened, it became possible to include characters who were more or less undisguised homosexuals, but these, in accordance with the attitudes of the times, <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> villains: evil, demented, or effeminate stereotypes. The most popular role for the homosexual was as a 'decadent slaveholding lordling' whose corrupt tyranny was doomed to be overthrown by the young male heterosexual hero. During this period, lesbians were almost entirely unrepresented as either heroes or villains.|$|E
5|$|At least 150 {{black women}} were lynched between 1880 and 1965 in the American South. Historian Kerry Segrave {{highlights}} 115 recorded cases between 1851 and 1946. Ninety of the 115 were black, 19 white, and six Hispanic or uncertain. Women were usually not lynched alone, but <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> treated as accomplices {{of men who}} were being lynched. Of 97 incidents examined by Segrave, 36 were of women lynched alone.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 19thcentury and the {{beginning}} of the 20thcentury, the focus of Russian feminism shifted from the aristocracy to the peasants and working class. Imbued with socialist ideology, young women began to organize all-women unions among female factory workers, who <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> ignored or marginalized by male socialists.|$|E
50|$|TBox {{statements}} <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{more permanent}} within a knowledge base and <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{stored in a}} data model or a metadata registry. In contrast, ABox statements are much more dynamic in nature and <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> stored as instance data within transactional systems within databases.|$|R
25|$|Permanent tribunals <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> {{have their}} own rules and procedures, and <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> much more formal. They also <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more expensive, and, for {{procedural}} reasons, slower.|$|R
50|$|ASRs <b>are</b> often hard <b>to</b> {{define and}} articulate, <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{expressed}} vaguely, <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> initially neglected, <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> hidden within other requirements, and are subjective, variable, and situational.Other requirements could also demonstrate these descriptive characteristics. However, ASRs’ architectural significance made these characteristics’ manifestations unique and challenging for ASRs.|$|R
5|$|Aware {{that the}} public {{appreciated}} instrumental music with context, Liszt provided written prefaces for nine of his symphonic poems. However, Liszt's view of the symphonic poem <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> evocative, using music to create a general mood or atmosphere rather than to illustrate a narrative or describe something literally. In this regard, Liszt authority Humphrey Searle suggests {{that he may have}} been closer to his contemporary Hector Berlioz than to many who would follow him in writing symphonic poems.|$|E
5|$|By the 1850s {{there were}} several {{versions}} of football played in public schools and clubs throughout England. Each school played by their own code despite an attempt by Cambridge University to unify them in 1848. Their rules were generally inaccessible outside of the schools. There the football <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> unorganised and fairly lawless games known as mob football. Although there are matches between small, equal numbered teams it remained a minority sport until the 1860s.|$|E
5|$|Cimabue {{achieves}} a masterful handling of colour; medieval churches <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> extremely colourful, with frescoed walls, painted capitals, and gold leaf paintings. Pale tonalities dominate, {{with the main}} contrast found in the dark areas of Christ's hair and beard, which are utilised to make the features of his face stand out more, and position his head as the focal point.|$|E
50|$|This is {{typically}} frowned upon {{by teachers and}} cleaning staff as windows <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> broken and hallways <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> soaking wet.|$|R
25|$|Inflated: Narcissists' views <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{contrary}} <b>to</b> reality. In {{measures that}} compare self-report to objective measures, narcissists' self-views <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> greatly exaggerated.|$|R
50|$|When {{the final}} {{syllable}} is light (CV), stress <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> penultimate. When the final syllable is heavy (CVC, CVV, CVː), stress <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> final.|$|R
5|$|Early {{research}} {{showed that}} adding seductive details {{did not have}} the intended effect of improving learning; instead the seductive details <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> detrimental to the learner's recall. Adding interesting but unimportant sentences to expository texts hindered the learning of the main points of the text and learners would remember the seductive details better than the main text.|$|E
5|$|Ethnically, the Middle Colonies {{were more}} diverse {{than the other}} British colonial regions in North America and <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more {{socially}} tolerant. For example, in New York, any foreigner professing Christianity was awarded citizenship, leading to a more diverse populace. As a consequence, early German settlements in the Americas concentrated in the Middle Colonies region. Indentured servitude was especially common in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York in the eighteenth century, though fewer worked in agriculture.|$|E
5|$|Games <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{characterized}} by low scores and frequent punting, with crowds between 10,000 and 20,000; these numbers dropped {{off in the}} last two games of the era. A low scoring BC–Calgary game in Everett, Washington in 1967 drew just over 6,000; there would not be another CFL game in the United States until the cusp of US expansion itself in 1992.|$|E
