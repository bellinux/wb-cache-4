50|$|The beauty {{rat snake}} is largely traded in the Chinese snake skin and live snake trade. Overall, the Chinese beauty snake, <b>Taiwan</b> <b>beauty</b> <b>snake</b> and Vietnamese blue beauty snake {{are the most}} popular of the {{subspecies}} to be kept as pets. Pop culture has also been influenced by the beauty rat snake by having Mozler, the main monster from the 1988 Hong Kong film Thunder of Gigantic Serpent, be of the same species. Though Mozler displays a calm temperament, this is seen mainly in captive bred snakes. Wild caught snakes can have difficult dispositions despite being kept as pets for several years.|$|E
40|$|Helicobacter {{species are}} fastidious {{bacterial}} pathogens {{that are difficult}} to culture by standard methods. A PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) technique for detection and identification of different Helicobacter species was developed and evaluated. The method involves PCR detection of Helicobacter DNA by genus-specific primers that target 16 S rDNA and subsequent differentiation of Helicobacter PCR products by use of DGGE. Strains are identified by comparing mobilities of unknown samples to those determined for reference strains; sequence analysis can also be performed on purified amplicons. Sixteen DGGE profiles were derived from 44 type and reference strains of 20 Helicobacter species, indicating the potential of this approach for resolving infection of a single host by multiple Helicobacter species. Some more highly related species were not differentiated whereas in highly heterogeneous species, sequence divergence was observed and more than one PCR-DGGE profile was obtained. Application of the PCR-DGGE method to DNA extracted from faeces of zoo animals revealed the presence of Helicobacter DNA in 13 of 16 samples; a correlation was seen between the mobility of PCR products in DGGE analysis and DNA sequencing. In combination, this indicated that zoo animals are colonized by a wide range of different Helicobacter species; seven animals appeared to be colonized by multiple Helicobacter species. By this approach, presumptive identifications were made of Helicobacter bilis and Helicobacter hepaticus in a Nile crocodile, Helicobacter cinaedi in a baboon and a red panda, and Helicobacter felis in a wolf and a <b>Taiwan</b> <b>beauty</b> <b>snake.</b> All of these PCR products (400 bp) showed 100 % sequence similarity to 16 S rDNA sequences of the mentioned species. These results demonstrate the potential of PCR-DGGE-based analysis for identification of Helicobacter species in complex ecosystems, such as the gastrointestinal tract, and could contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the ecology of helicobacters and other pathogens with a complex aetiology...|$|E

40|$|The U. S. Department of Defense is in {{the process}} of {{restructuring}} military assets in the Pacific Basin that includes moving more troops to Guam. As a result of this process, the potential risk of vertebrate invasive species may increase across Micronesia. We identified the pathways through which goods and materials are moved throughout the Pacific basin and then developed a list of the most likely invasive vertebrates that could be moved in these pathways. We reviewed the available literature, interviewed experts, and evaluated pathways according to a fixed set of criteria to determine the risk of the pathway to transport invasive species. Some of the potentially high-risk pathways are military and commercial aircraft and vehicles, mail, shipping containers, and aquaculture. The following are species that may spread or become established in the Pacific without the implementation of measures to reduce risk: brown tree <b>snake,</b> habu, Asian <b>beauty</b> <b>snake,</b> common wolf snake, anole, gecko, coqui frog, cane toad, red-vented bulbul, Indian myna, and Indian mongoose...|$|R
50|$|Due {{to their}} {{preference}} for caves, these snakes have become able climbers and {{are known to}} move along cave walls. This ability becomes a strong asset for them {{when it comes to}} hunting. In addition, likely due to its cave-dwelling habits, <b>beauty</b> rat <b>snakes</b> are cathemeral, meaning that they are active at random times during the 24-hour day regardless of whether it is day or night outside.|$|R
50|$|The <b>beauty</b> rat <b>snake</b> {{species is}} oviparous and mating usually results {{about a month}} after {{hibernation}} period which is during times where the temperature is around 18 - 20 C.
