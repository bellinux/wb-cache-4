40|$|When {{computing}} 3 D {{interpretations of}} noisy 2 D images, many interpretations are often plausible. We describe a general framework for resolving such ambiguities in object recognition and reconstruction using maximum likelihood estimation. To this end we define measures of likelihood {{and stability of}} interpretations. We use these measures to select the "best" interpretation from the set of possible interpretations in object recognition or in reconstruction tasks. These measures also give a practical way to evaluate how "generic" views are, and identify "characteristic" views {{for the purpose of}} building multiview representations. To demonstrate the usefulness and generality of this framework, we computed the proposed stability and likelihood measures using 4 different kinds of image matching algorithms, matching: (1) feature points, (2) angles, (3) occluding contours of smooth surfaces, and (4) shaded images of smooth surfaces. 1 Introduction Consider the three images shown in the <b>top</b> <b>ro</b> [...] ...|$|E
40|$|In {{his memoir}} [Mem. Amer. Math. Soc. 49 (1984), no. 301; MR 0743546 (85 m: 11063) ] G. E. Andrews {{introduced}} {{the notion of}} an F-partition of n as a two-rowed array of nonnegative integers (a 1 a 2 ⋯arb 1 b 2 ⋯br), where each row is arranged in nonincreasing order and n=r+∑ri= 1 (ai+bi). The symbol cφk,h(n) denotes the number of F-partitions of n in which each part is repeated at most h times and is taken from k copies of the nonnegative integers. Describing the copies by subscripts the order is defined as follows: mi<nj if m<n, or, if m=n and i<j. In his memoir [op. cit. ] Andrews studied extensively the corresponding generating functions Cφk,h(q) =∑∞n= 0 cφk,h(n) qn in the cases k= 1 or h= 1, respectively. For example, he obtained infinite product expansions for (k,h) =(1, 1),(1, 2),(2, 1),(1, 3) and expressed Cφ 3, 1 (q) as a sum of two infinite products. Now, the author of this paper outlines a method of obtaining representations of Cφk,h(q) as a sum of infinite products for arbitrary positive integers k and h. The key of the method lies in the use of an appropriate generalization of a technical lemma (Lemma 3 in a paper by Andrews [Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 283 (1984), no. 2, 451 – 458; MR 0737878 (85 e: 11031) ]), which was formulated by Andrews in order to simplify the arguments in his proof of a certain Kac-Peterson identity. Besides another closed form for Cφ 2, 3 (q) the author explicitly states that Cφ 2, 2 (q) =A 0 (q) 2 (q 4;q 4) ∞(−q 2;q 4) 2 ∞+ 2 q− 1 [qB 0 (q) ] 2 (q 4;q 4) ∞(−q 4;q 4) 2 ∞, where (a;q) ∞=∏∞n= 0 (1 −aqn), A 0 (q) =Cφ 1, 2 (q) and qB 0 (q) =−(q;q) − 1 ∞(−q;q 2) ∞(−q 6;q 6) ∞ is the generating function for the symbols (a 1 a 2 ⋯arar+ 1 b 1 b 2 ⋯br), the original F-partition symbols related to Cφ 1, 2 (q) but with an additional element in the <b>top</b> <b>ro...</b>|$|E
40|$|Kinetic {{studies on}} the {{stability}} of the pain killer paracetamol in Al-Quds activated sludge demonstrated that paracetamol underwent biodegradation within less than one month to furnish p-aminophenol in high yields. Characterizations of bacteria contained in Al-Quds sludge were accomplished. It was found that Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the bacterium most responsible for the biodegradation of paracetamol to p-aminophenol and hydroquinone. Batch adsorptions of paracetamol and its biodegradation product (p-aminophenol) by activated charcoal and a composite micelle (octadecyltrimethylammonium) -clay (montmorillonite) were determined at 25 degrees C. Adsorption was adequately described by a Langmuir isotherm, and indicated better efficiency of removal by the micelle-clay complex. The ability of bench <b>top</b> reverse osmosis (<b>RO)</b> plant as well as advanced membrane pilot plant to remove paracetamol was also studied at different water matrixes to test the effect of organic matter composition. The results showed that at least 90 % rejection was obtained by both plants. In addition, removal of paracetamol from RO brine was investigated by using photocatalytic processes; optimal conditions were found to be acidic or basic pH, in which paracetamol degraded in less than 5 min. Toxicity studies indicated that the effluent and brine were not toxic except for using extra low energy membrane which displayed a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC- 50) value of 80 %...|$|R
40|$|The typical {{atmospheric}} {{boundary layer}} (ABL) over the southeast (SE) Pacific Ocean is featured {{with a strong}} temperature inversion and a sharp moisture gradient across the ABL top. The strong moisture and temperature gradients result in a sharp refractivity gradient that can be precisely detected by the Global Positioning System (GPS) radio occultation (RO) measurements. In this paper, the Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere & Climate (COSMIC) GPS RO soundings, radiosondes and the high-resolution ECMWF analysis over the SE Pacific are analyzed. COSMIC RO is able to detect {{a wide range of}} ABL height variations (1 – 2 km) as observed from the radiosondes. However, the ECMWF analysis systematically underestimates the ABL heights. The sharp refractivity gradient at the ABL top frequently exceeds the critical refraction (e. g., − 157 N-unit km − 1) and becomes the so-called ducting condition, which results in a systematic RO refractivity bias (or called N -bias) inside the ABL. Simulation study based on radiosonde profiles reveals the magnitudes of the N -biases are vertical resolution dependent. The $N$-bias is also the primary cause of the systematically smaller refractivity gradient (rarely exceeding − 110 N-unit km − 1) at the ABL <b>top</b> from <b>RO</b> measurement. However, the N -bias seems not affect the ABL height detection. Instead, the very large RO bending angle and the sharp refractivity gradient due to ducting allow reliable detection of the ABL height from GPS RO. The seasonal mean climatology of ABL heights derived from a nine-month composite of COSMIC RO soundings over the SE Pacific reveals significant differences from the ECMWF analysis. Both show an increase of ABL height from the shallow stratocumulus near the coast to a much higher trade wind inversion further off the coast. However, COSMIC RO shows an overall deeper ABL and reveals different locations of the minimum and maximum ABL heights as compared to the ECMWF analysis. At low latitudes, despite the decreasing number of COSMIC RO soundings and the lower percentage of soundings that penetrate into the lowest 500 -m above the mean-sea-level, there are small sampling errors in the mean ABL height climatology. The difference of ABL height climatology between COSMIC RO and ECMWF analysis over SE Pacific is significant and requires further studies...|$|R
40|$|The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Occultation Sounder (GNOS) {{is one of}} the new {{generation}} payloads onboard the Chinese FengYun 3 (FY- 3) series of operational meteorological satellites for sounding the Earth’s neutral atmosphere and ionosphere. GNOS was designed for acquiring setting and rising radio occultation (RO) data by using GNSS signals from both the Chinese BeiDou System (BDS) and the U. S. Global Positioning System (GPS). An ultra-stable oscillator with 1 -sec stability (Allan deviation) at the level of 10 − 12 was installed on FY- 3 C GNOS, thus both zero-difference and single-difference excess phase processing methods should be feasible for FY- 3 C GNOS observations. In this study we focus on evaluating zero-difference processing of BDS RO data vs. single-difference processing, in order to investigate the zero-difference feasibility for this new instrument, which after its launch in September 2013 started to use BDS signals from 5 geostationary orbit (GEO) satellites, 5 inclined geosynchronous orbit (IGSO) satellites and 4 medium earth orbit (MEO) satellites. We used a 3 -month set of GNOS BDS RO data (October to December 2013) for the evaluation and compared atmospheric bending angle and refractivity profiles, derived from single- and zero-difference excess phase data, against co-located profiles from ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts) analyses. We also compared against co-located refractivity profiles from radiosondes. The statistical evaluation against these reference data shows that the results from single- and zero-difference processing are consistent in both bias and standard deviation, clearly demonstrating the feasibility of zero-differencing for GNOS BDS RO observations. The average bias (and standard deviation) of the bending angle and refractivity profiles were found to be as small as about 0. 05  %– 0. 2  % (and 0. 7  %– 1. 6  %) over the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere, including for the GEO, IGSO, and MEO subsets. Zero-differencing was found to perform slightly better, as may be expected from its lower vulnerability to noise. The validation results establish that GNOS can provide, on <b>top</b> of GPS <b>RO</b> profiles, accurate and precise BDS RO profiles both from single- and zero-difference processing. The GNOS observations by the series of FY- 3 satellites will thus provide important contributions to numerical weather prediction and global climate change analysis...|$|R
