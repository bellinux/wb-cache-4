50|$|Some <b>top-loading</b> <b>machines</b> use {{mechanisms}} {{very similar}} to front-loading drum machines, and are described below.|$|E
5000|$|True front-loaders, and <b>top-loading</b> <b>machines</b> with horizontal-axis drum as {{described}} above, {{can be compared}} with top-loaders {{on a number of}} aspects: ...|$|E
50|$|In <b>top-loading</b> <b>machines,</b> the Downy Ball accomplishes {{this with}} no user input, {{other than the}} initial loading, and filling of the ball.|$|E
50|$|In the 1940s, Thor {{introduced}} the Automagic hybrid washer/dishwasher. The <b>top-loading</b> <b>machine</b> included both a removable clothes washing drum and a dish-washing drum. The Automagic was widely marketed but {{disappeared from the}} marketplace soon after its introduction, as many consumers soured {{to the idea of}} washing dirty clothing and dishes in the same machine.|$|R
50|$|Most washer dryer {{combination}} {{units are}} of the front-loading design. This allows for easier access, better efficiency, and more effective washes than top-loading designs. Instead of just leaving the clothes to soak in the water throughout the entire wash, like a <b>top-loading</b> <b>machine</b> would do, the front-loading design tilts the drum on its side, so that {{the contents of the}} drum are repeatedly lifted {{in and out of the}} water throughout the wash cycle.|$|R
50|$|While a <b>top-loading</b> washing <b>machine</b> {{could use}} a {{universal}} motor or DC brushless motor, it is conventional for <b>top-loading</b> washing <b>machines</b> to use more expensive, heavy, and more electrically efficient and reliable induction motors. The action of a front-loading washing machine is better suited to a motor capable of reversing direction with every reversal of the wash basket; a universal motor is noisier, less efficient, doesn't last as long, but is better suited {{to the task of}} reversing direction every few seconds.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} {{variations}} of the two general designs. <b>Top-loading</b> <b>machines</b> in Asia use impellers instead of agitators. Impellers are similar to agitators except {{that they do not}} have the center post extending up in the middle of the wash tub basket.|$|E
5000|$|Water leakage: <b>Top-loading</b> <b>machines</b> {{are less}} prone to leakage, because simple gravity can {{reliably}} keep water from spilling out the loading door on top. True front-loading machines require a flexible seal or gasket on the front door, and the front door must be locked during operation to prevent opening, lest large amounts of water spill out. This seal may leak and require replacement. However, many current front-loaders use so little water {{that they can be}} stopped mid-cycle for addition or removal of laundry, while keeping the water level in the horizontal tub below the door level. Best practice installations of either type of machine will include a floor drain or an overflow catch tray with a drain connection, since neither design is immune to leakage or a solenoid valve getting stuck in the open position.|$|E
50|$|In 1992, Candy {{acquired}} Mayc-Otsein of Spain, {{a specialist}} in <b>top-loading</b> washing <b>machines.</b> The following year saw the addition of Iberna in Italy, a well-known national brand in the cooling segment.|$|R
50|$|On 4 November 2016, Samsung {{recalled}} 2.8 million <b>top-load</b> washing <b>machines</b> sold at home appliance stores from 2011 to 2016 {{because the}} machine's top could unexpectedly detach from the chassis during use {{that could be}} caused by excessive vibration.|$|R
50|$|In 1985, the Group {{acquired}} Zerowatt, {{producer of}} <b>top-loading</b> washing <b>machines</b> and dryers. This {{was followed by}} Gasfire, an Italian prestigious name in built-in cooking appliances. In 1987, came Rosi√®res, a prestigious French brand, well known for its top-of-the-range built-in cooking appliances.|$|R
50|$|Since the {{agitator}} and the drum are {{separate and distinct}} in a <b>top-loading</b> washing <b>machine,</b> the mechanism of a top-loader is inherently more complicated than a front-loading machine. Manufacturers have devised several ways to control the motion of {{the agitator}} during wash and rinse separately from the high speed rotation of the drum required for the spin cycle.|$|R

He is emptying a cloth laundry bag into a <b>top-load</b> washing <b>machine.</b> Written in the bottom and right-hand margins: " 49 % 10 -A 11 - 196 - 185 " and "Each residential college has its own laundry room".

50|$|The IBM 1311 Disk Storage Drive was {{announced}} on October 11, 1962 and {{was designed for}} use with several medium-scale business and scientific computers. The 1311 was about {{the size and shape}} of a <b>top-loading</b> washing <b>machine</b> and stored 2 million characters (12,000,000 bits) on a removable IBM 1316 disk pack. Seven models of the 1311 were introduced during the 1960s. They were withdrawn during the early 1970s.|$|R
5000|$|Hoovermatic; A long {{running line}} of <b>top-loading</b> washing <b>{{machines}}</b> which ran from 1948 until 1992, sold mainly in Europe, Australia and New Zealand. Hoovermatics were also sold in North America under the Washdog name. The machines used a unique washing action which {{made use of}} an impeller (known as a [...] "Pulsator") which span at high speed to create a moving current {{of water in the}} wash tub that dragged the laundry through the water.|$|R
50|$|In the 1990s, Staber Industries {{began to}} shift its {{resources}} {{to the development of}} its own line of residential laundry appliances. The current product line includes a high efficiency <b>top-loading</b> horizontal-axis washing <b>machine,</b> a clothes dryer, and a clothes drying cabinet.|$|R
5000|$|Ariel first {{appeared}} on the UK market in 1967 {{and was the first}} detergent with stain-removing enzymes. It was a high-sudsing powder designed for twin-tub and <b>top-loading</b> washing <b>machines.</b> For front loading automatics, Procter & Gamble initially introduced [...] "Low Suds Bold Automatic" [...] powder. Though with the increasing popularity of automatic front-loading washing machines, a suitable low-suds variant [...] "Ariel Automatic" [...] was eventually launched in the early 1980s. The mid-eighties saw the range expanding to encompass liquid detergent and compact powder.|$|R
50|$|During {{a normal}} cycle, most Whirlpool-built wig-wag {{equipped}} washers will fill, start the motor, then engage the wash solenoid. Upon {{completion of the}} wash mode, the wash (agitate) solenoid will be turned off, which will allow the pump to drain the tub. After a minute or two, the timer will then engage the spin wig-wag which will cause {{the rotation of the}} tub. This is in contrast to most other <b>top-load</b> washing <b>machines</b> which start spinning and draining simultaneously. There are no pauses between cycles in these machines.|$|R
50|$|The Downy Ball is {{a variant}} sold by Procter & Gamble {{specifically}} designed for use with traditional agitator-based <b>top-loading</b> washing <b>machines</b> which lack built-in fabric softener dispensers, and it won't work correctly on front-loading machines. Liquid fabric softener is poured into the Downy Ball through a hole on the top side. The ball is then tossed into the washing machine with the clothes and detergent, where it floats in a vertical position, with an internal rubber weight floating inside and trapping the softener inside. In the spin cycle, between the wash and rinse cycles, the internal rubber weight moves aside due to Newton's first law of motion, allowing the fabric softener to spill out onto the clothes, {{just in time for}} the rinse cycle.|$|R
