5|$|The new depot at Temple Mills, to {{the north}} of Stratford, {{replaced}} the North Pole depot in the west of London. In testing, the first Eurostar train ran in St Pancras on 6 March 2007. All CTRL connections are fully grade-separated. This is achieved through use of viaducts, bridges, cuttings and in one case, the <b>tunnel</b> <b>portal</b> itself.|$|E
5|$|After closure {{the tunnel}} was sealed, {{although}} it remains structurally intact inside. The {{site of the}} lower terminus was cleared and is now an empty site surrounded with construction hoarding. There is a small roundabout directly outside the south <b>tunnel</b> <b>portal.</b> Hereson Road station is now a used car dealership. Four of the cars were sold to the Hollycombe Steam Collection and remain in use, while the remaining three {{were given to the}} Hampshire Narrow Gauge Railway Society. Most of the rails and sleepers were sold to the Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway.|$|E
5|$|As the Henry Hudson Parkway {{replaced}} Riverside Drive in the mid-1930s, NY9A {{was moved}} onto it, eventually {{using the new}} parkway to where it crossed US9 (Broadway) in the Bronx. Here, NY9A exited the parkway and ran concurrent with US9 to the split in Yonkers. The Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel connecting Manhattan's Battery Park to Brooklyn was completed in 1950. By 1960, {{an extension of the}} West Side Elevated Highway south to the Manhattan <b>tunnel</b> <b>portal</b> became part of NY27A, which had ended in Brooklyn prior to the construction of the tunnel. On January1, 1970, NY27A was truncated on its western end to eastern Nassau County while NY27 was extended northward over NY27A's former routing through the Battery Tunnel and the West Side Elevated Highway.|$|E

5|$|In 2015, the Department of Planning, Transport and Infrastructure {{announced}} a $160 million proposed O-Bahn City Access Project. The existing entry/exit at Hackney Road will be retained, but upgraded bus-only lanes on Hackney Road {{will lead to}} a new <b>tunnel</b> <b>portal</b> with bus guide rails commencing near the Adelaide Botanic Garden. The tunnel will pass under the Botanic Road intersection, then curve to the west under Rundle Park, Rundle Road and surface in Rymill Park leading to a redesigned intersection at Grenfell Street and East Terrace. Construction was anticipated to start in late 2015 with the project completed in 2017. The contract to complete the detailed design and construct the tunnel was let to McConnell Dowell in October 2015. SAGE Automation will provide expertise in the mechanical and electrical aspects of the tunnel including ventilation and safety systems. Construction started in March 2016 with removal of the median strip and preparation of central bus lanes. It is still expected to be completed by the end of 2017.|$|E
5|$|The {{road was}} built as an {{approach}} to the Lincoln Tunnel, with the first section opening December 22, 1937, when the first (now the center) tube of the tunnel was completed. This section ran only from the <b>tunnel</b> <b>portal</b> south through the toll booths to a plaza with Park Avenue and Hudson County Boulevard East. Marginal Street, providing access from Hudson County Boulevard East west over Park Avenue to 32nd Street and the Bergen Turnpike, was also opened at that time. In 1939, the Port Authority opened {{the rest of the}} approach, up the helix and west to Route 3, and it was designated as an eastern extension of Route 3. The final section of today's Route 495 opened on January 15, 1952, with the completion of the New Jersey Turnpike. The turnpike interchange (exit 16) only served Route 3 traffic to and from the south; exit 17 served Route 3 traffic to and from the north.|$|E
25|$|Line 2 and the Attiko Metro {{portion of}} Line 3 is entirely underground. Line 1 is {{primarily}} in the open, with a tunnel section in central Athens. The airport section of Line 3, east of the <b>tunnel</b> <b>portal</b> near , is open. In the tunnel sections up and down lines share a common tunnel, except for approaches to stations with an island platform (such as Egaleo).|$|E

25|$|Railroad south (geographically east) of the station, {{the line}} gains a center track from Pitkin Yard, leaves the subway tunnel and ramps {{up to the}} {{elevated}} tracks along Liberty Avenue. At the <b>tunnel</b> <b>portal,</b> another track from Pitkin Yard merges with the southbound local track. The line continues as three tracks, towards 80th Street station on Liberty Avenue. The two yard tracks are located under the station.|$|E
25|$|On December 1, 1974, a {{southbound}} shuttle {{train of}} R32s was approaching the <b>tunnel</b> <b>portal</b> {{en route from}} Franklin Avenue when it derailed on the crossover and smashed the same place where BRT car 100 had hit in the Malbone Street Wreck. This derailment resulted in some injuries, {{but there were no}} fatalities, because time signals limit the speed of trains coming down the hill from Crown Heights.|$|E
25|$|Between 34th and 59th Streets {{there are}} a lot of car dealerships: Mercedes-Benz is located across from the {{westbound}} Lincoln <b>Tunnel</b> <b>portal,</b> and BMW and Lexus at the intersection with West 57th Street. Manhattan Motorcars at 270 Eleventh Avenue sells many brands of luxury and sports cars. Other companies with dealerships on the avenue include Audi, Honda, Jaguar, Jeep/Chrysler/Dodge, Mazda, Nissan, Toyota. As well, numerous vehicle service stations, car washes, and car rental lots are found along this stretch.|$|E

25|$|The line's {{connection}} with the Atlantic Branch at Woodhaven Junction, consisting of an interlocking, <b>tunnel</b> <b>portal</b> and incline that rose to meet the elevated Rockaway Branch, was closed and removed in October 1955. This connection had primarily been used to allow trains from Brooklyn to reach Aqueduct Racetrack. The remains of the interlocking can still {{be seen in the}} Atlantic Avenue tunnel, while the incline is now used by Logan School Bus Company, who parks their bus fleet along the incline.|$|E
25|$|The station {{building}} {{opened in}} 1963 still exists {{and is now}} owned by KiwiRail through Tranz Scenic. The Lyttelton Port of Christchurch now owns the land behind the station building for which access is restricted to authorised personnel. The original Lyttelton station signal box also survives, and is now sited near the station building. It was originally located at {{the western end of}} the yard near the <b>tunnel</b> <b>portal.</b> All railway-related facilities on wharf no. 2 have been removed including the railway/ferry inter-modal facilities.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to extending the Market Street subway tunnel west to 46th Street, with new stations at 30th, 34th and 40th streets, a new trolley tunnel was built under Market, Ludlow and 36th {{streets and the}} former Woodland Avenue, leading to a new western portal at 40th Street for routes 11, 13, 34 and 36 (route 10 trolleys use a separate portal at 36th and Ludlow). New stations for the trolleys were constructed at 22nd, 30th, 33rd (between Market and Ludlow), 36th (at Sansom), and 37th (at Spruce) streets. The 24th Street trolley station and <b>tunnel</b> <b>portal</b> was abandoned. The tunnel mouth was visible from Market Street until the Philadelphia Gas and Electric Company (now PECO) built an office building on the site in 1969.|$|E

25|$|In February 2006, State Transportation Secretary John Cogliano {{proposed}} a $94 million {{plan that would}} eliminate most of the tunneling and cost of the original proposal while still connecting the two phases of the service. Under Cogliano's plan, the Silver Line would run on the surface via Kneeland Street and Surface Road to a new <b>tunnel</b> <b>portal</b> on Essex Street near South Station. A fare-controlled shelter would be added at Downtown Crossing. The plan also included expansion of surface Silver Line service, with a new branch running from Copley Square into the Essex Street portal to provide a one-seat ride from the Back Bay area. The southern branch would be extended from Dudley to the Red Line stations at Mattapan via Blue Hill Avenue (replacing the #28 bus) and Ashmont via Washington Street (replacing the #23 bus), with additional connections to the Fairmount commuter rail line at the then-planned Blue Hill Avenue and Four Corners/Geneva Ave stations. The plan was popular with Bay Village residents who had been worried about the full-length tunnel, but attracted criticism because it would not substantially speed travel times to downtown.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] bypass would bypass {{both the}} tunnel and the Bender Bridge which crossed Paint Creek just {{to the east of}} the <b>tunnel</b> <b>portal.</b> On July 6, 1987, the Memorial Tunnel officially closed, and two lanes of the open cut just to the north of it were opened. The other two lanes of the open cut were {{completed}} in late August.|$|E
2500|$|The Channel Tunnel Rail Link (CTRL), {{now called}} High Speed 1, runs [...] from St Pancras railway station in London to the <b>tunnel</b> <b>portal</b> at Folkestone in Kent. It cost £5.8billion. On 16 September 2003 the prime minister, Tony Blair, opened {{the first section}} of High Speed 1, from Folkestone to north Kent. On 6 November 2007 the Queen officially opened High Speed 1 and St Pancras International station, {{replacing}} the original slower link to Waterloo International railway station. High Speed 1 trains travel at up to , the journey from London to Paris taking 2hours 15minutes, to Brussels 1hour 51minutes.|$|E

2500|$|At {{approximately}} [...] below street level, it is {{the deepest}} station in the New York City Subway system. In 1947, Victor Hess, who won the 1936 Nobel Prize in Physics for his discovery of cosmic rays, wrote to the Board of Transportation asking if he could use the station [...] "to carry out experiments on the radiation emitted from rocks at a location well protected from cosmic rays." [...] Hess ultimately was allowed to conduct his experiments in the nearby 190th Street station on the IND Eighth Avenue Line, which is also located far below ground. Despite {{the depth of the}} 191st Street station, the next station north, Dyckman Street, is just above ground level. This is because 191st Street is at nearly the highest point on the island of Manhattan and this station is deep in the Washington Heights Mine Tunnel, while Dyckman Street runs along a deep valley almost at sea level and its station is at the <b>tunnel</b> <b>portal,</b> despite the fact that both stations are at the same elevation above sea level.|$|E
2500|$|The {{lower level}} was {{abandoned}} afterwards {{and has not}} been used since except for filming of the original Crocodile Dundee movie when it posed as the 59th Street – Columbus Circle station {{at the end of the}} movie. However, the [...] "9" [...] wall mosaics and the sunlight seen at the very end of the film made it clear it was Ninth Avenue. The level is dark and there are no safety plates on the two staircases to that level. A fluorescent light remains on the southbound side. The next stop for this shuttle to the south (east) was Fort Hamilton Parkway. The tracks curve just east of the station before the center and southbound local end at bumper blocks, at the east end of the <b>tunnel</b> <b>portal.</b> The northbound local continues past the portal and runs along another track coming from the 36th–38th Street Yard, but does not connect with it. This track was the track used during Ninth Avenue – Ditmas Avenue shuttle operation from 1959 until 1975.|$|E
