40|$|Forty {{years after}} {{completing}} the archaeological investigations in the Salgado region, northeastern Pará, researchers {{have returned to the}} site to study prehistoric human occupations in the northern coastal regions of Brazil near the Amazon estuary. This article presents the first results of archaeological research at the site Jabuti, located in the Caeté-Taperuçu Marine Extractive Reserve in the municipality of Bragança. This is an open-air residential site with anthropogenic dark earths ('terra preta de índio') and ceramic remains. The archeological remains consist mostly of fragments of pottery, as well as some flaked stone <b>tools</b> <b>and</b> <b>dye</b> residues. The sole C 14 date obtained indicates that the site was occupied at least 2, 900 years BP. According to this timing, the occupation occurred in the second stage of the model established by Pedro Walfir Martins Souza Filho and collaborators, in a paper published in 2009, for the geological evolution of the Bragança zone along the Salgado coast. Thus the site was situated on the largest soil-bearing island near the mainland. The ceramic material of this site belongs to the Mina tradition. Initially two hypotheses are proposed: 1) the Mina pottery indicates contact between shell midden groups and other ceramic-making groups, or 2) shell midden groups have begun a shift in their subsistence pattern towards cultivation...|$|R

If we can find people … willing to obey the laws and pay taxes for the support of our institutions, we must open our doors to these people and give them such encouragement as will overcome the initial difficulties of their change of situation. Clifford Sifton, Minister of the Interior, Statement to the House of Commons, July 1899. Indeed, not much has changed from Sifton’s statement over a century ago: Canada still needs immigrants. But we no longer need farmers to till vast expanses of land. Today we need IT specialists, production managers, researchers, carpenters, <b>and</b> <b>tool</b> <b>and</b> <b>dye</b> workers, to name a few, and we need them in our cities. 1 Today it is the urban centers that are the engine and the lifeline of the national economy.

Its district area extends immediately to the east of İzmir's eastern-most metropolitan district, Bornova, and Kemalpaşa town being at a distance of only 29 km from the historical and traditional center of İzmir, (Konak), it pulsates along with the rhythm of the big city, with corresponding high levels of development in terms of industry and services. İzmir-Ankara highway crosses the district area [...] {{to the north of the}} district center. Kemalpaşa district area borders on the administrative divisions of Manisa center in the north, Manisa's depending district of Turgutlu in the east and İzmir's depending districts of Torbalı and Bayındır in the south. The eastern and southern parts of Kemalpaşa district preserve their markedly rural characteristics, which results in an urbanization rate of only 25.7 for the district area as a whole, despite the presence of a strong industrial base in and to the west of Kemalpaşa town. Kemalpaşa's very large organized industrial zone (KOSBİ) brings together producers of construction materials, rubber and plastic goods, textiles and clothing, leather, paper, packaging materials, machinery and other equipment, including electrical <b>tools</b> <b>and</b> installations, <b>dyes</b> <b>and</b> other chemical substances, marble and car parts, as well as foundries and other metalworks. Agriculture also occupies a portion with high added value in Kemalpaşa's economy, its cherries being of nationwide renown (known as Kemalpaşa kirazı in Turkish) and exported. Literacy is at a high level at 90%, and the neighboring Bornova, where Ege University is based, serves as a nearby pool in terms of trained personnel.|$|R
