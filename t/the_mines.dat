5|$|Although Captain Apolinar Calvo of the Corregidor {{had prior}} {{experience}} navigating the mined entrance to Manila Bay (<b>the</b> <b>mines</b> {{had been in}} place since July), the Navy had changed its procedures on that day. Rather than post a gunboat near the safe channel as they had in days previous, lighted buoys were used to guide boats through. As the Corregidor sailed close to the island of Corregidor {{to pass through the}} channel at around 01:00, the ship was observed turning toward the electrically-controlled minefield. Some officers posted at the Army's Seaward Defense Command headquarters on the island recommended that <b>the</b> <b>mines</b> be temporarily disarmed so that the ship could pass through the minefield. A number of accounts state that Seaward Defense Commander Colonel Paul Bunker ordered that <b>the</b> <b>mines</b> be kept active.|$|E
5|$|As war approached, it {{was decided}} to retain her as a {{minelayer}} and most of the extra fire control equipment was removed. She was transferred to Brest as part of the reorganization of the 5e Escadre. She sailed for Casablanca, French Morocco on 2 September with 125 Bréguet mines embarked. She was ordered to lay a defensive minefield there on 4 September, but this order was rescinded the next day, after <b>the</b> <b>mines</b> had already been fuzed, and the ship was ordered to disembark <b>the</b> <b>mines.</b> While landing <b>the</b> <b>mines</b> on 13 September one of them exploded, destroying the ship and killing 186 people. A further 73 crewmen and 47 others were injured and significant damage was caused by flying debris. One gun and some armor was salvaged during the war, but demolition work did not begin until October 1952 and was completed by July 1953.|$|E
5000|$|Once <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> lands, it {{launches}} seven tripwires before arming itself. Any {{disturbance of}} the tripwires will trigger <b>the</b> <b>mine.</b> <b>The</b> <b>mine</b> is entirely electrically detonated, if the battery level of <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> drops below a pre-set level - <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> self-destructs. Even if <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> does not self-destruct, the battery will fully discharge after 14 days, rendering <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> inactive.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> larvae <b>mines</b> <b>the</b> {{stems of}} Phalaris arundiacea, Phragmites australis and other grasses on occasion. <b>The</b> <b>mine</b> starts at <b>the</b> leaf tip and descends as an {{irregular}} blotch <b>mine.</b> <b>The</b> <b>mine</b> is flat and quite shallow. The frass is initially {{deposited in the}} oldest, upper part of <b>the</b> <b>mine,</b> but later in strings. The larva may leave <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> and restart elsewhere.

5000|$|The MN-121 is a Polish scatterable {{anti-tank}} mine, externally {{similar to}} <b>the</b> German AT-2 <b>mine.</b> <b>The</b> <b>mine</b> is cylindrical with ten wire legs which fold outward to keep <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> upright. <b>The</b> <b>mine</b> uses a magnetic influence fuze, which triggers <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> when a vehicle passes over it. <b>The</b> <b>mine</b> {{also has an}} anti-handling device which triggers <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> if it is moved. <b>The</b> <b>mine's</b> warhead is a shaped charge design containing approximately 700 grams of RDX. The manufacturer claims that {{it is capable of}} penetrating 60 millimeters of armour at an offset of half a meter.|$|R
5|$|At {{the age of}} 15 he was an {{offered a}} trial at Leeds United, where his uncle Jim was left back, but turned it down and instead joined his father in <b>the</b> <b>mines.</b> He worked in <b>the</b> <b>mines</b> {{for a short time}} but handed in his notice after finding out just how {{difficult}} and unpleasant it was to work deep underground. He applied to join the police and reconsidered the offer from Leeds United. His trial game for Leeds clashed with his police interview, and Charlton chose to play in the game; the trial was a success and he joined the ground staff at Elland Road.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{introduction}} of the mechanical ore crusher in 1804 the tasks traditionally carried out by bal maidens began to be mechanised. Despite this, the rapid growth of <b>the</b> <b>mines</b> in comparison to the slow spread of mechanisation meant the number of bal maidens appears to have risen steadily, although statistics for the number of women employed in <b>the</b> <b>mines</b> {{in the early days of}} industrialisation are incomplete and a few are contradictory.|$|E
5|$|Over the {{remaining}} {{months of the}} year the division carried out patrols of the rail and road networks, which were being mined. Some of <b>the</b> <b>mines</b> killed men from the division attempting to disarm them, until orders were issued to blow <b>the</b> <b>mines</b> up rather than disarm them. Then on 2December a road mine killed four men from the 2nd Forward Observation Unit (Airborne).|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>mine</b> can be {{deployed}} either from aircraft, a specialised mine laying system or 122 mm artillery rockets. When required <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> is ejected from a storage canister, and shortly afterwards a small parachute is opened, which both retards the descent and keeps <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> correctly oriented as it descends. Once <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> lands on <b>the</b> ground {{the top of}} <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> is ejected, along with the parachute and the spring-loaded legs bring <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> upright.|$|R
50|$|The MN-111 is a Polish air-dropped {{anti-tank}} landmine. <b>The</b> <b>mine</b> {{is designed}} for use on soft ground. <b>The</b> <b>mine</b> is cylindrical with six spring-loaded fins attached to one end of <b>the</b> <b>mine,</b> with <b>the</b> cylinder drawn to a point {{at the opposite end}} which is topped with a small wind vane. <b>The</b> <b>mine</b> is stored with the fins wrapped round the outside of <b>the</b> <b>mine.</b> Once <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> is dropped from the aircraft the fins spring outward, acting as a drag parachute, slowing the rate of descent to a peak speed of about 60 meters per second. As <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> drops <b>the</b> wind vane spins, generating the power used to arm <b>the</b> <b>mine.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Climax Molybdenum Company re-opened <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> in 1924, and it {{operated}} <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> nearly continuously until <b>the</b> 1980s. <b>The</b> <b>mine</b> {{was shut}} down between 1995 and 2012, awaiting higher molybdenum prices. <b>The</b> <b>mine's</b> current owner, Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold, continues to work on environmental cleanup of past operations while holding <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> ready in <b>the</b> event of market changes.|$|R
5|$|Owing to the {{scarcity}} of artefacts and inscriptions relating to Menkauhor's reign, few of his activities are known.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>mine</b> {{continued}} to operate until November 1984, supplying coal to the Toowoomba Hospital. When <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> closed, <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> structures were bought by Kath and John Greenhalgh, {{the owners of}} the farm on which <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> was located. <b>The</b> Greenhalghs kept <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> intact and opened it as a museum. In 2000, when the Greenhalghs decided to retire from the land, they sold <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> to <b>the</b> Rosalie Shire Council. It ceased to operate as a museum from that time.|$|R
50|$|The larvae feed on Artemisia campestris and Artemisia vulgaris. They <b>mine</b> <b>the</b> {{leaves of}} their host plant. <b>The</b> <b>mine</b> {{consists}} of an upper surface blotch, with a conspicuous yellow-orange tinge. The larva lines the inside of <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> with silk, causing <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> to pucker up strongly. <b>The</b> <b>mine</b> is preceded by a long lower-surface corridor, running along the midrib or the leaf margin. Older larvae start eating parts of the upper epidermis. The black frass is deposited in the centre of <b>the</b> <b>mine.</b> Pupation takes place outside of <b>the</b> <b>mine.</b>|$|R
5000|$|According to <b>the</b> <b>mine’s</b> {{environmental}} impact statement it will produce 200 million tonnes of carbon dioxide over the expected 60-year life of <b>the</b> <b>mine.</b> [...] This includes gases produced during <b>the</b> <b>mining</b> process and from emissions created from <b>the</b> <b>mining</b> and transportation of the coal.|$|R
5|$|The line {{operated}} successfully and settlements of people {{attracted to the}} area {{by the prospect of}} employment in <b>the</b> <b>mines</b> grew around the Brendon ridge. However changes in the availability of imported ore made <b>the</b> <b>mines</b> a less attractive proposition and by 1883 <b>the</b> <b>mines</b> were closed and mineral traffic on the railway ceased. In 1879 the railway announced that the wages of all staff would be reduced. The passenger service continued until 7 November 1898; a brief resumption took place from 1907 (but not west of Brendon Hill) until final closure to passengers in 1910. The 1895 Bradshaw Railway Guide shows two return trips every day, at 09:15 and 15:10 from Watchet, calling at Washford, Roadwater and Comberow, taking 30 minutes; return trains were at 10:45 and 16:15, also taking 30 minutes.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>mines</b> {{remained}} closed {{until the}} winter of 1926, causing a severe loss to GWR, which was also starting to feel competition from road transport.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>mines</b> {{soon became}} uneconomic to operate and closed in 1871. Livestock, {{artificial}} fertiliser, and farm produce {{made up the}} majority of the remaining freight traffic.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>mine</b> {{has been}} blamed for {{dividing}} the people in local communities in the region into those that have found well-paying jobs in <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> and prospered, while those that have not remain poor. A strike at <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> in 2004 was aimed at countering this issue, resulting in a promise by <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> owners to invest into the local communities after <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> closure.|$|R
50|$|The PM-60 or K-1 is a German round plastic cased minimum metal {{anti-tank}} blast <b>mine.</b> <b>The</b> case of <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> {{consists of}} two halves joined together by sixteen plastic nuts, giving <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> a distinctive appearance. The top of <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> has a large pressure plate which rests {{on top of the}} fuze assembly. Two fuzes are available for <b>the</b> <b>mine,</b> a conventional ball bearing retained striker and a chemical fuze, containing a glass ampule of acid over a flash composition. When <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> is deployed with the chemical fuze {{it is very difficult to}} detect because the only metal in <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> is <b>the</b> detonator capsule. There is a secondary fuze well on the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> that can accept a fuze allowing remote command detonation of <b>the</b> <b>mine.</b>|$|R
50|$|According to the {{regional}} historian Jürgen Bartholomäus, <b>the</b> <b>mining</b> ledger of <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> Ada had been stored at <b>the</b> <b>mining</b> authorities in Senftenberg until the 1990s.|$|R
5|$|The {{pulling power}} of the Trait du Nord made it popular for use during the Industrial Revolution of the late 19th century in heavy industry, {{including}} mining. In mines, steam engines and internal combustion engines {{could not be used}} due to the possibility of a gas explosion. The first horses were used in <b>the</b> <b>mines</b> in 1821 and the Trait du Nord quickly became a favorite for hauling carts in <b>the</b> <b>mines</b> and operating the pulleys used to lift coal to the surface. Breeders worked to adapt the breed to mining requirements, and the breed became larger as more power was needed to pull heavier loads. Good horses were able to pull , usually around twelve cars worth, along a railway. As early as 1920, the usage of horses in mines began to decline as electric locomotives came into use, and in 1969 the last horse was removed from <b>the</b> <b>mines.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{few years}} after the strike, the world's silver market dropped, causing the {{foreclosure}} of many of <b>the</b> <b>mines.</b> To compensate for the drop in prices, the mines' stockholders reduced the wages of the miners. Instead of striking again, the miners accepted this. In addition, the miners inadvertently dug below the water table, and the mine shafts began filling with water faster than it could be pumped out. By 1884, most of <b>the</b> <b>mines</b> were idle or closed; the last was officially closed in 1891, although lessees of <b>the</b> <b>mines</b> continued to operate them past that year. Many merchants went bankrupt and left town. The Silver Reef mines produced about $8million worth of silver ore. Between 1891 and 1901, another $250,000 worth was mined. Several people attempted to restart mining operations in 1898, 1909, 1916, and 1950, {{but none of these}} attempts were successful. After Silver Reef's mines were closed, many of the buildings were purchased for their lumber and building stone. One buyer dismantled the building he bought and discovered $10,000 in gold coins. News of the find spread quickly, and most of the buildings in Silver Reef were demolished in hopes of discovering more gold, but none was found.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time as the Cornish mining {{industry}} went into decline, public opposition to the use of female and child labour in mines was rising. The Metalliferous Mines Regulation Act 1872 brought <b>the</b> <b>mines</b> of Cornwall under the provisions of <b>the</b> <b>Mines</b> Act 1842, which had previously applied only to coal mines, limiting the use of child labour in <b>the</b> <b>mines</b> and thus increasing costs. The Act prohibited women from working underground, which the bal maidens did not do, but it also forbade any child under ten from working in any mine, even on the surface. The passing of the Factory and Workshop Act 1878 drastically limited the use of female and child labour. The employment of children under 10 was banned outright, the maximum working hours for children aged 10–14 were drastically restricted, and women were banned from working over 56 hours per week. The sudden loss of cheap child labourers made the already weakened mining industries of Cornwall and West Devon even less profitable, and more than half <b>the</b> <b>mines</b> in the area went out of business in the following decade. Some bal maidens continued to work in surviving mines and in tin-streaming, but instability in the metal markets made what remained of the mining industries increasingly unviable. In the 1880s William Ewart Gladstone's Liberal government tried to ban female labour from mines altogether; although the Bill was defeated, the number of bal maidens continued to fall. At the 1891 census the number of working bal maidens had fallen to around half its 1850s–60s peak. By 1895 only 23 mines remained operational compared to 307 in 1873, and in 1901 Devon Great Consols, the last significant copper mine in Devon and Cornwall, closed. Electrification and the introduction of Frue Vanners at the surviving mines replaced most of the jobs still done by women, and by the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 very few bal maidens remained in employment. With wartime shortages of raw materials and many younger men in the armed forces, some bal maidens were temporarily rehired to dress potash ore at a re-opened mine at St Austell, and to re-dress the existing spoil heaps of defunct mines for wolfram and arsenic.|$|E
50|$|The larvae feed on {{sycamore}} (Acer pseudoplatanus) <b>mining</b> <b>the</b> leaves. <b>The</b> <b>mine</b> {{starts as}} an inconspicuous lower surface epidermal corridor. This corridor is followed, and mostly replaced, by a relatively small, lower-surface, tentiform mine with many weak folds. If <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> is {{located near the}} leaf margin, the leaf may fold downwards over <b>the</b> <b>mine.</b> <b>The</b> frass is deposited {{in a corner of}} <b>the</b> <b>mine.</b> <b>The</b> pupa is formed in <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> and is dark brownish black. It is made in a loosely spun cocoon.|$|R
50|$|The {{township}} of Eastlake {{was established}} next to <b>the</b> <b>mine.</b> <b>The</b> <b>mining</b> superintendent, Ferdinand Fiedler listed his address at Eastlake as did assistant superintendent, J.E. Tucker. The German-born Fiedler was the furnace operator and postmaster at <b>the</b> New Almaden <b>mine</b> before taking <b>the</b> post of superintendent at Sulphur Bank. <b>The</b> <b>mine’s</b> owner-investors all lived in San Francisco. Eastlake was directly adjacent to <b>the</b> <b>mining</b> property. After <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> closed, Eastlake was abandoned.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>mine</b> has a short tubular {{olive green}} or sand colored plastic body inside {{which is the}} steel {{bounding}} body of <b>the</b> <b>mine.</b> On top of <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> is a round fuze cap with five prongs. <b>The</b> <b>mine</b> is triggered when the fuze cap tilts, either because of pressure {{on one of the}} prongs or a pull on an attached tripwire. The tilting fuze mechanism is not affected by overpressure. When <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> is triggered, a spring-loaded firing pin fires a percussion cap inside the fuze, which ignites a propelling charge at the base of <b>the</b> <b>mine.</b> <b>The</b> propellant charge launches <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> up out of the ground and into the air.|$|R
5|$|Bristol lies {{on one of}} the UK's lesser coalfields, {{and from}} the 17th century collieries opened in Bristol, and what is now North Somerset and South Gloucestershire. Though these {{prompted}} the construction of the Somerset Coal Canal, and the formation of the Bristol Miners' Association, it was difficult to make mining profitable, and <b>the</b> <b>mines</b> closed after nationalisation.|$|E
5|$|During {{and after}} the Black Death the area's {{population}} collapsed. Those miners who had survived the pandemic left mining to work in farming, in which wages had doubled owing to the severe labour shortage, and <b>the</b> <b>mines</b> of Bere Alston were abandoned.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, Allingham {{was in a}} {{reserved}} {{occupation and}} worked {{on a number of}} projects. Perhaps his most significant contribution was the design of an effective counter-measure to the German magnetic mines. During his Christmas lunch in 1939 he was called away to help design a system that would neutralise <b>the</b> <b>mines</b> and open the port of Harwich, Essex. Nine days later, he had successfully completed the task.|$|E
50|$|The larvae feed on Rumex lunaria. They <b>mine</b> <b>the</b> {{leaves of}} their host plant. <b>The</b> <b>mine</b> has <b>the</b> {{form of a}} large, glassy blotch. All frass is ejected out of <b>the</b> <b>mine.</b> <b>The</b> blotch is located next to the leaf margin, which {{slightly}} curls over <b>the</b> <b>mine.</b> Larvae may also bore in young shoots.
