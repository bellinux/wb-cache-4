40|$|Abstract—Automated <b>test</b> {{design is}} an {{approach}} to <b>test</b> design in which automata are utilized for generating <b>test</b> artifacts such as <b>test</b> cases and <b>test</b> data from a formal <b>test</b> basis, most often called <b>test</b> model. A <b>test</b> generator operates on such a <b>test</b> model to meet a certain <b>test</b> coverage goal. In the plethora of the approaches, tools and standards for model-based <b>test</b> design, the <b>test</b> design techniques to be applied and <b>test</b> coverage goals to be met {{are not part of}} the <b>test</b> model, which may easily lead to difficulties regarding comprehensibility and repeatability of the <b>test</b> design process. This paper analyzes current approaches to and languages for automated model-based <b>test</b> design and shows that they are lacking important information about the applied <b>test</b> design techniques.

40|$|FCTESTNET (Fuel Cell <b>Testing</b> and Standardization Network) is {{an ongoing}} European network project within {{framework}} program 5. It is a three-year project that commenced 2003, with 55 partners from European research centers, universities, and industry, working in the fuel cell field. The main objective of FCTESTNET is to promote the harmonization of <b>testing</b> procedures and methodologies within the European Union. The lack of standardized <b>test</b> methods for fuel cell technology is a fact. The development of standardized <b>test</b> methods {{is very important for}} the commercialization of the fuel cell technology. Standardized <b>test</b> methods {{are one of the most}} important instruments in the quality management work of any industrial process. The players that have a common interest to promote and develop harmonized <b>test</b> methods for fuel cell technology are - Standardization bodies (IEC and ISO) - Fuel cell manufacturing industry (type <b>testing</b> and routine <b>testing)</b> - OEMs (acceptance <b>testing)</b> - Research institutes and universities (R&D) The current work presents one of the core results from the FCTESTNET project, namely a proposal of a harmonized <b>testing</b> format for fuel cell techuology. The harmonized <b>testing</b> format has been developed based on a <b>testing</b> model that was proposed in the initial phase of FCTESTNET. The <b>testing</b> model describes the common process steps in <b>testing</b> and has been a valuable tool to communicate <b>testing</b> activities and develop <b>test</b> format within the network. The <b>testing</b> model describes <b>testing</b> in general and fuel cell <b>testing</b> in particular. It is a three-step model. The first step is the planning step and comprises the listing of standardized <b>test</b> methods and other references that are required for the execution of any specific <b>testing</b> activity. The second step of the <b>testing</b> model is the <b>testing</b> execution, which is where the actual <b>testing</b> is carried out. The result of the <b>testing</b> execution is here referred to as <b>test</b> output data or <b>test</b> output. The <b>test</b> output is analysed and compared with input data from the planning step and finally reported in the third step, that is the evaluation step. Some examples of specific <b>test</b> inputs, in the context of fuel cell <b>testing,</b> are temperature, vibration, fuel flow, rain, etc. Examples of specific <b>test</b> outputs are current, voltage, gas emissions, heat, degradation, etc. In professional <b>testing,</b> the internal function of the <b>test</b> object is of secondary importance. The object is to be treated as a "blackbox". It is the <b>test</b> output and the <b>test</b> result that are of primary importance. Based on terminology originating from the <b>testing</b> madel,such as <b>test</b> object, <b>test</b> inputs, <b>test</b> outputs, etc, a harmonized <b>testing</b> format has been developed and proposed. The key terms in the harmonized <b>testing</b> format are <b>test</b> programme and <b>test</b> module. The <b>test</b> programme is defined as a programme comprising two or more <b>test</b> modules. A <b>test</b> module is a <b>test</b> method defined as the variation of one single <b>test</b> input for example the <b>testing</b> of power output as function of ambient temperature. Furthermore, a <b>test</b> module comprises the objectives, the scope, the <b>test</b> input varied, the <b>test</b> outputs <b>tested,</b> <b>test</b> object class (fuel cell, fuel cell stack or fuel cell system), <b>test</b> procedure, <b>test</b> report, etc. JRC.
