500|$|Luke is {{positioned}} on a green cushion, between the heavenly figure {{and the small}} study behind him. He is either rising from a kneeling position or about to genuflect. His eyes fix on her attentively, and he seems near hypnotised. Jesus is similarly transfixed. Hall describes Luke's hands as floating before him, holding the tools [...] "with the same delicacy that an angel might hold a lily or sceptre". Mary has <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> {{so that he can}} depict her in near full profile, a rare honour, while Luke's kneeling position is closely analogous to that of a typical donor portrait {{in the presence of the}} Virgin.|$|E
2500|$|... "On November 7, Bolshevik revolutionaries {{dismissed}} the Kerensky government, and {{the condition of}} the Czar became so pitiful as to make the stoutest heart flinch. The Czar was removed from internment in the Royal Palace and taken from place to place, ultimately to Ekaterinburg. Here he was to have a taste of the tortures he used to inflict on prisoners serving sentences in Siberia...The Bolshevik government reduced his rations and ordinary comforts. His sick child was beaten by ill-mannered guards. The parents had to watch. His daughters were maltreated. Even these tortures did not satiate the revolutionaries. They invented new penalties and new pains. One day, when the Czarina was present under compulsion, the virgin daughters of the Czar were raped by the soldiers. If the Czarina, unable to bear the sight, <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> away, the soldiers would compel her to observe the inhuman scene. Witnessing these brutalities and enduring more pains and poignancies than can have been endured by any mortal, the Czar at last met his end. He was shot dead on July 16, 1918, and with him the entire royal family. The prophecy 'Even the Czar at that moment will be in a pitiful condition' was fulfilled literally." ...|$|E
6000|$|The girl <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> {{promptly}} {{round and}} up, and answered, with a flush in her thin cheek, but no embarrassment in her tone, [...] "No, I thank you. This will do quite well," [...] {{and then she}} <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> away as before.|$|E

60|$|She {{caused him}} more dismay than before by {{suddenly}} murmuring, 'O father, father!' in a heartrending tone, and <b>turning</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> away.|$|R
60|$|Lucy could <b>turn</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> {{far enough}} to see Creech. Like a fiend he was reveling in his work. Suddenly {{he picked up the}} gun.|$|R
60|$|The {{lady said}} nothing, {{and the child}} <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> to me again.|$|E
60|$|With {{that she}} <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> {{against the wall}} and Finnward left her.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Hughs <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> to the scanty fire. Her {{shoulders}} heaved spasmodically.|$|E

60|$|And {{the poor}} young Queen <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> {{in to her}} pillow, and wept.|$|E
60|$|Bumpo {{could not}} speak, but frantically {{produced}} the silken tresses. Genevra <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> aside.|$|E
60|$|She stopped suddenly, and <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> from me {{towards the}} {{entrance}} of the boat-house.|$|E
6000|$|This time Bessie Alden took it with still deeper reserve. She slowly {{got up from}} table, <b>turning</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> away. “You’ll oblige me by {{not talking}} so.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Enough,' said Mrs Clennam, <b>turning</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> {{so that it}} was {{addressed}} for the moment to the old man only. 'Let no more be said about this.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They are not ladies, and I feel {{sure that}} they are swindlers," [...] said Miss Lovel very firmly, <b>turning</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> as she spoke to the attorney.|$|R
60|$|She <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> {{away from}} the others, and her voice fell ever so little.|$|E

6000|$|... "John!" [...] But John was on {{the other}} side of <b>her.</b> Why <b>turn</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> towards the strange old gentleman, as if {{addressing}} him. Was her brain wandering? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Nay; you {{are making}} a jest of it: it is {{exceedingly}} ill-natured! It's no jest to me!' said the young lady, scowling, and <b>turning</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> to the fire.|$|R
60|$|He {{had never}} called {{her by her}} Christian name before. She <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> towards him.|$|E
60|$|Presently she <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> to {{him almost}} suddenly, and smiled with the easiest {{assurance}} of friendship.|$|E
60|$|He {{caught her}} wrist and <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> towards him. Her {{eyes were wide}} open with amazement.|$|E
