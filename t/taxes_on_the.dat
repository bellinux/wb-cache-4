5|$|In {{order to}} {{implement}} these Greek re-conquests, Michael VIII {{was forced to}} levy crushing <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Anatolian peasantry {{in order to pay}} for the expensive army that modeled around the Komnenian army. This led to much peasant support for the Turks whose system resulted in fewer taxes initially.|$|E
5|$|Britain's {{successes in}} the Seven Years' War {{had left it}} with {{expensive}} commitments in the Americas {{that had to be}} paid for and had catalysed the formation of an anti-British coalition in Europe. The British Government's attempt to levy new <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Thirteen Colonies of British America led to the outbreak of the American War of Independence in 1776.

5|$|Going {{into the}} 2010 state elections, the Minnesota {{government}} faced an approximately $5 billion budget shortfall {{in the coming}} 2011–2013 biennium, {{left over from the}} outgoing administration of Republican Governor Tim Pawlenty. The Republican Party claimed that the shortfall was a result of unsustainable increases in spending, and pledged to balance the budget without raising taxes. In the gubernatorial election, former U.S. Senator Mark Dayton campaigned pledging to close the budget deficit by increasing income <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> state's highest earners.|$|E
50|$|In {{practice}} the computation is simplified by using point-slope form or slope-intercept {{form of the}} linear equation for <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> a specific bracket, either as <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bottom amount of the bracket plus <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> marginal amount within <b>the</b> bracket:or <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> entire amount (at the marginal rate), minus the amount that this overstates <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bottom end of the bracket.See Progressive tax#Computation for details.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two common}} ways of {{computing}} a progressive tax, corresponding to point-slope form and slope-intercept {{form of the}} equation for the applicable bracket. These compute the tax either as <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bottom amount of the bracket plus <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> marginal amount within the bracket; or <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> entire amount (at the marginal rate), minus the amount that this overstates <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bottom end of the bracket.|$|R

5|$|In August, Clinton {{signed the}} Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, which passed Congress without a Republican vote. It cut taxes for 15 million low-income families, made tax cuts {{available}} to 90percent of small businesses, and raised <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wealthiest 1.2percent of taxpayers. Additionally, it mandated {{that the budget}} be balanced {{over a number of}} years through the implementation of spending restraints.|$|E
5|$|During the Russian Civil War, and {{immediately}} afterwards, the Commissariat usually confiscated property to support government operations. Following {{a short period}} of stability after the civil war the Commissariat introduced several governmental <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> population. The commissariat's structure differed little from its Tsarist predecessor, the only notable difference was that the Soviet ministry was very centralised while the Tsarist's finance ministry was a very decentralised one. The Commissariat, and later the Ministry, prepared the state budget in a joint process with its republican and local branches. The Ministry's structure went through few changes due to the Soviet government's conservative approaches to change. Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev introduced several reforms during his rule which had the unintended consequence of considerably hurting the ministry's prestige.|$|E
5|$|Following his ousting, Peter the Venetian {{took refuge}} in Germany. In response, Samuel stormed Austria in 1042, {{provoking}} a retaliatory invasion by the German monarch, Henry III in 1043. It forced Samuel to renounce all Hungarian territories {{to the west of}} the rivers Leitha and Morava as well as agree to the payment of a tribute. The funding of the tribute payment was through new <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Christian prelates and seizure of Church estates. This policy caused discontent even among the members of Samuel's own council. He had a number of his councillors executed during Lent. In order to punish the king, Bishop Gerard of Csanád (modern-day Cenad, Romania) refused to perform the annual ceremony of putting the royal crown Gerard upon the monarch's head at Easter.|$|E

40|$|When {{government}} needs more revenue than {{is available from}} a pollution tax rate equal to marginal environmental damage, our intuition tells us to raise <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> clean good above zero and to raise <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> dirty good above that first-best Pigouvian rate. Yet new {{results suggest that the}} second-best pollution tax is below the Pigouvian rate. This note reconciles these views by pointing out that these new results use a labor tax to acquire additional revenue, and that the labor tax is equivalent to a uniform <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> both clean and dirty goods. Thus, depending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> normalization, <b>the</b> total <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> dirty good can be above the Pigouvian rate. These recent results are meant to show that the difference between <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> dirty good and <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> clean good is less than the Pigouvian rate. Any one tax rate can be set to zero as a conceptual matter, but implementation of some taxes might be easier than others as a practical matter. ...|$|R

5|$|Ford ran {{to succeed}} Mark Sanford as Governor of South Carolina in the 2010 gubernatorial election. His {{platform}} included reinstating video poker {{to the state}} to generate returns from <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> gaming industry {{in an effort to}} balance the state budget, something he has proposed since the late 1990s. A law Ford sponsored in 2008 to make gambling legal failed to advance; he planned a voter referendum to repeal the ban. Ford faced state senator Vincent A. Sheheen of Camden and State Superintendent of Education Jim Rex in a primary election. Sheheen's campaign has raised $33,000 as of January 2009, while Ford's campaign raised $6,000. On June 8, 2010, Ford finished in third place in the primary election with 18percent of the vote.|$|E
5|$|In 1956, {{the party}} adopted the Winnipeg Declaration, {{a far more}} {{moderate}} proposal than its previous governing document, the 1933 Regina Manifesto. For example, the Regina Manifesto pledged the CCF to the eradication of capitalism; the Winnipeg Declaration recognized the utility of private ownership of business, and stated {{that the government should}} own business only when it was in the public interest. In its election campaign, the CCF did not promise to nationalize any industries. It promised changes in the tax code in order to increase the redistribution of wealth in Canada. It pledged to increase exemptions from income tax, to allow medical expenses to be considered deductions from income for tax purposes, and to eliminate sales tax on food, clothing, and other necessities of life. It also promised to raise <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> higher income brackets and to eliminate the favourable tax treatment of corporate dividends.|$|E

During the winter a Prussian army {{forced him to}} evacuate Frankfurt, re-cross the Rhine and fall back upon Landau. This occurred during Charles François Dumouriez's treasonous collaboration with the Austrians. Summoned to Paris to account for himself, Custine was accused of treason, but was ably defended by Robespierre, the French revolutionary and lawyer, who declared Custine an honest man who gave his country good service. With Robespierre's defense, he was cleared of all charges, and later given command of the Army of the North.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1720s, Zahir {{and his brother}} Yusuf, backed by the Bani Saqr, {{captured}} Tiberias and its multazim. Concurrently, Zahir issued a letter to Köprülü Abdullah Pasha, governor of Sidon Eyalet, accusing the multazim of oppression and of imposing illegal <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> population. Zahir insisted that if Abdullah Pasha appointed him multazim of Tiberias and Arraba, he would guarantee the timely payment of taxes and rule justly. Abdullah Pasha consented to Zahir's rule and sent him an honorary robe. This {{was the first time}} a Zaydani multazim was directly appointed by the governor of Sidon rather than the semi-autonomous rural chiefs of Mount Lebanon. Zahir made Tiberias his principal base and was joined by his Zaydani kinsmen. He appointed his cousin Muhammad ibn Ali, the multazim of al-Damun, as commander of the family militia.|$|E
5|$|John {{had lost}} most of his ancestral lands in France to King Philip II in 1204 and had {{struggled}} to regain them for many years, raising extensive <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> barons to accumulate money {{to fight a war}} which ended in expensive failure in 1214. Following the defeat of his allies at the Battle of Bouvines, John had to sue for peace and pay compensation. John was already personally unpopular with many of the barons, many of whom owed money to the Crown, and little trust existed between the two sides. A triumph would have strengthened his position, but in the face of his defeat, within a few months after his return from France John found that rebel barons in the north and east of England were organising resistance to his rule.|$|E

5|$|Sharp {{divisions}} among rebel factions {{became apparent}} during a second meeting in Saqba on 5 December. According to Syrian journalist Munir al-Rayyes, hostility between al-Kharrat and al-Shallash was well-known among the rebels. Because al-Shallash had levied war <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> major landlords and city elites of the Ghouta, al-Kharrat's benefactor al-Bakri viewed {{him as a}} threat to the traditional landowning class to which al-Bakri belonged. Al-Rayyis claimed the meeting was called for by al-Kharrat, who ordered his fighters to capture and bring al-Shallash to Saqba. However, according to al-'As, the summit was called by al-Shallash, and once the latter arrived in the village, al-Kharrat personally detained him and confiscated his horse, weapons and money.|$|E
5|$|The ACA {{also helps}} reduce income {{inequality}} measured after taxes, due to higher <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> top 5% of income earners and both subsidies and Medicaid expansion for lower-income persons.

For scale, the subsidy for the employer market, {{in the form of}} exempting from taxation those health insurance premiums paid on behalf of employees by employers, was approximately $1,700 per person in 2016, or $266 billion total in the employer market.

5|$|The Empire of Nicaea, {{founded by}} the Laskarid dynasty, managed to reclaim Constantinople from the Latins in 1261 and defeat Epirus. This led to a {{short-lived}} revival of Byzantine fortunes under Michael VIII Palaiologos, but the war-ravaged Empire was ill-equipped {{to deal with the}} enemies that now surrounded it. To maintain his campaigns against the Latins, Michael pulled troops from Asia Minor and levied crippling <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> peasantry, causing much resentment. Massive construction projects were completed in Constantinople to repair the damage of the Fourth Crusade, but none of these initiatives was of any comfort to the farmers in Asia Minor suffering raids from Muslim ghazis.|$|E

5|$|After his death, {{the court}} ruled that Van Meegeren’s estate be {{auctioned}} and the proceeds from his property and the sale of his counterfeits be used to refund the buyers of his works and to pay income <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sale of his paintings. Van Meegeren filed for bankruptcy in December 1945. On 5 and 6 September 1950, the furniture and other possessions in his Amsterdam house at Keizersgracht 321 were auctioned by order of the court, along with 738 other pieces of furniture and works of art, including numerous paintings by old and new masters from his private collection. The house was auctioned separately on 4 September, estimated to be worth 65,000 guilders. The proceeds of the sale together with the house amounted to 123,000 guilders. Van Meegeren’s unsigned The Last Supper I was bought for 2,300 guilders, while Jesus among the Doctors (which van Meegeren had painted while in detention) sold for 3,000 guilders (about $800 or about $7,000 today.) Today the painting hangs in a Johannesburg church. The sale of the entire estate amounted to 242,000 guilders ($60,000, or about $500,000 today).|$|E

The card was sent all across the United States, as part of Wal-Mart's plan to rejuvenate the baseball card market. On February 24 of the following year, the 122nd anniversary of Wagner's birthday, the grand prize drawing for the card was held on CNN's Larry King Weekend. At around 9:00 P.M., Hall of Fame third baseman Brooks Robinson, one of King's guests on the show, pulled out {{the name of one}} Patricia Gibbs, a postal worker living in Hollywood, Florida. After spending hours unsuccessfully trying to contact Gibbs, King's staff finally got through to her phone, and informed Gibbs of her prize. Treat Entertainment and Wal-Mart gave the card to Gibbs a few weeks later at a Wal-Mart store in Miramar, Florida. Gibbs could not afford the <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> card, so she decided to consign the card to an auction later on. She consigned the card to Christie's, a New York-based auction house better known for selling famous artworks.|$|E
5|$|In November, Silahdar Yusuf Pasha {{left behind}} a strong {{garrison}} and returned to Constantinople for the winter. There however, he fell foul of the Sultan and was executed. Nevertheless, Ottoman preparations continued in order to renew and expand the war, while the Venetians were frantically trying to raise money and men, and attempting to induce other European powers to join them against the Ottomans. However, as most of Europe was locked into the fierce antagonisms of the Thirty Years' War, their pleas fell mostly on deaf ears. The Venetians were hard pressed by the financial demands of the war: besides placing <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Italian mainland possessions (the Terraferma), they resorted to the sale of nobility titles and state offices to fill their war coffer. To lead the effort against the Ottomans, the Senate initially appointed the 80-year-old doge Francesco Erizzo, but {{after his death in}} early 1646, he was replaced by the 73-year old Giovanni Cappello as Captain General of the Sea.|$|E
