40|$|Department of Energy EngineeringTransfer {{printing}} is {{a promising}} fabrication {{process for the}} high-performance electronic devices, novel device structures, and flexible electronics. It enables {{the combination of the}} current low-cost and well-established standard silicon process with high performance of III-V compound semiconductor to overcome the limitations of silicon devices, resulting in low-cost fabrication of high-performance devices. This process can be applied to not only III-V compound semiconductor technology but also low-dimensional materials (i. e. graphene and nanowires). In addition, it guarantees the freedom of choice of materials and substrates. Thus, combination and stacking process of various nanomaterials can be potentially employed by <b>transfer</b> <b>printing</b> for the fabrication of diverse hetero-structured optoelectronic applications. Furthermore, <b>transfer</b> <b>printing</b> of inorganic semiconductor onto flexible substrate enables to achieve high-performance flexible electronic system. As a result, the <b>transfer</b> <b>printing</b> has been actively studied in various research fields. In this thesis, we introduce the various <b>transfer</b> <b>printing</b> methods and their applications in electronic and optoelectronic devices. Firstly, Chapter 1 introduces the historical background and the necessity of the <b>transfer</b> <b>printing,</b> the mechanism of the various <b>transfer</b> <b>printing</b> methods, and its applications. In Chapter 2, we introduce the dry <b>transfer</b> <b>printing</b> method of InAs high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) on silicon substrate for the silicon-based high-performance electronic device. In Chapter 3, we introduce the broadband and high-photoresponsivity photodiode through hetero-integration of III-V compound semiconductors on Si substrates with high-quality interface. In Chapter 4, we show the adhesive layer-assisted <b>transfer</b> <b>printing</b> method and the wrinkling process of the III-V compound semiconductor nanomembranes by using the vacuum-induced stress control of nanomembranes on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microwell arrays. In this method, the size, direction, and location of wrinkle arrays can be easily controlled by changing the shape and location of the microwell arrays and the modulus of soft substrates. Finally, we introduce nanosheet-on-one-dimensional heterojunction photodiode by using wet <b>transfer</b> <b>printing</b> process in Chapter 5. The device shows high rectification ratio, very low dark current, and the high On/Off current ratio at room temperature under the light illumination. The <b>transfer</b> <b>printing</b> methods introduced in this thesis can be potentially employed in the fabrication of various heterostructure of semiconductors for diverse optoelectronic applications. ope...|$|R

30|$|Here, we {{describe}} {{a method to}} use OrmoStamp®;, a commercially available UV-curable, solvent-free, organic/inorganic-hybrid polymer from Micro resist technology GmbH, Berlin, as a viable, cost-efficient material for stamp replication in a nTP process. OrmoStamp®; has initially been developed for UV nanoimprint lithography (UV-NIL) {{as an alternative to}} the use of expensive quartz wafers and is suitable for replication of silicon master templates with structures in the low nanometer range [12]. Once cured, the optical transparent replica has a Young’s modulus of 650 MPa (according to manufacturer’s processing guidelines [micro resist technology GmbH]), and its surface can be modified with the same organic chemistry (PFOTS) as silicon to decrease its surface free energy. We demonstrate a successful approach to use OrmoStamp®; working stamps to reliably <b>transfer</b> <b>print</b> at the same time both micrometer- and nanometer-sized metal structures onto silicon target substrates. Furthermore, we investigate the influence of different process parameters on the achievable transfer yield.|$|E
40|$|The {{essential}} functionality of photonic {{and electronic}} devices {{is contained in}} thin surface layers leaving the substrate often to play primarily a mechanical role. Layer transfer of optimised devices or materials and their heterogeneous integration is thus a very attractive strategy to realise high performance, low-cost circuits {{for a wide variety}} of new applications. Additionally, new device configurations can be achieved that could not otherwise be realised. A range of layer transfer methods have been developed over the years including epitaxial lift-off and wafer bonding with substrate removal. Recently, a new technique called transfer printing has been introduced which allows manipulation of small and thin materials along with devices on a massively parallel scale with micron scale placement accuracies to a wide choice of substrates such as silicon, glass, ceramic, metal and polymer. Thus, the co-integration of electronics with photonic devices made from compound semiconductors, silicon, polymer and new 2 D materials is now achievable in a practical and scalable method. This is leading to exciting possibilities in microassembly. We review some of the recent developments in layer transfer and particularly the use of the <b>transfer</b> <b>print</b> technology for enabling active photonic devices on rigid and flexible foreign substrates...|$|E
40|$|This {{bachelor}} degree work explores the interrelation between print and surface in fashion design and aims {{to investigate the}} expressional possibilities in merging of techniques. With focus on creating an irregular surface through embroidery and fringing, three-dimensional expressions are created, resulting in an illusion of depth and movement within the motifs. The work is textile-driven, hence the main focus has been to find materials, applicational techniques and motifs that {{interact with each other}} without conflicts. Through the use of heat sensitive yarns within the transfer printing process a clear relationship between texture and motif occur where the different aspects affect each other and are equally important for the final visual expression. It is the heat-press used to <b>transfer</b> <b>print</b> from paper to surface that is the most vital step of the process. This work strives to propose a transposed order of applying techniques within a design process. Whilst the act of embellishing existing prints has been investigated by a range of designers, this project propose an order where the print is added post additive surface-manipulation. Therefore this work is {{to be seen as a}} suggestion of new ways of approaching the use of prints within the fashion field. Balancing between fashion design and textile design, the collection is based on generic prints and shapes which are affected by the surface manipulations used...|$|E

Among five approaches of <b>transfer</b> <b>printing</b> summarized in the paper, the viscoelastic property of stamps is widely adopted to modulate the interfacial adhesion between the stamp and devices by applying different pulling speed. A viscoelastic model for <b>transfer</b> <b>printing</b> is established analytically.

40|$|The authors {{compare the}} maximum read range of passive ultra-high-frequency {{radio-frequency}} identification tags {{that have been}} produced using different metal printing techniques, specifically inkjet <b>printing</b> and thermal <b>transfer</b> <b>printing</b> (TTP). They used the same substrate (THERMLfilm), antenna designs and electronic circuitry in their comparison so as to isolate {{the effect of the}} metal printing. Owing to the high metal conductivity, the thermal <b>transfer</b> <b>printed</b> tags printed with copper (Cu) film performed as well or better than the inkjet printed tags printed with silver ink, even when they changed the inkjet printed tags to a Kapton substrate that is better suited to inkjet printing. The aluminium (Al) thermal <b>transfer</b> <b>printed</b> tags had up to 33 % less read range than Cu thermal <b>transfer</b> <b>printed</b> tags. TTP needs no sintering, and provides an attractive alternative low-cost fabrication method. Characterisation of the printed traces by both methods reveals that the printing techniques achieve similar surface roughness. The achieved conductivities for TTP on THERMLfilm were better than for inkjet. The best measured read range for TTP was 10. 6 m. Across the different tag designs, the measured read ranges were 15 - 60 % (1 - 10 %) better for thermal printing, compared with inkjet printing on THERMLfilm (Kapton) ...|$|R

40|$|Most Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) are {{primarily}} created using integrated circuit (IC) fabrication techniques and photolithography. These techniques and procedures are time consuming and exhaustive {{in the amount}} of steps needed in their creation. Also, fabrication processes often limit the materials, chemicals, and temperatures allowed throughout the extensive creation process in order to ensure cross compatibility with all materials in the device. As such, compromises to optimal design are common in many current commercial MEMS products. Current processes and manufacturing techniques are also very expensive. Elastomeric <b>transfer</b> <b>printing</b> offers solutions to these challenges by introducing the ability to assemble individual modularized components of these devices. <b>Transfer</b> <b>printing</b> frees fabricators to simplify and optimize the creation process by breaking down the devices into unique individual parts. <b>Transfer</b> <b>printing</b> also allows for the use of a wider field of materials as well as the ability to use previously incompatible chemicals, temperatures, and other process parameters in pursuit of perfecting each part individually before final assembly. These parts can then be assembled individually or in an assembly line fashion at potentially a significant decrease in manufacturing cost. This thesis examines three examples of <b>transfer</b> <b>printed</b> MEMS that span the areas of microfluidics, mechatronic, and optical/thermal. The microfluidic example is silicon microfluidic nozzles printed onto PDMS microchannels as a means to create simple modularized micro nozzle arrays. This process vastly cuts down on the steps needed to fabricate traditional MEMS Microfluidic nozzles as well as offers a means to potentially exchange damaged nozzles from existing microfluidics arrays. For the mechatronic area, silicon micro gears are <b>transfer</b> <b>printed</b> onto silicon shafts. These gears then demonstrated interdependent actuation. <b>Transfer</b> <b>printing</b> gears allows MEMS designers new flexibility in micro mechatronic design that was previously limited due to photolithography processes. Lastly, for the optical thermal example, microbolometers are created and <b>transfer</b> <b>printed</b> onto a read-out test bed. Bolometers are {{a good example of the}} potential of modularized assembly of 3 D MEMS. These devices are resistance-based sensing devices found at the heart of infrared thermal imaging devices. One critical parameter in a microbolometer membrane is the temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) which is a measure of the bolometer’s sensitivity. Optimally, the TCR should be as negative as possible. Bolometers with a TCR of around - 2 %/°C are common in industry today and are fabricated directly on the readout integrated circuit (ROIC) which limits the thermal processing that can be done to optimize the bolometer membrane due to the risk of damaging the readout integrated circuit (ROIC). A solution to this problem is to fabricate the bolometer membranes separate from the ROIC, then combine them using <b>transfer</b> <b>printing.</b> Separating the processes allows for the use of high temperature annealing to be performed on the bolometer membrane that would have otherwise damaged the ROIC. This annealing allows the vanadium oxide in the membranes to achieve a much lower TCR of up to - 4 %/°C. <b>Transfer</b> <b>printing</b> then provides a unique method for assembling the bolometer membrane on the ROIC. <b>Transfer</b> <b>printing</b> is a means for the optimization of MEMS assembly because it removes previous design constraints on MEMS creation and allows manufacturers to modularly and optimally create and assemble MEMS components into enhanced integrated devices...|$|R
