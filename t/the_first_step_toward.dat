25|$|Salafists such as ISIL {{believe that}} only a {{legitimate}} authority can undertake the leadership of jihad, and that the first priority over other areas of combat, such as fighting non-Muslim countries, is the purification of Islamic society.

The British built a large British Indian Army, with the senior officers all British {{and many of the}} troops from small minority groups such as Gurkhas from Nepal and Sikhs.

Litigation attorneys present {{their side of the}} case to an independent teritary lawyer, who issues an opinion on settlement. Should the parties in question decide to continue to dispute resolution process, there can be some sanctions imposed from the initial arbitration per terms of the contract.|$|E

25|$|Within a generation, Frank Furness's exuberant masterwork was {{considered}} an embarrassment. The University Museum moved to its own building in 1899. In 1915, the Duhring Wing was built {{at the south end}} of the stacks, making their designed expansion impossible. Architect Robert Rodes McGoodwin drew up plans to cloak the entire building in sedate Collegiate Gothic brick and stone. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>toward</b> this was the 1931 addition of a reading room facing College Green (now the Arthur Ross Gallery) that masked the iron-and-glass stacks. Almost perversely, McGoodwin's incongruous Collegiate Gothic addition was dedicated as a memorial to Horace Howard Furness.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} early {{treatment}} facilities for tuberculosis and leprosy was a hospital {{on the island}} of Själö (or Seili in Finnish) which was established on the 1624 and run by the church. It was chosen due to its remote location from the mainland. It was not however until 1759 that the first hospital, albeit a modest hospital, was established in Turku. Consisting of six patient beds in a simple wooden building, it nonetheless marked <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>toward</b> the modern Finnish medical system. It is noteworthy that at the time, Finland had a much lower doctor-patient ratio comparing to neighboring countries. This lasted all the way until the 20th century.|$|E
25|$|The Bogd Khaanate {{was in a}} {{difficult}} position. On the one hand, it lacked the strength to repel a pan-Mongolist attack; on the other, they were profoundly disquieted {{by the thought of}} more Chinese troops in Mongolia. The first detachment of Chinese troops arrived to Urga in July 1919. Prince N.A Kudashev, the old Imperial Russian ambassador to Beijing, indicated a violation of the Kyakhta Agreement by China. This step in conflict with the Kyakhta agreement was considered by the Chinese as <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>toward</b> Chinese sovereignty over Mongolia. In any event, the threatened pan-Mongolian invasion never materialized because of dissension between the Buryats and Inner Mongolians, and Semyonov's dream of a pan-Mongolian state died.|$|E

25|$|Since 2003, the {{politics}} of war have been characterized by partisanship as the Republican and Democratic parties struggled for power in Washington. National efforts to date have been corrupted by partisan politics that have prevented us from devising effective, executable, supportable solutions. At times, these partisan struggles have led to political decisions that endangered {{the lives of our}} sons and daughters on the battlefield. The unmistakable message was that political power had a greater priority than our national security objectives. Overcoming this strategic failure is <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>toward</b> achieving victory in Iraq without bipartisan cooperation we are doomed to fail. There is nothing going on in Washington that would give us hope.|$|E
25|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 18th century the English had established control and imposed the harsh Penal Laws on the Catholic majority of Ireland's population. In Dublin however the Protestant Ascendancy was thriving, and the city expanded rapidly from the 17th century onward. By 1700, the population had surpassed 60,000, making it the second largest city, after London, in the British Empire. Under the Restoration, Ormonde, the then Lord Deputy of Ireland made <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>toward</b> modernising Dublin by ordering that the houses along the river Liffey had to face the river and have high quality frontages. This was in contrast to the earlier period, when Dublin faced away from the river, often using it as a rubbish dump.|$|E
25|$|While white Cuban {{elites and}} their colonial administrators debated {{civil rights and}} public policy, black Cubans had already been showing initiative. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>toward</b> {{property}} rights came when farm owners allowed their slaves to own a pig. A pig could grow, accrue value, be sold for profit or consumed. Many people quickly seized upon the potential of this and began raising as many pigs as possible, even feeding them from their own rations to keep them growing. The pigs would then be sold to either the plantation owner or someone else, and a profit would be made. These profits would sometimes parlay into the ownership of a horse, which implied {{a certain degree of}} freedom and mobility. Worker mobility was also important in spreading information (concerning revolution, property rights, etc.) to other interested communities.|$|E

25|$|The {{plan also}} {{recommends}} that the village expand the historic district, {{at least as}} defined within its zoning code. A draft map at its website shows the southern boundary expanding one lot down {{the west side of}} South Highland, across Maple Street, to include Highland Cottage, an 1872 reinforced concrete house already listed on the Register. At the northern end, the property at 22–24 Croton Avenue next to the municipal building would be included, and the west end would extend to 55 and 57 Central Avenue and 107–113 Main Street. A formal application for that boundary increase was scheduled for review by the state's Historic Preservation Board, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>toward</b> eventual approval by the National Park Service (NPS), in March 2012. At the beginning of 2013, the NPS approved the expansion.|$|E
25|$|Ava {{was not yet}} {{willing to}} go to war with Pegu over Toungoo. Instead, the king sought another way, and enlisted the help of his brother Gov. Saw Yan Naung of Prome. In 1375, Yan Naung {{proposed}} a marriage of state between his daughter and Pyanchi's son, Pyanchi II, with the marriage ceremony to be held in Prome (Pyay). Pyanchi understood the proposal of marriage to be <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>toward</b> joint rebellion against Ava. A Toungoo−Prome axis backed by Pegu would form a formidable Lower Burma bulwark against Central Burma-based Ava. Pyanchi I agreed to the proposal, and went to Prome with a small battalion. It was a trap. The Toungoo contingent was ambushed near Prome, and Pyanchi was killed although his son and son-in-law Sokkate both escaped.|$|E
25|$|With {{the arrival}} in 1961 of {{systematic}} aggression, deportation and attacks started against {{most of the}} Assyrian Christians and their villages {{in the district of}} Duhok. The aggression was committed by the warring parties, especially the Peshmerga associated with the central government against the Kurdish fighters. As a result, many Assyrian villages were destroyed and their people forced to flee. In 1962 Dawodiya was attacked by the Peshmerga and its 82 houses were destroyed. Approximately one thousand families were forced to flee and take refuge in other towns and cities. Several families of kinship used to live in a single house, as it was then the customs of the eastern societies that married brothers would stay along with their families living together. The 1961 war set <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>toward</b> immigration to other parts of Iraq and abroad.|$|E
