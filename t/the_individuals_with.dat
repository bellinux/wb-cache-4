The capability to uncover information about victims of war crimes or homicide may present a conflict in cases that involve competing interests.

5|$|Elephants {{typically}} coexist peacefully {{with other}} herbivores, which will usually {{stay out of}} their way. Some aggressive interactions between elephants and rhinoceros have been recorded. At Aberdare National Park, Kenya, a rhino attacked an elephant calf and was killed by the other elephants in the group. At Hluhluwe–Umfolozi Game Reserve, South Africa, introduced young orphan elephants went on a killing spree that {{claimed the lives of}} 36 rhinos during the 1990s, but ended with the introduction of older males. The size of adult elephants makes them nearly invulnerable to predators, though there are rare reports of adult elephants falling prey to tigers. Calves may be preyed on by lions, spotted hyenas, and wild dogs in Africa and tigers in Asia. The lions of Savuti, Botswana, have adapted to hunting juvenile elephants during the dry season, and a pride of 30 lions has been recorded killing juvenile individuals between the ages of four and eleven years. Elephants appear to distinguish between the growls of larger predators like tigers and smaller ones like leopards (which have not been recorded killing calves); the latter they react less fearfully and more aggressively to. Elephants tend to have high numbers of parasites, particularly nematodes, compared to other herbivores. This is due to lower predation pressures that would otherwise kill off many of <b>the</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> significant parasite loads.|$|E

25|$|In the United States, {{there have}} been three major {{policies}} addressing special education in the United States. These policies were the Education for All Handicapped Children Act in 1975, <b>the</b> <b>Individuals</b> <b>with</b> Disabilities Education Act in 1997, and the No Child Left Behind in 2001. The development of these policies showed increased guidelines for special education and requirements; such as requiring states to fund special education, equality of opportunities, help with transitions after secondary schooling, requiring extra qualifications for special education teachers, and creating a more specific class setting for those with disabilities. <b>The</b> <b>Individuals</b> <b>with</b> Disabilities Education Act, specifically had a large impact on special education as public schools were then required to employ high qualified staff. For one to be a Certified Autism Specialist, one must have a master's degree, two years of career experience working with the autism population, earn 14 continuing education hours in autism every two years, and register with the International Institute of Education. In 1993, Mexico passed an education law that called for the inclusion of those with disabilities. This law was very important for Mexico education, however, {{there have been}} issues in implementing it {{due to a lack of}} resources.|$|E

25|$|Throughout the {{development}} of sedentary societies, disease spread more rapidly than it had during the time in which hunter-gatherer societies existed. Inadequate sanitary practices and the domestication of animals may explain the rise in deaths and sickness following the Neolithic Revolution, as diseases jumped from the animal to the human population. Some examples of infectious diseases spread from animals to humans are influenza, smallpox, and measles. In concordance with a process of natural selection, the humans who first domesticated the big mammals quickly built up immunities to the diseases as within each generation <b>the</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> better immunities had better chances of survival. In their approximately 10,000 years of shared proximity with animals, such as cows, Eurasians and Africans became more resistant to those diseases compared with the indigenous populations encountered outside Eurasia and Africa. For instance, the population of most Caribbean and several Pacific Islands have been completely wiped out by diseases. 90% or more of many populations of the Americas were wiped out by European and African diseases before recorded contact with European explorers or colonists. Some cultures like the Inca Empire did have a large domestic mammal, the llama, but llama milk was not drunk, nor did llamas live in a closed space with humans, so the risk of contagion was limited. According to bioarchaeological research, the effects of agriculture on physical and dental health in Southeast Asian rice farming societies from 4000 to 1500 B.P. was not detrimental {{to the same extent}} as in other world regions.|$|E

2500|$|The Asian tiger {{mosquito}} {{is known for}} transmitting the Wolbachia infection. This bacterial genus {{is the most common}} infection in arthropods today, and over 40% of arthropods have contracted it. Wolbachia can be transmitted from parent to offspring or between breeding individuals. Wolbachia is easily transmitted within the Ae. albopictus mosquito due to the effects it has on fecundity in females. Once female Asian {{tiger mosquito}}s have contracted the infection, they produce more eggs, give birth more frequently, and live longer than uninfected females. In this way, Wolbachia provides a fitness advantage to the infected females and prevents uninfected females from reproducing. This allows control of the spread of diseases that many species carry by suppressing reproduction of <b>the</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> the harmful disease, but without the Wolbachia infection. Wolbachia {{can also be used to}} transfer certain genes into the population to further control the spread of diseases.|$|E

2500|$|Board of Education v. Rowley is {{the most}} {{significant}} court case concerning the interpretation of <b>the</b> <b>Individuals</b> <b>with</b> Disabilities Education Act. It was the only occasion the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled on the requirement of public schools to provide an appropriate education to students with disabilities until Endrew F. v. Douglas County School Dist. RE–1 was decided in 2017. It is estimated that it has been cited by at least 3,279 cases. In a 2008 article published in the Journal of Law and Education, Julie F. Mead and Mark A. Paige described Rowley as [...] "the primary precedent whenever the educational rights of children with disabilities are considered." [...] Likewise, in a 2012 article, Mark C. Weber wrote that Rowley [...] "remains the most important American special education case ever decided." [...] Joyce O. Eckrem and Eliza J. McArthur stated in 2001 that Rowley {{has been described as a}} [...] "seminal case", though they also recognized that the case did not [...] "provide clarity on the issue of appropriateness" [...] and that the Court only [...] "cryptically addressed" [...] the question of how to measure benefits for students. In a 2005 article published in the Suffolk University Law Review, Lester Aron also noted that circuit courts of appeal have issued conflicted rulings when interpreting Rowley.|$|E
2500|$|Similarly, a study {{conducted}} on the relations between members of UNIFIL and local population in Lebanon, carried out by Heiberg and Holst, all but confirmed the findings. In their example, {{they found that the}} countries that were able to integrate more fully with the population and show a depth of knowledge about the local culture were more successful, while those that were ambitious, but less integrated into the local scene found themselves far removed from <b>the</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> which {{they were supposed to be}} engaged with, and their success, or lack thereof, illustrated this.Only the Italian contingent of some 2,200 people operated as part of the local environment and became an active element in restoring normal living conditions. Its soldiers were provided with the training required to acquaint them with the cultural, political and social situation of the people among whom they worked. Operating in a sector that contained approximately 600,000 inhabitants, mostly Shi'ites, the Italians carefully nurtured contact with the ordinary citizens and the political leaders in their area... While the Americans thought they were becoming involved in Lebanese politics, they entered into Lebanese culture and history with little or no understanding of the way things worked-- or didn't work... Most Americans did not understand the subtleties of short-term alliances, the length of memories and blood feuds, the strength of aln [...] in Arab culture nor the nuances of religious differences.This illustrates the importance of understanding the significance that culture plays in the conduct of successful peacekeeping operations. However, despite the existence of a UN training manual that attempts to advise peacekeepers on necessary techniques, there is no unifying doctrine, or standardised procedure among peacekeeping contingents, which will ultimately hinder the potential for success.|$|E
6000|$|All these things, it may {{naturally}} be said, go {{to explain}} the order, not the mode, of the incoming of species.

[...] Not, however, that this is proved even of existing species as a matter of general fact. It is obviously impossible to prove anything of the kind. But we must concede that the known facts strongly suggest such an inference. And--since species are only congeries of individuals, since every individual came into existence in consequence of preexisting individuals of the same sort, so leading up to <b>the</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> which the species began, and since the only material sequence we know of among plants and animals is that from parent to progeny--the presumption becomes exceedingly strong that the connection of the incoming with the preexisting species is a genealogical one.|$|E

60|$|Another view {{seems at}} first sight probable, namely, that an {{incapacity}} to be fertilised in certain ways has been specially acquired by heterostyled plants. We may suppose that our varying species was somewhat sterile (as is often the case) with pollen from its own stamens, whether these were long or short; and that such sterility was transferred to all <b>the</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> pistils and stamens of the same length, so that these became incapable of intercrossing freely; but that such sterility was eliminated {{in the case of}} the individuals which differed in the length of their pistils and stamens. It is, however, incredible that so peculiar a form of mutual infertility should have been specially acquired unless it were highly beneficial to the species; and although it may be beneficial to an individual plant to be sterile with its own pollen, cross-fertilisation being thus ensured, how can it be any advantage to a plant to be sterile with half its brethren, that is, with all the individuals belonging to the same form? Moreover, if the sterility of the unions between plants of the same form had been a special acquirement, we might have expected that the long-styled form fertilised by the long-styled would have been sterile in the same degree as the short-styled fertilised by the short-styled; but this is hardly ever the case. On the contrary, there is sometimes the widest difference in this respect, as between the two illegitimate unions of Pulmonaria angustifolia and of Hottonia palustris.|$|E
6000|$|But is {{this the}} case with smaller changes? There are persons who can see {{distinctly}} only in a dull light, and this condition depends, I believe, on the abnormal sensitiveness of the retina, and {{is known to be}} inherited. Now if a bird, for instance, receive some great advantage from seeing well in the twilight, all <b>the</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> the most sensitive retina would succeed best and be the most likely to survive; and why should not all those which happened to have the eye itself a little larger, or the pupil capable of greater dilatation, be likewise preserved, whether or not these modifications were strictly simultaneous? These individuals would subsequently intercross and blend their respective advantages. By such slight successive changes, the eye of a diurnal bird would be brought into the condition of that of an owl, which has often been advanced as an excellent instance of adaptation. Short- sight, which is often inherited, permits a person to see distinctly a minute object at so near a distance that it would be indistinct to ordinary eyes; and here we have a capacity which might be serviceable under certain conditions, abruptly gained. The Fuegians on board the Beagle could certainly see distant objects more distinctly than our sailors with all their long practice; I do not know whether this depends upon sensitiveness or on the power of adjustment in the focus; but this capacity for distant vision might, it is probable, be slightly augmented by successive modifications of either kind. Amphibious animals which are enabled to see both in the water and in the air, require and possess, as M. Plateau has shown (20/92. On the Vision of Fishes and Amphibia, translated in 'Annals and Mag. of Nat. Hist.' volume 18 1866 page 469.), eyes constructed on the following plan: [...] "the cornea is always flat, or at least much flattened {{in the front of the}} crystalline and over a space equal to the diameter of that lens, whilst the lateral portions may be much curved." [...] The crystalline is very nearly a sphere, and the humours have nearly the same density as water. Now as a terrestrial animal became more and more aquatic in its habits, very slight changes, first in the curvature of the cornea or crystalline, and then in the density of the humours, or conversely, might successively occur, and would be advantageous to the animal whilst under water, without serious detriment to its power of vision in the air. It is of course impossible to conjecture by what steps the fundamental structure of the eye in the Vertebrata was originally acquired, for we know nothing about this organ in the first progenitors of the class. With respect to the lowest animals in the scale, the transitional states through which the eye at first probably passed, can by the aid of analogy be indicated, as I have attempted to show in my 'Origin of Species.' (20/93. Sixth edition 1872 page 144.) ...|$|E
