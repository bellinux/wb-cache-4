5|$|In the 19th and 20th centuries, a {{large part}} of Cabernet Sauvignon's {{reputation}} was built on its ability to age and develop in the bottle. In addition to softening some of their austere <b>tannins,</b> as Cabernet wines age new flavors and aromas can emerge and add to the wines' complexity. Historically this was a trait characterized by Bordeaux with some premium examples in favorable vintages having the potential to last for over a century, but producers across the globe have developed styles that could age and develop for several decades. Even with the ability to age, some Cabernet Sauvignon wines can still be approachable a few years after vintage. In Bordeaux, the <b>tannins</b> of the wines tend to soften after ten years and can typically last for at least another decade-sometimes longer depending on the producer and vintage. Some Spanish and Italian Cabernet Sauvignons will need similar time as Bordeaux to develop but most examples are typically made to be drunk earlier.|$|E

Several feeding experiments on <b>tannin</b> containing shrub legumes using Calliandra calothyrsus as a model plant have been conducted.

40|$|The acetone-extractable (70 % v/v) skin <b>tannin</b> {{content of}} Vitis vinifera L. cv. Cabernet Sauvignon grapes {{was found to}} {{increase}} during late-stage ripening.

5|$|Phenolics, {{sometimes}} called phenols, consist of an aromatic 6-carbon ring bonded to a hydroxy group. Some phenols have antiseptic properties, while others disrupt endocrine activity.

Complex phenolics called polyphenols are capable of producing {{many different types of}} effects on humans, including antioxidant properties. Some examples of phenolics used for defense in plants are: lignin, silymarin and cannabinoids. Condensed <b>tannins,</b> polymers composed of 2 to 50 (or more) flavonoid molecules, inhibit herbivore digestion by binding to consumed plant proteins and making them more difficult for animals to digest, and by interfering with protein absorption and digestive enzymes.|$|E

40|$|Acacia mangium bark is {{abundant}} byproduct of wood industry in Indonesia. It is underutilized and mainly used as fire wood for the wood industry. The bark contains {{high level of}} <b>tannin</b> but the <b>tannin</b> has not been extracted or produced commercially. <b>Tannin</b> isolate {{can be used for}} several purposes such as tanning agent for leather, adhesive for plywood or particle board, etc. In ruminant, <b>tannin</b> can be detrimental but can also be beneficial. This experiment was aimed of getting the highest yield of <b>tannin</b> extract with the highest biological activity in rumen fermentation. Nine different solvents at different temperatures were used to extract <b>tannin</b> from A. mangium bark. The extracts were analyzed for their <b>tannin</b> contents and biological activities. <b>Tannin</b> content was analyzed using folin ciocalteau and butanol-HCl methods. Biological activity was described as a percentage of an increase in gas production in the in vitro rumen-buffer fermentation, with and without addition of PEG. The results show that Na 2 SO 3 solution extracted more <b>tannin</b> than other solutions and the higher the concentration of Na 2 SO 3 solution, the higher the yield of <b>tannin</b> extract. The solution of 6 % sodium sulphite gave the highest yield of <b>tannin</b> extract (31. 2 % of original bark sample) and the highest concentration of <b>tannin</b> (18. 26 %) but produced a negative effect on in vitro fermentation (% increase of gas production = 2. 70 %).

A feeding trial on sheep to study the effect of <b>tannin</b> on microbial protein synthesis and condition of rumen fermentation, digestibility and N retention of feed containing tofu waste was conducted. Fifteen sheep were allocated to one of 3 treatments, i. e: 1) control treatment, feed without <b>tannin,</b> 2) feed + <b>tannin</b> treatment and 3) feed + <b>tannin</b> + polyethylene glycol (PEG) treatment. The sheep was placed in the individual metabolism cage. They were fed with treatment feed for 14 days and then, the following 7 days, faeces and urine were collected.

Rumen parameter (pH, ammonia, SCFA, protozoa) and microbial protein synthesis, digestibility, nitrogen retention were observed. Results showed that inclusion of 4 % <b>tannin</b> in the feed depressed ammonia production in the rumen of sheep before and 3 hours after morning feeding. Total SCFA and individual SCFA were not different among treatments. <b>Tannin</b> did not affect daily feed intake. <b>Tannin</b> lowered the dry matter, organic matter and protein digestibilities but it significantly reduced ADF digestibility (P < 0. 05) and tended to reduce NDF digestibility (P < 0. 1).

40|$|Spent {{coffee grounds}} {{that are left}} behind during the coffee brewing process consist of {{valuable}} <b>tannin</b> compounds which makes them ideal material as a renewable <b>tannin</b> resource. For this reason, the concept of cleaner production had been applied in practice and a <b>tannin</b> extraction process with spent coffee grounds as raw material was investigated in the present study. Among the extraction key factors, namely sodium hydroxide concentration, extraction temperature, liquid to solid ratio, and extraction time, the former three factors had exerted a considerable effect on spent coffee ground <b>tannin</b> extraction yield and its reactivity. However, extraction time had only marginal effects which could be simply neglected in the <b>tannin</b> extraction process. These observations imply that spent coffee grounds can be reused as a renewable <b>tannin</b> resource by properly selecting the extraction parameters {{in order to produce}} the spent coffee ground <b>tannin</b> with desirable extraction yield and reactivity.

5|$|Plant {{material}} {{makes up}} the majority of most lemur diets. Members of at least 109 of all known plant families in Madagascar (55%) are exploited by lemurs. Since lemurs are primarily arboreal, most of these exploited species are woody plants, including trees, shrubs, or lianas. Only the ring-tailed lemur, the bamboo lemurs (genus Hapalemur), and the black-and-white ruffed lemur (Varecia variegata) are known to consume herbs. While Madagascar is rich in fern diversity, these plants are rarely eaten by lemurs. One possible {{reason for this is that}} ferns lack flowers, fruits, and seeds—common food items in lemur diets. They also occur close to the ground, while lemurs spend most of their time in the trees. Lastly, ferns have an unpleasant taste due to the high content of <b>tannins</b> in their fronds. Likewise, mangroves appear to be rarely exploited by lemurs due to their high tannin content. Some lemurs appear to have evolved responses against common plant defenses, however, such as <b>tannins</b> and alkaloids. The golden bamboo lemur (Hapalemur aureus), for instance, eats giant bamboo (Cathariostachys madagascariensis), which contains high levels of cyanide. This lemur can consume twelve times the typically lethal dose for most mammals on a daily basis; the physiological mechanisms that protect it from cyanide poisoning are unknown.

5|$|Cabernet Sauvignon {{is a very}} {{bold and}} {{assertive}} wine that has potential to overwhelm light and delicate dishes.

In most circumstances, matching the weight (alcohol level and body) of the wine to the heaviness of the food is an important consideration. Cabernet Sauvignons with high alcohol levels do not pair well with spicy foods due to hotness levels of the capsaicins present in spices like chili peppers being enhanced by the alcohol with the heat accentuating the bitterness of the <b>tannins.</b> Milder spices, such as black pepper, pair better due to their ability to minimize the perception of tannins—such as in the classic pairings of Cabernet Sauvignon with steak au poivre and pepper-crusted ahi tuna.|$|E
