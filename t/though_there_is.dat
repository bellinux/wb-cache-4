5|$|Each {{hemisphere}} is conventionally {{divided into}} four lobes; the frontal lobe, parietal lobe, temporal lobe, and occipital lobe, named according to the skull bones that overlie them. Each lobe is associated {{with one or two}} specialised functions <b>though</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> some functional overlap between them.|$|E

5|$|As an apex predator, Daspletosaurus {{was at the}} top of {{the food}} chain, {{probably}} preying on large dinosaurs like the ceratopsid Centrosaurus and the hadrosaur Hypacrosaurus. In some areas, Daspletosaurus coexisted with another tyrannosaurid, Gorgosaurus, <b>though</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> some evidence of niche differentiation between the two. While Daspletosaurus fossils are rarer than other tyrannosaurids', the available specimens allow some analysis of the biology of these animals, including social behavior, diet and life history.|$|E

5|$|Curcumin as of 2010 has {{not shown}} benefit in people even <b>though</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> {{tentative}} evidence in animals. There is inconsistent and unconvincing evidence that ginkgo has any {{positive effect on}} cognitive impairment and dementia. As of 2008 there is no concrete evidence that cannabinoids are effective in improving the symptoms of AD or dementia; however, some research looks promising.|$|E
5|$|During the Zheng and Qing eras, Han {{immigrants}} brought Confucianized {{beliefs of}} Taoism and Buddhism to Taiwan's indigenous people. Many Plains Aborigines adopted Han religious practices, <b>though</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> evidence that many aboriginal customs were transformed into local Taiwanese Han beliefs. In {{some parts of}} Taiwan the Siraya spirit of fertility, Ali-zu (A-li-tsu) has become assimilated into the Han pantheon. The use of female spirit mediums (tongji) can also {{be traced to the}} earlier matrilineal Inibs.|$|E
5|$|Gardner Lake State Park {{is located}} off Connecticut Route 354 and {{features}} accessible parking, chemical toilets and a paved boat launch area. This state park designated area is primarily to provide boating and recreational {{access to the}} lake, <b>though</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> also a small beach for visitors to use. As of 2014, the park {{does not have a}} parking fee.|$|E

5|$|Like Compsognathus, {{and unlike}} Sinosauropteryx, {{a patch of}} fossilized skin from the tail and hindlimb of the {{possible}} relative Juravenator starki shows mainly scales, <b>though</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> some indication that simple feathers were also present in the preserved areas. This may mean that a feather covering was not ubiquitous in this group of dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|More {{planets are}} {{possible}} within the stable zone, between f and d at 0.9 to 3.8 AU with eccentricities below 0.4. Given hypothetical planet g {{of up to}} 50 Earth masses, stable mean motion resonance regions lie at 3f:2g, 2g:1d, and 3g:2d. As for the space outside d's orbit, its stability zone begins beyond 10 AU, <b>though</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a stability zone between 8.6 - 9 AU due to a 2:1 resonance.|$|E
5|$|The {{characters}} (and {{their individual}} stories) are grouped into three main sub-plots. Angela and Duran oppose the Dragon Emperor, Hawk and Lise oppose the Dark Prince, and Kevin and Carlie oppose the Masked Mage. The main storyline {{is determined by}} the first character chosen, <b>though</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> significantly more character interaction and dialogue if the other member of the pair is also in the party.|$|E

5|$|The first {{shooting}} medals {{were struck}} {{in honor of}} the Officers' Shoot held in Langenthal, Bern, in 1822. They can usually be distinguished from shooting thalers by their lack of denomination and difference in weight and often composition, <b>though</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> evidence that many of thaler-size did circulate amongst the legal tender coins of Switzerland. Shooting medals were minted in a variety of metals, including silver, bronze, goldene and white metal.|$|E
5|$|The oldest known {{version of}} the poem is the Northumbrian aelda recension. The {{surviving}} witnesses to this text, Cambridge, University Library, Kk. 5. 16 (M) and St. Petersburg, National Library of Russia, lat. Q. v. I. 18 (P), date to at least the mid-8th century. M in particular is traditionally ascribed to Bede's own monastery and lifetime, <b>though</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> little evidence to suggest it was copied much before the mid-8th century.|$|E
5|$|The {{procedures}} used for decompression {{depend on the}} mode of diving, the available equipment, the site and environment and the actual dive profile. Standardized procedures have been developed that provide an acceptable level of risk in appropriate circumstances. Different sets of procedures are used by commercial, military, scientific and recreational divers, <b>though</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> considerable overlap where similar equipment is used, and some concepts are common to all decompression procedures.|$|E

5|$|The {{red-headed}} myzomela {{closely resembles}} the scarlet myzomela, <b>though</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> {{only a small}} overlap in their respective ranges, in eastern Cape York Peninsula. The latter species lives in woodlands rather than mangroves. The dusky myzomela resembles the female red-headed myzomela, but is larger and darker brown, and lacks the red markings around the bill. The Sumba myzomela is similar but slightly smaller than the red-headed myzomela and has darker upper parts and a broad black pectoral band.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} {{recognised}} subspecies, <b>though</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> {{a zone of}} intermediate birds across western Victoria and eastern South Australia, bordered by western Port Phillip Bay to the east, Mount Lofty Ranges to the West and Little and Big Desert parks to the north.
