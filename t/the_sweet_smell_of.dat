500|$|During {{his life}} in retirement, from 1959 up to his death in 1973, Tolkien {{received}} steadily increasing public attention and literary fame. In 1961, his friend C. S. Lewis even nominated him for the Nobel Prize in Literature. The sales of his books were so profitable that he regretted {{that he had not}} chosen early retirement. At first, he wrote enthusiastic answers to readers' enquiries, but he became increasingly unhappy about the sudden popularity of his books with the 1960s counter-culture movement. In a 1972 letter, he deplored having become a cult-figure, but admitted that [...] "even the nose of a very modest idol ... cannot remain entirely untickled by <b>the</b> <b>sweet</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> incense!" ...|$|E

The albums were evenly split between mellow pop and embittered hard rock, with [...] "Success" [...] sporting a morbid before/after cover, and some tracks incorporated a Latin influence from Capaldi's new home, Brazil. However, though [...] "Child in the Storm" [...] reached number 75 in the Netherlands, there was nothing resembling a major hit, not even the folk arrangement of Traffic's [...] "The Low Spark of High-Heeled Boys".|$|E

60|$|She went {{to sleep}} with the soft roar of the falling rain near her window; and the faint puffing in of the breeze brought to her the delicious smell of the rain-washed leaves, the acrid, pungent odor of poplars, <b>the</b> <b>sweet</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> maples, the {{fragrance}} of rich loam--she knew them all.|$|E

6000|$|And after a {{while he}} took notice that there was a door close to him, and a light coming from it, and he {{wondered}} that being so close to him he had not seen it before. And he rose up, and tired as he was he went in at the door, of and although it was night time outside, it was daylight he found within. And presently he met with an old man that had been gathering summer thyme and yellow flag-flowers, and it seemed as if all <b>the</b> <b>sweet</b> <b>smells</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> summer were with them. And the old man said: 'It is a long time you have been coming to us, Hanrahan the learned man and the great songmaker.' ...|$|R

60|$|The sea {{shone like}} silver; the stars seemed to float {{there as well}} as in the sky, and the wind blew off the shore {{bringing}} <b>the</b> <b>sweet</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> hay-fields and gardens.

60|$|Meanwhile my mustang kept {{steadily}} up the slow-rising trail, and {{the time}} passed. Either the grand old forest had completely bewitched me or <b>the</b> <b>sweet</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> pine had intoxicated me, for as I rode along utterly content I entirely forgot about Dick and the trail and where I was heading. Nor did I come to my senses until Hal snorted and stopped before a tangled windfall.|$|E
6000|$|Gabriel's {{nose was}} greeted by an {{atmosphere}} laden with <b>the</b> <b>sweet</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> new malt.

Several exclaimed meditatively, after this operation had been completed:-- ...|$|E
60|$|A warm, dry, {{fragrant}} breeze {{came through}} the window. Dick caught again <b>the</b> <b>sweet</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> flowers or fruit. He heard the fluttering of leaves, the murmur of running water, the twittering of birds, then the sound of approaching footsteps and voices. The door {{at the far end}} of the room was open. Through it he saw poles of peeled wood upholding a porch roof, a bench, rose bushes in bloom, grass, and beyond these bright-green foliage of trees.|$|E
2500|$|The name Pythia {{is derived}} from Pytho, which in myth was the {{original}} name of Delphi. In etymology the Greeks derived this place name from the verb, [...] (...)

60|$|Nearly a {{year had}} past since my father's return, and the seasons had almost {{finished}} their round--It {{was now the}} end of May; the woods were clothed in their freshest verdure, and <b>the</b> <b>sweet</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> the new mown grass was in the fields. I thought that the balmy air and the lovely face of Nature might aid me in inspiring him with mild sensations, and give him gentle feelings of peace and love preparatory to the confidence I determined to win from him.|$|E
60|$|He {{following}} {{afternoon the}} sun shone fair and warm; <b>the</b> <b>sweet</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> the tan-bark pervaded {{the air and the}} birds sang their gladsome songs. The scene before the grim battle-scarred old fort was not without its picturesqueness. The low vine-covered cabins on the hill side looked more like picture houses than like real habitations of men; the mill with its burned-out roof--a reminder of the Indians--and its great wheel, now silent and still, might have been from its lonely and dilapidated appearance a hundred years old.|$|E
60|$|I {{was again}} {{compelled}} to assure {{him that the}} matter {{was not one of}} which I could speak with a stranger, on which he appeared to be huffed, and rode for some miles without opening his mouth. Groves of trees lined the road on either side, and <b>the</b> <b>sweet</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> pines was in our nostrils. Far away the musical pealing of a bell rose and fell on the hot, close summer air. The shelter of the branches was pleasant, for the sun was very strong, blazing down out of a cloudless heaven, and raising a haze from the fields and valleys.|$|E
6000|$|The {{children}} were wild with delight to have [...] "Poppa" [...] back, and {{the meal was}} the merriest they had had for a long time.

The alert chuckle of an occasional robin could be heard.|$|R
60|$|Another hour passed. It {{must have}} been a dark hour for the lion--he looked as if it were--and one of impatience for the baying hounds, but for me it was a full hour. Alone with the hounds and a lion, far from the walks of men, walled in by the wild-colored cliffs, with <b>the</b> dry, <b>sweet</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> cedar and piñon, I asked no more.|$|R
60|$|It {{was rather}} hot, but Jessie did enjoy the lanes, with their flowery banks, and <b>the</b> <b>sweet</b> <b>smells</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hay, {{and she felt}} much brightened and refreshed. When she came near the house, she saw some one sitting in a basket-chair in the porch, and {{knew that it was}} Miss Needwood, a poor, sickly orphan {{relation}} of Mrs. Drew's, who was always trying situations as nursery governess, or reader, or the like, and leaving them because her health would not serve; and then she had no home to go to but Chalk-pit Farm. She was not so much above the Hollises as the farmer's own family, and was always friendly with them. She came to meet Jessie, shook hands with her, and explained that Mrs. Drew had been summoned to speak about some poultry, but would return in a moment if Miss Hollis would sit down.|$|R
60|$|It was a {{wide and}} lofty shed, with piles of cord-wood and slabs at either end, and walled on the farther side with kindling, sawed, split, and piled up with admirable neatness. The place gave out <b>the</b> <b>sweet</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> the woods from {{the bark of}} the logs and from the fresh section of their grain. A double rank of saw-horses {{occupied}} the middle space, and beside each horse lay {{a quarter of a}} cord of wood, at which the men were toiling in sullen silence for the most part, only exchanging a grunt or snarl of dissatisfaction with one another.|$|E
60|$|The {{fact that}} she did not have {{to get up and go}} to the office was Una's chief {{impression}} at awakening, but she was not entirely obtuse to the morning, to the chirp of a robin, the cluck of the hens, the creak of a hay-wagon, and <b>the</b> <b>sweet</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> cattle. When she arose she looked down a slope of fields so far away that they seemed smooth as a lawn. Solitary, majestic trees cast long shadows over a hilly pasture of crisp grass worn to inviting paths by the cropping cattle. Beyond the valley was a range of the Berkshires with every tree distinct.|$|E
60|$|As she spoke, {{the bells}} were just tolling {{the people out}} of church, and I fell a-thinking of my dear dear Mary Smith in the country, walking home to her grandmother's, in her modest grey cloak, as the bells were chiming and the air full of <b>the</b> <b>sweet</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> the hay, and the river shining in the sun, all crimson, purple, gold, and silver. There was my dear Mary a hundred and twenty miles off, in Somersetshire, walking home from church along with Mr. Snorter's family, with which she came and went; and I was {{listening}} to the talk of this great leering vulgar woman.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> rich, <b>sweet</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hay-ricks {{rose to his}} chamber window; {{the hundred}} {{perfumes}} of the little flower-garden beneath scented the air around; the deep-green meadows shone in the morning dew that glistened on every leaf as it trembled in the gentle air; and the birds sang as if every sparkling drop were to them a fountain of inspiration. Mr. Pickwick fell into an enchanting and delicious reverie.|$|R

60|$|If {{the funeral}} had been yesterday, I could not {{recollect}} it better. The very {{air of the}} best parlour, when I went in at the door, the bright condition of the fire, the shining of the wine in the decanters, the patterns of the glasses and plates, <b>the</b> faint <b>sweet</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> cake, <b>the</b> odour of Miss Murdstone's dress, and our black clothes. Mr. Chillip is in the room, and comes to speak to me.|$|R
