25|$|So {{we could}} get down to business. We divided the exhibitors in two, those who were headed by Signac and Luce, the other made up of artists of the new generation. On {{one side of the}} central room the rooms would be given to the older members; on the other, the young {{painters}} organised the rooms that had been given to them. For our part, we took Room 41. In the following rooms, André Lhote, Segonzac, La Fresnaye etc. would take their place. It was at this moment <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> to know each other.|$|E
500|$|Interiors {{were shot}} with three cameras in wide, {{lingering}} master shots in single takes. Welles states that Corman [...] "had two camera crews on the set—that's why the picture, from a cinematic standpoint, {{is really not}} very well done. The two camera crews were pointed in opposite directions so <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> both angles, and then other shots were 'picked up' to use in between, to make it flow. It was a pretty fixed set and it was done {{sort of like a}} sitcom is done today, so it wasn't very difficult." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Paul Lieberstein and Jennifer Celotta, and {{directed}} by Ken Kwapis. [...] "Company Picnic" [...] was the 100th overall episode of The Office, and show creator Greg Daniels said he was especially proud the series made it to that landmark because he felt it meant he did not disappoint Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant, who created the original British version of the show. Daniels said, [...] "I remember interviewing with them seven years ago, and this (100th episode) was certainly the goal, so I'm very pleased <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> to 100 episodes in a strong fashion. I think the show {{is in a very}} good place right now." [...] Steve Carell said he was especially pleased with the landmark because when the show began, people had doubts it would live up to the original series and were skeptical about its mockumentary style: [...] "It's sort of remarkable, especially with this show because I don't think anybody felt it would go past the pilot. ... I think most everyone was kind of dubious about our chances of pulling it off." [...] Likewise, Ben Silverman, co-chairman of NBC Entertainment and an Office executive producer, said, [...] "It's a thrill <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> to 100 episodes, and probably incredibly surprising looking back at the process it took. But the reality is, we believed in it." ...|$|E

We were the better team in all departments and we know that if we get it right then we will be there or thereabouts." [...] Hysén, the man of the match, said of his centre-back partner Hansen: [...] "It is so easy playing alongside Alan. He tells you where to go and what position to take up." [...] He saw similarities with Liverpool and playing for a national team: [...] "The standards are so amazingly high. I just want to win things with them." ...|$|E
500|$|Sanchez {{signed with}} the Philadelphia Eagles on March 29, 2014, for a 1-year, $2.25 million contract. After {{spending}} seven full games as Nick Foles's backup, Sanchez filled-in for an injured Foles, in a Week 9 game against the Houston Texans. Throwing for 202 yards, 2 touchdowns, and 2 interceptions, Sanchez led the Eagles to a 31-21 win. After the game, Eagles head coach, Chip Kelly, praised Sanchez, saying, [...] "He's {{a hell of a}} quarterback and we're excited <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> him." [...] Foles was later confirmed to be out for 6 to 8 weeks with a broken collarbone, meaning Sanchez would take over as the team's quarterback.|$|E
500|$|Castellaneta studied art education, {{with the}} goal of {{becoming}} an art teacher. He became a student teacher and would entertain his students with his impressions. Castellaneta was also a regular participant in The Ron Petke and His Dead Uncle Show, a radio show at NIU. The show helped Castellaneta hone his skills as a voice-over actor. He recalled [...] "We did parodies and sketches, we would double up on, so you learned to switch between voices. I got my feet wet doing voiceover. The show was just barely audible, but we didn't care. It was the fact <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> a chance to do it and write our own material." [...] He took a play-writing class and auditioned for an improvisational show. A classmate first thought Castellaneta would [...] "fall on his face with improvisation" [...] but soon [...] "was churning out material faster than [...] could make it work." ...|$|E

Physically, of course, what I had to do was capture the energy, to capture the physicality of the man, the vocal physicality of the man, this was my task. I was aided enormously by my hair and makeup and special effects people here in terms of getting the overall, and indeed wardrobe helped a lot as well. And then we, the shot up through these beautiful lenses <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> a different feel to the episode than we would now.

500|$|Though McCotter {{had decided}} to run for reelection in his congressional district, he failed to qualify for his district's Republican primary after the {{majority}} of his petitions were declared fraudulent. An investigation of the campaign by the office of the Michigan Attorney General ensued. McCotter argued that [...] "somebody either panicked or it was sabotage... My gut tells me <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> lied to by someone we trusted." [...] Steve Kornacki suggested the fraud may have been related to the presidential campaign, if it [...] "caused him to take his eye off the ball on his House reelection," [...] but McCotter rejected this as an [...] "idiotic line of thinking." [...] He initially hoped to wage a write-in campaign, but decided against it, finding he could not run the campaign while cooperating with the investigation and serving the remainder of his term in Congress. A month later, he resigned from Congress, claiming this was needed to fully assist with the petition fraud investigation. The investigation found that in addition to the 2012 petitions, McCotter's Congressional reelection petitions from 2006, 2008, and 2010, also showed evidence of fraud. McCotter sued two aides accusing them of intentional sabotage. Eventually, four aides, including one who was sued, were charged and convicted of violations related to the fraud.|$|E
500|$|In January 2008, Tao became {{embroiled in}} {{controversy}} after the Singapore Swimming Association (SSA) introduced a 15% levy on the cash awards given to swimmers, with about 6% {{set aside for}} youth development. As part of the government's Multi-Million Dollar Award Programme (MAP), she received S$23,750 for winning three individual titles and one team gold at the 2007 SEA Games. She was therefore [...] "taxed" [...] S$3,562.50, with S$1,425 going to youth development. Unhappy with this, Tao said: [...] "If they [...] want to cultivate youth, they should find their own money, not pay using our awards. It's through our hard work <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> the money. So, I don't see {{the point that we}} should give the money to the youths." [...] She itereited that it [...] been her school and not the SSA which had borne the expense of her overseas training. The SSA said it was [...] "very disappointed" [...] with her comments, and pointed out that the association had spent [...] "easily in excess of $20,000" [...] in sending her for competitions abroad such as the World Championships, Hong Kong Open and Japan International, and a stint at the Australian Institute of Sport. SSA Vice-President Oon Jin Gee told the press, [...] "Even with the Sports School funding it, it's our taxpayers' dollars going into her development. It doesn't matter which avenue it comes from, it's still Singapore's support for her." ...|$|E

500|$|Shortz was {{the first}} guest star the {{producers}} of The Simpsons approached. Long later asked Reagle to make puzzles for the episode. Reagle recorded his lines in a studio near his home. Reagle told the Arizona Daily Wildcat that [...] "for me, {{to be such a}} total nut for animation since I was a kid, I never even dreamed [...] It's like a dream I never had coming true." [...] He added that [...] "you don't see [...] in the episode for very long, but when crossword fans watch this show, we want them to think <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> it right." [...] Reagle designed every puzzle that appears in the episode, including one that appears in a hopscotch court in Lisa's daydream. There were certain lines in the script that had to be incorporated into Reagle's puzzles, including one where Gil says [...] "I think I'll throw some Q's around,", and he enters a number of Q's onto the grid. Reagle therefore had to create a puzzle which used words that included the letter Q more frequently than would be usual. Reagle said he saw the early script of the episode, [...] "but they change it right up to the last minute. In a lot of ways, I'll be seeing {{it for the first time}} right along with everyone else." [...] Scott Thompson has a cameo in the episode as Grady, a character that he first voiced in the season 14 episode [...] "Three Gays of the Condo".|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Brian K. Roberts and {{directed}} by Jim Reardon. Prior to writing the episode, Roberts had been an audio and visual editor on the show. Musician Ringo Starr made a guest appearance in the episode as himself. He was the first Beatle {{to appear on the}} show; both George Harrison and Paul McCartney would later guest star on the show in the season five episode [...] "Homer's Barbershop Quartet" [...] and the season seven episode [...] "Lisa the Vegetarian" [...] respectively. When the story of Marge having a crush on Starr was pitched out, Roberts took the opportunity to write Starr into the script because he had always wanted to meet a Beatle. He then sent the script to Starr, who was then in Southern France. Starr agreed to do the guest appearance after only reading two lines, and he told Roberts that {{he would be able to}} do it when he visited Los Angeles a few weeks later. The staff of the show was thrilled when Roberts revealed that Starr had agreed to do it, and they immediately decided to expand Starr's role in the script. The Simpsons creator Matt Groening said of the guest appearance: [...] "We were so excited <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> Ringo Starr coming in to do the show and we recorded him over at the Complex in West Los Angeles. We were given a list of rules about what we couldn't do to Ringo, such as 'Don't touch him', 'Don't approach him', and 'Don't ask for his autograph'. But of course when he shows up in this big limo, Brian brings out a big poster and asks him to sign it!" [...] Roberts explained that he had not received the memo with the rules so he showed up with a copy of the script cover and asked Starr to sign it. Groening asked Starr if he wanted to be animated the way he was in Yellow Submarine or the way he was in the cartoon series The Beatles. Starr chose Yellow Submarine because he did not like his appearance in the cartoon. In addition to Starr, the episode features a guest appearance by Jon Lovitz as Lombardo and the doughnut delivery man that delivers doughnuts to the nuclear power plant. Lombardo's physical appearance was based on an art teacher Reardon had in art school.|$|E
500|$|Former UCLA {{professor}} of information studies Philip E. Agre and journalist Eric Boehlert argued that three articles in Wired News {{led to the}} creation of the widely spread urban legend that Gore claimed to have [...] "invented the Internet", which followed this interview. In addition, computer professionals and congressional colleagues argued in his defense. Internet pioneers Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn stated that [...] "we don't think, as some people have argued, that Gore intended to claim he 'invented' the Internet. Moreover, there is no question in our minds that while serving as Senator, Gore's initiatives had a significant and beneficial effect on the still-evolving Internet." [...] Cerf would later state: [...] "Al Gore had seen what happened with the National Interstate and Defense Highways Act of 1956, which his father introduced as a military bill. It was very powerful. Housing went up, suburban boom happened, everybody became mobile. Al was attuned to the power of networking much more than any of his elective colleagues. His initiatives led directly to the commercialization of the Internet. So he really does deserve credit." [...] In a speech to the American Political Science Association, former Republican Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Newt Gingrich also stated: [...] "In all fairness, it's something Gore had worked on a long time. Gore is not the Father of the Internet, but in all fairness, Gore is the person who, in the Congress, most systematically worked to make sure <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> to an Internet, and the truth is—and I worked with him starting in 1978 when I got , we were both part of a [...] "futures group"—the fact is, in the Clinton administration, the world we had talked about in the '80s began to actually happen." [...] Finally, Wolf Blitzer (who conducted the original 1999 interview) stated in 2008 that: [...] "I didn't ask him about the Internet. I asked him about the differences he had with Bill Bradley [...] Honestly, at the time, when he said it, it didn't dawn on me that this was going to have the impact that it wound up having, because it was distorted to a certain degree and people said they took what he said, which was a carefully phrased comment about taking the initiative and creating the Internet to—I invented the Internet. And that was the sort of shorthand, the way his enemies projected it and it wound up being a devastating setback to him and it hurt him, as I'm sure he acknowledges to this very day." ...|$|E

It was characterised by heavy tropical storms, usually in the afternoon. While the worst of the monsoon held off until after the battle, rain was nonetheless a prevalent feature of the battle.
