5|$|Météo-France's {{meteorological}} office at Réunion (MFR) issued advisories for storms {{in the basin}} during the year. At the time, the MFR area of warning responsibility was from the coast of Africa to 80°E, and the agency primarily used the Dvorak technique to estimate the intensities of tropical cyclones. The nine tropical storms and five tropical cyclones was identical <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>long-term</b> average from 1981 to 2011.|$|E

5|$|In {{the eastern}} Pacific proper (east of 140°W), sixteen {{tropical}} storms and eight hurricanes formed. Four of the hurricanes became major hurricanes by reaching Category3 or {{higher on the}} Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. These numbers are close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>long-term</b> averages of fifteen tropical storms, nine hurricanes, and four major hurricanes. There were also four unnamed tropical depressions. The only system to enter or form in the central Pacific (between 140°W and the international dateline) was an unusual high-latitude hurricane.|$|E

No major threats <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>long-term</b> {{survival of the}} species are known; the springbok, in fact, {{is one of the}} few antelope species considered to have an expanding population. They are popular game animals, and are valued for their meat and skin. The springbok is the national animal of South Africa.|$|E
5|$|The Bell 212 is {{the primary}} {{helicopter}} used for flights to district villages. The older Sikorsky S-61N machines are stationed in Ilulissat Airport and Qaqortoq Heliport. With a capacity to seat 25 passengers, the S-61 based in southern Greenland was used to shuttle passengers arriving from Copenhagen at Narsarsuaq Airport. The sale of the Boeing 757 in April 2010 contributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>long-term</b> decline of the airport, with the airline planning to remove the old helicopter from the fleet. Three of the Bell 222 helicopters are taken out of active service and remain stationed in Kangerlussuaq Airport having been put up for sale.|$|E
5|$|Australian {{operations}} in Phuoc Tuy province continued throughout {{the remainder of}} 1967, and although they were largely successful at the tactical level, the Viet Cong continued {{to be able to}} enter most of the villages in the province, and were causing increasingly heavy Allied casualties with mines lifted from the controversial barrier minefield laid by the Australians. Operation Santa Fe, a further large-scale joint US-Australian operation, took place between October and November, but it too ended with only limited success in comparison to the resources committed. Meanwhile, despite allegations of corruption and ballot rigging by the ruling military junta, South Vietnam's presidential elections in September had been unhampered by security concerns and were largely considered successful, with 83 percent of eligible voters turning out nationwide; in Phuoc Tuy this number was higher still at over 90 percent. Graham believed that the large public turnout in Phuoc Tuy had been due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>long-term</b> effects of Australian {{operations in}} the province which had increased the population's sense of security. As a result, 1 ATF now turned its attention to expanding its area of operations.|$|E

5|$|Yet such flaws {{were not}} {{immediately}} obvious {{and by the}} second half of 1967 the Viet Cong in Phuoc Tuy Province seemed to have melted away, abandoning many of their bunker systems and avoiding the main roads and towns. The Battle of Long Tan and Operation Bribie had weakened the communist forces in the province, while further operations had restricted their movement and logistics. This prompted Graham to speculate that the Viet Cong may have fled to the border, perhaps leaving the province altogether. He reasoned that a succession of operations in the south-east of the province and the completion of the barrier minefield at Dat Do meant that no single, sizable threat remained to the populated areas of Phuoc Tuy. Meanwhile, despite allegations of corruption and ballot rigging by the ruling military junta, South Vietnam's presidential elections in September had been unhampered by security concerns and were largely considered successful, with 83 percent of eligible voters turning out nationwide; in Phuoc Tuy this number was higher still at over 90 percent. Graham believed that the large public turnout in Phuoc Tuy had been due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>long-term</b> effects of Australian operations in the province which had increased the population's sense of security. During his tour of duty the task force had conducted 32 operations before he handed over command in October 1967. He was later awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO).|$|E

25|$|Chronic use of tranquilizers and {{sleeping}} pills such as benzodiazepines {{has been linked}} to onset of agoraphobia.

25|$|By observing how the Canadian dollar behaves {{against the}} U.S. dollar, foreign {{exchange}} economists can indirectly observe internal behaviours and {{patterns in the}} U.S. economy {{that could not be}} seen by direct observation.

25|$|Combining Hobson's {{activation}} synthesis hypothesis with Solms' findings, the continual-activation {{theory of}} dreaming presented by Jie Zhang proposes that dreaming {{is a result}} of brain activation and synthesis; at the same time, dreaming and REM sleep are controlled by different brain mechanisms. Zhang hypothesizes that the function of sleep is to process, encode, and transfer the data from the temporary memory store <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>long-term</b> memory store. During NREM sleep the conscious-related memory (declarative memory) is processed, and during REM sleep the unconscious related memory (procedural memory) is processed.|$|E
