He however noted that the game was creative in its presentation, and offered [...] "clever new twists on the familiar to the knuckle-biting intensity of the final stages." [...] Justin Haywald of GamePro gave the game 5/5, writing that Nintendo successfully captured the nostalgic aesthetic of the series, while still maintaining technical innovation. He reported, [...] "for every familiar bit of music or a level background <b>that</b> <b>reminds</b> you of Mario games past, you have new abilities to use and deviously designed platforming sections that feel completely unique", while stating that the inclusion of 3D was mostly a gimmick.|$|E

500|$|In a {{contribution}} for The Washington Post, Desson Howe said [...] "there's a wonderful, unhurried delicacy about Persuasion...as if everyone {{concerned with the}} production knows that, if given time and patience, Austen's genius will emerge. Thanks to assured performances, exacting direction and, of course, inspired writing, it does, in subtle, glorious ways". Writing for Entertainment Weekly, critic Ken Tucker graded the film with an [...] "A–", saying it [...] "should enthral even those who haven't read" [...] the novel. Tucker concluded that the film was [...] "the sort of passionate yet precise comedy <b>that</b> <b>reminds</b> me why Austen remains such a vital writer". Susan Ostrov Weisser, a professor of nineteenth-century literature, called the film a [...] "faithful parade of Austen's world", and praised Root as the film's [...] "crown jewel" [...] for playing a [...] "fiercely intelligent, regretful, and frustrated Anne Elliot with subtlety and nuance". In 2008, James Rampton of The Independent rated it the fourth best Austen adaptation of all time.|$|E
500|$|... "Bound 2" [...] {{received}} universal acclaim {{from music}} critics.

[...] David Jeffries of AllMusic described [...] "Bound 2" [...] as a [...] "new wave beauty of a closer." [...] Writing for The A.V. Club, Evan Rytlewski referred to the song as [...] "an overt homage to West's bright early production, reimagining The College Dropouts cheerful chipmunk soul." [...] Dan Buyanovsky of XXL called it the album's [...] "emotional and musical highlight... a perfect sendoff <b>that</b> <b>reminds</b> you of Kanye's roots while pointing you in the direction of his future." [...] A writer for the Kitsap Sun cited [...] "Bound 2" [...] as a [...] "classic Yeezy effort" [...] and [...] "arguably the album's best track." ...|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} mostly positive reviews. [...] Phil Harrison of Time Out called [...] "Freakum Dress" [...] {{a magnificent}} production {{thanks to its}} vocal arrangements and commented that its beat can [...] "drive the boys crazy." [...] Brian Hiatt of Rolling Stone magazine wrote that even though [...] "Freakum Dress" [...] is less harmonically and melodically produced than [...] "Crazy In Love" [...] (2003) and songs from the Destiny's Child era, it remains a good track due to its highly energetic beat. Jaime Gill of Yahoo! Music called the track [...] "discordant" [...] and [...] "menacing" [...] while Jon Pareles of The New York Times called it [...] "overwrought". On a separate review, Jon Pareles said that the song will remain as one of Beyoncé most memorable tracks thanks to its streak of rage which is [...] "perfectly groomed but unmistakable". Bill Lamb of About.com chose [...] "Freakum Dress" [...] {{as one of the}} three best songs on the entire record, and called it a powerful, emotionally intensive and energetic track. Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian called the song a [...] "lighthearted crunk spree" [...] <b>that</b> <b>reminds</b> girls of the significance of having a nice dress in their wardrobe.|$|E

[...] Brittany Frederick of Starpulse.com said that [...] "this is an episode <b>that</b> <b>reminds</b> me why I {{fell in love with}} White Collar."

[...] She also praised the series for utilizing comedy rather than drama. [...] Kenny Herzog of The A.V. Club gave the episode a more mixed review, stating that while the series was [...] "at its caper-hatching best," [...] it was [...] "also its most excessively ludicrous."

There was a surprisingly balanced and incredibly lovely tone." [...] All three writers of The Atlantic review praised the mash-up: Patrick Burns said it was beautiful, and noted that [...] "the arrangement was clever, the ladies sounded great, and the song was placed perfectly into the plot of two characters who were restored a bit of their depth in this episode", Brown stated that the song was lovely, and Kevin Fallon felt that it was [...] "unexpectedly gorgeous and haunting", and noted that it was [...] "yet another example of how skilled the music directors are at these mash-ups." [...] Semigran felt that it was the best performance of the night, and TV Line Michael Slezak gave the piece an [...] "A", and said that it was a [...] "vocally and visually stunning set piece for the unlikeliest of duet partners." [...] Flandez commented that the song [...] "floated like gossamer between Rachel and Quinn as they beautifully poured the sentiments of ugly ducklings", and Futterman wrote, [...] "It's a poignant moment, and the inclusion of West Side Story 'I Feel Pretty' makes for a great pop/theater mash-up <b>that</b> <b>reminds</b> us of what Glee is at its heart." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} by critics who gave a polarised {{view on the}} writing and handling of Shepherd's death. Ashley Bissette Sumerel of TV Fanatic gave the episode the highest praise in a 5 out of 5 star review highlighting the [...] "interesting possibilities" [...] that the death would offer for the show. However, she stated, [...] "I'm beyond heartbroken. [...] We've seen tragic deaths and lost beloved characters, but never quite like this. I don't think I'll ever get over it." [...] She also acknowledged the show's emotional connect with its audience and it's courage to attempt the [...] "inconceivable". Ariana Bacle of Entertainment Weekly {{took the opportunity to}} reminisce {{the early years of the}} show saying that it's the compelling characters that have made committing to Grey's [...] "irresistible". She added that despite some [...] "weak moments" [...] that the series suffers from, characters like [...] "Meredith or Derek or Webber will have a moment <b>that</b> <b>reminds</b> me why I keep watching, why I never stopped— so watching one of those characters die hurts. It really, really hurts." [...] In a mixed review for the episode, a Spoiler TV writer criticized the plot calling it a [...] "self-indulgent episode", contrasted it with [...] "well crafted departure of Mark Sloan, or by Lexie Grey". Also criticizing the absence of the series' major cast from the episode the review said, [...] "The presence of so many inconsequential and uninteresting characters was continually in danger of swamping the dreaminess of Derek." [...] However, appreciative of Pompeo's character, the reviewer remarked, [...] "the writing of Meredith was completely on point. She was clinical, as we would expect her to be." ...|$|E

This is a very {{personal}} thing—since humor's subjective like that—but for me, this was the funniest episode since the clip show... I laughed myself silly at this one, {{to the point where}} I was devolving into hiccups at certain scenes, and I'm glad we get to go out on an episode like this, one that plays around with form and makes me laugh." [...] Alan Sepinwall of HitFix also praised the Glee-spoofing, saying [...] "'Regional Holiday Music' was the logical, clever, funny endpoint to it." [...] Sean Gandert of Paste said, [...] "As with its best theme-episodes, the show bridged the gap between high-concept parody and character-based comedy." [...] TV Fanatic's Leigh Raines gave the episode a 4/5 rating, saying while the show [...] "definitely went out with a bang, it didn't totally blow my socks off... While there were a few moments that upped the ick factor, overall this episode fell on the positive side." [...] She praised Troy and Abed's rap performance, but called the scene where Annie seduces Jeff [...] "creepy". Robert Canning of IGN said it was a [...] "great" [...] episode, but [...] "faltered just a bit" [...] at the end: [...] "Abed's realization that his attempts to brighten the holiday only made things darker, as Jeff had previously suggested, fit the character well enough, but the study group's follow-up felt a bit forced and holiday hokey. Of course, that could well have been the point." ...|$|E
500|$|Richard Corliss of Time {{magazine}} considered McConaughey's portrayal to be a [...] "bold, drastic {{and utterly}} persuasive inhabiting of a doomed fighter", remarking that [...] "if the camera occasionally suffers a fashionable {{case of the}} jitters, the movie transcends its agitated verismo to impart dramatic and behavioral truth". Chris Bumbray reviewed the film for JoBlo.com and gave it 9 out of 10, and said, [...] "Like Woodroof, the film never wants your pity, and while tears {{will no doubt be}} shed while watching it, they're well-earned." [...] The Philadelphia Inquirers Steven Rea talked about McConaughey's role, [...] "Just about everything is right with Dallas Buyers Club, beginning with Matthew McConaughey's literally transformative portrayal. McConaughey's performance isn't just about the weight loss. It's about gaining compassion, even wisdom, and it's awesome." [...] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle said, [...] "Dallas Buyers Club" [...] takes audiences back to the worst of the AIDS crisis, where the disease was a death sentence, and the public's terror and hostility were at its height." [...] Film critic Richard Roeper reviewed the film for his own website, and talked about McConaughey: [...] "Once we get past McConaughey's stunning transformation, we're transfixed by a performance <b>that</b> <b>reminds</b> us of why this guy became a movie star in the first place." [...] Ann Hornaday gave the film 4 out of 4 ratings, and then gave her remarks on McConaughey's remarkable performance for The Washington Post, [...] "McConaughey delivers the performance of his career, characterized not just by an astonishing physical transformation but by a wellspring of deep compassion and fearlessness." ...|$|E
500|$|Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times {{gave it a}} {{grade of}} [...] "B+", praising Jackman's {{performance}} as [...] "strong, solid entertainment" [...] and [...] "a serious, sometimes dark and deliberately paced story." [...] Christy Lemire, writing for the website of Roger Ebert, said that the film [...] "features some breathtakingly suspenseful action sequences, exquisite production and costume design and colorful characters, some of whom register more powerfully than others." [...] Variety film critic Peter Debruge called the film [...] "an entertaining and surprisingly existential digression from his usual X-Men exploits. Though Wolvie comes across a bit world-weary and battle-worn by now, Jackman is in top form, taking the opportunity to test the character’s physical and emotional extremes. Fans might’ve preferred bigger action or more effects, but Mangold does them one better, recovering {{the soul of a}} character whose near-immortality made him tiresome." [...] James Buchanan of TV Guide.com gave it 3 out of 4 stars, calling it [...] "A rare comic-to-film adaptation that doesn't sacrifice substance for the sake of thrilling action." [...] Scott Collura of IGN praised the film giving it an 8.5 out of 10 and stated, [...] "The Wolverine is a stand alone adventure for the classic character <b>that</b> <b>reminds</b> us that there's more to this genre than universe-building and crossovers. ... story paints a deep and compelling portrait of Logan, a haunted character that Jackman still finds new ways to play all these years later." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone felt that despite the film's final act [...] "sink into CGI shit", Jackman's performance [...] "still has the juice" [...] and Mangold's directing [...] "shows style and snap." ...|$|E
