500|$|The episode {{features}} a guest appearance by actor William Daniels as KITT, a character from the Knight Rider television series of which Homer is a fan. KITT is an artificially intelligent electronic computer module installed in an automobile. In the episode, {{after failing to}} cheer Homer up with a film reel of his life, the family shows him a video featuring KITT. The automobile, seen driving in the desert, tells Homer the following: [...] "Hello Homer. It's me, KITT, from TV's Knight Rider. Your family has asked me <b>to</b> <b>invite</b> <b>you</b> to a very special ..."; the film reel breaks just before KITT finishes his sentence. This of course leads to Homer becoming even more depressed. [...] Daniels' appearance in [...] "The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace" [...] {{was the first and}} only time that he voiced KITT outside of Knight Rider and the film Knight Rider 2000. He recalls that [...] "when I told my son in New York that I {{was going to be on}} The Simpsons, I think that was the first time that he was really impressed with what I was doing! The Simpsons is a great show and I'm glad they thought of KITT in one of their jokes." ...|$|E

Speaking about the title and concept of the album, Gaga explained: [...] "The Fame is about how anyone can feel famous. [...] Pop culture is art. It doesn't make you cool to hate pop culture, so I embraced it and you hear it all over The Fame. But, it's a sharable fame. I want <b>to</b> <b>invite</b> <b>you</b> all to the party. I want people to feel a part of this lifestyle." [...] Gaga stated in an interview with MTV UK that she had been working on the album {{for two and a half}} years and completed half of it during the first week of January 2008. As well as writing the lyrics, Gaga worked on the melodies and synth work of the album, with record producer RedOne. According to Gaga, the first track [...] "Just Dance" [...] is a joyous, heart-themed song, which appeals to people going through tough times in their life. [...] "LoveGame", the second track, was inspired by Gaga's sexual crush on a stranger in a night club to whom she said, [...] "I wanna ride on your disco stick". It was written in four minutes based on the disco stick hook. [...] "Paparazzi" [...] has been interpreted with different meanings. However Gaga explained in an interview with About.com, that the song was inspired by her struggles and hunger for fame and love. Essentially a love song, [...] "Paparazzi" [...] dealt with enticing the media and asked the question, whether one can have both fame and love.|$|E

2500|$|Lucius sent Fronto few {{messages}} at {{the beginning}} of the war. He sent Fronto a letter apologizing for his silence. He would not detail plans that could change within a day, he wrote. Moreover, there was little thus far to show for his work: [...] "not even yet has anything been accomplished such as to make me wish <b>to</b> <b>invite</b> <b>you</b> to share in the joy". Lucius did not want Fronto to suffer the anxieties that had kept him up day and night. One reason for Lucius' reticence may have been the collapse of Parthian negotiations after the Roman conquest of Armenia. Lucius' presentation of terms was seen as cowardice. The Parthians were not in the mood for peace.|$|E

But Balaam replied: [...] "Though Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not do anything, big or little, contrary to the command of the Lord my God." [...] Nonetheless, Balaam invited the dignitaries to stay overnight to let Balaam find out what else God might say to him, and that night God told Balaam: [...] "If these men have come <b>to</b> <b>invite</b> <b>you,</b> you may go with them." ...|$|E
2500|$|On August 30, {{the band}} {{announced}} that the lead single Paradise (What About Us?) would be released as an EP, which is also set to feature 3 tracks from the upcoming album in their demo form, being them [...] "Let Us Burn", [...] "Silver Moonlight" [...] and [...] "Dog Days". Upon making this announcement, den Adel said: [...] "By releasing these demos we want <b>to</b> <b>invite</b> <b>you</b> in our home studio and show how we capture song ideas {{at an early stage}} of creating a new album. These demo versions are far from their final sound on the album, but will give you a hint of what we’re working on. It will be fascinating to hear how the end result will sound like, once the album is released.". After announcing that the lead single would contain a guest musician, on September 13 the band officially announced that Tarja Turunen was set to appear as a special vocalist on the title song. The EP was released on September 27. On 25 and 26 October, den Adel and Westerholt presented an unknown number of songs of the upcoming album to the press. The second promotional single, Dangerous, was released on December 20 and features ex-Killswitch Engage singer Howard Jones. Hydra was finally released on January 31, 2014, in mainland Europe and in February 4 on North America and United Kingdom, and was met with critical and commercial success. In the Netherlands, Hydra marked the band's return to the first position on the charts since the release of The Heart of Everything in 2007, also reaching the first spot on the Czech Republic album charts, making it their first number-one album outside the Netherlands. The band had their first album on a top 10 position in the UK Albums Chart, debuting at six and the first top 20 position on the US Billboard 200, debuting at the number 16.|$|E

How might this complexity be represented? I have explored {{the metaphor of the}} curriculum as a ‘vortex’.   A vortex has a spinning motion, with a turbulent, vertical flow. Vortices can move, stretch, twist, and interact in complex ways and carry momentum and energy. I report on how this metaphor has been discussed, shaped, experienced and applied. I draw on responses from final year Primary Education students as they seek new perspectives on curriculum making. For my students, their experiences of curriculum can be at the limits of their comfort zone. In practice, they are cast into situations where they experience the turbulent flow of deep learning. I share how collaboration has shaped thinking <b>to</b> date and <b>invite</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> continue to develop the metaphor...|$|R
