5|$|Spiderland is {{the second}} and final studio album by the American rock band Slint. It was {{released}} on March 27, 1991, through <b>Touch</b> <b>and</b> <b>Go</b> Records. Featuring dramatically alternating dynamics and vocals ranging from spoken word to shouting, the album contains narrative lyrics that emphasize alienation. Spiderland was Slint's first release on <b>Touch</b> <b>and</b> <b>Go,</b> and the group's only album to feature Todd Brashear.|$|E
5|$|Butthole Surfers did {{not seek}} to replace her at the time, and opted to {{continue}} as a quartet. Following a final EP for Touch and Go—1989's Widowermaker—the band left their longtime recording partners to sign with longtime supporter Terry Tolkin at Rough Trade Records who had also brought them to <b>Touch</b> <b>and</b> <b>Go,</b> for a reportedly generous one-album deal. Prior to the new LP's debut, Rough Trade talked the band into first releasing 1990s The Hurdy Gurdy Man, which previewed material from the coming release. The same year, Rough Trade issued Digital Dump by The Jackofficers, Haynes and Pinkus's psychedelic house music side project.|$|E
5|$|With {{some members}} working as dishwashers, {{the group was}} {{apparently}} not thrilled with the album being released on Ward 9. Terry Tolkin, a friend and their East Coast booking agent, signed the band to Corey Rusk's then-nascent <b>Touch</b> <b>and</b> <b>Go</b> Records in Detroit. Psychic... Powerless... Another Man's Sac was released in 1984. Building on their first EP, the band made psychedelia a much bigger part of their sound on this release, which made full use of the tape editing, non-traditional instrumentation, and sound modulation that came to define their studio recordings.|$|E

60|$|We {{had here}} a very {{difficult}} passage, though we took two pilots on board at Achen, who pretended to know the straits perfectly well; twice we were in very great danger of being lost, and once our Madagascar ship was so entangled among rocks and currents, that we gave her up for lost, and twice she struck upon the rocks, but she did but <b>touch,</b> <b>and</b> <b>went</b> clear.|$|R
5|$|At {{the same}} time as the Fleet Air Arm was {{receiving}} its first aircraft, the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment had three FG.1s delivered to its 'C' Squadron for flight deck trials aboard Eagle. Two sets of trials were successfully carried out in March and June 1969; the first comprised approaches and <b>touch</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> landings, while the second set of trials involved full catapult launch and arrested recovery. As a result of the reheat from the Spey turbofans, the ship's jet blast deflectors (JBD) were not used; instead a steel plate was fixed to the deck to absorb the heat of the engines building to launch, and fire hoses were used after each launch to prevent them melting.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, {{the band}} contributed {{a cover of}} the Underdog theme song to be {{included}} on the tribute album , produced by Ralph Sall for MCA. Later that year, Haynes's side project, P, issued an eponymous LP on Capitol, while Coffey's Trance Syndicate label released the first Butthole Surfers compilation album. Titled The Hole Truth... and Nothing Butt, it was mostly live tracks recorded at different venues from 1985 to 1991. In December, Butthole Surfers initiated what would become an extended legal battle with <b>Touch</b> <b>and</b> <b>Go.</b> At first they were seeking to increase their profits from the albums released by the label, because the label chose a strategy of non-promotion. The case quickly became a fight for all ownership rights that dragged {{on for more than}} three years.|$|E

25|$|Butthole Surfers weren't under {{contract}} to any record label when they recorded this album. Upon its completion they offered it to Alternative Tentacles, who had released the band's first two EPs but {{could not afford to}} distribute the new project. This, combined with questions the group had regarding Alternative Tentacles' handling of royalties from Butthole Surfers and Live PCPPEP, resulted in the album ultimately being released on <b>Touch</b> <b>and</b> <b>Go.</b>|$|E

50|$|On May 2006, it was {{announced}} that Brannon and Moore would play a Negative Approach reunion show of sorts, for <b>Touch</b> <b>and</b> <b>Go's</b> 25th anniversary show on September 9, 2006, as well as two later shows in the UK (London on December 7 and at All Tomorrow's Parties on December 10). Despite repeated efforts by Rob and Graham McCulloch {{to be a part of}} the reunion and have the classic NA lineup play, Brannon refused. It was instead announced that Harold Richardson (of Brannon's current band Easy Action) and Ron Sakowski (formerly of Easy Action, Laughing Hyenas and Necros) would complete the lineup.|$|R

25|$|To {{secure a}} running organization, Maersk bought Falck Air on 21 February 1969. There was {{internal}} disagreement about the airline's future strategy amongst its owner, the Falck Group. They therefore sold it as a discounted rate to Maersk. At the time Falck Air operated {{a fleet of}} two de Havilland Herons and two Hawker Siddeley HS 748 aircraft and a hangar at Copenhagen Airport, Kastrup. The airline had ordered three Fokker F27 Friendships, the first which was delivered on 9 December. The second was delivered on 17 December, but was written off ten days later when it crashed after failing to become airborne after a <b>touch</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> at Rønne Airport.|$|E
25|$|First out was Nafees Iqbal, caught {{behind for}} 15 with the score on 50. Iqbal was unlucky, as the video replays {{suggested}} the ball had bounced {{before going into}} Geraint Jones's gloves, but despite returning to the pitch {{to appeal to the}} umpires, Iqbal had to go. Opener Javed Omar, captain Habibul Bashar and Aftab Ahmed all made half-centuries as it was <b>touch</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> as to whether England would wrap it up in the two days. When the seventh wicket fell at 245 in the last over of normal play, it allowed England to claim the extra half-hour. But only one more wicket fell as Bangladesh restored some pride. England wrapped up the game within 20 minutes on the third day, but Bangladesh, albeit against an attacking field had made 316, 27 short of making the hosts bat again.|$|E
25|$|In November 1994 {{their next}} album, Sad & Dangerous, was issued on the Poon Village label and {{included}} tracks from the trio's earlier cassette. The album, along with subsequent tours with Sonic Youth, John Cale, and Pavement, {{led to a}} record deal with Chicago's <b>Touch</b> <b>and</b> <b>Go</b> Records. In March 1995 the group started a United States tour with a gig in San Francisco. In May they performed at the Music West Festival in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Subsequently, that year they toured the US four times, then toured Europe with gigs in Greece, Germany and the United Kingdom. They toured Israel with Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, then back in London in August they performed with Cave – {{who was also a}} participant on the Palace project – providing a live soundtrack for the Carl Dreyer silent film The Passion of Joan of Arc, at the National Film Theatre.|$|E

500|$|Hayward was {{promoted}} to captain again on 19 February 1949. On 7 March, he took off Coral Sea in the Atlantic in a P2V carrying a dummy Little Boy pumpkin bomb, and flew across the United States to make a simulated attack on the Salton Sea test site near El Centro, California. He then flew to Patuxent River, where he landed after a total of 23 hours flying. [...] Hayward had tailhooks fitted {{to a pair of}} P2Vs, and made practice landings on a carrier deck painted on the ground at NAS Patuxent River, Maryland, He made some <b>touch</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> passes at the , but a carrier landing was considered too dangerous for regular crews to attempt.|$|E
500|$|At 17:20 McCay signalled Bridges {{that large}} numbers of {{unwounded}} men were leaving the battlefield and heading for the beaches.

At dusk Maclagan made his way to Bridges headquarters and when asked for his opinion replied [...] "It's <b>touch</b> <b>and</b> <b>go.</b> If the Turks come on in mass formation... I don't think anything can stop them." [...] As it got dark the Turkish artillery ceased firing, and although small arms fire continued on both sides, the effects were limited when firing blind. Darkness also provided the opportunity to start digging more substantial trenches and to resupply the troops with water and ammunition.|$|E
500|$|About {{seven years}} later, series {{producer}} Takashi Tezuka decided enough {{time had passed}} to make another direct sequel, Yoshi's New Island (2013, Nintendo 3DS). It was developed by former Artoon employees at their new company, Arzest. As in the original, Yoshi carries Baby Mario and throws eggs. The game adds the ability to swallow big foes, which become big eggs that can destroy big obstacles. Yoshi's Island DS developer Arzest assisted in its development. In 1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die (2010), Christian Donlan wrote that despite the [...] "streamlined" [...] Yoshi's Story and [...] "brilliant" [...] Yoshi's <b>Touch</b> <b>and</b> <b>Go,</b> [...] "the original was never bettered and never truly advanced upon". In Eurogamer 2015 preview of Yoshi's Woolly World, Tom Phillips wrote that it had [...] "been 20 years since the last truly great Yoshi's Island.

Ninja saves Sensei by defeating the Ranx. Then, a creature comes to attack Ninja which he deals with easily. The creature then spits out a Rage Stone which Ninja <b>touches</b> <b>and</b> <b>goes</b> into a fit of rage and accidentally kills Sensei. Sensei comes back as a ghost and tells Ninja {{that there are more}} Rage Stones and with their power, he can defeat O-Dor. Sensei then sends Ninja to find the second Rage Stone in Robot Beach.
