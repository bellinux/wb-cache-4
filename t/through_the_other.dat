5|$|A {{recurring}} {{horror story}} on many websites and popular media outlets is that Japanese soldiers during World War II inflicted bamboo torture upon prisoners of war. The victim was supposedly tied securely in place above a young bamboo shoot. Over several days, the sharp, fast growing shoot would first puncture, then completely penetrate the victim's body, eventually emerging <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> side. Possibility {{of this method}} was tested on an episode of MythBusters, and confirmed.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Baxter, {{the leading}} case on {{derivative}} governmental immunity in Australia was the 1979 High Court judgment in Bradken Consolidated Ltd v Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd. In Bradken, the High Court upheld {{a claim for}} derivative governmental immunity by equipment suppliers to the Queensland Commissioner for Railways. The majority's conclusion was that if the Queensland government was immune from the TPA, it would prejudice the Queensland government if the contracts and arrangements it entered were subject to the TPA <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> parties to the contracts and arrangements.|$|E
5|$|The {{first step}} is to mark two {{arbitrary}} points of the plane (which will eventually become vertices of the triangle), and use the compass to draw a circle centered at one of the marked points, <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> marked point. Next, one draws a second circle, of the same radius, centered at the other marked point and passing through the first marked point.|$|E

5|$|Chell and GLaDOS {{return to}} the modern {{chambers}} and face Wheatley, who is driven by GLaDOS's software to test them against a series of traps, which Chell escapes. In their final confrontation, Chell attaches three corrupted personality cores (Nolan North) to Wheatley, allowing a second core transfer to restore GLaDOS to control. However, Wheatley blows up the button needed to activate the transfer. With the facility exploding around them due to the impending meltdown of its reactor core, the roof collapses revealing the night sky, whereupon Chell places a portal on the moon overhead. The vacuum of space pulls her and Wheatley <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> portal still inside the chamber, and GLaDOS reasserts her control. GLaDOS retrieves Chell, who falls unconscious, and Wheatley is left in space with a corrupt personality core orbiting him.|$|E

25|$|For example, {{starting}} {{with just two}} distinct points, we can create a line or either of two circles (in turn, using each point as centre and passing <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> point).

25|$|It was {{originally}} intended that 21 acts (seven for each judge) should remain by {{the conclusion of}} the bootcamp stage.

25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{important}} display is the behavior of breaking branches, which {{all members of the}} group carry out. Even infants break small branches (or twigs), letting them fall to the soil, but the most spectacular is the alpha male who chooses large, dry branches which he hits with his hands and feet in spectacular jumps, so that they fall. Usually such branches make a tremendous sound as they fall <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> branches, {{and the members of the}} group become very excited and chatter loudly. This behavior is quite commonly discharged towards an observer when the animals have lost their fear.|$|E
25|$|The {{inscription}} {{is interpreted}} and deciphered {{with the help}} of many intellectuals and scholars, but the Orientalist Sir Henry Rawlinson is credited as being most critical in the process of deciphering the piece. Part of why the understanding of the text is so vivid today is owed to Darius the Great himself, for he wrote the message of the inscription in three language, and so allowed the modern scholars to decipher one language and follow <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> two, since the message was essentially similar in all three forms. In this sense, the Behistun inscription is not only a significant architectural work, but also a significant linguistic tool, as important to the old world understanding of ancient Persia and its languages, as Rosetta Stone is to understanding ancient Egypt and its languages.|$|E

25|$|A general conic {{is defined}} by five points: given five points in general position, there is a unique conic passing through them. If three of these points lie on a line, then the conic is reducible, and {{may or may not}} be unique. If no four points are collinear, then five points define a unique conic (degenerate if three points are collinear, but the other two points {{determine}} the unique other line). If four points are collinear, however, then there is not a unique conic passing through them â€“ one line passing through the four points, and the remaining line passes <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> point, but the angle is undefined, leaving 1 parameter free. If all five points are collinear, then the remaining line is free, which leaves 2 parameters free.|$|E

When the Orange Star Army's intention was to just pass <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> two countries, Green Earth and Yellow Comet, the countries' COs like Kanbei of Yellow Comet assume a threat of an invasion and declare battles against the Orange Star Army in their land.|$|E
25|$|Two {{disjoint}} closed curves {{that both}} {{lie on the}} same plane are unlinked, and more generally a pair of disjoint closed curves {{is said to be}} unlinked when there is a continuous deformation of space that moves them both onto the same plane, without without either curve passing <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> or through itself. If there is no such continuous motion, the two curves are said to be linked. For example, the Hopf link is formed by two circles that each pass through the disk spanned by the other. It forms the simplest example of a pair of linked curves, but it is possible for curves to be linked in other more complicated ways. If two curves are not linked, then it is possible to find a topological disk in space, having the first curve as its boundary and disjoint from the second curve. Conversely if such a disk exists then the curves are necessarily unlinked.|$|E

25|$|An {{unintended}} {{consequence of the}} attack on Melo was that Paraguay declared war on Brazil in late 1864. The Paraguayans invaded the provinces of Mato Grosso (present-day Mato Grosso do Sul) and Rio Grande do Sul. JosÃ© LuÃ­s served in the Siege of Uruguaiana which resulted, in September 1865, in the surrender of an entire Paraguayan army which had taken the Brazilian town of Uruguaiana. On 22 March 1866, JosÃ© LuÃ­s was given command of the 2nd cavalry division, a part of the 1st army corps. He fought in the Battle of Estero Bellaco on 2 May and in the First Battle of TuyutÃ­ on 24 May. At TuyutÃ­ JosÃ© LuÃ­s was shot in the face with the bullet's trajectory entering one cheek and exiting <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> He was left with hideous scars that made him look like he had a grim smile in his face. Tall and lean, JosÃ© LuÃ­s seemed unpleasant at first glance, an impression that the disfigurement only worsened. He was actually a kind and warm person, according to historian Gustavo Barroso, who as commander knew how to impose a strict discipline without hurting the pride of his subordinates.|$|E
25|$|Most of the {{original}} mural work that covered the walls and ceilings are deteriorated or lost, but reconstructed murals {{have been added to}} parts, especially in the spaces between the nerves of the vaults. These murals contain soft colors which form lines, geometrical shapes and floral shapes reminiscent of ironwork. These probably date to the last third of the 19th century but this is mostly conjecture. The side walls contain faded remnants of narrative scenes, which have not been dated either. One of the best conserved elements inside the church is the 16th century pulpit, made of sandstone sculpted with fine Gothic style designs. In each of the faces of the design, anagrams of the name of Christ or the coat of arms of the Augustinians appear. There is none like it from all of the Mexican colonial period. The original confession booths are built into the wall on the right hand side of the nave, separating the church and the cloister, with the priest entering one side and the confessor entering <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> They were covered up for much of the churchâ€™s history until 1954, when Father Jose Maria Mendez moved the altars on this wall to reveal them. Between them and the baptistery area, there is a large door that leads to the cloister of the former monastery. In colonial times, this door was only opened for Mass on major festivals.|$|E
