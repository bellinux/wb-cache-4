[...] The first chapter of the book {{suggests}} the real-life events surrounding the film have been incorporated into Forrest's storyline, and that Forrest {{got a lot of}} media attention {{as a result of the}} film. During the course of the sequel novel, Gump runs into Tom Hanks and at the end of the novel in the film's release, including Gump going on The David Letterman Show and attending the Academy Awards.|$|E

500|$|It {{has been}} speculated that Windsor based Peggy on Violet Kray, mother of the infamous East End gangsters, the Kray twins; however Windsor has denied this. Instead, she claims that Peggy is based on women she has seen in East End pubs and her own mother: [...] "women whose hair is great and their outfits are more Walthamstow market, <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> wrong slightly...Some things I've done with Peggy is from my Mum. She {{was one of those}} East End snobs. I drew on all of those experiences." [...] In a 2009 radio {{interview}} with Dale Winton, Windsor said three people have influenced her portrayal of Peggy: Violet Kray (thus retracting her earlier statement), her own mother, and the actor Mike Reid, who played her on-screen husband Frank Butcher.|$|E
500|$|With Lana's boyfriend gone by season two, {{the door}} opened for Clark, but Welling stated he {{understood}} why the producers continued to keep Clark and Lana apart, even after Whitney's departure: [...] "There's the cliché that television shows with a main love interest fail once <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> together." [...] After briefly being together {{at the beginning of}} the fifth season, Clark's upbringing was not enough to help him cope with the loss of Lana to Lex toward the end of season five. Welling admits that Clark had learned to let Lana make her own choices and not stand in her way, but his problem with her relationship with Lex was that Lex is a dangerous individual and it put Lana's safety in jeopardy. Apart from that, Clark had learned to walk the lonely road of a hero. His inability to cope with Lana moving on with Lex was carried over to season six. This season was the time the writers put Clark through an emotional wringer when they had Lana accept Lex's marriage proposal. For writer Kelly Souders, this presented Clark's worst fear: the woman he loved was marrying his worst enemy.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{response}} to [...] "Stronger" [...] was generally positive. Andy Strickland of Yahoo! Music {{described it as}} having [...] "splashes of pure Massive Attack". Stuart McCaighy of This Is Fake DIY wrote that it [...] "sounds ace", while Birmingham Post writer Andrew Cowen described the track as [...] "defiant". Dean Piper from Daily Mirror considered it the Sugababes' best release and applauded the group's vocals on the song. Hot Press writer Phil Udell characterised [...] "Stronger" [...] as [...] "an elegant ballad way beyond their tender years". Akin Ojumu of The Guardian was complimentary about the track's R elements, writing: [...] "When <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> right on tracks such as 'Stronger' and 'Supernatural' the Sugababes are cool". Fiona Shepherd of The Scotsman praised the song's composition, calling it [...] "tastefully restrained". However, Barry Nicholson from NME named it the weaker track on the double A-side and stated that it [...] "leers at you for a bit, then staggers off to puke up that last Bacardi Breezer". [...] Marianne Gunn from The Herald called the track's strings [...] "inferior" [...] and wrote that it contains [...] "the same cheesy sentiment" [...] as American singer Britney Spears' song of the same name.|$|E

500|$|... "To do {{this any}} other way would have been needlessly contentious," [...] Daley {{explained}} {{at a news conference}} Monday morning. Daley argued that the airport was a threat to Chicago's high-rise cityscape and its high-profile skyscrapers, such as the Sears Tower and the John Hancock Center. Daley criticized the Federal Aviation Administration, saying [...] "Now, think of that; Mickey and Minnie have it. I mean, I can't believe that. <b>They</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> first before we get it?", referring to the post-9/11 air space restrictions in place over Orlando, Florida. [...] "The signature act of Richard Daley's 22 years in office was the midnight bulldozing of Meigs Field," [...] according to Chicago Tribune columnist Eric Zorn. [...] "He ruined Meigs because he wanted to, because he could," [...] Chicago Tribune columnist John Kass wrote of Daley. [...] "The issue is Daley's increasingly authoritarian style that brooks no disagreements, legal challenges, negotiations, compromise or any of that messy give-and-take normally associated with democratic government," [...] the Chicago Tribune editorialized. The Federal Aviation Administration cited the City for failure to comply with federal law requiring thirty-day advance notice to the FAA of plans for an airport closure. The city was fined $33,000, the maximum allowable. The city paid the fine and repaid $1 million in misspent federal airport development grants. Daley defended his actions by claiming that the airport was abandoned, {{in spite of the fact}} that the Chicago Fire Department had several helicopters based on the field at the time, in addition to the dozens of private aircraft left stranded.|$|E
500|$|Susan and Karl were {{childhood}} sweethearts {{who married}} in 1978, before they both graduated from university. Karl has cheated on Susan twice with Sarah Beaumont (Nicola Charles) and Izzy Hoyland (Natalie Bassingthwaighte) {{and the couple}} have broken up and divorced, but have later reunited and remarried. Woodburne has named the Karl, Susan and Izzy love triangle {{as one of her}} favourite storylines. Woodburne believes that Karl and Susan have a strong connection that is [...] "based upon such a good grounding". Karl and Susan are best friends who enjoy each other's company, share a deep connection and take joy in each other's quirks and ways. Woodburne described them as having a [...] "really solid foundation for a marriage" [...] and she has said that she does not want to see Susan and Karl's relationship break up again. Holy Soap have called Susan and Karl [...] "contenders for the friskiest couple on Ramsay Street". Following their [...] "passionate arguments", the couple enjoy making up together. They have a healthy attraction for each other. Fletcher says he and Woodburne find the scenes [...] "funny". Fletcher said [...] "Karl and Susan every now and again do go through a phase where they become slightly more amorous than in their tougher times and tougher storylines – suffice to say it's not bawdy, but I think the audience will enjoy the fun aspect". Karl and Susan have been caught in the nude together on three occasions; at the beach, in Lou Carpenter's (Tom Oliver) spa and when they went skinny-dipping in the bush. When asked what makes Karl and Susan popular with viewers, Woodburne said [...] "Because I think they're so flawed. There's two things: they make horrendous mistakes, both of them, but they both are coming from a place of well meaning. They're both wanting to try and {{do the right thing and}} be helpful, but so often <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> so terribly wrong, and I think we can all relate to that." ...|$|E

2500|$|Yang {{states that}} people's democracy, unlike {{parliamentary}} democracy, realises {{the principle of}} [...] "popular sovereignty". The basis for {{the argument is that}} in a parliamentary democracy, a system in which ordinary people can vote for different parties, the parties available are in the pockets of the bourgeoisie. Parties can only win, Yang claims, if they have enough money—when parties have money, <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> from the bourgeoisie. This relationship turns the political parties contesting the election to subservient tools of the bourgeoisie, and makes them govern in their interest. While a system with multi-party elections, rotational government and parliaments looks more democratic, it is in fact beholden to the interests of the bourgeoisie, and not the people. In contrast, the people's democratic system with People's Congresses realises popular sovereignty through a mixture electoral and consultative democracy. Unlike in parliamentary democracies Yang adds, people standing for elections for seats in people's congresses are financed state, thus giving every candidate an equal chance of getting elected. Yang claims that;All political parties [...] bear the trust of the people, all implement their duties according to the law and under the leadership of the Communist Party, and serve the people.|$|E

2500|$|In 2000, O'Donnell {{partnered with}} the {{publishers}} of McCall's {{to revamp the}} magazine as Rosie's McCall's (or, more commonly, Rosie). The magazine was launched as a competitor to fellow talk show hostess Oprah Winfrey's monthly magazine O. Rosie covered issues including breast cancer, foster care and other matters of concern to O'Donnell. In the September 2000 issue, she shared that [...] "she has struggled with depression her entire life" [...] and decided to start medications when she realized her fears were affecting her family. With a strong start and a circulation close to 3.5 million, things looked promising but the magazine stumbled as conflicts emerged between O'Donnell and the editors. The contract gave O'Donnell control over editorial process and editorial staff but veto power remained with publisher Gruner+Jahr USA. O'Donnell quit the magazine in September 2002, following a dispute over editorial control. [...] "If I'm {{going to have my}} name and my brand on the corner of a magazine, it has to be my vision" [...] she told People. Rosie magazine folded in 2003. In late 2003, O'Donnell and the publishers each sued the other for breach of contract. The publishers claimed that, by removing herself from the magazine's publication, she was in breach of contract. The trial received considerable press coverage. O'Donnell would often give brief press interviews outside of the courtroom responding to various allegations. Of note was a former magazine colleague and breast cancer survivor who testified that O'Donnell said to her on the phone that people who lie [...] "get sick and they get cancer. If they keep lying, <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> again". O'Donnell apologized the next day and stated [...] "I'm sorry I hurt her the way I did, that was not my intention." [...] The judge dismissed the case, ruling that neither side should receive damages.|$|E
2500|$|On {{announcement}} of the storyline, Soaplife said it [...] "could be fun but could be the ruin of Kat if <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> wrong", and wondered if it would put EastEnders [...] "back on top of its game", saying, [...] "That depends on Kat. If we're made to love and care about her, yes. If she comes over as a conniving, sneaky cheat only interested in her own wants and desires, no." [...] They opined that Alfie {{should be the one}} having the affair, as he cannot do anything right in Kat's eyes. They also said they [...] "wondered which Kat we'd be getting back after Jessie Wallace's break. Would it be the tart with a heart that made Kat a soap icon? Or the alley Kat that we got last year (Kat down the alley with delivery man Mark was not her finest moment). Now with the reveal that she'll have a mystery that we can all spend weeks or months trying to guess , we fear it will be more alley Kat." [...] All About Soap thought that because of the way Kat got rid of Roxy after she moved in with Alfie while Kat was away, [...] "you'd think that [...] Kat was really committed to her husband [...] and determined to make her marriage work" [...] but called the affair [...] "sizzling", saying it would [...] "send shockwaves all round Albert Square!" [...] Soaplife said that the storyline {{may turn out to be}} a good mystery, but [...] "when it comes to affairs, we prefer ours with a heap-big dose of love". However, they later said the storyline was [...] "getting boring". In All About Soap, letters page editor Laura thought the affair would be [...] "the hottest thing in the Square this summer!" [...] Soaplife awarded the storyline a bronze medal in their [...] "2012 Soap Olympics" [...] for [...] "best storyline cycling", as Kat is [...] "cheating again. Round and round she goes." [...] Kate White from Inside Soap said: [...] "Well, Kathleen Slater Moon, if you were hoping to win our sympathy by suggesting that this secret fling business is all Alfie's fault, think again! Yes, it's a bit annoying when your other half is too busy to pay you much attention—but there should at least be an effort to sort out your issues before you decide cheating is the answer! We're finding it hard to have sympathy". The magazine later called the storyline [...] "unusual" [...] but said that [...] "Kat has been busy showing us how infidelity should be done". When the affair turned from lust to love, Soaplife said that it was [...] "what the affair needed right from the start in order to save Kat's reputation." [...] Steven Murphy, editor of Inside Soap said that when the storyline started, he and his colleagues were [...] "a little intrigued" [...] but after Michael was eliminated, they were [...] "totally obsessed!" [...] An Inside Soap reporter said that [...] " [...] decision to keep the man's identity a secret—and to have several characters reacting as if it could be them—means that this is soap like we've never seen it before", and added that [...] "it makes for frustrating viewing at times, but there's no denying that this plot has us well and truly hooked.
