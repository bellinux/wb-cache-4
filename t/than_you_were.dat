2500|$|In {{his closing}} remarks, Reagan asked viewers: [...] "Are you better off now <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> four years ago? Is {{it easier for}} you to go and buy things in the stores than it was four years ago? Is there more or less {{unemployment}} in the country than there was four years ago? Is America as respected throughout the world as it was? Do you feel that our security is as safe, that we're as strong as we were four years ago? And if you answer all of those questions 'yes', why then, I think your choice is very obvious as to whom you will vote for. If you don't agree, if you don't think that this course that we've been on {{for the last four years}} is what you would like to see us follow for the next four, then I could suggest another choice that you have." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{philosophy}} of parkour {{has been compared}} to that of martial arts. In an interview with The New Yorker, David Belle acknowledges the influence: [...] "There's a quote by Bruce Lee that's my motto: 'There are no limits. There are plateaus, but you must not stay there, you must go beyond them. A man must constantly exceed his level.' If you're not better <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> the day before, then what are you doing—what's the point?". In an interview with the press, Belle explained that parkour is a training method for warriors. [...] "So many people try to train easy 'Come do parkour! It's really cool!' But if tomorrow I made you do real training, you would end up crying. That's what you need to know: you are going to cry, you are going to bleed {{and you are going to}} sweat like never before." [...] In his book, Belle also quotes his father Raymond: [...] "If two roads open up before you, always take the most difficult one. Because you know you can travel the easy one." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hackett criticized Schmidt as a [...] "rubber stamp" [...] for Governor Bob Taft's [...] "failed policies", {{and claimed}} she would {{continue}} {{in that role}} for George W. Bush if elected. At their debate at Chatfield College, Hackett said [...] "If you think America {{is on the right}} track and we need more of the same, I'm not your candidate" [...] and asked [...] "Are you better off today <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> five years ago?", echoing Ronald Reagan's question in his debate with Jimmy Carter in 1980. [...] "Rubber stamp" [...] was Hackett's catchphrase throughout the campaign. Hackett even appeared in front of the Hathaway Rubber Stamp store in downtown Cincinnati on July 27 to emphasize the point. [...] "If you think America needs another career politician steeped in a culture of corruption who does as she's told and toes the line on failed policies, then I'm not your candidate," [...] he wrote in a guest column for The Cincinnati Post. However, Schmidt said that she was proud to be associated with Bush, sending campaign mail with a photograph of them together in the Oval Office.|$|E

60|$|And {{why should}} it not <b>be</b> so? Do <b>you</b> fancy God less of a father <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>are?</b> Is He not The Father, the perfect Father, 'from whom every {{fatherhood}} in heaven and earth is named?' Oh, believe that He is indeed a Father; believe that all the love and care which you can show to your children is as much poorer than the love and care God shows to you, as your obedience to your earthly parents is poorer and weaker than the love and obedience of Jesus Christ to His Father. God is as much better a Father <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>are,</b> as Jesus Christ is a better Son <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>are.</b> There is a sum of proportions; a rule-of-three sum; work it out for yourselves, and then distrust God's love if you dare.|$|R
