5|$|Bina Agarwal and Pradeep Panda {{illustrate}} that a woman's property status (such as owning {{a house or}} land) directly and significantly reduces her chances of experiencing domestic violence, while employment makes little difference. They argue that such immovable property increases women's self-esteem, economic security, and strengthens their fall-back positions, enhancing their options and bargaining clout. They show that property ownership is an important contributor to women's economic well-being because it reduces their susceptibility <b>to</b> <b>violence.</b>|$|E

40|$|Objectives: The study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the relationship between bullying and victimization in school and exposure <b>to</b> interparental <b>violence</b> in a nonclinical sample of Italian youngsters. Methods: A cross-sectional {{study was conducted with}} a sample of 1059 Italian elementary and middle school students. Participants completed a self-report anonymous questionnaire measuring bullying and victimization and exposure <b>to</b> interparental <b>violence.</b> The questionnaire also included measures on parental child abuse and socio-demographic variables. Results: Almost half of all boys and girls reported different types of bullying and victimization in the previous 3 months, with boys more involved than girls in bullying others. Exposure <b>to</b> interparental physical <b>violence</b> and direct bullying were significantly associated especially for girls: girls exposed <b>to</b> father’s <b>violence</b> against the mother and those exposed <b>to</b> mother’s <b>violence</b> against the father were among the most likely to bully directly others compared with girls who had not been exposed <b>to</b> any interparental <b>violence.</b> Hierarchical multiple regression analyses revealed that bullying and victimization were predicted by exposure <b>to</b> interparental <b>violence,</b> especially mother-to-father violence, over and above age, gender, and child abuse by the father. Conclusions: Exposure <b>to</b> interparental <b>violence</b> is associated with bullying and victimization in school, even after controlling for direct child abuse. Violence within the family has detrimental effects on the child’s behavior; schools, in this regard, can play a fundamental role in early detection of maladjustment...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. Soc. Sc.

Method: Participants consisted of 45 male and 64 female students from the University of Limpopo, whose ages ranged from 15 to 20 years. Adolescents were classified into one of the two domestic violence exposure groups (namely, those from violent homes and nonviolent homes) on the basis of respondents' ratings of their exposure <b>to</b> domestic <b>violence</b> both as witnesses of violence between their parents and direct victims. Their levels of exposure were then compared with identity development. Results: The results indicated that {{the difference between the two}} groups of exposure <b>to</b> domestic <b>violence</b> reached a statistical significance on identity development. However, the gender differences in identity development of adolescents exposed <b>to</b> domestic <b>violence</b> and those not exposed did not reach any statistical significance. Again, on the interaction between gender and exposure <b>to</b> domestic <b>violence</b> on identity development, the results revealed no significant or acceptable level of interaction. Master...|$|R
5|$|Some lessons {{identified}} in the series include diversity, acceptance, political tolerance, and equality. Surveys of over 1,000 college students in the United States show that those who read the books were significantly different {{than those who had}} not. Readers of the series were found to be more tolerant, more opposed <b>to</b> <b>violence</b> and torture, less authoritarian, and less cynical. Although it is not known if this is a cause-and-effect relationship, there is a clear correlation, and it seems that Harry Potter's cultural impact may be stronger than just a fandom bond.|$|E
