5000|$|The National Guard of the United States is {{the largest}} of the {{organized}} federal reserve military forces in the United States. The National Guard of the United States is classified (under title 10, United States Code (see above)) as the organized federal reserve military force. Under federal control, the National Guard of the United States can be called up for active duty by the President of the United States. Since the 2003 Invasion of Iraq, many National Guard units have served overseas - under the Total Force Policy of 1973 which effectively combined the National Guard with the armed forces, making them regular troops. This can lead to problems for states that also face internal emergencies while the Guard is deployed overseas. To address such issues, many of the states, such as New York and Maryland also have organized state [...] "militia" [...] forces or state guards which are {{under the control of the}} governor of a state; however, many of these [...] "militia" [...] also act as a reserve for the National Guard and are thus a part of it (this varies from state to state depending on individual state statutory laws). New York and Ohio also have active naval militias, and a few other states have on-call or proposed ones. In 1990, the United States Supreme Court ruled in the case of Perpich v. Department of Defense that the federal government has plenary power over the National Guard, greatly reducing (to the point of nonexistence) the state government's ability <b>to</b> <b>withhold</b> <b>consent</b> to federal deployments and training missions of the National Guard.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Video-recorded {{consultations}} {{are widely}} used for research in general practice. Recently, video recordings have begun {{to be used for}} the purposes of general practitioner (GP) registrar assessment. It is unknown, however, whether consultations in which patients withhold consent for recording differ from those that are recorded. AIM: To compare clinical problems and demographic characteristics of adult patients who consent to the video recording of consultations with those who withhold consent. METHOD: This was prospective study of 538 adult patients consulting 42 GPs, based in practices throughout Leicestershire. Each patient attended a surgery session with one of the 42 GPs between April 1995 and March 1996. Clinical presentations and demographic characteristics of patients consenting and withholding consent to the video recording of their consultations were compared. GPs' perceptions of whether patients in these two groups were distressed/upset or embarrassed were also compared. RESULTS: A total of 85. 9 % (462 / 538) of adults consented to video recording, and 14. 1 % (76 / 538) withheld consent. Multiple logistic regression revealed that patients who presented with a mental health problem were more likely <b>to</b> <b>withhold</b> <b>consent</b> to recording (odds ratio 2. 5, 95 % confidence interval 1. 4 - 4. 6). Younger patients were also more likely <b>to</b> <b>withhold</b> <b>consent</b> to video recording. Additionally, where patients' consent was withheld, GPs perceived patients to be more distressed or embarrassed. CONCLUSION: Younger patients and those suffering from mental health problems are more likely than others <b>to</b> <b>withhold</b> <b>consent</b> to being video recorded for research purposes in general practice. The implications of this study for the assessment of registrar GPs using video-recorded consultations are discussed...|$|E

40|$|One way of {{increasing}} the supply of organs available for transplant would be to switch to an opt-out system of donor registration. This is typically assumed to operate {{on the basis of}} presumed consent, but this faces the objection that not all of those who fail to opt out would actually consent to the use of their cadaveric organs. This paper defuses this objection, arguing that people's actual, explicit or implicit, consent to use their organs is not needed. It borrows David Estlund's notion of ‘normative consent’ from the justification of political authority and applies it to the case of organ donation. According to this idea, when it is wrong <b>to</b> <b>withhold</b> <b>consent</b> to something, the moral force of that lack of consent may be null and void. If it is wrong of a person to refuse to donate their cadaveric organs to others, then it may be that their actual consent is not needed. This supports an opt-out system, which provides protection for those who have genuine reasons to refuse donation, and spares the worries as to what the deceased would actually have wanted...|$|E
40|$|An {{increasingly}} {{large number}} of babies are born to unwed parents in the United States every year. This phenomenon is problematical for putative fathers in adoption proceedings because {{it is difficult to}} protect such a father’s rights while advancing the child’s best interests. Many states, such as Missouri, have responded by enacting putative father registries. An unwed father may file his intent to claim paternity with the Missouri Putative Father Registry in a postcard to insure notice of any proceeding that may affect his parental rights. However, a Missouri putative father who has not filed with the registry and taken affirmative steps to establish his paternity legally waives his right to consent to adoption in Missouri. As such, a juvenile officer’s petitioning to terminate his parental rights prior to the filing of an adoption petition is unnecessary and serves only to prolong the process. Because a putative father who has not timely availed himself of the registry and affirmatively asserted his paternity has no legal rights or obligations concerning his child, this Note argues that the juvenile officer need only to petition for a declaration that the father has no right to grant or <b>to</b> <b>withhold</b> <b>consent</b> to an adoption proceeding at a particular point in time. Such a policy better fulfills the legislative goals of a putative father registry and is {{in the best interests of}} the children. Expediting the adoption process in this fashion has implications not only for Missouri putative fathers, but also unwed fathers in all states that have enacted putative father registries...|$|E
