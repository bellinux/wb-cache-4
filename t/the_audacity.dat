5|$|Wright's sermon left a great {{impression}} on Obama, who recounted Wright's sermon {{in detail in}} his memoir Dreams from My Father. Soon after Dreams From My Father was published he went into politics, entering the Illinois Senate. In 2004 he was chosen to deliver the keynote address at the 2004 Democratic National Convention. In Obama's 2006 memoir <b>The</b> <b>Audacity</b> of Hope, he recollects that on being chosen to deliver this speech, he pondered the topics on which he had previously campaigned, and on major issues then affecting the nation, before thinking about the variety of people he had met while campaigning, all endeavouring in different ways to improve {{their own lives and}} to serve their country.|$|E
5|$|In April 1948 he {{once again}} {{travelled}} with England to Hampden Park, helping his country to a 2–0 victory; however after the match {{he was the}} subject of an FA inquiry after he claimed tea and scones on his expenses (at the cost of sixpence). Regardless of this treatment by the FA, the next month he helped England record a 4–0 victory over Italy in Turin. Folklore told that he beat Alberto Eliani only to have <b>the</b> <b>audacity</b> to then pull a comb from his shorts pocket and comb his hair; the reality was that he simply used his hand to wipe his sweating brow in the beating Italian sun. However the legend would follow him around the world in later life, and spectators in the crowd were convinced that they had witnessed it. Later in the year he played in a goalless draw with Denmark, a 6–2 win over Northern Ireland, a 1–0 win over Wales, and a 6–0 triumph over Switzerland.|$|E
5|$|Shaw {{appeared}} in regional theatres in Bristol, Liverpool and Hull. In 1925, he performed in London as the Archangel in The Sign of the Sun, and played first Lewis Dodd {{and then the}} Major in separate productions of The Constant Nymph. He received instruction in verse speaking under famed theatre director William Bridges-Adams in the Stratford Festival Company at Stratford-upon-Avon, where he played some of his early Shakespeare roles, including Romeo in Romeo and Juliet, Ferdinand in The Tempest and Prince Hal in Henry IV in 1926. He was criticised for <b>the</b> <b>audacity</b> he displayed in the latter role. When Prince Hal takes on his kingship and rejects the self-indulgent character Falstaff, convention of the day called for Prince Hal to change from a jovial drinking partner to an arrogant snob, but Shaw saw the view as simple-minded and contradictory toward Shakespeare's script. Instead, he displayed inward regrets about leaving Falstaff and accepting the new responsibilities. The interpretation was criticised at the time but, years later, became the standard approach to the character.|$|E

5|$|The {{attack on}} Singapore Harbour was codenamed Operation Jaywick, {{the brand name}} of a popular {{lavatory}} deodoriser, and {{had nothing to do}} with guerrillas or fifth columnists. It had been carried out by Lieutenant Colonel Ivan Lyon from 'Z' Special Unit, a group of AngloAustralian commandos who had sailed from Western Australia to Singapore in an old Japanese fishing boat, the Krait, named after a Malayan snake. Once within striking distance of the harbour, the commandos took to folboats (folding canoes), and paddled into the docks under cover of night. Using limpet mines, they sank six Japanese ships of 2,0005,000 tons, including several tankers, and then slipped away to their rendezvous with the Krait, finally returning successfully to Australia. (The Krait is now preserved and on display at the Australian National Maritime Museum in Sydney). The Japanese could not conceive that a force could penetrate their lines of defence and have <b>the</b> <b>audacity</b> to attack their shipping. They therefore concluded that it must have been an internal operation, carried out by Chinese guerrillas organised from Changi Prison.|$|E

In the less than twenty minutes it took to deliver the speech, Obama was catapulted to sudden fame, with many analysts predicting {{that he might be}} well positioned to enter a future presidential race. In 2006, Obama released <b>The</b> <b>Audacity</b> of Hope, a book-length account that expanded upon many of the same themes he originally addressed in the convention speech.|$|E

25|$|Oswald Boelcke was studious {{as well as}} athletic, excelling at {{mathematics}} and physics. His father was a nationalist and a militarist.

25|$|Zerachiah's {{independence}} also displeased the conservatives, however, and refutations of his criticisms {{were written}} by Nahmanides under the title Milḥamot hashem, and by Abraham ben David of Posquières, who alluded in his harsh fashion to Zerahiah as an immature youth who had had <b>the</b> <b>audacity</b> to criticize his master, and even accused him of having appropriated some of his (Abraham's) own interpretations without mentioning the author. A justification of Zerahiah's critique was written by Ezra Malki under the title Shemen la-Ma'or, and since 1552 the Sefer ha-Ma'or has always been printed together with Alfasi.|$|E

On November 6, 2012, Obama was reelected to a second term as President of the United States, defeating former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney.|$|E
25|$|The new club {{entered the}} Southern Football League, famous {{for being the}} league that Tottenham Hotspur played in when {{becoming}} the only non-league team to win the FA Cup, once again playing alongside Plymouth and Exeter's reserve sides and also Boscombe F.C. (later to become A.F.C. Bournemouth). Torquay went on to finish in sixth place that season and during the summer break had <b>the</b> <b>audacity</b> to apply for Football League status, but failed to gain a single vote, seeing Boscombe elected to the league instead. From 1923 onwards the league was split into Eastern and Western halves and Torquay United found themselves playing in the Western section.|$|E
25|$|Heading {{into his}} 17th {{professional}} {{season as a}} 42-year-old, Turner's game attire was still a black headband, black sleeve, black shoes and black socks—a tradition dating back to his high school days. Turner's original swag was still on display to make him the game's most compelling figure. Turner was captivated as a youth by <b>the</b> <b>audacity</b> of Michigan's Fab Five, basketball's first hip-hop stars. As a teenager, Turner modelled his appearance and game on them, and {{a quarter of a}} century on, their attitude and aggression still informed his game. On October 8, 2016, in the third game of the 2016–17 season, Turner rolled back the years with a season-best 45 points to help Killester defeat Moycullen 83–74.|$|E

6000|$|This appears <b>the</b> {{extreme of}} <b>audacity.</b> Yet nothing worse came to Knox than questions, by the Council, {{as to his}} refusal of a benefice, and his declining, as he still did, to kneel at the Communion (April 14, 1553). His answers prove that {{he was out of}} harmony with the {{fluctuating}} Anglicanism of the hour. Northumberland could not then resent <b>the</b> <b>audacities</b> of pulpiteers, because the Protestants were the only party who might stand by him in his approaching effort to crown Lady Jane Grey.

25|$|The Overland Campaign {{began as}} Grant's forces crossed the Rapidan River on May 4, 1864. Grant's {{objective}} was to force an engagement with Lee, outside of his Mine Run fortifications, by either drawing his forces out or turning them. Lee, displaying <b>the</b> <b>audacity</b> that characterized his generalship, moved out as Grant desired, but more quickly than Grant anticipated; Union forces had insufficient time to clear the area known as the Wilderness, a tangle of scrub brush and undergrowth in which part of the Battle of Chancellorsville had been fought the previous year. By forcing a fight here, Lee effectively neutralized the Union's advantage in artillery. He ordered Ewell's Corps to advance on the Orange Turnpike, A.P. Hill's in parallel on the Orange Plank Road, and Longstreet's from the distant Gordonsville.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, as Chairman of EDB, {{he decided}} to name {{publicly}} the holders of government scholarships who broke their bonds to shame them. This created a controversy generating public debates on whether those who received scholarship have {{a moral obligation to}} serve, or whether the scholarship is merely a contractual agreement which could be broken in return for the stated penalties. The debate culminated when MP Chng Hee Kok (庄熙国) questioned Yeo's decision. Yeo responded by calling for Chng to resign his seat in Parliament because of his view. This led to even more unhappiness at <b>the</b> <b>audacity</b> of a civil servant talking down to an elected Member of Parliament. Then Deputy Prime Minister, Lee Hsien Loong had to intervene in what was seen as a face-saving rebuke for both– that Philip Yeo was wrong to tell Chng Hee Kok to resign, but Chng had also been wrong in arguing that it was acceptable for scholars to break their bonds because they were merely legal contracts.|$|E
25|$|Ross {{first went}} to Washington, D.C. in 1816 {{as part of a}} Cherokee {{delegation}} to negotiate issues of national boundaries, land ownership and white encroachment. As the only delegate fluent in English, Ross became the principal negotiator, despite his relative youth. When he returned to the Cherokee Nation in 1817, {{he was elected to the}} National Council. He became council president in the following year. The majority of the council were men like Ross, who were wealthy, educated, English-speaking and of mixed blood. Even the traditionalist full-blood Cherokee perceived that he had the skills necessary to contest the whites' demands that the Cherokee cede their land and move beyond the Mississippi River. In this position, Ross's first action was to reject an offer of $200,000 from the US Indian agent made for the Cherokee to voluntarily relocate. Thereafter Ross made more trips to Washington, even as white demands intensified. In 1824, Ross boldly petitioned Congress for redress of Cherokee grievances, the first time a tribe had ever shown <b>the</b> <b>audacity</b> to do such a thing. Along the way, Ross built political support in the capital for the Cherokee cause.|$|E
