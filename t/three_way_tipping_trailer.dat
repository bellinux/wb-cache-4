40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the design of}} a <b>tipping</b> <b>trailer,</b> from a company’s demands andrequests to complete manufacturing documentation. The design is developed for thecompany Abexor AB in Östersund that produces <b>tipping</b> <b>trailers.</b> The product issupposed to be used by Abexors customer to transport cargos of different kinds,such as gravel, stone, dirt, etc. The work commenced with a meeting at the company where demands were set. After that a pre-study was conducted to find out what traffic rules were required forthe trailer to be allowed to be driven on roads. Similar products were examined tosee how the trailer could be designed. The pre-study was followed by an idea andconcept generation. Nine different concepts were generated and the best werechosen for continued work. The concepts that were chosen resulted in a design in CAD were considerationswere taken for dimensions, traffic rules and function. Manufacturing documentationand a list of components to be bought were generated. In the section discussion and conclusions you can see what the thesis has resulted in. It’s also described what could have been done different and guidelines for futuredevelopment have been made...|$|R
40|$|A {{key element}} with which {{manufacturing}} industries should concern themselves {{in respect of}} cost and efficiency of operation is the cycle time for preparing their products. A reduction in operational time can result in dramatic improvements in both cost and efficiency. Unfortunately, cycle time problems are sometimes difficult to analyse: there are many factors related to this parameter. This paper presents a cycle time analysis of a <b>tipping</b> <b>trailer</b> frame in a heavy equipment industry. The cycle time analysis, based on the cycle time data collected by a time study, together {{with the use of}} an Arena software simulation, is outlined. From the results of this study, {{it was found that the}} manufacturing cycle time was 56 hours, and that resources were under-utilised...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} has been issued by Miedema to investigate the production process of the HST <b>Tipping</b> <b>trailers.</b> Since Miedema is adopting the lean philosophy, the company wonders {{whether there is a}} more ‘lean’ production process of the HST possible, and if such a solution is feasible. Another problem that Miedema faces is that it is relatively inflexible in comparison tot its competitors. Since Miedema occupies seasonal production, delivery times on certain products may be high. Miedema has indicated that it wants to explore possibilities to make the company more flexible, especially {{in the light of the}} current economic crisis. At the moment, demand is declining and the company wonders how it can cope with the declining sales and declining production. On the other hand, Miedema expects a surge in demand when the economic downturn has passed; it therefore wants to use this period to prepare itself for that moment. Flexibility is thus an important theme for Miedema, since this might win orders. At the same time the company wants to remain its other KPIs at the same level, for this meets customer expectations. The two most important of these KPIs are quality and the low cost of ownership. Given these facts, Miedema first wants to explore its possibilities, before actual changes are made. Since Miedema has ties to the Lean Operations Research Centre (LORC) of the University of Groningen, it has made the request whether such research can be conducted. Goal of the research is to provide management with an overview of possible production processes for the HST, weighted against potential problems and benefits. It therefore requires an independent research, to approach this question from a neutral perspective. It will support the decision making process for the future production of the HST <b>Tipping</b> <b>Trailer.</b> ...|$|R
50|$|In 1945, Joseph Cyril Bamford founded J C Bamford Excavators Limited in Uttoxeter, {{now known}} as JCB. The firm, based in the nearby village of Rocester, is the world's third-largest {{construction}} equipment manufacturer. The firm's first vehicle was a <b>tipping</b> <b>trailer</b> made from war-surplus materials, which J. C. Bamford built in a rented lock-up garage in Uttoxeter. The Bamford family had previously started Bamfords, later Bamford International Farm Machinery which was a large employer in the town {{from the end of}} the 19th century through to the early 1980s when it gradually went into decline before closing in 1989. The land and former building was acquired by JCB to form its 'Special Products' division which has now closed and the buildings demolished. The land has yet to be developed.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Three</b> <b>Way</b> Independent School District {{was formed}} in May 1945 by the {{consolidation}} of Goodland Consolidated Independent School District No. 7, Watson Independent School District No. 10, and Wilson Independent County Line School District No. 14. <b>Three</b> <b>Way</b> School was built on a 20 acre parcel of land north of Maple. Over the years, several smaller districts - including Stegall (1946) and Bula (1975) - consolidated with <b>Three</b> <b>Way.</b> By the 1994-1995 school year, the district enrolled 127 students. That figure had fallen to 83 by 2001. Faced with declining enrollment and lower funding from the state, <b>Three</b> <b>Way</b> administrators decided that the district would have to consolidate with another larger school district {{by the start of}} the next school year. Three neighboring districts - Morton, Muleshoe, and Sudan - were considered for consolidation. A questionnaire was sent to <b>Three</b> <b>Way</b> ISD parents and registered voters to see which of the candidate districts was most favored. Sudan ISD was selected by approximately 57 percent of <b>Three</b> <b>Way</b> voters and 59 percent of <b>Three</b> <b>Way</b> parents. Both school boards approved the decision and the issue was put to a vote on February 2, 2002. In the election, Sudan ISD voters supported consolidation by a 190-1 margin. Of the 80 votes cast by <b>Three</b> <b>Way</b> ISD residents, 54 supported the measure with 26 opposed. The merger of <b>Three</b> <b>Way</b> ISD with Sudan became official on July 1, 2002.|$|R
