40|$|The {{dynamical}} discrete web is {{a system}} of one-dimensional coalescing random walks that evolves in an extra dynamical <b>time</b> parameter. <b>At</b> any deterministic dynamical time, the paths behave as coalescing simple symmetric random walks. This paper studies the existence of (random) exceptional dynamical <b>times</b> <b>at</b> which the paths violate certain almost sure properties of random walks. It was shown in 2009 by Fontes, Newman, Ravishankar and Schertzer that there exist exceptional <b>times</b> <b>at</b> which the path starting from the origin violates {{the law of the}} iterated logarithm. Their results gave exceptional <b>times</b> <b>at</b> which the path is slightly subdiffusive in one direction. This paper extends this to obtain <b>times</b> <b>at</b> which the path is slightly superdiffusive in one direction and <b>times</b> <b>at</b> which the path is slightly subdiffusive in both directions. We also obtain upper and lower bounds for the Hausdorff dimensions of the sets of two-sided subdiffusive exceptional times, and a lower bound for the Hausdorff dimension of set of superdiffusive exceptional times.
