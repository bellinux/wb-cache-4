5|$|Lower-class {{citizens}} used common {{forms of}} funerary art—including shabti figurines (to perform any labor {{that might be}} required of the dead person in the afterlife), models of the scarab beetle and funerary texts—which they believed would protect them in the afterlife. During the Middle Kingdom, miniature wooden or clay models depicting scenes from everyday life became popular additions to tombs. In an attempt <b>to</b> <b>duplicate</b> <b>the</b> activities of the living in the afterlife, these models show laborers, houses, boats and even military formations which are scale representations of the ideal ancient Egyptian afterlife.|$|E
50|$|The {{direct effect}} of this {{optimization}} is to improve time performance(by eliminating call overhead), {{at the cost of}} worsening space usage (due <b>to</b> <b>duplicating</b> <b>the</b> function body). The code expansion due <b>to</b> <b>duplicating</b> <b>the</b> function body dominates, except for simple cases, and thus the direct effect of inline expansion is to improve time at the cost of space.|$|R

5|$|On February 5, 2009, TNT {{announced}} {{the addition of}} H–O–R–S–E to its All-Star Weekend coverage. The competition was held outdoors on a half-sized court during the special Inside the NBA show prior to the All-Star Saturday Night events. The objective of this competition is to accrue as few of the five letters as possible. A player is given a letter every time they fail <b>to</b> <b>duplicate</b> <b>the</b> shot of another player. Each player was given 24 seconds to make or duplicate the shot (dunking was prohibited). Each player who fails to duplicate five shots was eliminated from the competition. An NBA referee was assigned to rule whether the shot was done properly.|$|E
5|$|Pharaohs used reliefs {{to record}} {{victories}} in battle, royal decrees, and religious scenes. Common citizens {{had access to}} pieces of funerary art, such as shabti statues and books of the dead, which they believed would protect them in the afterlife. During the Middle Kingdom, wooden or clay models depicting scenes from everyday life became popular additions to the tomb.

5|$|Recognizing at {{an early}} age that he had an incisive mind for politics, Marcas had allied himself with an unnamed man of some fame who lacked wisdom and insight. They became a team, with the other man serving as the public face and Marcas as the advisor. Once his {{associate}} had ascended into office, however, he abandoned Marcas, then hired and abandoned him again. Marcas was left poor and unknown, resigned <b>to</b> <b>duplicate</b> <b>the</b> writing of others for very little pay.|$|E
40|$|Global {{instruction}} scheduling allows operations to move across basic block boundaries to create tighter schedules. When operations move above control flow joins, some code duplication is generally necessary to preserve semantics. Tail duplication and compensation code are approaches <b>to</b> <b>duplicating</b> <b>the</b> necessary code, used by Superblock Scheduling and Trace Scheduling respectively. Compensation code needs much more engineering effort, but offers {{the possibility of}} less code growth...|$|R

5|$|Replacement of the ship's -tall, -wide lower masts in {{wood was}} not feasible, {{so they were}} made of steel tube cut and welded to shape, with a ladder inside each mast to allow access to the {{platforms}} on the masts. The three masts and the bowsprit were stepped in place between September 1984 and February 1985. Warriors engines, boilers and auxiliary machinery were considered too expensive to rebuild, so replicas were built from sheet steel with a few components made from cast iron <b>to</b> <b>duplicate</b> <b>the</b> look of the real equipment. The replica engines can rotate slowly, using electrical power, to allow visitors to imagine how they might have looked in operation.|$|E
5|$|Spall {{auditioned for}} another role, but Ridley Scott {{asked him to}} play Millburn. Trying <b>to</b> <b>duplicate</b> <b>the</b> {{reaction}} of the Alien cast to the chestburster scene, the director {{did not tell the}} Prometheus cast that a Hammerpede puppet was in the silicon replica of Spall's body; Kate Dickie's scream is genuine. The character of Milburn was criticized, since no biologist would touch an unidentified, extraterrestrial organism displaying hostility. Spall defended his character, citing a deleted scene where Millburn holds a smaller, docile Hammerpede.|$|E
25|$|By 1908, the {{situation}} had become unbearable, and with the need <b>to</b> <b>duplicate</b> <b>the</b> line, the old single-track tunnel was replaced by an almost tunnel-free alignment, with a reduced ruling grade of 1 in 60.|$|E

The linearized pGDTV vectors were transfected into ES cells by electroporation. 245 drug-resistant cell clones were obtained in both G 418 and GANC medium {{and the frequency}} of surviving cells was 6. 22 × 10 - 5. Two ES cell clones were identified <b>to</b> have <b>duplicated</b> <b>the</b> p 35 Nck 5 a gene by use of both PCR and genomic Southern blotting, {{and the frequency of}} homologous recombination is 5. 08 × 10 - 7.
