25|$|While {{there were}} no {{attempts}} to take away Abel's priesthood authority, that authority was repeatedly challenged by church leaders. In 1879, a meeting was held at Abraham Smoot's house to discuss the conflicting versions of Joseph Smith's views on blacks and the priesthood. According to L. John Nuttall, who detailed the meeting in his journal, John Taylor acknowledged an account of a discussion between Zebedee Coltrin and Joseph Smith. Allegedly, Coltrin had gone to Smith with questions regarding blacks and the priesthood, believing that <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> those rights. Smith responded to him with {{the account of the}} Apostle Peter's vision in Acts 10, in which he was commanded by God to teach the Gentiles despite being a Jew himself. However, Coltrin, who was present at the meeting, denied that this conversation ever took place. It is unclear where Taylor received this information from.|$|E

500|$|The Eriskay Pony {{generally}} {{stands between}} [...] It is usually grey in colour, {{although a few}} are bay or black. Dark coloured animals generally have the pangaré characteristics of a light-coloured muzzle and ring around their eye. However, according to breed standards, <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> an eel stripe. Chestnut, piebald, skewbald and excess white markings are discouraged by breed registries. The winter coat is dense and waterproof to protect from the harsh climate, with a thick mane and tail. The head is large, with a wide forehead. The neck and shoulders are well muscled, and the chest deep but generally not broad. The rib-cage is long and the loins short, which increases {{the strength of the}} back. The croup is slightly sloping. It is quite similar to the Exmoor pony in body type. The Eriskay has an easy-going temperament and is suitable as a mount for children. It is used for light draught work, as well as dressage, show jumping, three-day eventing, western riding and driving. Eriskays have successfully competed in combined driving at highly competitive international level competitions sanctioned by the Fédération Équestre Internationale. They have also been used in therapeutic horse-riding.|$|E

To Andy's great dismay, they earn 5,000 points {{by the end of}} the day. When Andy and the crew go to the tattoo parlor, Andy backs down and admits to Jim that he is not sure why Robert made him manager. Jim reassures Andy that he managed to pick up sales, and that no one in the office expects him to go through with the tattoo idea. Pepped up by Jim's talk, Andy enthusiastically agrees to getting the tattoo, which Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) changes, without telling Andy, to an image of a dog that has [...] "Nard" [...] written on it, a reference to Andy's nickname [...] "Nard Dog." [...] Upon seeing his completed tattoo in a mirror, Andy is pleased with the result. Robert then reveals to the cameras that he picked Andy because he is an uncomplicated choice which causes people to rally behind him, because he is an underdog. Meanwhile, Pam and Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) become walking buddies at Angela's request, but after Angela says she's reported Pam to Social Services for drinking herbal tea out of coffee mugs while pregnant, a disgusted Pam tells Angela <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> anything else to do with each other.|$|E

500|$|Many {{members of}} the Australian media alleged a {{conspiracy}} against Meckiff. Ian McDonald of Melbourne's Sporting Globe said the bowler's action had not changed in the previous eight years and stated: [...] "the whole affair smacks of a set-up". Sydney's Mirror labelled the paceman [...] "the most obvious fall-guy in Australian cricket history". On the third morning of the match, former first-class cricketer Percy Beames, writing for Melbourne's The Age, claimed Meckiff had {{been used as a}} [...] "sacrificial goat" [...] and called for the selectors' resignation. Keith Miller wrote a column calling for Bradman's and Jack Ryder's removal from the selection panel, noting that they had watched Meckiff's performance against Western Australia which prompted his Test selection. Miller felt that if the selectors deemed the bowler illegitimate, then <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> allowed him to be [...] "executed" [...] by the umpires. Jack Pollard said: [...] "there is little doubt Meckiff was sacrificed to end the long-running controversy and the way it was done irked many cricket-lovers." [...] Cricketer-turned-journalist Dick Whitington asserted that Benaud was aware his fast bowler had been set up, claiming that the Australian captain knew of Bradman's views on Meckiff's action. Whitington further cited the fact that Egar and Bradman had travelled from Adelaide to the Brisbane Test together as evidence of a plot. Others saw Bradman's tea-time conversation with Benaud after the no-balling as proof of a conspiracy. Benaud repudiated allegations claiming he was involved in a set-up.|$|E

In her place, Lois, growing tired of the whole ordeal, convinces Peter to change his mind after raping him. At the same time, Lois catches Meg and Doug engaging in [...] "ear sex" [...] (which has become a fad at the school). Meg explains they did it so that it would not count as sex [...] "in the eyes of the Lord." [...] This prompts Lois and Peter to collaborate into sneaking into the school after being banned. Lois tells the kids that while <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> sex until they are ready, everyone has urges and it is okay to have premarital sex, but only {{as long as it is}} practiced safely and encourages them to use condoms. Following this revelation, Meg's boyfriend breaks up with her after discovering Meg's naked appearance. Humiliated, Meg blames Lois for ruining her relationship and runs away to her room, sobbing. As Peter, Brian, and Lois wrap things up, an announcer tells viewers to text which ending should end the episode: Lois retelling her speech (FAMGUY1), Meg talking about her day (FAMGUY2), or Cleveland giving his line (FAMGUY 3). In the end, the viewers choose FAMGUY 3, and the episode ends with Cleveland poking out the window and saying the line [...] "Hey Y'all! Sock it to me!".|$|E
500|$|The court's {{decision}} aroused [...] "little sensation" [...] domestically.

The Soviet government had destroyed the Christ the Savior Cathedral in the 1930s (it was rebuilt in the 1990s), adding to the location's significance to believers. At {{the conclusion of the}} trial, a series of Levada Center polls showed that, of 1600 Russians surveyed in 45 cities nationwide, 42% also believed Pussy Riot had been arrested for insulting the shrines and beliefs of the Orthodox Church. Meanwhile, 29% saw it as a case of general hooliganism, while only 19% saw it as a political protest against Putin. Overall opinion was for the most part negative or indifferent. Only 6% sympathised with Pussy Riot, while 41% felt antipathy towards them. 44% believed the trial was [...] "fair and impartial", while 17% believed it was not. Of those following the case, 86% favored some form of punishment, ranging from prison to forced labor or fines, while 5% said <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been punished at all. A prison sentence of 2 to 7 years was seen as appropriate by 33%, whereas 43% saw two or more years as excessive, and a further 15% said the defendants should not have been prosecuted in court.

500|$|On 17 February 1981 Kujau flew to Stuttgart {{and gave}} Heidemann the three {{recently}} prepared diaries, for which Heidemann gave him 35,000DMs. This {{was a great}} deal less than the 120,000DMs—40,000DMs per diary—promised to Kujau in the first meeting, from which Heidemann would also claim a 10% commission; the reduction in funds was explained by a need to get an [...] "expert opinion" [...] on the authenticity of the diaries, and the balance was later paid. The following day the reporter delivered the diaries to Gruner + Jahr. In the subsequent meeting with Walde, Hensmann, Sorge and Fischer, Heidemann and Walde again insisted on secrecy about the project, to ensure their acquisition of all the diaries—it was agreed that not even the editors of Stern should be told of the discovery. More importantly, according to Harris, it was decided that <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> the material examined by a forensic scientist or historian until every diary had been obtained. Fischer committed the company to the future purchases by immediately allocating onemillion DM to the project. The company also set up a dedicated unit to deal with the diaries in an annex to the main Gruner + Jahr offices. It was headed by Walde, and consisted of an assistant, two secretaries and Heidemann. On receipt of the diaries they were photocopied and transcribed from the gothic script into modern German. Heidemann also entered into a private contract with Gruner + Jahr, which was kept secret from the company's legal and personnel departments. It contained a deal for him to publish books through the company at a generous royalty rate, and agreed that ten years after publication the original diaries would be given to Heidemann for research purposes, to be handed on to the West German government on his death. He was also to be given a bonus of 300,000DMs for recovering the first eight diaries.|$|E
