5|$|The holotype {{specimen}} of A. atacis {{is a group}} of three connected dorsal vertebrae. Cervical vertebrae are uncommon from Bellevue {{and most of them are}} poorly preserved. The vertebrae are opisthocoelous, with centra that lengthen <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear.</b> Neural spines have been preserved on the vertebrae, and they face <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear.</b> Two dorsal vertebrae were preserved with a complete, but very crushed neural arch, a neural spine with a characteristic shape: it is very widened distally and narrows downwards. The vertebrae also have an internal structure that is spongy, with very large cells. The caudal vertebrae are all strongly procoelous and are compressed on the sides. The neural spines of the caudal vertebrae are very narrow and very tall and point <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear.</b> The middle caudal vertebrae are more compressed on the sides that the others. Also, the centrum of middle caudal vertebrae is longer proportionally. Two sacral vertebrae were known from Bellevue. They are poorly preserved, and are thought to belong to a juvenile. A complete sacrum was also found in 2002.|$|E
5|$|Altgens was on {{assignment}} for the AP when he captured two historic images on November 22, 1963. The second photograph, showing First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> {{of the presidential}} limousine and Secret Service agent Clint Hill on its bumper, was reproduced {{on the front pages}} of newspapers around the world. Within days, Altgens' preceding photograph became controversial after people began to question whether accused assassin Lee Harvey Oswald was visible in the main doorway of the Texas School Book Depository as the gunshots were fired at JFK.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to lure out and destroy {{a portion of the}} Grand Fleet, the German High Seas Fleet with 16 dreadnoughts, six pre-dreadnoughts, six light cruisers and 31 torpedo boats {{commanded}} by Vice Admiral Reinhard Scheer, departed the Jade early on the morning of 31 May. The fleet sailed in concert with Rear Admiral Franz von Hipper's five battlecruisers and supporting cruisers and torpedo boats. The Royal Navy's Room 40 had intercepted and decrypted German radio traffic containing plans of the operation. The Admiralty ordered the Grand Fleet of 28 dreadnoughts and 9 battlecruisers, to sortie the night before to cut off and destroy the High Seas Fleet. On the day of the battle, Marlborough was stationed <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> of the British line in the 6th Division of the 1st Battle Squadron.|$|E

50|$|Divorce {{is legal}} and {{relatively}} easy to obtain, but not common. Divorced persons are viewed with some disapproval. Each spouse retains whatever property he or she brought into the marriage, and jointly-acquired property is divided equally. Divorced persons may remarry, but the woman must wait ten months. Custody of minor children is usually given to the mother, and both parents continue to {{have an obligation to}} contribute financially <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>rearing</b> and education of the child.The divorced male doesn't have a waiting period before he can remarry.|$|R
50|$|Divorced {{persons are}} viewed with some disapproval, {{and they are}} not invited {{to take part in the}} blessing of a newlywed couple. Some of the common grounds for divorce are incompatibility, {{prolonged}} absence without good reason, abandonment by either partner, refusal of the husband to provide for the family, adultery, immoral conduct, and refusal, for more than a year, to permit sexual intercourse. A magistrate may legalise the divorce. Each spouse retains whatever property he or she brought into the marriage. Property acquired jointly is divided equally. Divorced persons may remarry, but the woman must wait ten months. Custody of minor children is usually given to the mother.

25|$|The {{position}} of the exhaust outlet changed {{so that it was}} now angled upwards <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> wing instead of downwards to face the rear diffuser so as to make the practice of using exhaust blown diffusers—passing exhaust gasses over the rear diffuser to improve the car's downforce—extremely difficult to achieve.|$|E
25|$|The lower wings were {{mounted on}} the top of a flat bottomed, single-stepped hull with flat sides which tapered in profile <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear.</b> The wings were further braced to the hull by a pair of struts {{reaching}} back from the nose to the centre wing leading edge. The nose also had raised decking protecting of the pilot, who sat in the front of the open cockpit with a passenger seat behind him.|$|E
25|$|Abercrombie {{thought that}} the carbon {{particle}} is a marker on the cell surface and its behaviour reflects what the surface is doing. This led him to propose that, as a cell moves, membrane from internal stores is added {{at the front of}} the cell—enabling the cell to extend forward—and retrieved <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> of the cell. This process of exocytosis {{at the front of the}} cell and endocytosis elsewhere has been modified by Bretscher. He and Hopkins showed that the specific membrane endocytosed by coated pits on motile cells is returned by exocytosis to the cell surface at the leading edge. The spatial difference between the sites of exocytosis (at the front) and endocytosis (everywhere on the surface) leads to a flow of the matrix of the plasma membrane—lipids—from the front <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear.</b> Large objects, such as patches, would be swept along with this flow, whereas non-crosslinked small molecules would be able to diffuse by Brownian motion against the flow and so evade being swept backward. Hence, in this theory, the need for crosslinking. Bretscher proposed that on stationary cells exocytosis is random—and therefore a major difference between motile and nonmotile cells.|$|E

50|$|The Boer War Memorial is {{situated}} in a small park in Allora facing Warwick Street, in which memorials to the two World Wars are also found. The park is enclosed by a substantial brick and wrought iron fence along Warwick Street with a centrally placed gateway formed by brick newels with plaster finials and with an iron gate. The Boer and First World War memorials are towards the southern, Warwick Street side {{of the park and}} the Second World War Memorial is located <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> northern, <b>rear</b> of <b>the</b> park centrally placed between the others.|$|R
25|$|The Union cavalrymen {{crashed into}} the column of now lightly {{protected}} wagons. Custer, in his enthusiasm for the charge, was thrown from his horse and nearly captured. Grumble Jones also narrowly avoided capture. Pennington's artillery began shelling the wagons <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> of the column, splintering carriages and blocking any opportunity for retreat. The Union and Confederate cavalrymen became thoroughly mixed up among the wagons and the enemies were unable to differentiate themselves in the darkness. Several friendly fire incidents occurred as Union troopers accidentally fired on their own lines.|$|E
25|$|After {{the coastal}} forts fell, the {{remaining}} Malays fled <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> {{of the town}} where another fort lay, but instead of engaging the last remaining fort the Americans attacked the town itself. Large scale looting and pillaging occurred {{with a range of}} plunder being looted from the town as well as many civilians slain. Downes later ordered his men to return to the ship and bombarded the fifth fort as well as the town until its surviving leaders agreed to surrender, killing another 300 natives in the process.|$|E
25|$|The C-69 {{was mostly}} {{used as a}} high-speed, long-distance troop {{transport}} during the war. A total of 22 C-69s were completed {{before the end of}} hostilities, but not all of these entered military service. The USAAF cancelled the remainder of the order in 1945. However, some aircraft remained in USAF service into the 1960s, serving as passenger ferries for the airline that relocated military personnel, and carrying the livery of the Military Air Transport Service. At least one of these airplanes had passenger seats installed backward, with occupants facing <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> of the direction of travel during flight.|$|E
50|$|In plan, the DeRhodes {{house is}} {{a mirror image of}} the 1904 Barton House in Buffalo, New York.

50|$|The Strand Theatre stands {{near the}} southeastern end of Rockland's {{downtown}} area, {{on the east}} side of Main Street. It is a large multisection brick building; its front section is two stories in height, and houses the main lobby and balcony. The middle section houses the main seating area, and has a roof that slopes down <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> stage. <b>The</b> <b>rear</b> section houses <b>the</b> stage, and is three stories in height, allowing for a large theatrical backdrop fly system. The front facade of the building is divided into three sections articulated by brick pilasters, on which are found gray-blue ceramic tiles with Egyptian themes. The outer sections are storefronts, each with a recessed entrance flanked by display windows. The theater entrance is at the center, consisting of recessed double doors. The wall above the storefronts has recessed panels, while that above the main entrance has a segmented-arch multi-part window, and is capped by a segmented parapet. Projecting in front of this window is the theater's marquee and sign.|$|R
25|$|Throughout June, Sherman {{continued}} {{to attempt to}} outmaneuver Confederate Gen. Joseph E. Johnston's forces. On the 22nd, the regiment saw a stiff fight at the Battle of Kolb's Farm. In this battle, the men had stacked their arms <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> of a position they {{had just begun to}} fortify with breastworks, when suddenly two divisions of Confederate troops appeared in the clearing. After running to retrieve their rifles and loading them as they returned to the line, the 46th and the rest of their brigade, supported by artillery, proceeded to handily repulse the Rebels, inflicting terrible casualties, but incurring very few of their own.|$|E
25|$|Gilmour {{transferred}} the Royal Flying Corps in December 1915, and {{was awarded the}} Royal Aero Club Aviator's Certificate No. 2888 after soloing in a Maurice Farman biplane at the military flying school at Farnborough on 17 March 1916. He was assigned to No. 27 Squadron. They were the sole squadron equipped with the Martinsyde G.100, commonly called the Elephant. This aircraft was nicknamed for being large and ungainly. A single seater, it was too big, slow, and manoeuvrable {{to be a successful}} fighter, and without a rear gunner, too defenceless to survive well in a ground attack or bombing role. It was equipped with a Lewis machine gun mounted on the upper wing firing over the propeller, and a second one on the fuselage pointed <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear.</b>|$|E
25|$|Traditional cycle lanes {{increase}} vehicle/bicycle collisions. When exiting, a motorist {{must look}} ahead to avoid colliding with another vehicle or with pedestrians on a crosswalk. As the intersection curves away from the exit, the path of an exiting vehicle is relatively straight, and so the motorist may often not slow substantially. To {{give way to a}} cyclist on the outside, requires the exiting motorist to look <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear,</b> to the perimeter. Other vehicles can obstruct the driver's view in this direction, complicating the motorist's task. The more frequent requirements for motorists to slow or stop reduce traffic flow. A 1992 study found that the risk to cyclists is high in all such intersections, but much higher when the junction has a marked bicycle lane or sidepath around its perimeter. Cycle lanes were installed at St. John's roundabout in Newbury, Berkshire, England and at Museum Road, Portsmouth, England. The cycle lanes at Museum Road were replaced by a narrowed carriageway to encourage lane sharing, while the St. John's roundabout retains perimeter cycle lanes.|$|E
5000|$|Gemsbok {{are light}} brownish-grey to tan in colour, with lighter patches <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> bottom <b>rear</b> of <b>the</b> rump. Their tails {{are long and}} black in colour. A blackish stripe extends from the chin down the lower edge of the neck, through the {{juncture}} of the shoulder and leg along the lower flank of each side to the blackish section of <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> leg. They have muscular necks and shoulders, and their legs have white 'socks' with a black patch {{on the front of}} both the front legs, and both genders have long, straight horns. Comparably, the East African oryx lacks a dark patch {{at the base of the}} tail, has less black on the legs (none on the hindlegs), and less black on the lower flanks. One very rare condition is the [...] "Golden Oryx", in which the Gemsboks black markings are muted and now appear golden.|$|R

40|$|Rising world population, {{increasing}} urbanization, casting {{doubts about}} the sustainability of intensive food production systems and an apparent slow-down {{in the rate of}} yield increase in the major food resources have led some observers to argue for a higher priority to pure and applied scientific researches and investments for increasing the productivity and production amount of economic plants and animals. In addition, a new competition between food supply and alternative energy production has been occurred recently. At the same time, the establishment of international education programs and enrichment of the contents have been needed for the enhancement of contemporary globalization in higher education. Therefore, in response to the food supply and distribution problems on the global, regional and local scales, Mie University (MU) and Sriwijaya University (UNSRI) in Republic of Indonesia agreed in July, 2008 to carry out the Double Degree Master Program (Collaborative Degree Program) based on the Agreement of “Academic Cooperation and Exchange” between the two universities. Graduate School of Bioresources, MU and Graduate School of Crop Sciences, UNSRI established “Integrated Food Production and Management Planning” Program (DD-IFP) supported by Ministry of National Education, Republic of Indonesia in April, 2009. The establishment of the DD-IFP collaboratively by MU and UNSRI reflects three principal needs, not only institutional and academic needs but also professional need. From the viewpoint of professional need, the establishment of the DD-IFD is projected to contribute surely <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>rearing</b> of professional human resources who are expected as worldwide Asian leaders having strong background of knowledge on food production and management...|$|R
25|$|Swing is {{produced}} {{due to a}} net force acting on the ball from one side; that is, the side with the more turbulent boundary layer. For conventional swing bowling, the raised seam and the direction it points governs the direction of swing. Due to the angled seam of the ball, air flowing over the seam produces turbulence on the side that the seam is angled toward. This causes the boundary layer to separate {{from the surface of}} the ball later (farther <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> of the ball) than the other side where it separates earlier (farther forward on the surface). As explained by Bernoulli's principle, there is a net pressure differential due to the greater pressure on the side with the more intact boundary layer. The resulting net force acts so as to move or swing the ball in the direction of the angled seam. Conventional swing bowling is delivered with the seam angled such that the smooth or polished side of the ball faces forward to move the ball in the direction of the seam i.e. toward the rough side.|$|E
25|$|Three days later, on July 20, Coleman and Brown {{were arrested}} in Evanston. As Coleman and Brown walked westward across an intersection, they passed {{immediately}} {{in front of a}} man in a car stopped at the red light who was from Coleman's neighborhood in Waukegan. He recognized Coleman and drove north to a gas station and notified the police. A description of the two was broadcast to police. As officers entered the area, a detective saw Coleman and Brown sitting on portable bleachers in empty Mason Park, but noted they were wearing different T-shirts. As the detective reported this, two sergeants who were driving by the park heard this, turned, and saw Coleman and Brown. As they approached Coleman, the officers observed Brown walking away from Coleman <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> of the park. The detective joined the two sergeants and Coleman was approached for questioning; he had no identification and denied he was Alton Coleman. Meanwhile, two other officers stopped Brown as she tried to exit the park, searched her, and found a gun in her purse. The pair were taken into custody without incident and transported to the Evanston Police Department, where both were identified by their fingerprints.|$|E
25|$|In June, 1863, McNair’s Brigade was re{{assigned}} to Walker's (later French's) Division of the Army of the Department of Mississippi and Eastern Louisiana, Lieutenant General William J.

Johnston who was assigned {{the mission of}} organizing a force to attempt to relieve General Pemberton’s besieged army at Vicksburg. Johnston had been gathering troops at Jackson, intending to relieve pressure on Lt. Gen. John C. Pemberton's beleaguered garrison. Johnston cautiously advanced his 30,000 soldiers <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> of Grant's army surrounding Vicksburg. In response, Grant ordered Sherman to deal with Johnston's threat. By July 1, 1863, Johnston's force was in position along the Big Black River. Sherman used the newly arrived IX Corps to counter this threat. On July 5, {{the day after the}} surrender of Vicksburg was made official; Sherman was free to move against Johnston. Johnston hastily withdrew his force across the Big Black River and Champion's Hill battlefields with Sherman in pursuit. Sherman had with him the IX Corps, XV Corps, XIII Corps, and a detachment of the XVI Corps. On July 10 the Union Army had taken up position around Jackson. The heaviest fighting in the Siege of Jackson came on July 11 during an unsuccessful Union attack, which resulted in heavy casualties. Instead of risking entrapment, Johnston chose to evacuate the state capital and withdrew on July 16. Sherman's forces occupied the city the following day.|$|E

60|$|Johnston {{had fallen}} back to Marietta and Kenesaw Mountain, where strong intrenchments awaited him. At this latter place our troops made an assault upon the enemy's lines after having got their own lines {{up close to}} him, and failed, {{sustaining}} considerable loss. But during {{the progress of the}} battle Schofield was gaining ground to the left; and the cavalry on his left were gaining still more <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> enemy's <b>rear.</b> These operations were completed by the 3d of July, when it was found that Johnston had evacuated the place. He was pursued at once. Sherman had made every preparation to abandon the railroad, leaving a strong guard in his intrenchments. He had intended, moving out with twenty days' rations and plenty of ammunition, to come in on the railroad again at the Chattahoochee River. Johnston frustrated this plan by himself starting back as above stated. This time he fell back to the Chattahoochee.|$|R
50|$|Seydlitz {{recalled}} his cavalry. This in itself was unusual: normally, a cavalry attacked once, maybe twice, {{and spent the}} rest of the battle chasing fleeing troops. Seydlitz led his rallied force <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> flank and <b>rear</b> of <b>the</b> Allied army, out of the fighting and into a copse of trees, where the horses and men could catch their breath. The Allies, relieved to see the last of the horsemen, became preoccupied with the Prussian infantry, about four battalions of it, threatening in a linear line of battle to their left. Instead of forming into a similar line of attack, the French battalions formed into columns, fixed their bayonets and marched forward.|$|R

500|$|The 767's {{fuselage}} width was set {{midway between}} {{that of the}} 707 and the 747 at [...] While it was narrower than previous wide-body designs, seven abreast seating with two aisles could be fitted, and the reduced width produced less aerodynamic drag. The fuselage was not wide enough to accommodate two standard LD3 wide-body unit load devices side-by-side, so a smaller container, the LD2, was created specifically for the 767. Using a conventional tail design also allowed the rear fuselage to be tapered over a shorter section, providing for parallel aisles along {{the full length of}} the passenger cabin, and eliminating irregular seat rows <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> of the aircraft.|$|E
500|$|Many {{times the}} shape of the wings {{correlates}} with the type of insect flight. The best-flying insects tend to have long, slender wings. In many species of Sphingidae (sphinx moths), the forewings are large and sharply pointed, forming with the small hindwings a triangle that is suggestive of the wings of fast, modern airplanes. Another, possibly more important correlation, is that of the size and power of the muscles to the speed and power of flight. In the powerfully flying insects, the wings are most adapted for the stresses and aerodynamics of flight. The veins are thicker, stronger, and closer together toward the front edge (or [...] "leading edge") and thinner yet flexible <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> edge (or [...] "trailing edge"). This makes the insect wing an excellently constructed airfoil, capable of exerting both propulsion and lift while minimizing drag.|$|E
