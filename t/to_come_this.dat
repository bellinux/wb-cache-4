Reines dedicated the major part of his career {{to the study of}} the neutrino's properties and interactions, which work would influence study of the neutrino for many researchers <b>to</b> <b>come.</b> <b>This</b> included the detection of neutrinos created in the atmosphere by cosmic rays, and the 1987 detection of neutrinos emitted from Supernova SN1987A, which inaugurated the field of neutrino astronomy.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} role in the Clan is that of the leader. The Clan leader overlooks all duties of Clan life, and will make all the important decisions, such as whether or not to engage in battle. Each Clan leader is given nine lives by StarClan, in order to sacrifice their lives nine times over to protect their Clan, and to serve their clans for many more moons <b>to</b> <b>come.</b> <b>This</b> means that Clan leaders can often live longer than that of a normal cat. To mark their new status, Clan leaders are given the suffix –star (e.g. Bluestar, Tallstar, and Brokenstar). Generally, Clan leaders sleep alone, although male leaders are allowed to take a mate. Female leaders are inhibited from taking a mate or having kits, which has led to discussions of sexism among many fans of the series.|$|E

25|$|Obama and Zapatero met {{face-to-face}} for {{the first}} time on April 2, 2009, at the G20 London Summit. Both leaders participated in the NATO Summit in Strasbourg-Kehl, where Spain committed an additional 450 troops to its previous military contingent of 778 in Afghanistan. Commentators said the decision may have been partially motivated by the Zapatero government's desire to curry favor with the new administration in Washington. Days later at the EU-U.S. Summit in Prague the two held a 45-minute meeting, and afterwards shared a photo-op for the press, where Obama called Zapatero a friend, and said he thinks that the two nations would establish an even stronger relationship in the years <b>to</b> <b>come.</b> <b>This</b> was the first formal meeting between heads of government of Spain and the United States since 2004.|$|E
25|$|The P.A.B.C. {{initiative}} (Public Art Building Communities), {{has allowed}} me to make a bridge between the community, the Restaurant Mama Ayesha’s, the arts and all the people who have made this mural a reality. This could not be done without the support of all the community and the help of the DC Commission and the Restaurant and all the entities who funded the project. I hope that this mural will become a teaching tool of the History of the Presidents for schools, children and the public in general. This is a gift to the City of Washington DC to celebrate this historical moment in American History and will remain open to the public to see for generations <b>to</b> <b>come.</b> <b>This</b> is fulfilling the idea that mural art is available for the public and for the masses.|$|E
500|$|Ricks, {{a native}} of the Ninth Ward, later told NBC Nightly News that he wrote the {{bulletin}} based on his previous experiences with Betsy and Camille. [...] He also said that he was looking for statements to take out, but decided to leave the bulletin more or less intact because it seemed valid for a storm that he was convinced would be [...] "the big one" [...] longtime New Orleans residents had been predicting for some time. [...] He admitted that he and his colleagues hoped to have been wrong about just how powerful Katrina would become, [...] "but our local expertise said otherwise." [...] He added, [...] "We always prepare for the big one, we just didn't think it was going <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>this</b> soon." ...|$|E

We had one hiccough early on pit road {{but the rest of}} them we picked out our spots every single time, and that’s what it takes; it takes a team effort." [...] In the subsequent post-race press conference, Hamlin said, [...] "Anytime that Jimmie is down is not usually because of performance, it's usually because of an incident like last week. There was {{no doubt in my mind}} they were going <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>this</b> week and make a statement. Obviously leading all the laps pretty much and winning the race sends a statement out there that he is the best, that they're not going to be denied this year." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{subject of}} Eliot's poem {{is drawn from}} the second chapter of the Gospel of Luke (...) , and the early Christian canticle Nunc dimittis derived from it. In Luke's account, Simeon, an aged and devout Jew, stands in the Temple of Jerusalem at the time Mary and Joseph bring the infant Jesus to be {{presented}} in the temple forty days after his birth in accordance with Jewish law and custom. Luke states that Simeon is [...] "waiting for the consolation of Israel" [...] after being promised that [...] "he should not see death before {{he had seen the}} Lord's Christ". (...) Simeon, upon seeing the child, takes him into his arms and prays, prophesizing the redemption of the world by Jesus and of suffering <b>to</b> <b>come.</b> <b>This</b> prayer would become known later as the Nunc dimittis from its Latin incipit.|$|E
500|$|Erin Martin of PopMatters {{said that}} [...] "When Love Takes Over" [...] had euphoric properties. Martin said {{the song was}} [...] "a classic, triumphant dance number, and Rowland's {{powerhouse}} vocals ensure that this song has anthemic potential for years <b>to</b> <b>come.</b> <b>This</b> song just feels good to listen to". She {{also noted that the}} song was central to the concept and [...] "love-spreading message [...] Guetta delivers on the album as a whole." [...] David Balls of Digital Spy agreed with the song's anthem credentials. [...] " [...] is further evidence that Rowland may no longer be resigned to living in Beyoncé [...] shadow. Fusing classic dance beats with a heady, emotionally charged vocal, it's a world away from the mid-tempo R numbers with which she started her solo career. In fact, this packs a punch from the very first listen, meaning it could well become one of the summer anthems of 2009." [...] However, Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times was less impressed than the other critics, simply noting the song as [...] "a cheesy synthpop makeover of Coldplay's 'Clocks'." [...] Wood did however state that it was among Guetta's best work and was an example of when the DJ is [...] "most commercial".|$|E
