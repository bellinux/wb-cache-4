40|$|Based on <b>thermal</b> <b>value</b> theory, {{the aim of}} {{this paper}} is to deduce the {{theoretical}} formulas for evaluating the energy ef-fective utilization degree in technological pyrological processes exemplified by metallurgical heating furnaces. Heat transfer models for continuous heating furnaces, batch-type heating furnaces, and regenerative heating furnaces are es-tablished, respectively. By analyzing the movement path of injected infinitesimal heat attached on steel or gas, <b>thermal</b> <b>value</b> equations of continuous, batch-type, and regenerative heating furnaces are derived. Then the influences of such factors as hot charging, gas preheating and intake time of heat on energy effective utilization degree are discussed by <b>thermal</b> <b>value</b> equations. The results show that <b>thermal</b> <b>value</b> rises with hot charging and air preheating for continuous heating furnaces, with shorter intake time when heat is attached on steel or longer intake time when heat is attached on gas for batch-type heating furnaces and that with more heat supply at early heating stage or less at late stage for regen-erative heating furnaces...|$|E

40|$|We {{perform a}} {{numerical}} study {{to recognize the}} difference between various massive potentials in the dRGT massive gravity on the holographic thermalization in the AdS and AdS Gauss-Bonnet gravities. The massive potential in $ 4 + 1 $ dimensions includes three symmetric polynomial terms which we denote them as $a_ 1 $, $a_ 2 $ and $a_ 3 $ terms. We observe, {{in the case of}} time evolution of entanglement entropy that there is a critical size of the entangling surface on the boundary below which both signs of $a_ 1 $ and above the critical size $a_ 3 $ are able to reduce the <b>thermal</b> <b>value</b> of entanglement entropy. Our numerical computations show the more positive $a_i$'s are, the faster system reaches to its <b>thermal</b> <b>value.</b> The order of saturation time of positive potentials when supplemented to AdS or AdS-GB backgrounds is as $t_{sat}(a_{ 1 }) >t_{sat}(a_{ 2 }) >t_{sat}(a_{ 3 }) $.
