25|$|Triclosan (sometimes {{abbreviated}} as TCS), {{similar in}} its uses and {{mechanism of action}} to <b>triclocarban,</b> is an antibacterial and antifungal agent found in some consumer products, including toothpaste, soaps, detergents, toys, and surgical cleaning treatments. Its efficacy as an antimicrobial agent, the risk of antimicrobial resistance, and its possible role in disrupted hormonal development remain controversial. Additional research seeks to understand its potential effects on organisms and environmental health.|$|E
25|$|In 1978 FDA {{published}} a tentative final monograph (TFM) for topical antimicrobial products. The record was re-opened in March 1979 {{to take into}} account six comments the agency received during the period for submitting objections to the TFM, including new data submitted by Procter & Gamble on the safety and effectiveness of <b>triclocarban</b> and by Ciba-Geigy on the proliferation of use of triclosan. The document states that, “significant amounts of new and previously unconsidered data were submitted with each of the above petitions.” It was re-opened again in October of that year to permit interested persons to submit further data establishing conditions for the safety, effectiveness and labeling of over-the-counter topical antimicrobial products for human use.|$|E
25|$|The {{duration}} of triclosan in personal product use is relatively short. Upon disposal, triclosan {{is sent to}} municipal sewage treatment plants, where about 97-98% of triclosan is removed. Studies show that substantial quantities of triclosan (170,000 – 970,000kg/yr) can break through wastewater treatment plants and damage algae on surface waters. In a study on effluent from wastewater treatment facilities, approximately 75% of <b>triclocarban</b> was present in sludge. This poses a potential environmental and ecological hazard, particularly for aquatic systems. The volume of triclosan re-entering the environment in sewage sludge after initial successful capture from wastewater is 44,000 ± 60,000kg/yr. Triclosan can attach to other substances suspended in aquatic environments, which potentially endangers marine organisms and may lead to further bioaccumulation. Ozone {{is considered to be}} an effective tool for removing triclosan during sewage treatment. As little triclosan is released through plastic and textile household consumer products, these are not considered to be major sources of triclosan contamination.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the year}} 2000, {{triclosan}} and <b>triclocarban</b> (TCC) {{could be found}} in 75% of liquid soaps and 29% of bar soaps, and [...] triclosan was used in more than 2,000 consumer products.|$|E
2500|$|In 1974, the US FDA {{began the}} drug review {{monograph}} process for [...] "over-the-counter (OTC) topical antimicrobial products," [...] including triclosan and <b>triclocarban.</b> The advisory panel first met on June 29, 1972, {{and the agency}} published its proposed rule on Sept 13, 1974. The initial rule applied to, “OTC products containing antimicrobial ingredients for topical human use, which includes soaps, surgical scrubs, skin washes, skin cleansers, first aid preparations and additional products defined by the panel.” The proposed rule lists dozens of products that were already on the market {{at the time and}} the firms that produced them.|$|E
2500|$|On September 6, 2016, 44 {{years after}} its initial {{proposed}} rule, FDA issued a final rule establishing that 19 active ingredients, including triclosan and <b>triclocarban,</b> used in over-the-counter (OTC) consumer antiseptic products intended for use with water (aka consumer antiseptic washes) are not {{generally recognized as safe}} and effective (GRAS/GRAE) and are misbranded, and are new drugs for which approved applications under section 505 of the FD Act are required for marketing. Companies have one year to reformulate products without these ingredients, take them off the market or submit a New Drug Application (NDA) for the products. The 19 ingredients are: ...|$|E
50|$|One {{study has}} {{investigated}} how <b>triclocarban</b> {{remains in the}} human system after using {{a bar of soap}} with traces of <b>triclocarban.</b> Analysis of urine samples from human test subjects shows that, after <b>triclocarban</b> has undergone glucuronidation, its oxidative metabolites are less readily excreted than <b>triclocarban</b> itself. This same study performed topical treatments of <b>triclocarban</b> on rats and, by analyzing urine and plasma levels, demonstrated that <b>triclocarban</b> does remain in the organism's system.|$|E
50|$|When <b>triclocarban</b> is manufactured, 139 toxic, {{carcinogenic}} byproducts, such as 4-chloroaniline and 3,4-dichloroaniline, are released. More {{of these}} carcinogens can be released upon chemical, physical and biological attack of <b>triclocarban.</b> The duration of <b>triclocarban</b> chemical in personal product use is relatively short. Upon disposal, the <b>triclocarban</b> is washed {{down the drain}} to municipal wastewater treatment plants, where about 97-98% of <b>triclocarban</b> {{is removed from the}} water.|$|E
5000|$|Spillage may {{increase}} the risk of human, ecological, and environmental exposure to <b>triclocarban.</b> Immediate removal and restraint of the spill, including <b>triclocarban</b> as dust, is urged. [...] Although <b>triclocarban</b> has few to no direct detrimental effects on health aside from allergic reactions, preventing exposure to <b>triclocarban</b> is recommended. Since <b>triclocarban</b> enters the body through pores, wearing gloves, properly washing hands, and overall proper hygiene reduces the risk of skin exposure and irritation.High concentrations of <b>triclocarban</b> dust may remain in the lungs and inhibit lung and respiratory function. For individuals with prior respiratory conditions, <b>triclocarban</b> exacerbates the severity of respiratory diseases, and proper protection is recommended as a precaution. In case of exposure to <b>triclocarban,</b> the individual is suggested to wash the area with water or to clear the respiratory pathways. In addition to its adverse effects on humans and the environment, solid <b>triclocarban</b> is a fire hazard. It is particularly combustible as dust. Contamination with other oxidizing agents may also result in combustion.|$|E
50|$|<b>Triclocarban</b> {{bioaccumulation}} {{is possible}} {{in a number of}} organisms. Earthworms are known to store this chemical in their bodies and, because of their ecological role as a food source, they have the potential to move <b>triclocarban</b> up the food chain. Microbial species found in soils also bioaccumulate <b>triclocarban.</b> However, the health of these microbes has not been found to be affected by the presence of the chemical. <b>Triclocarban</b> is rapidly accumulated in both algae and adult caged snails. Moreover, <b>triclocarban</b> is more likely than triclosan to bioaccumulate in aquatic organisms.|$|E
50|$|<b>Triclocarban</b> has {{a hazard}} {{quotient}} rating of greater than one. Hazard quotients greater than one indicate {{the potential for}} adverse effects on organisms due to toxicity. As <b>triclocarban</b> is found in high concentrations in aquatic environments, there are concerns regarding its toxicity to aquatic species. Specifically, <b>triclocarban</b> {{has been shown to}} be toxic to amphibians, fish, invertebrates, and aquatic plants, and traces of the compound have been found in Atlantic dolphins. The antibacterial components of <b>triclocarban</b> may disrupt hormones critical to the developmental and endocrine processes in exposed animal wildlife. The neurological and reproductive systems are particularly affected through contact with this compound. <b>Triclocarban</b> may also affect animal wildlife behavior. For example, triclosan and <b>triclocarban</b> are 100-1,000 times more effective in inhibiting and killing algae, crustaceans and fish than they are in killing microbes. <b>Triclocarban</b> and triclosan have been observed in multiple organisms, including algae, aquatic blackworms, fish, and dolphins.|$|E
50|$|Bioaccumulation {{does occur}} in plants treated with water {{containing}} <b>triclocarban.</b> However, {{it is estimated}} that less than 0.5% of the acceptable daily intake of <b>triclocarban</b> for humans is represented by vegetable consumption. Thus, the concentration of <b>triclocarban</b> in edible portions of plants is a negligible exposure pathway for humans.|$|E
50|$|<b>Triclocarban</b> {{has been}} used as an {{antimicrobial}} and antifungal compound since the 1960s. It is commonly found in personal care products as an antimicrobial in soaps, lotions, deodorants, toothpaste, and plastic. About 80% of all antimicrobial bar soap sold in the United States contains <b>triclocarban.</b> Additionally, the United States spends nearly 1 billion dollars annually on products containing <b>triclocarban</b> and triclosan.|$|E
50|$|The {{potential}} for <b>triclocarban</b> to bioaccumulate in plants {{has been exploited}} {{in the construction of}} wetlands meant to help remove <b>triclocarban</b> from wastewater. These constructed wetlands are considered a cost-effective treatment option for the removal of PPCPs, including <b>triclocarban</b> and triclosan, from domestic water effluent. Such compounds tend to concentrate in the roots of wetland plants. Potential ecological risks associated with this method are the decrease of root systems in wetland plants, reduced nutrient uptake, decreased competitive ability, and increased {{potential for}} uprooting. Due to these risks, the long term exposure of wetland ecosystems to wastewater containing <b>triclocarban</b> as a major solution to wastewater pollution is still under discussion.|$|E
5000|$|In {{light of}} the {{difficulties}} of finding antimicrobial alternatives, the Food and Drug Administration began in the 1970s to review the safety of <b>triclocarban</b> and triclosan, but no enacted policy, or [...] "drug monograph," [...] is available to date. Legal recourse by the Natural Resources Defense Council in 2010 forced the FDA to review <b>triclocarban</b> and triclosan. However, the United States Environmental Protection Agency maintains regulatory control over <b>triclocarban</b> and triclosan to date.|$|E
50|$|High {{concentrations}} of <b>triclocarban</b> {{may be found}} in wastewater. It is among the top ten most commonly detected organic wastewater compounds in terms of frequency and concentration. <b>Triclocarban</b> has been found in increasing concentrations {{over the past five years}} and is now more frequently detected than triclosan.|$|E
50|$|Discharge of {{effluent}} {{from these}} treatment plants {{and disposal of}} sludge on land is the primary route of environmental exposure to <b>triclocarban.</b> Research shows that <b>triclocarban</b> and triclosan have been detected in sewage effluents and sludge (biosolids) due to their incomplete removal during wastewater treatment. Due to their hydrophobic nature, significant amounts of them in wastewater streams partition into sludge, with concentrations at mg/kg levels. The volume of <b>triclocarban</b> reentering the environment in sewage sludge after initial successful capture from wastewater is s 127,000 ± 194,000 kg/yr. This is equivalent to a 4.8 - 48.2% of its total U.S consumption volume. Crops shown to take up antimicrobials from soil include barley, meadow fescue, carrots and pinto beans. Studies show that substantial quantities of <b>triclocarban</b> (227,000 - 454,000 kg/y) can break through wastewater treatment plants and damage algae on surface waters.|$|E
50|$|<b>Triclocarban</b> acts to {{effectively}} treat both initial bacterial skin and mucosal infections {{as well as}} those infections at risk for superinfection. In vitro, <b>triclocarban</b> {{has been found to be}} effective against various strains of staphylococcus, streptococcus, and enterococcus bacteria. It has been shown to be effective as an antibacterial even at very low levels. Triclocarban’s minimum inhibitory concentration has been found to range from 0.5 to 8 mg/L for these various strains. <b>Triclocarban</b> is only unquestionably bacteriostatic for gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, which suggests that the mechanism of triclocarban’s antibacterial activity is through its destabilization of bacterial cell walls.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Triclocarban</b> is {{predominantly}} active against gram positive bacteria (bacteria {{with a thick}} peptidoglycan wall). The precise mechanism of action of <b>triclocarban</b> is unknown, but it is shown to be bacteriostatic, which prevents bacterial proliferation. Unlike other antibacterial compounds, <b>triclocarban</b> does {{not interfere with the}} membrane. As a result, it is hypothesized that triclocarban’s molecular mechanism resembles that of triclosan, which inhibits bacterial fatty acid synthesis. [...] By mimicking the natural substrate of the enoyl-acyl-carrier protein reductase (ENR) enzyme, triclosan acts as a site-directed inhibitor and disrupts lipid, phospholipid, lipopolysaccharide and lipoprotein synthesis. ENR is a highly conserved enzyme of lipid biosynthetic pathways in both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria and mycobacterial species and is absent in humans.|$|E
50|$|Triclosan and <b>triclocarban</b> are {{the most}} common {{compounds}} used as antibacterials in soaps, however several other compounds are also common.|$|E
50|$|The {{specific}} {{mechanism of}} action for triclocarban's health effects on humans, like in bacteria, is unclear. Generally, <b>triclocarban</b> enhances the gene expression of other steroid hormones, including androgens, estrogens, and cortisol. It is hypothesized that the compound acts similar to cofactors or coactivators that modulate the activity of estrogen receptors and androgen receptors. Experiments show that <b>triclocarban</b> activates constitutive androstane receptor and estrogen receptor alpha both in vivo and in vitro and might {{have the potential to}} alter normal physiological homeostasis. Activation of these receptors amplifies gene expression and, in doing so, may be the mechanistic base of triclocarban's health impact on humans. However, further investigation is needed to determine whether <b>triclocarban</b> increases the activity of sex steroid hormones by binding to the receptors or by binding to and sensitizing the receptor coactivators.|$|E
50|$|Antibacterial soap {{is a type}} of {{cleaning}} product which contain chemical ingredients that purportedly assist in killing bacteria. Such chemicals frequently include triclosan, <b>triclocarban,</b> and chloroxylenol.|$|E
50|$|At lower concentrations, Triclosan and <b>Triclocarban</b> {{provide a}} {{bacteriostatic}} effect by binding to ENR. Atromentin and leucomelone possess antibacterial activity, inhibiting the enzyme in the bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae.|$|E
50|$|To make {{antibacterial}} soap, compounds such as triclosan or <b>triclocarban</b> can be added. There is {{some concern}} {{that use of}} antibacterial soaps and other products might encourage antibiotic resistance in microorganisms.|$|E
5000|$|By {{the year}} 2000, {{triclosan}} and <b>triclocarban</b> (TCC) {{could be found}} in 75% of liquid soaps and 29% of bar soaps, and [...] triclosan was used in more than 2,000 consumer products.|$|E
5000|$|While <b>triclocarban</b> causes {{endocrine}} disruption, its chemical toxicity {{with respect}} to lethality is low ( [...] >5000 mg/kg). Its rate of skin absorption is also low. Repeated low-dose exposure, however, can cause endocrine disruption over time.|$|E
5000|$|On September 2, 2016, the Food and Drug Administration {{announced}} that triclosan and <b>triclocarban</b> {{must be removed}} from all antibacterial soap products by late 2017. [...] Similar in its use and its adverse health impacts as triclosan, hexachlorophene became prohibited by the FDA.|$|E
50|$|In December 2013, the Food and Drug Administration {{required}} {{all companies}} to prove {{within the next}} year, that <b>triclocarban</b> is not harmful to consumers. In recent years, companies like Johnson & Johnson, Procter & Gamble, Colgate-Palmolive, and Avon have begun phasing out chemical use due to health concerns.|$|E
5000|$|Hexachlorophene, {{the active}} {{ingredient}} in Dial, {{was removed from the}} consumer market and strictly limited in the hospital setting in the early 1970s amid reports that it caused neurological damage in infants. When the U.S. Food and Drug Administration outlawed its use in non-medicinal products, Armour replaced it with <b>triclocarban,</b> a synthetic antibacterial compound.|$|E
50|$|Exposure {{of organisms}} like fish, algae, and humans to {{low levels of}} <b>triclocarban</b> and other {{antibacterial}} chemicals kills weak microbes and allows the stronger, resistant strains to proliferate. As microbes share genes, an increase in resistant strains increases the probability that weak microbes acquire these resistance genes. The consequence is a new colony of drug resistant microbes.|$|E
5000|$|... 3,4-Dichlorphenylisocyanate is a {{chemical}} compound used as {{a chemical}} intermediate and in organic synthesis. It is a solid, and ranges in colour from white to yellow. It is an irritant for tissues including eyes and mucous membranes, and inhalation of dust from the chemical is poisonous. [...] It can be used industrially {{in the preparation of}} <b>triclocarban</b> by reaction with p-chloroaniline.|$|E
50|$|Triclosan (sometimes {{abbreviated}} as TCS), {{similar in}} its uses and {{mechanism of action}} to <b>triclocarban,</b> is an antibacterial and antifungal agent found in some consumer products, including toothpaste, soaps, detergents, toys, and surgical cleaning treatments. Its efficacy as an antimicrobial agent, the risk of antimicrobial resistance, and its possible role in disrupted hormonal development remain controversial. Additional research seeks to understand its potential effects on organisms and environmental health.|$|E
5000|$|Studies have {{indicated}} that pharmaceuticals and personal care products, which often adsorb to sludge during wastewater treatment, can persist in agricultural soils following biosolid application. Some of these chemicals, including potential endocrine disruptor Triclosan, can also travel through the soil column and leach into agricultural tile drainage at detectable levels. [...] Other studies, however, have shown that these chemicals remain adsorbed to surface soil particles, making them more susceptible to surface erosion than infiltration. [...] These studies are also mixed in their findings regarding the persistence of chemicals such as triclosan, <b>triclocarban,</b> and other pharmaceuticals. The impact of this persistence in soils is unknown, but the link to human and land animal health is likely tied to the capacity for plants to absorb and accumulate these chemicals in their consumed tissues. Studies of this kind are in early stages, but evidence of root uptake and translocation to leaves did occur for both triclosan and <b>triclocarban</b> in soybeans. This effect was not present in corn when tested in a different study.|$|E
50|$|Cuticura soap, {{manufactured}} by the Potter Drug and Chemical company, is an antibacterial medicated soap in use since 1865. Noted Boston philanthropist George Robert White (1847-1922) {{was once the}} president and owner of Potter Drug and Chemical. Cuticura contains <b>triclocarban</b> instead of the more usual triclosan. These two antibacterial agents have very similar molecularity. By themselves they kill 99.99% of bacteria and microbes (like fungus spores) on contact. Cuticura soap has been in use, and is relatively unchanged, since 1865.|$|E
50|$|The {{future of}} <b>triclocarban</b> is unknown, but {{scientists}} {{are searching for}} more sustainable antimicrobials that maintain its antibacterial properties while being minimally toxic to the environment, humans, and wildlife. This entails low degrees of bioaccumulation and rapid, clean biodegradation in existing wastewater treatment facilities. A lowered potential or no potential for resistance is also preferable. These next generation chemicals should aim to act on {{a broad spectrum of}} microbes and pathogens while also being minimally toxic and bioaccumulating in non-target species.|$|E
