40|$|<b>The</b> <b>recording</b> <b>industry</b> {{has been}} a major focus of {{interest}} for cultural commentators throughout the twenty-first century. As the first major content industry to have its production and distribution patterns radically disturbed by <b>the</b> internet, <b>the</b> <b>recording</b> <b>industry’s</b> content, attitudes and practices have regularly been under the microscope. Much of this discussion, however, is dominated by US and UK perspectives and assumes <b>the</b> ‘the <b>recording</b> industry’ to be a relatively static, homogeneous, entity. This book attempts to offer a broader, less Anglocentric and more dynamic understanding of <b>the</b> <b>recording</b> <b>industry.</b> It starting premise is the idea that <b>the</b> <b>recording</b> <b>industry</b> is not one thing but is, rather, a series of <b>recording</b> <b>industries,</b> locally organised and locally focused, both structured by and structuring the international industry. Seven detailed case studies of different national <b>recording</b> <b>industries</b> illustrate this fact, each of them specifically chosen to provide a distinctive insight into the workings of <b>the</b> <b>recording</b> <b>industry.</b> <b>The</b> expert contributions to this book provide the reader with a sense of the history, structure and contemporary dynamics of <b>the</b> <b>recording</b> <b>industry</b> in these specific territories, and counteract the Anglo-American bias of coverage of the music <b>industry.</b> <b>The</b> International <b>Recording</b> <b>Industries</b> will be valuable to students and scholars of sociology, cultural studies, media studies, cultural economics and popular music studies...|$|R

Between 2002 and the present day, they have toured regularly either on their own or as guests at festivals. They have played at such prestigious events as V Festival, Festival Internacional de Benicàssim and to 18,000 fans at the Hollywood Bowl, Los Angeles in 2006.|$|E
25|$|By {{the early}} 1990s the British hip hop {{seemed to be}} thriving, with flourishing scenes in London, Bristol and Nottingham. British rap became more assured of its identity, abandoning American accents and {{developing}} a more distinctive sound. However, the anticipated mainstream success was not achieved, with the British hip hop scene particularly affected by <b>the</b> <b>record</b> <b>industry</b> clamping down on sampling. The result was {{the development of the}} breakbeat culture, searching out obscure recordings and the creation of original music, with bands like Stereo MCs beginning to playing instruments and sampling their own tunes. Arguably this led to a creative renaissance, with British hip hop shifting from the hardcore American template and moving into more melodic territory.|$|E
