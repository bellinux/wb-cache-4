40|$|Determining thawing {{times of}} frozen foods is a {{challenging}} problem as the thermophysical {{properties of the}} product change during thawing. A number of calculation models and solutions have been developed. The proposed solutions range from relatively simple analytical equations based {{on a number of}} assumptions to a group of empirical approaches that sometimes require complex calculations. In this paper analytical, empirical and graphical models are presented and critically reviewed. The conditions of solution, limitations and possible applications of the models are discussed. The graphical and semi-graphical models are derived from numerical methods. Using the numerical methods is not always possible as running calculations takes time, whereas the specialized software and equipment are not always cheap. For these reasons, the application of analytical-empirical models is more useful for engineering. It is demonstrated that there is no simple, accurate and feasible analytical method for <b>thawing</b> <b>time</b> prediction. Consequently, simplified methods are needed for <b>thawing</b> <b>time</b> estimation of agricultural and food products.

40|$|During the {{manufacture}} of the chemotherapeutic enzyme Erwinia chrysanthemi L- asparaginase, a small proportion (approximately 5 – 15 %) of acidic variants, including deamidated species, are observed. Although the deamidated forms appear to have similar specific activity and quaternary structure to the unmodified enzyme, monitoring and control of these forms is important from a regulatory perspective. The extent of Asn to Asp deamidation directly correlates with the <b>time</b> taken to <b>thaw</b> the Erwinia cells. Erwinia L-asparaginase is a tetrameric enzyme containing one site, Asn 281, theoretically very labile to deamidation due to the sequence Asn-Gly.

The correlation of cell <b>thaw</b> <b>time</b> with acidic species content was also confirmed using capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) and peptide mapping.

To maximize {{the efficiency of}} these techniques, methods for SSC cryopreservation {{need to be developed}} to bank SSCs for extended periods of time. Although, it has been demonstrated that SSCs can reinitiate spermatogenesis after freezing, optimal cryopreservation protocols that maximize SSC proliferative capacity post-thaw have not been identified. The objective {{of this study was to}} develop an efficient cryopreservation technique for preservation of SSCs. To identify efficient cryopreservation methods for long-term preservation of SSCs, isolated testis cells enriched for SSCs were placed in medium containing dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or DMSO and trehalose (50 mM, 100 mM, or 200 mM), and frozen in liquid nitrogen for 1 week, 1 month, or 3 months.

For this, pollen grains were maintained in four environments: refrigerator (4 ºC), freezer (- 18 ºC), ultrafreezer (- 72 ºC), and liquid nitrogen (- 196 ºC) for 60 days. To evaluate viability, in vitro germination {{was carried out in}} three tests: 15, 30, and 60 days, in which the pollens grains germinated within an hour were analyzed up to 6 h and after 24 h. In a completely randomized design, 100 pollen grains were analyzed in the 6 replications of each treatment. For the cultivar IAC 80, both after 15 and 30 days of storage in ultrafreezer, about 50 % of pollen grains germinated required from 5 h to 6 h of incubation for the resumption of metabolism, respectively. For the cultivar AL Guarany 2002, ultrafreezer presented a higher degree of technical uniformity; however, the best germination was achieved through criopreservation.

40|$|The {{enthalpy}} {{method is}} primarily developed for studying phase {{change in a}} multicomponent material, characterized by a continuous liquid volume fraction (phi(1)) vs temperature (T) relationship. Using the Galerkin finite element method we obtain solutions to the enthalpy formulation for phase change in 1 D slabs of pure material, by assuming a superficial phase change region (linear (phi(1) vs T) around the discontinuity at the melting point. Errors between the computed and analytical solutions are evaluated for the fluxes at, and positions of, the freezing front, for different widths of the superficial phase change region and spatial discretizations with linear and quadratic basis functions. For Stefan number (St) varying between 0. 1 and 10 the method is relatively insensitive to spatial discretization and widths of the superficial phase change region. Greater sensitivity is observed at St = 0. 01, where the variation in the enthalpy is large. In general {{the width of the}} superficial phase change region should span at least 2 - 3 Gauss quadrature points for the enthalpy to be computed accurately. The method is applied to study conventional melting of slabs of frozen brine and ice. Regardless of the forms for the phi(1) vs T relationships, the <b>thawing</b> <b>times</b> were found to scale as the square of the slab thickness. The ability of the method to efficiently capture multiple thawing fronts which may originate at any spatial location within the sample, is illustrated with the microwave thawing of slabs and 2 D cylinders.

ObjectiveIn this multicenter study, we evaluated {{the safety and}} efficacy of Cryo-AF using the AFA-ST vs the second-generation (Arctic Front Advance [AFA]) cryoballoon. MethodsWe examined the procedural safety and efficacy and the short- and long-term clinical outcomes associated with a first-time Cryo-AF performed in 355 consecutive patients (254 / 355 [72 %] with paroxysmal AF), using either the AFA-ST (n = 102) or the AFA (n = 253) cryoballoon catheters. ResultsAcute isolation was achieved in 99. 6 % of all pulmonary veins (PVs) (AFA-ST: 100 % vs AFA: 99. 4 %; P =. 920). Time to pulmonary vein isolation was recorded in 89. 2 % of PVs using AFA-ST vs 60. 2 % using AFA (P <. 001). PVs targeted using AFA-ST required fewer applications (1. 6 ± 0. 8 vs 1. 7 ± 0. 8; P =. 023), whereas {{there were no differences}} in the balloon nadir temperature (AFA-ST: − 47. 0 °C ± 7. 3 °C vs AFA: − 47. 5 °C ± 7. 8 °C; P =. 120) or <b>thaw</b> <b>time</b> (AFA-ST: 41 ± 24 seconds vs AFA: 44 ± 28 seconds; P =. 056). However, AFA-ST was associated with shorter left atrial dwell time (43 ± 5 minutes vs 53 ± 16 minutes; P <. 001) and procedure time (71 ± 11 minutes vs 89 ± 25 minutes; P <. 001). Furthermore, Cryo-AF using AFA-ST was completed more frequently by “single-shot” PV ablation (27. 4 % vs 20. 2 %; P =. 031). Persistent phrenic nerve palsy (AFA-ST: 0 % vs AFA: 0. 8 %; P =. 507) and procedure-related adverse events (AFA-ST: 1. 0 % vs AFA: 1. 6 %; P =. 554) were similar, as was the freedom from recurrent atrial arrhythmias at 10 months of follow-up (AFA-ST: 81. 8 % vs AFA: 79. 9 %; P =. 658). ConclusionCryo-AF using the AFA-ST cryoballoon offers an enhanced ability to assess time to pulmonary vein isolation, allowing for fewer cryoapplications and shorter left atrial dwell time and procedure time.

25|$|The Ainu usually hunted bear {{during the}} time of the spring <b>thaw.</b> At that <b>time,</b> bears were weak because they had not fed at all during long {{hibernation}}. Ainu hunters caught hibernating bears or bears that had just left hibernation dens. When they hunted bear in summer, they used a spring trap loaded with an arrow, called an amappo. The Ainu usually used arrows to hunt deer. Also, they drove deer into a river or sea and shot them with arrows. For a large catch, a whole village would drive a herd of deer off a cliff and club them to death.|$|R
50|$|The gulch {{itself was}} formed between 15,000 and 13,000 {{years ago at}} the end of the last ice age when the ice dam {{containing}} Glacial Lake Missoula <b>thawed</b> some 40 <b>times,</b> causing some of the largest floods known on earth. The flood waters spilled across Idaho and eastern Washington, surged down the Columbia River and through the Gorge, flooding the Willamette Valley as far south as Eugene. This flood covered Portland with approximately 400 ft of water, laying down large amounts of silt and gravel, creating the Alameda Ridge, as well as carving out Sullivan's Gulch.|$|R
