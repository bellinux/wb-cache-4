40|$|We are {{developing}} monolithic pixel sensors {{based on a}} 0. 2 mm fully-depleted Silicon-on-Insulator (SOI) technology. SOI sensors have properties such as high-speed operation, low-power dissipa-tion, and SEU/SET immunity. The major issues applying them in high-radiation environments are the total ionization dose (TID) effects. The effects are rather substantial in the SOI devices since the transistors are enclosed in the oxide layers where generated holes are trapped and affect {{the operation of the}} near-by transistors. Double SOI sensors that provide an independent electrode underneath the buried oxide (BOX) layer have been developed. A negative voltage applied to this electrode is expected to cancel any positive potential due to hole traps in the BOX layer.

The thermal oxidation of submicron metallic Zn particles was studied as a method to form nanostructured ZnO films. The particles used for this work were characterized by electron microscopy, x ray diffraction, and thermal analysis to evaluate the Zn-ZnO core shell structure, surface morphology, and oxidation characteristics. Significant nanostructural changes were observed for films annealed to 400 [*]°C or higher, where nanoflakes, nanoribbons, nanoneedles, and nanorods were formed as a result of stress induced fractures arising in the ZnO outer shell due to differential thermal expansion between the metallic Zn core and the ZnO shell. Mass transport occurs through these defects due to the high vapor pressure for metallic Zn at temperatures above 230 [*]°C, whereupon the Zn vapor rapidly oxidizes in air to form the ZnO nanostructures.

40|$|Conducting bridge {{random access}} memory (CBRAM) {{is one of the}} {{potential}} technologies being considered for replacement of Flash memory for non-volatile data storage. CBRAM devices operate on the principle of nucleation and rupture of metallic filaments. One key concern for commercializing this technology is the question of variability which could arise due to nucleation of multiple filaments across the device at spatially different locations. The spatial spread of the filament location may cause long tails at the low and high percentile regions for the switching parameter distribution as the new filament that nucleates may have a completely different shape and size. It is therefore essential to probe whether switching in CBRAM occurs every time at the same filament location or whether there are other new filaments that could nucleate during repeated cycling with some spatial correlation (if any) to the original filament. To investigate this issue, we make use of a metal-insulator-semiconductor (M-I-S) <b>transistor</b> <b>test</b> structure with Ni as the top electrode and HfOx/SiOx as the dielectric stack. In-situ stressing using a nano-tip on the M-I-S stack is performed and the filament is imaged in real-time using a high resolution transmission electron microscope (TEM).
