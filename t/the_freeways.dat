5|$|As <b>the</b> <b>freeways</b> in the Lansing {{area were}} {{completed}} in the 1960s through the 1980s, the highways through downtown changed designations. The section of I-96 west of Lansing opened in December 1962. In 1973, M-78 was converted to a freeway near the Flint area, and from Olivet southwest of Lansing to the new freeway, the old highway was redesignated Temporary I-69 (Temp. I-69). Additional segments of I-69 north of Lansing were finished in 1984 and 1987. I-69 was routed over I-96 and the new freeway north of Lansing, and the business loop was designated along M-43 and the former Temp. I-69 in 1987 after that second segment opened.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{completion}} of <b>the</b> <b>freeways</b> in the Port Huron area, {{the route of the}} business loop was part of US Highway25 (US25). After the freeway was completed in the area, the former route was redesignated Business US25 (Bus. US25) in 1964. The US25 designation was decommissioned in 1973, and the former Bus. US25 through the area was designated as part of an extended M-25. In 1986, the BL I-94 designation was created, and the former BS I-69 was extended with it through downtown Port Huron. At the same time, M-25 was truncated to end {{on the north side of}} Port Huron.|$|E
5|$|Beginning on February 25, 2008, I-75 closed {{completely}} to traffic {{in both directions}} from Rosa Parks Boulevard (exit49) to Clark Street (exit47) in Detroit. This facilitated the complete rebuilding of the road {{as part of the}} Ambassador Gateway Project to better connect I-75 and I-96 to the Ambassador Bridge. Through traffic on I-75 was rerouted along I-94 to I-275 and local detours were posted. The freeway reopened to traffic in June 2009, five months ahead of schedule. The overall project to realign and connect the bridge to <b>the</b> <b>freeways</b> was mired in lawsuits between MDOT and the private company that owns the bridge. The company's owner was jailed for contempt of court during court proceedings in early 2012. MDOT was later ordered to assume responsibility for construction, and the department completed the project on September 21, 2012.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>freeway's</b> {{promoted}} {{virtue of}} a speedy commute was debunked by <b>the</b> <b>freeway's</b> opponents. On one hand, {{it was seen}} as benefiting only suburban Gresham and East Multnomah County {{at the expense of}} Portland's neighborhoods. On the other hand, many opponents stated that <b>the</b> <b>freeway</b> would be obsolete the minute it opened, jamming with traffic volumes that <b>the</b> <b>freeway</b> was not designed for.|$|R

5|$|Beginning on February 25, 2008, MDOT and the Detroit International Bridge Company {{initiated}} the Ambassador Gateway Project {{at the eastern}} end of I-96. The adjacent section of I-75 closed completely to traffic in both directions to start the complete reconstruction of the road to better connect I-75 and I-96 to the Ambassador Bridge, and the plans included the reconstruction of a mile (1.6km) of I-96. That segment of I-96 closed on July 14, 2008, and it was scheduled to reopen a month early the following September. The overall project to realign ramps and connect the bridge to <b>the</b> <b>freeways</b> was mired in lawsuits between MDOT and the private company that owns the bridge. The company's owner was jailed for contempt of court during court proceedings in early 2012. MDOT was later ordered to assume responsibility for construction, and the department completed the project on September 21, 2012.|$|E
5|$|The {{first section}} of modern MD 10 to open was the portion of freeway shared with MD 100, which opened in November 1970 from MD 2 to its eastern terminus. Work began on the Arundel Expressway proper in 1970 when the {{interchange}} between the expressway and the Baltimore Beltway was started in 1970. MD 710 was relocated over much of its length {{to make way for}} the construction of <b>the</b> <b>freeways</b> in 1972. The Arundel Expressway opened from the Beltway to MD 710 in December 1972 and was marked as MD 10 by 1974. Construction on the extension south to MD 648 was underway by 1975. MD 10 opened south to MD 270 in October 1977 and to MD 648 in March 1978. The freeway was proposed to continue south to MD 100, but that freeway extension was removed from short-term plans by 1981.|$|E
5|$|The Reed City Bus. US10 {{was created}} by 1960 to follow Chestnut and Church streets into the community's central {{business}} district and through adjacent residential areas. In 1975 when US10 was rerouted to follow <b>the</b> <b>freeways</b> around Clare, the former routing through downtown on McEwan and Fifth streets was redesignated as a business loop; it was also signed to provide connections between US10 and what is now US127 because of an incomplete interchange between those two freeways. The Midland business loop dates back to 1961 and follows Eastman Avenue and two sets of one-way streets before completing its routing as a freeway. The two business loops created for Flint and Pontiac were designated in 1941 and 1961, respectively. They followed streets that were once part of US 10, but after additional changes to US10's routing in Michigan, they were renumbered as business loops of other highways in 1962 and 1986, respectively. Near Flint, part of US10 was replaced by M-54 when the US Highway was moved to a freeway, and near Pontiac it was replaced by US24 after US10 was truncated in the state.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the years}} since <b>the</b> <b>freeway's</b> construction, Seattle has made several efforts to stitch back {{together}} pedestrian routes disrupted by <b>the</b> <b>freeway,</b> achieving part of Thiry's proposed [...] "lid". The most visible of these efforts are Freeway Park (opened 1976), built as a lid over <b>the</b> <b>freeway</b> and connecting Downtown to First Hill, and the Washington State Convention and Trade Center (built 1982-1988) adjacent to Freeway Park, also bridging <b>the</b> <b>freeway.</b> <b>The</b> [...] I-5 Colonnade mountain bike park (opened 2007) uses <b>the</b> <b>freeway</b> as a roof and reconnects Eastlake to Capitol Hill.|$|R
50|$|In 1976, {{with the}} {{construction}} of what was then Interstate 80N and is now Interstate 84, the Baker-Copperfield Highway was realigned onto <b>the</b> <b>freeway</b> and <b>the</b> OR 86 designation removed from <b>the</b> <b>freeway</b> section and <b>the</b> section west of <b>the</b> <b>freeway.</b> <b>The</b> section west of I-84 was added to OR 7.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>freeway</b> was {{initially}} designated F81 {{for the whole}} stretch from Tullamarine to Flemington. <b>The</b> <b>freeway</b> was originally designated in the 1969 Melbourne Transportation Plan as <b>the</b> F14 <b>Freeway</b> corridor.|$|R
5|$|The {{first section}} of freeway was built in late 1957 or early 1958 between Evergreen Shores and M‑123 north of St. Ignace. The Mackinac Bridge was opened to traffic on November 1, 1957; a new section of freeway and an {{interchange}} connected US2 to the bridge. In 1961, another new freeway segment closed {{the gap between the}} Mackinac Bridge and Evergreen Shores sections. At the time, the I‑75 designation supplanted US27 on the bridge, and US2 was shifted to follow I‑75 along <b>the</b> <b>freeways</b> in the St. Ignace area. The former routing of US2 in downtown St. Ignace was redesignated BLI‑75. More sections of freeway were opened in 1962 immediately to the south of the newly constructed International Bridge in Sault Ste. Marie as well as between Dafter and Kinross. The last two sections opened in 1963 connected the northern end of the freeway at M‑123 to Kinross, and the section between Dafter and Sault Ste. Marie. At this time, all of US2's former routing became a county road known as Mackinac Trail (H-63).|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} {{tentative}} Interstate numbering plans, <b>the</b> <b>freeways</b> in Michigan now numbered I-96 and I-196 {{were supposed to}} be part of the I-94 corridor, and the freeway between Muskegon and Grand Rapids was to be I-94N. Later, the initial approvals by the federal government routed I-96 from Benton Harbor north to Grand Rapids and then east to Detroit, and I-196 was the spur route from Grand Rapids to Muskegon. The first segment of freeway built was a relocated section of US16 near Coopersville and Marne. The freeway opened at the end of 1957 or in early 1958, and the first markers for I-196 were erected in 1959. The full Grand Rapids–Muskegon I-196 freeway was completed and opened to traffic in December 1962, connecting to an I-96 freeway that led east toward Lansing; the US16 corridor was a continuous freeway with two different Interstate designations. Before the Grand Rapids–Benton Harbor segment was completed, the Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD), predecessor to the modern MDOT, petitioned federal highway officials to switch the Interstate designations west of Grand Rapids. Permission for this switch was granted in 1963, and the signs were changed in January 1964. Consideration was also made to name the Grand Rapids–Benton Harbor freeway I-67. The previously completed I-196 was redesignated as an extension of I-96, and the completed freeway segments southwest of Grand Rapids were redesignated I-196; I-67 was rejected by the American Association of State Highway Officials.|$|E

25|$|Motor vehicle drivers {{wishing to}} travel over great {{distances}} {{within the city}} will usually take <b>the</b> <b>freeways</b> or expressways {{in order to minimize}} travel time. When a crossing road is at the same grade as the freeway, a bridge (or, less often, an underpass) will be built for the crossing road. If the freeway is elevated, the crossing road will pass underneath it.|$|E
25|$|The program {{requires}} stalled {{vehicles to}} be towed off freeways in Houston {{as soon as}} possible. It was created to keep traffic down, as Houston has severe backups during the morning and evening rush hours. It was also meant to make <b>the</b> <b>freeways</b> safer by keeping them cleared of stalled vehicles. This program led to controversy {{when it was first}} started, however, for several reasons.|$|E
