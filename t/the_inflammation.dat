5|$|At Simpson's next race, the four-day Grand Prix d'Eibar, {{his first}} in Spain, his knee injury still bothered him. He won the second stage, but {{was forced to}} quit during the {{following}} stage. His injury had not healed, even after treatment by various specialists, but for financial reasons {{he was forced to}} enter the Tour de France with the British team. He abandoned on stage three, which started in Roubaix, struggling to pedal on the cobbles. Three months after his fall at Paris–Roubaix he saw a doctor at St. Michael's Hospital in Paris. He gave Simpson injections in his knee, which reduced <b>the</b> <b>inflammation.</b> Once healed, he competed in the road world championships in Berne, Switzerland. On the track he qualified for the individual pursuit with the fourth-fastest time, losing in the quarter-finals to Peter Post of the Netherlands. In the road race, Simpson was part of a seventeen-rider breakaway that finished together in a sprint; he crossed the line in ninth place.|$|E
5|$|Inflammation of the cervix is {{referred}} to as cervicitis. This inflammation may be of the endocervix or ectocervix. When associated with the endocervix, it is associated with a mucous vaginal discharge and the sexually transmitted infections such as chlamydia and gonorrhoea. As many as half of pregnant women having a gonorrheal infection of the cervix are asymptomatic. Other causes include overgrowth of the commensal flora of the vagina. When associated with the ectocervix, inflammation may be caused by the herpes simplex virus. Inflammation is often investigated through directly visualising the cervix using a speculum, which may appear whiteish due to exudate, and by taking a Pap smear and examining for causal bacteria. Special tests may be used to identify particular bacteria. If <b>the</b> <b>inflammation</b> is due to a bacterium, then antibiotics may be given as treatment.|$|E

5|$|Since inhibitors {{modulate}} {{the function}} of enzymes they are often used as drugs. Many such drugs are reversible competitive inhibitors that resemble the enzyme's native substrate, similar to methotrexate above; other well-known examples include statins used to treat high cholesterol, and protease inhibitors used to treat retroviral infections such as HIV. A common example of an irreversible inhibitor that {{is used as a}} drug is aspirin, which inhibits the COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes that produce <b>the</b> <b>inflammation</b> messenger prostaglandin. Other enzyme inhibitors are poisons. For example, the poison cyanide is an irreversible enzyme inhibitor that combines with the copper and iron in the active site of the enzyme cytochrome c oxidase and blocks cellular respiration.|$|E
5|$|Viruses {{may reach}} the lung {{by a number}} of {{different}} routes. Respiratory syncytial virus is typically contracted when people touch contaminated objects and then they touch their eyes or nose. Other viral infections occur when contaminated airborne droplets are inhaled through the mouth or nose. Once in the upper airway, the viruses may make their way in the lungs, where they invade the cells lining the airways, alveoli, or lung parenchyma. Some viruses such as measles and herpes simplex may reach the lungs via the blood. The invasion of the lungs may lead to varying degrees of cell death. When the immune system responds to the infection, even more lung damage may occur. Primarily white blood cells, mainly mononuclear cells, generate <b>the</b> <b>inflammation.</b> As well as damaging the lungs, many viruses simultaneously affect other organs and thus disrupt other body functions. Viruses also make the body more susceptible to bacterial infections; in this way, bacterial pneumonia can arise as a co-morbid condition.|$|E
5|$|Inflammation is {{a normal}} part of the human immune response, whereby leukocytes (white blood cells), {{including}} neutrophils (white blood cells that specialize in causing inflammation), gather, and chemokines (proteins released from certain cells, which activate or elicit a response from other cells) accumulate at any location in the body where bacterial or viral infections occur. Inflammation interferes with the activity of bacteria and viruses, and serves to clear them from the body. In DPB, bacteria such as Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa can cause the proliferation of inflammatory cells into the bronchiolar tissues. However, when neither bacteria are present with DPB, <b>the</b> <b>inflammation</b> continues for an as yet unknown reason. In either circumstance, inflammation in DPB can be so severe that nodules containing inflammatory cells form in the walls of the bronchioles. The presence of inflammation and infection in the airways also results in the production of excess mucus, which must be coughed up as sputum. The combination of inflammation, nodule development, infection, mucus, and frequent cough contributes to the breathing difficulties in DPB.|$|E

5|$|Pafase, {{also known}} as rPAF-AH, was {{developed}} to treat severe sepsis. Pafase is the recombinant form of platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH, {{also known as}} lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2), an enzyme made naturally by macrophages and found in human blood. PAF-AH inactivates platelet-activating factor, a phospholipid that {{plays a role in}} <b>the</b> <b>inflammation</b> seen in sepsis. The enzyme was discovered in the mid-1980s by graduate student Diana Stafforini and researchers Steve Prescott, Guy Zimmerman, and Tom McIntyre at the University of Utah. The gene that codes for Pafase was discovered by Icos. Early trials for sepsis showed that the drug reduced the death rate after 28days and patients were less likely to develop severe respiratory problems. Icos also tested Pafase for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In phaseII trials for ARDS, Pafase reduced the death rate after 28days and reduced the chance that the lungs of the patient would fail. However, Icos halted development in December2002 when interim data from phaseIII trials for sepsis showed that the drug did not help patients survive. Scientists at Northwestern University later studied Pafase for necrotizing enterocolitis, and there is ongoing research on the enzyme for atherosclerosis at the University of Utah.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACTAllergy has {{now become}} amongst the commonest disease {{in the world and}} the {{patients}} are increasing. There have been significant improvements in our understanding of allergic disease and its management. However there are still many unclear points in the precise mechanism of allergic diseases and therapy. Recent wide and extensive investigations suggest that the underlying mechanism of allergic disease is closely related to <b>the</b> allergic <b>inflammation.</b> <b>The</b> aim of this review is to offer a state-of-the-art description in our research concerning <b>the</b> allergic <b>inflammation</b> from <b>the</b> immunopharmacological standpoint...|$|R
50|$|Mucositis is <b>the</b> painful <b>inflammation</b> and {{ulceration}} of the mucous membranes {{lining the}} digestive tract, usually as an adverse effect of chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatment for cancer. Mucositis can occur anywhere along the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, but oral mucositis refers to <b>the</b> particular <b>inflammation</b> and ulceration {{that occurs in}} the mouth.

25|$|Inflammation of {{the colon}} is a {{characteristic}} symptom of ulcerative colitis, and {{a new series of}} drugs in development looks to disrupt <b>the</b> <b>inflammation</b> process by selectively targeting an ion channel. A crucial step involved in <b>the</b> <b>inflammation</b> signaling cascade involves an intermediate conductance calcium activated potassium channel (IK channel) known as KCa3.1; a protein coded for in the human gene KCNN4. Ongoing research seeks to prevent T-cell activation and inflammation by inhibiting the KCa3.1 channel, selectively. Since there is an upregulation of IK channel activity during T cell activation, inhibition of the KCa3.1 is able to disrupt the production of Th1 cytokines IL-2 and TNF-∝. Production of these cytokines decreases because inhibition of KCa3.1 reduces the efflux of K+, which in turn diminishes the influx of Ca2+. By lowering elevated intracellular Ca2+ in patients with ulcerative colitis, these novel drug candidates can inhibit the signaling cascade involved in <b>the</b> <b>inflammation</b> process and help relieve many of the symptoms associated with ulcerative colitis.|$|E
25|$|Tonsillitis is a sub type of pharyngitis. If <b>the</b> <b>inflammation</b> {{includes}} both the tonsils {{and other parts}} of the throat, it may be called pharyngotonsillitis. Another sub classification is nasopharyngitis (the common cold).|$|E
