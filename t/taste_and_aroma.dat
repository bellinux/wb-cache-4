50|$|Armenian cuisine is as ancient as {{the history}} of Armenia, a {{combination}} of different <b>tastes</b> <b>and</b> <b>aromas.</b> The food often has quite a distinct smell. Closely related to eastern and Mediterranean cuisine, various spices, vegetables, fish, and fruits combine to present unique dishes. Armenia is also famous for its wine and brandy. In particular, Armenian cognac is renowned worldwide (winner of several awards), and was considered by the late British Prime Minister, Sir Winston Churchill, as his favourite. It has often {{been referred to as}} the food of today.|$|R
25|$|A coffee {{percolator}} {{is a type}} of pot used to brew coffee. In {{the case}} of coffee-brewing the solvent is water, the permeable substance is the coffee grounds, and the soluble constituents are the chemical compounds that give coffee its color, <b>taste,</b> <b>and</b> <b>aroma.</b> In 1806, Benjamin Thompson Rumford invented the percolating coffee pot with a metal sieve to strain away the grounds.|$|E
25|$|Acetaldehyde is a colorless, {{volatile}} substance with a fruity smell. Although it forms naturally in some fruit, {{it can cause}} an off-taste in bottled water. Acetaldehyde forms by degradation of PET through the mishandling of the material. High temperatures (PET decomposes above 300°C or 570°F), high pressures, extruder speeds (excessive shear flow raises temperature), and long barrel residence times all contribute {{to the production of}} acetaldehyde. When acetaldehyde is produced, some of it remains dissolved in the walls of a container and then diffuses into the product stored inside, altering the <b>taste</b> <b>and</b> <b>aroma.</b> This is not such a problem for non-consumables (such as shampoo), for fruit juices (which already contain acetaldehyde), or for strong-tasting drinks like soft drinks. For bottled water, however, low acetaldehyde content is quite important, because, if nothing masks the aroma, even extremely low concentrations (10–20 parts per billion in the water) of acetaldehyde can produce an off-taste.|$|E
500|$|Oxidation / Fermentation: For teas {{that require}} oxidation, {{the leaves are}} left on their own in a {{climate-controlled}} room where they turn progressively darker. This is accompanied by agitation in some cases. In this process the chlorophyll in the leaves is enzymatically broken down, and its tannins are released or transformed. This process is {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "fermentation" [...] in the tea industry. The tea producer may choose when the oxidation should be stopped, which depends on the desired qualities in the final tea as well as the weather conditions (heat and humidity). For light oolong teas this may be anywhere from 5-40% oxidation, in darker oolong teas 60-70%, and in black teas 100% oxidation. Oxidation is highly important in the formation of many <b>taste</b> <b>and</b> <b>aroma</b> compounds, which give a tea its liquor colour, strength, and briskness. Depending on the type of tea desired, under or over-oxidation/fermentation can result in grassy flavours, or overly thick winey flavours.|$|E

5000|$|The idea of {{drinking}} whisky with food is considered outré by many, {{but there is}} a growing interest in pairing whiskies with complementary foods. [...] The Scotch whisky industry has been keen to promote this. Single malts, pot-still whiskies, bourbons, and rye whiskies offer an interesting range of <b>tastes</b> <b>and</b> <b>aromas,</b> which are just as varied as wine. Jake Wallis Simons compares whiskies in bourbon casks to white wines, due to their lighter flavor, and those in sherry casks to red wines, with their greater fruitiness. A few Scottish cook books contain reference to the use of whisky in cooking, and a few traditional Scottish recipes that use whisky exist.|$|R

500|$|Unrefined {{sea salt}} {{contains}} {{small amounts of}} magnesium and calcium halides and sulfates, traces of algal products, salt-resistant bacteria and sediment particles. The calcium and magnesium salts confer a faintly bitter overtone, and they make unrefined sea salt hygroscopic (i.e., it gradually absorbs moisture from air if stored uncovered). Algal products contribute a mildly [...] "fishy" [...] or [...] "sea-air" [...] odour, the latter from organobromine compounds. Sediments, the proportion of which varies with the source, give the salt a dull grey appearance. Since <b>taste</b> <b>and</b> <b>aroma</b> compounds are often detectable by humans in minute concentrations, sea salt may have a more complex flavor than pure sodium chloride when sprinkled on top of food. When salt is added during cooking however, these flavors would likely be overwhelmed by those of the food ingredients. The refined salt industry cites scientific studies saying that raw sea and rock salts do not contain enough iodine salts to prevent iodine deficiency diseases.|$|E
500|$|Tuber oregonense, {{commonly}} known as the Oregon white truffle, is a species of edible truffle in the genus Tuber. Described as new to science in 2010, the North American species is found on the western coast of the United States, from northern California to southern British Columbia west of the Cascade Range. A mycorrhizal fungus, it grows in a symbiotic association with Douglas fir. It overlaps in distribution with the closely related T.gibbosum, but they have different growing seasons: T.oregonense typically appears from October through March, while T.gibbosum grows from January to June. The fruit bodies of the fungus are roughly spherical to irregular in shape, and resemble small potatoes up to [...] in diameter. Inside the truffle is the gleba, which is initially white before it becomes a marbled tan color. The large, often thick-walled, and strongly ornamented spores are produced in large spherical asci. The truffle is highly prized for its <b>taste</b> <b>and</b> <b>aroma.</b> Some individuals have claimed success in cultivating the truffles in Christmas tree farms.|$|E

5000|$|Coffee cupping, {{or coffee}} tasting, is the {{practice}} of observing the <b>tastes</b> <b>and</b> <b>aromas</b> of brewed coffee. It is a professional practice but can be done informally by anyone or by professionals known as [...] "Q Graders". A standard coffee cupping procedure involves deeply sniffing the coffee, then loudly slurping the coffee so it spreads {{to the back of}} the tongue. The coffee taster attempts to measure aspects of the coffee's taste, specifically the body (the texture or mouthfeel, such as oiliness), sweetness, acidity (a sharp and tangy feeling, like when biting into an orange), flavour (the characters in the cup), and aftertaste. Since coffee beans embody telltale flavours from the region where they were grown, cuppers may attempt to identify the coffee's origin.|$|R

At higher doses, effects can include altered body image, auditory and/or visual illusions, pseudohallucinations, and ataxia from selective impairment of polysynaptic reflexes. In some cases, cannabis can lead to dissociative states such as depersonalization and derealization.|$|E

40|$|Flavour {{perception}} is determinant for {{the acceptability of}} food products by consumers. <b>Aroma</b> <b>and</b> <b>taste</b> {{play an important role}} in flavour perception and it is well known that the chemical composition of the matrix and consequently its structure influences release and perception of flavour. However, from simultaneous measurements of human perception and physical concentration in vivo, texture – <b>aroma</b> <b>and</b> texture – <b>taste</b> interactions are not always explained by physico-chemical mechanisms. Moreover aroma – taste interactions have been the subject of many studies already reviewed and are mainly explained by cognitive interactions even if in some case physicochemical mechanisms may occur.

The aim of this review is to focus on the impact of <b>aroma,</b> <b>taste</b> <b>and</b> texture interactions on flavour perception. For each type of binary interactions (texture – aroma, aroma – texture, texture – taste, taste – texture, <b>taste</b> – <b>aroma</b> <b>and</b> <b>aroma</b> – <b>taste)</b> we will present a short state of the art and the mechanisms that could be involved in the interactions: physico-chemical and cognitive mechanisms. The mechanisms of <b>aroma</b> – <b>taste</b> <b>and</b> <b>taste</b> – <b>aroma</b> interactions are known to mainly depend on learning association.
