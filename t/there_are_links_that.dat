30|$|In {{distributed}} diffusion strategies [2, 10], {{the neighbors}} for each node are fixed and the combining coefficients are calculated after the network topology is deployed and starts its operation. One potential risk {{of this approach}} is that the estimation procedure may be affected by poorly performing links. More specifically, the fixed neighbors and the pre-calculated combining coefficients may not provide an optimized estimation performance for each specified node because <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>links</b> <b>that</b> are more severely affected by noise or fading. Moreover, when the number of neighbor nodes is large, each node requires a large bandwidth and transmit power. In [12, 13], the idea of partial diffusion was introduced for reducing communications between neighbor nodes. Prior work on topology design and adjustment techniques includes the studies in [14 – 16] and [17], which are not dynamic {{in the sense that they}} cannot track changes in the network and mitigate the effects of poor links.|$|E

30|$|The TUC {{strategy}} was developed aiming at coordinated traffic-responsive signal control in large-scale urban networks, and has demonstrated high efficiency especially under saturated traffic conditions [16]. TUC adopts one common cycle {{time for all}} network junctions at any time, which is computed considering {{the needs of the}} currently most loaded junctions in the network. In cases of large-scale networks, where regions exist with distinct traffic loads, TUC can be applied to each region separately; in which case, each region may have its own adaptive cycle time. Even in this case, however, <b>there</b> may <b>be</b> <b>links</b> <b>that</b> feature lower and strongly varying demands, which may lead to waste of green time, especially during off-peak periods.

40|$|Abstract. We see {{the local}} content from peers {{organized}} in directories (i. e., on local ordered lists) of local representations of entities {{from the real}} world (e. g., persons, locations, events).

50|$|Research {{shows that}} gender does play an {{important}} role in Behavioral Mimicry.

Deceptive mimicry in gender identity seen in humans’ masquerades and camouflages in the nonverbal behaviors. The Optimal Distinctiveness Theory (ODT) hypothesizes that people are in a continual quest to balance the need for distinctiveness (seeing them differently) or assimilation (seeing themselves similar to others) and this is a direct lead to mimicry. Chartrand’s and Bargh (1999) have coined the phrase “The Chameleon Effect” to describe the non-conscious behavioral mimicry of individuals modulating their own behavior to blend in with a current environment.|$|R
