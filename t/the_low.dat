5|$|A barrier jet in <b>the</b> <b>low</b> levels forms just {{upstream}} {{of mountain}} chains, with the mountains forcing the jet to be oriented {{parallel to the}} mountains. The mountain barrier increases the strength of <b>the</b> <b>low</b> level wind by 45 percent. In the North American Great Plains a southerly low-level jet helps fuel overnight thunderstorm activity during the warm season, normally {{in the form of}} mesoscale convective systems which form during the overnight hours. A similar phenomenon develops across Australia, which pulls moisture poleward from the Coral Sea towards cut-off lows which form mainly across southwestern portions of the continent.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} strong low {{pressure}} systems formed across the southern Great Plains on February 4, contributing to record warmth on February 4 and 5 {{in the southern}} Plains and lower Mississippi River Valley. High temperatures across many areas reached the 70s°F (21–26°C), and in Alabama temperatures reached <b>the</b> <b>low</b> 80s°F (27°C) with dew points in the middle 60s° (17–20°C).

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{exited the}} western coast of Africa on September26, quickly spawning {{an area of}} low pressure. Upon the formation of <b>the</b> <b>low,</b> the wave split into two pieces and a second {{area of low pressure}} developed along the southern portion of the wave as it traveled west. The northern low quickly developed, spawning Tropical Depression Fourteen on September28. The southern low attached to the wave failed to develop and moved away from the intensifying tropical depression. It continued through the Atlantic, entering the Pacific Ocean, after crossing Central America, on October8. A broad area of low pressure accompanied by showers and thunderstorms developed along the wave around 275miles (440kilometres) south of Acapulco, Mexico. However, <b>the</b> <b>low</b> remained disorganized because of strong upper-level winds. On October13, <b>the</b> <b>low</b> became better organized due to a relaxation in the shear. <b>The</b> <b>low</b> developed enough convection late on October14 to be declared Tropical Depression Fifteen-E while located about 435mi (705km) southwest of Colima, Mexico.|$|E

5|$|After {{becoming}} an extratropical low, {{the remnants of}} Ivan turned to the southeast and emerged into the Atlantic Ocean, due to the building of an upper-level ridge to its east. As an extratropical cyclone, Ivan remained identifiable in both surface and upper-level data, and the system turned south and southwestward over the subsequent days. By September 20, the system was located off {{the east coast of}} Florida, producing scattered thunderstorms; unfavorable wind shear prevented tropical redevelopment, though forecasters indicated the possibility for more favorable conditions a few days later. On September 21 <b>the</b> <b>low</b> crossed southern Florida and emerged into the Gulf of Mexico, and as it moved across the warm waters of the region <b>the</b> <b>low</b> began to re-acquire tropical characteristics; the low-level circulation became increasingly better defined, and convection redeveloped over the center. Based on reports from Hurricane Hunters, it is estimated <b>the</b> <b>low</b> redeveloped into Tropical Depression Ivan late on September 22 while located about 175miles (280km) south-southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River.|$|E
5|$|Alloys of zinc {{with small}} amounts of copper, aluminium, and {{magnesium}} are useful in die casting as well as spin casting, especially in the automotive, electrical, and hardware industries. These alloys are marketed under the name Zamak. An {{example of this is}} zinc aluminium. <b>The</b> <b>low</b> melting point together with <b>the</b> <b>low</b> viscosity of the alloy makes possible the production of small and intricate shapes. <b>The</b> <b>low</b> working temperature leads to rapid cooling of the cast products and fast production for assembly. Another alloy, marketed under the brand name Prestal, contains 78% zinc and 22% aluminium, and is reported to be nearly as strong as steel but as malleable as plastic. This superplasticity of the alloy allows it to be molded using die casts made of ceramics and cement.|$|E

5|$|During mid-May, {{a frontal}} {{boundary}} stalled near The Bahamas and slowly degenerated. On May25, a shortwave trough caused the northern {{portion of the}} system to move north of the Bahamas. The following day, an {{area of low pressure}} developed along the boundary about 290miles (465km) south-southwest of Wilmington, North Carolina. Tracking towards the north, the system became increasingly organized. On May27, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began issuing Tropical Weather Outlooks for <b>the</b> <b>low</b> while it was located about 120miles (195km) south of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina.

5|$|However, {{the remnant}} low {{associated}} with Josephine {{began to show}} signs of redevelopment during the afternoon on September7.

Convection around the remnant low was torn away and <b>the</b> <b>low</b> was exposed once more. The National Hurricane Center did not state the chance of regeneration once <b>the</b> <b>low</b> became exposed. Finally, on September 9, wind shear and dry air led to the remnants of Josephine deteriorating into an open wave. However, on September10, the remnants of Josephine redeveloped and global models picked up on the reformed system. Once more, the chance of regeneration was possible as the remnants of Josephine headed towards the Bahamas. However, on September14, dry air and wind shear caused the remnants to dissipate entirely.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Ida {{originated}} from a weak tropical wave that reached the western Caribbean on November1, 2009. By November2, the system spawned {{an area of}} low pressure north of Panama which moved very little over the following days. <b>The</b> <b>low</b> became increasingly organized within a favorable environment that allowed deep convection to develop. By November4, <b>the</b> <b>low</b> had become sufficiently organized for the National Hurricane Center (NHC) to classify it as Tropical Depression Eleven. At this time, the tropical depression was situated just southwest of San Andrés Island. Convective banding features became increasingly defined throughout the day, and six hours after becoming a tropical depression, the system intensified into Tropical Storm Ida.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Kyle {{began as}} a weak area of low {{pressure}} associated with a tropical wave that moved off the west coast of Africa on September12. The system tracked in a general westward direction with little convective development and tracked over the Leeward Islands on September18. An upper-level trough situated over the eastern Caribbean Sea interacted with the wave, resulting in an increase in shower and thunderstorm activity. The following day, a larger surface circulation developed as <b>the</b> <b>low</b> moved towards the northwest. The wave later became separated from <b>the</b> <b>low,</b> with the wave continuing towards the west and <b>the</b> <b>low</b> tracking to the northwest. The National Hurricane Center (NHC), at this time, were not anticipating significant development of <b>the</b> <b>low</b> as strong wind shear inhibited deep convection from forming. Around 1400UTC on September21, a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) was issued for the system as convection developed around the center of circulation.|$|E
