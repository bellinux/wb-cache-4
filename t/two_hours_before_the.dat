5|$|The {{show was}} {{produced}} during the 2010 NRL season (corresponding to {{winter in the}} Southern Hemisphere). In New South Wales and Queensland, (in which NRL is the dominant football code), The Matty Johns Show was broadcast on Thursdays at 7.30pm, <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> <b>before</b> <b>The</b> Footy Show. In all other states (in which the Australian Football League predominates), The Matty Johns Show may have been broadcast Thursdays at 7.30pm, or broadcast around midnight, after The AFL Footy Show. When broadcast at 7.30pm, the show followed long-running soap opera Home and Away.|$|E
5|$|<b>Two</b> <b>hours</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> {{premiere of}} Aladdin—on Christmas Eve 1960—Formby {{received}} a phone call from Beryl's doctor, saying that she was in a coma and was not expected to survive the night; Formby went through with the performance, and was told early the next morning that Beryl had died. Her cremation took place on 27 December, and an hour after the service Formby returned to Bristol to appear in that day's matinee performance of Aladdin. He continued in the show until 14 January when a cold forced him to rest, on doctors' advice. He returned to Lytham St Annes and communicated with Pat Howson; she contacted his doctor and Formby was instructed to go to hospital, where he remained for the next two weeks.|$|E
5|$|Bombing of Normandy began {{around midnight}} with over 2,200 British and American bombers attacking targets {{along the coast}} and further inland. Some 1,200 {{aircraft}} departed England just before midnight to transport the airborne divisions to their drop zones behind enemy lines. Paratroops from 101st Airborne were dropped beginning around 01:30, tasked with controlling the causeways behind Utah and destroying road and rail bridges over the Douve. Gathering together into fighting units was made difficult by a shortage of radios and by the bocage terrain, with its hedgerows, stone walls, and marshes. Troops of the 82nd Airborne began arriving around 02:30, with the primary objective of destroying two additional bridges over the Douve and capturing intact two bridges over the Merderet. They quickly captured the important crossroads at Sainte-Mère-Église (the first town liberated in the invasion) and began working to protect the western flank. Generalleutnant Wilhelm Falley, commander of 91st Infantry Division, was trying {{to return to his}} headquarters near Picauville from war games at Rennes when he was killed by a paratrooper patrol. <b>Two</b> <b>hours</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> main invasion force landed, a raiding party of 132 members of 4th Cavalry Regiment swam ashore at 04:30 at Îles Saint-Marcouf, thought to be a German observation post. It was unoccupied, but two men were killed and seventeen wounded by mines and German artillery fire.|$|E

50|$|With {{less than}} <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> left <b>before</b> <b>the</b> {{mandate of the}} African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID) expired, the Security Council {{extended}} its mandate for a further 12 months this evening following extended consultations.|$|R
5|$|For {{the second}} {{consecutive}} race, the fastest driver in qualifying did not start the race from pole. Michael Schumacher set the fastest time, but a five-place grid penalty left him sixth overall. <b>Two</b> <b>hours</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> race, protests against parts introduced onto {{the floor of the}} Red Bull RB8 left team principal Christian Horner with a choice: to change the offending parts and start both cars from the pit lane, guaranteeing that any result the team recorded would be preserved; or to leave the parts on the car, allowing both drivers to start the race from the positions they qualified in, but risking a post-race exclusion. Horner ultimately chose the latter option, and Mark Webber started from pole, establishing an early lead over Nico Rosberg as a first-corner accident eliminated four cars. The race was run under the constant threat of rain, with drivers trying to extend the life of their tyres to avoid being forced to make an additional stop and falling down the order. The rain never materialised, though Jean-Éric Vergne was observed using a set of intermediate tyres late in the race. The variety of strategies used by the front-runners resulted in the last ten laps being contested with the top six cars running nose-to-tail. Webber visibly faded in the final laps, but held on when the following cars were momentarily pinned behind the slow-moving Heikki Kovalainen. Webber won the race – his second on the streets of Monaco – with Rosberg second and Fernando Alonso third, the result giving Alonso a three-point lead in the championship. Red Bull Racing maintained their lead in the Constructors' Championship as rival teams chose not to follow through on the threat of their pre-race protest, while Kovalainen finished thirteenth to see Caterham overtake Marussia for tenth place. Elsewhere, Spanish Grand Prix winner Pastor Maldonado was given a ten-place grid penalty for an incident that saw him clip Sergio Pérez. Combined with a five-place penalty for changing his gearbox, Maldonado started from the back row of the grid where he was eliminated in the first-corner accident.|$|E
25|$|As {{required}} by Israel's , Netanyahu informed Rivlin {{that he had}} succeeded in forming a coalition just <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> deadline. The government {{was approved by the}} plenum of the Knesset on May 14, after a stormy debate, by a vote of 61-59.|$|E
25|$|The {{court case}} {{was held on}} 18 May 2005.

25|$|<b>Two</b> <b>hours</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> race, {{drivers and}} crew chiefs attend a {{mandatory}} driver's meeting. Failure {{to attend the}} meeting will force drivers {{to start at the}} rear of the field. In August 2015, NASCAR announced they would experiment moving the driver's meeting to only one hour before the race since meetings at most races take less than 15 minutes.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the automated scoreboards, which now include a new high-definition video board by Mitsubishi, the park has enormous, manually operated boards on the right field wall, which display the scores of Major League games played elsewhere. These manual scoreboards are operated by three employees, whose work on game days starts at least <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> first pitch.|$|E

25|$|The {{procession}} {{sets off}} <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> start and then regroups to precede the riders by {{an hour and}} a half. It spreads 20–25km and takes 40 minutes to pass at between 20 and 60km/h. Vehicles travel in groups of five. Their position is logged by GPS and from an aircraft and organised on the road by the caravan director—Jean-Pierre Lachaud—an assistant, three motorcyclists, two radio technicians and a breakdown and medical crew. Six motorcyclists from the Garde Républicaine, the élite of the gendarmerie, ride with them.|$|E
25|$|The Copenhagen Squatters Movement first {{appeared}} as a political force {{when a group of}} young people moved in and took over an abandoned bread factory in Nørrebro. They demanded that the city council give them a house where the young people of Copenhagen could gather without charge. Furthermore, the house had to be completely self-organized and {{under the control of the}} youths, without the city council having any influence on the day-to-day running of the house. The action lasted only <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> police moved in and cleared the factory.|$|E
25|$|Hübner {{then tried}} Maj. Scheller and after him Lt. Karl Heinz Peters. Scheller had only arrived at 11:15 AM, <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> Americans {{attacked}} the bridge. Peters was a passerby {{trying to get}} his experimental anti-aircraft system back across the Rhine. But the outcome of the trial was predetermined. Scheller was convicted of failing to blow the bridge up and Peters of allowing his secret anti-aircraft weapon to fall into American hands. The men were executed the next day with a shot {{to the back of the}} neck in Rimbac and buried where they fell in shallow graves.|$|E

50|$|The {{handover}} {{occurred on}} schedule, although officers aboard Childers {{were concerned that}} this was occurring almost <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> <b>before</b> sunrise. <b>The</b> replacement boarding party reached SIEV 36 at 06:15, and by 07:10, the towline to Albany had been dropped, and the vessel was following Childers under its own power. Although {{the leader of the}} new boarding party had been informed that there was an interpreter aboard, he did not use the man to relay directions or explain actions.|$|R
