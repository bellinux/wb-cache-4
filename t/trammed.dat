50|$|On a <b>Trammed</b> Canvas {{the design}} is professionally {{stitched}} onto the canvas by hand using horizontal stitches of varying lengths of wool of the appropriate colours. The canvas is usually sold together with the wool required to stitch the <b>trammed</b> area. The stitcher then uses tent stitch over the horizontal lines with the tramme stitches acting as an accurate guide as to the colour and number of stitches required. This technique is particularly suited to designs with a large area of mono-colour background as such areas do not require tramming, reducing {{the cost of the}} canvas and allowing the stitcher to choose the background colour themselves. The Portuguese island of Madeira is the historic centre for the manufacture of <b>trammed</b> canvases.|$|E

50|$|In 1898, Green built a grander Mediterranean style {{hotel on}} the {{opposite}} side of Raymond. The first became referred to as the annex, and the second became the winter home for some of the most prominent industrial magnates in the Eastern United States. The two buildings were connected by a bridge across Raymond, and a tunnel under it. Guests arriving by train would pass through the annex, to the second floor, and be <b>trammed</b> across the bridge. In the main residence they would retire to their suites, and the luggage would follow via the tunnel. Many of the servants and attendants of the guests were forced to find accommodation in the adjacent buildings. In 1902 a new wing of the hotel was built along Kansas (now Green Street) to the P. G. Wooster Block, home of Throop University, (forerunner to Caltech).|$|E
50|$|Number of {{shuttle car}} loads {{is defined as}} the total number of fully loaded shuttle cars that were loaded at the {{continuous}} miner and subsequently tipped at the feeder breaker.Average shuttle car load time refers to the average time in seconds that was necessary to load a shuttle car to its maximum coal-carrying capacity.Average shuttle car change time refers to the average time in seconds that was necessary for an unloaded shuttle car to be repositioned behind the continuous miner after the previously loaded shuttle car <b>trammed</b> away from the machine towards the tipping point.Conveyor on time refers to the total time in minutes that the flight chain conveyor on the continuous miner was running.Cutter ON - Conveyor OFF - bunker operation min- bunker operation refers to the total time in minutes that ONLY the cutterhead was running and coal was being stored on the spade.Shuttle car away time refers to the total time in minutes that was utilised by a loaded shuttle car to travel from the continuous miner to the feeder breaker, tip the loaded coal and travel back to the continuous miner to be loaded again.Cutter operation time refers to the total time in minutes that the cutterhead was running.Relocation time refers to the total time in minutes that was utilised in order to relocate a continuous miner to a different heading after the maximum allowable unsupported length of the previously cut heading was reached.Utilisation of the modified cutting cycle has improved the general consistency of the production machines in achieving the target values of the key performance indicators. This is confirmed by means of continuous production reporting that monitors and documents the key performance indicators on a shift basis. The following table shows an example of a typical summary of key performance indicators and the actual numbers achieved. It is illustrative of the success with which the bi-directional cutting cycle is being run at a South African coal mine.|$|E

40|$|Proton {{exchange}} membrane {{fuel cells}} have shown great promise for powering <b>trams.</b> Hydrogen refueling stations and a fuel-cell system incur initial vehicle costs that {{are higher than}} a pantograph/catenary <b>tram</b> or contact-rail <b>tram.</b> In this paper, a life-cycle cost analysis is conducted for five trams: a pantograph/catenary <b>tram,</b> a contact-rail <b>tram,</b> and three fuel-cell hybrid <b>trams.</b> Characteristics of fuel-cell hybrid <b>trams</b> are compared with contemporary transit systems. A simplified life-cycle cost model, including costs for the initial infrastructure and powertrains, daily operation and power plant replacement, is proposed and calculated with parameters. A sensitivity analysis is also performed. Results show that the life-cycle costs of <b>trams</b> are almost proportional to the rail-line length. The initial costs of a fuel-cell hybrid <b>tram</b> are less than a pantograph/catenary <b>tram</b> or contact-rail <b>tram.</b> The life-cycle costs of fuel-cell hybrid <b>trams</b> are highly dependent on combination factors of hydrogen price, fuel-cell price and battery price. Charging facilities for fuel-cell hybrid <b>trams</b> are favorable when hydrogen price is in a high level. Greenhouse gas emissions of <b>trams</b> are almost equivalent...|$|R
50|$|<b>Trams</b> {{coming to}} a sudden stop may cause {{injuries}} to passengers on board. Passengers may also slip, trip or fall on the <b>tram</b> or the <b>tram</b> platform.

In areas of overcrowded <b>tram</b> systems, illegal passengers {{are in danger of}} falling off or being trapped between <b>tram</b> cars. Fire aboard a <b>tram</b> puts passengers at risk of severe injury or death.Other accidents involving passengers may include being struck by a car while exiting the <b>tram</b> or while waiting at a <b>tram</b> platform.
