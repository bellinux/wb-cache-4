It has also been argued that Yelovichnus and similar organisms are xenophyophores, large but single-cellular organisms that exist today in the abyssal zone. Due to similar structures found in their fossils, it is theorized that Yelovichnus may be related to Palaeopascichnus, as well as Aspidella and Neonereites. The main difference between Yelovichnus and Palaeopasicichnus is the shape of their segments: the segments of Yelovichnus took the shape of [...] "closed, ovate-shaped loops", whereas the segments of Palaeopascichnus were quite varied in shape.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Melanic and non-melanic {{mountain}} stone weta Hemideina maori (Orthoptera: Anostostomatidae) {{from the}} Rock and Pillar Range exhibit differential rates of melanotic encapsulation, {{a response to}} the presence of pathogens within the body. Because pathogens normally enter the body via food contamination, we hypothesised that dietary differences between the colour morphs might exist. We used faecal pellet analysis to determine the diet of the mountain stone weta. We then tested for differences between the two colour morphs in overall diet composition and the proportional contribution of invertebrate fragments to faecal pellets. The number of invertebrate fragments to the diet did not differ between the two colour morphs. Only when the plant species that were eaten infrequently were given greater weight in an Analysis of Similarity (ANSOM) did significant differences emerge in the diet of the two colour morphs. Hence, there was a weak but significant difference in the overall composition of their diets, but the ecological significance of this difference is unclear. Experimental studies could be used to determine if the dietary differences shown reflect <b>true</b> <b>feeding</b> preferences, or were due to small-scale differences in food availability or stochastic variation. ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Key words: dietary analysis; cuticle colouration; colour morphs; wetas...|$|R

40|$|Trophic cascades in {{the marine}} pelagic food web, {{especially}} in the microbial food web in which copepods are the top controllers, are difficult to quantify and are generally overlooked. In this study, we simulated a simple pelagic food web in laboratory feeding experiments to demonstrate the trophic interactions among copepods, heterotrophic dinoflagellates and chain-forming diatoms and to quantify the trophic cascade effect and the <b>true</b> <b>feeding</b> rate of copepods. Results from the study showed that heterotrophic dinoflagellates {{play a central role}} in the lower trophic level of the marine food web by consuming diatoms and by serving as a quality food source for copepods, especially during the period of diatom blooms. Copepod omnivory was mediated by the concentration of diatoms, with the highest ingestion of diatoms occurring at intermediate diatom abundances and the selectivity toward dinoflagellates increasing as the diatom concentration increased. The trophic cascade was surprisingly low and even negative in treatments with low diatom concentrations, suggesting a competition effect when there was not enough diatom food. In this situation, the omnivorous copepods together with heterotrophic dinoflagellates exhibited strong herbivory and were able to control diatoms. In contrast, a high trophic cascade effect occurred at high diatom concentrations in which copepods had a high ingestion of heterotrophic dinoflagellates. We conclude that the role of copepods in the food web structure is mediated by the concentrations of diatoms, but one of the most important biological factors that determine the strength of trophic cascades is the ingestion rates of both copepods and heterotrophic dinoflagellates.

The same nervous excitability which rendered him so active in his person, {{made it difficult to}} repress his feelings, and the words were scarcely past the lips of the speaker than the tomahawk left the hand of the Indian. Nor was it cast without ill-will, and a fierce determination to slay. Had the intention been less deadly, the danger might have been greater. The aim was uncertain, and the weapon glanced near the cheek of the captive, slightly cutting the shoulder in its evolutions. This was the first instance in which any other object than that of terrifying the prisoner, and of displaying skill had been manifested, and the Bounding Boy was immediately led from the arena, and was warmly rebuked for his intemperate haste, which had come so near defeating all the hopes of the band. To this irritable person succeeded several other young warriors, who not only hurled the tomahawk, but who cast the knife, a far more dangerous experiment, with reckless indifference; yet they always manifested a skill that prevented any injury to the captive. Several times Deerslayer was grazed, but in no instance did he receive what might be termed a wound.

40|$|Thus for {{experiments}} on the artificial rearing of <b>true</b> leaf <b>feeding</b> insects, such as Agrotis and Prodenia, on a totally synthetic media {{were not so}} numerous as those of insects boring into leaves and stems.

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{properly}} assess and accurately phenotype <b>true</b> differences in <b>feed</b> efficiency among dairy cows {{is key to}} the development of breeding programs for improving feed efficiency. The variability among individuals in feed efficiency is commonly characterised by the residual intake approach. Residual feed intake is represented by the residuals of a linear regression of intake on the corresponding quantities of the biological functions that consume (or release) energy. However, the residuals include both, model fitting and measurement errors as well as any variability in cow efficiency. The objective {{of this study was to}} isolate the individual animal variability in feed efficiency from the residual component. Two separate models were fitted, in one the standard residual energy intake (REI) was calculated as the residual of a multiple linear regression of lactation average net energy intake (NEI) on lactation average milk energy output, average metabolic BW, as well as lactation loss and gain of body condition score. In the other, a linear mixed model was used to simultaneously fit fixed linear regressions and random cow levels on the biological traits and intercept using fortnight repeated measures for the variables. This method split the predicted NEI in two parts: one quantifying the population mean intercept and coefficients, and one quantifying cow-specific deviations in the intercept and coefficients. The cow-specific part of predicted NEI was assumed to isolate <b>true</b> differences in <b>feed</b> efficiency among cows. NEI and associated energy expenditure phenotypes were available for the first 17 fortnights of lactation from 119 Holstein cows; all fed a constant energy-rich diet. Mixed models fitting cow-specific intercept and coefficients to different combinations of the aforementioned energy expenditure traits, calculated on a fortnightly basis, were compared. The variance of REI estimated with the lactation average model represented only 8 % of the variance of measured NEI. Among all compared mixed models, the variance of the cow-specific part of predicted NEI represented between 53 % and 59 % of the variance of REI estimated from the lactation average model or between 4 % and 5 % of the variance of measured NEI. The remaining 41 % to 47 % of the variance of REI estimated with the lactation average model may therefore reflect model fitting errors or measurement errors. In conclusion, the use of a mixed model framework with cow-specific random regressions seems to be a promising method to isolate the cow-specific component of REI in dairy cows...|$|R

[...] Humboldt State University, Fisheries, 1970 During 1960 - 1964 930 salmon stomachs were {{collected}} at King Salmon (Humboldt Bay) and Trinidad {{for the purpose}} of comparing the feeding behavior of salmon in these two closely adjoining areas of the Pacific Ocean. For the study period anchovies, euphausiids, herring, osmerids and rockfish comprised 95. 1 percent of the total food consumed by volume off Trinidad Head and 90. 4 percent off Humboldt Bay. Annual changes took place in the animal communities inhabiting the area off Humboldt Bay and Trinidad Head. The dominant food item off Humboldt Bay was anchovies in 1960, euphausiids in 1961, and herring in 1964. The major food item off Trinidad Head was anchovies in 1960, euphausiids in 1961, crab megalops in 1962, osmerids in 1963, and rockfish in 1964. The results indicate a high degree of consistency in the diet of salmon from both areas and lend support to the possibilities of this technique for sampling those organisms on which the salmon <b>feeds.</b> However, the <b>true</b> extent of <b>feeding</b> selectivity of salmon cannot be understood until there is a more comprehensive understanding of plankton populations...|$|R
