5|$|Markov {{processes}} are stochastic processes, traditionally in discrete or continuous time, {{that have the}} Markov property, which means the next value of the Markov process depends on the current value, but it is conditionally independent of the previous values of the stochastic process.

5|$|The {{concept and}} origin of Burnt Norton is {{connected}} to Eliot's play Murder in the Cathedral. The poem discusses the idea {{of time and the}} concept that only the present moment really matters because the past cannot be changed and <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>is</b> unknown.|$|E
5|$|Estimates of {{how long}} Surtsey will survive {{are based on the}} rate of erosion seen up to the present day. Assuming that the current rate does not change, the island will be mostly at or below sea level by 2100. However, the rate of erosion is likely to slow as the tougher core of the island is exposed: an {{assessment}} assuming that the rate of erosion will slow exponentially suggests that the island will survive for many centuries. An idea of what it will look like in <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>is</b> given by the other small islands in the Vestmannaeyjar archipelago, which formed {{in the same way as}} Surtsey several thousand years ago, and have eroded away substantially since they were formed.|$|E

Cecilia Tan has the record for most nominations without winning, having been a finalist three times for editing anthologies. The most recent winners of the award are an anthology of LGBT themed science fiction entitled <b>The</b> <b>Future</b> <b>Is</b> Queer, edited by Richard Labonté and Lawrence Schimel, the television series Torchwood, created by Russell T Davies, and the film V for Vendetta, all in 2007.

5|$|After {{exploring}} Daybreak Town and defeating several Heartless, {{the player}} is approached by the Foreteller, who tells them that defeating weaker Heartless {{is possible to}} do alone, but they will need others help to defeat more powerful opponents. The Foreteller also describes how many others are collecting light as well, though some may secretly be doing so to gain power instead of fighting the darkness, and the player must decide who to trust. Chirithy then encourages the player to explore other worlds and help rid them of the Heartless {{before it is too}} late. The player then visits the illusion future visions of Disney worlds, where they interact with the locals and help defeat the hordes of Heartless. The player is brought to each world under Chirithy's direction, and together the two search for the origin of the darkness. As the player succeeds in defeating the forces of evil, Chirithy begins to reveal the full extent of his knowledge regarding the war between light and darkness. Chirithy remembers being born in a place of light, with his creator smiling upon him in the beginning. The creator would later vanish, but before doing so he renamed six of his followers and gave five of them a prophecy of the future. The five, later known as the Foretellers, were shocked to discover that the future ended with a great battle in which the light would be defeated and the eternal reign of darkness would begin. To save the future, the Foretellers began to use the hidden powers within the written copy of the prophecy known as the Book of Prophecies (which creates the future worlds that the players travel to). Through this book, the Foretellers projected the future into their era to grow more powerful and save the light from final defeat. The power retrieved from <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>is</b> manifested as the Cards the player gathers to grow stronger.|$|E
5|$|Peter Ackroyd {{believes}} {{that it is impossible}} to paraphrase the content of the poem; the poem is too abstract to describe the events and the action that make up the poem's narrative structure. However, the philosophical basis for the poem can be explained since the discourse on time is connected to the ideas within St. Augustine's Confessions. As such, there is an emphasis on the present moment as being the only time period that really matters, because the past cannot be changed and <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>is</b> unknown. The poem emphasizes that memory must be abandoned to understand the current world, and humans must realize that the universe is based on order. The poem also describes that although consciousness cannot be bound within time, humans cannot actually escape from time on their own. The scene beneath London is filled with the time-bound people who are similar to the spiritually empty populace of The Hollow Men; they are empty because they do not understand the Logos or the order of the universe. The conclusion of the poem emphasizes that God is the only one that is truly able to exist out of time and have knowledge of all times and places, but humankind is still capable of redemption through belief in Him and His ability to save them from the bounds of the material universe.|$|E

5|$|Some time later, Suzuha appears before Rintarō, having {{arrived in}} a time machine from the future. She tells Rintarō {{that the only way}} to prevent World War III in <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>is</b> to prevent Kurisu's death at the hands of her father, Dr. Nakabachi, who stole her time travel theory to publish it under his own name. However, this {{operation}} ends in a disaster as Rintarō ends up killing Kurisu himself by mistake. After this failure, Rintarō receives a message from his future self, telling him that the way to save Kurisu without altering the events that led to him developing a time machine is to fool his past self into believing Kurisu had been killed and thus achieving the final divergence value of 1.048596%, which he dubs the 'Steins Gate'. Returning to the past again, Rintarō puts his own life in danger in order to save Kurisu's life, prevent Nakabachi from successfully escaping with the time travel theory, and fool his past self, setting him on his journey through time. Returning to the Steins Gate world line, safe from the threat of a third world war, Rintarō and Kurisu manage to reunite by chance (or by fate) in the streets of Akihabara.|$|E
