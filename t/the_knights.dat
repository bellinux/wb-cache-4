50|$|As {{summarized}} {{in a film}} publication, <b>The</b> Tavern <b>Knight</b> (Norwood), known for his handling of his sword, is really Roland Marleigh, lord of Marleigh Castle. Gregory Ashburn (Croker-King) and his brother Joseph (Humphreys) long ago had caused the death of <b>the</b> <b>Knight's</b> wife and taken his young son, now known as their ward Kenneth (Anderson). Cynthia (Stuart), a niece, was {{also a member of}} the household, and <b>the</b> <b>Knight</b> believes that she loves Kenneth. The forces of Charles Stuart (Wickers) and Oliver Cromwell (Conway) are about to fight with <b>The</b> Tavern <b>Knight</b> leading <b>the</b> Stuart forces. Kenneth, fighting for the King, was under <b>the</b> <b>Knight's</b> leadership. When Stuart's forces retreated, <b>the</b> <b>Knight</b> and Kenneth are captured but later escape. <b>The</b> <b>Knight</b> learns that Kenneth is of the house of Marleigh, now in the possession of the Ashburns. Kenneth takes <b>the</b> <b>Knight</b> to Marleigh Castle, where <b>the</b> <b>Knight</b> reveals his identity and a sword fight begins. One of the Ashburns escapes with his life when he promises to tell <b>the</b> <b>Knight</b> news of his son. Complications follow, and <b>the</b> <b>Knight</b> kills Kenneth, which leaves <b>the</b> <b>Knight</b> free to acknowledge his love for Cynthia, who also loves him.|$|R

5|$|A new {{period of}} {{intensive}} colonization began in Banat, Transylvania and other regions within the Kingdom of Hungary after {{the withdrawal of}} the Mongols. King Béla IV was also considering settling <b>the</b> <b>Knights</b> Hospitallers in the lands between the Carpathians and the Lower Danube. His diploma of 1247 for <b>the</b> <b>Knights</b> evidences the existence of four Romanian polities in the region. They were under the rule of voivodes Litovoi and Seneslau, and of knezes Farcaş and John.|$|E
5|$|Both {{forces were}} {{composed}} of troops from several states and lands, including numerous mercenaries; for example, Bohemian mercenaries fought on each side. <b>The</b> <b>knights</b> also invited guest crusaders. Twenty-two different peoples, mostly Germanic, joined them. Teutonic recruits included soldiers from Westphalia, Frisia, Austria, Swabia and Stettin (Szczecin). Two Hungarian nobles, Nicholas II Garay and Stibor of Stiboricz, brought 200 men for <b>the</b> <b>Knights,</b> but support from Sigismund of Hungary was disappointing.|$|E
5|$|In 1230 the Teutonic Knights, a crusading {{military}} order, {{moved to}} Chełmno Land and launched the Prussian Crusade against the pagan Prussian clans. With {{support from the}} pope and Holy Roman Emperor, the Teutons conquered and converted the Prussians by the 1280s and shifted {{their attention to the}} pagan Grand Duchy of Lithuania. For about 100 years <b>the</b> <b>Knights</b> raided Lithuanian lands, particularly Samogitia, as it separated <b>the</b> <b>Knights</b> in Prussia from their branch in Livonia. While the border regions became an uninhabited wilderness, <b>the</b> <b>Knights</b> gained very little territory. The Lithuanians first gave up Samogitia during the Lithuanian Civil War (1381–1384) in the Treaty of Dubysa. The territory was used as a bargaining chip to ensure Teutonic support for one of the sides in the internal power struggle.|$|E

As <b>the</b> <b>Knight</b> tries to regain his wits, the Pirate quickly crawls to {{retrieve}} his fourth flintlock pistol, picks it up, and walks toward <b>the</b> <b>Knight.</b> <b>The</b> Pirate opens <b>the</b> <b>Knight's</b> visor and fires point blank.

The Pirate aims and fires, but misses.

5|$|In May 1409 an {{uprising}} in Teutonic-held Samogitia started. Lithuania supported it and <b>the</b> <b>knights</b> threatened to invade. Poland announced {{its support for}} the Lithuanian cause and threatened to invade Prussia in return. As Prussian troops evacuated Samogitia, Teutonic Grand Master Ulrich von Jungingen declared war on the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania on 6 August 1409. <b>The</b> <b>Knights</b> hoped to defeat Poland and Lithuania separately, and began by invading Greater Poland and Kuyavia, catching the Poles by surprise. <b>The</b> <b>Knights</b> burned the castle at Dobrin (Dobrzyń nad Wisłą), captured Bobrowniki after a 14-day siege, conquered Bydgoszcz (Bromberg) and sacked several towns. The Poles organized counterattacks and recaptured Bydgoszcz. The Samogitians attacked Memel (Klaipėda). However, neither side {{was ready for a}} full-scale war.|$|E
5|$|In the {{meantime}} <b>the</b> <b>Knights</b> were buying lands in Prussia. In May 1392, von Wallenrode began negotiations with Sigismund of Hungary to buy Neumark for 500,000 guldens. Negotiations fell apart {{as the title}} to the land was contested by several dukes. The Neumark purchase was closed with Jobst of Moravia only in 1402. During July 1392, <b>the</b> <b>Knights</b> agreed to pay Władysław Opolczyk 50,000 guldens for the Dobrzyń Land, which had been contested among Piast dukes since 1377. Opolczyk, the ruler of Opole in Silesia, {{had little interest in}} the volatile regions to his north. In 1392, he circulated a proposal to partition Poland among the Teutonic Knights, the Holy Roman Empire, Silesia, and Hungary, but it was rejected. These purchases by <b>the</b> <b>Knights</b> threatened Poland's northern borders.|$|E

500|$|<b>The</b> <b>Knight's</b> Cross of <b>the</b> Iron Cross and its higher {{grades were}} based on four {{separate}} enactments.

[...] Article 2 of the enactment mandated that the award of a higher class be preceded by the award of all preceding classes. As the war progressed, some of the recipients of <b>the</b> <b>Knight's</b> Cross distinguished themselves further and a higher grade, <b>the</b> <b>Knight's</b> Cross of <b>the</b> Iron Cross with Oak Leaves (...) , was instituted. The Oak Leaves, as they were commonly referred to, {{were based on}} <b>the</b> second <b>Knight's</b> Cross related enactment of 3 June 1940. In 1941, two higher grades of <b>the</b> <b>Knight's</b> Cross were instituted. The enactment of 28 September 1941 introduced <b>the</b> <b>Knight's</b> Cross of <b>the</b> Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords (...) and <b>the</b> <b>Knight's</b> Cross of <b>the</b> Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds (...) [...] At the end of 1944 the final grade, <b>the</b> <b>Knight's</b> Cross of <b>the</b> Iron Cross with Golden Oak Leaves, Swords, and Diamonds (...) , based on <b>the</b> last <b>Knight's</b> Cross related enactment of 29 December 1944, became the final variant of <b>the</b> <b>Knight's</b> Cross authorized.|$|R

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>Knight’s</b> Tour is an {{interesting}} question related to the game of chess. In chess, <b>the</b> <b>Knight</b> must move two squares in one direction (forward, backward, left, right) followed by one square in a perpendicular direction. The question of <b>the</b> <b>Knight’s</b> Tour follows: Does there exist a tour for <b>the</b> <b>Knight</b> that encompasses every single square on the chess board without revisiting any squares? <b>The</b> existence of <b>Knight’s</b> Tours has been proven for the standard 8 x 8 chess board. Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>Knight’s</b> Tour can also exist on boards with different sizes and shapes. There {{has been a lot}} of research into tours on two-dimensional boards. In this project, we explore the question of <b>the</b> <b>Knight’s</b> Tour on multi-layered chess boards. In other words, would it still be possible for a Knight’s Tour to exist on a chess board if there was a third dimension of movement that <b>the</b> <b>Knight</b> could take? This thesis will look at <b>the</b> <b>Knight’s</b> Tour on a two-dimensional board, both standard and rectangular, and will then examine <b>the</b> existence of <b>Knight’s</b> Tours on a multi-layered chess board. Finally, <b>the</b> <b>Knight’s</b> Tour will also be explored on a three dimensional cube on which <b>the</b> <b>Knight</b> can only move on the face of the cube. Throughout the thesis, we will use concepts of Graph Theory to explore tours on the different types of boards...|$|R
