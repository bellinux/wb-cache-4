[...] Otters general manager Sherwood Bassin was quick to come to Liambas' defense following the suspension, expressing surprise at the severity of the penalty from Branch. Bassin asserted that Liambas was not simply a [...] "goofball kid", citing his 95 percent average in high school, as well as volunteer work in initiating a stay-in-school program for kids and at the Shriners Hospital for Children in Erie. Liambas expressed regret during the hearing for his hit and commented that he did not know if he could deliver bodychecks anymore as a hockey player.|$|E

6000|$|A LANTERN {{light from}} {{deeper in the}} barn [...] Shone on {{a man and woman}} in the door [...] And threw their lurching shadows on a house [...] Near by, all dark in every glossy window. [...] A horse's hoof pawed once the hollow floor, [...] And the back of the gig they stood beside [...] Moved in a little. The man grasped a wheel, [...] The woman spoke out sharply, [...] "Whoa, stand still!" [...] "I saw it just as plain as a white plate," [...] She said, [...] "as the light on the {{dashboard}} ran [...] Along the bushes at the roadside--a man's face. [...] You must have seen it too." [...] "I didn't see it. [...] Are you sure----" [...] "Yes, I'm sure!" [...] "--it was a face?" [...] "Joel, I'll have to look. I can't go in, [...] I can't, and leave a thing like that unsettled. [...] Doors locked and curtains drawn will make no difference. [...] I always have felt strange when we came home [...] To the dark house after so long an absence, [...] And the key rattled loudly into place [...] Seemed to warn someone to be getting out [...] At one door as we entered at another. [...] What if I'm right, and someone all the time-- [...] Don't hold my arm!" [...] "I say it's someone passing." [...] "You speak as if this were a travelled road. [...] You forget where we are. What is beyond [...] That he'd be going to or coming from [...] At such an hour of night, and on foot too. [...] What was he standing still for in the bushes?" [...] "It's not so very late--it's only dark. [...] There's more in it than you're inclined to say. [...] Did he look like----?" [...] "He looked like anyone. [...] I'll never rest to-night unless I know. [...] Give me the lantern." [...] "You don't want the lantern." [...] She pushed past him and got it for herself. [...] "You're not to come," [...] she said. [...] "This is my business. [...] If the time's come to face it, I'm the one [...] To put it the right way. He'd never dare-- [...] Listen! He kicked a stone. Hear that, hear that! [...] He's coming towards us. Joel, go in--please. [...] Hark!--I don't hear him now. But please go in." [...] "In the first place you can't make me believe it's----" [...] "It is--or someone else he's sent to watch. [...] And now's the time to have it out with him [...] While we know definitely where he is. [...] Let him get off and he'll be everywhere [...] Around us, looking out of trees and bushes [...] Till I sha'n't dare to set a foot outdoors. [...] And I can't stand it. Joel, let me go!" [...] "But it's nonsense to think he'd care enough." [...] "You mean you couldn't understand his caring. [...] Oh, but you see he hadn't had enough-- [...] Joel, I won't--I won't--I promise you. [...] We mustn't say hard things. You mustn't either." [...] "I'll be the one, if anybody goes! [...] But you give him the advantage with this light. [...] What couldn't he do to us standing here! [...] And if to see was what he wanted, why [...] He has seen all there was to see and gone." [...] He appeared to forget to keep his hold, [...] But advanced with her as she crossed the grass. [...] "What do you want?" [...] she cried to all the dark. [...] She stretched up tall to overlook the light [...] That hung in both hands hot against her skirt. [...] "There's no one; so you're wrong," [...] he said. [...] "There is.-- [...] What do you want?" [...] she cried, and then herself [...] Was startled when an answer really came. [...] "Nothing." [...] It came from well along the road. [...] She reached a hand to Joel for support: [...] The smell of scorching woollen made her faint. [...] "What are you doing round this house at night?" [...] "Nothing." [...] A pause: there seemed no more to say. [...] And then the voice again: [...] "You seem afraid. [...] I saw by the way you whipped up the horse. [...] I'll just come forward in the lantern light [...] And let you see." [...] "Yes, do.--Joel, go back!" [...] She stood her ground against the noisy steps [...] That came on, but her body rocked a little. [...] "You see," [...] the voice said. [...] "Oh." [...] She looked and looked. [...] "You don't see--I've a child here by the hand." [...] "What's a child doing at this time of night----?" [...] "Out walking. Every child should have the memory [...] Of at least one long-after-bedtime walk. [...] What, son?" [...] "Then I should think you'd try to find [...] Somewhere to walk----" [...] "The highway as it happens-- [...] We're stopping for the fortnight down at Dean's."

6000|$|I didn't, for two reasons, {{answer your}} {{delightful}} letter, or rather exquisite note, from the Sydney Club, but I must {{thank you for}} it now, before the gulfs have washed you down, or at least have washed away from you all after-tastes of brineless things--the stay-at-home works of lubberly friends. One of the reasons just mentioned was that I had written to you at Sydney (c/o the mystic Towns,) {{only a few days}} before your note arrived; the other is that until a few days ago I hugged the soft illusion that by the time anything else would reach you, you would already have started for England. This fondest of hopes of all of us has been shattered in a manner to which history furnishes a parallel only in the behaviour of its most famous coquettes and courtesans. You are indeed the male Cleopatra or buccaneering Pompadour of the Deep--the wandering Wanton of the Pacific. You swim into our ken with every provocation and prospect--and we have only time to open our arms to receive you when your immortal back is turned to us in the act of still more provoking flight. The moral is <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> virtuous {{whether we like it or}} no. Seriously, it was a real heart-break to have September substituted for June; but I have a general faith in the fascinated providence who watches over you, to the neglect of all other human affairs--I believe that even He has an idea that you know what you are about, and even what He is, though He by this time doesn't in the least know himself. Moreover I have selfish grounds of resignation in the fact that I shall be in England in September, whereas, to my almost intolerable torment, I should probably not have been in June. Therefore when you come, if you ever do, which in my heart of hearts I doubt, I shall see you in all your strange exotic bloom, in all your paint and beads and feathers. May you grow a magnificent extra crop of all such things (as they will bring you a fortune here,) in this much grudged extra summer. Charming and delightful to me to see you with a palate for my plain domestic pudding, after all the wild cannibal smacks that you have learned to know. I think the better of the poor little study in the painfully-familiar, since hearing that it could bear such voyages and resist such tests. You have fed a presumption that vaguely stirs within me--that of trying to get at you in June or July with a fearfully long-winded but very highly-finished novel which I am putting forth in (probably) the last days of May. If I were sure it would overtake you on some coral strand I shouldn't hesitate; for, seriously and selfishly speaking, I can't (spiritually) afford not to put the book under the eye of the sole and single Anglo-saxon capable of perceiving--though he may care for little else in it--how well it is written. So I shall probably cast it upon the waters and pray for it; as I suppose you are coming back to Sydney, it may meet you there, and you can read it on the voyage home. In that box you'll have to. I don't say it to bribe you in advance to unnatural tolerance--but I have an impression that I didn't make copious or clear to you in my last what a grand literary life your Master of B. has been leading here. Somehow, a miracle has been wrought for you (for you they are,) and the fine old feather-bed of English taste has thrilled with preternatural recognitions. The most unlikely number of people have discerned that the Master is [...] "well written." [...] It has had the highest success of honour that the English-reading public can now confer; where it has failed (the success, save that it hasn't failed at all!) it has done so through the constitutional incapacity of the umpire--infected, by vulgar intercourses, as with some unnameable disease. We have lost our status--nous n'avons plus qualitÃ©--to confer degrees. Nevertheless, last year you woke us up at night, for an hour--and we scrambled down in our shirt and climbed a garden-wall and stole a laurel, which we have been brandishing ever since over your absent head. I tell you this because I think Colvin (at least it was probably he--he is visibly better--or else Mrs. Sitwell) mentioned to me the other day that you had asked in touching virginal ignorance for news of the fate of the book. Its [...] "fate," [...] my dear fellow, has been glittering glory--simply: and I ween--that is I hope--you will find the glitter has chinked as well. I sent you a new Zola the other day--at a venture: but I have no confidence that I gratified a curiosity. I haven't read The Human Beast--one knows him without that--and I am told Zola's account of him is dull and imperfect. I would read anything new about him--but this is old, old, old. I hope your pen, this summer, will cleave the deeps of art even as your prow, or your keel, or whatever's the knowing name for it, furrows the Pacific flood. Into what strange and wondrous dyes you must be now qualified to dip it! Roast yourself, I beseech you, on the sharp spit of perfection, that you may give out your aromas and essences! Tell your wife, please, to read between the lines of this, and between the words and the letters, all that I miss the occasion to write directly to her. I hope she has continued to distil, to your mother, the honey of those impressions of which a few months ago the latter lent me for a day or two a taste--on its long yellow foolscap combs. They would make, they will make, of course, a deliciously sweet book. I hope Lloyd, whom I greet and bless, is living up to the height of his young privilege--and secreting honey too, according to the mild discipline of the hive. There are lots of things more to tell you, no doubt, but if I go on they will all take the shape of questions, and that won't be fair. The supreme thing to say is Don't, oh don't, simply ruin our nerves and our tempers for the rest of life by not throwing the rope in September, to him who will, for once in his life, not muff his catch: ...|$|E
