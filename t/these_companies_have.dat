5|$|The book traces {{financial}} support for climate change denial to the fossil fuel industry, asserting <b>these</b> <b>companies</b> <b>have</b> attempted to influence public opinion on the matter. Washington and Cook write that politicians {{have a tendency to}} use weasel words as part of a propaganda tactic through use of spin, as a way to deflect public interest away from climate change and remain passive on the issue. The authors conclude that if the public ceased engaging in denial, the problem of climate change could be realistically addressed.|$|E
5|$|About 40 {{years after}} {{nationalisation}} British Rail was privatised {{and the old}} name was revived by Great Western Trains, the train operating company providing passenger services on the old GWR routes to South Wales and the South West, which subsequently became First Great Western {{as part of the}} FirstGroup but in September 2015 changed its name to Great Western Railway in order to 'reinstate the ideals of our founder'. The operating infrastructure, however, was transferred to Railtrack and has since passed to Network Rail. <b>These</b> <b>companies</b> <b>have</b> continued to preserve appropriate parts of its stations and bridges so historic GWR structures can still be recognised around the network.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} settlements date {{to around}} AD700. Aalborg's {{position at the}} narrowest point on the Limfjord made it an important harbour during the Middle Ages, and later a large industrial centre. Architecturally, the city {{is known for its}} half-timbered mansions built by its prosperous merchants. Budolfi Church, now a cathedral, dates {{from the end of the}} 14th century and Aalborghus Castle, a royal residence, was built in 1550. Today, Aalborg is a city in transition from a working-class industrial area to a knowledge-based community. A major exporter of grain, cement, and spirits, its thriving business interests include Siemens Wind Power, Aalborg Industries, and Aalborg Portland. <b>These</b> <b>companies</b> <b>have</b> become global producers of wind turbine rotors, marine boilers and cement.|$|E

5|$|Since the {{economic}} crisis of 2009, which gutted many of London's manufacturing jobs, the city has transitioned to become a technology hub {{with a focus on}} the Digital Creative sector. As of 2016, London is home to 300 technology companies and employs 3% of the city's labour force. Many of <b>these</b> <b>companies</b> <b>have</b> moved into former factories and industrial spaces located in and around the downtown core, and have renovated them as modern offices. For example, Info-Tech Research Group's London office is located in a hosiery factory, and Arcane Digital moved into a 1930s industrial building in 2015. rTraction, a digital media firm, currently has its offices in the London Roundhouse, a steam locomotive repair shop built in 1887. Its redesign, which opened in 2015, won the 2015 Paul Oberman Award for Adaptive Re-Use from the Architectural Conservancy of Ontario. London is also home to Diply, which is ranked among the top websites on the Internet, video game companies Big Viking Games and Digital Extremes, and Voices.com, which provides voiceover artists a platform to advertise and sell their services to those looking for voiceover work.|$|E

50|$|By 1929, each of <b>these</b> <b>companies</b> <b>had</b> {{essentially}} outgrown {{its usefulness}} to the industry. For most of them, the market had some time earlier reached a saturation point. In some instances, their machines were badly dated and rapidly approaching obsolescence. For each of <b>these</b> <b>companies</b> to <b>have</b> attempted further activity on solo basis would almost have certainly been disastrous. By uniting their various and somewhat diverse product lines {{into a single}} company, Oliver Farm Equipment instantly became a virtual full-line manufacturer.|$|R

25|$|Texas Instruments v. Westinghouse: In 1962–1963, when <b>these</b> <b>companies</b> <b>have</b> {{adopted the}} planar process, the Westinghouse {{engineer}} Hung-Chang Lin invented the lateral transistor. In the usual planar process, all transistors {{have the same}} conductivity type, typically n-p-n, whereas the invention by Lin allowed to create n-p-n and p-n-p transistors on one chip. The military orders that were anticipated by Texas Instruments went to Westinghouse. TI filed a case, which was settled out of court.|$|E

25|$|The {{economic}} {{transition in}} 1989 {{has resulted in}} a dynamic increase in the number and value of investments conducted by Polish corporations abroad. Over a quarter of <b>these</b> <b>companies</b> <b>have</b> participated in a foreign project or joint venture, and 72 percent decided to continue foreign expansion. According to reports made by the National Bank of Poland, the value of Polish foreign direct investments reached almost 300 billion PLN at the end of 2014. The Central Statistical Office estimated that in 2014 there were around 1,437 Polish corporations with interests in 3,194 foreign entities.|$|E
25|$|It was {{feared that}} {{legitimate}} non-banking financial companies and micro finance institutions would be stigmatised, {{leading to a}} vicious cycle of low depositor trust, higher interest rates, lower lending and a localised credit crisis. Because most of the Saradha Group depositors came from the lowest economic strata, {{the loss of the}} investment would cause a further decrease in social mobility. The scandal drew attention to similar illegal deposit mobilising companies, which are facing increased regulatory pressure. Many of <b>these</b> <b>companies</b> <b>have</b> been variations of time share travel schemes, of which there are few clear regulations. These companies tried to register as cooperative societies to continue their financial operations.|$|E

25|$|Suburban trains connect Buenos Aires {{city with}} the Greater Buenos Aires area, (see: Buenos Aires {{commuter}} rail network).

The busiest lines are electric, several are diesel powered, while {{some of these are}} currently being electrified, while the rolling stock is being replaced across the city. Until recently, Trenes de Buenos Aires, UGOFE, Ferrovías and Metrovías were some of the private companies which provided suburban passenger services in the Buenos Aires metropolitan area. However, with the modernisation and re-nationalisation of these services, many of <b>these</b> <b>companies</b> <b>have</b> had their contracts terminated or have been absorbed into Trenes Argentinos (the state railway operator), though as of 2015 some private operators such as Metrovías (Urquiza Line) do remain.|$|E
