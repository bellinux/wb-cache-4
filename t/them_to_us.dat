5|$|The {{relatively}} stable {{value of the}} currency in the 1990s compared to the 1980s is explained by Peter D. Little in Somalia: Economy without a State as resulting {{from the lack of}} a central government printing currency to pay for civil and military expenditures. Traders avoid the need to carry large amounts of Somali shillings by converting <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>U.S.</b> dollars and then wiring them to money houses in Somalia. Because identification can be easily forged, those seeking to pick up wired money are required to answer questions about their clan and kinship relations. Private remittance companies known as hawala assist in the transfer of money. One of the largest such companies, Al Barakaat, was shut down in 2001 by a U.S.-led initiative due to alleged terrorist ties; the company's communications business, with more than 40,000 subscribers, was also shut down.|$|E

[...] "Rogamus" [...] shows humility, [...] "petimus" [...] confidence. [...] Why do we distinguish [...] "hæc dona" [...] and [...] "hæc munera"? [...] "Dona" [...] because God gives <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>us,</b> [...] "munera" [...] because we offer {{them back to}} Him. Why is there no Amen after the [...] "Nobis quoque peccatoribus"? [...] Because the angels say it at that place. [...] "Per ipsum et cum ipso et in ipso est tibi... omnis honor et gloria" [...] signifies in its triple form that our Lord suffered three kinds of indignities in His Passion – in His body, soul, and honour. Historically, when these prayers were first composed, such reduplications and repetitions were really made {{for the sake of}} the rhythm which we observe in all liturgical texts.|$|E

[...] This did not bother me much, as Indians do not eat such food. [...] At dinner-time that same day, when I sat down to our table, I saw to my surprise that there were pancakes before us. These were the ‘left-overs’ from the morning, and now the cook wanted to feed <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>us.</b> [...] Although I was very angry, I made no remark, but quietly left the table and went over where Buffalo Bill and the head officials of the show were eating dinner. Colonel Cody asked, ‘What is it, Standing Bear?’ ‘Colonel Cody,’ I replied, ‘this morning all the other races represented in the show were served with pancakes, but the Indians were not given any. [...] We do not object to that, as we do not care for them; but now the cook has put his old pancakes on our table and expects us to eat what was left over from breakfast, and it isn’t right.’ [...] Buffalo Bill’s eyes snapped, as he arose from the table. ‘Come with me, Standing Bear,’ he exclaimed. [...] We went direct to {{the manager of the}} dining-room, and the Colonel said to him, ‘Look here, sir, you are trying to feed my Indians left-over pancakes from the morning meal. [...] I want you to understand, sir, that I will not stand for such treatment. [...] My Indians are the principal feature of this show, and they are the one people I will not allow to be misused or neglected. [...] Hereafter, see to it that they get just exactly what they want at meal-time. Do you understand me, sir”’ [...] ‘Yes, sir, oh, yes, sir,’ exclaimed the embarrassed manager.
