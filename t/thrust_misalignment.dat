40|$|Over {{the past}} three years, a team at The Aerospace Corporation has been {{investigating}} high Delta-V solid rocket motor propulsion systems for CubeSats. All solid rocket motors have an unknown <b>thrust</b> <b>misalignment.</b> Therefore, any vehicle propelled by a solid rocket motor must include an attitude control system (ACS) capable {{of dealing with the}} torque generated by this <b>thrust</b> <b>misalignment.</b> We have designed and flight-tested two solid rocket motor thrust vector control (TVC) systems that provide the means for an ACS to null the <b>thrust</b> <b>misalignment</b> of a small solid rocket motor and allow the CubeSat to be steered while accelerating. The two TVC systems use completely different approaches [...] one is a moving mass system, the other is a nozzle jet paddle system. The TVC systems can be combined with a small solid (or liquid) rocket motor to provide a 1 U (a 10 cm cube) x 1 kg propulsion unit that can be attached to a 1 kg CubeSat and provide up to 950 m/s of Delta-V. The propulsion systems are highly scalable and can be designed to provide smaller or larger amounts of Delta-V as desired. A 2 U (a 20 cm x 10 cm x 10 cm cuboid) x 2. 5 kg propulsion unit attached to a 1 kg CubeSat can provide up to 1400 m/s of Delta-V. The proof-of-concept designs and flight tests of these propulsion systems are presented...|$|E

Aerodynamic and <b>thrust</b> <b>misalignment</b> disturbances are computed {{as well as the}} total disturbing moments in pitch, yaw, and roll. Effective <b>thrust</b> <b>misalignment</b> angle time histories of the rocket booster motor are calculated.

Based on thrust stand data, a <b>thrust</b> vector <b>misalignment</b> was indicated that was slightly higher than permissible for the worst case, i. e., considerable degradation of the torque capacity of the attitude control system combined with venting of helium at its upper limit.

40|$|Scope of {{this thesis}} is the {{analysis}} and validation of the aerodynamics of the SMART rocket {{from the point of}} view of both the aerodynamic stability and trajectory. The rocket summarizes the contribution of the Technical University (Technische Universitat) Dresden to the STudentische Experimental-RaketeN (STERN) program, promoted by the German Space Administration (DLR). In the first part of this work, all the possible disturbances commonly affecting the rocket during its atmospheric flight are modeled in an analytical fashion. These include <b>thrust</b> vector <b>misalignments</b> and offsets, combustion instabilities, fins misalignments and presence of wind. Then these perturbing terms are considered inside properly defined models able to provide the response of the vehicle in terms of the time evolution of its vertical axis deflection with respect to the velocity direction, i. e. the time profile of the angle of attack. In this way the aerodynamic stability of the any uncontrolled rocket could be possibly studied from both the static and dynamic point of view. The previous models are applied to the actual state of the SMART rocket and the most critical types of disturbance are identified with the related safety margins. Subsequently a design procedure is developed to define a new aerodynamics able to extend the most critical of the previous margins. This procedure is based on the study of the most important quantities related to the aerodynamic stability problem as a function of a properly defined set of geometrical parameters. These parameters are directly related with the aerodynamic shape of the rocket fins. The optimum which results in the best compromize between the vehicle response to all the previous disturbances is so evaluated and considered in the subsequent trajectory validation. This is realized by means of the ASTOS software, a powerful mission and system analysis and optimization program funded by the European Space Research and Technology Center (ESA/ESTEC). This program has been used both to verify the previous analytical response regarding the vehicle aerodynamic stability and to validate the trajectory of the updated configuration of the SMART rocket. Both 3 dof and 6 dof vertical and non-vertical analysis with and without perturbations have been simulated. The results are compared with those provided by dedicated analytical models whenever is possible. In conclusion the updated configuration obtained from the analytical design results to be the optimum one able to satisfy the imposed requirements in terms of minimum altitudes and maximum culmination velocities with any type of disturbance...|$|R

40|$|The 2. 75 Inch Rocket System is a {{multi-service}} system {{consisting of}} launchers, warheads, and rocket motors. The air vehicle is a warhead and rocket motor combination that flies a free flight ballistic trajectory to the target. While the 2. 75 -Inch Rocket System has been modified {{over time to}} improve the performance, the system still experiences problems hitting a point target resulting in {{a high number of}} rockets needed to perform a mission. This problem is due to both low precision (wide impact distribution) and low system accuracy. Precision is affected by <b>thrust</b> <b>misalignment,</b> downwash and crosswinds whereas accuracy is affected by the launch system (aircraft and launcher) and the launch environment (air density). Both precision and accuracy need to be improved to increase the ability of the 2. 75 -Inch Rocket System to hit targets.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to assess the {{institutional}} support for capacity building of the senior public servants in the North West Province of South Africa. The literature, official documents and the responses from the departments and the senior public servants were analysed. The study has revealed the traditional gap between policy making and policy communication on one hand, and operational management and administration practices on the other. In detail, through the structured interviews and questionnaires, the study established that the public service is not taking a systematic and holistic approach to aligning and integrating the strategic management requirements and HR operations and needs which influence, and are influenced by, the expectations and needs of the senior public servants. Indeed, the dearth of linkages between strategic planning and effective HR planning <b>thrusts</b> a cultural <b>misalignment</b> and misfit within and between the departments, conventional HR practices and the paucity of long-term strategic leadership for the public service of the North West Province. Consequently, the institutional support in terms of effectively inducting the senior public servants; identifying management development and training needs in the context of the senior public servants’ jobs and careers; offering strategic and continuous leadership and professional development; the linkage between performance management review systems and the development mechanisms; and the appropriateness of the development activity to the needs of the current and future senior public servants require a structured framework to holistically confront the challenges of the public service, develop cultures of collective performance and succession management, as well as to sustain public service capability. From the perspective of effective public management, recommendations were made for successful transformation and HR competency management, as well as the durability of political leadership within the system of governance in the public service.

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{increase}} the density of guided rockets, a passive control method was proposed to reduce the trajectory dispersion caused by initial disturbances, <b>thrust</b> <b>misalignment,</b> vertical wind, etc. {{at the end of}} boost phase. The basic principle of passive control method was introduced briefly, and then the disturbance motion equations for the rocket projectile were established. The effective conditions to implement passive control on guided rockets were put forward. A technical scheme of installing elastic sabots on rocket projectile was proposed to realize passive control and a simulation was conducted. The simulation results indicate that the passive control scheme can effectively decrease the velocity direction deviation caused by various disturbances factors at the end of boost phase...|$|E
40|$|Trajectory {{optimization}} of {{a generic}} launch vehicle is considered in this paper. The trajectory from launch point to terminal injection point is divided in to two segments. The first segment deals with launcher clearance and vertical raise of the vehicle. During this phase, a nonlinear feedback guidance loop is incorporated to assure vertical raise in presence of <b>thrust</b> <b>misalignment,</b> {{centre of gravity}} offset, wind disturbance etc. and possibly to clear obstacles as well. The second segment deals with the trajectory optimization, where {{the objective is to}} ensure desired terminal conditions as well as minimum control effort and minimum structural loading in the high dynamic pressure region. The usefulness of this dynamic optimization problem formulation is demonstrated by solving it using the classical Gradient method. Numerical results for both the segments are presented, which clearly brings out the potential advantages of the proposed approach...|$|E
40|$|In the {{terminal}} proximity stage of autonomous rendezvous and docking, {{two kinds of}} continuous optimal guidance algorithms are developed to overcome {{the influence of the}} following terms, the uncertainty of the system model, the noise of the relative information measurements and <b>thrust</b> <b>misalignment</b> on relative guidance accuracy. First of all, a glide slope scheme widely used is introduced to plan the ideal terminal proximity trajectory. By using this assumption the ideal relative position and velocity can be determined beforehand. And then, the tracking error equations for V-bar approach are derived. So, the guidance problem is transformed to synthesize a controller to eliminate the tracking error to zero. Modern control methods are applied to design the H 2 /H ∞ controller. The LMI (linear matrix inequalities) technology is adopted here to get the final solution for optimal controllers. Simulation based on the solution obtained though MATLAB LMI toolbox is performed on a scenario of the rendezvous and docking final proximity stage. The simulation results verify the validity and superiority of the H ∞ design method for {{the terminal}} proximity of autonomous rendezvous and docking...|$|E
40|$|These days {{more and}} more rockets are {{developed}} by companies, students and other amateurs. To assess the safety of these rockets, a method is necessary to estimate the risk of these vehicles quantitatively. Because tools to do so are not freely available, {{the goal of this}} thesis is to research methods to quantitatively estimate the risk of nominal flight of unguided rockets. The first step to do so, is to develop a trajectory simulator. To incorporate the effect of wind (weather cocking) and spinning, it is necessary to develop a simulator with three translational degrees of freedom, and three rotational degrees of freedom. The position and velocity of the rocket are described in a Cartesian coordinate system. To prevent singularities in the orientation, quaternions are used to describe the orientation of the rocket. To propagate these through time, classical equations of motion for a rigid body can be used. To do so the impulse thrust force and the jet damping moment are considered as an external force and external moment. The gravity force, the aerodynamic force, and the aerodynamic moment are the other external influences. To calculate these, the Earth is modeled as a flatted sphere (both shape and gravity field) with a US 1976 standard atmosphere, and a tabulated wind profile. The aerodynamic forces and moments are calculated based on this environment and a limited set of aerodynamic coefficients, obtained from the Missile Datcom 97 program. Because the problem’s nature it is not solvable analytically. Furthermore, {{in some parts of the}} flight the state rocket’s state changes rapidly, while in others parts the system behaves very smoothly. Therefore a Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg 56 variable time step integrator is used to solve the equations of motion numerically. As a result of this decision it is necessary to implement an event handling algorithm to execute discrete behavior (e. g. stage ignition) at the right time. To validate the in C++ developed program ROSIE, a small amateur rocket’s flight (2 m long, apogee at 1 km) is simulated. The results show similar behavior as observed in the real flight data of the simulated rocket, indicating that the simulator is valid for the simulation of small amateur rockets. When comparing a single simulated impact point with a measured impact point, they will most likely not coincide. This can be explained by errors in the flight’s modeling, and can be due to randomness in what is simulated. By stating that these errors are due to uncertainties in the analysis, and modeling these uncertainties as random (input) variables, the result of the analysis will also be a random variable. An advantage of such a variable is that the result is not a single point, but a probability distribution. This distribution can be used to determine the risk to each individual, or the area which needs to be evacuated. To determine the probability distribution different methods are used. These methods can be grouped in parameterized and non-parameterized methods. With parameterized methods, a known type of probability distribution is used to model the dispersion of the impact point. To estimate the parameters of this distribution only a limited number of simulation runs is necessary. The downside of using a parameterized method is that the problem is simplified, in such a way that it can be modeled by a known distribution function. This introduces errors in the estimation of the risk. The alternative is to use a non-parameterized method. The method used is Monte Carlo simulation. To determine the probability of impact in a certain area, the trajectory simulation is run a large number of times. Because part of the input is random, each estimated impact point will have another location. By counting the number of impact points which landed in the sub domain, and dividing this by the total number of simulations, the probability of impact in that specific area can be calculated. Properties of Monte Carlo simulation can be used to specify a confidence interval for the calculated answer. By increasing the number of simulations the accuracy of the answer can be increased. The downside of Monte Carlo simulation is that many trajectory simulations are necessary, making it a very computational time intensive method. For the parameterized methods two different types of probability distributions are used, being the bivariate normal distribution, and the mixture model variant. This variant combines multiple bivariate normal distribution into a new more complex model. To estimate the parameters of these distributions, they are fitted through the data generated with trajectory simulator. This data is generated with different sampling schemes. Four different schemes are used. One-at-a-time sampling and orthogonal array sampling are only valid for the bivariate normal distribution, while the random sampling and Sobol sequence sampling scheme can be used for both. To compare the different methods, they are applied to a preliminary design of the Stratos II rocket. This is a large amateur rocket (5 m) which will fly the 50 km in the near future. As a starting position for the comparison, 50000 random trajectories are simulated as benchmark data (Monte Carlo simulation). Comparing the parameters of the bivariate normal distribution obtained with this simulation and with 85 one-at-a-time samples shows a differences of 15 to 30 %. When 81 orthogonal array samples are used, this difference is reduced to less than 10 %. With the same number of samples the found accuracy of Sobol sequence sampling is similar to that of the orthogonal arrays, but an advantage of Sobol sampling is that any number of samples can be selected to reach the desired accuracy. Random sampling cannot be used at a low number of samples. Orthogonal array and Sobol sampling have a better performance than one-at-a-time sampling, but are also more complex in their use. Which method to use, depends on the application. The second aspect which is benchmarked, is how accurate the parameterized method estimated the probability of impact at two specific locations. Comparing the probability (and its confidence interval) obtained directly from the Monte Carlo simulation with the one obtained from the bivariate normal distribution (based on 50000 random points) shows that the latter method can be either a factor 2 to 3 too conservative, or too optimistic. Whether or not this is acceptable depends on the applications. Using a mixture model, consisting of only two bivariate normal distributions, already shows significant improvements. Increasing the number of components does increase the accuracy, but also the sensitivity to outliers. Therefore it is not wise to use more than 5 components. To determine the influence of each individual parameter on the probability distribution (the footprint), different sensitivity methods are applied. To study non-linear effects and interactions, the set of parameters is reduced with the Morris elementary effect screening method. Applied regression based sensitivity analysis shows that the dispersion in range direction consists mainly of linear contributions. More specifically, these are the contributions due to uncertainty in thrust of the second stage, the drag coefficient and the atmospheric density. The dispersion in cross range direction depends for a significant part (> 10 %) on non-linear contributions and interactions between parameters. This explains the error when modeling the probability distribution with a bivariate normal distribution. For the studied case, the two parameters which have the most influence on the dispersion in cross range direction, are the <b>thrust</b> <b>misalignment</b> of the first stage and the center of mass offset. The Stratos II is simulated to be launched from Esrange Space Center. Comparing the found footprint with the allowed impact area of Esrange shows that it is unlikely that the studied design is allowed to be launched from this site. By improving the design, it might be possible to reduce the size of the footprint in such an extend that it will fit if nominal flight occurs. Unfortunately, due to the experimental nature of the rocket, Esrange will likely demand that for non-nominal flight too, the footprint has to be in the allowed impact area. It is very unlikely that this is possible for a rocket flying to 50 km. Space EngineeringAerospace Engineerin...|$|E
