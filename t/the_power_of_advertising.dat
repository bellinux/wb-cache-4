The primary purpose of marketing communications is to tell customers about the benefits and values that a product or service offers. Advertising media are the channels of communication through which advertising messages are conveyed. Choosing the best media for an advertising campaign is a critical task, requiring a sound knowledge of the benefits each channel provides for the audiences being targeted and the products being advertised (Arens, 2006).

During an 1887 organizing drive by the Knights of Labor, he simply fired the first twelve union members who were discovered by his detectives. The stores did make noted early efforts to advance the welfare of African-Americans and Native Americans. He was the first retailer to place a half-page newspaper ad (1874) and the first full-page ad (1879). He initially wrote his own ad copy, but later hired the world's first full-time copywriter John Emory Powers. During Powers's tenure, Wanamaker's revenues doubled from $4 million to $8 million.|$|E

Both investigate changing ad values and the ethnic diversity of ad models. Results indicate that the male market is becoming increasingly self-oriented in its values orientation as a result of broad societal changes and chang-ing gender roles. Increasing use of black or African American models in key positions indicates a growing acceptance of minorities as representations of the ideal self among younger men, who express a preference for black or African American models. This finding speaks to the increasingly multicultural nature of society and the impact of minority celebrities on American culture.

40|$|Objective: Health {{advocates have}} focused on the {{prevalence}} <b>of</b> <b>advertising</b> for calorie-dense low-nutrient foods as a significant contributor to the obesity epidemic. This research tests the hypothesis that exposure to food advertising during TV viewing may also contribute to obesity by triggering automatic snacking of available food. Design: In Experiments 1 a and 1 b, elementary-school-age children watched a cartoon that contained either food advertising or advertising for other products and received a snack while watching. In Experiment 2, adults watched a TV program that included food advertising that promoted snacking and/or fun product benefits, food advertising that promoted nutrition benefits, or no food advertising. The adults then tasted and evaluated a range of healthy to unhealthy snack foods in an apparently separate experiment. Main Outcome Measures: Amount of snack foods consumed during and after advertising exposure. Results: Children consumed 45 % more when exposed to food advertising. Adults consumed more of both healthy and unhealthy snack foods following exposure to snack food advertising compared to the other conditions. In both experiments, food <b>advertising</b> increased consumption <b>of</b> products not in the presented advertisements, and these effects were not related to reported hunger or other conscious influences. Conclusion: These experiments demonstrate <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> food <b>advertising</b> to prime automatic eating behaviors and thus influence far more than brand preference alone...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we perform a {{theoretical}} analysis <b>of</b> <b>advertising</b> wars, where 8 ̆ 5 rms engage in deceptive comparative advertising against each other. In a symmetric duopoly set-up with xed market size {{it does not}} matter whether a 8 ̆ 5 rm mentions the rival in an advertisement or not, since in both cases the ad reduces the relative valuation of the competing brand. In contrast, if there are three 8 ̆ 5 rms in the market, comparative advertising exhibits a directional-ity, i. e. a 8 ̆ 5 rm can choose to target just one of its rivals. In symmetric scenarios, where none or all 8 ̆ 5 rms collude, advertising becomes irrelevant in the price equilibrium irrespectively of whether it is comparative or not. This means Prisoners Dilemma. In contrast, if we introduce asymmetry by assuming that two of the three 8 ̆ 5 rms collude, then the fact that advertising is comparative becomes crucial: prices change with <b>the</b> derogatory <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>advertising.</b> More-over, we demonstrate how the fact that advertising be comparative rather than regular a¤ects advertising volume itself: (i) colluding 8 ̆ 5 rms reduce their mutual comparative advertising, (ii) colluding rms increase the advertising against their rival, (iii) the rival intensi 8 ̆ 5 es advertising e¤orts against colluding 8 ̆ 5 rms, and (iv) the 8 ̆ 5 rst e¤ect is stronger than the other two so that the total amount <b>of</b> <b>advertising</b> in the market decreases...|$|R

In Stole’s historical study of the consumer movement, {{beginning in the late}} 1920 s, the traditional distinction between the active democratic citizen and the submissive and feminized consumer melts away. Here, consumerism comes into view less as a predestined ‘way of life ’ than as an activist movement that sought to limit <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>advertising</b> and consumer capitalism in American social life. The story told in the book begins in the period of the 1920 s, when advertising took hold as ‘a dominant force of American life’, one that relied on emotional seduction as its primary approach to public communication. For some Americans, however, advertising was gaining a reputation as an institution that was eroding democratic principles and ideas.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the essence of}} Jean Baudrillard advertising theory positioning, which is the interpretation {{of it as the}} media, which eliminates the possibility of a response that makes it impossible for any process of communicative exchange. This kind of non-communication aims at social control, manipulation and repression. The theoretical bases of formation of the concept of «consumer society» is defined and reveals the role of advertising in today’s consumer discourse. It is shown that modern means of mass communication rapidly affect the society, producing a false reality and alienates individuals from social reality. The concept of «Hyperreality» is considered, which is the area of simulation, which is a mixture of on-screen images and episodes of reality, real and television time, intimate and public life, internal and external, of the social life and imaginary space, as a result it is difficult to distinguish from the true reality. It is proved that the «system of things» of Jean Baudrillard points out that <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>advertising</b> is based on the belief in her from a mass consumers [...] The root of this belief - the so-called «infantile bestowing function», which creates a sense of mythic human involvement, which is in this context belongs to a social nature...|$|E
30|$|It is also {{interesting}} {{to elaborate on}} how distinct communities are brought together to create large connected graphs. Without the connectivity between dense communities, isolated components would not support many of the fascinating phenomena that have been observed, notably the hugely influential small world effect [9], where there exist surprisingly short paths between members of the network located in different communities. By definition, the density of those edges connecting communities {{is less than the}} density of edges within communities. The sparsity of the between-community connectivity is the basis for community separation quality measures such as the modularity index, [10]. The relatively low number of these edges connecting communities together gives them special importance as they are critical for the graph’s connectivity. A recent study explores this network feature using examples from brain connectivity, [11], concluding that connection costs can explain these modular networks. For the applications in OSNs, where companies seek to harness <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> Internet <b>advertising,</b> nodes which offer community traversal connections are critical targets [12]. The aim of this work is therefore to give a simple and scalable methodology for defining and discovering this type of key structural component. For the remainder of this paper an edge connecting two different communities will be referred to as a boundary edge and the nodes on either side of these edges as boundary nodes.|$|R
