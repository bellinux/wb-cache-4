Transmission of viruses can be vertical, which means from mother to child, or horizontal, which means from person to person.

Another, more rare, example is the varicella zoster virus, which, although causing relatively mild infections in humans, can be fatal to the foetus and newborn baby.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with <b>transmission</b> rate <b>and</b> <b>control</b> codesign of wireless sensor networked control systems (WSNCS) with time-varying delay. Jointly designing <b>transmission</b> rate <b>and</b> <b>control</b> is an attractive paradigm for WSNCS, since the control performance of WSNCS is highly sensitive to resource-constrained communication networks. The main idea of devised scheme is searching an optimal event-triggered transmission condition {{on the premise that}} wireless link capacity constraint is satisfied and stability of systems is guaranteed. The main aim of devised scheme is to greatly optimize control performance of WSNCS. First, two wireless network architectures characterized by multihop and star topology are put forward. Secondly, a model of WSNCS with event-triggered transmission mechanism is constructed. It is followed by stability analysis of WSNCS to obtain the asymptotical stability condition of systems. And then a search algorithm is presented for <b>transmission</b> rate <b>and</b> <b>control</b> codesign. Finally, numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method...|$|R

40|$|Large {{amplitude}} vibro-acoustic loads during launch cause 40 % {{of first}} day spacecraft failures. Structural-acoustic control {{offers the potential}} of reducing these loads without increasing payload mass by actively stiffening and destiffening {{the structure of the}} fairing to reduce acoustic <b>transmission</b> <b>and</b> reflection. In this thesis, two methods of structural-acoustic control for launch vehicle fairings are investigated. Both methods employ feedback control using only structural sensors and actuators to obtain global attenuation of the acoustic field within the fairing. This approach avoids the need for sensors and actuators near the payload, and is more effective at reducing the effect of disturbances than feedforward control. The first method implements simultaneous <b>transmission</b> <b>and</b> reflection <b>control</b> on the structure. Individual Linear Quadratic Gaussian controllers are designed for <b>transmission</b> <b>and</b> reflection <b>control</b> <b>and</b> combined using superposition.

40|$|Abstract — Next {{generation}} wireless {{systems will}} be required to support heterogeneous services with different transmission rates that include real time multimedia transmissions, as well as non-real time data transmissions. In order to provide flexible trans-mission rates to each terminal, efficient use of system resources requires transmission rate control in addition to power control. In this paper, we present an algorithm for joint <b>transmission</b> rate <b>and</b> power <b>control</b> based on a non-cooperative game theoretic approach. A new utility function that includes pricing is defined for joint <b>transmission</b> rate <b>and</b> power <b>control,</b> <b>and</b> a detailed analysis of the existence and uniqueness of Nash equilibrium for the non-cooperative joint <b>transmission</b> rate <b>and</b> power <b>control</b> game with pricing is presented. Numerical results obtained from simulations that compare the proposed algorithm with alternative algorithms on joint rate <b>and</b> power <b>control</b> are also presented in the paper. I...|$|R
