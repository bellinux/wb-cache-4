She returned <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>near</b> her mother in Independence, swapping land for a nearby property that became known as the Mrs. Sam Houston House. The Texas legislature eventually gave Margaret an amount equivalent to her husband's unpaid gubernatorial salary; nevertheless, in order to afford Sam Jr.'s enrollment at medical school at the University of Pennsylvania, she rented out the Ben Lomond plantation.|$|E

5|$|While at Hall-Place, Smart {{was sent}} to the local Maidstone Grammar School where he was taught by Charles Walwyn, a scholar from Eton College who had {{received}} an MA from King's College, Cambridge in 1696. It was here that Smart received an intensive education in Latin and Greek. He did not complete his education at Maidstone however, as his father died on 3 February 1733, and his mother took Smart and his siblings <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>near</b> relatives in Durham after selling off {{a large portion of the}} estate to pay off Peter Smart's debts.|$|E
5|$|Following Ruland's {{departure}} in 1863, the Queen {{looked for}} a husband for Helena. However, as a middle child, {{the prospect of a}} powerful alliance with a European royal house was low. Her appearance was also a concern, as by the age of fifteen she was described by her biographer as chunky, dowdy and double-chinned. Furthermore, Victoria insisted that Helena's future husband had to be prepared <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>near</b> the Queen, thus keeping her daughter nearby. Her choice eventually fell on Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein; however, the match was politically awkward, and caused a severe breach within the royal family.|$|E
5|$|The {{grey-necked rockfowl}} (Picathartes oreas) is a {{medium-sized}} {{bird in the}} family Picathartidae with a long neck and tail. Also known as the grey-necked picathartes, this passerine is mainly found in rocky areas of close-canopied rainforest from south-west Nigeria through Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, and south-west Gabon. It additionally lives {{on the island of}} Bioko. Its distribution is patchy, with populations often isolated from each other. The rockfowl typically chooses <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>near</b> streams and inselbergs in its forested habitat. It has no recognized subspecies, though some believe that it forms a superspecies with the white-necked rockfowl. The grey-necked rockfowl has grey upperparts, a light grey breast, and lemon-coloured underparts. Its unusually long tail is used for balance, and its thighs are muscular. The head is nearly featherless, with the exposed skin being powder blue on the forehead and upper mandible and carmine on the hindcrown. The bird’s cheeks and eyes are covered in a large, circular black patch that, though narrow, connects and divides the carmine and powder blue skin {{at the peak of the}} crown. Though the bird is usually silent, some calls are known.|$|E

5|$|While Elaine is {{depressed}} {{about the}} low quality of her apartment, Jerry overhears Harold (Glenn Shadix) and Manny (Tony Plana), {{the managers of}} his apartment building, discussing a death that makes an apartment available. Shocked by the low rent, Jerry immediately tells Elaine {{that he will be}} able to get her the apartment above his. She is extremely excited to hear this, as she will be able <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>near</b> Jerry. Though excited at first, Jerry later realizes how intrusive Elaine might become, and that living with her might get annoying. He discusses his problem with George, but the topic of their conversation changes and they eventually talk about wearing a wedding ring to a party, to see how women will react. George dislikes the idea at first, but eventually borrows one from Jerry's neighbor Kramer (Michael Richards) to experiment.|$|E
5|$|After {{turning down}} {{potential}} transfers to West Ham and Torquay, because {{neither he nor}} his wife wanted to live in either place, Irvine decided to sign for Third Division outfit Halifax Town in December 1972. Despite taking a considerable pay cut, he chose Halifax to enable his family to return <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>near</b> Burnley. Irvine made a total of 11 first-team appearances for Halifax Town, scoring one goal for the club. He played his last competitive game for the club in the 1–0 win against York City on 13 March 1973, after manager George Mulhall accused Irvine of not trying and not deserving his wage. At the end of the 1972–73 season, the team avoided relegation to the Fourth Division on goal difference. After failing to report for the away game at Walsall on 1May 1973, to play in a testimonial match for Burnley defender John Angus, he was fined two weeks' wages and forced into extra training sessions. In the summer of 1973, Irvine left Halifax Town by mutual consent, his professional football career over at the age of 29. Despite having the option to sign for Rochdale, he joined semi-professional side Great Harwood, who played in the Northern Premier League. At Great Harwood, he played alongside two former Burnley teammates; goalkeeper Adam Blacklaw and midfielder Les Latcham. Irvine remained at the club for a number of months, before leaving midway through the 1973–74 season and retiring from football altogether.|$|E

25|$|Honey is a known dietary {{reservoir}} of C. botulinum spores {{and has been}} linked to infant botulism. For this reason honey is not recommended for infants less than one year of age. Most cases of infant botulism, however, are thought to be caused by acquiring the spores from the natural environment. Clostridium botulinum is a ubiquitous soil-dwelling bacterium. Many infant botulism patients have been demonstrated <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>near</b> a construction site or an area of soil disturbance.|$|E
25|$|The {{changing}} climate {{forced the}} Inuit {{to work their}} way south, forcing them into marginal niches along the edges of the tree line.

There is evidence that they were still moving into new territory in southern Labrador when they first began to interact with Europeans in the 17th century.|$|E
