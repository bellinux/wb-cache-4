5000|$|In Sec. 6.1 of {{the book}} {{has been shown that}} the traffic phase {{definitions}} S and J are the origin of most hypotheses of three-phase theory and related three-phase microscopic traffic flow models. The traffic phase definitions J and S are non-local macroscopic ones and they are applicable only after macroscopic data has been measured in space and time, i.e., in an [...] "off-line" [...] study. This is because for the definitive distinction of the phases J and S through the definitions J and S a study of the propagation of traffic congestion through a bottleneck is necessary. This is often considered as a drawback of the traffic phase definitions S and J. However, there are local microscopic criteria for the distinction between the phases J and S without a study of the propagation of congested traffic through a bottleneck. The microscopic criteria are as follows (see Sec. 2.6 in the book): If in single-vehicle (microscopic) data related to congested traffic the [...] "flow-interruption interval", i.e., a <b>time</b> <b>headway</b> between two vehicles following each other is observed, which is much longer than the mean time delay in vehicle acceleration from a wide moving jam (the latter is about 1.3-2.1 s), then the related flow-interruption interval corresponds to the wide moving jam phase. After all wide moving jams have been found through this criterion in congested traffic, all remaining congested states are related to the synchronized flow phase.|$|E

This study is to develop the <b>time</b> <b>headway</b> distribution model and subsequently to determine lionk-road capacity in the city of Denpasar, Bali Province. The study consists of <b>time</b> <b>headway</b> data analysis, model calibration and validation and road capacity values??determination.

40|$|Coupling {{of motor}} {{vehicles}} {{in form of}} automatic highway systems (AHS) is already a realistic futurescenario, systems that automate parts of the driving task are almost common practice. The (notional) effects of full automated truck convoys were analysed and discussed within an interdisciplinary project named EFAS at RWTH-Aachen. Focal point {{of the project was}} how coupling of truck convoys can be implemented on German roads taking into account the new task demands of the truck driver. Part of the new task will be the persistent confrontation with highly small gaps during automated driving periods. The distance between participating motor vehicles of the convoy is declared by less than ten meters when driving with 100 km/h (0, 3 sec). Common <b>time</b> <b>headways</b> are 1, 0 sec; the German law recommends <b>time</b> <b>headways</b> of 1, 8 sec. Driving with small gaps of the mentioned size has not been experienced by the driver yet. Thus, we addressed the consequences for non automated manual driving after driving in electronic coupled convoys. Three studies in a passenger car driving simulator were accomplished. As expected, we found risky driving behaviour in form of choosing too short <b>time</b> <b>headways.</b> Driving with small gaps {{as a consequence of the}} coupling period may be mediated by means of several factors and may involve different psychological processes: Coupling with short gaps over time may mediate the effect. The coupling and decoupling procedure itself may also have a short term effect. In addition, coupling per se may have its own effects. The nature of the effects is of great interest: are the effects short-lived and transient or stable, are they rather perceptually or rather response-based? Answers on these questions are necessary for implementing adequate risk preventing solution within MMI.

We consider initial condition problems with unidirectional nearest neighbour communications, using only linear systems with two integrators in the loop. We define string stability {{as a type}} of stability that is uniform with respect to the string length.

However, the minimum <b>time</b> <b>headway,</b> a relevant indicator of safe driving, did change while processing incoming information (F 1, 22)[*]=[*] 5.1, P[*]<[*] 0.034, while a significant interaction with traffic density (F(1, 22)[*]=[*] 5.8, P[*]<[*] 0.024) indicates that only in the busy traffic condition minimum <b>time</b> <b>headway</b> increased, from [...]. 70  s to [...]. 93  s.

In order to interpret and to distinguish the different contexts and behaviors, the composite <b>time</b> <b>headway</b> distribution Generalized Queuing Model and the best simple model, the Log-normal Model, are calibrated.

The results show a significant goodness-of-fit of the composite <b>time</b> <b>headway</b> distributions with most samples.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{guarantee}} safety, drivers {{are advised to}} keep large enough headways. However, headway advice is often provided in terms of <b>time</b> <b>headway,</b> without knowing whether {{this is the right}} way of presenting the advice. According to a psychophysics theory, attaining a <b>time</b> <b>headway</b> would indeed allow drivers to show higher headway choice accuracy compared to distance headway. The goal {{of the present study was}} to assess whether <b>time</b> <b>headway</b> instructions lead to more accurate headway choice compared to distance headway instructions, and whether this depends on vehicle speed and headway size. Two groups of twenty participants carried out headway instructions in a driving simulator (one <b>time</b> <b>headway</b> group and one distance headway group). Target headway size (1, 1. 5 and 2 s) and vehicle speed (50, 80 and 100 km/h) were varied within participants. Absolute estimation errors (absolute difference between instructed and chosen headway) indicated a reduced accuracy for higher speeds and for larger target headways, for both time and distance headway instructions. Relative estimation errors (relative difference between instructed and chosen headways, representing a difference between under and over estimations) indicated a difference between time and distance headway instructions. Participants showed larger headways than instructed with higher speeds in case of the distance headway instructions. These results suggest that (a) <b>time</b> <b>headway</b> choice is not independent of vehicle speed thereby contradicting the predictions made by psychophysics theory; (b) relative and absolute estimation errors as the dependent variable produce dissimilar results; (c) in case of distance headway instructions, drivers choose smaller than instructed headways at higher vehicle speed...|$|E
40|$|Problem: The Adaptive Cruise Control is an Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) {{that allows}} {{maintaining}} given headway and speed, according to settings pre-defined by the users. Despite {{the potential benefits}} associated to the utilization of ACC, previous studies warned against negative behavioral adaptations that might occur while driving with the system activated. Unfortunately, up to now, there are no unanimous results about the effects induced by the usage of ACC on speed and <b>time</b> <b>headway</b> to the vehicle in front. Also, few studies were performed including actual users of ACC among the subjects. Objectives: This research aimed to investigate {{the effect of the}} experience gained with ACC on speed and <b>time</b> <b>headway</b> for a group of users of the system. In addition, it explored the impact of ACC usage on speed and <b>time</b> <b>headway</b> for ACC users and regular drivers. Method: A matched sample driving simulator study was planned as a two-way (2 x 2) repeated measures mixed design, with the experience with ACC as between-subjects factor and the driving condition (with ACC and manually) as within-subjects factor. Results: The results show that the usage of ACC brought a small but not significant reduction of speed and, especially, the maintenance of safer time headways, being the latter result greater for ACC users, probably as a consequence of their experience in using the system. Summary: The usage of ACC did not cause any negative behavioral adaptations to the system regarding speed and <b>time</b> <b>headway.</b> Practical applications: Based on this research work, the Adaptive Cruise Control showed the potential to improve road safety for what concerns the speed and the <b>time</b> <b>headway</b> maintained by the drivers. The speed of the surrounding traffic and the minimum <b>time</b> <b>headway</b> settable through the ACC seem to have an important effect on the road safety improvement achievable with the system.

40|$|In road traffic, {{the advice}} is to {{maintain}} a minimum distance of two seconds to the vehicle in front.

The lookout of the current study was, therefore, to investigate the appropriate headway distribution model on such roads under mixed traffic.|$|R
