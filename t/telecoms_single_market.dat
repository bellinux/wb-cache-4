5000|$|On 19 December 2009, the {{so-called}} [...] "Telecoms Package" [...] came into force and EU member states {{were required to}} implement the Directive by May 2011. According to the European Commission the new transparency requirements in the Telecoms Package would mean that [...] "consumers will be informed—even before signing a contract—about {{the nature of the}} service to which they are subscribing, including traffic management techniques and their impact on service quality, as well as any other limitations (such as bandwidth caps or available connection speed)". Regulation (EC) No 1211/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2009 established the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC) and the Office Body of European Regulators of Electronic Communications. BEREC's main purpose is to promote cooperation between national regulatory authorities, ensuring a consistent application of the EU regulatory framework for electronic communications.The European Parliament voted the EU Commission's September 2013 proposal on its first reading in April 2014 and the Council adopted a mandate to negotiate in March 2015. Following the adoption of the Digital Single Market Strategy by the Commission on 6 May, Heads of State and Government agreed on the need to strengthen the EU <b>telecoms</b> <b>single</b> <b>market.</b> After 18 months of negotiations, the European Parliament, Council and Commission reached two agreements on the end to roaming charges and on the first EU-wide rules on net neutrality on 30 June 2015, to be completed by an overhaul of EU telecoms rules in 2016. Specifically, article 3 of EU Regulation 2015/2120 sets the basic framework for ensuring net neutrality across the entire European Union. However, the regulation's text has been criticized as offering loopholes that can undermine the regulation's effectiveness. Some EU member states, such as Slovenia and the Netherlands, have stronger net neutrality laws.|$|E
40|$|A European {{debate over}} {{measures}} ostensibly to fully achieve a single market for electronic communications across the EU {{was brought to}} a head by the European Commission 2 ̆ 019 s 2013 proposed <b>Telecoms</b> <b>Single</b> <b>Market</b> (TSM) legislative package. The Commission apparently hoped to achieve a Single European Market for electronic communications solely by means of regulatory harmonisation. The Commission 2 ̆ 019 s proposal can {{serve as the basis}} for important reflections on harmonisation at European level. Why do we seek regulatory harmonisation? How does harmonisation differ from uniformity? What benefits flow from centralisation, and what benefits from decentralisation? Is the European Union in fact a Union? To what extent do the Member States differ from one another in ways that are not readily altered in the near term? What economic consequences (beyond those already achieved by the current regulatory framework) might be expected from more extensive harmonisation of European electronic communication? What do these considerations tell us about the degree of harmonisation that is desirable, and the degree that is realistically achievable? The approach taken in this paper can help to clarify thinking as to costs and benefits of stronger harmonisation or centralisation of electronic communications regulation, but we do not claim that we have evaluated every regulatory possibility, nor that our assessment is definitive. It is a thought exercise that is meant to help clarify the bounds to what can be achieved solely by means of regulatory harmonisation...|$|E
40|$|Notwithstanding the undeniable {{success of}} {{telecoms}} liberalisation {{in terms of}} price reduction, new services and technologies as well as consumer satisfaction, EU telecoms policy {{is at least a}} half failure. This might seem hard to believe, but we show in this paper {{that there is no such}} thing as an EU <b>telecoms</b> (or eComms) <b>single</b> <b>market.</b> We provide ample empirical economic and regulatory evidence of profound and lingering fragmentation as well as a brief assessment of the flaws of the eComms package as amended in 2009, and recently entered into force. Overcoming the fragmentation cannot but yield a considerable welfare improvement for the Union, which is exactly what a <b>single</b> <b>market</b> should be expected to deliver. Doing away with the flaws in the EU system requires a better institutional design. We wonder whether the regulatory (and competition policy) approach is really suitable for the Union and whether the fundamental conflict between the EU constitutional doctrine and the building of the <b>single</b> <b>market</b> (just as much a constitutional duty!) should not be resolved in novel ways...|$|R
40|$|Network Neutrality (NN) {{refers to}} the {{principle}} whereby all electronic communication should be treated in a non-discriminatory way, regardless of their type, content, origin or destination.

At the European level, the European Parliament has explicitly recognized the importance to enshrine the NN principle into legislation to promote the establishment of a European Digital <b>Single</b> <b>Market.</b> To this extent, the European Commission recently proposed a Regulation for a <b>Single</b> <b>Telecoms</b> <b>Market</b> (September 2013) aimed at securing NN by precluding Internet Service Providers (ISPs) from discriminating against specific services, content or applications - while nonetheless allowing them to enter into contractual agreements to provide certain content and applications providers (CAPs) with enhanced quality of service...|$|R
40|$|This thesis aims {{to study}} why some Member States are more {{efficient}} in mediating the negotiations during the Presidency of the Council of the European Union than others. To {{fill the gap}} in current academic research, the emphasis is put on how the model of coordination between the presiding country’s capital and Permanent Representation in Brussels affects {{the performance of the}} Presidency. Rational choice institutionalism provides the opportunity to conceptualise efficiency of the Presidency as the advancement of the negotiations on a priority initiative, rather than protection of national preferences as defined conventionally. The principal-agent model offers the necessary analytical tools to examine different models of coordination for European Union policies. This theoretical approach provides also the adequate analytical tools to study the link between model of coordination and efficiency of the Presidency, leading to the hypothesis that Brusselsbased Presidencies are more efficient in leading the negotiations on a priority initiative than the Presidencies that have adopted capital-based models. In the empirical part of the study qualitative comparative method is used to compare the performance of Italian and Latvian Presidencies in advancing the negotiations on <b>Telecom</b> <b>Single</b> <b>Market</b> proposal. The analysis of written documents and input from interviews indicate quite clearly that Latvian Presidency was much more efficient in its role as the mediator of the negotiations on this dossier. The findings also demonstrate that there is significant variation in the adopted model of coordination. Whereas Italy opted for a capital-based Presidency, Latvian Presidency was Brussels-based. To large extent the assumptions presented in the theoretical part of the thesis were confirmed. The Latvian Brussels-based Presidency was able to make decisions much faster and on spot, whereas Italian Permanent Representation had to endure extensive interventions from the capital, which made the progress slower. The findings also indicate that Latvian Presidency was able to act as an “honest broker” and go beyond its national preferences in order to reach a compromise. Additionally, it was confirmed that Brussels-based model enables better cooperation with other actors due to higher level of trust. However, the premise that the Brussels-based Presidency is more efficient due to better cooperation with the Council Secretariat was not proven. All in all the findings of the study show that the main hypothesis is correct and Brussels-based Presidencies are more efficient in advancing the negotiations on priority initiative...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIs a European {{spectrum}} policy a pre-requisite to the <b>single</b> <b>market?</b> Or, conversely, is the <b>single</b> <b>market</b> a pre-requisite to a European spectrum policy? The {{answer to}} this question leads to a different choice of regulatory system. Enforcing a European spectrum policy to build a <b>single</b> <b>market</b> should deeply change the institutional design of European Regulation: a transfer of power from the Member States to the Commission will be necessary to create a European Regulator. This choice can theoretically prevent fragmentation of the <b>single</b> <b>market</b> by ensuring a harmonised management of spectrum throughout Europe. Adopting a more liberal point of view will leave the power of structuring the <b>single</b> <b>market</b> to the market forces. However, reaching a <b>single</b> <b>market</b> means consolidation of the sector: either by mergers and acquisitions or by allowing some agreements between operators. This consolidation is anyway on its way. The strategic use of competition policy and a lighter sector-specific regulation can orientate the operators towards the creation of a <b>single</b> <b>market.</b> Once the <b>single</b> <b>market</b> will be mature enough, the operators will undeniably ask for a European-wide band of spectrum to facilitate their undertaking and to stabilize their business model...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyse the effects of the {{implementation}} of the <b>Single</b> <b>Market</b> and to propose ideas on how its potential can be better revitalized in times of economic crisis. First, the paper offers a broader perspective to the analysis of the <b>Single</b> <b>Market</b> by exploring its close links to the rapidly changing economic environment due to the global economic crisis. Second, it puts together a comprehensive body of empirical evidence, based on the analysis of EU FDI flows and trade in services which allows for a thorough analysis of what has been achieved in terms of European economic integration. Overall the paper concludes that the <b>Single</b> <b>Market</b> is a powerful instrument to promote economic integration and to increase competition within the EU and that it has been the source of large macro-economic benefits.
