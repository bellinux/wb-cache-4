50|$|Tendon {{encapsulation}} {{systems are}} constructed from plastic or galvanised steel materials, and are classified into two main types: those where the <b>tendon</b> <b>element</b> is subsequently bonded {{to the surrounding}} concrete by internal grouting of the duct after stressing (bonded post-tensioning); and those where the <b>tendon</b> <b>element</b> is permanently debonded from the surrounding concrete, usually {{by means of a}} greased sheath over the tendon strands (unbonded post-tensioning).|$|E
50|$|Unbonded {{post-tensioning}} {{differs from}} bonded post-tensioning {{by allowing the}} tendons permanent freedom of longitudinal movement relative to the concrete. This is most commonly achieved by encasing each individual <b>tendon</b> <b>element</b> within a plastic sheathing filled with a corrosion-inhibiting grease, usually lithium based. Anchorages {{at each end of}} the tendon transfer the tensioning force to the concrete, and are required to reliably perform this role for the life of the structure.|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{non-linear}} vibrations of long span cables present a considerable problem of lightweight structures like suspended roofs, cable stayed bridges and cable stayed masts. In the analysis of global structural behaviour, cables are often modelled as equivalent <b>tendon</b> <b>elements.</b> The importance of modelling coupled cable-structure dynamics has been demonstrated by a number of researchers. Dynamic response of non-linear systems can lead to internal or auto-parametric resonance in the case of integer frequency ratio. The analysis of cable-stayed system frequency spectra can show parameter values for which integer frequency ratio condition is fulfilled. In this paper an analytic model of simplified cable-stayed system is formulated. Parabolic cable is modelled using the assumption of quasi-static stretching, while the structure is modelled as Euler-Bernoulli beam. Equations of motions are derived by Hamilton’s principle and then linearized around a static equilibrium configuration. Differential equations of motion are solved by the method of variable separation. System deformation is described using analytical functions. Equations of motions together with boundary conditions are solved in closed form to obtain a characteristic equation. For chosen system parameters, the eigenvalue spectra are determined. Parametric analysis of dynamical properties is carried out and integer frequency ratios along with the associated modes are pointed out. Analytic solutions are verified with finite element modelling...|$|R
40|$|Some time ago, we have {{developed}} a computer programme called PRECON 3 D for a three-dimensional non-linear analysis of reinforced and prestressed concrete structures where the structures are discretized by three-dimensional finite elements with an embedded one-dimensional element of reinforcement and prestressed tendons. Non-linear triaxial behaviour of concrete {{is involved in the}} material model, including all dominant influences in concrete (yielding in compression, fracture in tension, softening and hardening). The non-linear behaviour of reinforcement and prestressed tendons is described by the one-dimensional elasto-viscoplastic model. The <b>tendon</b> <b>element</b> geometry is described by the second order space function which is determined by its projections. Programme PRECON 3 D can be used very simple because the material model is defined by elementary material parameters (Young’s modulus, Poisson’s coefficient, maximal uniaxial tensile and compression stresses, coefficient of tensile correction, maximal tensile and maximal compression strains). Furthermore, the developed model makes it possible to compute prestressing structures in phases including losses caused by friction and the losses which result from the concrete deformation. In the described analyses we have performed the numerical testing of the prestressed concrete girders from the engineering practice (prefabricated element), which were reinforced with various cross-sectional area of prestressed reinforcement and various tendons geometry. During analyses next parameters were observed: deflections of the girders, concrete stresses and strains at {{the top and bottom of}} the girders, compressive and tensile strains of the reinforcement. The paper presents the structural validation of developed numerical model, PRECON 3 D, on a few examples and the obtained results are compared with the known numerical and experimental ones. It is concluded that the presented programme and numerical model can be effectively used in nonlinear analysis of reinforced and prestressed concrete structures...|$|E
40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this article is}} to investigate the response of a CANDU® 1 nuclear power plant containment structure to a much higher internal pressure that could be encountered during a severe accident. In this study, for the prestressed containment structure, a detailed model is obtained by a full 3 D model. Nonlinear finite element method is employed to predict the response of the structure using ANSYS software. The major challenges for modelling prestressing <b>tendon</b> <b>elements</b> are to accommodate parameters affecting prestressing forces. In previous research studies, the prestressing system is modelled using an equivalent pressure and tendon end forces, and tendons are modelled as smeared reinforcement in the concrete elements. In this study, the prestressing tendons are modelled using discrete elements. This method enables the capability of the model to update the prestressing forces accommodating the non-uniform losses. The difference in the response of the structure using the discrete model for the prestressing tendons and the smeared approach is 15 percent. It is observed that the containment structure, meets the design requirements of the current standards as it behaves linearly up to 1. 5 times the design pressure, and the ultimate pressure capacity is estimated as 2. 7 times the design pressure. The ultimate pressure capacity is reached when the prestressing tendon rupture at the dome...|$|R
40|$|The present paper {{deals with}} {{experimental}} and numerical {{investigations of the}} static and impact behaviours of railway prestressed concrete sleepers under static and dynamic loads. A three-dimensional nonlinear finite element model of a prestressed concrete sleeper was developed using the general purpose finite element package, ANSYS 10. The model was initially validated against static test results. Using SOLID 65 solid element, the compressive crushing of concrete is facilitated using plasticity algorithm while the concrete cracking in tension zone is accommodated by the nonlinear material model. Since the cross section of concrete sleeper is fully pre-stressed, the smeared crack analogy is impracticable. Discrete reinforcement modelling with truss elements, LINK 8, is then more suitable to utilize.

Comparison with experimental static load-deflection response is presented for the prestressed concrete sleeper. Through the linkage between ANSYS and LS-Dyna, the finite element model was subsequently extended to account for ballast support and in-situ conditions {{for use in the}} impact analysis. The calibration of the extended model was successfully achieved by using vibration data. Drop-weight impact tests were carried out in the identical setup for verifications of the impact model.

40|$|The {{glycosaminoglycan}} (GAG) side-chains {{of small}} leucine-rich proteoglycans have been postulated to mechanically cross-link adjacent collagen fibrils {{and contribute to}} tendon mechanics. Enzymatic depletion of tendon GAGs (chondroitin and dermatan sulfate) {{has emerged as a}} preferred method to experimentally assess this role. However, GAG removal is typically incomplete and the possibility remains that extant GAGs may remain mechanically functional. The current study specifically investigated the potential mechanical effect of the remaining GAGs after partial enzymatic digestion. A three-dimensional finite <b>element</b> model of <b>tendon</b> was created based upon the concept of proteoglycan mediated inter-fibril load sharing. Approximately 250 interacting, discontinuous collagen fibrils were modeled as having a length of 400 μm, being composed of rod elements of length 67 nm and E-modulus 1 GPa connected in series. Spatial distribution and diameters of these idealized fibrils were derived from a representative cross-sectional electron micrograph of <b>tendon.</b> Rod <b>element</b> lengths corresponded to the collagen fibril D-Period, widely accepted to act as a binding site for decorin and biglycan, the most abundant proteoglycans in <b>tendon.</b> Each <b>element</b> node was connected to nodes of any neighboring fibrils within a radius of 100 nm, the slack length of unstretched chondroitin sulfate. These GAG cross-links were the sole mechanism for lateral load sharing among the discontinuous fibrils, and were modeled as bilinear spring elements. Simulation of tensile testing of tendon with complete cross-linking closely reproduced corresponding experiments on rat tail tendons. Random reduction of 80 % of GAG cross-links (matched to a conservative estimate of enzymatic depletion efficacy) predicted a drop of 14 % in tendon modulus. Corresponding mechanical properties derived from experiments on rat tail tendons treated in buffer with and without chondroitinase ABC were apparently unaffected, regardless of GAG depletion. Further tests for equivalence, conservatively based on effect size limits predicted by the model, confirmed equivalent stiffness between enzymatically depleted tendons and their native controls. Although the model predicts that relatively small quantities of GAGs acting as primary collagen cross-linking elements could provide mechanical integrity to the tendon, partial enzymatic depletion of GAGs should result in mechanical changes that are not reflected in analogous experimental testing. We thus conclude that GAG side chains of small leucine-rich proteoglycans are not a primary determinant of tensile mechanical behavior in mature rat tail tendons...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Limb {{development}} and patterning originate from a complex interplay between the skeletal <b>elements,</b> <b>tendons,</b> and {{muscles of the}} limb. One of the genes involved in patterning of limb muscles is the homeobox transcription factor Pitx 2 but its role in forelimb development is uncharacterized. Pitx 2 is expressed {{in the majority of}} premature presumptive forelimb musculature at embryonic day 12. 5 and then maintained throughout embryogenesis to adult skeletal muscle. Results To further study the role of Pitx 2 in forelimb development we have generated transgenic mice that exhibit a pulse of PITX 2 over-expression at embryonic day 13. 5 and 14. 5 in the developing forelimb mesenchyme. These mice exhibit a distal misplacement of the biceps brachii insertion during embryogenesis, which twists the forelimb musculature resulting in severe skeletal malformations. The skeletal malformations have some similarities to the forearm deformities present in Leri-Weill dyschondrosteosis. Conclusion Taken together, the tendon, muscle, and bone anomalies further support a role of Pitx 2 in forelimb {{development and}} may also shed light on the interaction between the skeletal elements and muscles of the limb during embryogenesis. </p...|$|R
40|$|An {{iterative}} statistical identification method, {{based on}} Bayesian approach, {{was used to}} identify the actual stiffness and prestressing force of a prestressed simply supported beam with unbonded curved <b>tendons.</b> A finite <b>element</b> model, with consistent mass matrix, was used as analytical model and the first three natural frequencies of the beam were used as experimental modal parameters. Because the procedure involves inversion of matrices, the ill-conditioning {{of the problem was}} also investigated. The aim {{of this paper is to}} identify a reliable model of a prestressed beam which represents very well the real structure by identifying the stiffness parameters and the prestressing force. This model can be used, then, as a reference model to detect damage or loss of prestressing force. It was seen that the accuracy of the identified parameters and the rate of convergence are highly influenced by the coefficients of variation assigned to the various parameters. The effect of the uncertainties associated with the physical and experimental parameters on the accuracy of the identification results was illustrated by some graphics and tables. Other graphics and tables show the utility of the improved statistical identification method to accelerate the convergence of the identified parameters...|$|R
40|$|Many {{studies have}} been {{performed}} on the structure, molecular composition, and biochemical properties of tendons. However, comparatively {{little research has been}} conducted on the content of various trace <b>elements</b> within <b>tendons.</b> Six <b>elements</b> were analyzed in four regions of the peroneus longus tendon: the tensional part of the tendon immediately proximal to the lateral malleolus (region A), the compressive region of the tendon in contact with the lateral malleolus (region B), the compressive region of the tendon in contact with the deep surface of the cuboid (region C), and the tensional part of the tendon between the cuboid and first metatarsal, to which the tendon is attached (region D). Regions B and C are wraparound regions. The calcium content was higher in region C (2. 10 [*]±[*] 0. 93 mg/g) than in both regions A (1. 25 [*]±[*] 0. 51 mg/g) and D (1. 43 [*]±[*] 0. 41 mg/g) (p[*]<[*] 0. 05), indicating that it is likely related to regional differences in cartilage degeneration. The phosphorus content was also higher in region C, possibly because of low alkaline phosphatase activity in this region. The sulfur content was higher in the wraparound regions (region B: 0. 98 [*]±[*] 0. 09 mg/g, region C: 1. 24 [*]±[*] 0. 19 mg/g) than in both regions A (0. 83 [*]±[*] 0. 11 mg/g) and D (0. 83 [*]±[*] 0. 1 mg/g) (p[*]<[*] 0. 01); sulfur content is thought to be influenced by tendon–bone compression. Finally, the magnesium content in the wraparound regions was also higher, which is probably related to a higher level of fibrocartilage. No significant relationships were found with regard to zinc or iron. Overall, the findings of the present study indicate that element contents are related to function and anatomical differences in tendons, and that they may even vary within the same tendon. 博士（医学）・乙第 1342 号・平成 26 年 7 月 22 日The original publication is available at www. springerlink. comThe definitive version is available at " [URL]...|$|R

40|$|The {{regulatory}} mechanisms {{involved in}} tendon homeostasis and repair {{are not fully}} understood. Accumulating data, however, demonstrate that the nervous system, in addition to afferent (sensory) functions, through efferent neuronal pathways plays {{an active role in}} regulating pain, inflammation, and tissue repair processes. Thus, in normal-, healing- and tendinopathic tendons three major neuronal signalling pathways consisting of autonomic, sensory and glutamatergic neuromediators have been established. In healthy <b>tendons,</b> these neural <b>elements</b> are found in the paratenon, whereas the proper tendon is practically devoid of nerves, reflecting that normal tendon homeostasis is regulated by pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators from the tendon surroundings. During tendon repair, however, there is extensive nerve ingrowth into the tendon proper and subsequent time-dependent appearance of sensory, autonomic and glutamatergic mediators, which amplify and fine-tune inflammation and tendon regeneration. In tendinopathy, excessive and protracted sensory and glutamatergic signalling may be involved in inflammatory, painful and hypertrophic tissue reactions. As our understanding of these processes improves, neuronal mediators may prove to be useful in the development of targeted pharmacotherapy and tissue engineering approaches to painful, degenerative and traumatic tendon disorders.

40|$|The {{key element}} of robot is its gripper system, which can {{accommodate}} a variety of work pieces. Two finger grippers sometimes of lever type, cam type, gear type or mixed type are very common for many industrial applications. The present paper aims at the design and development of a four-fingered dextrous gripper with suitable electrical actuator system for transferring and transmitting flexural motions of the articulated fingers with suitable mechanical structures and <b>tendons.</b> Various hardware <b>elements</b> have been designed, constructed and evaluated for the dextrous hand. Each finger is having distal, proximal and metacarpophalangeal joints having three degrees of freedom so as to open and close with different postures for manipulating the objects with electric tendon actuation system. As a first step towards achieving pretension, optimal flexibility, high performance and well-behaved characteristics of the gripper, a multiple degree-of-freedom dextrous hand has been designed, constructed and evaluated. Various tactile and non-tactile sensors have been designed and mounted on the fingers with necessary control.

40|$|Several {{types of}} {{equilibrium}} point (EP) controllers {{have been proposed}} for the control of posture and movement. EP controllers are appealing from a computational perspective {{because they do not}} require solving the "inverse dynamic problem" (i. e., computation of the torques required to move a system along a desired trajectory). It has been argued that EP controllers are not capable of controlling fast single-joint movements. To refute this statement, several extensions have been proposed, although these have been tested using models in which only the tendon compliance, force-length-velocity relation, and mechanical interaction between <b>tendon</b> and contractile <b>element</b> were not adequately represented. In the present study, fast elbow-joint movements were measured and an attempt was made to reproduce these using a realistic musculoskeletal model of the human arm. Three types of EP controllers were evaluated: an open-loop α-controller, a closed-loop λ-controller, and a hybrid open- and closed-loop controller. For each controller we considered a continuous version and a version in which the control signals were sent out intermittently. Only the intermittent hybrid EP controller was capable of generating movements that were as fast as those of the subjects. As a result of the nonlinear muscle properties, the hybrid EP controller requires a more detailed representation of static muscle properties than generally assumed in the context of EP control. In sum, this study shows that fast single-joint movements can be realized without explicitly solving the inverse dynamics problem, but in a less straightforward manner than implied by proponents of conventional EP controllers.

AMR BAZ (ref l) details the work in which SMA is embedded in sleeves located at the neutral planes and arranged parallel to the longitudinal axis of the composite beam. Here {{emphasis is placed on}} describing quasi-static theory of shape control and implementation of this theory to composites incorporated with SMA. Emphasis has been placed on full utilization of shape memory effect without compromising on structural stiffness of the composite beam. Koryo Miura et a 1 (ref. 2) explain about adaptive structures and their use in aerospace applications. Here a variable geometry (VG) truss concept is presented. Comparison is made between tetrahedral and octahedral truss elements. Since octahedral is richer in symmetry, it is considered to be adequate for adaptive structures. DC motor is used as an actuator. It is shown that VG truss is the basic form of adaptive structures. The basic formulations for its geometrical as well as vibrational properties are established. Some applications such as second generation manipulator arm, support architecture for a space station and others are discussed here. Deepak. S. Ramrakhyani et a 1 (ref. 3) explains about the use of compliant cellular truss where tendons are used as active <b>elements.</b> This <b>tendon</b> actuated <b>elements</b> can be used for local or global shape changes. Here an octahedral unit cell is developed for bending deformations and compliant joints are made of cylindrical elements of superelastic shape memory alloys. Several concepts of morphing skin were also presented. Tendon actuators are presently under development. The tendons could be actuated locally or combined from a remote location such as the root of the wing. Since we are looking for large deflection of thin beams we have deliberately embedded the SMA wires off the neutral axis of the beam. In the literatures there is hardly any material that deals with this type of an approach. In this the effect of embedding the thermal SMA wires off the neutral plane of thin beams was studied. These wires were prestrained and embedded off the neutral axis to produce high amount of recovery forces when electrically energized. Superelastic SMA (SESMA) wires were used {{on the other side of}} the beam so as to increase the spring back effect of the beam when de-energized. Thus we were able to obtain large deflection together with faster return back to original position when de-energized...|$|R

Material and methods: the authors identified 135 homogeneous patients with whiplash grade 1 - 2 of the Quebec Task Force classification (QTFC). INAIL, the Italian National Workers Insurance, based in Milan, was reliable source for identifying patients. All patients with whiplash injuries grade 1 or 2 QTFC, were eligible for the study, starting from April 28 2010 to September 30 2010. Patients referred to a Coordinator (C.

Dates for initial treatment session were arranged, including cervical spine X-ray, and assessment. Each patient gave informed consent for participation and agreed to adopt only the study treatment for 6 weeks. Group A (84 patients) was treated with High Power Laser Therapy (HPLT), Group B (51 patients) received conventional simple segmental physical rehabilitation (PT). During the treatment period, no other electro-medical therapy, analgesics or anti-inflammatory drugs were allowed. All patients were assessed at baseline (T 0) and at the end of the treatment period (T 1) using a Visual Analogical Scale (VAS), (T 2) the date of return to work was registered afterwards.

40|$|The {{deterioration}} of concrete bridges {{has been a}} major concern for structural engineers especially with regard to deterioration caused by the corrosion of steel reinforcement. One of the promising avenues to overcome this problem is {{to take advantage of the}} non corrosive characteristic of the Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) bars in reinforcing and/or prestressing concrete bridges. In addition FRP bars have high specific strength, i. e., strength to weight ratio, when compared to conventional steel. Using FRP bars in a combined system of internal prestressing and external post-tensioning provides a potential solution to increase the service life of concrete bridges. However, due to the difference in the mechanical properties between FRP tendons and steel, the flexural behavior of beams prestressed and post-tensioned with internally bonded and externally unbonded carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) tendons is different when compared with the behavior of beams prestressed with conventional steel bars and/or tendons. Also, as these beams can be post-tensioned with unbonded tendons the deflection of the whole system becomes a controlling parameter in the analysis. An analytical model has been developed to examine the behavior of beams prestressed and post-tensioned with CFRP <b>tendons.</b> First, finite <b>element</b> analysis has been carried out to calibrate the tension stiffening characteristic of concrete in order to take into consideration the difference in the bond behavior between CFRP tendons and steel for beams prestressed with bonded tendons. The calibrated tension stiffening is used in the analytical model for the proper modeling of the cross-section curvatures and deflection calculations. Three analytical approaches that account for the tension stiffening of concrete in indirect approaches were also applied to examine the change in the post-tensioning force and were compared with the analytical model. These approaches use the ACI 440. 4 R- 04 committee recommendation, ISIS equation and CEIB-FIP code approach to evaluate the effective moment of inertia used in beam deflection. Furthermore, results from two experimental programs were used to validate the proposed analysis. The first experimental program tested a full scale Double-Tee beam (DT-beam) prestressed and post-tensioned with CFRP tendons, and was conducted at Construction Technology Laboratories, Skokie, Illinois. This beam is a replica of the beams used in the superstructure of the 2 ̆ 2 Bridge Street Bridge 2 ̆ 2 constructed over the Rouge River in Southfield, Michigan, USA. The second experimental program was conducted at Lawrence Technological University, Southfield, Michigan, USA for box beams prestressed with internally bonded and externally unbonded CFRP tendons to examine the behavior of these beams.
