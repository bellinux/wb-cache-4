40|$|International audienceRecent {{critical}} <b>toponymies</b> have convincingly {{demonstrated that}} studying place names also reveals much about geopolitics and power relations. In this paper, we propose {{a theoretical framework}} for interpreting these <b>toponymies,</b> in order to bet- ter decipher, theorise, and compare the many very rich case studies in the field. Our first argument is that the focus of enquiry should be place naming processes rather than place names themselves. We then show that place naming is a dispositif in the Foucauldian sense. This allows us to build a framework that distinguishes between (a) four types of geopo- litical contexts, from which place naming processes tend to stem; (b) four types of technologies that are commonly used; and (c) three types of actors. Lastly, we identify the preferential combinations and nexuses between these building blocks of place naming contexts, technologies, and actors...|$|R
5|$|The {{evidence}} of <b>toponymy</b> and language is unequivocal. Placenames in Orkney with a Celtic derivation are {{few in number}} {{and it is clear}} that Norn, a local version of Old Norse, was widely spoken by the inhabitants into historic times. Norn was also spoken in Shetland and evidence for Pictish elements in placenames is virtually non-existent, the three island names of Fetlar, Unst and Yell excepted.|$|E
5|$|After the Norse occupation, the <b>toponymy</b> of Orkney {{became almost}} wholly West Norse. The Norse {{language}} changed {{into the local}} Norn, which lingered {{until the end of}} the 18th century, when it finally died out. Norn was replaced by the Orcadian dialect of Insular Scots. This dialect is at a low ebb due to the pervasive influences of television, education, and the large number of incomers. However, attempts are being made by some writers and radio presenters to revitalise its use and the distinctive sing-song accent and many dialect words of Norse origin remain in use. The Orcadian word most frequently encountered by visitors is peedie, meaning small, which may be derived from the French petit.|$|E
5|$|As {{the first}} half of the period is largely prehistoric, {{archaeology}} plays an important part in studies of early Medieval Scotland. There are no significant contemporary internal sources for the Picts, although evidence has been gleaned from lists of kings, annals preserved in Wales and Ireland and from sources written down much later, which may draw on oral traditions or earlier sources. From the 7th century there is documentary evidence from Latin sources including the lives of saints, such as Adomnán's Life of St. Columba, and Bede's Ecclesiastical History of the English People. Archaeological sources include settlements, art, and surviving everyday objects. Other aids to understanding in this period include onomastics (the study of names) – divided into <b>toponymy</b> (place-names), showing the movement of languages, and the sequence in which different languages were spoken in an area, and anthroponymy (personal names), which can offer clues to relationships and origins.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} an {{extensive}} {{research on the}} development of known <b>toponymies</b> in the wider region of Eastern Macedonia, Northern Greece is conducted. To this objective, digital processing of historical maps (from 1901 to 1945, at a scale from 1 : 200, 000 to 1 : 20, 000) in an environment of GIS has been utilized. The focus of the undertaken study is an area covered by 500 km 2, from the ancient Amfipolis to the town of Philippoi. The entire analysis (i. e. archaeological estimation) is based on orthophotomaps and satellite images. The data are retrieved from historical maps (from 1901 to 1945, at a scale from 1 : 200, 000 to 1 : 20, 000).

40|$|In Northern Ireland, {{a region}} that has {{experienced}} longstanding ethno-political conflict, terminology has become a veritable minefield (Mitchell 1999). In accordance {{with the work of}} Cordula Hawes-Bilger (2007), this paper will view such terminological differences as linguistic aspects of the Northern Ireland conflict and will support the idea that the language in Northern Ireland has become a war zone unto itself by means of the metaphorical conception WORDS ARE WEAPONS (based on the work of Lakoff and Johnson (1980)). However, this paper will look specifically at place names as a battleground for ethno-political ideology, based on work done in the field of Critical <b>Toponymies</b> (see especially Berg and Vuolteenaho (2009)). I will be limiting myself to the terms 'Londonderry,' 'Northern Ireland,' and 'the Republic of Ireland' and their variations. These variations include 'Derry,' and 'Derryl Londonderry'; and 'Ulster,' 'the Six Counties,' 'the North (of Ireland) '; and 'Eire,' 'the South (of Ireland),' 'Irish Republic,' 'Free State' and 'the 26 Counties,' respectively. In particular, I plan to look at {{the ways in which the}} use of geographical terminology pertaining to the Northern Ireland conflict has changed over time and across the ethno-political divide to determine if the relative peace throughout the last 15 years has resulted in less use of politically charged place names among the main actors in the Northern Ireland conflict, namely the Republicans and Unionists within Northern Ireland itself.

This paper discusses research which uses sound and listening to investigate the relationship of the islands’ inhabitants, young and old, to placenames and the resonant histories which are enshrined in them and reveals them, in their spoken form, as dynamic mnemonics for complex webs of memories.

50|$|The {{city has}} diverse communities, {{reflected}} by its history. The Bataks {{is one of}} the major ethnic groups in Medan. In the past the Dutch employed them as workers in oil palm plantations. The Bataks reside throughout the city. The Mandailings also live here in large numbers and work in the most strategic government position. In addition, there is a large ethnic Javanese community, largely made up of the descendants of people transported from Java in the last 19th century to be employed as contract workers at various plantations in North Sumatra. They are usually known as Pujakesuma (Putra Jawa Kelahiran Sumatera/Sumatra-born Javanese). Their presence in Medan can be marked from various Javanese <b>toponymies</b> in Medan, such as Harjosari, Sarirejo, Sidodadi, Sidomulyo, Sidorame, Sidorejo, Sitirejo, Sudirejo, Tanjungrejo, Tanjungsari, Tegalrejo, Tegalsari, etc. (mostly in East Medan and Medan Tembung area). The Malays and Karo peoples are the natives in Medan, already living in the city after the founding of Medan. The Malays living spread throughout the city, but they have a big concentration population in Medan Maimun, Medan Kota and Medan Area, meanwhile the Karo people mostly resided around Medan Selayang and Medan Tuntungan area.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} study of the <b>toponymies</b> of the Umayyad estates and establishments in the area between the desert and the sown in the Bilad al-Sham. The <b>toponymies</b> of the Umayyad sites have received scant attention from scholars studying the Umayyad period. In the past, very little was known of the Umayyad settlement policy in the Bilad al-Sham {{due to the lack of}} systematic explorations. In the last four decades, however, several comprehensive surveys and excavations have been carried out in the area. The time seems appropriate for a re-analysis of both archaeological and textual material. ^ The methodology used in this research involved the examination of both archaeological and textual record related to these establishments. Literary sources play a significant role in investigating the names of sites, although our sources are all from the Abbasid period. We have investigated the meaning of the names of these sites. The name of the building may be a clear reflection of intention of its owner and a further indication of his personal attitude toward it. ^ Archaeological investigations to the Umayyad sites showed that these constructions were located near water resources and they have canal irrigation, regardless whether these canals were already founded and just repaired and reused by the Umayyads. Our investigations demonstrated that the Umayyads had a settlement policy of turning the desert fringes into places of habitation (tamsir). ^ The view presented here is that the Umayyad sites served two purposes. First, the primary reason behind the Umayyad building program was related to agricultural exploitation. Second, the Umayyad caliphs built such a significant number of palaces between the desert and the sown to give themselves the opportunity to be in close contact with the Arab tribes. In fact, some of the Umayyad buildings might have been built for members of these tribes. Without establishing themselves among the Bedouin tribes, the Umayyads would have had difficulty in organizing their armies. Accordingly, as long as the Umayyads were able to keep their prestige among the Bedouin, they could organize their power. Once they neglected the source of their power among the Syrian Bedouin and left their desert residences, as was the case of the last Umayyad Caliphs, Yazid III and Marwan II, the Umayyad caliphate came to an end. ^ Finally, it has been widely believed that almost all Umayyad settlements were abandoned by the fall of the Umayyad dynasty in 132 / 750. Now this claim has been rejected because archaeological investigations in many of these sites indicate occupation continuity from the Umayyad into the Abbasid periods.

The paper presents the development of semantic types and gi­ves many examples of toponyms, sometimes hydronyms {{within the boundaries of}} a given state. There is a large portion of commemorative names after famous discoverers, explorers and travellers. Many names commemorate ruling royal families. Oth­ers originated from the names of governors and high-rank officials, names of national heroes, captains and officers of ships, secretaries of state, surgeons, bishops, first settlers and even fiction characters. Many names had been borrowed from places on other continents. Local names of apellative stems are not so numerously represented as the names discussed. There are also many Aboriginal names which are not etymologically clear. They are very often concurrent with European names. There are also a number of Anglo-Aboriginal hybrids. Zadanie pt.

40|$|The {{investigation}} {{of the evolution of}} cultural and genetic traits and how they interact represents a vibrant area of research in evolutionary genetics, whose dynamics are particularly relevant for our species. One of the key assumptions of the "gene-culture coevolution" framework is the coinheritance of cultural and genetic traits. A corollary of the model is that culturally defined groups with a unique (or a limited number of) common origin(s) whose membership is inherited only through the male or female line are expected to show a relatively low intragroup variation for genetic markers similarly transmitted. Across human societies this {{is expected to be the}} case for cultural <b>toponymies</b> and family names within patrilineal and matrilineal groups considered in association with the nonrecombining region of the Y chromosome (NRY) and the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) portion of the genome, respectively. This study aims at exploring the degree of correlation between culture and genetics by investigating the genetic variation of culturally and geographically defined groups. We analyzed the genetic variation at NRY and mtDNA in 181 individuals from the Basotho, a Southern African patrilineal population from Lesotho, in combination with information about group membership and geographic origin. Our results show that (a) the genetic distance between individuals belonging to the same culturally defined group is lower than the population as a whole when NRY markers are considered; (b) cultural traits have a bigger impact than geography for the within-group variation of Y chromosome, but not mtDNA; and (c) within-group genetic variation is compatible with a more homogeneous origin for less common groups. Our results provided additional evidence for the relevance of the dual inheritance model (culture and genetics) in understanding the patterns of human genetic variation, as implied by gene-culture coevolution theory.

40|$|The {{conception}} of the lands of the East as a coherent entity contained within the continent of Asia emerged slowly in Greek thought in the Archaic period (c. 800 – 500 BCE). This development {{was part of the}} emergence of geographical thought, whereby local <b>toponymies</b> and topographies could be related to larger geophysical entities. This study will examine the way the names of peoples, places and topographical details of regions in Asia are expressed in Greek poetry and prose in this period, starting with Homer and ending with Herodotus. It will examine toponymic references in Homer and Hesiod and the fragments of the later epic and lyric poets, in the earliest writer of prose, Hecataeus of Miletos, and in the Histories of Herodotus. It will also examine the contribution to the Greek understanding of the geography of Asia made by the early philosophers, map-makers and periploi or sailing-accounts, and explorers and settlers in the later Archaic period. In doing so, it will seek to show that a number of distinct paradigms emerged, in which the lands of the East are configured. These include an epic geography, based primarily on Homer; a genealogical scheme, of which Hesiod is the best example, in which places and peoples are mapped through family relationships of eponyms; the geography of periploi and itineraries, in which coasts and routes are charted; and the paradigm which charts the peoples of Asia in relation to one another, which seems to derive ultimately from the interest of the Persian king in enumerating his domain. These different paradigms coexisted and were integrated into a unified geographical view of Asia in the late sixth century under the influence of Ionian philosophical thought, probably by Hecataeus of Miletos. His successor Herodotus of Halikarnassos attempted to improve the model and give it more structure, and in addition to integrate it into his own historiographical program. ...|$|R
