25|$|An {{area where}} African Americans in general {{outstrip}} whites {{is in their}} condemnation of homosexuality. Prominent leaders in the Black church have demonstrated against gay rights issues such as gay marriage. This stands {{in stark contrast to}} the down-low phenomenon of covert male–male sexual acts. There are those within the community who take a different position, notably the late Coretta Scott King and <b>the</b> <b>Reverend</b> <b>Al</b> <b>Sharpton,</b> the latter of whom, when asked in 2003 whether he supported gay marriage, replied that he might as well have been asked if he supported black marriage or white marriage.|$|E
25|$|Tawana Glenda Brawley (born 1972) is an African-American {{woman from}} Wappingers Falls, New York, who gained notoriety in 1987–88 for falsely accusing four white men of having raped her. The charges {{received}} widespread national attention {{because of her}} age (15), the persons accused (including police officers and a prosecuting attorney), and the state in which Brawley was found after the alleged rape. She {{was found in a}} trash bag, with racial slurs written on her body and covered in feces. Brawley's accusations were given widespread media attention in part from the involvement of her advisers, including <b>the</b> <b>Reverend</b> <b>Al</b> <b>Sharpton</b> and attorneys Alton H. Maddox and C. Vernon Mason.|$|E
500|$|In late 2015, Emanuel's {{approval}} rating plunged to [...] "the low 20's" [...] {{in response to}} a series of scandals, most directly the police shooting of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald, the city's subsequent attempts to withhold a video of the shooting, and the lack of an investigation into the matter. In early December 2015 the federal Justice Department announced an investigation into the operations of the Chicago police department, a move which Emanuel initially opposed. At one point half of Chicagoans favored Emanuel's resignation, with highly critical evaluations of the mayor appearing in such sources as The New York Times and The New Yorker, and coming from such figures as <b>the</b> <b>Reverend</b> <b>Al</b> <b>Sharpton.</b>|$|E

25|$|Shortly thereafter, the Senate {{unanimously}} {{passed the}} bill without amendment on July 20, 2006 by a 98–0 vote. However, {{in an unprecedented}} event for a bill that passed unanimously out of committee, Senators of only one political party, Republicans, signed onto the bill's Senate committee report, and the report was not filed until six days after the bill's passage. The Senate report differed in significant ways from the House report, and in their own statement, Senate Democrats objected to parts of the Senate report that they believed highlighted evidence that could jeopardize the bill's constitutionality. The day after the committee report was filed, President George W. Bush signed the bill in a morning ceremony on the South Lawn of the White House on July 27, 2006, one year {{in advance of the}} 2007 expiration date. The audience at the signing ceremony included family members of Martin Luther King Jr. and Rosa Parks, <b>the</b> <b>reverends</b> <b>Al</b> <b>Sharpton</b> and Jesse Jackson, NAACP Chairman Julian Bond, and other civil rights leaders.|$|R

[...] Jackson's 11-year-old daughter Paris Katherine, speaking publicly for the first time, wept as she told the crowd: [...] "Ever since I was born, Daddy {{has been the best}} father you could ever imagine ...

2500|$|By contrast, Tom Wolfe's Bonfire of the Vanities (1987) {{portrays a}} wealthy, white protagonist, Sherman McCoy, getting lost off the Major Deegan Expressway in the South Bronx and having an altercation with locals. A {{substantial}} {{piece of the}} last part of the book is set in the resulting riotous trial at the Bronx County Courthouse. However, times change, and in 2007, The New York Times reported that [...] "the Bronx neighborhoods near the site of Sherman's accident are now dotted with townhouses and apartments." [...] In the same article, <b>the</b> <b>Reverend</b> <b>Al</b> <b>Sharpton</b> (whose fictional analogue in the novel is [...] "Reverend Bacon") asserts that [...] "twenty years later, the cynicism of The Bonfire of the Vanities is as out of style as Tom Wolfe's wardrobe." ...|$|E
5000|$|If anyone {{doubted the}} hapless nature of Ferrer's {{campaign}} {{they had only}} to watch his ads featuring <b>the</b> rotund <b>Reverend</b> <b>Al</b> <b>Sharpton</b> salsa dancing. In Fernando Ferrer's losing bid for mayor, that was about as innovative as things got. The campaign was also plagued by revenue problems as the ads they wished to use were too long and hence too expensive and these [...] "salsa" [...] ads were done to save money but also to hopefully get the campaign some needed attention. Sadly, the focus became <b>Al</b> <b>Sharpton</b> and the others used in these ads rather than the message they tried to convey.|$|R
5000|$|Other notable New York City {{community}} {{members who have}} spoken against <b>the</b> attacks include <b>Reverend</b> <b>Al</b> <b>Sharpton</b> and Dov Hikind. <b>Al</b> <b>Sharpton,</b> Russell Simmons, Foundation for Ethnic Understanding founder Rabbi Marc Schneier, former NYC mayor David Dinkins and former New Orleans mayor and current National Urban League president Marc Morial released a video in December 2013 saying [...] "No to K.O." [...] Retired Brooklyn-born boxer Mike Tyson has also spoken against the attacks on The Piers Morgan Show.|$|R
50|$|Twin {{brothers}} Raoul and David Perre, respectively {{known as}} HOW and NOSM, are graffiti artists and professional muralists residing in New York. Born in the Basque country of San Sebastian, Spain, the Perre brothers {{were raised in}} Düsseldorf, Germany practicing the Bronx-born art form of graffiti. Their late teenage years were spent spraypainting around the world, visiting more than 60 countries and leaving their remarkably detail oriented artwork on everything from buildings to subway trains. During a visit to New York in 1997, HOW and NOSM were asked to become members of the legendary TATS CRU. Shortly thereafter in 1999, they permanently relocated to New York, a move that influenced their transition from tagging and spray painting trains to creating refined large scale murals and paintings on canvas. HOW and NOSM have been featured in several publications, including the New York Times, The New Yorker and LA Weekly. Their artwork has stirred <b>the</b> likes of <b>Reverend</b> <b>Al</b> <b>Sharpton</b> with its controversial undertones of radical subjects manifested within their art. As adept with a spray can as only few artists could ever hope {{to be with a}} brush, the Perres’ body of work includes everything from canvases and large-scale multimedia sculpture to practically anything they feel compelled to leave their signature on.|$|R
2500|$|The Boondocks {{has been}} a {{frequent}} subject of controversy since its comic-strip debut in 1999, with ABC News noting, [...] "Fans and critics of The Boondocks loved and hated the strip for the same reasons: its cutting-edge humor and unapologetic, sometimes unpopular, views on various issues, including race, politics, {{the war on terrorism}} and the September 11 attacks." [...] Numerous outlets predicted the show would encounter controversy prior to its November 2005 debut, due to its casual use of the word [...] "nigger". According to an article in The Washington Post, references to Rosa Parks were removed from one of the series' first completed episodes within a week of her death. In 2006, <b>the</b> <b>Reverend</b> <b>Al</b> <b>Sharpton</b> protested the first-season episode [...] "Return of the King," [...] for Martin Luther King, Jr.'s character's use of the word [...] "nigga," [...] saying [...] "Cartoon Network must apologize and also commit to pulling episodes that desecrate black historic figures." [...] Cartoon Network released a statement in response defending McGruder: [...] "We think Aaron McGruder came up with a thought-provoking way of not only showing Dr. King's bravery but also of reminding us of what he stood and fought for, and why even today, it is important {{for all of us to}} remember that and to continue to take action," [...] the statement said. The episode was later awarded a Peabody Award for being [...] "an especially daring episode".|$|E
