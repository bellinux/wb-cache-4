40|$|Ketamine and {{phencyclidine}} (PCP) are noncompetitive antagonists of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) type of ligand-gated glutamate receptors. Both {{agents have}} high abuse liability, and may produce dependence. Tolerance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>reinforcing</b> effects of drugs of abuse {{is widely regarded}} as a key component of the dependence process. Therefore, the present study was conducted to examine whether tolerance develops <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>reinforcing</b> effects of ketamine, and whether PCP and dizocilpine, a noncompetitive NMDA antagonist with negligible abuse liability, produce cross-tolerance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>reinforcing</b> effects of ketamine. Further, identification of the neural mechanisms that underlie tolerance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>reinforcing</b> effects of drugs may yield information regarding drug dependence...|$|R
