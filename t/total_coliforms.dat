30|$|From Table  2, {{it can be}} {{seen that}} after treatment, the number of <b>total</b> <b>coliform</b> in {{effluent}} TSW was within the range of 26 to 40 MPN per 100  ml; however, it was higher than the initial value of 17 MPN per 100  ml. In T 1 treatments, increasing the dose of powdered M. oleifera seed coagulant did not significantly reduce the <b>total</b> <b>coliform</b> in TSW. For instance, at a dose of 110  mg l− 1, there was an increase in the <b>total</b> <b>coliform</b> from 17 to 34 MPN per 100  ml, and adding 130 and 150  mg l− 1 of powdered M. oleifera seed coagulant increased the number of <b>total</b> <b>coliform</b> to 40 and 30 MPN per 100  ml, respectively. Similarly, the use of two-stage filtration combined with the sequence of coconut fibre-sand (T 2 treatment) also showed that increasing the dose of powdered M. oleifera seed coagulant had no effect on <b>total</b> <b>coliform,</b> as there was a gradual increase during the experimental period, giving the value from 26 to 40 MPN per 100  ml. This suggested that the addition of powdered M. oleifera seed was not be able to reduce the growth of coliform in TSW. The one-way ANOVA test found that the reduction of <b>total</b> <b>coliform</b> was not significantly influenced either by the dose of powdered M. oleifera seed coagulant or by the sequences of natural filter media used in the two-stage clarifier tank (P[*]>[*] 0.05). In contrast, other findings found that M. oleifera seeds have a degree of antibacterial properties thus reducing the number of microbial species, such as <b>total</b> <b>coliform</b> in the water or wastewater (Ghebremichael et al. 2005; Kawo and Daneji 2011; Walter et al. 2011). It is possible that failure in reducing the number of <b>total</b> <b>coliform</b> in TSW was due to the powdered M. oleifera seed coagulant that releases its other water-soluble proteins and organic matters, thus increasing the concentration of dissolved organic matter in water or wastewater during treatment (Okuda et al. 2001; García-Fayos et al. 2010; Jerri et al. 2012), which facilitates the growth of microorganism during storage in the final collection tank (Broin et al. 2002). A further combination with two-step clarifier tanks filled with two different natural filter media did not have any apparent effects on the reduction of <b>total</b> <b>coliform,</b> opposite to the finding found in another study (Jerri et al. 2012). The findings from this study demonstrated that the use of M. oleifera seed coagulant combined with two-stage filtration process has no significant effect on reducing the amount of <b>total</b> <b>coliform</b> presences in TSW. Although there was a slight increase in the amount of <b>total</b> <b>coliform,</b> this still remained well within the acceptable value for disposal or other uses (Table  1), indicating that the proposed system has a potential to produce water that can be recycled back the processing plant such as for washing purposes. However, further chlorination is still needed for safety reason and to meet the standard value of clean water (0 MPN per 100  ml) (Ministry of Health of the Republic of Indonesia 1990).|$|R

50|$|A {{stainless}} steel biosand filter developed by engineers at S M Sehgal Foundation, an NGO based in Gurgaon, India, {{has been found}} to perform better than its concrete counterparts and with a wider opportunity for application and adoption in different geographical conditions. The high cost of plastic prevents its use in rural India. The {{stainless steel}} filter, called JalKalp, offers increased filtration rate and better portability (than concrete models) and better production quality control. Concrete filters are prone to breakage and can be difficult to transport due to weight (65 kg), make it unsuitable especially in remote rural or hilly locations. Common quality issues are variations in construction material and manufacturing flaws. Further, the efflorescence due to salts in water reduces the life of the concrete filter. The newly developed lightweight (4.5 kg) stainless steel biosand filter has an edge over concrete filters, overcoming each of those shortcomings and providing better quality control. Besides improving its appearance, stainless steel adds to the strength, reliability, durability, and portability of the filter. Water quality tests demonstrate JalKalp's effectiveness against E coli, <b>total</b> <b>coliforms,</b> turbidity, and iron contamination. This filter integrates the germicidal properties of copper with the conventional filtration. Introduction of copper foil in the drainage zone of JalKalp filter has increased the removal of total coliform and E coli to 100% from contaminated water. S M Sehgal Foundation promotes the model across India through partnerships with like-minded organizations to benefit as many rural families as possible.|$|E
