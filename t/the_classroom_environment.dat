25|$|The {{organization}} {{has been criticized}} for its lack of troubleshooting support. Teachers in Peru are told to handle problems in one of two ways. If the problem is a software issue, they are to flash the computer, and if it is a hardware problem, they are to report it. In <b>the</b> <b>classroom</b> <b>environment</b> this black-boxing approach is being criticized for causing the teachers and students to feel disconnected with, and confused by the laptop, which results, in many cases, in the laptops eventually going unused. Several defects in OLPC XO-1 hardware have emerged in the field, and laptop repair is often neglected by students or their families (who are responsible for maintenance) due to the relatively high cost of some components (such as displays).|$|E

This report is about application of the Rasch model to analyse the data; the second report (Associations between <b>the</b> <b>Classroom</b> Learning <b>Environment</b> and Student Engagement in Learning 2 : A Structural Equation Modeling Approach), is about Structural Equation Modeling application. Student engagement in learning has become an important consideration in research into learning environments and the design of instruction.

The objectives were to construct a composite measure of student engagement in <b>classroom</b> learning and <b>the</b> <b>classroom</b> learning <b>environment.</b> Then, to compare student scores for variables and groups of students (e. g. boys and girls). An 85 -item scale was created and data from administering the scale to 1760 secondary school students were tested for fit to the Rasch rating scale measurement model. Data on engagement in <b>classroom</b> learning and <b>the</b> <b>classroom</b> learning <b>environment</b> were able to be plotted on one interval scale suggesting an underlying common construct.
