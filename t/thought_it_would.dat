5|$|Sony {{predicted}} {{an opening}} weekend {{take in the}} low-$30-million range, while commentators <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> come in closer to $40 million and beat Inception for the number one spot at the box office.|$|E
5|$|Cyan {{proposed}} Myst to Sunsoft for $265,000—more {{than double}} what they <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> cost {{to develop the}} game, but ultimately less than Myst cost to produce. After getting the go-ahead, Cyan play tested the entire game in a role-played Dungeons and Dragons form to identify any large issues before entering full production.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to their}} {{frequent}} relocation, Kaif and her siblings were home-schooled {{by a series}} of tutors. Although she is thought to have grown up in London, she lived there for only three years before moving to India. According to Kaif, she then changed her surname to her father's because she <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be easier to pronounce.|$|E
6000|$|... "On second <b>thoughts,</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> {{be better}} if, {{instead of the}} Greek numerals ten times, you wrote me the first ode of the first book of Horace. The numerals {{would be a little}} long, perhaps." ...|$|R

50|$|In {{the past}} the idea had been {{dismissed}} because <b>it</b> was <b>thought</b> that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> inevitably lead to hyperinflation.|$|R
5|$|Gillian Jacobs as Britta Perry – Britta {{dropped out}} of high school because she <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> impress Radiohead. She then joined a group of anarchists who vandalized billboards. She has been in the Peace Corps, and done foot {{modeling}} before she enrolled at Greendale. She is strongly concerned with honesty, and does not take lightly to anyone lying to her.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{families}} targeted in the Kandahar shootings {{had returned to the}} area in 2011 after previously being displaced by the surge. Fearing the Taliban but encouraged by the U.S. government, the Army, and the Afghan government, they settled near the U.S. military base because they <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> to be a safe place to live.|$|E
5|$|The 1930s road follows Telford's road {{as far as}} Bridge of Orchy, then runs to {{the east}} of Loch Tulla, while the old road runs to the other side. The project was criticised over spoiling the natural beauty of Glen Coe, but was defended by the Ministry of Transport who <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> provide better {{transport}} links to Argyllshire and Inverness-shire.|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with [...] " [...] Sikh Chic" [...] Daljit has stated his reason for translating the novel Roll Of Honour : [...] "Punjabi has its own texture and diversity of dialects. I <b>thought</b> that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> {{give me a chance}} to do something more then sic just translation. This invitation was too big to resist. I <b>thought</b> that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be a liberating experience, which it turned out to be." ...|$|R
60|$|It's such {{a relief}} to have got over all the difficulties. I <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> never <b>would</b> come right. You are a brick, Elizabeth.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should not}} suppose <b>it</b> <b>would</b> {{be so hard}} to draw up the line," [...] said Rollo. [...] "I should have <b>thought</b> that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> come up very easily." ...|$|R
5|$|At this point, Khánh had {{not spoken}} up and allowed the {{impression}} that the moves had been made without his consultation or against his will, and an attempt on the part of other officers to take power themselves. Hương had actually privately endorsed the dissolution of the HNC, as both he and the Young Turks <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> allow them to gain more power and influence over Khánh.|$|E
5|$|Believing {{that the}} wings were short and round, Gibbs thought {{the bird was}} not a strong flyer, and {{therefore}} not nomadic (periodically moving from place to place). In spite of the evidently longer wings which might have made it a strong flyer, vanGrouw also <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have been a sedentary (mostly staying at the same location) bird, that preferred not to fly across open water, similar to species in Ducula. It {{may have had a}} limited distribution on a small, remote island, which may explain why its provenance remains unknown.|$|E
5|$|Dodd married Alice Davis in 1933, {{and they}} had two children, Linda Dodd Thompson and Robert Lee Dodd Jr., who played quarterback for the University of Florida from 1960–61. Dodd Jr. had wanted to play for Georgia Tech, but Dodd <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be best if he played for another college. On October 1, 1960, Dodd Jr. contributed to Florida's 18-17 upset of the Yellow Jackets at Florida Field with Ray Graves, Dodd's former assistant, as Gator head coach.|$|E
6000|$|What {{could be}} seen of Mr. Fletcher's lips {{appeared}} to curl in an odd smile. [...] "Indeed, I <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was--or <b>would</b> be--all in the family." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was taught}} it in England, sir. My father <b>thought</b> that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be useful, for the {{population}} of Alexandria is a rough one." ...|$|R
25|$|By mid August {{wet weather}} had impeded {{operations}} further {{but for the}} besieging force <b>it</b> was <b>thought</b> that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> impede any army of relief.|$|R
5|$|Hines <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> {{be easier}} to enter the North from Canada and {{traveled}} there during the winter. Hines led the Northwest Conspiracy from Canada {{in the fall of}} 1864. Colonel Benjamin Anderson was involved in the plot, along with other Confederate soldiers. It was hoped that Hines and his men would be able to free the Confederate prisoners held at Camp Douglas in Chicago, Illinois.|$|E
5|$|The Toy Story {{films and}} {{characters}} will always hold {{a very special}} place in our hearts and we're so excited to be bringing this landmark film back for audiences to enjoy {{in a whole new}} way thanks to the latest in 3-D technology. With Toy Story 3 shaping up to be another great adventure for Buzz, Woody and the gang from Andy's room, we <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be great to let audiences experience the first two films all over again and in a brand new way.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by George Meyer and {{directed}} by David Silverman. Executive producer Sam Simon and writers Al Jean and Mike Reiss {{came up with the}} idea for the episode. A co-worker had recently needed a blood transfusion and the writers <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be funny if Mr. Burns had one. Although Meyer was credited with writing the episode, Jean and Reiss re-wrote and polished the script. The episode includes the debut of the Olmec head Xtapolapocetl, which would become a common background prop in the Simpson home.|$|E
60|$|MRS. H. Very likely if you <b>thought</b> that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> flatter your vanity. You'd cry {{my name on}} the house-tops to {{make people}} turn round.|$|R
50|$|Israel was not {{particularly}} troubled by the evacuation of the UNEF in itself. There were some who even <b>thought</b> that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be to Israel’s advantage.|$|R
6000|$|... "I will {{submit to}} no {{imputation}} on my honour,--even from you. One <b>would</b> have <b>thought</b> that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> {{have been for}} you to preserve it untarnished." ...|$|R
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Richard Appel and {{directed}} by Dominic Polcino. Appel was looking for new locales to put Bart and <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be funny to have him work at a burlesque house. The problem {{was to find a}} way to put such a house in Springfield, which was solved with the bit with the toy airplane. There were a dozen different possible names for the Burlesque house, some of which were raunchy.|$|E
5|$|The {{producers}} also <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> {{be interesting}} {{for there to}} be more to Shannon and Boone's relationship than just Boone's possessive brotherly interest. According to Cuse, the plot twist had become a Lost characteristic so they wanted to surprise the audience by having the Shannon-Boone relationship be sexual in nature. The idea for the two came from an observation that their bickering resembled an older married couple; to support this, they made the characters step-siblings as it had not yet been established what their sibling bond exactly was.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} reasons for showing Oscar's head and {{shoulders}} within the frame during the flashback scenes, rather than letting the camera be the character's eyes. The first was {{that this is the}} way Noé usually sees himself in dreams and when recalling past events. He also <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be easier for the viewer to care about a character who is visible, as many point-of-view films, in his opinion, look unintentionally funny.|$|E
60|$|They {{were sitting}} alone at lunch, and the {{assistant}} <b>thought</b> that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> {{be a good}} opportunity of asking leave for {{the day of the}} fight.|$|R
6000|$|... "After all I {{have heard}} of your cousin since I have been here, I should hardly have <b>thought</b> that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be {{reckoned}} so in this case." ...|$|R
60|$|Upon talking {{over the}} matter with the astrologer the latter at once said that he <b>thought</b> that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be better {{for him not to}} go to Simon's again.|$|R
5|$|While {{playing for}} the local youth team of San Vendemiano, Del Piero used to feature as a goalkeeper, {{in order to gain}} more playing time. His mother <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be better for him to play in this role as he would not sweat, and the {{possibility}} of him getting injured was less likely. His brother Stefano commented to their mother that, due to his skill, Alessandro was more suited to playing in a more offensive position, and Del Piero switched to a forward role.|$|E
5|$|A {{quarter of}} the homes in Cihuatlán, Jalisco, were totally destroyed, leaving many homeless. In Manzanillo, Colima, 40 percent of all homes were destroyed, and four ships in the harbor were sunk. Large {{portions}} of Colima and Jalisco were isolated by flooding. Hundreds of people were stranded. Minatitlán, Colima, suffered especially, as 800people out of its population of 1000 were dead or missing, according to a message sent to President Adolfo López Mateos. In Colima, all coconut plantations were blown down {{and thousands of people}} were left out of work. That state's economy was damaged enough that officials <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> take years to recover.|$|E
5|$|According to the story, {{unaware of}} the nature of the gift, Norton saved the cigar, keeping it on display in his college's museum. Years later, when the school was {{shutting}} its doors for good, the alumni <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be a fitting gesture to smoke the cigar at the college's annual reunion. The honor was given to Winstead Norton, Horace's grandson. During the sober speech he was presenting, Winstead lit the cigar, and after two puffs, it exploded. A 1952 news report contradicts one detail, holding that the explosion ultimately occurred at a family reunion rather than the alumni affair noted.|$|E
60|$|Kate had {{no answer}} to make, but she <b>thought</b> that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be his own fault {{if he did not}} have a wife to stand up for him thoroughly.|$|R
6000|$|I {{remembered that}} boat, {{which had been}} the first thing which I had seen upon the coast of France. How little I had <b>thought</b> what <b>it</b> <b>would</b> mean to me! ...|$|R
