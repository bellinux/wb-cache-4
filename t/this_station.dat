5|$|The name tablets on <b>this</b> <b>station</b> still {{retain the}} {{original}} name of Woodhaven Boulevard–Slattery Plaza. The tilework in <b>this</b> <b>station</b> consists of blue bands {{with a black}} border, similar to the tilework found at the Elmhurst Avenue stop, two stations west.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the planned extension, the two tracks {{continue}} east of <b>this</b> <b>station</b> for about 700 feet along 205th Street to Webster Avenue, ending at a concrete wall, and <b>this</b> <b>station</b> does not have any crew quarters. Crews are changed at Bedford Park Boulevard, the next station south. Additionally, there is no diamond crossover between the tracks west of this station; here, a center track forms leading west to the Concourse Yard. Because of this, terminating trains arrive on the southern (railroad northbound) track and discharge their passengers before continuing east {{to the end of the}} track. They then use the diamond crossover there to return to <b>this</b> <b>station</b> on the northern (railroad southbound) track and begin service to Manhattan and Brooklyn. Due to the track configuration, trains may reverse into the yard from the southern track, and trains from the yard may start service on the northern track.|$|E

5|$|A second station, {{later called}} Shepton Mallet (Charlton Road), opened in 1874 with the {{building}} of the Bath extension of the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway. <b>This</b> <b>station</b> was some distance east of the centre of the town and was approached on the Charlton Viaduct.|$|E
5|$|At East Broadway on the IND Sixth Avenue Line (under Rutgers Street at <b>this</b> <b>station),</b> {{part of a}} two-track {{station was}} built for the IND Worth Street Line under East Broadway, above the {{existing}} line. Most of the constructed portion {{is now part of}} the mezzanine.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{started at}} <b>this</b> <b>station</b> in 1969, {{and as a}} result of the New York City fiscal crisis in 1975, the station did not open until 1989. Originally, the station was {{intended}} to be a transfer point between passengers from the Sixth Avenue–Queens service and from the Broadway–Second Avenue service. <b>This</b> <b>station</b> was designed to allow for cross-platform transfers. However, in 1975, while the station was being built, construction was halted on the Second Avenue Subway. As a result, the side of the station intended for service to Second Avenue, the BMT side, was walled off with a temporary orange brick wall. Also, space intended for an exit at Third Avenue was left unused. While the Sixth Avenue side opened for service in 1989, the other side was only used for storing Broadway Line trains. The station appeared as if it had one side platform on each level.|$|E

5|$|East of <b>this</b> <b>station</b> on the BMT side, {{the planned}} track {{connections}} to the Second Avenue Subway curved slightly north.

5|$|On July 22, 2001, {{concurrent}} {{with the}} closure of the IND Sixth Avenue Line tracks of the Manhattan Bridge, B and Q train service to <b>this</b> <b>station</b> ceased and was replaced with a full-time shuttle. At this time, the northern tracks of the bridge were closed to allow for bridge repairs to take place. The southern BMT Broadway Line tracks were reopened allowing for half of the tracks on the bridge to remain open. On December 16, 2001, the 63rd Street Connector, which was built to connect the IND 63rd Street Line and the IND Queens Boulevard Line officially opened, and the F train was rerouted to serve <b>this</b> <b>station</b> at all times, which it still does to this day. When this happened, a free MetroCard out-of-system transfer to the Lexington Avenue–59th Street station was added. This was to provide a transfer to the IRT Lexington Avenue Line for F train customers as such a connection had been provided at the Lexington Avenue–53rd Street station along the previous routing of the F train.|$|E
5|$|The MTA's {{plans for}} Second Avenue Subway service {{extended}} the Q train (and selected rush-hour N train short turn trips), running via the BMT Broadway Line, along the BMT 63rd Street Line to serve <b>this</b> <b>station,</b> beyond which the trains turn north and {{run along the}} Second Avenue Line to 96th Street. This new service pattern was put into effect on January 1, 2017.|$|E

5|$|The {{station is}} fully ADA-accessible, with {{elevators}} to street level. West of <b>this</b> <b>station,</b> {{there is a}} diamond crossover and two bellmouths that curve southward toward an unbuilt portion of the Second Avenue Subway. The station has an unused lower level, which will be used by Long Island Rail Road trains once East Side Access is completed.|$|E
5|$|The {{station was}} {{originally}} a Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) station along the Rockaway Beach Branch. The LIRR station opened in 1913 {{to replace the}} nearby Ramblersville station. The LIRR ceased operations at <b>this</b> <b>station</b> in 1950, and the New York City Transit Authority bought {{the section of the}} Rockaway Beach Branch that included <b>this</b> <b>station</b> in 1952. The subway station opened on June 28, 1956. Between 2000 and 2003, the subway station was completely reconstructed and a transfer to the new AirTrain JFK was built. The rebuilt complex was completed on December 17, 2003, providing easier access to JFK Airport for large parts of the city.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} four tracks {{underneath}} <b>this</b> <b>station,</b> {{which are not}} visible from the platforms.

5|$|This {{local station}} has four tracks and two side platforms.

5|$|<b>This</b> <b>station</b> {{is unusual}} in that its {{mezzanine}} is split in two halves. This is because at this location, Union Turnpike and the Jackie Robinson Parkway cross under Queens Boulevard but over the Queens Boulevard Line tracks; the mezzanine is {{at the level of}} Union Turnpike, one half on either side, with no connection between the two outside of fare control.|$|E
