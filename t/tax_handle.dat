40|$|Six Latin American {{countries}} have levied taxes on withdrawals from bank accounts, {{which have been}} viewed as a convenient <b>tax</b> <b>handle</b> during a difficult fiscal period. The paper reviews the arguments for and against this type of taxation, describes the taxes, and surveys their revenue performance and economic impact. It concludes that the recently implemented taxes {{have been successful in}} raising revenue in the short term, but that adverse allocational impacts have likely been significant. The tax may work better in times of fiscal crisis, when financial intermediation is deep, and when the tax rate is modest. ...|$|E
40|$|More {{information}} about PSE and the G-MonD: www. parisschoolofeconomics. eu Trade taxes are a crucial <b>tax</b> <b>handle</b> for countries {{at an early}} stage of economic development. Revenues from import and export taxes represented more than 30 % of total tax revenues in Low-Income Countries (LICs) in the 1970 s and in today’s High-Income Countries (HICs) in the 1830 s. Today’s rich countries however levy very little taxes on trade (trade tax revenues represent less than 0. 5 % of GDP) and the overall pattern that emerges from the data is one of decreasing reliance on taxes on trade as countries develop (see Figure 1). Why is this the case? Probably because taxes on international trade are easy to levy while a more sophisticated government tax capacity is needed to levy broader-based domestic taxe...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we argue that}} a more {{legitimate}} and responsive state is an essential factor for a more adequate level of tax effort in developing countries and high income countries. While at first glance giving such advice to poor countries seeking to increase their tax ratios may not seem more helpful than telling them to find oil, it is presumably more feasible for people to improve their governing institutions than to rearrange nature’s bounty. Improving corruption, voice and accountability may not take longer nor be necessarily more difficult than changing the opportunities for <b>tax</b> <b>handles</b> and economic structure. The paper also shows that high income countries have also the potential of improving their tax performance through improving their institutions. The key contribution {{of this paper is}} to extend the conventional model of tax effort by showing that not only do supply factors matter, but that demand factors such as corruption, voice and accountability also determine tax effort to a significant extent.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the evolution and functioning of fiscal decentralisation process and intergovernmental finance in the Republic of South Africa (RSA). It analyses {{the system of}} dividing revenues among the three spheres of government. The paper highlights the challenges of designing and implementing intergovernmental fiscal policies and institutions in the post-apartheid era. The paper argues that the costed norms approach developed by the Financial and Fiscal Commission (FFC) has tremendous potential in evolving a simple, objective, and fair system of transfers. However, significant additional work in terms of research, its meaningful dissemination to various governmental units, and building the information system undertake the task is necessary to make it operational. The absence of revenue equalisation in the transfer system is an important weakness of the transfer design. However, provinces do not have much revenue powers. Revenue equalisation in the transfer formula is meaningful only when some broad-based <b>tax</b> <b>handles</b> are assigned to provinces. It {{is also an important}} moral and a policy question as to whether there should be incentive to raise revenues from sources such as, gambling taxes and hospital services. ...|$|R

40|$|This valve is {{designed}} to create a zero-leak seal in a liquid propulsion system that is a functional replacement for the normally closed pyrovalve. Unlike pyrovalves, Nitinol is actuated by simply heating the material to a certain temperature, called the transition temperature. Like a pyrovalve, before actuation, the upstream and downstream sections are separated from one another and from the external environment by closed welded seals. Also like pyrovalves, after actuation, the propellant or pressurant gas can flow without a significant pressure drop but are still separated from the external environment by a closed welded seal. During manufacture, a Nitinol bar is compressed to 93 percent of its original length and fitted tightly into the valve. During operation, the valve is heated until the Nitinol reaches the transition temperature of 95 C; the Nitinol "remembers" its previous longer shape with a very large recovery force causing it to expand and break the titanium parent metal seal to allow flow. Once open, the valve forever remains open. The first prototype valve was designed for high pressure [5, 000 psi (= 34. 5 MPa) ] and low flow, typical requirements for pressurant gas valves in liquid propulsion systems. It is possible to modify the dimensions to make low-pressure models or high-flow models, for use downstream of the propellant tanks. This design is simpler, lower risk, and less expensive than the pyrovalve. Although the valve must be in a thermally controlled state (kept below 80 C) to prevent premature actuation, the pyrovalves and electrically actuated initiators have far more <b>taxing</b> <b>handling</b> requirements...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} aims to {{find the}} key determinants of the variation of the tax revenue capacity in China, and to evaluate China’s tax revenue performance at provincial level. The econometric quantitative method is applied in this study for these purposes. The data {{used in this study}} covers the period between 1995 and 2013 on 31 provinces, autonomous or municipal cities directly {{under the control of the}} Central Government. Differing from the previous research, a new dependent variable, the current revenue ratio is used in addition to the conventional tax ratio. The current revenue is the sum of tax revenue and non-tax soured revenue excludes State Owned Enterprises revenues and expenditures. Eleven independent variables falling into six categories were selected. These six categories were: The traditional <b>tax</b> <b>handles,</b> GDP decomposition, Population factors, Income inequality, Governmental factors, and Corruption. The contributions of this study are: Firstly, for the first time the author constructed the current revenue ratio as the second dependent variable to represent the broader fiscal revenue and true tax-like revenue performance for studying tax effort index in China. Secondly, this study constructed the rural-urban income disparity Theil index as one of the explanatory variables in the tax effort index models for the first time in China’s tax performance study. Thirdly, for the first time in the tax effort index literature, this study used country specific data on corruption in a single country tax effort index model. The main results of this study are: 1) tax revenue capacity is mainly determined by the economic factors whereas the current revenue capacity is determined by both the economic and social factors; 2) tax revenue performance is diluted by the existence of non-tax sourced revenues; 3) the current revenue ratio is a better indicator for true tax performance; 4) There exists a regional disparity of tax or current revenue capacity among provinces. 5) tax/current revenue capacities and tax/current revenue efforts are mismatched in some provinces...|$|R
