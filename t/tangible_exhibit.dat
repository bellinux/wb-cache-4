40|$|This {{article focuses}} on a {{generation}} of chroniclers from the Low Countries operating {{at the intersection of}} urban and clerical environments and how they worked together to produce new historiographical texts. At the heart are the writings of three of the most productive and well-known historiographers of this generation: Johannes a Leydis, Theodericus Pauli and Willem van Berchen. The interdependency of a specific part of their body of work, namely their Chronicles of Holland, will be studied closely. This will lead to a new proposal for the complex relationship between these and other related contemporary texts. From this the contours emerge of a community of writers, reaching much further than these three alone, which shared a common interest in historiography and exchanged texts, ideas and manuscripts. In each of their texts, the influence of this exchange is <b>tangible,</b> <b>exhibiting</b> the collaborative nature of their historical writings, rarely detected in the Middle Ages...|$|R
40|$|Though digital {{interactive}} {{technologies have}} become more common and widespread in museum exhibitions and spaces, they are usually detached from the museum artefacts on display and are primarily used as a communication medium targeting mainly the visitors’ visual and aural senses. However, a wealth of evidence suggests the benefits of multifaceted physical interaction with museum exhibitions and exhibits. Could smart objects and smart exhibits be interweaved with museum exhibitions and museum artefacts {{in order to create}} rich, multi-sensory museum narratives that would favour tangible interaction with the objects on display by stimulating and engaging the visitor physically but also emotionally and cognitively all by taking under consideration the physical, personal and social context of the visit? This contribution presents the meSch (Material Encounters with Cultural Heritage) EU project that aims to empower Cultural Heritage (CH) professionals to create <b>tangible</b> <b>exhibits</b> through the use of easy-to-use authoring tools that also cater for the reuse of content from public Cultural Heritage repositories. The project features a co-design approach in which communities of CH professionals as well as designers, artists and engineers work together to develop DIY (Do-It-Yourself) technologies {{for a new generation of}} smart, adaptive exhibits...|$|R
40|$|This paper summarises {{the work}} {{carried out in}} the EU project meSch and {{presented}} at the 2 nd Digital Heritage Expo held in Granada in 2015. meSch, Material EncounterS with digital Cultural Heritage, bridges the gap between visitors’ cultural heritage experience on-site and on-line by providing a platform for the creation of <b>tangible</b> smart <b>exhibits,</b> that will enable heritage professionals to compose and realise physical artefacts enriched by digital content without the need for specialised technical knowledge. The platform includes an authoring toolkit for the composition of physical/digital narratives that map on interactive artefacts, and an embedded multi-sensor digital system platform for the construction of ad-hoc physical smart exhibits...|$|R

The <b>exhibits,</b> <b>tangible</b> manifestations of the concept which AP has worked on {{in connection with the}} city of Valletta over the past decade, including the Marks & Spencer bridge, the Maritime Authority Trade Centre, Q-Bar, and the Barrakka Lift, amongst others. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{our work}} undertaken {{as part of}} a EU-funded collaborative project involving twelve partners from six European countries, aiming to provide a platform for the creation of <b>tangible</b> smart <b>exhibits</b> to enable heritage professionals to design and assemble physical artefacts enriched by digital content in a DIY manner. Our approach is grounded on principles of co-design, the broad participation of designers, developers and stakeholders into the process, and on a Do-It-Yourself philosophy to making and experimentation. Hands-on design and prototyping workshops are employed throughout the project to inform and shape development. The paper focuses on these co-design activities, wherein cultural heritage professionals (CHPs), designers and technologists work together in local and consortium-wide workshops to co-create the DIY platform. It presents the results of an investigation into the design thinking, practices, and processes of a particular set of users - cultural heritage professionals – who are involved in the design and realisation of cultural heritage exhibitions involving digital interactive technologies...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT- This paper {{explores the}} {{sketching}} behavior of designers {{and the role}} of sketching in the design process. Observations from a descriptive study of sketches provided in design journals, characterized by a protocol measuring sketching activities, are presented. A distinction is made between journals that are entirely tangible and those that contain some digitally-produced content (“hybrid journals”). The trend between 2004 and 2006 is an increase in both the average number of sketches {{as well as in the}} percentage of 3 D sketches for hybrid journals. In 2004, <b>tangible</b> journals <b>exhibited</b> a higher average number of sketches over hybrid journals in the user needs and conceptual design stages, but this trend reversed in 2006 where hybrid journals favored more sketches at all design stages. Text was the predominant form of annotation used (ranging from 62 - 98 %), as opposed to dimensions or calculations for both journal types. The industrial design students had significantly more sketches overall and a higher percentage of 3 D sketches. They also tended to annotate more in hybrid journals over tangible journals. I...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} the design and initial evaluation of a <b>tangible</b> computer programming <b>exhibit</b> for children {{on display at the}} Boston Museum of Science. We also discuss five design considerations for tangible interfaces in science museums that guided our development and evaluation. In doing so, we propose the notion of passive tangible interfaces. Passive tangibles serve as a way to address practical issues involving tangible interaction in public settings and as a design strategy to promote reflective thinking. Results from our evaluation indicate that passive tangibles can preserve many of the benefits of tangible interaction for informal science learning while remaining cost-effective and reliable...|$|R
40|$|A key {{question}} for digital libraries is this: how should one go about becoming familiar {{with a digital}} collection, {{as opposed to a}} physical one? Digital collections generally present an appearance which is extremely opaque-a screen, typically a Web page, with no indication of what, or how much, lies beyond: whether a carefully-selected collection or a morass of worthless ephemera; whether half a dozen documents or many millions. At least physical collections occupy physical space, present a physical appearance, and <b>exhibit</b> <b>tangible</b> physical organization. When standing on the threshold of a large library one gains a sense of presence and permanence that reflects the care taken in building and maintaining the collection inside. No-one could confuse it with a dung-heap! Yet in the digital world the difference is not so palpable...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} focused on {{furniture}} firms in the Czech Republic during the period 2005 – 2012, which covers {{the year of the}} crisis. The aim was to assess the given economic situation of the manufacturing businesses comparing some of the economic indicators such as tangible fixed assets, revenue from own production and services, pre-tax profit and labor costs. The study was conducted in the Czech Republic using the data provided by the Czech Statistical Office. Results for the specified period and selected groups of micro furniture companies are shown; dependence of economic indicators within the given time period is also analyzed. The analysis has shown that the smallest of the firms were least affected by the economic crisis; moreover, the medium-sized of the companies <b>exhibit</b> <b>tangible</b> assets growth and certain degree of inertia in years 2008 and 2009. Finally, possibilities how the micro furniture companies could proceed when purchasing new technologies are outlined...|$|R
40|$|The {{economics}} of {{information has been}} studiously ignored in the ten Conferences of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity. Nevertheless, an academic literature exists which recognises genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge as natural and artificial information. Its unambiguous prescriptions would widen {{the scope of the}} Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and Benefit Sharing (ABS) and resolve almost all of the contentious issues identified by Kamau et al. One begins with retroactivity: because biological resources <b>exhibit</b> <b>tangible</b> and intangible aspects, the latter can be conceptualised as a set of natural information where value currently added in a patent is access to a subset not previously accessed. The economics quickly leads to a justification for a biodiversity cartel among countries of origin, wholly analogous to monopoly intellectual property rights. To achieve such a sea change in policymaking, the justification must be accompanied by a narrative that can penetrate the social sphere, much as Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights achieved through the World Intellectual Property Organisation. Several examples of bio-discoveries drawn from a popular medium are analysed in terms of the contentious issues of the Protocol and the distinct ABS that would eventuate under cartelisation. History also offers an analogy. The Parties’ eighteen years of resistance (1993 - 2011) to applying the {{economics of}} information to genetic resources is reminiscent to the twenty-seven years that the British Parliament rebuffed David Ricardo’s economic analysis of the Corn Laws (1815 - 1842) ...|$|R
