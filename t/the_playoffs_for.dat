The Browns finished 11–5, making <b>the</b> <b>playoffs</b> <b>for</b> {{the first time in five}} years. The Browns beat the Patriots in a wild-card game, but arch-rival Pittsburgh won a 29–9 victory in the divisional playoff, ending the Browns' season.|$|E

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the defeat, Gibson was fired, and the Giants lost three out of their last four games to finish out of <b>the</b> <b>playoffs</b> <b>for</b> the 15th straight season, leading them to let coach John McVay go as well. However, following the 1978 season came the steps that would, in time, return New York to the pinnacle of the NFL.|$|E

5|$|The Flames {{continued}} to struggle after the Olympic break; they finished {{the season in}} tenth place in the West and missed <b>the</b> <b>playoffs</b> <b>for</b> {{the first time since}} 2003. The result was disappointing for the organization, and led to media and fan speculation regarding the futures of Sutter and Iginla in Calgary.|$|E
5|$|The Panthers {{won their}} {{division}} during the 2015–16 season {{and returned to}} <b>the</b> <b>playoffs</b> <b>for</b> {{the second time in}} 16 years, due in part to Luongo's strong play.

5|$|After the Colts owner Jim Irsay hired Tony Dungy in 2002, the Colts made <b>the</b> <b>playoffs</b> <b>for</b> nine {{straight}} seasons.

5|$|Burrows had a forgettable 2013–14 season, scoring only 5 {{goals and}} 10 assists. In 49 games played, {{he did not}} score until game 36, where he potted two goals against the Winnipeg Jets. His 15 points on the year were the third-lowest of his career and his lowest since 2006–07. The 2013–14 season was also forgettable for the Canucks as a whole, as they failed to qualify for <b>the</b> <b>playoffs</b> <b>for</b> {{the first time since}} 2007–08.|$|E
5|$|Drexler {{retired after}} the season, and the Rockets traded {{to bring in}} Scottie Pippen to take his place. In the lockout-shortened 1998–99 season, the Rockets lost to the Lakers {{in the first round}} of the playoffs. After the 1999 draft, the Rockets traded for the second overall pick Steve Francis from the Vancouver Grizzlies, in {{exchange}} for four players and a first-round draft pick. However, after Houston traded a discontented Pippen to Portland, and Barkley suffered a career-ending injury, the rebuilt Rockets went 34–48 and missed <b>the</b> <b>playoffs,</b> <b>for</b> only the second time in 15 years.|$|E

He played all six games of the series despite suffering a wrist injury in the first game that forced him to decline an invitation to play for Canada at the 2010 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships.|$|E
