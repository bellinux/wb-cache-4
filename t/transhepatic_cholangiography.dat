Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), an endoscopic procedure performed by a gastroenterologist or specially trained surgeon, has been widely used for this purpose. Although ERCP is an invasive procedure with attendant risks, its advantages include the ability to obtain biopsies and to place stents or perform other interventions to relieve biliary obstruction.

Diagnosis of choledochal cyst is concluded upon disproportionate expansion of extrahepatic bile duct.

40|$|In {{patients}} with suspected severe acute pancreatitis and known or suspected cholelithiasis, {{it may be}} extremely difficult to exclude the diagnosis of gangrenous cholecystitis or obstructive cholangitis by nonoperative means. Since early intra-abdominal surgery has, in our experience, led to markedly increased morbidity in {{patients with}} gallstone pancreatitis, non-operative visualization of the biliary tree by percutaneous <b>transhepatic</b> Chiba-needle <b>cholangiography</b> (PTCNC) has been evaluated in 14 patients with suspected acute pancreatitis in whom life-threatening acute biliary disease could not be excluded by other nonoperative means. The final diagnosis was acute pancreatitis in nine patients (Group A) (mean serum amylase 3242 SU%) and acute biliary disease with hyperamylasemia in five patients (Group B) (mean serum amylase 2084 SU%). PTCNC made visualization of the biliary system possible in all patients and excluded the diagnosis of cystic duct or common duct obstruction in each case. Following PTCNC, potentially hazardous early laparotomy was avoided in eight of nine Group A patients. Biliary surgery was undertaken on day 3 to 13 in four Group B patients.

50|$|It may be {{difficult}} to obtain endoscopic access to the obstruction located higher (proximal) up in the biliary system, or when it is due to a stricture in the priorly performed anastomosis between the bile duct (surgically joining) with the duodenum or jejunum. When this happens, percutaneous <b>transhepatic</b> <b>cholangiography</b> (PTC) may be needed to relieve pressure. This involves identifying the bile duct by ultrasound and then passing a tube through the skin (percutaneous). PTC is generally performed by radiologists. PTC has potential complications, so occasionally further attempts at ERCP by more experienced doctors are preferred.|$|E

40|$|Fifty-one {{patients}} with suspected obstructive jaundice and 14 without jaundice in whom {{disease of the}} biliary tract was suspected but infusion cholangiography had been unhelpful were examined by grey-scale ultrasonography and percutaneous <b>transhepatic</b> <b>cholangiography</b> and the findings analysed retrospectively.

Percutaneous <b>transhepatic</b> <b>cholangiography</b> distinguished between obstructive and hepatocellular jaundice in 42 of the patients (91 %) and indicated the site of the obstruction in 42 (91 %) and the cause in 29 (63 %).

40|$|Background and Aims: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} a possible correlation between biliary tract dilatation as measured via per-cutaneous <b>transhepatic</b> <b>cholangiography</b> and the plasma bilirubin levels in patients diagnosed with icteric obstruction due to malignant causes. Materials and Methods: The study covered 299 patients diagnosed and discharged for icteric obstruction due to malignant causes and who underwent percutaneous <b>transhepatic</b> <b>cholangiography</b> between April 2006 and April 2010. Measurements were taken in the proxim-ity of biliary narrowness/obstruction, at the widest site of the dilated biliary tracts in patients who underwent percutaneous <b>transhepatic</b> <b>cholangiography.</b> The results of the measurements were calculated in millimeters via the calibration of catheters through the images. The biochemically determined plasma total bilirubin values of patients were studied 1 day before the percutaneous <b>transhepatic</b> <b>cholangiography</b> examination or within the same day but prior to the examination. The patients were divided into subgroups as aggregate or according to age, pathologic diagnosis, gender, and Bismuth classification prior to the investigation of the bilirubin and biliary tract correlation. Results: Examination of the patients in aggregate without any classification or by dividing the patients into subgroups according to age, pathologic diagnosis, gender, and Bismuth classification did not reveal a signifi-cant correlation between the diameter of the biliary tract and serum total bilirubin levels. Conclusions: Since there was no significant cor-relation between the serum total biliary level and biliary tract dilatation in malignant biliary obstruction, the serum total bilirubin levels become prominent, while the biliary tract dilatation becomes of secondary im-portance in assessment of a patient via the invasive practice through percutaneous <b>transhepatic</b> <b>cholangiography.</b> Key words: Malignant biliary obstruction, percutaneous <b>transhepatic</b> <b>cholangiography,</b> bile duct dilatation, serum bilirubin levels Giriş ve Amaç: Bu çalışmanın amacı, malign nedenlere bağlı tıkanma ikteri tanısı alarak perkütan transhepatik kolanjiografi yapılan hastalar-da, safra yollarındaki dilatasyonun perkütan transhepatik kolanjiografi aracılığıyla saptanan ölçüm değeri ile plazma bilirubin değerleri arasınd...|$|E

It may also be of value in avoiding operation in poor-risk patients with obstructive jaundice. Biliary leak resulting in chemical peritonitis is a complication in about 5 % of these procedures. Intraperitoneal hemorrhage is a complication in less than 1 %. Death results from the procedure in less than 0. 5 % of cases. <b>Transhepatic</b> <b>cholangiography</b> during surgical operation is of value in demonstrating obstructive lesions of the bile ducts.

40|$|Though local {{practice}} will reflect the previously acquired {{expertise of the}} operators, {{it seems reasonable to}} employ a minimum of percutaneous <b>transhepatic</b> <b>cholangiography,</b> and, ideally, this in combination with ERCP for preoperative cholangiography in patients with cholestatic jaundice.
