50|$|In {{gardening}} and other agriculture, magnesium sulfate {{is used to}} correct a magnesium or sulfur deficiency in soil; magnesium is an essential element in the chlorophyll molecule, and sulfur is another important micronutrient. It is most commonly applied <b>to</b> <b>potted</b> <b>plants,</b> or <b>to</b> magnesium-hungry crops, such as potatoes, roses, tomatoes, lemon trees, carrots, and peppers. The advantage of magnesium sulfate over other magnesium soil amendments (such as dolomitic lime) is its high solubility, which also allows the option of foliar feeding. Solutions of magnesium sulfate are also nearly neutral, compared with alkaline salts of magnesium as found in limestone; therefore, the use of magnesium sulfate as a magnesium source for soil does not significantly change the soil pH.|$|R

40|$|Now days, due to busy routine life, {{people forget}} to water their plants. In this paper, {{we present a}} {{completely}} autonomous and a cost-effective system for watering indoor <b>potted</b> <b>plants</b> placed on an even surface. The system comprises of a mobile robot and a temperature-humidity sensing module. The system is fully adaptive to any environment and {{takes into account the}} watering needs of the plants using the temperature-humidity sensing module. The paper describes the hardware architecture of the fully automated watering system which uses wireless communication to communicate between the mobile robot and the sensing module. This gardening robot is completely portable and is equipped with a Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) module, a microcontroller, an on-board water reservoir and an attached water pump. It is capable of sensing the watering needs of the plants, locating them and finally watering them autonomously without any human intervention. Mobilization of the robot <b>to</b> the <b>potted</b> <b>plant</b> is achieved by using a predefined path. For identification, an RFID tag is attached <b>to</b> each <b>potted</b> <b>plant.</b> The paper also discusses the detailed implementation of the system supported with complete circuitry.

To reach this goal, predictive models of soil-plant-atmosphere water transfer could be helpful. However, such {{models have been}} mainly developed for open field conditions, and very few models exist for greenhouse <b>plants</b> grown in <b>pots.</b> Moreover, most of these models were implemented under well-watered conditions, but very few are available under water restriction. The {{aim of this study}} is to develop an integrated soil-plant-atmosphere water balance model applied <b>to</b> <b>potted</b> <b>plants</b> grown in greenhouses, to predict plant transpiration under different restrictive irrigation regimes. Implementing such a model requires an accurate estimation of stomatal resistance Rs under water restriction conditions. Rs is then used in the Penman-Monteith model to evaluate transpiration. To establish the model parameters, an experiment was conducted for sixteen weeks inside a greenhouse with ornamental plants (New Guinea Impatiens) grown in containers on shelves. Well-watered and water restriction conditions were applied. The peat matric potential, radiation, temperature and humidity were continuously recorded, while Rs was measured and transpiration was assessed every half-hour from 8 : 00 am to 8 : 00 pm 10, 11, 12, 14, and 16 weeks after planting. The resulting model was first validated against experimental measurements during the twelfth week of the experiment. It displayed good correlations for both the instantaneous data and integrated total transpiration. Different scenarios of irrigation reduction (frequency x volume) were tested and the results indicated real potential for water use reduction. Indeed, by reducing water application by 50 % and by applying one irrigation per day, transpiration was not affecte...|$|R
