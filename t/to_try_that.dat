5|$|The Via Panisperna boys {{also noticed}} some unexplained effects. The {{experiment}} {{seemed to work}} better on a wooden table than a marble table top. Fermi remembered that Joliot-Curie and Chadwick had noted that paraffin wax was effective at slowing neutrons, so he decided <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>that.</b> When neutrons were passed through paraffin wax, they induced a hundred times as much radioactivity in silver compared with when it was bombarded without the paraffin. Fermi guessed that {{this was due to}} the hydrogen atoms in the paraffin. Those in wood similarly explained the difference between the wooden and the marble table tops. This was confirmed by repeating the effect with water. He concluded that collisions with hydrogen atoms slowed the neutrons. The lower the atomic number of the nucleus it collides with, the more energy a neutron loses per collision, and therefore the less collisions that are required to slow a neutron down by a given amount. Fermi realised that this induced more radioactivity because slow neutrons were more easily captured than fast ones. He developed a diffusion equation to describe this, which became known as the Fermi age equation.|$|E
2500|$|While {{the game}} was well received, some reviewers were {{disappointed}} {{that there was no}} option to restart a race or event. Instead the player had to either fail the event, or cancel the race by bringing the vehicle to a stop for a few seconds, and then return to the specific place on the map <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>that</b> particular race or event again. [...] Criterion responded to this criticism by stating that they don't feel that this is a problem and that adding a [...] "retry" [...] option would introduce loading screens, which they [...] "hate with a passion". Despite this, the option to restart an event was later added to the game via a free software update. EuroGamer found DJ Atomika, the game's guide, to be [...] "instantly dislikeable".|$|E
2500|$|On November 11, 1948, {{the station}} adopted the callsign WHK-FM. [...] In 1958, both WHK and WHK-FM {{were sold to}} Metropolitan Broadcasting, itself renamed MetroMedia two years later. [...] Like most early FM stations, WHK-FM mostly {{simulcast}} the Top 40 programming of its AM sister station. [...] In 1966, {{in an effort to}} make the medium more commercially viable, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) mandated that FM stations could no longer duplicate the programming of their AM sister stations. [...] Seeing a small but significant groundswell of support for the medium in the market, WHK-FM adopted a new progressive rock format on August 15, 1968. [...] WHK-FM became one of a handful of commercial stations in the country <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>that</b> format, many of which were owned by MetroMedia. [...] In order to firmly establish a separate identity, and to reflect the station's ownership, the WHK-FM callsign was changed to WMMS on September 28, 1968.|$|E
