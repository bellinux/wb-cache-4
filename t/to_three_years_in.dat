5|$|After knifing {{another man}} during a fight, {{in an attack}} he claimed was {{triggered}} by the abuse he had suffered since the trial, Smith was sentenced <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>years</b> <b>in</b> prison in 1969. That same year his children were taken into {{the care of the}} local authority. His wife Maureen moved from Underwood Court to a single-bedroom property, and found work in a department store. Subjected to whispering campaigns and petitions to remove her from the estate where she lived, she received no support from her family—her mother had supported Myra during the trial. On his release from prison, David Smith moved in with the girl who became his second wife and won custody of his three sons. Maureen managed to repair the relationship with her mother, and moved into a council property in Gorton. She divorced Smith in 1973, and married a lorry driver, Bill Scott, with whom she had a daughter.|$|E

5|$|Domesticated rats have {{a longer}} {{lifespan}} than that of wild rats. Because domesticated rats are protected from predators and have ready access to food, water, shelter, and medical care, their average lifespan is around two <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>years,</b> <b>in</b> contrast to wild R. norvegicus which average a lifespan of less than one year. However, wild rats generally have larger brains, hearts, livers, kidneys, and adrenal glands than laboratory rats. The fancy rat and wild rat also both face a multitude of differing health concerns; the former is at risk of developing a pneumococcal infection from exposure to humans, while the latter may harbor tapeworms after coming in contact with carriers like cockroaches and fleas.|$|E
5|$|The Assistant Commandant is {{nominated}} for appointment by the President {{and must be}} confirmed via majority vote by the Senate. In {{the event that the}} Commandant is absent or is unable to perform his duties, the Assistant Commandant assumes the duties and responsibilities of the Commandant. For this reason, the Assistant Commandant is appointed to a rank equal to the sitting Commandant; since 1971, each Assistant Commandant has been, by statute, a four-star general, making it the most common rank held among Marines serving this position. Additionally, he may perform other duties that the CMC assigns to him. Historically, the Assistant Comandant has served for two <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>years.</b> <b>In</b> recent decades, the Assistant Commandant has frequently been a Marine aviator. James F. Amos is the first aviator to serve as Assistant Commandant and then be promoted to Commandant.|$|E

5|$|The {{confrontation}} {{resulted in}} a further deterioration of the overall situation in Croatia, leading Croats and Serbs to accuse each other of overt aggression and of being enemies of their nation. For Croatia, the event was provocative because the bodies {{of some of the}} dead Croat policemen killed in the incident were reportedly mutilated. The clash in Borovo Selo eliminated any hopes that the escalating conflict could be defused politically and made the war almost inevitable. The Presidency of Yugoslavia met days after the fighting and authorised the JNA to deploy to the area to prevent further conflict but despite this deployment, skirmishes persisted in the region. After the war, a former Serb irregular was convicted of war crimes for his role in abusing two captured policemen, and ultimately sentenced <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>years</b> <b>in</b> prison. Four others were indicted in absentia but remain at large outside Croatia.|$|E
5|$|Hsu {{was able}} to gain the trust of investors by his dress, by his warm and personable manner, by his {{educational}} credentials, by being quoted in trade magazines, and by {{the long list of}} business under his name, but had a record of changing addresses and leaving disappointed investors behind. Starting in 1989, Hsu raised $1 million from investors to launch a latex glove business. Some of these partners invested their life savings or mortgaged their homes, and some sued Hsu when it appeared their money was lost. In 1990, Hsu, then living in Foster City, California, declared a bankruptcy, stating that he was practically destitute, with no job, no income, and few possessions other than an SUV and a ring. That same year, he was also divorced as well as allegedly kidnapped by San Francisco Triad society gang leader Raymond Kwok Chow. In 1991, California authorities brought fraud charges against him, describing his operation as a Ponzi scheme. Specifically, authorities claimed Hsu had not engaged in any legitimate business activity, but instead was using funds from later investors to pay returns to earlier ones. In February 1992 Hsu plead no contest to one count of grand theft and agreed to serve up <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>years</b> <b>in</b> prison and pay a $10,000 fine. Hsu subsequently failed to appear at the sentencing hearing and a warrant was issued for his arrest.|$|E
