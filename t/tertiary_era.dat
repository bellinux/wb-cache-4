5|$|During the Mesozoic (245 to 66 {{million years}} ago) the {{conifers}} flourished and became adapted {{to live in}} all the major terrestrial habitats. Subsequently, the tree forms of flowering plants evolved during the Cretaceous period. These began to dominate the conifers during the <b>Tertiary</b> <b>era</b> (66 to 2 million years ago) when forests covered the globe. When the climate cooled 1.5 million years ago and {{the first of four}} ice ages occurred, the forests retreated as the ice advanced. In the interglacials, trees recolonised the land that had been covered by ice, only to be driven back again in the next ice age.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the last}} ice age most of the {{vegetation}} in the Riding Mountain region was eliminated, and it remained this way after the retreat of the glaciers 12,500 years ago. The Riding Mountain upland and surrounding plains and Manitoba Escarpment were mostly carved in the <b>Tertiary</b> <b>era,</b> but the ice sheets of the Pleistocene period modified the drainage and appearance of the land. Only the movement of {{the last ice}} sheet in this period left a visible effect on the features of the region. About 11,500 years ago a spruce dominated forest began to emerge in its place, with some of the vegetation being ash, juniper, sedges, buffaloberry, and trembling aspen. After this time the climate was dry, and [...] the percentage of spruce decreased. During the Holocene climatic optimum up until 6500 years ago the amount of herbs, shrubs and grasses in the park increased. At the end of this time beaked hazelnut appeared and the amount of bur oak increased, with the climate becoming cooler and moister. Up to 2,500 years ago the amount of grassland species in general decreased and boreal forests migrated into the Riding Mountain region. It was at this moment that ecosystems began to resemble those of today, with species such as tamarack, fir, alder, pine and spruce becoming more common. Several streams that run through the park have headwaters in Riding Mountain's lakes. Clear Lake's water comes from underground springs rather than from streams.|$|E

40|$|A proton beam {{was used}} to {{investigate}} the elemental abundances of different samples via PIXE (Particle Induced X-ray Emission). The resulting X-ray spectra was then analysed using GUPIX. The experimental arrangement has been modified to include many new features. These features have been introduced to save time during and between runs, remove unwanted X-ray peaks caused by the argon {{in the air and}} make the geometry consistent between runs. The input files used to model the experimental arrangement and the detector properties were modified to improve the accuracy of fitting the data. Ten ceramic samples from various kiln sites in the French West Indies were investigated to see if there were similarities in elemental yields between the samples. Three samples were determined to be similar in elemental abundances to each other, yet different from the other samples. Two samples from the other seven showed strong similarities to each. A sample of rock, known as a core sample was investigated with PIXE. It was hoped that the sample of rock contained the boundary between the Cretaceous and <b>Tertiary</b> <b>eras,</b> known as the K-T boundary. One signature of the rock formed at the K-T boundary, is the abundance of iridium is significantly higher. Experimentally the presence of iridium was not found within this sample. Fossilised material was investigated. Strontium was present in all samples of mineralised fossils but not present in the impression fossil. This is an indicator that strontium was present in the life that formed the fossil. 2 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS I would like to thank my supervisor Prof. M. Wiescher, and Dr. P. H.

Some parent materials contain evaporitic sediments with salt, gypsum and high contents of alkaline materials which mostly prevent the growth of climax vegetation. The country has a rugged and high topography, related to tectonic movements, and volcanic activities which mainly occurred in <b>Tertiary</b> and Quaternary <b>eras.</b> The mountains are divided into three groups in terms of formation and ecological importance namely; orogenic mountains, volcanic mountains and uplifted blocks or horst mountains.

40|$|We {{study the}} phylogeography of Leopoldamys neilli, a {{threatened}} murine rodent species endemic to limestone karsts of Thailand, {{in order to}} assess the influence of its endemicity to karstic habitat on its intraspecific biodiversity and phylogeographic pattern. Samples of L. neilli were collected in limestone karsts from 20 localities in seven provinces of Thailand. Two mitochondrial markers, the cytochrome b gene (cytb) and the cytochrome c oxydase subunit I gene (COI), were sequenced for 115 L. neilli individuals. A nuclear fragment, the β-fibrinogen intron 7 (bfibr), was amplified in a subset of 65 samples. Phylogenetic reconstructions and median joining networks were used to explore relationships between haplotypes of the studied populations. Haplotype and nucleotide diversities of the main lineages were estimated for each locus. Divergence times of the main lineages of L. neilli were estimated using Bayesian inference. The demographic histories of the main lineages of L. neilli were also examined. Our study gave evidence of a strong geographic structure of the genetic diversity for L. neilli. Six highly differentiated genetic lineages were observed in the phylogenetic and phylogeographic analyses. These lineages are allopatric and correspond to particular regions of Thailand. They exhibit very high degree of genetic divergence and gene flows between them are extremely low. Within each lineage, the levels of haplotype and nucleotide diversities are very low for each gene. These results suggest a severe fragmentation of L. neilli’s populations, correlated to the fragmented distribution of its habitat and highlight its high endemicity to limestone karsts. The strong phylogeographic pattern of L. neilli and the very ancient separation of some lineages could be explained by the geological history of Thailand during <b>Tertiary</b> and Quaternary <b>era.</b> In conclusion, this study revealed an unexpectedly high level of intraspecific biodiversity within the species L. neilli. These results consolidate the importance to strengthen the protection of limestone habitats and to preserve not only their huge interspecific but also intraspecific biodiversity. Peer reviewe...|$|R
