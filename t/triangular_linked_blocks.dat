50|$|The Jansen linkage is of type (5, 2, 1, 0), {{because the}} upper <b>triangular</b> <b>link</b> {{supports}} four joints, {{two of which}} overlap at the ground joint, the lower <b>triangular</b> <b>link</b> and the input crank connect three joints and are ternary links. The remaining five links, which includes the ground link, are binary links.|$|R
50|$|The FST {{entry points}} to the first chain <b>link</b> <b>block</b> for the file. The first chain <b>link</b> <b>block</b> {{contains}} the disk addresses of up to 40 additional chain <b>link</b> <b>blocks,</b> followed by the disk addresses of up to 60 data blocks. The remaining chain <b>link</b> <b>blocks</b> each contain the disk addresses of up to 400 data blocks. {{this results in a}} maximum size of 16,060 800-byte blocks, or 12,848,000 bytes, for any CMS file. The maximum number of records in one file is 65,533.|$|R

50|$|The Ganz {{form was}} {{used on the}} Hungarian-built Les Belles Hongroisses 2BB2 400 {{locomotives}} for the French PO. This had four links forming the triangle, with the two upper vertices mounted to the locomotive frame (through a short swinging link) and to the jackshaft crankpin. The lower apex of the triangle contained a short <b>triangular</b> <b>link,</b> which linked {{the sides of the}} triangle to the wheel crankpin. By tilting this link, the suspension movement was absorbed. This linkage ran well at speed and as it was composed entirely of pivoting joints with no sliding, there was no lost motion. It was however complex, heavy and unbalanced.|$|R
50|$|An {{enhancement}} to {{the original}} CMS file system in z/VM, called Enhanced Disk Format (EDF), allows larger files by expanding the FST and introducing multiple levels of chain <b>link</b> <b>blocks.</b>|$|R

50|$|The eight {{bars of the}} Jansen linkage, {{which include}} the ground frame, are readily identified, and include two <b>triangular</b> <b>links.</b> In this case only seven of the 10 hinged joints are readily identified. However, there are three joints that connect three links. The first {{is the end of}} the drive crank, the second is the other base pivot and the third is one side of the {{triangle}} that forms the lower leg. Separating these overlapping joints provides three additional joints so there are 10 single degree-of-freedom joints.|$|R
50|$|The bakery is one shop {{within a}} row of single story masonry shops built conjointly {{on the south side}} of Churchill Street, {{adjoining}} the Palace Hotel.

50|$|Track-At-Once (TAO) is a {{recording}} mode where the recording laser stops after each track is finished and two run-out blocks are written.

50|$|Unlike the Walschaerts and Baker systems, the Southern {{valve gear}} {{dispensed}} with the combination lever which transmitted {{some of the}} crosshead motion to the valves. As with those systems it used a return crank on a driver (instead of the eccentrics used by the Stephenson valve gear). The return crank attached to the eccentric rod, which hung from a pivot close {{to the far end}} of the eccentric rod. This pivot attached to the end of the radius hanger, the other end of which attached to a <b>link</b> <b>block</b> which slid back and forth in a track curved in the same manner as the expansion link of a Walschaerts gear. In this system, however, the track was fixed in place; sliding the <b>link</b> <b>block</b> back and forth controlled reversing and cutoff.|$|R

30|$|To {{overcome}} the issues faced in complex neural structures, a computationally simple and adaptive ARMA-functional link neural architecture and an adaptive cubature Kalman filter (ACKF) learning approach [22, 24, 25] {{is presented in}} this work.

40|$|Standard Web graph {{representation}} {{fails to}} capture topic association and functional groupings of links and their occurrence across {{pages in the}} site. That limits its applicability and usefulness. In this paper we introduce a novel method for representing hypertext organization of Web sites {{in the form of}} Link Structure Graphs (LSGs). The LSG captures both the organization of links at the page level and the overall hyperlink structure of the collection of pages. It comprises vertices that correspond to <b>link</b> <b>blocks</b> of several types and edges that describe reuse of such blocks across pages. Identification of <b>link</b> <b>blocks</b> is approximated by the analysis of the HTML Document Object Model (DOM). Further differentiation of blocks into types is based on the recurrence of block elements across pages. The method gives rise to a compact representation of all the hyperlinks on the site and enables novel analysis of the site organization. Our approach is supported by the findings of an exploratory user study that reveals how the hyperlink structure is generally perceived by the users. We apply the algorithm to a sample of Web sites and discuss their link structure properties. Furthermore, we demonstrate that selective crawling strategies can be applied to generate key elements of the LSG incrementally. This further broadens the scope of LSG applicability...|$|R
