25|$|According to the American Enterprise Institute, {{research}} has shown that income and intelligence are related. In a 1998 study, Charles Murray compared the earnings of 733 full sibling pairs with differing intelligence quotients (IQs). He referred to the sample as utopian in that the sampled pairs were raised in families with virtually no illegitimacy, divorce or poverty. The average earnings of sampled individuals <b>with</b> <b>an</b> IQ of under 75 was $11,000, compared to $16,000 for <b>those</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> IQ between 75 and 90, $23,000 for <b>those</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> IQ between 90 and 110, $27,000 for <b>those</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> IQ between 110 and 125, and $38,000 for <b>those</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> IQ above 125.

5|$|The {{compressibility}} of an ionic compound {{is strongly}} determined by its structure, {{and in particular}} the coordination number.

5|$|The {{disease is}} caused by {{bacteria}} that spread from the vagina and cervix. Infections by Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Chlamydia trachomatis are present in 75 to 90 percent of cases. Often multiple different bacteria are involved. Without treatment about 10 percent of <b>those</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> chlamydial infection and 40 percent of <b>those</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> gonorrhea infection will develop PID. Risk factors {{are similar to those}} of sexually transmitted infections generally and include a high number of sexual partners and drug use. Vaginal douching may also increase the risk. The diagnosis is typically based on the presenting signs and symptoms. It is recommended that the disease be considered in all women of childbearing age who have lower abdominal pain. A definitive diagnosis of PID is made by finding pus involving the fallopian tubes during surgery. Ultrasound may also be useful in diagnosis.|$|E
