25|$|Ten Days <b>That</b> <b>Shook</b> <b>the</b> World has {{received}} mixed responses since its publication in 1919, {{resulting in a}} wide range of critical reviews from negative to positive. However, the book was overall positively received by critics at the time of its first publication, despite some critics’ vocal opposition to Reed’s political beliefs.|$|E
25|$|Ten Days <b>That</b> <b>Shook</b> <b>the</b> World (1919) {{is a book}} by the American {{journalist}} and socialist John Reed about the October Revolution in Russia in 1917, which Reed experienced firsthand. Reed followed many of the prominent Bolshevik leaders closely during his time in Russia. John Reed died in 1920, shortly after the book was finished, and {{he is one of}} the few Americans buried at the Kremlin Wall Necropolis in Moscow, a site normally reserved only for the most prominent Soviet leaders.|$|E

25|$|On August 15, 2009, {{five days}} before the election, a suicide car bomb struck NATO's {{headquarters}} {{at the core of}} Kabul's most fortified district, in the equivalent of Baghdad's Green Zone. The massive blast <b>that</b> <b>shook</b> <b>the</b> city left seven people dead and 91 wounded, including several foreign soldiers, four Afghan soldiers, and a member of parliament. The attack, inside several rings of security around the fortified embassies and government buildings by the presidential palace, was confirmed by a Taliban spokesperson to have had as targets the NATO military headquarters (HQ ISAF) and the U.S. embassy less than 150 meters away, and to have been part of a campaign to disrupt the elections.|$|E
25|$|The Marshall Plan was {{not universally}} popular, {{especially}} in its initial phase. It benefited some trades such as metallurgy but depressed others such as agriculture. Heavy industries quickly recovered, from 74.7% of pre-war output in 1948 to 150.7% in 1951. American planners deliberately neglected consumer goods industries, construction trades and small business. Their workers, {{almost half of}} the industrial workforce, suffered from rising unemployment. In 1948–1949, a substantial share of Marshall Plan funds was used to subsidize imports of food. American money effectively raised real wages: the grain price was about one-third of the world price, while agriculture remained in ruins. Marshall Plan aid gradually removed many of the causes of popular unrest <b>that</b> <b>shook</b> <b>the</b> country in 1947, but Austria remained dependent on food imports.|$|E

25|$|But not all {{responses}} were positive. Joseph Stalin argued in 1924 that Reed was misleading {{in regards to}} Leon Trotsky. The book portrays Trotsky (head of the Red Army) {{as a man who}} co-led the revolution with Lenin and mentions Stalin only twice—one of them being only in the recitation of a list of names, as both Lenin and Trotsky were internationally known, whereas the activities of other Bolshevik militants were virtually unknown. Russian writer Anatoly Rybakov elaborates on Stalinist Soviet Union’s ban on Ten Days <b>that</b> <b>Shook</b> <b>the</b> World: “The main task was to build a mighty socialist state. For that, mighty power was needed. Stalin was at the head of that power, which mean that he stood at its source with Lenin. Together with Lenin he led the October Revolution. John Reed had presented the history of October differently. That wasn’t the John Reed we needed.” After Stalin’s death, the book was allowed to recirculate.|$|E
