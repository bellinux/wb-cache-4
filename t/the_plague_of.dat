5|$|Seven years later, in 542, {{a devastating}} {{outbreak}} of Bubonic Plague, known as <b>the</b> <b>Plague</b> <b>of</b> Justinian and {{second only to}} that of the 14th century, laid siege to the world, killing tens of millions. As ruler of the Empire, Justinian, and members of his court, were physically unaffected by famine. However, the Imperial Court did prove susceptible to plague, with Justinian himself contracting, but surviving, the pestilence.|$|E
5|$|The {{conclusion}} that the army's size remained constant between 235 and 285 appears implausible, as this period saw the Third Century Crisis, during which the army's recruitment capacity was severely diminished by the impact of <b>the</b> <b>Plague</b> <b>of</b> Cyprian, numerous civil wars and devastating barbarian invasions.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>plague</b> {{repeatedly}} {{returned to}} haunt Europe and the Mediterranean from 14th through 17th centuries. Notable later outbreaks include <b>the</b> Italian <b>Plague</b> <b>of</b> 1629–1631, <b>the</b> Great <b>Plague</b> <b>of</b> Seville (1647–1652), <b>the</b> Great <b>Plague</b> <b>of</b> London (1665–1666), <b>the</b> Great <b>Plague</b> <b>of</b> Vienna (1679), <b>the</b> Great <b>Plague</b> <b>of</b> Marseille in 1720–1722 and <b>the</b> 1771 <b>plague</b> in Moscow.|$|R
50|$|The {{next few}} centuries {{were marked by}} several {{localized}} or regional outbreaks of lesser severity. <b>The</b> Great <b>Plague</b> <b>of</b> Milan (1629-1631), <b>the</b> Great <b>Plague</b> <b>of</b> Seville (1647), <b>the</b> Great <b>Plague</b> <b>of</b> London (1665-1666), <b>the</b> Great <b>Plague</b> <b>of</b> Vienna (1679), Great Baltic <b>plague</b> (1708-1712), <b>the</b> Great <b>Plague</b> <b>of</b> Marseille (1720), <b>the</b> Great <b>Plague</b> <b>of</b> 1738, and Caragea's <b>Plague</b> (1813-1814) were <b>the</b> last major outbreaks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bubonic <b>plague</b> in Europe.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>plague</b> {{returned}} {{at intervals}} with varying virulence and mortality {{until the early}} 19th century. In England, for example, <b>the</b> <b>plague</b> returned in 1360-63 killing 20% of Londoners and in 1369 killing 10-15%. In the 17th-century outbreaks were a series of [...] "great plagues": <b>the</b> Great <b>Plague</b> <b>of</b> Seville (1647-52); <b>the</b> Great <b>Plague</b> <b>of</b> London (1665-66); and <b>the</b> Great <b>Plague</b> <b>of</b> Vienna (1679). In its virulent form, after <b>the</b> Great <b>Plague</b> <b>of</b> Marseille in 1720-22, <b>the</b> Great <b>Plague</b> <b>of</b> 1738 (which hit Eastern Europe), and <b>the</b> Russian <b>plague</b> <b>of</b> 1770-1772, {{it seems to have}} gradually disappeared from Europe though lingering in Egypt and the Middle East. By the early 19th century, <b>the</b> threat <b>of</b> <b>plague</b> had diminished, but it was quickly replaced by a new disease. The Asiatic cholera was the first of several cholera pandemics to sweep through Asia and Europe during the 19th and 20th centuries.|$|R
5|$|In 1918, {{novelist and}} playwright George Cram Cook {{produced}} his first full-length play, The Athenian Women (an adaption of Lysistrata), which portrays Aspasia leading a strike for peace. Cook combined an anti-war theme with a Greek setting. American writer Gertrude Atherton in The Immortal Marriage (1927) treats {{the story of}} Pericles and Aspasia and illustrates {{the period of the}} Samian War, the Peloponnesian War and <b>the</b> <b>Plague</b> <b>of</b> Athens. Taylor Caldwell's Glory and the Lightning (1974) is another novel that portrays the historical relationship of Aspasia and Pericles.|$|E
5|$|In 429 BC during <b>the</b> <b>Plague</b> <b>of</b> Athens, Pericles {{witnessed}} {{the death of}} his sister and of both his legitimate sons, Paralus and Xanthippus, from his first wife. With his morale undermined, he burst into tears, and not even Aspasia's companionship could console him. Just before his death, the Athenians allowed a change in the citizenship law of 451 BC that made his half-Athenian son with Aspasia, Pericles the Younger, a citizen and legitimate heir, a decision all the more striking in considering that Pericles himself had proposed the law confining citizenship to those of Athenian parentage on both sides. Pericles died of the plague in the autumn of 429 BC.|$|E
5|$|Morell {{continued}} {{to appear in}} Hammer's horror films in the ensuing decade.

He also starred with Cushing in Hammer's Cash on Demand, playing the same role he had played opposite Richard Vernon in the original TV play, The Gold Inside. He turned down the opportunity of reprising the title role in Hammer's feature film adaptation of Quatermass and the Pit (1967). He {{did not wish to}} repeat himself.|$|E

5|$|White Zombie is {{considered}} to be the first feature length zombie film and has been described as the archetype and model of all zombie movies. Not many early horror films followed White Zombies Haitian origins style. Other horror films from the 1930s borrowed themes from White Zombie, such as people returning from the dead and other elements of zombie mythology. These films include: The Ghost Breakers (1940), King of the Zombies (1941), I Walked with a Zombie (1943), and <b>The</b> <b>Plague</b> <b>of</b> the Zombies (1966). These films all contain elements from White Zombie including the blank-eyed stares, the voodoo drums, and zombies performing manual labor.|$|E

5|$|Fleas {{arose in}} the early Cretaceous, most likely as ectoparasites of mammals, {{before moving on to}} other groups {{including}} birds. Each species of flea is more or less a specialist on its host animal species: many species never breed on any other host, though some are less selective. Some families of fleas are exclusive to a single host group: for example, the Malacopsyllidae are found only on armadillos, the Ischnopsyllidae only on bats, and the Chimaeropsyllidae only on elephant shrews. The oriental rat flea, Xenopsylla cheopis, is a vector of Yersinia pestis, the bacterium which causes bubonic plague. The disease was spread by rodents such as the black rat, which were bitten by fleas that then infected humans. Major outbreaks included <b>the</b> <b>Plague</b> <b>of</b> Justinian and the Black Death, both of which killed a sizeable fraction of the world's population.|$|E
5|$|In {{the mid to}} late 3rd century, {{the army}} was afflicted by a {{combination}} of military disasters and of pestilence, the so-called Crisis of the Third Century. In 251–271 Gaul, the Alpine regions and Italy, the Balkans and the East were simultaneously overrun by Alamanni, Sarmatians, Goths and Persians respectively. At the same time, the Roman army was struggling with the effects of a devastating pandemic, probably of smallpox: <b>the</b> <b>Plague</b> <b>of</b> Cyprian which began in 251 and was still raging in 270, when it claimed the life of emperor Claudius II Gothicus. The evidence for an earlier pandemic, the Antonine Plague (also smallpox) indicates a mortality of 15–30% in the empire as a whole. The armies would likely have suffered deaths at the top end of the range, due to their close concentration of individuals and frequent movements across the empire. This probably led to a steep decline in military numbers, which only recovered {{at the end of the}} century under Diocletian (r. 284–305).|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>plague</b> during <b>the</b> Great Northern War {{falls within}} the second pandemic, which by the late 17th century had its final {{recurrence}} in Western Europe (e.g. <b>the</b> Great <b>Plague</b> <b>of</b> London 1666–68) and, in the 18th century final recurrences in the rest <b>of</b> Europe (e.g. <b>the</b> <b>plague</b> during <b>the</b> Great Northern War in the Circum-Baltic, <b>the</b> Great <b>Plague</b> <b>of</b> Marseille 1720–22 in southern Europe, and <b>the</b> Russian <b>plague</b> <b>of</b> 1770–1772 in eastern Europe), being thereafter confined to less severe outbreaks in ports of the Ottoman Empire until the 1830s.|$|R

5|$|Immunology is {{a science}} that {{examines}} the structure and function of the immune system. It originates from medicine and early studies on the causes of immunity to disease. The earliest known reference to immunity was during <b>the</b> <b>plague</b> <b>of</b> Athens in 430 BC. Thucydides noted that people who had recovered from a previous bout of the disease could nurse the sick without contracting the illness a second time. In the 18th century, Pierre-Louis Moreau de Maupertuis made experiments with scorpion venom and observed that certain dogs and mice were immune to this venom. This and other observations of acquired immunity were later exploited by Louis Pasteur in his development of vaccination and his proposed germ theory of disease. Pasteur's theory was in direct opposition to contemporary theories of disease, such as the miasma theory. It was not until Robert Koch's 1891 proofs, {{for which he was}} awarded a Nobel Prize in 1905, that microorganisms were confirmed as the cause of infectious disease. Viruses were confirmed as human pathogens in 1901, with the discovery of the yellow fever virus by Walter Reed.|$|E
5|$|Other historians, {{including}} Richard Abels, P. Grosjean, and Alan Thacker, {{state that}} Deusdedit died on 14 July 664. The main argument was {{put forward by}} Grosjean, who claimed that Bede had the consecration date wrong, as 26 May was Maundy Thursday in 655, not a date that would normally have been chosen for a consecration. Grosjean argues that the best method for resolving the conflicts is to just take 14July 664 as the date of death, and figure backwards with the length of reign given by Bede, which gives a consecration date of 12March 655. Thacker and Abels agree generally, although Thacker does not give a specific consecration date beyond March. Abels adds to Grosjean's arguments Bede's association of Deusdedit's death with that of King Eorcenberht, which Bede gives as occurring on the same day. Bede states that <b>the</b> <b>plague</b> <b>of</b> 664 began soon after the eclipse on 1May. Nothing in Bede contradicts the date of 14July 664 for Eorcenberht; therefore, Abels considers that date {{to be the best}} fit for the available data. The historian D. P. Kirby agrees that Deusdedit died in 664, although he does not give a precise date within that year.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps 10 {{per cent}} of the {{population}} lived in the burghs that {{had grown up in}} the later medieval period, mainly in the east and south of the country. They perhaps had an average population of 2,000, but many were much smaller than 1,000, and the largest, Edinburgh, probably had a population of over 10,000 {{at the beginning of the}} period. Edinburgh doubled in size in the century after 1540, particularly after <b>the</b> <b>plague</b> <b>of</b> 1580, with most of its population probably coming from a growing reservoir in the surrounding countryside. It also expanded beyond the city walls in suburbs at Cowgate, Bristo and Westport and by 1750, with its suburbs, it had reached a population of 57,000. The only other towns above 10,000 by the end of the period were Glasgow with 32,000, Aberdeen with around 16,000 and Dundee with 12,000. By 1600 Scotland had a higher proportion of its population living in larger towns than contemporaneous Scandinavia, Switzerland and most of Eastern Europe: by 1750 in Europe, only Italy, the Low Countries and England were more urbanised than Scotland.|$|E

5|$|The mid-3rd century saw {{the empire}} {{plunged into a}} {{military}} and economic crisis which almost resulted in its disintegration. It consisted {{of a series of}} military catastrophes in 251–271 when Gaul, the Alpine regions and Italy, the Balkans and the East were overrun by Alamanni, Sarmatians, Goths and Persians. At the same time, the Roman army was struggling with the effects of a devastating pandemic, now thought to have been smallpox, <b>the</b> <b>Plague</b> <b>of</b> Cyprian which began in 251 and was still raging in 270, when it claimed the life of Emperor Claudius II Gothicus (268–70). The evidence for the earlier Antonine pandemic of the late 2nd century, probably also smallpox, indicates a mortality of 15–30% in the empire as a whole. Zosimus describes the Cyprianic outbreak as even worse. The armies and, by extension, the frontier provinces where they were based (and mainly recruited), would likely have suffered deaths at the top end of the range, due to their close concentration of individuals and frequent movements across the empire.|$|E
25|$|A plague {{epidemic}} {{that followed}} the Great Northern War (1700–1721, Sweden v. Russia and allies) wiped out almost 1/3 {{of the population in}} the region.
