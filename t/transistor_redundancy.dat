40|$|As the {{technology}} shrinks to nano-scale, CMOS transistors pose more challenges to circuit design. One of the reliability challenges is time dependant dielectric breakdown. Power gating {{is an effective}} method for leakage power reduction. However the power gating transistor has the highest change of dielectric breakdown. We propose a breakdown detection and repair method to enhance the reliability of power gating in nano-scale by optimally introducing sleep <b>transistor</b> <b>redundancy.</b> We also propose a modeling and optimization framework to optimize the trade-off between area overhead and overall breakdown probability. The results of implementation in a predictive 32 nm technology shows that with an area constraint of 2 % overhead for a benchmark circuit, the failure probability is reduced to 7. 5 e- 18 and with the constraint of le- 6 failure probability, the area overhead is 1. 3 % of {{the area of the}} benchmark circuit...|$|E
40|$|Fault {{tolerance}} is {{an increasing}} challenge for integrated circuits due to semiconductor technology scaling. Triple modular redundancy {{is often used to}} achieve fault tolerance in digital circuits, but this method is inefficient. By exploiting the analogue nature of CMOS <b>transistors,</b> more efficient <b>redundancy</b> techniques may be applied. This paper looks at how artificial evolution may be guided towards the creation of redundancy structures at the CMOS transistor level. A preliminary experiment is performed that successfully evolves redundant stuck-open defect tolerant digital inverters...|$|R
40|$|The {{start of}} the digital {{revolution}} came through the metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) in 1959 followed by massive integration onto a silicon die by means of constant down scaling of individual components. Digital systems for certain applications require fault-tolerance against faults caused by temporary or permanent influence. The most widely used technique is triple module redundancy (TMR) {{in conjunction with a}} majority voter, which is regarded as a passive fault mitigation strategy. Design by functional resilience has been applied to circuit structures for increased fault-tolerance and towards self-diagnostic triggered self-healing. The focus of this thesis is therefore to develop new design strategies for fault detection and mitigation within transistor, gate and cell design levels. The research described in this thesis makes three contributions. The first contribution is based on adding fine-grained <b>transistor</b> level <b>redundancy</b> to logic gates in order to accomplish stuck-at fault-tolerance. The objective is to realise maximum fault-masking for a logic gate with minimal added redundant transistors. In the case of non-maskable stuck-at faults, the gate structure generates an intrinsic indication signal that is suitable for autonomous self-healing functions. As a result, logic circuitry utilising this design is now able to differentiate between gate faults and faults occurring in inter-gate connections. This distinction between fault-types can then be used for triggering selective self-healing responses. The second contribution is a logic matrix element which applies the three core redundancy concepts of spatial- temporal- and data-redundancy. This logic structure is composed of quad-modular redundant structures and is capable of selective fault-masking and localisation depending of fault-type at the cell level, which is referred to as a spatiotemporal quadded logic cell (QLC) structure. This QLC structure has the capability of cellular self-healing. Through the combination of fault-tolerant and masking logic features the QLC is designed with a fault-behaviour that is equal to existing quadded logic designs using only 33. 3...|$|R
40|$|Integrated {{circuits}} {{have been}} in constant progression since the first prototype in 1958. The semiconductor industry has maintained a constant rate of miniaturisation of transistors and wires, resulting in ever increasing speed, size and complexity of circuits. One challenge {{that has always been}} present is reduced yield due to production defects. A certain amount of chips must be scrapped because production defects have rendered the chips unusable. Recent predictions suggest that the average number of production defects per chip will rise drastically in the future as CMOS scaling approaches the physical limits of what is possible to manufacture. If these predictions are true, circuits should exhibit some level of tolerance to defects so to keep yield at acceptable levels. The main contribution of the thesis is to the field of defect tolerance, with a focus on FPGAs. Apart from the widespread employment of FPGAs, two technical reasons make the FPGA especially suited for inclusion of defect tolerance techniques. The regular structure of the FPGA can be exploited for efficient redundancy techniques. In addition, the FPGA {{can be seen as a}} bridge between production and the application designer. Through defect tolerance techniques incorporated transparently in the FPGA, a fully functioning gate array can be provided to the application designer despite defects from production. The approach taken in this thesis is to search for new ways of introducing static hardware redundancy in a circuit through the application of artiffcial evolution. However, the challenge of applying evolutionary techniques provided a secondary contribution. The work provides a contribution to the field of artifficial evolution and the subfield evolvable hardware (EHW) by addressing ways in which such techniques may be applied to search for non-specifiable structures. The work is also bridging the fields of EHW and traditional hardware design and reliability metrics {{have been in}}vestigated for the purpose of comparing evolved and traditionally designed circuits. Redundant structures are first evolved for gate level circuits where both voter based solutions and more intricate non-voter based solutions are achieved. <b>Transistor</b> level <b>redundancy</b> structures are targeted next to approach the main goal of defect tolerance for FPGAs. A defect tolerant inverter is evolved which forms the basis of a general defect tolerance technique, termed the Multiple Short-Open (MSO) technique. The FPGA look-up table (LUT) is one of the essential components of the FPGA and a defect tolerant LUT is, therefore, constructed applying the MSO technique. An evolutionary experiment is also conducted where a defect tolerant 1 -input LUT is evolved directly.
