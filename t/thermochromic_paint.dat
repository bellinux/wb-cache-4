50|$|Thermochromic paints use {{of liquid}} {{crystals}} or leuco dye technology. After absorbing {{a certain amount}} of light or heat, the crystallic or molecular structure of the pigment reversibly changes {{in such a way that}} it absorbs and emits light at a different wavelength than at lower temperatures. Thermochromic paints are seen quite often as a coating on coffee mugs, whereby once hot coffee is poured into the mugs, the <b>thermochromic</b> <b>paint</b> absorbs the heat and becomes colored or transparent, therefore changing the appearance of the mug.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the problem of temperature estimation using <b>thermochromic</b> <b>paint.</b> We present a novel framework for recovering the temperature with an associated estimate of the covariance. 1 Introduction <b>Thermochromic</b> <b>paint</b> is paint that changes colour according to the maximum temperature it has experienced. Such paint {{has a variety of}} applications in the automotive industry. It is useful for measuring temperature in situations where other sensors cannot be used due to space, vibration or other operating conditions. An object may be coated with paint and placed in an experimental configuration. After exposure the object may be removed and the maximum temperature reached may be inferred from the paint. This is usually done by a human operator using calibration objects that have heated under known conditions. Thermochromic paints vary in composition and effective range. The colour variation is uneven, and the rate of colour change with (maximum) temperature varies considerably [...] . ...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to provide an {{automatic}} method for the interpretation of images of objects that are coated with thermal paint. Thermal paint changes colour permanently according to the temperature to which it is heated and can be employed as a temperature gauge where more cumbersome measurement apparatus may not be suitable. Such a gauge requires a means to convert the manifestation of the measurement to the corresponding numerical values. In our case this involves the grouping of ranges of colour together into temperature bands and the extraction of the temperature contours between these bands, a task currently performed by a human operator. This study will demonstrate some success in the automatic interpretation of thermal paints through computer vision approaches. In summary the main contributions of this work are: The demonstration that edge detection is not a useful step. Human operators tend to interpret <b>thermochromic</b> <b>paint</b> not simply by colour matching, but by locating prominent colour change points. We demonstrate why in our opinion this in not necessarily the best step through an exploration of colour edge detection. The development of a feature space model of the paint colour formation based on B-splines and the employment of this within a maximum likelihood estimation scheme [GKWG 96],[CSGW 97] The development of a paint interpretation method based on a Markov Random Field and Simulated Annealing [GSW+ 98] Our methods axe applicable to cases of ideal data. We highlight some troublesome paint artefacts that occur in real cases and that hinder interpretation. We discuss possible solutions. Finally we draw conclusions and point to directions for possible future work. Key words: <b>thermochromic</b> <b>paint,</b> maximum likelihood estimate, simulated annealing...|$|E
50|$|Various {{technologies}} {{exist for}} making paints that change color. <b>Thermochromic</b> <b>paints</b> and coatings contain materials that change conformation when heat is applied or removed, {{and so they}} change color. Liquid crystals {{have been used in}} such paints, such as in the thermometer strips and tapes used in aquaria and novelty/promotional thermal cups and straws. These materials are used to make eyeglasses.|$|R

Matsui Shikiso Chemical started {{offering}} {{a wide variety of}} products, mainly inks and pigments, targeted principally to the textile screen printing industry. Focusing as being an exclusive water base ink producer in the textile industry, Matsui's continued success led to establishing a subsidiary in Los Angeles, California to better service their growing international clientele. In 1987, Matsui International developed the first <b>thermochromic</b> <b>paints,</b> <b>thermochromic</b> inks, and thermochromic plastics, broadcast on Japan's national public channel, NHK (Nippon Hosoku Kaisha), introducing thermochromism to the world. In 1989 the subsidiary Matsui International Co., Inc., was founded, and is run by Masahiko Matsui, the grandson of Kenji Matsui. Soon after the establishment, Matsui entered the heat transfer business, under the trademark, Unimark USA.|$|R
40|$|Rolls-Royce {{is a well}} reputed and {{multinational}} company that develops and manufactures propulsion systems including gas turbines for many applications, with aerospace being the most well-known. In {{the process of developing}} new turbine engines to power ever larger, more efficient and environmentally friendly aircraft, the conditions within their engines are pushing the boundaries of what was previously thought possible. One of the major factors that needs to be considered and controlled in the engine development is the temperature at which the engine components are exposed to. Currently, temperatures produced within their engines are in excess of 1600 °C, which is far beyond the melting point of the metal alloys that make up the engine itself. Due to this, many creative cooling technologies have been modelled and implemented to reduce the temperatures experienced by engine components. These cooling technologies must be validated in situ with precise temperature analysis tools that can give accurate temperature readings on moving parts, deep within the engine. Of the tools available, thermal paints have proven to be highly effective and versatile. Thermal <b>paints</b> are irreversible <b>thermochromic</b> coatings that are applied to component surfaces, and on deconstruction of an engine, reveal the maximum temperatures reached and give a visual display of temperature gradients across a surface. These paints have been used within Rolls-Royce for over 50 years and are now a focal point for development due to recent REACH legislation preventing the use of many outdated pigments that are used within the paint formulations. This project was created to build an understanding of the chemistry behind the thermochromic effect and to develop new, safer <b>thermochromic</b> <b>paints</b> to secure the techniques future within the development of state of the art turbine engines. Two of Rolls-Royce’s thermal paints, TP 11 and TP 8, have been fully investigated and the previously unknown chemistry behind the thermochromic effect exhibited by these paints has been identified (Chapter 3). From the information gained from this initial investigation, new <b>thermochromic</b> <b>paints</b> based on REACH compliant compounds have been produced and characterised. The results obtained from this work have shown great promise and have had an influential impact within the aerospace industry...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose to}} take {{advantage}} of the wear resistance of aluminum matrix composites to make horse shoes. The aluminum matrix composites were developed in the automotive and aeronautic fields in the 80 's. From now on, the equestrian field should be a good opportunity if a viable material and manufg. process is found. Aluminum alloys are thought about due to their lightness, their damping capacity, and their casting at a lower temp. than iron. These alloys can be reinforced by tough ceramic particles. Mainly Alcan, in Canada, produces these composites. A casting alloy AS 7 G 06 (A 356) reinforced by SiC particles (15 - 20 mm in size and 15 % vol.) was chosen for this work. Ingots of this composite were melted and cast in an adapted mold. Using the CAO software and 3 D viewing, the shoeing smith managed to "carve" his piece of work on a computer screen as he could have done with a model. Computer files have then been used to direct a prototyping machine and achieve directly the metallic mold. These horse shoes were then placed when still hot on the horse hooves as it is done for iron. The composite horse shoes were painted with a <b>thermochromic</b> <b>paint</b> (used to control the temp. in jet engines) to control the setting temp. This paint becomes blue, then purple, then yellow at 400 ° and this is when the horse shoe must be placed. This composite shows the advantages of both aluminum and titanium light alloys together with a wear resistance similar to some traditional iron alloys...|$|E
40|$|Combustion {{tests with}} {{bioethanol}} and diesel {{as a reference}} have been performed in OPRA's 2 MWe class OP 16 gas turbine combustor. The main purposes of this work are to investigate the combustion quality of ethanol with respect to diesel and to validate the developed CFD model for ethanol spray combustion. The experimental investigation has been conducted in a modified OP 16 gas turbine combustor, which is a reverse-flow tubular combustor of the diffusion type. Bioethanol and diesel burning experiments have been performed at atmospheric pressure with a thermal input ranging from 29 to 59 [*]kW. Exhaust gas temperature and emissions (CO, CO 2, O 2, NOx) were measured at various fuel flow rates while keeping the air flow rate and air temperature constant. In addition, the temperature profile of the combustor liner has been determined by applying <b>thermochromic</b> <b>paint.</b> CFD simulations have been performed with ethanol for five different operating conditions using ANSYS FLUENT. The simulations {{are based on a}} 3 D RANS code. Fuel droplets representing the fuel spray are tracked throughout the domain while they interact with the gas phase. A liner temperature measurement has been used to account for heat transfer through the flame tube wall. Detailed combustion chemistry is included by using the steady laminar flamelet model. Comparison between diesel and bioethanol burning tests show similar CO emissions, but NOx concentrations are lower for bioethanol. The CFD results for CO 2 and O 2 are in good agreement, proving the overall integrity of the model. NOx concentrations were found to be in fair agreement, but the model failed to predict CO levels in the exhaust gas. Simulations of the fuel spray suggest that some liner wetting might have occurred. However, this finding could not be clearly confirmed by the test dat...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the early}} 2000 s, {{primarily}} research-based projects {{have focused on}} the use of new materials such as shape-memory alloys, light-emitting diodes (LED), film-encased photovoltaic cells and <b>thermochromic</b> <b>paints.</b> These materials offer a wide range of outstanding possibilities to the construction industry through their capacity to sense and respond to external environmental stimuli. However, the advent of smart materials – multifunctional materials that are designed by chemists, physicists and biologists - pose challenges for design practices exploring such innovations. Given the rich potential of these emerging materials and technologies for architecture, I was intrigued to know: what is necessary to introduce these materials in architecture? In this thesis, I report on design strategies that involve extrinsic and intrinsic material properties. My research strategies included the use of digital design tools, physical computing and haptic-intuitive workflows in order to bypass a lengthy iterative design and analysis process through rapid intuitive feedback. My research demonstrates the necessity of both a digital and physical interaction with previously little- or un-used engineered advanced materials, if the use of those materials is to drive change in the overall material system. This proposition is developed and tested by practice-based research and design explorations. Centred on the idea of material-driven design processes, my research addresses the work of architects, engineers and materials scientists and locates opportunities for working together within a trans-disciplinary environment. Having direct interaction with materials and their behaviours generates an awareness of the material possibilities that enables architects to engage with engineers and materials scientists. In considering both theoretical and practical implications, my research contributes to the discussion of multifunctional materials as they emerge and their applications within architecture...|$|R
40|$|During {{root canal}} or {{periodontal}} treatment, directing laser energy onto {{the walls of}} the root canal is essential for effective disinfection. This study assessed the performance of four different fiber modifications that have increased lateral emission, including three designs with safe tips to reduce irradiation directed toward the root apex. Free-running pulsed infrared lasers (Nd:YAG, Er:YAG, and Er, Cr:YSGG) and a diode laser (980 nm) were used in combination with plain ended (forward emitting) laser fibers; conical laser fibers, side firing honeycomb pattern fibers without a safe end; honeycomb fibers with silver coated ends, conical fibers with selectively abraded tips, and selectively abraded honeycomb fibers with silver coated tips (20 fibers for each laser type). Laser emissions forward and laterally were measured, and digital photographs and thermally sensitive paper used to record the emission profiles. <b>Thermochromic</b> dyes <b>painted</b> onto the root surface of an extracted tooth were used to explore the distribution of laser energy with different tips designs. All three safe tipped ends gave reduced emissions in the forward direction (range 17 - 59 %), but had similar lateral emission characteristics. Fiber designs with reduced forward emission may be useful for various dental laser procedures. (C) 2011 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE). [DOI: 10. 1117 / 1. 3563637...|$|R
