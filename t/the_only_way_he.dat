5|$|At {{the same}} time, Quisling {{believed}} that <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> could win back Hitler's respect {{would be to}} raise volunteers for the now-faltering German war effort, and he committed Norway wholeheartedly to German plans to wage total war. For him at least, after the German defeat at Stalingrad in February 1943, Norway now had a part to play in keeping the German empire strong. In April 1943, Quisling delivered a scathing speech attacking Germany's refusal to outline its plans for post-war Europe. When he put this to Hitler in person, the Nazi leader remained unmoved despite Norway's contributions to the war effort. Quisling felt betrayed over this postponement of Norwegian freedom, an attitude that waned only when Hitler eventually committed to a free post-war Norway in September 1943.|$|E
5|$|After enjoying life as {{a billionaire}} for a few days, Homer decides to throw a party before Burns returns. He heads to Moe's Tavern to buy some beer and invite his friends to the party. However, Moe informs Homer {{that he can not}} sell him alcohol on account of it being Sunday before 2:00 PM. After Homer is told <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> could buy alcohol would be to sail out to {{international}} waters where there are no laws, he and his friends (including his son Bart) set sail in Burns' private yacht to throw the party there. Back at the Mayo Clinic, Burns discovers that he not only has all previously discovered diseases, but numerous new diseases the doctors have just discovered in him. However, the sheer number of diseases prevents any one disease from actually doing harm to him. This leads Burns to (incorrectly) conclude that he is indestructible, even though the doctors protest that even a slight breeze could disrupt the balance in his body.|$|E

50|$|Legion is an Omega-level mutant who has {{multiple}} personalities. The first personality to manifest, Jemail, was {{the mind of}} a terrorist that David absorbed into himself. According to Karma, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>ways</b> <b>he</b> can absorb other people into his mind is if he is right next to them when they die or through telepathy. Two others, Jack Wayne and Cyndi, have made themselves known, but it is unknown how many other personalities may exist. The manifestation of Legion's individual powers are each associated with a different personality, and each personality controls a different power. The cumulative powers of all his personalities make him one of the strongest mutants in existence.|$|R

25|$|My dad was not {{the monster}} my lying brother said he was; he was strict, but my father never beat us black and blue, and my brother Gary was a vicious, no-good liar for saying so. I have nothing but fond {{memories}} of Dad, going to studios with him, family vacations at our cabin in Idaho, boating and fishing with him. To my dying day, I'll hate Gary for dragging Dad's name through the mud. He wrote Going My Own Way out of greed. He wanted to make money and knew that humiliating our father and blackening his name was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> could do it. He knew it would generate a lot of publicity. That was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> could get his ugly, no-talent face {{on television and in}} the newspapers. My dad was my hero. I loved him very much. He loved all of us too, including Gary. He was a great father.|$|E

One night, the younger brother is late in returning home, and the hero discovers the boy out in the hills, having been abducted by bug-eyed monsters from space. The BEMs use a brain enhancing helmet to make the boy smarter and turning him into their spy, but all the boy can do is retell his older brother's stories. The hero returns home and starts crafting his tales so that they'll scare the BEMs off the planet.|$|R

25|$|Berlusconi {{remained}} as caretaker prime minister {{for a little}} over a month, until his replacement by a technocratic government headed by Lamberto Dini. Dini had been a key minister in the Berlusconi cabinet, and Berlusconi said <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> would support a technocratic government would be if Dini headed it. In the end, however, Dini was supported by most of the opposition parties, but not by Forza Italia and Lega Nord. In 1996, Berlusconi and his coalition lost the elections and were replaced by a centre-left government led by Romano Prodi.|$|E

But the prince turns her away solely for her appearance. The old woman warns him not to be fooled by appearances, as true beauty lies within, only to be rejected again. She then transforms into a beautiful enchantress and turns the prince into a hideous Beast and his servants into various household objects. She gives him the rose to use as an hour-glass. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> can break the spell is to learn to love another and earn her love in return {{by the time the}} last petal falls ("Prologue").|$|E
25|$|Lindros was {{selected}} first overall by the Quebec Nordiques in the 1991 NHL Entry Draft. Lindros had signaled {{in advance that}} he would never play for the Nordiques, citing the city's isolation, lack of marketing potential, and French character. Despite this, the team selected him anyway. Nordiques owner Marcel Aubut publicly announced that they would make Lindros the centrepiece of their franchise turnaround, and refused to trade Lindros, saying that <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> would play in the NHL would be in a Nordiques uniform. While he awaited a trade, Lindros spent the time playing with the Generals and also participated in the 1992 Winter Olympics, winning a silver medal with Canada.|$|E

25|$|Richards {{maintained}} cordial relations {{after breaking}} up with Italian-born actress Anita Pallenberg (d. June 13, 2017), {{the mother of his}} first three children. Richards and Pallenberg, who never married, were a couple from 1967 to 1979. Together they have a son, Marlon Leon Sundeep (named after the actor Marlon Brando), born in 1969, and a daughter, Angela (originally named Dandelion), born in 1972. Their third child, a son named Tara Jo Jo Gunne (after Richards' and Pallenberg's friend Guinness heir Tara Browne), died on 6 June 1976 at just over two months old of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Richards was away on tour at the time, something he said has haunted him since. He was criticised at the time for performing that night after learning of the death, but he later said it was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> could cope.|$|E
25|$|Another {{specific}} {{source for the}} final scene is discernible when Titus asks Saturninus if a father should kill his daughter when she has been raped. This is {{a reference to the}} story of Verginia from Livy's Ab urbe condita (c.26 B.C.). Around 451 B.C., a decemvir of the Roman Republic, Appius Claudius Crassus, begins to lust after Verginia, a plebeian girl betrothed to a former tribune, Lucius Icilius. She rejects Claudius' advances, enraging him, and he has her abducted. However, both Icilius and Verginia's father, famed centurion Lucius Verginius, are respected figures and Claudius is forced to legally defend his right to hold Verginia. At the Forum, Claudius threatens the assembly with violence, and Verginius' supporters flee. Seeing that defeat is imminent, Verginius asks Claudius if he may speak to his daughter alone, to which Claudius agrees. However, Verginius stabs Verginia, determining that her death is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> can secure her freedom.|$|E

500|$|A {{key issue}} was whether Bamber {{received}} a call from his father that night to say Sheila had [...] "gone berserk" [...] with a gun. Bamber said that he did, that he alerted police, and that Sheila fired the final shot while he and the officers were standing outside the house. It became a central plank of the prosecution's case that the father had made no such call, and that the only reason Bamber would have lied about it—indeed, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> could have known about the shootings when he alerted the police—was that he was the killer himself.|$|E
500|$|While free on bail, Vicious smashed a {{beer mug}} {{in the face}} of Todd Smith, Patti Smith's brother, and was arrested again on an assault charge. On 9 December 1978 he was sent to Rikers Island jail, where he spent 55 days and {{underwent}} enforced cold-turkey detox. He was released on 1 February 1979; sometime after midnight, following a small party to celebrate his release, Vicious died of a heroin overdose, aged 21. Reflecting on the event, Lydon said, [...] "Poor Sid. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> could live up to what he wanted everyone to believe about him was to die.

5000|$|Simon West {{said the}} three fights were [...] "character driven".each {{one of the}} action moments is character-driven, so you're right, it builds up. So when it does explode, it's {{exploding}} for the right reason. The first one, he's getting back into his old skills - precision fighting. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>he's</b> {{going to get out}} alive is by relying on his old skills. And he's a master of that. The second fight explodes out of anger, and it's really anger at himself for going back to being a gambling addict. They're character-driven fights. Whereas traditionally in action films, they're light relief - they're almost commercial breaks in the story. These ones come out of the situation his character's in, not just that he's in jeopardy and has to fight his way out of it - they're emotional fights.|$|R

500|$|Nevertheless, by {{the time}} of his appointment, Rimsky-Korsakov had become painfully aware of his {{technical}} shortcomings as a composer; he later wrote, [...] "I was a dilettante and knew nothing". Moreover, he had come to a creative dead-end upon completing his opera The Maid of Pskov and realized that developing a solid musical technique was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> could continue composing. He turned to Tchaikovsky for advice and guidance. When Rimsky-Korsakov underwent a change in attitude on music education and began his own intensive studies privately, his fellow nationalists accused him of throwing away his Russian heritage to compose fugues and sonatas. Tchaikovsky continued to support him morally. He told Rimsky-Korsakov that he fully applauded what he was doing and admired both his artistic modesty and his strength of character.|$|E
