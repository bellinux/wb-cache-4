The three persons who disagreed felt that the anthem should be in English because that was the language most commonly used in Singapore. All the interviewees, including those who did not know <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> the lyrics, said they felt a sense of pride when they heard or sang the national anthem.|$|E

5|$|From {{an early}} age, infants use {{language}} to communicate. Caregivers {{and other family}} members use language to teach children how to act in society.

5|$|Philosopher John Searle {{argues that}} Watson—despite {{impressive}} capabilities—cannot actually think.

5|$|Philosopher Paul Tillich {{argued that}} {{religious}} faith is best expressed through symbolism because a symbol {{points to a}} meaning beyond itself and best expresses transcendent religious beliefs. He believed that any statement about God is symbolic and participates in <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> a concept. Tillich used {{the example of a}} national flag to illustrate his point: a flag points to something beyond itself, the country it represents, but also participates in <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> the country. He believed that symbols could unite a religious believer with a deeper dimension of himself as well as with a greater reality. Tillich believed that symbols must emerge from an individual collective unconsciousness, and can only function when they are accepted by the unconscious. He believed that symbols cannot be invented, but live and die at the appropriate times.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} {{two patients}} who manifested opposite patterns of performance on test batteries that evaluated production, comprehension, and semantic analysis of action verbs {{on the one}} hand (e. g. smile, wave, run) and locative prepositions on the other (e. g. in, on, over). JP failed all of the verb tests but passed all of the preposition tests, suggesting impaired knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>meanings</b> <b>of</b> action verbs but intact knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>meanings</b> <b>of</b> locative prepositions. In contrast, RR exhibited the reverse dissociation: he passed many of the verb tests but failed all of the preposition tests, suggesting mostly intact knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>meanings</b> <b>of</b> action verbs but impaired knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>meanings</b> <b>of</b> locative prepositions. This behavioral double dissociation reflects the fact that the two categories of words differ along several conceptual parameters. To a large extent, the patients exhibited a neuroanatomical double dissociation as well, since JP’s lesion is predominantly in the left frontal operculum whereas RR’s is predominantly in the left inferior parietal lobe and the posterior superior temporal region. This constitutes preliminary evidence that <b>the</b> <b>meanings</b> <b>of</b> action verbs and locative prepositions are represented by partially independent neural networks in the brain...|$|R
