As {{a principle of}} caring for diabetes, recommending patients to lose weight through more physical activities and a restrictive diet has a long history. The present study was carried out aiming at determining and comparing dietary style and physical activity in women with gestational diabetes and healthy pregnant women. This descriptive-comparative study was carried out simultaneously on 200 pregnant women (with gestational diabetes and healthy). Tools for data collection were questionnaires of dietary style and physical activity during pregnancy. After obtaining research informed consent from samples, sampling was done by multi-stage convenience random sampling. Data was analyzed using SPSS 21. The {{results of the study}} revealed that the demographic and obstetric variables were identical. <b>The</b> <b>mean</b> <b>scores</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> dietary style of case and control groups were 65. 05 and 74. 12, P < 0. 001 respectively. <b>The</b> <b>mean</b> <b>scores</b> <b>for</b> physical activity (inactive cases) in the two groups were 5. 64 and 4. 70, P < 0. 223, <b>the</b> <b>mean</b> <b>scores</b> <b>for</b> light activity in the two groups were 9. 07 and 10. 75 (P < 0. 059), and <b>the</b> <b>mean</b> <b>scores</b> <b>for</b> moderate activity in the two groups were 4. 62 and 5. 69, (P < 0. 042) respectively.

40|$|Graduation date: 1984 The {{primary purpose}} of the present study was to {{investigate}} the effect of peer presence upon the health-related physical fitness test scores of college students. A total of 312 undergraduate college students, 156 males and 156 females, 18 through 29 years of age, randomly selected from the physical education activity lists at Oregon State University were used in this study. The subjects were divided equally into three groups and randomly assigned to one of the following methods of testing: method A coacting; method B, audience; and method C, individual. In the coacting group, four subjects of the same sex were tested at the same time. In the audience group, subjects were tested individually in the presence of four peers, 2 males and 2 females. Subjects in the third group, method C, were tested alone without the presence of an audience or co-actors. The dependent variables were three test items from American Alliance for Health Physical Education Recreation and Dance, Health-Related Physical Fitness Test (1980). The test items included were: 1) the twelve-minute-run-and-walk test, as a measure of cardiovascular endurance, 2) sit-up test for 60 seconds, as a measure of muscular strength and muscular endurance, and 3) sit and reach test, as a measure of flexibility. A two by three analysis of variance fixed model was used as the statistical tool to test the null hypotheses. An alpha level of. 05 was established. The results of this study indicated that there was a significant difference between the male and female health-related physical fitness test <b>scores</b> <b>for</b> college students. Male <b>mean</b> <b>scores</b> were greater than <b>the</b> female <b>mean</b> <b>scores</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> twelve-minute-run-and-walk test and the sit-up test; however, female <b>mean</b> <b>scores</b> were greater than <b>the</b> male <b>mean</b> <b>scores</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> sit and reach test.

A total of 545 young children (age 7 to 36 months) with prelingual, severe to profound hearing loss participated in this study. All children received cochlear implantation.

The Infant-Toddler Meaningful Auditory Integration Scale (IT-MAIS) was used to assess the children's auditory skills that include vocalization changes, spontaneous alerting to sounds in everyday living environments, and the ability to derive meaning from sounds. The assessment was performed prior to surgery and at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, and 36 months after implant device switch-on. <b>The</b> <b>mean</b> <b>scores</b> <b>for</b> overall auditory skills were not significantly different between groups A and B at pre-surgery, 1, 12, 24, and 36 months post-surgery, but were significantly different at 3, 6, and 9 months post-surgery. <b>The</b> <b>mean</b> <b>scores</b> <b>for</b> all auditory skills in children with Mondini dysplasia showed significant improvement over time. <b>The</b> <b>mean</b> <b>scores</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> three subcategories of auditory skills in children with Mondini dysplasia also showed significant differences at pre-surgery, 1, 3, 6, and 9 months, however, there were no significant differences at 12, 24, and 36 months.
