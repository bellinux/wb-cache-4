5|$|Six B.2s {{converted}} for air-to-air refuelling with Mark 17 Hose Drum Unit (HDU) mounted semi-recessed in <b>tail</b> <b>cone.</b> TFR deleted. Fitted {{with three}} bomb-bay drum tanks, {{it was the}} only mark of Vulcan that could jettison fuel in an emergency.|$|E
5|$|The B.1 {{had four}} {{elevators}} (inboard) and four ailerons (outboard). In the B.2, these {{were replaced by}} eight elevons. The Vulcan was also fitted with six electrically operated three-position (in, medium drag, high drag) airbrakes, four in the upper centre section and two in the lower. There were originally four lower airbrakes but the outboard two were deleted before the aircraft entered service. A brake parachute was installed inside the <b>tail</b> <b>cone.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{airframe}} {{incorporates the}} use of composite materials, which comprise nine percent of its original structural weight (all models outside the 777-8 and 777-9). Elements made from composite material include the cabin floor and rudder. The main fuselage cross-section is circular and tapers rearward into a blade-shaped <b>tail</b> <b>cone</b> with a port-facing auxiliary power unit. The aircraft also features the largest landing gear and the biggest tires ever used in a commercial jetliner. The six-wheel bogies are designed to spread the load of the aircraft over a wide area without requiring an additional centerline gear. This helps reduce weight and simplifies the aircraft's braking and hydraulic systems. Each tire of a 777-300ER six-wheel main landing gear can carry a load of , which is heavier than other wide-bodies such as the 747-400. The aircraft has triple redundant hydraulic systems with only one system required for landing. A ram air turbine –a small retractable propeller which can provide emergency power– is also fitted in the wing root fairing.|$|E
25|$|The {{bombs were}} painted sky-blue {{with a yellow}} stripe in the <b>tail</b> <b>cone,</b> unless filled with Trialen in which case it was {{replaced}} by the silhouette of a sinking ship in yellow, and the warning nur gegen handelschiffe ("only against merchant ships") was stencilled on the bomb casing.|$|E
25|$|The Macchi M.C.200, a {{single-seater}} monoplane fighter aircraft {{equipped with}} a radial engine, was Regia Aeronauticas most important fighter between 1940 and 1943. On display at the Gianni Caproni Museum of Aeronautics are the front part of the fuselage, the <b>tail</b> <b>cone</b> and empennage, and the Fiat A.74 RC.38 engine of a M.C.200.

5000|$|Aerodynamic improvements: From mid-1987, new MD-87-style {{low-drag}} [...] "beaver" [...] <b>tail</b> <b>cones</b> {{were introduced}} on all series of MD-80s, reducing drag and improving fuel burn. Some operators have been modifying the old DC-9-style cones on earlier-build MD-80s {{to the new}} low-drag style. Scandinavian Airlines System has done this, citing the improved economics and cosmetics from the modification.|$|R
50|$|The slender {{fuselage}} is assembled {{from two}} formed, foam-bonded ply shells, each with inbuilt longerons. Nose and <b>tail</b> <b>cones</b> are of laminated plastic. The pilot {{sits in a}} semi-reclining position, under a long, starboard hinged, canopy which ends at the wing leading edge. The prototypes had longer noses than later aircraft. The Edelweiss lands on a fixed, sprung, monowheel undercarriage, fitted with a wheel brake operated jointly with the airbrakes.|$|R
25|$|The {{aircraft}} hit {{the water}} with the tail first. The impact caused the fuselage to break into three main parts. The largest was the 26-meter (85ft) forward section of the aircraft, from the nose to {{the trailing edge of}} the wings. It remained afloat after the accident for about twenty hours. The midsection was 13meters (42ft) long, from the trailing edge of the wing to the rear pressure bulkhead. The aft section consisted of the <b>tail</b> <b>cone,</b> including all of the horizontal stabilizers and the vertical stabilizers. The engines and landing gear separated from the aircraft at the time of impact.|$|E
25|$|In 2014, an {{improved}} {{version of the}} aircraft, marketed as the TBM 900 was introduced, featuring 26 individual modifications, including the adoption of in-house-designed winglets, a redesigned air intake and the fitting of a five-blade Hartzell-built propeller, orientated around delivering improved aerodynamics and performance. The adoption of a sharp strake, located forward and beneath {{the leading edge of}} the left wing, also provides for improved stall characteristics over the earlier TBM variants. According to aircraft publication Aviation Week, various subtle exterior changes were made for drag reduction purposes, including the addition of inner main landing gear doors, the re-contouring of the <b>tail</b> <b>cone</b> and of the engine nacelle.|$|E
25|$|Pilot and {{observer}} sat {{in tandem}} under a sliding canopy, while the rear fuselage held a cargo bay with a hinged <b>tail</b> <b>cone</b> {{capable of carrying}} 2,000lb (910kg) of cargo, which could include a complete PT-6 engine, or five paratroopers, in extremely cramped conditions, with a sixth paratrooper in the observer's seat. Four 7.62mm machine guns were mounted in pods {{on the side of}} the fuselage, while 2,000lb (910kg) of external stores, including bombs, rockets and gun pods, could be carried on hardpoints under the wings and fuselage. To meet the specification's requirements for amphibious operations, it could be fitted with two large floats.|$|E
25|$|At {{least one}} Japanese fighter {{was shot down}} by the gunners of the Whirling Dervish, piloted by 1st Lt. Harold Watson. Two other fighters were shot down by the gunners of the Hari Kari-er, piloted by 1st Lt. Ross Greening. Many {{military}} targets were strafed by the bombers' nose gunners. The subterfuge of the simulated gun barrels mounted in the <b>tail</b> <b>cones</b> was described afterwards by Doolittle as effective, in that no airplane was attacked from directly behind.|$|R
50|$|Argentinian Lincolns {{were also}} used to conduct supply airdrops in support of Argentine {{operations}} in the Antarctic region. In 1948, one of the bombers was returned to Avro for modification at RAF Langar {{in order to allow}} it to operate these Antarctic support flights; the changes included the addition of Lancastrian nose and <b>tail</b> <b>cones,</b> additional fuel tanks, and removal of armament; this led to the aircraft becoming the first Avro Lincolnian. Modified as such, the aircraft received a civilian registration and was named Cruz del Sur; it undertook its first aerial supply flight to the Antarctic San Martín Base in December 1951.|$|R
40|$|Cost benefit {{studies were}} {{conducted}} on six advanced materials and processes technologies applicable to commercial engines planned for production in the 1985 to 1990 time frame. These technologies consisted of thermal barrier coatings for combustor and high pressure turbine airfoils, directionally solidified eutectic high pressure turbine blades, (both cast and fabricated), and mixers, <b>tail</b> <b>cones,</b> and piping made of titanium-aluminum alloys. A fabricated titanium fan blisk, an advanced turbine disk alloy with improved low cycle fatigue life, and a long-life high pressure turbine blade abrasive tip and ceramic shroud system were also analyzed. Technologies showing considerable promise as to benefits, low development costs, and high probability of success were thermal barrier coating, directionally solidified eutectic turbine blades, and abrasive-tip blades/ceramic-shroud turbine systems...|$|R
25|$|Bombardier's Board of Directors {{authorized}} {{marketing the}} aircraft on 15 March 2005, seeking firm commitments from potential customers, suppliers and government partners prior to program launch. The C110 was planned to weigh 133,200lb (60,420kg) at MTOW {{and have a}} length of 114.7ft (35 m), while the C130 should be 125.3ft (38.2 m) long and have a 146,000lb (66,226kg) MTOW. It would have 3-by-2 standard seating and 4-abreast business class, 7ft (2.1 m) stand-up headroom, fly-by-wire and side stick controls. 20 percent of the aircraft weight would be in composite materials for the center and rear fuselages, <b>tail</b> <b>cone,</b> empennage and wings. First flight was planned for 2008 and entry into service in 2010.|$|E
25|$|During 1980, the Brazilian {{government}} {{announced that they}} intended {{to participate in the}} program as a replacement for the Aermacchi MB-326. In July 1981, the Italian and Brazilian governments agreed on joint requirements for the aircraft, and Embraer was invited to join the industrial partnership. An agreement was also struck to divide AMX manufacturing between the partners; for each production aircraft, Aeritalia manufactured 46.5% of the components (central fuselage, stabilisers and rudders), Aermacchi produced 22.8% (front fuselage and <b>tail</b> <b>cone),</b> and Embraer performed 29.7% of the work (wing, air intakes, pylons and drop tanks). There was no duplication of work, each component of the aircraft was built at one source only. The planned requirements were 187 aircraft for Italy and 100 for Brazil.|$|E
25|$|The Reggiane Re.2005, a single-seat, {{single engine}} {{monoplane}} fighter, {{was one of}} the most modern Italian fighters built during World War II. It made its maiden flight in May 1942, but the Armistice prevented the type from being produced in susbstantial numbers. The Gianni Caproni Museum of Aeronautics displays the only known survivor's fuselage, <b>tail</b> <b>cone</b> and vertical stabilizer. Built in the first half of 1943, this aircraft belonged to the 22º Gruppo Autonomo Caccia Terrestre and operated until September 1943. It was found after the war near its air base in Capodichino, not far from Naples. Subsequently, the city's university took possession of the aircraft for several years. The aircraft was purchased by the Caproni Museum in the 1970s and it became a part of the permanent exhibition in 2010.|$|E
5000|$|In England, the 422d NFS finally {{received}} their first P-61s in late June, and began flying operational missions over England in mid-July. These aircraft arrived without the dorsal turrets so the squadron's gunners were reassigned to another NFS {{that was to}} continue flying the P-70. The first P-61 engagement in the European Theater occurred on July 15 when a P-61 piloted by Lt. Herman Ernst was directed to intercept a V-1 [...] "Buzz Bomb." [...] Diving from above and behind to match the V-1's 350 mph speed, the P-61's plastic rear cone imploded under the pressure and the attack was aborted. The <b>tail</b> <b>cones</b> failed on several early P-61A models before this problem was corrected. On 16 July, Lt. Ernst was again directed to attack a V-1 and, this time, was successful, giving the 422nd NFS and the European Theater its first P-61 kill.|$|R
50|$|The {{fuselage}} for the Abhyas {{was designed}} by adopting the DRDO Lakshya tow body (not the main fuselage).The fuselage consists of five sections, namely the nose cone, equipment bay, fuel tank bay, air intake bay and tail cone.The material for the nose and <b>tail</b> <b>cones</b> {{are made up of}} composite material (GFRP), whereas the material of the equipment bay, air intake bay and fuel tank are made up of an aluminum steel alloy.The wings and tail plane of the Abhyas have been derived from the Lakshya by downsizing them, however the wings of the Abhyas are positioned on the upper-side of the body whereas the Lakshya has under-body wings.For propulsion it is fitted with a gas-turbine engine, having a thrust of 25 kg, with an endurance of 30-45 minutes.Abhyas is GPS-enabled, has an on-board flight control computer and a miss-distance indicator. It is also designed for autonomous flight {{with the help of an}} autopilot.|$|R
50|$|The {{projectile}} is {{manufactured in}} two parts: the propellant charge is assembled in a cylindrical tube, containing a solid fuel {{which is most}} likely common black powder, {{and the head of}} the projectile is essentially a body tube, <b>tail,</b> and nose <b>cone</b> made of pressed sheet metal.|$|R
25|$|Directly {{behind the}} cockpit and {{underneath}} the main rotor was the rotorcraft's engine and its nylon bag-type fuel tank, which was housed within a welded tubular steel framework attached to the cockpit structure and to the tailboom. Power was directed to the tail rotor via a torque shaft contained within the <b>tail</b> <b>cone,</b> which featured gearing so that pilots could readily adjust the speed and direction of tail rotor movement. The engine was provided with cooling air via an intake on {{the centre of the}} starboard side of the rotorcraft; for improved ventilation, the cowling around the engine area could be entirely removed. The de Havilland Gipsy Major that was used to power the majority of Skeeters was credited with being a major contributor to the rotorcraft's relatively high fuel efficiency due to its use of fuel injectors (the high aerodynamic efficiency of the airframe itself was another beneficial factor).|$|E
25|$|The 328 is {{furnished}} {{with the same}} supercritical wing design that had been originally developed from Dornier's earlier Do 228, this wing provides the aircraft with both excellent cruise and climb capabilities. The straightforward construction techniques of the Do 228 were also reproduced for the 328, despite making increased use of composite materials {{in areas such as}} the rear fuselage and empennage. The 328 reportedly made greater use of composites than any of its direct competitors at launch, the use of the Kevlar-carbon fiber composites is claimed to have reduced its weight by 20 per cent. Various materials are used across the airframe; amongst these, an aluminium alloy is used for the pressure fuselage and much of the wingbox, a titanium alloy for the <b>tail</b> <b>cone,</b> and glass fibre reinforced plastic for the radome and leading edge of the vertical stabilizer. Noise-absorbent material is located across the fuselage, while the cabin wall is hung from isolator brackets to reduce vibration and noise transference.|$|E
25|$|PIA {{launched}} its new livery in early April 2010. An Airbus A310, Boeing 777–200 and Boeing 747–300 {{were the first}} aircraft to wear the new look. The livery was unveiled at the PIA headquarters on a Boeing 777 model. The livery consisted of a green and gold strip running around {{the bottom of the}} fuselage and continuing right up until the <b>tail</b> <b>cone.</b> The forward/upper portion was white and at the rear, it was an off white/beige color. The bottom part of the tail blended into the upper fuselage as it too is white, {{with the rest of the}} tail painted with a large wavy Pakistan flag, which takes up the whole tail, in a dark green color. At the front of the fuselage 'PIA' was written in a billboard style in dark green and underneath 'Pakistan' was written in golden color. Just behind the cockpit there is a stylized Urdu PIA logo as well as on the engines.|$|E
40|$|This work {{investigates the}} {{technique}} of mass fabrication of nanowires on semiconductor InP (100) surfaces by low energy Ar+ ion beam bombardment. Systematic investigation shows that under some crucial experimental parameters, nanowire arrays of regular periodicity can be produced. An ambient Atomic Force Microscope was used in contact mode to examine the morphology of the irradiated InP surfaces. The chemical composition of the irradiated samples was characterized by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). The electronic structure of the fabricated nanowire arrays was jointly explored by Scanning Tunnelling Spectroscopy and XPS. The research shows that In enriched ripples and nanowires form under prolonged irradiation by Ar+ ions due to preferential sputtering of P from InP under grazing ion incident angle above some crucial irradiation ion dose. A model of mergence from <b>tailed</b> <b>cones</b> is proposed {{to account for the}} formation of these ripples and nanowires. The drive to the formation of periodic ripples and nanowires is believed to be stress-field induced self-organisation of strained cones. The cone-mergence model is a combination of the model of stress-field induced self-organization and the model of ripple topography by Bradley and Harper (BH). The research proposes that the mobility of atoms on the corresponding solid surfaces under ion bombardment decides whether the surface morphology is generated by the stress-field, the BH, or {{a combination of the two}} models. Monte-Carlo simulation was used to evaluate the effect of surface damage and preferential sputtering of P from InP and N from Si 3 N 4. The calculations predict that P and N can be preferentially sputtered from InP and Si 3 N 4 surfaces.

[...] The Bel Air Sport Sedan continued to use a rear window overhang and a huge wraparound rear window. Bel Airs (and Biscaynes) had two tail lights per side; the Impalas had three tail lights per side—a situation that would persist for most years through 1975. Many of the same options and accessories that were available on the Impala were also available on the Bel Air. The Bel Airs had more interior and exterior brightwork than the Biscayne.|$|R
25|$|The F28 {{was similar}} in design to the British Aircraft Corporation BAC One-Eleven and Douglas DC-9, {{as it had}} a T-tail and engines mounted {{at the rear of}} the fuselage. The {{aircraft}} had wings with a slight crescent angle of sweep with ailerons at the tip, simple flaps, and five-section liftdumper only operated after landing to dump the lift. These were employed rather than reverse thrust as the designers felt that doing so not only reduced weight, but maintenance also. Having no reversers also meant that on unpaved airstrips there was less chance of the engines ingesting debris. The leading edge was fixed (although one experimental model had leading edge slats and these were offered as an option) and was anti-iced by bleed air from the engines. The <b>tail</b> <b>cone</b> could split and be hydraulically opened to the sides to act as a variable air brake – also used on the contemporaneous Blackburn Buccaneer. This design was also used on the HS-146, which became the BAe-146. The design is unique in that it not only slows the aircraft down rapidly, it can aid in rapid descents from economic cruising altitudes and also allowed the engines to be set at higher RPM which helped eliminate 'lag time'. This means the engines respond faster if needed for sudden speed increases or go-arounds on the approach to landing. The Fellowship had a retractable tricycle landing gear which used large low pressure tyres enabling the use of unpaved airstrips. Large wheel brakes also helped in shortening the landing run.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} ECM fit as {{fitted to}} the B.1A and B.2 was: one Green Palm voice communications' jammer; two Blue Diver metric jammers; three Red Shrimp S-band jammers; a Blue Saga passive warning receiver with four aerials (PWR); [...] a Red Steer tail warning radar; and window (chaff) dispensers. The {{bulk of the}} equipment was carried in a large extended <b>tail</b> <b>cone,</b> and a flat ECM aerial counterpoise plate mounted between the starboard tailpipes. Later equipment on the B.2 included: an L band jammer (replacing a Red Shrimp); the ARI 18146 X-band jammer; replacing the Green Palm; the improved Red Steer Mk.2; infra-red decoys (flares); and the ARI 18228 PWR with its aerials that gave a squared top to the fin.|$|E
500|$|The Boeing 777 is {{a family}} of {{long-range}} wide-body twin-engine jet airliners developed and manufactured by Boeing Commercial Airplanes.

40|$|In {{modeling}} the joint upper {{tail of a}} multivariate distribution, a fundamental deficiency of classical extreme value theory is the inability to distinguish between asymptotic independence and exact inde-pendence. In this work, we examine multivariate threshold modeling based on the framework of regular variation on <b>cones.</b> <b>Tail</b> dependence is described by an angular measure, which in some cases is de-generate on joint tail regions despite strong sub-asymptotic dependence in such regions. The canonical example is a bivariate Gaussian distribution with any correlation less than one. Hidden regular variation (Resnick, 2002), a second-order tail decay on these regions, offers a refinement of the classical theory. Previous characterizations of random vectors with hidden regular variation are not well-suited for joint tail estimation in finite samples, and estimation approaches thus far {{have been unable to}} model both the heavier-tailed regular variation and the hidden regular variation simultaneously. We propose to represent a random vector with hidden regular variation as the sum of independent first- and second-order regular varying pieces. We show our model is asymptotically valid via the concept of multivariate tail equivalence, and illustrate simulation methods with the bivariate Gaussian example. Finally, we outline a framework for estimation from our model via the EM algorithm. ...|$|R
50|$|This species breeds in colonies, usually of 3 to 30 pairs but {{occasionally}} up to 400. Colonies may be near those of southern rockhopper penguins. There {{is a period}} of nest-building and displaying in late March and early April—an unusual time for a subantarctic cormorant. Advertising males display by throwing the head back till the nape touches the <b>tail.</b> Nests are <b>cones</b> of seaweed, twigs, and grass held together with mud and guano, up to 1 meter tall and 33 cm across, with a cup averaging 20 cm across and 8 cm deep. Nests that survive may be reused, perhaps not by the same pair. Breeding activity starts as early as September, but laying usually starts at some point from late October to late November and lasts till mid January; the times vary considerably among colonies. The clutch comprises two to four eggs, about 6.2 cm long and 3.9 cm wide. The second egg is laid 2 or 3 days after the first. Both parents incubate for an average of 29 days. Both protect the chicks from predation by skuas, gulls, and sheathbills, which nevertheless take some chicks. Chicks hatch black with a pink throat and develop blackish-brown down with greyish-white tufts. Other aspects of reproductive behavior and success are unknown.|$|R
500|$|The 46th {{production}} aircraft and first B.2, XH533, first flew in September 1958 fitted with Olympus 200 engines with [...] thrust, {{six months before}} the last B.1 XH532 was delivered in March 1959. Rebuilding B.1s as B.2s was considered but rejected over cost. Nevertheless, to extend the B.1's service life, 28 were upgraded by Armstrong Whitworth between 1959 and 1963 to the B.1A standard, including features of the B.2 such as ECM equipment, in-flight refuelling receiving equipment, and UHF radio. The second B.2, XH534, flew in January 1959. Powered by production Olympus 201 with [...] thrust, it was more representative of a {{production aircraft}}, being fitted with an in-flight refuelling probe and a bulged ECM <b>tail</b> <b>cone.</b> Some subsequent B.2s were initially lacking probes and ECM tail cones, but these were fitted retrospectively. The first 10 B.2s outwardly showed their B.1 ancestry, retaining narrow engine air intakes. Anticipating even more powerful engines, the air intakes were deepened on the 11th (XH557) and subsequent aircraft. Many of the early aircraft were retained for trials and it was the 12th B.2, XH558, that was the first to be delivered to the RAF in July 1960. Coincidentally, XH558 would also be the last Vulcan in service with the RAF, before being retired in 1992.|$|E
