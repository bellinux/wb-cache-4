5|$|Subdivision rules give a {{sequence}} of tilings of a surface, and tilings give an idea of distance, length, and area (by letting each tile have length and area 1). In the limit, the distances <b>that</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> these tilings may converge in some sense to an analytic structure on the surface. The Combinatorial Riemann Mapping Theorem gives necessary and sufficient conditions for this to occur.|$|E
5|$|Currently 1,500,000 (2% of all U.S children) are adopted. There are {{different}} types of adoption; embryo adoption when a couple is having trouble conceiving a child and instead choose to have their sperm and egg conjoined outside the womb, international adoption where couples adopt children <b>that</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> foreign countries, and private adoption {{which is the most}} common form of adoption. In private adoption, families can adopt children via licensed agencies or with by directly contacting the child's biological parents.|$|E

5|$|Sustainable use of {{materials}} has targeted {{the idea of}} dematerialization, converting the linear path {{of materials}} (extraction, use, disposal in landfill) to a circular material flow that reuses materials as much as possible, much like the cycling and reuse of waste in nature. This approach is supported by product stewardship and {{the increasing use of}} material flow analysis at all levels, especially individual countries and the global economy. The use of sustainable biomaterials <b>that</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> renewable sources and that can be recycled is preferred to the use on non-renewables from a life cycle standpoint.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} of some lava flows in the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field is unusual because they include small, angular to rounded fragments of rock called nodules and crystals <b>that</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> the mantle. These green nodules {{are known as}} peridotites because they are mostly made of a magnesium iron silicate mineral called olivine. These lava flows also comprise large crystals of olivine, plagioclase, and pyroxene that crystallized deep within the Earth's crust and mantle. The lavas and nodules they contain {{are similar to those}} erupted at Volcano Mountain in the Yukon. The nodules help volcanologists and other geoscientists to verify what the mantle beneath the volcanic field is like.|$|E
5|$|Physical {{investment}} {{seems to}} have increased by 5% in the eurozone due to the introduction. Regarding foreign direct investment, a {{study found that the}} intra-eurozone FDI stocks have increased by about 20% during the first four years of the EMU. Concerning the effect on corporate investment, there is evidence that the introduction of the euro has resulted in an increase in investment rates and that it has made it easier for firms to access financing in Europe. The euro has most specifically stimulated investment in companies <b>that</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> countries that previously had weak currencies. A study found that the introduction of the euro accounts for 22% of the investment rate after 1998 in countries that previously had a weak currency.|$|E

5|$|While {{the entire}} script {{was still in}} the draft phase, Maeda revised lines that felt unnatural after asking others for their {{opinions}} on it, including Na-Ga. When writing the script, Maeda made a conscious effort to write Charlotte in the framework of an anime series, as opposed to when he wrote the script for Angel Beats!, which he admits he wrote more akin to the framework of a video game. In this way, Toba felt that Charlotte was Maeda's effort to write a story in its purest form that could not be made into a video game, unlike Angel Beats!. Toba also noted that the characters in Charlotte are not written for a video game scenario, especially the protagonist, and went on to echo Horikawa's sentiment that Charlotte is akin to an I novel for Maeda. Toba explained that this is a result of Maeda's effort to remove the restrictions <b>that</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> writing the scenario for a video game.|$|E

25|$|Taxonomy is {{the branch}} of biology that names and classifies all living things. Scientists use {{morphological}} and genetic similarities {{to assist them in}} categorising life forms based on ancestral relationships. For example, orangutans, gorillas, chimpanzees, and humans all belong to the same taxonomic grouping referred to as a family—in this case the family called Hominidae. These animals are grouped together because of similarities in morphology <b>that</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> common ancestry (called homology).|$|E

25|$|Many of the {{advantages}} for postalcoholic fermentation answer the disadvantages of early inoculation (namely less antagonism and potential for undesirable byproducts). Also, the advantage is seen of the lees being a nutrient source through the autolysis of the dead yeast cells, though that nutrient source {{may not always be}} enough to ensure MLF runs successfully to completion. Conversely, many of the disadvantages of late inoculation are the absence of {{the advantages}} <b>that</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> early inoculation (higher temperatures, potentially quicker completion, etc.).|$|E

As a result, Whole Foods' high prices do not turn customers away from shopping. In fact, they are pleased buying organic products <b>that</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> sustainable practices.|$|E

Carlo must be rescued, otherwise he will be forced to fight for his life to escape a ruthless gang of ex-military mercenaries. The film revolves around two families <b>that</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> two totally different worlds.

25|$|Despite the {{barriers}} <b>that</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> being born to immigrants who are generally low skilled, have little education, and have less {{knowledge of the}} English language compared to U.S. natives, second-generation immigrants are doing better than U.S. native groups of comparable racial backgrounds, contradicting the concept of downward assimilation. A major factor that contributes to second-generation immigrants doing so well is the drive to succeed and do better than their predecessors that is commonly instilled in these immigrants from childhood by their families. The theory of segment assimilation undermines such early socialization.|$|E
