5|$|A {{new method}} to study lipid bilayers is Atomic force {{microscopy}} (AFM). Rather <b>than</b> <b>using</b> {{a beam of}} light or particles, a very small sharpened tip scans the surface by making physical contact with the bilayer and moving across it, like a record player needle. AFM is a promising technique because {{it has the potential to}} image with nanometer resolution at room temperature and even under water or physiological buffer, conditions necessary for natural bilayer behavior. Utilizing this capability, AFM has been used to examine dynamic bilayer behavior including the formation of transmembrane pores (holes) and phase transitions in supported bilayers. Another advantage is that AFM does not require fluorescent or isotopic labeling of the lipids, since the probe tip interacts mechanically with the bilayer surface. Because of this, the same scan can image both lipids and associated proteins, sometimes even with single-molecule resolution. AFM can also probe the mechanical nature of lipid bilayers.|$|E

5|$|As well {{as being}} added, forces can also be {{resolved}} into independent components {{at right angles to}} each other. A horizontal force pointing northeast can therefore be split into two forces, one pointing north, and one pointing east. Summing these component forces using vector addition yields the original force. Resolving force vectors into components of a set of basis vectors is often a more mathematically clean way to describe forces <b>than</b> <b>using</b> magnitudes and directions. This is because, for orthogonal components, the components of the vector sum are uniquely determined by the scalar addition of the components of the individual vectors. Orthogonal components are independent of each other because forces acting at ninety degrees to each other have no effect on the magnitude or direction of the other. Choosing a set of orthogonal basis vectors is often done by considering what set of basis vectors will make the mathematics most convenient. Choosing a basis vector that is {{in the same direction as}} one of the forces is desirable, since that force would then have only one non-zero component. Orthogonal force vectors can be three-dimensional with the third component being at right-angles to the other two.|$|E

Instead, a ceremony began to take place each year at the Mersea Stone, near to the fort, involving local dignitaries and extensive eating and drinking. The fort was recommissioned during the Napoleonic Wars {{at the start of the}} 19th century, and a new gun battery was constructed overlooking the sea, equipped with six 24-pounder (10.9kg) guns. After this the fort was abandoned once again. A sea wall was built along the coast early in the century, cutting through the south-east side of the fort. The legislation on oysters was reformed by Parliament in 1870, which disbanded the previous court structure and severed the historic link with Mersea Fort. A defensive pill-box was constructed at the castle during the Second World War.|$|E
