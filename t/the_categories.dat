5|$|Chrysippus is {{the first}} Stoic for whom the third of the four Stoic categories, i.e. the {{category}} somehow disposed is attested. In the surviving evidence, Chrysippus frequently makes use of <b>the</b> <b>categories</b> of substance and quality, but makes little use {{of the other two}} Stoic categories (somehow disposed and somehow disposed in relation to something). It is not clear whether <b>the</b> <b>categories</b> had any special significance for Chrysippus, and a clear doctrine of categories may be the work of later Stoics.|$|E

40|$|The Ehresmann-Schein-Nambooripad (ESN) Theorem asserts an {{equivalence}} between <b>the</b> <b>category</b> of inverse semigroups and <b>the</b> <b>category</b> of inductive groupoids.

From the proof of this extension, we also generalize the ESN Theorem to an equivalence between <b>the</b> <b>category</b> of inverse semicategories and <b>the</b> <b>category</b> of locally inductive groupoids and to an equivalence between <b>the</b> <b>category</b> of inverse categories with oplax functors and <b>the</b> <b>category</b> of top-heavy locally inductive groupoids and ordered functors.

5|$|Internal realism was {{the view}} that, {{although}} {{the world may}} be causally independent of the human mind, {{the structure of the}} world—its division into kinds, individuals and categories—is a function of the human mind, and hence the world is not ontologically independent.

30|$|When L being a {{continuous}} lattice, an embedding functor from <b>the</b> <b>category</b> CS to SL-CS is introduced, {{then it is}} used to prove that <b>the</b> <b>category</b> CS can be embedded in <b>the</b> <b>category</b> SL-CS as a reflective subcategory.

It is well known that <b>the</b> <b>category</b> of topological spaces can be embedded in <b>the</b> <b>category</b> of stratified L-topological spaces as a both reflective and coreflective subcategory. But, we find that <b>the</b> <b>category</b> of convex spaces seem not be embedded in <b>the</b> <b>category</b> of stratified L-convex spaces as a both reflective and coreflective subcategory. This shows the difference between (stratified L-)topological spaces and (stratified L-) convex spaces from categorical sense.|$|R
25|$|In mathematics, a {{concrete}} category is a category that {{is equipped with}} a faithful functor to <b>the</b> <b>category</b> of sets.

Many important categories have obvious interpretations as concrete <b>categories,</b> for example <b>the</b> <b>category</b> of topological spaces and <b>the</b> <b>category</b> of groups, and trivially also <b>the</b> <b>category</b> of sets itself. On the other hand, <b>the</b> homotopy <b>category</b> of topological spaces is not concretizable, i.e. it does not admit a faithful functor to <b>the</b> <b>category</b> of sets.|$|R
