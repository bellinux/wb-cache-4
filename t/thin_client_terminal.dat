40|$|An {{increasing}} number of democratically elected governments including Sri Lanka are facing challenge of terrorism. The United Nations has identified terrorism {{as a threat to}} good governance. According to the prevailing situation of our country, security has become the most concerned for everybody since the high involvement of present humanity rescue mission. Sri Lanka Air Force (SLAF) has to face severe threats from LTTE carders. However, there is no proper Access Control and Monitoring System for authorization process at main guard rooms of SLAF. Because of this security weakness, enemy may enter in to any SLAF camp easily. New Access Monitoring and Control System was implemented with the help of available resources like personal service identification card which has been encoded as a secret data, using simple magnetic card reader with keyboard emulation mode and <b>thin</b> <b>client</b> <b>terminal</b> for data reader from service identity card and display details with photograph of serviceman. Further voice alert have been improved to draw attention of the policeman when unauthorized movements take place through the guard room. In the implementation process, SQL Server,. Net Environment with windows 2003 server, web and client server technology have been used with more security features. The Access Monitoring and Control System have been implemented as a pilot project at Sri Lanka Air Force Head Quarters. The system evaluation has found that this has improved the mechanism of identification of authorized and unauthorized people efficiency, reducing the queue and authentication time. It is expected to improve the security of serviceman and to get an online parade sheet preparation facility through improved management decision process with concurrent attendant details; and in addition to that a new weapon checking process has also been confirmed from civil society security. Finally, still there is no computer-based authentication process is used in any forces in Sri Lanka; this is the first experience for serviceman. This project is successfully achieved for all functional requirements as proposed and very low cost solution to improve the security level of any institution. I am satisfied as a serviceman hence Access Monitoring and Control System have been fulfilled the national requirement of Sri Lanka.

40|$|Mobile Agent {{technology}} {{is an interesting}} concept for large network-based system structures. In this paper we describe a Java-based agent environment which integrates agent execution platforms into World Wide Web servers promoting a world wide infrastructure for Mobile Agents. This system has been developed {{within the framework of}} MEMPHIS IST project, which involves the definition, development and validation of a new system for commercially significant multilingual premium services, focused on <b>thin</b> <b>clients</b> such as mobile phones, Personal Digital Assistants, etc. The concept relies on the extraction of multilingual information from various web-based content sources in different formats. The system is composed by three different Modules, namely the Acquisition, the Transformation and the Distribution Module. The content acquisition is based on dynamic user profiles. The acquired content is transformed into a meta-representation, which enables content storage independent both of source and destination format and language. The output format is based on the requirements of employed <b>thin</b> <b>client</b> <b>terminals</b> and the output document is distributed via the appropriate networks. The end-user receives the required information as premium services via the chosen output medium. The system supports both pull and push services. An evaluation of the system is also presented.

The youth centre offered {{a wide range of}} both structured and unstructured activities and events. The computing suite included a wireless local area network with Internet access, six moveable, <b>thin</b> <b>client</b> <b>terminals</b> located in the café area and three high-specification multimedia computers with printer and scanner in a separate room. The project was financed from the government’s Community Digital Strategy Partnership Fund that aimed to support local, regional and national initiatives to develop and achieve capability, confidence, relevant content and connection to realise community aspirations through information and communication technology (ICT). This paper presents the evaluation of the ICT youth project after just four months of operation. The mixed-method study, framed by the overlapping constructs of self-efficacy, social and human capital and third place, involved a survey, semi-structured interviews and observations. The findings revealed that most of the measures of success defined for the project were met but evaluation of many of the Personal Development objectives relating to an increase in the work, study, ICT and literacy skills of youth was not possible, due to the short evaluation period...|$|R
40|$|Subject of Research. This paper {{presents}} {{solution of}} authentication problem for all components of information interoperabilityin {{process of operation}} system network loading on <b>thin</b> <b>client</b> from <b>terminal</b> server. System Definition. In the proposed solution operation system integrity check is made by hardware-software module, including USB-token with protected memory for secure storage of cryptographic keys and loader. The key requirement for the solution is mutual authentication of four participants: <b>terminal</b> server, <b>thin</b> <b>client,</b> token and user. We have created two algorithms for the problem solution. The first of the designed algorithms compares the encrypted one-time password (random number) with the reference value stored {{in the memory of}} the token and updates this number in case of successful authentication. The second algorithm uses the public and private keys of the token and the server. As a result of cryptographic transformation, participants are authenticated and the secure channel is formed between the token, <b>thin</b> <b>client</b> and <b>terminal</b> server. Main Results. Additional research was carried out {{to find out if the}} designed algorithms meet the necessary requirements. Criteria used included applicability in a multi-access terminal system architecture, potential threats evaluation and overall system security. According to analysis results, it is recommended to use the algorithm based on PKI due to its high scalability and usability. High level of data security is proved as a result of asymmetric cryptography application with the guarantee that participants' private keys are never sent in the authentication process. Practical Relevance. The designed PKI-based algorithm allows solving the problem with the use of cryptographic algorithms according to state standard even in its absence on asymmetric cryptography. Thus, it can be applied in the State Information Systems with increased requirements to information security...|$|R

40|$|Purpose of the Study: The {{purpose of}} this study is to develop a {{comprehensive}} educational technology model based entirely on Open Source Software (OSS) and recycled computer hardware. This project looks at the rapidly growing Open Source Softwarc movement in the context of education and identifies emerging technologies that help to cut costs and close the digital divide throughout the education system. Procedure: The implementation of this project is based on a review of the literature and it involved setting up a small open source computer lab using recycled hardware at the Hilltop Recovery Center in Middleton, California. This project also includes a study of an almost identical open source computer lab in the Rincon Valley School District in Santa Rosa, California. Included in this study are also two interviews of the directors of each organization for the inclusion of feedback and evaluation each open source educational model in action. Findings: Throughout the course of this project a number of significant findings have emerged. Due to the low costs associated with OSS and recycled hardware educational organizations can easily afford to increase technology access. Additionally, the energy costs when using thin-clients is cut in half when compared to traditional desktop systems. The costs of supporting Linux versus Windows or Mac is less due to not having to fix and maintain individual desktop systems, instead managing one server for multiple workstations. Recycling extends the life of older computer hardware in a <b>thin</b> <b>client</b> and <b>terminal</b> services environment addressing substantial ecological challenges related to electronic waste. An open source educational model running on recycled hardware is also highly scalable and easy to replicate. Conclusion: Modeling educational technology after the open source software movement levels the socio-economic playing field with respect to equal opportunity and access to technology. Adopting an open source educational model offers extraordinary potential for increasing technology access and developing a sustainable model for educational technology...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{explores the}} issues and the {{techniques}} of enabling multimedia applications for the <b>thin</b> <b>client</b> computing. A prototype of a video communication system based on H. 323 family of ITU-T recommendations is used to demonstrate the support of multimedia applications with a <b>terminal</b> server and <b>thin</b> <b>clients</b> such as Windows-based terminals. The studies on the network applications over <b>thin</b> <b>clients</b> are composed of two parts: (1) the collaborative client–server conference system and (2) the universal plug-in architecture. With the proposed architecture, an application of multi-user audio/video conference system is devised for illustrative purposes. The universal plug-in technique is devised to shift jobs from <b>thin</b> <b>clients</b> to a supporting server, thus reducing the computing overhead required by the clients. The processed result at the supporting server is transcoded to a pre-defined universal format and then {{sent back to the}} <b>thin</b> <b>client.</b> This plug-in architecture is implemented and empirically evaluated.
