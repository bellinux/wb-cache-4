5|$|In {{the fifth}} season premiere, Blair {{continues}} to plan her wedding, but begins to encounter problems in {{her relationship with}} Louis. It is later revealed that she is pregnant. Blair tells Chuck {{that the child is}} Louis', and states that part of her wanted Chuck to be the father. Dan becomes Blair's confidante and is shown to be in love with her, though she remains oblivious to his feelings and states <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> more than friendship between them.|$|E
5|$|Before joining Bernard in Paris, Rosa {{stays in}} a flat in London for several weeks. Now that she has no {{intention}} of honouring the agreement of her passport, which was to return to South Africa within a year, she openly introduces herself as Burger's daughter. This attracts the attention of the media and she attends several political events. At one such event, Rosa sees Baasie, but when she tries to talk to him, he starts criticising her for not knowing his real name (Zwelinzima Vulindlela). He says <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> special about her father having died in prison as many black fathers have also died there, and adds that he does not need her help. Rosa is devastated by her childhood friend's hurtful remarks, and overcome with guilt, she abandons her plans of going into exile in France and returns to South Africa.|$|E
5|$|However, {{there are}} some {{complications}} which neither Wally nor the experienced Alisandros anticipates. This time, Varrick's CEO Rueben Massey feels sure <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> wrong with Krayoxx. The drug works as advertised, it has no ill effects and is unjustly maligned; Varrick has first-rate experts with impeccable records willing to so testify. The Varrick CEO flies to Chicago and engages Nadine Karros, the Rogan Rothberg ace litigator, who asks for a $5 million non-refundable retainer and bills at $1,000 per hour - and {{those who can afford}} it consider her worth every penny. With Karros' help, Varrick sets a trap for the mass tort lawyers. This time Varrick will only pretend to negotiate – their true aim would be to have a jury completely vindicate Krayoxx and deny any kind of tort.|$|E

5|$|The Campaign for Borders Rail {{has called}} for the {{continuation}} of the line to Melrose and Hawick, and eventually to Carlisle. According to the group, Hawick suffered more than any other town in the Borders from the closure of the Waverley Route, and only the return of the railway could halt the area's economic decline. At the time of the closure of the Waverley Route, Hawick was a 70-minute journey from Edinburgh. At Melrose, the southbound station platform and building exist alongside the Melrose Bypass. Network Rail has confirmed <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> to prevent the extension of the line beyond Tweedbank, although commentators have remarked that the Bypass could pose problems. A major realignment of the road would be required, as well as the reinstatement of embankments and bridges.|$|E
5|$|There are {{different}} {{opinions on the}} significance of these principles. Some note that the osteopathic medical philosophy is akin to the tenets of holistic medicine, suggestive of a kind of social movement within the field of medicine, one that promotes a more patient-centered, holistic approach to medicine, and emphasizes the role of the primary care physician within the health care system. Others point out <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> in the principles that would distinguish D.O. from M.D. training in any fundamental way. One study, published in The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association found a majority of M.D. medical school administrators and faculty saw nothing objectionable in the core principles listed above, and some endorse them generally as broad medical principles.|$|E
5|$|While {{working on}} an oil rig, Lenny and Homer accidentally set fire to an ant, who in turn sets fire to all her ant companions, who jump in a puddle of oil to {{extinguish}} the flames. Their brief sighs of relief are replaced with screams as the whole rig catches fire. Marge goes with Artie along with Carl to West Springfield to save Homer and Lenny. At first, they are reluctant, as Homer still thinks that Marge and Artie are having an affair, and Lenny feels <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> for him in Artie's helicopter. However, Artie finally admits defeat to Homer, saying that winning Marge's love was something that he could never accomplish, even with his billions, and Homer jumps on the ladder to the helicopter. Carl reveals {{that he is in}} the helicopter, and Lenny also jumps on to be saved, just before the rig collapses. Homer and Marge's marriage is also apparently saved when Artie offers a solution to Homer's snoring problem, a device which converts snoring to music. However, Artie's voice is soon heard through the device's speaker, giving Marge anti-Homer subliminal messages and eventually saying that he is watching her through a camera.|$|E

Haribhadra notes that Charvakas assert <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> beyond the senses, consciousness is an emergent property, {{and that it is}} foolish to seek what cannot be seen.|$|E
25|$|The {{evidence}} whether Wren was a speculative freemason is {{the subject}} of the Prestonian Lecture of 2011, which concludes on the evidence of two obituaries and Aubrey's memoirs, with supporting materials, that he did indeed attend the closed meeting in 1691, probably of the Lodge of Antiquity, but <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> to suggest that he was ever a Grand Officer as claimed by Anderson.|$|E

25|$|Descartes {{explains}} how {{he made a}} mention of the two questions, the existence of God, and the soul, in his Discourse on Method. Following this, he received objections, {{and two of them}} he considers are of importance. The first is how he concludes that the essence of the soul is a thing that thinks, excluding all other nature. To this he says that he has a clear perception that he is a thinking thing, and has no other clear perception, and from this he concludes <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> else in the essence of the self.|$|E
25|$|According to Peter Harvey, Pratityasamutpada is an ontological principle; that is, {{a theory}} {{to explain the}} nature and {{relations}} of being, becoming, existence and ultimate reality. Buddhism asserts <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> independent, except the state of nirvana. All physical and mental states depend on and arise from other pre-existing states, and in turn from them arise other dependent states while they cease. The 'dependent arisings' have a causal conditioning, and thus Pratityasamutpada is the Buddhist belief that causality {{is the basis of}} ontology, not a creator God nor the ontological Vedic concept called universal Self (Brahman) nor any other 'transcendent creative principle'.|$|E

25|$|Eli goes on {{to train}} Samuel. When Samuel hears God {{speaking}} to him, he at first thinks it is Eli; Eli, who doesn't hear God calling Samuel, eventually realizes the truth, and instructs Samuel on how to respond. Samuel is told that God's threat (which isn't elaborated further) {{will be carried out}} on Eli and his family, and <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> {{that can be done to}} prevent it. Eli asks Samuel what he had been told, insisting that he be told the whole truth, and so Samuel does; Eli reacts by saying that God will do as he judges best.|$|E
25|$|Causal {{determinism}} is {{the concept}} that events within a given paradigm are bound by causality {{in such a way}} that any state (of an object or event) is completely determined by prior states. Causal determinism proposes that there is an unbroken chain of prior occurrences stretching back to the origin of the universe. Causal determinists believe <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> uncaused or self-caused. The most common form of causal determinism is nomological determinism (or scientific determinism), the notion that the past and the present dictate the future entirely and necessarily by rigid natural laws, that every occurrence results inevitably from prior events. Quantum mechanics poses a serious challenge to this view.|$|E
25|$|Washington biographer {{and uncle}} of Howard Hughes, Rupert Hughes, {{researched}} {{the matter and}} determined that Rev. Gano served with Clinton's army, not with Washington's, that the location is sometimes given as Valley Forge and sometimes as the Potomac, {{that there is no}} documentation of Gano ever being at Valley Forge, <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> in Gano's own correspondence or his biography to suggest that the event took place, and that none of the 42 reputed witnesses ever documented the event. Gano Chapel at William Jewell College in Missouri is named after John Gano, and displays a painting of Gano baptizing Washington. The school takes no stance on whether the baptism of Washington actually took place. The chapel also contains a sword owned by the Marquis de Lafayette that Washington purportedly gave to Gano.|$|E

25|$|Although {{parliament}} {{passed the}} bill, as the Local Courts Act in February 2011, {{as the result}} of strong opposition, the president Bingu wa Mutharika agreed to refer thhis legislation to the Malawi Law Commission, which had not completed its review when the President died in April 2012. The new President Joyce Banda confirmed that the review should continue but the election as President in May 2014 of Peter Mutharika, brother of Bingu wa Mutharika and a statement from the Law Commission <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> fundamentally wrong with the 2011 Act brought the review to an end. However, although the current Malawian government recognises the need to provide the rural poor in particular with an accessible system of justice, it lacks the funds to implement the proposed reform.|$|E
25|$|In {{his visits}} to Indianapolis, Wilson {{found that there}} was only one, unnamed African American {{represented}} in the city's many memorials and sculptures. The formerly enslaved African American figure appears {{at the base of the}} Indiana Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument, a 284ft. 6 in. commemoration of the American Civil War, the American Revolution, the War of 1812, the Spanish–American War and the Mexican–American War. Some suggest that with the passage of time the commemorative nature of war memorials has been replaced with a more utilitarian purpose, such as city beautification. Consequently, the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument is said to symbolize both the city of Indianapolis and the state of Indiana. While others argue <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> more invisible than monuments, some art historians suggest that art can be utilized as a vehicle for racist ideology.|$|E
25|$|Whether the Western Rite survives in the Eastern Orthodox Church {{and will}} be {{accepted}} by the majority who follow the Byzantine Rite remains yet to be seen. In the meantime, the Byzantine Rite bishops who oversee Western Rite parishes and many who oversee no Western Rite parishes continue to declare the Western Rite members of their Church to be Orthodox Christians and regard them as fully in communion {{with the rest of the}} Church. Though there have been negative appraisals on both sides of the Western Rite issue, supporters of the Western Rite claim <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> inherently divisive about having a separate liturgical practice, particularly since these churches remain under the pastoral care of their diocesan bishop rather than a Western Rite bishop. As yet, there are no schisms within the episcopacy of any Orthodox Church regarding the issue of Western Rite parishes.|$|E
