5|$|Despite {{receiving}} financing {{from other}} sources, including Saul Zaentz (who agreed {{to distribute the}} soundtrack album on his Fantasy Records label), the budget was tight enough to exclude pencil tests, so Bakshi had to test the animation by flipping an animator's drawings in his hand before they were inked and painted. When a cameraman realized that the cels for the desert scenes were not wide enough and revealed the transparency, Bakshi painted a cactus to cover the mistake. Very few storyboards were used. Bakshi and Vita walked around the Lower East Side, Washington Square Park, Chinatown and Harlem, taking moody snapshots. Artist Ira Turek inked the outlines of these photographs onto cels with a Rapidograph, the technical pen preferred by Crumb, giving the film's backgrounds a stylized realism virtually unprecedented in animation. The tones of <b>the</b> <b>watercolor</b> backgrounds were influenced {{by the work of}} Ashcan School painters such as George Luks and John French Sloan. Among other unusual techniques, bent and fisheye camera perspectives were used to portray the way the film's hippies and hoodlums viewed the city. Many scenes featured documentary recordings of real conversations in place of scripted dialogue—this too would become a signature of Bakshi's.|$|E

25|$|Hulsker {{called the}} signed drawing The Public Soup Kitchen (F1020a below) {{important}} and attractive. Van Gogh and his contemporary George Hendrik Breitner had sketched {{together at a}} soup kitchen in the Geest (it is not known which of the several possibilities it was). After going to the trouble and expense of installing shutters in his windows to adjust the light and to recreate the scene itself in his studio, van Gogh was able to study his models at leisure. In this way {{he was able to}} introduce more chiaroscuro (light and dark) in his drawing, which he executed with the natural ('mountain') chalk that Theo had sent him and whose properties he lauds in his letters. All the models are from Sien's family: her mother and baby on the left, her sister, back turned, and her daughter, hair cropped as a precaution against lice, in the center, with Sien herself, superbly executed in profile, on the right. <b>The</b> <b>watercolor</b> F1020b (below) is much less successful as van Gogh himself acknowledged, blaming the paper in part for not being right for the job.|$|E

500|$|The art in Ōkami {{is highly}} {{inspired}} by Japanese watercolor and wood carving {{art of the}} Ukiyo-e style, such {{as the work of}} Hokusai. Ōkami was originally planned to be rendered in a more photorealistic 3D style. However, Clover Studio determined that the more colorful sumi-e style allowed them to better convey Amaterasu's association with nature and the task of restoring it. The change was also influenced by limitations in the PS2 hardware to render the photorealistic 3D graphics. As a result of the switch to <b>the</b> <b>watercolor</b> style, the idea of the Celestial Brush came about. Atsushi Inaba, CEO of Clover, noted that [...] "Once we fixed ourselves on a graphical style and got down to the brushwork, we thought 'Wouldn't it be great if we could somehow get the player involved and participate in this artwork instead of just watching it?' That's how the idea of the Celestial Brush was born". Original concepts for enemies included the use of dinosaurs, but the designs settled onto more demon-like characters.|$|E

2500|$|Because it was cheaper for Ira Turek {{to trace}} {{photographs}} {{to create the}} backgrounds, Bakshi and Johnnie Vita walked around {{the streets of the}} Lower East Side, Washington Square Park, Chinatown and Harlem to take moody snapshots. Turek inked the outlines of these photographs onto cels with a Rapidograph, the technical pen preferred by Crumb, giving the film's backgrounds stylized realism that had never been portrayed in animation before. After Turek completed a background drawing in ink on an animation cel, the drawing would be photocopied onto watercolor paper for Vita and onto animation paper for use in matching the characters to the backgrounds. When Vita finished his painting, Turek's original drawing, on the cel, would be placed over <b>the</b> <b>watercolor,</b> obscuring the photocopy lines on the painting. However, not every background was taken from live-action sources. The tones of <b>the</b> <b>watercolor</b> backgrounds were influenced by the [...] "Ash Can style" [...] of painters, which includes George Luks and John French Sloan.

2500|$|Typically, {{the work}} entailed {{critical}} {{observation of the}} painting's subject, as well as preparatory drawings of the figure and perspective plans of the scull in the water. Its preparation and composition indicates the importance of Eakins' academic training in Paris. It was a completely original conception, true to Eakins' firsthand experience, and an almost startlingly successful image for the artist, who had struggled with his first outdoor composition {{less than a year}} before. His first known sale was <b>the</b> <b>watercolor</b> [...] The Sculler (1874). [...] Most critics judged the rowing pictures successful and auspicious, but after the initial flourish, Eakins never revisited the subject of rowing and went on to other sports themes.|$|E
2500|$|His works {{during this}} time include Camel (in rhythmic {{landscape}} with trees) {{as well as other}} paintings with abstract graphical elements such as betroffener Ort (Affected Place) (1922). From that period he created Die Zwitscher-Maschine (The Twittering Machine), which was later removed from the National Gallery. After being named defamatory in the Munich exhibition [...] "Entartete Kunst", the painting was later bought by the Buchholz Gallery, New York, and then transferred in 1939 to the Museum of Modern Art. The [...] "twittering" [...] in the title refers to the open-beaked birds, while the [...] "machine" [...] is illustrated by the crank. <b>The</b> <b>watercolor</b> painting appears at a first glance childish, but it allows more interpretations. The picture can be interpreted as a critic by Klee, who shows through denaturation of the birds, that the world technization heist the creatures' self-determination.|$|E
