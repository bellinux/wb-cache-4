500|$|Two {{types of}} gun design were produced: Type A was of high alloy steel, and Type B of more {{ordinary}} steel. Type B {{was chosen for}} production because it was lighter.

Comparison of the queuing algorithms is based on attack-intensity. We are checking the performance of each queuing algorithm on a particular queue limit against different attack intensities. Here an attempt has been made to cover an overview of Denial of Service (DoS) attack, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack, methods of attack, DDoS attack tool kits and queuing algorithms. The results in this paper also indicate that UDP type attack traffic is more powerful as compared to TCP type attack in terms of bandwidth consumption...|$|R

50|$|A trailer tail, boat <b>tail,</b> or rear <b>fairing</b> is an {{aerodynamic}} device {{intended to}} improve the fuel economy of semi-trailer trucks. It comprises a set of panels, usually collapsible, which fold out {{from the rear of}} the trailer, creating a tapered shape that reduces drag from the low-pressure wake created behind the trailer. Trailer tails are one form of aerodynamic technology verified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's SmartWay Transport Partnership. Trailer tails alone have demonstrated a fuel savings of 1%-5%, and in concert with trailer skirts, 9% improvement has been demonstrated.|$|R

50|$|During an {{era when}} biplanes were still common, {{the use of a}} {{monoplane}} planform, a NACA engine cowl, and large wheel pants significantly reduced aerodynamic drag, creating a streamlined design. Construction of the fuselage and wings was based on a plywood structure with the thin wings braced with wires. The sleek, polished fuselage continued the shape and width of the cowl throughout, with the cockpit featuring a small windshield, set nearly flush with the skin.

40|$|Expressions for {{calculation}} of subsonic and supersonic, steady and {{unsteady aerodynamic forces}} are derived, using the concept of aerodynamic elements applied to the downwash velocity potential method. Aerodynamic elements can be of arbitrary out of plane polygon shape, although numerical calculations are restricted to rectangular elements, and to the steady state case in the supersonic examples. It is suggested {{that the use of}} conforming, in place of rectangular elements, would give better results. Agreement with results for subsonic oscillating T <b>tails</b> is <b>fair,</b> but results do not converge as the number of collocation points is increased. This appears to be due to the form of expression used in the calculations. The methods derived are expected to facilitate automated flutter analysis on the computer. In particular, the aerodynamic element concept is consistent with finite element methods already used for structural analysis. The method is universal for the complete Mach number range, and, finally, the calculations can be arranged so {{that they do not have}} to be repeated completely for every reduced frequency...|$|R
40|$|Did God create life? Or did life arise via naturalistic processes, {{along the}} lines of random {{mutation}} and natural selection as suggested by Darwin? Intelligent design proponents attempt to use William Dembski’s design inference to argue that the existence of intelligent life is due to design. I will argue that the design inference is flawed, because it {{does not take into account}} the fact that the universe is spatially infinite. The Design Inference To determine that some events are due to design, Dembski utilizes what he calls “the Law of Small Probability”: “specified events of small probability do not occur by chance” (Dembski 1998, 48). Dembski concludes instead that specified events of small probability occur by design. I will argue that this so-called law is false, thus calling into question the validity of Dembski’s inferences to design. I will start by explaining what Dembski means by “specified”. His precise criterion is complicated, but the basic idea is easy to grasp. If you flip a coin a bunch of times, you’ll get a certain sequence of heads and <b>tails.</b> For a <b>fair</b> coin, each particular sequence is as probable as any other sequence.

Slight engine modifications included a return to the B/C model style Keihin CVKD carburettor and a 10% heavier crankshaft offset by a reduced diameter flywheel reported to help the engine spin up quicker, boosting low and mid-range torque.|$|E
50|$|The 750 lb M43 BZ {{cluster bomb}} had a 16 in {{diameter}} and a 66 in length. This cluster bomb was designed to hold three stacks of 19 M138 bomblets. The bomblets each held about 6 oz of the incapacitating agent BZ, also known as 3-Quinuclidinyl benzilate.The M43 {{was meant to be}} delivered from a subsonic aircraft and used a standard cluster adapter which would have <b>tail</b> <b>fairing</b> added to adapt it for high speeds. The M43 cluster bomb was intended to cover an area of about 0.11 to 0.88 ha with BZ agent, which made it useful for attacking a squad or company sized element. A weapon such as the M43 would have been best used against hard, high-value intelligence targets, in hostage or prisoner rescue situations, or in any other situation where friendly forces and enemy forces occupied the same area.|$|E
50|$|The design {{specifications}} were completed in February 1945, and contracts were let {{to build the}} components. Three different plants were used {{so that no one}} would have a copy of the complete design. The gun and breech were made by the Naval Gun Factory in Washington, D.C.; the target case and some other components were by the Naval Ordnance Plant in Center Line, Michigan; and the <b>tail</b> <b>fairing</b> and mounting brackets by the Expert Tool and Die Company in Detroit, Michigan. The bomb, except for the uranium payload, was ready at the beginning of May 1945. The uranium-235 projectile was completed on 15 June, and the target on 24 July. The target and bomb pre-assemblies (partly assembled bombs without the fissile components) left Hunters Point Naval Shipyard, California, on 16 July aboard the heavy cruiser , arriving on 26 July. The target inserts followed by air on 30 July.|$|E
5000|$|The {{defensive}} armaments of the Anson {{consisted of}} a single [...]303 in (7.7 mm) Vickers machine gun which was fixed within the forward fuselage and aimed by the pilot, while an Armstrong Whitworth-built manually operated gun turret located on the Anson's dorsal section was fitted with a single Lewis gun. Additionally, up to 360 lb of bombs, which could consist of a maximum of two 100 lb and eight 20 lb bombs, could be carried in the aircraft's wings. Those Ansons {{that were used in}} the training role were outfitted with dual controls and usually had the gun turret removed, although specific aircraft used for gunnery training were fitted with a Bristol hydraulically operated gun turret, similar to that used in the Bristol Blenheim. The <b>tail</b> <b>fairing</b> of the starboard nacelle contains an inflatable dinghy which is provided with automatic actuators and marine distress beacons.|$|E
5000|$|The main {{combustion}} {{chamber of the}} 509B engine used for the B V6 and V18 occupied the same location as the A-series' engine did, with the lower Marschofen [...] "cruise chamber" [...] housed within the retractable tailwheel's appropriately widened ventral <b>tail</b> <b>fairing.</b> On 6 July 1944, the Me 163B V18 (VA+SP), like the B V6 basically a standard production Me 163B airframe outfitted with the new-twin chamber [...] "cruiser" [...] rocket motor with the aforementioned modifications beneath the original rocket motor orifice to accept the extra {{combustion chamber}}, set a new unofficial world speed record of 1130 km/h, piloted by Heini Dittmar, and landed with {{almost all of the}} vertical rudder surface broken away from flutter. This record was not broken in terms of absolute speed until 6 November 1947 by Chuck Yeager in flight number 58 {{that was part of the}} Bell X-1 test program, with a 1434 km/h, or Mach 1.35 supersonic speed, recorded at an altitude of nearly 14820 m.|$|E
50|$|Two {{types of}} gun design were produced: Type A was of high alloy steel, and Type B of more {{ordinary}} steel. Type B {{was chosen for}} production because it was lighter. The primers and propellant {{were the same as}} those previously chosen for Thin Man. Scale test firing of the hollow projectile and target insert was conducted with the 3-inch/50 caliber gun and a 20 mm Hispano cannon. Starting in December, test firing was done full-scale. Amazingly, the first test case produced {{turned out to be the}} best ever made. It was used in four test firings at the Anchor Ranch, and ultimately in the Little Boy used in the bombing of Hiroshima. The design specifications were completed in February 1945, and contracts were let to build the components. Three different plants were used so that no one would have a copy of the complete design. The gun and breech were made by the Naval Gun Factory in Washington, D.C.; the target, case and some other components were by the Naval Ordnance Plant in Center Line, Michigan; and the <b>tail</b> <b>fairing</b> and mounting brackets by the Expert Tool and Die Company in Detroit, Michigan.|$|E
40|$|Report {{presents}} the results of tests made to determine the drag of closed-cockpit and transport-type windshields. The tests were made at speeds corresponding to a Mach number range of approximately 0. 25 to 0. 58 in the NACA 8 -foot high-speed wind tunnel. This speed range corresponds to a test Reynolds number range of 2, 510, 000 to 4, 830, 000 based on the mean aerodynamic chord of the full-span model (17. 29 in.). The shapes of the windshield proper, the hood, and the <b>tail</b> <b>fairing</b> were systematically varied to include common types and refined design...|$|E
40|$|Aerodynamic shape {{optimization}} {{is demonstrated}} to tailor the under-track pressure signature of a conceptual low-boom supersonic aircraft. Primarily, the optimization reduces nearfield pressure waveforms induced by propulsion integration effects. For computational efficiency, gradient-based optimization is used and coupled to the discrete adjoint {{formulation of the}} Reynolds-averaged Navier Stokes equations. The engine outer nacelle, nozzle, and vertical <b>tail</b> <b>fairing</b> are axi-symmetrically parameterized, while the horizontal tail is shaped using a wing-based parameterization. Overall, 48 design variables are coupled to the geometry and used to deform the outer mold line. During the design process, an inequality drag constraint is enforced to avoid major compromise in aerodynamic performance. Linear elastic mesh morphing is used to deform volume grids between design iterations. The optimization is performed at Mach 1. 6 cruise, assuming standard day altitude conditions at 51, 707 -ft. To reduce uncertainty, a coupled thermodynamic engine cycle model is employed that captures installed inlet performance effects on engine operation...|$|E
