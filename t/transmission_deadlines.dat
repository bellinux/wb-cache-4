For {{constant}} B 1 [*]and B 2, this energy function {{turns out to be}} strictly decreasing with the <b>transmission</b> <b>deadline</b> in AWGN BC. Using this fact, it can be proved by induction that energy consumption of a multi-epoch optimal schedule is a strictly decreasing function of <b>transmission</b> <b>deadline.</b> Hence, there is a unique transmission completion time by which an optimal policy consumes a given amount of energy, and vice versa. Now, suppose that schedules S 1 [*]and S 2 [*]are optimal solutions of Problems 1 and 2, defined with the deadline T, respectively. Both schedules must consume the same amount of energy since the opposite claim would contradict the optimality of the schedules: S 2 [*]cannot use more energy by T[*]than S 1, by definition. Suppose less energy is used, implying that S 1 [*]has used some extra energy to deliver the same amount of data as S 2. However, this extra energy could be used in the last epoch to decrease the completion time by a nonzero amount, which would contradict optimality. Therefore, S 1 [*]and S 2 [*]are two schedules completing the transmission of the same amount of data at the same time by consuming same amount of energy. Hence, the solution of Problem 1 having a transmission completion time of Topt, is also a solution to Problem 2 with <b>transmission</b> <b>deadline</b> Topt.

Previous seminar works are not deadline sensitive, and often suffer from highly dynamic multi-channel environments. As they focus more on transmitting packets with the optimal channel, resources are not efficiently used when sufficient channels are available in multi-radio multi-channel systems. Decisions are made without time constraints, while in dynamic wireless environments, deadlines are always presented for both probing and data transmission process. In this paper, we propose a transmission deadline probing paradigm, and an optimal probing and transmission schedule with time constraints is proposed, which is a pure threshold policy.

In a static channel, a closed form {{solution of the}} optimal offline scheduling (vis-à-vis total transmission energy), assuming information of all packet arrivals, {{for a set of}} packets each subject to an individual delay constraint is derived. It is shown that when packet arrivals are identically and independently distributed, the optimal packet transmission durations (or, equivalently, transmission rates) exhibit a symmetry property, which leads to a simple and exact solution of the average packet delay. The delay performance for the optimal offline scheduling of a set of packets subject to a single <b>transmission</b> <b>deadline</b> is also analyzed and shown to be potentially unbounded. The problem of optimal offline scheduling is then extended to fading channels. The properties of the optimal offline transmission rates and the corresponding delay performance are also characterized. Heuristic online schedulers, assuming causal information only, are also studied. The properties of the optimal offline scheduling are demonstrated via simulations.; Delay-constrained energy-efficient packet transmission is then considered under a multihop link. For static channels, given an end-to-end delay constraint for each packet, the optimal offline scheduling over a multihop link is obtained. The transmission energy and average packet delay performance are analyzed and characterized. Extension to fading channels is also considered. It is further demonstrated via simulations that energy savings via multihopping are possible, but heavily depend on factors such as multihop resource orthogonalization mode, scheduling algorithms, delay constraints, SNR operation regions, and channel variations.; Packet transmission over wireless channels is subject to losses. Note that some applications can tolerate a small fraction of packet losses. Therefore, we initiate the study of proactive packet dropping, while satisfying the required maximum packet loss rate, to maximize transmission energy savings.

As a {{widespread}} automotive network, CAN (Controller Area Network) buses are deployed in modern cars {{to fulfill the}} demands of more than 90 collaborating electronic control devices. For safety critical applications, fast and reliable data transfer is indispensable, since often hard real-time <b>transmission</b> <b>deadlines</b> have to be met to assure a safe op-eration of the vehicle. Therefore, deterministic performance evaluation methods are inevitable for the validation of systems that must guarantee hard delay bounds and timeliness of information processing. One recent deterministic modeling approach is Network Calculus, which allows to determine worst case transmission times. Based on real-world communi-cation CAN bus data, we generate appropriate modeling elements for the Network Calculus as arrival and service curves that reflect all priorities of CAN traffic.

Since the energy required to transmit a given amount of data is a convex and monotonically increasing function of the transmission rate [5, 12], theoretically one can improve energy efficiency by transmitting data at lower rates. Unfortunately, low data rates result in longer transmission duration and larger communication delay at receiving end, which is usually undesirable. How to optimally schedule transmission process to both minimize the total power consumption and observe all time constraints (available times and <b>transmission</b> <b>deadlines)</b> is a challenging and interesting problem.

For a group of packets subject to a single <b>transmission</b> <b>deadline,</b> the optimal dropping scheme (vis-à-vis total transmission energy) is derived. For packets subject to individual delay constraints, the optimal scheme depends on the energy function and packet sizes. Thus, asymptotically optimal dropping schemes, i. e., when packet size grows large, are pursued. The asymptotically optimal dropping scheme for a single dropped packet is obtained. For dropping more than one packet, two suboptimal, recursive schemes are proposed. These schemes achieve performance very close to the asymptotically optimal schemes as determined by an exhaustive search. Additionally, two performance bounds are derived.

In a priority driven protocol, messages are assigned priorities and the protocol ensures that messages are transmitted in the order of their priorities. Timed token protocols do not provide for priority arbitration but ensure that the maximum access delay for a station is bounded. For both protocols, we first derive the schedulability conditions under which the <b>transmission</b> <b>deadlines</b> of a given set of synchronous messages can be guaranteed.

Previous studies focused on network coding over large finite fields or developed Markov chains to model the delay distribution but did not look at the effect of <b>transmission</b> <b>deadlines</b> on the delay. In this work, we consider generations of source packets that are encoded and transmitted over the erasure broadcast channel. The transmission of packets associated to a generation is taken to be deadline-constrained, that is, the transmitter drops a generation and proceeds to the next one when a predetermined deadline expires. Closed-form expressions for the average number of required packet transmissions per generation are obtained in terms of the generation size, the field size, the erasure probability and the deadline choice. An upper bound on the average decoding delay, which is tighter than previous bounds found in the literature, is also derived. Analysis shows that the proposed framework can be used to fine-tune the system parameters and ascertain that neither insufficient nor excessive amounts of packets are sent over the broadcast channel.

30|$|We have {{proposed}} an energy efficient opportunistic multiuser scheduling scheme {{in the presence}} of a hard deadline delay constraint for the individual packets. The proposed scheme schedules the data depending on the instantaneous short-term fading and <b>transmission</b> <b>deadline</b> of the packets and exploits good channel conditions to make the system energy efficient. The many-user analysis and MDP modeling of the proposed scheme is the major contribution of this work. The many-user model helps to compute solution for the case of convex rate-power curve. Our system modeling ensures that the multiuser scheduling can be broken into a packet-based scheduling problem in the many-user limit. Though threshold optimization for the packet transmission is not a convex optimization problem, it can be solved within small margins of optimality with quite low complexity. We show that random arrivals can be modeled as constant arrivals with random size in the many-user limit and the scheduling decisions are independent of the deadline distribution of the arriving packets. The numerical results demonstrate that the many-user considerations are applicable for a reasonable network size of a few hundred users. The hard deadline can be used as a tuning parameter by the system designer to control the trade-off between the energy efficiency of the system and the maximum latency tolerated by the application.|$|R

This schedulability condition is necessary and sufficient for preemptive deadline-ordered service disciplines, and for a server that allows the presence of nohreal-time packets (i. e., packets with no deadlines), it is also necessary and sufficient for nonpreemptive deadline-ordered service disciplines. We also address the schedulability problem for service disciplines in general, and show the optimality of deadline-ordered service disciplines.

30|$|The {{second reason}} for FPRRA’s {{inability}} {{to achieve a}} higher throughput {{is the use of}} LUIF, both in its CAC component and in its MAC scheme. The use of LUIF in the CAC scheme can lead to the degradation of more than one user with low LUIF, in order to accommodate the new video call. If LUIF wasn’t considered, {{it is possible that the}} new call would have had to be the only one to be degraded or it would have been rejected, if it could not lead to an increase in provider profit. Both of these outcomes (degradation/rejection of the new call) would in most cases lead the system to achieve higher throughput than the case when the new user is accepted but more than one existing users are degraded. Also, the use of LUIF in the MAC scheme can lead to prioritizing for transmission users which have a higher LUIF but their <b>transmission</b> <b>deadline</b> is not approaching, whereas other users with lower LUIF and imminent deadlines will have to wait. This leads to suboptimal channel utilization in order to preserve fairness in terms of user satisfaction.

Moreover, we find that: (i) The reliability behavior is different for the two strategies, while the limiting factors are both finite blocklengths and overhead of acquiring CSI. (ii) With the same order of diversity, best antenna selection is more reliable than best relay selection.

Higher weights are assigned to the slots that have higher probability for deadline-abiding delivery. Given the sets of weights of the senders' video streams, we propose the low-complexity Delay-Aware Resource Allocation (DARA) approach to compute the optimal slot allocation policy that maximizes the deadline-abiding delivery of all senders. A unique characteristic of the DARA approach is that it yields a non-stationary slot allocation policy {{that depends on the}} allocation of previous slots. We prove that the DARA approach is optimal for weight distributions that are exponentially decreasing in time. We further implement our framework for real-time video streaming in wireless personal area networks that are gaining significant traction within the new Internet-of-Things (IoT) paradigm. For multiple surveillance videos encoded with H. 264 /AVC and streamed via the 6 tisch framework that simulates the IoT-oriented IEEE 802. 15. 4 e TSCH medium access control, our solution is shown to be the only one that ensures all video bitstreams are delivered with acceptable quality in a deadline-abiding manner...|$|R
40|$|Modeling the {{fundamental}} performance limits of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is {{of paramount importance}} to understand their behavior under the worst-case conditions and to make the appropriate design choices. This is particular relevant for time-sensitive WSN applications, where the timing behavior of the network protocols (message <b>transmission</b> must respect <b>deadlines)</b> impacts on the correct operation of these applications. In that direction this paper contributes with a methodology based on Network Calculus, which enables quick and efficient worst-case dimensioning of static or even dynamically changing cluster-tree WSNs where the data sink can either be static or mobile. We propose closed-form recurrent expressions for computing the worst-case end-to-end delays, buffering and bandwidth requirements across any source-destination path in a cluster-tree WSN. We show how to apply our methodology to the case of IEEE 802. 15. 4 /ZigBee cluster-tree WSNs. Finally, we demonstrate the validity and analyze the accuracy of our methodology through a comprehensive experimental study using commercially available technology, namely TelosB motes running TinyOS...|$|R
