During the scene in which Homer chokes on a donut, a poster explaining how the Heimlich maneuver works is on <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him.</b> In May 1992, Chris Bencze was able to save his brother's life by performing the Heimlich Maneuver on him, having seen it in the episode, and in December 2007, Aiden Bateman was able to save his friend Alex Hardy's life by recalling the same.|$|E
500|$|While {{the plot}} of the episode stands on its own, it also sets up much of the {{continuing}} plot of the series by including Easter eggs for events that do not occur until much later: as Fry falls into the freezer, the scene shows a strange shadow cast on <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him.</b> It is revealed in [...] "The Why of Fry" [...] that the shadow belongs to Nibbler, who intentionally pushes Fry into the freezer as part of a complex plan to save Earth from the Brainspawn in the future. Executive producer David X. Cohen claims that from the very beginning the creators had plans to show a larger conspiracy behind Fry's journey to the future. In the movie , it is revealed that the spacecraft seen destroying the city while Fry is frozen are piloted by Bender and those chasing him after he steals the Nobel Peace Prize.|$|E

Sure a pair {{was never}} seen so justly form'd to meet by nature!", it contrasts the Pig-faced Lady with the unpopular Ferdinand VII of Spain. The Pig-faced Lady wears a transparent veil and plays [...] "Air Swinish Multitude, set to music by Grunt Esq" [...] on a piano.

2500|$|Rocko's Modern Life {{has been}} noted for its racy humor. Adults made up more than one-fifth of the {{audience}} for the show during its run. The series contained numerous adult innuendos, such as Rocko's brief stint as a telephone operator in the episode [...] "Canned": the instructions on <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him</b> helpfully remind all employees to [...] "Be Hot, Be Naughty, and Be Courteous" [...] while he flatly repeats [...] "Oh baby" [...] into the receiver. Joe Murray noted that the season one segment [...] "Leap Frogs" [...] received [...] "some complaints from some parents" [...] due to its sexual humor, leading to Nickelodeon removing the episode from air {{for the remainder of}} the show's run, although it later aired on the cable channel Nicktoons, and was made available on DVD and video streaming sites such as Netflix. In [...] "The Good, the Bad and the Wallaby", Heffer encounters a milking machine and finds pleasure, although only his reactions are shown onscreen. According to writer/director Jeff [...] "Swampy" [...] Marsh, the scene was originally supposed to have hearts appearing in Heffer's eyes at the climactic moment. Although it clearly wasn't going to be included, they described the scene to Nickelodeon censors anyway: [...] "We described the scene, and then waited for the axe to fall, but all they said was 'can you change the hearts to stars?', we said sure, and it went in." [...] The scene, as well as a scene showing Heffer's break-up with the machine, were later removed. They are intact in the Canadian broadcasts of the episode, however. In addition, the uncut version can still be found on the VHS [...] "Rocko's Modern Life: With Friends Like These".|$|E

5000|$|At {{about this}} time, pop videos were {{starting}} to be made more frequently by directors like Russell Mulcahy (Duran Duran), David Mallet (David Bowie), and Brian Grant (Olivia Newton-John). Pope decided to turn his hand to this new form. His first attempts at rock video were shot in Carnaby Street and in Putney Bridge's subterranean tunnels on a non-broadcast format for the single [...] "Cut Out the Real" [...] by Jo Broadbery and the Standouts, {{as well as its}} B-side. After unsuccessfully pitching many videos (and with very little to show as his own work), he was finally engaged to make Soft Cell’s first video for Some Bizzare Records, Non-Stop Exotic Video Show, which was a companion release to their debut album, Non-Stop Erotic Cabaret. The collection was originally issued on VHS, Betamax, and laserdisc in 1982, and re-issued on DVD in 2004. The video for [...] "Bedsitter" [...] had Pope’s trademark individuality, as it featured the band’s singer, Marc Almond, wearing shirts that matched <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him.</b> In many ways, it is considered this video bears all the major hallmarks of a Pope video: individuality, linear progression in terms of story, and a slight psychedelic feel. (Pope has many names for different genres of videos and this type he calls a narrative/atmospheric. He has lectured all over the world on the subject, including at London’s National Film Theatre.) ...|$|R

60|$|At the {{commencement}} of the orgie, little was audible beyond the clash of the wine-cups, the low occasional whispering of the revellers, and the confused voices of the people without, floating through the window from the street. The desperate compact of the guests, now that its execution had actually begun, awed them at first in spite of themselves. At length, {{when there was a}} lull of all sounds--when a temporary calm prevailed over the noises outside--when the wine-cups were emptied, and left for a moment ere they were filled again--Vetranio feebly rose, and, announcing with a mocking smile {{that he was about to}} speak a funeral oration over his friends and himself, pointed to <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> immediately <b>behind</b> <b>him</b> as to an object fitted to awaken the astonishment or the hilarity of his moody guests.|$|R
60|$|One {{evening of}} December {{he was singing}} a little song {{that he said he}} had heard from the green plover of the mountain, about the fair-haired boys that had left Limerick, and that were {{wandering}} and going astray {{in all parts of the}} world. There were a good many people in the room that night, and two or three little lads that had crept in, and sat on the floor near the fire, and were too busy with the roasting of a potato in the ashes or some such thing to take much notice of him; but they remembered long afterwards when his name had gone up, the sound of his voice, and what way he had moved his hand, and the look of him as he sat on the edge of the bed, with his shadow falling on <b>the</b> whitewashed <b>wall</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him,</b> and as he moved going up as high as the thatch. And they knew then that they had looked upon a king of the poets of the Gael, and a maker of the dreams of men.|$|R

The worker pulls Terry into <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> which seals <b>behind</b> <b>him.</b> Upstairs, Al notices a hazy image of the construction worker in her mirror before Glen bursts into her bedroom. Al throws a stereo at the construction worker and he disintegrates into dozens of little demons. Al holds the bedroom door shut while Glen races downstairs to find their father's gun. A demonic version of Terry appears, biting his hand before Al stabs Terry in the eye. Al and Glen hide in a closet, but the construction worker breaks through an interior wall and drags Al away.|$|R

60|$|He was {{standing}} with one arm round her, his disengaged hand was searching impatiently over <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him</b> for the bell, {{and his eyes were}} fixed in anguish and in love unutterable on the peaceful face, hushed in its sad repose so close beneath his own.

6000|$|There WERE {{footsteps}} approaching--cautious footsteps--but not at his door! They were IN THE ROOM--no! in <b>the</b> <b>WALL</b> just <b>behind</b> <b>him!</b> They were descending some staircase at {{the back}} of his bed--he could hear the regular tap of a light slipper from step to step and the rustle of a skirt seemingly in his very ear. They were becoming less and less distinct--they were gone! He sprang to his feet, but almost at the same instant he was conscious of a sudden chill--that seemed to him as physical as it was mental. The room was slowly suffused with a cool sodden breath and the dank odor of rotten leaves. He looked at the candle--its flame was actually deflecting in this mysterious blast. It seemed to come from a recess for hanging clothes topped by a heavy cornice and curtain. He had examined it before, but he drew the curtain once more aside. The cold current certainly seemed to be more perceptible there. He felt the red-clothed backing of the interior, and his hand suddenly grasped a doorknob. It turned, and the whole structure--cornice and curtains--swung inwards towards him with THE DOOR ON WHICH IT WAS HUNG! Behind it was a dark staircase leading from the floor above to some outer door below, whose opening had given ingress to the chill humid current from the ravine. This was the staircase where he had just heard the footsteps--and this was, no doubt, the door through which the mysterious figure had vanished from his room a few hours before! ...|$|R
60|$|Maximus {{had brought}} some seal-fat, or blubber, along with him. A {{portion of this}} he now put into the lamp, and, placing the latter on a snow-shelf {{prepared}} expressly for it, he set it on fire. The flame, although not very steady, was bright enough to illuminate the large igloo, and to throw a strong gleam into the smaller one. Over this lamp Frank placed a small tin kettle, filled with snow, which was speedily converted into water; and while this was being boiled, he assisted Edith in spreading out the bedding. As we have already said, the floor of this snow-house was of the same material as <b>the</b> <b>walls.</b> But one-half of it was raised about a foot above the other half, according to Esquimau rules of architecture. This elevated half was intended for the bed, which consisted of a large deer-skin robe, spread entirely over it, with the soft hair upwards. Another large robe was placed above this for a blanket, and a smaller one either for a pillow or an additional covering if required; but both of these were tossed down in a heap at the present time, to form a luxuriant seat for Frank and Edith. As their legs hung {{over the edge of}} the elevated couch, they were thus seated, as it were, on an ottoman. A mat of interlaced willows covered the floor, and on this sat Maximus, towering in his hairy garments like a huge bear, while his black shadow was cast on <b>the</b> pure white <b>wall</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him.</b> In <b>the</b> midst stood a small table, extemporised by Frank out of a block of snow, and covered with the ample skirt of his leathern topcoat, which the increasing temperature of the air inside the igloo rendered too warm.|$|R
60|$|Heathcliff {{stood near}} the entrance, in his shirt and trousers; with a candle {{dripping}} over his fingers, and his face as white as <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him.</b> The first creak of the oak startled him like an electric shock: the light leaped from his hold to a distance of some feet, and his agitation was so extreme, that he could hardly pick it up.|$|E
60|$|Ere long, however, his {{emotions}} took a sterner and a darker hue. The {{sight of the}} animal wearied him, and he flung it contemptuously aside.

6000|$|By {{the side}} of the road, where the track {{from the top of the}} common crossed it at right angles and ran through a gate past the narrow wood, was a thin mound of turf, six feet by one, with a moorstone to the west, and on it someone had thrown a {{blackthorn}} spray and a handful of bluebells. Ashurst looked, and the poet in him moved. At cross-roads--a suicide's grave! Poor mortals with their superstitions! Whoever lay there, though, had the best of it, no clammy sepulchre among other hideous graves carved with futilities--just a rough stone, the wide sky, and wayside blessings! And, without comment, for he had learned not to be a philosopher in the bosom of his family, he strode away up on to the common, dropped the luncheon basket under a wall, spread a rug for his wife to sit on--she would turn up from her sketching when she was hungry--and took from his pocket Murray's translation of the [...] "Hippolytus." [...] He had soon finished reading of [...] "The Cyprian" [...] and her revenge, and looked at the sky instead. And watching the white clouds so bright against the intense blue, Ashurst, on his silver-wedding day, longed for--he knew not what. Maladjusted to life--man's organism! One's mode of life might be high and scrupulous, but there was always an undercurrent of greediness, a hankering, and sense of waste. Did women have it too? Who could tell? And yet, men who gave vent to their appetites for novelty, their riotous longings for new adventures, new risks, new pleasures, these suffered, no doubt, from the reverse side of starvation, from surfeit. No getting out of it--a maladjusted animal, civilised man! There could be no garden of his choosing, of [...] "the Apple-tree, the singing, and the gold," [...] in the words of that lovely Greek chorus, no achievable elysium in life, or lasting haven of happiness for any man with a sense of beauty--nothing which could compare with the captured loveliness in a work of art, set down for ever, so that to look on it or read was always to have the same precious sense of exaltation and restful inebriety. Life no doubt had moments with that quality of beauty, of unbidden flying rapture, but the trouble was, they lasted no longer than the span of a cloud's flight over the sun; impossible to keep them with you, as Art caught beauty and held it fast. They were fleeting as one of the glimmering or golden visions one had of the soul in nature, glimpses of its remote and brooding spirit. Here, with the sun hot on his face, a cuckoo calling from a thorn tree, and in the air the honey savour of gorse--here among the little fronds of the young fern, the starry blackthorn, while the bright clouds drifted by high above the hills and dreamy valleys here and now was such a glimpse. But in a moment it would pass--as the face of Pan, which looks round the corner of a rock, vanishes at your stare. And suddenly he sat up. Surely there was something familiar about this view, this bit of common, that ribbon of road, <b>the</b> old <b>wall</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him.</b> While they were driving he had not been taking notice--never did; thinking of far things or of nothing--but now he saw! Twenty-six years ago, just at this time of year, from the farmhouse within half a mile of this very spot he had started for that day in Torquay whence it might be said he had never returned. And a sudden ache beset his heart; he had stumbled on just one of those past moments in his life, whose beauty and rapture he had failed to arrest, whose wings had fluttered away into the unknown; he had stumbled on a buried memory, a wild sweet time, swiftly choked and ended. And, turning on his face, he rested his chin on his hands, and stared at the short grass where the little blue milkwort was growing....|$|R
