5|$|In Lithuania, Commonwealth Lithuanian Army {{numbered}} about 15,000, with {{an additional}} Crown detachment of about 3,000. They were commanded by Duke Louis of Württemberg. Württemberg made no plans for the war, and the troops were not readied for action {{by the time the}} war started. <b>The</b> <b>Russian</b> <b>army</b> in that theatre under General Mikhail Krechetnikov was 33,700 strong or 38,000 strong. <b>The</b> <b>Russian</b> <b>army</b> was also divided into four corps: 1st under one of Targowica Confederate leaders, Szymon Kossakowski 7,300 strong, 2nd under General Boris Mellin, 7,000 strong, 3rd under General Yuri Dolgorukov, 15,400 strong, and 4th under General Ivan Fersen, 8,300 strong.|$|E
5|$|Despite his bluster, Kutuzov {{knew from}} dispatches that his army {{had been too}} badly hurt to fight a {{continuing}} action the following day. He {{knew exactly what he}} was doing: by fighting the pitched battle, he could now retreat with <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> <b>army</b> still intact, lead its recovery, and force the weakened French forces to move even further from their bases of supply. The dénouement became a textbook example of what a hold logistics placed upon an army far from its center of supply. On September8, <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> <b>army</b> moved away from the battlefield in twin columns to Semolino, allowing Napoleon to occupy Moscow and await for 5 weeks a Russian surrender that would never come.|$|E

5|$|Napoleon's Imperial Guard, {{the only}} unit on the {{battlefield}} that saw no fighting, was available to swing into action at a moment's notice.

5|$|The Sejm was disbanded on May 29, 1792. On that day, {{soon after}} {{learning}} that <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> <b>army</b> had invaded Poland, the Sejm gave the commander-in-chief position to the king, and voted to end the session.|$|E
5|$|The {{highlight}} of the fighting became the bloody struggle for the large Raevsky redoubt {{near the village of}} Borodino. The French managed to capture this redoubt late into the day, gradually forcing the rest of <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> <b>army</b> to pull back as well. The Russians suffered terrible casualties during the fighting, losing over a third of their army. French losses were also heavy, exacerbating the logistical difficulties that Napoleon encountered in the campaign. The exhaustion of the French forces, and the lack of information on the condition of <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> <b>army,</b> persuaded Napoleon to remain on the battlefield with his army instead of ordering the kind of vigorous pursuit reminiscent of previous campaigns.|$|E

5|$|By 1916, most of Western Armenia was {{occupied}} by the Russian Empire {{as part of the}} Caucasian Campaign of World War I. In parts of the occupied areas, especially around Van, an Armenian autonomy was briefly set up. <b>The</b> <b>Russian</b> <b>army</b> left the region due to the Revolution of 1917. The Ottoman Empire quickly regained the territories from the small number of irregular Armenian units.

5|$|His dispositions for {{the battle}} are {{described}} as a clear mistake leaving the right far too strong and the left much too weak. Only the fact that Bagration and Barclay were to cooperate fully saved <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> <b>army</b> and did much to mitigate the bad positioning. Nothing would be more damning than 300 artillery pieces standing silent on the Russian right.|$|E
5|$|His {{opportunity}} came on 16 September 1915, when he {{was accepted}} by <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> <b>Army</b> as a volunteer.

With his training complete in December, he joined the 2nd Caucasus Frontier Regiment of the Russian Expeditionary Corps, which was sent to dislodge the Ottoman Turks in Persia.

5|$|However, in a {{long term}} war of attrition, the battle was just one more source of losses to the French when they were losing two men to one.

5|$|Towards 15:00, {{after hours}} of resistance, <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> <b>army</b> was in dire straits, but the French forces were {{exhausted}} and had neither the necessary stamina nor the necessary will to carry out another assault. At this crucial juncture, Murat's chief of staff, General Augustin Daniel Belliard rode straight to the Emperor's Headquarters and, according to General Ségur who wrote {{an account of the}} campaign, told him that the Russian line had been breached, that the road to Mozhaysk, behind the Russian line, was visible through the gaping hole the French attack had pierced, that an enormous crowd of runaways and vehicles were hastily retreating, and that a final push would be enough to decide the fate of <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> <b>army</b> and of the war.

5|$|By {{the summer}} of 1633, the relief force, led {{personally}} by the king and numbering about 25,000 (20,000 in the Polish-Lithuanian army, according to Jasienica), arrived near Smolensk; they reached Orsha on 17 August 1633.

Only when Cossack reinforcements, led by Timofiy Orendarenko and numbering between 10,000 and 20,000, arrived on 17 September would the Commonwealth army gain numerical superiority. The Cossacks under Orendarenko and Marcin Kazanowski would raid the Russian rear lines, freeing the Polish-Lithuanian units under Radziwiłł and Gosiewski to join the effort to break the siege.|$|E

During this time, Novikov was noted for his skill in command and for his innovation, particularly the then unknown use of radio to coordinate bomber flights. In July 1941, Novikov expanded his command from Leningrad to include air forces of the Northern Front, Northwestern Front and the Baltic Fleet, and as the Germans approached Leningrad, Novikov and his forces flew 16,567 sorties.|$|E
5|$|Former Polish {{estimates}} {{of the size of}} the Russian forces varied from 25,000 through 30,000 to 34,500, with 160 artillery pieces.

Compared to former Russian armies, Shein's army was significantly modernised. Dissatisfied with their traditional formations of musket-equipped infantry (the streltsy), the Russians looked to foreign officers to update the equipment and training of their troops based on the Western European model of regulars, dragoons, and reiters. Eight such regiments, totaling 14,000 to 17,000 men, comprised part of Shein's army.|$|E
