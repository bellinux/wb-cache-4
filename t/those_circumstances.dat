5|$|In case {{of death}} or {{resignation}} {{submitted to the}} President of the Constitutional Court and communicated to the Speaker of the parliament, or in cases when the Constitutional Court decides to terminate the presidential term through impeachment, the Speaker of the parliament becomes acting president. In <b>those</b> <b>circumstances,</b> new legislation is countersigned by the prime minister instead {{of the president and}} a new presidential election must be held within 60 days. This situation occurred after the death of Franjo Tuđman on 10 December 1999, when Vlatko Pavletić became the acting president. After the parliamentary elections of 2000, the role was transferred to Zlatko Tomčić, who filled the office until Stjepan Mesić was elected President of Croatia in 2000.|$|E
5|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 14 September, Hitler and his command held a conference at the Reich Chancellery in Berlin to discuss the future direction of the war. Göring was not present; he was inspecting Luftwaffe units in Belgium. Erhard Milch replaced him. Hitler praised the attacks which had caused heavy damage to the RAF and London. He blamed the failure to achieve more decisive results on the weather. Nevertheless, {{it was clear to}} Hitler that victory had still not been attained by the Luftwaffe. Under <b>those</b> <b>circumstances,</b> Operation Sea Lion could not take place. Großadmiral Erich Raeder, commander-in-chief of the Kriegsmarine, agreed. He argued that Sea Lion should only be carried out as a last resort regardless of gaining air superiority.|$|E
5|$|Samaras {{had been}} widely criticised, and even booed, by City fans at {{times during the}} {{previous}} season and Eriksson said that he hoped it would not happen again and that he appreciated why Samaras could have {{found it hard to}} play under <b>those</b> <b>circumstances.</b> Samaras was behind the likes of Valeri Bojinov and Rolando Bianchi in the pecking order and was included in the squad for the first time only on 25 September, when he was selected for a League Cup match against Norwich City. He started the match and scored a last-minute winner to put Manchester City into the quarter-final.|$|E
50|$|Despite <b>those</b> trying <b>circumstances,</b> Hong {{continued}} to teach his t'ai chi ch'uan. Slowly, he gathered {{a core group}} of dedicated students to experiment and test his understanding of Chen Style. In his spare time, he would write down his thoughts on this ancient art. His single minded devotion to the practice helped him to persevere under <b>those</b> trying <b>circumstances.</b>|$|R

5|$|Also in 2003, {{courts in}} the Netherlands {{prevented}} the distribution of a Dutch translation of Tanya Grotter and the Magical Double Bass, the first of Dmitri Yemets' popular Russian series about a female apprentice wizard. Rowling and her publishers sued, arguing that the Grotter books violate copyright law. Yemets and his original Moscow-based publishers, Eksmo, argued that the books constitute a parody, permitted under copyright. The Dutch courts ruled that the books did not constitute parody and thus {{were not allowed to}} be sold in the Netherlands. Later that year, as the Dutch translation Tanja Grotter en de magische contrabas was still legal in Belgium, the Flemish publishers Roularta Books decided to print 1,000 copies (and no more) in order to let people decide whether it was plagiarism, hoping that under <b>those</b> <b>circumstances</b> Rowling and her publishers would not sue. Rowling did not sue, but as {{there was a lot of}} interest in the book (Dutch people could buy the book by postal order from another Flemish publisher, Boekhandel VanIn) it was soon sold out. The books continue to be published in Russia and have spawned several sequels.|$|E
5|$|Boston College (ACC: 3–3) {{could travel}} to the ACC Championship Game if they won out by beating both Wake Forest and Maryland. Boston College {{eventually}} did just that, and lost to Virginia Tech in the 2008 ACC Championship Game. Florida State (ACC: 4–3) would have won the Atlantic Division if they beat Maryland, Maryland beat Boston College, and Boston College beat Wake Forest. Under <b>those</b> <b>circumstances,</b> Florida State would have finished with a 5–3record, tied with Maryland. Florida State would win the tiebreaker because they had defeated Maryland head-to-head. As it happened, Maryland lost to Boston College, which relegated Florida State to a second-place finish in the division. Wake Forest (ACC: 4–3) would have won the division if they won their last game against Boston College, and both Florida State and Boston College beat Maryland. In that case, Florida State and Wake Forest would have had identical conference records (ACC: 5–3), and Wake Forest would have won the tiebreaker because they defeated Florida State earlier in the season.|$|E
5|$|The Croatian parliament's {{powers are}} defined by the Constitution of Croatia. These include: {{defining}} economic, legal and political relations in the Republic of Croatia; preservation of Croatia's natural and cultural heritage and its utilisation; and forming alliances with other states. The parliament {{has the right to}} deploy Croatian armed forces abroad. It may also restrict constitutional rights and liberties in wartime or in cases of imminent war or following natural disasters, although that constitutional provision is limited to specific rights—right to life, prohibition of torture, cruel or denigrating conduct or punishment, upholding of habeas corpus and freedoms of thought, conscience and religious views. In addition, in <b>those</b> <b>circumstances</b> parliamentary members' terms may be extended. (As these rights {{are defined by}} the constitution, the decision would require a two-thirds majority. Since Croatia never declared a state of war during the breakup of Yugoslavia, this option has not been exercised in practice.) The parliament reserves the right to amend the borders of Croatia. The parliament decides on constitutional amendments, enacts legislation, passes the state budget, declares war and decides on the cessation of hostilities, adopts declarations of policy of the parliament, adopts national defence strategy, representing a long-term defence resource planning document, and national defence strategy, which defines bases for establishment and implementation of institutions, measures and activities in response to general security issues and specific challenges and threats to Croatia, implements civil supervision of the armed forces and security services, calls referenda, performs elections and appointments conforming to the constitution and applicable legislation, supervises operations of the government (headed by the Prime Minister of Croatia) and other civil services responsible to the parliament, grants amnesty for criminal offences and performs various other duties defined by the constitution. Becoming the Prime Minister of Croatia requires majority support in the parliament.|$|E

25|$|Los Angeles {{bookseller}} Jake Zeitlin {{claimed in}} 1980 that many clubs, {{such as his}} city's Zamorano Club, an organization of bibliophiles, used a refusal to admit Communists as a pretext for excluding Jews; {{he said he was}} denied admission for more than forty years under <b>those</b> <b>circumstances.</b>|$|E
25|$|Ron Lieberman {{returned}} to the couple's apartment after midnight that night and noticed Philip was not there.

25|$|On May 22, 2007, the Louisiana Supreme Court {{held that}} it is {{constitutional}} to impose {{the death penalty for}} rape if the victim is a child. Ruling on an appeal brought in the case of defendant Patrick Kennedy, Justice Jeffrey Victory wrote for the court that the Louisiana law allowing the imposition of the death penalty under <b>those</b> <b>circumstances</b> was consistent with Coker because an aggravating circumstance, the age of the victim, justified the death penalty.|$|E
25|$|In prison, Bunker {{continued}} to write. He finally {{had his first}} novel No Beast So Fierce published in 1973, to which Dustin Hoffman purchased the film rights. Bunker was paroled in 1975, having spent eighteen {{years of his life}} in various institutions. While he was still tempted by crime, he now found himself earning a living from writing and acting. He felt that his criminal career had been forced by circumstances; now that <b>those</b> <b>circumstances</b> had changed, he could stop being a criminal.|$|E
25|$|Hitler's 56th {{birthday}} in 1945 {{was a private}} celebration held in the bunker under the Reich Chancellery in Berlin as the Red Army battled to take the city; even under <b>those</b> <b>circumstances,</b> Hitler would frequently spend hours {{in the basement of}} the Chancellery looking at the scale model of the proposed rebuilding of Linz, which centered on the cultural district around the Fŭhrermuseum. Nine days after his birthday, Hitler married Eva Braun, and they committed suicide together the next day.|$|E

50|$|Precise descriptions, both {{of court}} uniform and of court dress, were {{laid down in}} an {{official}} publication called Dress Worn at Court (viewable online) which was published by the Lord Chamberlain's Office.

25|$|He was {{minister}} of justice and ecclesiastical affairs in the cabinet of President Miguel Barragán from 18 March 1835 to 26 February 1836. Barragán had become interim president {{in the absence of}} Antonio López de Santa Anna, who was fighting rebels in Zacatecas. Barragán, however, died of typhus on 1 March 1836, just after resigning office on 27 February due to ill health, with Santa Anna again absent from the capital (this time fighting rebels in Texas). Under <b>those</b> <b>circumstances,</b> the Chamber of Deputies on 27 February 1836 named Corro interim president. He formally took office on 2 March.|$|E
25|$|The {{court also}} {{considered}} what constitutes constructive dismissal: {{that is to}} say, broadly speaking, resignation due to intolerable conditions at work. It found that, although certain employees are not recognised as such {{for the purposes of}} the LRA, the constitutional right to fair labour practices is nevertheless applicable to them, and that the common-law contract of employment now includes protection against constructive dismissal. The employee had a contractual right not to be dismissed. It was also held that, for a successful claim based on constructive dismissal, the employer must not only be responsible for the circumstances which induce the employee to resign; it must also be to blame for <b>those</b> <b>circumstances.</b>|$|E
25|$|They {{also argued}} that there indeed is a {{difference}} between a) and b): Case a) is the ordinary case of length contraction, based on the concept of the rod's rest length l0 in S0, which always stays the same as long as the rod can be seen as rigid. Under <b>those</b> <b>circumstances,</b> the rod is contracted in S. But the distance cannot be seen as rigid in case b) because it is increasing due to unequal accelerations in S0, and the rockets would have to exchange information with each other and adjust their velocities in order to compensate for this – all of those complications don't arise in case a).|$|E

25|$|Balancing Treatment vs. Research Objectives. Ethicists {{have also}} raised {{concerns}} {{on the use}} of placebos in <b>those</b> <b>circumstances</b> in which a standard treatment exists unless there are genuine doubts of the effectivity of such standard treatment. If standard treatments exist for the disease being studied in clinical trials, a standard treatment is always used in place of a placebo for serious diseases. In research experimental studies, the method of establishing a proper control group to eliminate the placebo effect has also been difficult, particularly for surgical and therapy interventions that are not pharmaceutical in nature. Notably, there has been much debate of whether to use a placebo pill or conduct a sham procedure as a control.|$|E
25|$|If {{we accept}} {{the fact that they were}} above the Second Step, they would have seemed to be {{incredibly}} close to the summit of Everest and I think at that stage something takes hold of most climbers...

I certainly would love to think that they actually reached the summit of Everest. I think it is a lovely thought and I think it is something, you know, gut emotion, yes I would love them to have got there. Whether they did or not, I think that is something one just cannot know.|$|E
25|$|In zero field NMR all {{magnetic}} fields are shielded such that {{magnetic fields}} below 1nT (nanotesla) are achieved {{and the nuclear}} precession frequencies of all nuclei are close to zero and indistinguishable. Under <b>those</b> <b>circumstances</b> the observed spectra are no-longer dictated by chemical shifts but primarily by J-coupling interactions which are independent of the external magnetic field. Since inductive detection schemes are not sensitive at very low frequencies, {{on the order of}} the J-couplings (typically between 0 and 1000Hz), alternative detection schemes are used. Specifically, sensitive magnetometers turn out to be good detectors for zero field NMR. A zero magnetic field environment does not provide any polarization hence it is the combination of zero field NMR with hyperpolarization schemes that makes zero field NMR attractive.|$|E
