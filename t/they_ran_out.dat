5|$|During {{the last}} days of July, the 24th Infantry {{generally}} tried to hold positions during the day, and then withdrew at night. Their performance was mixed; during the first few North Korean attacks, most units held positions until <b>they</b> <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> of ammunition. Higher officers attempted to move the units back in position but were unsuccessful in the face of mounting North Korean resistance. Notably, L Company fought until surrounded by North Korean attackers; the rest of the regiment was able to drive them off.|$|E

5|$|Gasketball is an action, sports {{video game}} for the iPad by Mikengreg, an {{independent}} development team of Michael Boxleiter and Greg Wohlwend. Players flick basketballs through 2D physics puzzles into the hoop in single-player, local multiplayer, and asynchronous HORSE-style online multiplayer modes. The game is free-to-play with in-app purchases. Development began in mid 2011 following Mikengreg's successful Solipskier. They were able to live from the earnings for Gasketball two year development at their previous salary, which afforded them the stability to try new avenues and reject prototypes, though they worked 100-hour weeks. Towards {{the end of their}} development, <b>they</b> <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> of money and lived on the couches of friends. It was released on August 9, 2012, and the game did not reach their desired conversion rate at the time of launch.|$|E
5|$|The Norman castle's defences {{were put}} to the test {{for the first time in}} the Rebellion of 1088, when Norman barons allied with Robert Curthose, Duke of Normandy rebelled against the new king William Rufus. The barons, who were also {{supported}} by William the Conqueror's half-brothers Robert of Mortain and Bishop Odo of Bayeux, defended Pevensey Castle against an army led personally by William Rufus. Although the castle's defences were strong enough to resist assaults from land and sea, its defenders were forced to surrender when <b>they</b> <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> of food after six weeks. Robert was allowed to keep the castle but his son William, Count of Mortain was stripped of it, along with his other English estates, after rebelling against Henry I in the early 12th century.|$|E
5|$|After the {{engagement}} at Le Cornet Malo, C Company and HQ Company of the 2nd Royal Norfolks had fallen {{back to their}} headquarters at Cornet Farm, just outside Le Paradis. The company commanders had been informed by radio that their units were isolated and would receive no assistance. They therefore dug in around the farmhouse, which lay on the Rue du Paradis, {{the boundary between the}} Royal Norfolk Regiment and the adjacent 1st Royal Scots. The Norfolks' last contact with Brigade Headquarters at L'Epinette was at 11:30 but despite no support and heavy opposition, the defenders held out against the 14th Company, 1st Battalion of the 2nd SS Infantry Regiment until 17:15, when <b>they</b> <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> of ammunition. During the battle the Germans attacked the farmhouse with mortars, tanks and artillery shelling, which destroyed the building and forced the defenders to relocate to a cowshed. SS-Standartenführer Hans Friedemann Götze, commander of the Totenkopf Division's third regiment, was killed in the fighting.|$|E

5|$|For the 1888 season, Wilson {{was made}} {{captain of the}} Launceston Grammar School {{football}} team. He also became a leading player for the Launceston Football Club. Wilson kicked two of his team's three goals in a school match against Horton College, and was named in Launceston's best players in several games, including matches against South Launceston and City that counted towards the premiership. In a match that was to decide the premiership, against South Launceston, Wilson put in a creditable performance. The game ended in a draw, which left the teams even on the ladder, and a subsequent game was scheduled for two weeks later. In that match, Wilson kicked one of Launceston's five goals as <b>they</b> <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> two-goal victors to win their first Northern Tasmanian Football Association (NTFA) premiership. He was named in Launceston's best players for the match by the Launceston Examiner. For the following cricket season, Wilson moved to play with St. Leonards.|$|E
5|$|Gasketball was {{developed}} and produced by Mikengreg, an Iowa-based two-man team: Michael Boxleiter and Greg Wohlwend. After releasing their first game, the sport-inspired Solipskier for iPhone and iPad, Boxleiter and Wohlwend lived off the profits for two years while working on Gasketball, paying themselves their same salaries from their Adobe Flash development days but having the security to try new ideas. Wohlwend made somewhat more income due to other collaborations, such as Puzzlejuice with Asher Vollmer, but shared his income with Boxleiter. Development began in mid 2011. Even though Solipskier was successful, the duo {{did not have a}} following comparable to indie developers like Team Meat and thus did not feel pressured to meet high expectations. Instead, their pressure was internal. Wohlwend said he worked 100-hour weeks with no weekends or vacations while living on the Solipskier funds. When <b>they</b> <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> of money, Boxleiter borrowed money from his parents, and eventually they both went homeless, living on the couches of friends.|$|E
5|$|The 4th and 55th Fighter Regiments {{had most}} of the MiG-3s {{assigned}} to the Odessa Military District and their experiences {{on the first day}} of the war may be taken as typical. The 4th, an experienced unit, shot down a Romanian Bristol Blenheim reconnaissance bomber, confirmed by postwar research, and lost one aircraft which crashed into an obstacle on takeoff. The 55th was much less experienced with the MiG-3 and claimed three aircraft shot down, although recent research confirms only one German Henschel Hs 126 was 40% damaged, and suffered three pilots killed and nine aircraft lost. The most unusual case was the pair of MiG-3s dispatched from the 55th on a reconnaissance mission to Ploieşti that failed to properly calculate their fuel consumption and both were forced to land when <b>they</b> <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> of fuel.|$|E

It was against their future final opponents, Atlético de Kolkata, at the Salt Lake Stadium. Iain Hume scored the {{equalizer}} for the Blasters after Baljit Sahni gave the Kolkata side the lead. In the next game, four days later, the Blasters recorded their first ever victory against Pune City at the Balewadi Sports Complex.

25|$|Curtis {{concentrated}} {{his army}} around the Confederate positions near Elkhorn Tavern during the night; at dawn he started an artillery bombardment which lasted two hours.

Van Dorn ordered his army to retreat towards the east before moving southwards. Neither Van Dorn nor Price remained behind to supervise the retreat, so the units left the field chaotically, with the artillery batteries leaving as <b>they</b> <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> of ammunition and the infantry and cavalry regiments following.|$|E
