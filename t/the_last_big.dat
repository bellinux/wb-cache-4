5|$|Brown's {{second year}} as coach {{was the best}} in Stanford rugby history: the team was undefeated {{entering}} the Big Game at California, who was also undefeated. A record crowd of 26,000 turned out to see Stanford defeat the Bears, 26–8. This would be <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>Big</b> Game for several years as California returned to football for the 1915 season. Despite Stanford's success in rugby, the previous year's humiliating defeats to the All Blacks and the switch by rivals USC and California to football intensified the sentiment for Stanford to switch back as well.|$|E
5|$|The first {{usage of}} the M-66 {{designation}} dates back to around July 1, 1919 {{with the rest of}} the original state highway system. At the time, the highway only extended between Lowell and Lakeview, a route now covered by M-91. The highway has been lengthened in a series of extensions north and south starting in 1925. A rerouting in 1944–45 removed M-66 from its original 1919 routing to replace another highway south of Six Lakes, the change that spawned M-91. <b>The</b> <b>last</b> <b>big</b> extension in 1965 resulted in the modern trans-peninsular highway route. The last modifications were shorter reroutings in the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|On October 14 {{before the}} Week6 trade deadline, Roy Williams {{was traded to}} the Dallas Cowboys for a first, a 3rd and a 7th-round pick in the 2009 NFL Draft, making Johnson the Lions' {{starting}} wide receiver and <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>big</b> threat on the offense. In his first game without Roy Williams alongside him in the week7 game against the Houston Texans, Johnson caught only two passes, totaling 154yards receiving; the first pass did not come until quarterback Dan Orlovsky threw a pass up for grabs {{at the end of the}} first half which Johnson caught for 58yards and the second pass came on a 96-yard touchdown catch-and-run. With Williams gone and starting quarterback Jon Kitna lost to injury for the season, the Texans defense had little to do to stop the Lions' offense but shut down Johnson, winning the game 28–21.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>last</b> <b>big</b> {{match of}} the season was a one-off at Lord's between England and Dominions, a {{combined}} team of players from the British Commonwealth. Miller managed 26 in the Dominions' first innings of 307, {{before coming to the}} crease at 2/60 in the second innings with England still leading by 80 runs. Miller settled in quickly, hitting his second ball through the covers for four and moved to 49 in 49 minutes. He brought up his half-century by lifting Hollies straight back into the crowd. Three balls later, he hit another ball to the same point. At stumps, he was 61 not out with Dominions at 3/145. The next morning, his partner Martin Donnelly was dismissed and replaced by Dominions captain Learie Constantine. Miller then began his attack, hitting the dual leg spin pairing of Hollies and Wright to all parts of the ground. At one point, all the fielders except for the wicketkeeper and the bowler were on the fence.|$|E
