5000|$|A shot {{in which}} the camera moves {{alongside}} or parallel to its subject while filming. Traditionally <b>tracking</b> <b>shots</b> are filmed while the camera is mounted on a track dolly and rolled on dedicated tracks comparable to railroad tracks, In recent years, however, parallel camera moves performed with a Steadicam, gimbal, etc. may also be called a <b>tracking</b> <b>shot.</b> <b>Tracking</b> <b>shots</b> often [...] "follow" [...] a subject while it is in motion: for instance, a person walking on a sidewalk seen {{from the perspective of}} somebody walking on a parallel path several feet away. Shots taken from moving vehicles that run parallel to another moving object are also referred to as <b>tracking</b> or traveling <b>shots.</b> A <b>tracking</b> <b>shot</b> may also be curved, moving around its subject in a semi-circular rotation.|$|R

50|$|The {{technique}} {{is often used}} to follow a subject that would otherwise leave the frame (ergo, it is often called a following shot), such as an actor or vehicle in motion. In this spirit, any conveyance, including via a motorized vehicle, like a car, may also be used to create a <b>tracking</b> <b>shot.</b> A handheld or Steadicam mounted camera following a similar trajectory is called a <b>tracking</b> <b>shot</b> as well. While the core idea is that the camera moves parallel to its subject, a <b>tracking</b> <b>shot</b> may move in a semi-circular fashion, rotating around its subject while remaining equidistant.|$|R
40|$|Figure 1 : Our system enables {{creating}} realistic <b>tracking</b> <b>shots</b> from shot video sequences, {{with little}} user input. The resulting <b>tracking</b> <b>shot</b> depicts object motion in a still image by adaptively blurring the background according to both foreground motion and scene structure in 3 D. Panning and <b>tracking</b> <b>shots</b> are popular photography techniques {{in which the}} camera tracks a moving object and keeps {{it at the same}} position, resulting in an image where the moving foreground is sharp but the background is blurred accordingly, creating an artistic illustration of the foreground motion. Such shots however are hard to capture even for professionals, especially when the foreground motion is complex (e. g., non-linear motion trajectories). In this work we propose a system to generate realistic, 3 D-aware <b>tracking</b> <b>shots</b> from consumer videos. We show how computer vi-sion techniques such as segmentation and structure-from-motion can be used to lower the barrier and help novice users create high quality <b>tracking</b> <b>shots</b> that are physically plausible. We also intro-duce a pseudo 3 D approach for relative depth estimation to avoid expensive 3 D reconstruction for improved robustness and a wider application range. We validate our system through extensive quan-titative and qualitative evaluations...|$|R
