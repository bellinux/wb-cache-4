5|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> {{from the}} French Fleet had been neutralised, Cunningham was still aware of <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> {{posed by the}} Italian Fleet to British North African operations, based in Egypt. Although the Royal Navy had won in several actions in the Mediterranean, {{considerably}} upsetting the balance of power, the Italians who were following the theory of a fleet in being had left their ships in harbour. This made <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> of a sortie against the British Fleet a serious problem. At the time the harbour at Taranto contained six battleships (five of them battle-worthy), seven heavy cruisers, two light cruisers, and eight destroyers. The Admiralty, concerned {{with the potential for}} an attack, had drawn up Operation Judgement; a surprise attack on Taranto Harbour. To carry out the attack, the Admiralty sent the new aircraft carrier , commanded by Lumley Lyster, to join HMS Eagle in Cunningham's fleet.|$|E

5|$|Japan's {{rapid advance}} south had been unexpected, and the {{perceived}} threat of invasion led to a major expansion of the Australian military. By mid-1942 the Army had a strength of ten infantry divisions, three armoured divisions {{and hundreds of other}} units. Thousands of Australians who were ineligible for service in the military responded to <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> of attack by joining auxiliary organisations such as the Volunteer Defence Corps and Volunteer Air Observers Corps, which were modelled on the British Home Guard and Royal Observer Corps respectively. However, Australia's population and industrial base were not sufficient to maintain these forces once <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> of invasion had passed, and the Army was progressively reduced in size from 1943.|$|E

5|$|On 22 June, Germany {{launched}} a massive attack upon the Soviet Union; this attack all but removed <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> of a German {{invasion of the}} United Kingdom. However, the British still had to consider <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> of a German invasion due {{the possibility that the}} Soviet Union could collapse under the German onslaught and the ease in which Germany could transfer troops back to the west. In late 1941, the arrival of autumn and winter weather meant that <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> of invasion subsided. This, coupled with the production of new equipment for the British army, allowed the War Office to begin steps to better balance the army due to the large number of infantry units formed during the preceding year and a half. As part of this reform, the County Divisions were disbanded.|$|E
