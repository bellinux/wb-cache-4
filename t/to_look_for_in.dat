25|$|There {{have been}} various {{studies on the}} {{connection}} between motivation and games. One particular study was on Taiwanese adolescents and their drive of addiction to games. Two studies {{by the same people}} were conducted. The first study revealed that addicted players showed higher intrinsic than extrinsic motivation and more intrinsic motivation than the non-addicted players. It can then be said that addicted players, according to the studies findings, are more internally motivated to play games. They enjoy the reward of playing. There are studies that also show that motivation gives these players more <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>in</b> the future such as long-lasting experience that they may keep later on in life.|$|E

A JNA soldier who fought at Vukovar told the Serbian newspaper Dnevni Telegraf that [...] "the Chetnik [...] behaved like professional plunderers, {{they knew what}} <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>in</b> the houses they looted." [...] The JNA also participated in the looting; an official in the Serbian Ministry of Defence commented: [...] "Tell me of even one reservist, especially if he is an officer, who {{has spent more than}} a month at the front and has not brought back a fine car filled with everything that would fit inside the car." [...] More than 8,000 works of art were looted during the battle, including the contents of the municipal museum, Eltz Castle, which was bombed and destroyed during the siege. Serbia returned 2,000 pieces of looted art in December 2001.|$|E

2500|$|Midwifery-led {{continuity}} of care is where one or more midwives have the primary responsibility for the {{continuity of}} care for childbearing women, with a multidisciplinary network of consultation and referral with other health care providers. This is different from [...] "medical-led care" [...] where an obstetrician or family physician is primarily responsible. In [...] "shared-care" [...] models, responsibility may be shared between a midwife, an obstetrician and/or a family physician. The midwife plays a very unique role is part of very intimate situations with the mother. For this reason, many say {{that the most important}} thing <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>in</b> a midwife is comfortability with them, as one will go to them with every question or problem.|$|E
2500|$|Powell {{described}} {{joining the}} Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) during college {{as one of}} the happiest experiences of his life; discovering something he loved and could do well, he felt he had [...] "found himself." [...] According to Powell: It was only once I was in college, about six months into college when I found something that I liked, and that was ROTC, Reserve Officer Training Corps in the military. And I not only liked it, but I was pretty good at it. That's what you really have <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>in</b> life, something that you like, and something that you think you're pretty good at. And if you can put those two things together, then you're on the right track, and just drive on. Cadet Powell joined the Pershing Rifles, the ROTC fraternal organization and drill team begun by General John Pershing. Even after he had become a general, Powell kept on his desk a pen set he had won for a drill team competition.|$|E
2500|$|In 1905, Jones's {{remains were}} {{identified}} by U.S. Ambassador to France Gen. Horace Porter, who had searched for six years {{to track down the}} body using faulty copies of Jones's burial record. Thanks to the kind donation of a French admirer, Pierrot Francois Simmoneau, who had donated over 460 francs, Jones's body was preserved in alcohol and interred in a lead coffin [...] "in the event that should the United States decide to claim his remains, they might more easily be identified." [...] Porter knew what <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>in</b> his search. With the aid of an old map of Paris, Porter's team, which included anthropologist Louis Capitan, identified the site of the former St. Louis Cemetery for Alien Protestants. Sounding probes were used to search for lead coffins and five coffins were ultimately exhumed. The third, unearthed on April 7, 1905, was later identified by a meticulous post-mortem examination by Doctors Capitan and Georges Papillault as being that of Jones. The autopsy confirmed the original listing of cause of death. The face was later compared to a bust by Jean-Antoine Houdon.|$|E

2500|$|It is a {{complicated}} task for admissions staff at selective colleges to analyze and process thousands of applications with a [...] "huge mail deluge" [...] since there are often six pieces of mail for each applicant, including transcripts, letters of recommendation, and the application itself. College admissions personnel spend less time on average reading each particular application; in 2009, the average admissions officer was responsible for analyzing 514 applications, and the trend was {{in the direction of}} officers having to read more and more applications. A typical college application receives only about 25 minutes of reading time, including three to five minutes for the personal essay if it is read. Advisors suggest that understanding some of the criteria can help an applicant apply to colleges with greater success. Some colleges extract information from the federal FAFSA financial aid form, including names of other schools the applicant is applying to. Counselors urge students and parents to understand what types of things colleges tend <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>in</b> applications, and plan accordingly. A key attribute admissions evaluators look for, according to Mamlet and Vandevelde, is authenticity—a real person who comes through the application, not a packaged artificial entity or distortion crafted to impress an admissions officer. An admissions officer at Vanderbilt University wrote about how their office evaluates applicants: [...] "It's really about, 'What did I take advantage of in the environment I was given.'" [...] Several reports suggested that colleges were not looking for the [...] "well-rounded kid" [...] but rather a [...] "well-rounded class": ...|$|E
