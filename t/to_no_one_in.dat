The second essay, [...] "Response Cries", considers the use of utterances and their social implications in different social contexts. Specifically, Goffman discusses [...] "self-talk" [...] (talking <b>to</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> particular) {{and its role in}} social situations. Next, in [...] "Footing", Goffman addresses the way that footing, or alignment, can shift during a conversation. The fourth essay, [...] "The Lecture", originally an oral presentation, describes different types and methods of lecture. Lastly, in [...] "Radio Talk", Goffman describes the types and forms of talk used in radio programming and the effect they have on listeners.|$|E
500|$|Harvey Kurtzman {{founded the}} satirical Mad {{magazine}} in 1952; an early fan was onetime cartoonist Hugh Hefner, {{who founded the}} men's magazine Playboy in 1953. Hefner offered Kurtzman an opportunity to conceive a new humor magazine for his enterprise, which the cartoonist accepted when he left Mad in 1956 in an ownership dispute. Kurtzman took most of the Mad artists with him, including frequent collaborator Will Elder, to create the adult-oriented humor magazine Trump. Although it sold well, Hefner ran into financial problems in 1957 and halted Trump after two issues. He provided office space for the artists, from which they self-published the satirical magazine Humbug in 1957–58. It failed to gain a significant following, and a dejected Kurtzman began pitching feature proposals to Playboy, {{all of which were}} rejected. However, he received a note from Hefner: [...] "I bow <b>to</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> my appreciation for H.Kurtzman." [...] Hefner's praise encouraged Kurtzman to meet with publisher Ian Ballantine and create Harvey Kurtzman's Jungle Book (1959). This introduced the innocent and idealistic Goodman Beaver, a male character who continued to appear—with artwork by Elder—in Kurtzman's Help! (1960).|$|E

By early adulthood, O'Brien had been arrested in almost every major city in the United States [...] and was considered [...] "second <b>to</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> his business".

The [...] "they-self" [...] talks {{about it in a}} fugitive manner, passes it off as something that occurs at some time but is not yet [...] "present-at-hand" [...] as an actuality, and hides its character as one's ownmost possibility, presenting it as belonging <b>to</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> particular. It becomes devalued — redefined as a neutral and mundane aspect of existence that merits no authentic consideration. [...] "One dies" [...] is interpreted as a fact, and comes to mean [...] "nobody dies".|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to authorizing torture, Stalin also signed 357 lists in 1937 and 1938 authorizing executions of some 40,000 people, and about 90% {{of these are}} confirmed to have been shot. While reviewing one such list, Stalin reportedly muttered <b>to</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> particular: [...] "Who's going to remember all this riff-raff in ten or twenty years time? No one. Who remembers the names now of the boyars Ivan the Terrible got rid of? No one." [...] Stalin's alleged remark may be compared with Hitler's famous admonition to his generals in 1939: [...] "Who, after all, speaks today of the annihilation of the Armenians?" ...|$|E
2500|$|In January 2007, {{during the}} first week of Scooter Libby's trial, it was {{revealed}} in court proceedings that former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer was granted immunity from prosecution by Patrick Fitzgerald in February 2004. Fleischer reportedly acknowledged discussing Valerie Plame with reporters, but promised to cooperate with Fitzgerald's investigation only if granted immunity. When the deal was struck, Fleischer told Fitzgerald that he had discussed Plame with David Gregory of NBC News and John Dickerson of Time in July 2003, days before leaving his job at the White House. Fleischer testified that he first learned about Plame and her CIA affiliation during a July 7, 2003, lunch with Libby. Fleischer also testified that four days later, while aboard Air Force One and during a five-day trip to several African nations, he overheard Dan Bartlett reference Plame. According to Fleischer, Bartlett stated <b>to</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> particular [...] "His wife sent him...She works at the CIA." [...] Shortly after overhearing Bartlett, Fleischer proceeded to discuss Plame with Gregory and Dickerson. According to Fleischer, neither Gregory nor Dickerson showed much interest in the information. Dickerson has denied Fleischer's account. Gregory has declined to comment on the matter. With regard to the immunity deal, Fitzgerald told the court [...] "I didn't want to give [...] immunity. I did so reluctantly." [...] Libby's attorney, William Jeffress, sought to learn more about the deal, telling the court [...] "I'm not sure we're getting the full story here." [...] According to Matt Apuzzo of the Associated Press, [...] "Prosecutors normally insist on an informal account of what a witness will say before agreeing to such a deal. It's known in legal circles as a proffer, and Fitzgerald said [...] he never got one from Fleischer." ...|$|E

6000|$|At length, however, {{her father}} began: [...] "We {{wanted you to}} talk over a scheme that these young ones have been concocting.
