30|$|The {{findings}} that mindfulness and acceptance-based <b>treatments</b> <b>for</b> depressed patients improved sleep quality (e.g., Biegel et al. 2009), and that mindfulness and acceptance-based <b>treatments</b> <b>for</b> insomnia alleviated depressive symptoms (e.g., Yook et al. 2008), may help when interpreting the mediation models {{proposed in the}} current study. The former and latter findings may support our results of the mediations in Models 1 and 2, respectively. However, studies that examine the efficacy of mindfulness and acceptance-based <b>treatments</b> <b>for</b> insomnia attenuating depressive symptoms, or mindfulness and acceptance-based <b>treatments</b> <b>for</b> depression improving insomnia, are scant. Therefore, further studies of mindfulness and acceptance-based <b>treatments</b> <b>for</b> insomnia or depression that examine their effects on depressive symptoms and insomnia may help to understand the role of psychological inflexibility in association with depressive symptoms and insomnia symptoms. In addition, studies that examine parallel or sequential mediators using longitudinal designs may help to elucidate their associations.|$|R
