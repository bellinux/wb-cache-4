5|$|Another former Hibernian player, John Hughes, {{was soon}} {{appointed}} {{in place of}} Paatelainen. Hughes, who made high-profile signings such as Anthony Stokes and Liam Miller, led Hibs <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>start</b> to the 2009–10 season. Hibs finished fourth and qualified for the 2010–11 UEFA Europa League. A poor start to the following season, including first round exits in Europe and the League Cup, led to Hughes leaving the club by mutual consent. Hughes was replaced by Colin Calderwood, who was himself sacked on 6 November 2011.|$|E
5|$|Bayern got off <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>start</b> under Ancelotti, {{defeating}} Dortmund 2–0 in the 2016 DFL-Supercup. Despite being {{eliminated in}} the quarter-finals of the Champions League by Real Madrid and the semi-finals of the DFB-Pokal by Borussia Dortmund, {{they managed to}} clinch a fifth consecutive Bundesliga title with three matches remaining following a 6–0 away win over VfL Wolfsburg. Ancelotti was sacked by Bayern on 28 September 2017 and replaced by interim manager Willy Sagnol, following a 3–0 loss to PSG in the 2017–18 Champions League group stage and a slow start to the Bundesliga season that found them in third place.|$|E
5|$|Because California {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, Virginia Tech {{received the}} ball to begin the second half. Virginia Tech's Mike Imoh fielded the ball at the goal line and returned it 40yards. Bryan Randall got off <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>start,</b> completing two passes for 26yards, and Kevin Jones ran the ball another 16yards. After pushing inside the California red zone, however, the California defense stiffened and Tech was prevented from gaining another first down. Kicker Carter Warley attempted his third field goal of the game—this one a 28-yard kick—but as before, the kick was no good.|$|E

The {{following}} three weeks, he scored goals against Rhône-Alpes rivals Grenoble and Saint-Étienne and scored a goal against Nice, converting a penalty in the dying seconds. Lyon won all three matches. As {{a result of}} his early goals, Lyon club president Jean-Michel Aulas quelled the many transfer rumors surrounding Benzema by placing a €100million price tag on the striker. He was also nominated alongside Franck Ribéry to be featured on the French cover of the video game FIFA 09.|$|E
5|$|Miami got off <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>start</b> {{doing just}} that as it raced out to four {{consecutive}} wins to begin the season, including a victory over nationally ranked rival No. 9 Florida State. On October 11, however, Miami traveled to South Bend, Indiana, to face the Notre Dame Fighting Irish and suffered its first loss of the season to the undefeated Irish, who {{would go on to}} be ranked No. 1 in the country. This defeat was followed in succession by two others, but the Hurricanes were able to stop the slide on November 8 with a homecoming win over East Carolina. Miami added two more wins {{before the end of the}} season, and brought the regular season to a close with an overall record of 83.|$|E

Syracuse rallied in the second half, taking its first lead of the game, 40–39, off a Wes Johnson three-pointer. Stevens called timeout and Butler regained the lead on its next possession, {{stopping}} the run. At the 5:32 mark, Syracuse got a rare fast break opportunity that ended with a dunk and 54–50 lead. Stevens again called time out and re-focused the team. Butler responded by holding Syracuse scoreless for the next 5 minutes, taking a 60–54 lead with 0:59 to go. Butler held on to win 63–59, advancing to the Elite Eight {{for the first time}} in school history.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we develop}} {{heuristics}} for finding <b>good</b> <b>starting</b> points when solving large-scale nonlinear constrained optimization problems (COPs). We focus on nonlinear programming (NLP) and mixed-integer NLP (MINLP) problems with nonlinear non-convex objective and constraint functions. By exploiting the highly structured constraints in these problems, we first solve {{one or more}} simplified versions of the original COP, before generalizing the solutions found by interpolation or extrapolation <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>starting</b> point. In our experimental evaluations of 190 NLP (resp., 52 MINLP) benchmark problems, our approach can solve 97. 9 % (resp., 71. 2 %) of the problems using significantly less iterations from our proposed starting points, as compared to 85. 3 % (resp., 46. 2 %) of the problems solvable by the best existing solvers from their default starting points...|$|R
5|$|United {{started the}} first leg the better of the two sides, and {{although}} Inter improved in the second half, neither side {{was able to find}} the net during the match, and United took a 0–0 draw back to Old Trafford. The draw was also United's 20th match since their last defeat in the UEFA Champions League, breaking Ajax's 19-match record that had stood for 13 years. The lack of an away goal at the San Siro meant that United could not afford to concede a goal {{in the event of a}} draw. A fourth-minute headed goal from Nemanja Vidić, however, got the home side off <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>start,</b> and Cristiano Ronaldo doubled United's lead fourminutes into the second half. Shots from both Zlatan Ibrahimović and Adriano hit the frame of the Manchester United goal in either half of the match, but they were unable to find the back of the net, and the 2–0 result sent the English champions through to the next stage of the competition.|$|E
