5|$|Henry Chadwick is {{generally}} {{credited with the}} invention of scorekeeping in baseball. Chadwick was also {{the inventor of the}} modern box score and the writer of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>rule</b> book for the game of baseball. Since baseball statistics were initially a subject of interest to sportswriters, the role of the official scorer in Major League Baseball (MLB) {{in the early days of}} the sport was performed by newspaper writers. A judgment call that is required by the official scorer does not alter the outcome of a game, but these judgments impact the statistical records of the game. As the subjective scoring decisions which are used to calculate baseball statistics began to be used to determine the relative value of baseball players, MLB began to require approval from the league before a writer-scorer could be assigned to produce the scoring report for a game. By the 1970s, writers who were willing to score games for MLB were required to have attended 100 or more games per year in the prior three years and to be chosen by the local chapter chairman of the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA). Qualified candidates for scoring were submitted to the leagues for approval.|$|E

25|$|An {{elementary}} {{cellular automaton}} rule is specified by 8 bits, and all elementary cellular automaton rules {{can be considered}} {{to sit on the}} vertices of the 8-dimensional unit hypercube. This unit hypercube is the cellular automaton rule space. For next-nearest-neighbor cellular automata, a rule is specified by 25=32 bits, and the cellular automaton rule space is a 32-dimensional unit hypercube. A distance between two rules can be defined by the number of steps required to move from one vertex, which represents <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>rule,</b> and another vertex, representing another rule, {{along the edge of the}} hypercube. This rule-to-rule distance is also called the Hamming distance.|$|E

Heraldic bearings are intended for recognition at a distance (in battle), and a contrast of light metal against dark color is desirable.

500|$|The {{original}} {{doctrine of}} privity {{consisted of two}} rules - first, that a third party may not have obligations imposed {{by the terms of}} a contract, and second, that a third party may not benefit from the terms of a contract. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>rule</b> is not something that is contested, while the second was described as [...] "one of the most universally disliked and criticised blots on the legal landscape". The second rule was not originally held to be valid, and in the 17th Century third parties were allowed to enforce terms of a contract that benefited them, as shown in Provender v Wood [...] Hetley 30, where the judgement stated that [...] "the party to whom the benefit of a promise accrews, may bring his action." [...] The first reversal of this was in Bourne v Mason [...] 1 Vent., where the Court of King's Bench found that a third party had no rights to enforce a contract that benefited him. This case was quickly reversed, and decisions immediately after Bourne v Mason took the view that third parties could enforce contracts that benefited them.|$|E
500|$|Burger King's {{creative}} {{control over}} the game impacted its development defined {{as a set of}} rules. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>rule</b> was that there was only one King character. In response, the developers had the idea of the Xbox avatars playing the game and finding the crown to become the King. This idea was rejected by Burger King who said players could not become the King. The developers' next idea was to have one person be the King and the other players lay traps to interfere with his deliveries, but this idea was again rejected by Burger King because the King could not be exposed to any danger. With the usual hazards and competition elements of the video games removed, the developers decided upon a stealth format with no human opponents. In order to better capture the accuracy and authenticity of the King's movements, the King was flown to Britain for motion capture for the game's production. Blitz Games' Edward Linley described Sneak King as the riskiest game concept of the project because it [...] "is the appearance and antics of the King himself that give the game its humor and life; without him, the game simply wouldn't work. Until we had the finished King model and motion capture in the game, we couldn't be certain the concept would gel. Fortunately, the moment he went in, we knew we had created something truly unique." [...] Sneak Kings programming code consists of 60,000 active lines with another 43,000 developer comment lines. The game's instruction manual does not include a list of credits.|$|E

Following the completion of principal photography several more cast members were revealed including Stellan Skarsgård, Anthony Mackie, Idris Elba, and Tom Hiddleston, reprising their roles from previous MCU films. However, Hiddleston's scenes {{did not make the}} theatrical cut of the film, with Whedon saying what was shot [...] "didn't play" [...] and he did not want the film to feel [...] "overstuffed". According to Hiddleston, [...] "In test screenings, audiences had overemphasized Loki's role, so they thought that because I was in it, I was controlling Ultron, and it was actually imbalancing people's expectations." [...] Whedon later explained that Elba and Atwell appear in the film because of exploring the psyches of the Avengers from Scarlet Witch's power. In December 2014, Kim's role was revealed as Dr. Helen Cho. Additional scenes were scheduled to be filmed in January 2015 at Pinewood Studios. In February 2015, Marvel confirmed through promotional material that Serkis portrays Ulysses Klaue in the film. In early April 2015, Linda Cardellini and Julie Delpy were confirmed {{to be part of the}} film's cast.
