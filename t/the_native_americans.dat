5|$|Pontiac's War has {{traditionally}} been portrayed as a defeat for <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans,</b> but scholars now usually {{view it as a}} military stalemate: while <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> had failed to drive away the British, the British were unable to conquer <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans.</b> Negotiation and accommodation, rather than success on the battlefield, ultimately brought an end to the war. <b>The</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> had in fact won a victory of sorts by compelling the British government to abandon Amherst's policies and instead create a relationship with <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> modeled on the Franco-Native alliance.|$|E
5|$|Harrison's troops buried {{their own}} {{dead on the}} site of their camp. They built large fires over the mass grave in an attempt to conceal it from <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans.</b> After Harrison's troops {{departed}} the area, <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> returned to the grave site, digging up many of the corpses in retaliation and scattering the bodies.|$|E
5|$|British troops {{proceeded}} {{to occupy the}} various forts in the Ohio Country and Great Lakes region previously garrisoned by the French. Even before the war officially ended with the Treaty of Paris (1763), the British Crown began to implement changes in order to administer its vastly expanded North American territory. While the French had long cultivated alliances among certain of <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans,</b> the British post-war approach was essentially to treat <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> as a conquered people. Before long, Native Americans who had been allies of the defeated French found themselves increasingly dissatisfied with the British occupation and the new policies imposed by the victors.|$|E

5|$|Parkman also {{believed}} that Pontiac's War had been secretly instigated by French colonists who were stirring up <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> {{in order to make}} trouble for the British. This belief was widely held by British officials at the time, but subsequent historians have found no evidence of official French involvement in the uprising. (The rumor of French instigation arose in part because French war belts from the Seven Years' War were still in circulation in some Native villages.) Rather than the French stirring up <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans,</b> some historians now argue that <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> were trying to stir up the French. Pontiac and other native leaders frequently spoke of the imminent return of French power and the revival of the Franco-Native alliance; Pontiac even flew a French flag in his village. All of this was apparently intended to inspire the French to rejoin the struggle against the British. Although some French colonists and traders supported the uprising, the war was initiated and conducted by Native Americans who had Native—not French—objectives.|$|E
5|$|Spain and the United States both sought allies among <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> of {{the disputed}} territory. In June 1806, Lieutenant Facundo Melgares and 600 men were {{dispatched}} from the Spanish provincial capital of Santa Fe down the Red River and then northward into present-day Nebraska. Although no Spanish {{records of the}} Melgares expedition are known to exist, {{it is believed that}} its purpose was to find and arrest the Lewis and Clark party, and to establish alliances with <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> of the region, including the Pawnees.|$|E
5|$|Adams {{was known}} to <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> as Pahto (with various spellings) and Klickitat. In various tribal {{languages}} (Plateau Penutian, Chinookan, Salishan), Pahto means high up, very high, standing up, or high sloping mountain. The Klickitat name is of Klickitat origin and comes from the Chinookan for beyond.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> {{population}} is sizeable but small proportionally. Over 10,200 residents of Cook County are of <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> ancestry, equivalent to just 0.2% {{of the total}} population. There are 974 Cherokee, 612 Chippewa, 430 Navajo, and 96 Sioux living in Cook County. <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> of Hispanic origin represent much of <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> population group. Some 5,900 <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> are of non-Hispanic origin, so some 4,300 are of Hispanic origin. Over 40% of <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> racial group is of Hispanic descent.|$|R
50|$|Many {{denominations}} {{of mainstream}} Christianity made attempts to convert <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> to Christianity in Indian Country. These efforts were successful for many <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> tribes reflect Christian creed, including <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> Church.

5|$|General Amherst, the British {{commander-in-chief}} in North America, was {{in overall}} charge of administering policy towards Native Americans, which involved both military matters and {{regulation of the}} fur trade. Amherst believed that with France out of the picture, <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> would have no other choice than to accept British rule. He also {{believed that they were}} incapable of offering any serious resistance to the British Army; therefore, of the 8,000 troops under his command in North America, only about 500 were stationed in the region where the war erupted. Amherst and officers such as Major Henry Gladwin, commander at Fort Detroit, made little effort to conceal their contempt for <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans.</b> Native Americans involved in the uprising frequently complained that the British treated them no better than slaves or dogs.|$|E
5|$|Historically, the Great Warrior Path of <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> crossed Harveys Creek {{near its}} mouth. The path ran from Sunbury to Athens. In December 1775, a battle known as Plunkett's Battle was fought along the Susquehanna River {{very close to}} the creek. This battle was one of the major battles in the Yankee-Pennamite Wars.|$|E
5|$|In the 1850s, European-Americans {{settled in}} the area that is now Omak and built houses and inaugurated mining, logging and {{agricultural}} activities. As more white settlers arrived, a dispute about land ownership arose between them and <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans.</b>|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> Music Awards (also {{known as}} the NAMAs or [...] "Nammys") are an awards program {{presented}} annually by Elbel Productions, Inc., <b>The</b> <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> Music Awards Inc., and <b>The</b> <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> Music Association, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization incorporated in 1998, which recognizes outstanding musical achievement in styles associated with <b>Native</b> <b>Americans,</b> predominantly in <b>the</b> United States and Canada. While <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> performers {{in a variety of}} genres are also recognized, nominees {{do not have to be}} <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> themselves. <b>The</b> awards were created in 1998 to offer <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> musicians greater recognition from the American music industry and to create opportunities for international exposure and recognition.|$|R
5|$|Muncy Creek {{was known}} to <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> as Occohpocheny. Historically, Native Americans painted on Picture Rock, a cliff on the creek. Additionally, six Native American lance heads made of stone were found near the creek by Joseph Fahrenbach {{in the autumn of}} 1872.|$|E
5|$|Onions {{were taken}} by the first European {{settlers}} to North America, where <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> were already eating wild onions raw or cooked in various foods.

5|$|The {{indigenous}} {{peoples of the}} Willamette River practiced a variety of life ways. Those on the lower river, slightly closer to the coast, often relied on fishing as their primary economic mainstay. Salmon {{was the most important}} fish to Willamette River tribes as well as to <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> of the Columbia River, where white traders traded fish with <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans.</b> Upper-river tribes caught steelhead and salmon, often by building weirs across tributary streams. Tribes of the northern Willamette Valley practiced a generally settled lifestyle. The Chinooks lived in great wooden lodges, practiced slavery, and had a well-defined caste system. People of the south were more nomadic, traveling from place to place with the seasons. They were known for the controlled burning of woodlands to create meadows for hunting and plant gathering (especially camas).|$|E
5000|$|Peter H. Wood {{found that}} by 1708 South Carolina's {{population}} totaled 9,580 and included 4,100 African slaves, 1,400 <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> slaves. African men composed 45% {{of the slave}} population while <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> women composed 15% {{of the population of}} adult slaves in colonial South Carolina. Moreover, <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> women populations outnumbered <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> men population, and the African men population greatly outnumbered the African women population. This imbalance encouraged unions between the two racial groups with many former slaves mentioning a notable <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> relative one or two generations before them. [...] The unions also lead to an obvious but unknown number of mixed children of African and Indigenous bloodlines. By 1715 <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> slave population in the Carolina colony was estimated at 1,850. Prior to 1720, when it ended <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> slave trade, Carolina exported as many or more <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> slaves than it imported Africans.|$|R

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of recorded American history, the Harrisburg area was inhabited by several Algonquian tribes, including the Shawnee and Piankashaw, {{who lived in the}} dense inland forests. Prior to the arrival of European settlers, the Piankashaw tribe was driven out by the more aggressive Shawnee. European settlement in Illinois began with the French from 1690 and reached its peak about 1750, mainly along the Mississippi River. American settlers arrived in 1790. The French came as merchants and missionaries, with farming supplementing the need for trade. The result had benefited both the settlers and <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans.</b> The American migration, however, followed treaties which resulted in land being distributed through American Law, ignoring previous indigenous rights. Encroachment ensued and caused hard feelings between the Indians and the settlers who moved into the interior and along migration routes. Many of the Indians allied themselves with the British to resist, though trade with the Americans was an important reason why <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> remained largely peaceful.|$|E
5|$|Eight {{percent of}} the English adult male {{population}} is estimated to have died during the war, a rather large percentage by most standards. The impact on <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> was far higher, however. So many were killed, fled, or shipped off as slaves that the entire Native American population of New England fell by sixty to eighty percent.|$|E
5|$|Having {{secured the}} area around Fort Niagara, the British {{launched}} two military expeditions into the west. The first expedition, led by Colonel John Bradstreet, was to travel by boat across Lake Erie and reinforce Detroit. Bradstreet was to subdue <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> around Detroit before marching south into the Ohio Country. The second expedition, commanded by Colonel Bouquet, was to march west from Fort Pitt and form a second front in the Ohio Country.|$|E
