5|$|It is {{not clear}} how the {{described}} genetic defects increase the Na+/K+-ATPase activity, but it is suspected that the enzyme becomes more active due <b>to</b> <b>increased</b> thyroid hormone levels. Hyperthyroidism increases the levels of catecholamines (such as adrenaline) in the blood, increasing Na+/K+-ATPase activity. The enzyme activity is then increased further by the precipitating causes. For instance, increased carbohydrate intake leads <b>to</b> <b>increased</b> insulin levels; this is known to activate Na+/K+-ATPase. Once the precipitant is removed, the enzyme activity returns to normal levels. It has been postulated that male hormones increase Na+/K+-ATPase activity, and that this explains why males are at a higher risk of TPP despite thyroid disease being more common in females.|$|E

5|$|The {{result of}} {{breathing}} increased partial pressures of oxygen is hyperoxia, {{an excess of}} oxygen in body tissues. The body is affected in different ways {{depending on the type}} of exposure. Central nervous system toxicity is caused by short exposure to high partial pressures of oxygen at greater than atmospheric pressure. Pulmonary and ocular toxicity result from longer exposure <b>to</b> <b>increased</b> oxygen levels at normal pressure. Symptoms may include disorientation, breathing problems, and vision changes such as myopia. Prolonged exposure to above-normal oxygen partial pressures, or shorter exposures to very high partial pressures, can cause oxidative damage to cell membranes, collapse of the alveoli in the lungs, retinal detachment, and seizures. Oxygen toxicity is managed by reducing the exposure <b>to</b> <b>increased</b> oxygen levels. Studies show that, in the long term, a robust recovery from most types of oxygen toxicity is possible.|$|E
