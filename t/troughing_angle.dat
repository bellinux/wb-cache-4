40|$|Most {{small scale}} {{industries}} rely on human effort for transporting raw materials from one {{stage of processing}} to another thereby reducing the overall system performance. The work discusses {{the development of a}} belt conveyor system for small scale industry. The conveyor is of height 0. 75 m at 0 o angle of inclination, 35 o <b>troughing</b> <b>angle</b> and a surcharge angle of 25 o. It also consists of a belt whose width is 410 mm, length 2. 4 m and a basic length 4. 54 m. The conveyor has an average capacity of 43. 75 tonnes/hr. The evaluation of the conveyor was carried out by conveying 12 packs of bottled water of different weights across a distance of 2 m at a different speeds ranging from of 200 - 400 rpm. Results obtained indicated that the time of conveying the materials increases with increase in weight of the bottled water. The successful completion of this work provides a conveyor system which will aid the movement of material {{from one place to another}} with little or no human intervention. This will help the industry in reducing cost in acquiring labour that will be used in material movement thereby reducing cost of production...|$|E
40|$|In coming decades, many {{underground}} mines {{will operate}} at greater depths, which will affect many operational {{factors such as}} increased rock stress, longer haulage distances, and higher energy consumption, which potentially can generate lower production rates. The increased rock stresses may lead to smaller sized openings, further restricting the size of loading and hauling equipment that can be used. Longer hauling distances result in increased energy consumption for loading and hauling equipment, and in turn, high energy consumption increases heat and gas emissions for diesel equipment. Heat emission increases ventilation costs as large volumes of air must be circulated to cool diesel engines and simultaneously maintain adequate air quality for personnel. The research presented in this thesis was carried out to evaluate and analyze different haulage systems, including diesel and electric trucks, shafts, and belt conveyors. The aim was to determine how these various material-handling equipment may produce the desired production objectives and lead to lower energy costs. The net present value (NPV) of the mine plan at increasing mining rates and altered commodity prices was also analyzed. The method used was the combination of discrete event simulation and mixed integer programing. Discrete event simulation was used to estimate mine production for different haulage systems, {{and the results were}} used to compute appropriate mining costs for each hauling option. Mixed integer programming (MIP) was then used to generate the optimal production schedule and mine plan. The analysis showed that an increasing use of electric trucks will have positive effects on production improvement because electric trucks have shorter cycle times than their diesel counterparts. Therefore, electric trucks can make more cycles than diesel trucks in the same period of time. The analysis also showed that low-profile equipment will remain viable for haulage in high stress environments that result in smaller sized mine openings. In addition, when friction hoist systems are used, rope speed and skip payload play important roles in production improvement. With belt conveyors, production improvements can be obtained by increasing surcharge angle and running the belt at a low speed. For long hauls, the <b>troughing</b> <b>angle</b> should be increased and the belt operated at a higher speed. Energy costs increase with depth and are higher for diesel trucks compared with other haulage options. At 1000 -meter depths and with current energy prices, energy costs for diesel trucks, electric trucks, belt conveyor, and shaft account for 62 %, 54 %, 25 %, and 14 % of the total haulage costs, respectively. These findings indicate that minimizing the usage of diesel engine machines will have greater benefits towards cost reductions in an era of increasing energy prices and greater mine depths. Diesel machines also have high heat and gas emissions, which increases operating costs particularly for deeper mines where heat emissions increase ventilation costs. Changes in mine plans based on changing commodity prices at a fixed mining rate resulted in an increase in the NPV from $ 96 M to ultimately $ 755 M for the studied case. An increase in mining rate from 300, 000 to 450, 000 tonnes raised the NPV to $ 773. 45 M. This finding indicates that even though an increase in mining rates increases costs, companies may find that pursuing such a course is beneficial at certain commodity prices, especially when the price is elevated. When the price falls, increasing mining rate may need a detail evaluation of other parameters such as grade, recovery, and investment changes. The evaluation showed that the method of combining discrete event simulation and mixed integer programming can yield a feasible solution and better understanding of the operational systems and reduce risks in selecting a system before it is implemented. This study provides mining companies an analysis of the use of underground haulage systems that can aid decision making.

These systems have the advantages of portability and lesser space requirements. This paper deals with PV-water hybrid energy system. Different types of Concentrators are also integrated with the system. Concentrator types used are, Single mirror concentrator, V-trough concentrator, and Compound parabolic concentrator. A comparison is done between the outputs obtained for the system without cooling and with cooling for different types.

V-trough concentrator (2 -sun) system is developed for {{different types of}} tracking modes: seasonal, one axis north-south and two axes tracking. Three design models based on these tracking modes are used to develop the V-trough for a 2 -sun concentration. Commercially available PV modules of different make and types were evaluated for their usability under 2 -sun concentration. The V-trough concentrator system with geometric concentration ratio of 2 (2 -sun) increases the output power by 44 % as compared to PV flat-plate system for passively cooled modules. Design models with lower <b>trough</b> <b>angles</b> gave higher output power because of higher glass transmittivity. PV modules with lower series resistance gave higher gain in output power.

50|$|The {{plates are}} often spaced by rubber sealing gaskets which are {{cemented}} into a section {{around the edge}} of the plates. The plates are pressed to form <b>troughs</b> at right <b>angles</b> to the direction of flow of the liquid which runs through the channels in the heat exchanger. These troughs are arranged so that they interlink with the other plates which forms the channel with gaps of 1.3 - 1.5 mm between the plates. The plates are compressed together in a rigid frame to form an arrangement of parallel flow channels with alternating hot and cold fluids. The plates produce an extremely large surface area, which allows for the fastest possible transfer. Making each chamber thin ensures that the majority of the volume of the liquid contacts the plate, again aiding exchange. The troughs also create and maintain a turbulent flow in the liquid to maximize heat transfer in the exchanger. A high degree of turbulence can be obtained at low flow rates and high heat transfer coefficient can then be achieved.|$|R

It was the subjected to analysis by Langmuir-Blodgett <b>trough</b> experiments, Brewster <b>angle</b> microscopy, Confocal microscopy of giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs), and binding studies with lipid nanodiscs. These studies showed hRSV-M having a preference for interacting with negatively charged lipids, namely phosphatidylserine, and for having different behaviours in Lo and Ld phases of membranes. During work on hRSV-M to improve its stability, it was discovered calcium stabilised the protein. This relationship was explored by ICPMS, differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF), circular dichroism (CD), mass spectrometry and microscale thermophoresis. This showed the hRSV-M is a calcium binding protein, containing two binding sites. Influenza-A-M 1 was cloned into a plasmid vector and subsequently expressed and purified. The stability {{and structure of the}} protein was probed by DSF and CD measurements. The lipid interactions of this protein were then also explored by Langmuir-Blodgett trough isotherms and GUV binding under confocal microscopy. These showed that M 1 is able to bind to phosphatidylserine containing membranes and causes vesicle budding from those membranes. ...|$|R
40|$|In a {{parabolic}} trough system, {{the portion of}} the absorber tube facing the sun receives incident rays directly, whereas the other side receives concentrated rays resulting in circumferential non-uniform flux distribution. Near the sun facing end of the absorber tube, the flux also varies along the length depending upon the rim <b>angle</b> of <b>trough</b> and <b>angle</b> of incidence of sun rays. This circumferential and axial distribution of the solar flux and variation in the fluid temperature result in non-uniform temperature of the absorber tube. The temperature gradient, thus produced, can lead to bending of the tube which may pose the risk of glass cover damage. The absorber tube considered in this work is equidistantly supported at hinges. An analytical expression for deflection in the central axis of the absorber tube (from the focal line of the trough) is derived using circumferential and axial distribution of solar flux incorporating Gaussian sun shape and optical errors. Expressions for radial, circumferential and axial distributions of normal stress and strain induced in the absorber tube are also derived. Effects of angle of incidence of sun rays, optical errors, rim <b>angle</b> of <b>trough,</b> desired rise in fluid temperature and types of supports on deflection and stresses have been studied keeping solar radiation, ambient conditions, fluid, material of absorber tube, receiver's dimensions, aperture width and distance between the consecutive supports fixed. For a desired rise of 0. 1 degrees C/m (averaged over the receiver's length) in the fluid temperature, maximum deflections of - 0. 57 mm and - 1. 51 mm have been found out for two types of supports which elevate to - 2. 71 mm and - 7. 14 mm respectively when the fluid temperature-rise increases to 1 degrees C/m (positive and negative signs indicate deflections away and towards the vertex line of the trough respectively). Maximum compressive (negative) stresses increase from 19. 29 MPa to 66. 61 MPa and tensile (positive) stresses increase from 10. 14 MPa to 49. 67 MPa as fluid temperature-rise increases from 0. 1 degrees C/m to 1 degrees C/m. It is found that axial variation in solar flux near the sun facing end of absorber tube {{plays an important role in}} deflection. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Recent works {{showed that}} the {{absorbing}} material in broad absorption line (BAL) quasars is optically thick to major resonant absorption lines. This material may contribute significantly to the polarization in the absorption lines. In this paper, we present a detailed study of the resonant line scattering process using Monte-Carlo method to constrain the optical depth, the geometry and the kinematics of BAL Region (BALR). By comparing our results with observed polarized spectra of BAL quasars, we find: (1) Resonant scattering can produce polarization up to 9 % at the absorption trough for doublet transitions and up to 20 % for singlet transitions in radially accelerated flows. To explain the large polarization degree in the CIV, NV absorption line troughs detected in {{a small fraction of}} BAL QSOs, a nonmonotonic velocity distribution along the line of sight or/and additional contribution from the electron scattering region is required. (2) The rotation of the flow can lead to the rotation of the polarization position angle (PA) in the line <b>trough.</b> Large extending <b>angle</b> of BALR is required to produce the observed large PA rotation in a few BAL QSOs. (3) A large extending angle of BALR is required to explain a sub-trough in the polarized flux that was observed in a number of BAL QSOs. (4) The resonant-scattering can contribute a significant part of NV emission line in some QSOs, and may give rise to anomalous strong NV lines in these quasars. (5) The polarized flux and PA rotation produced by the resonant scattering in non-BAL is uniquely asymmetric, which may be used to test the presence of BALR in non-BAL QSOs.

40|$|AbstractIntroductionEpidemiological {{studies show}} that severe knee {{injuries}} are prevalent in alpine skiing. Their incidence is related to ski boot and ski binding concept – both designed to prevent tibia fractures. To reliably protect the knee, ski bindings need a release mechanism which follows different release principles. Therefore, attempts are made to develop mechatronic concepts implementing additional criteria and to release the foot when critical loads at the knee are reached. One possibility to systematically manipulate external loads and to investigate the resulting stresses in the joint are experiments using an artificial leg. This paper describes the development and the evaluation of such kind of model (“leg surrogate”) including a complex artificial knee joint. The evaluation includes tests concerning the reliability, sensitivity and plausibility of the surrogate. MethodTibia and femur consist of an aluminum bone imitate and are reconstructed based on human computerized tomography data. Human endoprosthesis are used as articulating surfaces for the tibial plateau, the femoral condyles, the trochlea {{as well as the}} patella. Ten steel ropes connected to a force measuring cell are incorporated simulating the muscle. The muscle volume is imitated by a three layer coat of thermoplastic. The artificial knee ligaments are instrumented with custom made elongation and force sensors. Leg surrogate presetting's can be varied <b>trough</b> the knee <b>angle,</b> hip angle, varus or valgus position, tension of the muscle and pretension of the ligaments. A test rig enables t quasi static application of external loads to the leg surrogate in any combination about the x, y and z-axis. ResultsThe leg surrogate delivers reproducible measurements with a maximum variation of 2. 7 %. It allows to simulate different conditions like muscle tension or hip angles and to record their influence on the knee ligaments. The plausibility checks performed indicate, that the leg surrogate represents the behavior of the human knee to a large extend. ConclusionThe new leg surrogate allows to simulate not only alpine skiing injury but also other load situations. It therefore can be used to systematically investigate critical load situations to the knee and the prevention effect of safety devices such as mechatronic ski bindings or knee protection devices like preventive knee braces...|$|R
40|$|The {{monolayer}} {{formed at}} an air/water interface by the synthetic non-ionic surfactant, 1, 2 -di-O-octadecyl-rac-glyceryl- 3 -(ω-methoxydodecakis (ethylene glycol)) (2 C 18 E 12) {{has been characterized}} using Langmuir <b>trough</b> measurements, Brewster <b>angle</b> microscopy (BAM), and neutron reflectometry. The BAM and reflectometry studies were performed at four different surface pressures (π) in the range 15 – 40 mN/m. The BAM studies (which give information on the in-plane organisation of the surfactant layer) demonstrate that the 2 C 18 E 12 molecules are arranged on the water surface to form distinct, approximately circular, 5 μm diameter domains. As the surface pressure is increased these domains retain their size and shape but are made progressively more close-packed, such that the monolayer is made more or less complete at π= 40 mN/m. The neutron reflectometry measurements were made to determine {{the structure of the}} interfacial surfactant layer at π= 15, 28, 34 and 40 mN/m, providing information on the thickness of the 2 C 18 E 12 alkyl chains', head groups' and associated solvent distributions (measured along the surface normal), along with the separations between these distributions, and the effective interfacial area per molecule. Partial structure factor analyses of the reflectivity data show that the effective interfacial area occupied decreases from 217 Å 2 per 2 C 18 E 12 molecule at π= 15 mN/m down to 102 Å 2 at π= 40 mN/m. There are concomitant increases in the widths of the surfactant's alkyl chains' and head groups' distributions (modelled as Gaussians), with the former rising from 12 Å (at π= 15 mN/m) up to 19 Å (at π= 40 mN/m) and the latter rising from 13 Å (at π= 15 mN/m) up to 24 Å (at π= 40 mN/m). The compression of the monolayer is also shown to give rise to an increased surface roughness, some of which is due to the thermal roughness caused by capillary waves, but with a significant contribution also coming from the intrinsic/structural disorder in the monolayer. At all surface pressures studied, the alkyl chains and head groups of the 2 C 18 E 12 are found to exhibit a significant overlap, and this increases with increasing π. Given the various trends noted on how the structure of the 2 C 18 E 12 monolayer changes as a function of π, we extrapolate to consider the structure of the monolayer at π> 40 mN/m (making comparison with its single chain (CnEm) counterparts) and then relate these findings to the observations recorded on the structure and solute entrapment efficiency of 2 C 18 E 12 vesicles...|$|R
40|$|Parabolic trough {{systems are}} one of the most commercially and {{technically}} developed technologies for concentrated solar power. With the current research and development efforts, the cost of electricity from these systems is approaching the cost of electricity from medium-sized coal-fired power plants. Some of the cost-cutting options for parabolic trough systems include: (i) increasing the sizes of the concentrators to improve the system’s concentration ratio and to reduce the number of drives and controls and (ii) improving the system’s optical efficiency. However, the increase in the concentration ratios of these systems requires improved performance of receiver tubes to minimise the absorber tube circumferential temperature difference, receiver thermal loss and entropy generation rates in the receiver. As such, the prediction of the absorber tube’s circumferential temperature difference, receiver thermal performance and entropy generation rates in parabolic trough receivers therefore, becomes very important as concentration ratios increase. In this study, the thermal and thermodynamic performance of parabolic trough receivers at different Reynolds numbers, inlet temperatures and rim angles as concentration ratios increase are investigated. The potential for improved receiver thermal and thermodynamic performance with heat transfer enhancement using wall-detached twisted tape inserts, perforated plate inserts and perforated conical inserts is also evaluated. In this work, the heat transfer, fluid flow and thermodynamic performance of a parabolic trough receiver were analysed numerically by solving the governing equations using a general purpose computational fluid dynamics code. SolTrace, an optical modelling tool that uses Monte-Carlo ray tracing techniques was used to obtain the heat flux profiles on the receiver’s absorber tube. These heat flux profiles were then coupled to the CFD code by means of user-defined functions for the subsequent analysis of the thermal and thermodynamic performance of the receiver. With this approach, actual non-uniform heat flux profiles and actual non-uniform temperature distribution in the receiver different from constant heat flux profiles and constant temperature distribution often used in other studies were obtained. Both thermodynamic and multi-objective optimisation approaches were used to obtain optimal configurations of the proposed heat transfer enhancement techniques. For thermodynamic optimisation, the entropy generation minimisation method was used. Whereas, the multi-objective optimisation approach was implemented in ANSYS DesignXplorer to obtain Pareto solutions for maximum heat transfer and minimum fluid friction for each of the heat transfer enhancement techniques. Results showed that rim angles lower than 60 o gave high absorber tube circumferential temperature differences, higher receiver thermal loss and higher entropy generation rates, especially for flow rates lower than 43 m 3 /h. The entropy generation rates reduced as the inlet temperature increased, increased as the rim angles reduced and as concentration ratios increased. Existence of an optimal Reynolds number at which entropy generation is a minimum for any given inlet temperature, rim angle and concentration ratio is demonstrated. In addition, for the heat transfer enhancement techniques considered, correlations for the Nusselt number and fluid friction were obtained and presented. With heat transfer enhancement, the thermal efficiency of the receiver increased in the range 5 % – 10 %, 3 % – 8 % and 1. 2 % – 8 % with twisted tape inserts, perforated conical inserts and perforated plate inserts respectively. Results also show that with heat transfer enhancement, the absorber tube’s circumferential temperature differences reduce in the range 4 % – 68 %, 3. 4 – 56 % and up to 67 % with twisted tape inserts, perforated conical inserts and perforated plate inserts respectively. Furthermore, the entropy generation rates were reduced by up to 59 %, 45 % and 53 % with twisted tape inserts, perforated conical inserts and perforated plate inserts respectively. Moreover, using multi-objective optimisation, Pareto optimal solutions were obtained and presented for each heat transfer enhancement technique. In summary, results from this study demonstrate that for a parabolic <b>trough</b> system, rim <b>angles,</b> concentration ratios, flow rates and inlet temperatures have a strong influence on the thermal and thermodynamic performance of the parabolic trough receiver. The potential for improved receiver thermal and thermodynamic performance with heat transfer enhancement has also been demonstrated. Overall, this study provides useful knowledge for improved design and efficient operation of parabolic trough systems.

40|$|The Devonian Taylor Group (the lower Beacon Supergroup), in the Taylor and Wright Valleys, {{southern}} Victoria Land (SVL), Antarctica, {{is separated}} from basement by a regional nonconformity, the Kukri Erosion Surface. Thereafter the Taylor Group sediments, observed in this thesis, are affected by two localized unconformities; the Windy Gully Erosion Surface, separating the Terra Cotta Siltstone Formation (TCzst) and older units from the younger overlying New Mountain Sandstone; and the Heimdall Erosion Surface (HES), separating the New Mountain Sandstone Formation (NMSst) and older units from the overlying Altar Mountain Formation. The depositional environments of the Windy Gully Sandstone, New Mountain Sandstone and Altar Mountain Formations have long been under debate. The Kukri Erosion Surface (KES) truncates the crystalline basement and separates the basement rock from the overlying Beacon Supergroup. Interpretation of the erosion surface characteristics and the directly overlying basal conglomerate lithofacies (WG-BCL) suggest a high relief rocky shore platform environment during a sustained and significant relative sea level fall. The environment has been suggested {{to be similar to}} what is currently seen on the West Coast, New Zealand today. The Windy Gully Sandstone Formation directly overlies the KES and consists of a basal conglomerate (WG-BCL) followed by moderately to well sorted tabular and trough cross bedded felds- to subfeldsarenites. At one location an interbedded siltstone and cross bedded sandstone lithofacies was observed and interpreted as a tidal flat. Overall interpretation of the WGSst suggests continued progradation from a rocky shore platform (WG-BCL) to a series low angle beach, to shallow marine, and back to low angle beach environments. This occurred during a relative sea level rise. Shallowing of the water column produced a gradational relationship with the Terra Cotta Siltstone Formation (TCzst) [...] The fine to very fine sandy mottled, well laminated siltstones moving to very fine fissile dark siltstones suggest a progression from sandy estuarine to a mud flat environment. The Terra Cotta Siltsone is truncated by the Windy Gully Erosion Surface The Windy Gully Erosion Surface is observed in the Handsley Valley by the presence of TCzst rip-up clasts in the directly overlying New Mountain Sandstone Formation. Elsewhere the horizon is either very sharp or has desiccation cracks present suggesting a cessation of deposition and subaerial exposure respectively. This suggests a small relative fall in sea level with only localized erosion. The New Mountain Sandstone Formation (NMSst) predominantly consists of a series of low angle tabular and higher <b>angle</b> <b>trough</b> cross beds. It has a subfeldsarenite base that progressively becomes a pure quartz arenites. Interpretation suggests an initial beach environment with rejuvenated sediments moving to quartzose shallow marine and back to beach environments. This represents a relative sea level rise with continued progradation The NMSst is truncated in the north by the HES forming a characteristic saw tooth pattern in the cross bedded sandstones; elsewhere the HES is represented by a feldspathic influx moving into the Altar Mountain Formation. The HES was formed due to a significant relative sea level fall leading to exposure and erosion of lithified NMSst cross beds in the north but continuation of deposition in the south. The Altar Mountain Formation consists of tabular and trough cross bedded subfields- to feldsarenites. The Odin Arkose Member directly overlying the HES is a granule to cobble conglomerate in the north where the HES is erosional and very coarse sand to granule feldsarenite in the south where the HES is conformable. This has been interpreted as a pebbly shore platform to coarse sandy to granular beach environment. The following Altar Mountain Formation is interpreted as a continuation of medium to coarse sandy beach environments with influxes of coarser sediments and possibly moving into shallow marine in places. Sequence stratigraphy identifies three stratigraphic sequences: S 1, the Windy Gully Sandstone and Terra Cotta Siltstone Formations; S 2, the New Mountain Sandstone Formation; and S 3, the Altar Mountain Formation. The first two sequences (S 1 &S 2) show a clear progression through transgression to a high stand systems tract through regression to a low stand systems tract. The Altar Mountain Formation follows a very similar trend but {{due to the lack of}} time and data the above measures have been speculated. Zircon age dating suggests the source of the sediments in the area come from the Neoproterozic Skelton Group and the DV 2 a Granite Harbour Intrusives, both directly underlying the sandstones but are exposed elsewhere in SVL. Laminated sandstone clasts within the New Mountain Basal Conglomerate Lithofacies (NM-BCL) are suggested to be sourced from recycled sediments directly below. Other exotic clasts are also observed in the lithofacies are of unknown origin...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1989 Presentation date: 1988 - 05 - 27 The middle Eocene Tillamook Volcanics {{form the}} oldest rock {{unit in the}} Elsie-lower Nehalem River area. K-Ar age {{determinations}} and age constraints imposed by foraminiferal and calcareous nannofossil assemblages of overlying sedimentary strata indicate an absolute age of about 42 Ma for the uppermost Tillamook Volcanics. Major oxide values indicate that the upper Tillamook Volcanics are highly fractionated high Fe-Ti tholeiitic basalts and basaltic andesites. These volcanics were erupted in a developing forearc under an extensional plate tectonic setting and formed a moderately large oceanic island. These subaerial flows are predominantly aphyric to plagioclase-augite porphyritic and have a pilotaxitic flow texture. Epochs of both normal and reverse magnetic polarity are recorded. Thermal subsidence related {{to the end of}} the volcanism resulted in deposition of the transgressive late Eocene Hamlet formation over the "Tillamook island". The informal Hamlet formation consists of three members. From oldest to youngest they are: the Roy Creek member, the Sunset Highway member, and the Sweet Home Creek member. Three lithofacies are present in the Roy Creek member. The stratigraphically lowest of these consists of basaltic boulder-pebble conglomerate and locally fossiliferous pebbly basaltic sandstones which were deposited in a high energy nearshore environment around rocky basaltic headlands and sea stacks of the Tillamook Volcanics. Molluscan fossils in this lithofacies are correlative to the middle to late Eocene "CowlitzCoaledo" fauna. Successively overlying lithofacies are a very coarseto coarse-grained shallow marine basaltic sandstone lithofacies and a medium- to fine-grained basaltic sandstone lithofacies. This fining upward sequenced documents progressive deepening of the depositional basin. Framework clasts in all three Roy Creek member lithofacies were predominantly derived from the Tillamook Volcanics. Pore-filling diagenetic chlorite, smectite (nontronite), calcite, and zeolite (clinoptilolite and heulandite) cements severely reduce the porosity of Roy Creek member sandstones. The Sunset Highway member of the Hamlet formation conformably overlies the Roy Creek member in eastern Clatsop and western Columbia counties and pinches out to the west at about the longitude of the Nehalem River in T. 4 N., R. 8 W [...] The Sunset Highway member is predominantly composed of interbedded micaceous arkosic sandstone, lithic arkose, and muddy micaceous arkosic siltstone with a few beds of basaltic sandstone and basaltic debris flow breccias. The dominant micaceous arkosic composition of the Sunset Highway member reflects a distant extrabasinal granitic-metamorphic provenance and contrasts with that of the locally derived underlying basaltic Roy Creek member. Low <b>angle</b> <b>trough</b> cross-bedding, hummocky bedding, and microcross-laminations in fine to medium-grained arkosic sandstones are interpreted to have been produced by large storm-generated waves and on a high energy inner shelf. Thin interbeds of bioturbated mudstone and mollusc-bearing bioturbated sandstones formed during periods of fairweather conditions and during lower sedimentation rates. Rare matrix supported, basaltic debris-flow breccias and basaltic sandstones were derived from nearby basaltic headlands and by rivers draining the Tillamook Volcanics. Minor secondary intraparticle porosity occurs with some primary intergranular porosity in relatively matrix-free Sunset Highway member arkosic sandstones. However, much of the porosity and permeability of these potential sandstones has been reduced by diagenetic smectite coatings on framework grains and potassium feldspar overgrowths of feldspars. The mudstone-dominated Sweet Home Creek member was conformably deposited on the Sunset Highway member in eastern Clatsop and western Columbia counties. In western Clatsop County the Sweet Home Creek member directly and conformably overlies the Roy Creek member due to pinch out of the Sunset Highway member. Upper Narizian to lowermost Refugian benthic foraminiferal assemblages from this unit indicate outer shelf to upper slope sedimentation and continued subsidence of the depositional (Astoria) basin. Micromicaceous and carbonaceous silty mudatone dominates this unit but thin-bedded micaceous arkosic turbidite sandstones are present in the lower part, and rare, thin basaltic turbidites are present in the upper half. X-ray diffraction analysis shows that the dominant clay minerals in the Sweet Home Creek member niudstone are smectite (montmorillonite), kaolinite, and illite. The Cole Mountain basalt (informal) intrudes and locally overlies the Sweet Home Creek member. This caic-alkaline basaltic andesite is thought to have formed in a compressional plate tectonic regime and been emplaced on the outer shelf and upper slope as shallow irregular sills and dikes and minor submarine pillow basalt-hyaloclastite complexes. Siliceous nodules associated with pillowed units locally contains a few per cent pyrite and are associated with small areas of high-grade supergene copper-silver mineralization. The normally polarized Cole Mountain basalt is chemically, petrographically, and lithologically distinct from the Tillamook Volcanics and Grande Ronde Basalt of the Columbia River Basalt Group. The uppermost Narizian and Refugian (late Eocene) Jewell member of the Keasey Formation disconformably overlies the Cole Mountain basalt and Sweet Home Creek member. A thin basal glauconitic sandstone-siltstone reflects a period of reduced sedimentation under slightly reducing conditions and marks the disconformity. The unit primarily consists of laminated to thin bedded tuffaceous mudstone with a few thin tuff beds, small micaceous arkosic sandstone channels and clastic dikes. Clay minerals in the Jewell member are dominated by smectite (montmorillonite), with minor kaolinite and illite (degraded mica) in the lower part of the unit. Benthic foraminiferal assemblages in the unit indicate bathyal or slope depths and have been assigned to the lower Refugian to upper Narizian stages. In the middle Miocene, irregular dikes and sills of the Grande Ronde Basalt of the Columbia River Basalt Group intruded the late Eocene sedimentary strata in the thesis area. Two magneto-chemical types of Grande Ronde Basalt, N 2 /low MgO-low Ti 02 and N 2 / high MgO, were identified in the thesis area. These were geochemically and magnetically correlated to subaerial flows of magneto-chemical types IA and 5 A of Mangan and others (1986) on the Columbia Plateau. The intrusions or invasive flows are interpreted to have been derived from voluminous plateau eruptions by invasion into soft, unconsolidated Neogene sediments at the marine/coast interface and then into the more brittle but ductile Paleogene strata of the area as first proposed by Beeson and others (1979). Uplift of the Coast Range was initiated in the late Miocene as a result of rapid offshore underthrusting in the subduction zone (Snavely and others, 1983). This has resulted in subaerial erosion and exposure of the faulted and gently folded forearc ridge and deposition of Quaternary alluvial gravels and sands along major rivers and creek in the thesis area. The dominant structural features of the Elsie-lower Nehalem River area are generally down-to-the-north, east-west-trending high angle faults with oblique offset and a conjugate set of oblique slip northwest-trending right-lateral and northeast-trending left-lateral faults. Folds are broad and relatively minor. The major east-west-trending fault pattern may have been initially produced by extensional stresses related to subsidence of the "Tillamook island". The conjugate strike-slip fault pattern may have been created by partial coupling of the forearc basin with oblique subduction of the Farallon plate. Other than timber, locally used rock aggregate from small quarries is the only resource that has been realized in the thesis area. Most quarries are developed in dikes and sills of Grande Ronde Basalt and the aggregate is used to macadamize logging roads. Diagenetic events have resulted in significant loss of porosity and permeability of potential reservoir sandstones in the area. The most favorable targets are relatively matrix-free micaceous arkosic sandstones in the Sunset Highway member, but these have been breached by erosion in the eastern part of the thesis area and pinch out in the western part of the area where potential mudstone cap rocks (e. g., Hamlet and Keasey formations) are present. Mudstones in the area contain woody-structured kerogen and average about 1...|$|R
