5|$|A second sequel, titled Cars 3, was {{released}} on June 16, 2017. Lasseter didn't return to direct so Brian Fee took over the directors chair. The film focuses on Lightning McQueen, now a veteran racer, who gets a help from a young race car, Cruz Ramirez, to instruct him for <b>the</b> <b>increasingly</b> high-tech world.|$|E
5|$|Climate {{change from}} {{global warming is}} leading to a {{mismatch}} between the seasonal coat coloration of arctic animals such as snowshoe hares with <b>the</b> <b>increasingly</b> snow-free landscape.|$|E
5|$|From late 1942 onwards JG 2 was in {{the front}} line against <b>the</b> <b>increasingly</b> {{numerous}} United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) day bomber formations of B-17s and B-24s.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>increasingly</b> {{uniform and}} polonized (in {{the case of}} ethnic minorities) szlachta of the Commonwealth {{for the most part}} {{returned}} to the Roman Catholic religion, or if already Catholic remained Catholic, {{in the course of the}} 17th century.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} species are doing well in <b>the</b> <b>increasingly</b> {{urbanized}} Massachusetts. Peregrine falcons utilize office towers in larger cities as nesting areas, and the population of coyotes, whose diet may include garbage and roadkill, has been increasing in recent decades. White-tailed deer, raccoons, wild turkeys, and eastern gray squirrels are also found throughout Massachusetts. In more rural areas {{in the western part}} of Massachusetts, larger mammals such as moose and black bears have returned, largely due to reforestation following the regional decline in agriculture.|$|E
25|$|Surgery {{involves}} the physical {{removal of the}} tumor, typically {{along with some of}} the surrounding tissue. One or more lymph nodes may be biopsied during <b>the</b> surgery; <b>increasingly</b> <b>the</b> lymph node sampling is performed by a sentinel lymph node biopsy.|$|R
2500|$|The main {{types are}} DC motors and AC motors, <b>the</b> former <b>increasingly</b> being {{displaced}} by the latter.|$|R

5|$|After {{consolidating}} {{his position}} in 1240, Haakon focused on displaying the supremacy of the kingship, influenced by <b>the</b> <b>increasingly</b> closer contact with European culture. He started constructing several monumental royal buildings, primarily in the royal estate in Bergen where he built a European-style stone palace. He used a grand fleet with stately royal ships when meeting with other Scandinavian rulers, and actively sent letters and gifts to other European rulers; his most far-reaching contact was achieved when he sent gyrfalcons with an embassy to the Sultan of Tunis.|$|E
5|$|Alongside the Unix File System, {{which is}} {{typically}} the default file system on BSDs, DragonFly BSD supports HAMMER file system. It was developed specifically for DragonFly BSD {{to provide a}} feature-rich yet better designed analogue of <b>the</b> <b>increasingly</b> popular ZFS. HAMMER supports configurable file system history, snapshots, checksumming, data deduplication and other features typical for file systems of its kind.|$|E
5|$|Cahill had won {{popular support}} as a {{vigorous}} and impressive minister who had resolved problems with New South Wales' electricity supply {{and in his}} first 10 months as premier had reinvigorated the party. He brought order to the government's chaotic public works program. In addition, he attacked <b>the</b> <b>increasingly</b> unpopular federal Coalition government of Robert Menzies. All this, combined with Bruxner and Treatt constantly clashing over policy and candidate issues, contributed to the Liberal-Country Coalition again being defeated at the 14 February 1953 election. This amounted to a total loss of ten seats, three being Country Party seats, and a swing against them of 7.2%. Bruxner retained his seat with 60.15%.|$|E
40|$|A {{recent study}} from the World Health Organisation has {{identified}} depression as the world's most debilitating illness. It is debilitating {{for the millions of}} individual sufferers, for the fabric of our societies and, of course, for <b>the</b> economy. <b>Increasingly,</b> <b>the</b> question of depression is demanding serious political engagement from any self-respecting (and suitably astute) government...|$|R
50|$|The Civil War made <b>the</b> {{situation}} <b>increasingly</b> difficult, and in 1976, MECAS {{was temporarily}} evacuated before closing altogether in 1978.|$|R
50|$|Later in the 20th century, the church's {{downtown}} location {{presented a}} challenge to St. Andrew's, since the area had become largely industrial and later {{one of the poorest}} in <b>the</b> city. <b>Increasingly,</b> <b>the</b> church patrons were living further north. There were thus many discussions of again moving the church, but each time the congregation voted to remain put.|$|R
5|$|Competition {{from new}} superpredators, such as macropredatory sperm whales which {{appeared}} in the Miocene, and killer whales and great white sharks in the Pliocene, may have also contributed to the decline and extinction of megalodon. Fossil records indicate that the new whale-eating cetaceans commonly occurred at high latitudes during the Pliocene, indicating that they could cope with <b>the</b> <b>increasingly</b> prevalent cold water temperatures; but they also occurred in the tropics (e.g., Orcinus sp. in South Africa).|$|E
5|$|Despite a {{reputation}} as an able politician and a likable man, during his presidency Pierce served only as a moderator among <b>the</b> <b>increasingly</b> bitter factions that were driving the nation towards civil war. To Pierce, who saw slavery as a question of property rather than morality, the Union was sacred; because of this, he saw the actions of abolitionists, and the more moderate Free Soilers, as divisive and {{as a threat to}} the constitutionally-guaranteed rights of southerners. Although he criticized those who sought to limit or end slavery, he rarely rebuked southern politicians who took extreme position or opposed northern interests.|$|E
5|$|Despite <b>the</b> <b>increasingly</b> dire {{military}} outlook, Nasjonal Samling's {{position at}} the head of the government, albeit with its ambiguous relationship to the Reichskommissariat, remained unassailable. Nevertheless, the Germans exerted increasing control over law and order in Norway. Following deportation of the Jews, Germany deported Norwegian officers and finally attempted to deport students from the University of Oslo. Even Hitler was incensed by the scale of the arrests. Quisling became entangled in a similar debacle in early 1944 when he forced compulsory military service on elements of the Hird, causing a number of members to resign to avoid being drafted.|$|E
5000|$|During {{the century}} of the rois fainéants, the Merovingian kings were {{increasingly}} dominated by their mayors of the palace, in the 6th century {{the office of}} the manager of the royal household, but in <b>the</b> 7th <b>increasingly</b> <b>the</b> real [...] "power behind the throne" [...] who limited the role of the king to an essentially ceremonial office.|$|R

5|$|During his lifetime, Rodin was {{compared}} to Michelangelo, and was widely recognized as the greatest artist of the era. In the three decades following his death, his popularity waned with changing aesthetic values. Since the 1950s, Rodin's reputation has re-ascended; he is recognized {{as the most important}} sculptor of the modern era, and {{has been the subject of}} much scholarly work. The sense of incompletion offered by some of his sculpture, such as The Walking Man, influenced <b>the</b> <b>increasingly</b> abstract sculptural forms of the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Following an 1866 {{conflict}} between <b>the</b> <b>increasingly</b> authoritarian Cuza {{and the political}} class, various trends organized a coup which brought Prince Carol, a Hohenzollern, to the Romanian throne—echoing a will expressed {{by some of the}} 1848 activists to have a foreign dynasty rule over a unified state. In 1877, {{as a consequence of the}} Russo-Turkish War, Romania proclaimed her independence.|$|E
5|$|Grand Teton National Park is {{an almost}} {{pristine}} ecosystem and the same species of flora and fauna that have existed since prehistoric times can still be found there. More than 1,000species of vascular plants, dozens of species of mammals, 300 species of birds, {{more than a dozen}} fish species and a few species of reptiles and amphibians exist. Due to various changes in the ecosystem, some of them human-induced, efforts have been made to provide enhanced protection to some species of native fish and <b>the</b> <b>increasingly</b> threatened whitebark pine.|$|E

5|$|Hundreds {{of species}} {{of animals and}} plants {{characterize}} the Santa Ana River's diversity of climates and vegetation zones. There are over ten of these vegetation zones in the watershed—including the sparsely vegetated alpine and subalpine zones in the mountains, mid-elevation forests of pine, lodgepole and oak, chaparral, coastal sage scrub, <b>the</b> <b>increasingly</b> rare riparian forest and marshes along the river bed, lined with trees and rushes, and the thinly vegetated coastal areas virtually flush with sea level. The watershed supports up to 200 bird species, fifty mammal species, 13 reptile species, 7 amphibian species, and 15 fish species, including steelhead trout.|$|E
5|$|Improvements in Norfolk's road {{infrastructure}} {{and the development}} of the stagecoach system made Norwich an increasingly popular destination with travellers. Norwich was recovering from the plague years and was a major city, with attractions and social events second only to London itself. <b>The</b> <b>increasingly</b> prosperous country landowners of Norfolk and Suffolk began visiting Norwich more frequently and staying for longer when they did so.|$|E
5|$|Inclined {{to form an}} {{alliance}} with the Habsburgs (and even give up the Polish crown to pursue his ambitions in Sweden), Sigismund conducted secret negotiations with them and married Archduchess Anna. Accused by Zamoyski of breaking his covenants, Sigismund III was humiliated during the sejm of 1592, which deepened his resentment of szlachta. Sigismund was bent on strengthening {{the power of the}} monarchy and Counter-Reformational promotion of the Catholic Church (Piotr Skarga was among his supporters). Indifferent to <b>the</b> <b>increasingly</b> common breaches of the Warsaw Confederation religious protections and instances of violence against the Protestants, the King was opposed by religious minorities.|$|E
50|$|The airline {{launched}} its website in 2000, with online booking initially {{said to be}} a small and unimportant part of the software supporting <b>the</b> site. <b>Increasingly</b> <b>the</b> online booking contributed to the aim of cutting flight prices by selling directly to passengers and excluding the costs imposed by travel agents. Within a year, the website was handling three-quarters of all bookings.|$|R
