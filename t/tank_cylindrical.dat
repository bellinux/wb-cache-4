Processing of African locust bean seed starts with the pretreatment of the harvested fruit before the seed can be converted into its numerous derivatives. Depulpping of locust bean seed is a crucial pretreatment operation, preceding fermentation of the seed. This operation is tedious, time consuming and energy sapping for women and children that are involved in the processing of locust bean. Small Scale equipment for depulpping of African locust bean seed was designed, constructed and tested. Techno-economic status {{of the women in the}} rural areas who are directly involved in the processing of locust bean and its derivatives was taken into consideration. The depulpping machine comprises of a vertical cylindrical <b>tank,</b> <b>cylindrical</b> sieve and a vertical rotating shaft which carries both the paddles and brushes. The vertica...|$|E

The depulpping machine comprises of a vertical cylindrical <b>tank,</b> <b>cylindrical</b> sieve and a vertical rotating shaft which carries both the paddles and brushes. The vertical shaft was mounted at the central axis of the depulpping unit. The machine has a capacity to depulp 10 kg of locust bean seed during a unit batch operation. Five levels of soaking time corresponding to five levels of locust bean moisture contents and five levels of shaft speeds were tested. Test results indicated that the depulpping efficiency varied between 64 and 98 %. The seed membrane damage and seed loss were less than 5 and 9. 2 % respectively at 45 minutes soaking time and at 350 rpm depulpping shaft speed. The maximum power requirement was 2. 25 kW at a shaft speed of 550 rpm. The operating conditions of shaft speed at 350 rpm, 45 minutes soaking time indicated higher depulpping efficiency, lower seed membrane damage and seed loss during depulpping operation. Result of process performance showed that the final depulpping process compared favourantly with that of traditional method...|$|E
