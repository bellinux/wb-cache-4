500|$|A 2007 report {{concluded}} that wood fuel exceeded hydroelectric and wind {{as the largest}} potential source of renewable energy. Scotland's forests, which made up 60% of the UK resource base, were forecast {{to be able to}} provide up to 1 million tonnes of wood fuel per annum. The biomass energy supply in Scotland was forecast to reach 450 MW or higher, (predominantly from wood), with power stations requiring 4,500–5,000 oven dry tonnes per annum per megawatt of generating capacity. However a 2011 Forestry Commission and Scottish government follow-up {{report concluded}} that: [...] "...there is no capacity to support further large scale electricity generation biomass plants from the domestic wood fibre resource." [...] A plan to build in Edinburgh a 200 MW biomass plant which would have imported 83% of its wood, was withdrawn by Forth Energy in 2012. The energy company E.ON has constructed a 44 MW biomass power station at Lockerbie using locally sourced crops while the smaller EPR Westfield power plant in Fife produces 9.8 MW of output using chicken litter as fuel. The Scottish Executive and the Forestry Commission issued a Scottish Biomass Action Plan in 2007. The Scottish Government set up the Scottish Biomass Support Scheme in 2006 with a £7.5 million grant, later increased to £10.5 million, to support biomass energy. £6 million of grants were drawn down by the time the scheme finished in March 2008 and a 2009 review of results concluded that the scheme had [...] "...achieved limited success against its strategic aims objectives." [...] A 2007 article by Renew Scotland claimed that automatic wood pellet boilers could be as convenient to use as conventional central heating systems. These boilers might be cheaper to run and, by using locally produced wood fuel, could <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> carbon neutral as possible by using little energy for transportation.|$|E

2500|$|One of the film's themes is, {{according}} to Lynch, [...] "finding love in Hell". He has stated [...] "For me, it's just {{a compilation of}} ideas that come along. The darker ones and the lighter ones, the humorous ones, all working together. You <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> true as you can to those ideas {{and try to get}} them on film." [...] Some critics have postulated that, similar to Lynch's previous Blue Velvet, the sudden idealistic ending of perfect happiness is ironic, suggesting that people who have the potential for violence struggle to find true happiness. Lynch himself, however, refers to the ending of Wild at Heart as being a [...] "happy" [...] one, having consciously made the decision to change the original darker ending from the novel.|$|E

[...] "Whatever happens, he's still ultimately not a good person and you've got to try and be sympathetic towards him just to see it from his point of view." [...] He did not research paedophilia per se, but tried to discover research on individuals with pre-paedophiliac tendences. He found there was little scientific research in the area. Gravelle was therefore forced to come up with his own rationales for Joe's crimes. [...] "The need to be loved was the root of it," [...] he said. [...] "Joe had love but he didn't have the attention in the way that he got it from Danny. It's probably an ego thing. ... He's not working. It's a self-worth issue." ...|$|E
2500|$|William Shatner {{tried to}} imbue the {{character}} with qualities of [...] "awe and wonder" [...] absent from [...] "The Cage". He also drew upon his {{experiences as a}} Shakespearean actor to invigorate the character, whose dialogue at times is laden with jargon. Not only did Shatner take inspiration from Roddenberry's suggestion of Hornblower, but also from Alexander the Great– [...] "the athlete and the intellectual of his time"– whom Shatner had played for an unsold television pilot two years earlier. In addition, the actor based Kirk partly on himself because [...] "the fatigue factor [...] is such that you <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> honest about yourself as possible". A comedy veteran, Shatner suggested making the show's characters as comfortable working in space as they would be at sea, thus having Kirk be a humorous [...] "good-pal-the-captain, who in time of need would snap to and become the warrior". Changing the character to be [...] "a man with very human emotions" [...] also allowed {{for the development of}} the Spock character. Shatner wrote that [...] "Kirk was a man who marveled and greatly appreciated the endless surprises presented to him by the universe ... He didn't take things for granted and, more than anything else, respected life in every one of its weird weekly adventure forms".|$|E

[...] "Joe had love but he didn't have the attention in the way that he got it from Danny. It's probably an ego thing. ... He's not working. It's a self-worth issue." [...] Forced to stay apart {{from the rest of the}} cast to prevent the public or press from suspecting his involvement in series two, Gravelle used his sense of isolation to bring his character to life. Gravelle said he found that the key to his character in series two was desperation. Joe Miller, he said, sought spiritual relief in both series one and two out of a desperate bid to feel better about himself and his crime. His not-guilty plea in series two, Gravelle felt, was also motivated by desperation (rather than a months-long plan to expose the town's secrets).|$|E

Hex said the capture and logging is the most challenging part of the job, {{but it is also}} unique as if she is referencing a particular part of the game, she can show her own personal experience rather than rolling stock footage. Bajo says this is also for editorial reasons in that, [...] "We need to defend our point by showing the footage to satisfy the ABC's charter." [...] Bajo notes that in the show's early days, there were some intense forum flames over things like missing a detail out, or not agreeing with the general consensus among viewers. He also says {{that if there is a}} genre of games that he and Hex don't like or aren't very good at, such as sports games, they won't ignore it and will <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> honest as possible with their reviews. Bajo says that as people invest so many hours into a game, it is justified to feel a sense of ownership over it and feel defensive if someone doesn't feel the same way. For this reason he loves [...] "getting to the bottom of" [...] why certain games are liked by some and disliked by others. Bajo says you can't speak with conviction if you haven't done something, especially [...] " [...] something as involving as games". Bajo explains [...] " [...] the odd publisher/developer who wasn't happy with our review [...] we try to be fair, honest, and listen to all feedback we get to make sure we're not ever crossing any lines." ...|$|E
