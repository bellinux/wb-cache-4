5|$|The main {{damage done}} by mole crickets is {{as a result of}} their {{burrowing}} activities. As they tunnel through the top few centimetres of soil <b>they</b> <b>push</b> the ground up in little ridges, increasing evaporation of surface moisture, disturbing germinating seeds and damaging the delicate young roots of seedlings. They are also injurious to turf- and pasture-grasses as they feed on the roots of the grasses, leaving the plants prone to drying-out and damage by use.|$|E
5|$|Because {{it is so}} {{far from}} the nearest major landmass, the {{ecosystem}} of Kohala has experienced the phenomenon of geographic isolation, resulting in an ecosystem radically different from that of other places. Invasive species introduced by man present a problem to Kohala's ecosystem, as <b>they</b> <b>push</b> native species out of their habitat. There are several initiatives to preserve Kohala's ecosystem. Crops, especially sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas), have been harvested on the Leeward side of the volcano for centuries as well. The northern part of the island is named after the mountain, with two districts named North and South Kohala. King Kamehameha I, the first King of the Kingdom of Hawaii, was born in North Kohala, near Hawi.|$|E

25|$|Goalkeepers {{routinely}} perform extension dives. To execute this, <b>they</b> <b>push</b> off {{the ground}} with the foot nearest to the ball, launching themselves into a horizontal position. At this point, the ball may be caught or pushed away. In the latter case, a good goalkeeper will attempt to ensure that the rebound cannot be taken by a player of the opposite team, although this is not always possible.|$|E
25|$|Exercises: In general, horses tend {{to switch}} their leads {{from the one}} on which they {{approached}} as they go over an obstacle. So if they approached on the right lead, they will land on the left. This is because of how they line up their hind legs as <b>they</b> <b>push</b> on take off. A rider can practice asking for a certain lead by trotting a small vertical, and asking for the canter over the fence.|$|E

6000|$|... 'His {{feet were}} glued to that remote spot {{and his eyes}} to their indistinct group bowed {{together}} and swaying strangely in the common torment of fear. A hand-lamp lashed to a stanchion above a little table rigged up on the bridge--the Patna had no chart-room amidships--threw a light on their labouring shoulders, on their arched and bobbing backs. <b>They</b> <b>pushed</b> at {{the bow of the}} boat; <b>they</b> <b>pushed</b> out into the night; <b>they</b> <b>pushed,</b> and would no more look back at him. They had given him up as if indeed he had been too far, too hopelessly separated from themselves, to be worth an appealing word, a glance, or a sign. They had no leisure to look back upon his passive heroism, to feel the sting of his abstention. The boat was heavy; <b>they</b> <b>pushed</b> at the bow with no breath to spare for an encouraging word: but the turmoil of terror that had scattered their self-command like chaff before the wind, converted their desperate exertions into a bit of fooling, upon my word, fit for knockabout clowns in a farce. <b>They</b> <b>pushed</b> with their hands, with their heads, <b>they</b> <b>pushed</b> for dear life with all the weight of their bodies, <b>they</b> <b>pushed</b> with all the might of their souls--only no sooner had they succeeded in canting the stem clear of the davit than they would leave off like one man and start a wild scramble into her. As a natural consequence the boat would swing in abruptly, driving them back, helpless and jostling against each other. They would stand nonplussed for a while, exchanging in fierce whispers all the infamous names they could call to mind, and go at it again. Three times this occurred. He described it to me with morose thoughtfulness. He hadn't lost a single movement of that comic business. [...] "I loathed them. I hated them. I had to look at all that," [...] he said without emphasis, turning upon me a sombrely watchful glance. [...] "Was ever there any one so shamefully tried?" ...|$|R
25|$|When a Chinook {{comes in}} when an Arctic air mass is holding steady over the coast, the {{tropical}} dampness brought in suddenly cools, penetrating the frozen air and coming down in volumes of powder snow, sometimes to sea level. Snowfalls {{and the cold}} spells that spawned them only last a few days during a Chinook; as the warm Chinooks blow from the southwest, <b>they</b> <b>push</b> back east the cold Arctic air. The snow melts quickly and is gone within a week.|$|E

25|$|A {{swaging machine}} works by using two or four split dies which {{separate}} and close up to 2000 times a minute. This action {{is achieved by}} mounting the dies into the machine's spindle which is rotated by a motor. The spindle is mounted inside a cage containing rollers (looks like a roller bearing). The rollers are larger than the cage so as the spindle spins the dies are pushed out to ride on the cage by centrifugal force, as the dies cross over the rollers <b>they</b> <b>push</b> the dies together because of their larger size. On a four-die machine, the number of rollers cause all dies to close at a time; {{if the number of}} rollers do not cause all pairs of dies to close at the same time then the machine is called a rotary forging machine, even though it is still a swaging process.|$|E

25|$|The Desert Eagle uses a gas-operated {{mechanism}} normally {{found in}} rifles, {{as opposed to}} the short recoil or blow-back designs most commonly seen in semi-automatic pistols. When a round is fired, gases are ported out through a small hole in the barrel near the breech. These travel forward through a small tube under the barrel, to a cylinder near the front of the barrel. The slide which acts as the bolt carrier has a small piston on the front that fits into this cylinder. When the gases reach the cylinder <b>they</b> <b>push</b> the piston rearward. The slide rides rearward on two rails {{on either side of the}} barrel, both with action springs around them, with a large pin inside the camming surface in the rear of the bolt that causes the bolt to rotate and unlock. A cylindrical mechanism on the left side of the bolt, called the bolt stabilizer assembly, prevents the bolt from rotating freely as the slide moves, enabling it to align correctly with the barrel again as the slide moves it forward. The spring loaded ejector pin is continually being depressed by the case, until the case is free of the chamber and releases tension from the ejector, causing the case to fly out, becoming released from the extractor claw in the process. The slide reaches its rear-most travel, then rides forward again under tension of the springs around the slide rails, the bottom lug of the bolt pushes a new round into the chamber, then the bolt locks up and the gun can be fired again once the trigger is released.|$|E

500|$|Bodie Chandler {{directed}} {{music for}} Quest, and Gary Lionelli, Thomas Chase, Stephen Rucker, Lawrence H.

Composer Guy Moon considered working for the show the [...] "hardest thing I've done in my life" [...] due to the producers' demands for epic music: [...] "They want a big orchestra with a good synth rig... It's great because <b>they</b> <b>push</b> me so much I'll probably replace my whole demo reel with 'Jonny Quest' music... It's hip and it's current." [...] Stephen Rucker and Thomas Chase (who later composed in The Powerpuff Girls) used MIDI to facilitate composing. Chase appreciated the producers' commitment to scoring, noting, [...] "For many kids, animation music is their first exposure to orchestral music." ...|$|E

No one else makes television like them and yet still <b>they</b> <b>push</b> themselves." [...] For Clare Murphy, writing in the Daily Mirror, the episode [...] "makes great use of CCTV split-screen footage". Dessau said that the set-up gave the episode [...] "its haunting flavour". Viewers do not just see Andy, but also streams from other cameras, which, for Dessau, [...] "makes the viewer both intrigued and anxious". Boyd, too, claimed that the episode played on the [...] "inherent creepiness" [...] of CCTV footage. She said that the split-screen set-up increased the tension, and that the [...] "gimmick is a good one"; though it could [...] "have worked well as a pleasing novelty on its own, [...] also makes this 'whodunit'/'who's doing it' a refreshingly inventive take on the genre".|$|E
500|$|On his {{way back}} to his quarters, Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) steps off a turbolift and instead of finding himself in a {{corridor}} onboard the Enterprise, ends up on board a shuttlecraft with Q (John de Lancie) at the controls. Picard demands to be returned to the Enterprise; Q calls him [...] "an impossibly stubborn human" [...] and refuses to take him back until he agrees to at least hear Q's requests. Q then transports them to Ten Forward, where Guinan (Whoopi Goldberg), who recognizes him, warns Picard not to trust him. Q reveals that he wants to join the crew to assist them as <b>they</b> <b>push</b> further into unexplored regions of the galaxy, asserting they are not ready for the threats they will encounter. Picard chooses to make their own way into the unknown, and rejects Q's offer. Irritated by Picard's arrogance, Q snaps his fingers and sends the Enterprise thousands of light years across the galaxy, then disappears. Lt. Commander Data (Brent Spiner) reports that the nearest starbase is over two years away at maximum warp. A fearful Guinan warns Picard to set course for home immediately, but Picard is curious to explore the new area of the galaxy.|$|E
500|$|The stories {{begin with}} the Big Bang, and then moves to the Paleolithic Age, where it is {{revealed}} that Peter's ancestor invented the wheel. The second story sees another Moses {{as a member of}} the Griffin family during the Bronze Age leading the Israelites to freedom. The family soon discovers that Meg can fit through the vent, so they force Meg through the vent and into the kitchen. Peter uses a loud speaker to contact Meg from the panic room, therefore alerting the burglars to the fact that somebody is in the kitchen. In order to take the family's mind off Meg being captured, Peter tells the story of Nate Griffin. Nate lived in the small village of Quahogsuana, but was captured by a white version of Cleveland Brown from South Carolina and taken to the United States. He, along with Quagdingo and Joe Mama, prank the ship captain. While sleeping, <b>they</b> <b>push</b> his bed into the ocean. Nate is caught after briefly escaping and forced to work on a plantation. He falls in love with the owner's daughter, Lois's relatives, and together, they bring up a secret family.
