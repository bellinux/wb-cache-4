5|$|According to some sources, the Poles resented their {{change of}} {{fortunes}} because, before the war, Poles had a privileged position. Then, {{in the space}} of a few days, Jews and other minorities from within Poland occupied positions in the Soviet occupation government—such as teachers, civil servants and engineers—that they allegedly had trouble achieving under the Polish government. What <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> of Poles was occupation and betrayal was, to some Jews—especially Polish communists of Jewish descent who emerged from the underground—an opportunity for revolution and retribution. There were even some extreme cases of Jewish participation in massacres of ethnic Poles such as Massacre of Brzostowica Mała. Such behavior affronted non-Jewish Poles.|$|E

Rare cases of hybridization with little blue herons Egretta caerulea, little egrets Egretta garzetta and snowy egrets Egretta thula have been recorded.|$|E
5|$|During the tour, {{tensions}} sometimes arose {{between the}} senior players, who were war veterans and drinkers, while the younger players including Davidson tended {{to abstain from}} alcohol. Teammate Ian Craig estimated that bus journeys to matches proceeded at an average speed of 16km/h because of persistent stoppages outside pubs, something that frustrated the non-drinkers. In the end, the young players had <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> of the fielding as their older colleagues were often still intoxicated during matches.|$|E
5|$|Hand's civil {{instincts}} were at {{odds with}} the duty of a judge to stay aloof from politics. As a judge he respected even bad laws; as a member of society he felt free to question the decisions behind legislation. In his opinion, members of a democratic society should be involved in legislative decision-making. He therefore regarded toleration as a prerequisite of civil liberty. In practice, this even meant that those who wish to promote ideas repugnant <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> should be free to do so, within broad limits.|$|E

40|$|The current {{research}} investigates how the perceived emotional responses {{of a majority}} of Americans to 9 / 11 (i. e., collective anger and fear) affect individuals’ support for governmental policies, in particular, military intervention, anti-immigration policy, and restricting civil liberties. Study 1 found that perceived collective anger was associated with support for military intervention and anti-immigration policy, and that those effects of perceived collective anger on policy support were significantly driven by individuals’ own anger. Study 2 showed that experimentally manipulated collective anger (i. e., exposure <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority’s</b> anger relative <b>to</b> <b>the</b> minority’s anger) had marginal effects on support for anti-immigration policy and restricting civil liberties, and individuals’ own anger mediated the marginal effect of collective anger on support for restricting civil liberties. Participants exposed <b>to</b> either <b>the</b> <b>majority’s</b> or minority’s fear supported anti-immigration policy and restricting civil liberties as strongly as did those exposed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority’s</b> anger. Implications and limitations of these findings were discussed. ...|$|R

5|$|In 2000, the {{government}} pressed ahead with its Fast Track Land Reform programme, a policy involving compulsory land acquisition aimed at redistributing {{land from the}} minority white population <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> black population. Confiscations of white farmland, continuous droughts, and a serious drop in external finance and other supports led to {{a sharp decline in}} agricultural exports, which were traditionally the country's leading export-producing sector. Some 58,000 independent black farmers have since experienced limited success in reviving the gutted cash crop sectors through efforts on a smaller scale.|$|E
5|$|In May 1645, Parliament {{passed an}} {{ordinance}} allowing excommunicants {{to appeal the}} church's sentences to Parliament. Another ordinance on 20October contained a list of sins to which the church would be limited in its power to excommunicate. <b>To</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> of the divines' dismay, an even more Erastian ordinance was proposed in March 1646. The Assembly published a protest, provoking the Commons to charge it with breach of privilege and to submit nine questions to the divines on the matter. Votes were to be included with the answers, an attempt to force the divines associated with the protest petition to reveal themselves.|$|E
5|$|In a sense, Rule 184 solves this problem, as follows. if Rule 184 is run on {{a finite}} set of cells with {{periodic}} boundary conditions, with an unequal number of 0s and 1s, then each cell will eventually see two consecutive states of the majority value infinitely often, but will see two consecutive states of the minority value only finitely many times. The majority problem cannot be solved perfectly if it is required that all cells eventually stabilize <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> state but the Rule 184 solution avoids this impossibility result by relaxing the criterion by which the automaton recognizes a majority.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to distributing {{the letter to}} the media, Albizu wrote his own, charging that Rhoads was part of a US plot to exterminate Puerto Ricans. He linked the letter to other complaints about American imperialism, saying that the US governors in Puerto Rico encouraged labor emigration rather than improving employment, and promoted birth control, which was offensive <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> Catholic residents. Later that year Governor Beverley struggled with a greater political crisis than the Rhoads letter over his own remarks encouraging birth control use on the island. Residents were outraged and he was removed from office.|$|E
5|$|Like the House of the Lake, most {{houses in}} the crowded Theatre Quarter of Delos have irregular-shaped floor plans (such as {{trapezoidal}} designs), as opposed to square or rectangular designs. The narrow and irregular street grid is unlike that of other quarters, where streets usually meet at approximately right angles. Similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> of excavated homes of Delos, those in the Theatre Quarter feature an open courtyard without porticoes, instead of the peristyle layout with columns. Some of the {{houses in the}} Theatre Quarter lack interior decoration altogether, with neither wall murals nor mosaics, which is unusual for most Delian homes.|$|E
5|$|Part of {{the reason}} for this is the {{extensive}} freeway system in the city, due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> of that system being funded by local, rather than federal funds, through a half-cent general sales tax measure approved by voters in 1985. Another offshoot of this local funding is that Phoenix is the largest city in the United States to have two Interstate Highways but no three-digit interstates.|$|E

5|$|The Tales {{series is}} {{classified}} as a role-playing video game series. Multiple gameplay elements carry over from entry to entry. The main unifying element is the combat system, the Linear Motion Battle System (LMBS for short). Considered {{as one of the}} mainstays and building blocks for every main entry in the series, it undergoes multiple incremental changes and alterations from one installment to the next. Introduced in Phantasia, it is a real-time fighting system similar to a brawler, as opposed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> of RPGs at the time of Phantasias release, which primarily used turn-based battle systems.|$|E
5|$|The design {{approaches}} of Monolith Soft have shifted over its lifetime, with early games such as Xenosaga and Baten Kaitos being distinguished by a narrative-heavy approach, while later titles have {{focused more on}} gameplay. The company's stated goals are to create projects with wide creative freedom and to allow younger developers to contribute to these projects. The company is also notable for its focus on promoting a comfortable working environment with little to no overtime in contrast <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> of other Japanese game developers, alongside collaborating with other studios and companies.|$|E

Post-19th century, most of the devotees of all temples in the complex belong <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> Sinhala Buddhist ethnic group; the temples, excluding the Ayyanayake and the Buddhist temple, are administered by families belonging to the minority Hindu Tamils.|$|E
