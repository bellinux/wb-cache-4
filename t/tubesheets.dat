Many parameters affect the joint integrity such as the initial clearance, wall reduction and material properties. The residual contact stress is the main parameter indicating the strength of the joint. In this paper, the two dimensional planar FE model is established for the tube to <b>tubesheet</b> roller expansion.

50|$|Shell and tube heat {{exchangers}} consist of series of tubes. One set of these tubes contains the fluid {{that must be}} either heated or cooled. The second fluid runs over the tubes that are being heated or cooled {{so that it can}} either provide the heat or absorb the heat required. A set of tubes is called the tube bundle and can be made up of several types of tubes: plain, longitudinally finned, etc. Shell and tube {{heat exchangers}} are typically used for high-pressure applications (with pressures greater than 30 bar and temperatures greater than 260 °C). This is because the shell and tube heat exchangers are robust due to their shape.Several thermal design features must be considered when designing the tubes in the shell and tube heat exchangers:There can be many variations on the shell and tube design.

Typically, the ends of each tube are connected to plenums (sometimes called water boxes) through holes in <b>tubesheets.</b> The tubes may be straight or bent {{in the shape of}} a U, called U-tubes. [...] In nuclear power plants called pressurized water reactors, large heat exchangers called steam generators are two-phase, shell-and-tube heat exchangers which typically have U-tubes. They are used to boil water recycled from a surface condenser into steam to drive a turbine to produce power. Most shell-and-tube heat exchangers are either 1, 2, or 4 pass designs on the tube side. This refers to the number of times the fluid in the tubes passes through the fluid in the shell. In a single pass heat exchanger, the fluid goes in one end of each tube and out the other. [...] Surface condensers in power plants are often 1-pass straight-tube heat exchangers (see Surface condenser for diagram). Two and four pass designs are common because the fluid can enter and exit on the same side. This makes construction much simpler. There are often baffles directing flow through the shell side so the fluid does not take a short cut through the shell side leaving ineffective low flow volumes. These are generally attached to the tube bundle rather than the shell in order that the bundle is still removable for maintenance.|$|E

Validation of the computational {{fluid dynamics}} results was done by comparing then with flow parameters measured in a 1 : 5 scale model of the first pass header in the laboratory. Computational fluid dynamics simulations were used to establish hydrodynamic similarity between the 1 : 5 scale and full scale models of the first pass header. It was found that the erosion-corrosion damage seen at the <b>tubesheet</b> of the first pass header was a consequence of increased levels of turbulence at the <b>tubesheet</b> caused by a rapidly turning flow. A prismatic flow corrections device introduced in the past helped in rectifying the problem at the <b>tubesheet</b> but exaggerated the erosion-corrosion problem at the first pass header shell.
