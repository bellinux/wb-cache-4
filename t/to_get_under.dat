5|$|The British fleet was {{anchored}} off The Rock on 10December 1796 when a storm blew up. Culloden {{was obliged}} <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>under</b> way when her anchors failed to hold, narrowly missing Pearl Rock in the process, and at 21:00, Gibraltar {{was forced to}} cut her cable. As she was attempting to get clear of Cabrita Point at 22:00, her fore topmast snapped and her foresail, mainsail, main topmast staysail, and mizzen staysail tore. Having already lost her main topsail, she became difficult to handle and struck the sandbank several times before being blown across it. By midnight Gibraltar was out of danger and able to ride out the storm, {{and the next day}} at noon she anchored in Tangier Bay. The damage incurred during the storm necessitated her being sent to Plymouth in January 1797. During the repairs, which took until April and cost £12,818, a large piece of rock was removed from her hull. Gibraltar returned to the Mediterranean in July 1797 under Captain William Hancock Kelly.|$|E

Police quickly started to round up known IWW agitators, thus {{depleting}} the ranks of strike leaders and permitting some ships <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>under</b> way. Twelve vessels in the offshore trade, manned by seamen sympathetic to the IWW, suffered the longest delays. The thirty-seven lumber schooners in port were largely manned by non-unionists or members of the Sailors Union. Nevertheless, the cargoes {{of a number of}} them had to be discharged in rotation at the piers by the ships' officers because of the shortage of dockhands.|$|E

The soldiers and transports for the expedition assembled at Annapolis. Embarkation began on January 5, 1862, and on January 9 they began <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>under</b> way, with orders to rendezvous at Fort Monroe, near the entrance to Chesapeake Bay. There they met the naval contingent, and on January 11 they set sail. Until this time, only Burnside and his immediate staff knew their ultimate destination. Once at sea, the captain of each ship opened his sealed orders and learned that his ship should proceed to the vicinity of Cape Hatteras.|$|E

25|$|At {{some point}} {{in the days leading up}} to Survivor Series, however, McMahon began to reconsider that decision. Word of Hart's {{impending}} departure from the company had leaked to fans and wrestling news sources. McMahon was worried that allowing Hart to remain champion after the match at Survivor Series would cause problems and reckoned that Bischoff was still prone to doing anything he could <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>under</b> McMahon's skin and McMahon thought he would be likely to mention the signing of Hart to WCW on Nitro the following night (something Bischoff said would not have happened under normal circumstances). Furthermore, Bischoff would have a one-hour head start on McMahon due to Nitro going on the air live at 8 PM, which would have been more than enough time to announce Hart's WCW arrival. Therefore, McMahon felt, he needed to find a way to get the title off of Hart.|$|E
25|$|British {{engineers}} quickly began {{digging in}} batteries on the hornwork hill, the first battery was finished on 22 September but {{hoping to get}} lucky again, Wellington ordered {{an attack on the}} night of 22/23 September before his guns had fired a shot. Men of the 1st and 6th Divisions rushed forward against the palisades with axes, followed by men with just five ladders to scale the 24 foot wall, they failed to receive the support of other troops and were easily repelled with 150 of the 400 men killed and wounded. The engineers then began digging a mine 60 feet <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>under</b> the fort's west wall. When this was detonated {{in the early hours of}} the 29 September, part of the wall collapsed, the advanced party of British dashed forward but were not supported and were soon driven back from the defences. It turned out that the mine was run under an ancient buried wall that was in front of the modern wall. Consequently, the main French defenses were unscathed by the explosion.|$|E

Difficulties between Lennon and Ono became more and more noticeable around this time. Just as the sessions were <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>under</b> way in June at New York's Record Plant Studios, John and Yoko separated. At Ono's urging, Pang became Lennon's companion and lover in what would become an 18-month relationship later renowned as Lennon's [...] "lost weekend".|$|E
500|$|Larry Fitzmaurice of Pitchfork Media {{gave the}} album {{a score of}} six out of ten, {{describing}} it as [...] "upsettingly uneven". Fitzmaurice felt that Gravity the Seducer represented a transition away {{from the sound of}} band's earlier work, which he felt was still evident in [...] "Ace of Hz" [...] and [...] "Mirage", towards a [...] "floatier, airy feel". Drowned in Sound's John Calvert gave the album a rating of five out of ten, finding it to be [...] "slightly bland" [...] and [...] "nondescript in its understated sophistication".

500|$|Smith, aged 13 at the time, {{signed a}} record-breaking multi-album deal with Universal Classics and Jazz in December 2008, {{six months after}} {{finishing}} outside the top three in the Britain's Got Talent series two final. Her debut album, Faryl, was released in March 2009. Smith later described the album as [...] "an introduction to me and an introduction for me to recording", {{and said that she}} [...] "wanted to follow up [...] as quickly as possible with another record, something richer and varied". In July, it was announced that work had begun on her second album, with hopes to release it later in the year. Smith {{said in an interview that}} [...] "We're starting to look at what songs will be on the second album ... I'm not really choosing the songs myself, I'm leaving that up to the people at the record label.

500|$|After Tuesday Night Music Club, Crow {{wanted to}} prove her {{authority}} as a musician. According to her, [...] "My only objective on this record was <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>under</b> people's skin, because I was feeling like I had so much shit to hurl at the tape." [...] Work on the new album began at Toad Hall in Pasadena, California, the same studio where Tuesday Night Music Club was recorded, but sessions were soon relocated to New Orleans, Louisiana because Crow [...] "was feeling ghosts in that room". Bottrell was designated to produce the record and co-wrote three songs that would appear on the album, but eventually left {{because he could not}} sort out his differences with Crow. As a result, Crow took over production duties and wrote most of the songs alone or with only one collaborator. She also played most of the instruments on the album, including bass and guitar work and nearly all the keyboard parts. Most of the album was recorded at Kingsway Studio in New Orleans, although Crow would later return to Los Angeles to complete work at The Sound Factory and Sunset Sound. Audio mastering took place at Gateway Mastering Studios in Portland, Maine.|$|E

Regan continued, [...] "She knows that to be on top she has to beat Peggy ... So Dottie does want <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>under</b> her skin.

[...] Atwell said, [...] "Peggy has male baddies that she fights, but to have someone who is physically her equal—she's a Black Widow, incredibly capable and very smart—I think that shows some balance for Peggy, like a flip side of the same coin."

500|$|Realizing {{that the}} ABC-UPT deal put DuMont near extinction, network {{officials}} were receptive to a merger offer from ABC. Goldenson quickly brokered {{a deal with}} Ted Bergmann, DuMont's managing director, under which the merged network would have been called [...] "ABC-DuMont" [...] until at least 1958 and would have honored all of DuMont's network commitments. In return, DuMont would get $5 million in cash, guaranteed advertising time for DuMont sets and a secure future for its staff. A merged ABC-DuMont {{would have been a}} colossus rivaling CBS and NBC, as it would have owned stations in five of the six largest U.S. television markets (excluding only Philadelphia) as well as ABC's radio network. It also would have inherited DuMont's de facto monopoly in Pittsburgh, and would have been one of two networks to have full ownership of a station in the nation's capital (the other being NBC). However, it would have had to sell a New York station – either DuMont's WABD or ABC flagship WJZ-TV (channel 7, now WABC-TV), probably the former. It also would have had to sell two other stations – most likely ABC's two smallest O, WXYZ-TV in Detroit and KGO-TV in San Francisco (both broadcasting on channel 7) – <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>under</b> the FCC's limit of five stations per owner.|$|E
500|$|Negative reviews {{included}} Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{who gave}} the film one-and-a-half stars out of four saying: [...] "The movie deserves more stars for its bottom-line craft, but all the craft in the world can't redeem its story." [...] Bob Mondello of NPR said the film was [...] "A sadistic, unmotivated home-invasion flick." [...] Steven Rea of The Philadelphia Inquirer noted that [...] "No one is getting at anything in The Strangers, except the cheapest, ugliest kind of sadistic titillation." [...] Elizabeth Weitzman of the New York Daily News compared the film to 2007's Vacancy - a comparison which [...] "does [...] "Strangers" [...] no favors. Vacancy director Nimród Antal gave us a pair of heroes who fought like hell to survive, becoming closer and stronger in the effort. Bertino's undeveloped protagonists are colossally stupid and frustratingly passive." [...] Stephen Hunter of the Washington Post panned the film, calling it [...] "a fraud from start to finish." [...] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle, said the film [...] "uses cinema to ends that are objectionable and vile," [...] but admitted that [...] "it does it well, with more than usual skill." [...] Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe said of the director, [...] "Bertino has the pretensions of an artist and the indelicacy of a hack. He tries <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>under</b> our skin with a pile driver." [...] Stephen Whitty of The Newark Star-Ledger opined of the film, [...] "Unfolding with an almost startling lack of self-awareness, young filmmaker Bryan Bertino's debut is such a careful, straight-faced knockoff of '70s exploitation films that it plays like a parody." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{period of}} {{stalemate}} followed, {{during which time}} the regiment, {{along with the rest}} of the brigade, rotated between the forward position at Fara and other positions in support and reserve at Kukhari and Marakeb as preparations were made for a future offensive. The regiment's next major action came in October 1917. Conceived as part of an attack towards the Jerusalem to Jaffa line, the regiment took part in the Battle of Beersheba. During this battle, along with the 4th Light Horse Regiment, the 12th Light Horse carried out a successful mounted charge, advancing over open ground late in the afternoon <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>under</b> the Ottoman guns and capture the town and its vital water supplies. Late in the afternoon, the 12th Light Horse Regiment advanced, according to historian Henry Gullett, on a [...] "squadron frontage in three lines" [...] apart, with the 4th Light Horse Regiment to launch a [...] "pure cavalry" [...] charge, the troopers advancing with bayonets in their hands. Advancing over , the light horsemen were subjected to rifle and machine-gun fire and artillery bombardment from the flanks and trenches to their front. Supporting artillery helped suppress the machine-gun fire from the flanks, and the speed of the charge made it difficult for the Ottoman gunners to adjust their range. The Ottoman trenches were not protected with wire and after jumping over the trenches, the light horsemen dismounted and hand-to-hand fighting followed. While most of the 4th Light Horse and some of the 12th Light Horse dismounted, the remainder stayed mounted, continuing their charge into the town. The British official historian claims [...] "more than half the dismounted troops in the town were captured or killed," [...] while 15 of the 28 guns in the town were captured by the Desert Mounted Corps and XX Corps. Over 700 Ottoman soldiers were captured and, more significantly for the Australians, over 400,000 litres of water secured. In achieving this, the 12th lost 24 men killed and 15 wounded; 44 horses were also killed, while another 60 were wounded or became sick.|$|E

500|$|The vacant spot in {{the title}} match ended up going to Matt Morgan, who turned face during Anderson's time away from TNA, {{standing}} up for him against Hardy's, Hogan's, and Bischoff's group Immortal as an advocate {{for the effects of}} concussions. Anderson returned on the December 2 edition of Impact!, chasing Hardy and Fortune out of the ring, before being announced as the special guest referee for the World Heavyweight title match between Hardy and Morgan at Final Resolution. Anderson was bloodied and taken out of the match by Eric Bischoff, who managed to help Hardy retain the title, after a three count made by a replacement referee. On January 9, 2011, at Genesis, Anderson defeated Matt Morgan in a number one contender's match. Immediately afterwards, Eric Bischoff came out, and announced that Anderson would get his title match against Jeff Hardy straight away. After interference from Morgan, Mick Foley, Matt Hardy, Rob Van Dam, and Bischoff, Anderson defeated Hardy to win the TNA World Heavyweight Championship for the first time. On the February 3 edition of Impact!, Anderson defeated Hardy in a rematch for the title, after Fortune turned on Immortal as they were interfering in the match. On February 13 at Against All Odds, Anderson lost the TNA World Heavyweight Championship back to Hardy in a ladder match. On the February 24 edition of Impact!, Anderson defeated Kurt Angle and Rob Van Dam in a three–way match to earn a rematch for the World Heavyweight Championship. Anderson was looking to get his title match on the following edition of Impact!, but it was instead given to the returning Sting, who defeated Hardy to become the new TNA World Heavyweight Champion. On the March 10 edition of Impact!, Anderson attacked Sting backstage, after claiming that he had been screwed out of his title match. In the main event of the evening, Anderson teamed with rival Jeff Hardy in a tag team match against Rob Van Dam and Sting. During the match, Anderson took on more of a role as a tweener by turning on Hardy, before being pinned by Van Dam, following an attack from Sting. On March 13 at Victory Road, Anderson wrestled Rob Van Dam to a double countout in another number one contender's match. On the April 7 edition of Impact!, Anderson feigned joining Immortal, before turning on them and announcing his intention of going after Hulk Hogan next. On April 17 at Lockdown, Anderson failed in his attempt to regain the TNA World Heavyweight Championship from Sting in a three–way steel cage match, which also included Rob Van Dam. On the May 12 edition of Impact!, Anderson defeated 24 other men in a battle royal to earn a shot at the TNA World Heavyweight Championship at Slammiversary IX. In the weeks leading to Slammiversary, Anderson tried <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>under</b> Sting's skin by dressing up like he did in the early '90's during his [...] "surfer" [...] gimmick, attacking Disco Inferno during his own [...] "Scorpion Sitdown" [...] interview segment, and wrestling Eric Young, who was dressed as The Great Muta.|$|E
