40|$|This study {{investigated}} the chromosome ploidy level of Marsupenaeus (Penaeus) japonicus (Bate) non-viable (unhatched) embryos and nauplii after exposure to 6 -dimethylaminopurine (6 -DMAP), <b>timed</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> either polar body (PB) I, or PBI and II extrusion. Embryos from eight separate families or spawnings were exposed to 150 or 200 mu M 6 -DMAP from 1 - to 3 -min post-spawning detection (psd) for a 4 - to 5 -min duration (<b>timed</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> PBI extrusion). Separate aliquots of embryos from five of the same spawnings were also exposed to 200 mu M of 6 -DMAP from 1 - to 3 -min psd for a 16 -min duration (<b>timed</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> both PBI and II extrusion). For one spawning, a third aliquot of embryos was exposed to 400 p M of 6 -DMAP from 1 - to 3 -min psd for a 16 -min duration (<b>timed</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> both PBI and II extrusion). At 18 -h psd, non-viable embryo and nauplii samples were taken separately for fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS). FACS revealed that there were diploids and triploids among all treated non-viable embryos and nauplii. All control non-viable embryos and nauplii were diploid. Percentages of triploid induction for the 4 - to 5 -min and 16 -min durations {{were not significantly different}} (P > 0. 05). Additionally, no difference was found in the triploidy level of nonviable embryos compared to nauplii in these treatments. The percentage of triploid embryos and nauplii when exposed to 6 -DMAP for a 4 - to 5 -min duration ranged from 29. 57 % to 99. 23 % (average 55. 28 +/- 5. 45 %) and from 5. 60 % to 98. 85 % (average 46. 70 +/- 7. 20 %), respectively. The percentage of triploid embryos and nauplii when exposed to 6 -DMAP for a 16 -min duration ranged from 11. 71 % to 98. 96 % (average 52. 49 +/- 11. 00 %) and from 47. 5 % to 99. 24 % (average 79. 38 +/- 5. 24 %), respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first documentation of successful PBI or PBI and II inhibition in shrimp. This study conclusively shows that treatment of M. japonicus embryos with 6 -DMAP at 1 - to 3 -min pscl for either a 4 - to 5 -min duration (<b>timed</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> PBl extrusion) or 16 -min duration (<b>timed</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> both PBI and II extrusion) results in viable triploid nauplii.

5|$|Rukia meets Ichigo in {{the midst}} of a hollow attack. After {{suffering}} her injuries, Rukia transfers her powers to Ichigo in order to save themselves. While he succeeds, Kuchiki is left too weak to return to Soul Society, and lives with Ichigo in the human world, intending to stay until her powers are restored. Therefore, her only ability then is her kidō spells, which are severely limited in strength and variety. She uses her kidō for such purposes as restraining, healing and attacking others. Because of the amount of time she spends with Ichigo, Rukia has been able to gain a keen understanding of his inner workings. Rukia's relationship with Ichigo is unique, for despite the relatively short amount of time they have known each other, Ichigo can easily confide in her and considers her a true friend because she is encouraging and understands what he is feeling. During her time in the human world, Rukia remains unaccounted for in Soul Society, so Byakuya Kuchiki and Renji Abarai are sent to find her and return her to the Soul Society. They succeed, and upon their return Rukia is sentenced to death for giving her Soul Reaper powers to a human.

Alice, Edward's sister, and Bella travel to Italy to save Edward, and arrive just in <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> him.

5|$|In {{a similar}} legend from the Klickitats, {{there was a}} large inland sea between the Cascades and the Rocky Mountains. The Native Americans lived on the sea and each year they would hold two large powwows at Mount Multnomah, one in the spring and one in the fall. The demigod Koyoda Spielei lived among them and settled {{disputes}} among the living things of the earth, including the mountains Pa-toe (Adams) and Yi-east (Hood), sons of the Great Spirit Soclai Tyee. For many years, peace prevailed over the land. Then a beautiful squaw mountain moved to the valley between Pa-toe and Yi-east. She fell in love with Yi-east, but liked to flirt with Pa-toe. This caused the two mountains to quarrel with each other and it quickly escalated into an all out brawl. Ignoring Koyoda’s calls for peace, they belched forth smoke and ash and threw hot rocks at each other. Some time later, they paused for a rest and discovered the catastrophe they had caused. The forests and meadows had been burnt to the ground and many animals and other living things had been killed. The earth had been shaken so severely that a hole had been created in the mountains and the sea had drained away and the Bridge of the Gods was formed. The squaw mountain had hid herself in a cave during the battle and because they could no longer find her, they were about to resume fighting. However, while they had been fighting, Koyoda went to Soclai and told him what was happening. Soclai arrived in <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> them from resuming their quarrel. He decreed that the squaw mountain should remain in the cave forever and the Bridge of the Gods was to be a covenant of peace between the mountains that he would cause to fall if they ever resumed their quarrel. He also placed an ugly old woman, known as Loo-wit, as a mountain to guard the bridge and remind the brothers that beauty is never permanent. After many years, the signs of the great battle and the evidence of the inland sea had disappeared and there was happiness and contentment over the earth. The squaw mountain wished to come out of her cave and grew very lonely. In an effort to ease her loneliness, Soclai sent the Bats, a tribe of beautiful birds, to be her companions. Yi-east eventually learned that the Bats were her guardians and carried out secret communication with the squaw mountain through them. He befriended Loo-wit and crossed the bridge at night to meet with the squaw mountain. One night, he stayed too long and had to hurry to get back to his proper place. He caused the ground to shake so much in his haste that a large rock fell and blocked the entrance to the cave. When Soclai found this, he was furious with the Bats and punished them by turning them into bats that are seen today. He allowed the squaw mountain to remain out of the cave on her promise to be good, but would not allow her and Yi-east to be married, fearing the inevitable quarrel that might start again. He did promise to look for a mate for Pa-toe, hoping this would initiate a lasting peace. However, because of his many duties, he forgot this promise and the two mountains were only held in check by his threats. Eventually, when Soclai was {{in another part of the}} world, they resumed their quarrel and created chaos again. Their violence broke the Bridge of the Gods and destroyed the landscape again. Loo-wit, in her attempts to stop the two brothers, was badly burned and scarred; and when the bridge collapsed, she fell with it. Finally, Pa-toe won the battle and Yi-east admitted defeat. Soclai returned from where he had been, but he was too late to avert the disaster. He found Loo-wit and because she had been faithful in her guardianship, he rewarded her by giving her her greatest desire, youth and beauty. Having received this gift, she moved to the west side of the Cascades and remains there to this day as Mount St. Helens. Since Pa-toe won the battle, the squaw mountain belonged to him. She was heart broken, but took her place at his side. She soon fell at his feet and into a deep sleep from which she never awoke. She is now known as Sleeping Beauty. Pa-toe became so sad that he caused her deep sleep, he lowered his own head in remorse.|$|E
