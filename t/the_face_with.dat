An actual peacock was featured here. In one scene, Liz Lemon sees Argus and is frightened of him. While talking to Jack, Argus hits Liz across <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> his feathers, thus marking her as his mate. To accommodate this, puppeteers—Peter Linz, Noel MacNeal, and Carmen Osbahr—were brought in to hit Liz in <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> feathers instead of using the peacock itself.|$|E

5|$|In the off-season, Cloutier was re-signed to a one-year, $2.5 million {{contract}} on July 15, 2003. Nearly two {{months into the}} subsequent season, Cloutier recorded his 100th career NHL win, making 31 saves in a 3–1 victory over the Ottawa Senators on November 27, 2003. As the season progressed, Cloutier suffered several more injuries, {{the first of which}} was a groin injury in December 2003 that sidelined him for three games. He missed three more games before the season ended with cases of the flu and a lower-body injury. On February 14, 2004, he was fined $1,000 by the league for hitting opposing forward Ronald Petrovický in <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> his blocker during a game against the Atlanta Thrashers.|$|E
5|$|The TNA X Division Championship was {{defended by}} then-champion Petey Williams against Kaz {{in the opening}} contest of the telecast. Williams was {{accompanied}} by Rhaka Khan and Scott Steiner. The duration of the bout was 15 minutes and 19 seconds. Williams wore a protective face mask due to a broken orbital bone. Khan and Steiner interfered in the bout several times. Kaz was legitimately busted open during the match after Williams bashed him in <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> a steel pipe. Williams won the encounter after performing his signature Canadian Destroyer maneuver by slamming Kaz head-first into the mat to retain the TNA X Division Championship. Abyss returned after this match by aiding Kaz who was being attacked by Khan, Steiner, and Williams.|$|E
5|$|The brawl {{began with}} 45.9seconds {{remaining}} in the game, when Indiana led 97–82. The Pistons' Ben Wallace was fouled from behind by the Pacers' Ron Artest (now known as Metta World Peace), who slapped him {{across the back of}} the head during a layup attempt. Wallace later said that Artest had warned him he would be hit. Wallace responded by shoving Artest in <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> both hands, causing players from both teams to quickly get in between them as they attempted to keep Wallace and Artest separated.|$|E

5|$|The {{main event}} was a Six Sides of Steel Weapons {{match for the}} TNA World Heavyweight Championship, pitting the {{champion}} Samoa Joe against the challenger Booker T, who was accompanied by Sharmell. The duration of the contest was 12 minutes and 44 seconds. Early in the bout, Booker T hit Joe in <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> a steel chair, resulting in Joe bleeding from the forehead. Later on, Booker T slammed Joe back-first onto two chairs with his signature Book End maneuver, however, Joe kicked out of a pinfall attempt. Joe gained the pinfall victory to retain the TNA World Heavyweight Championship after bashing Booker T {{over the head with}} a guitar that had appeared in the ring after the lights had suddenly went off and back on.|$|E
5|$|After {{the team}} split, Nitro, {{alongside}} Melina, was quickly placed into the Intercontinental Championship picture, winning the title twice. In November, after serving his suspension {{and a brief}} stint back in OVW, Mercury returned to WWE, reuniting MNM to answer an open challenge put out by The Hardys (Matt and Jeff) for the December to Dismember pay-per-view. At the event, MNM lost to the Hardys. MNM and the Hardys met again at Armageddon {{as part of a}} four-way ladder match, which also included the teams of Dave Taylor and William Regal and Paul London and Brian Kendrick. During the match, which saw London and Kendrick retain the WWE Tag Team Championship, Mercury was legitimately injured when he was struck in <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> a ladder, necessitating a trip to the emergency room where his broken nose received 15 stitches. The facial injury was worked into the angle, and when Mercury returned wearing a protective covering on his face, the rivalry between the teams intensified with MNM actively seeking to injure {{one or both of the}} Hardys, even going so far as to attack and perform a Snapshot on Matt on exposed concrete following a match. MNM lost to The Hardys at the Royal Rumble, and again at the No Way Out pay-per-view in February, which concluded the feud.|$|E
5|$|He {{suffered}} a stress fracture to the pubic bone which {{kept him out}} {{for more than three}} months from November 2007 until he returned to first-team action for Middlesbrough's 2–0 FA Cup victory over Mansfield Town on 26 January 2008. He was sent off in the 80th minute in a match against Arsenal on 15 March 2008 after kicking Gaël Clichy in <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> his boot, which resulted in him receiving a three-match ban. Mido was ruled out {{for the remainder of the}} 2007–08 season in April following a hernia operation on a pelvic injury. He made the bench for Middlesbrough's opening Premier League fixture against former club Tottenham and came on as a substitute in the 82nd minute and scored four minutes later after deflecting Didier Digard's shot. The following weekend saw him score against Liverpool at Anfield to put Middlesbrough 1–0 in the lead, but they eventually lost the game 2–1. This was followed up with goals against Yeovil Town in the League Cup and Portsmouth in the league. Mido was again targeted by some Newcastle fans while warming up before Middlesbrough's 0–0 draw, with claims of racist chanting being investigated by The FA. He revealed his anger at The FA's investigation, believing that they would make no difference to any future abuse. Two men were eventually arrested over the chanting and were due to appear at Teesside Magistrates Court.|$|E

5|$|In 1893 {{at the age}} of 19, Goddard {{left her}} family and went to Paris. She {{extracted}} a meager allowance from her mother, took voice lessons, and for a time sang in a cabaret, before finding out she was pregnant and delivering a baby girl on February 17, 1887. She placed the infant in a convent for care, then travelled to Rome to study art. Goddard was the only female student in her life class, as it was unusual for women to work from nude models. She encountered what would now be called sexual harassment. When a fellow student left a book open on her stool with pornographic passages underlined, she picked it up and hit him in <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> it, but he and his friends stalked her. She fled to Capri after he tried to force her to marry him.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1863, the XII Corps was {{transferred}} to the West to reinforce the Union forces besieged at Chattanooga. At the Battle of Wauhatchie, during a surprise night attack by the Confederate forces, Greene was wounded in <b>the</b> <b>face,</b> <b>with</b> his jaw crushed and some teeth carried away. Subsequent surgery was not able to correct his condition and he suffered from the effects of his wound {{for the rest of his}} life. After six weeks of medical leave, he was assigned to light court-martial duty until January 1865, when he was sent to join Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman's army in North Carolina. Initially Greene voluntarily served on the staff of Maj. Gen. Jacob D. Cox participating in the battle at Kinston, where he had his horse shot out from under him. At the very end of the war Greene was in command of the 3rd Brigade in Absalom Baird's 3rd Division, XIV Corps, and participated in the capture of Raleigh and the pursuit of Gen. Joseph E. Johnston's army until its surrender.|$|E
5|$|The NWA World Heavyweight Championship was defended in a Raven's Rules match by Raven against Rhino in {{the eighth}} {{encounter}} on the card. A contest conducted under Raven's Rules means there are no count-outs or no disqualifications, and weapons are provided for the environment; {{the only way to}} win is by pinfall or submission. Raven used a pizza cutter early on in the bout to cut open Rhino's forehead, causing him to bleed heavily. Later, Raven's forehead was also cut open due to being hit by a trashcan. Rhino used a staple gun during the contest; Rhino placed several staples in Raven's forehead. Cassidy Riley, Jeff Hardy, and Jeff Jarrett interfered in the bout. Riley interfered by accidentally distracting the referee during a pin attempt by Raven, whom Riley was attempting to aid. Jarrett came down to the ring near the end trying to bash Raven in <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> the NWA World Heavyweight Championship belt, but was stopped by Hardy. Raven then performed his signature Raven Effect DDT maneuver on Jarrett, forcing his head into the ring mat. Afterwards, Raven performed the Raven Effect DDT on Rhino and covered for the pinfall victory to retain the NWA World Heavyweight Championship at 14 minutes and 28 seconds.|$|E

5|$|The TNA X Division Championship was {{defended by}} A.J. Styles against Samoa Joe next. Styles' mouth was busted open during the bout. The two wrestlers fought at ringside {{during the opening}} minutes before {{entering}} the ring. Back in the ring Joe and Styles fought {{back and forth with}} each trading near-falls. Finally, Styles slammed Joe face-first into the mat with his signature Styles Clash maneuver. Joe kicked out of the following pin, leading to an exchange which allowed Joe to place Styles in his signature Coquina Clutch submission hold. After a brief period of time, Styles passed out and the referee awarded Joe the victory and thus became the new TNA X Division Champion at 18 minutes and 58 seconds in. After the match, Joe bashed Styles in <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> the TNA X Division Championship belt and then set up to slam him on a steel chair in the ring but was foalied by Christopher Daniels coming to Styles' defense. A brawl ensued between Joe and Daniels, leading to security breaking it up.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} was a tag team match pitting {{the team of}} Christian Cage and Sting against the team of Jeff Jarrett and Monty Brown. The {{duration}} of the encounter was 15 minutes and 35 seconds. Jarrett was accompanied by Gail Kim. Cage and Brown started the match before they both quickly tagged in their partners. Kim interfered by distracting the referee, allowing Jarrett to hit Cage in the groin and throw him to the ringside mat. Kim then assaulted Cage in the ringside area. After several minutes of Jarrett and Brown having the advantage over a beaten Cage, Sting was tagged into the match and placed Jarrett in his signature Scorpion Deathlock submission maneuver. Jarrett submitted to the maneuver, but the referee was unconscious. Team Canada then interfered in the bout, attacking Cage and Sting. Jarrett bashed Sting in <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> the NWA World Heavyweight Championship belt and covered for a near-fall once the referee regained consciousness. Afterwards, Sting forced Jarrett's head into the ring mat with his trademark Scorpion Death Drop maneuver and covered for the pinfall victory.|$|E
5|$|The {{match between}} Jerry Lawler's team, known as The Royal Family (with Queasy, Sleazy, and Cheesy), and Doink's Clowns R' Us team (with Dink, Wink, and Pink) {{consisted}} of comedic action {{for much of}} the first ten minutes. Eventually, Doink attempted a crossbody, but Lawler reversed the move. He was able to pin Doink and eliminate him from the match. Lawler remained involved in the match and {{played a role in the}} elimination of two more members of Doink's team. When Wink attempted a monkey flip against Queasy, Lawler blocked the move and helped Queasy to pin Wink. Later in the match, Lawler threw Cheesy on top of Pink, which enabled Cheesy to eliminate another of Doink's teammates. After Wink and Pink were eliminated, however, they hid under the ring rather than returning backstage. The final member of Clowns R' Us was eliminated after Sleazy and Dink fought in the ring. Dink performed a crossbody on Sleazy and attempted to pin him. Queasy rolled the wrestlers over so that Sleazy was on top, however, and the referee made the three count and awarded the match to The Royal Family. As Queasy, Sleazy and Cheesy celebrated after the match, Lawler criticized them for taking credit for the victory. Dink, Pink, and Wink emerged from under the ring. All six midgets turned against Lawler and chased him away from the ring. As Lawler tried to escape, Doink returned and hit him in <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> a pie.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{rotation}} invariant multiview face detection method based on Real Adaboost algorithm [1]. Human faces {{are divided into}} several categories according to the variant appearance from different view points. For each view category, weak classifiers are configured as confidence-rated look-uptable (LUT) of Haar feature [2]. Real Adaboost algorithm is used to boost these weak classifiers and construct a nesting-structured face detector. To make it rotation invariant, we divide the whole 360 -degree range into 12 sub-ranges and construct their corresponding view based detectors separately. To improve performance, a pose estimation method is introduced and results in a processing speed of four frames per second on 320 × 240 sized image. Experiments on <b>faces</b> <b>with</b> 360 -degree inplane rotation and ± 90 -degree out-of-plane rotation are reported, of which <b>the</b> frontal <b>face</b> detector subsystem retrieves 94. 5 % of <b>the</b> <b>faces</b> <b>with</b> 57 false alarms on <b>the</b> CMU+MIT frontal <b>face</b> test set and <b>the</b> multi-view <b>face</b> detector subsystem retrieves 89. 8 % of <b>the</b> <b>faces</b> <b>with</b> 221 false alarms on <b>the</b> CMU profile <b>face</b> test set. 1...|$|R
5|$|The {{second half}} of extra time began with yet another chance for Manchester United, this time {{constructed}} from a Giggs break down the left wing, but Van Nistelrooy failed {{in his attempt to}} back-heel Giggs' cross into the goal and the opportunity was wasted. Five minutes into the second half, Reyes committed another late tackle on Silvestre, for which he received a final warning from referee Styles. Reyes himself was then the victim of a late tackle by Scholes, who was shown a yellow card. The match threatened to descend into a mass brawl soon after, when Fortune caught Ljungberg in <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> a flailing arm and then committed a high tackle on Edu, provoking a reaction from the Arsenal players. A shoulder-charge by Rooney on Cole resulted in an Arsenal free kick on the left wing; Van Persie swung the ball over and it was only cleared as far as Ljungberg, but the Swede struck a shot with his shin and the ball spun wide. With a couple of minutes left in the extra period, Manchester United won a free kick on the left corner of the Arsenal penalty area when Vieira lazily tripped Ronaldo and received a booking, but Giggs' cross from the free kick was headed away. Meanwhile, Manchester United's substitute goalkeeper, Howard, was seen warming up behind the goal, suggesting that he was preparing to come on for Carroll {{in the event of a}} penalty shootout; however, no substitution was made.|$|E
5|$|The tournament final between A.J. Styles and Samoa Joe {{took place}} on August14 at Sacrifice. As Styles laid against the ring ropes at the {{beginning}} of the match, Joe ran across the ring and kicked him in the face, causing him to fly out of the ring and crash down on the floor. Joe followed by diving through the ring ropes and smashing Styles in <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> his forearm as Styles reached his feet. Joe later held Styles in an STF submission hold, which he was forced to release when Styles touched the bottom rope. Styles then gained the advantage with a dropkick and front-flip splash from the ring ropes. He held Joe on his shoulders before twisting him off into a powerbomb, or what he calls a Rack Bomb. During the move, referee Andrew Thomas was kicked in the face and knocked unconscious, allowing Daniels to interfere in the contest. Daniels attacked Styles and attempted to hit Joe with the X Division Title belt before Styles threw Daniels from the ring. Joe followed by lifting Styles up and performing his Muscle Buster maneuver, then placing Styles in his Coquina Clutch submission hold. Styles submitted to the move as the referee came to, giving the victory to Joe. The final bout lasted 15 minutes and 15 seconds.|$|E
5|$|Another rivalry {{leading up}} to the event was between Johnny Nitro and Jeff Hardy. In September 2006, Hardy {{challenged}} Nitro numerous times for the WWE Intercontinental Championship, but failed to win it due to repeated interference by Melina (Melina Perez) (Nitro's then-girlfriend). Hardy finally defeated Nitro to win the title on the October 2 edition of Raw. On the November 6 edition of Raw, Eric Bischoff, the Raw authority figure for the night, scheduled a match between Hardy and Nitro for the title. In the match, Melina interfered and caused Nitro to get disqualified. Due to WWE rules, a title can only change hands via pinfall or submission, as a result, Hardy retained his title. Bischoff then scheduled a No Disqualification match, which Nitro won after interference from Melina. The following week, Hardy and Nitro were scheduled in a Ladder match, a match where the contestant that climbs a ladder and retrieves an item (usually a title belt) hung above the ring is the winner. Hardy won the match and the title. On the November 27 episode of Raw, Nitro and his former tag team partner Joey Mercury, as MNM, accepted The Hardys open challenge for WWE's December pay-per-view, December to Dismember, which the Hardys came out victorious. The Hardys won the match. At Armageddon another one of WWE's December pay-per-views, MNM and The Hardys competed in a Four team Ladder match also involving Dave Taylor and William Regal and WWE Tag Team Champions Paul London and Brian Kendrick. London and Kendrick won the match and retained their titles. During the match, Mercury legitimately broke his nose when he was struck in <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> a ladder, when Jeff jumped off the top rope. On the December 18 edition of Raw, Nitro challenged Hardy to a Steel Cage match, a match fought within a cage formed by placing four sheets of mesh metal around, in, or against the edges of the wrestling ring, for the Intercontinental Championship, which Hardy accepted. The match then was scheduled for New Year's Revolution.|$|E
