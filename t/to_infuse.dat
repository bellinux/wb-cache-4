5|$|After his {{two and a}} {{half years}} of training, Naruto returns to Konoha and begins to deal more {{actively}} with the Akatsuki threat by saving Gaara from their clutches. To fight them, Naruto trains with Kakashi <b>to</b> <b>infuse</b> the Rasengan with his own wind-element chakra, creating the Rasen-Shuriken attack that proves instrumental in the downfall of the Akatsuki member Kakuzu. Despite being targeted by the Akatsuki, Naruto dedicates himself to finding and retrieving Sasuke; he eventually disposes of Orochimaru and starts acting on his vengeance-driven whims. Over time, though resisting the urge to use the creature's power, the Nine Tails's influence over him expands to the point where he begins to lose his rationality as more chakra manifests in the form of tails to the point the Tailed Beast can take control of his body. This ultimately causes him to go on a rampage, destroying everything in his path.|$|E
5|$|Kratos, the new God of War, {{is still}} haunted by nightmares {{of his past}} and is shunned by the other gods for his {{destructive}} ways. Ignoring Athena's warnings, Kratos joins the Spartan army in an attack on Rhodes, during which a giant eagle suddenly drains him of his powers and animates the Colossus of Rhodes. While battling the statue, Zeus offers Kratos the Blade of Olympus in order to defeat it, requiring Kratos <b>to</b> <b>infuse</b> the blade with {{the remainder of his}} godly power. Although now human, Kratos defeats the Colossus but is mortally wounded. The eagle reveals itself to have been Zeus all along, who states he was forced to intervene as Athena refused to do so. Zeus then grants Kratos a final opportunity to be loyal to the gods, but Kratos refuses. Zeus kills him with the blade and destroys the Spartan army.|$|E

5|$|Seeing all the singers, {{you really}} {{come face to}} face with a lot of people that are {{predominantly}} younger. That's inspiring, because they come up to you and they're such big fans and they share with you what song touched them the most and how they had to learn every single ad lib and dissect it. As a vocalist it brought me back to, 'Yeah, that's what I used to do to my Whitney Houston record and my Mariah Carey record and my Etta James record.' It brings you back to a place where it becomes your personal responsibility <b>to</b> <b>infuse</b> the next generation with more information about learning every intricate note. That's why a song called 'Sing for Me' is a special song. It's one of those singer's songs where if you're not a vocalist you can't mess with that song.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that ra'ss positive, palatability-dependent consummatory {{reactions}} <b>to</b> <b>infused</b> tastes are selectively facilitated by a benzodiazepine agonist (chlordiazepoxide), and that this effect can be blocked by the coadministration of benzodiazepine antagonists (e. g., Ro 15 - 1788). The {{purpose of the present study}} was to determine whether agents acting at other receptor sites (dopaminergic, serotonergic), which have been shown to modulate food consumption, might also modify rats' palatability-dependent reactivity <b>to</b> <b>infused</b> tastes. In this experiment, the benzodiazepine agonist, diazepam, facilitated positive palatability reactions, while dopaminergic agents (haloperidol, apomorphine, amphetamine) had no significant effects on either positive or aversive reactions. The putative 5 -HT 1 A agonists, buspirone and gepirone, had a general inhibitory action on both positive and aversive palatability reactions. These results are surprising in view of the effects of serotonergic and dopaminergic agents on food and fluid intake. Our results suggest that the benzodiazepine receptor system may play a special role in the neural control of appetite through its enhancement of the positive palatability of tastes. Dopamine systems, by contrast, appear to control food intake by modulating processes that are independent of food affect evaluation...|$|R

25|$|Due to {{the absence}} of {{contemporary}} culinary utensils such as the refrigerator, gas stovetops and ovens, the Indigenous resorted to other means to prepare their food. Upon bringing back hunted game meat, the Aborigines would preserve the meat with either millet wine or salt. Another cooking technique involved the heating up of stones by fire, which are then placed inside a vessel with other certain meats and seafood, which are cooked from the heat of the stones. Foods were mostly prepared by steaming, boiling or roasting, in order <b>to</b> <b>infuse</b> flavours together, yet preserve the original flavours. This again is contrasted with the Han, who adopted skills like stir-frying and stewing. Meat was also put on a bamboo spit and cooked over the fire.|$|E

Peggy Goldwater reportedly hoped that her husband's Senate term, due to end in January 1981, would be his last. Goldwater decided to run, planning to make the term his last in the Senate. Goldwater faced a surprisingly tough battle for reelection. He was viewed by some as out of touch and vulnerable for several reasons; most importantly, because {{he had planned to}} retire in 1981, Goldwater had not visited many areas of Arizona outside of Phoenix and Tucson. He was also challenged by a formidable opponent, Bill Schulz, a former Republican turned Democrat and a wealthy real estate developer.

25|$|Sex is a {{basic form}} of {{communication}} in bonobos’ life. It seems <b>to</b> <b>infuse</b> everything from simple expressions of affection {{to the establishment of}} dominance. Female bonobos have been observed to engage in sexual activities to create bonds with dominant bonobos. Having created this bond with the male, they will share food with each other and not compete with each other. All members of the group are potential sex partners, males participate in sexual activity with other males, as do females with other females. These bonds made between females are for protection against male bonobos. If a male bonobo attempts to harass a female bonobo, the other females will help the female defend herself because of the strong bonds they have with each other.|$|E

40|$|Although large {{quantities}} of glutamate {{are found in the}} carotid body, to date this excitatory neurotransmitter has not been assigned a role in chemoreception. To examine the possibility that glutamate and its NMDA receptors play a role in acclimatization after exposure to cyclic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) we exposed male Sprague-Dawley rats to cyclic hypoxia or to room air sham (Sham) for 8 hours/d for 3 weeks. Using reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR), Western Blot and immunohistochemistry, we found that ionotropic NMDA receptors including NMDAR 1, NMDAR 2 A, NMDAR 2 A/ 2 B are strongly expressed in the carotid body and co-localize with tyrosine hydroxylase in glomus cells. CIH exposure enhanced the expression of NMDAR 1 and NMDAR 2 A/ 2 B, but did not substantially change the level of NMDAR 2 A. We assessed in vivo carotid sinus nerve activity (CSNA) at baseline, in response to acute hypoxia, in response <b>to</b> <b>infused</b> NMDA, and in response <b>to</b> <b>infused</b> endothelin- 1 (ET- 1) with and without MK 801, an NMDA receptor blocker.

25|$|As soon as {{she assumed}} the {{presidency}} of the Philippines, Aquino moved quickly to tackle the issue of the US$28 billion-foreign debt incurred by her predecessor, which has badly tarnished the international credit standing and economic reputation of the country. After weighing all possible options such as choosing not to pay, Aquino eventually chose to honor all the debts that were previously incurred in order to clear the country's image. Her decision proved to be unpopular but Aquino defended that it was the most practical move. It was crucial for the country at that time to regain the investors' confidence in the Philippine economy. Beginning in 1986, the Aquino administration paid off $4 billion of the country's outstanding debts to regain good international credit ratings and attract the attention of future markets. Although it borrowed an additional $9 billion, increasing the net national debt by $5 billion within six years after the ouster of former President Ferdinand Marcos in 1986, due to the need <b>to</b> <b>infuse</b> capital and money into the economy, the Aquino administration succeeded in wrangling lower interest rates and longer payment terms in settling the country's debts. From 87.9 percent when it inherited the foreign debt from the Marcos regime, the Cory Aquino administration was able to reduce by 30.1 percent the Philippines' external debt-to-GDP ratio to 67.8 percent in 1991.|$|E
25|$|Although Behn assures {{that she}} is not looking to {{entertain}} her reader with the adventures of a feigned hero, she does exactly this to enhance and romanticize the stories of Oroonoko. Ramesh Mallipeddi stresses that spectacle was the main mediator for the representation of alien cultures in Restoration England. Therefore, Behn describes Oroonoko’s native beauty as a spectacle of 'beauty so transcending' that surpassed 'all those of his gloomy race'. She completely romanticizes Oroonoko’s figure by portraying him as an ideal handsome hero; however due to the color of his skin, his body is still constricted within the limits of exoticism. Oroonoko has all the qualities of an English royal, but his ebony skin and country of origin prevent him from being a reputable European citizen. Due to these foreign qualities, his Englishness is incomplete. He has the English-like education and air, but lacks the skin color and legal status. Behn uses this conflicting description of Oroonoko <b>to</b> <b>infuse</b> some European familiarity into his figure while still remaining exotic enough. She compares Oroonoko to well-known historical figures like Hannibal and Alexander and describes Oroonoko’s running, wrestling and killing of tigers and snakes. Albert J. Rivero states that this comparison to great Western conquerors and kings translates and naturalizes Oroonoko’s foreignness into familiar European narratives. These historical allusions and romantic gallant feats allowed English readers to relate this exotic character with their own Western history and narrative tradition.|$|E
