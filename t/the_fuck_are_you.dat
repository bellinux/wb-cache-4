5000|$|While he has {{frequently}} been disappointed by these adaptations (such as Cop), {{he was very}} complimentary of Curtis Hanson and Brian Helgeland's screenplay for L.A. Confidential {{at the time of}} its release. In succeeding years, however, his comments have been more reserved:L.A. Confidential, the movie, is the best thing that happened to me in my career that I had absolutely nothing to do with. It was a fluke - and a wonderful one - and it is never going to happen again - a movie of that quality.Here’s my final comment on L.A. Confidential, the movie: I go to a video store in Prairie Village, Kansas. The youngsters who work there know me as the guy who wrote L.A. Confidential. They tell all the little old ladies who come in there to get their G-rated family flick. They come up to me, they say, “OOOO… you wrote L.A. Confidential.... Oh, what a wonderful, wonderful movie. I saw it four times. You don’t see storytelling like that on the screen anymore.” ... I smile, I say, “Yes, it’s a wonderful movie, and a salutary adaptation of my wonderful novel. But listen, Granny: You love the movie. Did you go out and buy the book?” And Granny invariably says, “Well, no, I didn’t.” And I say to Granny, “Then what <b>the</b> <b>fuck</b> good <b>are</b> <b>you</b> to me?” ...|$|R

He goes to the graveyard and digs up the woman's grave, and then takes the woman's zombie-like carcass to parties, restaurants and barbecues. His band-mates, friends and other bystanders take great amusement in the slapstick humor that ensues. Throughout the video, Shultz accidentally grills her face and loses her arm. At {{the end of the}} video, it is revealed that Shultz was dreaming. After he wakes, he actually goes to the graveyard and digs up the grave.

5000|$|The Eclipse {{commercial}} was in turn parodied by a skit on Chappelle's Show {{in which}} Dave Chappelle is {{driving a car}} and the woman is dancing in the passenger seat.

5000|$|The {{incident}} was parodied at the 2009 Country Music Association Awards, in which after Swift won {{the award for}} Music Video of the Year, Carrie Underwood, who was hosting the awards with Brad Paisley, told Paisley that she thought his video for [...] "Welcome to the Future" [...] was a great video as well. Paisley thanked her and then thanked his producers for the video, at which time singer Little Jimmy Dickens stepped {{on the stage and}} pushed Brad Paisley away from the microphone, saying, [...] "Excuse me. Excuse me, sir. Excuse me, I'll let you finish later. Now, Brad Paisley, I know you had a nice video and all that, but Taylor Swift had the best video of all time. You go girl!" [...] Swift laughed in her seat. Paisley then remarked, [...] "What kind of security do we have if a 4'9" [...] 88-year-old man gets by it?" [...] Earlier in the awards show, Underwood and Paisley's monologue was a duet paying tribute to the song [...] "Mamas Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys", in which the first line was [...] "Mamas, don't let your babies grow up to be Kanye". Additionally, when Taylor Swift hosted Saturday Night Live, one part of her monologue (which was done {{in the form of a}} song ostensibly about all the things that she was not going to talk about) included Bill Hader and Jason Sudeikis as security men charged with preventing Kanye West from coming on stage. She closed her monologue by saying [...] "Kanye West is not here." [...] Additionally when Taylor Lautner, who then was rumored to be dating Swift, hosted SNL, in his monologue he beats up a cardboard cutout of West. The incident is also referenced in Eminem's single [...] "No Love", which he says [...] "Man, get these whack cocksuckers off stage/where <b>the</b> <b>fuck</b> <b>is</b> Kanye when <b>you</b> need him?/Snatch the mic from 'em, bitch, I'mma let you finish in a minute, yeah/the rap was tight/But I'm 'bout to spit the greatest verse of all time".|$|R

Concurrently, Dennis Wilson worked on his solo album Pacific Ocean Blue which would not see a release until later in September. According to the band's manager Stan Love—also the younger brother of the Beach Boys' Mike Love—when Mike heard the rough demo recordings of Adult Child replete with big band swing arrangements, he turned to Brian and asked: [...] "What <b>the</b> <b>fuck</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> doing?"
