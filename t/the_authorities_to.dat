5|$|As a result, the {{memorial}} stone became {{the memorial}} itself. The monument was later moved by <b>the</b> <b>authorities</b> <b>to</b> {{make way for}} the gentrification of the Fullerton Building, and was relocated to the National Archives of Singapore, where it stands almost forgotten today. The authorities hope that when Singapore's community of values had evolved to the point that a common language of art could be used to complete the task of building such a monument again.|$|E

5|$|At 9:00pm three Guards regiments {{arrived on}} the scene. Although the troops {{assisted}} in crowd control, their arrival was also a reaction of <b>the</b> <b>authorities</b> <b>to</b> fears of a possible insurrection, for which the destruction of parliament could have signalled the first step. The three European revolutions of 1830—the French, Belgian and Polish actions—were still of concern, as were the unrest from the Captain Swing riots, and the recent passing of the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834, which altered the relief provided by the workhouse system.|$|E
5|$|Police visited Brady {{in prison}} again {{and told him}} of Hindley's confession, which at first he refused to believe.

5|$|The {{bridge was}} narrow and {{structurally}} unsound, leading <b>the</b> <b>authorities</b> <b>to</b> rename it Chelsea Bridge {{to avoid the}} Royal Family's association with a potential collapse. In 1926 it was proposed that the old bridge be rebuilt or replaced, due to the increased volume of users from population growth, {{and the introduction of}} the automobile. It was demolished during 1934–1937, and replaced by the current structure, which opened in 1937.|$|E
5|$|According to Brackman, {{several days}} after the robbery the Okhrana agent Mukhtarov {{questioned}} Stalin in a secret apartment. The agents had heard rumors that Stalin had been seen watching passively during the robbery. Mukhtarov asked Stalin why he had not informed them about it, and Stalin stated that he had provided adequate information to <b>the</b> <b>authorities</b> <b>to</b> prevent the theft. The questioning escalated into a heated argument; Mukhtarov hit Stalin {{in the face and}} had to be restrained by other Okhrana officers. After this incident, Mukhtarov was suspended from the Okhrana, and Stalin was ordered to leave Tiflis and go to Baku to await a decision in the case. Stalin left Baku with 20,000rubles in stolen money in July 1907. While Brackman claims to have found evidence of this incident, whether Stalin cooperated with the Okhrana during his early life has been a subject of debate among historians for many decades and has yet to be resolved.|$|E
5|$|After a 17-month trial, {{the often}} tumultuous {{proceedings}} {{ended with a}} guilty verdict on July 8, 1912. The defendants, including 27 leading Camorra bosses, were sentenced {{to a total of}} 354 years' imprisonment. The main defendants Enrico Alfano and Giovanni Rapi were sentenced to 30 years. The priest Vitozzi received seven years and government witness Abbatemaggio five years. The jury had been held in isolation since March 1911. The reports of the proceedings were about 40,000 pages in 63 volumes. In his last statement before the verdict, a furious Alfano accused <b>the</b> <b>authorities</b> <b>to</b> have killed his brother Ciro, who had died in prison. Another defendant, Gennaro De Marinas, who was sentenced to 30 years as well, slashed his throat with a piece of glass in the Court when the verdict was delivered.|$|E
5000|$|A medical {{psychologist}} who holds prescriptive authority for specific psychiatric medications and other pharmaceutical drugs must first obtain specific qualifications in Psychopharmacology.

5|$|Complaints lodged to the {{authorities}} against Mansur ultimately led to his dismissal in 1579. He was replaced with his son Muhammad. Mansur died in 1580. According to Duwayhi, Muhammad was alleged by <b>the</b> <b>authorities</b> <b>to</b> {{have participated in the}} looting of an Istanbul-bound caravan from Egypt while it was passing through the Akkar and was consequently imprisoned in Istanbul. However, Ottoman sources mention that the caravan arrived safely in Istanbul and that the commander of the caravan, Ibrahim Pasha, backed by a 20,000-strong army, arrested Muhammad and Qurqumaz Ma'an while suppressing rebel activity in Mount Lebanon en route to Istanbul. About a year later, Muhammad was released and assigned the tax farm for Tripoli Eyalet's rural districts, not including Tripoli itself, which remained under Yusuf Sayfa. The Ottoman authorities were content with Muhammad's rule, but were vexed by the Maronites in his retinue.|$|E
5|$|Following Wyatt's rebellion, Guildford Dudley was {{beheaded}} on 12 February 1554 {{shortly before}} his wife. Knowing the Queen's character, in June 1554 Jane Dudley pleaded with <b>the</b> <b>authorities</b> <b>to</b> allow her remaining sons to hear mass. During 1554 the Duchess and her son-in-law Henry Sidney worked hard pleading with the Spanish nobles around England's new king consort, Philip of Spain. Lord Paget may also have proved helpful, and Henry Sidney even travelled to Spain in their cause. In the autumn of 1554 the Dudley brothers were released from the Tower, though the eldest, John, died immediately afterwards at Sidney's house Penshurst in Kent. At the same location Philip Sidney was born on 30 November 1554. His godmother was his grandmother Jane Dudley, while his godfather was Philip of Spain.|$|E
50|$|After the {{ratification}} of the present constitution dated on 7 August 2008, within the democratic movement in the government everything had revolved. The centralized system of the government had changed into a decentralized system. Local governments were formed {{in the name of}} local councils. Councilors were elected by the people of the island.

Councilors got <b>the</b> ful <b>authority</b> <b>to</b> decide what to do for their island and the people.

The Sublime Porte also seized {{property}} belonging to Zahir, his sons and Sabbagh, which valued at 41,500,000 piasters. They were imprisoned in Istanbul, the Ottoman capital {{along with their}} physician, who {{was known to be}} talented in his profession. The physician was summoned by the sultan to treat his wife's ailment, which he did successfully, earning him his freedom from incarceration and a medal of honor from the sultan. The physician used his influence with <b>the</b> <b>authorities</b> <b>to</b> have Zahir's children and grandchildren released and returned to their hometowns. Sabbagh was executed by Hasan Pasha. Al-Dinkizli was rewarded with the governorship of Gaza, but died on the way to his new headquarters, likely having been poisoned by Hasan.|$|E

5|$|In France, {{news of the}} {{situation}} in the West Indies forced <b>the</b> <b>authorities</b> <b>to</b> take action. During the autumn of 1808, a number of ships were despatched carrying much needed food and military supplies, but several were intercepted, including the frigate Thétis, captured during the Action of 10 November 1808 in the Bay of Biscay. Despite the losses, some ships did reach their destination intact and further supply ships were prepared, including the frigate Topaze, ordered to transport 1,100 barrels of flour to Cayenne. The cargo was loaded during late November and early December, the frigate also carrying military supplies and 100 soldiers to augment the Cayenne garrison. The ship, under the command of Captain Pierre-Nicolas Lahalle, was only three years old and carried 40 heavy guns.|$|E

5|$|In May 1890, Maria—who {{retained}} societal {{influence as}} {{the widow of}} a nobleman—persuaded <b>the</b> <b>authorities</b> <b>to</b> allow Lenin to take his exams externally at the University of St Petersburg, where he obtained {{the equivalent of a}} first-class degree with honours. The graduation celebrations were marred when his sister Olga died of typhoid. Lenin remained in Samara for several years, working first as a legal assistant for a regional court and then for a local lawyer. He devoted much time to radical politics, remaining active in Skylarenko's group and formulating ideas about how Marxism applied to Russia. Inspired by Plekhanov's work, Lenin collected data on Russian society, using it to support a Marxist interpretation of societal development and counter the claims of the Narodniks. He wrote a paper on peasant economics; it was rejected by the liberal journal Russian Thought.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} days of January, 1894 a meeting of the Central Committee of the Fasci took place in Palermo to discuss the {{position}} of the movement. Two sharply contrasting positions emerged. De Felice Giuffrida, known for his anarchist tendencies, supported the need {{to take advantage of the}} situation of unrest to provoke a revolution on the island. However, the majority took an opposite view, arguing the need to proceed peacefully. A revolt was not only inappropriate, but it would be detrimental to the movement. The meeting condemned the violent incidents in various parts of the island, and launched an appeal to stay calm and not to retaliate. In the end De Felice Giuffrida accepted the position of the majority. But the die was cast for <b>the</b> <b>authorities</b> <b>to</b> arrest De Felice, Montalto, Petrina, and others. Garibaldi Bosco, Barbato and Verro were arrested on board the steamship Bagnara that was about to leave for Tunis.|$|E

After {{being allowed to}} change his clothes, Quwatli was taken by <b>the</b> <b>authorities</b> <b>to</b> the city's Mezzeh Prison. Prime Minister al-Azm was also arrested.
