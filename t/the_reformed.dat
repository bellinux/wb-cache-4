5|$|Scholars have {{increasingly}} {{recognized the importance}} of figures other than John Calvin and Huldrych Zwingli in the early formation of <b>the</b> <b>Reformed</b> tradition. Richard Muller, a chief authority on the development of this movement, has argued that Vermigli, Wolfgang Musculus, and Heinrich Bullinger were as influential if not more influential than Calvin on the development of Reformed theology in the sixteenth century. Vermigli was a transitional figure between the Reformation period and the period known as Reformed orthodoxy. In <b>the</b> <b>Reformed</b> orthodox period, the theology first articulated by Reformation figures was codified and systematized. Theologians increasingly resorted to the methods of scholastic theology and the tradition of Aristotelianism. Vermigli was the first of <b>the</b> <b>Reformed</b> scholastic theologians, and he influenced later scholastics Theodore Beza and Girolamo Zanchi.|$|E
5|$|The Assembly {{worked in}} <b>the</b> <b>Reformed</b> Protestant {{theological}} tradition, {{also known as}} Calvinism. It took the Bible as the authoritative word of God, from which all theological reflection must be based. The divines were committed to <b>the</b> <b>Reformed</b> doctrine of predestination—that God chooses certain men to be saved and enjoy eternal life rather than eternal punishment. There was some disagreement at the Assembly over the doctrine of particular redemption—that Christ died only for those chosen for salvation. The Assembly also held to Reformed covenant theology, a framework for interpreting the Bible. The Assembly's Confession {{is the first of}} <b>the</b> <b>Reformed</b> confessions to teach a doctrine called the covenant of works, which teaches that before the fall of man, God promised eternal life to Adam on condition that he perfectly obeyed God.|$|E

Theoretical basis are the theories about teachers' beliefs and attitudes and a belief system according to Paul A. Sabatier. The teachers' approach to <b>the</b> <b>reform</b> is defined as their acceptance of <b>the</b> <b>reform</b> and <b>the</b> extent of their activities in <b>the</b> <b>reform.</b> <b>The</b> teachers' acceptance of <b>the</b> <b>reform</b> is formulated in two dimensions. The first one is teachers' acceptance of <b>the</b> <b>reform</b> objectives. <b>The</b> other one is teachers' acceptance of the new teacher role as a co-creator of the curriculum. The teachers' attitudes appear to be mainly problematic in the second category which deals to formalism of <b>the</b> <b>reform.</b> As main reasons of teachers' disagreement on <b>the</b> <b>reform</b> were identified <b>the</b> problems in <b>the</b> <b>reform</b> implementation phase, teachers' ideological opposition to <b>the</b> <b>reform,</b> inadequate explanation of <b>the</b> <b>reform</b> meaning by central authorities, which leads to a misunderstanding of <b>the</b> <b>reform</b> objectives by teachers, and an implementation of <b>the</b> <b>reform</b> [...] ...|$|R

30|$|The good {{conditions}} {{around the}} time of <b>the</b> <b>reform</b> indicate that <b>the</b> <b>reform</b> was exogenous. <b>The</b> average real GDP growth was 3.3 %, and the unemployment rate was 4.7 % from 1997 to 2002 (data from Instituto Nacional de Estatistica). The effects of a reform may be overstated if <b>the</b> <b>reform</b> is induced by recessions (Lalive et al. 2006; Lalive and Zweimüller 2004). This is not the case of <b>the</b> 1999 <b>reform.</b> Moreover, <b>the</b> rules of <b>the</b> <b>reform</b> applied only to those entering unemployment after <b>the</b> <b>reform.</b> This feature allows us to use agents before and after <b>the</b> <b>reform</b> to control for macroeconomic effects and for unobserved heterogeneity among agents.|$|R

Originally a German-speaking congregation, its documents and religious services were in German until 1821 (an early transition to English for a German denomination in the United States). By that time, under the pastorship of Abraham Reck (1812–21), the congregation was known as Capon Church.|$|E

5|$|Huldrych Zwingli, the {{earliest}} theologian {{considered part of}} <b>the</b> <b>Reformed</b> tradition, was vigorously opposed to worship practices he believed {{to be based on}} tradition rather than the Bible. Nevertheless, he disagreed with Anabaptists, who refused to baptize their children on scriptural grounds. Through his arguments with Anabaptists, Zwingli arrived at the position that baptism was a sign of the covenant between God and his people, but that it did not convey grace to the baptized. He saw baptism as essentially identical to the circumcision of Israelites in the Old Testament in this respect, and used this idea in polemics against Anabaptists. Zwingli's emphasis on baptism as a pledge or oath was to prove unique in <b>the</b> <b>Reformed</b> tradition. Heinrich Bullinger, Zwingli's successor, continued the teaching of the continuity of God's covenants and circumcision with baptism. Bullinger also emphasized that baptism indicates duties to the baptized in response to God's grace.|$|E
5|$|In 1517, the Wittenberg monk Martin Luther publicised The Ninety-Five Theses, {{challenging}} the Roman Catholic Church and initiating the Protestant Reformation. In 1555, the Peace of Augsburg established Lutheranism as an acceptable alternative to Catholicism, but also decreed that {{the faith of}} the prince was to be the faith of his subjects, a principle called Cuius regio, eius religio. The agreement at Augsburg failed to address other religious creed: for example, <b>the</b> <b>Reformed</b> faith was still considered a heresy and the principle did not address the possible conversion of an ecclesiastic ruler, such as happened in Electorate of Cologne in 1583. From the Cologne War {{until the end of the}} Thirty Years' Wars (1618–1648), religious conflict devastated German lands. The latter reduced the overall population of the German states by about 30 per cent, and in some places, up to 80 per cent. The Peace of Westphalia ended religious warfare among the German states. German rulers were able to choose either Roman Catholicism, Lutheranism or <b>the</b> <b>Reformed</b> faith as their official religion after 1648.|$|E
