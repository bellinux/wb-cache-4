5|$|Forecasts of {{hurricane}} activity are issued before each hurricane season by Dr. William M. Gray {{and his associates}} at Colorado State University (CSU) and the Weather Research Center (WRC).

5|$|Forecasts ofhurricane {{activity}} are issued before each hurricane season by noted hurricane experts such as Dr. William M. Gray {{and his associates}} at Colorado State University. A normal season, as defined by <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Oceanic</b> <b>and</b> <b>Atmospheric</b> Administration, has six to fourteen named storms, with four to eight of those reaching hurricane strength, and one to three major hurricanes. The 1994forecast predicted that a total of 10storms would form, of which six of the storms would reach hurricane status.

5|$|In 1912 {{geologist}} Thomas Jaggar {{founded the}} Hawaiian Volcano Observatory. The facility {{was taken over}} in 1919 by <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Oceanic</b> <b>and</b> <b>Atmospheric</b> Administration and in 1924 by the United States Geological Survey (USGS), which marked the start of continuous volcano observation on Hawaii island. The next century {{was a period of}} thorough investigation, marked by contributions from many top scientists. The first complete evolutionary model was first formulated in 1946, by USGS geologist and hydrologist Harold T. Stearns. Since that time, advances have enabled the study of previously limited areas of observation (e.g. improved rock dating methods and submarine volcanic stages).|$|E
5|$|On May17, <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Oceanic</b> <b>and</b> <b>Atmospheric</b> Administration {{issued its}} {{seasonal}} forecast for the 2004 central Pacific season, predicting {{four or five}} tropical cyclones to form or cross into the basin. Likewise to the SMN, near average activity was expected {{largely as a result}} of a Neutral ENSO. The organization issued its experimental eastern Pacific outlook on May21, highlighting a 45 percent change of below-average activity, 45 percent chance of near-average activity, and only a 10 percent chance of above-average activity in the basin. A total of 13 to 15 named storms, 6 to 8 hurricanes, and 2 to 4 major hurricanes was forecast.|$|E

Following two pre-season storms, the CSU updated their forecast to 13 named storms, 5 hurricanes, and 2 major hurricanes, while the NOAA upped their forecast numbers to 12–17 named storms, 5–8 hurricanes, and 2–3 major hurricanes on August9.

5|$|Accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) {{is used by}} <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Oceanic</b> <b>and</b> <b>Atmospheric</b> Administration {{and other}} {{agencies}} to express the activity of individual tropical cyclones that are above tropical storm strength and entire tropical cyclone seasons. It is calculated by taking the squares of the estimated maximum sustained velocity of every active tropical storm (wind speed 35 knots or higher) at six-hour intervals. The numbers are usually divided by 10,000 {{to make them more}} manageable. The unit of ACE is 104 kn2, and for use as an index the unit is assumed. As well as being squared for ACE, wind speed can also be cubed, which {{is referred to as the}} Power Dissipation Index (PDI).|$|E
