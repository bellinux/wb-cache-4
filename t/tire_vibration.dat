40|$|It is {{now known}} that tire/road {{interaction}} noise is the major contributor to exterior automobile noise and establishes the background noise level in many environments. Thus, the reduction of tire/road noise is a major environmental noise issue today. ^ Among the numerous tire noise mechanisms, <b>tire</b> <b>vibration</b> has been established as the primary source: i. e., a tire 2 ̆ 7 s tread block hits the road surface, and then the underlying reinforcing belts vibrate owing to the force transmitted through the tread block, resulting in sound radiation from the vibrating tire surface. ^ In an attempt to identify the dominant tire noise sources, a sound field visualization procedure referred to as Nearfield Acoustical Holography was applied to a rolling tire: {{it has been shown}} that sound radiation originates close to the contact patch of a tire. ^ An experimental procedure has also been introduced to identify the main characteristics of <b>tire</b> <b>vibration.</b> In the latter procedure, a tire is driven radially at a point on its treadband and measurements of the resulting radial treadband vibration are made around the treadband circumference by using a laser Doppler velocimeter. By performing a circumferential wave number transform of the measured data, the dispersion relations can be obtained that quantify the multi-modal wave propagation characteristics of a tire, specifically the wave propagation speeds and attenuation rates. ^ For the purpose of identifying tire design parameters that can control <b>tire</b> <b>vibration</b> components that are responsible for sound radiation, various tire models have been developed.

40|$|AbstractAn {{important}} role of tires is to help automobile drivers to obviate serious traffic accidents, particularly in the snowy season. In practice, the types of tires are monitored by visual inspection with human eyes. This report {{is concerned with the}} reliable detection of tire types using the vibration signals of road surface on passing vehicles. The vibration signals vary momentarily depending on several mechanisms, such as vibration impact, tire tread patterns, and so on. Then, {{it may be possible to}} passively and easily discriminate the types of tires; i. e., the least signal differences between winter and summer tires. To detect <b>tire</b> <b>vibration</b> signals from vehicles running at 30, 40, 50 and 60 km/h on average only when road surfaces were dry or wet, we used a commercially available accelerometer as a sensor, which enabled us to easily reduce cost and size in realizing a practical system for detecting tire types. To classify tires into two categories of winter and summer ones, we herein propose several effective signals, featuring a simple detection method based on the principal component analysis. From the experimental results, obtained in snowy areas, it has been demonstrated that such signal features are believed to be a potential tool for a reliable detection of the tire types by using only the vibration signals from passing vehicles...|$|E

40|$|As the {{technologies}} of vehicles have improved, {{the need for}} reducing tire noise is becoming more important. So far, {{there have been several}} studies on this subject. In general, forces at the contact patch cause essentially structure-borne waves to propagate along the tire carcass and essentially airborne waves to propagate within the tire cavity. Since these wave types are coupled, the airborne interior waves contribute to <b>tire</b> surface <b>vibration</b> and then exterior sound radiation. However, the effect of the air cavity on external sound radiation has not been studied as extensively as the sound radiation from structure-borne vibrations. In fact, detecting a tire cavity mode under various conditions has recently become more important because {{it may be possible to}} detect hazardous substances such as explosives in the tire cavity by measuring acoustic radiation from the tire cavity. Here the effect of the interior acoustic mode on <b>tire</b> surface <b>vibration</b> (and hence, on sound radiation) has been studied. To this end, a fully-coupled finite element model of an inflated tire consisting of a treadband, sidewall and an acoustical cavity has been constructed. That model has been used to study the spatial character of the interior acoustic field and to distinguish between components associated with sub-sonic <b>tire</b> carcass <b>vibration</b> and the interior acoustical modes. The influence of the spatial distribution of the input force (i. e., point versus patch) on the relative strengths of the acoustic and structural modes has also been examined. The influence of the interior acoustic field on the <b>tire</b> surface <b>vibration</b> has been isolated by using wave number transform techniques to identify surface vibration components matching the interior mode in shape and phase speed. To investigate the effect of deflection in the contact patch area on carcass vibration and the interior acoustical modes, a deformed tire was simulated using a finite element model. It was confirmed that deflection in the contact patch area leads to separation of otherwise degenerate acoustical modes (i. e., the fore-aft mode and the vertical mode). Finally, wave-number filtering was applied to visualize the <b>tire</b> surface <b>vibration</b> related to the interior acoustical mode. A simple longitudinal quadrupole model for radiation from the fundamental cavity model for a tire on a reflecting surface was then proposed and was successfully compared with experimental results. ...|$|R

The continuous steel highway bridges with middle span length have vibration modes with the same phase in each span at the frequencies of about 3 Hz and also have those with the secondary mode shape at the frequencies of about 10 – 20 Hz. Truck vibrations and bridge vibrations are closely related. In this work, vibration tests are conducted using a heavy test truck for two cases of infrasound complaints in order to investigate {{the relation between the}} continuous steel bridge vibration modes generated by the vibration of moving heavy trucks and its infrasound characteristics. As a result of the examination, two types of bridge vibration modes are caused by the vibrations of a moving heavy truck.

Because multiple mechanisms are involved, it is difficult to predict the effects of changes in pavement parameters on tire-pavement noise. In this research, a set of experimental techniques were developed to decompose a measured tire-pavement noise spectrum into a set of constituent spectra relating to each generation mechanism. Three principal mechanisms were identified: treadband vibration, sidewall vibration, and tangential tread block vibration. By combining the constituent spectra associated with these mechanisms, it was possible to accurately predict the total tire-pavement noise spectrum. The constituent spectra were fit to tire-pavement noise data measured on asphalt and concrete pavements at highway speeds.

40|$|Owing to {{its unique}} {{physical}} properties, rubber plays a keyrole in countless industrial applications. <b>Tires,</b> <b>vibration</b> absorbers and shoe soles are only {{but a few}} of the myriad uses of natural and synthetic rubber in an industry which in 2009 had an estimated market value of 2 billion euro. Despite a peculiar internal structure, the macroscopic behavior of filled-rubber is reminiscent of several biological soft tissues. While rubber is internally constituted by flexible long chain molecules that intertwine with each other, a similar role is played, in soft-tissues, by collagen fiber bundles. As a consequence, both classes of materials are able to sustain large strains and exhibit the characteristics of a viscous fluid and an elastic solid. In industry, the requirement to model complex geometrical structures made of materials exhibiting a nonlinear constitutive behavior is a compelling reason to use Finite Element Analysis (FEA) software. The predictive capabilities of these numerical tools strongly rely upon the capabilities of the underlying model to describe the material’s rheological properties. The possibility of simulating accurately the material behavior over the entire working range avoids the use of excessive number of prototypes, thereby reducing the need for expensive and difficult experimental tests; consequently, development costs can be drastically reduced. The theory of viscoelasticity is crucial in describing materials, such as filled rubber, which exhibit time dependent stress-strain behavior. In many engineering applications, such as the estimate of the rolling resistance of tires and hysteretic losses in soft biological tissues, the energy dissipation is a primary feature to be predicted. In addition, in the usual operative range, tires, shock absorbers and other rubber components bear finite dynamic deformations. Therefore, a reliable constitutive equation must be assessed within the theory of nonlinear viscoelasticity. A review of the literature revealed significantly more well-established studies dealing with hyperelastic constitutive models, than those dealing with finite viscoelasticity. Over the years, many hyperelastic models able to describe all the relevant aspects of the quasi-static response have been introduced. Furthermore, the American norms (ASTM D 412, ASTM D 575, ASTM D 945, ASTM D 6147, ASTM D 1456) establish all the experimental techniques to identify the material constitutive parameters. In this context, many authors have recently addressed the problem of finite amplitude wave propagation or focused their interest upon particular boundary value problems. On the other hand, there is a lack of well-established nonlinear viscoelastic models capable of describing all the relevant effects in the material response. Moreover, a standardization similar to that concerning the static norms is yet to be achieved. The usual methodology provides for small harmonic deformations superimposed on a large static displacement. However, such a prescription does not allow the capture of many of the relevant nonlinear phenomena. In the literature, experimental evidence concerning finite dynamic deformations is rarely reported...|$|R

In addition, experimental results from bimodal excitation are replicated well, even though material parameters were obtained solely from harmonic excitation. These results are encouraging since the superposition principle is not valid for filled rubber, and real-life operational conditions in general contain several harmonics. This means that formulating constitutive equations in the frequency domain is a cumbersome task, and therefore the derived model is implemented in the time domain. Filled rubber is used irreplaceable in several engineering solutions, such as <b>tires,</b> bushings, <b>vibrations</b> isolators, seals and tread belts, {{to name just a}} few.

40|$|International audienceIn {{terms of}} safety and environment, {{reduction}} of the noise generated by <b>tire</b> <b>vibrations</b> on a road is very significant. In order to study the vibration properties of vehicle tires, various methods have been presented in literature. In most of these methods, the global structure of tires has been modelled as circular ring, orthotropic plate, periodic or full 3 -dimensional models. A brief review {{of the characteristics of}} these models and comparison of their dynamic behaviour are the main purpose of the current study. The tire is supposed to be subjected to an excitation caused by contact of the tire and road. Study of vibrational responses demonstrates that the validity of each model is limited to a certain frequency range. To employ the circular ring and orthotropic plate models, first, we require to estimate some structural and material data associated to the nature of these models. To this end, the vibrational response of a 3 D model is considered to determine some properties such as radial and tangential stiffnesses in circular ring model or bending, foundation stiffness, and tension in orthotropic plate model. Furthermore, the effect of inflation pressure on the dynamic behavior of the mentioned models is examined. For verification, the dynamical behaviour of a tire is studied experimentally. Application of the present study can be contemplated in the prediction of rolling noise and rolling resistance. A lot of research on the vibration properties of vehicle tires has been done during the last decades. In this purpose, one of the simplest methods is the model of rotating ring on the elastic foundation. Due to the completeness and simplicity, since the 1960 s, this method has drawn the attractions of numerous researchers. Development of the method is pioneered by Clark [1], Tielking [2], and Bohm [3] who presented a method for calculating the dynamic behavior of a loaded pneumatic tire modeled as an elastically supported cylindrical shell. In these works, the tire sidewall effects were modeled by the radial springs. Pacejka [4] modeled the tire as a circular ring under pressure. By considering the circumferential springs for the elastic foundation, he developed models for the lateral vibration. The effect of structural damping on the study of dynamic response of the classical ring on the foundation for the first time was considered by Padovan [5] in 1976. Later, Potts et al. [6] studied the vibration of a rotating ring on an elastic foundation in terms of the material and geometric properties of the tire. In order to study the free vibration of a circular ring tire located on an elastic foundation, a finite element method was presented by Kung et al. [7] in 1987. Huang [8, 9] studied the response of a rotating ring subjected to the harmonic and periodic loadings. In 2008, Wei [10] proposed an analytical approach to analyze the forced transient response of the tires modeled based on the ring on the elastic foundation. The next method to model the tire structure is the model of Timoshenko beam. In the recent decade, Pinnington and Briscoe [11] developed a one-dimensional wave model to describe the tire dynamics. The tire belt is represented as a tensioned Timoshenko beam in order to derive arbitrary sidewall impedance. The waves, which propagate along the tire, take shear and rotational effects into account. The validity of the circular ring models is limited to the frequency less than 400 Hz, when the wavelength is large enough compared to the width of the tire...|$|R

The Tweel technology tires developed by Michelin USA are comprised of an outer polyurethane ring supported by polyurethane fins instead of metal spokes, which allow the tire to deflect under pressure. As a wheelchair tire they offer a potential breakthrough as they have deflection properties similar to a pneumatic tire while maintaining the low maintenance of a solid foam-core tire. A study was conducted to compare the Tweel technology tires to standard solid foam-core <b>tires</b> for <b>vibration</b> transmission, traction and overall life span. The Tweel technology tires failed produce any significant difference in vibration transmitted to the user compared to solid foam-core tires. Additionally, the Tweel technology tires showed significant signs of deterioration after a month long field trial, thus indicating a short life span. However, Tweel technology tires provided better traction on both dry and wet concrete. Overall, Tweel technology tires have to be re-engineered to provide better damping properties, leading to lower vibrational levels transmitted to the user. The second section this thesis addressed the need to develop a methodology of measuring mobility in everyday usage. This section is part of a greater ongoing research project at CATEA (Center for Assistive Technology and Environmental Access) aimed at understanding everyday wheelchair usage. Methodology was developed to measure bouts of mobility that characterize wheelchair usage; which includes the number of starts, stops, turns and distance traveled through the day. Three different technologies which included, Accelerometer unit {{on the rim of the}} drive wheel, Gyro-Accelerometer unit on the frame of the chair and Reed switches, were tested. Testing included various criteria for accuracy, durability and compatibility for measuring bouts of everyday wheeled mobility. Although a single technology could not be used to measure all aspects of mobility, the Accelerometer unit on the rim met the design criteria for measuring starts stops and distance, while the Gyro-Accelerometer unit met the requirements for measuring turns.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to reduce sound radiation resulting from a tire 2 ̆ 7 s structural vibration by modification of its orthotropic material parameters and tire shape. ^ First, the structural wave propagation characteristics on a treadband were studied by using orthotropic shell theory and wave number decomposition and then <b>tire</b> surface <b>vibration</b> was investigated empirically and analytically. The effect of various tire material parameters on structural wave propagation and the associated sound radiation was estimated. ^ Second, the sound radiation resulting from the structural <b>vibration</b> of a <b>tire</b> in contact with the ground was investigated by using BE analysis and experiment. In particular, the orthogonal radiation modes of a tire {{in the presence of a}} reflecting surface were calculated by applying an eigenvector analysis to the tire 2 ̆ 7 s radiation resistance matrix. Based on these analyses, the relationship between the structural wave propagation characteristics of a tire and its sound radiation was estimated. In addition, the effect of actual porous pavements and tire shape on sound radiation was studied. ^ A strategy for reducing the radiated sound levels by modifying the tire parameters from a base set was determined. Finally an optimized set of tire parameters and tire shape that reduced noise emission was suggested. ^ It was found that all structural vibration does not contribute to the sound radiation from a tire. The significance of the fast, longitudinal wave mode propagating through the treadband was confirmed by the large contribution of the modified ring radiation mode to the radiated sound power at the tire 2 ̆ 7 s ring frequency. The third radiation mode above 800 Hz is principally responsible for the horn effect in the presence of reflecting surface. ^ The reduction of radiated sound below 800 Hz was achieved by an increase of treadband circumferential stiffness that was found to move the onset of longitudinal wave motion within the treadband into a higher frequency region. Secondly, flexural wave propagation was found to be mainly controlled by inflation pressure, cross-sectional treadband stiffness and cross-sectional length. By appropriate adjustment of these four parameters, it was found possible to substantially reduce sound radiation in a mid-frequency region. ...|$|R
40|$|All {{of bodies}} {{exist in the}} world may tent to failure because of stress and <b>vibration.</b> <b>Tires</b> are the only {{components}} of a vehicle {{in contact with the}} road. The interaction between the tire and road generates the forces and vibration. This paper summarizes systematically the behavior of the tire by simulated using finite element method. The objective of this project is to analyze the stress and modal analysis of the tire. The tire modeled in Computer Aided Design (CAD) using SolidWork software. ALGOR software from Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) will be analyzed the tire model. In the stress analysis, the force was assumed to be vertical (z-direction) reaction force generated at the tire contact patch. The contact patch dimensions were assumed about a central angle of 300 from either side of the point of contact with the ground. The tire was applied a vertically force with 1000 N until 5000 N. According to the analysis is expected that the contact patch and belt edge separation receive high stress concentration. The values of the maximum Stress Von Misses are about 0. 872322 until 4. 54497 N/mm 2. The maximum values for stress are increasing when the forces applied are increased. The natural frequency analysis from FEA was compared to the experimental data. Result shows that 1 st natural frequency (57. 9038 Hz), 2 nd natural frequency (65. 1867 Hz), 3 rd natural frequency (65. 7771 Hz) and 4 th natural frequency (70. 8319 Hz). Through this project, there will be no big different value for both methods. The percentage of error is around 30 % from the experimental result. Finally it can be conclude that, in order to obtain the behavior of the tire such as stress and vibration, stress and modal analysis can be carried out. Reducing the vibration and stress will be very useful and enhance a good quality of riding. Once the tire lack, the overall part of the car will be affected...|$|R
40|$|In the {{automobile}} industry, {{it is important}} to identify the major noise sources and to find the relationship between them and the interior noise of an automobile. The noise sources include engine noise and <b>vibration,</b> <b>tire</b> noise, exhaust noise and transmission noise. The objective of the research was the prediction of the sound pressure level occurring inside the passenger compartment of an automobile, by using as simple a model as possible. ^ In building reduced models by using measurement data from an automobile, some frequency domain techniques have been used. New and extended techniques have been developed to assist building more accurate reduced models of automobile interior noise. Some time domain techniques have also been investigated. In certain applications, for example, active noise control, one would wish to predict passenger car noise in real time from measurements in the engine or from axle and spindle vibration. In other applications, for example, sound quality design, one would wish to run several predictions in a timely fashion in order to make comparisons. In these applications we derive a simple model that can predict the passenger compartment noise accurately and quickly, and has components that can be related to physical mechanisms within the car so that the effect of design changes can be embedded into the model. While including all major sources of passenger car noise, the objective in building the simplified models was to use the smallest number of transducers and the simplest models possible. ^ Torsional vibration is an implicit excitation that exists in an operating automobile, and can be a significant noise source. Due to the difficulty of measuring torsional vibration on rotating shafts, it has not often been used as an input to noise models, although torsional vibrations could be a major cause of noise inside a passenger car. In previous studies, torsional vibration in the power train of {{the automobile}} was found to be the source of the booming noise, the correlation between the torsional vibration in the drive line and the low frequency noise in an automobile. A low cost and effective torsional vibration measurement system has been designed to assist the measurement of the torsional vibration of a shaft. The measurement system was applied to a rotating shaft on a test bench; results indicate that this method can be used on an operating automobile to measure the torsional vibration on the wheel axle. ...|$|R
40|$|Engineering {{elastomers}} are materials {{capable of}} undergoing large deformation upon load application and recovering upon load removal. From car <b>tires</b> to building <b>vibration</b> isolator systems, elastomers {{are the most}} versatile of engineering materials. The inclusion of particulate fillers into elastomers enhances their mechanical properties (modulus, tensile strength, toughness, tear resistance, etc) thereby extending their applicability to more demanding functions. The automotive, healthcare, construction, adhesives and consumer products {{are some of the}} many industries that produce finished goods containing elastomeric parts. ^ Despite the various concepts on reinforcement in filled elastomers, a complete understanding of their linear viscoelastic properties and the nonlinear mechanical properties, including stress softening (Mullins), strain dependent dynamic modulus (Payne) and others remains elusive. Furthermore, studies on filled elastomers have failed to produce a unifying perspective on the relationship between the microstructural composition and the observed macroscopic response to deformation. To further the current understanding of the underlying physics of elastomer reinforcement, a comprehensive study on the effect of composition was undertaken. ^ A major challenge in the application of the Time-Temperature Superposition (TTS) principle for filled elastomers rests on the difficulty of conducting experiments in their linear regime, which could be at strains even lower than 10 - 3. In this work, the linear viscoelastic behavior of filled elastomers was studied via the successful application of TTS at extremely small strains using the double sandwich shear geometry. Well-defined master curves were constructed for a series of carbon black filled SBR and Polybutadiene elastomers. In addition, an investigation of the effects of filler volume fraction and structure on the full linear viscoelastic response was carried out. A critical analysis of the superposed data showed correlation of linear viscoelastic properties to measurable filler parameters specifically the effective volume fraction, 2 ̆ 6 phiv;eff, in which allowed for the first time collapsing on a single master curve the viscoelastic storage and loss moduli for all filled elastomers studied. ^ Nonlinear mechanical behavior was investigated on fumed silica filled Poly(dimethylsiloxane) rubber. For the first time, necking was observed for a lightly cross-linked poly(dimethylsiloxane) elastomer filled with 30 phr (parts per hundred rubber) or more of high surface area (≥ 300 m 2 /g) fumed silica. A series of linear and nonlinear mechanical properties of the necked material were studied including (i) linear and nonlinear dynamic shear analysis including the Payne effect, (ii) uniaxial tension experiments including the Mullins effect, (iii) tensile strength, and (iv) tear resistance via the 2 ̆ 7 trouser 2 ̆ 7 test. The ultimate properties of the necked material were superior to its un-necked counterpart and both the Mullins and Payne effects were present in the necked material. The dynamic modulus exhibited anisotropy with respect to the direction of the necking deformation, where the anisotropy was not found in fumed silica filled PDMS elastomers that did not neck although the materials were pre-stretched to similar strains. Based upon these experimental observations, it was been postulated that necking occurs due to the breakage of delicate highly branched aggregates at the points of local stress concentrations. The preferential breakage of the most mechanically distressed aggregates will result in a more regular filler-matrix network, giving rise to higher ultimate properties of the necked material. This finding challenges the aggregate breakage postulate as a primary mechanism for the Mullins effect. ...|$|R
