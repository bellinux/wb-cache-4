The series ends with the pair sailing away <b>together</b> <b>into</b> the sunset, their relationship apparently rekindled.|$|E
5|$|By 2005, Clavia {{had found}} {{commercial}} {{success with the}} Nord Lead synthesizer, which emulated analog synthesis, and the Nord Electro virtual electromechanical keyboard, which emulated the Hammond Organ and Rhodes and Wurlitzer electric pianos. The goal of the Nord Stage was to combine these two technologies <b>together</b> <b>into</b> a flagship instrument.|$|E

5|$|A church, or group, that {{is unable}} to fully provide for the {{religious}} needs of its members is called a mission. Missions are dependent on a congregation which is administered by a minister. A group of several congregations with their missions form a district. The Church in each nation is divided into multiple districts. In Mexico, several districts form <b>together</b> <b>into</b> five jurisdictions that act as legal entities.|$|E

5|$|Approximately sixteen {{lists of}} censured theses were {{issued by the}} University of Paris during the 13th and 14th centuries. Most of these lists of propositions were put <b>together</b> <b>into</b> {{systematic}} collections of prohibited articles. Of these, the Condemnations of 1277 are considered particularly important by those historians who consider {{that they had a}} side effect of encouraging scholars to question the tenets of Aristotelian science. From this perspective, some revisionist historians maintain that the condemnations had positive effects on the development of science, perhaps even representing the beginnings of modern science.|$|E
5|$|Around 1865 John Newlands {{produced}} {{a series of}} papers where he listed the elements in order of increasing atomic weight and similar {{physical and chemical properties}} that recurred at intervals of eight; he likened such periodicity to the octaves of music, where notes an octave apart have similar musical functions. His version put all the alkali metals then known (lithium to caesium), as well as copper, silver, and thallium (which show the +1 oxidation state characteristic of the alkali metals), <b>together</b> <b>into</b> a group. His table placed hydrogen with the halogens.|$|E

Raw avocado cake prepared with a significant amount of avocado may contain substantial amounts of vitamin E and essential fatty acids, which are derived from avocado.|$|E

5|$|Being Cristian Nemescu's last {{completed}} project, {{the film}} stars Mădălina Ghiţescu as Marilena and Gabriel Huian as Andrei. Originally, {{the film was}} intended to be used as an exercise, and was not supposed to be longer than seven minutes. In the end, the project evolved to an unusual length of 45minutes; the film's approach also turned from comedy to teenage love. Reception from the public was favorable – it impressed through its unitary view and the way the screenplay, picture and sound combine <b>together</b> <b>into</b> a new and organic way, by using innovative, unusual techniques.|$|E
5|$|Janice Dickinson's friend {{make-up artist}} Way Bandy {{recommended}} she use {{the writing process}} to help heal from her past experiences. She began to do so {{as part of her}} addiction recovery during a twelve-step program. She put her notes down on legal pads and they became numerous over time. By the time Dickinson began to compile her writing into book format she had become established in her career and resided in Los Angeles, California with her two children. She started formally putting her notes <b>together</b> <b>into</b> a book after successfully gaining sobriety.|$|E
5|$|Like DNA, most biologically active RNAs, {{including}} mRNA, tRNA, rRNA, snRNAs, {{and other}} non-coding RNAs, contain self-complementary sequences that allow {{parts of the}} RNA to fold and pair with itself to form double helices. Analysis of these RNAs has revealed that they are highly structured. Unlike DNA, their structures do not consist of long double helices, but rather collections of short helices packed <b>together</b> <b>into</b> structures akin to proteins.|$|E

25|$|Additive {{synthesis}} builds sounds {{by adding}} <b>together</b> waveforms <b>into</b> a composite sound. Instrument sounds are simulated by matching their natural harmonic overtone structure.

5|$|Mark came up {{with the}} music first, then I {{came up with}} the words and we fitted it all <b>together</b> <b>into</b> a melody. That's the way I {{normally}} make songs– I write everything in the studio– and it obviously means that producers are very important to me. It's a complete joint effort.|$|E
5|$|Most fungi {{have both}} a haploid and a diploid stage {{in their life}} cycles. In sexually {{reproducing}} fungi, compatible individuals may combine by fusing their hyphae <b>together</b> <b>into</b> an interconnected network; this process, anastomosis, {{is required for the}} initiation of the sexual cycle. Many ascomycetes and basidiomycetes go through a dikaryotic stage, in which the nuclei inherited from the two parents do not combine immediately after cell fusion, but remain separate in the hyphal cells (see heterokaryosis).|$|E

It heads west through {{farmland}} before turning north and intersecting MD 290 (Chesterville Road). The two routes continue north <b>together</b> <b>into</b> Galena, where the road becomes Main Street. It passes residences before intersecting MD 213 (Main Street) {{in the center of}} town where MD 313 ends, MD 290 turns east on Cross Street, and MD 213 goes northbound on Main Street and southbound by going west on Cross Street.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{the classic}} {{era of the}} series that ended in 1989, the plan with the new series was to have each episode as a {{standalone}} story, with no serials. Of the thirteen episodes in the series, seven of them followed this format; the remaining six were grouped <b>together</b> <b>into</b> three two-part stories. Also, {{for the first time}} since The Gunfighters in the third season, each episode was given an individual title, which was the case with the standalone and two-part stories.|$|E
5|$|Whatever one's {{suspicions about}} its use or {{abuse of the}} evidence, JFK is a knockout. Part history book, part comic book, the movie rushes toward {{judgment}} for three breathless hours, lassoing facts and factoids by the thousands, then bundling them <b>together</b> <b>into</b> an incendiary device that would frag any viewer's complacency. Stone's picture is, in both meanings of the word, sensational: it's tip-top tabloid journalism. In its bravura and breadth, JFK is seditiously enthralling; in its craft, wondrously complex.|$|E
5|$|As {{elsewhere}} in Western Europe, {{in the nineteenth}} century there was a return to Medieval styles, grouped <b>together</b> <b>into</b> a Gothic revival. Early examples included Adams' St George's Episcopal Chapel in Edinburgh (1792), which included octagonal lantern on ogival arches. Other examples included James Playfair's chapel-like Farnell Church (c. 1789) and Richard Crichton's towered Craig Parish Church (1799). In the early nineteenth century examples influenced by the English Perpendicular included Glenorchy Church (1810–11), built by the Earl of Breadalbane, John Paterson's octagonal reconstruction of St Paul's Church, Perth (c. 1800–07) and Fetteresso Church, Stonehaven (1810–12). Examples of a more explicitly perpendicular form can be seen in Gillespie Graham's Collace (1813), or David Hamilton's Old Erskine (1813–14).|$|E
