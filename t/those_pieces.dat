5|$|In {{the other}} world, Oliver finds a {{multitude}} of broken-hearted people affected by Jabou, and uses his new-found magic abilities to restore <b>those</b> <b>pieces</b> of heart which they lack, and travels the world {{to seek out the}} four great sages who may be able to help. Along the way, he meets Maru, daughter of one of the great sages, and Jairo, a thief who initially steals a crucial item from them, but who ultimately decides to help. As they enlist the sages' help, they learn of a wand {{that could be used to}} defeat Jabou, but are at a loss as to how to retrieve it, as it was recently destroyed by Jabou. Soon after, they find themselves many years in the past by the actions of a stranger, and are able to retrieve the wand there.|$|E
5|$|The obverse of {{the coin}} {{features}} jugate busts of Bibb, Alabama's first governor as a state, and the incumbent in 1919, Kilby. In so appearing, Kilby became the first living person depicted on a U.S. coin. Anthony Swiatek, in his volume on commemoratives, averred that the issuance was not controversial at the time, as the Act of May 16, 1866, that forbids the depiction of living people on currency was deemed to refer to paper money only, but Q. David Bowers wrote that the portrayal caused contemporary comment, for {{the position of the}} federal government (excepting some paper money issues of the 19th century) was that living people should not appear on U.S. money. A total of 22 stars flank the busts, symbolic of Alabama being the 22nd state; a message reinforced on <b>those</b> <b>pieces</b> bearing the inscription 2X2 in the obverse field. The X in that inscription alludes to the St. Andrew's cross on the flag of Alabama. The date, the names of the governors, and various other wordings appear towards the rim of the obverse.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the queen}} {{combines}} {{the powers of}} the rook and the bishop, there is rarely a reason to underpromote to either of <b>those</b> <b>pieces.</b> However, doing so is occasionally advantageous, usually to avoid an immediate draw by stalemate if the promotion were to a queen.|$|E
40|$|Storage in {{peer-to-peer}} networks must {{be reliable}} and dependable. This reliability is partially dependent of data placement. In some approaches, information pieces {{are moving in}} the network to find a placement that optimizes different criteria. But this mobility may be a drawback for the localization ot <b>thoses</b> <b>pieces.</b> In this paper, we propose to measure the impact tha mobility of network objects has on their localization...|$|R
40|$|The {{traditional}} {{research on}} method of pay and wages compares <b>those</b> paid <b>piece</b> rates with <b>those</b> {{paid by the}} hour, and finds (as predicted by the theory) that <b>those</b> paid <b>piece</b> rates earn more. In this paper, those paid by the hour are divided into those paid standard rates (wage does not vary with performance) and those paid by merit pay plans. An extension of the standard theory predicts that <b>those</b> paid <b>piece</b> rates would have the highest earnings, and those paid standard rates the lowest, with merit pay an "in between" status. The evidence, however, from the Industry Wage Surveys is that those under merit pay receive lower wages {{than those in the}} other two groups. ...|$|R

25|$|A {{possible}} {{identification of}} Byttering with a Thomas Byteryng has been made. Byteryng was a canon at Hastings Castle between 1405 and 1408, {{and was a}} rector somewhere in London in 1414. There is no information on the composer in the Old Hall Manuscript other than that his surname is attached to several pieces. <b>Those</b> <b>pieces</b> stand out {{from many of the}} works in the manuscript by their relatively advanced stylistic traits.|$|E
25|$|The ranging {{pieces are}} the queen, dragon king, dragon horse, rook, bishop, {{vertical}} mover, side mover, reverse chariot, lance, and all <b>those</b> <b>pieces</b> {{which do not}} appear in the initial setup except the prince. Only the queen can range along all eight directions. The Japanese Chu Shogi Association further divides them into greater (大走り駒) and lesser (走り駒) ranging pieces: the greater ranging pieces are the queen, horned falcon, and soaring eagle, and the remainder are lesser ranging pieces.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} things about the fantastical creatures carved of wood is that every piece is removable, it's how you can tell you have a piece carved by one of the original great carvers. The later carvers didn't learn the technique of making each piece fit so well that it could be removed and put back in again and again. <b>Those</b> <b>pieces</b> have more than tripled in value. The painting on these figures is also more intense and varied.|$|E

5000|$|Castriota {{continued}} to direct his orchestra, alternating as pianist, and composing new <b>pieces.</b> However, <b>those</b> new <b>pieces</b> never {{came close to}} having the impact of Mi noche triste. He died in Buenos Aires on July 8, 1932.|$|R
25|$|The British company Parker Hale {{also made}} reproductions of the Enfield 1853 rifle-musket {{and of the}} Pattern 1861 Enfield musketoon in the 1970s. <b>Those</b> <b>pieces</b> were made to {{original}} patterns but are not particularly suitable for use by American Civil War reenactors because they were made to 4th model specs, including having the Baddeley barrel bands. This model (the 4th) was originally made too late to have been fielded in the American War. Appropriate models for that use would be 2nd or 3rd model three band rifle muskets.|$|E
25|$|Having {{previously}} {{studied at}} the San Francisco Art Institute as a teenager, Garcia embarked on a second career {{in the visual arts}} in the late 1980s. He offered for sale and auction to the public a number of illustrations, lithographs, and water colors. Some of <b>those</b> <b>pieces</b> became the basis of a line of men's neckties characterized by bright colors and abstract patterns. Years after Garcia's death, new styles and designs continue to be produced and sold. Some ties that were produced began as etchings, other designs came from his drawings, paintings, and digital art.|$|E
25|$|The Metropolitan Museum of Art spent $39 {{million to}} acquire art {{for the fiscal}} year ending in June 2012. At the same time, the museum is {{required}} to list in its annual report the total cash proceeds from art sales each year and to itemize any deaccessioned objects valued at more than $50,000 each. It must also sell <b>those</b> <b>pieces</b> at auction and provide advance public notice of a work being sold if it has been on view in the last ten years. These rules were imposed by the New York State Attorney General in 1972.|$|E
5000|$|The school's Art Department and its {{students}} entered the Visual Arts Scholastic Event, a statewide competition, receiving 62 [...] "Superior" [...] ratings at Regionals, 14 gold medals at State, and seven gold seals, which allows <b>those</b> seven <b>pieces</b> to tour Texas on an art exhibition.|$|R
5|$|Variants of the M3 {{should not}} be {{confused}} with other 37mm guns in the U.S. service. <b>Those</b> other <b>pieces</b> included the M1916 infantry gun of French design (these were later used extensively as subcaliber devices for heavy artillery.), M1 antiaircraft autocannon, M4/M9/M10 aircraft-mounted autocannons, M12/M13/M14/M15 subcaliber guns.|$|R
50|$|In {{the book}} {{it is also}} common to find {{excerpts}} from writing assignments given to Chinese students. <b>Those</b> short <b>pieces</b> and excerpts are pregnant with their stories, feelings and thoughts, that help the reader (as the author before) to discover hidden private stories about Chinese life.|$|R
25|$|By {{the early}} 1930s the Red Army (RKKA) {{started to look}} for a {{replacement}} for the 152-mm howitzer M1909 and the 152-mm howitzer M1910. <b>Those</b> <b>pieces,</b> developed before World War I, had unsprung fixed trail carriages and short barrels, which meant poor mobility, insufficient elevation and traverse angles and short range. Although both pieces were eventually modernized, resulting in the 152-mm howitzer M1909/30 and the 152-mm howitzer M1910/37 respectively, these were relatively minor upgrades which brought only limited improvement in some areas and didn't address others. It was clear that a completely new design was needed. However, at that time Soviets had little experience in developing modern artillery pieces.|$|E
25|$|Nueva Trova, {{initially}} so popular, {{was dealt}} a blow {{by the fall}} of the Soviet Union, though it was already fading. It suffered inside Cuba, perhaps from a growing disenchantment with one-party rule, and externally, from the vivid contrast with the Buena Vista Social Club film and recordings. Audiences round the world have had their eyes opened to the extraordinary charm and musical quality of the older forms of Cuban music. By contrast, topical themes that seemed so relevant in the 1960s and 70s now seem dry and passé; once a theme is no longer topical, the piece rests solely on its musical quality. <b>Those</b> <b>pieces</b> of high musical and lyrical quality, amongst which Puebla's Hasta siempre stands out, will probably last as long as Cuba lasts.|$|E
500|$|The {{work had}} its detractors, with some writers criticising it for [...] "repulsive pedantry" [...] and [...] "overbearing assertions", {{as well as}} {{incorrect}} citations to works that were later discredited. There are also factual inaccuracies; Kenyon Homfray in the Ecclesiastical Law Journal notes that despite being considered the supreme legal authority {{on the subject of}} consecration, which Coke covered in the third volume of the Institutes, he offered no legal support for his opinion and ignored <b>those</b> <b>pieces</b> of case law which rejected his interpretation.|$|E
50|$|Casseus {{was also}} an early guitar teacher to the {{musician}} Marc Ribot, who has {{played a significant role}} in preserving Casséus' musical legacy. As part of these efforts, Ribot edited a collection of Casséus' solo guitar compositions, and performed <b>those</b> same <b>pieces</b> on a CD issued in 1993.|$|R

[...] "Of course, I don't know the {{geography}} of the place, but if the Russians keep their eyes at all open, I don't see how a force like ours, with cavalry and guns, can hope to enter the town unnoticed. The addition of the horsemen seems to me altogether ridiculous, {{as they could be}} no good whatever, if they did enter the town. As for <b>those</b> four field <b>pieces,</b> they will hamper our march; and as they say the Russians have already some forty cannon in position about the town, <b>those</b> little <b>pieces</b> would be useless.|$|R
500|$|In {{the postwar}} years, Congress and the Treasury {{considered}} {{a revision of}} the coinage laws, as the act of 1837 was deemed outdated. [...] Retention of the two-cent piece was never seriously considered in the debates over what became the Mint Act of 1873; the only question concerning the minor coinage was whether to make the cent from bronze or copper-nickel, and how large to make the three-cent nickel. [...] With <b>those</b> <b>pieces</b> remaining unchanged, the bill passed on February12, 1873, {{putting an end to}} the two-cent piece series.|$|E
500|$|Conran {{summed up}} what {{influenced}} him in making Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow: [...] "We tried {{to approach it}} almost as though we lived in that era and were just another group of artists {{trying to make a}} work out of <b>those</b> <b>pieces</b> and inspirations. We wanted the film to feel like a lost film of that era. If we're a footnote in the history of pulp art and Golden Age comics, that'd be enough, that'd be great. If we even just inspire some people to go back and investigate some of that stuff, we'd have done enough." ...|$|E
500|$|Melish, in his {{capacity}} as treasurer of the Cleveland committee, ordered 25,000 pieces in July 1936. [...] They were shipped from the Philadelphia Mint, where they were struck, on July 20. [...] As well as <b>those</b> <b>pieces,</b> 15 coins were struck and set aside for inspection and testing at the 1937 meeting of the annual Assay Commission. Melish had arranged for the Philadelphia Mint to place the first 201 struck into individual numbered envelopes; these were later placed in special cardboard holders, the first by itself and each two thereafter together, with a notarized statement from Melish.|$|E
50|$|At times, the University's {{connection}} with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints {{has led to}} certain special exhibits being modified, including a Rodin exhibit in 1997 that would have included 4 nude works of art.

500|$|First-time {{director}} Conran incorporated many {{references to}} classic genre films {{into his own}} movie: [...] "The work of those artists and writers from the pulps and Golden Age of Comic Books like Airboy was really the template for us. To some extent we stole from it, to some extent we expanded on it [...] hopefully we added enough of our own sensibility.

500|$|In 1904, President Theodore Roosevelt {{wrote to}} his Secretary of the Treasury, Leslie Mortier Shaw, {{complaining}} that U.S. coinage lacked artistic merit, and enquiring {{if it would be}} possible to engage a private artist, such as sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens, to prepare new coin designs. [...] At Roosevelt's instructions, the Mint hired Saint-Gaudens to redesign the cent and the four gold pieces: the double eagle ($20), eagle ($10), half eagle ($5), and quarter eagle ($2.50). [...] As the designs of <b>those</b> <b>pieces</b> had remained the same for 25years, they could be changed without an act of Congress. [...] The Indian Head cent, which the Lincoln cent replaced, had been introduced in 1859.|$|E
500|$|A {{total of}} 142,080 Huguenot-Walloon half dollars were struck at the Philadelphia Mint in February and April 1924, with 80 of <b>those</b> <b>pieces</b> {{retained}} for {{inspection and testing}} by the 1925 Assay Commission. The Huguenot-Walloon commission, to boost sales, engaged as distributor the man they {{considered to be the}} most prominent numismatist in the country, Moritz Wormser, president of the American Numismatic Association (ANA). Wormser's involvement, and the fact that Stoudt was an ANA member, led numismatist John F. Jones to deem this issue [...] "the first instance we believe, where the coin fraternity has been consulted in the issue of a commemorative half dollar".|$|E
