40|$|Local {{governments have}} been forced to look for {{additional}} water sources to satisfy the ever increasing demand for fresh water. Very often, the new water sources such as the underground water in continental territories have high salt content. Currently, reverse osmosis technology (RO) {{is one of the most}} common processes for water desalination. However, this process is limited by high silica and salt concentrations in water. At high concentrations silica clogs the membranes used in the RO process, reducing their life and increasing operational costs. In this study, quaternary ammonium resins and sulfonic acid resins were used to remove silica and hardness, respectively from brines of both a nano-filtration pilot plant and a synthetic silica solution. Experiments were performed under bath and flow conditions at neutral pH. For batch experiments two anionic quaternary ammonium resins and one cationic sulfonic acid resin were used at 0. 02 to 10 g in 50 mL of solution to carry out equilibrium tests. The resins were also <b>tested</b> <b>for</b> <b>silica</b> removal from a synthetic solution (without hard cations) at pH values from 3 to 11 and from brines of a nano-filtration pilot plant (NFPP) at pH ranging from 8 to 10. For flow experiments, the resins were used at flow rates from 8. 7 to 10. 5 cm/min, and pH values from 8 to 10. In all cases the amounts of silica and hard cations were determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy, or by the photometric determination of molybdate-reactive method or using the titrimetic method with EDTA. Results showed that pH highly influenced silica removal from water solutions using quaternary ammonium resins in the chloride form. <b>For</b> both resins, <b>silica</b> removal efficiencies were higher than 80...|$|R

In Malaysia, less than 30 % of the glass was recycle and causing solid waste impact to the environment. Research on using waste glass as aggregate has been attempted decades ago and recent research shows that it can be used as aggregate under certain measures to avoid alkali silica reaction damaging effect. In this study, the effectiveness of waste glass used as fine aggregate in mortar was studied. Four mixes mortar was prepared accordance to the percentage of replacement of 0 %, 10 %, 20 % and 30 % of waste glass as fine aggregate.

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{an analytical}} method that combines {{in one pot}} the advantages of column chromatography separation and NMR structural analysis. The separation of the NMR spectra {{of the components of}} a mixture can be achieved according to their apparent diffusion rates [James, T. L. and McDonald, G. G. (1973) J. Magn. Reson. 58, 58 – 61]. We show that the separation of the spectral components, corresponding to single molecular species, can be enhanced by order of magnitudes upon addition of a typical stationary phase used in HPLC. The solid phase imbibed by the mixture for analysis is an heterogeneous ensemble, so that solid-state NMR methods (high-resolution magic angle spinning) are necessary to recover high-resolution spectra. We demonstrate applications of this combination of high-resolution magic angle spinning and NMR diffusometry on <b>test</b> mixtures <b>for</b> direct (<b>silica</b> gel) and inverse (C 18) columns.

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} fresh behaviour and mechanical properties of self-compacting concrete (SCC) containing high volume of limestone, metakaolin, silica fume, zeolite, and viscosity modifying admixture. Two fine aggregates with different fineness modulus were also utilized {{to evaluate the}} effect of sand’s gradation on the mechanical and flow properties of SCC containing inert and pozzolanic powder. Slump flow, V-funnel for fresh concrete and 5 -minute-old concrete, J-ring, Orimet with and without J-ring, and L-box and U-box tests were performed on all 14 fresh concrete mixtures to examine the fresh properties of self-compacting concrete. Compressive strength of hardened specimens was measured at 7 and 35 days and tensile strength was also determined {{at the age of}} 28 days. The results show that sand grading significantly affects the fresh properties of SCC. It is also concluded that high volume of active powders including metakaolin, zeolite, and silica fume could not improve both the flow and mechanical properties of SCC at the same time. Limestone can be effectively used as filler in SCC in high volume content.

40|$|A {{method for}} {{determining}} the diameters and shell thicknesses of microbubble resonators is presented; it entails simulating whispering gallery mode (WGM) spectra using a newly developed finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) -based toolkit. Spectra {{for a range of}} shell thicknesses are simulated using FDTD, assuming a linear dependence of the free spectral range on the diameter, and the free spectral ranges and positions of the prominent modes are matched to those of the measured spectrum. This method improves upon existing techniques for extracting the diameter and thickness, such as SEM imaging, which typically require the microbubble to be dissected or otherwise rendered unusable for subsequent use. The model allows a variety of methods of mode excitation to be simulated. Dye coatings are simulated by placing a layer of dipole sources {{on the surface of the}} resonator, yielding mode couplings comparable to those measured in experiments. The model is <b>tested</b> <b>for</b> a small-diameter <b>silica</b> glass microbubble, with the free spectral range being simulated for a range of diameters and shell thicknesses. The numerically simulated spectra are then compared to the experimentally measured spectrum. The ability to determine the geometric parameters of such resonators directly from their WGM spectra represents a step forward in the characterization of microbubble resonators. Furthermore, the model opens the way to previously unstudied spectral behavior of microbubbles with small diameters and thin shell thicknesses. Jonathan M. M.

Such structuring of the wing membranes allows for a variety of removal mechanisms to contend with particle contact, such as wind and self-cleaning droplet interactions.
