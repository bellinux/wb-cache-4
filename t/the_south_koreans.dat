5|$|On 25 October at 10:30, the ROK 1st Infantry Division {{attacked}} north {{with its}} 12th Regiment {{on the western}} bank of Samtan River while the 15th Regiment was {{trying to reach the}} eastern bank. But when the 15th Regiment was about to cross the river, the PVA 120th Division intercepted <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Koreans</b> with heavy artillery fire. <b>The</b> <b>South</b> <b>Koreans</b> first believed the resistance to be the last remnants of the KPA, but the perception soon changed with the capture of the first Chinese prisoner in the Korean War. The prisoner revealed that there were 10,000 Chinese soldiers waiting to join the fight north of Unsan.|$|E
5|$|At noon on October 30, the 15th Corps bombarded the Koreans with 133 large-caliber guns, 22 rocket {{launchers}} and 30 120mm heavy mortars in {{the largest}} Chinese artillery operation of the Korean War. When the bombardment ended at midnight, 10 infantry companies from the 45th and the 29th Divisions swarmed over the ROK 31st Regiment's positions and pushed <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Koreans</b> off the summit. In {{the aftermath of the}} fighting, only 175 South Koreans survived the onslaught out of the three defending infantry companies. With the PVA 91st Regiment of the 31st Division, 12th Corps, arriving as reinforcement on November 1, the Chinese forces chased the remaining South Korean defenders off Jane Russell Hill and beat off the subsequent counterattack. Responding to the losses, the US IX Corps ordered the ROK 30th Regiment of the ROK 9th Infantry Division to take back Triangle Hill on October 31. <b>The</b> <b>South</b> <b>Koreans</b> launched continuous attacks for the next five days to no avail. Although <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Koreans</b> failed to recapture the hill, the resulting heavy casualties forced the Chinese to call in the 93rd Regiment of the 31st Division as reinforcement on November 5. On the same day, Lieutenant General Reuben E. Jenkins, commander of the US IX Corps, suspended further attacks on Triangle Hill to prevent more casualties and to protect Sniper Ridge.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the US 1st Marine Division {{was holding}} firm against the Chinese 39th Army to the east, and the {{withdrawal}} of <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Koreans</b> had left their flank exposed. However, with the Chinese 39th and 40th Armies only tasked with protecting the eastern flank of the 9th Army Group against possible counterattacks from the 1st Marine Division, the Chinese did not exploit this opportunity and the Americans remained relatively unmolested. Yet with the forward UN positions in both the US I Corps and US IX Corps sectors increasingly untenable as the Chinese exploited gaps between formations, Van Fleet ordered a withdrawal to the Kansas Line in the mid-morning. Hoge subsequently ordered the US Marines {{to form a new}} defensive position beyond the Pukhan River, between the Hwachon Reservoir and the new position to be occupied by the South Korean 6th Division. Hoge's plan relied on <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Koreans</b> reforming and offering some resistance, and although a rearguard of 2,500 men was belatedly established it was in no condition to fight. Fearing a breakthrough, Hoge ordered the 27th Brigade, as the corps' reserve, to establish defensive positions north of Kapyong on the afternoon of 23 April as a precaution in the event <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Koreans</b> were unable to hold, tasking them with blocking the two approaches to the village and to prevent the Chinese from cutting Route 17, a key route south to Seoul and an important main supply route.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> National Liberation Front - Preparation Committee {{was created}} by <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> leftists, in order to {{propagate}} socialist and communist ideas to <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> masses. <b>The</b> eventual goal of the SKNLF-PC was to organize <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> people and wage a guerrilla war {{similar to that of}} the Viet Cong in South Vietnam, hoping to eventually create a socialist state and reunify with North Korea. <b>The</b> <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> National Liberation Front was dissolved after many members were exposed and arrested by <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> military regime, including poet Kim Nam-ju.

5|$|On {{the night}} of June 25, 1950, 10 {{divisions}} of the North Korean People's Army launched a full-scale invasion on the nation's neighbor to the south, the Republic of Korea. Advancing with 89,000 men in six columns, the North Koreans caught the South Korean Army by surprise, resulting in a disastrous rout for <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Koreans</b> who were disorganized, ill-equipped, and unprepared for war. Numerically superior, North Korean forces destroyed isolated resistance, pushing steadily down the peninsula against <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Koreans</b> who could muster just 38,000 men to the front-line to oppose them. The majority of the South Korean forces retreated {{in the face of}} the invasion, and by June 28 the North Koreans had captured the capital Seoul, and forced the government and its shattered forces to withdraw further southwards.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, the ROK 3rd Division {{was heavily}} engaged with the NK 5th Division along the coastal road to P'ohang-dong. The {{divisions}} clashes {{centered on the}} town of Yongdok, with each side capturing and recapturing the town several times. On 5 August, the North Koreans launched their attack, again taking the town from the South Korean forces and pushing them south. At 19:30 on 6 August, <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Koreans</b> launched a counteroffensive to retake the hill.|$|E
5|$|At dawn on August 11, one 300-man {{battalion}} of the 766th Regiment entered {{the village of}} P'ohang, creating a state of alarm among its populace. The village was only protected by a small force of South Korean Navy, Air Force and Army personnel comprising the rear guard of the ROK 3rd Division. The South Korean forces engaged the 766th forces around the village's middle school with small-arms fire until noon. At that point, North Korean armored vehicles moved in to reinforce the 766th troops and drove <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Koreans</b> out of the village.|$|E

50|$|On 26 June 2006, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of South Korea {{concluded}} that the massacre was committed by <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> Army. However, a <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> local court decided that charging <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> government with <b>the</b> massacre was barred by statute of limitations, as the five-year prescription ended in December 1954.

In June 2011, the Supreme Court of South Korea decided that <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> government should compensate victims of the inhumane crimes it had committed regardless of the deadline to make the claim.|$|R
5|$|Opposing the US 24th Infantry at Battle Mountain was the NK 6th Division, {{which had}} been {{engaging}} Task Force Kean since August 5. The division, which had originally numbered 10,000, had suffered 4,000 casualties thus far fighting at the Pusan Perimeter. However it brought in 3,100 South Koreans forcibly conscripted from neighboring towns to replenish its ranks. <b>The</b> <b>South</b> <b>Koreans</b> fought as ordered, though the North Koreans dispatched rearguard soldiers with them to shoot any who attempted to desert, defect, or surrender.|$|E
5|$|The Korean War began {{early in}} the morning of 25 June 1950, {{following}} the surprise invasion of the Republic of Korea (ROK) by its northern neighbour, the communist Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). Numerically superior and better-equipped, the Korean People's Army (KPA) crossed the 38th Parallel and rapidly advanced south, easily overcoming <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Koreans.</b> In response, the United Nations (UN) decided to intervene on behalf of South Korea, inviting member states to send forces to restore the situation. As a consequence, American ground forces were hastily deployed in an attempt to prevent <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Koreans</b> from collapsing, however they too were under strength and poorly equipped, and by early August had been forced back by the North Koreans to an enclave around Pusan, known as the Pusan Perimeter. Key US allies—Britain, Canada and Australia—also committed forces, although these were initially limited to naval contingents and were largely viewed as token efforts in the US. Under diplomatic pressure the British agreed to deploy an infantry brigade in July, and would later dispatch a second brigade as the crisis worsened. The Canadians also agreed to provide an infantry brigade, although the first battalion would not arrive until December 1950. A total of 21 UN member states eventually contributed forces.|$|E
5|$|The North Korean forces {{suffered}} {{a shortage of}} men and equipment; their divisions were far understrength. Opposing <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Koreans,</b> from west to east, were the 8th, 12th, and 5th Divisions and the 766th Independent Infantry Regiment. On 5 August, the NK 8th Division was estimated to have 8,000 men, the NK 5th Division had 6,000 men, the NK 12th Division had 6,000 men and the 766th Independent Regiment had 1,500 men, giving these units a total strength of at least 21,500.|$|E

5|$|With the ROK army in retreat, the 766th Regiment, 549th Unit, and KPA's 5th Divisions all {{advanced}} steadily {{south along}} the eastern roads without encountering much resistance. Across the entire front the North Korean Army had successfully routed <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Koreans</b> and was pushing them south. The 766th Regiment acted as an advance force, attempting to infiltrate further inland as it moved through the mountainous eastern region of the country. The rugged terrain of the eastern regions of Korea, poor communication equipment, and unreliable resupply lines thwarted the South Korean resistance. The North Koreans used this to their advantage in advancing but they began to experience the same problems themselves. The 5th Division and the two other units began advancing south slowly and cautiously, sending strong reconnaissance parties into the mountains to ensure {{they would not be}} threatened from the rear. However, this more cautious advance began to give <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Koreans</b> valuable time to build up further south. By June 28, the 766th had infiltrated into Taebaek-san from Uljin and was moving toward Ilwolsan, Yongyang and Cheongsong in order to block communications between Daegu and Busan, where United States Army forces were landing in an attempt to support the collapsing ROK Army.|$|E
5|$|With the US forces {{accepting}} the North Korean attack {{as an act}} of war, it became imperative to evacuate civilians and American diplomats from Korea, as the forces of the north and south were battling across the peninsula. On June 27 <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Koreans</b> were losing the First Battle of Seoul. Most of South Korea's forces retreated {{in the face of the}} invasion. The North Koreans would capture the city the next day forcing the South Korean government and its shattered army to retreat further south.|$|E
5|$|Faced {{with the}} sudden {{appearance}} of the overwhelming Chinese forces, the ROK 1st Infantry Division tried to establish defensive positions by capturing the hills around Unsan. <b>The</b> <b>South</b> <b>Koreans</b> soon {{found themselves in a}} seesaw battle with the PVA 360th Regiment during the night of 25 October. The next day, the PVA 39th Corps arrived at the west of Unsan while cutting the road between Unsan and Yongsan-dong, completely surrounding the ROK 1st Infantry Division. Aided by airdrops, the US 6th Medium Tank Battalion and the US 10th Anti-Aircraft Artillery Group, the ROK 1st Infantry Division reopened the road on 27 October. Several more attempts to advance north by the Koreans made little progress, and the fighting stopped by 28 October.|$|E

5|$|South Korean forces, meanwhile, had emplaced in {{the wrong}} position, a mile too far south, and were not in contact with 19th Infantry. The South Korean forces were {{subsequently}} hit with friendly and enemy fire, and in the confusion the 19th Infantry attempted to block <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Koreans</b> from advancing, thinking them enemy forces. North Korean snipers were able to infiltrate {{the rear of the}} position and kill five UN soldiers with shots {{to the back of the}} head. However American forces repelled several advances on the right flank. The M4 Shermans gave the American force a superiority in armor over the North Koreans for the first time, and were crucial in pushing back each attempted North Korean advance. North Korean infantry, unsupported by armor of their own, suffered heavy casualties from the American forces in their positions on the high ground.|$|E
5|$|With Taejon captured, North Korean forces began {{surrounding}} the Pusan Perimeter {{from all sides}} {{in an attempt to}} envelop it. The 4th and 6th North Korean Infantry Divisions advanced south in a wide flanking maneuver. The two divisions attempted to envelop the UN′s left flank, but became extremely spread out in the process. At the same time, the NK 5th and 12th Division pressured <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Koreans</b> on the right flank. They advanced on UN positions with armor and superior numbers, repeatedly defeating U.S. and South Korean forces and forcing them further south. On 21 July, the NK 12th Division was ordered by the II North Korean Corps to capture P'ohang-dong by 26 July.|$|E

Similarly, Chung Il-kwon replaced the 2nd Battalion of the ROK 32nd Regiment with the 2nd Battalion of the ROK 17th Regiment. Later that day both US battalions captured Hill 598 and Sandy Ridge after meeting only light resistance, but the Chinese tunnels and a counterattack by the PVA 135th Regiment prevented the Americans from advancing towards Pike's Peak and Jane Russell Hill. <b>The</b> <b>South</b> <b>Koreans,</b> on the other hand, were thrown back by a Chinese counterattack after recapturing Sniper Ridge.|$|E
5|$|By December 15, 1950, the ROK 1st Infantry Division {{had retreated}} {{back to the}} town of Choksong on the {{southern}} bank of the Imjin River—its original defensive position {{at the start of the}} Korean War. On the right flank of the ROK 1st Infantry Division, the ROK 6th Infantry Division was located at the north of Dongducheon along the southern bank of the Hantan River. The ROK 1st Infantry Division planned to defend the Imjin River by placing its 11th and 12th Regiments at the west and the east side of Choksong respectively, while the ROK 6th Infantry Division defended the Route 33 at the Hantan River by placing its 7th and 19th Regiments on each side of the road. Both the ROK 15th Regiment of the 1st Infantry Division and the ROK 2nd Regiment of the 6th Infantry Division were placed in the rear as reserves. <b>The</b> <b>South</b> <b>Koreans</b> had also constructed numerous bunkers, barbed wire obstacles and minefields on both banks of the river in order to strengthen defenses and to maintain troop morale.|$|E
5|$|East of the NK and ROK 8th Divisions, the NK 12th Division {{crossed the}} Naktong River at Andong, {{moving through the}} {{mountains}} in small groups to reach P'ohang-dong.
