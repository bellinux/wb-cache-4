In 1954, Holloman's last professional season, he spent time on five different minor league squads, including former stops Toronto and Augusta, before retiring. The retirement was partially due to a sore arm, the result of pitching too frequently while playing winter ball. After retiring, Holloman became a truck driver and ran an advertising agency, {{and served as a}} scout for the Baltimore Orioles. He also turned to drinking for many years, but was able to overcome <b>the</b> <b>addiction.</b> He died on May 1, 1987 at the age of 64 in Athens, Georgia of a heart attack.|$|E
5|$|Narayan {{shared a}} close {{relationship}} with his older brother, Chatur Lal, who learned the tabla primarily to accompany his brother's sarangi playing. Lal studied under tabla teachers in his youth, but later turned to farming. Lal visited Narayan 1948 in Delhi after Narayan had become a professional sarangi player, and Narayan convinced Lal to work as a tabla player at the local AIR station. Lal became an acclaimed musician, toured with instrumentalists Ravi Shankar and Ali Akbar Khan in the 1950s, and helped popularise the tabla in Western countries. When Lal died in October 1965, Narayan had difficulty performing and struggled with alcoholism, but overcame <b>the</b> <b>addiction</b> after two years. Narayan assisted his brother's four children after their father's death. Chatur Lal's son, Charanjit Lal Biyavat, is a tabla player and has toured Europe with Narayan.|$|E

Throughout her career, Lansbury supported a variety of charities, particularly those such as Abused Wives in Crisis that combated domestic abuse and those who worked toward rehabilitating drug users.

In early life she had been a chain smoker, giving up <b>the</b> <b>addiction</b> cold turkey in the mid-1960s.

Since Facebook use is new yet, it can be stated that researches on <b>the</b> Facebook <b>addiction</b> are at <b>the</b> beginning level. For this reason, determining factors leading to <b>the</b> Facebook <b>addiction</b> has gained importance. In this context, in this study, relationships between attachment styles and <b>the</b> Facebook <b>addiction</b> were examined. <b>The</b> participants of the study were 322 university students [145 (45 %) male, 177 (55 %) female, Mage= 20. 61 years, SD= 1. 82]. In the study, the Personal Information Form, the Relationship Scales Questionnaire and <b>the</b> Facebook <b>Addiction</b> Scale were administered. The relationships between attachment styles and <b>the</b> Facebook <b>addiction</b> were calculated via using the Pearson correlation analysis. The Pearson correlation analysis results indicated that <b>the</b> Facebook <b>addiction</b> was negatively related with the secure and dismissing attachment style and positively related with the preoccupied attachment style. No relationship was found between the fearful attachment style and <b>the</b> Facebook <b>addiction.</b> If <b>the</b> attachment styles predicted <b>the</b> Facebook <b>addiction</b> was examined via using the stepwise regression analysis.

After Cuddy makes a bet to prove House's addiction to Vicodin, House concedes to Wilson {{that he has}} an addiction but says that <b>the</b> <b>addiction</b> is not a problem. It is, in fact, Wilson who usually writes House's Vicodin prescriptions (with Cuddy writing a few merely for leverage in her dealings with House). In Season 3, when Detective Michael Tritter (David Morse) threatens to jail House for his Vicodin addiction after finding a huge stash in his apartment, Wilson {{attempts to}} convince House to go to rehab as the situation worsens. After Tritter pressures Wilson to testify several times, Wilson reluctantly agrees, unknown to House. Before this, Wilson watches House punch Dr. Robert Chase, insult Cuddy, and incorrectly diagnose {{a child with a}} condition that would have required the amputation of her left arm and leg.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{need for}} medical {{students}} {{to engage with}} patients with addictive problems is projected to increase in coming years.

Summary of Work: The SSC is assessed by a final student report which includes a self-reflective section. The free text data from this section of 28 qualitative reports over 7 years was analysed using content analysis. Summary of Results: Students were clear they believed the experience of the SSC had increased their understanding of both the psychological and social complexity related to <b>the</b> <b>addictions</b> and <b>the</b> role of medicine within this. Conclusions: We discovered that the SSC Lay and Professional Perspectives on <b>the</b> <b>Addictions</b> not only gave students first-hand experience of those suffering from and treating addictive problems, but also had a positive effect on their attitude towards this group...|$|R

25|$|Psychoanalysis, a psychotherapeutic {{approach}} to behavior change developed by Sigmund Freud and modified by his followers, has also offered {{an explanation of}} substance abuse. This orientation suggests {{the main cause of}} <b>the</b> <b>addiction</b> syndrome is the unconscious need to entertain and to enact various kinds of homosexual and perverse fantasies, {{and at the same time}} to avoid taking responsibility for this. It is hypothesised specific drugs facilitate specific fantasies and using drugs is considered to be a displacement from, and a concomitant of, the compulsion to masturbate while entertaining homosexual and perverse fantasies. <b>The</b> <b>addiction</b> syndrome is also hypothesised to be associated with life trajectories that have occurred within the context of traumatogenic processes, the phases of which include social, cultural and political factors, encapsulation, traumatophilia, and masturbation as a form of self-soothing. Such an approach lies in stark contrast to the approaches of social cognitive theory to addiction—and indeed, to behavior in general—which holds human beings regulate and control their own environmental and cognitive environments, and are not merely driven by internal, driving impulses. Additionally, homosexual content is not implicated as a necessary feature in addiction.|$|E
