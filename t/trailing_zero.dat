50|$|Each digit has a neighbor, i.e., the digit on its right. The {{rightmost}} digit's {{neighbor is}} the <b>trailing</b> <b>zero.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Trailing</b> <b>zeros</b> to {{the right}} of a decimal point, as in 12.3400, do not affect the value of a number and may be omitted if all that is of {{interest}} is its numerical value. This is true even if the zeros recur infinitely. For example, in pharmacy, <b>trailing</b> <b>zeros</b> are omitted from dose values to prevent misreading. However, <b>trailing</b> <b>zeros</b> may be useful for indicating the number of significant figures, for example in a measurement. In such a context, [...] "simplifying" [...] a number by removing <b>trailing</b> <b>zeros</b> would be incorrect.|$|R
50|$|In {{a number}} without a decimal point, <b>trailing</b> <b>zeros</b> {{may or may}} not be significant. More {{information}} through additional graphical symbols or explicit information on errors is needed to clarify the significance of <b>trailing</b> <b>zeros.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{bottleneck}} in {{the binary}} GCD algorithm is a loop removing <b>trailing</b> <b>zeros,</b> {{which can be}} replaced by a count <b>trailing</b> <b>zeros</b> (ctz) followed by a shift. A similar loop appears in computations of the hailstone sequence.|$|R
5000|$|Note {{that the}} scale factor is 20/2, {{which allows the}} <b>trailing</b> <b>zero</b> to be droppedfrom all values inside the subroutine.|$|E
5000|$|Examples of {{explicit}} file sequences include: , , , , [...] (five trailing zeroes), and another with a hexadecimal ordering of 256 files , , , , , ..., , , ..., , ..., [...] (with just one <b>trailing</b> <b>zero).</b>|$|E
50|$|If {{the ship}} is fitted with an Inmarsat A ship earth station, or has {{satellite}} equipment other than Inmarsat, then the identity needs no <b>trailing</b> <b>zero.</b>|$|E

5000|$|If bits {{are labeled}} {{starting}} at 1 (which is the convention {{used in this}} article), then count <b>trailing</b> <b>zeros</b> and find first set operations are related by [...] (except when the input is zero). If bits are labeled starting at 0, then count <b>trailing</b> <b>zeros</b> and find first set are exactly equivalent operations.|$|R
50|$|The {{same number}} of decimal places {{should be used in}} each value, {{including}} <b>trailing</b> <b>zeroes.</b>|$|R
50|$|The formula {{actually}} {{counts the}} number of factors 5 in n, but since {{there are at least}} as many factors 2, this is equivalent to {{the number of}} factors 10, each of which gives one more <b>trailing</b> <b>zero.</b>|$|E
50|$|Because all {{of these}} values are {{multiples}} of ten, one can arrive at simplified values by removing the <b>trailing</b> <b>zero</b> from each point total. For instance, a pinochle has a simplified score of 4, a double Pinochle would score 30.|$|E
5000|$|As in the men's table above, {{sports are}} ranked {{in order of}} total {{possible}} scholarships. Numbers for head-count sports are indicated without a decimal point; those for equivalency sports are indicated with a decimal point, with a <b>trailing</b> <b>zero</b> if needed.|$|E
5000|$|The short format usually uses slashes or dashes in a day/month/year format: [...] the <b>trailing</b> <b>zeros</b> being optional.|$|R
2500|$|The CRC may be {{inverted}} {{before being}} appended {{to the message}} stream. [...] While an unmodified CRC distinguishes between messages [...] with different numbers of <b>trailing</b> <b>zeroes,</b> it does not detect <b>trailing</b> <b>zeroes</b> appended after the CRC remainder itself. [...] This is because all valid codewords are multiples of , so [...] times that codeword is also a multiple. [...] (In fact, this is precisely why the first variant described above works.) ...|$|R
5000|$|Avoiding <b>trailing</b> <b>zeros</b> on decimals: e.g. 0.5 {{instead of}} [...]50 or 0.50 to avoid {{misinterpretation}} of [...]50 as 50.|$|R
50|$|Sports {{are ranked}} {{according}} to total possible scholarships (number of teams x number of scholarships per team).

50|$|The {{number of}} {{scholarships}} that Division I members may award in each sport is listed below.

50|$|The {{number of}} {{trailing}} zeros in a non-zero base-b integer n equals the exponent {{of the highest}} power of b that divides n. For example, 14000 has three trailing zeros and is therefore divisible by 1000 = 103, but not by 104. This property is useful when looking for small factors in integer factorization. Some computer architectures have a count trailing zeros operation in their instruction set for efficiently determining the number of <b>trailing</b> <b>zero</b> bits in a machine word.|$|E
5000|$|Node {{numbers were}} {{originally}} set at 3 digits in length. Due to the extensive {{growth of the}} IRLP network, an extra digit needed to be added in 2002. Existing node numbers after this change received a <b>trailing</b> <b>zero.</b> For example, if the old node number was 123, it became 1230. Most existing reflectors were also converted from single channels to 10 channels. This new type of reflector {{was known as a}} super-reflector. After all the reflectors were converted the [...] "super-" [...] was dropped.|$|E
50|$|Another {{test for}} divisibility is to {{separate}} a number into groups of two consecutive digits (adding a leading zero {{if there is}} an odd number of digits), and then add up the numbers so formed; if the result is divisible by 11, the number is divisible by 11. For instance, if the number is 65,637, 06 + 56 + 37 = 99, which is divisible by 11, so 65,637 is divisible by eleven. This also works by adding a <b>trailing</b> <b>zero</b> instead of a leading one: 65 + 63 + 70 = 198, which is divisible by 11. This also works with larger groups of digits, providing that each group has an even number of digits (not all groups have to have the same number of digits).|$|E

50|$|In mathematics, <b>trailing</b> <b>zeros</b> are a {{sequence}} of 0 in the decimal representation (or more generally, in any positional representation) of a number, after which no other digits follow.|$|R
50|$|Count leading <b>zeros</b> {{and count}} <b>trailing</b> <b>zeros</b> {{can be used}} {{together}} to implement Gosper's loop-detection algorithm, which can find the period of a function of finite range using limited resources.|$|R
50|$|Count <b>Trailing</b> <b>Zeros</b> (ctz) {{counts the}} number of zero bits {{succeeding}} the least significant one bit. For example, the ctz of 0x00000F00 is 8, and the ctz of 0x80000000 is 31.|$|R
