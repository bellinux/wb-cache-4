50|$|In {{his most}} recent {{exhibition}} (the DNA Study series), Binion’s paintings aren’t fully abstract, but attempt {{to talk about the}} black experience and his personal history at the same time. Acting as a kind of <b>template</b> <b>for</b> gridded <b>marks</b> in black, white and occasionally brightly colored oil-paint-stick layered on top, are pages from Binion’s 1970's handwritten phone books, passport ID and negatives of his birth certificate. To fully experience this artist's work, the viewer/participant must get close to the piece of art. Underneath the horizontal and vertical lines of various hues a story is being told. Binion painstakingly combines his personal story with abstract shapes and patterns which are interesting to view as they draw you into the story of the artist.|$|R
40|$|Professor Linford, unlike Caesar’s Antony, seeks {{not only}} to bury Abercrombie, but to praise it, at least in part. Using {{linguistic}} evidence, both historical and experimental, he would relocate a bobbled boundary—from the descriptive–suggestive transition to the suggestive–arbitrary transition—and thereby establish a reformed <b>template</b> <b>for</b> sorting word <b>marks</b> according to their source-signifying strength. The basic difference between acquired and inherent distinctiveness not only remains in Linford’s account, however; it draws new strength from insights about semantic change. Behold, Abercrombie 2. 0 ! His recent article, which is both provocative and engaging, continues the reconstructive work Linford began in his critique of the conventional view that a generic word can never serve as a trademark, even if a substantial share of consumers have come to perceive it as a source signifier...|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} styles of jig {{available}} commercially. Fundamentally, all push jigs {{are similar in}} that they allow the user to clamp the jig tool in some way. The jig then has some means of placing {{the centre of the}} Forstner bit into to the centre of the marked hole, in a way that a 90º angle is maintained respect to the door surface. A very common approach is to have a simple cardboard or aluminium <b>template</b> with <b>marks</b> <b>for</b> the distances to the door edges; these type of jigs are normally used with a hand drill fixed to a pedestal, for stability.|$|R
40|$|AbstractVisual marking {{refers to}} the {{phenomenon}} in which old items in a visual search are excluded from the search when new items appear in the visual field. Visual marking may result from inhibition of irrelevant information {{at the location of}} old items before new items appear. Moreover, sensitivity to increments in contrast at the old locations {{has been shown to be}} lower than that to increments at the new locations. We used equivalent noise analysis to examine whether the reduction in sensitivity is the result of an increase in internal noise or a decrease in calculation efficiency. Following a search in which reaction time was measured, participants were asked to indicate whether a Gaussian luminance blob was present. Parameters estimated from the threshold-versus-noise contrast function indicated that calculation efficiency at old locations was lower than that at new locations, and internal noise did not increase at old locations but rather decreased slightly. Thus, the reduction in sensitivity at old locations is attributable a decrease in calculation efficiency. These data suggest that an inhibitory <b>template</b> <b>for</b> visual <b>marking</b> may benefit visual search by diverting limited attentional resources, such as time and resolution, away from previewed locations and reserving them for the target search...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn an inefficient visual search task, {{when some}} {{distractors}} (old items) temporally precede some others (new items), the old items {{are excluded from}} the search, a phenomenon termed visual marking. This effect is said to occur because {{the locations of the}} old items are inhibited before the new items appear. The present study used a probe-detection task to examine whether this inhibition occurs only at the precise locations of old items or at and around the locations of old items. We also investigated the effect of inhibition overreaching boundaries to encompass neighboring regions. Participants searched for a target or detected a probe that appeared after the new items appeared. The results revealed that the probe reaction times at locations inside grouped regions were longer than those at a blank region where no items had been presented and were comparable to those at a location occupied by old items. Probe detection was not delayed when the probe was presented near but external to the external boundary of the grouped regions. The overreaching effect was obtained before and after the new items appeared. We conclude that the inhibitory <b>template</b> <b>for</b> visual <b>marking</b> represents clusters of old items for at least 200 ms before the onset of new items, and that this spatial schema is preserved until at least 200 ms after the onset of new items...|$|R
40|$|A frame/object {{hierarchy}} of document templates and documents A document template is a frame with a slot for {{each part of}} the document (a part can be a single line or part of a line). Many slots have a procedure attached; the procedure obtains the information from a database, if it is available, or displays a menu of possible values, or asks the user a question. The document templates are arranged in a hierarchy, so that the slots in common to all documents of a class, such as meeting announcements, need to be specified only once; these slots than inherit down to all descendants of the class.

40|$|Abstract: The recent National Students Survey {{showed that}} {{feedback}} to students was an ongoing problem in Higher Education. This paper {{reports on the}} extension of our past research into the provision of automated feedback for objective testing. In the research presented here, the system has been further developed <b>for</b> <b>marking</b> practical and essay questions and providing automated feedback. Recent research at the University of Hertfordshire was {{able to show that}} learners and tutors accept and value our automated feedback approach based on objective tests and Computer Adaptive Testing. The research reported in this paper is an important extension to this work. The automated feedback system developed for objective testing has been extended to include practical testing and essay type questions. The automated feedback system, which can be used within any subject area, is based on a simple marking scheme created by the subject tutor as a text file according to a simple <b>template.</b> <b>Marks</b> <b>for</b> each option and a set of feedback statements are held within a database on a computer. As <b>marks</b> are awarded <b>for</b> each question by the teacher an individual feedback file is created automatically for each learner. Teachers may also add and modify comments to each learner and save additional feedback to the database for later use. Each individual feedback file was emailed automatically to learners. The development of the system is explained in the paper and testing and evaluation with 350 first year (1 final practical test), 120 second year (1 written and 1 practical tests) and 100 final year (1 final practical test...|$|R
