40|$|Sound {{perceived}} via Bone Conduction (BC) {{consists of}} vibrations {{transmitted to the}} cochleae through the skull bone from either one's own voice, the surrounding sound field, or a BC transducer. In <b>two-way</b> <b>communication</b> <b>systems,</b> BC is believed to improve the sound quality when used in specific environments, e. g. extremely noisy environments which require hearing protection devices in the ear-canals. Several studies were performed to investigate the possibilities for a BC <b>communication</b> <b>system</b> and to increase the general knowledge of BC sound perception. The difference in sensitivity of the BC and Air Conduction (AC) parts of one's own voice was estimated, showing that the BC component dominated for most sounds between 1 and 2 kHz. Also estimated was the sensitivity difference between BC and AC sound from a surrounding sound field, demonstrating that the BC part was 40 to 60 dB lower than the AC part. A combination of these sensitivity differences provides information about the signal-to-noise improvement by using a BC microphone to record a person's own voice, instead of an ordinary AC microphone {{in front of the}} mouth, in a noisy environment. However, high-frequency losses occur in the signal when recording through the skin. In many of the investigations the occlusion effect was studied by different methods in order to estimate the low-frequency increase in perceived BC sound when wearing ear-plugs and/or ear-muffs. Moreover, the amount of BC sound reaching the cochleae from different positions of the skull bone was examined with the conclusion that relative BC hearing can be estimated from ear-canal sound pressure and cochlear vibrations. Finally, a new transcutaneous Bone Conduction Implant (BCI) hearing aid was investigated. This hearing aid does not require a permanent skin penetration, in contrast to the Bone-Anchored Hearing Aids (BAHAs) used today. Measurements showed that the new BCI hearing aid can be a realistic alternative to the BAHA...|$|R

40|$|In {{full-duplex}} wireless communications, {{transmission and}} reception of signals occur simultaneously {{on the same}} center carrier frequency. It is one technique to increase limited wireless capacity, and particularly the spectral efficiency. The challenge of full-duplex tehnique is to separate the weak received signal from the transmitted signal, which can be even 120 dB stronger signal. This is called self-interference. Current duplexing techniques used in existing <b>two-way</b> <b>communication</b> <b>systems</b> are either time or frequency division duplexing, where signals received and transmitted utilizes different carrier frequencies, or transmission and reception are done in different time slots. The usage of full-duplex communications may, in theory, double the spectral efficiency of a wireless link and thereon the corresponding wireless system. To cancel the self-interference, and to recover the received signal, the self-interference has to be modelled accurately. Particularly important {{is the ability to}} model the nonlinear nature of the self-interference, that is caused by power amplifiers. In this Master’s Thesis work, one recenty developed nonlinear self-interference model and corresponding nonlinear digital self-interference cancellation technique is explored.

This real-time Labview FPGA solution of digital self-interference canceller can, of the overall three-phase self-interference suppression solution, provide measured cancellation at maximum of about 34 dB. The other self-interference cancellation or isolation methods used in measurements are a passive circulator with 20 dB attenuation, and an active RF-canceller, that at measurements provided about 43 dB cancellation. Thus the total real-time cancellation of the self-interference in the overall demonstration system is maximally nearly 100 dB.
