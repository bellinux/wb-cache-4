40|$|Under {{plausible}} circumstances, a monopolist in one {{market can}} use its control of prices in that market to force competing downstream buyers to sign tying contracts that will lever its monopoly into another market. Specifically, the monopolist of <b>the</b> <b>tying</b> good can place each downstream buyer in a prisoner's dilemma by offering them more favorable pricing on <b>the</b> <b>tying</b> good if they sign a requirements-tying contract covering <b>the</b> <b>tied</b> good. Since a buyer benefits on receiving more favorable pricing on <b>the</b> <b>tying</b> good and <b>the</b> competitors do not, and suffers if the competitors receive more favorable pricing on <b>the</b> <b>tying</b> good and <b>the</b> buyer does not, buyers will sign <b>the</b> <b>tying</b> contract {{even when they}} would earn higher profits if they all refused to sign. This enables a monopolist in one market to inefficiently exclude an entrant in another market. Copyright 2007, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R

40|$|DE 1004024916 B UPAB: 20051130 NOVELTY - The {{method for}} <b>the</b> {{automatic}} <b>tying</b> up of especially a cubic object entails guiding <b>the</b> <b>tying</b> cord (10) around several deflection elements (6) installed {{on a platform}} (1), whereby <b>the</b> <b>tying</b> cord in a first section of the platform forms a tying pattern for {{one side of the}} object (11). The object is then laid over <b>the</b> <b>tying</b> pattern, and <b>the</b> first and second end section of <b>the</b> <b>tying</b> cord, and at least one intermediate section laid around the deflection elements outside the first section of the platform, are pulled over the object, after which the first and second end sections are interconnected on the object. The first gripper is made by common double-gripper, which is fixed to a robot arm. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a device for carrying out the proposed method.
