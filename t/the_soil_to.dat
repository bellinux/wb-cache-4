5|$|Advice on more {{productive}} techniques for farming {{began to appear}} in England in the mid-17th century, from writers such as Samuel Hartlib, Walter Blith and others. The main problem in sustaining agriculture in one place for a long time was the depletion of nutrients, most importantly nitrogen levels, in <b>the</b> <b>soil.</b> <b>To</b> allow <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> <b>to</b> regenerate, productive land was often let fallow and in some places crop rotation was used. The Dutch four-field rotation system was popularised by the British agriculturist Charles Townshend in the 18th century. The system (wheat, turnips, barley and clover), opened up a fodder crop and grazing crop allowing livestock to be bred year-round. The use of clover was especially important as the legume roots replenished soil nitrates.|$|E
5|$|Older trees {{sometimes}} grow epicormic shoots {{directly from}} their trunks after storm or ﬁre damage. Aerial rhizomes {{can also be}} produced from the trunk if it sustains damage or has become hollow, and grow down into <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> <b>to</b> regenerate the plant. Such regeneration can lead to trees of great age with multiple trunks.|$|E
5|$|The {{improvements}} {{of animal}} husbandry {{in the medieval}} period in Europe went {{hand in hand with}} other developments. Improvements to the plough allowed <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> <b>to</b> be tilled to a greater depth. Horses took over from oxen as the main providers of traction, new ideas on crop rotation were developed and the growing of crops for winter fodder gained ground. Peas, beans and vetches became common; they increased soil fertility through nitrogen fixation, allowing more livestock to be kept.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>soils</b> of <b>the</b> Pomerol {{region are}} very diverse {{with a mixture}} of gravel, sand and clay {{scattered}} across the plateau. Roughly speaking <b>the</b> vineyard <b>soils</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north and east, closer to the border of Saint-Émilion tend to have more clay while <b>the</b> <b>soils</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west and south become lighter and more gravelly. The plateau on which Pomerol sits is bordered by three rivers, the Barbanne to the north, the Isle to the west and Dordgogne and the city of Libourne to the south. As the terrain moves down the slopes of the plateau and towards these rivers <b>the</b> <b>soils</b> become more alluvial and sandy.|$|R
5|$|Their main tunnels {{are used}} for feeding and for escape: they can dig {{themselves}} underground very rapidly, and can move along existing tunnels at high speed both forwards and backwards. Their digging technique is to force <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> <b>to</b> either side with their powerful, shovel-like forelimbs, which are broad, flattened, toothed and heavily sclerotised (the cuticle is hardened and darkened).|$|E
5|$|Volcanic ash's {{primary use}} {{is that of}} a soil enricher. Once the {{minerals}} in ash are washed into the soil by rain or other natural processes, it mixes with <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> <b>to</b> create an andisol layer. This layer is highly rich in nutrients and is very good for agricultural use; the presence of lush forests on volcanic islands is often as a result of trees growing and flourishing in the phosphorus and nitrogen-rich andisol.|$|E
5|$|White rot of onions, leeks, {{and garlic}} {{is caused by}} the soil-borne fungus Sclerotium cepivorum. As the roots rot, the foliage turns yellow and wilts. The bases of the bulbs are {{attacked}} and become covered by a fluffy white mass of mycelia, which later produces small, globular black structures called sclerotia. These resting structures remain in <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> <b>to</b> reinfect a future crop. No cure for this fungal disease exists, so affected plants should be removed and destroyed and the ground used for unrelated crops in subsequent years.|$|E
50|$|A {{risk with}} the {{placement}} of water wells is soil salination which occurs when the water table of <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> begins <b>to</b> drop and salt begins <b>to</b> accumulate as <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> begins <b>to</b> dry out. Another environmental problem that is very prevalent in water well drilling {{is the potential for}} methane to seep through.|$|R
50|$|The {{accumulation}} of alkalinity in a soil (as Na, K, Ca and Mg bicarbonates and carbonates) occurs {{when there is}} insufficient water flowing through <b>the</b> <b>soils</b> <b>to</b> leach soluble salts. This {{may be due to}} arid conditions, or poor internal soil drainage; in these situations most of the water that enters <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> is transpired (taken up by plants) or evaporates, rather than flowing through <b>the</b> <b>soil.</b>|$|R

5|$|With {{the success}} of these projects, IPF has been doing {{revegetation}} projects along the road below the Top Cut since 2004. Compost blankets were applied to large sections of <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> <b>to</b> replace lost nutrients. In 2009 the foundation began removing metal and rebar snow fences embedded in the soil just below the pass summit during the 1960s as part of an abortive project to increase meltwater capture by the Twin Lakes Tunnel. They were an aesthetic blight as well as an environmental problem, and had to be removed using a team of mules and helicopters due to the wilderness area restrictions. The last fence material was removed in 2012.|$|E
5|$|After Bunker Hill, Lafayette went to Maine and Vermont, thus visiting {{all of the}} states. He {{met again}} with John Adams, {{then went back to}} New York and then to its rival city, Brooklyn, where he laid the {{cornerstone}} for its public library. Lafayette celebrated his 68th birthday on 6 September at a reception with President John Quincy Adams at the White House, and departed the next day. He took with him, besides <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> <b>to</b> be placed on his grave, other gifts. Congress, at Monroe's request, had voted him $200,000 in gratitude for his services to the country, and a large tract of public lands in Florida. The passage back to France was aboard a ship that was originally called the Susquehanna, but was renamed the USS Brandywine in honor of the battle where the Marquis de Lafayette shed his blood for the United States.|$|E

40|$|Indiscriminate refuse dumping in {{and around}} Ado-Ekiti {{combined}} with improper management of few available dumpsites, such as Ilokun dumpsite, posed the threat of heavy metals pollution in <b>the</b> surrounding <b>soils</b> and underground water that needs assessment using pollution indices. Surface soils (0 - 15 cm) {{were taken from the}} centre of Ilokun dumpsite (0 m) and environs at different directions and distances during the dry and wet seasons, as well as a background sample at 1000 m away, adjacent to the dumpsite at Ilokun, Ado-Ekiti, Nigeria. The concentration of heavy metals used to calculate the pollution indices for <b>the</b> <b>soils</b> were determined using Atomic Adsorption Spectrophotometer. <b>The</b> <b>soils</b> recorded high concentrations of all the heavy metals above the background concentrations irrespective of the season with highest concentrations at the 0 m except Ni and Fe at 50 m during the dry and wet season, respectively. The heavy metals concentration were in the order of Ni > Mn > Pb > Cr > Cu > Cd > Fe during the dry season, and Fe > Cr > Cu > Pb > Ni > Cd > Mn during the wet season. Using the Contamination Factor (CF), <b>the</b> <b>soils</b> were classified <b>to</b> be moderately contaminated with Cd and Fe to very high contamination with other metals during the dry season and low Cd contamination (0. 87), moderate contamination with Fe, Pb, Mn and Ni and very high contamination with Cr and Cu during the wet season. At both seasons, the Pollution Load Index (PLI) indicates <b>the</b> <b>soils</b> <b>to</b> be generally polluted with heavy metals and the Geoaccumulation Index (Igeo) calculated shown <b>the</b> <b>soils</b> <b>to</b> be in unpolluted to moderately polluted levels. Enrichment Factor (EF) implied <b>the</b> <b>soils</b> <b>to</b> be deficiently enriched with all the heavy metals except Cr (7. 90) and Cu (6. 42) that were at significantly enrichment levels during the wet season. Modified Degree of Contamination (mCd) recorded, indicated <b>the</b> <b>soils</b> <b>to</b> be of very high to extremely high degree of contamination during the dry season and moderate degree of contamination during the wet season except 0 m with high degree of contamination. The concentration of heavy metals in <b>the</b> <b>soils</b> combined with some of the pollution indices indicated <b>the</b> <b>soils</b> {{in and around}} the Ilokun Dumpsite are being polluted with heavy metals from anthropogenic sources constituted by the indiscriminate refuse dumping...|$|R

40|$|The {{quantitative}} {{effects of}} increasing the organic matter contents of three soils upon their susceptibility to compaction, the recovery of tilth after compaction and the fertility of <b>the</b> <b>soils</b> were investigated. These effects were further studied on the production of bush bean (Phaseolus vulgaris). Soil consistency limits, soil water status, applied pressure and organic matter contents were used to predict shear strength, penetration resistance and water retention characteristics of compacted <b>soils,</b> with <b>the</b> aim of meeting the widespread demand for possible techniques of soil compaction prediction. <b>Soil</b> compaction increased <b>the</b> ability of <b>the</b> <b>soils</b> <b>to</b> retain moisture, increased penetration resistance, shear strength and decreased the available water capacity of <b>soils.</b> On <b>the</b> other hand, organic matter increased the ability of <b>the</b> <b>soils</b> <b>to</b> retain moisture, expanded the available water capacity and decreased the penetration resistance and shear strength of compacted soils. Although <b>soil</b> compaction increased <b>the</b> stem diameter of bush bean; the height, yields and root dry matter of the crop decreased with higher compaction levels. On the contrary, higher organic matter levels increased the plant and yield parameters of the crop...|$|R

25|$|The Margaux {{appellation}} {{encompasses the}} village of Margaux and the neighboring villages of Arsac, Labarde, Soussans and Cantenac. It is the most southerly of Médoc's appellations.

25|$|The {{mouldboard}} plough greatly reduced {{the amount of}} time needed to prepare a field, and as a consequence, allowed a farmer to work a larger area of land. In addition, the resulting pattern of low (under the mouldboard) and high (beside it) ridges in the soil forms water channels, allowing <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> <b>to</b> drain. In areas where snow buildup causes difficulties, this lets farmers plant the soil earlier, as the snow runoff drains away more quickly.|$|E
