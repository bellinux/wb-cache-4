The plain is gashed with numerous and dangerous chasms, from four to ten feet wide, and of great depth.

As their friendship reignites with <b>this</b> <b>wild</b> and joyous Scottish dance, Pasquinel collapses in agony. It is the old arrowhead acting up, so McKeag and other trappers undertake a dangerous operation to remove it. They succeed, and McKeag gives the ever-vengeful Jacques the arrowhead. But later on, when the healing Pasquinel asks McKeag to rejoin him so that he won't be alone, McKeag refuses and leaves once again.|$|E
500|$|In {{terms of}} dominance, the ruffed lemur's social {{structure}} {{is not as}} clear-cut as other lemur societies where female dominance is the norm. Although it is historically reported that [...] "males were subordinate to females," [...] especially with captive and free-ranging ruffed lemur populations demonstrating <b>this,</b> <b>wild</b> populations cannot be definitively labeled as matriarchal due to inter-group variation.|$|E

500|$|Some {{have seen}} Enkyō {{as a student}} and perhaps the sole {{successor}} of Sharaku. [...] There are no records of ukiyo-e artists other than Sharaku and Enkyō making aiban-sized ōkubi-e yakusha-e during the Edo period. [...] The German writer [...] asserted Enkyō was Sharaku, who had assumed a new identity to revive his career. [...] The American Arthur Davison Ficke called this idea [...] "an alluring but somewhat fantastic theory, which neither the documentary nor the internal evidence... adequately supports", and James A. Michener agreed this was a [...] "fanciful theory... but nothing in the artistic content of Kabukidō's prints supports <b>this</b> <b>wild</b> guess", though [...] "some of Sharaku's later triptychs... are occasionally as dull as known Kabukidōs".|$|E

50|$|Arguably Wilding's finest {{season was}} the 2002-03 season. In the FA Cup third round, Shrewsbury famously {{defeated}} Everton 2-1. Whilst Nigel Jemson grabbed {{most of the}} headlines by scoring both goals, Wilding had a superb game, completely marking Wayne Rooney out of the game. Sadly for Shrewsbury, their form dipped {{in the latter half}} of the season, eventually finishing bottom of the Football League Third Division. Despite <b>this,</b> <b>Wilding</b> was seen as one of the side's best players that season, and escaped much of the intense criticism levelled at some of his 'big name' teammates.|$|R

500|$|A {{week after}} the Grand Final and still on a high from the premiership win, Nash opened the bowling for his {{district}} club South Melbourne against Australian captain Bill Woodfull's team, Carlton. Mindful of the upcoming Test tour of England, Nash thought he could impress Woodfull by bowling him a series of short pitched deliveries, eventually hitting him over the heart (Woodfull had been hit just under the heart by Harold Larwood during the Bodyline series). Nash dismissed Woodfull caught and bowled later that over for 15 but did not realise that [...] "there was {{no way in the}} world Woodfull would take <b>this</b> <b>wild</b> and slightly uncouth cricketer with him to England in the current political climate (or perhaps any other)" [...] and was not chosen for the subsequent tour of England.|$|E
500|$|The Arizona Republics Randy Cordova {{gave the}} film a {{positive}} review, calling the film [...] "... an exploitation flick that {{knows what it}} wants to do, and it gets the job done expertly." [...] and a [...] "... Mecca for B-movie lovers." [...] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle enjoyed the film, asking his readers [...] "... {{if you can find}} a better time at the movies this year than <b>this</b> <b>wild</b> comic thriller, let me in on it." [...] Boston Globe reviewer Ty Burr reacted to Samuel L. Jackson's performance by saying he [...] "... bestrides this film with the authority of someone who knows the value of honest bilge. He's as much the auteur of this baby as the director and screenwriters, and that fierce glimmer in his eye is partly joy." ...|$|E
500|$|In a press release, Jared Leto {{explained}} the meaning behind the music video: City of Angels' {{is a short}} film about <b>this</b> <b>wild,</b> weird, and wonderful land, Los Angeles, California. A place that has left its mark on the world's imagination and a place where dreams can actually come true. I made this short film so I could share my thoughts on this incredibly special place and talk to others about theirs. It's {{not so much about}} this particular city but more about the people who inhabit it." [...] He further said, [...] "It's a story about hope and dreams. It's a story about people making the impossible possible—whether it's Kanye West, James Franco, or a kid who's living on the streets on Hollywood Boulevard. It's a story about survival and about what it takes to become who you really want to be." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{first wave}} of punk rock was aggressively modern, {{distancing}} itself from the bombast and sentimentality of early 1970s rock. According to Ramones drummer Tommy Ramone, [...] "In its initial form, a lot of [...] stuff was innovative and exciting. Unfortunately, {{what happens is that}} people who could not hold a candle to the likes of Hendrix started noodling away. Soon you had endless solos that went nowhere. By 1973, I knew that what was needed was some pure, stripped down, no bullshit rock 'n' roll." [...] John Holmstrom, founding editor of Punk magazine, recalls feeling [...] "punk rock had to come along because the rock scene had become so tame that [...] like Billy Joel and Simon and Garfunkel were being called rock and roll, when to me and other fans, rock and roll meant <b>this</b> <b>wild</b> and rebellious music." [...] In critic Robert Christgau's description, [...] "It was also a subculture that scornfully rejected the political idealism and Californian flower-power silliness of hippie myth." ...|$|E
500|$|... "(Anesthesia) - Pulling Teeth" [...] is a bass solo by Burton, {{accompanied}} on drums by Ulrich. A {{staple of}} Burton's live performances since {{his high school}} days in the band Agents of Misfortune, the instrumental track featured Burton's distinctive [...] "lead-bass" [...] style of playing, incorporating heavy distortion, use of wah-wah pedal and tapping. Bubacz introduces the track as [...] "Bass solo, take one", informing listeners that the song was recorded in one take. [...] "(Anesthesia) - Pulling Teeth" [...] was the bass solo that Burton was playing when Hetfield and Ulrich first saw him at a gig. Hetfield stated: [...] "We heard <b>this</b> <b>wild</b> solo going on and thought, 'I don't see any guitar player up there.' We were both counting the strings and I finally turned to Lars and said, 'Dude, that's a bass!' Cliff was up there on stage with his band Trauma with a wah-wah pedal and his huge mop of red hair. He didn't care whether people were there. He was {{looking down at his}} bass, playing." [...] "Whiplash" [...] was the album's first single, issued on August 8, 1983. It features a swift rhythm line of straight 16th notes played at about 200 beats per minute. Hetfield and Burton performed with palm muted technique and precise metronomic control. The lyrics celebrate crowd energy and headbanging. Rock journalist Mick Wall wrote that [...] "Whiplash" [...] signified the birth of thrash metal, stating: [...] "If one wishes to identify the very moment thrash metal arrived spitting and snarling into the world, 'Whiplash' is indisputably it." ...|$|E
