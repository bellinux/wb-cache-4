40|$|International audienceMore {{and more}} medical {{ultrasonic}} applications are strongly interested {{by the development}} of dual acoustic sources enable to emit high frequency ultrasound (echographic imaging) and low frequency pressure field (<b>therapeutic</b> <b>ultrasounds).</b> The use of the piezoelectricity to fabricate such device requires overcoming strong technological bottlenecks. The objective {{of this paper is to}} demonstrate that the technology of capacitive micro-machined ultrasonic transducer is able to take up this challenge. To this end a demonstrator was designed and manufactured. The first part of the paper is devoted to the design of the low and high frequency cMUTs. For the low acoustic source, a dedicated time domain model was used, taking into account the nonlinearity of the cMUT. Several simulations were conducted to optimize the emitted pressure field intensity at 1 MHz for a set of diaphragm with different sizes and geometries. The high frequency source was designed on the help of a linear model, where output parameters were central frequency, bandwidth and collapse voltage. The second part of this paper reports a set of characterization results and performances of the fabricated device: electrical impedance, mechanical displacements performed in water and acoustic pressure fields...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of study conducted by the In-stitute of Metrology of Bosnia and Herzegovina (IMBIH) that highlight the necessity of introducing metrology into medicine and defining standard regulations for inspections of medical devices. As it has been previously done for other kinds of de-vices that are under jurisdiction of the Institute of Metrology of BH, this research provides a foundation for the introduction of medical devices into the legal metrology system with precisely defined units of measurement, their ranges and errors. The study was based upon data collected through three clinical centers, 25 hospitals, 63 health centers and 320 private health institutions in BH over the course of one year. As a result of this study, the medical devices that have been in-troduced into the legal metrology system in BH include ECG devices, defibrillators, patient monitors, respirators, anesthesia machines, dialysis machines, pediatric and neonatal incuba-tors, <b>therapeutic</b> <b>ultrasounds,</b> infusion pumps and perfusors.

40|$|Abstract. [Purpose] The {{purpose of}} this study was to propose a table height that can reduce {{shoulder}} muscle fatigue by analyzing and comparing median frequencies of shoulder muscles at different table heights when per-forming <b>therapeutic</b> <b>ultrasounds</b> work. [Subjects and Methods] The subjects were 63 healthy male adults who were equally and randomly assigned to a standard height group (SHG), a high height group (HHG), and a low height group (LHG). The standard table height was set at the level of the elbow joint when the subjects flexed their elbow while in a sitting position. High height and low height were set 10 cm higher and 10 cm lower, respectively, than the standard height. Muscle fatigue of the upper trapezius, middle deltoid, rhomboid, and infraspinatus of the subjects was measured during ultrasound treatment work at each table height. [Results] Median frequencies of the upper trapezius, middle deltoid, rhomboid, and infraspinatus muscles were significantly lower in the HHG than in to the LHG. [Conclusion] When therapeutic ultrasound is performed using a table that has a height lower than that of the elbow joint, the median frequency of the shoulder muscle increases, hence decreasing muscle fatigue. This way, musculoskeletal pain as a result of performing therapeutic ultrasound can be prevented...|$|E

40|$|Context: <b>Therapeutic</b> <b>ultrasound</b> and {{electrical}} stimulation both claim to achieve many {{effects on the}} body, {{one of which is}} increasing blood flow in tissues. Research on electrical stimulation in regards to blood flow has shown both increased and decreased blood flow, due to the electrode placement and the muscular contractions elicited during the treatment, while research on <b>therapeutic</b> <b>ultrasound</b> has provided mixed results, some suggesting that increased blood flow is seen only with intolerable treatment intensities for the patients. The two treatments have not been previously compared in the same study. Objective: To compare radial artery blood flow following <b>therapeutic</b> <b>ultrasound</b> {{and electrical}} stimulation. Design: Cross-over study. Setting: University laboratory. Participants: Thirty-six healthy volunteers (22 females, 14 males; 21. 19 Â± 1. 65 years; 170. 96 Â± 9. 24 cm; 70. 69 Â± 11. 54 kg). Interventions: The participants were randomly assigned to <b>therapeutic</b> <b>ultrasound</b> or electrical stimulation for the first treatment session. The participants returned seven days later to receive the treatment they did not receive during the first treatment session. <b>Therapeutic</b> <b>ultrasound</b> was delivered at 1 MHz, continuous, 1. 5 W/cm 2, 10 minutes. The muscle belly of the flexor-pronator mass of the non-dominant forearm was used as the treatment site. Electrical stimulation was delivered at 2 -Hz burst mode, 8 pulses/burst, pulse duration 180 microseconds, 15 minutes. The motor points of the flexor-pronator mass was used as the treatment site. This was determined by a visible contraction of the wrist flexors. Diagnostic ultrasound was used to measure radial artery blood flow volume. Main Outcome Measures: Radial artery blood flow volume was recorded before treatment, immediately post-treatment, 5 minutes post-treatment and 10 minutes post-treatment. Results: There were no significant differences found between blood flow measurements when comparing <b>therapeutic</b> <b>ultrasound</b> and electrical stimulation. There were also no significant differences in blood flow when comparing measurements within <b>therapeutic</b> <b>ultrasound.</b> However, there was a significant decrease in blood flow found with electrical stimulation when comparing baseline to immediately post-treatment (P = 0. 04) and 5 minutes post-treatment (P = 0. 01), but not at 10 minutes post-treatment (P = 0. 16). Conclusions: Electrical stimulation temporarily reduces blood flow in the radial artery immediately following treatment and at 5 minutes following treatment. Electrical stimulation is useful in temporarily reducing blood flow and therefore may be beneficial in the control of edema or effusion...|$|R

40|$|<b>Therapeutic</b> <b>{{ultrasound}}</b> {{is defined}} as the use of ultrasound for the treatment of diseased or injured organs or bodily structures and is quite distinct from diagnostic ultrasound. There were many early attempts in the past to use ultrasound in therapy for a variety of applications and while some of these have not been pursued others have led on to clinical applications which are now used routinely. Such progress has been made possible by a number of factors including advances in transducer design, more accurate measurement and calibration of acoustic power and careful experiments to determine the precise nature of chemical processes taking place during and following the exposure of tissue to ultrasound. Major advances have been made in some fields where ultrasound is used such as physiotherapy, surgical instruments, chemotherapy, drug delivery and more recently, high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU).

40|$|CONTEXTUALIZAÇÃO: O ultra-som terapêutico (UST) é um recurso comumente aplicado na aceleração do reparo tecidual de lesões musculares. A absorção das ondas ultra-sônicas é determinada pela freqüência e pela intensidade, sendo que, em uma mesma intensidade, a profundidade atingida por 1 MHz é maior quando comparada a 3 MHz. OBJETIVO: Analisar o comportamento das propriedades mecânicas de músculos submetidos à lesão aguda por impacto e tratados com UST, utilizando as freqüências de 1 e 3 MHz. MATERIAIS E MÉTODOS: Foram utilizadas 40 ratas Wistar (200, 1 ± 17, 8 g), divididas em quatro grupos: (1) controle; (2) lesão muscular sem tratamento; (3) lesão muscular tratada com UST de freqüência 1 MHz (0, 5 W/cm²) e (4) lesão muscular tratada com UST de freqüência 3 MHz (0, 5 W/cm²).
