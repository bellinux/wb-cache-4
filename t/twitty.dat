5|$|On April 19, 2009, LMN aired Natalee Holloway, a {{television}} film based on Twitty's book Loving Natalee. Starring Tracy Pollan as Beth <b>Twitty,</b> Grant Show as Jug <b>Twitty,</b> Amy Gumenick as Natalee Holloway and Jacques Strydom as Van der Sloot, the film retells {{events leading up}} to the night of Holloway's disappearance in 2005, and the ensuing investigation in the aftermath. It was shot in South Africa.|$|E
5|$|Reports {{indicated}} that Holloway {{did not appear}} on any nighttime surveillance camera footage of her hotel's lobby; however, <b>Twitty</b> has made varying statements {{as to whether the}} cameras were operational that night. According to an April 19, 2006, statement made by <b>Twitty,</b> the video cameras at the Holiday Inn were not functioning the night Holloway vanished. <b>Twitty</b> has made other statements indicating that they were working, and has stated so in her book. Police Commissioner Jan van der Straaten —the initial head of the investigation until his 2005 retirement— said that Holloway did not {{have to go through the}} lobby to return to her room.|$|E
5|$|Holloway's family, however, {{took the}} {{opposite}} approach and criticized the lessening of coverage of her disappearance {{due to a}} shift in news priority when Hurricane Katrina struck on August 23, 2005. The saturation coverage of Holloway's disappearance was finally eclipsed by the hurricane. Beth <b>Twitty</b> and Dave Holloway alleged that Aruba {{took advantage of the}} extensive coverage of Hurricane Katrina to release the suspects, however the deadline for judicial review of Van der Sloot's detention was set long before Katrina.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Twittys</b> {{and their}} {{supporters}} criticized a perceived lack of progress by Aruban police. The Twittys' own actions in Aruba were also criticized, and the <b>Twittys</b> were accused of actively stifling any evidence that might impugn Holloway's character by asking her fellow students to remain silent about the case and using their access to the media to push {{their own version of}} events. The <b>Twittys</b> denied this.|$|R
2500|$|Since his death, <b>Twitty's</b> son Michael and {{grandson}} Tre {{have been}} carrying on his musical legacy. His most recent {{appearance on the}} country charts was a duet with Anita Cochran, [...] "(I Want to Hear) A Cheating Song" [...] (2004), which {{was made possible by}} splicing <b>Twitty's</b> vocal from old recordings and even interviews, recorded over the years. As a result, <b>Twitty's</b> isolated vocal track was transferred to a digital multitrack and digitally reassembled into the new performance. Like to the electronic duets of Patsy Cline and Jim Reeves, Hank Williams and Hank Williams, Jr. or Nat King Cole and Natalie Cole, Cochran added her vocal to backing tracks that had already been produced along with <b>Twitty's</b> reconstructed vocal.|$|R

5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Andrew Goldberg and {{directed}} by Cyndi Tang. According to Nielsen ratings, the episode was viewed in 7.21 million homes in its original airing. The episode received negative reviews for its use of a three-minute long live-action segment of Conway <b>Twitty.</b> Series regular Mike Henry provided the voice of O. J. Simpson, Cathy Cahlin Ryan guest starred as Fred Goldman's wife in a cutaway, and Jeff Bergman guest starred as a parody of Homer Simpson.|$|E
5|$|In June 2011—six {{years after}} Natalee's disappearance—Dave Holloway filed a {{petition}} with the Alabama courts seeking {{to have his}} daughter declared legally dead. The papers were served on Beth <b>Twitty,</b> his former wife, who announced her intention to oppose the petition. A hearing was held on September 23, 2011, at which time Probate Judge Alan King ruled that Dave Holloway had met the requirements for a legal presumption of death. On January 12, 2012, a second hearing was held, after which Judge King signed the order declaring Natalee Holloway to be dead.|$|E
5|$|On 24 January 1674, Bishop Fuller {{issued a}} decree {{dealing with the}} {{recommendations}} of the commissioners—a majority of all the Fellows should always be present at an election, so the Provost could not push an election in a thin meeting, and Fellows should be admitted immediately after their election. On 28 January Provost Say obtained from the King a recommendation for Twitty's election, but it was withdrawn on 13 February, following the Vice-Chancellor's refusal to swear <b>Twitty</b> into the University and the Bishop's protests at Court.|$|E
5000|$|Bixby left On Ramp Records {{to create}} his own label, Black Sheep Productions. His third album, Work in Progress, was {{released}} on August 13, 2013. Work in Progress features songs written by Bixby and a cover of Conway <b>Twitty's</b> [...] "It's Only Make Believe". The song is endorsed by Conway <b>Twitty's</b> daughter Kathy.|$|R
50|$|It was {{featured}} {{as part of}} a Hank Williams medley on Conway <b>Twitty's</b> 1971 album How Much More Can She Stand.|$|R
5000|$|The US version {{includes}} {{a cover of}} Conway <b>Twitty's</b> [...] "It's Only Make Believe", added as track #6 (after [...] "For Experience Sake" [...] and before [...] "Hunting Down a Killer").|$|R
5|$|The Sounds' home opener, {{scheduled}} for April 25, was rained out and pushed back to April 26. After playing their first ten games away from home, and with tractors and grading machines still preparing {{the field on}} game day, the Sounds played their first home game at Herschel Greer Stadium on April 26, 1978. The 12–4victory against the Savannah Braves was witnessed by a sellout crowd of 8,156 spectators. Southern League president Billy Hitchcock was on hand to witness the event, and Conway <b>Twitty</b> threw out the first pitch.|$|E
5|$|The {{projected}} construction cost of {{the stadium}} was between US$300,000 and $500,000; but the actual cost was over $1million. Schmittou looked to local suppliers to donate construction materials, took out a $30,000 loan from a bank, and even mortgaged his own home {{to help pay for}} the ballpark. Country music star Conway <b>Twitty</b> helped Schmittou bring in fellow stars Jerry Reed, Richard Sterban, and Cal Smith as well as other members of the Nashville community as team shareholders. The stadium was posthumously named for Herschel Lynn Greer, a prominent Nashville businessman and the first president of the Nashville Vols baseball team, whose family donated $25,000 for stadium construction.|$|E
5|$|The {{search and}} rescue efforts for Holloway began immediately. Hundreds of volunteers from Aruba and the United States joined in the effort. During {{the first days of}} the search, the Aruban {{government}} gave thousands of civil servants the day off to participate in the rescue effort. Fifty Dutch marines conducted an extensive search of the shoreline. Aruban banks raised $20,000 and provided other support to aid volunteer search teams. Beth <b>Twitty</b> was provided with housing, initially at the Holiday Inn where she coincidentally stayed in the same room her daughter had occupied. She subsequently stayed at the nearby Wyndham Hotel's presidential suite.|$|E
5000|$|... "You've Never Been This Far Before" [...] was <b>Twitty's</b> only {{song from}} the country chart to cross over onto the Top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100, where the single peaked at number 22.|$|R
5000|$|Around {{the churchyard}} are {{three sets of}} almshouses: Long Alley Almshouses built in 1446, <b>Twitty's</b> Almshouses of 1707 and Brick Alley Almshouses of 1718. The {{architectural}} historian Nikolaus Pevsner declared [...] "No other churchyard anywhere has anything like it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "An {{idea came}} {{suddenly}} into Sam <b>Twitty's</b> head: {{this was a}} very bright girl, a very attractive girl, who was visiting in the neighborhood, and he determined to keep her at the toll-gate a few minutes if he could.|$|R
5|$|While Holloway's family {{initially}} discouraged {{a travel}} boycott of Aruba, this changed by September 2005. <b>Twitty</b> urged that persons not travel to Aruba and other Dutch territories {{because of what}} she stated were tourist safety issues. In a November 8, 2005, news conference, Governor Bob Riley and the Holloways urged Alabamians and others to boycott Aruba. Riley also wrote to other United States governors seeking their support—the governors of Georgia and Arkansas eventually joined in the call for boycott. Philadelphia's city council voted to ask the Pennsylvania Governor of Pennsylvania Ed Rendell {{to call for a}} boycott. Rendell did not do so, and no federal support was given.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} Holloway's missed flight, Jug and Beth <b>Twitty</b> {{and friends}} flew to Aruba by private jet. Within {{four hours of}} landing on the island, the Twittys presented the Aruban police with {{the name and address}} of Van der Sloot as the person with whom Holloway left the nightclub. Beth stated that Van der Sloot's full name was given to her by the night manager at the Holiday Inn, who supposedly recognized him on a videotape. The Twittys and their friends went to the Van der Sloot home with two Aruban policemen to look for Holloway. Van der Sloot initially denied knowing Holloway's name, but he then told the following story, which was corrorborated by Deepak Kalpoe, who was present in the house: Van der Sloot related that they drove Holloway to the California Lighthouse area of Arashi Beach because she wanted to see sharks; they later dropped Holloway off at her hotel at around 2:00a.m. According to Van der Sloot, Holloway fell down as she exited the car but refused his help. He stated that as he and Kalpoe were driving away, Holloway was approached by a dark man in a black shirt similar to those worn by security guards.|$|E
5|$|Schmittou {{learned from}} {{a member of the}} Metro Board of Parks and Recreation that neither the Park Board or the city of Nashville {{would be willing to pay}} for such a park. So, Schmittou, along with help from country music star Conway <b>Twitty,</b> put {{together}} a group of investors including other country stars Cal Smith, Larry Gatlin, Jerry Reed, and Richard Sterban (bass singer of the Oak Ridge Boys), as well as other Nashvillians, in order to finance a stadium and a minor league team. Twenty shares valued at US$15,000 each were issued, with Schmittou purchasing 2shares, or 10percent of the team. The Metro Parks Board agreed to lease to Schmittou the site of Nashville's former softball fields on the grounds of Fort Negley, an American Civil War fortification, approximately two miles (3km) south of downtown, for a period of 20years as long he built a stadium with a minimum capacity of 6,500 at a cost of at least $400,000 within 10years. In the second ten years, he would be required to pay the city seven percent of the team's total revenue.|$|E
50|$|Wariner co-wrote {{the song}} {{when he was}} 23 years old. The {{rendition}} from Two Teardrops includes a backing vocal from his brother, Terry, who has also sung backing vocals in Wariner's road band. The song was featured on Conway <b>Twitty's</b> 1981 album Mr. T.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was about}} a {{fortnight}} after Sam <b>Twitty's</b> wedding that that well-satisfied individual, being called to the gate {{by the sound of}} wheels, beheld a buggy, and Miss Denby sitting therein. In answer to Sam's cheerful greeting, she did not laugh, nor even smile.|$|R
5000|$|For {{the first}} single from her third album, God Created Woman, Cochran spliced in Conway <b>Twitty's</b> vocals from earlier songs of his to form a duet {{entitled}} [...] "(I Wanna Hear) A Cheatin' Song". This song peaked at No. 57, although the album was never released and its title track failed to chart.|$|R
25|$|Accounts vary of how Jenkins {{acquired}} the stage name of Conway <b>Twitty.</b> Allegedly, in 1957, Jenkins decided that {{his real name}} was not memorable enough and sought a better show business name. In The Billboard Book of Number One Hits Fred Bronson states that the singer {{was looking at a}} road map when he spotted Conway, Arkansas, and <b>Twitty,</b> Texas, and chose the name Conway <b>Twitty.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Twitty</b> {{also played}} baseball, his second passion. He {{received}} {{an offer to}} play with the Philadelphia Phillies after high school, but he was drafted into the United States Army before he could sign the contract. <b>Twitty</b> joined the entrepreneur Larry Schmittou and other country music stars, such as Cal Smith, Jerry Reed, Larry Gatlin, and Richard Sterban, in 1977 as investors in the Nashville Sounds, a minor league baseball team of the Double-A Southern League, which began playing in 1978. <b>Twitty</b> threw out the ceremonial first pitch at the team's inaugural home opener, at Herschel Greer Stadium, on April 26, 1978. <b>Twitty</b> would also host celebrity softball games for charity, frequently playing against a team put together by Barbara Mandrell.|$|E
25|$|In 1981, <b>Twitty</b> was exiting {{his tour}} bus when he {{slipped on the}} steps and fell, hitting {{his head against the}} steps. John Hughey, who was Twitty's steel guitar player, found him on the ground. Many people, {{including}} family members, said that <b>Twitty</b> underwent a change in personality after the accident. According to his daughter Joni, <b>Twitty</b> was not in a right state of mind for several months, saying {{in an interview that he}} had picked up a TV remote and began talking into it, thinking it was a phone.|$|E
5000|$|His {{second album}} for Audium/Koch, That's Why I Sing This Way, was mostly a cover album {{save for the}} title track. Both [...] "That's Why I Sing This Way" [...] and a cover of Conway <b>Twitty's</b> [...] "I'd Love to Lay You Down" [...] were {{released}} from this album, respectively reaching No. 47 and No. 43.|$|R
6000|$|... "In {{about ten}} minutes Sam <b>Twitty's</b> port eye told him that Captain Abner and the toll-gate woman were approaching, but in Abner {{there were signs of}} a {{disposition}} to fall back. In an instant he had bounded between them and was showing shells to the widow. Then, letting her go on by herself, he turned sharply upon Abner.|$|R
50|$|Up until 1959 CJOB {{broadcast}} the current hit parade music including rock and roll, but generally avoiding negro recordings like the Coasters and Platters. After 1959 the station changed its format to pop music only, {{in a negative}} reaction to R&R songs like Conway <b>Twitty's</b> Danny Boy. This music format continued until it changed to all talk in the 1980s.|$|R
25|$|<b>Twitty</b> {{lived for}} many years in Hendersonville, Tennessee, just north of Nashville, where he built a country music {{entertainment}} complex called <b>Twitty</b> City at a cost of over $3.5 million. <b>Twitty</b> and <b>Twitty</b> City were once featured on the TV series Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous. and was also seen in the Nashville episode of the BBC series Entertainment USA, presented by Jonathan King. Opened in 1982, it was a popular tourist stop throughout the 1980s and into the early 1990s; it was shut down in 1994 following a year-long tribute show called Final Touches, when fans and peers in the music business dropped by. The complex was auctioned off and bought by the Trinity Broadcasting Network the #1 Faith-based network in the world; now known as Trinity Music City, USA, but is no longer open to the public.|$|E
25|$|Tucker {{retired in}} July 2016, and was succeeded at First Army by Stephen M. <b>Twitty.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Twitty</b> {{said that}} she vowed to share her story shortly {{following}} her daughter's disappearance, {{in the hope that}} other families would not suffer what she had to go through. After searchers had spent five months in an unsuccessful quest to find Natalee, her attorney John Q. Kelly took over the case and she spent the next two years traveling to various high schools and colleges to present messages about personal safety. When she thought about reaching more travelers with her story, <b>Twitty</b> said that her efforts evolved into writing a book.|$|E
5000|$|... "Don't Cry Joni" [...] is <b>Twitty's</b> {{duet with}} his then 16-year-old daughter, Joni Lee Jenkins. According to country music writer Tom Roland, Joni Lee had wanted — {{after years of}} {{resistance}} — to become an entertainer, and her father decided that allowing her to duet {{with him on the}} song (which he had written years earlier) might provide some encouragement.|$|R
