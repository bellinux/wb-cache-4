25|$|Ericson {{was removed}} from the Public Works' bridge {{division}} and control over bridge design was passed to a separate administrative entity headed by Thomas G. Pihlfeldt. However, under Pihlfeldt's guidance the city continued to express preference for <b>the</b> <b>trunnion</b> bascule design.|$|E
25|$|By 1904, {{the city}} had {{obtained}} permission to issue bonds to replace {{the rest of the}} swing bridges on the Chicago River. Ericson sent the Scherzer Company and the Sanitary District specifications for the bridge in 1905. A design by John W. Page, the inventor of a bascule bridge over the Sanitary and Ship Canal, was rejected in March 1905 due to noncompliance to specifications. The Scherzer Company waited until the bidding deadline to submit two separate designs; both of these were also rejected due to noncompliance. Two contracts were bid out for <b>the</b> <b>trunnion</b> style bascule bridge that Ericson had pioneered; one contract for $81,369 (1905) went to the Jackson and Corbett Company for the substructure, and one for $111,983 (1905) went to the Roemheld and Gallery Company for superstructure work.|$|E
500|$|The {{bridge is}} {{designed}} to carry two railroad tracks across the river. Its superstructure consists of two spans constructed by the Strauss Bascule & Concrete Bridge Company: a [...] plate-girder span {{on the west bank}} of the river and the [...] movable main span that rests on the east trunnion pier. The size and weight of the main span, which, when completed would be world's longest and heaviest bascule span, required <b>the</b> <b>trunnion</b> pier to be constructed on foundations that extend to the bedrock [...] below the river bed. To achieve this caissons were sunk to a depth of [...] below the river bed and then [...] diameter wells were sunk the remaining [...] The substructure of the bridge was constructed by the Great Lakes Dredge and Dock Company.|$|E

The width of <b>the</b> <b>trunnion</b> is approximately [...] The diameter of the cascabel is approximately [...] The length of the cannon itself is approximately [...] Upon retrieval from the ocean, the cannon was encrusted with coral and the salt water had caused rusting and deterioration.|$|E
2500|$|At the Kennedy Space Center, Dr. Soto reviews, designs, builds, {{tests and}} {{implements}} engineering designs {{used in the}} Space Shuttle and Payload Operations Development Laboratories. [...] The main project he developed was the Advanced Payload Transfer Measurement System (ASPTMS)(Electronic 3D measuring system), which consists of a simplified, robust, centrally operated and portable system that automatically measures the spherical coordinates offset between <b>the</b> <b>trunnion</b> and their supports during transfer operations. This system {{has the potential to}} become a NASA project with commercial applications. Dr. Soto earned his Doctorate of Philosophy Degree in Electrical Engineering and has applied to become an astronaut candidate.|$|E
2500|$|The 10-inch gun was a {{standard}} [...] "Woolwich" [...] design (characterised {{by having a}} steel A tube with relatively few broad, rounded and shallow rifling grooves) developed in 1868, based on the successful Mk III 9-inch gun, itself based on the [...] "Fraser" [...] system. The Fraser system was an economy measure applied to the successful Armstrong design for heavy muzzle-loaders, which were expensive to produce. It retained the Armstrong steel barrel surrounded by wrought-iron coils under tension, but replaced the multiple thin wrought-iron coils shrunk around it by a single larger coil (10inch Mark I) or 2 coils (Mark II); <b>the</b> <b>trunnion</b> ring was now welded to other coils; and it eliminated Armstrong's expensive forged breech-piece.|$|E
50|$|After cooling the gun the {{machining}} process began. The bore was bored out to proper size, the exterior was turned smooth, <b>the</b> <b>trunnions</b> were {{turned on a}} trunnion lathe, and a vent was drilled.|$|R
25|$|An {{oscillating}} {{engine was}} {{a type of}} direct-acting engine {{that was designed to}} achieve further reductions in engine size and weight. Oscillating engines had the piston rods connected directly to the crankshaft, dispensing with the need for connecting rods. In order to achieve this aim, the engine cylinders were not immobile as in most engines, but secured in <b>the</b> middle by <b>trunnions</b> which allowed <b>the</b> cylinders themselves to pivot back and forth as the crankshaft rotated, hence the term oscillating. Steam was supplied and exhausted through <b>the</b> <b>trunnions.</b> <b>The</b> oscillating motion of the cylinder was usually used to line up ports in <b>the</b> <b>trunnions</b> to direct <b>the</b> steam feed and exhaust to the cylinder at the correct times. However, separate valves may be provided, controlled by the oscillating motion. This allows the timing to be varied to enable expansive working. (As, for example, the engine in the paddle ship PD Krippen.) This compromises the advantage of simplicity but still retains the advantage of compactness.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>trunnions</b> {{are located}} at the {{foremost}} end of the reinforce just behind the reinforce ring. They consist of two cylinders perpendicular to the bore and below it which are used to mount the cannon on its carriage.|$|R
50|$|In {{mechanical}} engineering (see <b>the</b> <b>trunnion</b> bearing section below), {{it is one}} part of a rotating joint where a shaft (<b>the</b> <b>trunnion)</b> is inserted into (and turns inside) a full or partial cylinder.|$|E
50|$|In {{mechanical}} engineering, it is {{one part}} of a rotating joint where a shaft (<b>the</b> <b>trunnion)</b> is inserted into (and turns inside) a full or partial cylinder. Often used in opposing pairs, this joint allows tight tolerances and strength from a large surface contact area between <b>the</b> <b>trunnion</b> and the cylinder.|$|E

50|$|The D-20 has a 34 calibre (5.195 m) barrel, with {{a double}} baffle muzzle brake and a {{semi-automatic}} vertical sliding block breech, with a tied jaw and the block moving down to open. The barrel is mounted in a long ring cradle with <b>the</b> <b>trunnions</b> just forward of the breech. The recoil system (buffer and recuperator) is mounted on the cradle above the barrel. Compression balancing gear is attached behind the saddle support, passing through the complex shaped saddle to connect to the cradle just forward of <b>the</b> <b>trunnions.</b> This can be manually re-pressured by a pump below the breech. The breech has a projectile retaining catch to prevent the shell sliding out at higher elevations before it is rammed with a manual rammer.|$|R
60|$|To {{all of this}} our own {{poor little}} gun endeavoured to reply, and the sailors, though exposed in an open truck, succeeded in letting off three rounds before the barrel {{was struck by a}} shell, and <b>the</b> <b>trunnions,</b> being smashed, fell {{altogether}} out of the carriage.|$|R
40|$|A {{subcritical}} {{liquid hydrogen}} orbital storage and transfer experiment {{was designed for}} flight in the Shuttle cargo bay. The Cryogenic Fluid Management Experiment (CFME) includes a liquid hydrogen tank supported in a vacuum jacket by two fiberglass epoxy trunnion mounts. This composite material was selected for <b>the</b> <b>trunnions</b> since it provides desirable strength, weight and thermal characteristics for supporting cryogenic tankage. An experimental program was conducted to provide material property and fatigue data for S-glass epoxy composite materials at ambient and liquid hydrogen temperatures and to verify structural integrity of <b>the</b> CFME <b>trunnion</b> supports...|$|R
50|$|The 38 and 38B were {{water-cooled}} with {{a barrel}} jacket threaded inside <b>the</b> <b>trunnion,</b> unlike the M1917 and Colt Model 1928.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} Type 38 gun had a conical interrupted-thread breech, {{a single}} box type trail which limited gun elevation to only 16°30'. Also, {{there were no}} equilibrators as <b>the</b> <b>trunnions</b> were at <b>the</b> gun barrel's center of balance. All of these shortcomings were remedied with a redesign following World War I.|$|R
50|$|The {{guns were}} rifled breech-loading weapons with a cast iron body, hooped with wrought iron, {{and with a}} steel tube screwed in place that {{contained}} the breechblock and extended just forward of <b>the</b> <b>trunnions.</b> <b>The</b> Ordóñez guns captured at Havana were all 35 to 36 calibers in length.) The breechblocks were lever-actuated, and of the French or interrupted screw type, though the obturating ring followed the Krupp design. The guns {{appear to have been}} mounted en barbette, rather than on a disappearing carriage.|$|R
50|$|Gun {{carriages}} {{were introduced}} in the 15th century. Two large-diameter wheels, axle-tree and a trail became the standard pattern for field use. The barrel was mounted in a wooden cradle with trunnions to mount it on the carriage. As technology improved, <b>the</b> <b>trunnions</b> {{became part of the}} barrel and the cradle was abandoned. Nevertheless, they were relatively large and heavy.|$|R

5000|$|In {{surveying}} {{total stations}} and theodolites, <b>the</b> <b>trunnion</b> axis is the axis about which the telescope transits. It {{is parallel to}} the horizontal axis defined by the tubular spirit bubble.|$|E
5000|$|In a cannon, <b>the</b> <b>trunnions</b> are two {{projections}} cast just {{forward of}} the center of mass of the cannon and fixed to a two-wheeled movable gun carriage. [...] As they allowed the muzzle to be raised and lowered easily, the integral casting of trunnions is seen by military historians {{as one of the most}} important advances in early field artillery.|$|R
50|$|The Confederates did {{solid cast}} 8-inch and 10-inch columbiads that {{resemble}} Rodman guns. A closer examination of these Confederate columbiads reveals {{that they have}} a straighter cylindrical contour between <b>the</b> <b>trunnions</b> and <b>the</b> breech as opposed to the sweeping continuous curve of the Rodman gun. The Confederate columbiads have longer trunnions that were intended for use with heavy wooden carriages. The Union gun were designed to be mounted in iron carriages with thinner cheeks, permitting shorter <b>trunnions.</b> <b>The</b> exteriors of the Confederate columbiads are rough, not having been finished on a lathe as were their Union counterparts.|$|R
50|$|The Mark 3 was <b>trunnioned</b> as <b>the</b> Mark 1 and Mark 2, but {{was built}} in three {{different}} caliber lengths, 30, 35, and 40, in eight different Mods, Mod 0 - Mod 6 and Mod's 8 and 9. Mod 0 was 30 caliber with Mod 1 being 35 caliber. All 30 and 35 caliber Mods had a liner, 10 hoops, and a jacket. Mod 2 was 40 caliber with only eight hoops. Mod 3 was again 30 caliber but introduced the use of case (semi-fixed) ammunition. The Mod 4 was experimental in that it eliminated <b>the</b> <b>trunnions</b> and used a threaded sleeve. Mod 5s were reworked Mod 1s making them capable of handling case ammunition. As with the Mod 5 the Mod 6 were Mod 2s reworked to handle case ammunition. The Mod 7 was skipped and no drawings exist for this Mod. The Mod 8 was another Mod 2 rework, this time removing <b>the</b> <b>trunnions</b> and using a threaded sleeve. The last Mod was the Mod 9, using a Mod 3 gun and giving it a full length liner.|$|R
50|$|In aviation, {{the term}} {{refers to the}} {{structural}} component that attaches the undercarriage or landing gear to the airframe. For aircraft equipped with retractable landing gear, <b>the</b> <b>trunnion</b> is pivoted to permit rotation of the entire gear assembly.|$|E

5000|$|In older cars, <b>the</b> <b>trunnion</b> {{is part of}} the {{suspension}} and either allows free movement of the rear wheel hub in relation to the chassis or allows the front wheel hub to rotate with the steering. On many cars (such as those made by the Triumph) <b>the</b> <b>trunnion</b> is machined from a brass or bronze casting and is prone to failure if not greased properly. American Motors recommended lubrication of its pre-packed front suspension trunnions using a sodium base grease every 32000 mi or three years. It later incorporated molded rubber [...] "Clevebloc" [...] bushings on the upper trunnion to seal out dirt and retain silicone lubricant {{for the life of the}} car.|$|E
50|$|After {{a running}} fight, which lasted {{up to an}} hour and a half, and in heavy seas which {{prevented}} the Canada from opening her lower deck ports, the frigate surrendered. She had suffered heavy casualties, with 80 men killed and 106 wounded (nearly half her complement), including her captain, Don Francisco de Wenthuisen, who lost an arm. The Canada had one of <b>the</b> <b>trunnions</b> of a lower deck gun shot off and suffered ten casualties.|$|R
50|$|The {{custom-designed}} 35-calibres Mk XIII gun had {{a heavier}} breech which allowed <b>the</b> <b>trunnions</b> {{to be closer}} to the breech and hence the breech did not depress as far when the barrel was elevated. On a new Mk IV mounting, Mk XIII guns could then be elevated to 40° and attain a range of 22,600 yards. These remained in service until 1945, serving in the home defence of Britain in World War II.|$|R
50|$|To {{prepare the}} gun for {{transport}} a large tripod was placed over it and, using a block and tackle, the barrel lifted off <b>the</b> front <b>trunnion</b> cups {{and moved to}} <b>the</b> back <b>trunnion</b> cups. <b>The</b> trail was then placed on a limber. 16 to 20 oxen were required to pull the gun over hard soil. Two wagons were required to transport the platform and the ammunition was transported on another two wagons.|$|R
