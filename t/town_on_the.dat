5|$|According to {{contemporary}} Frankish scholar and courtier Einhard, Eric was killed at Trsat (Tarsatch), a <b>town</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> coast of Liburnia by the treachery of the inhabitants. Due {{to a lack}} of primary materials, it is uncertain who killed Duke Eric. Most of historians point at Croats, while some point at Byzantines. Einhard also notes the death of Gerold, Prefect of Bavaria, another Frankish commander who was slain in Pannonia in the same year. Croatian historian Nenad Labus refers to this event as a successful assassination attempt by Avars and Slavs. Historian Pierre Riché believes that Dalmatian Croats (Guduscani) killed Eric in collusion with Avars.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} that the Normans conquered England in 1066, the town of Southampton {{occupied}} a rectangular area overlooking the mouth of the River Test, an important medieval waterway. It was protected by water on most sides and by protective ditches and banks to the north and east. Southampton at this time was a relatively large town, but not as significant as in the later medieval period. The Normans built a castle within the <b>town</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> site of a probable large English hall, and considerable damage was caused to the surrounding local buildings as space was opened up for the new fortification.|$|E

5|$|Edward invaded {{with a huge}} army, pushing {{north from}} Carmarthen and westwards from Montgomery and Chester. Edward {{captured}} Aberconwy in March 1283 and decided that the location would form the centre of a new county: he would relocate the abbey eight miles up the Conwy valley to a new site at Maenan, establishing Maenan Abbey, and build a new English castle and walled <b>town</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> monastery's former site. The ruined castle of Deganwy was abandoned and never rebuilt. Edward's plan was a colonial enterprise and placing the new town and walls on top of such a high-status native Welsh site was in part a symbolic act to demonstrate English power.|$|E

5|$|In April 1321 the French Dominican friar Jordanus Catalani of Severac (in {{south-western}} France) {{landed at}} Thana {{with four other}} friars.

Being the first bishop of India and the Quilon Diocese, he was entrusted the spiritual nourishment of Christian community in Mangalore {{and other parts of}} India by Pope John XXII. According to historian Severine Silva, no concrete evidence has yet been found that there were any permanent settlements of Christians in South Canara before the 16th century. It was only after the advent of the Portuguese in the region that Christianity began to spread.|$|E
