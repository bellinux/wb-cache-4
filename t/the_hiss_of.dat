500|$|NME {{ranked the}} album number 411 {{on their list}} of the 500 {{greatest}} albums of all time, describing it as [...] "stoner humour and mind-bending beats from a hip-hop dream team" [...] and stating that [...] "MF DOOM and Madlib might not have invented underground rap, but they damn well perfected it". Pitchfork ranked the album at number 13 in their list of the top 100 albums of 2000–2004, commenting, [...] "While Madlib's special power played tricks on your ears – a sample you were sure {{was the sound of}} cars rolling by on the street might sound like <b>the</b> <b>hiss</b> <b>of</b> a record on a different day ("Rainbows") – MF Doom unfurled his clever lyrics like a roll of sod on earth... and the album curved in on itself like a two-way mirror."Pitchfork also ranked Madvillainy as the 25th best album of the 2000s, describing it as [...] "a preternaturally perfect pairing of like-minded talents" [...] who [...] "have each been responsible for tons of great, grimy underground hip-hop". Tiny Mix Tapes considered the album the fourth best of the 2000s. Rhapsody named the ranked the album 1st on its [...] "Hip-Hop's Best Albums of the Decade" [...] list. PopMatters positioned it at number 49 on their list of the 100 best albums of the 2000s and praised MF DOOM, who [...] "free-associates culture high and low, from Hemingway to Robh Ruppel, across tongue-tied internal rhymes", and Madlib's [...] "fusion breaks, psych soul, and Steve Reich", and called the album [...] "the best chemistry of either’s career, {{and one of the best}} of hip-hop, period". In 2016 Q listed Madvillainy among the albums that didn't appear in their list of the best albums of last 30 years, stating that [...] "underground hip-hop's cracked geniuses, Madlib and MF DOOM, unite on a labyrinth of weed-stained vignettes that combine invention and accessibility".

2500|$|The [...] "shanty-man"—the chorister {{of the old}} packet ship—has left no successors. In {{the place}} of a rousing [...] "pulling song," [...] we now hear the rattle of the steam-winch; and the modern {{windlass}} worked by steam, or the modern steam-pump, gives us the clatter of cogwheels and <b>the</b> <b>hiss</b> <b>of</b> steam in place of the wild choruses of other days. Singing and steam are irreconcilable. The hoarse steam-whistle is the nearest approach to music that can exist in the hot, greasy atmosphere of the steam-engine.|$|E
2500|$|Just after midnight, German small-arms fire began {{along the}} fronts of the 73rd and 72nd brigades, in the centre and {{left of the}} 24th Division and the 76th Brigade on the right flank of the 3rd Division. Soon after, a gas {{discharge}} began on a [...] from La Petite Douve Farm to Spanbroekmolen. (In German reports of the operation, the gas was said to rise above head-height and was illuminated by British flares. British return-fire began and after five minutes, artillery-fire commenced.) Along most of the line, German rifle and machine-gun fire blanketed <b>the</b> <b>hiss</b> <b>of</b> gas and smothered the sound of alarm gongs and klaxons. The first warning for many British soldiers was the smell, since with the wind speed and no man's land being only [...] wide in places, the gas arrived without warning. The British donned their helmets and a volley of Very lights revealed the gas cloud. German artillery began a bombardment behind the British front, on artillery positions, observation posts, support trenches and strong points. The gas signal reached the divisional HQs at [...] and three minutes later, the artillery of the 24th and 50th divisions, behind Hill 63 and the Vierstraat spur and the corps heavy artillery, began to bombard their night lines.|$|E

50|$|The L.A. Express was an American jazz-pop ensemble. Members of L.A. Express {{played on}} several Joni Mitchell albums, namely Court and Spark, <b>The</b> <b>Hissing</b> <b>of</b> Summer Lawns and the live album Miles of Aisles between 1974 and 1975.|$|R
60|$|And as Orpheus sang, they dashed their oars {{into the}} sea, and kept time to his music, as they fled fast away; and the Sirens’ voices died behind them, in <b>the</b> <b>hissing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> foam along their wake.|$|R
60|$|That was {{the last}} I heard of Hans, for if he said any more, <b>the</b> <b>hiss</b> <b>of</b> the torrential rain smothered his words.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now we are dead!" [...] shrieked {{the poor}} dolls, {{clinging}} together as {{they heard the}} splash of water, the shouting of men, the splintering of wood, and <b>the</b> <b>hiss</b> <b>of</b> steam.|$|E
6000|$|She {{uttered the}} words like <b>the</b> <b>hiss</b> <b>of</b> a serpent. Savello's eyes sparkled a little, and his thin lips were drawn rather thinner than before, {{but he only}} sighed, and said gently,-- ...|$|E
5000|$|The song is {{incorporated}} into a medley, with her own song [...] "Harry's House", by Joni Mitchell, on her 1975 album <b>The</b> <b>Hissing</b> <b>of</b> Summer Lawns. Jazz singer Roseanna Vitro recorded the song on her 1984 debut LP, Listen Here.|$|R
5000|$|The opening lines [...] "I {{was walking}} in the park dreaming of a spark, when I heard the {{sprinklers}} whisper, shimmer in the haze of summer lawns" [...] deliberately recall the title track <b>of</b> Mitchell's album <b>The</b> <b>Hissing</b> <b>of</b> Summer Lawns.|$|R
50|$|Beginning in 1975, {{he worked}} at Blue Note Records with Bobby Hutcherson, Carmen McRae and Horace Silver. Oehler's Warner Bros. Records work {{included}} Al Jarreau, Randy Crawford and Jennifer Holliday. He also worked on Joni Mitchell's <b>The</b> <b>Hissing</b> <b>of</b> Summer Lawns (Elektra/Asylum).|$|R
60|$|Here I thought I heard a faint {{sound in}} the air like <b>the</b> <b>hiss</b> <b>of</b> a snake, but as it was not {{repeated}} and I could see nothing, concluded that I was mistaken.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, {{not quite}} that," [...] said he, [...] "but <b>the</b> <b>hiss</b> <b>of</b> the waves {{is apt to}} dull the hearin' a bit, an' one don't {{naturally}} look for enemies from land'ard, d'ye see?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Captain, {{the turret}} fills with steam, The feed-pipes burst below-- You can hear <b>the</b> <b>hiss</b> <b>of</b> the {{helpless}} ram, You {{can hear the}} twisted runners jam." [...] And he answered, [...] "Turn and go!" ...|$|E
60|$|As {{he charged}} again he uttered a {{peculiar}} whistling noise from between his set teeth. To the American {{it sounded like}} <b>the</b> <b>hissing</b> <b>of</b> a snake, and {{as he would have}} met a snake he met the venomous attack of the old man.|$|R
5000|$|Electromagnetically-excited {{acoustic}} noise describe audible sound directly produced by materials vibrating under the excitation of electromagnetic forces. Some examples of electromagnetically-excited {{acoustic noise}} include {{the hum of}} transformers or the whine of some rotating electric machines. <b>The</b> <b>hissing</b> <b>of</b> high voltage transmission lines is due to corona discharge, not magnetism.|$|R
5000|$|In November that year, Joni Mitchell {{released}} her LP <b>The</b> <b>Hissing</b> <b>of</b> Summer Lawns, featuring the track [...] "The Jungle Line", which mixed traditional African drumming and synthesiser. For this recording, Mitchell {{was accompanied by}} the musical group The Warrior Drums of Burundi, who were visiting America at the time.|$|R
6000|$|O the engineer's joys! {{to go with}} a locomotive! [...] To hear <b>the</b> <b>hiss</b> <b>of</b> steam, {{the merry}} shriek, the steam-whistle, the [...] {{laughing}} locomotive! [...] To push with resistless way and speed off in the distance.|$|E
6000|$|... "Captain, {{the turret}} fills with steam, [...] The feed-pipes burst below-- [...] You can hear <b>the</b> <b>hiss</b> <b>of</b> the {{helpless}} ram, [...] You {{can hear the}} twisted runners jam." [...] And he answered, [...] "Turn and go!" ...|$|E
60|$|Entering one of {{the largest}} huts, {{preparations}} for supper were promptly begun. The Esquimaux happened to be well supplied with walrus flesh, so the lamps were replenished, and <b>the</b> <b>hiss</b> <b>of</b> the frying steaks and dropping fat speedily rose above all other sounds.|$|E
60|$|The moments {{passed in}} silence, save for <b>the</b> <b>hissing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rain-drops as they {{mingled with the}} water of the river, and I was saying to myself that of a verity we must have drifted safely through the fleet without {{touching}} a ship, when that came which I had been fearing.|$|R
50|$|In Zambia, one baobab {{is said to}} be {{haunted by}} a ghostly python. A long time ago, the python lived in the hollow trunk and was worshipped by the natives. A white hunter shot him down, and led to bad consequences. Some nights, the natives still hear <b>the</b> <b>hissing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> snake.|$|R
6000|$|<b>The</b> <b>hissing</b> <b>of</b> geese, <b>the</b> languishing cooing of doves, the braying of donkeys, {{the chatter}} of irresponsible sparrows--these {{were in my}} mind's ear as I read. [...] "Suffering Sappho!" [...] I exclaimed to myself. [...] "Is this the divine fire that is {{supposed}} to ignite genius and make it practical and wage-earning?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thou dog!" [...] she said, in her terrible whisper, which {{sounded like}} <b>the</b> <b>hiss</b> <b>of</b> a snake, [...] "why didst thou hide this from me?" [...] And she {{stretched}} out her arm, and I {{thought that she}} was about to slay me.|$|E
60|$|Amid the oozing fatness {{and warm}} ferments of the Froom Vale, at a season when {{the rush of}} juices could almost be heard below <b>the</b> <b>hiss</b> <b>of</b> fertilization, it was {{impossible}} that the most fanciful love should not grow passionate. The ready bosoms existing there were impregnated by their surroundings.|$|E
60|$|The spectacle, as {{the fire}} swept away before the wind, was fine in the extreme. The party seemed {{enclosed}} between two walls of fire. The main conflagration was now fearfully close, burning flakes were already falling amongst them, {{and the sound of}} the fire was like <b>the</b> <b>hiss</b> <b>of</b> the surf upon a pebbly beach.|$|E
6000|$|ERNEST (continuing, well pleased).--'By {{night the}} cries of wild cats and <b>the</b> <b>hissing</b> <b>of</b> snakes terrify us extremely'--(this does not satisfy him so well, and he makes a correction)--'terrify the ladies extremely. Against these we have no weapons except one cutlass and a hatchet. A bucket washed ashore is at present our only {{comfortable}} seat'-- ...|$|R
60|$|It was {{a room of}} silence, {{save for}} <b>the</b> <b>hissing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> green logs that burned on the open hearth, and for the slow {{movements}} of Jennings as he cleared the table. Straight and grim in his chair, with the newspaper by his side, Stephen Strangewey sat smoking stolidly. Opposite to him, almost as grim, equally silent, sat John.|$|R
6000|$|... 'They go down, {{far down}} there!' he {{abruptly}} exclaimed, pointing {{into the black}} depths of the vault, 'and never arise again to {{the light of the}} upper earth! The great Destroyer is watchful in his solitude beneath, and looks through the darkness for their approach! Hark! <b>the</b> <b>hissing</b> <b>of</b> his breath is like to the clash of weapons in a deadly strife!' ...|$|R
60|$|Thirty {{miles an}} hour into a fog of mist, with the spray falling like a {{fountain}} and <b>the</b> <b>hiss</b> <b>of</b> the seawater like devil's music in their ears. Then the haze lifted like the curtain before the stage of a theatre, and rolled away into the dim distance. An officer stood by Conyers' side.|$|E
60|$|The clanging of {{the engines}} and the noise of {{shouting}} gave her a sinking sensation in the chest, and she clung to Anson's arm as they drove past the engine. She was deafened by <b>the</b> <b>hiss</b> <b>of</b> the escaping steam of the monster standing motionless, headed toward the east, ready to leap on its sounding way.|$|E
60|$|As before related, Paula and Somerset {{came and}} stood within the door. When the rain {{increased}} they drew themselves further inward, their forms being distinctly outlined to {{the gaze of}} those lurking behind by {{the light from the}} tent beyond. But <b>the</b> <b>hiss</b> <b>of</b> the falling rain and the lowness of their tones prevented their words from being heard.|$|E
6000|$|Ah! {{the wave}} has fallen on the beach. Listen to its roaring--listen to the roaring of the shields! Stand, you {{men of the}} Halakazi--stand! Surely they are but a few. So! it is done! By the head of Chaka! they break--they are pushed back--now the wave of {{slaughter}} seethes along the sands--now the foe is swept like floating weed, and from all the line there comes a <b>hissing</b> like <b>the</b> <b>hissing</b> <b>of</b> thin waters. [...] "S'gee!" [...] says <b>the</b> <b>hiss.</b> [...] "S'gee! S'gee!" ...|$|R
25|$|During 1975, Mitchell {{also participated}} in several concerts in the Rolling Thunder Revue tours {{featuring}} Bob Dylan and Joan Baez, and in 1976 she performed as part of The Last Waltz by the Band. In January 1976, Mitchell received a nomination for the Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for <b>the</b> album <b>The</b> <b>Hissing</b> <b>of</b> Summer Lawns, though the Grammy went to Linda Ronstadt.|$|R
60|$|At {{the sight}} of the omen a roar went up that rolled to right and left of us, a roar from thirty {{thousand}} throats. Now it was lost in a sound like to <b>the</b> <b>hissing</b> <b>of</b> thunder rain in Ethiopia, the sound of thirty thousand arrows rushing through the wind. Oh! they were well aimed, those arrows for I had not taught the Ethiopians archery in vain.|$|R
