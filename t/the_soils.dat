5|$|<b>The</b> <b>soils</b> in the {{watershed}} of West Branch Fishing Creek are acidic {{because of a}} lack of limestone.|$|E
5|$|There are few farms {{surrounding}} the flat route, as <b>the</b> <b>soils</b> {{in the region}} are very thin and underlain by a limestone bedrock.|$|E
5|$|Topsoils {{are thin}} and poor because the glaciers had abraded {{down to the}} bedrock. <b>The</b> <b>soils</b> are clayey silt.|$|E

5|$|Chadderton's modern {{commercial}} centre lies {{close to}} the boundary with Oldham; the expansion of Oldham in the mid-19th century caused urbanisation along the eastern boundary of Chadderton, which spread outwards {{into the rest of}} the township. Continued growth in the late-19th and early-20th centuries gave rise to a densely populated, industrial landscape of factories and rows of terraced housing, typical of mill towns in Northern England. There is a mixture of high-density urban areas, suburbs and semi-rural locations in Chadderton, but overwhelmingly the land use in the town is urban. <b>The</b> <b>soils</b> of Chadderton are sand based, with subsoils of clay and gravel.|$|E
5|$|Erythranthe species tend to {{concentrate}} sodium chloride and other salts absorbed from <b>the</b> <b>soils</b> {{in which they}} grow in their leaves and stem tissues. Native Americans and early travelers in the American West used this plant as a salt substitute to season wild game. The entire plant is edible, but reported to be very salty and bitter unless well cooked. The juice from the leaves {{was used as a}} poultice for mild skin irritations and burns. Leaves can be used in salads and soups; flowers taste best before blooming. E. lutea has been used for cooking in Peru.|$|E

5|$|In 1914 <b>the</b> <b>soils</b> of the Fishing Creek {{watershed}} {{were found}} to yield large quantities of farm crops. Potatoes yielded 100 to 200 bushels per acre, corn 70 to 90 bushels per acre, oats 40 bushels per acre, wheat 20 to 30 bushels per acre, and hay one to two tons per acre. J.H. Battle's 1887 History of Columbia and Montour Counties, Pennsylvania stated that the Fishing Creek valley was fertile.|$|E
5|$|On March 3, 2008, the Michigan Department of Transportation and the MTO (in {{partnership}} with Transport Canada, the Federal Highway Administration of the United States and the Detroit River International Crossing group) completed a joint assessment on <b>the</b> <b>soils</b> along the Detroit River and determined they could indeed support {{the weight of}} a new bridge; the stability of the underlying soil and clay and the impact of the nearby Windsor Salt Mine had caused concern for all parties involved in the project.|$|E
5|$|Poisoning {{typically}} {{results from}} ingestion of {{food or water}} contaminated with lead, and less commonly after accidental ingestion of contaminated soil, dust, or lead-based paint. Seawater products can contain lead if affected by nearby industrial waters. Fruit and vegetables can be contaminated by high levels of lead in <b>the</b> <b>soils</b> they were grown in. Soil can be contaminated through particulate accumulation from lead in pipes, lead paint, and residual emissions from leaded gasoline.|$|E
40|$|After the red mud {{spill in}} Hungary {{one of the}} risk {{reduction}} measures was to remove the deposits from <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> surface. <b>The</b> residual thin red mud layer was ploughed into <b>the</b> <b>soil.</b> <b>The</b> aim of the present 8 -month-long lab-scale microcosm experiment was to estimate the red mud amount with no adverse effects on <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> as natural habitat and to assess the mid-term environ-mental risk of red mud mixed into <b>the</b> <b>soil.</b> <b>The</b> red mud ratio mixed into <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> ranged between 0 – 40 %. The experiments were monitored by physico-chemical, biological and ecotoxico-logical methods.

50|$|Organic matter {{tends to}} make <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> color darker. Humus, {{the final stage of}} organic matter {{breakdown}} is black. Throughout the stages of organic matter breakdown the colour imparted to <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> varies from browns to black. Sodium content influences the depth of colour of organic matter and therefore <b>the</b> <b>soil.</b> Sodium causes <b>the</b> organic matter (humus) to disperse more readily and spread over <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> particles, making <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> look darker (blacker).|$|R
5|$|The Marcellus {{is easily}} eroded, {{and is also}} found {{underlying}} low areas between some Appalachian ridges, forming linear valleys of moderate relief. These bedrock surfaces are typically covered with colluvium from erosion of stratigraphically higher and more erosion-resistant strata that form the surrounding higher ground. <b>The</b> <b>soils</b> formed from the Marcellus and the overlying Hamilton shales are deep, free of stones, and well suited for agriculture.|$|E
5|$|The Nemegt Formation was {{deposited}} {{within the}} Late Cretaceous, although its exact age is unknown {{as it has}} never been dated radiometrically. According to different authors, the formation is late Campanian to early Maastrichtian, early Maastrichtian, or middle Maastrichtian in age. The sediments of the Nemegt Formation were deposited in a plain crossed by rivers. The climate was warm and subhumid with seasonal droughts, and <b>the</b> <b>soils</b> were relatively dry. Nevertheless, the Nemegt Formation was more humid than the underlying (and thus older) Barun Goyot and Djadochta Formations, which show a semiarid climate.|$|E
5|$|The garden design, asserts the text, {{should include}} rocks and raised mounds of summits, manicured with plants and trees of diverse varieties, {{artificial}} ponds and flowing brooks.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>soils</b> of {{the islands}} reflect the diverse geology. Bute has the most {{productive}} land, and a pattern of deposits that {{is typical of the}} southwest of Scotland. There is a mixture of boulder clay and other glacial deposits in the eroded valleys, and raised beach and marine deposits elsewhere, especially to the south and west which result in a machair landscape in places, inland from the sandy bays, such as Stravanan.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>soil</b> {{temperature}} {{is an important}} microclimatic factor due to <b>the</b> interactions between <b>soil</b> and plant, and the energy exchange with <b>the</b> atmosphere. <b>The</b> <b>soil</b> energy exchange {{is affected by the}} incident solar radiation, type of coverage and mainly by <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> thermal properties. Among <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> thermal properties, <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> thermal diffusivity is highlighted because it affects <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> temperature profile and soil heat flux transport and distribution.

5|$|In the 1990s, most {{applications}} {{that do not}} depend on thorium's radioactivity declined quickly due to safety and environmental concerns as suitable safer replacements were found. Despite its radioactivity, the element has remained in use for applications where no suitable alternatives could be found. A 1981 study by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the United States estimated that using a thorium mantle every weekend would be safe for a person, {{but this was not}} the case for the dose received by people manufacturing the mantles (and thus contacting many) or for <b>the</b> <b>soils</b> around some factory sites. Some manufacturers have changed to other materials, such as yttrium, although these are usually either more expensive or less efficient. Other manufacturers continued to make thorium mantles, but moved their factories to developing countries. As recently as 2007, some companies continued to manufacture and sell thorium mantles without giving adequate information about their radioactivity, with some claiming them to be non-radioactive while using quantities of thorium of up to 259milligrams per mantle.|$|E
5|$|Reported {{values of}} the {{composition}} and concentrations of trace metals and minerals in Boletus edulis tend to differ considerably, as the mushroom bioaccumulates different elements to varying degrees, and the element concentration in the fruit bodies is often {{a reflection of the}} element concentration of <b>the</b> <b>soils</b> from which they were picked. In general, B.edulis contains appreciable amounts of selenium (1317 ppm), a trace mineral essential for good health, though the bioavailability of mushroom-derived selenium is low.
