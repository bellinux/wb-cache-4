[...] Additionally, she found playing the Capricorn girl, a teenager, very tough, saying: [...] "To play a 15-year-old girl without make-up or special effects to make me look younger was the most challenging role for me. I had to look fifteen years old just <b>through</b> <b>my</b> <b>body</b> language. I didn't want any of the twelve girls to be caricatures." [...] Chopra also read Linda Goodman's Sun Signs and Love Signs to prepare for the parts. Initially, it was planned to film one character at a time, however, that did not happen.|$|E

According to Subhas Chandra Bose, {{a proponent of}} armed struggle for Indian independence, Vivekananda was [...] "the maker of modern India"; for Gandhi, Vivekananda's influence increased Gandhi's [...] "love for his country a thousandfold". Vivekananda influenced India's independence movement; his writings inspired independence activists such as Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, Aurobindo Ghose, Bal Gangadhar Tilak and Bagha Jatin and intellectuals such as Aldous Huxley, Christopher Isherwood, Romain Rolland. Many years after Vivekananda's death Rabindranath Tagore told French Nobel laureate Romain Rolland, [...] "If {{you want to know}} India, study Vivekananda. In him everything is positive and nothing negative". Rolland wrote, [...] "His words are great music, phrases in the style of Beethoven, stirring rhythms like the march of Händel choruses.

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. July 2016. Major: Education, Curriculum and Instruction. Advisor: Timothy Lensmire. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); iv, 131 pages. The histories and structures that undergird teachers’ positions in schools are deeply entrenched in colonial, racist, patriarchal and classist ways of being. The unique historical and political phenomenon of white women’s overwhelming presence in education has harnessed constructions of white femininity (as caring, innocent, and inherently good) to the colonial project of nation building. Tasked to legitimate and uphold hierarchies of power while remaining subservient to them, white women {{teachers have been}} disciplined and produced in particular ways. This contradiction lives in our bodies and through our stories. As a white woman teacher, I use critical autoethnography (Boylorn & Orbe, 2013) to engage with the question: What dangerous histories live in and <b>through</b> <b>my</b> schooled <b>body?</b> <b>My</b> study explores three important episodes in my relationship with teaching and learning and attempts to dynamically foreground different concerns (social class, race, and gender) in considering the entanglement of white femininity within them. This work illuminates the importance of stories and bodies in critical anti-racist work and uses stories as tools in intersectional analysis...|$|R

If it were possible to conceive God in a strict sense, that is, as we conceive a horse or a tree, even God himself could not excite any reverence, though he might excite fear or terror, or perhaps love, as a tiger or a beautiful woman.
