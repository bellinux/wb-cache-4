5|$|Although the Euclidean {{algorithm}} {{is used to}} find the greatest common divisor of two natural numbers (positive integers), it may be generalized <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> numbers, and to other mathematical objects, such as polynomials, quadratic integers and Hurwitz quaternions. In the latter cases, the Euclidean {{algorithm is}} used to demonstrate the crucial property of unique factorization, i.e., that such numbers can be factored uniquely into irreducible elements, the counterparts of prime numbers. Unique factorization is essential to many proofs of number theory.|$|E

5|$|Exponentiation {{occurs in}} many areas of {{mathematics}} and its inverse function {{is often referred to as}} the logarithm. For example, the logarithm of a matrix is the (multi-valued) inverse function of the matrix exponential. Another example is the p-adic logarithm, the inverse function of the p-adic exponential. Both are defined via Taylor series analogous <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> case. In the context of differential geometry, the exponential map maps the tangent space at a point of a manifold to a neighborhood of that point. Its inverse is also called the logarithmic (or log) map.|$|E
5|$|Eyespots are {{a type of}} automimicry used by some lepidopterans. In butterflies, {{the spots}} are {{composed}} of concentric rings of scales of different colours. The proposed role of the eyespots is to deflect predators' attention. Their resemblance to eyes provokes the predator's instinct to attack these wing patterns. The role of filamentous tails in Lycaenidae has been suggested as confusing predators as <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> location of the head, giving them {{a better chance of}} escaping alive and relatively unscathed.|$|E

5|$|Food webs {{are often}} limited {{relative}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> world. Complete empirical measurements are generally restricted {{to a specific}} habitat, such as a cave or a pond, and principles gleaned from food web microcosm studies are extrapolated to larger systems.

Despite these limitations, food webs remain a valuable tool in understanding community ecosystems.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{estimates}} <b>the</b> equilibrium <b>real</b> {{exchange rate}} and <b>the</b> resulting <b>real</b> exchange rate misalignment in Namibia during <b>the</b> period 1970 <b>to</b> 2004. <b>The</b> equilibrium <b>real</b> exchange rate {{is determined by}} trade and exchange restrictions (openness), terms of trade and ratio of investment to GDP. An increase in openness and ratio of investment <b>to</b> GDP cause <b>the</b> <b>real</b> exchange rate <b>to</b> appreciate. <b>The</b> <b>real</b> exchange rate was overvalued for almost the entire estimation period.

5|$|Ahmad ibn Tulun, a Turkish soldier, {{had managed}} to become {{governor}} of Egypt in 868. By using the country's immense wealth to raise an army of his own, and exploiting the instability of the central Abbasid government, over the next years he became de facto autonomous, although he continued to acknowledge the suzerainty of the Abbasid caliph‚Äîfor most of his reign the powerless al-Mu'tamid‚Äîand to forward some tax revenue to the central government. Ibn Tulun's power made him a major rival <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> power behind the Abbasid throne, al-Mu'tamid's brother and regent al-Muwaffaq. The latter tried in 877 to wrest Egypt from Ibn Tulun, but the attempt failed spectacularly, and {{in the following year}} Ibn Tulun extended his area of control over Syria up to the border zone with the Byzantine Empire in the north and up to Raqqa in the western Jazira in the east, immediately adjacent to the Abbasid metropolitan province of Iraq.|$|E
