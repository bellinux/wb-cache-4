5|$|<b>The</b> <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> Frederick's {{death and}} the length of his reign are {{important}} topics among historians.

40|$|Recently, {{security}} of the computer systems becomes an important problem. Almost all computers use the password mechanism for the user authentication. But password mechanism has many issues. In this paper, we propose a kind of biometrics authentication method using <b>the</b> <b>timings</b> <b>of</b> key strokes of an identical simple phrase for all users. For this method, selection of the phrase is important. We analyzed <b>the</b> <b>timings</b> <b>of</b> key strokes using Self Organizing Map (SOM) and selected the suitable phrase for authentication.

40|$|We {{address the}} problem of {{providing}} compositional hard real-time guarantees in a hierarchy of schedulers. We first propose a resource model to characterize a periodic resource allocation and present exact schedulability conditions for our proposed resource model under the EDF and RM algorithms. Using the exact schedulability conditions, we then provide methods to abstract <b>the</b> <b>timing</b> requirements that a set of periodic tasks demands under the EDF and RM algorithms as a single periodic task. With these abstraction methods, for a hierarchy of schedulers, we introduce a composition method that derives <b>the</b> <b>timing</b> requirements <b>of</b> a parent scheduler from <b>the</b> <b>timing</b> requirements <b>of</b> its child schedulers in a compositional manner such that <b>the</b> <b>timing</b> requirement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parent scheduler is satisfied, if and only if, <b>the</b> <b>timing</b> requirements <b>of</b> its child schedulers are satisfied. 1...|$|R
40|$|Software {{simulation}} of embedded systems is generally {{less expensive and}} offers more flexibility than direct test-ing on hardware. In embedded systems, {{it is necessary to}} consider <b>the</b> concurrency and <b>timing</b> properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tar-get system that are not captured by the sequential execution of its code. To account for <b>the</b> <b>timing</b> properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> target system, the simulator must be able to estimate <b>the</b> <b>timing</b> be-havior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system under simulation. This paper proposes a method to efficiently extract a <b>timing</b> profile from <b>the</b> tar-get system that allows the simulator to accurately estimate <b>the</b> <b>timing</b> characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> embedded system. 1...|$|R
5|$|Beyond Two Rivers, {{the trail}} reaches the Chena River {{northwest}} of Fairbanks. This {{is the final}} stretch, and mushers use the river to enter Fairbanks and reach the finish line, {{which is on the}} river itself in the middle of downtown Fairbanks. Regardless of <b>the</b> <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> the finish, several thousand spectators typically gather to watch the first musher cross the finish line.|$|E
5|$|Chickenpox was {{commonly}} {{confused with}} smallpox {{in the immediate}} post-eradication era. Chickenpox and smallpox can be distinguished by several methods. Unlike smallpox, chickenpox does not usually affect the palms and soles. Additionally, chickenpox pustules are of varying size due to variations in <b>the</b> <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> pustule eruption: smallpox pustules are all very nearly the same size since the viral effect progresses more uniformly. A variety of laboratory methods are available for detecting chickenpox in evaluation of suspected smallpox cases.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} an energy harvesting transmitter sending status updates regarding a physical phenomenon it observes to a receiver. Different {{from the existing}} literature, we consider a scenario where the status updates carry information about an independent message. The transmitter encodes this message into <b>the</b> <b>timings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> status updates. The receiver needs to extract this encoded information, as well as update {{the status of the}} observed phenomenon. <b>The</b> <b>timings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> status updates, therefore, determine both the age of information (AoI) and the message rate (rate). We study the tradeoff between the achievable message rate and the achievable average AoI. We propose several achievable schemes and compare their rate-AoI performances...|$|R
50|$|Coordinated Video Timings (VESA-2013-3 v1.2) is a {{standard}} by VESA which defines <b>the</b> <b>timings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> component video signal. Initially intended for use by computer monitors and video cards, the standard made its way into consumer televisions.|$|R
5|$|Conversely, DST can {{adversely}} affect farmers, parents of young children, and others whose hours are {{set by the}} sun and they have traditionally opposed the practice, although some farmers are neutral. One reason why farmers oppose DST is that grain is best harvested after dew evaporates, so when field hands arrive and leave earlier in summer their labor is less valuable. Dairy farmers are another group who complain of the change. Their cows are sensitive to <b>the</b> <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> milking, so delivering milk earlier disrupts their systems. Today some farmers' groups {{are in favor of}} DST.|$|E
5|$|Daurises, {{who seems}} to have had the largest army, {{initially}} took his army to the Hellespont. There, he systematically besieged and took the cities of Dardanus, Abydos, Percote, Lampsacus and Paesus, each in a single day according to Herodotus. However, when he heard that the Carians were revolting, he moved his army southwards to attempt to crush this new rebellion. This places <b>the</b> <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> the Carian revolt to early 497 BC.|$|E
5|$|Earnings {{management}} {{may involve}} exploiting {{opportunities to make}} accounting decisions that change the earnings figure reported on the financial statements. Accounting decisions can in turn affect earnings because they can influence <b>the</b> <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> transactions and the estimates used in financial reporting. For example, a comparatively small change in the estimates for uncollectible accounts can {{have a significant effect}} on net income, and a company using last-in, first-out accounting for inventories can increase net income in times of rising prices by delaying purchases to future periods.|$|E
