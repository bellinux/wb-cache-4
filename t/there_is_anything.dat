But who is there that is superior to humanity, except God? Therefore, God exists.|$|E

She was like Millie in her childhood, {{and as a}} result knows how to deal with any trouble caused by her, much to Millie's annoyance. While Ms. Mudd knows how to deal with Millie, she is also the first to lend her support if <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>anything</b> amiss. She married Llewellyn {{at the end of the}} strip's run in a storyarc from November–December 2008. Her full name was revealed on October 1, 2008.|$|E
5|$|Written by James Follett, this {{involved}} monsters {{attacking a}} race of beings who live inside Halley's Comet, unaware that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>anything</b> beyond it they believe that their world is the sum and total of the universe. Into the Comet would have used the companions of Romana and K9. Follett was a novelist who pitched this idea to script editor Douglas Adams circa September 1979 when they met up and discussed the forthcoming return of Halley's Comet. Unfortunately the storyline was rejected by Adams. Follett resubmitted Into the Comet to new script editor Christopher H. Bidmead around May 1980, but once again the storyline was not pursued.|$|E

In addition, they do not tend to pocket things like money, gems, and the like, as they are depicted as having little concept of monetary value. Kender oppose actual thieving vehemently, and consider being called a thief a great insult to their dignity.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} pratītyasamutpāda {{has also been}} {{compared}} to the Western philosophy of metaphysics, {{the study of the}} nature of being and ultimate reality. Schilbrack states says that the doctrine of interdependent origination seems to fit the definition of a metaphysical teaching, by questioning whether <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>anything</b> at all. Hoffman disagrees, and asserts that pratītyasamutpāda should not be considered a metaphysical doctrine in the strictest sense, since it does not confirm nor deny specific entities or realities.|$|E
25|$|Not only Derozio’s erudition and scholarship, but {{his liberal}} ways {{also had an}} immense impact on the students. For the first time, they were {{learning}} to question things. When Ramtanu Lahiri was in the third class (second year, as per today’s concept), the followers of Derozio published a monthly magazine named Athenium. One of the students, Madhab Chandra Mallick, wrote in it, “If <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>anything</b> we hate {{from the bottom of}} our heart, it is Hinduism.” Madhab Chandra Mallick was a friend of Ramtanu Lahiri and was later posted as a deputy collector in Krishnanagar.|$|E

Going to tell the police their findings, the sleeping Pippa is left alone and, after a moment, Jeremy re-enters {{and is about to}} smother the girl's face with a cushion when Clarissa comes back. She soon realises that he is the killer. He was away from the other two men for a time after they had gone to the club to eat and a remark Pippa made about seeing his golf club ("A golf stick like Jeremy had", {{in the context of the}} weapon used to kill Costello) ties in. He also rang the police to try to incriminate Clarissa. Jeremy confesses; his motive was the envelope that the autographed papers were kept in – on it is an extremely rare error stamp worth the fourteen thousand pounds. He is about to kill Clarissa when the police enter the room, having heard the exchange, and arrest him. They take him away. The others go to bed and Henry returns but without his diplomatic guests who have failed to turn up. Like the police inspector, he fails to believe a word his wife tells him of the evening's events...|$|E

500|$|Scientists, Ruse argues, {{continue}} to slide easily from one notion of progress to another: even committed Darwinians like Richard Dawkins embed {{the idea of}} cultural progress in a theory of cultural units, memes, that act much like genes. Dawkins can speak of [...] "progressive rather than random... trends in evolution". Dawkins and John Krebs deny the [...] "earlier [...] prejudice" [...] that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>anything</b> [...] "inherently progressive about evolution", but the feeling of progress comes from evolutionary arms races which remain in Dawkins's words [...] "by far the most satisfactory explanation {{for the existence of}} the advanced and complex machinery that animals and plants possess".|$|E
500|$|Seven men met {{to draft}} the {{invitation}} to the Protestant Dutch Stadtholder, William, Prince of Orange, to invade England and assume the throne. The signatories to the letter included Whigs, Tories, and the Bishop of London, Henry Compton, who assured the Prince that, [...] "Nineteen parts of twenty of the people... are desirous of change". William needed no further encouragement. Although the invitation was not signed by Churchill (he was not, as yet, of sufficient political rank to be a signatory), he declared his intention through William's principal English contact in The Hague – [...] "If you think <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>anything</b> else that I ought to doe, you have but to command me". Churchill, like many others, was looking for an opportune time to desert James.|$|E
500|$|Francis {{expresses a}} resentment {{of all forms}} of authority, {{particularly}} during the end of the frame story, when he feels he has been institutionalized because of the madness of the authorities, not because <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>anything</b> wrong with him. Francis can be seen, at least within the main narrative, as a symbol of reason and enlightenment triumphing over the irrational tyrant and unmasking the absurdity of social authority. But Kracauer contended the frame story undermines that premise. He argues if not for the frame story, the tale of Francis's efforts against Dr. Caligari would have been a praiseworthy example of independence and rebellion against authority. However, with the addition of the frame story, which places the veracity of Francis's claims into question, Kracauer argues the film glorifies authority and turns a reactionary story into an authoritarian film: [...] "The result of these modifications was to falsify the action and to ultimately reduce it to the ravings of a madman." [...] Kracauer believed these changes were not necessarily intentional, but rather an [...] "instinctive submission to the necessities of the screen" [...] because commercial films had to [...] "answer to mass desires". Fritz Lang disagreed with Kracaucer's argument, and instead believes the frame story makes the film's revolutionary inclinations more convincing, not less. David Robinson said, as time passed, filmgoers have been less inclined to interpret the film as a vindication of authority because modern audiences have grown more skeptical of authority in general, and are more inclined to believe Francis's story and interpret the asylum director as wrongly committing Francis to silence him.|$|E

500|$|The {{commercial}} for the fragrance found {{controversy in the}} United Kingdom with UK's Advertising Standards Authority. It was banned from the country's daytime TV rotation due to its [...] "sexy imagery" [...] and was only shown after 7:30 in the afternoon. The U.K.'s Advertising Standards Authority commented on the ban decision, stating [...] "We considered that Beyoncé's body movements and the camera's prolonged focus on shots of her dress slipping away to partially expose her breasts created a sexually provocative ad that was unsuitable {{to be seen by}} young children." [...] Coty, Inc., the world's largest fragrance company, replied to the ban, stating that they do not think <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>anything</b> too explicit about the TV spot. Coty continued that the commercial was [...] "intended to reflect the singer Beyoncé's personal 'sexy chic' style," [...] and while Beyoncé's cleavage is exposed at certain parts of the commercial, Coty stated that it is not [...] "overtly graphic or explicitly sexual and at no point was Beyoncé naked." [...] Brad Wete of Entertainment Weekly defended Beyoncé, saying that [...] " [...] is sexy. It's suggestive and sultry. But it's certainly not X-rated." [...] Beyoncé's mother and collaborator Tina Knowles called the commercial's ban [...] "very good", as people purposely went to watch the video which further increased sales. Beyoncé herself also responded jokingly to the ban, saying, [...] "Where's the wind coming from? It started out only , and then it kind of created this effect with my hair... You can only imagine, the show is two and a half hours. It's really, really warm onstage." ...|$|E
500|$|One of {{the most}} {{striking}} disorders of consciousness goes by the name anosognosia, a Greek-derived term meaning unawareness of disease. [...] This is a condition in which patients are disabled in some way, most commonly {{as a result of a}} stroke, but either misunderstand the nature of the problem or deny that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>anything</b> wrong with them. [...] The most frequently occurring form is seen in people who have experienced a stroke damaging the parietal lobe in the right hemisphere of the brain, giving rise to a syndrome known as hemispatial neglect, characterized by an inability to direct action or attention toward objects located to the left with respect to their bodies. [...] Patients with hemispatial neglect are often paralyzed on the right side of the body, but sometimes deny being unable to move. [...] When questioned about the obvious problem, the patient may avoid giving a direct answer, or may give an explanation that doesn't make sense. [...] Patients with hemispatial neglect may also fail to recognize paralyzed parts of their bodies: [...] one frequently mentioned case is of a man who repeatedly tried to throw his own paralyzed right leg out of the bed he was lying in, and when asked what he was doing, complained that somebody had put a dead leg into the bed with him. [...] An even more striking type of anosognosia is Anton–Babinski syndrome, a rarely occurring condition in which patients become blind but claim to be able to see normally, and persist in this claim in spite of all evidence to the contrary.|$|E
500|$|Natasha starts dating Andrew Robinson (Jordan Smith) and she {{believes}} that they are perfect for each other. Novakovic said that they [...] "bring out the worst in each other" [...] and added [...] "I don't think she could find a guy that would tolerate her like Andrew does. She thinks he's the only guy she could possibly be with." [...] Natasha thinks that school and studying is not cool and is happy that Andrew feels the same, until Summer Hoyland joins their class and Andrew becomes interested in his studies. Natasha fears that she could lose her control over Andrew. Summer later asks Natasha if <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>anything</b> else, other than the physical aspect, to her relationship with Andrew. Novakovic says that [...] "Natasha is furious, but it does make her {{stop and think about}} what she is doing." [...] Natasha does begin to have her doubts about the relationship and she decides to test Andrew, by telling him she wants their relationship to have to be about communicating and understanding each other. Andrew does not take the new direction of the relationship well. Novakovic said that Natasha believes the relationship between her neighbours, Susan (Jackie Woodburne) and Karl Kennedy (Alan Fletcher), is something to be inspired by. She added [...] "That's what she wants to look forward to, but she's getting way ahead of herself. Andrew likes her but he isn't as serious as she is." [...] Novakovic opined that Andrew and Natasha [...] "bring out the worst in each other" [...] and that Natasha's relationship with Andrew had been one of her favourite storylines.|$|E

500|$|In November 1908, Macmillan {{appeared}} in London to argue, as a university graduate, for {{her right to}} vote for Scottish University seats. During her speech, the buildings of Parliament were made to suspend the temporary arrangements {{put in place to}} prevent women from entering—such arrangements had been instituted after the first militant suffrage agitations. Macmillan was the first woman to argue a case before the bar of the House of Lords. She was backed by her contemporary, Frances Simson, one of the first eight female graduates of Edinburgh. Given audience late in the day, Macmillan spoke for three quarters of an hour. Press reports of the appearance described her as a [...] "modern Portia." [...] In Scotland, Glasgow's The Herald reported that she began nervously but warmed to her subject and [...] "argued law in an admirable speaking voice". Two days later she continued to plead her case, this time in [...] "complete self-possession", wearing a dark red outfit and hat trimmed with ermine furs. Like other suffragists in Britain and the United States, she based her case on the words person and persons in the voting statutes, arguing that such unspecific words were no basis for the exclusion of one entire sex from voting. The court upheld both lower courts' decisions that the word persons did not include women when referring to privileges granted by the state. She lost the case, but The New York Times reported that she responded to the decision against her with the words [...] "We'll live to fight another day". In Wellington, New Zealand, the Evening Post wrote a less strident account, noting that Macmillan was cheerful in defeat. After the court adjourned, she said to a reporter from the London Daily Chronicle, [...] "I don't suppose that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>anything</b> more to be done just now, but we shall live to fight another day." [...] No matter her exact words, her time at the House of Lords attracted worldwide publicity which proved valuable to the women's cause.|$|E
