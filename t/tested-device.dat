40|$|The {{industrial}} alliance "cleanroom suitable materials, CSM" developed a standardized measurement and classification {{system based on}} the relevant contamination groups for different clean productions. The emission of particles from material pairings under tribological stress and {{the determination of the}} surface-specific outgassing rate of volatile organic compounds from materials followed by a classification gives a material selection criteria especially for the semiconductor and space industry (standardized under VDI 2083 part 17). The chemical (tested according to ISO 2812) and biological resistance (tested according to ISO 846) of materials is especially relevant for life-science, medical and food applications. Some materials are equipped with a microbicid compound, for example stainless steel doted with silver. The effectivity of the microbicidic treatment can be evaluated based on the ISO 22196. All tested materials within the CSM alliance award a qualification package containing an easy-to-use certification label and a comprehensive documentation. The materials are all listed in the CSM database www. ipa-csm. com and www. <b>tested-device.</b> com. The customer can choose if the material listing in the databases is visible in the public web or only for internal usage...|$|E
40|$|In such {{fields as}} {{cleanroom}} technology for sterile pharmaceutical production, {{more and more}} processes are automated and placed into isolators in order to fulfil the requirements defined by the Good Manufacturing Practice guidelines (GMP). The most flexible automation solution is the usage of a 6 axis robot system. There are plenty industrial 6 axis robot systems on the market, but they are mainly built for normal handling operations for example in car manufacturing. Only a few robot systems are adapted in order to fulfil the GMP requirements regarding the defined cleanliness level for sterile manufacturing processes for particles and microbiological contamination. The current GMP guidelines state further, that “…in clean areas, all surfaces should be smooth, imperious and unbroken {{in order to minimize}} the shredding or accumulation of particles or microorganisms and to permit repeated application of cleaning agents and disinfectants where used. The manufacture of sterile products is subject to special requirements in order to minimize risks of microbiological contamination, and of particulate or pyrogen contamination. ISO 13408 - 6 states that the used surface materials should be evaluated in regards to the absorption and outgas behaviour of decontamination agents such as hydrogen peroxide. Based on these requirements, a six axis robot system for pharmaceutical usage was modified and improved regarding principal hygienic design recommendations. For the <b>Tested-Device</b> certification, the following parameters were tested: - Particle emission - Hygienic Design and Cleanability as weak point assessment - Chemical and biological resistance of exposed material - Ab- and desorption behaviour of the exposed material in regards to hydrogen peroxide. The talk will detail all the mentioned standardized test methods and outline the benefit of such a holistic qualification for a later performed risk analysis...|$|E
