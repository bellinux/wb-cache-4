5|$|Dignity is {{the fourth}} studio album by American {{recording}} artist Hilary Duff. It was released on March 21, 2007, by Hollywood Records. After launching her third record Hilary Duff (2004), she experienced an eventful personal life, including a stalking incident, her parents' separation, and breaking up with her boyfriend. Consequently, Duff assumed an integral position in its production, co-writing almost every <b>track</b> <b>with</b> longtime collaborator Kara DioGuardi instead of her previously-limited involvement.|$|E

5|$|Basic indoor venues may {{be adapted}} gymnasiums, which can easily {{accommodate}} high jump competitions and short track events. Full-size indoor arenas (i.e. those fully equipped to host all events for the World Indoor Championships) bear similarities with their outdoor equivalents. Typically, a central area {{is surrounded by}} a 200-metre oval <b>track</b> <b>with</b> four to eight lanes. The track can be banked at the turns to allow athletes to run around the radius more comfortably. Some have a second running track going straight across the field area, parallel to the straights of the main circuit. This track is used for the 60 metres and 60 metres hurdles events, which are held almost exclusively indoors.|$|E
5|$|By enrollment, Texas Tech is the sixth-largest {{university}} in Texas {{and the largest}} institution {{of higher education in}} the western two-thirds of the state. In the Fall 2014 semester, Texas Tech set a record enrollment with 35,134 students. For the 2014 enrollment year, most students came from Texas (95.17%), followed by New Mexico, California, Colorado, Oklahoma, and Florida. Altogether, the university has educated students from all 50 US states and over 100 foreign countries. Enrollment has continued to increase in recent years, and growth is on <b>track</b> <b>with</b> a plan to have 40,000 students by the year 2020.

5|$|Commercially, {{the song}} topped the Polish and Slovakian charts, {{achieved}} the top-five in Australia, Austria, Czech Republic and Portugal, while also reaching the top-ten in Germany, New Zealand, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and others.

The accompanying music video for the track was directed by Rihanna's longtime collaborator and director Anthony Mandler. Its tropical and romantic setting features an eighteen foot long bed designed specifically for the video. Rihanna promoted the <b>track</b> <b>with</b> live performances at the ACM Awards, along with Sugarland front woman Jennifer Nettles, {{as well as on}} American Idol, NBC's Today show, and on her Loud Tour (2011).

Consequently, throughout October, November and into December, the 2/3rd Battalion took part in three major actions: Eora Creek (22–28 October), Oivi (5–12 November), and an action on the Sanananda Track (21 November– 19 December).|$|E
5|$|Hairway to Steven {{was issued}} in April, and marked a midway point between the band's {{experimental}} roots, {{and the more}} accessible recordings that would follow. While half of the material is as extreme sounding as their earlier work, other songs are more conventional. This was the first Butthole Surfers album to make extensive use of acoustic guitar. Hairway to Steven did not have song titles when first released, and instead represented each <b>track</b> <b>with</b> an absurdist, often scatological, cartoon. The band traveled widely {{in support of the}} album over the next year, including a very successful tour of Europe (helped in part by the influence of new UK distributor Blast First). Like their studio recordings, their live shows were beginning to lose much of their earlier chaos.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{was again}} fastest {{in the second}} session on Friday afternoon, edging out Rosberg by almost seven-tenths of a second. Rosberg's running was limited as he coasted to a halt on <b>track</b> <b>with</b> twenty minutes of the session left to go due to losing drive. Ferrari was not {{competitive}} in eighth and thirteenth place for Vettel and Räikkönen respectively, with both cars suffering from problems with their energy recovery unit. The top five cars were powered by Mercedes, as Sergio Pérez led the charge behind Mercedes in third, ahead of Bottas and Nico Hülkenberg. Fernando Alonso managed eleventh place, but had to spend considerable time in the garage while his team worked on his car. Marcus Ericsson also had limited track time as a problem with his exhaust pipe forced him to miss {{the early part of}} the session. With loose kerbs detected during the GP2 qualifying session, drivers were instructed to stay clear of the kerbs at turn 6. Once more, many drivers had minor incidents on <b>track,</b> <b>with</b> some having to take to the run-off area at turn 3, while Gutiérrez touched the barrier at turn 8. Carlos Sainz Jr. spun at the first corner, but nevertheless finished the session in sixth, the fastest runner without a Mercedes power unit.|$|E
30|$|Distributed <b>tracking</b> <b>with</b> consensus, {{addressed}} in this paper and previous work [27, 28], refers to the problem {{that a group of}} nodes need to achieve an agreement over the state of a dynamical system by exchanging tracking estimates over a network. For instance, space-object <b>tracking</b> <b>with</b> a satellite surveillance network that consists of fixed nodes that are connected together, and mobile nodes that could only have active links with other nodes within their communication radius could benefit from such distributed <b>tracking</b> <b>with</b> consensus, {{due to the fact that}} individual sensor nodes may not have enough observations of sufficient quality [29]. Thus, different sensor nodes may arrive at different local estimates regarding the same space object of interest [29]. Information exchange among nodes may improve the quality of local estimates, and consensus estimates may help avoid conflicting and inefficient distributed decisions. Other applications of this problem include flocking and formation control, real-time monitoring, target tracking, and global positioning system (GPS) [29, 30]. In [28], the performance analysis of distributed <b>tracking</b> <b>with</b> consensus on noisy time-varying graphs was addressed, and later, the algorithm of distributed <b>tracking</b> <b>with</b> consensus with incomplete data was proposed without theoretical proof in [27].|$|R

5|$|Häkkinen {{retired from}} the race when he slowed and later pulled {{to the side of}} the <b>track</b> <b>with</b> fluid leaking from his engine on lap 14. His {{retirement}} allowed Räikkonen to move into the first points-scoring position of sixth. By lap 15, Montoya had a lead of 8.3 seconds over Ralf Schumacher, who in turn was 3.3 seconds in front of Barrichello. Michael Schumacher was a further 9.2 seconds behind his Ferrari teammate, but was drawing ahead of Coulthard in fifth. Barrichello and Panis were the first drivers to make scheduled pit stops on lap 16. The Ferrari and Williams teams were employing different pit stop strategies – the Ferrari were planning a two stop strategy for Barrichello whereas the Williams team were only planning for one stop. Räikkonen slowed on <b>track</b> <b>with</b> an driveshaft failure but managed to return to the pit lane and retire on the same lap, while Irvine retired with an misfiring engine. Two laps later, Burti lost tenth position after he spun and was passed by Trulli and Panis. Barrichello attempted to get past Coulthard for fourth position on lap 19, but Coulthard moved onto a defensive line to keep the position. Montoya continued to pull away from Ralf Schumacher—setting the race's fastest lap of 1:41.808 on lap 20—to maintain his first position after his one and only pit stop. Barrichello was able to overtake Coulthard at the Agip corner on the same lap.|$|E
5|$|In October 1940, {{development}} {{began to}} produce a vehicle {{in response to a}} long-standing requirement for an anti-aircraft vehicle to protect the U.S. Army's mechanized troop convoys from aerial attack. The first vehicle produced {{in the development of a}} half <b>track</b> <b>with</b> an anti-aircraft armament was the T1, which had two M2 machine guns on a Bendix machine gun mountas used on jeepson a 4×4 truck. The T1E1 had a power-operated Bendix mount, and the T1E2 a Maxson mount. The T1E3 had an electro-dynamic Glenn L. Martin Company aircraft-type turret. Evaluation of these test vehicles led to the T1E2 design being preferred. The T1E2 became the M16 Half-track by replacing the M33 with the M45 mount and the M2 Half-track chassis with the M3 Half-track chassis.|$|E
