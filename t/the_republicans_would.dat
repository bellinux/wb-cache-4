500|$|In federal court, Bradley argued {{on behalf}} of the Republican minor {{officers}} that the Goebel Election Law deprived citizens of their right to vote. The right to vote, he claimed, was inherent in the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of [...] "liberty", and could not be taken from any citizen without due process. Federal judge William Howard Taft ruled that <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>would</b> have to seek remedy in the state courts. After a protracted legal battle, all of the minor officers were unseated except Attorney General Clifton J. Pratt.|$|E
500|$|Garfield and his {{supporters}} knew they would face a difficult election {{without the support of}} the New York Stalwarts and decided to offer one of them the vice presidential nomination. [...] Levi P. Morton, the first choice of Garfield's supporters, consulted with Conkling, who advised him to decline, which he did. [...] They next approached Arthur, and Conkling advised him to also reject the nomination, believing <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>would</b> lose. Arthur thought otherwise and accepted. [...] According to a purported eyewitness account by journalist William C. Hudson, Conkling and Arthur argued, with Arthur telling Conkling, [...] "The office of the Vice-President is a greater honor than I ever dreamed of attaining." [...] Conkling eventually relented, and campaigned for the ticket.|$|E
500|$|As the {{election}} of 1880 drew near, Bayard was again regarded as a likely candidate. [...] Hayes had pledged himself to a one-term presidency, which meant <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>would</b> not {{have the advantage of}} incumbency. [...] On the Democratic side, Tilden was regarded as the natural choice, as many Democrats were still convinced he had been robbed of the office in 1876. [...] Tilden's supporters saw Bayard as a rival, and sought to smear him by suggesting he had colluded with Republicans to defeat Tilden in 1876. [...] Meanwhile, in the House, Tilden supporter Clarkson Nott Potter of New York began an investigation into the 1876 election, hoping that evidence of Republican malfeasance would harm that party's candidate in 1880. In fact, the Potter committee's investigation had the opposite effect, uncovering telegrams from Tilden's nephew, William Tilden Pelton, that offered bribes to Southern Republicans in the disputed states to help Tilden claim their votes. [...] The telegrams doomed Tilden's hopes for the nomination, and boosted Bayard's chance among the erstwhile Tilden supporters.|$|E

In the same poll, 64% of the Nebraska voters surveyed were opposed to the health-care bill.|$|R
500|$|On April 11, Sestak held {{a debate}} with Toomey in Philadelphia without Specter present, which media {{observers}} {{described as an}} explicit criticism of Specter for refusing to hold more than one debate with Sestak. During that debate, Sestak strongly attacked Toomey's voting record in what The Morning Call reporter Colby Itkowitz described as [...] "an obvious effort to show Democrats that he could hold his own {{in a general election}} matchup". At the end of the debate, Toomey voiced respect for Sestak and described him as a more principled man than Specter, who he criticized for not participating in more debates. Later that month, when the Senate candidates publicly released their quarterly campaign finance reports on April 15, it was revealed Toomey raised more {{in the first three months}} of 2010 than either Democratic candidate, adding $2.3 million to his total $4.1 million war chest compared to Specter adding $1.1 million to his total $9.1 million fund. Political analysts attributed this to the national swing in momentum toward Republicans, and said that it could indicate <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>would</b> be victorious in many Senate races, including in Pennsylvania. Sestak raised $442,000 in the three-month period, down from his previous quarter, which Specter's campaign said proved Democratic donors had rejected his candidacy. Specter's fundraising advantage was significant because it allowed him to start early in running political campaign commercials.|$|E

However, Democrat nominee Thompson, aided with numerous energetic supporters (particularly former local campaigners for Bernie Sanders, {{who had taken}} the 2016 Kansas Democratic Presidential Caucus by 75%), began {{to show signs of}} the first serious Fourth District challenge to Republicans since Glickman's loss a quarter-century earlier.|$|R

2500|$|There {{has also}} been {{controversy}} regarding the [...] "nuclear option", under which <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>would</b> change a rule in the Senate to prevent the filibuster of judicial nominations. Although Frist claimed that [...] "ever before has a minority blocked a judicial nominee that has majority support for an up-or-down vote on the Senate floor", critics pointed to the nearly two-century history of the filibuster, including the successful four-day 1968 minority Republican filibuster of Lyndon Baines Johnson's chief justice nominee, Abe Fortas.|$|E

2500|$|By December 21, the Republican {{forces were}} in the town.

[...] Rey d'Harcourt, the Nationalist commander, pulled his remaining defenders back to an area where {{he could make a}} last stand {{in the southern part of}} the town. By Christmas Day the Nationalists still occupied a cluster of four key points, the Civil Governor's Building, the Bank of Spain, the Convent of Santa Clara and the Seminary. [...] Republican Radio Barcelona announced that Teruel had fallen, but d'Harcourt and the remnants of the 4,000 man garrison still held out.

However, Dutch forces withdrew to positions held before the July 1947 military action and <b>the</b> <b>republicans</b> <b>would</b> take over civilian administration upon returning to those areas. The Indonesian side accepted the proposal in its entirely, but the Dutch gave only partial agreement and put forward 12 counter proposals.

The Dutch not accept troop withdrawals or Indonesian civilian administration in those areas returned to their control. The Dutch also opposed any [...] international observation of the agreement.|$|E
2500|$|On May 8, 1872, as {{covered by}} the Washington Star, Mosby {{personally}} thanked now-U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant for that document. Mosby also told Grant he believed vehemently that election of Horace Greeley (a long-time editor of the New York Tribune detested in the South) would be worse for the South because the men surrounding him were worse than those surrounding his old benefactor Grant. A few days later, Massachusetts Congressman Benjamin Butler presented an amnesty bill for former Confederates, as Mosby had suggested in that meeting, and soon President Grant signed it into law. After Greeley became the Democratic party's nominee in July, Mosby became Grant's campaign manager in Virginia, and an active Republican, although he also made sure <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>would</b> not run a candidate against his friend and fellow Warrenton attorney Eppa Hunton, who campaigned and won as a Democrat. In his autobiography Grant stated, [...] "Since {{the close of the}} war, I have come to know Colonel Mosby personally and somewhat intimately. He is a different man entirely from what I supposed. ... He is able and thoroughly honest and truthful." ...|$|E

2500|$|Nobody had {{doubted that}} these {{negotiations}} {{would produce a}} form of Irish government short of the independence wished for by republicans. The United Kingdom could not offer a republican form of government without losing prestige and risking demands for something similar throughout the Empire. Furthermore, {{as one of the}} negotiators, Michael Collins, later admitted (and he would have known, given his leading role in the independence war), the IRA {{at the time of the}} truce was weeks, if not days, away from collapse, with a chronic shortage of ammunition. [...] "Frankly, we thought they were mad", Collins said of the sudden British offer of a truce â€“ although <b>the</b> <b>republicans</b> <b>would</b> probably have continued the struggle in one form or another, given the level of public support. Since Lloyd George had already, after the truce had come into effect, made it clear to President of the Republic, Ã‰amon de Valera, [...] "that the achievement of a republic through negotiation was impossible", de Valera decided not to become a member of the treaty delegation and so not to risk more militant republicans labelling him as a [...] "sellout". Yet his own proposals â€“ published in January 1922 â€“ fell far short of an autonomous all-Ireland republic. Sinn FÃ©in's abstention was unambiguous.|$|E
60|$|This was not {{considered}} expedient: but it was resolved that {{the attack on the}} camp should be renewed as early as possible on the following morning, as it was considered that <b>the</b> <b>republicans</b> <b>would</b> not expect so quick a return of an army which had been completely routed; and might, therefore, to a certain extent, be taken by surprise.|$|E

60|$|In the meantime, the {{authorities}} had sent to Clisson and arrested M. de Lescure, his wife, her parents, {{and some of}} their guests, who were conducted to Bressuire, the nearest town, and there closely guarded. There was great danger that <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>would</b> revenge their losses upon them, but the calm dignified deportment of M. de Lescure obliged them to respect him so much that no injury was offered to him. At last came the joyful news that the Royalist army was approaching. The Republican soldiers immediately quitted the town, and the inhabitants all came to ask the protection of the prisoners, desiring to send their goods to Clisson for security, and thinking themselves guarded by the presence of M. and Madame de Lescure.|$|E
60|$|On the {{day after}} that on which de Lescure had passed over, she was sitting alone in her cabin, and the unceasing whirl of her spinning-wheel proved that the distractions of the time had not made her idle.

We cannot object, even though he agreed with us in thinking slavery wrong. That cannot excuse violence, bloodshed and treason. It could avail him nothing that he might think himself right. So, if we constitutionally elect a President, and therefore you undertake to destroy the Union, it will be our duty to deal with you as old John Brown has been dealt with.
