25|$|The {{topic of}} animal {{consciousness}} is beset {{with a number}} of difficulties. It poses the problem of other minds in an especially severe form because animals, lacking the ability to use human language, cannot <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> their experiences. Also, it is difficult to reason objectively about the question, because a denial that an animal is conscious is often taken to imply that it does not feel, its life has no value, and that harming it is not morally wrong. The 17th-century French philosopher René Descartes, for example, has sometimes been blamed for mistreatment of animals because he argued that only humans are conscious.|$|E
25|$|Some {{evidence}} can {{be gathered}} from the 'usual suspects', like Caesar's De Bello Gallico, who discusses some aspects of Celtic laws in {{his account of the}} Gaulish Wars, specifically his famous excursus on the Gauls, but also in some other passages. Some of these passages allow us to confirm the existence, in some Iron Age Celtic laws, of some of the legal principles which can be reconstructed from early medieval Celtic laws as likely elements of common Celtic law, increasing the likelihood of any such generalised reconstruction. Other passages can <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> particular legal practices in individual Gaulish societies, which are specific for just the society described, without allowing any greater generalisations.|$|E
25|$|The {{influence}} of Plautus's plays was {{felt in the}} early 16th century. Limited records suggest that the first known university production of Plautus in England was of Miles Gloriosus at Oxford in 1522-3. The magnum jornale of Queens College contains {{a reference to a}} comoedia Plauti in either 1522 or 1523. This fits directly with comments made in the poems of Leland about the date of the production. The next production of Miles Gloriosus that is known from limited records was given by the Westminster School in 1564. Other records also <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> performances of the Menaechmi.

500|$|However, Wolcott Gibbs of The New Yorker {{called the}} musical [...] "a {{shocking}} disappointment".

500|$|The most {{commonly}} given {{answer is that}} we attribute consciousness to other people because we see that they resemble us in appearance and behavior; we reason that if they look like us and act like us, they must be like us in other ways, including having experiences {{of the sort that}} we do. [...] There are, however, a variety of problems with that explanation. [...] For one thing, it seems to violate the principle of parsimony, by postulating an invisible entity that is not necessary to explain what we observe. [...] Some philosophers, such as Daniel Dennett in an essay titled The Unimagined Preposterousness of Zombies, argue that people who give this explanation do not really understand what they are saying. [...] More broadly, philosophers who do not accept the possibility of zombies generally believe that consciousness is reflected in behavior (including verbal behavior), and that we attribute consciousness on the basis of behavior. [...] A more straightforward way of saying this is that we attribute experiences to people because of what they can do, including the fact that they can <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> their experiences.|$|E
500|$|Writers for Variety, the Hollywood Reporter and Sight & Sound all {{emphasized}} the film's final scene. Scheck (Hollywood Reporter) wrote that [...] "Miike lulls the audience {{into a state}} of complacency with a studied, slow-moving, lightly comic first half before delivering a gruesome final section that makes Stephen King's Misery look wholesome"; the ending was [...] "all the more shocking for the clinical way in which it is presented". Eisner (Variety) stated that it is only at the ending of the film that Audition [...] "breaks out of creepfest ghetto". [...] In his essay on themes in Audition, Robin Wood stated that most of Miike's films are disturbing for [...] "what they have to <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> the state of contemporary civilization; they are not in the least disturbing in themselves, operating on some fantasy level of annihilation, with 'comic-book' violence". In comparison, he stated that Audition is [...] "authentically disturbing, and infinitely more horrifying: the first time I watched it – on DVD, at home, after warnings I had received – I was repeatedly tempted, through the last half hour, to turn it off". Wood compared the film to Pier Paolo Pasolini's Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom, stating that the film was [...] "almost as unwatchable as the news reels – of Auschwitz, of the innocent victims of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and Vietnam, victims of Nazi or American dehumanization".|$|E
500|$|Jerry Coyne, {{writing in}} Nature, {{described}} {{the book as}} for the interested lay reader, and called it [...] "a paean to recent advances in developmental genetics, and what they may <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> the evolutionary process." [...] For him, the centrepiece was [...] "the unexpected discovery that the genes that control the body plans of all bilateral animals, including worms, insects, frogs and humans, are largely identical. These are the 'homeobox' (Hox) genes". He called Carroll {{a leader in the}} field and an [...] "adept communicator", but admits to [...] "feeling uncomfortable" [...] when Carroll sets out his personal vision of the field [...] "without admitting that large parts of that vision remain controversial." [...] Coyne pointed out that the idea that the [...] "'regulatory gene' is the locus of evolution" [...] dates back to Roy Britten and colleagues around 1970, but was still weakly supported by observation or experiment. He granted that chimps and humans are almost 99% identical at DNA level, but points out that [...] "humans and chimps have different amino-acid sequences in at least 55% of their proteins, a figure that rises to 95% for humans and mice. Thus we can't exclude protein-sequence evolution as an important reason why we lack whiskers and tails." [...] He also noted that nearly half of human protein-coding genes do not have homologues in fruit flies, so one could argue the opposite of Carroll's thesis and claim that [...] "evolution of form is very much a matter of teaching old genes to make new genes." ...|$|E
