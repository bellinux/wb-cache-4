5|$|On November 14, 2008, Keyes filed a lawsuit—naming as {{defendants}} California Secretary of State Deborah Bowen, President-elect Barack Obama, Vice President-elect Joe Biden, and California's 55 Democratic electors—challenging Obama's {{eligibility for}} the U.S. Presidency. The suit requested <b>that</b> <b>Obama</b> provide documentation {{that he is}} a natural born citizen of the United States.|$|E
5|$|Another {{controversial}} Peace Prize {{was that}} awarded to Barack Obama in 2009. Nominations had closed only eleven days after Obama took office as President of the United States, {{but the actual}} evaluation occurred over the next eight months. Obama himself stated {{that he did not}} feel deserving of the award, or worthy of the company it would place him in. Past Peace Prize laureates were divided, some saying <b>that</b> <b>Obama</b> deserved the award, and others saying he had not secured the achievements to yet merit such an accolade. Obama's award, along with the previous Peace Prizes for Jimmy Carter and Al Gore, also prompted accusations of a left-wing bias.|$|E
5|$|The {{media have}} been criticized for {{focusing}} more on the First Lady's fashion sense than her serious contributions. She said after the 2008 election that she would like to focus attention as First Lady on issues of concern to military and working families. In 2008 U.S. News & World Report blogger, PBS host and Scripps Howard columnist Bonnie Erbé argued that Obama's own publicists seemed to be feeding the emphasis on style over substance, and has stated <b>that</b> <b>Obama</b> is miscasting herself by overemphasizing style.|$|E
2500|$|... "It is {{absolutely}} critical <b>that</b> <b>Obama's</b> negatives go up with Republicans." ...|$|R
2500|$|At two press {{conferences}} held in March 2012, Arpaio {{and members of}} his Cold Case Posse claimed <b>that</b> President Barack <b>Obama's</b> long-form birth certificate, released by the White House on April 27, 2011, is a computer-generated forgery. The Posse also claimed <b>that</b> <b>Obama's</b> Selective Service card was a forgery. The allegations regarding the birth certificate were repeated at a July 2012 news conference in which Arpaio stated <b>that</b> <b>Obama's</b> long-form birth certificate was [...] "definitely fraudulent." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2015, {{he claimed}} <b>that</b> Barack <b>Obama</b> was [...] "the {{greatest}} tragedy to befall the Jews since {{the destruction of}} the Second Temple." [...] The suggestion <b>that</b> <b>Obama's</b> presidency was worse than the Holocaust was met with derision.|$|R
5|$|On September 24, McCain {{said he was}} {{temporarily}} suspending his campaign activities, called on Obama to join him, and proposed delaying {{the first of the}} general election debates with Obama, in order to work on the proposed U.S. financial system bailout before Congress, which was targeted at addressing the subprime mortgage crisis and liquidity crisis. McCain's intervention helped to give dissatisfied House Republicans an opportunity to propose changes to the plan that was otherwise close to agreement. After Obama declined McCain's suspension suggestion, McCain went ahead with the debate on September 26. On October 1, McCain voted in favor of a revised $700 billion rescue plan. Another debate was held on October 7; like the first one, polls afterward suggested <b>that</b> <b>Obama</b> had won it. A final presidential debate occurred on October 15.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} received American {{news coverage}} during the Democratic Party's 2008 presidential primaries after {{the details of}} a conversation between Barack Obama's economic advisor Austan Goolsbee, and Canadian diplomat Georges Rioux were revealed. Reportedly Goolsbee was reassuring the Canadians that Obama's comments on potentially renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) were more political rhetoric than actual policy. The accuracy of these reports has been debated by both the Obama campaign and the Canadian Government. The news came at a key time nearing the Ohio and Texas primaries, where perceptions among Democratic voters was (and is) that the benefits of the NAFTA agreement are dubious. Thus the appearance <b>that</b> <b>Obama</b> was not being completely forthright was attacked by his opponent Hillary Clinton.|$|E
5|$|On September 15, Obama {{attended}} a Philadelphia fundraising dinner for Specter, an unusually public {{declaration of support}} {{so early in the}} primary season, when the President has the option of remaining neutral until the final outcome becomes clearer. Governor Rendell said <b>that</b> <b>Obama</b> and Biden felt obligated to strongly support Specter because they so strongly lobbied him to switch parties. Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter and radio personality Michael Smerconish also spoke on Specter's behalf. Senate Majority Leader Reid took the unusual steps of scheduling no Senate votes that day so both Specter and Pennsylvania Senator Bob Casey, Jr. could attend the fundraiser. That move drew criticism from Republicans, as well as from Sestak, who felt Specter was skirting his Senate responsibilities, yet hypocritically criticizing Sestak at the same time for missing more than 100 votes in the U.S. House. The event was expected to raise about $2.5 million, which was to be split between Specter's campaign and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. After the fundraiser, Obama and Specter traveled via Air Force One to Pittsburgh to address labor activists at the AFL-CIO convention. There, Specter assured the audience he would support the Employee Free Choice Act, a proposed bill that would make union formation easier, which Specter had previously opposed as a Republican.|$|E
5000|$|In another {{published}} commentary, Root speculated <b>that</b> President <b>Obama</b> attended Columbia University as {{a foreign}} exchange student, citing only his [...] "gut instinct" [...] as evidence, and claimed <b>that</b> President <b>Obama</b> was indoctrinated into Marxism while attending Columbia. Root was specifically referring to the fact <b>that</b> <b>Obama's</b> childhood years spent with his mother in Indonesia. Apparently in response to Senator Harry Reid's speculation about Mitt Romney's tax returns, Root offered speculation on Obama's college records.|$|R

25|$|In Utah, an August 2009 poll {{carried out}} for the Deseret News and KSL-TV found that 67% of Utahns {{accepted}} the evidence <b>that</b> <b>Obama</b> {{was born in the}} U.S. The poll found that those who do not believe <b>that</b> <b>Obama</b> was born in the United States, or do not know, are predominantly middle-aged, lower-income Republican-leaning individuals without a college education.|$|E
25|$|As Obama left office, historians {{expressed}} various {{opinions about}} his effectiveness as president, with many noting that subsequent events would determine his ultimate legacy. There was universal agreement <b>that</b> <b>Obama</b> would long {{be remembered as}} the first African-American president. Many noted <b>that</b> <b>Obama</b> presided over an economic recovery and passed major domestic legislation, but failed to bridge a partisan divide and left office with his party in a weakened state.|$|E

5000|$|Despite {{the release}} of Obama's long-form birth {{certificate}} on April 27, 2011, publisher Joseph Farah told The Washington Post that Where's the Birth Certificate? would not be renamed and would still be released on May 17. He said the imminent publication of the book had pressured Obama into releasing the certificate. Boston Globe columnist Joan Vennochi opined <b>that</b> <b>Obama's</b> birth certificate was released in part to preempt Corsi's book. Corsi responded to the President's April 27 document release by likening it to Nixon's release of a few tapes during the Watergate scandal: [...] "All that did was fuel the fire." [...] Corsi also predicted <b>that</b> <b>Obama's</b> presidency would not survive {{after the publication of}} his book, which he described as documenting multiple legal issues <b>that</b> disqualify <b>Obama</b> from being president.|$|R

Other theories alleged <b>that</b> <b>Obama</b> became {{a citizen of}} Indonesia in childhood, thereby losing his U.S. citizenship. Still others claimed <b>that</b> <b>Obama</b> was not a natural-born U.S. citizen because he was born a dual citizen (British and American). A number of political commentators have characterized these various claims as a racist reaction to Obama's status as the first African American President of the United States.|$|E

5000|$|Nutting wrote a May 2012 column, [...] "Obama {{spending}} binge never happened," [...] which argued <b>that</b> <b>Obamas</b> {{administration had}} been relatively fiscally restrained in its spending policies.
