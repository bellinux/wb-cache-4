Their season started with a narrow 3028 loss to the Crusaders at Jade Stadium, after leading 2827 at one point. That year the Highlanders also achieved a win over all four South African teams; a Grand Slam {{that they had not}} achieved since 1998. The closest of those four victories was a 2120 win over the Stormers in Cape Town. They also defeated the Brumbies 2518 in Canberra, The Gordon Hunter Memorial Trophy was also introduced that season to be contested between the Highlanders and Blues. Gordon Hunter had coached both teams before dying from cancer in 2001. Highland prop said of the game against the Blues “While I’m sure Gordy was popular in Auckland during his time coaching up there, as he’d seemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>everywhere</b> he went, the trophy meant a huge amount to us and we were determined to be the first winners to honour his memory”. The match was played at Eden Park, and the Highlanders were ahead 153 at half time, and eventually won 2013. Their last home match of the season was against the Reds at Carisbrook. The Highlanders’ 4026 win meant that they had gone three seasons undefeated at Carisbrook. With their eight victories from the regular season, the Highlanders finished fourth and played the Crusaders in Christchurch in their semi-final. The Crusaders won 3423 although Jeff Wilson did score a try in his last match for the franchise.|$|E

500|$|In similar fashion, Vedic gods {{such as the}} Agni, Aditya, Indra, Rudra, Visnu, Brahma, {{and others}} become equated in the Upanishads to the supreme, immortal, and incorporeal Brahman-Atman of the Upanishads, god becomes synonymous with self, and is {{declared}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>everywhere,</b> inmost being of each human being and within every living creature. The one reality or ekam sat of the Vedas becomes the ekam eva advitiyam or [...] "the one and only and sans a second" [...] in the Upanishads.

500|$|There were racial {{tensions}} between black US athletes and their white counterparts; in one incident, African Americans blocked whites from the track. One black runner, Tommie Smith, told writers on October 15, [...] "I don't want Brundage presenting me any medals". The following day, Smith won the 200 meters, and fellow African-American John Carlos took the bronze medal. The two men, after receiving their medals from IAAF president Lord Exeter, and as [...] "The Star-Spangled Banner" [...] played, raised black-gloved fists, heads down, in salute of black power. Although the USOC initially only reprimanded the two men, {{under pressure from}} the IOC, two days after the race it suspended them from the team and expelled them from the Olympic Village. Other demonstrations by African-Americans also took place: the three African Americans who took the medals in the 400 meters race, led by gold medalist Lee Evans, wore black berets during the anthem (they were not disciplined by the USOC) while African-American boxer George Foreman, triumphant in the heavyweight division, waved an American flag around the boxing ring and with fellow American boxers invited Brundage to their victory celebration. Brundage's comment about the Smith-Carlos incident was [...] "Warped mentalities and cracked personalities seem <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>everywhere</b> and impossible to eliminate." [...] The USOC's official report omits the iconic photograph of Smith and Carlos with their fists raised; the local organizing committee's official film showed footage of the ceremony. Brundage, who termed the incident [...] "the nasty demonstration against the American flag by negroes", objected in vain to its inclusion.|$|E

2500|$|At an {{altitude}} of 10,000 feet, Leadville was the second largest city in Colorado. It boasted over 100 saloons and gambling places, multiple daily and weekly newspapers, and 36 brothels. Tabor's presence seemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>everywhere.</b> He opened the Tabor Opera House in Leadville, bought luxury items for his wife, Augusta, and established a private army that he used for protection of his holdings and as a force against striking miners. He spent his money lavishly, mostly on his own entertainment—drinking, gambling and frequenting brothels. In 1880, Augusta moved away from him to live in Denver while Tabor enjoyed himself in Leadville. A Denver newspaper columnist described him as [...] "Stoop-shouldered; ambling gait...black hair, inclined to baldness....dresses in black; magnificent cuff buttons of diamonds and onyx...worth 8 million dollars."

2500|$|McDevitt portrays Christopher Sim as an {{unlikely}} hero who rose to greatness through an unexpected [...] "talent for war," [...] a charismatic military genius able to anticipate his enemy’s plans and outwit {{them with his}} own. [...] As McDevitt describes {{the history of the}} war, over several years, Sim's forces won a series of improbable military victories against far superior Ashiyyur forces through a combination of audacity, imaginative tactics, excellent strategic intelligence, and uncanny insights into Ashiyyur psychology. Sim’s forces, small though they were (“sixty-odd frigates and destroyers holding off the massive fleets of the Ashiyyur”), seemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>everywhere</b> at once. McDevitt tells us that Sim's strategic successes foreshadowed his ultimate tactical [...] defeat. While the tide of public opinion (if not government policies) on human worlds slowly turned in favor of the Resistance, Sim’s forces’ unavoidable losses in battle and meager replenishment and the much larger military forces on the other side eventually brought Sim to bay. In a climactic battle near Rigel, Sim’s remaining forces were overwhelmed and his famous ship, the frigate Corsarius, was destroyed. [...] Only a handful of Dellacondan ships survived the battle; the Resistance navy ceased to exist for all practical purposes.|$|E

As in the strip, Shmoos suddenly appeared <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>everywhere</b> in 1949 and 1950—including a Time cover story. A paperback collection of the original sequence, The Life and Times of the Shmoo, became a bestseller for Simon & Schuster. Shmoo dolls, clocks, watches, jewelry, earmuffs, wallpaper, fishing lures, air fresheners, soap, ice cream, balloons, ashtrays, comic books, records, sheet music, toys, games, Halloween masks, salt and pepper shakers, decals, pinbacks, tumblers, coin banks, greeting cards, planters, neckties, suspenders, belts, curtains, fountain pens, and other shmoo paraphernalia were produced. A garment factory in Baltimore turned out a whole line of shmoo apparel, including [...] "Shmooveralls." [...] The original sequence and its 1959 sequel, The Return of the Shmoo, have been collected in print many times since, most recently in 2011, always to high sales figures. The Shmoos would later have their own animated TV series.|$|E
