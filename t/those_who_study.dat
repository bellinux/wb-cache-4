5|$|LTP has {{received}} much attention among <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>study</b> Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disease that causes marked cognitive decline and dementia. Much of this deterioration occurs {{in association with}} degenerative changes in the hippocampus and other medial temporal lobe structures. Because of the hippocampus' well established role in LTP, {{some have suggested that}} the cognitive decline seen in individuals with AD may result from impaired LTP.|$|E
5|$|Duckles {{observes that}} by 1651, the {{transition}} from the lute song to the continuo song was complete. Printed versions of songs can not be entirely trusted to represent what was sung, since, in order to keep engraving costs manageable, they would economize on written vocal embellishments. That's why manuscript sources are crucial to our understanding of transition to Baroque vocal styles. Duckles concludes by warning that <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>study</b> early 17th century lyric poetry must do so in conjunction with their intended musical settings, since words and music are inseparable.|$|E

5|$|There {{have not}} been any {{controlled}} studies on meth mouth, and several of its aspects are unclear.

5|$|The Appaloosa is an American horse breed {{best known}} for its {{colorful}} spotted coat pattern. There is a wide range of body types within the breed, stemming from the influence of multiple breeds of horses throughout its history. Each horse's color pattern is genetically the result of various spotting patterns overlaid on top of one of several recognized base coat colors. The color pattern of the Appaloosa is of interest to <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>study</b> equine coat color genetics, as it and several other physical characteristics are linked to the leopard complex mutation (LP). Appaloosas are prone to develop equine recurrent uveitis and congenital stationary night blindness; the latter has been linked to the leopard complex.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study is to reexamine, through a look at {{childcare}} support workers practice cases, analytical frameworks regarding ability formation of <b>those</b> <b>who</b> support <b>study.</b> Much research has been performed so far using the theory of “Reflection” to discuss the role of practice in the ability formation of <b>those</b> <b>who</b> support <b>study.</b> “Reflection” as used in previous research regarding <b>those</b> <b>who</b> support <b>study</b> has treated formal educational as its area of analysis. Namely, there has been a tendency in research on ability formation of <b>those</b> <b>who</b> support <b>study</b> to employ the theory of “Reflection” to fixed-form course and training session situations. However, ability formation of <b>those</b> <b>who</b> support <b>study</b> occurs not only in formal learning settings alone. It is thought that the process of acquiring new knowledge and skills via the process of awareness, learning, and growing while supporting the learner amidst a relationship of praxis, also leads to the ability formation of <b>those</b> <b>who</b> support <b>study.</b> Therefore, it is it is necessary to examine ability formation by examining not only approaches in formal settings in which courses and training have been set, and programs developed intentionally, for <b>those</b> <b>who</b> support <b>study,</b> but also to widen one 2 ̆ 7 s view to include nonformal settings in which ability formation occurs as a natural result of daily practice. Based on this premise, this study seeks to clarify ability formation of <b>those</b> <b>who</b> support <b>study</b> in nonformal settings by focusing on workers involved in childcare support. My examination centers on interviews with such supporters to consider how their ability forms through daily interactions with parents and children. In interviewing, I invoked a “praxis daily life based” method of collaborative learning to clarify the study supporter 2 ̆ 7 s ability formation in nonformal settings...|$|R

25|$|Bitterness is of {{interest}} to <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>study</b> evolution, as well as various health researchers since {{a large number of}} natural bitter compounds are known to be toxic. The ability to detect bitter-tasting, toxic compounds at low thresholds is considered to provide an important protective function. Plant leaves often contain toxic compounds, yet even amongst leaf-eating primates, {{there is a tendency to}} prefer immature leaves, which tend to be higher in protein and lower in fiber and poisons than mature leaves. Amongst humans, various food processing techniques are used worldwide to detoxify otherwise inedible foods and make them palatable. Furthermore, the use of fire, changes in diet, and avoidance of toxins has led to neutral evolution in human bitter sensitivity. This has allowed several loss of function mutations that has led to a reduced sensory capacity towards bitterness in humans when compared to other species.|$|E

5000|$|In 1947 many {{literary}} critics {{were accused of}} kneeling before the West, anti-patriotism and cosmopolitanism.

500|$|Roosevelt did not {{at first}} respond to Long's claims, {{allegedly}} considering the author [...] "too small game to shoot twice." [...] He did, however, write to Burroughs that he had [...] "no quarrel with Mr. Long for the conclusions he draws from the facts. Our quarrel with him is because he invents the facts." [...] Burroughs proceeded to publicly defend the President against Long's attacks, condemning him and the expert witnesses Long produced to support his claims about the events and behaviors he depicted in his works. Newspapers around the country continuously published interviews with the two naturalists, while comedic depictions of the controversy and its participants were becoming popular with readers. One such parody referred to a non-existent book called How to Tell the Animals from the Wild Flowers, including an illustration which depicted an anthropomorphic [...] "Dandy Lion" [...] with a cane, top hat and monocle. This joke inspired a similarly satirical book, which was published under the title How to Tell the Birds from the Flowers; a collection of humorous illustrations and poems by physicist and children's author Robert Williams Wood, the work included pairings of birds and their corresponding flowers, emphasizing their visual similarities. Making a thinly veiled reference to the much publicized controversy surrounding those authors who were now called [...] "nature fakers", the book concludes: [...] "I have freely drawn upon / The works of Gray and Audubon, / Avoiding though the frequent blunders / Of <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>study</b> Nature's wonders." ...|$|E
