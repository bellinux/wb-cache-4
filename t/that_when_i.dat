5|$|I {{actually}} wrote a {{song about}} it on my album, it's called 'GUY' and it stands for 'Go Under You'. So wearing make-up, smelling delicious and having suckable, kissable, edible things between your limbs is something I find strengthening because I know <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> pick the right guy, I can let him have it. Some women feel oppressed by make-up and clothing, and here’s to them, they {{have every right to}} feel that way as well.|$|E
25|$|I {{just want}} to say <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was 16 or 17 years old, I went to see Buddy Holly play at Duluth National Guard Armory and I was three feet away from him… and he looked at me. And I just have some kind of feeling that he was – I don’t know how or why – but I know he was with us all the time we were making this record in some kind of way.|$|E
25|$|It was Hofmann. It was, I think, {{his last}} {{performance}} in Toronto, {{and it was}} a staggering impression. The only thing I can really remember is <b>that,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was being brought home in a car, I was in that wonderful state of half-awakeness in which you hear all sorts of incredible sounds going through your mind. They were all orchestral sounds, but I was playing them all, and suddenly I was Hofmann. I was enchanted.|$|E

5000|$|Eric Gauthier {{was born}} in Montreal as [...] "son of a leading Alzheimer's researcher". He has said that [...] "at first, all I wanted {{was to be a}} hockey player... a goalie to be exact. But then, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was nine years old, I saw the musical Cats in Toronto and <b>that’s</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> decided I wanted to be a dancer." ...|$|R
25|$|By the way, {{would you}} convey my {{compliments}} to the purist who reads your proofs {{and tell him}} or her that I write {{in a sort of}} broken-down patois which is something like the way a Swiss-waiter talks, and <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> split an infinitive, God damn it, I split it so it will remain split, and when I interrupt the velvety smoothness of my more or less literate syntax with a few sudden words of barroom vernacular, this is done with the eyes wide open and the mind relaxed and attentive. The method may not be perfect, but it is all I have.|$|E
25|$|After {{coming back}} to his grandfather, his family decided to board him to the United States for higher studies. He sailed to San Francisco in July 1912. He was {{supposed}} to get enrolled in University of California, Berkeley but for some unknown reasons he did not take admission in any college. In a historical note by Baba Jwala Singh, what mentioned is <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>i</b> went to Astoria, Oregon in December 1912 i found Kartar Singh working in a mill factory. Most of the people will say that he studied in the respective college but the college itself did not get any record of enrollment with his name.|$|E
25|$|Cruyff is {{sometimes}} {{described as a}} typical kind of ‘artist-footballer’ or ‘footballer-thinker’ who considers football, the so-called 'beautiful game', not a purely athletic/physical competition but an artistic-oriented mind-body game. Because of his distinctive footballing views, Cruyff was called ‘the Spinoza of football’ by some. He believed in a certain style of play, which {{has the power to}} put a smile on the people's faces as he described it. When Cruyff, both as a player and as a manager, spoke about football he often mentioned the entertainment value of the game, that there is more to it than winning. In a 2009 interview with Sportmails Martin Samuel, Arsène Wenger, as a devout follower of Cruyff's footballing ideology, once shared his opinion about football's artistic value, “I believe the target of anything in life should be to do it so well that it becomes an art. When you read some books they are fantastic, the writer touches something in you that you know you would not have brought out of yourself. He makes you discover something interesting in your life. If you are living like an animal, {{what is the point of}} living? What makes daily life interesting is that we try to transform it to something that is close to art. And football is like <b>that.</b> <b>When</b> <b>I</b> watch Barcelona, it is art.” , the author of Cruyff's French biography, called him ‘the greatest actor in the history of football’ because Cruyff was a glorious exception (possibly the only one ever) being the man who ‘played’ outstandingly well multiple roles in the world of football: player, manager, and thinker.|$|E

500|$|According to Hubert Wellington, Delacroix—who {{would become}} the standard-bearer of French Romanticism after Géricault's death—wrote, [...] "Géricault allowed me to see his Raft of Medusa {{while he was still}} working on it.

500|$|New Line Cinema (one-time video {{distributor}} of the original) acquired {{the rights to}} the film from co-rights holder StudioCanal, who will control the European rights, and Carpenter, who will serve as an executive producer and said, [...] "Snake is one of my fondest creations. Kurt Russell did an incredible job, and {{it would be fun to}} see someone else try." [...] Russell has commented on the remake and on the casting of Butler as Plissken, saying, [...] "I will say <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was told who was going to play Snake Plissken, my initial reaction was 'Oh, man!' [...] I do think that character was quintessentially one thing. And that is, American." ...|$|E

After this, she became fluent in English. Sotomayor has {{said that she was}} first inspired by the strong-willed Nancy Drew book character, and then after her diabetes diagnosis led doctors to suggest a different career from detective, she was inspired to go into a legal career and become a judge by watching the Perry Mason television series. [...] She reflected in 1998: [...] "I was going to college and I was going to become an attorney, and I knew <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was ten. Ten. That's no jest." ...|$|E

500|$|As {{part of its}} {{marketing}} campaign for The Girl, HBO released a 30-second trailer in August 2012. During a Television Critics Association press tour promoting the film, Hedren said [...] "I have to say <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> first heard Toby's [...] voice as Alfred Hitchcock, my body just froze". Hedren's daughter, Melanie Griffith, attended a screening; when the film ended, the audience was silent until Griffith said [...] "Well, now I {{have to go back}} into therapy again!" [...] Hedren attended a London [...] screening in October. The Girl made its US television debut on HBO and HBO Canada on 20 October 2012. It had its UK premiere on 26 December, as part of BBC Two's Christmas programming. The film was released on DVD in the UK on 7 January 2013.|$|E
500|$|By {{the summer}} of 2003, Lovering was feeling depressed. In a 2004 interview, he commented: [...] "I {{remember}} I {{was on the way}} to the bank, and I was just bummed out—everything, financially, was really a mess for me. I was involved in this relationship that was absolutely terrible. I was bottoming out. And I'm {{on the way to the}} bank and my cellphone rings. It's Joe he says, 'Guess what?'" [...] Santiago had just received a call from Thompson stating his desire to reunite the Pixies. Lovering was overjoyed at the news. He added that [...] "the saddest thing is <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> sat down to rehearse for the Pixies, I couldn't believe that I had given up something that I loved". In 2004 Lovering and the band recorded their reunion single, [...] "Bam Thwok".|$|E
500|$|Nielsen's half-uncle Jean Hersholt was {{an actor}} {{known for his}} {{portrayal}} of Dr. Christian in a radio series of that name, and the subsequent television series and films. In a 1994 Boston Globe article, Nielsen explained, [...] "I did learn very early <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> would mention my uncle, people {{would look at me}} as if I were the biggest liar in the world. Then I would take them home and show them 8-by-10 glossies, and things changed quite drastically. So I began to think that maybe this acting business was not a bad idea, much as I was very shy about it and certainly without courage regarding it. My uncle died not too long after I {{was in a position to}} know him. I regret that I had not a chance to know him better." ...|$|E

500|$|Jones became {{interested}} in programming in high school, and learned Applesoft BASIC and 6502 Assembly on an Apple II series computer. When Apple released its Macintosh line, Jones's family purchased a Macintosh 128K, but Jones never programmed much for it. After high school Jones got a job programming for a computer-aided design company on PCs, before going to college the next year. In his off time Jones said that all he ever did on the Apple II was write games, [...] "and it seemed logical to continue that on the Mac," [...] he said. [...] "The first thing I did on the Mac was to port a modem game I'd written called Minotaur from 6502 Assembly on the Apple II into MPW C on the Mac. I was still finishing <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> came to college. By that time, I knew I wanted to write games." ...|$|E
500|$|In December 2010, Keri {{confirmed}} a clean {{version of}} the song would be included on her album. Some lyrical modifications were made. The line [...] "I got the kind of pussy that'll keep you out the streets" [...] was replaced by [...] "I got the kind of lovin' that'll keep you out the streets", and the word [...] "fuck" [...] was replaced with the word [...] "thug", while in others it was removed altogether. Ross told Jason Rodriguez of MTV News: [...] "When I got the record, I most definitely {{knew she was going}} to another level and I was excited for [...] I love to see the creative side. She's a sexy female and I think she showed <b>that.</b> <b>When</b> <b>I</b> think of Janet Jackson when I was coming up and she was doing her Control thing, I loved it. So if that's the feeling that young people [...] or whoever is feeling the music, if that's the inspiration they get, I think it's dope." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} of the second season, Bryce Wilson of Cinema Blend commented: [...] "The worst moments of this season are merely uninspired, never truly horrible. Slight misses like “Dancin' Homer”, “One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish”, “Bart's Dog Gets an F”, and “The War of the Simpsons” are a bit flat. But even in their lowest points, humor is easy to find." [...] Jeremy Roebuck of KVUE named this episode, along with [...] "Bart Sells His Soul", [...] "Homer the Heretic", [...] "Simpsons Bible Stories", and [...] "She of Little Faith", one of the best Simpsons episodes with a {{religious}} theme. Dawn Taylor of The DVD Journal thought Homer's line to Bart, [...] "I want to share something with you, the three little sentences that will get you through life. Number one: 'Cover for me.' Number two: 'Oh, good idea, boss.' Number three, 'It was like <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> got here.'", was the best line of the episode.|$|E

500|$|... "During {{many years}} I {{collected}} {{notes on the}} origin or descent of man, without any intention of publishing on the subject, but rather with the determination not to publish, as I thought that I should thus only add to the prejudices against my views. It seemed to me sufficient to indicate, in {{the first edition of}} my 'Origin of Species,' that by this work 'light would be thrown on the origin of man and his history;' and this implies that man must be included with other organic beings in any general conclusion respecting his manner of appearance on this earth." [...] In a preface to the 1874 second edition, he added a reference to the second point: [...] "it has been said by several critics, <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> found that many details of structure in man could not be explained through natural selection, I invented sexual selection; I gave, however, a tolerably clear sketch of this principle in the first edition of the 'Origin of Species,' and I there stated that it was applicable to man." ...|$|E
500|$|Abbott {{first began}} to grow ill in May 1832, when he wrote to Sir Egerton Brydges that [...] "My spirit is so depressed, <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> am not {{strongly}} excited by some present object that admits of no delay, I sink into something very nearly approaching torpidity". Although he got somewhat better, giving his annual dinner to the King's Counsel, it was noticed that {{he was unable to}} drink his wine properly. He went to the Midland Circuit in June, as it was the easiest one, but he suffered from [...] "a violent cough" [...] and other symptoms, returning to his home in Hendon. After the first day of a two-day case he found himself losing his appetite and suffering from a fever, which caused him to talk incoherently and become delirious. The disease baffled doctors, and finally killed him on 4 November 1832 at his home in Queen Square, London; his last words were [...] "and now, gentlemen of the jury, you will consider of your verdict". He was interred at the Foundling Hospital, of which he was a governor.|$|E
500|$|By May, Perot {{was leading}} presidential polls in both Texas and California. The Bush and Clinton campaigns became {{concerned}} about a candidacy, and publicly wondered if Perot could continue to [...] "play by his own rules". They attempted to downgrade Perot from his [...] "folk hero status" [...] {{to that of a}} politician, by highlighting his [...] "alleged character flaws". Meanwhile, Perot focused on sharpening his political positions as he promised. He hired John P. White, who served as a budget official under President Jimmy Carter, to work on his budget platform. Meanwhile, petition drives in every state reported that they had secured enough signatures to place Perot on the Election Day ballot. Speculation arose in the media that Perot would split the electoral college and force the United States House of Representatives to decide the presidency. Around this time, Hal Riney, who had worked on Ronald Reagan's 1984 campaign and was known for the [...] "Morning in America" [...] ad, was hired as advertising consultant. When Riney revealed the cost of advertisements during a meeting, Perot reportedly [...] "flipped out", and asked [...] "Why would I spend <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> could go on the 'Today' show for free?" [...] Riney produced several ads during the campaign that never aired.|$|E

The quality of the material persuaded Kaluta to create the show poster. He became the costume designer after asking what costumes the actors would wear in the poster, and the set designer when the regular one got sick. Kaluta told an interviewer backstage about the evolution of his role: [...] "Should it be like a real 1930s movie poster? <b>That's</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> realized I wanted to do characterizations of the entire cast on the poster. But, I had {{to know what they}} looked like. So <b>that's</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> started designing the costumes. Because I designed them so intricately, I had to build them. And <b>that's</b> <b>when</b> my house started looking like the garment district." ...|$|R
