5|$|After leaving <b>the</b> <b>golf</b> <b>course</b> behind, PA106 makes {{a gradual}} {{turn to the}} {{southeast}} at Crystal Lake Road. There, the highway becomes known as Fall Brook Road, and turns southward through forestry. At the intersection with43rd Street, PA106 enters the city of Carbondale. The route, known now as Fallbrook Street, continues on a southeastern trend, entering a large residential district north of the business district. At the intersection with Dundaff Street, it turns southward again, paralleling a nearby river. At the intersection with River Street, PA106 turns eastward along Salem Avenue, crosses the river and intersects with US 6 Bus. (North Main Street) in Carbondale.

5|$|Intentionally {{set at a}} {{low level}} {{at the time the}} {{cemetery}} and railway opened, in later years the fixed fares offered a very substantial saving over main line tickets to Brookwood (in 1902 the 4s LSWR third class fare to Brookwood was twice the cost of the LNC's equivalent). Additional LNC traffic was generated by golfers disguised as mourners travelling to <b>the</b> <b>golf</b> <b>course</b> which had been built on those parts of the land bought by the LNC in 1852 which had not yet been incorporated into the cemetery. The fixed fares prompted complaints from other London funeral firms after the opening of Woking Crematorium in 1885, as rival undertakers were not given access to the LNC's cheap trains and had to pay the LSWR's cargo rate (24shillings in 1885) to ship a coffin to Brookwood or Woking stations for transfer to the crematorium.|$|E
5|$|The {{golf club}} is Eric Trump's home course. He raises about $3 million {{each year in}} an event there for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.

A few days later, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman was reported to be investigating Eric Trump's foundation and its events at <b>the</b> <b>golf</b> <b>course.</b>|$|E
5|$|In July 1987, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service {{expressed}} concerns that construction near the San Diego River crossing {{might result in}} the destruction of the endangered least Bell's vireo habitat. Two of the four alternative routes considered by Caltrans passed through the Carlton Hills golf course, which the public opposed. In April1988, the Sierra Club denounced the Prospect Avenue route; federal negotiators recommended shifting the route from Hollins Lake towards <b>the</b> <b>golf</b> <b>course.</b> Environmental concerns raised in June1988 related to the least Bell's vireo included decrease of insects, a darker environment after overpasses are constructed, and the fragmenting of habitat. Nevertheless, Caltrans still desired the Prospect Avenue route over concerns of a more expensive and less traveled northern route. Upset because of the delays, the Santee City Council wrote to U.S. senators Pete Wilson and Alan Cranston, asking for their assistance. Councilman Jim Bartell alleged that the issue would affect the city council elections.|$|E
