5|$|In a diamond, each carbon atom is {{surrounded}} by neighboring four carbon atoms forming a <b>tetrahedral</b> shaped unit.|$|E
5|$|Some tetracoordinate nickel(II) {{complexes}}, e.g. bis(triphenylphosphine)nickel chloride, exist both in <b>tetrahedral</b> {{and square}} planar geometries. The <b>tetrahedral</b> complexes are paramagnetic, whereas the square planar complexes are diamagnetic. In having properties of magnetic equilibrium and formation of octahedral complexes, they {{contrast with the}} divalent complexes of the heavier group 10 metals, palladium(II) and platinum(II), which form only square-planar geometry.|$|E
5|$|Boron {{is found}} in nature on Earth entirely as various oxides of B(III), often {{associated}} with other elements. More than one hundred borate minerals contain boron in oxidation state +3. These minerals resemble silicates in some respect, although boron is often found not only in a <b>tetrahedral</b> coordination with oxygen, but also in a trigonal planar configuration. Unlike silicates, the boron minerals never contain boron with coordination number greater than four. A typical motif is exemplified by the tetraborate anions of the common mineral borax, shown at left. The formal negative charge of the <b>tetrahedral</b> borate center is balanced by metal cations in the minerals, such as the sodium (Na+) in borax.|$|E
5|$|Boron trifluoride is planar and {{possesses}} {{an incomplete}} octet. It {{functions as a}} Lewis acid and combines with Lewis bases like ammonia to form adducts. Carbon tetrafluoride is <b>tetrahedral</b> and inert; its group analogues, silicon and germanium tetrafluoride, are also <b>tetrahedral</b> but behave as Lewis acids. The pnictogens form trifluorides that increase in reactivity and basicity with higher molecular weight, although nitrogen trifluoride resists hydrolysis and is not basic. The pentafluorides of phosphorus, arsenic, and antimony are more reactive than their respective trifluorides, with antimony pentafluoride the strongest neutral Lewis acid known.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{its limited}} chemistry, the orthonitrate anion is {{interesting}} from a structural {{point of view}} due to its regular <b>tetrahedral</b> shape and the short N–O bond lengths, implying significant polar character to the bonding.|$|E
5|$|In {{synthetic}} diamond {{grown by}} the high-pressure high-temperature synthesis or chemical vapor deposition, defects with symmetry lower than <b>tetrahedral</b> align to {{the direction of}} the growth. Such alignment has been also been observed in gallium arsenide and thus is not unique to diamond.|$|E
5|$|Many {{vanadium}} oxyhalides (formula VOmXn) are known. The oxytrichloride and oxytrifluoride (VOCl3 and VOF3) are {{the most}} widely studied. Akin to POCl3, they are volatile, adopt <b>tetrahedral</b> structures in the gas phase, and are Lewis acidic.|$|E
5|$|Organic amines {{react with}} TiCl4 to give {{complexes}} containing amido (R2N−-containing) and imido (RN2−-containing) complexes. With ammonia, titanium nitride is formed. An illustrative reaction is {{the synthesis of}} tetrakis(dimethylamido)titanium Ti(NMe2)4, a yellow, benzene-soluble liquid: This molecule is <b>tetrahedral,</b> with planar nitrogen centers.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemistry}} of silicon is generally nonmetallic (covalent) in nature. It {{is not known}} to form a cation. Silicon can form alloys with metals such as iron and copper. It shows fewer tendencies to anionic behaviour than ordinary nonmetals. Its solution chemistry is characterised by the formation of oxyanions. The high strength of the silicon-oxygen bond dominates the chemical behaviour of silicon. Polymeric silicates, built up by <b>tetrahedral</b> SiO4 units sharing their oxygen atoms, are the most abundant and important compounds of silicon. The polymeric borates, comprising linked trigonal and <b>tetrahedral</b> BO3 or BO4 units, are built on similar structural principles. The oxide SiO2 is polymeric in structure, weakly acidic, and a glass former. Traditional organometallic chemistry includes the carbon compounds of silicon (see organosilicon).|$|E
5|$|Tius's allenyl {{substrates}} can exhibit axial to <b>tetrahedral</b> chirality transfer if enantiopure allenes are used. The example below {{generates a}} chiral diosphenpol in 64% yield and 95% enantiomeric excess.|$|E
5|$|Cubes, {{cylinders}} and pimples {{were deployed}} in long rows, often several rows deep, to form anti-tank barriers at beaches and inland. They {{were also used}} in smaller numbers to block roads. They frequently sported loops at the top for the attachment of barbed wire. There was also a <b>tetrahedral</b> or caltrop-shaped obstacle, although it seems these were rare.|$|E
5|$|In an {{analogous}} manner to zirconium and hafnium, rutherfordium {{is projected to}} form a very stable, refractory oxide, RfO2. It reacts with halogens to form tetrahalides, RfX4, which hydrolyze on contact with water to form oxyhalides RfOX2. The tetrahalides are volatile solids existing as monomeric <b>tetrahedral</b> molecules in the vapor phase.|$|E
5|$|It is a {{moderately}} strong Lewis acid, forming adducts with Lewis bases such as triphenylphosphine oxide, e.g. FeCl3(OPPh3)2 where Ph = phenyl. It also reacts with other chloride salts {{to give the}} yellow <b>tetrahedral</b> FeCl4− ion. Salts of FeCl4− in hydrochloric acid can be extracted into diethyl ether.|$|E
5|$|The +4 {{oxidation}} state dominates titanium chemistry, but compounds in the +3 {{oxidation state}} are also common. Commonly, titanium adopts an octahedral coordination geometry in its complexes, but <b>tetrahedral</b> TiCl4 is a notable exception. Because {{of its high}} oxidation state, titanium(IV) compounds exhibit {{a high degree of}} covalent bonding. Unlike most other transition metals, simple aquo Ti(IV) complexes are unknown.|$|E
5|$|The {{second stage}} of {{catalysis}} is {{the resolution of the}} acyl-enzyme intermediate by the attack of a second substrate. If this substrate is water then the result is hydrolysis; if it is an organic molecule then the result is transfer of that molecule onto the first substrate. Attack by this second substrate forms a new <b>tetrahedral</b> intermediate, which resolves by ejecting the enzyme's nucleophile, releasing the second product and regenerating free enzyme.|$|E
5|$|The {{symmetry}} of defects in crystals {{is described by}} the point groups. They differ from the space groups describing the {{symmetry of}} crystals by absence of translations, and thus are much fewer in number. In diamond, only defects of the following symmetries have been observed thus far: <b>tetrahedral</b> (Td), tetragonal (D2d), trigonal (D3d,C3v), rhombic (C2v), monoclinic (C2h, C1h, C2) and triclinic (C1 or CS).|$|E
5|$|This {{chelation}} is {{in contrast}} to the mechanism for formation of the over-addition product wherein collapse of the <b>tetrahedral</b> intermediate allows a second addition. The mechanistic conjecture on the part of Weinreb was immediately accepted by the academic community, {{but it was not until}} 2006 that it was confirmed by spectroscopic and kinetic analyses.|$|E
5|$|Using an even simpler {{approximation}} of the ions as impenetrable hard spheres, {{the arrangement of}} anions in these systems are often related to close-packed arrangements of spheres, with the cations occupying <b>tetrahedral</b> or octahedral interstices. Depending on the stoichiometry of the ionic compound, and the coordination (principally determined by the radius ratio) of cations and anions, a variety of structures are commonly observed, and theoretically rationalized by Pauling's rules.|$|E
5|$|Weinreb and Nahm {{originally}} {{proposed the}} following reaction mechanism {{to explain the}} selectivity shown in reactions of the Weinreb–Nahm amide. Their suggestion was that the <b>tetrahedral</b> intermediate (A below) formed {{as a result of}} nucleophilic acyl substitution by the organometallic reagent is stabilized by chelation from the methoxy group as shown. This intermediate is stable only at low temperatures, requiring a low-temperature quench.|$|E
5|$|Although the heme {{proteins}} are {{the most}} important class of iron-containing proteins, the iron-sulfur proteins are also very important, being involved in electron transfer, which is possible since iron can exist stably in either the +2 or +3 oxidation states. These have one, two, four, or eight iron atoms that are each approximately tetrahedrally coordinated to four sulfur atoms; because of this <b>tetrahedral</b> coordination, they always have high-spin iron. The simplest of such compounds is rubredoxin, which has only one iron atom coordinated to four sulfur atoms from cysteine residues in the surrounding peptide chains. Another important class of iron-sulfur proteins is the ferredoxins, which have multiple iron atoms. Transferrin does not belong to either of these classes.|$|E
5|$|Beryllium nitride, Be3N2 is a {{high-melting-point}} compound {{which is}} readily hydrolyzed. Beryllium azide, BeN6 is known and beryllium phosphide, Be3P2 {{has a similar}} structure to Be3N2. Basic beryllium nitrate and basic beryllium acetate have similar <b>tetrahedral</b> structures with four beryllium atoms coordinated to a central oxide ion. A number of beryllium borides are known, such as Be5B, Be4B, Be2B, BeB2, BeB6 and BeB12. Beryllium carbide, Be2C, is a refractory brick-red compound that reacts with water to give methane. No beryllium silicide has been identified.|$|E
5|$|Catalysis is {{performed}} in two stages. First, the activated nucleophile attacks the carbonyl carbon and forces the carbonyl oxygen {{to accept an}} electron, leading to a <b>tetrahedral</b> intermediate. The build-up of negative charge on this intermediate is typically stabilized by an oxanion hole within the active site. The intermediate then collapses back to a carbonyl, ejecting {{the first half of}} the substrate, but leaving the second half still covalently bound to the enzyme as an acyl-enzyme intermediate. The ejection of this first leaving group is often aided by donation of a proton by the base.|$|E
5|$|Early work on {{the study}} of the {{chemistry}} of rutherfordium focused on gas thermochromatography and measurement of relative deposition temperature adsorption curves. The initial work was carried out at Dubna in an attempt to reaffirm their discovery of the element. Recent work is more reliable regarding the identification of the parent rutherfordium radioisotopes. The isotope 261mRf has been used for these studies. The experiments relied on the expectation that rutherfordium would begin the new 6d series of elements and should therefore form a volatile tetrachloride due to the <b>tetrahedral</b> nature of the molecule. Rutherfordium(IV) chloride is more volatile than its lighter homologue hafnium(IV) chloride (HfCl4) because its bonds are more covalent.|$|E
5|$|In aqueous solution, vanadium(V) {{forms an}} {{extensive}} family of oxyanions. The interrelationships {{in this family}} are described by the predominance diagram, which shows at least 11 species, depending on pH and concentration. The <b>tetrahedral</b> orthovanadate ion, , is the principal species present at pH 12-14. Similar in size and charge to phosphorus(V), vanadium(V) also parallels its chemistry and crystallography. Orthovanadate V is used in protein crystallography to study the biochemistry of phosphate. The tetrathiovanadate 3− {{is analogous to the}} orthovanadate ion.|$|E
5|$|In decavanadate, each V(V) {{center is}} {{surrounded}} by six oxide ligands. Vanadic acid, H3VO4 exists only at very low concentrations because protonation of the <b>tetrahedral</b> species − results in the preferential formation of the octahedral + species. In strongly acidic solutions, pH<2. + is the predominant species, while the oxide V2O5 precipitates from solution at high concentrations. The oxide is formally the inorganic anhydride of vanadic acid. The structures of many vanadate compounds have been determined by X-ray crystallography.|$|E
5|$|Like phosphate, {{phosphoryl}} chloride is <b>tetrahedral</b> in shape. It features three P−Cl {{bonds and}} one strong P=O double bond, {{with an estimated}} bond dissociation energy of 533.5kJ/mol. On the basis of bond length and electronegativity, the Schomaker-Stevenson rule suggests that the double bond form is very dominant (in contrast with POF3). The P=O bond does not utilize the d-orbitals on phosphorus as is commonly described in older textbooks as quantum chemical calculations have shown that d-orbitals {{are not involved in}} main group chemical bonding (see Hypervalent molecule). More modern texts favour a description which involves the donation of the lone pair electrons from oxygen p-orbitals to the antibonding phosphorus-chlorine bonds thus constituting π bonding.|$|E
5|$|Likewise, group theory helps {{predict the}} changes in {{physical}} properties that occur when a material undergoes a phase transition, for example, from a cubic to a <b>tetrahedral</b> crystalline form. An example is ferroelectric materials, where the change from a paraelectric to a ferroelectric state occurs at the Curie temperature and is related to a change from the high-symmetry paraelectric state to the lower symmetry ferroelectric state, accompanied by a so-called soft phonon mode, a vibrational lattice mode that goes to zero frequency at the transition.|$|E
5|$|Protactinium(IV) forms a <b>tetrahedral</b> complex tetrakis({{cyclopentadienyl}})protactinium(IV) (or Pa(C5H5)4) {{with four}} cyclopentadienyl rings, {{which can be}} synthesized by reacting protactinium(IV) chloride with molten Be(C5H5)2. One ring can be substituted with a halide atom. Another organometallic complex is golden-yellow bis(π-cyclooctatetraene) protactinium, or protactinocene, Pa(C8H8)2, which is analogous in structure to uranocene. There, the metal atom is sandwiched between two cyclooctatetraene ligands. Similar to uranocene, it can be prepared by reacting protactinium tetrachloride with dipotassium cyclooctatetraenide, K2C8H8, in tetrahydrofuran.|$|E
5|$|The sporangia (the fern's spore-bearing structures) are borne on the {{underside}} of the leaf beneath the false indusium, a trait found in all members of Adiantum and not in any species outside it. The sori are round, and are found on veins ending in the false indusium, below the veins' ends. The spores are <b>tetrahedral</b> to globose, yellow in color, and measure 41 to 58micrometers(μm) in diameter (averaging 51.4μm), on average larger than other species in the A.pedatum complex. Spores appear in the summer and fall. The species has a chromosome number of 116 in the sporophyte.|$|E
5|$|Alkali metal cations do {{not usually}} form {{coordination}} complexes with simple Lewis bases {{due to their}} low charge of just +1 and their relatively large size; thus the Li+ ion forms most complexes and the heavier alkali metal ions form less and less (though exceptions occur for weak complexes). Lithium in particular has a very rich coordination chemistry in which it exhibits coordination numbers from 1 to 12, although octahedral hexacoordination is its preferred mode. In aqueous solution, the alkali metal ions exist as octahedral hexahydrate complexes (+), {{with the exception of}} the lithium ion, which due to its small size forms <b>tetrahedral</b> tetrahydrate complexes (+); the alkali metals form these complexes because their ions are attracted by electrostatic forces of attraction to the polar water molecules. Because of this, anhydrous salts containing alkali metal cations are often used as desiccants. Alkali metals also readily form complexes with crown ethers (e.g. 12-crown-4 for Li+, 15-crown-5 for Na+, 18-crown-6 for K+, and 21-crown-7 for Rb+) and cryptands due to electrostatic attraction.|$|E
5|$|Most {{bacterial}} {{species are}} either spherical, called cocci (sing. coccus, from Greek kókkos, grain, seed), or rod-shaped, called bacilli (sing. bacillus, from Latin baculus, stick). Elongation {{is associated with}} swimming. Some bacteria, called vibrio, are shaped like slightly curved rods or comma-shaped; others can be spiral-shaped, called spirilla, or tightly coiled, called spirochaetes. A small number of species even have <b>tetrahedral</b> or cuboidal shapes. More recently, some bacteria were discovered deep under Earth's crust that grow as branching filamentous types with a star-shaped cross-section. The large surface {{area to volume ratio}} of this morphology may give these bacteria an advantage in nutrient-poor environments. This wide variety of shapes is determined by the bacterial cell wall and cytoskeleton, and is important because it can influence the ability of bacteria to acquire nutrients, attach to surfaces, swim through liquids and escape predators.|$|E
5|$|The {{second type}} of press design is the cubic press. A cubic press has six anvils which provide {{pressure}} simultaneously onto all faces of a cube-shaped volume. The first multi-anvil press design was a <b>tetrahedral</b> press, using four anvils to converge upon a tetrahedron-shaped volume. The cubic press was created shortly thereafter to increase the volume to which pressure could be applied. A cubic press is typically smaller than a belt press and can more rapidly achieve the pressure and temperature necessary to create synthetic diamond. However, cubic presses cannot be easily scaled up to larger volumes: the pressurized volume can be increased by using larger anvils, but this also increases the amount of force needed on the anvils {{to achieve the same}} pressure. An alternative is to decrease the surface area to volume ratio of the pressurized volume, by using more anvils to converge upon a higher-order platonic solid, such as a dodecahedron. However, such a press would be complex and difficult to manufacture.|$|E
5|$|X-ray {{crystallography}} {{has led to}} {{a better}} understanding of chemical bonds and non-covalent interactions. The initial studies revealed the typical radii of atoms, and confirmed many theoretical models of chemical bonding, such as the <b>tetrahedral</b> bonding of carbon in the diamond structure, the octahedral bonding of metals observed in ammonium hexachloroplatinate (IV), and the resonance observed in the planar carbonate group and in aromatic molecules. Kathleen Lonsdale's 1928 structure of hexamethylbenzene established the hexagonal symmetry of benzene and showed a clear difference in bond length between the aliphatic C–C bonds and aromatic C–C bonds; this finding led to the idea of resonance between chemical bonds, which had profound consequences for the development of chemistry. Her conclusions were anticipated by William Henry Bragg, who published models of naphthalene and anthracene in 1921 based on other molecules, an early form of molecular replacement.|$|E
5|$|A foam is {{a mass of}} bubbles; foams of {{different}} materials occur in nature. Foams composed of soap films obey Plateau's laws, which require three soap films to meet at each edge at 120° and four soap edges to meet at each vertex at the <b>tetrahedral</b> angle of about 109.5°. Plateau's laws further require films to be smooth and continuous, {{and to have a}} constant average curvature at every point. For example, a film may remain nearly flat on average by being curved up in one direction (say, left to right) while being curved downwards in another direction (say, front to back). Structures with minimal surfaces can be used as tents. Lord Kelvin identified the problem of {{the most efficient way to}} pack cells of equal volume as a foam in 1887; his solution uses just one solid, the bitruncated cubic honeycomb with very slightly curved faces to meet Plateau's laws. No better solution was found until 1993 when Denis Weaire and Robert Phelan proposed the Weaire–Phelan structure; the Beijing National Aquatics Center adapted the structure for their outer wall in the 2008 Summer Olympics.|$|E
5|$|Being the {{smallest}} alkali metal, lithium forms the widest variety of and most stable organometallic compounds, which are bonded covalently. Organolithium compounds are electrically non-conducting volatile solids or liquids that melt at low temperatures, {{and tend to}} form oligomers with the structure (RLi)x where R is the organic group. As the electropositive nature of lithium puts most of the charge density of the bond on the carbon atom, effectively creating a carbanion, organolithium compounds are extremely powerful bases and nucleophiles. For use as bases, butyllithiums are often used and are commercially available. An example of an organolithium compound is methyllithium ((CH3Li)x), which exists in tetrameric (x = 4, <b>tetrahedral)</b> and hexameric (x = 6, octahedral) forms. Organolithium compounds, especially n-butyllithium, are useful reagents in organic synthesis, {{as might be expected}} given lithium's diagonal relationship with magnesium, which {{plays an important role in}} the Grignard reaction. For example, alkyllithiums and aryllithiums may be used to synthesise aldehydes and ketones by reaction with metal carbonyls. The reaction with nickel tetracarbonyl, for example, proceeds through an unstable acyl nickel carbonyl complex which then undergoes electrophilic substitution to give the desired aldehyde (using H+ as the electrophile) or ketone (using an alkyl halide) product.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the most}} {{important}} oxidation state for silver in complexes is +1. The Ag+ cation is diamagnetic, like its homologues Cu+ and Au+, as all three have closed-shell electron configurations with no unpaired electrons: its complexes are colourless provided the ligands are not too easily polarized such as I−. Ag+ forms salts with most anions, but it is reluctant to coordinate to oxygen and thus most of these salts are insoluble in water: the exceptions are the nitrate, perchlorate, and fluoride. The tetracoordinate <b>tetrahedral</b> aqueous ion + is known, but the characteristic geometry for the Ag+ cation is 2-coordinate linear. For example, silver chloride dissolves readily in excess aqueous ammonia to form +; silver salts are dissolved in photography due {{to the formation of}} the thiosulfate complex 3−; and cyanide extraction for silver (and gold) works by the formation of the complex −. Silver cyanide forms the linear polymer {Ag–C≡N→Ag–C≡N→}; silver thiocyanate has a similar structure, but forms a zigzag instead because of the sp3-hybridized sulfur atom. Chelating ligands are unable to form linear complexes and thus silver(I) complexes with them tend to form polymers; a few exceptions exist, such as the near-tetrahedral diphosphine and diarsine complexes +.|$|E
