50|$|The {{basketball}} shoes which Irving Watkinson created were canvas high top shoes {{having a}} rubber sole which featured a turkey feather design to aids traction and jumping, a rubber <b>toe</b> <b>guard</b> cap and a ball logo at the ankle ball which provides protection. The design of these basketball shoes {{is the classic}} American image of a sneaker and the essence of Irving Watkinson’s design {{can be seen in}} the styles and brands which followed through the years including, for example, the Converse All-Star first produced in 1917.|$|E
5000|$|In 1923, after Chuck Taylor made {{improvements}} to the shoe, Converse decided to incorporate his name onto the ankle patches that displayed the Converse All Star logo. Then, in the 1930s Taylor's signature was put into the design, which is how the shoe {{became known as the}} [...] "Chuck Taylor" [...] All Star. When first created, the Converse All Star had three main styles—a monochromatic shoe with a black canvas upper and black rubber soles, an all white shoe with blue and red trim, and an all black leather and rubber shoe. It was not until 1949 that Converse decided to make the <b>toe</b> <b>guard,</b> laces and outer wraps white, which gave the appearance of the iconic black and white Converse All Stars of today. In 1957, Converse came out with the low-cut [...] "Oxford" [...] version of the All Star and soon after started to produce the shoes in multiple colors and prints. Today, Converse makes the Chuck Taylor All Star in a variety of colors, styles, prints and fabrics.|$|E

When the desert tanker boots came out, it was not authorized to have steel toe inserts for fear that the crewman may have his toe cut off if too much weight was put on the boot.|$|R
