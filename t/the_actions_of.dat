5|$|In another Buddhist text Majjhima Nikāya, the Buddha criticizes Jain {{emphasis}} on the destruction of unobservable and unverifiable types of karma {{as a means to}} end suffering, rather than on eliminating evil mental states such as greed, hatred and delusion, which are observable and verifiable. In the Upālisutta dialogue of this Majjhima Nikāya text, Buddha contends with a Jain monk who asserts that bodily actions are the most criminal, in comparison to <b>the</b> <b>actions</b> <b>of</b> speech and mind. Buddha criticises this view, saying that <b>the</b> <b>actions</b> <b>of</b> mind are most criminal, and not <b>the</b> <b>actions</b> <b>of</b> speech or body. Buddha also criticises the Jain ascetic practice of various austerities, claiming that he, Buddha, is happier when not practising the austerities.|$|E

5|$|A Sudoku {{will remain}} valid under <b>the</b> <b>actions</b> <b>of</b> the Sudoku {{preserving}} symmetries (see also Jarvis). Some Sudokus are special in that some operations merely {{have the effect}} of relabelling the digits; several of these are listed below.|$|E

5|$|A {{complex set}} of checks and {{balances}} developed between these three branches. For example, the assemblies theoretically held all power, but were called and governed by the magistrates, who, controlling discussion, exercised dominating influence over them. Similarly, to check the power of the magistrates, each magistrate could veto one of their colleagues and the plebeians elected tribunes who could intercede and veto <b>the</b> <b>actions</b> <b>of</b> a magistrate.|$|E

40|$|Fluids exhibit {{deformation}} under <b>the</b> <b>action</b> <b>of</b> forces. If <b>the</b> deformation in {{the material}} increases continually without limit under <b>the</b> <b>action</b> <b>of</b> shearing forces, however small, the material is called a fluid. This continuous deformation under <b>the</b> <b>action</b> <b>of</b> forces compels <b>the</b> fluids to flow and this tendency of fluids is called fluidity...|$|R
5|$|Acamprosate may {{stabilise}} {{the brain}} chemistry that is altered due to alcohol dependence via antagonising <b>the</b> <b>actions</b> <b>of</b> glutamate, a neurotransmitter which is hyperactive in the post-withdrawal phase. By reducing excessive NMDA activity which {{occurs at the}} onset of alcohol withdrawal, acamprosate can reduce or prevent alcohol withdrawal related neurotoxicity. Acamprosate reduces the risk of relapse amongst alcohol dependent persons.|$|E
5|$|Butlins Skegness (officially Butlins Resort Skegness), {{formerly}} Butlin's Skegness or Funcoast World; is {{a holiday}} camp located in Ingoldmells near Skegness in Lincolnshire, England.

5|$|Denial of {{responsibility}} via language that obscures awareness of personal responsibility. It {{is said that}} we deny responsibility for our actions when we attribute their cause to: vague impersonal forces ("I had to"); our condition, diagnosis, personal or psychological history; <b>the</b> <b>actions</b> <b>of</b> others; the dictates of authority; group pressure; institutional policy, rules, and regulations; gender roles, social roles, or age roles; or uncontrollable impulses.|$|E
5|$|Fielding was {{concerned}} with the audience's reaction to his various scenes. This is internally reflected in <b>the</b> <b>actions</b> <b>of</b> the character Merital in Love in Several Masques in controlling the behaviour of Helen and {{that many of his}} characters believe that they are either actors or are performing on a stage. Also, this is a primary concern of Fielding's when he crafted his Scriblerian plays.|$|E
