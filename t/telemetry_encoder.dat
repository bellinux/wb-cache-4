Also, the encoder is required to make a data frame composed of digital input signals and frame synchronous data. The framed data is supplied to the input of a transmitter. There are three critical considerations in developing a PCM <b>telemetry</b> <b>encoder</b> to be installed in an artillery projectile. The first is the performance consideration, such as sampling rate, data receiving rate and data transmission rate. The second is the size consideration due to the severely limited installation space in an artillery projectile and the last is the power consumption consideration due to limitations of the munition’s power supply. To meet these three considerations, the best alternative is a one-chip solution. Using a commercially available TMS 320 F 2812 DSP chip, we have implemented a 30 -channel PCM <b>telemetry</b> <b>encoder</b> to process randomized data frames, composed of 16 -channel analog data, 14 -channel digital data and 2 frame synchronization data per data frame, at 10 Mbps transmission baud rate. This paper describes {{the structure of the}} 30 -channel PCM <b>telemetry</b> <b>encoder</b> and its performance...|$|E

Addressing these power supply requirements efficiently requires switching power supply topologies that if left unchecked can generate high input surge currents and high levels of detrimental noise for both the sensitive analog signal processing circuitry and the power supply input source. This paper focuses on the design considerations and tradeoffs associated with implementing an efficient <b>telemetry</b> <b>encoder</b> power supply while mitigating the resulting noise effects typically associated with switching power supplies. This noise can negatively affect the power supply input source and the linear signal processing circuitry within the <b>telemetry</b> <b>encoder...</b>|$|E

H. 264 /AVC is the most modern and bandwidth-efficient compression algorithm specified for video recording in the Digital Recording IRIG Standard 106 - 11, Chapter 10. This bandwidth efficiency is largely derived from the inter-frame compression component of the standard. Motion JPEG- 2000 compression is often considered for cockpit display recording, due to the concern that details in the symbols and graphics suffer excessively from artifacts of inter-frame compression and that critical information might be lost. In this paper, we report on a quantitative comparison of H. 264 /AVC and Motion JPEG- 2000 encoding for HD video <b>telemetry.</b> Actual <b>encoder</b> implementations in video recorder products are used for the comparison...|$|R

An Adaptive Telemetry System {{is defined}} as a flexible, {{controllable}} pulse code modulation (PCM) telemetry system which offers many options and many modes of operation prior to and during actual test of a monitored system. The concept of having a telemetry system adapt to the data and circumstances of the test is not new. Large data-gathering systems using computers for control have pioneered this concept. However, the present development activity has centered on a small aerospace memory controlled PCM encoder which can function as the keystone of an adaptive <b>telemetry</b> system.

The test results are all within the specifications and it could be demonstrated that the high regulation requirements for high voltage power supplies of traveling wave tube amplifiers can be achieved with 'state of the art' parts (Digital Signal Processor, A/D Converter, etc.). The configuration and control of such a digital electronic power conditioner was realized via a serial Interface which allows a significant reduction on the system side (harness, <b>telemetry</b> and telecommand <b>encoder),</b> optimized test procedures/sequences and a simple adaptation to different system requirements if necessary even in orbit.

40|$|Context: 7 million athletes {{participate}} {{in high school}} sports annually. Approximately 1 million of these athletes {{participate in}} football, which is associated with repetitive head impacts. Concussion literature suggests sub-concussive impacts may lead to declines in brain function across a season of football. Furthermore, recent research suggests following clinical concussion recovery, metabolic and neurophysiological recovery may not be complete. Objective: The {{purpose of this study}} was to monitor head impacts and cognitive function during (72 hour, asymptomatic) and after concussion and longer term over a full football season (pre-season, mid-season, post-season). Participants: 106 male adolescent (46 football-athletes, 42 controls for football-athletes, 9 concussed-athletes, 9 controls for concussed-athletes). Outcome measures: The Head Impact <b>Telemetry</b> System <b>encoder</b> was used to track the location and magnitude of head impacts during football participation. Psychophysiology was measured using Electroencephalography and was quantified using a 256 channel system to record brain activity during an auditory oddball task. All Participants completed Axon neurocognitive testing, clinical reaction time task (CRT), symptom inventory and two Health Related Quality of Life Surveys (Health Behavior Inventory, Satisfaction with Life) throughout the above testing time-points. Results: Football-athletes sustained a mean of 482 head impacts during all practices and games. Mixed measures ANOVA indicated a significant decrement on one BNA output score, Target amplitude, with lower post-season scores (p 0. 05). Furthermore, P 3 a amplitudes were significantly larger and N 2 latency was longer during post-season testing. Mixed measured ANOVAs indicated no significant deficits in BNA output scores, Axon performance, CRT, and HRQOL, for concussed and matched controls across post-injury time points. Additionally, there was a significantly longer P 3 a latency post-season latencies across groups and smaller P 3 a amplitudes at post-season for concussed compared to controls (p< 0. 05). Conclusion: Overall, these findings suggest electrophysiology changes between pre and post-season testing among football athletes and control participants without concussion, with the majority demonstrating improved cognitive function. Therefore, no negative effects may be associated with repeated head impacts in one season of football. Furthermore, no cognitive deficits were present during asymptomatic testing following concussion...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays {{it is very}} {{important}} in different fields the sensor data collection in for a continuous study and control of the environmental conditions. The interest of this project is based on that fact. This document contains the development and design of an aquatic remote operated vehicle (ROV) so that it can collect data from sensors installed in an environmental station. The ROV's function is to collect this data performing a path through different nodes through the water. This ROV is an aquatic hovercraft, it has not a motor underwater, and it has it over the platform with a propeller that creates thrust with the air. On the other hand, it has two rudders that can deviate the airflow of the propeller to realize the maneuvers. The size of the ROV is about 55 cm of length, 35 cm width and 30 cm height. The brain of this vehicle is the Pixhawk controller that has a large equipment of <b>telemetry,</b> GPS, PPM <b>encoder,</b> etc. It has equipped an onboard Arduino UNO which is the responsible of the actuation of the brushed motor and responsible of the data management and data logger of the sensors. The ROV receives the data from nodes and it transmits it to a central equipment which is monitoring the ROV continuously and where the measured data is desired to be at. Manual navigation will be executed through a transmitter of 2. 4 GHz model FS-G 2 E, which has a range of 250 meters and has two channels for actuation: power and heading. For the link between the ROV and a node it is used the bluetooth technology that is offered by the module RN- 41. It can be programmed easily with an Arduino. The data that is transmitted is humidity and temperature and it has the format {xx. x;yy. y}. In addition, it is implemented a meteorology station on a node in order to realize real measurements of the environmental conditions and so that the system works with real values. Finally, on the annexes it is possible to see the plans for the construction of the ROV and the station. Otherwise, there are the specifications of different modules that are used through this project...|$|R

This is done by a case study in which a model of a Packet <b>Telemetry</b> <b>Encoder</b> system is developed. The report includes a brief overview of various graphical modeling languages. The case study illustrates how the SysML provides system engineers with a robust modeling language. SysML is an extension to UML (unified modeling language) which is widely used by software engineers. The extension to the UML profile includes requirements modeling, parametric modeling, allocation and extension to structural and activity modeling. These extensions of the UML language are known as the SysML Profile. SysML is a representation of domain-specific engineering analysis models and the great advantage of applying the language is providing a single model to capture requirements, system elements and the relationship between these model elements. This capability of SysML is satisfying the traceability of requirements which is required in every stage during the system development life cycle.
