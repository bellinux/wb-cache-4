5000|$|Unlike {{equivalency}} frames, emphasis frames offer [...] "qualitatively different yet potentially relevant considerations" [...] {{which individuals}} {{use to make}} judgments.

5|$|The Senate later acquitted Clinton on both charges. The Senate {{refused to}} meet <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>an</b> {{impeachment}} trial {{before the end of}} the old term, so the trial was held over until the next Congress. Clinton was represented by Washington law firm Williams & Connolly. The Senate finished a twenty-one-day trial on February 12, 1999, with the vote of 55 Not Guilty/45 Guilty on the perjury charge and 50 Not Guilty/50 Guilty on the obstruction of justice charge. Both votes fell short of the Constitutional two-thirds majority requirement to convict and remove an officeholder. The final vote was generally along party lines, with no Democrats voting guilty, and only a handful of Republicans voting not guilty.|$|E
5|$|The idea <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>an</b> inter-continental {{sporting}} event between Asia and Africa was initiated in April 1983, with New Delhi as the proposed venue.

In 1989, the proposal was reconsidered, with New Delhi again chosen as the venue for the Games. The Games were then scheduled for 1991. The plans went wrong due to inefficient communication between the members, and so could not come into force.|$|E

5|$|The rebels sent envoys to the voivode {{to inform}} him about their grievances, but the envoys were {{captured}} and executed. The voivode invaded the rebels' camp, but the peasants resisted {{and made a}} successful counter-attack, killing many noblemen during the battle. To prevent the rebels from continuing the war, the bishop {{and the leaders of}} the noblemen started negotiations with the rebels' envoys. Their compromise was recorded in the Kolozsmonostor Abbey on 6 July. The agreement reduced the tithe by half, abolished the ninth (a seigneurial tax), guaranteed the peasants' right to free movement and authorized them <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>an</b> annual assembly to secure the execution of the agreement.|$|E

Mackenzie King decided to wait <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>an</b> election. On 1 September, Germany invaded Poland. Mackenzie King recalled Parliament into session beginning 7 September, and Canada declared war on Germany.

5|$|A {{declaration}} is only {{as effective}} as the willingness of a public body to abide by the court's statement of the law in it, as it is not a contempt of court to ignore a declaration. In Webster v. Southwark London Borough Council (1982), Webster was a parliamentary candidate for the National Front, a far right racial nationalist political party, who wanted <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>an</b> election meeting in a hall owned by Southwark London Borough Council. Despite being required by provisions of the Representation of the People Act 1949 to permit Webster to use the hall, the local council refused to do so as it did not agree with Webster's political views. The court made a declaration that Webster was legally entitled to use the hall at a certain time for the purpose of his election campaign, {{on the assumption that the}} local council would obey it. Nonetheless, the local council still refused to allow Webster use of the hall. It was held that a declaration is not a coercive order of the court and, accordingly, refusal to comply with it is not contempt.|$|E
