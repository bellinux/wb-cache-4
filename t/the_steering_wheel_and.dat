25|$|Jacob Drucker and Irving Cohen {{were put}} on trial {{separately}} {{for the murder of}} racketeer Walter Sage in the Catskills. Sage was killed with an ice pick and had the frame of a slot machine tied to his body, which was found in Swan Lake on July 31, 1937. After the Sage murder, believing he was also going to be killed, Cohen fled to California and managed to secure small roles in films. According to the chief prosecution witness, Abraham Levine, Sage was riding in a car with Cohen and Drucker when he was stabbed 32 times with an icepick as Levine and Harry Strauss were following in another car. During the assault and struggle, Drucker stabbed Cohen once in the arm as Sage had grabbed <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>and</b> wrecked the car. Levine also testified that he observed Drucker wiping the icepick clean before helping dispose of the body. Cohen testified in his own defense, stating that Levine had stabbed him with an icepick as he was walking home from a casino. Cohen stated that he was assaulted by Levine and another man on Drucker's orders since he refused to pay 25% profit on a game of chance that he operated. Cohen was acquitted on June 21, 1940. Drucker, who was a suspect in four murders in the Catskills, was a fugitive for over three years, until the FBI located him in Delaware. Drucker was convicted of second-degree murder on May 5, 1944, and received a sentence of 25 years to life. Drucker died in Attica prison in January 1962.|$|E
500|$|There {{were some}} improvised scenes. These {{included}} {{a scene in}} the beginning of the episode where Alan and Joanna are in a middle of a field and the scene begins with a low-angle shot. Later, when Alan is [...] "humping" [...] Joanna, the scene suddenly becomes a crane shot. This is because the crew at the time had a crane camera after they had finished filming the final scenes in series 2 where Alan, Joanna and Martin are teetering over the edge of a cliff in the stolen camper van. The camper van scenes were the hardest to shoot, especially the scene where the van explodes, as this had to be done in one take. Another problem was the smell of the van, which Pippa Haywood said, [...] "smelt of old dogs." [...] The van also suffered other problems such as bits of <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>and</b> gear stick coming off. Julian Rhind-Tutt commented that the scene where Alan and Boyce talk together for the last time was one of the most moving scenes in the whole of Green Wing. The wedding was shot at Hall of Bayham Abbey in Kent, where the crew had difficulty filming due to bad weather. The show also features a guest appearance from Jeremy Sheffield near the end of the episode as Sue's new boyfriend.|$|E

[...] The ignition switch was moved from the instrument panel to the steering column, and locked <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>and</b> selector lever when the key was removed (a security feature which became mandatory for the 1970 model year). [...] Chrome side trim was revised, as well. At the rear, the reverse lights moved from the rear bumper to new three-section tail-light lenses. Sales for 1969 improved again, to 52,872.|$|E

2500|$|To commemorate its {{passing the}} Ford Model T's record sales mark and its {{victories}} in the Baja 1000 Mexican races from 1967 to 1971, Volkswagen produced its first limited-edition Beetle. It was marketed as the [...] "Baja Champion SE" [...] in the United States and the [...] "Marathon" [...] Superbeetle {{in the rest of}} the world. It featured unique [...] "Marathon Blau" [...] metallic blue paint, steel-pressed 10-spoke 15-inch (38cm) magnesium-alloy wheels, a commemorative metal plate mounted on the glovebox and a certificate of authenticity presented to the original purchaser. Dealer-installed options for this limited-edition Superbeetle included the following: white stripes running the length of the rocker-panel, a special shifter knob, bumper overriders, tapered exhaust tips, fake walnut inserts in the dashboard (behind <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>and</b> the glovebox cover) as well as Bosch fog lights mounted on the front bumper.|$|E
2500|$|In 1898, Louis Renault had a De Dion-Bouton modified, with fixed {{drive shaft}} and differential, making [...] "perhaps the first hot rod in history" [...] and {{bringing}} Renault {{and his brothers}} into the car industry. Innovation was rapid and rampant, with no clear standards for basic vehicle architectures, body styles, construction materials, or controls, for example many veteran cars use a tiller, rather than a wheel for steering. During 1903, Rambler standardized on <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>and</b> moved the driver's position to the left-hand side of the vehicle. Chain drive was dominant over the drive shaft, and closed bodies were extremely rare. Drum brakes were introduced by Renault in 1902. The next year, Dutch designer Jacobus Spijker built the first four-wheel drive racing car; it never competed {{and it would be}} 1965 and the Jensen FF before four-wheel drive was used on a production car.|$|E
2500|$|Interiors on the Torino {{were all}} new for 1970. The {{dashboard}} featured a linear style speedometer {{centered on the}} driver, and a new [...] "ribbon" [...] style tachometer was an option for V8 models. A temperature gauge was the only available gauge; oil pressure and electrics were monitored with warning lights only. High back bucket seats were available for all 2-door models, as was an optional console; the GT model {{no longer had the}} former as standard features. All 2-door hardtop, SportsRoof and convertible models featured [...] "DirectAire" [...] ventilation systems as a standard feature, which eliminated the need for side vent windows. The 2-door sedan, 4-doors and station wagons still had vent windows, and the [...] "DirectAire" [...] system was an option for these models. [...] The ignition switch was moved from the instrument panel to the steering column, in compliance with Federal regulations.

2500|$|On 20 October 1992, Harvey {{was killed}} when her car veered to {{the wrong side of}} the road and hit an {{oncoming}} car directly. Bryant was inside the vehicle at the time of the accident, and was hospitalised for seven months with severe neck and back injuries. He was briefly investigated by police for the role he played in the accident, as Bryant had a known habit of lunging for <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>and</b> Harvey had already had three accidents as a result. She often told people that this was the reason she never drove faster than 60 kilometres an hour (37mph). Bryant was named the sole beneficiary of Harvey's will and came into possession of assets totalling more than $550,000. As Bryant had only the [...] "vaguest notions" [...] of financial matters, his mother subsequently applied for and was granted a guardianship order, placing Bryant's assets under the management of Public Trustees. The order was based on evidence of Bryant's diminished intellectual capacity.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most notable}} {{revision}} is {{the return of}} the Type-S edition of the TL.

The Manual transmission includes a Limited Slip Differential. Exterior differences include quad exhaust pipes, restyled rear lamps and front fascia, lip spoiler, wider side sills, Brembo brakes, dark silver 10-spoke wheels, a [...] "black chrome" [...] grille rather than the standard glossy grille, and exclusive Type-S badging, plus an exclusive new color option, Kinetic Blue Pearl. The interior has Type-S badging on <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>and</b> headrests, more highly bolstered front seats, two-tone seats (only with the Ebony/Silver interior), metal racing pedals, carbon fiber trim, and red interior lighting (as opposed to blue in the base TL). Touch screen navigation is standard and the suspension has been firmed up. The only options are the aforementioned transmission and high performance summer tires (Bridgestone Potenzas) rather than the standard all-season tires (Michelin Pilot MXM4s).|$|E

2500|$|Buses and streetcars use the Communications and Information System (CIS). This system employs {{transmit}} facilities {{throughout the}} city. Each bus and streetcar has a Transit Radio Unified Microprocessor (TRUMP) set on board. This {{is attached to}} a transponder receiver, which allows CIS operators to track the location of the vehicle using an older computational system known as dead reckoning. The TRUMP also allows the operators and CIS operators to send and receive text messages for such things as short turns and route adjustments. There is also the option of voice communications between the operator and the CIS operator. The CIS was conceived in the late 1970s and was fully implemented in 1991. With the introduction of the NextBus GPS technology, the CIS positioning system is now using a combination of GPS data and the old dead reckoning sign-post system. In the event that internally managed TTC communications are unavailable, the TRUMP unit operates on Bell Mobility's CDMA network to communicate with divisional operations and transit control. Recently, the TTC began research into transitioning from the outdated and antiquated CIS to a newer computer aided dispatch (CAD/AVL) system. Utilizing this technology would help improve headways, provide more reliable communications and allow divisional supervisors to locate vehicles in real time (the current GPS system only sends location updates every 20 seconds). There is no current estimate of when this technology is to be implemented. Each TRUMP unit on every streetcar and bus is equipped with a silent [...] "yellow alarm" [...] key which can be activated by the operator {{in the event of an}} emergency on board. When activated, CIS supervisors and transit control dispatchers are able to hear what is going on via a high-quality boom microphone located in front of <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>and</b> dispatch emergency responders. There is also a [...] "red alarm" [...] key, which enables one way communication with CIS once pressed. This can be used in events such as fires when immediate assistance is required and two-way voice communication would prove detrimental to safety.|$|E
