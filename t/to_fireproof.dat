5|$|Strickland did {{not take}} into account the swampy lowland and high water table that characterizes the terrain around New Orleans, and so during its career the New Orleans Mint {{building}} has encountered numerous structural problems from the shifting soil beneath its foundation. In the 1840s the building was reinforced with iron rods inserted between the floors. In 1854, the federal government hired West Point engineering graduate (and Louisiana native) Pierre Gustave Toutant Beauregard <b>to</b> <b>fireproof</b> the building, rebuild the arches supporting the basement ceiling and install masonry flooring. Beauregard completed the work in conjunction with Captain Johnson K. Duncan by 1859. During this period, the Mint's heavy machinery was converted to steam power so a smokestack (since demolished) was built at the rear of the structure to carry away the fumes.|$|E

25|$|The use of {{the term}} iron curtain as a metaphor for strict {{separation}} goes back {{at least as far as}} the early 19th century. It originally referred <b>to</b> <b>fireproof</b> curtains in theaters. Although its popularity as a Cold War symbol is attributed to its use in a speech Winston Churchill gave in March 1946 in Fulton, Missouri, German Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels had already used the term in reference to the Soviet Union.|$|E
50|$|Encasement has {{significant}} benefits {{in almost every}} application, and can be applied <b>to</b> <b>fireproofing,</b> asbestos-containing paint, plaster, block etc. If the building has a 5-10yr life span remaining, or more, encasement offers major benefits. And for due diligence purposes encased areas should be inspected regularly as one would inspect other building components {{as part of a}} regular inspection cycle.|$|R

25|$|In {{addition}} to increasing diversity of landscapes, broadcast burning can militate against catastrophic wildfires. Forest fires gained a negative connotation because of cultural references to uncontrolled fires that take lives and destroy homes and properties. Controlled burns can decrease {{the risk of}} wildfires through the regular burning of undergrowth that would otherwise fuel rampant burning. Broadcast burning has helped <b>to</b> <b>fireproof</b> landscapes by burning off undergrowth and using up potential fuel, leaving little or no chance for a wildfire to be sparked by lightning.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} design had {{a complex of}} hipped roofs and an open belfry atop the tower. In 1927 fire destroyed the tower and severely damaged the roof. A team of architects who supervised the rebuilding changed the design to its current appearance. They also initiated major work on the interior, intended <b>to</b> <b>fireproof</b> the building. Much of this consisted of replacing structural wood with other materials. Wood flooring was replaced with terrazzo, staircases with marble, and doors were clad in metal. The chimneys were capped.|$|E
25|$|In June 1962, the hotel's opening {{was delayed}} until October 1, 1962. Simultaneously, county {{officials}} {{discovered that the}} three-story stucco hotel may be in violation of fire codes. A request was made for the owner to propose plans <b>to</b> <b>fireproof</b> the hotel's wooden roof and attic. County officials suggested the installation of either a sprinkler system or sheet rock in the attic, {{as well as the}} addition of fire-proof materials {{on the roof of the}} hotel structures. In November 1962, key positions in the resort were being named while an opening date of Christmas week was being planned.|$|E

50|$|Asbestos is {{a mineral}} which was {{extensively}} {{used in the}} United States <b>to</b> <b>fireproof</b> buildings and textiles, among other items, in the 1950s-1980s. Workers are frequently exposed to asbestos during demolition and renovation work, which can cause asbestosis and/or mesothelioma. Asbestos exposure can also cause pleural effusion, diffuse pleural fibrosis, pleural plaques, and non-mesothelioma lung cancer. Smoking greatly increases the lung cancer risk of asbestos exposure.|$|E
50|$|Prior to the 1970s, all Navy {{warships}} required asbestos {{materials for}} insulation. USS Corry had asbestos material {{installed in the}} ship’s boilers and engineering compartments in order <b>to</b> <b>fireproof</b> the vessel. This material is incredibly heat resistant and cheap, making it an economical and desirable shipbuilding material for gaskets, valves, adhesives, etc. This put everyone on board at risk of harmful exposure due to poor ventilation as well as exposure from deck/engine work.|$|E
