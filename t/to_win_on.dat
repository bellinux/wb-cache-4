5|$|Leicester {{made their}} UEFA Champions League {{debut in the}} 2016–17 season, their fourth {{appearance}} in European football. The club became the third English team <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>on</b> their Champions League debut, after Manchester United in 1994 and Newcastle United in 1997. They are also the first English team to win away on their Champions League debut, and win all three of their opening games in the competition. They are the first team in Champions League history to keep clean sheets in each of their opening four games in the competition.|$|E
5|$|Bird's feature race {{victory was}} his—and Russian Time's—second {{of the season}} and Coletti's sprint race win meant he became the first Monegasque driver <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>on</b> the streets of Monaco since Louis Chiron in 1931. The race results {{resulted}} in Coletti increasing his lead {{at the top of the}} Drivers' Championship to 24 points ahead of Felipe Nasr. Bird's feature race win meant he gained two positions to move into third while Leimer dropped to fourth. Rapax took over the lead of the Teams' Championship from Carlin and Russian Time's strong results enabled the company to take over third place. Racing Engineering rounded out the top four with seven rounds left in the season.|$|E
5|$|In the 2001–02 season, Horsfield {{was chosen}} Player of the Year both by Birmingham's fans {{and by his}} team-mates. His strike {{partnership}} with Stern John proved crucial in the unbeaten run which helped Birmingham reach the First Division play-offs, and he scored the equaliser against Norwich City in the play-off final, which the club went on <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>on</b> penalties to earn promotion to the Premier League. Horsfield had promised a donation to his first club, Athersley Rec, if he ever reached the Premiership; {{a few days after}} the play-off victory he gave them £25,000 towards improving their facilities.|$|E

5|$|Ipswich {{made only}} one major signing during the off-season, buying Hermann Hreiðarsson from Wimbledon F.C. for a club record £4m {{two days before}} the season commenced. Television pundits Rodney Marsh and Mark Lawrenson both agreed relegation would be the obvious outcome. Ipswich {{surprised}} the doubters; they sustained a high league position and narrowly missed out on qualification for the UEFA Champions League, when the team failed <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>on</b> {{the last day of the}} season against Derby County. The fifth-place finish gained the club a UEFA Cup place and earned George Burley the title of FA Premier League Manager of the Year, an award that until 2010 had, in every other season, been given to the manager of the Premier League champions.|$|E
5|$|The feud between Kenny Dykstra and Ric Flair continued. As {{a reward}} for {{defeating}} Flair at New Year's Revolution, Coachman booked Dykstra in a match with Hardy for his WWE Intercontinental Championship. Flair interfered and performed a low blow to Dykstra, allowing Hardy <b>to</b> <b>win.</b> <b>On</b> the following Raw, Flair defeated Dykstra in a rematch, ending their rivalry. The feuds between Carlito and Chris Masters, and Mickie James and Victoria also ended after Carlito and James won subsequent rematches, {{and they began to}} feud with Ric Flair and Melina respectively. The match between Donald Trump and Rosie O'Donnell was actually a parody match, with talent from WWE's developmental territories portraying the characters. This was the early stage of a major feud between Donald Trump and Vince McMahon, which would go on to WrestleMania.|$|E
5|$|The finish to {{the main}} event and the segment after the Last Man Standing match led to several matches and {{segments}} following Hard Justice. Sting was announced at No Surrender to be the challenger for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship at TNA's Bound for Glory IV PPV event on October12. Sting ended up defeating Joe for the title at the event due to Nash betraying and hitting Joe with a baseball bat. Styles went on to challenge Sting at TNA's Turning Point and Final Resolution PPV events for the title, failing <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>on</b> both occasions. These matches {{were part of a}} storyline between veterans wrestlers, which made up The Main Event Mafia, and younger wrestlers, called The TNA Front Line, in TNA. Meanwhile, the finish of the main event led to the return of Jeff Jarrett at No Surrender, when he aided Joe in retaining the TNA World Heavyweight Championship by hitting Angle with a guitar.|$|E

5|$|After {{almost three}} years in the wilderness, Fingleton {{returned}} to the Test arena in the First Test at Durban. After making two in the first innings, he was unbeaten on 36 when Australia reached their second innings target with nine wickets in hand. During the first innings, a 140km/h gale hit the ground, uprooting trees and forcing balls that were heading into the wind to do U-turns. He followed this with 62—the innings top-score—and 40 in the Second Test at Johannesburg. After taking a 93-run first innings lead, Australia needed a Test record of 399 in the second innings <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>on</b> a turning wicket, and after the early demise of Brown, Fingleton joined McCabe in a 177-run partnership that pushed the score to 1/194. Such was the dominance of McCabe that he scored more than 80% of the runs during this partnership. Australia needed only 125 with half the day remaining and eight wickets in hand when poor visibility ended play. McCabe had flayed the attack and reached 189 not out when the South Africans had the match called off, claiming that the fieldsmen were endangered by the batsman's vigorous hitting.|$|E
5|$|In late January 2017, it was {{announced}} that WIN and Southern Cross Austereo had commenced negotiations over the sale of SCA's Ten affiliate station NRN in Northern NSW in exchange for WIN's Wollongong radio station i98FM. This deal would have given SCA access to the Wollongong radio market and allowed WIN to expand into the Northern NSW market for the first time, giving it coverage across all regional eastern Australian markets. Southern Cross later withdrew from negotiations on 20 February 2017 with no explanation given. However, WIN and Southern Cross later finalised an agreement on 28 March 2017 where they would sell NRN to WIN for a total of $55 million, with the sale taking effect on 31 May 2017. NRN was maintained as Ten Northern NSW until playout and transmission are transferred <b>to</b> <b>WIN</b> <b>on</b> 1 September 2017, at that point the station adopted the WIN branding. The channel numbers will also be reshuffled to align with WIN's other stations, but as Nine-owned NBN Television holds the 8-numbered digital channels in northern NSW, NRN's digital channels will remain on the 5-numbered digital channels.|$|E
5|$|Maryse began a {{rivalry with}} Michelle McCool in September 2008, {{challenging}} {{her for the}} WWE Divas Championship at Unforgiven, and in a rematch the following week on SmackDown, but failed <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>on</b> both occasions. On the September 23 episode of ECW, Maryse defeated McCool in a non-title match. After a month-long absence, Maryse returned at Survivor Series pay-per-view event in November, participating in a five-on-five Divas elimination tag team match, eliminating Kelly Kelly, Mickie James and Candice Michelle; Maryse was the sole survivor of her team, but was ultimately eliminated by Beth Phoenix. At the Armageddon pay-per-view on December 14, Maryse teamed up with Jillian Hall, Victoria and Natalya in a losing effort to McCool, Maria, Kelly Kelly and Mickie James in an Eight-Diva Santa's Little Helper tag team match. On December 19, Maryse pinned Maria to become the number one contender for Michelle McCool's Divas Championship. The following week on SmackDown, Maryse defeated McCool, with Maria as the special guest referee, to win her first Divas Championship. On December 28, at a house show in Raleigh, North Carolina, Maryse dislocated her knee in a tag team match against The Bella Twins (Nikki and Brie). It was later announced that the injury was not major, and therefore only missed a few weeks action. On the January 23, 2009 episode of SmackDown, Maryse returned and sat at ringside commentating during a Divas' tag team match. She returned to in-ring action on February 20, teaming with Michelle McCool in a win against Maria and Eve Torres, where she pinned Torres.|$|E

Juba called for reform of the province's liquor laws during this campaign.|$|R
5|$|This was {{followed}} by a low scoring Second Test in Sydney when Australia were 4/77 needing 223 <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>on</b> a poor wicket against the lethal pace of Frank Tyson and Brian Statham. The express Tyson was bowling with the help of tailwind and the slips cordon were over 50m behind the bat. Harvey stood firm while Tyson scattered the stumps of his partners, and he farmed the strike ruthlessly, protecting the tailenders and counter-attacking the England fast bowlers, relying on the cut shot and clipping anything on his pads through the leg side. Schoolboys watching the game leaned over the fence to beckon the boundaries towards them. Last man Bill Johnston came in at 9/145 with 78 runs still required, but protected by Harvey he only had to face 16 balls in 40 minutes and they almost produced an unlikely Australian victory. Harvey continued to attack the bowling, and he hooked Tyson over fine leg's head for four. Together, Harvey and Johnston they had added 39 for the last wicket and halved the runs required. At this point, the Australian pair were confident. Harvey and Johnston felt that Tyson was about to run out of energy, and that their prospects would improve when Hutton would have been forced to change bowlers in the near future. However, it was not enough and England won by 38 runs when Johnston gloved a Tyson delivery down the leg side to the wicket-keeper. Harvey had played what many observers thought was the greatest innings of his life, a defiant, unbeaten 92, exactly half of the Australian innings of 184 in which no other batsmen reached 15.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} Test, Jardine scored 35 and 65 not out. His first innings began with England in an {{uncertain}} position, having lost three wickets for 108 {{on a very}} good batting wicket. His innings led England to a stronger position. He played very cautiously, being troubled by Clarrie Grimmett and Bert Ironmonger, the Australian spinners. Jardine believed that Ironmonger threw the ball, and this bowler gave him considerable trouble throughout his career. Thanks to the bowling of Harold Larwood, England took a huge first innings lead. In his second innings, although he played well in his 65, Jardine was not under much pressure. He scored {{a large number of}} singles, giving his partners most of the bowling and building up the lead to the point where England achieved a massive victory by 675 runs. This victory surprised and troubled the Australian cricketing public. Jardine played a similar role in the second Test, batting with Wally Hammond to retrieve a poor start for England in his only innings as they won by eight wickets. Jardine scored 62 in the third Test, supporting Hammond who made a double century. However, when Australia batted a second time, they built up a big lead and left England needing 332 <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>on</b> an exceptionally bad wicket which had been damaged by rain. Jack Hobbs and Herbert Sutcliffe, in one of their most famous partnerships, put on 105. Hobbs sent a message to the team that Jardine should be the next batsmen to come in, even though he usually batted later on, as he was the batsman most likely to survive in the conditions. When Hobbs was dismissed, Jardine came in to bat. He survived, although finding batting exceptionally difficult, until the day's play ended. Percy Fender believed that Jardine was the only batsman in the side who could have coped with the difficult conditions. He went on to make 33 next day, and England won by three wickets.|$|E
