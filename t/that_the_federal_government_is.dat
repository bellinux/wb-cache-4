2500|$|Though Marshall {{rejected}} the 10th amendment's provision of states rights {{arguing that it}} did not include the word [...] "expressly" [...] unlike the Articles of Confederation, which was replaced by the Constitution, controversy over the authority of the amendment being violated by the decision has existed. Compact theory also argues <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>is</b> a creation of the states where the states maintain superiority. Unlike Marshall, his successor, Roger B. Taney, established Dual federalism, where separate but equal branches of government were believed to be a better option.|$|E
2500|$|Lawmakers {{in about}} a half-dozen states have adopted resolutions which assert that states have {{sovereignty}} over federal land within states. Legal scholar Rob Natelson, formerly of the University of Montana, has argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>is</b> required to dispose of public land within states, with few exceptions. However, these claims have been repeatedly rejected by federal courts, citing the Property Clause's clear grant of power to Congress to manage federal property, including land. Citing the 1840 Supreme Court case, United States v. Gratiot, which ruled that [...] "the power over the public lands is vested in Congress by the Constitution, without limitation," [...] Yale University legal scholar Raph Graybill wrote that [...] "the Constitution grants the United States exclusive legal control over American public lands." [...] University of Utah law professor Robert Keiter argued that legal efforts to demand transfer of federal public lands were not only futile {{as a matter of}} law, but counterproductive as well — by declaring federal agencies to be the enemy, [...] "the Transfer Movement does more harm than good to the federal-state relationship needed for effective public land management." ...|$|E
