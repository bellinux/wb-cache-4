He would issue video game challenges and answered questions on cheats and tips. The show's host, Dominik Diamond, claimed that Moore did not understand anything that he said on the show, yet managed to record his contributions in single takes.|$|E
5|$|The {{seat was}} made more {{competitive}} in the 1997 boundary review by {{the formation of the}} North West Cambridgeshire seat, which incorporated the rural land outside Peterborough and several Conservative-inclined wards from the city. Since its formation, North West Cambridgeshire {{has been one of the}} safest Conservative seats in the country, whilst Peterborough was ranked 93rd in the Conservatives's one hundred most vulnerable seats (the ones which the other parties must take if <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> be a change of government) and 73rd on Labour's target list; these factors led Mawhinney to stand in North West Cambridgeshire instead.|$|E

And, Nagarjuna {{explains}} - if <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> identity of cause and effect, then <b>there</b> would <b>be</b> oneness of producer and the produce; if <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> difference between cause and effect, then the cause would <b>be</b> equal <b>to</b> a non-cause.|$|R

5|$|The team realize Travers has valid criticisms {{and make}} changes, though she becomes {{increasingly}} disengaged as painful childhood memories resurface. Seeking {{to understand what}} troubles her, Disney invites Travers to Disneyland, which, along with her developing friendship with Ralph, the creative team's revisions to the George Banks character, {{and the addition of}} a new song and a different ending, help dissolve Travers' opposition. Her creativity reawakens, and she begins working with the team; however, when Travers discovers that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> be an animation sequence, she confronts Disney over his broken promise and returns home.|$|E
5|$|After his {{baseball}} career ended, Paciorek {{returned to school}} and {{earned a degree in}} physical education from the University of Houston, a degree that he began to pursue while recovering from back surgery. While acquiring his degree, he became a Christian Scientist and married Linda Cupp. After graduating from college, he spent several years as an instructor at a Jewish community center, then became a physical education teacher after inquiring about a Christian Science Monitor advertisement for a teaching position at Clairbourn School in San Gabriel, California. Linda died of breast cancer in 1987, and Paciorek married Karen Purdy two years later. Paciorek has four sons and four daughters. His nephew, Joey Paciorek, played in the Milwaukee Brewers minor league organization, and his sons, Pete and Mack, had minor league careers as well. While watching his son in training camp, Paciorek became an author after watching what he felt was improper instruction given to the players. He has since written two books, Plato & Socrates, Baseball's Wisest Fans and The Principle of Baseball, and All <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> Know About Hitting.|$|E
5|$|The {{goal of this}} {{executive}} order is to help address questions about favoritism in city contracting by preventing conflicts of interest, or even the appearance of such conflicts.... There should be a level playing field, where no one has an advantage—or a disadvantage—in obtaining city contracts, simply because they know me or anyone else in government.... Under the steps I'm taking today and recommending to the City Council, the public can easily learn everything <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> know about a city contract: who is involved, who will benefit and whether the city is paying a fair price. I and every other city official {{must be prepared to}} defend every contract on its merits.|$|E

25|$|When King James II of England was dethroned in the Glorious Revolution of 1688/9, he is {{supposed}} to have thrown the Great Seal of the Realm into the River Thames before his flight to France {{in order to ensure that}} the machinery of government would cease to function. It is unclear how much truth <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> this story, but certainly the seal was recovered: James's successors, William III and Mary used the same Great Seal matrix, fairly crudely adapted – possibly quite deliberately, in order to demonstrate the continuity of government.|$|E
25|$|The {{state of}} the ball affects {{deliveries}} for a batsman. Even a new cricket ball is not perfectly spherical, but in two parts stitched {{together to form a}} seam. How a ball moves depends in part on how much air resistance <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> different parts of the ball, and therefore to what degree the ball has deteriorated. A cricket team will normally seek, for example, to polish one side of the ball and rough up the other side. The resulting variation in air resistance on the ball can have a marked effect.|$|E
25|$|The {{subsequent}} sale of {{the track}} bed was postponed following {{the prospect of a}} number of schemes to re-open the closed section of the line.

Even so, certain covenants have been inserted into the deeds stating that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> be no building on this land and it can be compulsorily purchased back should the need arise to reinstate the line.|$|E

25|$|At {{the time}} of the initial congressional proceedings, it was not known if Nixon had known and {{approved}} of the payments to the Watergate defendants earlier than this conversation. Nixon’s conversation with Haldeman on August 1, 1972, is one of several that establishes he did. Nixon said: “Well... they have to be paid. That’s all <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> that. They have to be paid.” During the congressional debate on impeachment, some believed that impeachment required a criminally indictable offense. Nixon's agreement to make the blackmail payments was regarded as an affirmative act to obstruct justice.|$|E
25|$|During the Lesser Lenten seasons (Nativity Fast, Apostles' Fast and Dormition Fast) the Little Hours undergo changes {{similar to}} those during Great Lent, except the Lenten hymns are usually read instead of chanted, {{and there are no}} kathismata. In addition, on weekdays of the Lesser Fasts, an Inter-Hour (Greek: Mesorion) may be read {{immediately}} after each Hour (at least {{on the first day of}} the Fast). The Inter-Hours may also be read during Great Lent if <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> be no reading from the Ladder of Divine Ascent at the Little Hours. The Inter-Hours follow the same general outline as the Little Hours, except they are shorter.|$|E
25|$|The {{so-called}} sympathetic Seattle {{strike was}} an attempted revolution. That {{there was no}} violence does not alter the fact... The intent, openly and covertly announced, was for {{the overthrow of the}} industrial system; here first, then everywhere... True, there were no flashing guns, no bombs, no killings. Revolution, I repeat, doesn't need violence. The general strike, as practised in Seattle, is of itself the weapon of revolution, all the more dangerous because quiet. To succeed, it must suspend everything; stop the entire life stream of a community... That is to say, it puts the government out of operation. And that is all <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> revolt–no matter how achieved.|$|E
