5|$|One of {{the first}} {{decisions}} Hsu had to make was how to localize Maya's hometown and the mysticism of the Fey clan. She {{came up with the}} idea that the localized versions of the Ace Attorney games take place in Los Angeles in an alternative universe where anti-Japanese laws like the California Alien Land Law of 1913 were not passed, anti-Japanese sentiments were not powerful, and where Japanese culture flourished. This dictated what should be localized and what should be kept Japanese; things relating to the Fey clan and the Kurain channeling technique were kept Japanese, as that was Maya's heritage, while Japanese foods that were not widely known in the West were changed. Despite the setting in the United States in the localized version, the Japanese justice system of the original remained intact in the localization, as changing it would have altered the entire game structure. As the localization team wanted to keep the humor in the Japanese names for the characters, it was decided to make the English names contain <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> double meanings: character name puns were based on their personalities or backgrounds, or were visual gags. A lot of the names were determined with the original Japanese name in mind; for the game's third episode, several Japanese names were used without changes, since they were English puns to begin with. For some other characters, the names had to be altered heavily from the Japanese originals. Due to the dramatic feeling of the last episode, the characters in it were given names that sounded more like real names, while still making use of deeper meanings. Takumi personally approved all the English names; for one of the names, Takumi and the localization team had a discussion for days, as Takumi did not think the English name conveyed the same feeling as the Japanese one.|$|E

25|$|Annuities {{provide a}} stream of {{payments}} and are generally classified as insurance because they are issued by insurance companies, are regulated as insurance, and require <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> actuarial and investment management expertise that life insurance requires. Annuities and pensions that pay a benefit for life are sometimes regarded as insurance against {{the possibility that a}} retiree will outlive his or her financial resources.

25|$|There are {{at present}} a few {{industrial}} scale biomass gasification plants. Since 2008 in Svenljunga, Sweden, a biomass gasification plant generates up to 14 MWth, supplying industries and citizens of Svenljunga with process steam and district heating, respectively. The gasifier uses biomass fuels such as CCA or creosote impregnated waste wood {{and other kinds}} of recycled wood to produces syngas that is combusted on site. In 2011 a similar gasifier, using <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> fuels, is being installed at 's CHP plant.

25|$|The {{fourteen}} dorsal vertebrae are weakly amphicoelous, or concave on both ends, {{typical of}} basal sauropodomorphs. Also typical {{is the presence}} of blade-like keels on the undersides of the first to third dorsal vertebrae, which are not seen elsewhere; additionally, the dorsal vertebrae near the front have the typical low, short, and somewhat plate-like neural spines. Unusually, however, <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> neural spines are also seen in the last three dorsal vertebrae, which is only otherwise seen in basal saurischians like Herrerasaurus and Eoraptor. In the middle and back dorsal vertebrae, the top back corner of the neural spines project outward to produce a concave back edge, which is seen in some other basal sauropodomorphs but not Lufengosaurus, Jingshanosaurus, Yunnanosaurus, and Riojasaurus.|$|E
25|$|Third-wave {{feminism}} harmonizes {{the thoughts}} that while individuals have rights, overarching inequalities hinder women's capabilities. Third-wave feminism also considers {{that women who}} are trafficked and face oppression do not all face <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> oppression. For example, third-wave feminist proponent Shelley Cavalieri identifies oppression and privilege in the intersections of race, class, and gender. Women from low socioeconomic class, generally from the Global South, face inequalities that {{differ from those of}} other sex trafficking victims. Therefore, it advocates for catering to individual trafficking victim because sex trafficking is not monolithic, and therefore there is not a one-size-fits-all intervention. This also means allowing individual victims to tell their unique experiences rather than essentializing all trafficking experiences. Lastly, third-wave feminism promotes increasing women's agency both generally and individually, so that they have the opportunity to act on their own behalf.|$|E
25|$|These {{traditional}} {{markets are}} {{a variation of}} tianguis, or open air markets, which have been {{an important part of}} commerce since pre Hispanic times. The difference is that traditional tianguis are held on specific days, with individual vendors setting up and taking down their stalls on the same day. Like tianguis, traditional fixed markets have stands occupied by various individual merchants, and tend to sell <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> products: produce, groceries and other basic necessities. The difference is that the fixed markets operate every day, and individual stands are rented and occupied {{in much the same way}} as a store is. The fixed market has its origin in various attempts to replace tianguis with markets that can be better regulated. However, the tianguis were never replaced. Many tianguis, especially in rural areas, now operate in conjunction with the fixed markets to expand on variety of merchandise available.|$|E

25|$|This {{clash of}} {{perspectives}} led to {{something of a}} stand-off {{and a lack of}} communication between the disciplines, resulting in little cooperation and progress for three decades. The stand-off was resolved by Holland's Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship which re-visited biological inclusive fitness theory to draw a distinction between the statistical evolutionary mechanisms for the emergence of social traits and the non-deterministic proximate mechanisms through which they are expressed. In a strict interpretation of the theory, a statistical association of related genes (as would be present in the interactions of close genetic relatives) is understood as a necessary (though not sufficient) condition for the evolutionary emergence of certain traits relating to social cooperation (see kin selection). However, this does not entail that the proximate mechanisms governing the expression of such social traits in primates and humans necessarily depends on (or are determined by) conditions of genetic relatedness per se. For the vast majority of social mammals—including primates and humans—the formation of social bonds (and the resulting social cooperation) are based on familiarity from an early developmental stage, and <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> mechanisms that attachment theorists (see above) have outlined. In short, in humans and in other primates, genetic relatedness is not necessary for the attachment bonds to develop, and it is the performance of nurture that underlies such bonds and the enduring social cooperation that typically accompanies them (see Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship).|$|E
500|$|Tyndall did his {{national}} service in West Germany from 1952 to 1954. A {{member of the}} Royal Horse Artillery, he achieved the rank of lance-bombardier. On completion, he returned to Britain and {{turned his attention to}} political issues. Initially interested in socialism, he attended a world youth festival held in the Soviet Union in 1957. He nevertheless began to regard left-wing politics as being infused with [...] "anti-British attitudes", moving swiftly to the political right. He had a devotion to the preservation of the British Empire and a hostility to what he regarded as the growing permissiveness of British society, stating that [...] "the smell everywhere was one of decadence". During that decade he read Mein Kampf, the autobiography and political manifesto of the late Nazi leader Adolf Hitler, growing sympathetic to Hitler's own political beliefs and Nazism. Tyndall approved in particular of [...] "the descriptions of the workings of certain Jewish forces in Germany, which seemed uncannily similar to what I had observed of <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> forces in Britain." [...] He concluded that Britain's {{decision to go to war}} against Nazi Germany was ultimately the result of a conspiracy headed primarily by Jews, a conspiracy which he thought had also masterminded non-white immigration into Britain after the war.|$|E
500|$|Writers for Famitsu {{praised the}} mix of {{seriousness}} and comedy, and liked the characters' quirkiness and the pacing of the conversations. John Walker at Eurogamer called the game [...] "splendidly crazy as ever" [...] and [...] "the most joyfully daft fun imaginable". Tom East at Official Nintendo Magazine called the script fantastic. Joe Juba at Game Informer found the game entertaining, calling the writing hilarious and the problem-solving clever, with the two aspects complimenting each other well. Aaron Thomas at GameSpot liked the game, praising the game's story and calling the characters its greatest strength. He thought that the pacing {{was better than the}} first Ace Attorneys, but still found the game to be a step back: he felt that the game often reuses <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> twists from the first. Gerald Villoria at GameSpy called the episodes well structured and stronger than the ones in first game, and called the dialogue sharp. Mikel Reparaz at GamesRadar said that the script, while entertaining, contains [...] "long stretches of meaningless dialogue" [...] and tends to leave the player knowing what happened and how to prove it before Phoenix does. He initially liked the new rival character Franziska, but thought that she only becomes increasingly obnoxious. Craig Harris at IGN said that the episodes are well written, with enthusiasm and personality, making them hard to put down.|$|E
