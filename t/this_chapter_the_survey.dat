From an evaluation of their effectiveness {{on the one hand}} and the side-effects, including tolerance, dependence and abuse liability on the other, it would appear that the therapeutic goals of codeine could be achieved by other substances, except perhaps where analgesia, cough relief, and sedation are required simultaneously.

Since 1950, hydromechanical implementations of turbine engine control systems have matured into highly reliable units.

Tabulating and analysing Platonic allusions to Hesiod, it concludes that Plato depicts Socrates as a lover of Homer, whereas his interlocutors draw more freely on Hesiod. Moreover, {{there appears to be a}} tendency among Platonic speakers to be more optimistic about the truth of ‘Homeric’ myths (i. e. myths constructed from Homeric elements) than that of ‘Hesiodic’ ones. ...|$|R
