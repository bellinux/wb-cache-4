5|$|A {{different}} call is {{emitted by}} a male frog or unreceptive female when mounted by another male. This is a distinct chirruping sound and {{is accompanied by a}} vibration of the body. Tree frogs and some non-aquatic species have a rain call that they make on the basis of humidity cues prior to a shower. Many species also have a territorial call that is used to drive away other males. All of these calls are emitted with the mouth of <b>the</b> <b>frog</b> closed. A distress call, emitted by some frogs when they are in danger, is produced with the mouth open resulting in a higher-pitched call. It is typically used when <b>the</b> <b>frog</b> has been grabbed by a predator and may serve to distract or disorientate the attacker so that it releases <b>the</b> <b>frog.</b>|$|E
5|$|Arboreal frogs have pads {{located on}} the ends of their toes to help grip {{vertical}} surfaces. These are not suction pads, the surface consisting instead of columnar cells with flat tops with small gaps between them lubricated by mucous glands. When <b>the</b> <b>frog</b> applies pressure, the cells adhere to irregularities on the surface and the grip is maintained through surface tension. This allows <b>the</b> <b>frog</b> to climb on smooth surfaces, but the system does not function efficiently when the pads are excessively wet.|$|E

5|$|Having {{traveled}} to France {{in the early}} 1920s, Gordon Balfour, the nephew of John Balfour, (who {{was one of the}} co-founders of Balfours Bakery), found inspiration for <b>the</b> <b>frog</b> cake in European confectionery. <b>The</b> <b>frog</b> cake was introduced by Balfours in 1922 after Gordon's return to Adelaide, during a time in which tearooms were still popular in the city. It soon became known as the Balfours mascot, and has traditionally only been sold in South Australia, although they are now sold in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland as well.|$|E
5|$|Natural predators include wading birds, such as reef egrets, white-faced herons, white ibises and swamp harriers. Other predators include snakes, skinks, red foxes, tortoises, and eels {{and other}} fish, such as redfin perch and European carp, several {{varieties}} of gudgeon, {{and a range}} of invertebrate predators, such as the large brown mantis. Predation on adult frogs has been recorded for the red-bellied black snake, tiger snake, laughing kookaburra, and sacred kingfisher; wading birds and other snakes, such as the green tree snake and the copperhead snake, are also believed to be predators of <b>the</b> <b>frog.</b> The relative magnitude of the various predatorial threats to <b>the</b> <b>frog</b> and its tadpoles is not known. Before <b>the</b> <b>frog</b> became rare, and when subsistence lifestyles were more common, it was hunted and eaten by Australian Aborigines. It was also used in dissection demonstrations in biology classes, and caught by humans for feeding pet reptiles.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes {{during the}} tadpole stage, {{one of the}} {{developing}} rear legs is eaten by a predator such as a dragonfly nymph. In some cases, the full leg still grows, but in others it does not, although <b>the</b> <b>frog</b> may still live out its normal lifespan with only three limbs. Occasionally, a parasitic flatworm (Ribeiroia ondatrae) digs into the rear of a tadpole, causing a rearrangement of the limb bud cells and <b>the</b> <b>frog</b> develops an extra leg or two.|$|E

5|$|Experience during {{operations}} later led to {{the development}} of specialised armoured equipment by Australian industry for use in jungle operations in the South West Pacific Area. A range of modifications were subsequently developed for the Matilda, including the fitting of wire mesh screens or metal tracking over the engine and air louvres to protect it against magnetic mines, an armoured shield on top of the hull to protect the turret ring, a microphone and headset attached to the rear to act as a telephone for infantry co-operation, waterproofing equipment for deep wading, a tank dozer, a flamethrowing tank called the Matlida Frog, and one capable of firing a salvo of naval mortar bombs, known as the Matilda Hedgehog. <b>The</b> <b>Frog</b> was capable of projecting a flame , while the Hedgehog was designed to fire multiple projectiles at concrete blockhouses. Used in combat in the final year of the war in support of Australian infantry at Balipapan, <b>the</b> <b>Frog</b> proved a successful adaptation. Trials were also undertaken to fit air conditioning to the Matildas to improve the endurance of crews in tropical conditions. Limited modifications were also undertaken on the M3 Grant medium tanks, including the fitting of a small number of dozer variants and trials to waterproof the vehicles for wading.|$|E
