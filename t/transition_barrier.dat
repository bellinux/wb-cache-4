40|$|In this paper, {{we take a}} {{political}} economy perspective on barriers that inhibit a transition beyond the growth-paradigm - that is, we frame <b>transition</b> <b>barriers</b> as looming distributional conflicts. Within the current paradigm, distributional conflicts are mitigated via economic growth. Hence, the solution of these distributional conflicts {{is a prerequisite for}} a successful transition. Specifically, we analyze three examples of <b>transition</b> <b>barriers.</b> First, unemployment represents the most commonly cited reason why economic growth is considered indispensable. Second, pension schemes rely on economic growth to offset demographic change. Third, alternative indicators to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) have not succeeded in replacing GDP as a standard metric of economic welfare. In each of these three examples, we identify actor-interest constellations that foster the status quo. We conclude that compensating those actors who would presumably be worse off due to a transition beyond the growth paradigm may be inevitable to mitigate and overcome the distributional effects to be triggered by the transition...|$|R

Surface mass density and temperature gradient irregularities favor the apparition of traps and deserts. Such features are found at the dust sublimation lines and heat <b>transition</b> <b>barriers.</b> We study how planets may remain trapped or escape as they grow and as the disk evolves. We model the temporal viscous evolution of a protoplanetary disk by coupling its dynamics, thermodynamics, geometry and composition.

We follow the viscous evolution of a MMSN and compute the Lindblad and corotation torques that such a disk would exert on potential planets of various masses located within the planetary formation region. We determine the position of planet traps and deserts in relationship with the sublimation lines, shadowed regions and heat <b>transition</b> <b>barriers.</b> Planets that are a few tens of Earth masses can be trapped at the sublimation lines until they reach a certain mass while planets more massive than 100 ME can only be trapped permanently at the heat <b>transition</b> <b>barriers.</b> Coupling a bimodal planetary migration model with a self-consistent evolved disk, {{we were able to}} distinguish several potential planet populations after 5 million years of evolution: two populations of giant planets that could stay trapped around 5. 5 and 9 au and possibly open gaps, some super-Earths trapped around 5 and 7. 5 au and a population of close-in super-Earths trapped inside 1 au.

To understand the propensity of tautomerization, hydrogen-bond acidity and basicity of neutral species is approached by means of correlations between donor/acceptor ability and H-bond interaction energies. Tautomerism processes are highly dependent on the solvent environment, and a significant reduction of the <b>transition</b> <b>barriers</b> upon solvation is seen. In addition, {{the inclusion of a}} single water molecule to assist proton transfer decreases the barriers between tautomers. Although the second water molecule further reduces those barriers, its effect is less appreciable than the first one.

40|$|The B {{domain of}} staphylococcal protein A (BdpA) {{is a small}} helical protein that has been studied intensively in {{kinetics}} experiments and detailed computer simulations that include explicit water. The simulations indicate that BdpA needs to reorganize in crossing the <b>transition</b> <b>barrier</b> to facilitate folding its C-terminal helix (H 3) onto the nucleus formed from helices H 1 and H 2. This process suggests frustration between two partially ordered forms of the protein, but recent φ value measurements indicate that the transition structure is relatively constant over {{a broad range of}} temperatures. Here we develop a simplistic model to investigate the folding transition in which properties of the free energy landscape can be quantitatively compared with experimental data. The model is a continuation of the Muñoz–Eaton model to include the intermittency of contacts between structured parts of the protein, and the results compare variations in the landscape with denaturant and temperature to φ value measurements and chevron plots of the kinetic rates. The topography of the model landscape (in particular, the feature of frustration) is consistent with detailed simulations even though variations in the φ values are close to measured values. The <b>transition</b> <b>barrier</b> is smaller than indicated by the chevron data, but it agrees in order of magnitude with a similar α-carbon type of model.
