5|$|Most stones form {{due to a}} {{combination}} of genetics and environmental factors. Risk factors include high urine calcium levels, obesity, certain foods, some medications, calcium supplements, hyperparathyroidism, gout and not drinking enough fluids. Stones form in <b>the</b> <b>kidney</b> when minerals in urine are at high concentration. The diagnosis is usually based on symptoms, urine testing, and medical imaging. Blood tests may also be useful. Stones are typically classified by their location: nephrolithiasis (in <b>the</b> <b>kidney),</b> ureterolithiasis (in the ureter), cystolithiasis (in the bladder), or by what they are made of (calcium oxalate, uric acid, struvite, cystine).|$|E

5|$|Rhabdomyolysis {{may cause}} kidney failure by several mechanisms. The most {{important}} is the accumulation of myoglobin in <b>the</b> <b>kidney</b> tubules. Normally, the blood protein haptoglobin binds circulating myoglobin and other heme-containing substances, but in rhabdomyolysis the quantity of myoglobin exceeds the binding capacity of haptoglobin. Myoglobinuria, the presence of myoglobin in the urine, occurs when the level in plasma exceeds 0.5–1.5mg/dl; once plasma levels reach 100mg/dl, the concentration in the urine becomes sufficient {{for it to be}} visibly discolored and corresponds with the destruction of about 200grams of muscle. As the kidneys reabsorb more water from the , myoglobin interacts with Tamm–Horsfall protein in the nephron to form casts (solid aggregates) that obstruct the normal flow of fluid; the condition is worsened further by high levels of uric acid and acidification of the filtrate, which increase cast formation. Iron released from the heme generates reactive oxygen species, damaging <b>the</b> <b>kidney</b> cells. In addition to the myoglobinuria, two other mechanisms contribute to kidney impairment: low blood pressure leads to constriction of the blood vessels and therefore a relative lack of blood flow to <b>the</b> <b>kidney,</b> and finally uric acid may form crystals in the tubules of the kidneys, causing obstruction. Together, these processes lead to acute tubular necrosis, the destruction of the cells of tubules. Glomerular filtration rate falls and <b>the</b> <b>kidney</b> is unable to perform its normal excretory functions. This causes disruption of electrolyte regulation, leading to a further rise in potassium levels, and interferes with vitamin D processing, further worsening the low calcium levels.|$|E

50|$|Juvenile nephronophthisis causes {{fibrosis}} and scarring of <b>the</b> <b>kidneys,</b> {{which accounts}} for the symptoms observed. <b>The</b> <b>kidneys</b> also often have corticomedullary cysts.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> way <b>the</b> <b>kidneys</b> {{do this is}} with nephrons. There {{are over}} 1 million nephrons in each kidney; these nephrons act as filters inside <b>the</b> <b>kidneys.</b> <b>The</b> <b>kidneys</b> filter needed {{materials}} and waste, the needed materials {{go back into the}} bloodstream, and unneeded materials becomes urine and is gotten rid of.|$|R
50|$|For example, {{inadequate}} ventilation, a respiratory problem, {{causes a}} buildup of CO2, hence respiratory acidosis; <b>the</b> <b>kidneys</b> then attempt {{to compensate for the}} low pH by raising blood bicarbonate. <b>The</b> <b>kidneys</b> only partially compensate, so the patient may still have a low blood pH, i.e. acidosis. In summary, <b>the</b> <b>kidneys</b> partially compensate for respiratory acidosis by raising blood bicarbonate.|$|R
5|$|Another study {{analysed}} {{the tissues}} of Adamussium colbecki and compared them {{with those of}} Pecten jacobaeus, a temperate water species of scallop. It was found that copper, iron, cadmium and chromium were concentrated in the digestive organ of the Antarctic scallop. Cadmium levels in particular {{were higher in the}} Antarctic scallop than in P. jacobaeus and other pectinids, but zinc and manganese, found in <b>the</b> <b>kidney,</b> were considerably lower.|$|E
5|$|Biopsy of <b>the</b> <b>kidney</b> may be {{performed}} both {{to establish the}} diagnosis or to assess the severity of already suspected kidney disease. The main findings on kidney biopsy are increased cells and Ig deposition in the mesangium (part of the glomerulus, where blood is filtered), white blood cells, {{and the development of}} crescents. The changes are indistinguishable from those observed in IgA nephropathy.|$|E
5|$|In modern times, early {{reports from}} the 1908 Messina {{earthquake}} and World War I on kidney failure after injury were followed by studies by London physicians Eric Bywaters and Desmond Beall, working at the Royal Postgraduate Medical School and the National Institute for Medical Research, on four victims of The Blitz in 1941. Myoglobin was demonstrated in the urine of victims by spectroscopy, and {{it was noted that}} the kidneys of victims resembled those of patients who had hemoglobinuria (hemoglobin rather than myoglobin being the cause of <b>the</b> <b>kidney</b> damage). In 1944 Bywaters demonstrated experimentally that <b>the</b> <b>kidney</b> failure was mainly caused by myoglobin. Already during the war, teams of doctors traveled to bombed areas to provide medical support, chiefly with intravenous fluids, as dialysis was not yet available. The prognosis of acute kidney failure improved markedly when dialysis was added to supportive treatment, which first happened during the 1950–1953 Korean War.|$|E
50|$|He {{also was}} one of the first {{physicians}} to separate the organs into systems and focused his attention on <b>the</b> <b>kidneys.</b> He discovered veins do not enter inside <b>the</b> <b>kidneys,</b> but only reach their periphery. Zerbi hypothesized <b>the</b> <b>kidneys</b> act as a filter to filter liquid before it enters the bladder but other physicians doubted this.|$|R
50|$|Phosphate {{nephropathy}} {{consists of}} damage to <b>the</b> <b>kidneys</b> caused by <b>the</b> formation of phosphate crystals within <b>the</b> <b>kidney's</b> tubules, damaging <b>the</b> nephron, and can cause acute kidney failure.|$|R

5|$|Kidney damage {{occurs with}} {{exposure}} {{to high levels}} of lead, and evidence suggests that lower levels can damage kidneys as well. The toxic effect of lead causes nephropathy and may cause Fanconi syndrome, in which the proximal tubular function of <b>the</b> <b>kidney</b> is impaired. Long-term exposure at levels lower than those that cause lead nephropathy have also been reported as nephrotoxic in patients from developed countries that had chronic kidney disease or were at risk because of hypertension or diabetes mellitus.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Joey is in a {{hospital}} room of his own, where a doctor informs him that he's suffering from kidney stones. As they're too close to his bladder, Joey is given two options: wait until he passes them naturally, or have a procedure, which he finds too invasive. Opting for the former, he gives 'birth' to <b>the</b> <b>kidney</b> stones, concurrent with Phoebe’s birth.|$|E
5|$|Osteitis fibrosa cystica is {{the result}} of {{unchecked}} hyperparathyroidism, or the overactivity of the parathyroid glands, which results in an overproduction of parathyroid hormone (PTH). PTH causes the release of calcium from the bones into the blood, and the reabsorption of calcium in <b>the</b> <b>kidney.</b> Thus, excess PTH in hyperparathyroidism causes elevated blood calcium levels, or hypercalcemia.|$|E

40|$|To {{minimize}} renal radiation in abdomical radiotherapy, shielding of <b>the</b> <b>kidneys</b> is essential. IVP-simulator {{is used as}} an standard method. In this study, we used 99 mTc-DMSA {{to localize}} and shield <b>the</b> <b>Kidneys</b> and we compared this method with IVP-simulator. The size of <b>the</b> <b>kidneys</b> was proven to be larger as compared with IVP method. The mean of the overlap percentage was 81. 88 in right and 82. 89 in left <b>kidney.</b> <b>The</b> confidence interval between two methods ranged from 20 to 80 percent.

50|$|Potassium: <b>The</b> <b>kidneys</b> help to {{regulate}} potassium levels. When <b>the</b> <b>kidneys</b> are damaged, potassium levels can become elevated. Elevated potassium levels {{can cause the}} heart to beat irregularly or even stop.|$|R
5|$|The major {{criteria}} include {{liver disease}} with portal hypertension; kidney failure; {{the absence of}} shock, infection, recent treatment with medications that affect the function of <b>the</b> <b>kidney</b> (nephrotoxins), and fluid losses; the absence of sustained improvement in kidney function despite treatment with 1.5 litres of intravenous normal saline; the absence of proteinuria (protein in the urine); and, the absence of kidney disease or obstruction of kidney outflow as seen on ultrasound.|$|E
5|$|The {{predictive}} or circadian system increases renal secretion {{of potassium}} during mealtime hours (e.g. daytime for humans, nighttime for rodents) {{independent of the}} presence, amount, or absence of potassium ingestion. It is mediated by a circadian oscillator in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the brain (central clock), which causes <b>the</b> <b>kidney</b> (peripheral clock) to secrete potassium in this rhythmic circadian fashion.|$|E

5|$|When {{neutrophils}} {{release their}} granule contents in <b>the</b> <b>kidney,</b> {{the contents of}} the granule (reactive oxygen compounds and proteases) degrade the extracellular matrix of host cells and can cause damage to glomerular cells, affecting their ability to filter blood and causing changes in shape. In addition, phospholipase products (e.g., leukotrienes) intensify the damage. This release of substances promotes chemotaxis of more neutrophils to the site of infection, and glomerular cells can be damaged further by the adhesion molecules during the migration of neutrophils. The injury done to the glomerular cells can cause renal failure.|$|E
5|$|While {{many sources}} {{recommend}} additional intravenous agents to reduce damage to <b>the</b> <b>kidney,</b> {{most of the}} evidence supporting this practice comes from animal studies, and is inconsistent and conflicting. Mannitol acts by osmosis to enhance urine production and is thought to prevent myoglobin deposition in <b>the</b> <b>kidney,</b> but its efficacy has not been shown in studies {{and there is a}} risk of worsening kidney function. The addition of bicarbonate to the intravenous fluids may alleviate acidosis (high acid level of the blood) and make the urine more alkaline to prevent cast formation in the kidneys; evidence suggesting that bicarbonate has benefits above saline alone is limited, and it can worsen hypocalcemia by enhancing calcium and phosphate deposition in the tissues. If urine alkalinization is used, the pH of the urine is kept at 6.5 or above. Furosemide, a loop diuretic, is often used to ensure sufficient urine production, but evidence that this prevents kidney failure is lacking.|$|E
5|$|Although {{adapted to}} {{terrestrial}} life, frogs resemble freshwater fish in {{their inability to}} conserve body water effectively. When they are on land, much water is lost by evaporation from the skin. The excretory system {{is similar to that}} of mammals and there are two kidneys that remove nitrogenous products from the blood. Frogs produce large quantities of dilute urine in order to flush out toxic products from <b>the</b> <b>kidney</b> tubules. The nitrogen is excreted as ammonia by tadpoles and aquatic frogs but mainly as urea, a less toxic product, by most terrestrial adults. A few species of tree frog with little access to water excrete the even less toxic uric acid. The urine passes along paired ureters to the urinary bladder from which it is vented periodically into the cloaca. All bodily wastes exit the body through the cloaca which terminates in a cloacal vent.|$|E
