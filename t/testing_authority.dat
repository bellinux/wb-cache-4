5000|$|Unlike the AR-15/M16, the AR-18 {{did not see}} {{substantial}} sales success, and {{was never}} officially adopted by any country as their standard service rifle. The reasons for this are unclear, but may {{have had something to}} do with the existing sales popularity of the AR-15/M16, as well as the need for additional field testing and evaluation of the Costa Mesa-produced rifles, which were still in the advanced prototype stage. The AR-18 was purchased for evaluation trials by various armed forces, including the United States (1964) and the United Kingdom (1966). [...] These suffered various malfunctions during evaluation trials by various nations. [...] During the US trials at Aberdeen Proving Ground in 1964, the AR-18's functioning was found to vary from lot to lot of ammunition. [...] The evaluating board concluded that while the basic design of the AR-18 was sound, it required additional minor revisions and changes to improve safety and reliability before it could be considered for adoption as a service rifle. [...] The British Ministry of Defence (MOD) tested the AR-18 in March 1966, and found the design unsatisfactory in performance during mud and sand trials. ArmaLite made several minor production modifications to the design commencing in 1965, and the U.S. Army was directed to re-evaluate the AR-18 at the end of 1969. Testing was conducted at Aberdeen Proving Grounds, conducted by arsenal employees and the Infantry Board at Fort Benning, Georgia [...] However, American procurement officials were not interested in acquiring yet another 5.56 mm service rifle. A number of deficiencies were listed and the <b>testing</b> <b>authority</b> stated that, although the AR-18 had military potential, it needed further development. In 1968, dissatisfied with efforts to market the AR-18, Arthur Miller left ArmaLite.|$|E

40|$|This article {{outlines}} {{the process of}} preparation of an anti-doping laboratory {{in view of the}} activities to be performed {{on the occasion of the}} Olympic Games, focusing in particular on the accreditation requirements of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and ISO/IEC 17025, as well as on the additional obligations required by the International Olympic Committee, which is the <b>testing</b> <b>authority</b> responsible for the anti-doping activities at the Olympics. Due to the elevated workload expected on the occasion of the Olympic Games, the designated anti-doping laboratory needs to increase its analytical capacity (samples processed/time) and capability by increasing the laboratorys resources in terms of space, instrumentation and personnel. Two representative cases, one related to the Winter Olympic Games (Torino 2006) and one related to the Summer Olympic Games (Beijing 2008), are presented in detail, in order to discuss the main aspects of compliance with both the WADA and ISO/IEC 17025 accreditation requirements. © 2012 Future Science Ltd...|$|E
40|$|The {{determination}} of xenobiotics in biological fluids {{plays a key}} role in antidoping activities. Substances and methods in this context are listed by the World Antidoping Agency (WADA). The list is revised annually and comprises about 300 substances grouped according to their pharmacological action. The number of samples (urine and in some instances blood) analyzed by antidoping laboratories varies from 2000 to 15, 000 each year, depending on the National <b>Testing</b> <b>Authority</b> of each Country. Hence, the main goal of antidoping laboratories is to develop analytical methods able to screen for the maximum number of substances minimizing, by the same token, sample manipulation and costs. Techniques used for the analysis of doping substances are primarily chromatographic methods, in particular Gas Chromatography (GC) coupled with Mass Spectrometry (MS) or Nitrogen Phosphorous Detection (NPD), High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) coupled with MSn or Ultraviolet (UV) detection, or, mainly for confirmation analysis, Isotopic Ratio Mass Spectrometry (IRMS) and High Resolution (HR) MS.

40|$|A {{wide range}} of objectively {{measured}} and subjectively assessed characters were recorded in the South Australian Selection Demonstration Flocks between 1997 and 2005. These data provided an opportunity to study the genetics of wool colour and relationships with other traits, {{as part of a}} wider study by the Sheep CRC. In 2000, 2001 and 2002 clean wool colour was objectively measured by the Australian Wool <b>Testing</b> <b>Authority</b> on wool samples from 1, 116 hogget rams. Clean colour was highly heritable (0. 45). For assessed greasy colour the heritability was even higher (0. 53), with a favourable negative genetic correlation (- 0. 38) between the two traits. There was a strong (0. 57) positive genetic correlation between mean fibre diameter and clean wool colour and similarly a moderate negative genetic correlation with greasy wool colour. There was also a positive genetic correlation between clean colour and greasy fleece weight (0. 34), dust penetration (0. 35), and the standard deviation of fibre diameter (0. 33). This indicates that selecting animals with heavier fleece weights tends to lead to progeny with wool that is more yellow in clean colour and that selecting animals with lower fibre diameter tends to lead to progeny that have whiter, more lustrous wool. The implications of these findings are discussed. M. L. Hebart and F. D. Brie...|$|E
40|$|Merinos are the {{predominant}} sheep breed in Australia, accounting-for about 76 % {{of a total}} of 150 m. Approximately 197, 000 Merino rams are sold annually, of which 157, 000 are horned and 40, 000 are polled. The Australian Merino is above all a producer of premium quality white wool. The major determinant of wool income is weight, but the price per kilogram is influenced mainly by fibre diameter. Recording in Merino stud flocks is minimal. Sires are sometimes identified but dam identities are not routinely recorded. Neither are required for registration purposes. Subjective grading of breeding stock is still the main selection criterion, but there is an increasing emphasis on wool testing data. Several past attempts to design and establish recording services aimed at flocks with some pedigree information have been largely ignored by Merino breeders. However, successful testing services based on fibre diameter measurement and either greasy or clean fleece weights have been set up by some of the State Departments of Agriculture, the Australian Wool <b>Testing</b> <b>Authority,</b> the School of Wool and Pastoral Sciences (Univ. of N. S. W.) and by private consultants and are well supported. WOOLPLAN is an attempt to rationalize and integrate testing services and extend them to incorporate the recording requirements of studs producing rams for commercial flocks in which wool is an important, though not the sole, source of income...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: E-voting systems {{should be}} {{verified}} to be fit-for-purpose before being deployed, {{but there is}} a serious lack of provision for verification and maintenance in existing standards and recommendations for e-voting. A change to requirements, or to the system, usually results in the previously established fitness-forpurpose being compromised. Therefore change must be managed, and standards documents must make provision for their own maintenance. Verification is a process of establishing a relationship between what is required of the system and properties of the actual system. It is good practice that an independent authority be responsible for verification of systems against requirements. It must be possible to determine whether a given authority can be trusted to fulfil this task competently. Thus, requirements documents must not only say what standards are to be met, but must also state the minimum capabilities expected of any <b>testing</b> <b>authority.</b> The whole e-voting system development process is prone to human-error. This applies to the requirements, standards and the systems they describe. We must introduce suitable procedures for dealing with these errors, including the identification of responsible parties. We must also ensure that there is adequate incentive for the correction of errors. If maintenance of systems requires expensive recertification, there is a risk that vendors will not make necessary changes to their systems (to avoid recertification) or will make change...|$|E
