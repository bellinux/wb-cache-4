25|$|On July 2, 2012, {{two days}} before a {{scheduled}} announcement at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), scientists at the Tevatron collider from the CDF and DØ collaborations announced their findings from the analysis of around 500 trillion collisions produced since 2001: They found {{that the existence of}} the Higgs boson was likely with a mass in the region of 115 to 135 GeV. The statistical significance of the observed signs was 2.9 sigma, which meant that there is only a 1-in-550 chance that a signal of that magnitude would have occurred if no particle in fact existed with those properties. <b>The</b> <b>final</b> <b>analysis</b> of data from the Tevatron did however not settle {{the question of whether the}} Higgs particle exists. Only when the scientists from the Large Hadron Collider announced the more precise LHC results on July 4, 2012, with a mass of 125.3 ± 0.4 GeV (CMS) or 126 ± 0.4 GeV (ATLAS) respectively, was there strong evidence through consistent measurements by the LHC and the Tevatron for the existence of a Higgs particle at that mass range.|$|E

According to Kempers, [...] "here is no clear consensus on how much the tribes gained or lost in the final negotiations." [...] But, in Kempers' view, [...] "n <b>the</b> <b>final</b> <b>analysis,</b> however, the settlement negotiations appear to have compromised the very basis of the claim" [...] by bringing the tribes under [...] "much closer state supervision." [...] "In a very real way, the deterioration of culture that the tribes' sought to reverse by going to court was aggravated by the litigation and the political negotiation of their claim." ...|$|E

500|$|Eurogamer {{praised the}} game's graphics, camera angles and mini-games, but complained about unfair enemies, {{annoying}} character accents and an arbitrary mix of musical genres. The reviewer believed that [...] " [...] in <b>the</b> <b>final</b> <b>analysis</b> {{is just not}} good enough to warrant spending £40." [...] IGN gave it a [...] "passable" [...] verdict: the reviewer felt that the game's brief initial appeal quickly gave way to repetition. He had a mixed opinion of its graphics, with praise given to the character animations, but criticism to perceived poor draw distance. GameSpot deemed the game [...] "mediocre". The reviewer noted that [...] "the humor almost always falls flat", and that [...] "ToeJam's speech [...] is filled with stupid double entendres". The website found the soundtrack to be dated, and called the game's audio [...] "a serious disappointment".|$|E
500|$|Allied {{commander}}s, {{and later}} historians, debated whether the Admiralty Islands Campaign was the bold action {{of a great}} commander or a reckless endeavour that courted disaster. Admiral Fechteler felt, [...] "we're damn lucky we didn't get run off the island," [...] and Admiral Barbey, for one, believed the original plan {{would have resulted in}} overrunning the islands in short order with fewer casualties. It would certainly have been much less risky, but it is doubtful whether an assault on the well-defended beaches of Seeadler Harbour would have resulted in fewer casualties. Whereas, in accelerating both MacArthur and Nimitz's campaigns, it shortened the war by at least a month. Thus, in <b>the</b> <b>final</b> <b>analysis,</b> the campaign [...] "had the great virtue of hastening victory while reducing the number of dead and wounded".|$|E
500|$|The film {{score was}} {{composed}} by Leonard Rosenman. Bakshi wanted to include music by Led Zeppelin but producer Saul Zaentz insisted upon an orchestral score {{because he would}} not be able to release the band's music on his Fantasy Records label. Bakshi later stated that he hated Rosenman's score, which he found to be too cliché. In Lord of the Rings: Popular Culture in Global Context, Ernest Mathijs writes that Rosenman's score [...] "is a middle ground between his more sonorous but dissonant earlier scores and his more traditional (and less challenging) sounding music [...] In <b>the</b> <b>final</b> <b>analysis,</b> Rosenman's score has little that marks it out as distinctively about Middle Earth, relying on traditions of music (including film music) more than any specific attempt to paint a musical picture of the different lands and peoples of Tolkien's imagination." [...] The film's score was issued as a double-LP soundtrack album in 1978. A limited collector edition was created by Fantasy Records as a picture disc double LP featuring four scenes: The Hobbits leaving Hobbiton, The Ringwraiths at Bree, Gandalf and the Balrog, Journey with the Orcs. In 2001, the album was reissued on compact disc, with bonus tracks.|$|E

500|$|The {{design of}} these ships was very {{controversial}} {{while they were}} being built in the 1870s, with many articles being published in the newspapers of the day by supporters and detractors, and later picked up by historians. One such account, published in 1875, claimed that Novgorod made an uncontrollable turn while on the Dniepr, while Reed, describing {{a time when the}} ship's engines on one side were reversed during a cruise in Sevastopol Bay, wrote: [...] "The circular form is so extremely favourable to this kind of handiness that the Novgorod can easily be revolved on her centre at a speed which quickly makes one giddy. She can, nevertheless, be promptly brought to rest, and, if, needed have her rotary motion reversed." [...] It would seem probable that the two reports quoted above were combined into the story as given by Fred T. Jane: [...] "On a trial cruise, they (Novgorod and [...] ) went up the Dniepr very nicely for some distance, till they turned to retire. Then the current caught them, and they were carried out to sea, whirled helplessly round and round, every soul on board helplessly incapacitated by vertigo." [...] The other criticisms made by Preston have been discussed earlier and the opinion of naval historian Stephen McLaughlin is a reasonable assessment of these ships: In <b>the</b> <b>final</b> <b>analysis,</b> the popovkas seem to have been relatively effective coast-defence vessels; certainly their combination of armament and armour could have only been carried by a conventional ship of much greater draught. Their faults – and they certainly had faults — were exaggerated by critics, both in Russia and abroad, and have left as a legacy stories of uncontrollable ships designed by incompetent men.|$|E
