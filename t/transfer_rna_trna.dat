5|$|<b>Transfer</b> <b>RNA</b> (<b>tRNA)</b> {{is a small}} RNA {{chain of}} about 80 {{nucleotides}} that transfers a specific amino acid to a growing polypeptide chain at the ribosomal site of protein synthesis during translation. It has sites for amino acid attachment and an anticodon region for codon recognition that binds to a specific sequence on the messenger RNA chain through hydrogen bonding.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the length}} of RNA chain, RNA {{includes}} small RNA and long RNA. Usually, small RNAs are shorter than 200nt in length, and long RNAs are greater than 200nt long. Long RNAs, also called large RNAs, mainly include long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) and mRNA. Small RNAs mainly include 5.8S ribosomal RNA (rRNA), 5S rRNA, <b>transfer</b> <b>RNA</b> (<b>tRNA),</b> microRNA (miRNA), small interfering RNA (siRNA), small nucleolar RNA (snoRNAs), Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA), tRNA-derived small RNA (tsRNA) and small rDNA-derived RNA (srRNA).|$|E

5|$|Some RNA {{molecules}} play {{an active}} role within cells by catalyzing biological reactions, controlling gene expression, or sensing and communicating responses to cellular signals. One of these active processes is protein synthesis, a universal function where RNA molecules direct the assembly of proteins on ribosomes. This process uses <b>transfer</b> <b>RNA</b> (<b>tRNA)</b> molecules to deliver amino acids to the ribosome, where ribosomal RNA (rRNA) then links amino acids together to form proteins.|$|E
5|$|The {{genetic code}} is {{the set of}} rules by which {{information}} encoded within genetic material (DNA or mRNA sequences) is translated into proteins by living cells. Translation is accomplished by the ribosome, which links amino acids in an order specified by mRNA, using <b>transfer</b> <b>RNA</b> (<b>tRNA)</b> molecules to carry amino acids and to read the mRNA three nucleotides at a time. The genetic code is highly similar among all organisms and can be expressed in a simple table with 64 entries.|$|E
5|$|These {{so-called}} non-coding RNAs ("ncRNA") can be encoded {{by their}} own genes (RNA genes), but can also derive from mRNA introns. The most prominent examples of non-coding RNAs are <b>transfer</b> <b>RNA</b> (<b>tRNA)</b> and ribosomal RNA (rRNA), {{both of which are}} involved in the process of translation. There are also non-coding RNAs involved in gene regulation, RNA processing and other roles. Certain RNAs are able to catalyse chemical reactions such as cutting and ligating other RNA molecules, and the catalysis of peptide bond formation in the ribosome; these are known as ribozymes.|$|E

5|$|The first {{complete}} DNA {{sequence of}} an E. coli genome (laboratory strain K-12 derivative MG1655) {{was published in}} 1997. It {{was found to be}} a circular DNA molecule 4.6 million base pairs in length, containing 4288 annotated protein-coding genes (organized into 2584 operons), seven ribosomal RNA (rRNA) operons, and 86 <b>transfer</b> <b>RNA</b> (<b>tRNA)</b> genes. Despite having been the subject of intensive genetic analysis for about 40 years, a large number of these genes were previously unknown. The coding density was found to be very high, with a mean distance between genes of only 118 base pairs. The genome was observed to contain a significant number of transposable genetic elements, repeat elements, cryptic prophages, and bacteriophage remnants.|$|E
5|$|Translation is {{the process}} by which a mature mRNA {{molecule}} is used as a template for synthesizing a new protein. Translation is carried out by ribosomes, large complexes of RNA and protein responsible for carrying out the chemical reactions to add new amino acids to a growing polypeptide chain by the formation of peptide bonds. The genetic code is read three nucleotides at a time, in units called codons, via interactions with specialized RNA molecules called <b>transfer</b> <b>RNA</b> (<b>tRNA).</b> Each tRNA has three unpaired bases known as the anticodon that are complementary to the codon it reads on the mRNA. The tRNA is also covalently attached to the amino acid specified by the complementary codon. When the tRNA binds to its complementary codon in an mRNA strand, the ribosome attaches its amino acid cargo to the new polypeptide chain, which is synthesized from amino terminus to carboxyl terminus. During and after synthesis, most new proteins must fold to their active three-dimensional structure before they can carry out their cellular functions.|$|E
25|$|Gene {{expression}} {{is the process}} by which information from a gene is used in the synthesis of a functional gene product.

40|$|Ribosomes are {{macromolecular}} {{factories that}} translate the information encoded in messenger RNA (mRNA) into the {{amino acid sequence}} of proteins. Each time an amino acid has been transferred to the growing peptide chain, the mRNA and two <b>transfer</b> <b>RNAs</b> (<b>tRNAs)</b> move through the ribosome one codon at a time. This movement—called translocation—is promoted by elongation factor G (EF-G). Three papers in this issue, by Tourigny et al. (1), Pulk and Cate (2), and Zhou et al.

50|$|Threonine-tRNA ligase (TARS) {{belongs to}} the family of ligases, to be {{specific}} those forming carbon-oxygen bonds in tRNA and related compounds. More precisely, it {{belongs to the}} family of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. These latter enzymes link amino acids to their cognate <b>transfer</b> <b>RNAs</b> (<b>tRNA)</b> in aminoacylation reactions that establish the connection between a specific amino acid and a nucleotide triplet anticodon embedded in the tRNA. During their long evolution, some of these enzymes have acquired additional functions, including roles in RNA splicing, RNA trafficking, transcriptional regulation, translational regulation, and cell signaling.|$|R
25|$|Two {{different}} kinds of genetic material exist: deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA). Cells use DNA for their long-term information storage. The biological information contained in an organism is encoded in its DNA sequence. RNA is used for information transport (e.g., mRNA) and enzymatic functions (e.g., ribosomal RNA). <b>Transfer</b> <b>RNA</b> (<b>tRNA)</b> molecules are used to add amino acids during protein translation.|$|E
25|$|The {{stretch of}} DNA {{transcribed}} into an RNA molecule {{is called a}} transcription unit and encodes at least one gene. If the gene encodes a protein, the transcription produces messenger RNA (mRNA); the mRNA, in turn, serves as a template for the protein's synthesis through translation. Alternatively, the transcribed gene may encode for either non-coding RNA (such as microRNA), ribosomal RNA (rRNA), <b>transfer</b> <b>RNA</b> (<b>tRNA),</b> or other enzymatic RNA molecules called ribozymes. Overall, RNA helps synthesize, regulate, and process proteins; it therefore plays {{a fundamental role in}} performing functions within a cell.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} types of RNA {{modifications}} that impact gene expression. These modifications happen to all types of cellular RNA including, but not limited to, ribosomal RNA(rRNA), <b>transfer</b> <b>RNA</b> (<b>tRNA),</b> messenger RNA (mRNA), and small nuclear RNA (snRNA). There are {{more than one hundred}} documented RNA modifications, which are described in a database maintained by the RNA Institute at the University at Albany. The most common and well-understood mRNA modification at present is the N6-Methyladenosine (m6A), which has been observed to occur an average of three times in every mRNA molecule.|$|E
2500|$|Elongation {{factors are}} part of the {{mechanism}} that synthesizes new proteins through translation in the ribosome.

25|$|Transcription is {{the process}} where genetic {{information}} in DNA is used to produce a complementary RNA strand. This RNA strand is then processed to give messenger RNA (mRNA), which is free to migrate through the cell. mRNA molecules bind to protein-RNA complexes called ribosomes located in the cytosol, where they are translated into polypeptide sequences. The ribosome mediates {{the formation of a}} polypeptide sequence based on the mRNA sequence. The mRNA sequence directly relates to the polypeptide sequence by binding to <b>transfer</b> <b>RNA</b> (<b>tRNA)</b> adapter molecules in binding pockets within the ribosome. The new polypeptide then folds into a functional three-dimensional protein molecule.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of <b>transfer</b> <b>RNA</b> (<b>tRNA),</b> for example, the 5' {{sequence}} is removed by RNase P, whereas the 3' end is removed by the tRNase Z enzyme and the non-templated 3' CCA tail is added by a nucleotidyl transferase. In {{the case of}} micro RNA (miRNA), miRNAs are first transcribed as primary transcripts or pri-miRNA with a cap and poly-A tail and processed to short, 70-nucleotide stem-loop structures known as pre-miRNA in the cell nucleus by the enzymes Drosha and Pasha. After being exported, it is then processed to mature miRNAs in the cytoplasm by interaction with the endonuclease Dicer, which also initiates {{the formation of the}} RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), composed of the Argonaute protein.|$|E
25|$|In prokaryotes, {{transcription}} {{is carried}} out by a single type of RNA polymerase, which needs a DNA sequence called a Pribnow box {{as well as a}} sigma factor (σ factor) to start transcription. In eukaryotes, transcription is performed by three types of RNA polymerases, each of which needs a special DNA sequence called the promoter and a set of DNA-binding proteins—transcription factors—to initiate the process. RNA polymerase I is responsible for transcription of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes. RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcribes all protein-coding genes but also some non-coding RNAs (e.g., snRNAs, snoRNAs or long non-coding RNAs). Pol II includes a C-terminal domain (CTD) that is rich in serine residues. When these residues are phosphorylated, the CTD binds to various protein factors that promote transcript maturation and modification. RNA polymerase III transcribes 5S rRNA, <b>transfer</b> <b>RNA</b> (<b>tRNA)</b> genes, and some small non-coding RNAs (e.g., 7SK). Transcription ends when the polymerase encounters a sequence called the terminator.|$|E

40|$|Several <b>transfer</b> <b>RNAs</b> (<b>tRNAs)</b> contain inosine (I) at {{the first}} {{position}} of their anticodon (position 34); this modification is thought to enlarge the codon recognition capacity during protein synthesis. The tRNA-specific adenosine deaminase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae that forms I(34) in tRNAs is described. The heterodimeric enzyme consists of two sequence-related subunits (Tad 2 p/ADAT 2 and Tad 3 p/ADAT 3), both of which contain cytidine deaminase (CDA) motifs. Each subunit is encoded by an essential gene (TAD 2 and TAD 3), indicating that I(34) is an indispensable base modification in elongating tRNAs.

25|$|The {{sequence}} of DNA, which encodes the {{sequence of}} the amino acids in a protein, is copied into a messenger RNA chain. It may be copied many times into RNA chains. Ribosomes can bind to a messenger RNA chain and use its sequence for determining the correct sequence of amino acids. Amino acids are selected, collected, and carried to the ribosome by <b>transfer</b> <b>RNA</b> (<b>tRNA)</b> molecules, which enter {{one part of the}} ribosome and bind to the messenger RNA chain. It is during this binding that the correct translation of nucleic acid sequence to amino acid sequence occurs. For each coding triplet in the messenger RNA there is a distinct transfer RNA that matches and which carries the correct amino acid for that coding triplet. The attached amino acids are then linked together by another part of the ribosome. Once the protein is produced, it can then fold to produce a specific functional three-dimensional structure although during synthesis some proteins start folding into their correct form.|$|E

The two strands of mtDNA are differentiated by their nucleotide content, with a guanine-rich strand {{referred to as the}} heavy strand (or H-strand) and a cytosine-rich strand referred to as the light strand (or L-strand).

The human mitogenome contains overlapping genes (ATP8 and ATP6 as well as ND4L and ND4: see the human mitochondrial genome map), a feature that is rare in animal genomes.
