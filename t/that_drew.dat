5|$|By then, Brown had put {{his system}} into place: a strict, {{systematic}} approach to coaching combined with a well-organized recruitment network <b>that</b> <b>drew</b> promising young players from Massillon's junior high school football program.

50|$|The Campaign for <b>Drawing</b> {{believes}} <b>that</b> <b>drawing</b> can be {{an enjoyable}} public activity {{as well as a}} private passion. It is inspired by the Victorian artist and writer, John Ruskin, whose mission was not to teach people how to draw, but how to see. An arts educational charity, the Campaign demonstrates <b>that</b> <b>drawing</b> is a life skill: an essential tool for thinking, inventing and communicating. Its publications for teachers and other educators provide comprehensive evidence <b>that</b> <b>drawing</b> supports formal and informal learning.|$|R

5|$|It is {{difficult}} to determine how far previous reigns had broken Roman Catholic devotion, with its belief in the saints and in purgatory, but certainties—especially those <b>that</b> <b>drew</b> public financial support—had been shaken. Benefactions to the church did not return significantly. Trust in clergy who had changed their minds and were now willing to leave their new wives—as they were required to do—was bound to have weakened.|$|E

The {{team won the}} Team of the Year Award at the ESPN ESPY awards that year, and Lobo became a popular symbol of the sport.

The Filmation engine {{was created by the}} Stamper brothers to portray 3D imagery. Filmation II used an image masking technique <b>that</b> <b>drew</b> and filled holes in the background, allowing the game to create composite structures out of pixelated drawings without visual overlay, despite the limitations platforms such as the ZX Spectrum offered.|$|E
5|$|The {{new wealth}} being {{generated}} {{during this period}} had {{a positive impact on}} Byzantine cultural life.

5|$|A {{particular}} {{thorn in}} the side of the Scottish Crown at the turn of the thirteenth century was Haraldr Maddaðarson, Earl of Orkney and Caithness (died 1206). At some point in the last half of the twelfth century, Haraldr put aside his first wife, a daughter of an Earl of Fife, and married Hvarflǫð, a daughter of an Earl of Ross. The latter woman was a member of the powerful meic Áedha, a northern kindred who had been in open conflict with the Scottish Crown throughout the twelfth century. Previous Orcadian earls had extended influence into Ross, and it may well have been through Hvarflǫð, and the claims to the earldom that she passed to their children, <b>that</b> <b>drew</b> Haraldr into conflict with the Scots.|$|E
5|$|Charles Albert Tindley, born in 1851 in Berlin, Maryland, {{would become}} the first major {{composer}} of gospel music, a style <b>that</b> <b>drew</b> on African American spirituals, Christian hymns and other folk music traditions. Tindley's earliest musical experience likely included tarrying services, a musical tradition of the Eastern Shore of Maryland, wherein Christian worshipers prayed and sang throughout the night. He became an itinerant preacher as an adult, working at churches throughout Maryland, Delaware and New Jersey, then settled down as a pastor in Philadelphia, eventually opening a large church called Tindley Temple United Methodist Church.|$|E
5|$|Comics {{historian}} Peter Sanderson {{compares the}} 1960s DC {{to a large}} Hollywood studio, and argues that after having reinvented the superhero archetype, DC by {{the latter part of}} the decade was suffering from a creative drought. The audience for comics was no longer just children, and Sanderson sees the 1960s Marvel as the comic equivalent of the French New Wave, developing new methods of storytelling <b>that</b> <b>drew</b> in and retained readers who were in their teens and older and thus influencing the comics writers and artists of the future.|$|E

5|$|In July 2006, the PAP {{formed a}} workgroup, headed by Phua, to explore {{initiatives}} {{to improve the}} financial security of disabled and special needs children. Phua also led a committee <b>that</b> <b>drew</b> up a five-year plan to improve services for special needs children. The PAP studied their proposals and later implemented some, such as a National non-profit Special Needs Trust Fund. Laws were also drafted to prohibit abuse of the mentally disabled and to allow parents to appoint someone to look after their special needs children after they die.|$|E
5|$|In artistic terms, {{there was}} a revival in mosaic, and {{regional}} schools of architecture began producing many distinctive styles <b>that</b> <b>drew</b> {{on a range of}} cultural influences. During the 12th century, the Byzantines provided their model of early humanism as a renaissance of interest in classical authors. In Eustathius of Thessalonica, Byzantine humanism found its most characteristic expression. In philosophy, there was resurgence of classical learning not seen since the 7th century, characterised by {{a significant increase in the}} publication of commentaries on classical works. In addition, the first transmission of classical Greek knowledge to the West occurred during the Komnenian period.|$|E

However, according to the Recording Industry Association of America, Body Count was certified gold for sale shipments in excess of 500,000 copies, with a certification date back to August 4, 1992.|$|E

Despite two {{consecutive}} stage wins by Legnano riders, Atala-Dunlop still retained the lead going into the fourth stage. The fourth leg was held in rainy conditions that caused some rivers to overflow on the course and riders to take the wrong roads for extensive distances; {{this led to the}} cancellation of the stage and addition of a ninth leg <b>that</b> <b>drew</b> some of its route from the Giro di Lombardia. An Atala-Dunlop rider won the fifth stage, but the team lost the lead to Peugeot for one stage. Following the stage, Atala-Dunlop regained the lead and held that to the race's finish in Bergamo.|$|E
5|$|On Beecham's {{return to}} England in 1944 the LPO welcomed him back, and in October they gave a concert {{together}} <b>that</b> <b>drew</b> superlatives from the critics. Over the next months Beecham and the orchestra gave further concerts with considerable success, but the LPO players, now their own employers, {{declined to give}} him the unfettered control that he had exercised in the 1930s. If he were to become chief conductor again it would be as a paid employee of the orchestra. Beecham, unwilling to be answerable to anybody, left the LPO and in 1946 founded a rival orchestra, the Royal Philharmonic (RPO).|$|E
5|$|Proponents of {{this idea}} point out that moralists during Bosch's era {{believed}} that it was woman'sultimately Eve'stemptation <b>that</b> <b>drew</b> men into a life of lechery and sin. This would explain why the women in the center panel are very much among the active participants in bringing about the Fall. At the time, the power of femininity was often rendered by showing a female surrounded by a circle of males. A late 15th-century engraving by Israhel van Meckenem shows a group of men prancing ecstatically around a female figure. The Master of the Banderoles's 1460 work the Pool of Youth similarly shows a group of females standing in a space surrounded by admiring figures.|$|E
