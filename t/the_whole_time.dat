5|$|Daniel Pinkerton is {{the main}} {{antagonist}} of the Uncharted: Eye of Indra motion comic. Fred Tatasciore provides his voice. Pinkerton is an American who has become a crime boss in Indonesia. Pinkerton hires Drake, who is seeking the funds to raise the coffin of Francis Drake, to find the valuable Eye of Indra. After discovering that Pinkerton has unknowingly had the Eye in his safe <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>time,</b> Drake attempts to retrieve it by raiding Pinkerton's home.

Roman opens the statue to collect the riches inside. As soon as Roman does, he is cursed and zombified.

5|$|Kojima {{designed}} boss {{battles of}} Snake Eater {{to be totally}} different from those in previous Metal Gear games, or any other games. He said that the boss battle with sniper The End best represented free, open gameplay in the game. The battle takes place over a large area of dense jungle, and the player must search extensively for The End, who attacks over long range from an unknown position. This battle of attrition can last for hours, and contrasts with other boss fights in which the enemy is {{right in front of}} the player and in view <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>time.</b> In addition, the player has the ability to both avoid this boss battle altogether by killing The End earlier in the game; or save and quit during the fight, wait a week, and reload the game to find The End having died of old age. Kojima commented that features like this do not appear in other games.|$|E
40|$|The {{comparison}} of two time series and {{the extraction of}} subsequences that are common to the two is a complex data mining problem. Many existing techniques, like the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), offer solutions for comparing two <b>whole</b> <b>time</b> series. Often, however, {{the important thing is}} to analyse certain regions, known as events, rather than <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>times</b> series. This applies to domains like the stock market, seismography or medicine. In this paper, we propose a method for comparing two time series by analysing the events present in the two. The proposed method is applied to time series generated by stabilometric and posture graphic systems within a branch of medicine studying balance-related function sin human beings...|$|R

The marine is then able to reinitialize the teleportation equipment left by research expeditions into Hell and return to the Delta Labs. Betruger, however, tells the marine that although the main UAC teleporter has been destroyed, Hell is opening a Hellmouth on Mars, capable of bringing millions of demons to Mars. Further in the Delta Labs, the marine encounters the injured Swann. Swann informs the marine that Kelly has been working with Hell for possibly <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>time,</b> and has been transformed by the demons. Telling the marine that Campbell has gone after Kelly, Swann gives the marine his PDA containing information on the location on the Hellmouth under the surface of Mars and assures him that he will try to make {{his way out of the}} base alone.|$|E
5|$|Under {{appellation}} rules, around 4,000 kilograms (8,800 pounds) {{of grapes}} can be pressed to create up to 673 gallons (either 2,550 L or 3,060 L) of juice. The first 541 gallons (either 2,050 L or 2,460 L) are the cuvée {{and the next}} 132 gallons (either 500 L or 600 L) are the taille. Prior to 1992, a second taille of 44 gallons (either 167 L or 200 L) was previously allowed. For vintage Champagne, 100% of the grapes must come from that vintage year while non-vintage wine {{is a blend of}} vintages. Vintage champagne must spend a minimum of three years of aging. There are no regulations about how long it must spend on its lees, but some of the premier Champagne houses keep their wines on lees for upwards of five to ten years. Non-vintage Champagne must spend a minimum of 15 months of aging but only a minimum of 12 months on the lees. Most of the Champagne houses keep their wines on the lees through <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>time</b> of aging because it is more expense to bottle the wine then age it and finally shipped.|$|E

25|$|To prevent false-triggering of the {{automatic}} flush, most infrared detectors require that a presence be detected {{for at least}} five seconds, such as when a person is standing in front of it. This prevents a whole line of automatic flush units from triggering in succession if someone just walks past them. The automatic flush mechanism also typically waits for the presence to go out of sensor range before flushing.

Ferns were present in roughly constant numbers <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>time.</b> Flowering plants began about 120Ma {{and by the end of}} the period had taken over from the cycads.
