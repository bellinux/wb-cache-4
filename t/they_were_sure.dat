5|$|Shelby and Clarke elected not {{to pursue}} the British fleeing the Battle of Musgrove Mill. Instead, they set their sights on a British fort at Ninety Six, South Carolina, where <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>sure</b> they would find Ferguson. However, while en route, Shelby and his men were met with news of General Horatio Gates' defeat at the Battle of Camden. With the backing of General Cornwallis, Ferguson could ride to meet Shelby with his entire force, so Shelby retreated over the Appalachian Mountains into North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|The {{choice of}} Vidya Balan came with Sarkar's prior work {{experience}} {{with her in}} three music videos. Chopra said that Vidya was screen-tested {{for six months and}} only then <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>sure</b> of her acting abilities. Saif once said that he was not convinced of Vidya's abilities, since Parineeta was to be her first film. He instead hoped to work with established actresses like Aishwarya Rai or Rani Mukherjee. However, after seeing Vidya portray the character of Lalita, he was thoroughly appreciative of her performance. Getting an opportunity to debut with big names from the industry along with a lovely character to portray made Vidya accept the role of Lalita.|$|E
5|$|At 4:00p.m., two {{anti-tank}} teams {{joined the}} Sa'iqa {{company on the}} firing ramp. Both teams, along with the company, were ordered to advance eastward and seize the crossroads. At around 5:00p.m., the Israeli Air Force began attacking Egyptian forces in the fort and {{on the west bank}} of the canal. One group of four aircraft attempted to bomb the fort; the first aircraft dropped its payload of seven bombs, then descended to a low altitude to escape anti-aircraft fire. An anti-air platoon at the Kilometer 17 mark soon shot down an Israeli aircraft (either a Mirage III or an A-4 Skyhawk) with a Strela 2 missile, destroying it. Between 6:00 and 7:00p.m. all bunkers and troop shelters inside the fort were cleared, and the Egyptians transferred 26 Israeli prisoners to {{the west bank of the}} canal, and thereafter transferred them to Port Said for intelligence gathering. The Israelis concentrated heavy artillery fire against the fort, once <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>sure</b> it had been captured by the Egyptians.|$|E

5|$|James H. Doolittle {{commanding}} Northwest African Strategic Air Force (NASAF) {{was ordered}} to formulate an air interdiction campaign. He named it Operation Flax. Operation Flax called for Allied fighters to intercept the aerial convoys over the Sicily-Tunisia strait. Allied units were also briefed to carry out major offensive operations against Axis airfields in Tunisia and the overcrowded staging fields in Sicily. They were also ordered to carry out anti—shipping sweeps. Flax was an operation which was unlikely to work {{more than a few}} times, as shown by the relative impunity with which the surviving Axis air transports operated at night after the operation had begun. The flight time across the Strait of Sicily was so short that aerial interception could be made only with precise intelligence. The Germans understood this but did not know that their communications had been compromised and were being read by Allied intelligence. Ignorant of their intelligence leaks, they operated by day. Since their enemy had the option of flying by night, and the weather conditions were not ideal for interception operations, the Allies delayed the implementation of Operation Flax until the most German transport aircraft were in operation so that the blow would be as decisive as possible. Allied intelligence listened in to the Y-stations until <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>sure</b> they could strike.|$|E
25|$|Finally, {{the team}} {{noticed that the}} system would often create false echoes during heavy rainstorms, and the {{potential}} for using this as a weather system was immediately seen.

25|$|As Germany {{scheduled}} its {{invasion of}} Poland for August 25 {{and prepared for}} war with France, German war planners in August estimated that, because of massive oil, food and rubber shortfalls, {{in the face of}} an expected British blockade, the Soviet Union would become the only supplier for many items. Every internal German military and economic study had argued that Germany was doomed to defeat without at least Soviet neutrality. By August 10, the countries worked out the last minor technical details, but the Soviets delayed signing the economic agreement for almost ten days until <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>sure</b> that they had also reached a political agreement.|$|E

25|$|The move {{worked and}} he evaded the British {{for a short}} time. Lütjens then broke radio silence, {{allowing}} the British a rough idea of his latitude but not his longitude. He continued {{to believe he was}} being tracked. Naval Group West informed him to send only tactical radio signals and not risk broadcasting long radio messages to Paris since <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>sure</b> he had broken contact. Lütjens, already distrustful of B-Dienst, disregarded the warnings. Fortunately, not until late evening on 25 May, did the British realise he was heading for France. By this time Lütjens was well ahead of his pursuers. It proved, however, to be a grave error. Though the British made a number of mistakes in locating her, the intercepted message allowed them to send to air strikes against the ship over the next two days.|$|E
25|$|In 1543, Sher Shah Suri {{with a huge}} {{force of}} 40,000 cavalry set out against Maldeo Rathore (a Rajput king of Marwar). Maldeo Rathore with an army of 30,000 cavalry {{advanced}} to face Sher Shah's army. Instead of marching to the enemy's capital Sher Shah halted {{in the village of}} Sammel in the pargana of Jaitaran, ninety kilometers east of Jodhpur. After one month, Sher Shah's position became critical owing to the difficulties of food supplies for his huge army. To resolve this situation, Sher Shah resorted to a cunning ploy. One evening, he dropped forged letters near the Maldeo's camp {{in such a way that}} <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>sure</b> to be intercepted. These letters indicated, falsely, that some of Maldeo's army commanders were promising assistance to Sher Shah. This caused great consternation to Maldeo, who immediately (and wrongly) suspected his commanders of disloyalty. Maldeo left for Jodhpur with his own men, abandoning his commanders to their fate.|$|E

500|$|During the campaign, Sargsyan {{pledged that}} he would spare no effort {{to make sure the}} {{elections}} were free and fair. Sargsyan and Demirchyan put the emphasis of their campaign on the economy and the improvement of the life of ordinary Armenians. Talking about Yerkrapah—now politically transformed into the Republican Party—Sargsyan said he was confident [...] "that the people that gained victory on the battlefield will also gain victory in economy." [...] He expressed his optimism saying that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>sure</b> that they [...] "will jointly change something and find the right course." [...] The Unity bloc [...] "called broadly for a democratic society, rule of law, economic reforms and a market economy, with the state also creating conditions for the normal functioning of state enterprises and ensuring decent living standards for all." [...] Throughout the campaign, the Unity bloc was widely considered the favorite of the election. Opposition newspaper Hayots ashkhar suggested that most other political parties in Armenia were gravitating towards the opposite pole, around Kocharyan, National Security & Interior Minister Serzh Sargsyan, and the leadership of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic.|$|E
500|$|Henry {{tried to}} present his victory as a new {{beginning}} for the country; he hired chroniclers to portray his reign as a [...] "modern age" [...] with its dawn in 1485. [...] Hicks states that the works of Vergil and the blind historian Bernard André, promoted by subsequent Tudor administrations, became the authoritative sources for writers {{for the next four}} hundred years. [...] As such, Tudor literature paints a flattering picture of Henry's reign, depicting the Battle of Bosworth as the final clash of the civil war and downplaying the subsequent uprisings. [...] For England the Middle Ages ended in 1485, and English Heritage claims that other than William the Conqueror's successful invasion of 1066, no other year holds more significance in English history. By portraying Richard as a hunchbacked tyrant who usurped the throne by killing his nephews, the Tudor historians attached a sense of myth to the battle: it became an epic clash between good and evil with a satisfying moral outcome. [...] According to Reader Colin Burrow, André was so overwhelmed by the historic significance of the battle that he represented it with a blank page in his Henry VII (1502). [...] For Professor Peter Saccio, the battle was indeed a unique clash in the annals of English history, because [...] "the victory was determined, not by those who fought, but by those who delayed fighting until <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>sure</b> of being on the winning side." ...|$|E
500|$|As the 111th Congress began, Kennedy {{dropped his}} {{spot on the}} Senate Judiciary Committee to focus all his attentions on health care issues, which he {{regarded}} as [...] "the cause of my life". [...] He saw {{the characteristics of the}} Obama administration and the Democratic majorities in Congress as representing the third and best great chance for universal health care, following the lost 1971 Nixon and 1993 Clinton opportunities, and as his last big legislative battle. Kennedy made another surprise appearance in the Senate to break a Republican filibuster against the Obama stimulus package. As spring arrived, Kennedy appeared on Capitol Hill more frequently, although staffers often did not announce his attendance at committee meetings until <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>sure</b> Kennedy was well enough to appear. On March 4, 2009, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Gordon Brown announced that Kennedy had been granted an honorary knighthood by Queen Elizabeth II for his work in the Northern Ireland peace process, and for his contribution to UK–US relations, although the move caused some controversy in the UK due to his connections with Gerry Adams of the Irish republican political party Sinn Féin. Later in March, a bill reauthorizing and expanding the AmeriCorps program was renamed the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act by Senator Hatch in Kennedy's honor. Kennedy threw the ceremonial first pitch at Fenway Park before the Boston Red Sox season opener in April, echoing what his grandfather [...] "Honey Fitz"– a member of the Royal Rooters– had done to open the park in 1912. Even when his illness prevented him from being a major factor in health plan deliberations, his symbolic presence still {{made him one of the}} key senators involved.|$|E

2500|$|The {{campaign}} for Sarah's Law [...] was spearheaded by the News of the World newspaper, and began in July 2000 {{in response to}} the murder of Sarah Payne. Sarah Payne's parents backed up the campaign as <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>sure</b> that a child sex offender had been responsible for their daughter's death. Their belief was proved correct 17 months later when Roy Whiting was found guilty of killing Sarah Payne, and it was revealed that he already had a conviction for abducting and indecently assaulting an eight-year-old girl.|$|E

2500|$|AT was {{involved}} {{mainly in the}} telephone business and, {{although it was a}} partner with RCA, was reluctant to see radio grow because such growth might diminish the demand for wired services. It established station WEAF in New York as what was termed a toll station. AT could provide no programming, but anyone who wished to broadcast a message could pay a [...] "toll" [...] to AT and then air the message publicly. The original studio {{was the size of a}} telephone booth. The idea, however, did not take hold, because people would pay to broadcast messages only if <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>sure</b> that someone was listening. As a result, WEAF began broadcasting entertainment material, drawing amateur talent found among its employees. Opposition to AT's expansion into radio and an agreement with the National Broadcasting Company to lease long distance lines for their broadcasts resulted in the sale of the station and its developing network of affiliates to NBC.|$|E
