40|$|In this dissertation, {{we present}} a simple scheme for {{construction}} of a low noise continuous wave blue light source by frequency doubling a Fabry-Perot diode laser in a potassium niobate crystal inside a bow <b>tie</b> <b>ring</b> cavity. By feeding back the ring cavity transmission into the diode laser after reflection off a grating, the diode laser operates in single mode and is frequency locked to the cavity resonance. Using a simple analytic form of the beam parameters for the ring cavity, the optimum cavity configuration is found for {{a high degree of}} mode matching between the diode laser output beam and the ring cavity. The wavelength of the blue output is tunable from 484 - 488 nm, has a narrow linewidth of 1. 25 MHz, and has a continuous tuning range of more than 10 GHz. The output power of the blue light is 18 mW with intensity fluctuations less than 0. 02 dB. The blue light is a near diffraction limited Gaussian TEM 00 mode with M 2 ≈ Numerical simulation of the SHG is carried out by using the Fourier space method, and the experimental results are in good agreement with the simulation...|$|E

5000|$|His first {{international}} performances were in 1990-1991, when he competed for the USSR {{team at the}} World Championship and the World Cup. He was the 1991 World All-Around silver medalist behind teammate Grigori Misutin; scored a perfect 10.0 on the vault at the European Championships in 1990; and starred at the Goodwill Games in Seattle. He had occasional bouts of inconsistency and as the 1992 Barcelona Olympics approached, the Unified Team coaches regarded him as less of a medal prospect than his more experienced and reliable teammates. In {{one of the most}} dominant performances in history, Scherbo won six out of the possible eight awarded gold medals at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona. His golds came in the team event, the all around, pommel horse (<b>tie),</b> <b>rings,</b> vault, and parallel bars. Only Michael Phelps and Mark Spitz have ever won more golds in a single Olympic Games, and only Phelps and Eric Heiden have won as many individual gold medals (five) at a single Olympic Games.|$|R

Participants considered selling kits for consumers interested in tethering horses. One Portland resident has reportedly installed more than 150 horses.

500|$|In September 2005, Woodstock {{resident}} Scott Wayne Indiana tied {{his first}} plastic toy horse to a horse ring {{located in the}} Pearl District. Of his attempt {{to draw attention to}} the rings, and to celebrate Portland's history, Indiana said: [...] "I loved the rings, and felt that people just weren't noticing them. This was an attempt to shake people out of their routines and get them to notice their surroundings." [...] Since then, the Horse Project has gained momentum and participation; horses can be found <b>tied</b> to <b>rings</b> throughout the city, especially in east Portland. The installations have sparked interaction with residents, who have left hay, lassoes, riders, saddles, water, wool blankets, and other [...] "treats" [...] for the horses. Horses are often defaced or go missing.|$|R

50|$|The {{choices for}} the 2013 tour were Abiotic, As They Burn, Dark Sermon, Erra, Fit For An Autopsy, Howl, Intervals, Into the Flood, King Conquer, Last Chance To Reason, My Bitter End, Nekrogoblikon, Rings Of Saturn, Syqem, Soreption, Today I Caught the Plague, and Thy Art Is Murder. Thy Art Is Murder was the chosen band. However, since they were nearly <b>tied</b> with <b>Rings</b> of Saturn by a few votes, the {{organizers}} decided to put both Rings of Saturn and Thy Art Is Murder on the bill. Vektor were put on the initial ballot by their record label without the band's knowledge or approval, and upon discovering this, had to withdraw due to incompatible scheduling. The Slaughter Survivors Tour didn't occur in 2013, and didn't return in 2014 either.|$|R
60|$|In {{a corner}} the ground sloped sharply down, and Razumov {{followed}} {{the light of}} the lantern through a small doorway into a long cavernous place like a neglected subterranean byre. Deep within, three shaggy little horses <b>tied</b> up to <b>rings</b> hung their heads together, motionless and shadowy {{in the dim light of}} the lantern. It must have been the famous team of Haldin's escape. Razumov peered fearfully into the gloom. His guide pawed in the straw with his foot.|$|R
5000|$|Each field {{agent is}} {{outfitted}} with a miniature scanner disguised {{as a piece of}} jewelry, which can be magnetically attached to special cuff links, <b>tie</b> clips, <b>rings</b> or pendants. This device continuously monitors the agent's progress, transmitting audio, video, and physical telemetry to Probe Control. These images were stabilized and rotated to permit real-time observation by a team of specialists at Probe Control who analyze the data, consult databases worldwide, and immediately provide information covertly to the field agent via a subcutaneous ear piece (or [...] "earjack") implanted in the agent's mastoid process. (First-generation earjacks had platinum housings, later replaced with zirconium for unspecified reasons.) The agent can respond to Probe Control either audibly (via the microphone in the scanner) or by tapping out code with a dental implant, even when they don't have their scanner operating.|$|R

50|$|When the {{cormorants}} {{catch the}} fish, they are {{brought back to}} the boat using ropes attached to their bodies. When they are back in the boat, the fishing masters remove the fish from the birds’ throats. Each bird can hold up to six fish in its throat. The birds are prevented from swallowing the fish because of a <b>ring</b> <b>tied</b> around their necks. The cormorants, however, are still able to swallow smaller fish. Though the ropes are strong, the fishing masters are able to quickly break them if a bird’s rope gets caught beneath rocks, ensuring the bird will not drown.|$|R

500|$|Additionally {{there was}} a tie for the silver medal in the women's 200 metre medley in {{swimming}} and no bronze was awarded.

Three gymnasts in men's parallel bars and two each in men's floor, women's uneven bar and women's floor tied for second place, thus no bronzes were awarded in these events and also no silver was awarded for men's parallel bars. A tie for third in men's vault meant that two bronze medals were awarded.|$|R

The free end is then passed through the loop that has formed at the eye, and subsequently through the loop on the main line that was formed by the first wrap. The dampened main line and free end are pulled to snug the knot tight.|$|R
