5|$|From the 1888 harvest, Monet {{produced}} three canvases featuring two stacks each (Wildenstein #'s 1213-5) {{against the}} backdrop of hills along the left bank of the Seine and a few Giverny houses to the right. Then, he turned <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>left</b> to capture two scenes (1216-7) in which the hills are shrouded by a line of poplars.|$|E
5|$|In January 2002, Mustaine {{was hospitalized}} {{for the removal}} of a kidney stone and was {{administered}} pain medication that triggered a relapse of his drug addiction. Following his stay, Mustaine checked himself into a treatment center in Texas, where he suffered a peculiar injury causing severe nerve damage <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>left</b> arm. The injury, induced by falling asleep with his left arm over the back of a chair, caused compression of the radial nerve. He was diagnosed with radial neuropathy, which left him unable to grasp or even make a fist with his left hand.|$|E

While engaged in this operation on 6 May, Newland was wounded for the third and final time of the war by a gunshot <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>left</b> armpit. Initially admitted to the 5th Field Ambulance, he was transferred to No 1 Red Cross Hospital, Le Touquet, the next day. The injury necessitated treatment in England, and Newland was shipped to a British hospital eight days later.|$|E
5|$|In the Belmont, Paynter led {{for most}} of the race until the final furlong when Smith came off the rail, {{allowing}} winner Union Rags to slip through and win by a neck. Paynter had already fended off two challengers during the race, and Smith had switched his whip from his right hand <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>left</b> in an attempt to fend off a late challenge from Atigun; Smith considered his decision to be an error that cost him the race.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1990s, Bradbury accidentally hit his leg while {{chopping}} firewood. Gangrene set in, and {{his right}} leg was amputated below the knee. It spread <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>left</b> leg, and part of his left foot was amputated, leaving him in a wheelchair. The disease eventually proved fatal, and he died on 20 August 1997. He was {{survived by his wife}} Lois, who died in January 1998, and his three sons. A funeral service was held in Los Alamos, and he was buried at Guaje Pines Cemetery in Los Alamos.|$|E
5000|$|The man begins <b>to</b> bend <b>his</b> <b>left</b> knee without {{lifting his}} knee from the bed.

5|$|On Cemetery Ridge, Generals Meade and Hancock were {{scrambling}} to find reinforcements. Meade had sent {{virtually all of}} his available troops (including most of the XII Corps, who would be needed momentarily on Culp's Hill) <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>left</b> flank to counter Longstreet's assault, leaving {{the center of his}} line relatively weak. There was insufficient infantry on Cemetery Ridge and only a few artillery pieces, rallied from the debacle of the Peach Orchard by Lt. Col. Freeman McGilvery.|$|E
5|$|Several wrestlers {{were injured}} at the show. Abyss {{suffered}} several serious cuts <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>left</b> arm, while Sabu had cuts on his arms, legs, and face.

5|$|The {{inscriptions}} {{follow the}} 14th-century convention of showing figures, imagery and motifs {{associated with the}} saved to Christ's right, {{and those of the}} damned <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>left.</b> The words beneath the lily (the benedicti) read upwards towards Heaven, their curves leaning in towards Christ. The text to the left (the maledicti) flows in the opposite direction; from the highest point downwards. The inscriptions to Christ's right are decorated in light colours, {{to the extent that they}} are usually difficult to discern in reproductions. The lettering opposite faces downwards, and is applied with black paint.|$|E

5|$|Virgil Earp was {{not expecting}} a fight. Once Behan said that he'd {{disarmed}} the Cowboys, Virgil traded the short, double-barreled shotgun {{he was carrying}} for Holliday's cane. Virgil carried the cane {{in his right hand}} and shifted the pistol in his waistband from the right side <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>left.</b> Holliday concealed the short shotgun under his long jacket. Wyatt too was not expecting a fight and put his pistol in his overcoat pocket.|$|E
5|$|With {{his pace}} and high field goal percentage, Parker {{has been named}} to six NBA All-Star games, three All-NBA Second Teams, and an All-NBA Third Team. He was also the 2007 NBA Finals MVP.

5|$|A Czech woman went to Heydrich's aid and flagged down a {{delivery}} van. He was first {{placed in the}} driver's cab, but complained the van's movement was causing him pain. He {{was placed in the}} back of the van, on his stomach, and taken to the emergency room at Bulovka Hospital. He had suffered severe injuries <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>left</b> side, with major damage to his diaphragm, spleen, and one of his lungs. He also had a fractured rib. A doctor, Slanina, packed the chest wound, while another doctor, Walter Diek, tried unsuccessfully to remove the splinters. He immediately decided to operate. This was carried out by Diek, Slanina, and Hohlbaum. Heydrich was given several blood transfusions. A splenectomy was performed. The chest wound, left lung, and diaphragm were all debrided and the wounds closed.|$|E
50|$|Sullivan {{took the}} World Featherweight Title against Solly Smith in a fifth-round {{technical}} knockout in Brooklyn, New York on September 26, 1898. Smith {{had the misfortune}} <b>to</b> break <b>his</b> <b>left</b> arm near the wrist in the second round, ending <b>his</b> chances <b>to</b> give a good showing in the match, and he was compelled to retire in the fifth. Sullivan {{was said to have}} a consistent lead in the first four rounds, Smith unable <b>to</b> use <b>his</b> <b>left</b> at all in the fourth and fifth rounds. Smith did not fight again for four months after the injury, when he was defeated by Oscar Gardner.|$|R

5|$|After his tournament {{victory in}} July 2007, Asashōryū decided {{to skip the}} {{regional}} summer tour of Tōhoku and Hokkaidō beginning on 3 August because of injury. The medical forms submitted to the Japan Sumo Association indicated that injuries <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>left</b> elbow and a stress fracture in his lower back would require six weeks of rest to heal. However, he was then seen on television participating in a soccer match for charity with Hidetoshi Nakata in his homeland of Mongolia. He {{was reported to have}} done so {{at the request of the}} Japanese Foreign Ministry and the Mongolian government. However, the suggestion that he had exaggerated the extent of his injuries to avoid his duties on the exhibition tour caused a media storm.|$|E
5|$|Anderson {{scored the}} first penalty in sudden death. Kalou then sent Van der Sar {{the wrong way}} to make it 5–5. Giggs was next up and he was also successful. Van der Sar then pulled off the crucial save for United; he pointed <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>left</b> to {{indicate}} to Nicolas Anelka that he thought he would kick to that side, as had the six players who had kicked before him, only to correctly dive to his right to deny Anelka, whose kick was at a good height to be saved, securing European football's top prize for United {{for the third time in}} their history.|$|E
5|$|Following the speech, Nixon {{formally}} selected Governor Spiro Agnew of Maryland as {{his running}} mate, who received 1119 delegate votes, with the distant second being Governor Romney with 186. Agnew was relatively unknown nationally, and was selected due to his purported appeal to African Americans, and work for the Nixon campaign after an embarrassing experience {{as the head of}} the Draft Rockefeller movement. It was later noted that the convention had featured Nixon as the centrist candidate with Rockefeller <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>left</b> and Reagan to his right. The same analysis applied to the general campaign, as commentators noted that Nixon would stand to the right of the still undecided Democratic nominee but would fall to the left of American Independent Party candidate George Wallace.|$|E
