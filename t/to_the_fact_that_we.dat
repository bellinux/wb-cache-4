25|$|An {{increase}} in the RD temperament leads us to seek out those behaviors or substances {{that will allow us}} to remain in a pleasant physical and/or mental state, attributing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> humans are hedonistic individuals, seeking to avoid pain and embracing pleasurable stimuli. Our pleasure and reward systems in the brain are hyper-activated, which makes us display continuous approach behaviors to the reward in question. Our neuro-circuity is as such that when we stop having access to such pleasurable objects of desire, we then experience negative consequences (withdrawal symptoms). Addictive behaviors then arise to alleviate such negative consequences and the cycle continues.|$|E
500|$|We {{really wanted}} to spend time, immerse ourselves, drive {{for hours and hours}} aimlessly with a camera, jumping out and {{shooting}} things that caught my eye. We didn't want to go there and just shoot Frenchy's Chicken and call it an [...] "authentic video." [...] There was tons of hanging out, getting the feel, all with cameras ready. We hooked up with our dude Scotty who was a great help, plus Bun B's brother Truck, and Paul Wall. The city was so receptive, so willing to help, so open, and that leant a lot <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> really got to glimpse of the real character of Houston.|$|E
500|$|Bloc Party's {{second album}} A Weekend in the City, {{released}} in 2007, allowed the quartet to evolve sonically by including more electronically tampered soundscapes, but {{the band members}} were not entirely comfortable with more daring musical arrangements when making the record. According to multi-instrumentalist Gordon Moakes, the impromptu November 2007 single [...] "Flux" [...] "opened a door <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> could go in any direction" [...] in future works. After the NME Big Gig in February 2008, the band members took a month off from touring and did not {{interact with each other}} during that period. Moakes felt that there were no rules when the band re-assembled for studio work. Chief lyricist Okereke completed most of the songwriting before the recording process.|$|E

500|$|The {{rights were}} bought by Ubisoft for [...] Within three weeks {{they had decided}} that the game {{required}} significant changes, pushing its release date back by six months to March 2014. Parker and Stone, with input from a Ubisoft creative consultant, concluded that their original vision would take too long and would be too costly to produce. In a 2014 interview, Obsidian leader Feargus Urquhart {{said he could not}} comment on changes that were made following Ubisoft's involvement. South Park: The Stick of Truth was officially released to manufacturing on February 12, 2014. Following its release, Stone said that the work involved in making the game was much more than he and Parker had anticipated. He said, [...] "I'll [...] <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> retooled stuff that we didn't like and we worked on the game longer than other people would've liked us to".|$|E

Within six months, Frank Fenter was the Managing Director in charge of Atlantic Records' {{operations}} in all of Europe. Fenter was responsible for making Atlantic Records [...] "the most important American label in promoting British music", according to the late Ahmet Ertegun, co-founder and Chairman of Atlantic Records and The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, {{who went on to}} say, [...] "We wound up with quite a lot of British bands, due in large part <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> had put Frank Fenter in charge of all Atlantic Records activity in Europe" [...] In Frank Fenter's capacity and role as Managing Director of Atlantic Records European Operations, he played a vital role in having brought Led Zeppelin to Atlantic Records and helped discover and sign such British progressive-rock groups as Yes and King Crimson.|$|E
