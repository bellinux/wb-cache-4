40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{shift to}} quality-based {{marketing}} has challenged the grain-handling industry to meet desired purity levels {{as part of}} identity-preservation programs. Very few resources are available {{for the development of}} management strategies. This study measured commingling during grain transfer as influenced by the receiving configuration of an elevator. The facility, located at Manhattan, Kansas, has three receiving pits and one bucket elevator with a handling capacity of 190 t/h (metric ton per hour). The experiments involved moving soybeans through one of the receiving pits, followed by corn through the same flow path, without special cleaning between the two operations. Corn samples, collected at specific time intervals, were used to calculate commingling, the percentage by mass of soybean kernels mixed in corn. Commingling was greater than 1 % only during the first 135 s (first 2 t, 2 metric <b>ton,</b> <b>received),</b> except for the gravity-type pit configuration where commingling remained in excess of 1 % {{for the duration of the}} test (840 s or 7. 3 t of grain). Measured mean cumulative commingling at the end of operation was 1. 25 %, 0. 30 %, and 0. 23 % for the combined effect of gravity-type pit and elevator leg, combined effect of elevator leg and pit with a drag conveyor, and effect of elevator leg, respectively. ARENA simulation was used to predict commingling using different levels of initial impurities of incoming grain. The model predicted that a 10 -t load through a pit with drag conveyor would result in a cumulative commingling of 0. 28 %, of which 0. 27 % would be from the effect of the elevator leg...|$|E

40|$|Svensk Växtkraft is {{the owner}} of the biogas plant in Västerås. The company is {{planning}} to increase their treatment capacity at their biogas plant. In connection to this work it is also possible to make some energy saving changes to the biogas plant. The objective of this study was therefore to make an electricity and heat survey of the biogas plant, a detailed study of the heat consumption in the sanitation step and also a comparison of energy consumption with the present sanitation method and an alternative strategy where the waste is treated in 55 °C during 10 hours (the current method is heating to 70 °C during 1 hour). The energy survey was conducted in close collaboration with staff at the biogas plant. The current during normal operation was measured, power was calculated and multiplied by the time of usage to obtain the energy consumed. This was performed for each of the larger energy consuming components on the plant. To make the energy comparison of sanitation methods a model of the sanitation step was built. The model describes the largest sources of heat loss in the current sanitation step and estimates how they would change if the sanitation method changes. During one day of normal operation conditions the biogas plant in Västerås consume 64 kWh electricity per <b>ton</b> feedstock <b>received</b> and 97 kWh heat per <b>ton</b> feedstock <b>received.</b> The largest energy consuming components are estimated to use about 80...|$|R

40|$|Iowa’s Rail Environment Iowa’s rail {{transportation}} system provides both {{freight and passenger}} service. Rail serves a variety of trips, including those within Iowa and those to other {{states as well as}} to foreign markets. While rail competes with other modes, it also cooperates with those modes to provide intermodal services to Iowans. In 2009 Iowa’s {{rail transportation}} system could be described as follows: Freight Iowa’s 130, 000 -mile freight transportation system includes an extensive railroad network, a well-developed highway system, two bordering navigable waterways, and a pipeline network as well as air cargo facilities. While rail accounts for only 3 percent of the freight network, it carries 43 percent of Iowa’s freight tonnage. A great variety of commodities ranging from fresh fish to textiles to optical products are moved by rail. However, most of the Iowa rail shipments consist of bulk commodities, including grain, grain products, coal, ethanol, and fertilizers. The railroad network performs an important role in moving bulk commodities produced and consumed in the state to local processors, livestock feeders, river terminals and ports for foreign export. The railroad’s ability to haul large volumes, long distances at low costs {{will continue to be a}} major factor in moving freight and improving the economy of Iowa. Key 2008 Facts • 3, 945 miles of track • 18 railroads • 49. 5 million tons shipped • 39. 7 million <b>tons</b> <b>received</b> • 2 Amtrak routes • 6 Amtrak stations • 66, 286 rail passenger rides Key Rail Trends • slightly fewer miles being operated; • railroads serving Iowa has remained the same; • more rail freight traffic; • more tons hauled per car; • higher average rail rates per ton-mile since 2002; • more car and tons hauled per locomotive; and • more ton miles per gallon of fuel consumed. Iowa’s rail system and service has been evolving over time relative to its size, financial conditions, and competition from other modes...|$|R
