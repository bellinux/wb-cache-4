5|$|A {{technique}} called radioembolization {{is used to}} treat hepatocellular carcinoma and liver metastasis. Radioembolization is a low toxicity, targeted liver cancer <b>therapy</b> <b>that</b> uses millions of tiny beads made of glass or resin containing radioactive yttrium-90. The radioactive microspheres are delivered directly to the blood vessels feeding specific liver tumors/segments or lobes. It is minimally invasive and patients can usually be discharged after a few hours. This procedure may not eliminate all tumors throughout the entire liver, but works on one segment or one lobe {{at a time and}} may require multiple procedures.|$|E

5|$|As well {{as using}} events from his past, Fleming also used names of {{individuals}} he knew {{for some of}} his characters. The editor of The London Magazine, Alan Ross, had provided Fleming with details {{about the effects of}} the electroshock <b>therapy</b> <b>that</b> Bond went through and, by way of thanks, the novel's SIS station chief in Jamaica, Commander Ross, was named after him. Similarly, Fleming used the name of the secretary of the Royal St George's Golf Club, Mark Nicholson, for the CIA representative at the hotel. Tony Hugill, the sugar planter mentioned in the novel, was named after a member of Fleming's 30 AU unit who managed the Tate & Lyle plantations in West Indies after the war and the book's main villain, Francisco Scaramanga, was named after George Scaramanga, an Etonian contemporary of Fleming's: the pair are said to have fought at school.|$|E
5|$|In 1921, Rollin Woodyatt {{reviewed}} {{the research on}} diet and diabetes. He reported that three water-soluble compounds, β-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate and acetone (known collectively as ketone bodies), were produced by the liver in otherwise healthy people when they were starved or if they consumed a very low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet. Russel Wilder, at the Mayo Clinic, built on this research and coined the term ketogenic diet to describe a diet that produced {{a high level of}} ketone bodies in the blood (ketonemia) through an excess of fat and lack of carbohydrate. Wilder hoped to obtain the benefits of fasting in a dietary <b>therapy</b> <b>that</b> could be maintained indefinitely. His trial on a few epilepsy patients in 1921 was the first use of the ketogenic diet as a treatment for epilepsy.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} by some {{within the field of}} attachment <b>therapy</b> <b>that</b> RAD may be quite prevalent because severe child maltreatment, which is known to increase risk for RAD, is prevalent and because children who are severely abused may exhibit behaviors similar to RAD behaviors. The APSAC Taskforce consider this inference to be flawed and questionable. Severely abused children may exhibit similar behaviors to RAD behaviors but there are several far more common and demonstrably treatable diagnoses which may better account for these difficulties. Further, many children experience severe maltreatment and do not develop clinical disorders. Resilience is a common and normal human characteristic. RAD does not underlie all or even most of the behavioral and emotional problems seen in foster children, adoptive children, or children who are maltreated and rates of child abuse and/or neglect or problem behaviors are not a benchmark for estimates of RAD.|$|E

5|$|The Fringe team {{is brought}} to a nursing home, where Roscoe Joyce (Christopher Lloyd), the former keyboardist of the band Violet Sedan Chair, was seen talking to his son Bobby (Nick Ouellette) {{who had died in}} 1985, as well as {{evidence}} of an Observer. Walter Bishop (John Noble), meeting his musical hero, requests to take Roscoe back to his lab to help Roscoe remember what his son said. Walter is able to help Roscoe remember much of his past since the loss of his son through <b>therapy</b> <b>that</b> includes helping Roscoe to recall his piano-playing skills. Roscoe shortly recalls the conversation with his son, which was actually a message from the Observer September to Walter. September (Michael Cerveris) soon appears at the lab and requests to speak to Walter.|$|E
5|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet is {{a mainstream}} <b>therapy</b> <b>that</b> {{does not use}} pharmaceutical drugs, which was developed to reproduce the success and remove {{the limitations of the}} non-mainstream use of fasting to treat epilepsy. Although popular in the 1920s and 30s, it was largely abandoned in favour of new anticonvulsant drugs. Most individuals with epilepsy can successfully control their seizures with medication. However, 20–30% fail to achieve such control despite trying a number of different drugs. For this group, and for children in particular, the diet has once again found a role in epilepsy management.|$|E
5|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet is {{a medical}} nutrition <b>therapy</b> <b>that</b> involves participants from various disciplines.

Lastly, the parents and other caregivers must be educated in {{many aspects of the}} diet for it to be safely implemented.|$|E

5|$|The sexual {{allegations}} apart, {{several people}} discussed how the vegetotherapy had hurt them physically as children, as therapists pressed {{hard on the}} body to loosen muscular armour. Reich's son, Peter, wrote in his autobiography, Book of Dreams (1973) about the pain this had caused him. Susanna Steig, the daughter of William Steig, the New Yorker cartoonist, wrote about being pressed so hard during Reichian <b>therapy</b> <b>that</b> she had difficulty breathing, and said that a woman therapist had sexually assaulted her. According to Turner, a nurse complained in 1952 to the New York Medical Society that an OIRC therapist had taught her five-year-old son how to masturbate. The therapist was arrested, but the case was dropped when Reich agreed to close the OIRC.|$|E
5|$|Treatment of HHT is {{symptomatic}} (it {{deals with}} the symptoms rather than the disease itself), {{as there is no}} <b>therapy</b> <b>that</b> stops the development of telangiectasias and AVMs directly. Furthermore, some treatments are applied to prevent the development of common complications. Chronic nosebleeds and digestive tract bleeding can both lead to anemia; if the bleeding itself cannot be completely stopped, the anemia requires treatment with iron supplements. Those who cannot tolerate iron tablets or solutions may require administration of intravenous iron, and blood transfusion if the anemia is causing severe symptoms that warrant rapid improvement of the blood count.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The Warburg effect, {{the switch}} from aerobic energy {{production}} to anaerobic glycolysis, promotes tumour proliferation and motility by inducing acidification of the tumour microenvironment. <b>Therapies</b> <b>that</b> reduce acidity could impair tumour growth and invasiveness. I analyse the dynamics of cell proliferation and of resistance to <b>therapies</b> <b>that</b> target acidity in a population of cells under the Warburg effect. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The dynamics of mutant cells with increased glycolysis and motility is analysed in a multi-player game with collective interactions {{in the framework of}} evolutionary game theory. Perturbations of the level of acidity in the microenvironment are used to simulate the effect of <b>therapies</b> <b>that</b> target glycolysis. RESULTS: The non-linear effects of glycolysis induce frequency-dependent clonal selection leading to the coexistence of glycolytic and non-glycolytic cells within the tumour. Mutants with increased motility can invade such polymorphic population and spread within the tumour. While reducing acidity may produce a sudden reduction in tumour proliferation, frequency-dependent selection enables the tumour to adapt to the new conditions and can enable the tumour to restore the original levels of growth and invasiveness. CONCLUSIONS: The acidity produced by glycolysis acts as a non-linear public good that leads to the coexistence of cells with high and low glycolysis within the tumour. Such heterogeneous population can easily adapt to changes in acidity. <b>Therapies</b> <b>that</b> target acidity can only be effective in the long term if the cost of glycolysis is high, that is, under non-limiting oxygen concentrations. Their efficacy, therefore, is reduced when combined with <b>therapies</b> <b>that</b> impair angiogenesis...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This study {{reviews the}} {{biological}} mechanisms and {{recent advances in}} preventive dentistry <b>therapies</b> <b>that</b> prevent the formation dental caries, covering both traditional and novel techniques. The techniques covered prevent the formation of dental caries through two therapeutic approaches, either promoting the remineralization of the hard tooth surface or regulating the level and composition of the oral biofilm present in the mouth. Traditional therapies covered include fluoride and calcium treatments that promote the remineralization of the tooth surface, and antibiotic <b>therapies</b> <b>that</b> attempt to regulate oral biofilm levels, such as chlorhexidine, essential oils, systemic antibiotics, and salivation stimulating therapies. Novel applications covered are <b>therapies</b> <b>that</b> utilize antimicrobial peptides, immunizations, and probiotics that may become important to dentistry in the near future. Dental caries management is a complex and dynamic process, but by reestablishing optimal oral health through preventive techniques, dentists can preserve tooth structures and avoid costly and extensive restorative treatments...|$|R
