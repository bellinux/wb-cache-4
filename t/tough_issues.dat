According to The New York Times, Richardson had decided to endorse Obama a week earlier (prior to the speech), but [...] "his decision was bolstered by Mr. Obama's speech on race in Philadelphia." [...] After the speech, Richardson sent word to Obama that he had found it inspiring and impressive. While endorsing Obama in Portland, Richardson said that [...] "Senator Barack Obama addressed the issue of race with the eloquence and sincerity and decency and optimism we have come to expect of him... He did not seek to evade <b>tough</b> <b>issues</b> or to soothe us with comforting half-truths. Rather, he inspired us by reminding us of the awesome potential residing in our own responsibility."

A <b>tough</b> <b>issue</b> is resolved by decomposing a given task into motions performed by both the manipulator and the mobile platform. A direct differenti-ation method is used to analyse the differential kinematics. Stability analysis of the mobile manipulator is performed to evaluate the possibility of tip-over; some stability criteria are estab-lished. Computer simulations are carried on a real mobile modular manipulator, and ideal results are received {{to show that the}} theoretical analysis is feasible and correct...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Data centric languages, such as {{recursive}} {{rule based}} languages, {{have been proposed}} to program distributed applications over networks. They greatly simplify the code, while still admitting efficient distributed execution, including on sensor networks. From previous work [1], {{we know that they}} also provide a promising approach to another <b>tough</b> <b>issue</b> about distributed protocols: their formal verification. Indeed, we can take advantage of their data centric orientation, which allows us to explicitly handle global structures such as the topology of the network. We illustrate here our approach on two non-trivial protocols and discuss its Coq implementation. Keywords-formal verification; Coq; distributed algorithms; I...|$|R
