40|$|Motor-Imagery based Brain Computer Interfaces (MI-BCIs) allow {{users to}} {{interact}} with computers by imagining limb movements. MI-BCIs are very promising {{for a wide range}} of applications as they offer a new and non-time locked modality of control. However, most MI-BCIs involve visual feedback to inform the user about the system’s decisions, which makes them difficult to use when integrated with visual interactive tasks. This paper presents our design and evaluation of a <b>tactile</b> <b>feedback</b> <b>glove</b> for MI-BCIs, which provides a continuously updated tactile feedback. We first determined the best parameters for this tactile feedback and then tested it in a multitasking environment: at the same time users were performing the MI tasks, they were asked to count distracters. Our results suggest that, as compared to an equivalent visual feedback, the use of tactile feedback leads to a higher recognition accuracy of the MI-BCI tasks and fewer errors in counting distracters...|$|E

Flexible sensors in each finger enable control inputs that can be mapped to any number of functions (e. g., a mouse click, a keyboard strike, or a button press). Tracking of hand motion is interpreted alternatively as movement of a mouse (change in cursor position on a graphical user interface) or a change in hand position on a virtual keyboard. Programmable vibro-tactile actuators aligned with each finger enrich the interface by creating the haptic sensations associated with control inputs, such as recoil of a button press...|$|R

An attempt {{has been made in}} this investigation to develop a predictive relationship between strength decrements and glove characteristics. Fifteen subjects participated in an experiment involving a grip and a grasp task with three gloves and a bare handed condition. Tenacity, snugness, suppleness and the material thickness were objectively measured as glove attributes. Significant Task and Glove effects were found. Results suggest that the glove size may not matter much in performance whereas resistance to sliding is an important performance determinant when using gloves. The results suggest that the strength decrements are complex functions of a number of glove attributes...|$|R
40|$|The Glove-Enabled Computer Operations (GECO) system enables an extravehicular {{activity}} (EVA) glove to be dual-purposed as a human-computer interface device. This paper describes {{the design and}} human participant testing of a right-handed GECO glove in a pressurized glove box. As part of {{an investigation into the}} usability of the GECO system for EVA data entry, twenty participants were asked to complete activities including (1) a Simon Says Games in which they attempted to duplicate random sequences of targeted finger strikes and (2) a Text Entry activity in which they used the GECO glove to enter target phrases in two different virtual keyboard modes. In a within-subjects design, both activities were performed both with and without vibrotactile feedback. Participants' mean accuracies in correctly generating finger strikes with the pressurized glove were surprisingly high, both with and without the benefit of <b>tactile</b> <b>feedback.</b> Five of the subjects achieved mean accuracies exceeding 99 % in both conditions. In Text Entry, <b>tactile</b> <b>feedback</b> provided a statistically significant performance benefit, quantified by characters entered per minute, as well as reduction in error rate. Secondary analyses of responses to a NASA Task Loader Index (TLX) subjective workload assessments reveal a benefit for <b>tactile</b> <b>feedback</b> in GECO <b>glove</b> use for data entry. This first-ever investigation of employment of a pressurized EVA glove for human-computer interface opens up a wide range of future applications, including text "chat" communications, manipulation of procedures/checklists, cataloguing/annotating images, scientific note taking, human-robot interaction, and control of suit and/or other EVA systems...|$|R

40|$|Extravehicular {{activities}} (EVAs) are {{a hazardous}} and expensive procedural method {{to operate in}} outer space. A possible support or alternative for manned missions in terms of on-orbit servicing are telemanipulation-systems. Whether or not such systems can actually achieve the efficiency of suited astronauts remains a central issue in telemanipulation research. Both scenarios, extravehicular activities as well as telemanipulation-systems, are restricted by different environmental factors, {{especially in terms of}} tasks that require fine motor skills. For suited astronauts, different factors, such as restricted mobility and reduced <b>tactile</b> <b>feedback</b> through the <b>gloves,</b> as well as a restricted field of view, impair fine motor skills. On the other hand, time delay, limited degrees of freedom and restricted haptic and visual feedback are amongst the factors, which may cause impairment of performance during the work with telemanipulation-systems. In order to compare the efficiency of both scenarios, a testbed equipped with typical mounting tasks was developed. An experimental study showed that the testbed is a valid measure of fine motor skills. In two followup studies, the influence of some factors debilitating fine motor performance in telemanipulation-systems and simulated extra-vehicular activities was analysed and compared...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. <b>Tactile</b> <b>feedback</b> on touch {{surfaces}} {{has shown}} to greatly improve the interaction in {{quantitative and qualitative}} metrics. Recently, researchers have assessed the notion of remote <b>tactile</b> <b>feedback,</b> i. e., the spatial separation of touch input and resulting tactile output on the user’s body. This approach {{has the potential to}} simplify the use of <b>tactile</b> <b>feedback</b> with arbitrary touch devices and allows the design of novel tactile stimuli by stimulus combination. However, a formal comparison of direct and remote <b>tactile</b> <b>feedback</b> during touch input is still missing. Therefore, we conducted three consecutive laboratory studies. First, we compared the effects of both direct and remote tactile stimuli on the user’s performance during touchscreen interactions. No difference was found in the positive effects of both types of feedback. Second, we evaluated the impact of the remote tactile actuator’s position on the user’s body. For remote tactile stimuli, we found improved accuracy and interaction speed, regardless of the body location. Third we analyzed remote <b>tactile</b> <b>feedback</b> under additional cognitive load. The results support the positive effects of <b>tactile</b> <b>feedback</b> on user performance and subjective evaluation. These findings encourage us to further exploit the potential of remote <b>tactile</b> <b>feedback</b> to simplify and expand the multimodal interaction with arbitrary touch interfaces...|$|R

40|$|Human rely profoundly on <b>tactile</b> <b>feedback</b> from {{fingertips}} {{to interact}} with the environment, whereas most hand prostheses used in clinics provide no <b>tactile</b> <b>feedback.</b> In this study we demonstrate the feasibility to use a tactile display glove that can be worn by a unilateral hand amputee on the remaining healthy hand to display <b>tactile</b> <b>feedback</b> from a hand prosthesis. The main benefit is that users could easily distinguish the feedback for each finger, even without training. The claimed advantage is supported by preliminary tests with healthy subjects.

40|$|AirTouch is a wrist-based gesture {{interface}} {{that enables}} mobile gesture interaction under limited visual attention settings. Since the original Gesture Watch lacked non- visual feedback, visual attention was required. AirTouch addresses this visual distraction issue by adding <b>tactile</b> <b>feedback.</b> The <b>tactile</b> <b>feedback</b> {{is supported by}} a new push-to- gesture (PTG) mechanism, which gives the user the ability to cancel the gesture input and causes less fatigue compared to the previous mechanism. A user study was conducted to observe the effect of the <b>tactile</b> <b>feedback</b> and the new PTG. The results show that the added <b>tactile</b> <b>feedback</b> enables more accurate and faster interaction. We also found that the <b>tactile</b> <b>feedback</b> successfully compensates for limited vision. The perceived difficulties and performance time with tactile display under limited vision was similar to having full visual attention without tactile display.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} finger-based text entry for mobile devices with touchscreens. Many devices are now coming to market that have no physical keyboards (the Apple iPhone being a very popular example). Touchscreen keyboards lack any <b>tactile</b> <b>feedback</b> and this may cause problems for entering text and phone numbers. We ran an experiment to compare devices with a physical keyboard, a standard touchscreen and a touchscreen with <b>tactile</b> <b>feedback</b> added. We tested this in both static and mobile environments. The {{results showed that the}} addition of <b>tactile</b> <b>feedback</b> to the touchscreen significantly improved fingerbased text entry, bringing it close to the performance of a real physical keyboard. A second experiment showed that higher specification tactile actuators could improve performance even further. The results suggest that manufacturers should use <b>tactile</b> <b>feedback</b> in their touchscreen devices to regain some of the feeling lost when interacting on a touchscreen with a finger.

40|$|Although touch screens {{have great}} input flexibility, they are largely {{inaccessible}} {{to people with}} visual impairment.

40|$|Touchscreen mobile devices, {{which do}} not have a {{physical}} keypad or keyboard, have become very popular. In these devices the interaction is done primarily with virtual buttons as all or most of the physical buttons have been removed. Due to this fact these devices have one major weakness compared to the traditional mobile devices: the lack of <b>tactile</b> <b>feedback.</b> This makes the mobile device usage challenging as the user can only rely on visual and audio feedback. Mobile devices are often used in situations where the user cannot devote all his visual attention to the device and the audio feedback cannot be heard. Therefore the absence of the tactility makes the mobile device usage difficult. Adding <b>tactile</b> <b>feedback</b> to touchscreens might solve this problem. This thesis researches how to design and implement <b>tactile</b> <b>feedback</b> for virtual buttons with the highest level of usability. The research compares two different actuators for producing <b>tactile</b> <b>feedback</b> on the touchscreen: a standard vibration motor and a piezo actuator.
