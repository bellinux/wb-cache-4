5|$|S (pronounced as Sandman) is a 2006 pseudo-documentary {{film that}} {{examines}} the underground subculture of horror films. It contains interviews with indie horror filmmakers and other horror experts, including Erik Marcisak, Bill Zebub, Fred Vogel, Carol J. Clover, and Debbie D., {{as well as}} a scripted plot <b>that</b> <b>comes</b> <b>into</b> focus in the film's second half.|$|E
5|$|Hot springs {{are closely}} {{associated}} with fumaroles, which are vents in an active volcanic area releasing steam and hot gases, such as sulfur dioxide. In general, the water is rotating groundwater <b>that</b> <b>comes</b> <b>into</b> contact with rocks heated by magma and finds openings to the surface. The formation of the springs depends both on the rocks the water has passed through and the profusion of volcanic discharges mixed with the groundwater. Iron oxide, iron sulfides and other substances usually colour pools of boiling mud brilliant yellow, red, brown or green. Hot springs comprising significantly softened silica may deposit it to form siliceous sinter, whereas those comprising softened calcium carbonate deposit spongy-looking calcareous rock called tufa. Overflow of the springs can build masses, spires or stepped terraces of calcareous sinter or tufa.|$|E

The towel used to wash one's hands should not be placed on the table, lest it and {{anything}} <b>that</b> <b>comes</b> <b>into</b> contact with it be rendered ritually unclean. Following the meal, all the crumbs in the dining room should be thoroughly swept up, then those involved should wash their hands.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{disadvantages}} of copper is its propensity to stain light-colored building materials, such as marble or limestone. Green staining is particularly visible on light-colored surfaces. Lead-coated copper {{can result in}} a black or gray stain that may blend well with lighter building materials. Staining can be reduced by collecting runoff in gutters and directing it away from the building via downspouts or by designing drip edges to help reduce the amount of copper laden moisture <b>that</b> <b>comes</b> <b>into</b> contact with material below. Coating the adjacent surface of the porous material with a clear silicone sealant also reduces staining. Staining may not develop in areas of rapid run-off due to the short dwell time of water on the copper.|$|E

"Ultraviolet" [...] is {{also one}} of several songs Bono has written on the theme of woman as spirit, and it echoes the band's 1980 song [...] "Shadows and Tall Trees" [...] by juxtaposing love with the image of ceilings. [...] A line in Raymond Carver's late 1980s poem [...] "Suspenders", about the quiet <b>that</b> <b>comes</b> <b>into</b> a house where no one can sleep, was subconsciously {{recycled}} by Bono into the lyric. [...] In Achtung Babys running order, [...] "Ultraviolet" [...] serves, with the other two songs at the album's end, [...] "Acrobat" [...] and [...] "Love Is Blindness", to explore how couples face the task of reconciling the suffering they have imposed on each other.|$|E
500|$|... "In Theory" [...] is the 25th {{episode of}} the [...] of the American science fiction {{television}} series , originally aired on June 3, 1991 in broadcast syndication. The episode was written by Joe Menosky and Ronald D. Moore and was the directorial debut of cast member Patrick Stewart. Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of {{the crew of the}} Federation starship Enterprise. In this episode, Data (Brent Spiner) accepts the affections of shipmate Jenna D'Sora (Michele Scarabelli) and pursues a romantic relationship with her. However, Jenna soon comprehends the downside of a [...] "programmed" [...] relationship. As the couple attempts to work out their problems, the Enterprise moves into an area of space rendered deadly by a nebula that is tearing small gaps in the fabric of space, deforming any matter <b>that</b> <b>comes</b> <b>into</b> contact with them.|$|E
500|$|Rit {{struggled}} to keep her family together as slavery threatened to tear it apart. Edward Brodess sold three of her daughters (Linah, Mariah Ritty, and Soph), separating them from the family forever. When a trader from Georgia approached Brodess about buying Rit's youngest son, Moses, she hid him for a month, aided by other slaves and free blacks in the community. At one point she confronted her owner about the sale. Finally, Brodess and [...] "the Georgia man" [...] came toward the slave quarters to seize the child, where Rit told them, [...] "You are after my son; but the first man <b>that</b> <b>comes</b> <b>into</b> my house, I will split his head open." [...] Brodess backed away and abandoned the sale. Tubman's biographers agree that stories told about this event within the family influenced her belief in the possibilities of resistance.|$|E

500|$|In the {{execution}} scene which follows, a theme emerges, the incessant repetition of which reminded Newman of the Transformation Music which separates {{the two parts}} of act1 in Wagner's Parsifal. In the final bars, as Tosca evades Spoletta and leaps to her death, the theme of [...] "E lucevan le stelle" [...] is played tutta forze (as loudly as possible). This choice of ending has been strongly criticised by analysts, mainly because of its specific association with Cavaradossi rather than Tosca. Joseph Kerman mocked the final music, [...] "Tosca leaps, and the orchestra screams the first thing <b>that</b> <b>comes</b> <b>into</b> its head." [...] Budden, however, argues that it is entirely logical to end this dark opera on its blackest theme. According to historian and former opera singer Susan Vandiver Nicassio: [...] "The conflict between the verbal and the musical clues gives {{the end of the}} opera a twist of controversy that, barring some unexpected discovery among Puccini's papers, can never truly be resolved." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the latter}} {{years of her}} time in the soap, Pauline changes from a caring mother into a more {{inflexible}} battle-axe. Pauline's relationship with Martin is often shown to be strained by Pauline's refusal to release control over his life. Though initially a teenage delinquent, following Mark's death in 2004, Martin becomes Pauline's [...] "dutiful son", forced to put his mother's wishes above those of his wife—a recurring theme within the serial. Eventually, this causes a rift between the two characters. When Martin goes against his mother's wishes in 2006 and rekindles a romance with his adulterous ex-wife Sonia, Pauline cuts him out of her life. Television personality Paul O'Grady addressed Pauline's refusal to [...] "share her son like a normal mother", commenting, [...] "she's suspicious of anybody <b>that</b> <b>comes</b> <b>into</b> the family who wants to take her son away from her. She has already lost one son; she has lost her husband, so she's hanging onto the last [...] like a mother tiger with her cub." ...|$|E
500|$|A Surtseyan {{eruption}} (or hydrovolcanic) {{is a type}} {{of volcanic}} eruption caused by shallow-water interactions between water and lava, named so after its most famous example, the eruption and formation of the island of Surtsey off the coast of Iceland in 1963. Surtseyan eruptions are the [...] "wet" [...] equivalent of ground-based Strombolian eruptions, but because of where they are taking place they are much more explosive. This is because as water is heated by lava, it flashes in steam and expands violently, fragmenting the magma it is in contact with into fine-grained ash. Surtseyan eruptions are the hallmark of shallow-water volcanic oceanic islands, however they are not specifically confined to them. Surtseyan eruptions can happen on land as well, and are caused by rising magma <b>that</b> <b>comes</b> <b>into</b> contact with an aquifer (water-bearing rock formation) at shallow levels under the volcano. The products of Surtseyan eruptions are generally oxidized palagonite basalts (though andesitic eruptions do occur, albeit rarely), and like Strombolian eruptions Surtseyan eruptions are generally continuous or otherwise rhythmic.|$|E

500|$|In {{anticipation}} of particularly high viewership {{due to the}} Super Bowl, NBC officials encouraged The Office producers to feature celebrity guest appearances in the episode. Jack Black, Jessica Alba and Cloris Leachman all made guest appearances in [...] "Stress Relief" [...] as a result. However, they do not interact with the cast and characters of The Office, but rather appear separately in a bootleg film called Mrs. Albert Hannaday, which the characters watch within the episode. Greg Daniels said this was done because it [...] "helps keep the show grounded and less like I Love Lucy". Lieberstein also said the casting decision made sense because, [...] "If we're just casting some salesman <b>that</b> <b>comes</b> <b>into</b> the office and it's Jack Black, it's hard to believe that." [...] "Stress Relief" [...] marked Black's fourth television appearance in five years: he previously appeared in the Fox sitcom Cracking Up in 2004, the Comedy Central series The Naked Trucker and T-Bones Show in 2004, and the Fox animated comedy series The Simpsons in 2007. Steve Carell said of Leachman's performance, [...] "She is that extra seasoning. That extra spice to the pot that makes for a delicious comedy gumbo." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{propagation}} of linga worship {{on a large}} scale in South India is believed to be from Chola times (late 7th century A.D.), through Rig veda, the oldest literature details about worshipping Shiva in the form of linga. [...] Pallavas propagated Somaskanda as the principal form of worship, slightly deviating from the Shaiva agamas; Cholas being strict shaivas, established lingams in all the temples. [...] The relation between Shiva and the lingam extends to the Indus Valley civilization, where several remains, such as the round stone caps at Harappa and the well-known seal of polycelphalic yogi (saint), have led scholars to attribute the primordial native origin. [...] Svayambu lingam indicates a lingam <b>that</b> <b>comes</b> <b>into</b> existence on its own accord and not erected by human beings. [...] Some of the temples are built around the lingam, with its position maintained as the sanctum.|$|E
