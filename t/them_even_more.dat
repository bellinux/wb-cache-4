5|$|He quickly formed another {{band called}} Sahara Dust, which later {{developed}} into the symphonic metal band Epica. His place {{was taken by}} Bas Maas, {{who had been the}} guitar technician for After Forever during the tours of 2001 and 2002. August and September 2002 were dedicated to a European tour, supporting Finnish act Nightwish and attending some rock festivals, which exposed the band to larger audiences and gained <b>them</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> favourable press. Further media exposure came from Floor Jansen's collaboration with Dutch multi-instrumentalist and composer Arjen Anthony Lucassen, for the recording of Star One's album Space Metal and the subsequent tour in late 2002. Jansen's activities, as well as the regular jobs and studies of the After Forever band members, reduced the band's live performances for the rest of 2002 and half of 2003. It was known that the band was working at a new album from the beginning of 2003, but their first release was the EP Exordium in October 2003, containing an instrumental track, three new songs and two covers.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} types of birds used in the game, distinguished by their color and shape. In the earliest levels only the basic red bird is available. As the player advances through the game additional types of birds become available. Some birds are effective against particular materials, and some have special abilities that may be activated by the player while the bird is airborne. For example, a yellow bird speeds up, a blue bird fragments into three birds, a black bird explodes, a white bird can drop an egg-shaped projectile, a pink bird can trap objects in bubbles, a green bird boomerangs back and an orange bird expands and inflates. The pigs also vary, with hardiness relative to their size. Small pigs are weaker and are easily vanquished by direct hits or by debris from the damaged structures, while larger pigs are able to withstand more damage before succumbing to defeat. In addition, some pigs wear hats or armor, making <b>them</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> resistant to damage.|$|E

In Figure 6, for example, which is magic on rows and columns only, the 16 pieces form a so-called Self-tiling tile set.

After the Harvey Houses closed in most cities, many former Girls (and today their daughters and granddaughters) joined in appreciation to carry on their legacy.|$|E
25|$|The Siberian Traps had unusual {{features}} that made <b>them</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> dangerous. Pure flood basalts produce fluid, low-viscosity lava {{and do not}} hurl debris into the atmosphere. It appears, however, that 20% of {{the output of the}} Siberian Traps eruptions was pyroclastic (consisted of ash and other debris thrown high into the atmosphere), increasing the short-term cooling effect. The basalt lava erupted or intruded into carbonate rocks and into sediments that {{were in the process of}} forming large coal beds, both of which would have emitted large amounts of carbon dioxide, leading to stronger global warming after the dust and aerosols settled.|$|E

25|$|Chipatá was {{the first}} {{settlement}} of the later New Kingdom of Granada, founded by Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada on March 8, 1537. Shortly after, the rested and reinforced troops set foot to higher terrains towards the south. Different from the scattered and unorganised indigenous groups they encountered before, advancing into the Muisca Confederation, they found a much better organised society and economy. The agriculture of the Muisca impressed the Spanish conquistadors and made <b>them</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> curious {{to find out who}} was the leader of the civilisation. While the Muisca regarded the European conquerors with distrust, they were also curious about them and where they came from.|$|E
25|$|The {{importance}} of tool use by woodpecker finch species differs between vegetation zones. In the arid zone, where food is limited {{and hard to}} access, tool use is essential, especially during the dry season. Up to half of the finches' prey is acquired {{with the help of}} tools, making <b>them</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> routine tool users than chimpanzees. The tools allow them to extract large, nutritious insect larvae from tree holes, making tool use more profitable than other foraging techniques. In contrast, in the humid zone, woodpecker finches rarely use tools, since food availability is high and prey is more easily obtainable. Here, the time and energy costs of tool use would be too high.|$|E
25|$|A {{meta-analysis}} of 208 experiments {{found that the}} mere-exposure effect is robust and reliable, with an effect size of r=0.26. This analysis found that the effect is strongest when unfamiliar stimuli are presented briefly. Mere exposure typically reaches its maximum effect within 10–20 presentations, and some studies even show that liking may decline after a longer series of exposures. For example, people generally like a song more after they have heard it a few times, but many repetitions can reduce this preference. A delay between exposure and the measurement of liking actually tends to increase {{the strength of the}} effect. The effect is weaker on children, and for drawings and paintings as compared to other types of stimuli. One social psychology experiment showed that exposure to people we initially dislike makes us dislike <b>them</b> <b>even</b> <b>more.</b>|$|E

25|$|Musashi {{spent many}} years {{studying}} Buddhism and swordsmanship. He was an accomplished artist, sculptor, and calligrapher. Records also show that he had architectural skills. Also, {{he seems to have}} had a rather straightforward approach to combat, with no additional frills or aesthetic considerations. This was probably due to his real-life combat experience; although in his later life, Musashi followed the more artistic side of bushidō. He made various Zen brush paintings, calligraphy, and sculpted wood and metal. Even in The Book of Five Rings he emphasizes that samurai should understand other professions as well. It should be understood that Musashi's writings were very ambiguous, and translating them into English makes <b>them</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> so; that is why so many different translations of The Book of Five Rings can be found. To gain further insight into Musashi's principles and personality, one could read his other works, such as Dokkodo and Hyoho Shiji ni Kajo.|$|E
25|$|Further explosions by {{two more}} torpedoes that hit under the second stack, port side (near frame 82 and about frame 85) {{less than two}} minutes later at about 0205 caused catastrophic and {{terminal}} damage. Men were thrown about twice with each following explosion and the force was greater the higher up in the ship's structure. This is the time that Carpenter was injured. The forward movement of the ship along with the massive structural frame damage caused the ship to twist and jackknife around the damaged area. The ship's momentum quickly fell off and began to flood. The center part twisted to 45 degrees port sinking first. It dragged the rear of the ship down until the stern was vertical. Men quickly realized that the damage was fatal and began to abandon ship. About 22 minutes after the ship was first hit the ship sunk, at about 0225. In the meantime, Carpenter - who had been wounded in the legs - and others of the crew abandoned ship by going over the side after cutting free all the surviving lift rafts into the ocean. Even though the forward momentum of the ship dropped off rapidly the survivors were scattered over several hundred yards, at night, amidst a raging naval battle.

500|$|The {{historian}} A.H.M. Jones {{observed that}} [...] "It is perhaps Diocletian's greatest achievement that he reigned twenty-one {{years and then}} abdicated voluntarily, and spent the remaining {{years of his life}} in peaceful retirement." [...] Diocletian {{was one of the few}} emperors of the third and fourth centuries to die naturally, and the first in the history of the empire to retire voluntarily. Once he retired, however, his tetrarchic system collapsed. Without the guiding hand of Diocletian, the empire fell into civil wars. Stability emerged after the defeat of Licinius by Constantine in 324. Under the Christian Constantine, Diocletian was maligned. Constantine's rule, however, validated Diocletian's achievements and the autocratic principle he represented: the borders remained secure, in spite of Constantine's large expenditure of forces during his civil wars; the bureaucratic transformation of Roman government was completed; and Constantine took Diocletian's court ceremonies and made <b>them</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> extravagant.|$|E
500|$|Congress had by the Act of March 3, 1863 {{authorized}} fractional {{currency in}} the denomination of 3 cents; when these notes reached circulation {{the following year}} they proved wildly unpopular. The 1864 law which had substituted bronze for copper-nickel had also outlawed [...] "copperheads" [...] or private token issues. Even though these could now only be issued anonymously, and so could not be redeemed, the copperheads were preferred to the 3-cent shinplasters. [...] Some copperhead tokens even read [...] "Substitute for shinplasters". The notes soon became filthy and ragged, making <b>them</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> disliked. They were more difficult to value in quantity than notes with denominations divisible by five. According to Walter Breen, [...] "This was the moment Wharton's supporters had been waiting for." [...] Wharton and his advocates argued that the three-cent notes should be redeemed with equivalent coins. They contended that were Congress to order a three-cent bronze coin, such a piece would {{be as big as}} an obsolete large cent, and might be used to deceive the blind into accepting the pre-1857 cent rather than the more valuable coin. Pollock, previously an opponent of nickel coinage, {{had a change of heart}} and became a supporter.|$|E
500|$|Rare Replay Nintendo 64 {{emulation}} pleased critics. Ars Technica {{wrote that}} the polygonal upgrades compensated for the [...] "blurry" [...] and [...] "pixelated" [...] source material, though the Nintendo 64 multiplayer modes lacked the frame rate upgrades that their single-player modes received. Kotaku noted that the Xbox One had more Nintendo 64 re-releases than Nintendo's Wii U Virtual Console. Its reviewer found the in-game Xbox One button prompts to be [...] "delightful anachronisms". Ars Technica reviewer commended Rare's choice of the Nintendo 64 version of Conker's Bad Fur Day over its updated but censored Xbox re-release. Initial reviews found Jet Force Gemini unplayable without dual thumbstick controls, which were later added. While Machkovech (Ars Technica) considered Rare's Microsoft games to the weakest of the lot, Whitehead (Eurogamer) found <b>them</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> enjoyable {{in the context of}} Rare Replay. Reviewers noted frame rate and technical issues in the Xbox 360 emulation and did not like its separation {{from the rest of the}} compilation. Kollar (Polygon) called the Xbox 360 game installation process needlessly complex, and Marty Sliva (IGN) did not like how the Xbox 360 startup sequence interrupted the compilation's cohesion. He added that the emulated Xbox 360 experience was subpar compared to the unemulated experience.|$|E

500|$|The Shreveport Pirates were {{actually}} a transplantation of Bernie Glieberman and his organization from Ottawa. The Gliebermans had hinted at moving the Rough Riders to the United States, making <b>them</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> unpopular than they already were in Canada's capital. [...] As {{part of a}} settlement with the CFL, Glieberman sold the Rough Riders to Bruce Firestone for CAN$1.85 million, and in return was granted a US-based expansion team which became the Shreveport Pirates. As part of the deal, Glieberman not only had to pay the expansion fee, but also had to settle his previous Ottawa debts. [...] There was a groundswell of local support for the team but also significant difficulties in their first year: stifling weather, cultural clashes, organizational screw-ups, and serious hints of under-capitalization (during training camp the team was housed in a dorm above a milking barn). A woeful record did not help: the team lost their first 14 games. The {{end of the season}} showed promise for the team, as it finished its last four games with a 3–1 record; once the team was finally winning, attendance also jumped, and the home finale drew over 32,000 fans to 40,000-seat Independence Stadium, the highest for any U.S.-hosted CFL game outside Baltimore.|$|E
500|$|Legend of Mana {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. The game's presentation was almost universally praised, especially {{its use of}} vibrant and colorful hand-drawn graphics. David Smith of IGN claimed that the graphics {{were one of the}} game's best points, and RPGamer's Andrew P. Bilyk noted that the visuals [...] "may be the most impressive two-dimensional graphics ever to grace an RPG". Andrew Pfister of Electronic Gaming Monthly praised <b>them</b> <b>even</b> <b>more,</b> calling them [...] "the most impressive 2D artwork ever seen on a console". Damian Thomas's RPGFan review likened the graphics to Disney animation for having [...] "a very storybook, cutesy cartoony feel to them", while Andrew Vestal of GameSpot said that the graphics were some of the most lush and ornate 2D graphics ever made. The game won an award for best graphics at the 4th Japan Game Awards from the Computer Entertainment Supplier's Association. The music in Legend of Mana was also a high point in many reviews; the reviewers for Electronic Gaming Monthly called it [...] "fantastic" [...] and [...] "wonderful". Smith of IGN's review stated that the soundtrack is [...] "as good as any you'll hear today" [...] with a good mix of intensity, suspense, and subtle nuance, and Vestal of GameSpot termed it [...] "excellently orchestrated" [...] and a perfect fit for the game in each environment.|$|E

[...] As a result, only Simonon, Jones and Strummer were featured on the album's cover, and Chimes was credited as [...] "Tory Crimes". Strummer later described what followed: [...] "We must have tried every drummer that then had a kit. I mean every drummer in London. I think we counted 205. And that's why we were lost until we found Topper Headon." [...] Headon, who had played briefly with Jones's London SS, was nicknamed [...] "Topper" [...] by Simonon, who felt he resembled the Topper comic book character Mickey the Monkey. An excellent musician, Headon could also play piano, bass and guitar. The day after he signed up, he declared, [...] "I really wanted to join the Clash. I want to give <b>them</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> energy than they've got—if that's possible"; interviewed over two decades later, he said his original plan was to stay briefly, gain a name for himself, {{and then move on}} to a better gig.
