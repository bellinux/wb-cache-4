5|$|Thomcord grape is {{a hybrid}} of Thompson Seedless grape (Vitis vinifera, or Sultanina), which is popular in {{supermarkets}} during the summer, and seeded Concord grape (Vitis labrusca), commonly used to make grape juice and jelly.

It has an aromatic flavor, similar to the Concord in taste ("labrusca"), though lighter due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sweet,</b> mild taste from Thompson Seedless.|$|E

40|$|Preference for a {{solution}} of a particular sweetness is increased by its previous association with postingestive effects of 10 % glucose or polysaccharide solutions. Sweetness acceptance is decreased by previous association with 25 %- 50 % glucose solutions.

This reversal is initially facilitated, but after some days attenuated, by {{a high proportion of}} carbohydrate in the diet. The reversal extinguishes over a few days without reinforcement. Expression of <b>the</b> relative aversion <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sweeter</b> solution is not dependent on immediately prior carbohydrate ingestion (unlike sickly taste in man). Such conditioned attractions and aversions may assist normal caloric regulation...|$|R
