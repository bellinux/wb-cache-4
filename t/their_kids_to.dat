5|$|Victor Fresco, the show's creator, has cited {{his being}} a new parent as {{inspiration}} for the show. In an interview with NPR, he discussed how having a kid piqued his interest to develop a show about the disconnection between a person's public and personal lives, such as how parents teach <b>their</b> <b>kids</b> <b>to</b> be moral, yet work for giant corporations. According to Fresco, Ted Crisp is the single father and his daughter serves as his moral compass. Fresco stated that since he's worked for a few giant companies, he didn't base Veridian Dynamics on any specific corporation. The show's name {{was based on the}} idea that a person is better off if they are Ted, that essentially the average person wants to be Ted. Fresco has stated that he wasn't a fan of the show's title, but hadn't spoken of changing it.|$|E
25|$|After the {{specific}} threat against children was delivered, many school groups curtailed field trips and outdoors athletic activities based upon safety concerns. At {{the height of}} the public fear, some school districts, such as Henrico County Public Schools and Hanover County Public Schools, after the Ponderosa shooting, simply closed school for the day. Other schools such as the MJBHA, cancelled all outdoor activities after the shooting at the Connecticut and Aspen Hill intersection. Others changed after-school procedures for parents to pick up <b>their</b> <b>kids</b> <b>to</b> minimize the amount of time children spent in the open. Extra police officers were placed in schools because of this fear. In addition to this, Joel Schumacher's film Phone Booth was deemed potentially upsetting enough that its release was delayed for months.|$|E

60|$|This {{advice of}} the Spaniard's I {{approved}} extremely; and so satisfied was I of his fidelity that I esteemed him ever after. And thus we all four went to work upon some more land, and against seed time we had gotten so much cured and trimmed up sufficient to sow twenty-two bushels of barley on, and sixteen jars of rice, which was in short all the feed we had to spare. As we were four in number and by this time all in good health, we feared not a hundred Indians should they venture to attack us; and while the corn was growing, I pitched upon some trees, fit to build us a large vessel in case the Spaniards came over; which being marked, I ordered Friday and his father to cut them down, appointing the Spaniard, who was now my privy counsellor, to oversee and direct the work. I likewise increased my flocks of goats by shooting the wild dams and bringing home <b>their</b> <b>kids</b> <b>to</b> my inclosure. Nor did I neglect the grape season, but cured them as usual, though I had such a quantity now as would have filled eighty barrels with raisins. And thus all of us being employed, they in working, and I in providing for them till harvest came, God Almighty blessed the increase of it so much, that from twenty-two barrels of barley we thrashed out two hundred and twenty, and the like quantity of rice; sufficient to victual a ship fit to carry me and all the Spaniards to any part of America.|$|E
