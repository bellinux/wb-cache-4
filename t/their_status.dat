5|$|One Hot Minute is {{the sixth}} studio album by the American rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers, {{released}} on September 12, 1995, on Warner Bros. Records. The worldwide {{success of the}} band's previous album, Blood Sugar Sex Magik (1991), caused guitarist John Frusciante to become uncomfortable with <b>their</b> <b>status,</b> eventually quitting mid-tour in 1992.|$|E

5|$|Three types {{have been}} {{documented}} in the Antarctic. Two dwarf species, named Orcinus nanus and Orcinus glacialis, were described during the 1980s by Soviet researchers, but most cetacean researchers are skeptical about <b>their</b> <b>status,</b> and linking these directly to the types described below is difficult.|$|E

5|$|According to the IUCN, 97 {{freshwater}} fish species from the Western Ghats were considered threatened in 2011, including 12 critically endangered, 54 endangered and 31 vulnerable. All but one (Tor khudree) {{of these are}} endemic to the Western Ghats. An additional 26 species from the region are considered data deficient (<b>their</b> <b>status</b> is unclear at present). The primary threats are from habitat loss, but also from overexploitation and introduced species.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} United kicked off their final home {{game of the}} season, Arsenal had {{recorded}} a tenth straight league victory at home to Everton and ensured <b>their</b> <b>status</b> as champions {{for the first time}} in seven years. Frenchman Arsène Wenger also became the first foreign manager to get his hands on the coveted trophy since its inception, in only his first full campaign. He completed a double three weeks later by winning the FA Cup, regarded by many fans and pundits alike as unthinkable given the circumstances four months ago.|$|E
5|$|In 1898, the Philippines was ceded by Spain to the United States and, after a {{conflict}} between Philippine independence forces and the United States, Filipinos were allowed to immigrate freely to the United States as U.S. nationals. Most immigrants chose to settle in the Territory of Hawaii and the West coast. In 1934, U.S. policy changed and <b>their</b> <b>status</b> as nationals was revoked.|$|E

5|$|In December 1946, the {{government}} of Camille Huysmans inaugurated a medal to be awarded to {{former members of the}} resistance and bestowed various other benefits on other members, including pensions and a scheme of state-funded apprenticeships. Individuals were accorded military rank equivalent to <b>their</b> <b>status</b> in the movement during the war, entitling them to title and other privileges. Today the role of the resistance during the conflict is commemorated by memorials, plaques and road names across the country, {{as well as by the}} National Museum of the Resistance in Anderlecht.|$|E
5|$|In Tactics Advance, turn-based {{tactical}} battles {{take place}} on a three-dimensional isometric field. The player takes the role of Marche, a clan leader; he must organize the clan's members and advance <b>their</b> <b>status</b> through missions that are offered in pubs. The player competes against the computer's team in turn-based play, although unlike Final Fantasy Tactics characters execute their actions instantly.|$|E
5|$|Laurie Mains {{replaced}} Wyllie in 1992, and {{was given}} the job of preparing the side for the 1995 event in South Africa. New Zealand were again one of the favourites to take the championship. <b>Their</b> <b>status</b> as favourites was enhanced when a young Jonah Lomu scored four tries against England in the 45–29 semi-final win. They managed to take hosts South Africa to extra time in the final, before losing 15-12 to Joel Stransky's drop goal.|$|E

5|$|Nobles, {{who were}} {{believed}} to be direct descendants of the descended person from heaven, lived in tongkonans, while commoners lived in less lavish houses (bamboo shacks called banua). Slaves lived in small huts, which had to be built around their owner's tongkonan. Commoners might marry anyone, but nobles preferred to marry in-family to maintain <b>their</b> <b>status.</b> Sometimes nobles married Bugis or Makassarese nobles. Commoners and slaves were prohibited from having death feasts. Despite close kinship and status inheritance, there was some social mobility, as marriage or change in wealth could affect an individuals status. Wealth was counted by the ownership of water buffaloes.|$|E

5|$|Researchers have {{discovered}} archaeological evidence of musical instruments {{in many parts}} of the world. Some finds are 67,000 years old, however <b>their</b> <b>status</b> as musical instruments is often in dispute. Consensus solidifies about artifacts dated back to around 37,000 years old and later. Only artifacts made from durable materials or using durable methods tend to survive. As such, the specimens found cannot be irrefutably placed as the earliest musical instruments.|$|E
5|$|Since 1977, Elizabeth II {{has been}} a patron of the Society, and during the Society's centenary year of 1984 she acted as its president. The British Cleveland Bay Horse Society also {{maintains}} a separate registry for part-bred horses. In the late 20th century, the breed again gained {{the attention of the}} United States public, and in 1985 the US association was reactivated, renamed the Cleveland Bay Society of North America. The US American Livestock Breeds Conservancy considers <b>their</b> <b>status</b> to be critical, which means there is an estimated global population of less than 2,000, and fewer than 200annual registrations in the United States. The UK Rare Breeds Survival Trust also considers <b>their</b> <b>status</b> to be critical, with less than 300breeding females registered worldwide. The Equus Survival Trust also considers the breed population to be at critical levels, meaning there are between 100 and 300breeding females left in the world. Currently, there are about 135purebred horses in the US and Canada recorded with the North American registry. There are also small populations in Japan, New Zealand, and Australia. In 2006, an estimated 550Cleveland Bay horses existed worldwide, of which about 220 were mares; the 2005 foal crop produced fewer than 50horses.|$|E
5|$|The annual {{incidence}} in Canada of genital herpes due to HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection {{is not known}} (for a review of HSV-1/HSV-2 prevalence and incidence studies worldwide, see Smith and Robinson 2002). As many as one in seven Canadians aged 14 to 59 may be infected with herpes simplex type 2 virus and more than 90 per cent of them may be unaware of <b>their</b> <b>status,</b> a new study suggests. In the United States, {{it is estimated that}} about 1,640,000 HSV-2 seroconversions occur yearly (730,000 men and 910,000 women, or 8.4 per 1,000 persons).|$|E

5|$|The {{enthusiasm for}} relics continued, and foundations' {{prestige}} was greatly increased by success in obtaining {{the remains of}} important saints. The period between the Benedictine Reform and the Norman Conquest saw the most lavish donations of land to monasteries of any period in medieval England, and the leading reformed foundations became immensely wealthy, retaining <b>their</b> <b>status</b> after the Conquest. Monasteries founded in the Anglo-Saxon period enjoyed greater prosperity and prestige than post-Conquest establishments.|$|E
5|$|The world's first {{international}} football match {{was a challenge}} match played in Glasgow in 1872 between Scotland and England, which ended in a 0–0 draw. The {{first international}} tournament, the inaugural edition of the British Home Championship, took place in 1884. As football grew in popularity {{in other parts of}} the world at the turn of the 20th century, it was held as a demonstration sport with no medals awarded at the 1900 and 1904 Summer Olympics (however, the IOC has retroactively upgraded <b>their</b> <b>status</b> to official events), and at the 1906 Intercalated Games.|$|E
