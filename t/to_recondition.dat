5|$|On 13 December, the 6th Panzer Division {{made contact}} with the Soviet 5th Tank Army, which was engaged in the {{reduction}} of German defenses around the Chir River. German forces were able to engage and defeat Soviet armor, as the former forced the crossing of the Alksay River. At this point, a major armored battle began around the village of Verkhne-Kumskiy. Although they sustained heavy losses, the Soviet forces were able to push German forces back to {{the banks of the}} Alksay River {{by the end of the}} day, while failing to retake the town. However, the losses sustained by the Red Army in the vicinity of Verkhne-Kumskiy allowed the 6th Panzer Division to enjoy a brief superiority in tank numbers thereafter. Fighting for Verkhne-Kumskiy continued for three days, as the Red Army launched a series of counterattacks against the German bridgeheads across the Alksay River and German defenders in the town. German defenders were able to pin Soviet tanks in Verkhne-Kumskiy and destroy them using well emplaced anti-tank artillery guns. With heavy support from the Luftwaffe, the Germans were able to achieve a local success and began to push toward the Myshkova river. The 6th Panzer Division took heavy losses during its drive, and took a brief respite after the battle <b>to</b> <b>recondition.</b> Minor damage to surviving tanks was repaired and the majority of the tanks incapacitated during the fighting at Verkhne-Kumskiy were brought back to serviceable conditions.|$|E

25|$|In {{the mid-1950s}} the church decided <b>to</b> <b>recondition</b> the organ. After {{reviewing}} several bids, its Music Committee decided to award {{the contract to}} the M. P. Moller company, with a plan for further extensions of the organ. The reconditioned organ was dedicated in 1956 with a recital including Johann Sebastian Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D minor. Its console is still in use, after many emergency repairs. A Wicks choir division was added in the next decade.|$|E
50|$|Repair {{is a type}} of precycling that corrects {{specified}} faults in a product, {{however the}} quality of a repaired product is inferior <b>to</b> <b>reconditioned</b> or remanufactured items. One survey found that 68% of the respondents believed repairing was not cost efficient and sought alternative methods such as reconditioning or remanufacturing.|$|R
5000|$|Each semester, cadets {{must pass}} two {{athletic}} fitness tests: a 1.5 mi run to measure aerobic fitness, and a 15-minute, 5-event, physical fitness test consisting of pull-ups, a standing long jump, sit-ups, push-ups and a 600 yd sprint. [...] Failure {{to pass a}} fitness test usually results in the cadet being assigned <b>to</b> <b>reconditioning</b> until he can pass the test. Repeated failures can lead to disenrollment.|$|R
40|$|The {{problems}} {{and benefits of}} deep <b>reconditioning</b> <b>to</b> near Earth orbit missions with high cycle life and shallow discharge depth requirements is discussed. A simple battery level approach <b>to</b> deep <b>reconditioning</b> of nickel cadmium batteries in near Earth orbit is considered. A test plan was developed <b>to</b> perform deep <b>reconditioning</b> in direct comparison with an alternative trickle charge approach. The results demonstrate that the deep reconditioning procedure described for near Earth orbit application is inferior to the alternative of trickle charging...|$|R
25|$|Grooming {{attachments}} – Attachments {{for large}} groomers include: a front blade, a tiller, a renovator and track setter. The leading front blade repositions snow {{in front of}} the machine for trailing equipment <b>to</b> <b>recondition.</b> The renovator digs into the snow pack to aerate and mix the old and new snow up to 30cm deep, as needed. The tiller attached behind the machine conditions the snow into aa soft, granular consistency, ready for its comb, which packs the snow into a finished surface. For setting classic tracks, the groomer trails special pans, which mould the tracks. Attachments for snowmobiles perform the same functions at a smaller scale and include a roller to compact the snow over a wide swath and a drag to level the snow behind the roller.|$|E
25|$|In {{compensation}} {{for the loss of}} his see, Ghenadie was appointed a lifetime Starets of his place of exile, with a special law passed in 1909. He took an active part in restoring and refurbishing the monastery complex, which had been heavily damaged by time, and intervened on sites outside his jurisdiction. Early on, in 1904, he intervened at Zamfira Monastery, where he demanded that the murals done by painter Nicolae Grigorescu be covered up with tempera artwork—his order was obeyed, and the result {{remains one of the most}} controversial acts. Some have described it as virtually an act of vandalism, and, 50 years later, the process was reverted on church orders. Ghenadie requested, and received, King Carol's patronage for the Căldărușani restoration works (begun in 1908), and hired artist D. Belizarie <b>to</b> <b>recondition</b> its archaic murals. In 1915, he personally oversaw the festive reopening of Căldărușani Church.|$|E

A rude shock to Surrey was to come, however.|$|R
50|$|In the {{automotive}} repair industry, many consumers purchase brake pads with a lifetime warranty. These pads use a much harder lining than traditional brake pads {{and tend to}} cause excessive wear of the much more expensive rotors or drums. For that reason, consumers should ensure that the new brake pads installed are those specified or supplied by the vehicle's manufacturer. Relined brake pads are usually inexpensive and perfectly acceptable, with new lining material attached <b>to</b> <b>reconditioned</b> (cleaned, inspected and painted) backing assemblies.|$|R
500|$|The First World War [...] "reinforced {{the sense}} of Britishness" [...] and patriotism in the early 20th century. Through war service (including {{conscription}} in Great Britain), [...] "the English, Welsh, Scots and Irish fought as British". The aftermath of the war institutionalised British national commemoration through Remembrance Sunday and the Poppy Appeal. The Second World War had a similar unifying effect upon the British people, however, its outcome was <b>to</b> <b>recondition</b> Britishness on a basis of democratic values and its marked contrast to Europeanism. Notions that the British [...] "constituted an Island race, and that it stood for democracy were reinforced {{during the war and}} they were circulated in the country through Winston Churchill's speeches, history books and newspapers".|$|E
500|$|Five {{years after}} Trujillo's death, the ship, now named Patria, {{was sold to}} Operation Sea Cruises, Inc. in 1966. Company {{president}} John Blue registered her in Panama and sent her to Naples, Italy, <b>to</b> <b>recondition</b> and outfit her for charters. Sold to Antarna Inc., Miami, in 1969 the ship was renamed Antarna. Blue brought the vessel to the United States, but port authorities docked the boat after a dispute in Colón, Panama. Charles and Stephanie Gallagher paid the fees to get the ship free and set her to sea, even though Blue still held the ship's papers. The two dreamed of making the ship an [...] "oceanic school" [...] where students would supplement their traditional learning with at-sea education. Blue eventually retrieved his ship after a confrontation in Panama.|$|E

She could not be refloated and so was {{stripped}} and dismantled. Now short of a first rate, the Admiralty decided <b>to</b> <b>recondition</b> Victory. Work started in 1800, but as it proceeded, an increasing number of defects were found and the repairs developed into a very extensive reconstruction. The original estimate was £23,500, but the final cost was £70,933.|$|E
2500|$|With the {{outbreak}} of World War II in 1939, shipping losses caused by U-boats created an increased demand for tonnage. To help meet this demand, the U.S. Maritime Commission (successor to the Shipping Board), {{in addition to its}} orders for new tonnage, decided <b>to</b> <b>recondition</b> and return to service a number of old Shipping Board vessels laid up between the wars. In July 1940, it was announced that West Elcasco would be reconditioned and placed back into service along with nine other ships, including four more Skinner & Eddy-built ships, Eldena, Polybius and West Elcascos sister ships [...] and , all of which had spent {{the latter part of the}} 1930s laid up at New Orleans.|$|E
2500|$|Before {{and during}} the early 19th century, much of {{continental}} European agriculture was underdeveloped compared to Asian Cores and England. This left Europe with abundant idle natural resources. England, on the other hand, had reached the limit of its agricultural productivity well {{before the beginning of}} the 19th century. [...] Rather than taking the costly route of improving soil fertility, the English increased labor productivity by industrializing agriculture. [...] From 1750 to 1850, European nations experienced population booms; however, [...] European agriculture was barely able {{to keep pace with the}} dietary needs. Imports from the Americas, and the reduced caloric intake required by industrial workers compared to farmers allowed England to cope with the food shortages. By the turn of the 19th century, much European farmland had been eroded and depleted of nutrients. [...] Fortunately, through improved farming techniques, the import of fertilizers, and reforestation, Europeans were able <b>to</b> <b>recondition</b> their soil and prevent food shortages from hampering industrialization. Meanwhile, many other formerly hegemonic areas of the world were struggling to feed themselves– notably China.|$|E
