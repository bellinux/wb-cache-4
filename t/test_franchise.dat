40|$|Franchising is a {{business}} form where an organization, or franchisor, with a market-tested business model enters into a contractual relationship with franchisees, independent firms which operate under the franchisor’s trade name using this proven business model. Different types of franchises include service franchises, product franchises, and distribution franchises. Franchising is a replication strategy that allows the franchisor to grow and penetrate new markets with less investment of its own capital than would be required for other forms of expansion. It also reduces some of the risk associated with starting {{a business}} for the franchisee as it builds on a model {{that has already been}} <b>tested.</b> <b>Franchising</b> has been applied to social enterprises as well as private enterprises. Franchising can enhance social enterprises by helping them achieve economies of scale that contribute to their viability and profit and by enabling replication that increases their scale and social impact.

40|$|Today’s {{business}} environment {{is undergoing a}} fundamental transformation {{as the result of}} globalization. In this constantly changing new world, it is important for companies to understand the behavioral role of management and organizations. The main challenge for global companies are to develop managers that are capable of working across cultures and who are competent in international business. Franchising is today a widespread entry mode and has become a cornerstone for companies who want to expand into foreign countries. It also helps companies to adapt to different cultures and business regulations. There are many advantages with franchising as an entry mode, such as the ability to expand the company rapidly and the spreading of risks and costs across the network. Although franchising is a popular market entry strategy for international companies, the research community has only recently begun to examine franchising within the context of internationalization. Research on international franchising has been dominated by studies on how companies, that have built domestic franchising business, bring their tried and <b>tested</b> <b>franchising</b> concept into the global market. A corporate culture is the personality of a franchise’s business and is reflected in its image, services and values. Culture is about how a franchise’s members act and interact and the right culture may create an environment that each individual within the company supports. One issue for the franchisor is to choose the right franchisee that will adopt the franchisors wide perspective and maintain the objectives. The relationship between the franchisor and the franchisee is what makes international franchising a unique form of business, and it also provides a strategic advantage over competitors in the market. It is important for both the franchisors and the franchisee to remember that the franchised company’s success almost entirely depends upon the strength of their relationship.

5000|$|... 17 (Franchised public bus) — This is {{obtained}} through training within a franchised bus company, for example, Kowloon Motor Bus. The driving test requirement {{is the same}} with public bus (class 10), and is only retained with historical interest. A driver passing a <b>test</b> on a <b>franchised</b> bus will be issued classes 4, 9, 10 in addition to 17, and 5 after taking an additional Pre-service Training Course for Public Light Bus Drivers, enabling him/her to drive any public buses, whereas a driver holding class 10 (public bus) licence can also drive franchised public bus. Class 17 exists because the government had to protect the interests of franchised bus companies, in the past, drivers trained by a franchised bus company could only get a class 17 licence, enabling him/her to drive franchised public bus only but not other public buses. This has been relaxed such that a driver passing <b>test</b> on a <b>franchised</b> public bus can get classes 9, 10 in addition to class 17, and original drivers holding class 17 without classes 9, 10 can also apply them for free without taking tests.|$|R
40|$|The {{costs of}} linking {{customers}} {{with the public}} switched telephone network have been ill-defined as costs common to all telecommunications services, argued Alfred E. Kahn and William B. Shew here in 1987. Now as the pace of change in telecommunications accelerates, Steve Parsons argues that the proper assignment of these so-called loop costs is increasingly important, since it affects many areas of public network law and policy, including rate-setting, cross-subsidy <b>tests,</b> and <b>franchise</b> obligations. Parsons argues in favor of Kahn and Shew 2 ̆ 7 s position and poses eight additional arguments for attributing loop costs directly to the provision of access to the network. He traces the misclassification of loop costs to careless nomenclature, misapplied microeconomics, and the merging of inconsistent concepts and arguments. He suggests how and why telecommunications policy, as it evolves, must embrace loop costs as attributable to their own service rather than allocated to other network-using services...|$|R

40|$|This report {{describes}} and {{evaluates the}} present state of the Chilean infrastructure concessions program. This program is leading to a complete upgrade of Chile's highway system and has been recently extended to seaports. The main principles underlying the economics of franchising are examined and used to evaluate the programof privatizations of highways and seaports. Compared with experiences in other countries, theresults are fairly good. The infrastructure deficit has been greatly reduced, innovative ideas have been used successfully and several pitfalls have beenavoided. However, since franchise terms are long, the final verdict will not be in for at least a decade. The main shortcoming of the program of highway franchising is that the state granted generous minimum traffic guarantees, which may create fiscal problems in the future and may have weakened the market <b>test</b> that <b>franchising</b> is supposed to provide. This problem may become increasingly important as most projects to be auctioned in the future are not profitable privately and must therefore be subsidized to be undertaken. Related to the latter, privatization of infrastructure has been carried out without creating a regulatory framework and institutions, while regulatory con icts of interest have been ignored. This issue gained widespread attention recently, when a franchise holder ran into financial problems and failed to meet contract deadlines. The Ministry of Public Works, which both promotes and regulates the concessions program, renegotiated the contract with the franchise holder behind closed doors. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is based}} {{in the field of}} international retailing and in particular, the value and challenges associated with employing franchising as a vehicle for international retail expansion. Its focus is on The Boots Group (TBG) and specifically its loss-making subsidiary BRI (Boots Retail International). Despite its loss- making label, BRI is currently enjoying a significant upturn in fortune,on the back of very positive profitable growth figures, which have generated an increased enthusiasm for expanding the number of markets BRI is currently actively trading in. This has lead to the challenge of investigating whether BRI should develop a retail business format franchise for application as a relatively risk free method of market entry and if so what market offers the best option for <b>testing</b> this <b>franchise</b> system. The methodology for the research used to answering this challenge utilises, a literature review and contemporary practitioner interviews, to establish and refine a series of hypotheses for the factors critical to successful franchising. These factors are tested against the Boots retail model to provide an insight into the feasibility, benefits and risks of its use as the basis for a franchise system. Having established the potential value of developing a franchise system the study looks at the factors which characterise successful franchise markets and, using quantitative data, partially validates an internal belief that the Middle East markets, specifically the GCC present the best opportunity for testing the system. Further data is then gathered utilising inputs from potential franchisees to complete a full strategic market analysis and operating model for a Boots franchise system in the region. This study concludes that Boots should, through BRI, develop a retail franchise system and that this system should be tested in the GCC markets as a prelude to a full roll out in this market and its application as a model of market entry which compliments the existing implant strategy being used to great effect within BRI...|$|R

Previous researches about franchising have considerably contributed to better understanding of relationships between franchisor and franchise. However, the franchisor-franchise relationship {{has yet to be}} fully explored, knowledge of the factors that produce a high quality relationship between franchisor and franchise are critical to the advancement of knowledge in the retail industry. Leader-Member Exchange (LMX) theory is offered of an effective theoretical model of antecedents that can predict the effectiveness the franchisor-franchise relationship. The model proposed has been <b>tested</b> with 500 <b>franchises</b> operating in the retail (fashion, food and beverage) in the Vietnamese franchised distribution system. The results of this study generally support the hypothesized model and strongly support for the idea that the quality of the relationship will lead to higher level of franchise’s job satisfaction, performance business, trust and commitment. This study also confirms the importance of the franchisor’s support and mediating role of trust and commitment to the success of franchising relationship. Finally, this study provides franchisors with valuable information for establishing an effective management to improve the relationship between franchisor and franchise and thus improves the rate of success of both franchise and franchisor...|$|R
40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Hotel, Restaurant, Institution Management and DieteticsSooCheong JangDeborah D. CanterIn {{the last}} few decades, {{franchising}} has {{become a part of}} everyday life in the United States. Many firms in a variety of industries have adopted franchising as a method of doing business. Despite the importance of franchising, the literature on why firms initially choose to franchise and how franchising affects financial performance has been scant (Combs et al., 2004; Watson et al., 2005). The purposes of this study were 1) to examine how well agency theory, resource scarcity theory, risk-sharing theory, and specific knowledge theory justify the franchising decision, 2) to investigate whether franchising affects restaurant firms' market value and profitability, and 3) to investigate the relationship between the ownership mix, combination of franchised and company-owned outlets, and financial performance. For the statistical analysis, the data were collected from the Standard and Poor's COMPUSTAT database, Bond's Franchise Guide and 10 K reports. A logistic regression model was developed to identify a set of variables that best differentiated firms engaged in franchise contracts from those that were not. The statistical results indicated that: 1) Young and growing firms used franchise more to increase the flow of resources. This result supported resource scarcity theory. 2) The degree of geographic dispersion and involvement in foreign countries increased the probability of a firm's decision to franchise. These results supported agency theory. 3) The decrease of specific knowledge requirements increased the franchising probability. This result supported specific knowledge theory. T-tests and multivariate regression models were used to <b>test</b> how <b>franchising</b> affects firms' financial performance. The findings indicated that 1) franchised firms had better financial performance than non-franchised firms, 2) the relationship between ownership mix and financial performance was curvilinear and the inverted U-shaped relationship suggested the existence of optimal ownership mix that can maximize a firm's financial performance, and 3) ownership mix not only directly affected a firm's intangible assets, but also indirectly affected a firm's intangible assets through advertising. This study found that a purely company owned or a purely franchised chain did not produce the best financial performance. Restaurant companies could use both company-owned and franchised units to leverage the strengths of one another, which will yield a better overall financial performance than if either structure was to operate alone...|$|R
