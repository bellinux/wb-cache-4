40|$|Our aim is {{to provide}} review of {{available}} studies on Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) and discuss treatment for polyostotic monosystem form of disease based on our clinical experience. LCH is an enigmatic disease with insufficiently understood etiology, pathophysiology, and variety of clinical presentations ranging from solitary eosinophilic granuloma to severe multisystem disease. It is marked by formation of granuloma in practically any organ. We present rare case of multifocal bone disease in 36 -year old patient without visceral involvement. Treatment protocols for adult LCH patients, especially for uncommon form in our case {{have not yet been}} defined. Our <b>therapeutical</b> <b>trial</b> with corticosteroids showed limited success with numerous side-effects. We conclude that LCH treatment can commence only after diagnosis and staging of the disease. Other factors like patient’s age, comorbidity, general condition, severity of symptoms and contraindications for therapy modalities should also be considered. In our experience expectative approach has better clinical outcome than immunosuppressive therapy in patients suffering from polyostotic multifocal form LCH with mild symptoms...|$|E
40|$|Se realizó un ensayo clinicoterapéutico controlado en 50 pacientes egresados, luego de haber sufrido un estado de mal asmático y sin que hubiesen sido tratados profilácticamente durante el año anterior. Quedaron distribuidos al azar en 2 grupos: uno recibió tratamiento profiláctico intercrisis con intal y broncodilatadores betaadrenérgicos, según necesidades y otro, intal con aminofilina sistemáticamente (5 - 10 mg/kg, divididos en 3 dosis por día). El análisis de las {{variables}} clínicas evaluadas (número de ingresos) y de los parámetros espirométricos (patrón de obstrucción bronquial), medidos por VEF 1 seg, CVEF, FMEF e índice de Teffenau, arrojó una mejoría notable, independientemente del esquema terapéutico profiláctico aplicado, que resultó significativamente mayor en el segundo grupo. Las manifestaciones indeseables fueron pocas e intrascendentes en toda la serie.

These individuals {{did not receive}} prophylactic treatment the previous year. They were randomly divided into 2 groups: the first underwent prophylactic treatment between crises with intal and betaadrenergic bronchodilators according to its needs, and the second was administered intal with aminophylline systematically (5 - 10 mg/kg, divided into 3 doses per day). The analysis of the clinical variables evaluated (number of admissions) and of the spirometric parameters (pattern of bronchial obstruction) measured by VEF 1 sec, CVEF, FMEF and Teffenau´s index showed a marked improvement independently of the prophylactic therapeutic scheme used, that was significantly higher in the second group.

All children were submitted to a short nutritional and clinical inquiry. Blood samples to evaluate anemia and iron deficiency were obtained from eligible children after parental consent. Of the 183 children who visited the health centers during the enrollment period, 125 were eligible for blood sampling. Adequate blood samples were obtained from 120; 38 (31. 7 %) fulfilled the eligibility criteria for the <b>therapeutical</b> <b>trial</b> (polymaltose-ferric hydroxide, 5 mg/kg/day, for 4 weeks). Twenty-six completed the trial and 13 (50 %) had a positive response. The prevalence of iron deficiency estimated for this population sample was 15. 8 % (CI 95 % = 8. 8 - 22. 3), twice the prevalence of iron deficient anemia, presenting only as mild anemia. Nevertheless, for a total population of 3, 500 6 - 24 month old children in the Cascais area, a 15 % prevalence means over 500 iron-deficient children (estimated range between 300 and 800) of which 250 are likely to suffer anemia (150 - 400) and may be at risk of developing a permanent intellectual deficit. The size of the problem as sampled in the Cascais area does not justify recommending the screening of all young children; instead it points to the need to pay special attention to nutritional education in well-child health care visits, and to allow the early detection and treatment of infants with iron deficiency or at risk of becoming iron deficient.

Recently, these strategies have been applied also for therapeutical purposes in diseases such as AIDS and cancer. In some of these <b>therapeutical</b> <b>trials</b> the antisense strategy is combined with gene transfer technology: the AS ODN or the ribozyme are expressed within the cell by the use of adenoviral or retroviral vectors.

40|$|Abstract: Cerebellar ataxias are a {{group of}} {{disabling}} neurological disorders. Patients exhibit a cerebellar syndrome and can also present with extra-cerebellar deficits, namely pigmentary retinopathy, extrapyramidal movement disorders, pyramidal signs, cortical symptoms (seizures, cognitive impairment/behavioural symptoms), and peripheral neuropathy. Recently, deficits in cognitive operations have been unraveled. Cerebellar ataxias are heterogeneous both at the phenotypic and genotypic point of view. <b>Therapeutical</b> <b>trials</b> performed during these last 4 decades have failed in most cases, in particular because drugs were not targeting a deleterious pathway, but were given to counteract putative defects in neurotransmission. The identification of the causative mutations of many hereditary ataxias, the development of relevant animal models and the recent identifications of the molecular mechanisms underlying ataxias are impacting {{on the development of}} new drugs. We provide an overview of the pharmacological treatments currently used in the clinical practice and we discuss the drugs under development...|$|R
40|$|The Syst-Eur {{trial is}} a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo {{controlled}} <b>therapeutical</b> <b>trial</b> in patients at least 60 {{years old and}} with isolated systolic hypertension. Its scope is to investigate the effects of modern antihypertensive drug treatment on morbidity and mortality and to assess possible adverse effects of the drugs used. Patients were recruited in 22 countries in western and eastern Europe and Israel. At three run-in visits 1 month apart their sitting systolic blood pressure (SBP) on single-blind placebo treatment averaged 180 - 219 mm Hg with diastolic blood pressure (DBP) lower than 95 mm Hg. After stratification for sex {{and the presence of}} cardiovascular complications, the patients were randomized either to active treatment or placebo. Active treatment consisted of nitrendipine (10 - 40 mg/day) with the possible addition of enalapril (5 - 20 mg/day) and/or hydrochlorothiazide (12. 5 - 25 mg/day), titrated or combined to reduce the sitting SBP by at least 20 mm Hg to below 150 mm Hg. Matching placebos were employed similarly. The present progress report is based on the data received at the Coordinating Office before 1 March 1996. At that time 3433 subjects had been randomized. A total of 2015 patients had been followed for at least 1 year on double-blind treatment and 1298 patients for at least 2 years. At baseline BP was similar in both treatment groups and averaged 174 / 86 mm Hg. According to a per-protocol analysis at 1 year, BP fell (P < 0. 001) on average by 22. 6 +/- 15. 7 / 6. 0 +/- 8. 0 mm Hg in the active treatment group and by 12. 2 +/- 15. 9 / 1. 7 +/- 7. 3 mm Hg in the placebo group. At 2 years BP was 10. 2 / 5. 7 mm Hg lower (P < 0. 001) on active treatment than on placebo. At 1 year the percentage of patients who had reached goal BP was 19. 9 % in the placebo group and 41. 4 % in the active treatment group. At 2 years these percentages were 20. 9 and 43. 2 respectively. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Effects of pH-neutral, bicarbonate-buffered {{dialysis}} fluid on peritoneal transport kinetics in children. BackgroundDue {{to their}} superior biocompatibility, pH-neutral solutions {{are beginning to}} replace acidic lactate-buffered peritoneal dialysis (PD) fluids. We hypothesized that pH-neutral and acidic solutions might differentially affect peritoneal transport in the early dwell phase, {{due to differences in}} ionic shifts and initial peritoneal vasodilation. Such differences may become clinically relevant in patients with frequent short cycles on automated PD (APD). MethodsTwenty-five children were treated with a lactate-buffered (35 mmol/L, pH 5. 5) or a bicarbonate-buffered PD solution (34 mmol/L, pH 7. 4) in randomized order on two sequential days. Each day a four-hour Standardized Permeability Analysis (SPA) was performed, followed by overnight APD (7 cycles, fill volume 1000 mL/m 2, dwell time 75 min). Functional peritoneal surface area was dynamically assessed using the three-pore model. ResultsWhile intraperitoneal pH was constant at 7. 41 ± 0. 03 throughout the SPA with bicarbonate fluid, the dialysate remained acidic for more than one hour with lactate solution (pH 7. 12 ± 0. 08 at 1 h). Total pore area was 60 % higher during the first 30 minutes of the dwell than under steady-state conditions, without a difference between acidic and pH-neutral fluid. Net base gain, intraperitoneal volume kinetics, glucose absorption, ultrafiltration rate, effective lymphatic absorption and the transport of urea, potassium, β 2 -microglobulin and albumin were similar with both fluids. However, phosphate and creatinine elimination were 10 % lower with bicarbonate PD fluid, resulting in corresponding significant decreases in the 24 -hour clearances of these solutes. ConclusionThe peritoneal surface area is not measurably influenced by pH-neutral PD fluid. Creatinine and phosphate elimination appears to be slightly reduced with bicarbonate fluid; this observation awaits clarification in extended <b>therapeutical</b> <b>trials...</b>|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Functional {{disability}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important consequences of RA in the patient's daily life. The HAQ has been widely used in its self administered form for the assessment of disability. A sensitive and valid instrument is needed for a Slovak population with RA. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate reliability and validity of the Slovak version of the HAQ in patients with RA and to explore relationships between HAQ score and disease activity and to provide information concerning utilization of this instrument in clinical practice. METHODS: In preparing the Slovak version of the HAQ careful attention has been paid to the translation, in terms of linguistic and conceptual equivalence, in order to preserve the original purpose of the instrument. The wording of some items required adaptation to the current activities of daily living and Slovak lifestyle. The sample consisted of 160 RA-patients, out of which 135 were women and 25 were men. The inclusion criteria were the following: age from 20 to 70 years at the onset of the study, diagnosis of RA according to the ARA criteria. The exclusion criteria were the presence of another serious disease or very disabling RA (stage IV of the Steinbrocker's classification). To analyze the data t-test, correlations, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and principal component analysis (PCA) available in the SPSS/PC+ statistical package were used. RESULTS: The Cronbach's coefficient of reliability alpha for the HAQ total scale was 0. 94. The results of PCA showed that the 20 HAQ items loaded on four components for which the eigen values were greater than 1, accounting for 70 % of overall interpersonal variability. Orthogonal varimax rotation of the principal components provided factor loadings reflecting the eight dimensions within the HAQ. Validity of the HAQ was examined further by means of known-groups technique. The HAQ was found to be sensitive to differentiate between the Steinbrocker's functional capacity groups, as well as between males and females. Moreover, significant correlations (p < or = 0. 01) were found between the HAQ and the C-reactive protein, the ESR, the NHP-pain, the Ritchie articular index, the Steinbrocker's functional capacity (r = 0. 31 - 0. 62) and disease duration (p < or = 0. 05, r = 0. 17). CONCLUSION: The results of the current investigation provide support for reliability and construct validity of the Slovak version of the HAQ in patients with RA. The HAQ has sufficient discriminant ability. The index disability can be used as an criterion of severity of RA, as a criterion of effectiveness in <b>therapeutical</b> <b>trials</b> for patient stratification of the Slovak population with R...|$|R
