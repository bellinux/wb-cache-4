It was my good fortune to acquire, among other art objects, two illuminated manuscripts: one, small, exquisitely written on parchment [in margin at this point: "paper/HCJ"], the other a larger leather-bound book. According to Dr. Gruening, attached to the German Embassy in Kabul, the first is dated 1921 and was dedicated to a governor of Herat. Dr. Gruening estimated that the book's cover is, perhaps, 200 to 250 years old. (I wonder what vandalism was perpetrated to acquire the cover for the 1921 book). The larger book is inferior quality-wise but has a large number of water-color illustrations. The date of this book has been obliterated but might be determined by the use of infra-red light. It has been much used, perhaps by children, as one page shows some doodling [...] .

40|$|The {{proposed}} Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) {{mission is}} intended to deliver a large rover to the Martian surface within 10 km of the target site. This paper presents computational fluid dynamics (CFD) predictions of forebody heating rates for two MSL entry configurations with fixed aerodynamic trim tabs. Results are compared to heating on a 70 -deg sphere-cone reference geometry. All three heatshield geometries are designed to trim hypersonically at a 16 deg angle of attack in order to generate the lift-to-drag ratio (L/D) required for precision landing. Comparisons between CFD and tunnel data are generally in good agreement for each configuration, but the computations predict more flow separation and higher heating on a trim tab inclined 10 deg relative to the surface. CFD solutions at flight conditions were obtained using an 8 -species Mars gas in chemical and thermal nonequilibrium. Laminar and Baldwin-Lomax solutions were used to estimate {{the effects of the}} trim tabs and turbulence on heating. A <b>tab</b> <b>extending</b> smoothly <b>from</b> the heatshield flank is not predicted to increase laminar or turbulent heating rates above the reference levels. Laminar heating on a tab deflected 10 deg from the conical heatshield is influenced by flow separation and is up to 35 % above the baseline heating rate. The turbulent solution on the inclined tab configuration predicts attached flow and a 43 % heating increase above the reference level...|$|R
40|$|The new scorpionfish species Scorpaena wellingtoni is {{described}} from two specimens collected from Tagus Cove on Isla Isabela in the Galápagos Archipelago. The barcode COI mtDNA sequence for the holotype {{of the new}} species differs by 10. 8 – 14. 2 % from other members {{of a set of}} small related New World scorpionfishes, including S. russula and S. sonorae in the eastern Pacific and S. inermis, S. albifimbria, and S. calcarata in the western Atlantic. The new species is very similar in appearance to the Atlantic Mushroom Scorpionfish, S. inermis, with similar markings, a reduced second preopercular spine, no supplemental preopercular spine, eight dorsal-fin soft rays, two spines on the suborbital ridge, a short snout, and a narrow shallow interorbital space. It shares the <b>tabs</b> <b>extending</b> down <b>from</b> the pigmented corneal drape over the pupil, however they are not mushroom-shaped as in S. inermis. The new species further differs from S. inermis by having a distinct occipital pit, more prominent head spines, and a cleithral spine. S. wellingtoni also resembles the Atlantic Coral Scorpionfish S. albifimbria in markings, a reduced second preopercular spine, a relatively deep body, a short snout, and the presence of the occipital pit and cleithral spines, but it does not share the supplemental preopercular spine or the nine dorsal-fin soft rays and three suborbital-ridge spines found on S. albifimbria. The two widespread eastern-Pacific congeners, S. russula and S. sonorae, also have reduced second preopercular spines, but both differ from the new species in markings and having flat or very shallow occipital pits and an additional dorsal-fin ray and suborbital-ridge spine (S. calcarata in the Atlantic differs in the same characters, except the last). A rare deepwater species from Cocos Island and the Galápagos Archipelago, S. cocosensis, shares most meristic characters but has a less arched upper body, a wider interorbital space with prominent interorbital ridges, and different color and markings. S. wellingtoni is apparently found only in the Galápagos Islands and is thus far the only endemic scorpionfish reported in the Archipelago...|$|R
