Besides examining the main production and trade effects of the CAP implementation, the Brief presents some features of the EU’s CAP that can serve as lessons to follow for ACP policy makers. These are: the use of <b>traditional</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>trade</b> policy tools in support of agro-food sector development; the design and utilisation of new policy tools to strengthen the functioning of agro-food supply chains, in order to consolidate and expand the agricultural basis of production; and the design and implementation of measures to insulate domestic producers from the adverse effects of price instability {{in an era of}} rising input costs...|$|E

Preferential evaluations of buyer and supplier satisfactions are mathematically modeled and this preference matrix is given as input to Gale Shapely matching algorithm. The results of m*n matching {{happens to be a}} very transparent approach in a bilateral e-trading environment. These results are compared with the results obtained using simple English auction method which produces Pareto-optimal matches. It is found that the proposed method produces stable matching, which is preference-strategy proof and it also reduces the need for number of rounds of allocation...|$|R

We investigate {{the economic and political}} determinants of the maximum residue limits (MRLs) on pesticides and veterinary drugs. Using a political economy framework and econometric investigation, we find that nations with higher income and larger population adopt stricter MRLs. We also find that countries set more stringent MRLs in their more competitive sectors. Moreover, we show that MRLs and import tariffs are policy substitutes for policy makers. Finally, we find that countries with higher regulatory quality set tougher food standards...|$|R

Among them, advantages of new-type industrialization in <b>traditional</b> <b>agricultural</b> areas are analyzed from four aspects of labor advantage, land advantage, product advantage and environmental advantage. Disadvantages of new-type industrialization in <b>traditional</b> <b>agricultural</b> areas are also analyzed from four aspects of geographical disadvantage, inferior labor quality, informal system disadvantage, and backward non-agricultural industry. At the same time, opportunities for new-type industrialization in <b>traditional</b> <b>agricultural</b> areas are analyzed from three aspects of land system innovation, rural social security system, and financial policy supporting â€œThree Agricultureâ€ development. Threats for the new-type industrialization in <b>traditional</b> <b>agricultural</b> areas are also analyzed from {{the impact of the}} international market on agricultural products, threat of urban industry and threat of other agricultural areas.

40|$|This study {{constructs}} {{a regional}} CGE model of China {{to analyze the}} differential regional impacts of China’s WTO accession on <b>agricultural</b> production, <b>trade,</b> and farmers’ income. The results show that China’s WTO accession will generally improve the total welfare but will widen existing gaps among regions and sectors. It is expected that the agricultural sector will suffer if only <b>agricultural</b> <b>trade</b> is liberalized, as cheap imports of agricultural products, particularly grains, will increase and domestic agricultural production and farmers’ agricultural income will decline. Full trade liberalization, i. e., lifting trade barriers in both agriculture and non-agriculture will benefit farmers and agriculture at the national level. However, the increase in rural income is still smaller than the increase in urban income, which implies that the rural- urban income gap may be further widened. Furthermore, among the regions, the less-developed rural areas will benefit little or even suffer because their major production activities and income sources are still from agriculture, especially from <b>traditional</b> <b>agricultural</b> activities such as grain production.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{ask whether the}} GATT/WTO has {{actually}} failed to increase members’ <b>agricultural</b> <b>trade.</b> Surprisingly, {{there is very little}} empirical econometric support to shed light on this question despite the fact that <b>agricultural</b> <b>trade</b> is often at the forefront of multilateral negotiations.

Using UNCTAD’s <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Trade</b> Policy Simulation Model (ATPSM), the study investigates two {{specific}} scenarios that capture the magnitude of (i) {{the economic impact of}} global <b>agricultural</b> <b>trade</b> reform in South Africa and (ii) the economic impact if the reform in South Africa is coupled with agricultural reforms in the European Union (EU). Trade reform focuses on substantial tariff reduction; although {{in the case of the}} EU, scenarios also include reduction in domestic support and export subsidies. The results show that a unilateral tariff reduction in a selected number of agricultural products amounts to welfare gains of US$ 21 million. These gains are three times higher when accompanied by extensive reforms in the EU. <b>Agricultural</b> <b>trade,</b> trade policy reform, welfare, <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Trade</b> Policy Simulation Model, Agricultural and Food Policy, International Relations/Trade,...|$|R
