5000|$|Standard type IV {{carriages}} (EW IV, Einheitswagen IV) {{and driving}} trailers of type IC, {{the same as}} on InterRegio services. A normal <b>train</b> <b>composition</b> consists of a Re 460 locomotive, 8 to 12 carriages and a driving trailer. Seating capacity is up to 900, depending on the <b>train</b> <b>composition.</b> Most carriages have a small compartment for storing bicycles and/or skis {{at one end of}} the carriage; this end is marked by a bicycle drawn on the outside of the closest doors. The type IV carriages are the least wheelchair friendly as they require climbing the stairs to enter. Overall, 533 carriages and driving trailers are in operation.|$|E

50|$|Two <b>train</b> <b>compositions</b> {{are usually}} coupled {{together}} {{to travel to}} Zweilütschinen where they are then split. The front portion travels to Lauterbrunnen, the other one to Grindelwald. The motor coach (power unit) is always positioned on the uphill side, a driving trailer (coach with a driver’s cab) being positioned on the downhill side, to avoid any running round manoeuvres at the terminus stations.|$|R

50|$|From the {{introduction}} of the 1999 timetable, the newly constructed 2.5 km section of dual track between Gsteigwiler and Zweilütschinen allows trains to pass without one having to wait in a loop, off the main line. This means that a half-hour timetable can be operated with only five <b>train</b> <b>compositions.</b> Since 2005, every composition has been equipped with an articulated (three-part) low-floor driving trailer as standard.|$|R
50|$|As of the 2007 schedule, the München-Nürnberg-Express is {{the only}} {{regional}} train in Germany with a maximum speed of 200 km/h. This high speed is necessary to not hinder the ICE traffic, which travels at speeds of up to 300 km/h. However, since Deutsche Bahn does not own regional rolling stock capable of travelling at such high speeds, push-pull InterCity <b>train</b> <b>compositions</b> are used for the service.|$|R
50|$|Regional {{passenger}} services on the German section are operated by DB Regio NRW and Abellio Rail NRW. DB Regio NRW operated the whole {{passenger services}} on the German {{side of the}} railway line until December 2016 and currently is operating the RE 5 line. The following <b>train</b> <b>compositions</b> are used by DB Regio NRW: push-pull trains composed of five double-deck carriages hauled by a DB class 146 electric locomotives at speeds of up to 160 km/h.|$|R
50|$|They have lighter axle loads, {{allowing}} {{operation on}} lighter tracks, where locomotives may be banned. Another {{side effect of}} this is reduced track wear, as traction forces can be provided through many axles, rather than just the four or six of a locomotive. They generally have rigid couplers instead of the flexible ones often used on locomotive-hauled trains. That means brakes/throttle can be more quickly applied without an excessive amount of jerk experienced in passenger coaches. In a locomotive-hauled train, {{if the number of}} cars is changed to meet the demand, acceleration and braking performance will also change. This calls for performance calculations to be done taking the heaviest <b>train</b> <b>composition</b> into account. This may sometimes cause some trains in off-peak periods to be overpowered with respect to the required performance. When 2 or more multiple units are coupled, train performance remains almost unchanged. However, in locomotive-hauled train compositions, using more powerful locomotives when a train is longer can solve this problem.|$|E

30|$|The {{method has}} been used to examine those situations, in terms of {{distance}} covered and frequency of the service, in which rail-road combined transport can be cost-effective {{as an alternative to the}} full-road solution. The obtained range can be reviewed based on the services, such as shuttle trains to connect seaports with dry ports: the short distance covered may be more convenient due to the high quantities of goods as well as the fixed <b>train</b> <b>composition</b> and path allocation, which means lower terminal cost and times. Finally, some innovative proposals have been introduced.|$|E
5000|$|Between 1964 and 1966, station {{platforms}} were lengthened from 60 metres to 90 metres {{in order}} to allow 6-car <b>train</b> <b>compositions,</b> due to heavy increasing passenger flow. Chamberí station had to be closed because it didn't allow platform lengthening due to its sharp curve and its closeness to Iglesia station. The old Chamberí station however is still open to the public as part of the Madrid Metro's [...] project and now functions primarily as a historic exhibition.|$|R
50|$|Nowadays, most {{passenger}} trains {{are made up}} of railcars, the powered car still being positioned {{at the lower end of}} the train, and so <b>train</b> <b>compositions</b> do not usually cross Kleine Scheidegg to travel directly from Lauterbrunnen over to Grindelwald. However, a triangular junction specially built into the mountainside at Kleine Scheidegg allows the train to be turned if necessary so that it can also be used on the other side of the col. The newest of these trains reach 28 km/h on the steepest stretch.|$|R

However, due to the railway vehicle gauge, these vehicles present a particular design with an important impact on {{the dynamics of the}} trainset and on its derailment risk. The present work aims at analysing the dynamic behaviour of the trainset and the influence of the freight <b>train</b> <b>composition</b> on the derailment risk. Numerical simulations have been performed to identify the most critical conditions.

40|$|AbstractAmong the {{innovations}} aimed at tackling the transportation issues in urban areas, {{one of the}} most promising solutions is the possibility of making virtual trains of vehicles so as to provide a new kind of transportation system. Even if this kind of solution is now widespread in literature, some difficulties still need to be resolved. For instance, one must find solutions to make the crossing of the train possible while maintaining <b>train</b> <b>composition</b> (trains must not be split) and safety conditions. This paper proposes a multi-level decision process aimed at dealing with this issue. This proposal is based on dynamic adaptation of train parameters which lead to trains crossing without stopping any of them. Results, obtained in simulations, make the comparison with a classical crossing strategy...|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} an algorithmic approach to determine an efficient {{railway rolling stock}} circulation on a single line or {{on a set of}} interacting lines. Given the timetable and the passengers? seat demand, we develop a branch-and-price algorithm that results in an allocation of rolling stock material to the daily trips. In order to efficiently utilize the train units, they can be added to or removed from the trains at some stations along the line. These changes in <b>train</b> <b>composition</b> are subject to several constraints, for example corresponding to the order of the train units within a train. A solution is evaluated based on three criteria, i. e. the service to passengers, the robustness, and the cost of the circulation. The branch-and-price algorithm that we developed is tested on real-life instances from NS Reizigers, the main Dutch operator of passenger trains...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} to check integrity of cargo trains based on a distributed wireless sensor network (WSN). The WSN is autonomous and gathers information about the composition of the train without outside help or intervention. If the WSN infers from its data that an unexpected change in composition has occurred, it raises an alarm. While moving, a change in composition usually means an undesirable and hazardous loss of carriages. <b>Train</b> <b>composition</b> is determined by two components of the WSN. The communication protocol produces possible sequences of carriages. Sequences may yield carriages from multiple trains. Acceleration sensors distinguish carriages from different trains by correlating movements from individual carriages. Tests with real cargo trains show that the presented approach is feasible. Existing solutions to check train integrity are almost without exception based on trackside systems, while our solution exclusively depends on the trainbased WSN...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Through this study, the {{standard}} design guidelines for high speed train with power cars have been derived {{to meet the}} crashworthiness requirements of the Korean rollingstock safety regulation. The crashworthiness regulation requires some performance requirements for two heavy collision accident scenarios; a train-to-train collision at the relative speed of 36 kph, and a collision against a standard deformable obstacle of 15 ton at 110 kph. A standard high speed <b>train</b> <b>composition</b> was defined as 2 PC- 2 ET- 6 T with 17 ton axle load, similar to KTX- 2 for the Honam express line. Using theoretical and numerical analyses, some crashworthy design guidelines were derived in terms of mean crush forces and energy absorptions for major crushable components. The derived design guidelines were evaluated and improved using one dimensional spring-mass dynamic simulation. It is shown from the simulation results that the suggested design guidelines can easily satisfy the domestic crashworthiness requirements...|$|E
