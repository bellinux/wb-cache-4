5|$|Boxing was {{introduced}} and practiced in a clandestine manner in Puerto Rico while the archipelago {{was still a}} Spanish colony. Fights were organized in haciendas among the workers of the sugar and coffee plantations, and the objective {{was to determine the}} best fighter among the employees. Following the culmination of the Puerto Rican Campaign and Spanish–American War, American soldiers who were stationed in the main island practiced the sport. During World War I, a championship known as Campeonato Las Casas was held as training for military personnel. Nero Chen, the first Puerto Rican boxer to gain recognition, began his career in these tournaments. The Combat Maneuver Training Center followed this example and organized boxing activities, which they named Los Campeones del Campamento. These were received with enthusiasm by the young recruits. Most of these events were celebrated without restriction due to military jurisdictional limits, although prohibitions were put in place for the civilian population. Illegal matches were organized on <b>the</b> <b>rooftops</b> of residences in Old San Juan, empty terrain's in El Condado and in hippodromes.|$|E
5|$|On November 3, Sheriff Porttens deputized {{two hundred}} men and they {{marched to the}} {{terminal}} building where they attempted to assist the strikebreakers in moving the streetcars from the street and vulnerable terminal building to the more easily protected carhouse across the street. Todd led the strikebeakers in the effort while the police provided protection. The police were able {{to hold back the}} crowd at first, using clubs to hit anyone who attempted to interfere. The rioters increased the intensity of their attack, and men on <b>the</b> <b>rooftops</b> began throwing stones and bricks. Todd was hit multiple times and {{was rushed to the hospital}} with severe injuries. The greatly outnumbered police began to abandon their posts and the strikebreakers fled into the storage buildings. People in the crowd opened fire on a storage building and killed one of the strikebreakers and injured others. By the end of November 3, after two days of protecting the cars, less than fifty policemen remained on duty in the city. Meanwhile, the strike degenerated into a riot encompassing the entire downtown.|$|E
5|$|The police's {{operating}} procedure—and the {{law which}} governed their actions—meant {{they were unable}} to open fire without being fired upon first. This, along with the structure of the building, which had a narrow, winding stairwell up which police would have to pass, meant any approach to the gang members was too perilous to attempt. It was decided to wait until dawn before taking any action. At about 7:30am a policeman knocked on the door of number 100, which elicited no response; stones were then thrown at the window to wake the men. Svaars and Sokoloff appeared at the window and opened fire at the police. A police sergeant was wounded in the chest: he was evacuated under fire across <b>the</b> <b>rooftops,</b> and taken to the London Hospital. Some members of the police returned fire, but their guns were only effective over shorter ranges, and proved ineffective against the comparatively advanced automatic weapons of Svaars and Sokoloff.|$|E

40|$|AbstractFor {{continuous}} {{promotion of}} the solar PV system in buildings, {{it is crucial to}} analyze <b>the</b> <b>rooftop</b> solar PV potential. However, <b>the</b> <b>rooftop</b> solar PV potential in urban areas highly varies depending on <b>the</b> available <b>rooftop</b> area due to the building shadow. In order to estimate <b>the</b> available <b>rooftop</b> area accurately by considering the building shadow, this study proposed an estimation method of <b>the</b> available <b>rooftop</b> area for installing <b>the</b> <b>rooftop</b> solar PV system by analyzing the building shadow using Hillshade Analysis.

They claimed that <b>The</b> <b>Rooftop</b> is a film that is difficult to be categorized, for it combined the elements of musical extravaganza and actions.|$|R
5|$|The arid {{conditions}} of the spiny forest, which receives less than 600 millimeters of rainfall each year, largely shape Mikea economic activities. Nearly everything they consume is scavenged from the forest, and the average Mikea needs two hours or less to collect adequate food for the day. Their main source of food is tubers, particularly {{during the dry season}} when few other foods may be reliably available. Adults and children of both genders work to dig up using a metal-tipped digging stick (antsoro) and a digging bowl (kipao). The starchy ovy tuber is roasted or boiled before eating, while the Mikea eat the watery babo (or baboho) raw for hydration or use its water for boiling other foods; the tavolo tuber is dried and ground to make a flour that is sold at village markets. They also gather forest fruits, melons and honey, with the latter a particularly important source of income for the Mikea during the rainy season. To obtain water during the rainy season the Mikea capture rain run-off from <b>the</b> <b>rooftops</b> of their houses using hollowed-out logs or transport water on foot or zebu-drawn wagon from the villages, while during the cool dry season the Mikea consume their store of water-engorged babo tubers and drink water from natural or man-made wells when possible.|$|E

50|$|Before work on {{the project}} began, the team wanted <b>the</b> <b>rooftop</b> owners to agree not to pursue legal action {{challenging}} the construction and continued to negotiate privately with them - offering {{to reduce the size}} and number of signs to be built - in order to gain their assent. <b>The</b> <b>rooftop</b> owners had a lease with the team until 2023 in exchange for paying 17% of the gross revenues. Unable to reach an agreement with <b>the</b> <b>rooftop</b> owners by May 2014, the Cubs said that they would pursue the original 2013 plan to modify the park. In the early months of 2015, the Ricketts family purchased three of <b>the</b> <b>rooftop</b> properties. In <b>the</b> middle of the 2015 season, they purchased three more.|$|R
50|$|Major Kean {{returned}} {{the ground floor}} of the Chancery and ordered his men to withdraw into a large semicircle at the main entrance to the Chancery. Most of the Marines were inside the Chancery when the crowds outside the embassy broke through the gates into the compound. The Marines closed and bolted the Chancery door, the elevators were locked by Seabees on the 6th floor and the Marines withdrew up the stairwells locking grill gates behind them. On the ground floor a water tanker was driven through the Chancery door and the crowd began to surge up through the building toward <b>the</b> <b>rooftop.</b> <b>The</b> Marines on <b>the</b> <b>rooftop</b> had sealed <b>the</b> doors to <b>the</b> <b>rooftop</b> and were using mace to discourage the crowd from trying to break through. Sporadic gunfire from around the Embassy passed over <b>the</b> <b>rooftop.</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{tropical}} countries rooftop greenery is {{more sympathetic}} to the prevailing climate and provides comfortable indoor environment. This paper analyses the above hypothesis on a 10 storied residential apartments in Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM). The analysis of actual performance of <b>the</b> <b>rooftop</b> greenery can provide the information on effectiveness of its application on contemporary houses for tropical climate in Malaysia. Empirical studies have been performed an internal and external roof surface, where temperature and air temperature were measured {{for a period of}} three days in two phases. The first phase of measurement was carried out when <b>the</b> <b>rooftop</b> was empty. After <b>the</b> <b>rooftop</b> greenery was built then the second phase of measurement was conducted. Expected findings of the research are that <b>the</b> green <b>rooftop</b> will tend to experience lower surface temperature than the original exposed roof surface. So this research work will provide an introduction or preliminary guide line for thermally responsive architecture on the basis of thermal performance of <b>the</b> <b>rooftop</b> greenery system. Temperature is the main criteria of human comfort. To provide an indoor comfortable environment through the greening of <b>the</b> <b>rooftop</b> of <b>the</b> building is more appropriate in the tropical climate of Malaysia...|$|R
25|$|Concerns {{have been}} raised by law {{enforcement}} and fire and rescue teams of the risk in jumping off high buildings. They argue that practitioners are needlessly risking damage to both themselves and rooftops by practicing at height, with police forces calling for practitioners to stay off <b>the</b> <b>rooftops.</b> Some practitioners of Parkour agree that such behaviour should be discouraged.|$|E

25|$|Apart from mosquitoes, Gibraltar's cisterns {{had other}} major hygiene problems. The water they stored was {{unfiltered}} {{and they were}} often located alongside functional areas such as kitchens, privies and areas for animals such as poultry. Gibraltar's colony of Barbary macaques added to the problem by fouling <b>the</b> <b>rooftops</b> and cisterns. The water was notionally fresh but in reality the cisterns tended to accumulate unhygienic debris of various types.|$|E
25|$|A small police squad {{was sent}} out {{to break up the}} fighting, but upon {{reaching}} Centre Street, the gangs turned against the police, who were forced to retreat after several officers were injured. They made a second attempt, this time fighting their way into the mob, and arrested two men believed to be the leaders. The gangsters responded by storming into the low houses lining The Bowery and Bayard Street, forcing residents out, and climbed to <b>the</b> <b>rooftops,</b> where they proceeded to shower the Metropolitan officers with stones and brick bats until they fled from the area.|$|E
25|$|At {{least three}} but {{as many as}} nine {{powerful}} Shmel rockets were fired at the school from {{the positions of the}} special forces (three or nine empty disposable tubes were later found on <b>the</b> <b>rooftops</b> of nearby apartment blocks). The use of the Shmel rockets, classified in Russia as flamethrowers and in the West as thermobaric weapons, was initially denied, but later admitted by the government. A report by an aide to the military prosecutor of the North Ossetian garrison stated that RPG-26 rocket-propelled grenades were used as well. The rebels also used grenade launchers, firing at the Russian positions in the apartment buildings.|$|E

25|$|Hosting {{the summit}} {{involved}} elaborate security arrangements in the city. 2,000 police personnel and National Security Guard commandos were deployed throughout the city's arterial areas, with {{special emphasis on}} the summit venue. The venue's security involved a three-tier arrangement handled by the Delhi Police and the embassy officials of the visiting nations, and involved body checks and metal detectors. To ensure {{the security of the}} attending delegates, the floors above and below the rooms to be occupied were left vacant. In addition, the entire hotel was occupied by the BRICS summit, and guests were re-directed to other hotels. Security personnel were posted even on <b>the</b> <b>rooftops</b> of the venue.|$|E
25|$|Constans II {{decided to}} turn his {{attention}} to the West in the hope of achieving better luck. Whilst the Saracens were establishing themselves in former Byzantine territory, the Avars and Bulgars still remained along the Danube river, as did the Slavs, whose annual payment to the Empire was falling short. Constans II then decided to move his capital to Syracuse in Sicily in 662. Some say that this was to escape horrible visions of his brother whom he had murdered 2 years past. His stay in Italy and Sicily can only be imagined as unpleasant for the locals. Everything of any value in Rome was requisitioned by the Byzantine army— even copper from <b>the</b> <b>rooftops.</b> It was to many people's relief that Constans II was murdered while bathing by his Greek servant on 15 September 668.|$|E
25|$|Fighting {{continued}} until early afternoon, when a larger police force arrived, sent by Police Commissioner Simeon Draper, and marched in close formation towards the mob. After hard fighting, they cleared the streets, forcing both the Dead Rabbits and the Bowery Boys into {{the buildings and}} to <b>the</b> <b>rooftops</b> once again. The police followed the gangsters, using their clubs at every opportunity, and began arresting large numbers of men. Some refused to surrender to police, such as one man who, while fighting police, fell off {{the roof of a}} Baxter Street tenement fracturing his skull. He was promptly killed by Bowery gangsters on the ground, who stomped him to death. Two leaders of the Dead Rabbits were finally arrested by police despite heavy resistance from fellow gang members. The police took them to a nearby police precinct followed by a group of Bowery Boys.|$|E

25|$|Palestinians are {{barred from}} using Al-Shuhada Street, a {{principal}} commercial thoroughfare.″Those who still live on Shuhada Street can’t enter {{their own homes}} from the street. Some use <b>the</b> <b>rooftops</b> {{to go in and}} out, climbing from one roof to another before issuing into adjacent homes or alleys. Some have cut gaping holes in the walls connecting their homes to other (often deserted) houses and thus pass through these buildings until they can exit into a lane outside or up a flight of stairs to a passageway on top of the old casba market. According to a survey conducted by the human-rights organization B’Tselem in 2007, 42 per cent of the Palestinian population in the city center of Hebron (area H2)—some 1,014 families—have abandoned their homes and moved out, most of them to area H1, now under Palestinian control.″ As a result, about half the Arab shops in H2 have gone out of business since 1994.|$|E
25|$|As {{part of a}} multi-pronged {{approach}} to a rescue, a Chinook helicopter of No. 27 Squadron RAF was mobilised from Abu Naji to Majar al-Kabir with a quick reaction force onboard. The helicopter lifted off at 11:05am and returned to Abu Naji around 11:30am after coming under sustained fire and having at least seven casualties aboard, who were wounded by the insurgent fire. The helicopters' route into the town meant it having to fly over <b>the</b> <b>rooftops</b> to try and locate Bravo Company who were holed {{up in one of}} the houses. Whilst it flew in low, it made itself a target for small arms fire and RPGs, with no less than six RPGs being fired at the helicopter. As the damage to the helicopter was severe and casualties were mounting, the pilot, Wing Commander Guy Van den Berg, decided that safest option was to return to base. The Sergeant in charge of the QRF asked that the helicopter land away from the immediate danger and allow the non-wounded on board to disembark. Van den Berg replied that if the Chinook landed, it might not get off the ground again.|$|E
25|$|Initially Soviet tanks {{advanced}} {{down the}} middle of the streets, but to counter the German tactics, they altered their own and started to hug the sides of the streets (this allowed for supporting cross-fire from tanks either side of the wider thoroughfares). The Soviets also mounted sub-machine gunners on the tanks who sprayed every doorway and window, but this meant the tank could not traverse its turret quickly. Another solution was to rely on heavy howitzers (152mm and 203mm) firing over open sights to blast defended buildings and to use anti-aircraft guns against the German gunners on the higher floors. Soviet combat groups started to move from house to house instead of directly down the streets. They moved through the apartments and cellars, blasting holes through the walls of adjacent buildings (making effective use of abandoned German panzerfausts), while others fought across <b>the</b> <b>rooftops</b> and through the attics. These enfilading tactics took the Germans lying in ambush for tanks in the flanks. Flamethrowers and grenades proved to be very effective, but as the Berlin civilian population had not been evacuated, these tactics inevitably killed many.|$|E
