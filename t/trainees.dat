5|$|The seductive details {{effect has}} {{primarily}} been demonstrated {{at the point}} of knowledge acquisition (initial learning); its impact on transfer performance has not been clearly shown. Theory in text comprehension suggests that seductive details might be detrimental for recall but advantageous for transfer performance because of the schematic representation of information that <b>trainees</b> form during instruction. Researchers have described the seductive details effect as having a damaging effect on recall because it distracts <b>trainees</b> from learning and they tend to form inappropriate schemas to organize information. However, when learners are applying knowledge, empirical studies suggest that the distortion of the macro structure or schema of the instructional material is beneficial.|$|E

The population of the study was 439 third year <b>trainee</b> teachers who had Just completed a yearlong school attachment programme.

5|$|In another study, {{students}} who read less-organized material performed better that students given organized material on tasks that required {{an application of}} the knowledge to problem-solving. This suggests that the inclusion of seductive details might be beneficial for transfer performance but detrimental when <b>trainees</b> are recalling information. Interference from seductive details creates confusion of what the core material is and, therefore, the recall {{will not be as}} good and more errors will occur. This distortion can lead to a richer understanding of the material and facilitate transfer performance because <b>trainees</b> are required to form a macro structure of the instructional material. Research using the dual-coding paradigm also suggests that interesting and engaging information promotes image-based thoughts and leads to deeper processing of information because it allows storage of material in both verbal and nonverbal systems. When information is made easier to comprehend, material is processed less deeply, thus leading to poorer acquisition of information.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{supervisor}} and <b>trainee</b> therapist gender on supervision discourse {{were examined in}} this study. Forty episodes of supervision discourse, with ten drawn from each of four types of supervision systems were videotaped. The systems were (1) male supervisor and male <b>trainee</b> therapist; (2) male supervisor and female <b>trainee</b> therapist; (3) female supervisor and male <b>trainee</b> therapist; and (4) female supervisor and female <b>trainee</b> therapist. The episodes of supervision discourse were analysed using a supervision discourse coding system which showed adequate inter-rater reliability. For supervisors, the coding system allowed a directive discourse style and a collaborative discourse styled to be coded. A cooperative discourse style and a resistant discourse style could be coded for <b>trainee</b> therapists. Two statistically significant findings of considerable theoretical and clinical importance emerged. First, contrary to stereotypic expectations, discourse characterized by a directive supervision style and a resistant <b>trainee</b> therapist style was more common for systems containing a female supervisor than for those containing a male supervisor. Second, for same gender supervisor-trainee-therapist supervision systems, a collaborative systemic supervision style was correlated with both cooperative and resistant <b>trainee</b> therapist styles. This discourse pattern did not occur for opposite gender supervision systems, indicating that a collaborative supervision discourse style is consistently associated with <b>trainee</b> therapist participation (either cooperatively or resistantly) within same gender pairings of supervisors and <b>trainee</b> therapists. These results are discussed in light of relevant literature on gender, power and supervision process and {{the limitations of the}} study are considered...|$|R
