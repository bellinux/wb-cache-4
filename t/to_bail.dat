5|$|In the past, Native Americans ate {{the flesh}} of {{horseshoe}} crabs, and used the tail spines as spear tips and the shells <b>to</b> <b>bail</b> water out of their canoes.

40|$|We {{present a}} model that {{illustrates}} the close relationship between {{the possibility of a}} currency crisis and the amount of private-sector debt within a four-stage sequential game framework. In the first stage, the government announces its exchange rate policy, and all agents in the economy receive probabilistic information about a future shock that will occur in the last stage. This shock will affect unemployment and net returns on private sector investment. The private sector in stage 2 forms expectations about the future exchange rate and engages in risky investments. In stage 3, the government faces costs due to expectations of future devaluation and private-sector debt, anticipating the stochastic shock that will occur in stage 4 and may or may not find it optimal to pre-emptively abandon its fixed exchange rate policy. The government can commit already in stage 1 <b>to</b> <b>bailing</b> out part of the private sector's outstanding debt if a bad shock occurs or wait until stage 4 to give an optimal bailout. A commitment <b>to</b> <b>bailing</b> out provides a reconciliation of the multiple equilibria that result from self-fulfilling expectations. Moreover, the government may sometimes avert currency crises by committing <b>to</b> <b>bailing</b> out. currency crisis; private-sector debt; sequential game analysis; financial crises...|$|R

5|$|The European {{debt crisis}} (often also {{referred}} to as the Eurozone crisis or the European sovereign debt crisis) is a multi-year debt crisis that has been taking place in the European Union since the end of 2009. Several eurozone member states (Greece, Portugal, Ireland, Spain and Cyprus) were unable to repay or refinance their government debt or <b>to</b> <b>bail</b> out over-indebted banks under their national supervision without the assistance of third parties like other Eurozone countries, the European Central Bank (ECB), or the International Monetary Fund (IMF).|$|E

5|$|The eurozone crisis {{resulted}} {{from a combination of}} complex factors, including the globalisation of finance; easy credit conditions during the 2002–2008 period that encouraged high-risk lending and borrowing practices; the financial crisis of 2007–08; international trade imbalances; real estate bubbles that have since burst; the Great Recession of 2008–2012; fiscal policy choices related to government revenues and expenses; and approaches used by states <b>to</b> <b>bail</b> out troubled banking industries and private bondholders, assuming private debt burdens or socializing losses.|$|E
5|$|During the Act's early history, Section 3(c) {{was little}} used; no jurisdictions were bailed in until 1975. Between 1975 and 2013, 18 jurisdictions were bailed in, {{including}} 16 {{local governments and}} the states of Arkansas and New Mexico. Although the Supreme Court held the Section 4(b) coverage formula unconstitutional in Shelby County v. Holder (2013), it did not hold Section 3(c) unconstitutional. Therefore, jurisdictions may continue to be bailed-in and subjected to Section 3(c) preclearance. In the months following Shelby County, courts began to consider requests by the Attorney General and other plaintiffs <b>to</b> <b>bail</b> in the states of Texas and North Carolina, and in January 2014 a federal court bailed in Evergreen, Alabama.|$|E
5|$|Ethnic tension {{continued}} to grow shortly after Mahathir narrowly defeated Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah for the UMNO Presidency in 1987. Around this time, several deposit-taking co-operatives (DTCs), some associated with the MCA, collapsed. To save Chinese investors, the MCA asked the government <b>to</b> <b>bail</b> out the DTCs, citing a previous bailout of Bumiputra financial institutions. UMNO's reluctance to acquiesce led MCA Deputy President Lee Kim Sai to warn that the MCA might quit the government. Later that year, the government posted several non-Chinese-educated staff to senior positions in Chinese vernacular schools. Anwar Ibrahim, then Education Minister, refused to yield to protests from the MCA, and stated that the decision was final, despite a previous informal agreement on the issue between the Malay and Chinese communities.|$|E
