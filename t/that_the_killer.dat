5|$|At a church, {{the killer}} is searching through files {{when he is}} interrupted, and flees, leaving bloodied {{fingerprints}} at the scene. Black constructs {{a profile of the}} man, and deduces that his actions are attacks on faith, believing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>killer</b> has suffered a devastating loss which has caused him to lose his own faith. As the manhunt for the killer tightens, another cleric is tortured and killed; however, Black senses <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>killer</b> has returned to where his life fell apart. He and the police are able to identify the killer as Galen Calloway (Michael Zelniker), whose wife and daughter had been killed in a house fire several years earlier. Black knows the killer's next target will be the church that held the family's funeral.|$|E

5|$|Krohn's {{analysis}} of the production of Psycho in his book Hitchcock at Work, while refuting Bass' claims for directing the scene, notes that these storyboards did introduce key aspects of the final scene—most notably, the fact <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>killer</b> appears as a silhouette, and details such as the close-ups of the slashing knife, Leigh's desperate outstretched arm, the shower curtain being torn down, and {{the transition from the}} hole of the drainage pipe to Marion Crane's dead eyes. Krohn notes that this final transition is highly reminiscent of the iris titles that Bass created for Vertigo.|$|E

Only after Leland is revealed as <b>the</b> <b>killer</b> does <b>the</b> scene make sense and exonerate Ben—Leland and Ben had just been alone together in a room.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, the {{investigation}} has found traces of this {{drug in the}} other victims, with Black believing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>killer</b> not only has access to it through his occupation but is likely consuming it himself while committing his crimes in order to readily act on his sexual fantasies. Black follows up on this, and investigates Nesbitt's pharmacy. Nesbitt is not working at the time, but Black realizes he must be the killer.

5|$|Detective Harold Greer is {{initially}} {{in charge of}} the murder investigation, but Rusty has him replaced with his friend Detective Dan Lipranzer, whom he persuades to narrow the inquiry so that his relationship with Carolyn is left out.

50|$|A notable {{distinction}} of The Kindaichi Case Files is <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>killers</b> are not depicted as psychopathic murderers and the murders are never committed for financial reasons alone. <b>The</b> identified <b>killers</b> all have deep rooted problems, often involving great emotional trauma through the greed or thoughtlessness of others, as {{their reasons for}} committing the murder(s). Thus <b>the</b> <b>killers</b> are often portrayed as sympathetic figures, as opposed to cold, calculating killers in some other mystery series.|$|R
