40|$|AbstractIn these days, the {{application}} of using thermal energy of sunlight has become widely used in concentrated solar power generation systems (CSP). In CSP, property of the receiver directly contributes to the system efficiency of CSP. The solar selective absorber {{is used for the}} receiver to reduce energy loss of thermal radiation. To investigate the mass production technology of fabricating solar selective absorber that can be utilized in high temperature condition, we focused on transparent conductive oxides (TCO) thin film on metal substrate. TCO material has plasma wavelength in infrared region. Therefore the electromagnetic wave with shorter wavelength than plasma wavelength goes through the material, while the electromagnetic wave with longer wavelength is reflected on the surface. It is realized that TCO on metal substrate showed high performance as solar selective absorbers, i. e. high absorptance in visible light range and low emittance in infrared range by numerical simulations. The optical property of fabricated TCO coated metal is well consistent with the simulated property. Consequently, we attain high performance solar selective absorber of which solar absorptance is 0. 71 and <b>hemispherical</b> <b>total</b> <b>emittance</b> is 0. 11.

40|$|At DLR’s QUARZ Center a {{test bench}} has been {{established}} to measure, using steady state calorimetric method, the <b>total</b> <b>hemispherical</b> <b>emittance</b> of cylindrical solar thermal absorber samples at temperatures up to 450 °C. Emittance measurement of solar absorber surfaces is commonly performed by direct-hemispherical reflectance measurements with spectrophotometers. However, the measurement of cylindrical samples with spectrophotometers can be considered still a challenge as integrating spheres, reference samples and calibration services by national metrology institutions are optimized for flat sample measurement. Additionally samples are typically measured at room temperature. The steady state calorimetric method does not rely on reference samples and the measurement is performed at operating temperature. In the steady state calorimetric method electrical power input used to heat the sample is equated to the radiative heat loss from a heated sample to the environment. The total emittance can be calculated using the Stefan-Boltzmann equation from radiative heat loss power, the defined sample surface area and measured surface temperature. The expanded uncertainty (k= 2) of the <b>total</b> <b>hemispherical</b> <b>emittance</b> has been determined to ± 13 % for a typical parabolic trough absorber sample at a temperature of 300 °C and a heating power of 100  W.

40|$|Advanced {{modeling}} and design efforts for many aerospace components require high temperature emittance data. Applications requiring emittance data include propulsion systems, radiators, aeroshells, heatshields/thermal protection systems, and leading edge surfaces. The {{objective of this}} work is to provide emittance data at ultra-high temperatures. MSFC has a new instrument for the measurement of emittance at ultra-high temperatures, the Ultra-High Temperature Emissometer System (Ultra-HITEMS). AZ Technology Inc. developed the instrument, designed to provide emittance measurements over the temperature range 700 - 3500 K. The Ultra-HITEMS instrument measures the emittance of samples, heated by lasers, in vacuum, using a blackbody source and a Fourier Transform Spectrometer. Detectors in a Nicolet 6700 FT-IR spectrometer measure emittance over the spectral range of 0. 4 - 25 microns. Emitted energy from the specimen and output from a Mikron M 390 S blackbody source at the same temperature with matched collection geometry are measured. Integrating emittance over the spectral range yields the total emittance. The ratio provides a direct measure of <b>total</b> <b>hemispherical</b> <b>emittance.</b> Samples are heated using lasers. Optical pyrometry provides temperature data. Optical filters prevent interference from the heating lasers. Data for Inconel 718 show excellent agreement with results from literature and ASTM 835.
