5|$|Over {{the coming}} years, several organisations, {{including}} the CIA and <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>German</b> Government, attempted to locate Bormann without success. In 1964, <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>German</b> government offered a reward of 100,000 Deutsche Marks for {{information leading to}} Bormann's capture. Sightings were reported at points all over the world, including Australia, Denmark, Italy, and South America. In his autobiography, Nazi intelligence officer Reinhard Gehlen claimed that Bormann had been a Soviet spy, and that he had escaped to Moscow. Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal believed that Bormann was living in South America. <b>The</b> <b>West</b> <b>German</b> government declared that its hunt for Bormann was over in 1971.|$|E
5|$|In 1965, {{historian}} Joseph Wulf {{proposed that}} the Wannsee House should {{be made into a}} Holocaust memorial and document centre, but <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>German</b> government was not interested at that time. The building was in use as a school, and funding was not available. Despondent at the failure of the project and <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>German</b> government's failure to pursue and convict Nazi war criminals, Wulf committed suicide in 1974.|$|E

50|$|Under {{pressure}} from the Americans {{in the south and}} the British in <b>the</b> <b>west,</b> <b>the</b> <b>German</b> troops threw themselves against the Ecouché stranglehold. Ferocious confrontations pitted German armoured vehicles and infantry against the French position, which had to resist them in order to retain the Udon junction.|$|R
5|$|The British {{military}} {{was surprised by}} the attack on Convoy Faith, as it had been believed that the Condors no longer posed a serious threat. In response, the convoy route between Britain and Africa was moved to <b>the</b> <b>west.</b> <b>The</b> <b>German</b> Condor force attempted to repeat its success against Convoy Faith by carrying out similar attacks on other convoys, but sustained heavy losses from Allied anti-aircraft guns and aircraft.|$|R

5|$|In 1949, the {{political}} climate was changing and the ban on forming veterans' associations had been lifted. Encouraged by the shifting tone of the World War II discourse and the courting of the Wehrmacht veterans by <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>German</b> government and political parties, former Waffen-SS members came forward to campaign for their rights.|$|E

50|$|On 12 April, the Sixth Army renewed its {{attack in}} the south, towards the {{important}} supply centre of Hazebrouck, another 10 km to <b>the</b> <b>west.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Germans</b> advanced some 2 - 4 km and captured Merville. On 13 April they were stopped by the First Australian Division, which had been transferred to the area. The British Fourth Division defended Hinges Ridge, the Fifth Division held Nieppe Forest and the 33rd Division was also involved.|$|R

5|$|In August 1979, Pertec {{agreed to}} sell a 45% stake to North American Philips for $37 million. Before the deal was complete, Pertec agreed to be {{acquired}} by <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>German</b> computer company, Triumph-Adler, for $120 million. In 1978, Pertec had sales of $150 million and Triumph-Adler had sales of $466 million.|$|E
5|$|Perceived by <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>German</b> {{government}} to be a Nazi organisation, HIAG was disbanded {{at the federal level}} in 1992. HIAG's last chairman was Hubert Meyer, who provided access to the previously closed HIAG archives to several researchers, including Parker. Parker used the HIAG materials in his 2014 study of Joachim Peiper.|$|E
5|$|As <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>German</b> public's {{awareness}} of the SS atrocities grew in the 1970s and 1980s, the attitudes towards Waffen-SS veterans shifted dramatically. The federal organisation and the local groups were ostracised, with their meetings and commemorations greeted with protests. At the same time, neo-Nazi and nationalist movements found in the Waffen-SS an icon to project their understanding of World War II.|$|E
50|$|On September 17, 1939, {{following}} German aggression on Poland and Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, Soviet forces invaded eastern Poland. As bulk of Polish Army was {{concentrated in}} <b>the</b> <b>west,</b> fighting <b>Germans,</b> <b>the</b> Soviets met with little resistance and their troops quickly moved westwards, occupying Voivodeship’s area with ease.|$|R
50|$|Finally, on May 26 of {{the year}} 17, Germanicus celebrated a triumph for his victory over lower Germany and his uncle sent him off to the east.

5|$|At Euro 1972, Belgium {{finished}} third after losing 1–2 against West Germany and beating Hungary 2–1. The team's best continental result is their second place at Euro 1980 in Italy. By finishing as group winners, Belgium reached the final, to face West Germany. <b>The</b> <b>West</b> <b>German</b> Horst Hrubesch scored first, but René Vandereycken equalised {{courtesy of a}} penalty. Two minutes before the regular playing time ended, Hrubesch scored again denying Belgium a first European title.|$|E
5|$|For its actions, <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>German</b> {{government}} was criticised by Israel and other parties, {{in some cases}} combined with allegations that the hijacking had been staged or at least tolerated with theories of a secret agreement between the German government and Black September Organization - release of the surviving terrorists in exchange for assurances of no further attacks on Germany.|$|E
5|$|In 1936 she {{was officially}} renamed TCG Yavuz ("Ship of the Turkish Republic Yavuz"); {{she carried the}} remains of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk from Istanbul to İzmit in 1938. Yavuz {{remained}} the flagship of the Turkish Navy until she was decommissioned in 1950. She was scrapped in 1973, after <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>German</b> government declined an invitation to buy her back from Turkey. She was the last surviving ship built by the Imperial German Navy, and the longest-serving dreadnought-type ship in any navy.|$|E
50|$|After the {{outbreak}} of World War I in 1914, Ruanda-Urundi {{was the scene of}} fighting between German and Belgian forces from the Belgian Congo which bordered the region to <b>the</b> <b>west.</b> In April 1916, as part of the East African Campaign, Belgian-Congolese forces invaded Ruanda-Urundi and by September most of <b>the</b> <b>west</b> of <b>German</b> East Africa was under Belgian occupation while forces from the British Empire fought elsewhere in the colony.|$|R
500|$|On 26 May, Operation Dynamo officially commenced, {{in which}} large French and British contingents {{were to be}} {{evacuated}} to the United Kingdom. By that time, the Royal Navy had already withdrawn 28,000 British non-fighting troops. Boulogne had fallen and Calais was about to, leaving Dunkirk, Ostend and Zeebrugge as the only viable ports {{which could be used}} for evacuation. The advance of the 14th German Army would not leave Ostend available for much longer. To <b>the</b> <b>west,</b> <b>the</b> <b>German</b> Army Group A had reached Dunkirk and were [...] from its centre on the morning of 27 May, bringing the port within artillery range.|$|R
50|$|Low German (also {{referred}} to as Low Saxon), an officially recognized regional language in Germany and the Netherlands, the direct descendant of Old Saxon. Sometimes (e.g. by nds and nds-nl Wikipedia) considered two languages divided by today’s Netherlands-German border on account of Dutch influences in <b>the</b> <b>west</b> and <b>German</b> influences in the east; closely related to Frisian, more distantly to German.|$|R
5|$|Indeed, since Willy Brandt {{had become}} {{chancellor}} in 1969, {{there had been}} a change of <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>German</b> attitude towards the Arab–Israeli conflict. The earlier conservative governments had been considered pointedly pro-Israel (especially during the mid-1960s with the Six-Day War), which had resulted in a number of Arab states breaking off diplomatic relations to West Germany. With Egypt and Tunisia, these had only been restored shortly before the 1972 Olympics.|$|E

Foreign decorations he received include <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>German</b> Federal Cross of Merit, Belgian Order of Leopold, Japanese Order of the Sacred Treasure, South Korean Order of Diplomatic Service Merit, and Republic of China Order of the Brilliant Star.|$|E
5|$|The use of lethal {{force on}} the Berlin Wall was an {{integral}} part of the East German state's policy towards its border system. Nonetheless, the East German government was well aware that border killings had undesirable consequences. <b>The</b> <b>West</b> <b>German,</b> US, British and French authorities protested killings when they occurred and the international reputation of East Germany was damaged as a result. It also undermined the East German government's support at home.|$|E
50|$|The Heide-Itzehoe Geest (Heide-Itzehoe Geest) is a {{division}} of a larger natural region in <b>the</b> <b>west</b> of <b>the</b> <b>German</b> state of Schleswig-Holstein. It belongs to the Hohe Geest and thus to the Schleswig-Holstein Geest natural region.|$|R

5|$|When the Lufthansa {{airplane}} {{was seized}} by sympathisers of Black September during the Beirut-Ankara part of a multi-stopover flight from Damascus to Frankfurt, <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>German</b> authorities complied with the demand of having the prisoners released. They were handed over at Zagreb Airport, and the hijacked aircraft was flown to Tripoli, where all hostages were released. The liberated Munich attackers were granted asylum by Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} Lent's awards were {{auctioned}} at Sotheby's, London, on 18 July 1966. The items were bought in one lot by an anonymous bidder {{for the total}} sum of £500. The purchaser was Adolf Galland, the former Inspector of Fighters, {{acting on behalf of}} <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>German</b> Ministry of Defence. The awards were sold by Helmut Lent's elder daughter after consultation with her mother who was in urgent need for money to pay for an operation. The Ministry presented the collection to the Wehrgeschichtliches Museum Rastatt.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with other}} veterans' organisations, HIAG campaigned for the {{immediate}} amnesty and early release of war criminals still in Allied captivity. This issue was significant, as most of these organisations made their cooperation {{in the area of}} rearmament contingent on the satisfactory resolution in this area. It was partly for this reason that <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>German</b> government was sympathetic to the fate of these individuals and made every effort to secure their early release. Chancellor Adenauer even met with Kurt Meyer in Werl Prison when he went there on an inspection tour.|$|E
50|$|Tura {{was formed}} in 1925 through a merger of the clubs FC Normannia and FC Borussia and drew its {{membership}} from the working class. The combined side's lineage also included the club FC Regina Bonn founded in 1904. Like Bonner FV, Tura played as a tier II team and their greatest success was in winning <b>the</b> 1962 <b>west</b> <b>German</b> amateur championship and their subsequent appearance in the national amateur final, which they lost 0:1 to SC Tegel.|$|R
5000|$|He {{was blind}} {{because of his}} wounds and walked with his left arm {{extended}} forward. His right hand rested on a gun holster. He walked along the parade grounds wearing a ragged uniform, but his head was held high. The entire division was shocked at the sight. Approaching a shell-hole, he turned his face toward <b>the</b> <b>west.</b> <b>The</b> <b>German</b> general suddenly saluted this last defender of the Brest Fortress, {{and the rest of}} the officers followed suit. The Red Army officer drew a handgun and shot himself in the head. He fell on the ground facing Germany. A deep-drawn sigh aired over the parade grounds. We all stood 'frozen' in awe of this brave man.|$|R
25|$|During {{the early}} part of the Battle of France the SF Thionville was {{relatively}} quiet. Both sides kept up shelling and harassing attacks, but there were no major engagements in the sector in May and early June 1940. Elsewhere, the situation was deteriorating fast. To <b>the</b> <b>west,</b> <b>the</b> <b>German</b> 16th Army was advancing up the valley of the Meuse to Verdun, aiming for Metz and Nancy. In the center, the German 1st Army had broken through at the Sarre on 15 June. To the east, the Rhine was crossed on the same day. German armies were moving freely behind French lines with the goal of encircling France's field armies, capturing the cities of Alsace and Lorraine, and cutting off the fixed fortifications.|$|R
