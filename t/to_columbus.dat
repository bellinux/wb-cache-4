5|$|Ellis {{started the}} 1967 season with Columbus.

5|$|Columbus Crew and Toronto FC have {{competed for}} the Trillium Cup since 2008. Although a {{manufactured}} rivalry, the meetings have since sparked bitterness. On March 28, 2009, approximately 1,700 Toronto FC supporters travelled <b>to</b> <b>Columbus</b> Crew Stadium and witnessed a 1–1 draw, {{during which they}} lit a number of flares and allegedly committed vandalism. Following the game some altercations broke out between the two supporter groups. Overwhelmed security called police who ended the melees and made arrests, at which time a TFC fan was tasered while being subdued. The first rematch back in Columbus Crew Stadium following the incident was boycotted by Toronto FC supporters in wake of restrictions imposed on them by Crew officials.|$|E
5|$|From {{its heyday}} of the 1850s until the Great Depression in the 1930s, Jeffersonville was the leading center of U.S. {{steamboat}} production, due largely to its excellent harbor, which remained the deepest in the surrounding area. Many individuals {{who lived in the}} district worked at the Howard Shipyards, that became Jeffboat in the nearby town of Port Fulton, which was eventually annexed into Jeffersonville. The town gained its first railroad in 1852, connecting <b>to</b> <b>Columbus,</b> Indiana, and {{with the opening of the}} Fourteenth Street Bridge in 1870, became a railroad center. The city became an important distribution center during the Civil War for the Union Army, because three railroads connected to Jeffersonville and because the Ohio River served as a defensive barrier against invasion from Confederate attack, it was deemed a safer location than the more vulnerable city of Louisville, Kentucky located on the southern side of the river.|$|E

5|$|The {{fall line}} is the geomorphologic break between the upland region of {{relatively}} hard crystalline basement rock and the coastal plain of softer sedimentary rock. The fall line is most prominent when crossed by a river. It {{is at this point}} that cities developed, because riverboats could not typically travel any farther inland without portaging. In some locations, the rapid change in elevation of the water, and the resulting energy release, made the fall line a good location for water mills, grist mills, and sawmills. Because of the need for a river port leading to the ocean, and a ready supply of water power, settlements developed where rivers crossed the fall line. In Georgia, the Fall Line extends from Augusta, through Macon, and on <b>to</b> <b>Columbus.</b>|$|E

50|$|In 1828, Washington Irving's highly romanticised biography, A History of the Life and Voyages of Christopher Columbus, was {{published}} and mistaken by many for a scholarly work. In Book II, Chapter IV of this biography, Irving gave a largely fictional {{account of the}} meetings of a commission established by the Spanish sovereigns <b>to</b> examine <b>Columbus's</b> proposals. One of his more fanciful embellishments was a highly unlikely tale that the more ignorant and bigoted members on the commission had raised scriptural objections <b>to</b> <b>Columbus's</b> assertions that the Earth was spherical.|$|R
