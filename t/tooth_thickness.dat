40|$|Key words: NC machining; aligned gear; gear chamfering; {{technical}} study. Abstract: {{numerical control}} system {{is used to}} control the gear hob and gear blank in autorotation and linkage generative movement, to realize the machining of teeth shape and teeth dividing; {{and at the same}} time it controls the vertical displacement of the gear hob and the horizontal displacement of gear blank, to make a circular arc track whose radius is the sum of gear blank’s radius and gear hob’s radius, thus realizing the NC machining of circular-arc aligned gear. Before and after the machining of teeth form, transition arc is used to finish the trimming and thinning of the <b>teeth</b> <b>thickness</b> at the <b>teeth</b> end; on the prerequisite of machining the circular-arc aligned gear, this method successfully solves the puzzle of gear chamfering, and discharges all gear burr into the lower end of the teeth. The advantage of this machining method lies in that when the hob cuts deeper, as the both side-blades are cutting the work-piece at the same time, the thinning on both sides are quite symmetrical, and the fine symmetry remains during the uniform change of the <b>teeth</b> <b>thickness.</b> So, the machining precision of the parts is prior to the requirements in the drawing, and this method yields good effect, which broadens the application of NC technology...|$|R
50|$|Standard profile angles are {{established}} {{in connection with}} standard proportions of gear teeth and standard gear cutting tools. Involute gears operate together correctly after a change of center distance, and gears designed for a different center distance can be generated correctly by standard tools. A change of center distance is accomplished by changes in operating values for pitch diameter, circular pitch, diametral pitch, pressure angle, and <b>tooth</b> <b>thicknesses</b> or backlash. The same involute gear may be used under conditions that change its operating pitch diameter and pressure angle. Unless {{there is a good}} reason for doing otherwise, it is practical to consider that the pitch and the profile angle of a single gear correspond to the pitch and the profile angle of the hob or cutter used to generate its teeth.|$|R

40|$|Scans of {{the human}} genome have {{identified}} many loci as potential targets of recent selection, but exploration of these candidates is required to verify the accuracy of genomewide scans and clarify the importance of adaptive evolution in recent human history. We present analyses of one such candidate, enamelin, whose protein product operates in tooth enamel formation in 100 individuals from 10 populations. Evidence of a recent selective sweep at this locus confirms the signal of selection found by genomewide scans. Patterns of polymorphism in enamelin correspond with population-level differences in <b>tooth</b> enamel <b>thickness,</b> and selection on enamel thickness may drive adaptive enamelin evolution in human populations. We characterize a high-frequency nonsynonymous derived allele in non-African populations. The polymorphism occurs in codon 648, resulting in a nonconservative change from threonine to isoleucine, suggesting that the allele may affect enamelin function. Sequences of exons from 12 primate species show evidence of positive selection on enamelin. In primates, it has been documented that enamel thickness correlates with diet. Our work shows that bursts of adaptive enamelin evolution occur on primate lineages with inferred dietary changes. We hypothesize that among primate species the evolved differences in <b>tooth</b> enamel <b>thickness</b> are correlated with the adaptive evolution of enamelin...|$|R

30|$|The ISO {{standards}} {{specify a}} symmetric form and a pressure angle of 20 ° for a standard rack tool.

Furthermore, although a pressure angle sufficiently greater than the limit of the tooth tip cannot be achieved, this can be solved by making the pressure angle {{on each side of the}} tooth asymmetric. Unidirectional torque transfer is the principal factor in general gearing, so there may be some issues with the strength on the low-pressure side being weaker.|$|R

40|$|In Primates, enamel {{thickness}} variation stems from an evolutionary interplay between functional/adaptive constraints (ecology) and the strict control mechanisms of the morphogenetic program.

In this test study on nine extant and fossil hominids we investigated the degree of covariation in enamel proportions between 25 pairs of mandibular dm 2 and M 1 by a so-called “lateral enamel thickness diphyodontic index”. The results did not provide an unambiguous picture, but rather suggest complex patterns likely resulting from the influence of many interactive factors.

50|$|Standard {{practice}} {{is to make}} allowance for half the backlash in the <b>tooth</b> <b>thickness</b> of each gear. However, if the pinion (the smaller of the two gears) is significantly smaller than the gear it is meshing with then it is common practice to account {{for all of the}} backlash in the larger gear. This maintains as much strength as possible in the pinion's teeth. The amount of additional material removed when making the gears depends on the pressure angle of the teeth. For a 14.5° pressure angle the extra distance the cutting tool is moved in equals the amount of backlash desired. For a 20° pressure angle the distance equals 0.73 times the amount of backlash desired.|$|E
5000|$|Backlash is {{the error}} in motion {{that occurs when}} gears change direction. It exists because there is always some gap between the {{trailing}} face of the driving tooth and the leading face of the tooth behind it on the driven gear, and that gap must be closed before force can be transferred in the new direction. The term [...] "backlash" [...] {{can also be used}} to refer to the size of the gap, not just the phenomenon it causes; thus, one could speak of a pair of gears as having, for example, [...] "0.1 mm of backlash." [...] A pair of gears could be designed to have zero backlash, but this would presuppose perfection in manufacturing, uniform thermal expansion characteristics throughout the system, and no lubricant. Therefore, gear pairs are designed to have some backlash. It is usually provided by reducing the <b>tooth</b> <b>thickness</b> of each gear by half the desired gap distance. In the case of a large gear and a small pinion, however, the backlash is usually taken entirely off the gear and the pinion is given full sized teeth. Backlash can also be provided by moving the gears further apart. The backlash of a gear train equals the sum of the backlash of each pair of gears, so in long trains backlash can become a problem.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the thickness of buccal and palatal alveolar bone and buccal bony curvature below root apex in maxillary anterior teeth of Korean adults using Cone-beam CT images. MATERIALS AND METHODS. The 3 D image was reconstructed with dicom file obtained through CBCT from 20 - 39 year old Korean subjects (n = 20). The thickness of buccal and palatal plate, root diameter, the buccal bony curvature angle below root apex and the distance from root apex to the deepest point of buccal bony curvature were measured on maxillary anterior teeth area using OnDemand 3 D program. RESULTS. Mean thickness of buccal plate 3 mm below CEJ was 0. 68 ± 0. 29 mm at central incisor, 0. 76 ± 0. 59 mm at lateral incisor, and 1. 07 ± 0. 80 mm at canine. Mean thickness of palatal plate 3 mm below CEJ was 1. 53 ± 0. 55 mm of central incisor, 1. 18 ± 0. 66 mm of lateral incisor, 1. 42 ± 0. 77 mm of canine. Bucco-lingual diameter 3 mm below CEJ was 5. 13 ± 0. 37 mm of central incisor, 4. 58 ± 0. 46 mm of lateral incisor, and 5. 93 ± 0. 47 mm of canine. Buccal bony curvature angle below root apex was 134. 7 ± 17. 5 �at central incisor, 151. 0 ± 13. 9 �at lateral incisor, 153. 0 ± 9. 5 �at canine. Distance between root apex and the deepest point of buccal bony curvature of central incisor was 3. 67 ± 1. 28 mm at central incisor, 3. 90 ± 1. 51 mm at lateral incisor, and 5. 13 ± 1. 70 mm at canine. CONCLUSION. Within the limitation of this study in Korean adults, the thickness of maxillary anterior buccal plate was very thin within 1 mm and the thickness of palatal plate was thick, relatively. The buccal bony curvature below root apex of maxillary central incisor was higher than that of lateral incisor and canine and it seems that the buccal bony plate below root apex of central incisor is most curved.
