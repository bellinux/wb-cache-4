[...] He has pledged to support state governments {{in their efforts to}} improve standardized <b>test</b> <b>provisions</b> by upgrading the standards they are set to measure. To do this, the federal government gives states grants to help develop and implement assessments based on higher standards so they can more accurately measure school progress. This mirrors provisions in the Race to the Top program that require states to measure individual achievement through sophisticated data collection from kindergarten to higher education.|$|E
40|$|The {{rationale}} for writing this thesis {{was prompted by}} years of working with displaced people and refugees in Africa. Though the African people north of the equator are generally regarded as transient people, very few move {{beyond the boundaries of}} the continent of Africa. The instability of the political and socio-economic conditions on the continent has exacerbated the current volatile cycle of poverty and human instability. The effects of the political and socio-economic conditions have resulted in a huge displacement of people and the emergence of refugees. Few refugees are able to be identified by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees for resettlement outside Africa, while others take the courageous step of fleeing and seeking refuge on another continent as asylum seekers. In 1960 New Zealand ascribed to the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of refugees and actively participated in a refugee quota programme and allowed asylum seekers to apply for refugee status. In an endeavour to answer the question "why long-term welfare beneficiaries" in relation to African people, this thesis analysed the integration process of African people and sought to establish what domestic or public policies impact or influence the settlement and integration of refugees and asylum seekers in New Zealand. While there are many factors that influence successful integration, however this study identifies barriers to sustainable employment as one of the major contributors. The literature review and the outcome of the research undertaken showed that barriers to employment do exist for refugees and asylum seekers. The literature review analyses the legal aspect that defines a refugee and also outlines the process followed for the determination of quota refugees. The review further describes the journey of the study population to New Zealand. New Zealand has an established welfare system therefore the study traces the discourse within welfare history and policy that relate to the criteria and obligations under which benefits are granted to refugees and asylum seekers. It is argued that present jobseeker agreements and work <b>test</b> <b>provisions</b> when agreed upon does assist the development and work readiness of the refugee and asylum seeker and does not contribute to long-term welfare beneficiaries. It is concluded that the absence of an overarching national domestic or public policy on settlement and integration could contribute to long-term welfare beneficiaries (as defined in the welfare policy of the Ministry for Social Development). In conclusion, policy changes to certain aspects of the Social Security Act 1964, language training, organs of civil society intervention and employer interaction need to be addressed in relation to refugees from the Horn of Africa living in New Zealand to allow them to become employable in a shorter period of time...|$|E

Public funding of MGL is more efficient at providing genetic tests in all scenarios except the most optimistic private funding scenario. Funding MGL through public funds using at least a partial per-test funding strategy provides B.

In this paper we build upon a real case – namely that of breast cancer genetic testing – in order to point to the shortcomings of the paradigm currently driving healthcare delivery. In particular, we put forward a viable analytical model {{for the construction of a}} proper decisional process broadening the scope of medical gaze onto human experience of illness. This model revolves around four main conceptual axes: (i) communicating information; (ii) informing decisions; (iii) respecting narratives; (iv) empowering decision-making.

40|$|Crest-fixed steel {{claddings}} made of thin, {{high strength}} steel often suffer from local pull-through failures at their screw connections during high wind events such as storms and hurricanes. Adequate design provisions are not available for these cladding systems except for the expensive <b>testing</b> <b>provisions.</b> Since the local pull-through failures in the less ductile steel claddings are initiated by transverse splitting at the fastener holes, numerical studies {{have not been able}} to determine the pull-through failure loads. Numerical studies could be used if a reliable splitting criterion is available. Therefore a series of two-span cladding and small scale tests was conducted on a range of crest-fixed steel cladding systems under simulated wind uplift loads. The strains in the sheeting around the critical central support screw fastener holes were measured until the pull-through failure occurred. This paper presents the details of the experimental investigation and the results including a strain criterion for the local pull-through failures in crest-fixed steel claddings...|$|R

Methods We analysed data from 2016 sexually active women in Zimbabwe and South Africa. Women were followed quarterly, and specimens obtained at the closing visit from previously HSV- 2 seronegative women were retested for HSV- 2 antibodies using Focus HerpeSelect Elisa. The first visit at which the participant tested positive for HSV- 2 was defined by back-testing. We compared the incidence of HSV- 2 after randomisation between study arms in both intent-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol populations. Results 210 women acquired HSV- 2 during study participation (HSV incidence: 6. 8 cases/ 100 women years). Allocation to the intervention arm was found to offer no benefit in reduction of HSV- 2 by modified ITT (HR 1. 03, 95 % CI 0. 78 to 1. 35; p 0. 85) or per protocol analysis (HR 0. 87, 95 % CI 0. 61 to 1. 24; p 0. 45).
