5|$|In {{accordance}} with their expected mission, <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> could transport up to six naval commandos armed with 612 M-66 or M-71 limpet mines.

50|$|One of {{the unique}} {{features}} of the Nordland is its ballast system. Dozens of fist size round rocks are placed {{at the bottom of}} <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> to keep <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> weighted down.

As a result, the five boats of the class were transferred to the Imperial German Navy on 28 November 1914 after the advance payment of 2 million Kronen had been returned. Germaniawerft was then awarded Kriegsauftrag D, hence the type was known as UD.|$|E
5|$|On October 11, the Port Said Sector was {{reinforced}} with the 103rd Sa'iqa battalion of the 139th Sa'iqa Group. The battalion had arrived from Cairo, {{and three days}} later the sector received ten new fiberglass boats from Alexandria. <b>The</b> <b>boats</b> however had been sent without necessary maintenance of <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> themselves or their engines.

5|$|The six-boat {{group that}} {{included}} UB-43 and UB-47 was ordered in July 1915, and both boats {{had been laid}} down in early September. This group was selected by the German Admiralstab for deployment to the Mediterranean, but, unlike the smaller UB I boats, they could not as easily be transported overland by rail. Weser prepared <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> for rail shipment by cutting the boat sections longitudinally, and sent all the materials, along with German shipyard workers, to Pola, where <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> were reassembled. UB-43 was launched in early April 1916, while UB-47 followed in June.|$|E

5|$|U-9 {{was laid}} down on 31 December 1913, {{the third of}} the U-7 boats. Her {{construction}} was slated to be complete within 29 to 33 months.

5|$|Upon {{arriving}} at the bay where the pirates were said to be, Alligator dispatched boats to engage the enemy vessels, as the water was too shallow for the warship to engage them directly. With Allen personally commanding one of <b>the</b> <b>boats,</b> the Americans assaulted the schooner Revenge. Although the Navy was able to force the pirates into abandoning Revenge, the buccaneers managed to fight {{their way out of}} the bay and inflict seven casualties.

5|$|After the Austro-Hungarian Navy's 1 February 1913 order, {{the first}} two boats, U-7 and U-8, were laid down at Germaniawerft on 1 November.

50|$|The sweep, known also as the steersman, steers <b>the</b> dragon <b>boat</b> with a sweep oar rigged at {{the rear}} of <b>the</b> <b>boat,</b> {{generally}} on <b>the</b> left side.

5|$|Determined {{to prevent}} the Dutch from {{refloating}} the grounded ships, Admiral Pellew ordered landing parties to assemble in <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> of his squadron alongside Terpsichore. From there, under distant covering fire from the British frigates, Fleetwood Pellew led <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> against Phoenix, coming under fire from the grounded vessels and gun batteries ashore. Passing through the bombardment from the shoreline, Pellew's men boarded Phoenix {{to find that the}} Dutch crew had just abandoned the vessel, scuttling the frigate as they departed. Although now useless as a ship, Phoenixs guns were turned on the other beached vessels to cover the British boats as they spread out to board and burn them. This operation was followed by the destruction of 20 grounded merchant ships in the harbour, although two others were successfully refloated and captured. In a final act before withdrawing to the squadron offshore, Captain Pellew set fire to the wreck of Phoenix, burning the ship to the waterline. The entire operation was conducted under heavy fire from the shore, but British casualties were only one Royal Marine killed and three men wounded.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>boat</b> boy or boat bearer is {{a junior}} altar server {{position}} found in Catholic and Anglican Churches. The {{role of a}} boat boy is to assist the thurifer, the senior altar server who carries <b>the</b> thurible. <b>The</b> <b>boat</b> bearer carries <b>the</b> <b>boat,</b> a small metal container, Latin navicula, which holds the supplies of incense. <b>The</b> <b>boat</b> has a small spoon inside {{which is used to}} transfer the grains of incense onto the red-hot charcoals in the thurible.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>boat</b> {{was built}} in 1920 in Kiel, Germany at the Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft shipyard. <b>The</b> <b>boat</b> was once run as a two-master and was almost 30 meters long.

5|$|During their active service, <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> of the U-20 class {{suffered}} from unreliable engines which compounded the already poor handling characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>boats.</b> None {{of the class}} had any successes and two of their number were sunk during the war. U-23 was the first sunk when she went down on 21 February 1918 from an explosive paravane in the Straits of Otranto. U-20, the lead boat of the class, sank in July 1918 when she was torpedoed by the Italian submarine F-12 in the Tagliamento estuary. The remaining two boats were surrendered at war's end, with U-21 being ceded to Italy in 1920, and U-22 to France; both were broken up.|$|E
5|$|Filming resumed {{two days}} later at Elstree, where Spielberg swiftly filmed the library, Portuguese freighter, and catacombs sequences. The {{steamship}} fight in the prologue's 1938 portion was filmed in three days on a sixty-by-forty-feet deck built on gimbals at Elstree. A dozen dump tanks—each holding three hundred imperial gallons (360 U.S. gallons; 3000lb.) of water—were used in the scene. Henry's house was filmed at Mill Hill, London. Indiana and Kazim's fight in Venice {{in front of a}} ship's propeller was filmed in a water tank at Elstree. Spielberg used a long focus lens to make it appear the actors were closer to the propeller than they really were. Two days later, on August 4, another portion of the boat chase using Hacker Craft sport boats, was filmed at Tilbury Docks in Essex. The shot of <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> passing between two ships was achieved by first cabling the ships off so they would be safe. The ships were moved together while <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> passed between, close enough that one of <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> scraped the sides of the ships. An empty speedboat containing dummies was launched from a floating platform between the ships amid fire and smoke that helped obscure the platform. The stunt was performed twice because the boat landed too short of the camera in the first attempt. The following day, filming in England wrapped at the Royal Masonic School in Rickmansworth, which doubled for Indiana's college (as it had in Raiders of the Lost Ark).|$|E

When <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> did resume its journey, the lockkeeper followed on horseback, {{all the way to}} Cumberland (the end of the canal) with a club threatening to settle things.|$|R
5|$|From 1915, both boats {{conducted}} reconnaissance cruises out {{of either}} Trieste or Pola.

5|$|From January to June 2016, {{the city}} bought 4 boats for the {{proposed}} ferry service for a combined total of $6 million, with plans {{for a total of}} 30 boats over the coming years. Hornblower Cruises requested 13 boats for the first routes, each costing $4 million each. The total combined cost of <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> is more than $70 million. In addition, the city was building 13 ferry landings at a cost of $85 million, as well as a boat depot. One of these docks, in Astoria, was built privately as part of the Astoria Cove development. In September 2016, construction on 19 ferries began at two shipyards in Bayou La Batre, Alabama, and Jeanerette, Louisiana, with 200 full-time employees working on <b>the</b> <b>boats.</b> The contract with the two shipyards is unusual because shipbuilding contracts are usually with only one company. However, NYC Ferry executives had purposely chosen these two companies because of their expertise and because of the unlikeliness that both shipyards would be destroyed by hurricanes.|$|E
