The true BBT can only be obtained by continuous <b>temperature</b> <b>monitoring</b> through internally worn temperature sensors. In women, ovulation will trigger a rise in BBT between 0.2º and 0.5°C. (0.5 and 1.°F) that lasts approximately until the next menstruation. This temperature shift may be used to determine the onset of post-ovulatory infertility. (See ref. 30) ...|$|E

Two main changes in Lake Kivu's {{physical}} state that have brought attention to the possible limnic eruption are the high rates of methane dissociation and the rising surface temperature. Thorough research of historical and present <b>temperature</b> <b>monitoring</b> show that Lake Kivu's surface temperature is increasing by approximately 0.12°C per decade. It is located very close to a potential trigger, Mount Nyiragongo, an active volcano that erupted in January 2002, in an active earthquake zone and close to other active volcanoes.|$|E

This device is reusable and intended for ear temperature measurement {{as well as}} the armpit <b>temperature</b> <b>monitor</b> for the person above two years old. Device Description: The Wireless body <b>temperature</b> <b>monitor,</b> BTM-DIX series include the BTM-D IC, D, E, F, G and H, which are the battery-operated electronic devices with intended to be worn at left arm to <b>monitor</b> the armpit <b>temperature</b> continuously. In addition, BTM-D 1 C has additional function of ear thermometer. The device is composed of two operational parts, the receiver and armband. The receiver is the main operation unit on which the ear thermometer, the measuring circuit, LCD display control circuit and the main operation keys are included. And the armband was designed and constructed with the thermo sensor and the signal communication unit. For the monitoring operation, both receiver and armband shall be switched on. Sooner after these two parts are switched on, the wireless signal communication will be set up between receiver and armband. The temperature monitorin...|$|R
