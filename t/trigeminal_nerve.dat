5|$|The medial {{zone of the}} {{anterior}} and posterior lobes constitutes the spinocerebellum, also known as paleocerebellum. This sector of the cerebellum functions mainly to fine-tune body and limb movements. It receives proprioceptive input from the dorsal columns of the spinal cord (including the spinocerebellar tract) and from the cranial <b>trigeminal</b> <b>nerve,</b> {{as well as from}} visual and auditory systems. It sends fibers to deep cerebellar nuclei that, in turn, project to both the cerebral cortex and the brain stem, thus providing modulation of descending motor systems.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternate}} hypothesis {{suggested by}} Benoit et al. involves {{some kind of}} sensory organ occupying the maxillary fossa. Uniquely among therapsids, the canal within the maxilla is exposed {{on the back side}} of the maxillary fossa, which implies that the canal, carrying the <b>trigeminal</b> <b>nerve,</b> would probably have extended across the fossa, outside of the outline of the skull. Benoit et al. hypothesized that the fossa may have supported a specialized sensory organ analogous to the pit organ of pit vipers and some other snakes, or alternatively a ganglion of nerve cells. It is also possible that this organ functioned as a replacement for the parietal eye in Euchambersia, like the pit organ does in pit vipers. However, such an expanded sensory organ would be unprecedented among tetrapods, and the few other therocephalians that also lack a parietal eye do not have a maxillary fossa either. Thus, Benoit et al. considered the venom hypothesis as being more plausible.|$|E
5|$|The pain pathway {{is mostly}} {{transmitted}} via myelinated Aδ (sharp or stabbing pain) and unmyelinated C nerve fibers (slow, dull, aching, or burning pain) of the <b>trigeminal</b> <b>nerve,</b> which supplies sensation {{to the teeth}} and gums via many divisions and branches. Initially, pain is felt while noxious stimuli are applied (such as cold). Continued exposure decreases firing thresholds of the nerves, allowing normally non-painful stimuli to trigger pain (allodynia). Should the insult continue, noxious stimuli produce larger discharges in the nerve, perceived as more intense pain. Spontaneous pain may occur if the firing threshold is decreased so it can fire without stimulus (hyperalgesia). The physical component of pain is processed in the medullary spinal cord and perceived in the frontal cortex. Because pain perception involves overlapping sensory systems and an emotional component, individual responses to identical stimuli are variable.|$|E

After a marked degeneration of cells, crisscross multiple proliferative foci of transformed spindle cells appeared at the 3 rd passage culture from 2 and 8 -day-old rats, but not form 30 -day-old rats. The transformed cells with S- 100 protein and basal lamina had Schwann cell characteristics. Transformed spindle cells continued to form a crisscross pattern more than 700 days and some transformed spindle cells became round in shape 3 - 6 months after the primary culture. These transformed cells were transplantable to newborn S-D rats and the transplanted tumors were histologically {{similar to those of}} malignant Schwannoma of <b>trigeminal</b> <b>nerves</b> induced by ENU. Round-shaped transformed cells were more malignant than spindle-shaped cells and produced rapidly growing transplanted tumors. Spontaneous transformation with multinucleated giant cells occurred in one of the control cultures. These results indicate that the sequential changes of ENU-treated <b>trigeminal</b> <b>nerves</b> in vitro were corresponded to developmental changes of malignant Schwannoma in vivo induced by ENU.

5|$|CT {{scanning}} of {{the known}} specimens of Euchambersia by Benoit and colleagues was subsequently used to provide more concrete support in favour of the venom hypothesis. The canals leading into and from the maxillary fossae, as revealed by the scans, would primarily have supported the <b>trigeminal</b> <b>nerve</b> as well as blood vessels. However, {{the fact that the}} canals also directly lead to the root of the canines would suggest that they had a secondary role in venom delivery. In all, Euchambersia seems to have had a venom gland (housed in the maxillary fossae), a delivery mechanism of the venom (the maxillary canals), and an instrument by which a wound for venom delivery can be inflicted (the ridged canines), which satisfy the criteria of a venomous animal as defined by Wolfgang Bücherl. Benoit et al. noted that this does not conclusively demonstrate that Euchambersia was actually venomous, especially given the previously stated objections. Additionally, there are no living animals with a delivery system analogous to the proposed system for Euchambersia (most deliver venom through the lower jaw, while snakes have specialized ducts.|$|E
5|$|Making {{up about}} 2 {{percent of cases}} of paralytic polio, bulbar polio occurs when {{poliovirus}} invades and destroys nerves within the bulbar region of the brain stem. The bulbar region is a white matter pathway that connects the cerebral cortex to the brain stem. The destruction of these nerves weakens the muscles supplied by the cranial nerves, producing symptoms of encephalitis, and causes difficulty breathing, speaking and swallowing. Critical nerves affected are the glossopharyngeal nerve (which partially controls swallowing and functions in the throat, tongue movement, and taste), the vagus nerve (which sends signals to the heart, intestines, and lungs), and the accessory nerve (which controls upper neck movement). Due to the effect on swallowing, secretions of mucus may build up in the airway, causing suffocation. Other signs and symptoms include facial weakness (caused by destruction of the <b>trigeminal</b> <b>nerve</b> and facial nerve, which innervate the cheeks, tear ducts, gums, and muscles of the face, among other structures), double vision, difficulty in chewing, and abnormal respiratory rate, depth, and rhythm (which may lead to respiratory arrest).

40|$|Melioidosis is a {{potentially}} fatal disease endemic to northern Australia {{which is caused}} by the bacteria Burkholderia pseudomallei. In the Northern Territory in 2009 / 2010, the disease had an incidence of 50 - 100 / 100, 000 *. There is a mortality rate of around 14 %. Purpose: It is unclear how the bacteria penetrate the brain and cause the neurological form of the disease. One potential route is via the olfactory and <b>trigeminal</b> <b>nerves</b> of the nasal cavity. Methods: We inoculated mice with B. pseudomallei for 24 - 48 hrs (n= 6 animals at each timepoint) and analysed them for localisation of the bacteria within the nasal cavity. Results: Two levels of infection occurred. In widespread major infection, the olfactory epithelium rapidly responded by degradation and an immune response which limited the penetration of bacteria in the mucosal layer. In contrast, in low level minor infection, very small numbers of bacteria penetrated the olfactory mucosa without causing degradation of the epithelium or an obvious immune response. In both levels of infection, the bacteria penetrated and colonised the olfactory and <b>trigeminal</b> <b>nerves</b> and migrated directly into the olfactory bulb within central nervous system. Importantly, we have previously determined that the cells of the immune system, macrophages, are largely excluded from olfactory nerve bundles. We instead propose that the olfactory glia are the primary cells responsible for the phagocytosis of bacteria within the olfactory nerve and act to limit the spread of infection. Conclusion: These results demonstrate that B. pseudomallei enters the CNS via the olfactory and <b>trigeminal</b> <b>nerves</b> within 24 hr after inoculation. *Parameswaran, 2012, MJA, 196 : 345 - 348 Faculty of Science, Environment, Engineering and TechnologyFull Tex...|$|R

40|$|Background: Leprosy {{is one of}} {{the most}} common causes of {{peripheral}} neuropathy, perhaps closely matched by diabetic neuropathy. Patterns of peripheral neuropathy in leprosy can be varied, which may include mononeuropathy, mononeuritis multiplex and symmetric polyneuropathy. Cranial nerves, especially facial and <b>trigeminal</b> <b>nerves,</b> are also commonly involved in leprosy. Aims: To find out the pattern and spectrum of cranial nerve involvement in a consecutive series of patients with leprous neuropathy. Settings and Design: A retrospective review of patients admitted with leprosy to the Neurology Department of a tertiary care center. Materials and Methods: All consecutive patients admitted during an 8 -year period (1995 - 2003) and diagnosed to have leprosy were included. They were clinically evaluated to determine the frequency and pattern of cranial nerve involvement. Results: About 18 &#x 0025; (9 / 51) of the leprosy patients seen during that period had clinical evidence of cranial nerve involvement. Facial and <b>trigeminal</b> <b>nerves</b> were the most commonly affected (five and four patients respectively). Conclusions: Cranial nerve involvement is common in leprosy, which emphasizes the need to carefully examine them. Also, one should exclude leprosy in patients presenting with isolated cranial neuropathies...|$|R

40|$|Cancer, one of {{the leading}} causes of death world wide, {{frequently}} exhibits a marked sex preference with respect of incidence, course of disease and survival time. The development of malignant tumors is determined by exogenic factors as well as risk modifying gene variants. The specific causes of cancers and of their sex preference are mostly unknown. The identification of tumor risk modifying gene variants is an essential prerequisite for the development of efficient prevention measures and curative therapies on the long run. Importantly, in contrast to tumor suppressor genes cancer risk modifying gene variants are not necessarily expressed in the tissue the tumor arises from, but also can act systemically. Inbred rodent models are particularly suitable for the analysis of the genetic basis of tumor susceptibility and resistance, respectively, since these animals are genetically identical and can be maintained under standardized living conditions. After application of ethylnitrosourea (ENU) on postnatal day 1, BDIX rats develop malignant tumors of the peripheral nervous system with an incidence of > 85 %, arising from Neu/Erbb 2 mutated premalignant Schwann cells in the <b>trigeminal</b> <b>nerves.</b> In MPNST resistant BDIV rats, the premalignant cells are eliminated under the participation of the immune system, thereby preventing tumor development. Genome wide association analyses using ENU-treated segregating crosses of BDIX and BDIV rats identified seven autosomal loci controlling tumor risk in an allele- and sex-specific manner. Homozygous BDIV alleles at the locus Mss 4 on chromosome 6 mediated tumor resistance in female (BDIV x BDIX) F 2 rats. The effect of the locus was confirmed by ENU application to congenic BDIX. BDIV-Mss 4 a rats. This strain carries BDIV alleles exclusively in the telomeric 60 % of the tumor resistance haplotype, which was previously identified in the F 2 generation. This dissertation included fine mapping of the Mss 4 locus originally spanning 20 Mb to approximately 1. 1 Mb by exposing three additional congenic and subcongenic rat strains, carrying BDIV alleles in different segments of the tumor resistance haplotype, to ENU and subsequently analyzing their tumor incidences and survival times. The fine mapped Mss 4 interval comprised 15 positional candidate genes. Comparative sequencing of protein coding and regulatory portions of the candidate genes in BDIX and BDIV rats, transcriptional analyses in the <b>trigeminal</b> <b>nerves</b> and functional information were used to prioritize candidate genes with respect to their potential relevance for the sex-specific tumor risk. Gpx 2, encoding glutathione peroxidase 2, has been associated with resistance towards tumor initiation repeatedly, and therefore represented a particularly interesting candidate gene. However the <b>trigeminal</b> <b>nerves</b> of the parental {{as well as of the}} (sub) congenic rat strains did not unequivocally express Gpx 2 protein. However, an invasion of Gpx 2 expressing mast cells in the <b>trigeminal</b> <b>nerves</b> of ENU-exposed BDIX and BDIV rats could be noticed. Notably peritoneal BDIV mast cells expressed Gpx 2 to a higher extent than BDIX mast cells. The Esr 2 gene encodes the estrogen receptor beta. While in congenic strains each BDIV insert mediated tumor resistance to a similar degree, only the Mss 4 a fragment mediated a sex-specific effect. In contrast to the Mss 4 c and Mss 4 d fragments, it covers the telomeric third of the tumor resistance haplotype which might contain the BDIV variant of a cofactor of Esr 2. The Med 6 gene constitutes an interesting functional and positional candidate, the BDIV allele of which might interact with Esr 2 to mediate the sex preference of MPNST development by inducing a sex biased regulation of gene expression in <b>trigeminal</b> <b>nerves...</b>|$|R
