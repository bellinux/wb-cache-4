In recent years, more and more researchers are not only describing changes in the host organisms, but also trying to figure out mechanisms beyond these parasitic manipulations. Parasites can manipulate the host through neural and endocrine system using neuromodulators, immunomodulators, neurotransmitters and hormones. Either increase or decrease of hormone levels may cause changes of the infected hosts development, metabolism, reproduction and behaviour. Hosts, whose behaviour is altered via hormonal pathways are mostly developmentally arrested and their feeding and locomotion is terminated.

40|$|EXPULSION OF SHAREHOLDER AND TERMINATION OF HIS PARTICIPATION IN THE LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY ABSTRACT The {{purpose of}} my thesis is {{to analyze the}} legal {{regulation}} regarding exclusion of a shareholder and termination of his participation in a limited liability company in the Czech Republic. I have chosen this topic {{because of a lack}} of scholarly interest in this particular question of corporate law, even though it is a highly practical matter. The study analyzes law, commentaries, books, articles and relevant case law and compares the current legal regulation with the new legal regulation represented by the new Civil Code and the Act on Commercial Corporations. The main contribution of this paper is in a providing a critical perspective on this new legal regulation and in identification of future eventual interpretative problems. The thesis is composed of four chapters, each of which deals with different aspects of a view on problems of unilateral termination of a participation of shareholder in the limited liability company. Chapter One is introductory and explains the provisions of legal regulation of unilateral <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>participation</b> of shareholder.

40|$|Bibliography: leaves 94 - 99. This study investigates {{factors which}} affect the {{motivation}} of volunteer telephone counsellors, including demographic variables as well as volunteers' subjective perceptions of the factors which have influenced their involvement. The {{study was conducted in}} two stages. The first consisted of a demographic analysis of two groups of counsellors from an organisation in the Western Cape, while the second stage involved a qualitative analysis of semi-structured in-depth interviews with respondents who were drawn from these groups. 446 volunteers were selected for demographic analysis, of whom 247 were the full complement of current counsellors in the organisation as of April, 1993, and 199 were ex-volunteers who had terminated their involvement during the preceding three years. Eight demographic variables were recorded for each volunteer: current age, gender, age on joining the organisation, educational level, religious orientation, marital and parental status and length of service. Volunteers were predominantly female (75 %), and were on average middle-aged, well-educated, and Christian (64 %). Approximately half of the group were married. Parents comprised 50 % of the group. The average length of service was approximately five years. Length of service was analysed in relation to each of the other demographic variables in turn in order to discover which factors, if any, were implicated in volunteer turnover. Parental status was the only variable found to be significant in terms of length of service across both current and ex-volunteer groups. A regression analysis performed on the data set as a whole identified parental status as a significant predictor of length of service. The second stage of the study consisted of 23 in-depth interviews. Respondents (12 current volunteers, 11 ex-volunteers) were selected according to a purposive technique which took the form of a systematic, structured sampling strategy in order to maximize the diversity of obtained responses. A descriptive phenomenological perspective was adopted in order to tap the rich, subjective experiences of respondents. Interview data was analysed according to an inductive, constantly comparative approach. Findings based on respondents' self-report suggest that motivational factors underlying volunteer participation are multifaceted and complex, changing in nature ii and salience during the course of involvement (from initial contact with the organisation until <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>participation).</b> Although self-serving motives seemed {{to play a major role}} in influencing participation, especially during the early stages of involvement, altruistic motives appeared to be important in sustaining on-going involvement. On the basis of findings which have emerged from the study, recommendations have been made as to possible strategies that could be adopted by the organisation to improve volunteer management. The most important of these concerns the implementation of a supervision and support structure for all active volunteers...|$|E

The {{aim is to}} provide comprehensive picture {{of the issue of}} the settlement share both in terms of the commercial law, as well as in terms of the tax and accounting law. With regard to the recent and significant changes in private law, and thus in the area of settlement share, there is devoted ample space in the thesis to comparison of the current and former legal framework including application of the available judicature. The change of the particular law brought a lot of new questions and disputed interpretations, which are subsequently identified and analysed. My thesis consists of introduction, seven chapters and conclusion. Chapters one to four represent a general part in relation to the settlement share. The first chapter gives the definition of a settlement share from both the legal and economical perspective. It includes also consideration about possible treatment with the settlement share.

The starting point for my conclusions is my emphasis on the content of the term share in a private limited company, thus emphasis on shareholder's participation in a company, which is represented by the share, while I infer the legal nature of a vacant share from the fact, that the release of a business share occurs as a result <b>of</b> <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> shareholder's <b>participation</b> in the company without anyone else getting into the position of the former shareholder. Although my conclusions gave rise to doubts whether a vacant share is a thing in legal sense, I finally {{came to the conclusion that}} a vacant share is an intangible movable thing which is not owned by anyone, even though it does not show legal features of a thing in legal sense.

40|$|Forced <b>Termination</b> <b>of</b> Minority Shareholders' <b>Participation</b> in a Joint Stock Company The diploma thesis {{deals with}} legal {{regulation}} of a phenomenon generally known as squeeze-out, introduction of which into the Czech legal order is still by many regarded highly controversial. The respective legal institute {{is subject to}} analysis {{from the standpoint of}} its economic determination. The thesis itself is divided into three chapters: the first chapter provides an economic basis for permitting squeeze-out as a legitimate means of increasing efficiency of a joint-stock company. In brief the reasons can be characterized as extra expenditures originating in the presence of minority shareholders in the company, some of which have the nature of opportunity costs. However, the thesis further shows that the minority shareholders are not economically motivated to transfer their shares on the majority shareholder, mainly due to the free-rider problem. Squeeze-out then represents an efficient means of rationalizing the relations among shareholders within a joint stock company. The second chapter is devoted to constitutional protection of property and its relation to forced cession of minority shareholders' shares in case of squeeze-out. The European Court of Justice as well as the Czech Constitutional Court held in [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: The {{aim of the}} ECG in preparticipation {{screening}} of young athletes is detection of potential disorders in asymptomatic young athletes. Objective: The objective {{of the study was}} to determine the freqency and type of ECG changes observed during preparticipation {{screening of}} young athletes. Method: The research included analysis of ECG tests recorded during the regular preparticipation screening of 219 young athletes, aged from 9 to 19 years, predominantly male, who were engaged in 7 different sport disciplines. Standard ECG was recorded at least 24 hours after strenuous physical activity. ECG analysis was performed according to the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) recommendations for the interpretation of 12 -lead ECG in the athletes, with corrections related to the inversion of T wave. Results: ECG was perfectly normal in 103 (47 %), and ECG changes were noticed in 116 (53 %) of the athletes. In 51. 6 % of examined athletes, ECG changes were of the common type, reflecting adaptation of the heart to regular exercises, and only in 1, 4 % athletes vwere founded ECG changes that are not consistent with training. The most common (32 % of the total examinees) was incomplete right bundle branch block (RBBB). Sinus bradycardia was present in 12, 8 % of the athletes, and early repolarization at 7, 8 %. T wave inversion without clinical significance was observed in 4, 1 % of athlets. Isolated increase in QRS complex voltage was observed in 3, 6 %, while the first degree AV block was present in 0, 5 % of the athletes. ECG changes unrelated to training were recorded in 1, 4 % of athletes. Significant T wave inversion was observed in 0, 9 % and pre-excitation (Wolf-Parkinson-White syndrom) in 0, 5 % of the athletes. Conclusion: Preparticipation screening ECG test revealed ECG changes in 51, 6 % of young athletes. The vast majority of changes are of common, physiological type, that neither requires further investigation, nor <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> active <b>participation</b> in sports.
