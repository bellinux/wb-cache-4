In the last two decades a number of watermarking techniques have been developed [2 – 10]. The requirement(s) that a particular watermarking scheme needs to fulfill depend(s) on the application purpose(s). In this paper, we focus on the authentication of images. In image authentication, there are basically two main objectives: (i) the verification of the image ownership and (ii) the detection of any forgery of the original data. Specifically, in the authentication, we check whether the embedded information (i.e., the invisible watermark) has been altered or not in the receiver side.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Look-up table (LUT) -based {{data hiding}} {{is a simple}} and {{efficient}} technique to hide secondary information (watermark) into multimedia work for various applications such as copyright protection, <b>transaction</b> <b>tracking</b> or content annotation. This paper studies the distortion introduced by a general LUT-based data hiding. We find that designing LUT according to the distribution of host data and watermark data can greatly reduce the distortion of LUT embedding. A new practical reduced-distortion LUT de-sign method is developed for robust data hiding. The new method is applied in a wavelet domain image data hiding system and only significant wavelet coefficients are used to embed the watermark. A Gaussian mixture model and a related expectation-maximiza-tion algorithm-based method are employed to model the statistical distribution of the host image. The statistical model is used to select significant coefficients of the host image for data hiding. The experimental results show that compared to the conventional odd-even LUT embedding method, the presented new LUT data hiding algorithm provides average 1. 5 – 2. 5 dB PSNR improve-ment and better robustness for image watermarking.

40|$|Abstract—Multiple {{watermarking}} is {{used for}} embedding multiple watermarks into the host single multimedia object (image) to provide authentication without bearing on the optical quality of the image. It is an embranchment of digital watermarking, which gives some particular applications, such as <b>transaction</b> <b>tracking.</b> Some digital watermarking techniques ensure the host-signal noise while associating the watermark in chronological sequence on experienced image data. The cover work is projected to multiple orthogonal projection vectors {{to be sure that}} different watermark signals do not mutually interfere in which they are embedded. Many multiple watermarking techniques suffer from host-signal interference when correlating the watermark sequence with received image data. To avoid the interference of one watermark from other watermark, N orthogonal projection vectors are chosen corresponding to N different watermarks having same dimension as the cover image. The cover work is projected to these orthogonal projection vectors to get the different orientations in which the different watermark signals are embedded. Experimental results demonstrate how the spread spectrum method enables the embedding of multiple watermarks into host image and reports its robustness to realistic attacks such as cropping, filtering, lossy compression, scaling, rotation and analog-digital and digital analog conversion.

40|$|Abstract—Flash {{memory has}} {{accelerated}} the architectural evolution of storage systems with its unique characteristics compared to magnetic disks. The no-overwrite property of flash memory naturally supports transactions, a commonly used mechanism in systems to provide consistency. However, existing embedded transaction designs in flash-based Solid State Drives (SSDs) either limit the transaction concurrency or introduce high overhead in <b>tracking</b> <b>transaction</b> states. This leads to low or unstable SSD performance. In this paper, we propose a transactional SSD (TxSSD) architecture, LightTx, to enable better concurrency and low overhead. First, LightTx improves transaction concurrency arbitrarily {{by using a}} page-independent commit protocol. Second, LightTx tracks the recent updates by leveraging the near-log-structured update property of SSDs and periodically retires dead transactions to reduce the <b>transaction</b> state <b>tracking</b> cost. Experiments show that LightTx achieves nearly the lowest overhead in garbage collection, memory consumption and mapping persistence compared to existing embedded transaction designs. LightTx also provides up to 20. 6 percent performance improvement due to improved transaction concurrency.

40|$|Digital {{watermarking}} {{of multimedia}} content {{has been proposed}} as a method for different applications such as copyright protection, content authentication, <b>transaction</b> <b>tracking</b> and data hiding. In this thesis, we propose a lossless watermarking approach based on Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) for a new application of watermarking. A depth map obtained from a stereoscopic image pair is embedded {{into one of the}} two images using a reversible watermarking algorithm. Different from existing approaches which hide depth map in spatial domain, the depth information is hidden in the quantized DCT domain of the stereo image in our method. This modification makes the watermarking algorithm compatible with JPEG and MPEG- 2 compression. After the investigation of the quantized DCT coefficients distribution of the compressed image and video, The bit-shift operation is utilized to embed the depth map into its associated 2 D image reversibly for the purpose of achieving high compression efficiency of the watermarked image and/or video and high visual quality of stereo image and/or video after the depth map is extracted. We implement the proposed method to analyze its performance. The experimental results show that a very high payload of watermark (e. g. depth map) can be embedded into the JPEG compressed image and MPEG- 2 video. The compression efficiency is only slightly reduced after the watermark embedding {{and the quality of the}} original image or video can be restored completely at the decoder side...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{advances}} {{in the field of}} replicated, fault tolerant transactional systems make systematic use of Optimistic Atomic Broadcast (OAB) group communication primitives in order to coordinate the replicas. According to this scheme, the replicas gain information on the existence of transactional requests before a final and global agreement is reached on the transaction serialization order. Hence, speculative processing schemes can be exploited in order to maximize the overlap between local computation and distributed coordination activities. In this article we present ASAP, an innovative Aggressive SpeculAtive Protocol, which exhibits the following two peculiarities: (A) it allows speculating along different transaction serialization orders, thus increasing the likelihood of successful overlap between local processing and coordination in case of mismatches between the optimistic and the final delivery sequence of incoming requests; (B) it speculates along chains of conflicting <b>transactions,</b> <b>tracking</b> data dependencies among transactions via an innovative concurrency control mechanism, which allows determining in a timely fashion the alternative serialization orders to be speculatively explored.

40|$|Debugging {{transactions}} and understanding their execution are of immense importance for developing OLAP applications, to trace causes of errors in production systems, and to audit {{the operations of}} a database. However, debugging transactions is hard for several reasons: 1) after the execution of a transaction, its input is no longer available for debugging, 2) internal states of a transaction are typically not accessible, and 3) the execution of a transaction may be affected by concurrently running transactions.
