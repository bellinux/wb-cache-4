40|$|We {{determine}} the endogenous order of moves {{in which the}} firms set <b>their</b> <b>prices</b> {{in the framework of}} a capacity-constrained Bertrand-Edgeworth triopoly. A three-period timing game that determines the period in which the firms announce <b>their</b> <b>prices</b> precedes the price-setting stage. We show for the non-trivial case (in which the Bertrand-Edgeworth triopoly has only an equilibrium in non-degenerated mixedstrategies) that the firm with the largest capacity sets its price first, while the two other firms set <b>their</b> <b>prices</b> later. Our result extends a finding by Deneckere and Kovenock (1992) from duopolies to triopolies. This extension was made possible by Hirata's (2009) recent advancements on the mixed-strategy equilibria of Bertrand-Edgeworth games. ...|$|R

5|$|Augustus' brother, Otto, {{devised the}} scheme to corner United Copper, {{believing that the}} Heinze family already {{controlled}} {{a majority of the}} company. He also believed that a significant number of the Heinze's shares had been borrowed, and sold short, by speculators betting that the stock price would drop, and that they could thus repurchase the borrowed shares cheaply, pocketing the difference. Otto proposed a short squeeze, whereby the Heinzes would aggressively purchase as many remaining shares as possible, and then force the short sellers to pay for their borrowed shares. The aggressive purchasing would drive up the share price, and, being unable to find shares elsewhere, the short sellers would have no option but to turn to the Heinzes, who could then name <b>their</b> <b>price.</b>|$|E
5|$|Seeing {{that the}} Americans {{were likely to}} build a Nicaragua Canal, {{the owners of the}} defunct French company, {{including}} Philippe Bunau-Varilla, who still had exclusive rights to the Panama route, lowered <b>their</b> <b>price.</b> Beginning in early 1902, President Roosevelt became a backer of the latter route, and Congress passed legislation for it, if it could be secured within a reasonable time. In June, Roosevelt told Hay to take personal charge of the negotiations with Colombia. Later that year, Hay began talks with Colombia's acting minister in Washington, Tomás Herrán. The Hay-Herrán Treaty, granting $10 million to Colombia for the right to build a canal, plus $250,000 annually, was signed on January 22, 1903, and ratified by the United States Senate two months later. In August, however, the treaty was rejected by the Colombian Senate.|$|E

Modern battleships were the crucial element of naval power in spite of <b>their</b> <b>price.</b> Each battleship was a signal of national power and prestige, {{in a manner similar to}} the nuclear weapons of today. Germany, France, Russia, Italy, Japan and Austria all began dreadnought programmes, and second-rank powers including the Ottoman Empire, Argentina, Brazil, and Chile commissioned dreadnoughts to be built in British and American yards.|$|E
5|$|To {{address this}} concern, a {{considerable}} amount of LIFE's effort was put into the development of simplified target designs and automated construction that would lower their cost.

It was expected that this would reduce <b>their</b> <b>price</b> to about 25 cents per target, although other references suggest the target price was closer to 50 cents, and LLNL's own estimates range from 20 to 30 cents.|$|E
5|$|Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino (STT) of Trieste was {{selected}} for the contract to build eight vessels, ahead of one other tenderer. Despite the specifications of the contract being {{very close to the}} requirements for the coastal torpedo boat, the STT boats were classified as sea-going. The STT boats used Parsons turbines driving two propeller shafts. Another tender was requested for four more boats, but when Ganz & Danubius reduced <b>their</b> <b>price</b> by ten percent, a total of sixteen boats were ordered from them. These boats were powered by AEG-Curtiss turbines, and had two funnels rather than the single funnel of the STT boats. The third contract went to Cantiere Navale Triestino (CNT), who used Melms-Pfenniger turbines, and their boats also had two funnels. The boats of all three groups used steam generated by two Yarrow water-tube boilers, one of which burned fuel oil and the other coal.|$|E

30|$|The Vicsek phase {{transition}} {{is visible in}} the average velocity of the particles (traders). But empirically we observe the mutual information peak in the equity prices.

In the ordered phase <b>their</b> <b>prices</b> changes are rigidly locked, but the entropy in <b>their</b> <b>pricing</b> is now very low. Thus the mutual information must peak somewhere in the intermediate state.

5|$|The {{introduction}} of the euro has led to extensive discussion about its possible effect on inflation. In the short term, there was a widespread impression in the population of the eurozone that the {{introduction of}} the euro had led to an increase in prices, but this impression was not confirmed by general indices of inflation and other studies. A study of this paradox found that this was due to an asymmetric effect of the {{introduction of the}} euro on prices: while it had no effect on most goods, it had an effect on cheap goods which have seen <b>their</b> <b>price</b> round up after the {{introduction of the euro}}. The study found that consumers based their beliefs on inflation of those cheap goods which are frequently purchased. It has also been suggested that the jump in small prices may be because prior to the introduction, retailers made fewer upward adjustments and waited for the introduction of the euro to do so.|$|E

40|$|Price-setting {{behaviour}} {{plays an}} important role in the transmission mechanism of monetary policy as pricing decisions of firms in the private sector determine how changes in the official rate affect prices. Several recent studies using micro price data have highlighted the importance of the variation in firm characteristics on pricing decisions. This study investigates whether firms adjust <b>their</b> <b>prices</b> in response to higher interest rates and whether this response differs for firms that have credit. We estimate multinomial logistic regression models using highly disaggregated panel data on monthly product prices of 131 retail outlets in Lesotho over the period 2002 - 2009. In general, our results suggest that firms are more likely to adjust <b>their</b> <b>prices</b> in response to an interest rate shock. Firms will either revise <b>their</b> <b>prices</b> upwards or downwards compared to keeping <b>their</b> <b>prices</b> constant. This ambiguity occurs when a firm's price is a function of price elasticity of demand and costs. A firm has to balance the need to pass on increased cost of the higher interest cost onto prices against the demand-side sensitivity to price increases. On the contrary, when comparing firms with credit to those without, our findings show that firms with credit are more likely to keep <b>their</b> <b>prices</b> constant than to revise them. Furthermore, the study finds asymmetric results in the direction of the price adjustments. Prices are more likely to increase or decrease in the presence of both a demand and a cost shock, whereas prices are more likely to remain constant in the presence of a cost shock only. No evidence was found that credit owing firms pass the higher cost of credit onto <b>their</b> <b>prices,</b> suggesting that firms with credit finance have access to cheaper financing options than firms without credit...|$|R
