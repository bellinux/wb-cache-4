5|$|The Experimental <b>Thermodynamics</b> books series covers many {{topics in}} the fields of <b>thermodynamics.</b>|$|E
5|$|Between 1859 and 1866, he {{developed}} {{the theory of the}} distributions of velocities in particles of a gas, work later generalised by Ludwig Boltzmann. The formula, called the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution, gives the fraction of gas molecules moving at a specified velocity at any given temperature. In the kinetic theory, temperatures and heat involve only molecular movement. This approach generalised the previously established laws of <b>thermodynamics</b> and explained existing observations and experiments in a better way than had been achieved previously. Maxwell's work on <b>thermodynamics</b> led him to devise the thought experiment that {{came to be known as}} Maxwell's demon, where the second law of <b>thermodynamics</b> is violated by an imaginary being capable of sorting particles by energy.|$|E
5|$|The {{field of}} ergodic theory {{is the study}} of the {{long-term}} behavior of chaotic dynamical systems. The protypical case of a field that ergodic theory applies to is <b>thermodynamics,</b> in which—though the microscopic state of a system is extremely complicated (it is impossible to understand the ensemble of individual collisions between particles of matter)—the average behavior over sufficiently long time intervals is tractable. The laws of <b>thermodynamics</b> are assertions about such average behavior. In particular, one formulation of the zeroth law of <b>thermodynamics</b> asserts that over sufficiently long timescales, the only functionally independent measurement that one can make of a thermodynamic system in equilibrium is its total energy, in the form of temperature.|$|E
5|$|<b>Thermodynamics</b> {{requires}} that all spontaneous changes of state {{are accompanied by}} a decrease in Gibbs free energy.|$|E
5|$|After graduation, Lunney {{remained}} with NACA. His first job {{was as a}} researcher in aerospace dynamics at Lewis Research Center, where he worked with a team studying the <b>thermodynamics</b> of vehicles during high-speed reentry. Using a B-57 bomber, the team sent small rockets high into the atmosphere {{in order to measure}} their heating profile.|$|E
5|$|Even more remarkably, {{there is}} a general set of laws known as black hole mechanics, which is {{analogous}} to the laws of <b>thermodynamics.</b> For instance, by the second law of black hole mechanics, the area of the event horizon of a general black hole will never decrease with time, analogous to the entropy of a thermodynamic system. This limits the energy that can be extracted by classical means from a rotating black hole (e.g. by the Penrose process). There is strong evidence that the laws of black hole mechanics are, in fact, a subset of the laws of <b>thermodynamics,</b> and that the black hole area is proportional to its entropy. This leads to a modification of the original laws of black hole mechanics: for instance, as the second law of black hole mechanics becomes part of the second law of <b>thermodynamics,</b> it is possible for black hole area to decrease—as long as other processes ensure that, overall, entropy increases. As thermodynamical objects with non-zero temperature, black holes should emit thermal radiation. Semi-classical calculations indicate that indeed they do, with the surface gravity playing the role of temperature in Planck's law. This radiation is known as Hawking radiation (cf. the quantum theory section, below).|$|E
5|$|In 1871 he {{established}} Maxwell's thermodynamic relations, which are statements of equality among the second derivatives of the thermodynamic potentials {{with respect to}} different thermodynamic variables. In 1874, he constructed a plaster thermodynamic visualisation {{as a way of}} exploring phase transitions, based on the American scientist Josiah Willard Gibbs's graphical <b>thermodynamics</b> papers.|$|E
5|$|Living organisms must {{obey the}} laws of <b>thermodynamics,</b> which {{describe}} the transfer of heat and work. The second law of <b>thermodynamics</b> states that in any closed system, the amount of entropy (disorder) cannot decrease. Although living organisms' amazing complexity appears to contradict this law, life is possible as all organisms are open systems that exchange matter and energy with their surroundings. Thus living systems are not in equilibrium, but instead are dissipative systems that maintain their state of high complexity by causing a larger increase in the entropy of their environments. The metabolism of a cell achieves this by coupling the spontaneous processes of catabolism to the non-spontaneous processes of anabolism. In thermodynamic terms, metabolism maintains order by creating disorder.|$|E
5|$|There are {{multiple}} techniques {{to determine the}} pKa of a chemical, leading to some discrepancies between different sources. Well measured values are typically within 0.1 units of each other. Data presented here were taken at 25°C in water. More values {{can be found in}} <b>thermodynamics,</b> above.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the end of}} the 19th century, weather {{prediction}} was entirely subjective and based on empirical rules, with only limited understanding of the physical mechanisms behind weather processes. In 1901 Cleveland Abbe, founder of the United States Weather Bureau, proposed that the atmosphere is governed by the same principles of <b>thermodynamics</b> and hydrodynamics that were studied in the previous century. In 1904, Vilhelm Bjerknes derived a two-step procedure for model-based weather forecasting. First, a diagnostic step is used to process data to generate initial conditions, which are then advanced in time by a prognostic step that solves the initial value problem. He also identified seven variables that defined the state of the atmosphere at a given point: pressure, temperature, density, humidity, and the three components of the flow velocity vector. Bjerknes pointed out that equations based on mass continuity, conservation of momentum, the first and second laws of <b>thermodynamics,</b> and the ideal gas law could be used to estimate the state of the atmosphere in the future through numerical methods. With the exception of the second law of <b>thermodynamics,</b> these equations form the basis of the primitive equations used in present-day weather models.|$|E
5|$|All {{projections}} {{of the future of}} the Earth, the Solar System, and the Universe must account for the second law of <b>thermodynamics,</b> which states that entropy, or a loss of the energy available to do work, must increase over time. Stars will eventually exhaust their supply of hydrogen fuel and burn out. Close encounters gravitationally fling planets from their star systems, and star systems from galaxies.|$|E
5|$|Born in Walkerton, Indiana, Urey studied <b>thermodynamics</b> under Gilbert N. Lewis at the University of California. After he {{received}} his PhD in 1923, he was awarded a fellowship by the American-Scandinavian Foundation to study at the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen. He was a research associate at Johns Hopkins University before becoming {{an associate professor of}} Chemistry at Columbia University. In 1931, he began work with the separation of isotopes that resulted in the discovery of deuterium.|$|E
5|$|Founded in 1796, the Rumford Prize, {{awarded by}} the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, {{is one of}} the oldest {{scientific}} prizes in the United States. The prize recognizes contributions by scientists to the fields of heat and light. These terms are widely interpreted; awards range from discoveries in <b>thermodynamics</b> to improvements in the construction of steam boilers.|$|E
5|$|In 1922, Alfred J. Lotka {{proposed}} that natural selection might {{be understood as}} a physical principle that could be described in terms of the use of energy by a system, a concept later developed by Howard T. Odum as the maximum power principle in <b>thermodynamics,</b> whereby evolutionary systems with selective advantage maximise the rate of useful energy transformation.|$|E
5|$|In 1930, Kistiakowsky {{joined the}} faculty of Harvard University, an {{affiliation}} that continued throughout his career. At Harvard, his research interests were in <b>thermodynamics,</b> spectroscopy, and chemical kinetics. He became increasingly involved in consulting {{for the government and}} industry. He became an associate professor again, this time at Harvard in 1933. That year he also became an American citizen. In 1938, he became the Abbott and James Lawrence Professor of Chemistry.|$|E
5|$|Lord Kelvin used <b>thermodynamics</b> to {{estimate}} the age of Earth to be between 20 million and 400 million years in 1864, sparking a vigorous debate on the subject; {{it was only when}} radioactivity and radioactive dating were discovered in the late 19th and early 20th centuries that a reliable mechanism for determining Earth's age was established, proving the planet to be billions of years old. The perception of Earth shifted again in the 20th century when humans first viewed it from orbit, and especially with photographs of Earth returned by the Apollo program.|$|E
5|$|Sand went on {{to receive}} his Master of Arts (M.A.) in physics from Rice University. At Rice, Sands took {{graduate}} courses in relativity, statistical mechanics, and <b>thermodynamics</b> from Harold A. Wilson, {{who was the first}} chair of the Rice physics department. He also completed experimental studies of ferromagnetism. At Rice, Sands met his first wife, Elizabeth, an undergraduate student there.|$|E
5|$|Szilard {{initially}} attended Palatine Joseph Technical University in Budapest, but his {{engineering studies}} were interrupted by {{service in the}} Austro-Hungarian Army during World War I. He left Hungary for Germany in 1919, enrolling at Technische Hochschule (Institute of Technology) in Berlin-Charlottenburg, but became bored with engineering and transferred to Friedrich Wilhelm University, where he studied physics. He wrote his doctoral thesis on Maxwell's demon, a long-standing puzzle {{in the philosophy of}} thermal and statistical physics. Szilard was the first to recognize the connection between <b>thermodynamics</b> and Information theory.|$|E
5|$|The {{connection}} between macroscopic nonconservative forces and microscopic conservative forces {{is described by}} detailed treatment with statistical mechanics. In macroscopic closed systems, nonconservative forces act to change the internal energies of the system, and are often associated with the transfer of heat. According to the Second law of <b>thermodynamics,</b> nonconservative forces necessarily result in energy transformations within closed systems from ordered to more random conditions as entropy increases.|$|E
5|$|Dirks' work in {{computational}} chemistry involved creating algorithms and computational {{tools for}} the analysis of nucleic acid <b>thermodynamics</b> and nucleic acid structure prediction. Dirks wrote the initial code for the NUPACK suite of nucleic acid design and analysis tools, which generates base pairing probabilities through calculation of the statistical partition function. Unlike other structure prediction tools, NUPACK is capable of handling an arbitrary number of interacting strands rather than being limited to one or two. Dirks also developed an algorithm capable of efficiently handling certain types of pseudoknots, a class of structure that is more computationally intensive to analyze, although NUPACK only implements this ability for single RNA strands.|$|E
5|$|Einstein {{became a}} full {{professor}} at the German Charles-Ferdinand University in Prague in April 1911, accepting Austrian citizenship in the Austro-Hungarian Empire to do so. During his Prague stay, he wrote 11 scientific works, five of them on radiation mathematics and on the quantum theory of solids. In July 1912, {{he returned to his}} alma mater in Zürich. From 1912 until 1914, he was professor of theoretical physics at the ETH Zurich, where he taught analytical mechanics and <b>thermodynamics.</b> He also studied continuum mechanics, the molecular theory of heat, and the problem of gravitation, on which he worked with mathematician and friend Marcel Grossmann.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, mendelevium(I) was {{reported}} to have been produced by Russian scientists, who obtained it by reducing higher oxidation states of mendelevium with samarium(II). It was found to be stable in neutral water–ethanol solution and be homologous to caesium(I). However, later experiments found no evidence for mendelevium(I) and found that mendelevium behaved like divalent elements when reduced, not like the monovalent alkali metals. Nevertheless, the Russian team conducted further studies on the <b>thermodynamics</b> of cocrystallizing mendelevium with alkali metal chlorides, and concluded that mendelevium(I) had formed and could form mixed crystals with divalent elements, thus cocrystallizing with them. The status of the +1 oxidation state is still tentative.|$|E
5|$|Oppenheimer {{majored in}} chemistry, but Harvard {{required}} science students to also study history, literature, and philosophy or mathematics. He compensated for his late start by taking six courses each term and {{was admitted to}} the undergraduate honor society Phi Beta Kappa. In his first year, he was admitted to graduate standing in physics on the basis of independent study, which meant he was not required to take the basic classes and could enroll instead in advanced ones. He was attracted to experimental physics by a course on <b>thermodynamics</b> that was taught by Percy Bridgman. He graduated summa cum laude in three years.|$|E
5|$|Other notable Irish {{physicists}} include Ernest Walton, {{winner of}} the 1951 Nobel Prize in Physics. With Sir John Douglas Cockcroft, {{he was the first}} to split the nucleus of the atom by artificial means and made contributions to the development of a new theory of wave equation. William Thomson, or Lord Kelvin, is the person whom the absolute temperature unit, the kelvin, is named after. Sir Joseph Larmor, a physicist and mathematician, made innovations in the understanding of electricity, dynamics, <b>thermodynamics</b> and the electron theory of matter. His most influential work was Aether and Matter, a book on theoretical physics published in 1900.|$|E
25|$|The initial {{application}} of <b>thermodynamics</b> to mechanical heat engines was extended {{early on to}} the study of chemical compounds and chemical reactions. Chemical <b>thermodynamics</b> studies the nature of the role of entropy in the process of chemical reactions and has provided the bulk of expansion and knowledge of the field. Other formulations of <b>thermodynamics</b> emerged in the following decades. Statistical <b>thermodynamics,</b> or statistical mechanics, concerned itself with statistical predictions of the collective motion of particles from their microscopic behavior. In 1909, Constantin Carathéodory presented a purely mathematical approach to the field in his axiomatic formulation of <b>thermodynamics,</b> a description often referred to as geometrical <b>thermodynamics.</b>|$|E

25|$|Chemical <b>thermodynamics</b> is {{the study}} of the {{interrelation}} of energy with chemical reactions or with a physical change of state {{within the confines of the}} laws of <b>thermodynamics.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{primary goal}} of {{statistical}} <b>thermodynamics</b> (also known as equilibrium statistical mechanics) is to derive the classical <b>thermodynamics</b> of materials {{in terms of the}} properties of their constituent particles and the interactions between them. In other words, statistical <b>thermodynamics</b> provides a connection between the macroscopic properties of materials in thermodynamic equilibrium, and the microscopic behaviours and motions occurring inside the material.|$|E
25|$|For the <b>thermodynamics</b> {{of closed}} systems, the {{distinction}} between transfers of energy as work and as heat is central and is {{within the scope of}} the present article. For the <b>thermodynamics</b> of open systems, such a distinction {{is beyond the scope of}} the present article, but some limited comments are made on it in the section below headed 'First law of <b>thermodynamics</b> for open systems'.|$|E
25|$|<b>Thermodynamics</b> is an {{applied science}} used in several {{branches}} of engineering, including mechanical and chemical engineering. At its simplest, <b>thermodynamics</b> {{is the study}} of energy, its use and transformation through a system. Typically, engineering <b>thermodynamics</b> is concerned with changing energy from one form to another. As an example, automotive engines convert chemical energy (enthalpy) from the fuel into heat, and then into mechanical work that eventually turns the wheels.|$|E
25|$|This {{article is}} focused mainly on {{classical}} <b>thermodynamics</b> which primarily studies systems in thermodynamic equilibrium. Non-equilibrium <b>thermodynamics</b> is often {{treated as an}} extension of the classical treatment, but statistical mechanics has brought many advances to that field.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} <b>thermodynamics</b> is a {{fundamental}} strand {{in the history of}} physics, the history of chemistry, and the history of science in general. Owing to the relevance of <b>thermodynamics</b> in much of science and technology, its history is finely woven with the developments of classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, magnetism, and chemical kinetics, to more distant applied fields such as meteorology, information theory, and biology (physiology), and to technological developments such as the steam engine, internal combustion engine, cryogenics and electricity generation. The development of <b>thermodynamics</b> both drove and was driven by atomic theory. It also, albeit in a subtle manner, motivated new directions in probability and statistics; see, for example, the timeline of <b>thermodynamics.</b>|$|E
25|$|Statistical {{mechanics}} {{is commonly}} used to explain the thermodynamic behaviour of large systems. This branch of statistical mechanics, which treats and extends classical <b>thermodynamics,</b> is known as statistical <b>thermodynamics</b> or equilibrium statistical mechanics. Microscopic mechanical laws do not contain concepts such as temperature, heat, or entropy; however, statistical mechanics shows how these concepts arise from the natural uncertainty {{about the state of}} a system when that system is prepared in practice. The benefit of using statistical mechanics is that it provides exact methods to connect thermodynamic quantities (such as heat capacity) to microscopic behaviour, whereas, in classical <b>thermodynamics,</b> the only available option would be to just measure and tabulate such quantities for various materials. Statistical mechanics also makes it possible to extend the laws of <b>thermodynamics</b> to cases which are not considered in classical <b>thermodynamics,</b> such as microscopic systems and other mechanical systems with few degrees of freedom.|$|E

25|$|There {{are three}} {{equilibrium}} ensembles {{with a simple}} form that can be defined for any isolated system bounded inside a finite volume. These are the most often discussed ensembles in statistical <b>thermodynamics.</b> In the macroscopic limit (defined below) they all correspond to classical <b>thermodynamics.</b>|$|E
25|$|Non-equilibrium <b>{{thermodynamic}}s</b> is {{a branch}} of <b>thermodynamics</b> that deals with systems {{that are not in}} thermodynamic equilibrium. Most systems found in nature are not in thermodynamic equilibrium because they are not in stationary states, and are continuously and discontinuously subject to flux of matter and energy to and from other systems. The thermodynamic study of non-equilibrium systems requires more general concepts than are dealt with by equilibrium <b>thermodynamics.</b> Many natural systems still today remain beyond the scope of currently known macroscopic thermodynamic methods.|$|E
