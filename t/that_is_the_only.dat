5|$|I {{should say}} I {{wanted to write}} poetry in the {{beginning}} because I {{had fallen in love}} with words. The first poems I knew were nursery rhymes and before I could read them for myself I had come to love the words of them. The words alone. What the words stood for was of a very secondary importance... I fell in love, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> expression I can think of, at once, and am still at the mercy of words, though sometimes now, knowing a little of their behaviour very well, I think I can influence them slightly and have even learned to beat them now and then, which they appear to enjoy. I tumbled for words at once. And, when I began to read the nursery rhymes for myself, and, later, to read other verses and ballads, I knew that I had discovered the most important things, to me, that could be ever.|$|E

5|$|The bristle-faced free-tailed bat (Mormopterus eleryi), {{previously}} {{known as}} the hairy-rostrum or hairy-nosed freetail bat, is a small insectivorous bat <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> member of the molossid sub-genus Setirostris. The bristle-faced free-tailed bat differs from all other bats in the Family Molossidae by possessing unique dentition, a distinctive echolocation call, diagnostic genital and glans penis morphology and small body size.

5|$|There is {{considerable}} {{uncertainty about the}} identities of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania between Traidenis' death in 1282 and Vytenis' assumption of power in 1295. This is in part because the two main sources for Lithuanian history in the 13th century, the Hypatian Codex and the Livonian Rhymed Chronicle, end in the early 1290s. In 1285, one chronicle mentions Daumantas as Grand Duke. He attacked the Bishop of Tver and was severely wounded or even killed in the battle.

25|$|Burbank Bob Hope Airport covers 614 acres (248 ha) at an {{elevation}} of 778 feet (237 m) above sea level.

Airliners generally take off on Runway 15 due to wind from the south, and land crosswind on Runway 8 since <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> runway with ILS and clear terrain for the approach. Flights from the northeast sometimes land visually on Runway 15 to save the extra distance circling to Runway 8. When wind is from the north airliners often make a visual left-base approach to Runway 33, with a left turn close to the airport.|$|E

25|$|On March 28, 2011, a {{supermassive black}} hole was seen tearing a {{mid-size}} star apart. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> likely {{explanation of the}} observations that day of sudden X-ray radiation and the follow-up broad-band observations. The source was previously an inactive galactic nucleus, and from study of the outburst the galactic nucleus {{is estimated to be}} a SMBH with mass of the order of a million solar masses. This rare event is assumed to be a relativistic outflow (material being emitted in a jet at a significant fraction of the speed of light) from a star tidally disrupted by the SMBH. A significant fraction of a solar mass of material is expected to have accreted onto the SMBH. Subsequent long-term observation will allow this assumption to be confirmed if the emission from the jet decays at the expected rate for mass accretion onto a SMBH.|$|E
