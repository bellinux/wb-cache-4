500|$|This was actor Cheyenne Jackson's second {{appearance}} as Danny on 30 Rock. He made his {{debut in the}} November 12, 2009, episode [...] "The Problem Solvers". Fey had seen Jackson in the Broadway musicals Xanadu and Damn Yankees, the latter that starred Jane Krakowski, who plays Jenna Maroney on the show. According to Jackson in a November 2009 interview, Fey {{set up a meeting}} to interest him in a role on the program. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, it was revealed that it was Krakowski who brought Jackson {{to the attention of the}} 30 Rock producers. In the episode, Danny sang off-key during a duet with Jenna, in order to keep her happy. In regards of his off-pitch performance, Jackson said in an interview, [...] "It's actually harder <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>think.</b> I worked on it a lot to make it sound real and to make it sound believable. But I got some good, funny feedback from it, so I'm glad it worked out." ...|$|E

Our choice is more limited <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>think.</b> At least fifty names were proposed, {{all of them}} of young men of the highest character. Each one, however, had some possibly doubtful relative or association or custom in life. It is evident that there is treachery somewhere in the very highest quarters. These young men were sure to be brought into contact with it. Now it was Ray's idea to seek for some one wholly outside the diplomatic world, living in a spot remote from London, with as few friends as possible, who would have no sentimental objections to the surveillance of detectives. You appear to us to be suitable." ...|$|E

40|$|Large {{sections}} of the media habitually distort, misrepresent and exaggerate the facts on crime, argues this paper. Between 2000 and 2009, the Australian national murder rate fell by 39 per cent, the national robbery rate fell by 43 per cent, the national burglary rate fell by 55 per cent, the national motor vehicle theft rate fell by 62 per cent and all forms of other theft fell by 39 per cent. Australia is now into its 11 th straight year of falling or stable crime rates. Property crime rates in some States are lower than they’ve been in more <b>than</b> 20 years. <b>You</b> <b>might</b> <b>think</b> this a cause for celebration {{but the vast majority}} of Australians still think crime is going up. The reason for this is fairly clear. Most people get their information about crime from the media—and large {{sections of}} the media habitually distort, misrepresent and exaggerate the facts on crime. The abuse of crime statistics is so common it has in some quarters engendered great skepticism about them. The saying there are ‘lies, damned lies and statistics’ is probably nowhere more frequently uttered than in the context of crime statistics. Yet whether we like them or not, crime statistics are here to stay. We have to make judgments about the prevalence of crime, about trends in crime, about the distribution of crime and about the impact of Government efforts to prevent and control crime. We cannot base these judgments on personal experience and anecdote. They have to be based on statistical information. The challenge facing those who produce and use crime statistics is how to do so in a way which is not misleading and which helps rather than hinders our understanding of crime. This bulletin is designed to help those unfamiliar with crime statistics to understand their uses and abuses...|$|R

Dame Harflete, you are richer than you have been advised to say, and I repeat you ask much of me. Justice is your due from your Sovereign, and you shall have it; but these wide Abbey lands, this Priory of Blossholme, whose nuns have befriended you and whom you desire to save, this embracing pardon for others who had shed blood, this cancelling outside of the form of law of a sentence passed by a Court duly constituted, if unjust, all in return for a loan of a pitiful £1000? You huckster well, Lady Harflete, one would think that your father had been a chapman, not rough John Foterell, you who can drive so shrewd a bargain with your King's necessities." ...|$|E

"Raymond Chandler, whose essay 'The Simple Art of Murder' {{did much}} toward {{demolishing}} the classical detective story, {{had this to}} say in a letter to Hamish Hamilton, the British publisher: 'This man Austin Freeman is a wonderful performer.

50|$|The Ravenel conjectures very roughly say: complex cobordism (and its variants) {{see more}} in the stable {{homotopy}} category <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>think.</b> For example, the nilpotence conjecture states that some suspension of some iteration of a map between finite CW-complexes is null-homotopic iff it is zero in complex cobordism. This was proven by Devinatz, Hopkins and Jeff Smith (published in 1988). The rest of the Ravenel conjectures (except for the telescope conjecture) were proven by Hopkins and Smith soon after (published in 1998). Another result in this spirit proven by Hopkins and Ravenel is the chromatic convergence theorem, which states that one can recover a finite CW-complex from its localizations with respect to wedges of Morava K-theories.|$|E

[...] The SMS-message was followed by an email directing the user to an online video [...] "news report" [...] about a recent spree of killings. Using on-the-fly video manipulation, the user's name and a personalized message were worked into the report - the former written in blood on a wall near the crime scene, the latter added to a note in an evidence bag carried past the camera. While the marketing campaign succeeded in raising {{the profile of the}} show, it proved unpopular with many mobile owners, who saw this as spam advertising aimed at mobile phones.

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 58, based on seven reviews. K. Ross Hoffman of AllMusic viewed the album as [...] "an even glossier, more unabashedly poptastic affair than their first album", {{adding that it}} [...] "takes its cues from turn of the '90s club music: Hi-NRG, Euro-beat, hip-house, and the Scandinavian synth-reggae of Ace of Base." [...] Hugh Montgomery wrote for The Observer that the album finds the group [...] "appropriating the handbag house sound that was the cornerstone of provincial clubs circa 1995. Thus jittery piano riffs and hands-in-the-air breakdowns abound, while singer Stine hollers dancefloor doggerel." [...] Simon Gage of the Daily Express described the songs as [...] "chirpy and silly with witty lyrics", while calling the music itself [...] "Euro-nonsense at its finest". Stephen Kelly of NME commented that Alphabeat [...] "have bravely stripped away all the bubblegum that originally made them popular in favour of the Euro-dance years of the late-'80s/early-'90s.

5000|$|While Mirror Image {{has earned}} {{considerable}} respect {{within the industry}} for its exceptional productivity and talent, the company also has gained attention and accolades for its constant nonprofit work and community involvement. Roth {{has a reputation for}} achieving his business goals while staying true to his values: He runs a union shop, offers competitive wages and has fully paid for employees health insurance, hires {{people from all walks of}} life and countries of origin, and takes up myriad social and political causes on the side.“We do a lot of human rights-related work because I’m interested in it,” including work for Amnesty International, Farm Aid and Oxfam, says Roth, who serves on the board of directors of Students for a Free Tibet.Roth also steers clients toward using U.S.-made products, or at least garments from overseas manufacturers that he considers more ethical than average. “I just try to have as much influence as possible,” he says. “I wouldn’t print on a shirt that came from Burma, for instance. That’s a horrible place.”Although almost all of Mirror Image’s nonprofit work is done for free, at cost or with some type of discount, it still serves a legitimate business purpose: The projects allow the staff to be highly creative compared to some of the company’s better-paying gigs. However, Roth’s real motivation has nothing to do with business.“Less often <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>think</b> does anybody send us real jobs just because they saw that we helped somebody else out,” he says. “But you’re just supposed to do good things in this world.” ...|$|E
