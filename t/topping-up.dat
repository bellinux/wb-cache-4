5|$|Andrée {{resisted}} Ekholm's criticisms to {{the point}} of deception. On the boat back from Svalbard, Ekholm learned from the chief engineer of the hydrogen plant the explanation of some anomalies he had noticed in his measurements: Andrée had from time to time secretly ordered extra <b>topping-up</b> of the hydrogen in the balloon. Andrée's motives for such self-destructive behavior are not known. Several modern writers, following Sundman's Andrée portrait in the semi-documentary novel, The Flight of the Eagle (1967), have speculated that Andrée had by this time become the prisoner of his own successful funding campaign. The sponsors and the media followed every delay and reported on every setback, and were clamoring for results. Andrée, Strindberg, and Ekholm had been seen off by cheering crowds in Stockholm and Gothenburg (see image from Aftonbladet, right), and now all the expectations were coming to nothing with the long wait for southerly winds at Danes Island. Especially pointed was the contrast between Nansen's simultaneous return, covered in polar glory from his daring yet well-planned expedition on the ship Fram, and Andrée's failure even to launch his own much-hyped conveyance. Sundman theorizes that Andrée could not face letting the press report {{that he did not know}} the prevailing wind direction, and had also miscalculated in ordering the balloon, and needed a new one to rectify his error.|$|E

50|$|Most superconducting magnets {{have their}} coils of superconductive wire {{immersed}} in liquid helium, inside a vessel called a cryostat. Despite thermal insulation, sometimes including a second cryostat containing liquid nitrogen, ambient heat causes the helium to slowly boil off. Such magnets, therefore, require regular <b>topping-up</b> with liquid helium. Generally a cryocooler, {{also known as}} a coldhead, is used to recondense some helium vapor back into the liquid helium bath. Several manufacturers now offer 'cryogenless' scanners, where instead of being immersed in liquid helium the magnet wire is cooled directly by a cryocooler.|$|E

50|$|Like {{other members}} of the Universal Rocket family, the Proton-K was fuelled by Unsymmetrical {{dimethylhydrazine}} and nitrogen tetroxide. These were hypergolic fuels which burn on contact, avoiding the need for an ignition system, and can be stored at ambient temperatures. This avoids the need for low-temperature-tolerant components, and allowed the rocket to sit on the pad fully fuelled for long periods of time. In contrast, cryogenic fuels would have required periodic <b>topping-up</b> of propellants as they boil off. The fuels used on the Proton, were, however, corrosive and toxic and required special handling. The Russian Government paid for the cleanup of residual propellent in spent stages that impact downrange.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} <b>topping-up</b> scheme in health {{insurance}} when {{both public and}} private insurers use a linear contract. First, the case with identical consumers is analyzed. It is shown that the optimal policies allow to implement the second-best allocation.

40|$|Several {{contributions}} in the optimal taxation literature have emphasized that, when individuals. preferences are not separable between leisure and other goods, it is desirable to supplement a nonlinear income tax with public provision of private goods. Moreover, {{it has also been}} shown that the choice between a <b>topping-up</b> and an opting-out scheme depends on whether the publicly provided good is a complement or substitute with leisure, with opting-out (<b>topping-up)</b> being the preferred scheme for goods which are substitutes (complements) for labor. In this paper, using the self-selection approach to tax analysis, we revisit these results in the presence of tax avoidance, and investigate how public provision interacts withthe agents. incentives to engage in tax avoidance. Three results are obtained. First, we show that tax dodging opportunities imply that non-separability between labor and other goods is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition to make public provision of private goods a welfare-enhancing policy instrument. Second, we show how tax dodging opportunities limit the scope for using <b>topping-up</b> provision schemes as a redistributive device. Finally, we show that, for most of the public provision schemes previously analyzed in the literature, being a welfare-enhancing policy instrument {{goes hand in hand with}} weakening the agents. incentives to shelter income from the tax authority. However, we also point out an important exceptionto this pattern...|$|E

Then, consumers ’ het-erogeneity is introduced: consumers differ in their wage rate and labour supply is endogenous.

40|$|We examine quantitatively why uniform {{vouchers}} {{have repeatedly}} su¤ered electoral defeats {{against the current}} system where {{public and private schools}} coexist. We argue that the <b>topping-up</b> option available under uniform vouchers is not sufficiently valuable for the poorer households to prefer the uniform vouchers to the current mix of public and private education. We then develop a model of publicly funded means-tested edu- cation vouchers where the voucher received by each household is a linearly decreasing function of income. Public policy, which is determined by majority voting, consists of two dimensions: the overall funding level (or the tax rate) and the slope of the means testing function. We solve the model when the political decisions are sequential ?households vote ?rst on the tax rate and then on the extent of means testing. We establish that a majority voting equilibrium exists. We show that the means-tested voucher regime is majority preferred to the status-quo. These results are robust to alternative preference parameters, income distribution parameters and voter turnout. ...|$|E
40|$|More {{than ten}} {{years have passed since}} the European Commission adopted Directive 94 / 19 /EC on deposit-guarantee schemes. The Directive laid the {{foundations}} for general harmonisation of deposit insurance across the European Union Member States, requiring them to legally set up deposit-guarantee schemes by a specified deadline. Based on minimum harmonisation, the Directive left it to Member States to develop their own deposit insurance systems in terms of e. g. definition of eligible deposits, level of cover, types of funding mechanism, and calculation of members’ contributions. This autonomy has resulted in quite divergent evolution of deposit-guarantee schemes and gives rise to a series of possible problems, which were the subject of the European Commission’s review of the Directive in 2006. This paper overviews the current state of deposit insurance across the European Union, highlights the main controversial issues which cause disparities in the implementation of deposit insurance between Member States (e. g. the definition of eligible deposits, the level of cover applied, the implementation of <b>topping-up</b> arrangements, the types of funding mechanism), and discusses {{the pros and cons of}} further harmonisation.

40|$|Deposition of the Arab Formation on the Arabian Plate {{followed}} a eustatic sea-level high during the Oxfordian that deposited the open-marine shelfal carbonates of the Hanifa and Jubaila Formations. Oolite/peloidal shoals and local coral-algal stromatoporoid banks were subsequently deposited {{on the platform}} margin. These acted as barriers {{and led to the}} differentiation of intrashelf basins from open-marine (Tethyan) waters to the east. During the subsequent Kimmeridgian lowstand, gypsum wedges were laid down in the intrashelf basins. Slight changes in water depth, which exposed or flooded these barriers, are believed to be responsible for the cyclic nature of the Arab Formation sediments. Arab Formation cycles show a 4 ?h order frequency but have thicknesses more typical of 3 rd order Vail-type sequences. This is probably explained by the 4 th order flooding events merely <b>topping-up</b> pre-existing accommodation space of tens of metres water depth in the intrashelf basin. Diagenesis associated with movement of hypersaline brines may have been responsible for the development of widespread dissolution porosity and dolomitization.

40|$|During the 1987 FIRE marine {{stratocumulus}} experiment the U. K. Meteorological Office {{operated a}} set of turbulence probes attached to the tether cable of a balloon based on San Nicolas Island. Typically six probes were used; each probe is fitted with Gill propeller anemometers, a platinum resistance thermometer and wet and dry thermistors, to permit measurements of the fluxes of momentum, heat, and humidity. The orientation of each probe is determined {{from a pair of}} inclinometers and a three-axis magnetometer. Sufficient information is available to allow the measured wind velocities to be corrected for the motion of the balloon. On the 14 to 15 July measurements were made over the period 1530 to 1200 UTC and again, after a short break for battery recharging and <b>topping-up</b> the balloon, between 0400 to 0900 UTC. Data were therefore recorded from morning to early evening, and again for a period overnight. Six probes were available for the daytime measurements, five for the night. Data were recorded at 4 Hz for individual periods of a little over an hour. The intention was to keep a minimum of one probe at or just above cloud top; small changes in balloon height were necessary to accommodate changes in inversion height. The ability of the balloon system to make simultaneous measurements at several levels allows the vertical structure of the boundary layer to be displayed without resort to composites. Turbulent statistics were calculated from 2 hour periods, one straddling local noon and one at night. These were subdivided into half-hour averaging intervals for the evaluation of variances and fluxes...|$|E
40|$|In a desertified source area of {{drifting}} sand encroaching on {{parts of the}} Gezira Irrigation Scheme in Central Sudan, sand settlement by trees was envisaged. Establishment, survival and growth of Acacia tortilis, Leptadenia pyrotechnica, Prosopis juliflora, Salvadora persica and Panicum turgidum were investigated. Comparisons were made of the sums of final survivors in the replicates for each treatment {{as well as by}} an ANOVA analysis on the survival trends over time within the measuring periods. In a first experiment Acacia had better final survival but statistically comparable survival means with Prosopis over the year. This was due to higher deaths at later growth stages in Prosopis. Unprotected soil had some rain water run-on, while protection was not very effective, but irrigation generally was, particularly at later stages of growth. Establishing trees without irrigation appeared virtually impossible in a second experiment. Continuous drip irrigation under protection was very effective, but run-on water again influenced the protection issue. Leptadenia suffered from root hairs blocking water tubes. The higher survival rates of Acacia may be attributed to a capability of this species to grow on blown out eroded sites, on alkali soil. Differences in variation of soil conditions with depth on a small scale could explain growth contrasts in Acacia and Prosopis. An ANOVA on physical and chemical properties did not show such differences for Leptadenia, where soil properties causing a saturated zone possibly caused growth difference in a third experiment. Therefore irrigated unprotected Leptadenia with only weekly water <b>topping-up</b> did now better than protected trees. Leptadenia did much better in final surviving than Acacia, summed up for all conditions, and this was confirmed in the ANOVA results for throughout the year.

40|$|Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPSs) provide {{short-term}} power {{back-up to}} sensitive electronic and electrical equipments, where an unexpected power loss {{could lead to}} undesirable outcomes. They usually bridge the connected equipment between the utility mains power and other long term back-up power systems like generators. A UPS also provides a “clean” source of power, meaning they filter the connected equipment from distortions in electrical parameters of the mains power like noise, harmonics, surges, sags and spikes. A surge resistant UPS or SRUPS {{is one that has}} the capability to withstand surges, which are momentary or sustained increases in the mains voltage, and react quickly enough to offer protection to the connected equipment from the same. Usually UPSs run off battery power when the utility mains power is absent. But the SRUPS developed in this design project uses super capacitors instead of battery packs. The {{reason for this is that}} the high energy-densities and medium power-densities offered by super capacitors allow for it to serve two purposes. One is to provide the DC power to operate the UPS in the absence of mains power, as an alternative to batteries. Secondly, super capacitors can withstand heavy momentary high current/voltage surges due to its high energy-density characteristics. Also as the life-time of super capacitors is much higher than that of conventional batteries and as they do not need regular <b>topping-up</b> or inspection, the end result is a truly maintenance-free UPS. Most commercial UPSs do not have inherent surge protection capabilities. The UPS is one entity while a discrete surge protection module is inserted between the utility mains and the UPS to provide for transient surge suppression. In the proposed SRUPS, the super capacitor, because of their inherent capability to absorb transient surges, forms a protective front end to the actual UPS rather than needing to have the involvement of discrete protection devices...|$|E
