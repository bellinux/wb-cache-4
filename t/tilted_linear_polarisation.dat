40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to perform {{observational}} tests of SiO maser polarisation and excitation models, using component-level comparisons of multiple SiO maser transitions in the 43 GHz and 86 GHz bands at milliarcsecond resolution. These observations require very long baseline interferometric imaging with very accurate plarimetric calibration. The supergiant star VY CMa {{was chosen as the}} object of this study due to its high SiO maser luminosity, many detected SiO maser lines, and intrinsic scientific interest. Two epochs of full-polarisation VLBA observations of VY CMa were performed. The Epoch 2 observations were reduced using several new data reducation methods developed as part of this work, and designed specifically to improve the accuracy of circular polarisation calibration of spectral-line VLBI observations at millimetre wavelengths. The accuracy is estimated to be better than 1 % using these methods. The Epoch 2 images show a concentration of v= 1 and v= 2 J= 1 - 0 SiO masers to the east and northeast of the assumed stellar position. The v= 1 J= 2 - 1 masers were more evenly distributed around the star, with a notable lack of emission in the northeast. There is appreciable spatial overlap between these three lines. The nature ofthe overlap is generally consistent with the predictions of hydrodynamical circumstellar SiO maser simulations. Where the v= 1 J= 1 - 0 and J= 2 - 1 features overlap, the v= 1 J= 2 - 1 emission is usually considerably weaker. This is not predicted by current hydrodynamical models, but can be explained in the context of collisional pumping in a low density environment. six observational tests of weak-splitting maser polarisation models were performed, including inter-comparisons of <b>linear</b> <b>polarisation</b> in the v= 1 J= 1 - 0 and J= 2 - 1 lines, <b>linear</b> <b>polarisation</b> versus saturation level, <b>linear</b> <b>polarisation</b> versus distance from the star, circular polarisation in the v= 1 J= 1 - 0 and J= 2 - 1 lines, circular versus <b>linear</b> <b>polarisation</b> and modeling of ~ 90 ° electric-vector position angle rotations. The polarisation model tests generally do not support non-Zeeman circular polarisation mechanisms. For the <b>linear</b> <b>polarisation</b> tests, the results are more consistent with models that predict similar <b>linear</b> <b>polarisation</b> across transitions.

Aims. We sought to test whether the quiet Sun flux detected by Hinode is due to a local or the global dynamo by studying long-term variations in the polarisation signals detectable at the disc centre of the quiet Sun between November 2006 and May 2012, with particular emphasis on weak signals in the internetwork. Methods. The investigation focusses on line-integrated circular <b>polarisation</b> Vtot and <b>linear</b> <b>polarisation</b> LPtot profiles obtained from the Fe I 6302. 5 Å absorption line in Hinode SOT/SP. Results. Both circular and <b>linear</b> <b>polarisation</b> signals show no overall variation in the fraction of selected pixels from 2006 until 2012. There is also no variation in the magnetic flux in this interval of time. The probability density functions (PDF) of the line-of-sight magnetic flux can be fitted with a power law from 1. 17 × 1017 Mx to 8. 53 × 1018 Mx with index α = − 1. 82 ± 0. 02 in 2007.

The low temperature photoluminescence spectra from both sets of samples are very broad with full width at half-maximum height increasing from 81 to 330 meV as the In fraction increases. Comparative photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy indicates that the recombination mainly involves strongly localised carriers. At a temperature of 10 K the degree of <b>linear</b> <b>polarisation</b> of the a-plane samples is much smaller than of the m-plane counterparts and also varies across the spectrum.

A total of 81 maser components were extracted from the total intensity map, each approximately 1 mas in size. The emission spans approximately 100 x 80 mas in right ascension and declination and is concentrated to the east. The maser component positions were fitted to a ring of radius ~ 3. 2 R₊ (italics), or 7. 2 x 1 O¹⁴ cm for a stellar distance of 1. 5 kpc. If the stellar position is assumed to be the centre of this ring then almost all of the maser components fall within the inner dust shell radius, which is at ~ 5 R (italics) ϰ All of the maser components fall between 1. 5 R (italics) ϰ and 6 R (italics) ϰ. A velocity gradient with position angle was observed in the sparsely filled western region of the maser ring.
