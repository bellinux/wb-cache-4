5|$|Rule 90 is an {{elementary}} cellular automaton. <b>That</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> {{it consists of}} a one-dimensional array of cells, each of which holds a single binary value, either 0 or 1. An assignment of values {{to all of the}} cells is called a configuration.

A pre-specified rule determines the new value of each cell as a function of its previous value and of the values in its two neighboring cells. All cells obey the same rule, which may be given either as a formula or as a rule table that specifies the new value for each possible combination of neighboring values.|$|E
