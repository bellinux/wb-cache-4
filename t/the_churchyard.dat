5|$|The medieval church {{cross in}} <b>the</b> <b>churchyard,</b> the Stanley Mausoleum, and <b>the</b> <b>churchyard</b> walls, gate piers and gates, are GradeII listed.|$|E
5|$|Against {{the west}} {{boundary}} of <b>the</b> <b>churchyard</b> are situated the Commonwealth war graves of a Royal Welsh Fusiliers soldier and two merchant seamen of World War I.|$|E
5|$|By the 19th century, the {{graveyard}} was full {{and had become}} a public health concern. It was overrun with rats, and dogs chasing the rats, {{both of which were}} damaging <b>the</b> <b>churchyard.</b> Finding sufficient ground for new burials was increasingly difficult and bones were often removed to a nearby charnel house. In 1849, an extra charge was put on burials of people from outside the parish. In 1884, <b>the</b> <b>churchyard</b> was closed to all burials and a cemetery was opened in the town.|$|E

5|$|Individuals {{buried in}} <b>the</b> <b>churchyard</b> include squires Charles Keyser (1847–1929) and Daniel Burr (c.1811–1885), {{schoolmaster}} John Stair (c.1745–1820), and Maria Hale (1791–1879).|$|E
5|$|Parish worship {{transferred}} to the new church, {{along with some of}} the fittings. The old church was thereafter used as a mortuary chapel for a time. <b>The</b> <b>churchyard</b> continued to be used for burials until 1902. In modern times, the owners of Plas Llanidan have restored the church, and it is used by them as a private chapel. <b>The</b> <b>churchyard</b> is kept locked, but the church and the gardens of Plas Llanidan are occasionally opened to the public.|$|E
5|$|St Nicholas Church, {{near the}} river Thames, has a 15th-century tower, {{although}} {{the remainder of the}} church was rebuilt by J.L. Pearson in 1882–84. Monuments in <b>the</b> <b>churchyard</b> mark the burial sites of the 18th-century English artist William Hogarth and William Kent, the architect and landscape designer; <b>the</b> <b>churchyard</b> also houses a mausoleum (for Philip James de Loutherbourg) designed by John Soane, and the tomb of Josiah Wedgwood's business partner, Thomas Bentley, designed by Thomas Scheemakers. One of Oliver Cromwell's daughters, Mary Fauconberg, lived at Sutton Court and is buried in <b>the</b> <b>churchyard.</b> Enduring legend has it that the body of Oliver Cromwell was also interred with her, though as the Fauconbergs did not move to Sutton Court until 15 years after his disinterment, it is more likely he was reburied at their home at Newburgh Priory. Private Frederick Hitch VC, hero of Rorke's Drift, is also buried there.|$|E

5|$|St Nicholas' Church, the {{original}} parish church, {{dates back to}} the 14th century but the current building is 17th century. The entrance to <b>the</b> <b>churchyard</b> features a set of skull-and-bones on top of the posts. A plaque on the north wall commemorates playwright Christopher Marlowe, who was murdered in a nearby house, and buried in an unmarked grave in <b>the</b> <b>churchyard</b> on 1 June 1593.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>churchyard</b> also {{contains}} ten Commonwealth war graves of British service personnel, seven from World War I and three from World War II.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>churchyard</b> {{contains}} 51gravestones {{dating from}} the 17thcentury. The most important monument is the canopied tomb {{of a member of}} the Venables family, which dates from the late 13thcentury; crocketed pinnacles on the canopy date from the 17thcentury. Formerly inside the church, the tomb contains two figures, male and female, with their hands clasped in prayer. The only one of its kind in Cheshire, it is listed GradeII*, and is a scheduled monument. There are two further notable memorials in <b>the</b> <b>churchyard,</b> one to the north and the other to the south of the Venables tomb. Both are in yellow sandstone, date from the medieval period, and include weathered recumbent effigies. The one to the north possibly depicts a cleric with his hands in prayer, and the one to the south is a knight in armour with a missing leg. <b>The</b> <b>churchyard</b> also contains a sundial, consisting of two octagonal steps that were originally the base of a 16th-century cross supporting an 18th-century octagonal pillar. In addition to being listed, it is also a scheduled monument. The gateway to <b>the</b> <b>churchyard</b> dates from the 17thcentury, and consists of a yellow sandstone arch with crocketed pinnacles and a battlemented parapet. All of these structures are listed as GradeII. <b>The</b> <b>churchyard</b> contains the war graves of 16British servicemen, 15of World War I, and one of World War II. A yew tree in <b>the</b> <b>churchyard</b> is believed to be over 1,000years old.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>churchyard</b> covers {{some two}} acres. Most of the headstones in <b>the</b> <b>churchyard</b> are modern – {{many of them}} are from the nineteenth century – but <b>the</b> <b>churchyard,</b> which is now closed to new interments, {{contains}} some old monuments. The whole churchyard and church is surrounded by what was once a typical sign of an early Celtic church; an oval formation of trees. There are also indications which suggest the remains of an early pond, probably for keeping fish for the priests and monks who once lived there. There is no visible trace of any conventual buildings (which would probably have been mostly relatively slight wooden structures, and never extensive). In the early nineteenth century Meyrick does however record the survival of what appeared to be stone monastic or church buildings.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>churchyard</b> gate to {{the south}} west {{of the church is}} listed grade II (26 October 2002). Given the {{relative}} size of <b>the</b> <b>churchyard,</b> the church and each of the two gates have their own postcode: the postal address of the church is Primrose Hill, Llanbadarn Fawr, Aberystwyth, Ceredigion SY23 3QZ, the postcode of the west gate is SY23 3QY.|$|E
