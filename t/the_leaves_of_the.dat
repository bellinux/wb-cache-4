5|$|Neolithic cave {{paintings}} do {{not have}} traces of green pigments, but neolithic peoples in northern Europe did make a green dye for clothing, made from <b>the</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> birch tree. it was of very poor quality, more brown than green. Ceramics from ancient Mesopotamia show people wearing vivid green costumes, {{but it is not}} known how the colors were produced.|$|E
5|$|Animals {{and birds}} {{associated}} with C.australis include lizards which forage among the flowers, including the gold-striped gecko which is well camouflaged for life among <b>the</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tree. New Zealand bellbirds like to nest under the dead leaves or among the flower stalks, and paradise shelducks commonly build their nests {{in the base}} of an old cabbage tree {{standing in the middle of}} a field. Red-crowned parakeets are often seen foraging in cabbage trees. In South Canterbury, long-tailed bats shelter during the day in the hollow branches, which would once have provided nesting holes for many birds.|$|E
5|$|Other common {{household}} {{substances that}} should be used with caution around cats include mothballs and other naphthalene products. Phenol-based products (e.g. Pine-Sol, Dettol/Lysol or hexachlorophene) are often used for cleaning and disinfecting near cats' feeding areas or litter boxes, but these can sometimes be fatal. Ethylene glycol, often used as an automotive antifreeze, is particularly appealing to cats, and {{as little as a}} teaspoonful can be fatal. Some human foods are toxic to cats; for example chocolate can cause theobromine poisoning, although (unlike dogs) few cats will eat chocolate. Large amounts of onions or garlic are also poisonous to cats. Many houseplants are also dangerous, such as Philodendron species and <b>the</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Easter lily (Lilium longiflorum), which can cause permanent and life-threatening kidney damage.|$|E

5|$|Other mammals can be destructive. Possums {{tend not}} to eat <b>the</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tree, but are very fond of eating the sugar-rich {{flowering}} stalks as they emerge. They also like using the tree as a sleeping place. Rabbits can be more destructive, especially during periods of drought, when they have been seen to eat through the base until a tree falls, and then eating the fallen tree completely. Horses can also fell a tree by eating through the trunk.|$|E
5|$|The current {{design of}} the seal was {{standardized}} by the Indiana General Assembly in 1963. During {{the meeting of the}} General Assembly, Representative Taylor I. Morris introduced legislation to standardize the design of the state seal. His bill described a seal that depicts a woodsman chopping a sycamore tree, while an American Bison runs in the foreground and the sun rises in the background. <b>The</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state tree, the tulip, were to be the border design. The bill passed the assembly that session and became law.|$|E
5|$|Thigmonastic movements, {{those that}} occur in {{response}} to touch, are used as a defense in some plants. <b>The</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sensitive plant, Mimosa pudica, close up rapidly in response to direct touch, vibration, or even electrical and thermal stimuli. The proximate cause of this mechanical response is an abrupt change in the turgor pressure in the pulvini {{at the base of}} leaves resulting from osmotic phenomena. This is then spread via both electrical and chemical means through the plant; only a single leaflet need be disturbed.|$|E
25|$|In some jurisdictions {{it is also}} {{possible}} to appeal against an award on a point of law, however, such appeals normally require either <b>the</b> permission <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other parties, or <b>the</b> <b>leave</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> court.|$|R

5|$|Two {{conflicting}} {{factors are}} involved in host preferences, the species {{and the age of}} the leaf. Offered spindle and beet leaves on growing plants throughout the year, winged aphids moved {{from one to the other}} depending on the active growth state of each and the senescence of each host plant. Thus in late summer and autumn, the beet leaves were old and unattractive to the aphids in comparison with <b>the</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spindle, whereas in spring, the young unfolding leaves of the beet were more attractive than those of the spindle.|$|E
5|$|If all edge weights of an {{undirected graph}} are positive, then the minimax {{distances}} between pairs of points (the maximum edge weights of minimax paths) form an ultrametric; conversely every finite ultrametric space comes from minimax distances in this way. A data structure constructed from the {{minimum spanning tree}} allows the minimax distance between any pair of vertices to be queried in constant time per query, using lowest common ancestor queries in a Cartesian tree. The root of the Cartesian tree represents the heaviest minimum spanning tree edge, {{and the children of}} the root are Cartesian trees recursively constructed from the subtrees of the minimum spanning tree formed by removing the heaviest edge. <b>The</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cartesian tree represent the vertices of the input graph, and the minimax distance between two vertices equals the weight of the Cartesian tree node that is their lowest common ancestor. Once the minimum spanning tree edges have been sorted, this Cartesian tree can be constructed in linear time.|$|E
