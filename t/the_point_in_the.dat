5|$|Halley's {{orbital period}} has varied between 74–79 years since 240 BC. Its {{orbit around the}} Sun is highly elliptical, with an orbital {{eccentricity}} of 0.967 (with 0 being a circle and 1 being a parabolic trajectory). The perihelion, <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> comet's orbit when it is nearest the Sun, is just 0.6 AU. This is between the orbits of Mercury and Venus. Its aphelion, or farthest distance from the Sun, is 35 AU (roughly the distance of Pluto). Unusual for an object in the Solar System, Halley's orbit is retrograde; it orbits the Sun {{in the opposite direction}} to the planets, or, clockwise from above the Sun's north pole. The orbit is inclined by 18° to the ecliptic, with much of it lying south of the ecliptic. (Because it is retrograde, the true inclination is 162°). Due to the retrograde orbit, it {{has one of the highest}} velocities relative to the Earth of any object in the Solar System. The 1910 passage was at a relative velocity of 70.56km/s (157,838mph or 254,016km/h). Because its orbit comes close to Earth's in two places, Halley is associated with two meteor showers: the Eta Aquariids in early May, and the Orionids in late October. Halley is the parent body to the Orionids. Observations conducted around the time of Halley's appearance in 1986 suggested that the comet could additionally perturb the Eta Aquarid meteor shower, although it might not be the parent of that shower.|$|E

40|$|Objectives. To {{investigate}} the mechanical responses of microdefect articular cartilage under rolling load {{and find out}} the failure rule. Methods. Rolling load {{was applied to the}} porcine articular cartilage samples with rectangular notches of different depths. The displacement and strain near the notches were obtained by the noncontact digital image correlation technique. Results. The strain value and peak frequency around the notch increased; the maximum equivalent strain value could be observed at both bottom corners of the notch; the equivalent strain value first increased and then decreased at <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> superficial and middle layers with the increase of rolling velocity; <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> deep layer were less affected by rolling velocity; the equivalent strain value of <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> superficial layer declined after rising with the increase of defect depth, while a decreased trend could be found for <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle and deep layers. Conclusions. The shear strain, which rose with <b>the</b> increase <b>in</b> defect depth, was <b>the</b> main factor <b>in</b> cartilage destruction. <b>The</b> cartilage tended to be destructed firstly at the bottom corner of the defect. Rolling velocity showed significant effects on superficial and middle layers. Cartilage had the ability to resist destruction...|$|R

25|$|Most councillors contemplating delaying {{setting a}} rate {{considered}} that the crucial point would come at <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{year when the}} first rate payments would have become due; if the council had not set a rate at that point, it {{would be unable to}} recover the interest on the payments due to have been made to it. The General Rate Act 1967 section 50 and schedule 10 gave ratepayers the right to pay by ten instalments which were to be paid at monthly intervals during the year. With a financial year ending on 31 March, the latest date to start the payment was 1 July; the council had to give ten days' notice of a payment being due, so the latest date for setting a rate without incurring irrecoverable debts was 20 June.|$|E
25|$|The {{basic problem}} with {{estimating}} a gas allowance for contingencies {{is to decide}} what contingencies to allow for. This is addressed in the risk assessment for the planned dive. A commonly considered contingency is to share gas with another diver from <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dive where the maximum time is needed to reach the surface or other place where more gas is available. It is likely that both divers will have a higher than normal RMV during an assisted ascent {{as it is a}} stressful situation. It is prudent to take this into account. The values should be chosen according to recommendations of the code of practice in use or the training agency, but if a higher value is chosen it is unlikely that anyone would object. Recreational divers may have the discretion to use RMV values of their own choice, based on personal experience and informed acceptance of risk.|$|E
