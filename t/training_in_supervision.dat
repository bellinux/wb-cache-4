40|$|This study {{examined}} {{the current state of}} affairs of training in the practice of supervision in doctoral programs and predoctoral internship sites accredited by the American Psy-chological Association. Results indicated that although a majority of programs and sites offered some type of opportunity for <b>training</b> <b>in</b> <b>supervision,</b> there were differences in the methods and extent of the training.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{identify}} the key features of supervision from {{the perspectives of}} educational supervisors and specialist registrars. DESIGN: Critical incident study. Telephone interviews were conducted with selected informants representing a range of specialties. The sample comprised educational supervisors with an identified interest in supervision, specialist registrars and GP trainees in the Yorkshire region. RESULTS: Educational supervisors and specialist registrars were generally agreed on what constitutes effective supervision: direct supervision was seen as very important. Educational supervisors and specialist registrars had very different concerns in relation to ineffective supervision: specialist registrars were concerned with inadequate supervision whilst educational supervisors were concerned with failures in direct supervision and poorly performing trainees. Supervision practices varied between specialties; in this study there seemed to be particular problems in anaesthesia, medicine and paediatrics. CONCLUSIONS: Direct supervision {{and the quality of the}} supervisory relationship are key to effective supervision. There is a need for clear guidance on supervision and the establishment of appropriate procedures and mechanisms to resolve difficulties relating to inadequate supervision for trainees and performing trainees.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} an ongoing 3 -year study of {{the current status of}} {{instructional}} supervision within New York City public schools. Under the influence of a centralized and bureaucratically managed system (i. e., top down initiatives), educational reform in New York City has had serious consequences for both the theory and practice of instructional supervision. Supervision, for the most part, remains a monitoring or inspectional task reminiscent of older forms of supervision. Although reform measures address the need for increased supervision and professional development, principals and their assistants perform predominantly non-instructional duties and evaluative functions. Supervision, as a means to promote instructional dialogue to improve teaching in the classroom, has been the responsibility primarily (although unofficially) of coaches (a position created in the restructuring of schools).

30|$|Few {{studies have}} {{examined}} the types of trainings or professional development that would be most useful for agency staffs who work with FCC providers. Yet, the expansion of quality improvement systems and programs that include FCC providers has resulted in jobs that require skilled and trained professionals who know how to engage FCC providers in quality improvement initiatives. Research on agency staff and coaches who work with both FCC and center teachers suggests that this sector of the early childhood workforce has unique needs for training that addresses both child and adult development. Whitebook et al. (2012) reported that close to half of infrastructure staff would like more training in child development, especially those staffs that do not hold an early childhood education degree. Nearly a third of staff reported wanting additional <b>training</b> <b>in</b> <b>supervision</b> and management. Drake et al. (2006) found that agency staff would like additional knowledge on the specific needs of FFN caregivers as well as models of effective support and professional development for home-based child care providers. Ackerman (2008) found that QRIS coaches who only have a background in early childhood education and experience may lack the necessary skills and knowledge required to perform the work of quality improvement coaching. Together these findings suggest the need for further examination of the types of training and professional development that would most benefit agency specialists in their support and coaching roles with FCC providers.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1973 The {{purpose of}} the study was to develop a {{proposed}} in-service program for cooperating teachers who supervise student teachers. Forty-one cooperating teachers for the Home Economics Education Department of Oregon State University rated the competencies of a good supervisor of student teachers. Also, 17 heads of home economics teacher education departments in universities and colleges suggested what preparation and on-going help cooperating teachers should have. An analysis of the data revealed that the department heads believe a formal graduate course in supervision was a necessity. In addition, seminars or workshops at regular intervals were also deemed important for updating. It was learned the majority of the respondents had never had a course or in-service <b>training</b> <b>in</b> <b>supervision</b> other than cooperating teacher seminars and a large number felt themselves deficient in many areas. It was found a number of the cooperating teachers experience common problems, such as: methods of evaluation, techniques in developing ability within the student teacher to express and use her own ideas, need for a class on supervision, ways of being more helpful in general to the student teacher, how to effectively guide the student teacher without doing too much for them and help the student teacher build self-confidence.

Therapists who are <b>trained</b> <b>in</b> psychodynamic theory frequently describe supervision as a special relationship, different from but akin to a therapy relationship. It is important that a supervisor have a certain type of experience <b>in</b> <b>supervision</b> to aid <b>in</b> lhe resolution of internal conflicts which impede performance as a therapist.

40|$|Strategies are {{presented}} for helping mental health counseling (MHC) students navigate {{the process of}} receiving clinical supervision, from preparing for and initiating supervision to participating actively within and between sessions. Information from supervision practices and principles pro-vides the foundation for guiding students in {{making the most of}} their first experiences in clinical supervision. Within the field of counseling and psychotherapy, clinical supervision has only recently been recognized as a specialty in its own right (Bernard & Goodyear, 1998). No longer viewed as merely an extension of the therapeu-tic process, some licensing boards (e. g., Alabama and Louisiana) are requir-ing clinicians to receive specialized training in clinical supervision before cre-dentialing them as approved supervisors. Actual <b>training</b> <b>in</b> <b>supervision,</b> how-ever, still lags far behind available knowledge and research, resulting in wide variability of styles and quality. Moreover, even with extensive training and optimum conditions, supervision is a challenging and sometimes daunting enterprise. One way to mitigate the impact of the varying quality of supervi-sion is through education of the consumer, the supervisee. Although the literature is sparse, a few authors (N. Berger & Graff, 1995; S. S. Berger & Buchholz, 1993; Bernard, 1994) have emphasized the impor-tance of preparing mental health counseling (MHC) students to receive supervision and have provided suggestions for such preparation. Without exception, these authors suggested that a basic component of learning how to be supervised involved being exposed to the fundamentals of providing supervision. Recognizing that many supervisors lack formal training in such fundamentals as supervisor roles and stages of supervision (Nelson, Johnson...|$|E
40|$|Therapistsʼ process notes - written {{descriptions}} of a session produced shortly afterwards from memory - hold {{a significant role}} in child and adolescent psychoanalytic psychotherapy. They are central in <b>training,</b> <b>in</b> <b>supervision,</b> and in developing oneʼs understanding through selfsupervision and forms of psychotherapy research. This thesis examines such process notes through a comparison with audio recordings of the same sessions. In so doing, it aims to generate theory that might illuminate the causes of significantly patterned discrepancies between the notes and recordings, in order to understand more about the processes at work in psychoanalytic psychotherapy and to explore the nature of process notes, their values and limitations. The literature searches conducted revealed limited relevant studies. All identified studies that compare process notes with recordings of sessions seek to quantify {{the differences between the two}} forms of recording. Unlike these, this thesis explores the meaning of the differences between process notes and recordings through qualitative data analysis. Using psychoanalytically informed grounded theory, in total nine sets of process notes and recordings from three different psychoanalytic psychotherapists are analysed. The analysis identifies eight core categories of findings. Initial theories are developed from these categories, most significantly concerning the role and influence of a ʻcore transference dynamicʼ between therapist and patient. Further theory is developed on the nature and function of process notes as a means for the therapistʼs conscious and unconscious processing of the session, as well as on the nature of the influence of the relationships – both internal and external – within which they are written. In the light of the findings, a proposal is made for a new approach for learning about the patient and clinical work, ʻthe comparison methodʼ (supervision involving a comparison of process notes and recordings), and, in particular, for its inclusion within the training of psychoanalytic psychotherapists. Further recommendations for research are also made...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{elements}} of 'good' social work supervision {{from the perspective of}} the participants of supervision, analyses a supervision session between one supervision dyad and considers this data against the theories and models presented in the literature. A qualitative methodology was adopted using in-depth interviews and a focus group to identify the characteristics of good supervision {{from the perspective of the}} supervisee. A similar methodology was used to interview the supervisors of these supervisees. The supervisors were asked to discuss the supervision which they provided and the beliefs and theories which guided their practice. The reports of these two groups were supported by the analysis of a recorded supervision session between one of the supervision pairs. The findings indicated four key elements to good supervision:- the qualities and attitudes brought by the supervisee, the qualities and the attributes brought by the supervisor, the element of choice within the relationship and the nature of the supervision relationship itself. The role of choice was considered to be of particular significance to the success of supervision, promoting commitment and deepened responsibility from both supervisor and supervisee. It was also noted that all of the supervisors and four of the six supervisees had <b>training</b> <b>in</b> <b>supervision</b> and it is suggested that this training promotes the ability of both of the participants to produce 'good' supervision. Two recommendations are made: that social work managers consider ways to introduce choice of supervisor to all social workers and that supervision fraining is encouraged for all social workers The relative merits and roles of internal and external supervision are discussed and, following suggestion from the data, a re-vision of supervision is proposed which moves social work supervision from a single relationship into a framework of different services and relationships...|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} {{is based on}} the need for formal <b>training</b> <b>in</b> social work <b>supervision</b> with the emphasis on the experiences and feelings associated with the role change from supervisee to supervisor. Practice has shown that the transition from supervisee to supervisor takes place with very little, if any, formal training. It is assumed that any experienced social worker could give supervision as if this is merely an extension of your field work activities – which include casework, group work and community work. Whilst doing supervision cognisance was taken {{of the fact that the}} task of the supervisor was to help the supervisee gain access to a more advantageous position from which to consider or view their work. A supervisor had a crucial role in professional development. The opinion is upheld that there has to be a working alliance to attain this development. This working alliance can be taken further when viewed by the fact that the supervisor also has to establish communication networks that enable the supervisor to work both at a managerial level while maintaining positive relationships with his or her supervisees – a process which is fraught with complications. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with fourteen social work supervisors and a focus group was conducted with five social work supervisors from the Department of Welfare and Private Welfare Organizations. These interviews were conducted to obtain their perspectives on the need for <b>training</b> <b>in</b> social work <b>supervision</b> and how training could help them <b>in</b> their <b>supervision</b> role which ultimately could result in a more efficient service that is rendered to the client. The data analysis was conducted at the same time as the data collection. The researcher had a clear plan for the data management. The researcher utilized reasoning strategies, identified themes, categories and subcategories. It was borne in mind that there was no one way of performing data analysis. The researcher was open and flexible. Final conclusions of the data analysis was grounded in the data obtained.

40|$|Supervision {{has been}} {{referred}} to as the component of doctoral training that has the greatest impact on the competencies of psychology trainees (Johnson 2 ̆ 6 Stewart, 2000). Nevertheless, there are considerable gaps in the empirical literature examining psychotherapy supervision. One topic that has been particularly ignored in the empirical literature is supervisor development. Considering this, the purpose of the current study was twofold. The first purpose was to examine factors that promote the development of supervisors. The second purpose was to explore how supervisor development impacts supervisor attributes. Supervisors (N = 99) of pre-doctoral interns from APA approved internship sites in counseling and clinical psychology completed a questionnaire that examined types of <b>training</b> <b>in</b> <b>supervision,</b> as well as length of experience as both a supervisor and therapist, the Psychotherapy Supervisory Development Scale (PSDS), the Supervisory Styles Inventory (SSI), and the Working Alliance Inventory—Supervisor (WAI-S). Results indicated that types of training were related to supervisor development. Specifically, it was found that supervisors who had participated in a practicum class on supervision, a combined practicum/didactic class on supervision, or had received supervision of his/her provision of supervision had significantly higher scores on supervisor development than those supervisors who had not. However, experience as a supervisor and experience as a therapist were not significantly related to supervisor development. In addition, supervisors with more varied types of training experiences were significantly more developed that those with fewer training experiences. Results of {{the second part of the}} study demonstrated a connection between supervisor development and two components of supervisory style as well as the supervisory working alliance. Specifically, results provided support that both interpersonally sensitive and attractive supervisory styles serve as mediators in the relation between supervisor development and the supervisory working alliance. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} field supervisors 2 ̆ 7 multicultural competence and {{the inclusion of}} multicultural and diversity issues in field supervision within masters 2 ̆ 7 degree counselor training programs. Changing demographics in the United States have necessitated that counseling {{move away from the}} ethnocentric framework that has dominated the field. Consequently, professional organizations and academic institutions now include a multicultural component to training. However, much counselor training takes place with supervisors in the field, many of whom were trained prior to multicultural and diversity issues being included in academic programs. ^ This study was designed to begin to address the scarcity of theoretical knowledge and the lack of empirical scholarship relating to multicultural supervision, by assessing field supervisors 2 ̆ 7 multicultural competency. It is hoped that this research will assist academic institutions in providing support and training opportunities for field supervisors. The Multicultural Counseling Competencies (Sue, Bernier, Durran, Feinberg, Pedersen, Smith, 2 ̆ 6 Vasquez-Nuttal, 1982; Sue, Arredondo, 2 ̆ 6 McDavis, 1992) were used as the theoretical model for measuring multicultural competence. Specifically, the Multicultural Counseling Inventory (MCI) (Sodowsky, Taffe, Gutkin, 2 ̆ 6 Wise, 1994) was used to asses the multicultural competence of counseling students 2 ̆ 7 field supervisors, and a researcher designed survey, the Questionnaire for Field Supervisors, (QFS) (Durham, 1999) was used to assess the inclusion of multicultural and diversity issues in the process of supervision. Selected demographic variables, including supervisors 2 ̆ 7 gender (Carter, 1990), race/ethnicity (Holcomb-McCoy 2 ̆ 6 Myers, 1999; Ponterotto 2 ̆ 6 Casas, 1987), exposure to diverse populations (Pope-Davis 2 ̆ 6 Ottavi, 1994; Sodowsky et al., 1991), years since graduate training (Ponterotto 2 ̆ 6 Casas, 1987), and formal <b>training</b> <b>in</b> <b>supervision</b> (Durham, 1999) which have been previously associated with multicultural competence were correlated with the field supervisors 2 ̆ 7 multicultural competence and the inclusion of multicultural issues in supervision. ^ The study indicates that multicultural training, (e. g. formal course work, seminars, and workshops) increases supervisors 2 ̆ 7 multicultural competence as indicated by MCI Total, Awareness, and Knowledge scores. Also, the inclusion of multicultural issues within supervision is related to multicultural competence, again as measured by the MCI. And finally, being female and professional employment in a multiculturally diverse geographic area is correlated with the Multicultural Awareness, Knowledge and Skills MCI scores. ...|$|E

Í greininni er fjallað um þróun handleiðslu og gerð grein fyrir íslenskri spurningakönnun sem send var 795 einstaklingum úr sex faghópum. Verkefnið var styrkt af Leónardó-áætlun Evrópusambandsins. Höfundur framkvæmdi könnunina í samstarfi við fulltrúa sex fagfélaga. Þeir sáu um dreifingu spurningalista. Faghóparnir voru geðhjúkrunarfræðingar, félagsráðgjafar, iðjuþjálfar, námsráðgjafar, sjúkraþjálfarar, og sálfræðingar. Markmið könnunarinnar var að fá heildaryfirlit yfir stöðu handleiðslumála og samanburð á reynslu faghópa og viðhorfum þeirra til handleiðslu í þeim tilgangi að greina hvaða úrræði eru fyrir hendi og geta metið þörf fyrir nám og þjálfun í handleiðslu. Svarshlutfall var 56 %. Svörin úr hverjum hópi eru of fá til þess að tölfræðilegar forsendur leyfi mikla sundurgreiningu einstakra breyta eða samanburð á afmörkuðum atriðum. Fjallað er því aðallega um niðurstöðurnar í heild. Könnunin gefur upplýsingar um þörf fagfólks fyrir handleiðslu og hvernig það óskar sér fyrirkomulag og þjálfun. Einnig fást hér vísbendingar fyrir vinnuveitendur um hvernig megi hlú að fagfólki þannig að það njóti sín betur á vinnustað, skili þá væntanlega betri árangri og ílengist í starfi. Í umræðukafla er fjallað um gildi handleiðslu í meðferðarstörfum og margþættan tilgang í fageflingu og stjórnun. Supervision is {{a concept}} linked to {{therapeutic}} work, leadership and administration in human service organizations. In the article {{the results of a}} study on supervision are presented and the development and role of supervision is discussed. Questionnaires were sent to 795 professionals of six categories. The project was implemented with financial support from the European Leonardo Program (Icelandic Leonardo Center) The author who is an associate professor at the Dep. of Social Work at the University of Iceland conducted the study in cooperation with representatives from six professional associations, i. e. the associations of psychiatric nurses, social workers, educational counselors, occupational therapists, physiotherapists and psychologists. Two categories which initially planned to participate dropped out. The object {{of the study was to}} get an overview of the supervisory level and a comparison of the experience and attitudes of the various categories in this regard, in order to be able to analyze available resources and estimate the need for education and <b>training</b> <b>in</b> <b>supervision.</b> The response rate was rather poor, 56 %. Occupational therapists educational counselors responded best. The response rate does not allow much statistical analysis or differentiation between categories or variables. Therefore the results are presented and discussed in terms of general patterns The usefulness of the study consists in its rather clear indications and information about the professionals's need for supervision and how they wish it to be planned. It gives important information to administrators and professioinal leaders in human service organizations about how to support the professionals so that they feel better in their work and thus might be expected to become more efficient and more committed to the field and institution they are serving...|$|E

40|$|This article {{describes}} the coding portion of a study to test {{the effectiveness of a}} motivational interviewing (MI) training program for probation officers. We describe some of the challenges with using the Motivational Interview Treatment Integrity (MITI) instrument to code interactions between probation officers and clients. Our team of raters was able to obtain adequate inter-rater reliability on most MITI scales, though reliability ratings on some of the specific behavior counts such as Giving Information, MI Adherent, and MI Non-adherent fell considerably lower than the original MITI norming study. Our results suggest that the MITI is a mostly reliable instrument for coding criminal justice interactions, though there were exceptions to this rule. Based on our experiences, we discuss some of the ways that probation interactions might be different from traditional counseling interactions, and identify some rules of thumb that helped us to code interactions. We end with suggestions for how MITI feedback can be used effectively <b>in</b> <b>training</b> and <b>supervision</b> <b>in</b> criminal justice and other non-traditional settings. </p...|$|R
40|$|Latina {{mental health}} {{professionals}} encounter many opportunities and challenges in professional settings. As Latinas increasingly enter the profession, we are now having our first opportunity to supervise another Latina. This opportunity is often greeted with great excitement and anticipation; however, it also presents unique professional challenges. These challenges often include, {{but are not limited}} to, the potential to blur boundaries in an unhealthy manner, idealization and then unmet expectations, overidentification, and cultural misunderstandings based on ethnic differences. Little has been written about Latina-Latina supervisory dyad relationships. Few Latina psychologists have had formal <b>training</b> <b>in</b> providing <b>supervision</b> to other Latinas and yet the future promises to increase these types of experiences. The authors developed a Multicultural Developmental Supervisory Model (MDSM) that integrates specific Latina/o multicultural counseling competencies and Latina/o ethnic identity theory, with developmental theories of supervision. The MDSM is designed to identify the complex processes that influence the <b>supervision</b> dyad <b>in</b> an effort to provide guidance and support to the supervisor and the supervisee as well as the institutions <b>in</b> which <b>supervision</b> takes place...|$|R
