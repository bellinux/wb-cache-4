I never {{expected}} anything from him--anything serious, of course--never dared to hope for it. I have thrown myself at {{his head in the}} most shameless manner. It is all no good.

However, don't let <b>that</b> <b>bother</b> <b>you,</b> and above all, don't think of coming out to this place which makes you miserable, and where you can't work. What a queer menage you must be at the Abbey now! You and the Star who has risen from the ocean--she {{ought to have been}} called Venus--tete-a-tete, and the, I gather, rather feeble and uninteresting old gentleman in bed upstairs. I should like to see you when you didn't know. Why don't you invent a machine to enable people at a distance to see as well as to hear each other? It would be very popular and bring Society to utter wreck. Does the Northern star--she is Danish, isn't she?--make good coffee, and how, oh! how does she get on with the cook?" ...|$|E

Anything <b>that</b> <b>bothers</b> <b>you</b> is completely washed from your body. I see fly-fishing as a washing machine for your brain. My technique is still ugly as sin.

5000|$|The song {{originated}} between vocalist Nicholas Petricca and guitarist Eli Maiman, {{who first}} developed the verse and found something infectious about it. The following weekend, Petricca {{went to a}} party named Funky Soul Saturday at The Echo in Echo Park, Los Angeles while feeling frustrated with the writing process. The song is largely based on that night: [...] "We were at the bar, and it was taking forever to get a drink. I was frustrated because there was great music playing and I wanted to be out there," [...] he remembered. His girlfriend, in [...] "a backless dress and some beat up sneaks", abruptly invited him to dance with her, inspiring the song's title. Petricca later went home {{to work on the}} song, and incorporated his experiences into the song's lyrics. After creating the song's main refrain, he began picturing himself in high school: an [...] "incredibly uncomfortable, awkward adolescent dude," [...] he imagined the song as [...] "an anthem for the dork who is 100 percent me." [...] In an interview with American Songwriter, he summarized the song's theme as [...] "Encouraging people to let go of whatever it is <b>that’s</b> <b>bothering</b> <b>you</b> and get into your body and out of your head." ...|$|R

[...] And after a little more talk he succeeded in mollifying the cook and the hired girl {{to such an extent}} that they went back to their work. Then the fathers of the boys withdrew once more to the library.|$|R
5000|$|Championship Manager 2010 has {{received}} more positive reviews than previous versions of the Championship Manager series. Eurogamer gave the game an 8 out of 10 stating [...] "For the first time, the Championship Manager series is {{a viable alternative to}} Football Manager... CM10's attempts to innovate must be applauded, and the majority of its refinements are either solid additions or real winners. MSN UK also applauded the game and concluded [...] "Once you get stuck into a season, it is fearsomely addictive, and all aspects of football management are present and correct, if not necessarily developed to Football Manager’s level of sophistication. It is a lot more forgiving than Football Manager... If <b>that</b> doesn’t <b>bother</b> <b>you,</b> it’s worth considering {{for the first time in}} years." ...|$|R
5000|$|Nobel Prize-winning {{physicist}} Richard Feynman recounts that he {{was approached}} by young rabbis in a seminary who asked him [...] "is electricity fire?". He replied, [...] "no", but asked why they wanted to know, and was shocked that they weren't interested in science at all, but just wanted to interpret the Talmud. Feynman said that electricity was not a chemical process, as fire is, and {{pointed out that there}} is electricity in atoms and thus every phenomenon that occurs in the world. Feynman proposed a simple way to eliminate the spark: '"If <b>that's</b> what's <b>bothering</b> <b>you,</b> you can put a condenser across the switch, so the electricity will go on and off without any spark whatsoever—anywhere.' But for some reason, they didn't like that idea either".|$|R

We can't call witnesses and see what the real problems are, can we, in creating this new, substantive rule that we're going to let the courts create? Congress could do all that, though, couldn't it? ...If it wanted to change the habeas statute, it could make all sorts of refined modifications about issues that we know nothing whatever about because we have only lawyers before us, we have no witnesses, we have no cross-examination, we have no investigative staff. And we should be the ones, Justice Breyer suggests, to draw up this reticulated system to preserve our military from intervention by the courts." ...|$|R
6000|$|Gerald Burke {{was silent}} for some time. [...] "The scheme seems a {{possible}} one," [...] he said at last; [...] "it {{is the question of}} the priest <b>that</b> <b>bothers</b> me. <b>You</b> know, both in Seville and Cadiz there are Irish colleges, and at both places there are several priests whom I knew before they entered the Church, and who would, I am sure, perform the service for me on any ordinary occasion; but it is a different thing asking them to take a share in such a business as this, for they would render themselves liable to all sorts of penalties and punishments from their superiors. However, the difficulty must be got over somehow, and at any rate the plan seems to promise better than anything I had thought of. The first difficulty is how to get the ruffians for such a business. I cannot go up to the first beetle browed knave I meet in the street and say to him, 'Are you disposed to aid me in the abduction of a lady?'" ...|$|R

They begin with gratitude <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>bothered</b> asking {{and then move}} on to recitations of all the good that's going on. Hurricane Katrina, and the flood that followed, struck two years ago this month, and since then the tourists have returned, basic services are operating, and the city has crafted a comprehensive recovery plan. Linger a bit on the subject, however, and optimism quickly turns to exasperation. Lack of government leadership, the glacial pace of rebuilding, and outright rage at absent neighbors who've yet to demolish blighted homes top the list of gripes...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{reason for}} putting it there," [...] said Burke, [...] "is to get clear {{of all the}} noise and dirt of building, and the fuss and <b>bother</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> dislike so much. And then {{when it was all}} finished, and painted, and papered, and the carpets down, if you like, I'd have it moved right up here against your house just where you want it. When {{everything}} was in order, and you was ready, you could cut a door right through into the new dining-room, and there you'd be. They've got so in the way of slidin' buildings along on timbers now that they can travel about almost like the old stage coaches, and you needn't have your cellar dug until you're ready to clap your new dining-room right over it." ...|$|R

5000|$|In {{regards to}} whether or not he became {{comfortable}} with portraying Craig's sexual attraction to John Paul, Burnet clarified: [...] "Even towards the end, it was always difficult for me… You've got to remember that the room is full of people and it's not so much <b>that</b> which <b>bothers</b> <b>you,</b> but you're sitting there and - this isn't meant in a homophobic way - I just didn't feel comfortable doing it. It literally would be a silent set, we'd do it and hopefully it was one take and it was out of the way. That's a genuine answer." [...] In late 2007, Burnet decided to leave the series, stating that he wanted to pursue other acting ventures. However, he agreed to return to the series in late 2008. [...] "I’ve had so much support from fans since I left the show, so it’s great {{to have the opportunity to}} reprise the storyline and give viewers a resolution to the Craig and John Paul story," [...] he revealed. In September 2012, Inside Soap named John Paul and Craig's exit as their number 1 happy ending, [...] "This tentative, tremulous, tortured romance is still regarded by Hollyoaks fans as one of the show's greatest-ever storylines - if not the greatest. So fervently were viewers wishing for a happy ending for gay teenager John Paul and his no-I'm-not-gay-but-maybe-I-am friend Craig, the producer even promised a happy ending in advance. And so, as they flew off to Dublin together, they kissed in front of a holiday poster of a sunset. Aw!" ...|$|R
