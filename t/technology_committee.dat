40|$|Some S&P 500 {{firms have}} {{recently}} formed <b>technology</b> <b>committees</b> at the board-level. This study investigates the corporate governance and firm financial performance {{implications of the}} voluntary formation of <b>technology</b> <b>committees</b> {{by members of the}} S&P 500. Using financial performance and structure-related variables, {{the results of the study}} suggest that firms' corporate governance ratings are significantly and positively related to their decisions to voluntarily form <b>technology</b> <b>committees.</b> Specifically, firm performance ratios such as return on assets, return on equity, and net profit margin appear to be associated with firms' decisions to form board-level <b>technology</b> <b>committees.</b> These findings have post Sarbanes-Oxley corporate governance and performance implications and should be relevant for stakeholders such as the SEC, various stock exchanges, and the firms themselves.
