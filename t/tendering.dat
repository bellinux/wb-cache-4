5|$|The French Directory did as well. In mid April, {{suffering}} from an nephritic complaint, Jourdan handed over command to {{his chief of}} staff, general of division Jean Augustin Ernouf, and returned to Paris {{to complain about the}} lack of men, the inexperience of the men he had, their supplies, and the size, experience, and supply of the army he had to face. He found little sympathy there, and when he told the Directory that he was ill, <b>tendering</b> his resignation, it was accepted.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the <b>tendering</b> process, {{the four}} G3 battlecruisers were ordered on 24 October 1921, without names, from John Brown, Swan Hunter, William Beardmore and Fairfield. Following the visit of an Admiralty delegation, {{detailed}} constructional drawings were sent to John Brown on 3 November with a request that copies be urgently circulated to the other successful contractors. Work at John Brown progressed on the keel blocks and hull plates for the subsequent two weeks. Notwithstanding other events, instructions and amendments continued to arrive from various departments within the Admiralty until 25 November.|$|E
5|$|Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Baxter Healthcare Pty Ltd, (Baxter) was a {{decision}} of the High Court of Australia, which ruled on 29 August 2007 that Baxter Healthcare Proprietary Limited, a tenderer for various government contracts, was bound by the Trade Practices Act 1974 (TPA, Australian legislation governing anti-competitive behaviour) in its trade and commerce in <b>tendering</b> for government contracts. More generally, the case concerned the principles of derivative governmental immunity: whether the immunity of a government from a statute extends to third parties that conduct business with the government.|$|E

When a <b>tender</b> or bid is being called, a <b>tender</b> or bid number is usually issued as a reference number for the <b>tender</b> box.

5|$|In October 2009, {{the launch}} of a call for tenders stalled {{following}} discussions between the Scottish Executive and HM Treasury over new regulations that required public–private partnerships to be recorded as public expenditure. A project timetable was announced by Finance Secretary John Swinney on 4 November 2009, whereby he stated that construction of the line would not begin prior to the 2011 elections to the Scottish Parliament. The <b>tendering</b> process finally began on 16 December 2009, when a contract notice {{was published in the}} Official Journal of the European Union.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of the submarine commenced in May 1983, when the government released a request for tender and approached seven of the world's nine diesel-electric submarine manufacturers for submissions. The submissions would be narrowed down to two based on the provided information, with these undergoing a funded study to determine the winning design. <b>Tendering</b> companies had to demonstrate how Australian industries would {{be incorporated into the}} project, and that they were willing to establish an Australia-based consortium to construct the submarines. All seven companies responded {{by the end of the}} year: the combined submissions totalling four tonnes (9,000lb) of paper.|$|E
5|$|The BBC had {{initiated}} <b>tendering</b> to {{have the}} LS3/5 made under license. As the broadcasting unit was about to order another batch of the monitor, {{it was found that}} KEF had discontinued the B110 (A6362) and the T27 (A6340) in favour of the B110 (SP1003) and T27 (SP1032) specification, and was already using them in the Coda, one of their own-brand commercial loudspeakers. Thus the design had to be revised because these new units had different impedances, technical characteristics and altered resonance patterns. The tweeter was considered potentially fragile because it now had an exposed dome, so a suitable protection grille was found to cover and protect the dome. The tweeter was also surrounded by a thick felt rectangle to prevent interference pattern effects being created by the edge of the cabinet. The crossover also had to undergo change, and the LS3/5 became the LS3/5A in the early summer of 1974.|$|E
50|$|Invitation to <b>tender</b> is also {{a similar}} process to a <b>tender</b> notification. The major {{difference}} is the institution or organisation who created the <b>tender</b> chooses who to invite, often {{in the form of}} a closed <b>tender.</b> <b>Tender</b> notification services provide a vast array of people and companies about an open <b>tender</b> that anyone can apply for.|$|R
50|$|<b>Tender</b> {{notifications}} (sometimes called <b>tender</b> alerts), {{provide the}} client with given <b>tender</b> {{information that they}} desire. This is often delivered {{in the form of}} an email notification, saving the client visiting multiple websites to check for updates on potential clients. Most repacks provide both private and public sector <b>tender</b> opportunities. The idea is that <b>tender</b> notification systems deliver <b>tender</b> opportunities to the company, dramatically reducing the amount of time spent looking for these <b>tenders.</b>|$|R
50|$|Type MP1 <b>tenders</b> {{originally}} entered South African Railways (SAR) {{service in}} 1912, as <b>tenders</b> to Class 12 Mountain type locomotives. The locomotive and <b>tender</b> {{were designed by}} D.A. Hendrie, Chief Mechanical Engineer of the SAR. <b>Tenders</b> were numbered for their original engines and an oval number plate, bearing the engine number and often also the <b>tender</b> type, {{was attached to the}} rear end of the <b>tender.</b> The particular <b>tender</b> which was to be modified to Type XP1, entered service in 1913 as <b>tender</b> to Class MC1 Mallet no. 1634.|$|R
5|$|The Theatre outpaced 362 other Pepsi Refresh entrants, and was {{in first}} place {{by the middle of}} April. The RTC {{attributed}} its success in the contest to its use of social networking services, notably Facebook. The group considered moving to a digital projector with the forthcoming grant to replace the existing projector, an expected cost of $100,000. By late May, the group had won the April competition and was waiting for the Pepsi funds, before <b>tendering</b> a down payment on the Theatre, initially planned for June10. The closing date of the sale was pushed back to allow time to finalize the deal. In mid-June, the Playback Theatre planned a benefit for the RTC in which improv actors would perform skits based on audience members' stories of experiences they had at the Theatre.|$|E
5|$|In March 1942, Nedić {{suggested}} to the Germans that the SDK and Pećanac Chetniks {{be incorporated into}} the SDS and that he take control of the force, but this idea was firmly rejected. In mid-1942, Meyszner appointed Dragomir Jovanović, the German-approved mayor and chief of police of Belgrade, as chief of Serbian State Security, which included responsibility for the SDS. The Germans considered that Radovanović was a Mihailović sympathiser, so in June 1942 he was replaced by Colonel Borivoje Jonić, the brother of Nedić's minister of education, Velibor Jonić. In July 1942 the SDS consisted of 15,000–20,000 men. In August and September 1942, Nedić again tried to have the SDS placed under his command, and the German refusal to do so contributed to him <b>tendering</b> his resignation. Nedić had threatened to resign several times previously for similar reasons, but on this occasion the Germans took it more seriously and offered him an audience with Adolf Hitler. On that basis, Nedić remained at his post. In October 1942, the Border Guard was transferred to the Ministry of Finance. Also in 1942, the Gestapo arrested some SDS officers suspected of having links with Mihailović, {{and by the end of}} 1942 the Germans had purged the SDS in an attempt to eliminate those who sympathised with Mihailović. One of the senior SDS officers arrested by the Gestapo during the purge was Lieutenant Colonel Milan Kalabić, the prefect of Požarevac, and father of one of Mihailović's unit commanders, Nikola Kalabić. The elder Kalabić had been passing information, arms and ammunition to Mihailović's Chetniks. In October 1943, Milan Kalabić was executed by the Germans along with other Chetnik commanders and men.|$|E
