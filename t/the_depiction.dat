The critic Dominic Manganiello suggests that, in combining the image of dancing with purgation, Eliot merges Dante's and Yeats's poetic themes.|$|E

The functions of <b>the</b> figural <b>depictions</b> in <b>the</b> belief {{and practice of}} Graeco-Egyptian magic [...] Conclusion. The aim of this thesis is to demonstrate that <b>the</b> figural <b>depictions</b> in <b>the</b> magical papyri formed part of a conceptualised system of magical imagery. Rather than being haphazard sketches, it will be argued that <b>the</b> figural <b>depictions</b> were meaningful images, whose execution and use in rites and spells reflect considered ritualistic actions. Using PGM XXXVI as a case study, it will be established that <b>the</b> <b>depictions</b> were governed by a strict set of iconographic regulations. Specific terminology, uniform compositional placement, a desire to execute <b>the</b> <b>depictions</b> accurately, as well as recurring pictorial motifs, suggest that the images existed within a pre-established iconographic system. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>depictions</b> appear to have retained specific functions within the magical papyri. These functions were accordingly fluid and changed relative to {{the context of the}} depictions' use (whether in applied magic or magical handbooks). As such, <b>the</b> <b>depictions</b> were utilised as part of the materiality of magic praxis. Finally, it will be demonstrated that <b>the</b> figural <b>depictions</b> were considered significant in the belief and practice of Graeco-Egyptian magic. This is indicated by the images' complex relationship with magical practitioners, wherein they enacted as intermediaries between the mundane and supernatural worlds. Moreover, the ritual act of drawing <b>the</b> <b>depictions</b> in magical praxis suggests that they were fundamental elements in the enactment of particular rites and spells.

50|$|There {{are three}} major themes in <b>the</b> <b>depictions</b> of <b>the</b> Last Supper: {{the first is}} the {{dramatic}} and dynamic depiction of Jesus' announcement of his betrayal. The second is the moment of the institution of the tradition of <b>the</b> Eucharist. <b>The</b> <b>depictions</b> here are generally solemn and mystical. The third major theme is the farewell of Jesus to his disciples, in which Judas Iscariot is no longer present, having left <b>the</b> supper. <b>The</b> <b>depictions</b> here are generally melancholy, as Jesus prepares his disciples for his departure. There are also other, less frequently depicted scenes, such as the washing of the feet of the disciples.|$|R

5|$|As {{with all}} of his Brushstrokes works, it is in part a satirical {{response}} to the gestural painting of Abstract Expressionism.

5|$|Don't Look Now {{is renowned}} for its {{innovative}} editing style and its use of recurring motifs and themes and for a controversial sex scene that was explicit for its time. The film often employs flashbacks and flashforwards in keeping with <b>the</b> <b>depiction</b> of precognition, but some scenes are intercut or merged to alter the viewer's perception of what is really happening. It adopts an impressionist approach to its imagery, often presaging events with familiar objects, patterns and colours using associative editing techniques.|$|E
