Stressed syllables are pronounced longer, but unstressed syllables (syllables between stresses) are shortened. Vowels in unstressed syllables are shortened as well, and vowel shortening causes changes in vowel quality: vowel reduction.|$|E

5|$|Paleoclimatologists {{measure the}} ratio of oxygen-18 and oxygen-16 in the shells and skeletons of marine organisms to {{determine}} the climate {{millions of years ago}} (see oxygen isotope ratio cycle). Seawater molecules that contain the lighter isotope, oxygen-16, evaporate at a slightly faster rate than water molecules containing the 12% heavier oxygen-18, and this disparity increases at lower temperatures. During periods of lower global temperatures, snow and rain from that evaporated water <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> higher in oxygen-16, and the seawater left behind <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> higher in oxygen-18. Marine organisms then incorporate more oxygen-18 into their skeletons and shells than they would in a warmer climate. Paleoclimatologists also directly measure this ratio in the water molecules of ice core samples as old as hundreds of thousands of years.|$|E
