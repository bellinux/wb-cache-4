50|$|Early {{battery backup}} systems were huge, dwarfing {{the size of}} the lights for which they {{provided}} power. The systems normally used lead acid batteries to store a full 120-volt charge. For comparison, an automobile uses a single lead acid battery as part of the ignition system. Simple <b>transistor</b> or <b>relay</b> technology was used to switch on the lights and battery supply {{in the event of a}} power failure. The size of these units, as well as the weight and cost, made them relatively rare installations. As technology developed further, the voltage requirements for lights dropped, and subsequently {{the size of the}} batteries was reduced as well. Modern lights are only as large as the bulbs themselves - the battery fits quite well in the base of the fixture.|$|R

5000|$|In {{electronics}} a {{relaxation oscillator}} is a nonlinear electronic oscillator circuit {{that produces a}} nonsinusoidal repetitive output signal, such as a triangle wave or square wave. The circuit consists of a feedback loop containing a switching device such as a <b>transistor,</b> comparator, <b>relay,</b> op amp, or a negative resistance device like a tunnel diode, that repetitively charges a capacitor or inductor through a resistance until it reaches a threshold level, then discharges it again. [...] The period of the oscillator depends on the time constant of the capacitor or inductor circuit. [...] The active device switches abruptly between charging and discharging modes, and thus produces a discontinuously changing repetitive waveform. [...] This contrasts with the other type of electronic oscillator, the harmonic or linear oscillator, which uses an amplifier with feedback to excite resonant oscillations in a resonator, producing a sine wave. [...] Relaxation oscillators are used to produce low frequency signals for applications such as blinking lights and electronic beepers and in voltage controlled oscillators (VCOs), inverters and switching power supplies, dual-slope analog to digital converters, and function generators.|$|R

5000|$|In circuit design, informally, passive {{components}} refer to {{ones that are}} not capable of power gain; this means they cannot amplify signals. Under this definition, {{passive components}} include capacitors, inductors, resistors, diodes, transformers, voltage sources, and current sources. They exclude devices like <b>transistors,</b> vacuum tubes, <b>relays,</b> tunnel diodes, and glow tubes. Formally, for a memoryless two-terminal element, {{this means that the}} current-voltage characteristic is monotonically increasing. For this reason, control systems and circuit network theorists refer to these devices as locally passive, incrementally passive, increasing, monotone increasing, or monotonic.

40|$|Current Solid Freeform Fabrication (SFF) {{technologies}} can manufacture, {{directly from}} digital data, end-use mechanical parts {{in an increasingly}} wide variety of engineering materials. However, commercial SFF systems remain costly, complex, proprietary, and are limited to working {{with one or two}} proprietary materials during the course of building a part, hindering their broader application and the impact of the technology. The work we present here demonstrates (1) that SFF systems can employ many materials and multiple processes during the course of building a single object, (2) that such systems can produce complete, active, electromechanical devices, rather than only mechanical parts, and (3) that such multi-material SFF systems can be made accessible to, and are of interest to the general public. We have developed a researchoriented, multi-material SFF system and employed it to produce not only mechanical parts, but complete and functional Zn-air batteries, electrical wiring, flexible circuit boards, straingages, electromagnets, electroactive polymer actuators, organic-polymer <b>transistors,</b> and electromechanical <b>relays.</b> We have also developed and published the Fab@Home Model 1 open-source, multi-material, freeform fabrication system design.

40|$|Hygrometers are {{generally}} {{applied in the}} meteorological (weather) stations, industries, laboratories and at homes to determine the moisture content in the air or humidity. They could be of mechanical or electronic design. This paper presents a cheap, affordable and efficient electronic means of measuring and controlling humidity at homes and in industries. The system comprises of: a power supply unit, a humidity sensor/buffer unit, a precision half-wave rectifier/amplifier unit, an ac source generator, a buffered analogue (Vcc/ 2) reference ground unit and an output unit (a meter and switching control). It {{has the ability to}} measure the relative humidity automatically. Above a preset level of 80 %, the switching control output through the action of two Darlington <b>transistors</b> operates a <b>relay</b> which in turn switches on any device connected to it. This device tends to dry up the air surrounding the sensor thereby reducing the relative humidity. And once the value drops below 80 %, the device deactivates. The hygrometer can be used to provide a direct display of the relative humidity and control the switching of some appliances such as air conditioners and air dryers, once the value exceeds 80 %. The electronic hygrometer thus plays a significant role in humidity measurement and control environments by providing or allowing a high level of accuracy, faster response time and lower levels of hysteresis...|$|R
50|$|Prior to the 1980s most {{electronic}} scoreboards were electro-mechanical. They contained relays or stepping switches controlling digits {{consisting of}} incandescent light bulbs. Beginning in the 1980s, advances in solid state electronics permitted major improvements in scoreboard technology. High power semiconductors such as thyristors and <b>transistors</b> replaced mechanical <b>relays,</b> light-emitting diodes first replaced light bulbs for indoor scoreboards and then, as their brightness increased, outdoor scoreboards. Light-emitting diodes last {{many times as}} long as light bulbs, {{are not subject to}} breakage, and are much more efficient at converting electrical energy to light. The newest light emitting diodes can last up to 100,000 hours before having to be replaced. Advances in large-scale integrated circuits permitted the introduction of computer control. This also made it cost effective to send the signals that control the operation of the scoreboard either through the existing AC wires providing power to the scoreboard or through the air. Powerline modems permit the digital control signals to be sent over the AC power lines. The most common method of sending digital data over power lines at rates less than 2400 bits per second is called frequency shift keying (FSK). Two radio frequencies represent binary 0 and 1. Radio transmission such as FSK sends data digitally. Until recently radio transmission was subject to short range and interference by other radio sources. A fairly recent technology called spread spectrum permits much more robust radio control of scoreboards. Spread spectrum, like the name implies, distributes the signal over a wide portion of the radio spectrum. This helps the signal resist interference which is usually confined to a narrow frequency band.|$|R
40|$|A {{variety of}} {{semiconductor}} devices and circuits {{have been successfully}} developed using conduction properties of electrons and holes {{in a number of}} elemental and compound semiconductors. Carriers confinement in a potential well, formed out of a thin layer of lower band gap material sandwitched between two layers of a higher band gap material, has been extended from one to two and three dimensions. Resultant oftwo-dimensional carrier sheet, quantum wire and quantum dot having discrete energy levels arising out of quantisation are being presently explored for possible device applications. A number of devices have been fabricated using resonant tunneling across a thin potential barrier. This has opened up several newer possibilities of using such structures for various electronic and optoelectronic devices and circuits applications as tunneling is relatively faster than conduction process. While looking into the interband tunneling between two quantum dots, possibility of a single electron switching has also been examined carefully. The idea of a single electron switching is conceptually being extended from quantl,lm dots to molecules and atoms ultimately. Simulations based on transmission of electrons through a chain of molecules and atoms have shown that tens of THz speed and functional device density 1012 devices/mm 2 are possible with such schemes. Devices based on atom <b>relay</b> <b>transistor</b> (ART) will be ultimate in its performance of switching speed. A brief on present-day situation followed by future proposals of fast switching devices for information electronics has been discussed. gap and effective mass. In another approach, carriers mobility has been enhanced by transferring them from a higher band gap layer to a lower band gap intrinsic layer across a heterostructure, where impurity scattering is avoided. This h~s led to fast growth of a family of high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) during the last decade. Using novel device structures based on nanostructure fabrication, single electron and hole transltiohs have been experimentally confirmed. I...|$|R
