Gureshidze decided to fly back to Georgia to mourn the loss of his teammate, and the athletes who participated all wore a black stripe on their helmets in honour of Kumaritashvili.|$|E
5|$|A few teams {{expressed}} interest in St. Louis. He chose to sign with the Tampa Bay Lightning as he believed {{they were the most}} likely to give him playing time in the NHL. He made his debut with the team on October 6, 2000. He struggled at first, failing to score a goal in the first six weeks of the season and again found himself out of the lineup at times. Realizing that he was at a career crossroads, St. Louis abandoned <b>the</b> <b>changes</b> <b>to</b> his game that his NHL coaches had impressed on him, trusting his own instincts. He scored his first goal of the season in late November, and finished the season with 18 goals and 40 points – 34 of which came after December 1.|$|E
5|$|Accompanying <b>the</b> <b>changes</b> <b>to</b> timbre {{and volume}} was {{a shift in}} the typical pitch used to tune instruments. Instruments meant to play together, as in an orchestra, must be tuned to the same {{standard}} lest they produce audibly different sounds while playing the same notes. Beginning in 1762, the average concert pitch began rising from a low of 377 vibrations to a high of 457 in 1880 Vienna. Different regions, countries, and even instrument manufacturers preferred different standards, making orchestral collaboration a challenge. Despite even the efforts of two organized international summits attended by noted composers like Hector Berlioz, no standard could be agreed upon.|$|E

The speed requirements were derived from the speed of aircraft the helicopter would escort. The Director of Defense Research and Engineering (DDRE) conditionally approved <b>the</b> <b>changes</b> <b>to</b> the development objectives, pending his review of the proposed program. He also directed the Army {{to determine whether or}} not any other helicopter could offer an improvement in performance over the UH-1B in the meantime.|$|E
5|$|Despite <b>the</b> <b>changes</b> <b>to</b> {{the design}} and its growing costs, {{construction}} of three DDLs {{was approved by the}} Liberal Party McMahon Government in August 1972. At this time, the total project cost was estimated at A$355 million; this figure included all costs associated with building three ships and operating them for ten years. The ships themselves were expected to cost approximately $210 million. All three ships were to be built at Williamstown Dockyard, with construction of the first ship beginning in 1975, followed by the other ships at two-yearly intervals. The initial DDL was to be commissioned in 1980, and the third in 1984. Further DDLs may also have been ordered over time to replace the Navy's destroyers as they reached the end of their service lives.|$|E
5|$|Engineering {{requirements}} {{resulted in}} significant {{changes to the}} specification of the XJ220, most notably replacement of the Jaguar V12 engine by a turbocharged V6 engine. <b>The</b> <b>changes</b> <b>to</b> the specification and a collapse {{in the price of}} collectible cars brought about by the early 1990s recession resulted in many buyers choosing not to exercise their purchase options. A total of just 275 cars were produced by the time production ended, each with a retail price of £470,000 in 1992 making it their most expensive car during its debut.|$|E

5|$|Further {{action was}} not taken until 1902, when new {{regulations}} for prison officers {{were published in}} the Government Gazette. A new Prison Act was passed in 1903, replacing sixteen previous acts. It provided for classification of prisoners, provision of adequate work for prisoners, and the creation of the position of comptroller general of prisons, to assume the functions the sheriff had undertaken as inspector of prisons. While in theory the passing of the act should have been a landmark moment in prison reform, this did not eventuate. The legislation left much of <b>the</b> <b>changes</b> <b>to</b> executive regulation, at the discretion of the governor, and was described by the media as a feeble document. Other problems included Fremantle Prison's inscrutability for classification, due to its design, and that the sheriff was allowed to hold the office of comptroller general of prisons, effectively making it no more than a change in name.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, NSB {{announced}} that the traffic around Trondheim would become the Trøndelag Commuter Rail, which would take {{over most of the}} Class 92 trains. The service started on 1 September 1993. <b>The</b> <b>changes</b> <b>to</b> the schedule involved almost a doubling of the number of departures, particularly between Trondheim and Stjørdal, where a one-hour headway was introduced. The service from Trondheim to Steinkjer had ten daily round trips. While local trains had existed previously north of Trondheim, the services south to Oppdal were all new in an area which was previously only served by intercity and night trains. The initial services consisted of four services from Trondheim—northwards along the Nordland Line to Steinkjer, east along the Meråker Line to Storlien, south along the Dovre Line to Oppdal and south-east along the Røros Line to Tynset.|$|E

5|$|Initially, {{there was}} an {{intention}} to procure up to 400 aircraft for the Royal Navy and the RAF, but the development cost for <b>the</b> <b>changes</b> <b>to</b> accommodate the Spey turbofans meant that the per-unit price eventually ended up three times the price of an F-4J.

Finally, Kennedy was concerned that the court did not address the question of the Equal Protection Clause. He would have reversed the Eighth Circuit without going into the additional detail.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>changes</b> <b>to</b> the DDL design {{reflected}} shifting {{requirements and}} poor project management by the Navy.
