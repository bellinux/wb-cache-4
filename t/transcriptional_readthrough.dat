5000|$|At the {{transcript}} level, {{disruption of the}} EAR motif leads to {{a significant decrease in}} the expression of distally located eps genes (epsF-O) without affecting proximal genes (epsC-E). Consistent with this observation, several potential intrinsic terminator hairpins were found inside the epsF coding region. [...] A wild-type EAR element is capable of promoting <b>transcriptional</b> <b>readthrough</b> of these epsF terminator sites. In contrast, mutational disruption of EAR instead permits termination at the epsF terminators. The EAR element also promotes readthrough of heterologous termination sites. From these data it was hypothesized that the EAR element controls eps expression through a processive antitermination mechanism to ensure the complete synthesis of the 16 kilobase operon. [...] Processive antitermination, as opposed to {{the transcript}}ion attenuation mechanism typically used by other cis-acting regulatory RNAs, is a process wherein the transcription elongation complex is altered by accessory factors to become resistant to pausing and termination signals. So far, EAR is the only processive antitermination system specific for Gram-positive bacteria. Further experiments failed to reconstitute EAR-mediated processive antitermination mechanism in vitro or in a Gram-negative heterologous host (E. coli), suggesting that additional B. subtilis-specific factor(s) may also be required for EAR antitermination.|$|E

Virol. 76, 7209 – 7219, 2002). However, the U 3 -deleted, self-inactivating (SIN) lentiviral LTR also exhibits high <b>transcriptional</b> <b>readthrough</b> activity. Since the canonical "core" polyadenylation signal (AAUAAA) of the lentivirus {{is located in the}} R-U 5 region, the above finding suggests that additional RNA termination signals must be present in the U 3 region. Insertion of alternative termination signals including panhuman T cell leukemia virus type I polyadenylation signal, a 3 ' end small intron, and a tertiary tRNA motif into the lentiviral SIN LTR did not restore the transcriptional termination function. Functional dissection of the U 3 region revealed that 70 – 80 % of the termination signals reside in the transcriptional control region within 124 nt overlapping NFκB, Sp 1 and TATA binding sites. Serial deletion analysis of the transcriptional control region indicates that the lentiviral enhancer/promoter elements are essential to the RNA termination function. These results characterize the mechanism of lentiviral <b>transcriptional</b> <b>readthrough,</b> which addresses important fundamental and practical issue of RNA readthrough influencing lentiviral gene function and vector safety...|$|E

40|$|The Bacillus subtilis tyrS gene, {{encoding}} tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase, is {{a member}} of the T-box family of genes, which are regulated by control of readthrough of a leader region <b>transcriptional</b> terminator. <b>Readthrough</b> is induced by interaction of the cognate uncharged tRNA with the leader; the system responds to decreased tRNA charging, caused by amino acid limitation or insufficient levels of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase. Recognition of the cognate tRNA is mediated by pairing of the anticodon of the tRNA with the specifier sequence of the leader, a codon specifying the appropriate amino acid; a second interaction between the acceptor end of the tRNA and an antiterminator structure is also important. Certain switches of the specifier sequence to a new codon result in a switch in the specificity of the amino acid response, while other switches do not. These effects may reflect additional sequence or structural requirements for the mRNA-tRNA interaction. This study includes investigation of the effects of a large number of specifier sequence switches in tyrS and analysis of structural differences between tRNA(Tyr) and tRNA species which interact inefficiently with the tyrS leader to promote antitermination...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the tandemly repeated ribosomal genes of eukaryotes may be subject to a special mechanism of <b>transcriptional</b> enhancement, called <b>Readthrough</b> Enhancement, in which transcription factors are recycled. Recent experiments with the mouse ribosomal genes, although consistent with this possibility, were unable to distinguish between true Readthrough Enhancement and promoter occlusion. To test directly for Readthrough Enhancement, the pre-ribosomal RNA of Xenopus laevis was prematurely terminated within the 18 S gene on a circular template. This premature termination was found to reduce the efficiency of pre-ribosomal RNA promotion in cis by 80 to 90 %. Since the pre-ribosomal RNA is normally terminated only 213 base pairs upstream of its own initiation site, the results strongly suggest that the recycling of RNA polymerase, or Readthrough Enhancement, is a means by which ribosomal transcription is enhanced in Xenopus laevis...|$|R

40|$|Tens of {{thousands}} of chimeric RNAs, i. e., RNAs with sequences of two genes, {{have been identified in}} human cells. Most of them are formed by two neighboring genes on the same chromosome and are considered to be derived via <b>transcriptional</b> <b>readthrough,</b> but a true readthrough event still awaits more evidence and trans-splicing that joins two transcripts together remains as a possible mechanism. We regard those genomic loci that are transcriptionally read through as unannotated genes, because their transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulations are the same as those of already-annotated genes, including fusion genes formed due to genetic alterations. Therefore, readthrough RNAs and fusion-gene-derived RNAs are not chimeras. Only those two-gene RNAs formed at the RNA level, likely via trans-splicing, without corresponding genes as genomic parents, should be regarded as authentic chimeric RNAs. However, since in human cells, procedural and mechanistic details of trans-splicing have never been disclosed, we doubt the existence of trans-splicing. Therefore, there are probably no authentic chimeras in humans, after readthrough and fusion-gene derived RNAs are all put back into the group of ordinary RNAs. Therefore, it should be further determined whether in human cells all two-neighboring-gene RNAs are derived from <b>transcriptional</b> <b>readthrough</b> and whether trans-splicing truly exists...|$|E

We subsequently isolated hydroxylamine-induced mutants of that plasmid {{that had a}} further increase in copy number. Analysis of them suggests that the increased copy number of pDMS 6642 is associated with <b>transcriptional</b> <b>readthrough</b> from a Tn 3 transposon into the region of ColE 1 containing information that influences plasmid replication. The hydroxylamine mutation in one copy number mutant appeared to increase the plasmid copy number by stimulating readthrough transcription from the Tn 3 transposon into the ColE 1 replication control region, whereas the other hydroxylamine mutation acts by another mechanism...|$|E

While the NRS mutant viruses showed only small changes in the levels of spliced env mRNAs, they had significant increases in src mRNA levels and transformed cells more efficiently than wild-type virus. None of these mutations prevented viral replication; however, some of the mutant viruses replicated more slowly than wild-type virus.

40|$|MicroRNA (miRNA) play a {{major role}} in the post-transcriptional {{regulation}} of gene expression. Mammalian miRNA biogenesis begins with co-transcriptional cleavage of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcripts by the Microprocessor complex. While most miRNA are located within introns of protein coding genes, a substantial minority of miRNA originate from long non coding (lnc) RNA where transcript processing is largely uncharacterized. Here, by detailed characterization of liver-specific lnc-pri-miR- 122 and genome-wide analysis, we show that most lnc-pri-miRNA do not use the canonical cleavage and polyadenylation (CPA) pathway but instead use Microprocessor cleavage to terminate transcription. Microprocessor inactivation leads to extensive <b>transcriptional</b> <b>readthrough</b> of lnc-pri-miRNA and transcriptional interference with downstream genes.

With improved extraction procedures, the 22 S RNA was found to represent up to 25 % of the total transcription in NDV-infected cells. This RNA was resolved into at least five discrete species on formaldehyde-agarose gels. All but one of these molecules contain 3 ' polyadenylate sequences but not internal polyadenylate sequences.

40|$|The {{copy number}} of {{plasmids}} containing the ColE 1 replicon {{is affected by}} changes in the transcriptional activity within the plasmid if these changes lead to <b>transcriptional</b> <b>readthrough</b> into the replication region towards the promoter priming DNA replication. Such readthrough e. g., from the tet region in pBR 322 not only causes overproduction of a peptide known to affect the copy number negatively but also appears to interfere negatively with the replication of the plasmid itself. The proper placement of efficient transcriptional terminators prevents such interference and permits the stable integration of strong promoters. Due to this termination effect, up to 9 -fold differences in plasmid copy number were observed, depending upon the particular growth conditions. The higher copy number is of course reflected by higher yields of plasmid-specified gene products indicating {{the relevance of the}} above effects for studies of gene expression...|$|E

Mixed ANOVA models are applied to quantify the various sources of error. Such analysis also allows us to determine the optimal number of samples and arrays. Significance values for differential expression are obtained by a hierarchical bootstrapping scheme on scaled residuals. Four highly upregulated genes, including bfrB, were analyzed further.

40|$|We use an {{oligonucleotide}} {{library of}} > 10, 000 variants to identify an insulation mechanism encoded within {{a subset of}} σ 54 promoters. Insulation manifests itself as reduced protein expression for a downstream gene that is expressed by <b>transcriptional</b> <b>readthrough.</b> It is strongly associated {{with the presence of}} short CT-rich motifs (3 – 5  bp), positioned within 25  bp upstream of the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) motif of the silenced gene. We provide evidence that insulation is triggered by binding of the ribosome binding site (RBS) to the upstream CT-rich motif. We also show that, in E. coli, insulator sequences are preferentially encoded within σ 54 promoters, suggesting an important regulatory role for these sequences in natural contexts. Our findings imply that sequence-specific regulatory effects that are sparsely encoded by short motifs may not be easily detected by lower throughput studies. Such sequence-specific phenomena can be uncovered with a focused oligo library (OL) design that mitigates sequence-related variance, as exemplified herein...|$|E
40|$|Proper 3 ′ end {{formation}} {{is critical for}} the production of functional mRNAs. Termination by RNA polymerase II is linked to mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation, but it is less clear whether earlier stages of mRNA production also contribute to transcription termination. We performed a genetic screen to identify mutations that decreased <b>transcriptional</b> <b>readthrough</b> of a defective GAL 10 poly(A) terminator. A partial deletion of the GAL 10 downstream region leads to transcription through the downstream GAL 7 promoter, resulting in the inability of cells to grow on galactose. Mutations in elongation factors Spt 4 and Spt 6 suppress the readthrough phenotype, presumably by decreasing the amount of polymerase transcribing through the downstream GAL 7 promoter. Interestingly, mutations in the mRNA-binding protein Npl 3 improve transcription termination. Both in vivo and in vitro experiments suggest that Npl 3 can antagonize 3 ′ end formation by competing for RNA binding with polyadenylation/termination factors. These results suggest that elongation rate and mRNA packaging can influence polyadenylation and termination...|$|E

The highly abundant short transcript (CTO-S) proved to be encoded between the ul 21 and ul 22 genes in close vicinity of the replication origin (OriL) of the virus. The less abundant long RNA molecule (CTO-L) is a <b>transcriptional</b> <b>readthrough</b> product of the ul 21 gene and overlaps OriL. These polyadenylated RNAs were characterized by ascertaining their nucleotide sequences with the Illumina HiScanSQ and Pacific Biosciences Real-Time (PacBio RSII) sequencing platforms and by analyzing their transcription kinetics through use of multi-time-point Real-Time RT-PCR and the PacBio RSII system. It emerged that transcription of the CTOs is fully dependent on the viral transactivator protein IE 180 and CTO-S is not a microRNA precursor.

Miniplasmids containing the entire EcoRI B fragment (the "E miniplasmids") were found to regulate LacZ expression normally, indicating that sufficient information is present on this fragment to regulate a pheromone response. These plasmids also encoded normal replication functions. The E miniplasmids were further reduced by deleting a KpnI fragment. These "K miniplasmids" were able to perform most of the functions central to a pheromone response but failed to induce the fused transcripts to levels observed in the parental plasmids. This defect was found to be due to a pheromone-dependent growth inhibition of cells containing the K miniplasmids.

While the level of relAp 2 transcripts remained relatively constant, relAp 1 activity apparently peaked during transition phase, following a decline in readthrough transcription from apt. Disruption of relA using an att- derivative of the temperate phage φC 31 abolished ppGpp synthesis on amino acid depletion. When grown on agar, the disruptants grew more slowly than a control lysogen made with an att+ phage vector and gave smaller colonies that sporulated normally.

40|$|There {{is ample}} {{evidence}} that cells of higher eukaryotes express double-stranded RNA molecules (dsRNAs) either naturally or {{as the result of}} viral infection or aberrant, bidirectional <b>transcriptional</b> <b>readthrough.</b> These duplex molecules can exist in either the cytoplasmic or nuclear compartments. Cells have evolved distinct ways of responding to dsRNAs, depending on the nature and location of the duplexes. Since dsRNA molecules are not thought to exist naturally within the cytoplasm, dsRNA in this compartment is most often associated with viral infections. Cells have evolved defensive strategies against such molecules, primarily involving the interferon response pathway. Nuclear dsRNA, however, does not induce interferons and may play an important posttranscriptional regulatory role. Nuclear dsRNA appears to be the substrate for enzymes which deaminate adenosine residues to inosine residues within the polynucleotide structure, resulting in partial or full unwinding. Extensively modified RNAs are either rapidly degraded or retained within the nucleus, whereas transcripts with few modifications may be transported to the cytoplasm, where they serve to produce altered proteins.

The expression of carboxypeptidase in E. coli was 100 -fold lower than in the Pseudomonas sp. strain. When the cloned gene was subcloned into the Pseudomonas vector pKT 230 and introduced into Pseudomonas putida 2440, a 30 -fold increase in expression over that obtained in E. coli was observed. High expression (up to 5 % soluble protein) was obtained in E. coli by subcloning a 3. 1 -megadalton Bg/II fragment into the BamHI site of pAT 153. The increased expression was orientation dependent and is presumed to be due to <b>transcriptional</b> <b>readthrough</b> from the Tc promoter of the vector.

The genomes of the remaining eight plaque-purified viruses were sequenced in the region where the P 20 consensus sequence differed from the virulent progenitor. The seven protective clones were identical, whereas the non-protective virus retained the virulent progenitor sequence at two positions and contained extensive alterations in its attachment (G) protein sequence associated with a reduced or altered expression pattern of G protein on Western blots.

40|$|The Suppressor-mutator (Spm) {{family of}} maize transposable {{elements}} consists of autonomous Spm elements and nonautonomous defective Spm (dSpm) elements. One characteristic {{of this family}} is that the insertion of dSpm elements into a structural gene often permits some level of structural gene expression {{in the absence of}} Spm activity, and this structural gene expression is suppressed in trans by Spm activity. The Spm's subterminal repetitive regions (SRRs) contain several iterations of a 12 -bp repeat motif. It had been proposed that binding of an Spm-encoded protein to these repeat motifs blocks structural gene <b>transcriptional</b> <b>readthrough,</b> thus suppressing gene expression. The bz-m 13 allele of the bronze 1 locus contains a 2. 24 -kb dSpm insertion in the second exon of a Bz allele. In the absence of Spm activity, bz-m 13 displays substantial Bz expression, and this expression is fully suppressed by Spm. Four intra-dSpm deletion derivatives are described in which this Bz expression is only partially suppressed by Spm. Each of these derivatives retains at least 12 SRR repeat motifs. Thus the presence of these repeat motifs is not sufficient to guarantee complete suppression by Spm. Some other property such as secondary structure or element size must play a role...|$|E

Chen, M. L. Harless, D. A. Wright, and R. E. Kellems, Mol. Cell. Biol. 10 : 4555 - 4564, 1990). Sequences involved in this process are not known precisely. To further define the template requirements for transcriptional arrest within exon 1 of the human ADA gene, various ADA templates were constructed and their abilities to confer transcriptional arrest were determined following injection into Xenopus oocytes. The exon 1 transcriptional arrest signal functioned downstream of several RNA polymerase II promoters and an RNA polymerase III promoter, implying that the transcriptional arrest site in exon 1 of the ADA gene is promoter independent. We identified a 43 -bp DNA fragment which functions as a transcriptional arrest signal. Additional studies showed that the transcriptional arrest site functioned only in the naturally occurring orientation. Therefore, we have identified a 43 -bp DNA fragment which functions as a transcriptional arrest signal in an orientation-dependent and promoter-independent manner. On the basis of our findings, we hypothesize that tissue-specific expression of the ADA gene is governed by factors that function as antiterminators to promote <b>transcriptional</b> <b>readthrough</b> of the exon 1 transcriptional arrest site...|$|E

The vancomycin dependence of strain BM 4660 was due to mutation P 175 L, which suppressed {{the activity of the}} host Ddl d-Ala:d-Ala ligase. Reversion to resistance in strain BM 4661 was due to a G-to-C transversion in the transcription terminator of the vanRSB operon that lowered the free energy of pairing from − 13. 08 to − 6. 65 kcal/mol, leading to low-level constitutive expression of the resistance genes from the PRB promoter, as indicated by analysis of peptidoglycan precursors and of VanXB d,d-dipeptidase activity. Transcription of the resistance genes, studied by Northern hybridization and reverse transcription, initiated from the PYB resistance promoter, was inducible in strains BM 4659 and BM 4660, whereas it started from the PRB regulatory promoter in strain BM 4661, where it was superinducible. Strain BM 4661 provides the first example of reversion to vancomycin resistance of a VanB-type dependent strain not due to a compensatory mutation in the ddl or vanSB gene.

The DegS-DegU two-component system is part of the network involved in the regulation of postexponential responses, such as competence development, the production of exoenzymes, and motility. The degU 32 (Hy) mutation extends the half-life of the phosphorylated form of DegU (DegU-P); this in turn increases the production of alkaline protease, levan-sucrase, and other exoenzymes and inhibits motility and the production of flagella. The expression of the flagellum-specific sigma factor SigD, of the flagellin gene hag, and of the fla-che operon is strongly reduced in a degU 32 (Hy) genetic background. To investigate the mechanism of action of DegU-P on motility, we isolated mutants of degU 32 (Hy) that completely suppressed the motility deficiency. The mutations were genetically mapped and characterized by PCR and sequencing. Most of the mutations were found to delete a transcriptional termination signal upstream of the main flagellar operon, fla-che, thus allowing <b>transcriptional</b> <b>readthrough</b> from the cod operon. Two additional mutations improved the σA-dependent promoter sequence of the fla-che operon. Using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay, we have demonstrated that purified DegU binds specifically to the PA promoter region of the fla-che operon. The data suggest that DegU represses transcription of the fla-che operon, and they indicate a central role of the operon in regulating the synthesis and assembly of flagella...|$|E

The gene complementing the s 138 mutation {{was found to}} be identical to the S. cerevisiae SPT 4 gene. The s 138 mutation is a missense mutation in the second of four conserved cysteine residues positioned similarly to those of zinc finger proteins, and we henceforth refer to the mutation of spt 4 - 138. Both spt 4 - 138 and spt 4 delta strains missegregate a chromosome fragment at the permissive temperature, are temperature sensitive for growth at 37 degrees C, and upon a shift to the nonpermissive temperature show an accumulation of large budded cells, each with a nucleus. Previous studies suggest that Spt 4 p functions in a complex with Spt 5 p and Spt 6 p, and we determined that spt 6 - 140 also causes missegregation of a chromosome fragment. Double mutants carrying spt 4 delta 2 ::HIS 3 and kinetochore mutation ndc 10 - 42 or ctf 13 - 30 show a synthetic conditional phenotype. Both spt 4 - 138 and spt 4 delta strains exhibit synergistic chromosome instability in combination with CEN DNA mutations and show in vitro defects in microtubule binding to minichromosomes. These results indicate that Spt 4 p plays a role in chromosome segregation. The results of in vivo genetic interactions with mutations in kinetochore proteins and CEN DNA and of in vitro biochemical assays suggest that Spt 4 p is important for kinetochore function...|$|E

Here, we examine the transcriptional organization of a ribonucleotide reductase operon (nrd) that has been invaded by an HNH family homing endonuclease, mobE. In Aeromonas hydrophila phage Aeh 1, mobE has inserted into the large-subunit gene (nrdA) of aerobic ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), splitting it into two smaller genes, nrdA-a and nrdA-b. This gene organization differs from that in phages T 4, T 6, RB 2, RB 3, RB 15, and LZ 7, where mobE is inserted in the nrdA-nrdB intergenic region. We present evidence that the expression of Aeh 1 mobE is regulated by transcriptional, posttranscriptional, and translational controls. An Aeh 1 -specific late promoter drives expression of mobE, but strikingly the mobE transcript is processed internally at an RNase E-like site. We also identified a putative stem-loop structure upstream of mobE that sequesters the mobE ribosome binding site, presumably acting to down regulate MobE translation. Moreover, our transcriptional analyses indicate that the surrounding nrd genes of phage Aeh 1 are expressed by a different strategy than are the corresponding phage T 4 genes and that <b>transcriptional</b> <b>readthrough</b> is the only mechanism by which the promoterless Aeh 1 nrdB gene is expressed. We suggest that the occurrence of multiple layers of control to limit the expression of mobE to late in the Aeh 1 infection cycle is an adaptation of Aeh 1 to reduce any effects on expression of the surrounding nrd genes early in phage infection when RNR function is critical...|$|E
40|$|The int gene of {{bacteriophage}} P 2 is {{the only}} viral gene necessary for the integration of P 2 into the Escherichia coli host chromosome. This gene is situated between the phage attachment site, attP, and the repressor C gene, and is cotranscribed with C from the P, promoter, towards attP. The Pc promoter is negatively controlled by the cox gene, {{which is the first}} gene of the early operon. In vitro recombination assays have indicated that in P 2 an overproduction of Int is deleterious to the integrative process. We report here that the level of int expression is affected by several different mechanisms after transcriptional initiation. First, a partial transcription termination signal located between the int and C genes reduces the <b>transcriptional</b> <b>readthrough</b> by about 30 %. Second, the ribosome binding site and AUG codon of the int gene are located in a putative stem-loop structure, which may inhibit the initiation of translation. The nip] mutation (a G to A substitution at the 22 nd coding nucleotide of int which results in an increased efficiency of excision) is shown to relieve this inhibition, possibly through the formation of an alternative mRNA secondary structure. However, the third and probably most important control of int expression in P 2 seems to be that of posttranscriptional autoregulation. The binding site of the Int protein on int gene mRNA is shown to extend into the ribosome binding site of int, supporting our earlier proposed model of competitive binding between Int and ribosomes. In the site-specific recombination system of P 2, integration i...|$|E
40|$|Gene 13 of {{bacteriophage}} P 22 is functionally {{equivalent to}} lambda lysis gene S. Gene S codes for two products, the polypeptides S 105 and S 107, produced from translational initiation {{events at the}} third and first codon, respectively. We {{have shown that the}} two polypeptides have opposing functions in lysis: S 105 is the lethal lysis effector, and S 107 acts as an inhibitor of lysis (U. Bläsi, K. Nam, D. Hartz, L. Gold, and R. Young, EMBO J. 11 : 3501 - 3510, 1989). Gene 13 has a 108 -codon reading frame and its product begins with a similar motif: Met- 1 -Lys- 2 -Lys- 3 -Met- 4. Here, we present in vivo and in vitro evidence for the expression of a 13 (108) and a 13 (105) product and show that the lambda lysis control mechanisms is evolutionarily conserved in phage P 22. In this case 13 (108), like S 107 in lambda, functions as the inhibitor of the lysis effector 13 (105). Although the DNA sequences upstream of the S and 13 gene starts showed less homology, the same structural characteristics, i. e., stem-loop structures immediately upstream and about 10 codons downstream of the start region, were present in both reading frames. Using in vitro mutagenesis and toeprinting, we show that the upstream stem-loop structures of genes 13 and S, containing the Shine-Dalgarno sequence for initiations at Met- 1, are interchangeable. Moreover, our data indicate that the stability of the secondary structures present in the translational initiation regions of genes S and 13 is set to create a particular ratio of initiation events at Met- 1 and Met- 3 or Met- 4. The ratio of effector to inhibitor was much higher in P 22 than in lambda. We propose that this reflects less <b>transcriptional</b> <b>readthrough</b> at the late terminator t(R) and suggests that the dual-start motif in genes 13 and S may be important for establishment of maintenance of the lysogenic state...|$|E
40|$|Bacteria {{have evolved}} diverse {{mechanisms}} to control gene expression {{at the level}} of transcription and translation. Transcriptional attenuation of the genes of bacterial operons allows control of the extent of <b>transcriptional</b> <b>readthrough</b> in response to environmental signals. In Bacillus species, the expression of genes of the pyr operon, responsible for pyrimidine biosynthesis, is controlled by the product of the first gene of the operon, PyrR. In response to the availability of the uridylate end-product of the pathway, PyrR binds to the elongating mRNA transcript of the operon, controlling the formation of alternate RNA stem-loop structures that terminate further transcription. By virtue of its sequence and structural fold, PyrR belongs to the phosphoribosyltransferase (PRT) class of proteins. Although the protein displays some PRTase activity at elevated pH, under physiological conditions the regulatory, RNA-binding function of PyrR appears to be its primary role. Understanding the molecular basis for the evolution of the regulatory role of PyrR has been the goal of this project. Crystal structures of Bacillus caldolyticus PyrR provide insights into how this regulatory role might be achieved. For the first time, complexes of PyrR with the nucleotides, uridine monophosphate (UMP) and guanosine monophosphate (GMP), and divalent magnesium were obtained. Although the binding of UMP was expected, the association of GMP was a novel finding. The PyrR-nucleotide complexes support a model for dual regulation of PyrR by pyrimidines and purines. Sedimentation velocity experiments suggest that the stoichiometry of PyrR-RNA complex formation is one RNA molecule to one PyrR dimer. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrate that UMP and GMP have opposite effects on RNA binding to the PyrR dimer. Initial crystals of the PyrR-RNA complex, grown in presence of magnesium and UMP, have been obtained. Based on the structural and biochemical data reported here, as well as precedents from other PRT and transcriptional antitermination proteins, a structural model for the PyrR-RNA complex, as well as the role of regulatory nucleotides, is proposed. Overall, the results with the B. caldolyticus PyrR have increased our understanding of the unique adaptation of a PRTase enzyme for a novel RNA-binding role. ...|$|E
40|$|Transcription {{elongation}} is {{an important}} regulatory step in the RNA polymerase II transcription cycle. Previous work from our laboratory and others strongly suggests that the Paf 1 complex interacts with and regulates the activity of RNA polymerase II during transcription elongation. Affinity purification of Paf 1 revealed that it exists in a complex in vivo with Ctr 9, Rtf 1, Cdc 73 and Leo 1 called the Paf 1 complex. To further investigate {{the function of the}} Paf 1 complex in vivo, we used a genetic approach to study the component Rtf 1 and microarray analyses to identify Ctr 9 -regulated genes. Null mutations in RTF 1 confer two phenotypes associated with defective transcription elongation, sensitivity to base analogs and the Spt- phenotype. To identify novel mutations in RTF 1, we performed a genetic screen for rtf 1 mutations that confer conditional mutant phenotypes. We identified three new rtf 1 missense mutations. To identify proteins that functionally interact with the Paf 1 complex, we performed a screen for multicopy suppressors of the rtf 1 mutations. This screen identified NAB 3 as a suppressor of rtf 1. Nab 3 interacts with the RNA polymerase II-associated hnRNP Nrd 1. Together, Nrd 1 and Nab 3 are required for efficient 3 '-end formation of certain nonpolyadenylated RNA polymerase II transcripts, including snoRNAs. Using assays to detect <b>transcriptional</b> <b>readthrough</b> of snoRNA genes, we have shown that deletion of certain Paf 1 complex members causes strong defects in snoRNA 3 '-end formation. By chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis, we have found that the Paf 1 complex and Nab 3 associate with snoRNA genes in vivo. In the second approach, expression analyses revealed a role for the Paf 1 complex in directly regulating the expression of certain genes that are not transcribed during growth in rich media. ChIP experiments indicated that the Paf 1 complex associates along the length of ARG 1 and with the promoter region of SER 3. Together, our results reinforce the idea that the Paf 1 complex is involved in the production of mRNAs and provide evidence that the Paf 1 complex also participates in snoRNA transcription and 3 '-end formation during RNA polymerase II transcription...|$|E
40|$|The M 2 gene of {{respiratory}} syncytial (RS) virus has two open reading frames (ORFs). ORF 1 encodes a 22 -kDa protein termed M 2 - 1. The M 2 - 1 protein contains a Cys 3 -His 1 motif (C-X 7 -C-X 5 -C-X 3 -H) near the amino terminus. This motif is conserved in all human, bovine, and ovine strains of RS virus. A similar motif {{found in the}} mammalian transcription factor Nup 475 {{has been shown to}} bind zinc. The M 2 - 1 protein of human RS virus functions as a transcription factor which increases polymerase processivity, and it enhances readthrough of intergenic junctions during RS virus transcription, thereby acting as a transcription antiterminator. The M 2 - 1 protein also interacts with the nucleocapsid protein. We examined the effects of mutations of cysteine and histidine residues predicted to coordinate zinc in the Cys 3 -His 1 motif on transcription antitermination and N protein binding. We found that mutating the predicted zinc-coordinating residues, the cysteine residues at amino acid positions 7 and 15 and the histidine residue at position 25, prevented M 2 - 1 from enhancing <b>transcriptional</b> <b>readthrough.</b> In contrast, mutations of amino acids within this motif not predicted to coordinate zinc had no effect. Mutations of the predicted zinc-coordinating residues in the Cys 3 -His 1 motif also prevented M 2 - 1 from interacting with the nucleocapsid protein. One mutation of a noncoordinating residue in the motif which did not affect readthrough during transcription, E 10 G, prevented interaction with the nucleocapsid protein. This suggests that M 2 - 1 does not require interaction with the nucleocapsid protein in order to function during transcription. Analysis of the M 2 - 1 protein in reducing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels revealed two major forms distinguished by their mobilities. The slower migrating form was shown to be phosphorylated, whereas the faster migrating form was not. Mutations in the Cys 3 -His 1 motif caused a change in distribution of the M 2 - 1 protein from the slower to the faster migrating form. The data presented here show that the Cys 3 -His 1 motif of M 2 - 1 is essential for maintaining the functional integrity of the protein...|$|E
40|$|The copia {{insertion}} {{responsible for}} the wa mutation is 3 ' to the white promotor {{and in the same}} transcriptional orientation as white. First, we have analyzed the effects of the w a copia insertion on levels of polyadenylated white transcripts and find large, developmentally programmed effects. Second, we have isolated and sequenced an LTR-excision event involving the copia insertion at wa. This represents the first documented case of an LTR-excision event in Drosophila. This single copia LTR has developmentally programmed effects on white transcript levels qualitatively similar to the intact copia element. Third, we have characterized the structures of white transcripts from wa. We find polyadenylated white transcripts apparently having 3 ' termini in or near the 3 ' LTR of the wa copia insertion, as has been reported in limited studies of wa transcription in adults by others. These earlier studies also revealed wa transcripts apparently corresponding to polyadenylated terminus formation in the 5 ' LTR of the copia transposon; however, our more detailed studies reveal that these transcripts probably have other origins and that little, if any, polyadenylated terminus formation for white transcripts occurs in the 5 ' LTR of the wa copia insertion. Moreover, we find no polyadenylated terminus formation for white transcripts occurring in the single LTR of the wa LTR-excision product. Fourth, we find that each of three mutant alleles at su(wa) produces elevated levels of several classes of RNAs apparently corresponding to <b>transcriptional</b> <b>readthrough</b> of the wa copia transposon. Elevated levels of one presumptive readthrough transcript were observed previously in one su(w a) 1 mutant strain. Fifth, we have confirmed the existence of a transcript initiated in the 3 ' LTR of the wa copia insertion and find the levels of this transcript to be strongly influenced by developmental stage and genetic background. Lastly, we have analyzed white transcripts produced by the whd 81 b 11 allele, which carries an insertion of copia in the opposite transcriptional orientation and in a different position than the wa copia insertion. In contrast to the wa copia insertion allele, the whd 81 b 11 allele produces polyadenylated white transcript levels very similar to the w+ case at the stages examined. Moreover, the whd 81 b 11 copia element apparently produced polyadenylated terminus formation in white transcripts and we observe no effect of the allelic state of su(wa) on apparent readthrough of this stop site. We discuss some possible implications of our results for the properties of retrotransposons as developmentally complex insertional mutagens and for the functional organization of the copia transcription unit...|$|E
40|$|Structure-function {{analysis}} of human Integrator subunit 4 Anupama Sataluri Advisor: Eric. J. Wagner, Ph. D. Uridine-rich small nuclear RNAs (U snRNA) are RNA Polymerase-II (RNAPII) transcripts that are ubiquitously expressed and {{are known to}} be essential for gene expression. snRNAs {{play a key role in}} mRNA splicing and in histone mRNA expression. Inaccurate snRNA biosynthesis can lead to diseases related to defective splicing and histone mRNA expression. Although the 3 ′ end formation mechanism and processing machinery of other RNAPII transcripts such as mRNA has been well studied, the mechanism of snRNA 3 ′ end processing has remained a mystery until the recent discovery of the machinery that mediates this process. In 2005, a complex of 14 subunits (the Integrator complex) associated with RNA Polymerase-II was discovered. The 14 subunits were annotated Integrator 1 - 14 based on their size. The subunits of this complex together were found to facilitate 3 ′ end processing of snRNA. Identification of the Integrator complex propelled research in the direction of understanding the events of snRNA 3 ’end processing. Recent studies from our lab confirmed that Integrator subunit (IntS) 9 and 11 together perform the endonucleolytic cleavage of the nascent snRNA 3 ′ end to generate mature snRNA. However, the role of other members of the Integrator complex remains elusive. Current research in our lab is focused on deciphering the role of each subunit within the Integrator complex This work specifically focuses on elucidating the role of human Integrator subunit 4 (IntS 4) and understanding how it facilitates the overall function of the complex. IntS 4 has structural similarity with a protein called “Symplekin”, which is part of the mRNA 3 ’end processing machinery. Symplekin has been thoroughly researched in recent years and structure-function correlation studies in the context of mRNA 3 ’end processing have reported a scaffold function for Symplekin due to the presence of HEAT repeat motifs in its N-terminus. Based upon the structural similarity between IntS 4 and Symplekin, we hypothesized that Integrator subunit 4 may be behaving as a Symplekin-like scaffold molecule that facilitates the interaction between other members of the Integrator Complex. To answer this question, the two important goals of this study were to: 1) identify the region of IntS 4, which is important for snRNA 3 ′ end processing and 2) determine binding partners of IntS 4 which promote its function as a scaffold. IntS 4 structurally consists of a highly conserved N-terminus with 8 HEAT repeats, followed by a nonconserved C- terminus. A series of siRNA resistant N and C-terminus deletion constructs as well as specific point mutants within its N-terminal HEAT repeats were generated for human IntS 4 and, utilizing a snRNA <b>transcriptional</b> <b>readthrough</b> GFP-reporter assay, we tested their ability to rescue misprocessing. This assay revealed a possible scaffold like property of IntS 4. To probe IntS 4 for interaction partners, we performed co-immunoprecipitation on nuclear extracts of IntS 4 expressing stable cell lines and identified IntS 3 and IntS 5 among other Integrator subunits to be binding partners which facilitate the scaffold like function of hIntS 4. These findings have established a critical role for IntS 4 in snRNA 3 ′ end processing, identified that both its N and C termini are essential for its function, and mapped putative interaction domains with other Integrator subunits...|$|E
