It is permissible to encode analog vertical interval information (such as vertical interval timecode or vertical interval <b>test</b> <b>signals)</b> without breaking the interface, but such usage is nonstandard (and ancillary data is the preferred means for transmitting metadata). Conversion of analog sync and burst signals into digital, however, is not recommended—and neither is necessary in the digital interface.|$|E

2500|$|The first British {{television}} broadcast {{was made by}} Baird Television's electromechanical system over the BBC radio transmitter in September 1929. Baird provided {{a limited amount of}} programming five days a week by 1930. During this time, Southampton earned the distinction of broadcasting the first-ever live television interview, which featured Peggy O'Neil, an actress and singer from Buffalo, New York. On August 22, 1932, BBC launched its own regular service using Baird's 30-line electromechanical system, continuing until September 11, 1935. On November 2, 1936 the BBC began broadcasting a dual-system service, alternating between Marconi-EMI's 405-line standard and Baird's improved 240-line standard, from Alexandra Palace in London, making the BBC Television Service (now BBC One) the UK's first regular high-definition television service. The government, on advice from a special advisory committee, decided that Marconi-EMI's electronic system gave the superior picture, and the Baird system was dropped in February 1937. TV broadcasts in London were on the air an average of four hours daily from 1936 to 1939. There were 12,000 to 15,000 receivers. Some sets in restaurants or bars might have 100 viewers for sport events (Dunlap, p56). The outbreak of the Second World War caused the BBC service to be abruptly suspended on September 1, 1939, at 12:35 pm, after a Mickey Mouse cartoon and <b>test</b> <b>signals</b> were broadcast, so that transmissions could not be used as a beacon to guide enemy aircraft to London. It resumed, again from Alexandra Palace on June 7, 1946 {{after the end of the}} war, began with a live programme that opened with the line [...] "Good afternoon everybody. How are you? Do you remember me, Jasmine Bligh?" [...] and was followed by the same Mickey Mouse cartoon broadcast on the last day before the war. At the end of 1947 there were 54,000 licensed television receivers, compared with 44,000 television sets in the United States at that time.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – ADC testing {{frequently}} {{confronts the}} problem of spectral purity of harmonic <b>test</b> <b>signal.</b> The majority of dynamic ADC test methods require <b>test</b> <b>signal</b> distortion at least 10 dB {{less than that of}} the tested ADC – the condition that cannot be practically fulfilled for testing up-to-date ADCs. More sophisticated approach to ADC testing applies the correction for <b>test</b> <b>signal</b> imperfections. In both cases <b>test</b> <b>signal</b> distortion has to be known – roughly in the first case and quite accurately in the second case. In this paper an easy method for the <b>testing</b> of <b>signal</b> spectral purity is proposed. Test signal passed by one of two simple analog filters is measured by a common ADC, whose nonlinearity is mathematically post-corrected. The results are compared with common approach applying notch filter and uncertainty analysis is performed. I...|$|R
