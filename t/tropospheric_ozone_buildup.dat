40|$|Abstract. The global {{three-dimensional}} Lagrangian chemistry-transport model STOCHEM {{has been}} used to follow the changes in the tropospheric distributions of the two major radiatively-active trace gases, methane and <b>tropospheric</b> <b>ozone,</b> following the emission of pulses of the short-lived <b>tropospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> precursor species, methane, carbon monoxide, NOx and hydrogen. The radiative impacts of NOx emissions were dependent on the location chosen for the emission pulse, whether at the surface or in the upper troposphere or whether in the northern or southern hemispheres. Global warming potentials were derived for each of the short-lived <b>tropospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> precursor species by integrating the methane and <b>tropospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> responses over a 100 -year time horizon. Indirect radiative forcing due to methane and <b>tropospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> changes appear to be significant for all of the <b>tropospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> precursor species studied. Whereas the radiative forcing from methane changes is likely to be dominated by methane emissions, that from <b>tropospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> changes is controlled by all the <b>tropospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> precursor gases, particularly NOx emissions.

The enhancements have a {{maximum ozone concentration}} of up to 130 ppbv and an ozone-enhanced layer depth of 10 km. We used Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer, advanced very high resolution radiometer satellite image, and back air trajectory to identify the source region and the transport pattern of <b>ozone.</b> The strong <b>tropospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> enhancements covered all of tropical Southeast Asia and subtropical south China. They were due to photochemical <b>ozone</b> <b>buildup</b> from the biomass burning emissions from the Indonesian fires. The ozone-rich air mass was transported to Hong Kong following the east Asia local Hadley circulation and an abnormal anticyclonic flow related to the E 1 Nifio phenomenon in the tropical western Pacific. A rough estimation of the radiative forcing due to the ozone enhancement was carried out for two cases in October and December in 1997 using a normalized <b>tropospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> radiative forcing parameter derived from the Unified Chemistry-Climate model [Mickley et al., 1999]. The ozone enhancements induced- 2 an additional radiative forcing of 0. 26 and 0. 48 Wm compared to the normal total forcing of 0. 48 and 0. 39 Wm- 2 in October and December over the Hong Kong region.

Its transport and chemistry can be influenced by weather, seasonal, or multiannual variability. Despite the importance of <b>tropospheric</b> <b>ozone,</b> it contributes only about 10 % of the total ozone loading in the atmosphere. Consequently, satellite instruments lose sensitivity below the stratospheric ozone peak, and provide little information about middle and lower <b>tropospheric</b> <b>ozone.</b> This talk will discuss recent modifications made to the satellite ozone data assimilation system at NASA's Data Assimilation Office (DAO) in order to provide better <b>tropospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> columns and profiles. We use a version of the system that assimilates only the data from the Solar Backscatter UltraViolet/ 2 (SBUV/ 2) instrument. The quality of the assimilated ozone in the tropical troposphere is evaluated by comparison with independent observations obtained from the Southern Hemispheric Additional Ozonesondes (SHADOZ) network. It is shown that the quality of ozone fields is sensitive to the winds used in the transport model. Increasing the vertical resolution of the model also has a beneficial impact. The assimilated ozone in the lower troposphere was substantially improved by inclusion of <b>tropospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> production, loss, and dry deposition rates from the Harvard GEOS-CHEM model. The mechanisms behind these results will be examined and the implications for our understanding of <b>tropospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> will be discussed...|$|R

The project builds on two main methodological steps. First, a feasibility study is based on twin numerical experiments, and aims to assess the interest of assimilating <b>tropospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> columns and profiles, to be provided by IASI, for analysing boundary layer ozone. Second, experiments will be performed to evaluate the improvement brought by assimilating IASI <b>tropospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> information: these experiments will be conducted using simulated data, obtained from the IASI instrument model, and with real IASI data when available. The project expects to demonstrate the feasibility of assimilating IASI <b>tropospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> measurements for boundary layer ozone analysis...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} several years, we have {{developed}} two new <b>tropospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> retrievals from the TOMS (Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer) satellite instrument that are of sufficient resolution to follow pollution episodes. The modified-residual technique uses v. 7 TOMS total ozone and is applicable to tropical regimes in which the wave-one pattern in total ozone is observed. The TOMS-direct method ('TDOT' = TOMS Direct Ozone in the Troposphere) represents a new algorithm that uses TOMS radiances directly to extract <b>tropospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> in regions of constant stratospheric ozone. It is not geographically restricted, using meteorological regimes {{as the basis for}} classifying TOMS radiances and for selecting appropriate comparison data. TDOT is useful where <b>tropospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> displays high mixing ratios and variability characteristic of pollution. Some of these episodes were observed downwind of Asian biomass burning during the TRACE-P (Transport and Atmospheric Chemical Evolution-Pacific) field experiment in March 2001. This paper features comparisons among TDOT <b>tropospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> column depth, integrated uv-DIAL measurements made from NASA's DC- 8, and ozonesonde data...|$|R

From the analysis, {{it is confirmed}} that winter and pre-monsoon <b>tropospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> are significantly correlated with the pre-monsoon and summer monsoon total rainfall, respectively, but surface temperature is poorly correlated with the pre-monsoon and monsoon rainfall. It is also concluded that the variation of winter and pre-monsoon <b>tropospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> concentration may play an important role to predict the pre-monsoon and the monsoon rainfall for a particular year over Gangetic West Bengal.

40|$|Light {{reflected}} or {{transmitted by}} a planetary atmosphere contains information about particles and molecules in the atmosphere. Therefore, accurate modeling of the radiation field {{may be used}} to retrieve information on atmospheric composition. In this paper, a multi-layer model for a vertically inhomogeneous atmosphere is implemented by using the doubling-adding method for a plane-parallel atmosphere. By studying the degree of linear polarization of the transmitted and reflected solar light in the Huggins bands, we find significant differences between <b>tropospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> and stratospheric ozone. The effects of <b>tropospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> change on the linear polarization are 10 times more than that of the same amount of stratospheric ozone change. We also show the aerosol effect on the linear polarization, but this effect is wavelength independent as compared to that caused by the <b>tropospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> change. The results provide a theoretical basis for the retrieval of <b>tropospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> from measurement of linear polarization of the scattered sunlight both from the ground and from a satellite...|$|R
