5|$|Gilroy {{spent several}} years trying <b>to</b> <b>write</b> a plot that would fit the setting, and experimented with conspiracies and murder mysteries as central story elements. Eventually, he decided to instead start by {{designing}} the characters, and attempted to create a standard literary hero character. Unable to create an interesting hero, he then envisioned an antihero as the lead character. Gilroy felt antiheros were a rarity in films, because they are difficult <b>to</b> <b>write,</b> and usually devolve into psychopaths; {{in an attempt to}} break from the stereotype, he thought of writing an antihero success story. Several films, including The King of Comedy (1983), To Die For (1995), and The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999), were used as research on how <b>to</b> <b>write</b> antiheroes.|$|E

5|$|The overall {{performance}} of an SSD {{is dependent upon}} a number of factors, including write amplification. Writing to a flash memory device takes longer than reading from it. An SSD generally uses multiple flash memory components connected in parallel to increase performance. If the SSD has a high write amplification, the controller will be required <b>to</b> <b>write</b> that many more times to the flash memory. This requires even more time <b>to</b> <b>write</b> {{the data from the}} host. An SSD with a low write amplification will not need <b>to</b> <b>write</b> as much data and can therefore be finished writing sooner than a drive with a high write amplification.|$|E

5000|$|It {{is evident}} that rules of priestly {{procedure}} must have accompanied {{the institution of the}} priesthood, and in the earliest of times, before writing was invented, these rules probably were transmitted orally. When writing was first employed in connection with them, it is likely that only some general directions, or some details deemed most important, were committed <b>to</b> <b>writing.</b> As time passed on the importance given <b>to</b> <b>written</b> law would lead the priesthood to commit {{more and more of the}} details <b>to</b> <b>writing.</b> Critical scholars assert that in addition to this, over time, variations of detail would develop, authority for which must be committed <b>to</b> <b>writing,</b> so that actual practise would become justified by law. One would, therefore, suppose beforehand that such a code would exhibit evidence of gradual growth.|$|R
40|$|AbstractProblem Statement: Writing is the {{expression}} of emotions, thoughts, wishes and plans in written form. Writing requires skill rather than knowledge. Skilful writing a process that necessitates hard work, reading, writing through drawing conclusions from reading texts, and years of practice. Development of the writing skill is possible through continuous and planned practice. This work should {{not be limited to}} the work done with the teacher or the Turkish language lessons. Writing essays, stories, anecdotes, poems etc. outside school work will help students <b>to</b> master their <b>writing</b> skills. For students to effectively express themselves in <b>writing,</b> they need <b>to</b> allocate time <b>to</b> <b>writing</b> every day. Aim of the Study: The aim {{of this study is to}} determine the relationship between attitudes <b>to</b> <b>writing</b> and time spent writing among 4 th and 5 th year primary education students. Method of the Study: Descriptive method was used in the study to identify trends in the situation. The study was conducted on 4 th and 5 th year students at primary education and the relationship between attitudes <b>to</b> <b>writing</b> and daily time spent writing was examined. Sampling: The study was conducted on 402 (208 girls, 194 boys) students in 4 th and 5 th years attending 7 primary education schools in İzmir/Buca. 51. 7 % of the participants were female and 48. 3 % were male. Stratified sampling method was used for determining the sample. Data Collection Instrument: To determine students’ attitudes <b>to</b> <b>writing,</b> an “Attitudes <b>to</b> <b>Writing</b> Scale” (AWS) was used. Information about the daily time that participants spend writing (stated in minutes as a unit of time) was obtained through the personal information form included in the scale. The daily writing work denotes the writing activities that students undertake outside school work in their free time. Data Analysis and Interpretation: As a result of the analyses, attitudes <b>to</b> <b>writing</b> were found <b>to</b> be a significant predictor of time allotted <b>to</b> <b>writing</b> (R 2 = 0. 30, p= 0. 00). According to the result obtained, it can be stated that there is a positive significant relationship at a medium between attitudes <b>to</b> <b>writing</b> and time allotted <b>to</b> <b>writing...</b>|$|R
