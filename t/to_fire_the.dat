5|$|To {{scare the}} council into giving him {{clearance}} <b>to</b> <b>fire</b> <b>the</b> Zeus cannon, Hein lowers {{part of the}} barrier shield protecting the city. Though Hein intended {{that only a few}} Phantoms enter, his plan goes awry and legions of Phantoms invade the entire city. Aki, Sid and the Deep Eyes attempt to reach Aki's spaceship, their means of escape, but Ryan, Neil and Jane are killed by Phantoms. Hein escapes and boards the Zeus space-station where he finally receives authorisation <b>to</b> <b>fire</b> <b>the</b> cannon.|$|E
5|$|Besieged {{forces would}} {{sometimes}} launch sorties {{in an attempt}} <b>to</b> <b>fire</b> <b>the</b> attackers' camps or equipment. When Hugh Capet besieged Laon in 986–987, his troops became drunk one night, and Duke Charles's men sallied forth and torched the camp, forcing Hugh to abandon the siege.|$|E

5|$|In 1955, the Aldermaston Pottery was {{established}} {{on the main}} street by studio potters Alan Caiger-Smith and Geoffrey Eastop. The pottery was renowned for tin-glazed and porcelain wares, which used scrap wood from the Village Farm woodyard <b>to</b> <b>fire</b> <b>the</b> kiln.|$|E
5|$|With {{the added}} missile {{capacity}} of the battleships in the 1980s came additional fire-support systems to launch and guide the ordnance. <b>To</b> <b>fire</b> <b>the</b> Harpoon anti-ship missiles, the battleships were equipped with the SWG-1 fire-control system, and <b>to</b> <b>fire</b> <b>the</b> Tomahawk missiles the battleships used either the SWG-2 or SWG-3 fire-control system. In addition to these offensive-weapon systems, the battleships were outfitted with the AN/SLQ-25 Nixie {{to be used as}} a lure against enemy torpedoes, an SLQ-32 electronic warfare system that can detect, jam, and deceive an opponent's radar and a Mark 36 SRBOC system to fire chaff rockets intended to confuse enemy missiles.|$|E
5|$|A snail {{does not}} have a dart <b>to</b> <b>fire</b> <b>the</b> very first time it mates, because the first mating is {{necessary}} to trigger the process of dart formation. Once a snail has mated, it fires a dart before some, but not all, subsequent matings. A snail often mates without having a dart to use, because it takes time to create a replacement dart. In the case of the garden snail Cornu aspersum, it takes a week for a new dart to form.|$|E
50|$|General Orellana ordered <b>the</b> musketeers <b>to</b> <b>fire</b> on <b>the</b> men {{who were}} {{directing}} the launches. At the same time, he ordered the artillery on the starboard side of his ship (<b>to</b> which <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> ship was coming) <b>to</b> continuously <b>fire</b> at <b>the</b> sides of the approaching vessel. <b>The</b> <b>fire</b> ship got badly battered and sank, bringing its crew and fireworks {{to the bottom of}} the sea.|$|R

5|$|At 04:40, HMAS Canberra {{recorded}} {{that the}} Japanese may have fired torpedoes at her. This {{may have been}} one of many false alarms throughout the night. However, M-21 had attempted to fire its two torpedoes, but failed because of damage to the bow either from HMAS Yandras ramming or depth charges, or a possible collision with USS Chicago, making it possible that M-21 attempted to attack the cruiser. The observer aboard Canberra may have seen bubbles from the compressed air released <b>to</b> <b>fire</b> <b>the</b> torpedoes.|$|E
5|$|By late {{afternoon}} Béxar {{was occupied by}} about 1,500 Mexican soldiers. When the Mexican troops raised a blood-red flag signifying no quarter, Travis responded with a blast from the Alamo's largest cannon. Believing that Travis had acted hastily, Bowie sent Jameson to meet with Santa Anna. Travis was angered that Bowie had acted unilaterally and sent his own representative, Captain Albert Martin. Both emissaries met with Colonel Juan Almonte and José Bartres. According to Almonte, the Texians asked for an honorable surrender but were informed that any surrender must be unconditional. On learning this, Bowie and Travis mutually agreed <b>to</b> <b>fire</b> <b>the</b> cannon again.|$|E
5|$|During a {{press conference}} on January 25, 1989, Metro Director Alan Gibbs {{confirmed}} that the granite had been quarried in South Africa and announced that an investigative report would be delivered to the Metro Council Transit Committee the following week. The announcement was met with calls from King County Councilman Ron Sims <b>to</b> <b>fire</b> <b>the</b> responsible Metro officials who knowingly allowed the purchase. Metro's ban on South African goods was stricter than the federal sanctions, which only prohibited importation of specific materials such as steel, coal, uranium and agricultural products, and was used by UMTA to threaten to pull its funding for the bus tunnel project.|$|E
50|$|The film {{contained}} {{film from}} a number of large authentic fires, a fire station, and firemen rushing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fires</b> and fighting <b>the</b> <b>fires.</b> No acknowledgment was given <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> service. <b>The</b> unnamed city was Los Angeles as it was filmed at Fire Station 27 in Hollywood..|$|R

5|$|In January, 1951, {{the student}} body of the Presbyterian McCormick Theological Seminary in Chicago {{sponsored}} Béla, Eva, Tibor and Robert Banathy as refugees to the United States. Bánáthy lived with his family at the Seminary, where he worked nights 60 hours a week shoveling coal <b>to</b> <b>fire</b> <b>the</b> Seminary furnace. At the same time, he was studying English from a book. He occasionally preached at nearby Hungarian churches. His wife found work as a machine operator and Tibor, their third son, entered American public school.|$|E
5|$|In {{individual}} Olympic competition, Heath won {{a silver}} medal in the 200-meter freestyle (1:49.10) behind Gross's world record-setting performance (1:47.44). He also placed fourth in the 100-meter freestyle event final (50.41); the outcome was controversial, however, because of a premature starter gun and a quick start by Gaines, the winner. Gaines' coach, Richard Quick, knew of starter Frank Silvestri's propensity <b>to</b> <b>fire</b> <b>the</b> starter gun almost immediately when the swimmers mounted the blocks. Gaines gained about a meter's head start on the competition; video of the event later confirmed that {{one or more of}} the swimmers had not been set when the starter gun fired.|$|E
5|$|In the 1770s, cannon {{operation}} {{worked as}} follows: each cannon would be manned by two gunners, six soldiers, and four officers of artillery. The right gunner was to prime the piece and load it with powder, {{and the left}} gunner would fetch the powder from the magazine and be ready <b>to</b> <b>fire</b> <b>the</b> cannon at the officer's command. On {{each side of the}} cannon, three soldiers stood, to ram and sponge the cannon, and hold the ladle. The second soldier on the left tasked with providing 50 bullets.|$|E

5|$|Sayid {{escapes from}} Rousseau's bunker {{while she is}} gone, {{grabbing}} a rifle, maps and notes she has made about the island. Rousseau finds him {{and they have a}} standoff; he tries <b>to</b> <b>fire</b> <b>the</b> rifle, but no bullet discharges. Rousseau says she removed the firing pin, and Robert, her former lover, made the same mistake before she killed him. She reveals that it was she who killed her team, aiming to stop the disease from reaching the outside world. Sayid talks Rousseau into letting him go, but, before leaving, asks about Alex. Rousseau says that Alex was her child. While trying to find his way back to camp, Sayid hears the whispering of which Rousseau had spoken.|$|E
5|$|Texians began {{crossing}} {{the river at}} about 7pm. Less {{than half of the}} men were mounted, slowing their progress as they tracked the Mexican soldiers. A thick fog rolled in around midnight, further delaying them. At around 3 am, Texians reached the new Mexican camp. A dog barked at their approach, alerting the Mexican soldiers, who began <b>to</b> <b>fire.</b> <b>The</b> noise caused one of the Texian horses to panic and throw his rider, who suffered a bloody nose. Moore and his men hid in the thick trees until dawn. As they waited, some of the Texians raided a nearby field and snacked on watermelon.|$|E
5|$|The tower's gun {{installations}} {{were intended}} {{to be used to}} deal with an external threat approaching from {{the far side of the}} river. The parapet of the roof was crenellated with nine wide embrasures, and the embrasures facing out across the river were constructed flush with the floor of the roof, giving the bombards plenty of room <b>to</b> <b>fire.</b> <b>The</b> embrasures facing away from the river, however, had sloping cills rather than open positions, and the windows in the tower facing towards the city were rectangular and relatively unprotected. The entrance to the tower itself was not fortified, as the tower was not expected to be defended from a direct attack by land.|$|E

5|$|To pack a muzzle-loading cannon, first {{gunpowder}} {{is poured}} down the bore. This {{is followed by}} a layer of wadding (often nothing more than paper), and then the cannonball itself. A certain amount of windage allows the ball to fit down the bore, though the greater the windage the less efficient the propulsion of the ball when the gunpowder is ignited. <b>To</b> <b>fire</b> <b>the</b> cannon, the fuse located in the vent is lit, quickly burning down to the gunpowder, which then explodes violently, propelling wadding and ball down the bore and out of the muzzle. A small portion of exploding gas also escapes through the vent, but this does not dramatically affect the total force exerted on the ball.|$|E
5|$|After unsuccessfully {{searching for}} a vocalist for nearly six months, Mustaine decided to handle the vocal duties himself, while also serving as the band's primary lyricist, main {{songwriter}} and co-lead and rhythm guitarist. Early in 1984, Megadeth recorded a three song demo engineered by Karat Faye, and {{on the strength of}} that demo, the band was asked to sign with the New York-based independent label Combat Records. Early in 1985, Megadeth was given $8,000 by Combat to record and produce its debut album. However, this proved not to be enough and the band was given a further $4,000. Instead, a majority of the budget was spent on drugs, alcohol, and food, forcing the group <b>to</b> <b>fire</b> <b>the</b> original producer and produce the record themselves. The album was successfully recorded at the Indigo Ranch Studios, in Malibu, California.|$|E
5|$|At 03:13, U-156 {{attacked}} the Texaco-owned tanker SS Arkansas which was berthed at Eagle Beach {{next to the}} Arend/Eagle Refinery. Just one of the torpedoes struck Arkansas and partially sank her but the damage was moderate and caused no casualties. Commander Hartenstein then steamed further around Aruba and directed his men {{to take to the}} deck guns and prepare for a naval bombardment of the large oil tank of the Lago Oil and Transport Company The crew of the 10.5 cm SK L/45 naval gun forgot to remove the tampion from the barrel, so when Hartenstein ordered them <b>to</b> <b>fire,</b> <b>the</b> gun blew up. Gunnery Officer Dietrich von dem Borne was wounded badly, one foot having been severed. His comrade and trigger man Heinrich Büssinger was badly wounded as well and died several hours after the attack. Hartenstein ordered the 3.7cm flak gun to continue the attack, causing only superficial damage.|$|E
