In January 2006, the synagogue's roof collapsed, and the building was demolished two months later.|$|E
25|$|After {{suffering}} from mental disorders for several years, Kiki committed suicide {{on the night}} of December 23, 1946, jumping out of a window of her fifth-floor apartment in the Stanhope Hotel of New York City and landing in a courtyard of the hotel. According to her companion, Lillian Turner, Kiki had been in poor health, depressed and nervous. Turner had just given Preston a glass of milk and then went into <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> apartment to read. When she heard no sounds coming from Kiki's bedroom, she entered it, only to find a window open and Kiki gone. Kiki's pajama-clad body was soon discovered in an areaway behind the hotel. Preston's mother, Helen Steele, was also living at the same hotel at the time. Today, Kiki's home on Lake Naivasha is inhabited by the 7th Earl of Enniskillen.|$|E

2500|$|The {{problem of}} a weak case against Ethel Rosenberg was solved just 10 days {{before the start of}} the trial when David and Ruth Greenglass were reinterviewed. They were persuaded to change their {{original}} stories. David had said that he'd passed the atomic data he'd collected to Julius on a New York street corner. Now he stated that he'd given this information to Julius in <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rosenberg's New York apartment and that Ethel, at Julius's request, had taken his notes and [...] "typed them up." [...] In her re-interview Ruth expanded on her husband's version: [...] "Julius then took the info into the bathroom and read it and when he came out he called Ethel and told her she had to type this info immediately... Ethel then sat down at the typewriter which she placed on a bridge table in the living room and proceeded to type the info which David had given to Julius." [...] As a result of this new testimony, all charges against Ruth were dropped.|$|E
2500|$|In this quirky dark comedy Santiago Morales (Manuel Rodriguez-Saenz) {{a former}} engineer, {{is unable to}} come to terms with the passing of his wife Viviana (Dalal Badr) who has died of cancer. Santiago rents a room in a house as he struggles to get his {{financial}} affairs from the marriage sorted out. He quickly becomes suicidal, obsessing over his late wife by watching videos of her on an iPad and building a shrine to her in his room. Santiago is very particular and keeps things neat, tidy, and organized which leads to clashes with his housemate/landlord Murray (Clinton Lee Pontes) who is a total slob and spends most of his time in his underwear in <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house surrounded by trash and clutter. Santiago discovers that Murray is actually a disgraced geneticist with too much time on his hands. Murray was a rising star in the cloning field until he was caught conducting illegal experiments and was fired. He is itching to get back in the saddle so together they devise a plan involving the other housemate, Laura (Freya Ravensbergen), to clone Santiago's dead wife and thereby bring her back to life.

2500|$|In February 1969, Burbank {{resident}} and former LAPD officer Paul S. Perveler {{was found guilty}} of murdering his wife, Cheryl, who was shot to death in her open convertible as she parked the vehicle in the carport of the Pervelers' Grismer Avenue apartment building. [...] In a case that had similarities to the 1944 film classic Double Indemnity, Perveler had taken out a $25,000 double-indemnity life insurance policy on Cheryl, whom he had married just seven weeks earlier. [...] Perveler and his girlfriend, Kristina Cromwell, were also convicted of the earlier December 1966 murder of Cromwell's husband, Marlin, who had been found shot to death in <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cromwell house in El Sereno, which had then been set on fire.

[...] Cromwell was paroled in 1976; Perveler remains imprisoned at Mule Creek State Prison in Ione, California as of April 2013.

There was nothing amiss in what he said or the way he said it, but Anne rather resented such a cool taking-for-granted in a complete stranger. Her replies were frosty, and as few as decency required. Nothing daunted, her companion talked on for several minutes, then excused himself and went away. Anne could have sworn there was a twinkle in his eye and it annoyed her. Who was the creature? There was something vaguely familiar about him but she was certain she had never seen him before.|$|E

60|$|Such was the Tilford Manor-house {{where the}} last {{survivors}} {{of the old and}} magnificent house of Loring still struggled hard to keep a footing and to hold off the monks and the lawyers from the few acres which were left to them. The mansion was a two-storied one, framed in heavy beams of wood, the interstices filled with rude blocks of stone. An outside staircase led up to several sleeping-rooms above. Below there were only two apartments, the smaller of which was the bower of the aged Lady Ermyntrude. The other was the hall, a very large room, which served as <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> family and as the common dining-room of themselves and of their little group of servants and retainers. The dwellings of these servants, the kitchens, the offices and the stables were all represented by a row of penthouses and sheds behind the main building. Here lived Charles the page, Peter the old falconer, Red Swire who had followed Nigel's grandfather to the Scottish wars, Weathercote the broken minstrel, John the cook, and other survivors of more prosperous days, who still clung to the old house as the barnacles to some wrecked and stranded vessel.|$|E
