50|$|The {{anesthetic}} and intoxicating {{effects of}} ether {{have made it}} a recreational drug. Diethyl ether in anesthetic dosage is an inhalant which {{has a long history}} of recreational use. One disadvantage is the high flammability, especially in conjunction with oxygen. One advantage is a well-defined margin between therapeutic and toxic doses, which means one would lose consciousness before dangerous levels of dissolved ether in blood would be reached. With a strong, dense smell, ether causes irritation to respiratory mucosa and is uncomfortable to breathe, and in overdose triggering salivation, vomiting, coughing or spasms. In concentrations of 3-5% in air, an anesthetic effect can slowly be achieved in 15-20 minutes of breathing approximately 15-20 ml of ether, depending on body weight and physical condition. Ether causes a very long excitation stage prior <b>to</b> <b>blacking</b> <b>out.</b>|$|R

In this work, we propose a novel head inpainting obfuscation technique.

We thus split the task into two sub-tasks: (1) facial landmark generation from image context (e. g. body pose) for seamless hypothesis of sensible head pose, and (2) facial landmark conditioned head inpainting. We verify that our inpainting method generates realistic person images, while achieving superior obfuscation performance against automatic person recognizers...|$|R
