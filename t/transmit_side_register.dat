40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} a multiple antenna broadcast scenario with multiple non-cooperative users {{under the assumption}} of imperfect channel state information. Under an instantaneous transmit power constraint, vector perturbation precoding requires that the users be continuously informed about the adaptive power scaling factor used at the <b>transmit</b> <b>side.</b> To overcome this limitation, we propose a new precoding scheme that uses a fixed power scaling and avoids trans-mitting when the available power {{is not sufficient to}} perform channel equalization at the <b>transmit</b> <b>side,</b> an event referred to as outage.

50|$|Error {{correction}} techniques {{are essential for}} satellite communications, because, due to satellite's limited power a {{signal to noise ratio}} at the receiver is usually rather poor.

For this reason, we discard {{the implementation of}} multi-band equalizers, and we focus on filters that equalize the channel on a per-subcarrier basis.

40|$|Orthogonal {{frequency}} division multiplexing (OFDM) is a spectrally efficient multicarrier modulation technique for high speed data transmission over multipath fading channels, but has low power efficiency.

30|$|A major {{prerequisite}} for SU- and MU-MIMO transmission schemes {{is the use}} of precoding mechanisms at the <b>transmit</b> <b>side.</b> In 3 GPP LTE/LTE Advanced, different codebooks have been defined depending on the number of transmit antenna ports, and they provide precoding support for simultaneous transmission of variable number of layers (data stream) to the same target UE [4 – 7, 13].|$|R
50|$|On the <b>transmit</b> <b>side,</b> {{the data}} link layer generates an {{incrementing}} sequence number for each outgoing TLP. It serves as a unique identification tag for each transmitted TLP, and is inserted into the header of the outgoing TLP. A 32-bit cyclic redundancy check code (known in this context as Link CRC or LCRC) is also appended {{to the end of}} each outgoing TLP.|$|R
30|$|Precoding {{techniques}} have gained extensive research {{interests in the}} literature due to their capability of achieving the ergodic capacity and improving link reliability for wireless communication over {{multiple input multiple output}} (MIMO) channels (see, e.g., [1] and the references therein). Under the assumption of full channel state information (CSI) at the <b>transmit</b> <b>side</b> {{as well as at the}} receive side, matrix theory, including several decomposition approaches, is often used as a basic tool to facilitate the precoder design and performance analysis for different types of communication scenarios. For instance, singular value decomposition (SVD) probably serves as a prevailing way to construct the capacity-achieving precoder for a single-user scenario by diagonalizing the MIMO channel matrix. To avoid introducing rather complicated bit loading strategies at the <b>transmit</b> <b>side,</b> the precoding scheme in [2] using geometric mean decomposition (GMD) [3, 4] and later the unitary channel decomposition (UCD) scheme [5] and the root-mean-square decomposition (RMSD) scheme [6] are successively proposed to achieve optimum bit error rate (BER) and channel throughput simultaneously.|$|R
30|$|In this section, we {{combined}} the BD and CLR techniques. To cancel the MUI, {{we took the}} similar design concept from BD and thus the MU-MIMO channel can be transformed into equivalent SU-MIMO channels. We assume that the channel information is perfectly known both at the <b>transmit</b> <b>side</b> and the receiving side. We remark that a performance study of the proposed scheme with imperfect channel information and limited feedback can be considered.|$|R
50|$|To have minimum ISI (Intersymbol interference), {{the overall}} {{response}} of transmit filter, channel response and receive filter has to satisfy Nyquist ISI criterion. Raised-cosine filter {{is the most}} popular filter response satisfying this criterion. Half of this filtering is done on the <b>transmit</b> <b>side</b> and half is done on the receive side. On the receive side, the channel response, if it can be accurately estimated, can also be taken into account so that the overall response is Raised-cosine filter.|$|R
30|$|In {{the first}} part of the paper (Section 2), we extend the water-filling {{strategy}} [11] to multiple receivers considering parallel multicast channels with perfect channel state information (CSI) at the <b>transmit</b> <b>side.</b> In this case, the extended water-filling strategy maximizes the common rate subject to a power constraint (inner loop) or minimizes the power subject to a common rate constraint (outer loop). Mathematical derivations show that the optimal power allocation can be found in closed form under multiple hypothesis testing [14, 17, 18].|$|R

Quality assessment systems that process both the distorted signal and the original one are referred to as full reference (FR). Instead, reduced reference (RR) systems only require a limited set of numerical features extracted from the original signal, paying the (reasonable) additional cost of <b>transmitting</b> <b>side</b> information to the video chain endpoint. No reference (NR) systems assess perceived quality without any information on the original signal [1, 2].|$|R

In Section 3.1, we address the optimum constellation design for the WL MMSE receiver by extending the results of [2] to the case of additive rotationally variant disturbance. In Section 3.2, we propose a suboptimum strategy based on the rhombic transformation of a given constellation. Such a strategy allows one to reduce both the computational complexity of the optimization procedure and the amount of information required at the <b>transmitting</b> <b>side</b> in order to adapt the constellation.|$|R
30|$|In {{the second}} strategy, each {{transmitter}} behaves altruistically by minimizing {{the power of}} interference they cause to unintended relays. The interference on the <b>transmit</b> <b>side</b> {{is also known as}} the leakage[21, 57, 58]. Specifically, each transmitter uses multiple-antenna techniques for nullifying its leakage signals, similar to zero-forcing (ZF) beamforming on the receive side. The implementation of the strategy requires that each transmitter has the CSI of the channels from itself to all the relays. Thus, it also allows for distributed implementation but with a larger amount of overhead than the MRT strategy.|$|R
