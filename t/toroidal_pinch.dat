40|$|In this Letter, the {{influence}} of the ""Coriolis drift"" on small scale instabilities in toroidal plasmas is shown to generate a <b>toroidal</b> momentum <b>pinch</b> velocity. Such a pinch results because the Coriolis drift generates a coupling between the density and temperature perturbations {{on the one hand and}} the perturbed parallel flow velocity on the other. A simple fluid model is used to highlight the physics mechanism and gyro-kinetic calculations are performed to accurately assess the magnitude of the pinch. The derived pinch velocity leads to a radial gradient of the toroidal velocity profile even in the absence of a torque on the plasma and is predicted to generate a peaking of the toroidal velocity profile similar to the peaking of the density profile. Finally, the pinch also affects the interpretation of current experiments. © 2007 The American Physical Society...|$|R

The experimental density (with no barrier) was used and kept fixed. The result was that barriers, or spinup, developed in all channels with profiles close to the experimental.

40|$|Abstract. The {{relaxation}} {{dynamics of}} a magnetized plasma {{system is a}} subject of fundamental importance in MHD – with applications ranging from laboratory plasma devices like the <b>Toroidal</b> Field <b>Pinch</b> and Spheromaks to astrophysical plasmas, stellar flaring activity and coronal heating. Taylor in 1974 proposed that the magnetic field in a plasma (of small but finite resistivity) relaxes to a minimum energy state, subject to the constraint that its total magnetic helicity is conserved (Woltjer 1958), such that the final magnetic field configuration is a constant α (linear) force-free field – where α is a quantity describing the twist in magnetic field lines. However, a clear signature of this mechanism in astrophysical plasmas remained undetected. Here we report observational detection of a relaxation process, similar to what Taylor (1974, 1986) envisaged, in the magnetic fields of flare-productive solar active regions. The implications of this result for magnetic reconnection and the coronal heating problem are discussed. 1.

5000|$|A reversed-field pinch (RFP) is {{a device}} {{used to produce}} and contain near-thermonuclear plasmas. It is a <b>toroidal</b> <b>pinch</b> which uses a unique {{magnetic}} field configuration as a scheme to magnetically confine a plasma, primarily to study magnetic fusion energy. Its magnetic geometry is somewhat {{different from that of}} the more common tokamak. As one moves out radially, the portion of the magnetic field pointing toroidally (see inset) reverses its direction, giving rise to the term [...] "reversed field". This configuration can be sustained with comparatively lower fields than that of a tokamak of similar power density. One of the disadvantages of this configuration is that it tends to be more susceptible to non-linear effects and turbulence. This makes it a perfect laboratory for non-ideal (resistive) magnetohydrodynamics. RFPs are also used in the study of astrophysical plasmas as they share many features.|$|E
40|$|The {{toroidal}} momentum transport in {{the presence}} of trapped electron mode microinstabilities in tokamak plasmas is studied by means of quasilinear gyrokinetic calculations. In particular, the role of the Coriolis drift in producing an inward convection of toroidal momentum is investigated. The Coriolis drift term has been implemented in the gyrokinetic code GS 2 [W. Dorland, Phys. Rev. Lett. 85, 5579 (2000) ] specifically for the completion of this work. A benchmark between the GS 2 implementation of the Coriolis drift and the implementations included in two other gyrokinetic codes is presented. The numerical calculations show that {{in the presence}} of trapped electron modes, despite of a weaker symmetry breaking of the eigenfunctions with respect to the case of ion temperature gradient modes, a <b>pinch</b> of <b>toroidal</b> momentum is produced in most conditions. The toroidal momentum viscosity is also computed, and found to be small as compared with the electron heat conductivity, but significantly larger than the ion heat conductivity. In addition, interesting differences are found in the dependence of the <b>toroidal</b> momentum <b>pinch</b> as a function of collisionality between trapped electron modes and ion temperature gradient modes. The results identify also parameter domains in which the pinch is predicted to be small, which are also of interest for comparisons with the experiments...|$|R
2500|$|Marshall Rosenbluth, {{recently}} arrived at Los Alamos, began a detailed theoretical {{study of the}} pinch concept. With his wife Arianna and Richard Garwin, he developed [...] "motor theory", or [...] "M-theory", published in 1954.

This suggested that the fast pinch concept {{would be more likely to}} succeed, as it was easier to produce larger currents in these devices.

40|$|Simulations of JET and AUG HS {{with the}} GLF 23 model {{show that the}} {{observed}} core confinement improvement can be partly explained by the beneficial s/q effect on the ITG driven transport while {{the effect of the}} ExB shear stabilisation is weaker than in H-mode plasmas. Strong stabilising effect of βe on the ITG turbulence has been found, but the transport reduction due to this effect can be limited by the onset of the KBM mode at high βe. The simulations of toroidal rotation in HS with the GLF 23 model give an indication of the <b>toroidal</b> momentum <b>pinch</b> (Pr< 1). Use of H-mode parameters in the GLF 23 and BgB models results in the over-peaking of the density profile while the temperatures are sufficiently accurately predicted. Based on the performed analysis a retuning of the BgB [7] and GLF 23 models which enables a more accurate prediction for the main heating phase of HS is suggested. An impact of the models modifications on the predictions for ITER HS is to be assessed. The current ramp up and ramp down [2] phases are satisfactorily predicted with the original Lmode version of the BgB model. During the main heating phase the pedestal height and width are in a good agreement with the EPED model [9].

50|$|A {{reversed}} field pinch {{is formed}} similarly to other <b>toroidal</b> <b>pinch</b> devices, by driving current through the plasma from an associated capacitor bank or other high-current power source. In a tokamak the toroidal field is much stronger than the poloidal field, but in an RFP it's just the opposite. In fact, in an RFP the externally applied toroidal field is switched off shortly after startup. The plasma in an RFP is also {{much closer to the}} wall than in a Tokamak. This permits a peculiar arrangement of the magnetic field lines, which will 'relax' into a new state such that the total magnetic energy in the plasma is minimized and the total magnetic helicity is conserved. The relaxed state, called a Taylor state, is marked by a peculiar arrangement of magnetic field lines where the toroidal magnetic field at the edge spontaneously reverses direction.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} weak {{dissipation}} on drift orbits {{has been investigated}} making use of a simple mapping model in a helical magnetic field. It is found that, after many mapping iterations, any orbit tends to an attractor froming a vortex line even with very small dissipation. The convergence is faster for larger dissipation,i. e., the number of iteration N to converge within a certain distance from the attractor is inversely proportional {{to the amount of}} the dissipation. Altougth the behavior of orbits completely change, the basic stability characteristics of the system does not change, i. e., the coordinate of the attractors are determined by the stable fixed points in the area preserving system because the dissipation is very small. Since wide range of orbits are concentrated arround the attractors after many <b>toroidal</b> circulations, a <b>pinch</b> effect is created by a small dissipation. Application of this pinch effect to fusion plasmas is disscussed. ...|$|R
40|$|An {{heuristic}} {{analysis of the}} pre-cusp phase of the present Tormac experiments has been carried out. The immediate goal has been to identify the requirements for producing a stabilized pinch in Tormac V qualitatively {{similar to that in}} Tormac IV. Concurrently, V has been modified to increase the pinch current and experimental investigation is underway. The experimental procedure is to introduce a toroidal magnetic field into the gas filled chamber. A toroidal electric field is then induced which ionizes the gas; the associated <b>toroidal</b> current simultaneously <b>pinches</b> the discharge. Uncertainty about the details of this process, in particular, about the amount of toroidal flux trapped within the pinch, has led to a one parameter theory. Speculation about the plasma heating mechanism and the subsequent interaction of pinch and cusp is left aside at this time. The chambers are basically rectangular in cross section; but, for simplicity, an equivalent radius is used. Although the experimental discharge probably evolves into a diffuse pinch, a cylindrical sheet pinch model is studied as a first step in understanding the qualitative features of the experiment. A simple Alfven scaling for instability time scales, appropriate for the previous weak pinch and considered {{in the design of the}} ringing frequency of the induction circuit is now supplemented by the sheet pinch model. If merited, a more quantitative numerical diffuse pinch model can be developed later. It should be pointed out that cusp confinement, the central problem of the Tormac program, is not addressed here. The goal is simply to identify the requirements for reproducing this particular phase of the Tormac IV experiment...|$|R

A {{very high}} poloidal beta was {{achieved}} by the Pulsed Poloidal Current Drive (PPCD) in <b>Toroidal</b> <b>Pinch</b> Experiment-RX (TPE-RX, which had been operated to March 2007 from April 1998). The electron density and temperature increased, hence, the poloidal beta was improved to 30 % from 5 % during PPCD (poloidal beta is almost equal to total beta in the reversed-field pinch). D-alpha emission decreased during the PPCD and {{the ratio of the}} total number of particles to the D-alpha emission increased ten-fold at the end of the PPCD indicating the considerable improvement of the particle confinement time. Fast magnetic fluctuation levels in the edge region of TPE-RX were measured using a newly developed complex edge probe installed inside vacuum vessel and sensitive to fast magnetic fluctuation. During the PPCD operation, the magnetic fluctuation associated with the dynamo effect is reduced, and improved confinement is reached, which results in this high beta value. Unique neutral beam injection (NBI) system suitable for the RFP machine was developed to control plasma parameters. In the case of high power NB injection to the improved confinement plasma which was attained by PPCD operation with an ice pellet injection, the meaningful increments in the soft X-ray signal and the plasma current were found. 1...|$|E
40|$|We present two-dimensional, cylindrically {{symmetric}} {{simulations of}} hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wide-angle winds interacting with a collapsing environment. These simulations have direct relevance to young stellar objects (YSOs). The results {{may also be}} of use {{in the study of}} collimated outflows from proto-planetary and planetary nebulae. We study a range of wind configurations consistent with asymptotic MHD wind collimation. The degree of collimation is parameterized by the ratio of the wind density at the pole to that of the equator. We find that a toroidal magnetic field can have a significant influence on the resulting outflow, giving rise to a very dense, jet-like flow in the post-shock region. The properties of the flow in this region are similar to the asymptotic state of a collimated MHD wind. We conclude that wide-angle MHD winds are quite likely capable of driving molecular outflows. Due to difficulty in treating MHD winds ab-initio in simulations we choose magnetic field strengths in the wind consistent slow magnetic rotators. While MHD launched winds will be in the fast rotator regime we discuss how our results, which rely on <b>toroidal</b> <b>pinch</b> effects, will hold for stronger field strengths.

40|$|At {{this first}} {{opportunity}} for open scientific dis-cussions {{on this subject}} we look forward with eagerness to exchanging experiences with others and hearing of the courses taken towards the common goal in the various laboratories of the world. Early Development At this laboratory, the peculiarly intriguing {{nature of the problem}} and the admirable consequences of its solution have long been recognized. Lively discussions of such matters as plasma drift in a torus and its effect on achieving a laboratory thermonuclear reac-tion occurred between Fermi, Kerst, Landshoff, Teller, R. R. Wilson and the writer in 1946, and an unsuccessful search for neutrons from colliding Munroe jets of metal deuterides was made at about the same time, based on an earlier paper by Ulam and the writer. When the subject was reopened in 1951, the <b>toroidal</b> <b>pinch</b> (as proposed, with a superimposed Bz field, by the writer in 1948) was selected as the confinement geometry for initial study and it passed through the usual vicissitudes and modifications— instability, linear dynamic pinches (Columbus), rf pinches, so called Bz and wall stabilized pinches; while parallel speculations and experimental forays were made into cusped geometries (Picket Fence), spinning plasmas, shocks in axial and convergent geometries and magnetic mirrors. Our ideas and plans have undergone profound changes during the last seven years and are in process of undergoing another. As little as half a year ago, the chief obstacle to the achievement of a thermonuclear reaction via the stabilized pinch appeared to be contamination of the plasma by foreign atoms sputtered or evaporated off the walls. Doubtless this particular obstacle is still there, but in the meantime a crevasse has opened at our feet, in the form of our new experimental observa-tions of high energy losses from the pinched plasma.
