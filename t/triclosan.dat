5|$|Enzyme inhibitors {{are found}} in nature and are also {{designed}} and produced as part of pharmacology and biochemistry. Natural poisons are often enzyme inhibitors that have evolved to defend a plant or animal against predators. These natural toxins include {{some of the most}} poisonous compounds known. Artificial inhibitors are often used as drugs, but can also be insecticides such as malathion, herbicides such as glyphosate, or disinfectants such as <b>triclosan.</b> Other artificial enzyme inhibitors block acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme which breaks down acetylcholine, and are used as nerve agents in chemical warfare.|$|E
25|$|The {{duration}} of <b>triclosan</b> in personal product use is relatively short. Upon disposal, <b>triclosan</b> {{is sent to}} municipal sewage treatment plants, where about 97-98% of <b>triclosan</b> is removed. Studies show that substantial quantities of <b>triclosan</b> (170,000 – 970,000kg/yr) can break through wastewater treatment plants and damage algae on surface waters. In a study on effluent from wastewater treatment facilities, approximately 75% of triclocarban was present in sludge. This poses a potential environmental and ecological hazard, particularly for aquatic systems. The volume of <b>triclosan</b> re-entering the environment in sewage sludge after initial successful capture from wastewater is 44,000 ± 60,000kg/yr. <b>Triclosan</b> can attach to other substances suspended in aquatic environments, which potentially endangers marine organisms and may lead to further bioaccumulation. Ozone {{is considered to be}} an effective tool for removing <b>triclosan</b> during sewage treatment. As little <b>triclosan</b> is released through plastic and textile household consumer products, these are not considered to be major sources of <b>triclosan</b> contamination.|$|E
25|$|<b>Triclosan</b> was not {{approved}} by the European Commission as an active substance for use in biocidal products for product-type 1 in January 2016. In the United States, manufacturers of products containing <b>triclosan</b> must indicate its presence on the label. In Europe, <b>triclosan</b> is regulated as a cosmetic preservative and must be listed on the label. Usage of <b>triclosan</b> in cosmetic products was restricted by the EU commission in 2014.|$|E
25|$|<b>Triclosan</b> {{has been}} {{associated}} with a higher risk of food allergy. This may be because exposure to bacteria reduces allergies, as predicted by the hygiene hypothesis, and not caused by toxicology of <b>triclosan</b> itself. This effect may also occur with chlorhexidine gluconate and PCMX, among other antibacterial agents. Other studies have linked <b>triclosan</b> to allergic contact dermatitis in some individuals. Additionally, <b>triclosan</b> concentrations have been associated with allergic sensitization, especially inhalant and seasonal allergens, rather than food allergens.|$|E
25|$|<b>Triclosan,</b> an {{antibacterial}} agent, is {{a common}} toothpaste ingredient in the United Kingdom. <b>Triclosan</b> or zinc chloride prevent gingivitis and, according to the American Dental Association, helps reduce tartar and bad breath. A 2006 review of clinical research concluded there was evidence for the effectiveness of 0.30% <b>triclosan</b> in reducing plaque and gingivitis.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, the Natural Resources Defense Council {{forced the}} FDA to review <b>triclosan</b> after suing {{them for their}} inaction. Because the FDA {{prohibited}} hexachlorophene, a compound similar to <b>triclosan,</b> Halden and others argued that the FDA should also ban <b>triclosan.</b> On December 17, 2013, the FDA issued a draft rule revoking the Generally recognized as safe status of <b>triclosan</b> as an ingredient in hand wash products, citing {{the need for additional}} studies of its potential endrocrine and developmental effects; impact on bacterial resistance; and carcinogenic potential.|$|E
25|$|In healthcare, <b>triclosan</b> {{is used in}} {{surgical}} scrubs {{and hand}} washes. Use in surgical units is effective with a minimum contact time of approximately two minutes. More recently, showering with 2% <b>triclosan</b> has become a recommended regimen in surgical units for the decolonization of patients whose skin carries methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). <b>Triclosan</b> is also used in the coatings for some surgical sutures.|$|E
25|$|<b>Triclosan</b> favors {{anaerobic}} conditions which is typical in soil and sediment. The antimicrobial properties of <b>Triclosan</b> {{are resistant to}} anaerobic degradation which is the main contributor to its persistence in the environment.|$|E
25|$|Some {{studies suggest}} that {{antimicrobial}} hand soaps containing <b>triclosan</b> provide a slightly greater bacterial reduction on the hands compared to plain soap. , the US FDA had found clear benefit to health for some consumer products containing <b>triclosan,</b> but not in others; for example the FDA had no evidence that <b>triclosan</b> in antibacterial soaps and body washes provides any benefit over washing with regular soap and water.|$|E
25|$|<b>Triclosan</b> can be {{synthesized}} {{through a}} three-step process starting with 1-(2-hydroxyethyl)pyrrolidin-2-one. The 1-(2-hydroxyethyl)pyrrolidin-2-one is dehydrated with either zinc or calcium oxide into 1-vinylpyrrolidin-2-one. Then, 1-vinylpyrrolidin-2-one can be reacted with 5-chloro-2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)phenyl acrylate in n-heptane to form <b>triclosan.</b>|$|E
25|$|At high concentrations, <b>triclosan</b> {{acts as a}} biocide with {{multiple}} cytoplasmic and membrane targets. However, at the lower concentrations seen in commercial products, <b>triclosan</b> appears bacteriostatic, and it targets bacteria primarily by inhibiting fatty acid synthesis.|$|E
25|$|Once absorbed, <b>triclosan</b> is metabolized {{by humans}} {{primarily}} through conjugation reactions into glucuronide and sulfate conjugates that are excreted in feces and urine. Pharmacokinetic studies demonstrate that <b>triclosan</b> sulfate and glucuronide may be {{formed in the}} liver at approximately equal rates at the environmentally relevant concentration of 1 to 5 microMolar. When concentrations of <b>triclosan</b> are below 1 microMolar, sulfonation {{is expected to be}} the major metabolic pathway for elimination.|$|E
25|$|This organic {{compound}} {{is a white}} powdered solid with a slight aromatic, phenolic odor. Categorized as a polychloro phenoxy phenol, <b>triclosan</b> is a chlorinated aromatic compound that has functional groups representative of both ethers and phenols. Phenols often demonstrate antibacterial properties. <b>Triclosan</b> is soluble in ethanol, methanol, diethyl ether, and strongly basic solutions such as a 1M sodium hydroxide solution, but only slightly soluble in water. <b>Triclosan</b> can be synthesized from 2,4-dichlorophenol.|$|E
25|$|<b>Triclosan</b> {{has been}} {{employed}} as a selective agent in molecular cloning. A bacterial host transformed by a plasmid harboring a triclosan-resistant mutant FabI gene (mFabI) as a selectable marker can grow in presence of high dose of <b>triclosan</b> in growth media.|$|E
25|$|While {{studies using}} {{semi-permeable}} membrane devices {{have found that}} <b>triclosan</b> does not strongly bioaccumulate, methyl-triclosan is comparatively more stable and lipophilic and thus poses {{a higher risk of}} bioaccumulation. The ability of <b>triclosan</b> to bioaccumulate is affected by its ionization state in different environmental conditions.|$|E
25|$|Concerns on {{the health}} effects of <b>triclosan</b> have been raised after it was {{detected}} in human breast milk, blood, and urine samples. While no human data exists, studies on rats have shown that <b>triclosan</b> exposure modulates estrogen-dependent responses. There have been many studies performed over the years both in vivo and in vitro, in male and female fish and rats and they all support the conclusion that <b>triclosan</b> possesses (anti)estrogenic and (anti)androgenic properties depending on species, tissues, and cell types.|$|E
25|$|During {{wastewater}} treatment, {{a portion}} of <b>triclosan</b> is degraded, while the remaining adsorbs to sewage sludge or exits the plant as effluent. In the environment, <b>triclosan</b> may be degraded by microorganisms or react with sunlight, forming other compounds, which include chlorophenols and dioxins.|$|E
25|$|Global warming may {{increase}} uptake {{and effects of}} <b>triclosan</b> in aquatic organisms.|$|E
25|$|Humans {{are exposed}} to <b>triclosan</b> through skin {{absorption}} when washing hands or in the shower, brushing teeth, using mouthwash or doing dishes, and through ingestion when swallowed. When <b>triclosan</b> is released into the environment, additional exposure to the chemical is possible through ingesting plants grown in soil treated with sewage sludge, or eating fish exposed to it.|$|E
25|$|<b>Triclosan</b> {{can react}} {{with the free}} {{chlorine}} in chlorinated tap water to produce lesser amounts of other compounds, such as 2,4-dichlorophenol. Some of these intermediates convert into dioxins upon exposure to UV radiation (from the sun or other sources). The dioxins that can form from <b>triclosan</b> are {{not considered to be}} congeners of toxicologic concern for mammals, birds and fish.|$|E
25|$|The United States Pharmacopeia {{formulary}} {{has published}} a monograph for <b>triclosan</b> that sets purity standards.|$|E
25|$|In Canada, <b>triclosan</b> {{is allowed}} in cosmetics, though FDA’s recent {{announcement}} has prompted Health Canada spokeswoman Maryse Durette to state {{in an e-mail}} to Toronto newspaper The Globe and Mail that, “the government will publish a final assessment of the safety of <b>triclosan</b> ‘in the near future’ and take further action ‘if warranted.’” Health Canada maintains a Cosmetic Ingredient Hotlist, including hundreds of chemicals that are not allowed or whose use is restricted in cosmetics. The list states that <b>triclosan</b> is currently allowed in cosmetics up to 0.3%, and 0.03% in mouthwashes and other oral products with required warnings to avoid swallowing and not for use in {{children under the age of}} 12.|$|E
25|$|An {{article from}} the American Society of Agronomy {{refers to a}} study done by Monica Mendez et al., in which the {{researchers}} irrigated plants with water contaminated with <b>triclosan</b> and months later found it in all edible parts of tomato and onion plants. <b>Triclosan</b> is found to kill {{a wide spectrum of}} bacteria, and the researchers are also concerned about the effect it has on the beneficial bacteria in soil.|$|E
25|$|Nonorganic {{antibiotics}} and organic biocides are effective alternatives to <b>triclosan,</b> such as silver and copper ions and nanoparticles.|$|E
25|$|Reports have {{suggested}} <b>triclosan,</b> an active ingredient in {{many kinds of}} toothpastes, can combine with chlorine in tap water to form chloroform, which the United States Environmental Protection Agency classifies as a probable human carcinogen. An animal study revealed the chemical might modify hormone regulation, and many other lab researches proved bacteria {{might be able to}} develop resistance to <b>triclosan</b> in a way which can help them to resist antibiotics also.|$|E
25|$|<b>Triclosan</b> is {{toxic to}} aquatic {{bacteria}} at levels {{found in the}} environment. It is highly toxic to various types of algae and {{has the potential to}} affect the structure of algal communities, particularly immediately downstream of effluents from wastewater treatment facilities that treat household wastewaters. <b>Triclosan</b> has been observed in multiple organisms, including algae, aquatic blackworms, fish, and dolphins. It has also been found in land animals including earthworms and species higher up the food chain.|$|E
25|$|Concern {{pertains}} to the potential for cross-resistance or co-resistance to other antimicrobials. Numerous studies have been performed {{and there have been}} results indicating that the use of biocidal agents, such as <b>triclosan,</b> can cause cross-resistance. Results from a study published in The American Journal of Infection Control showed that exposure to <b>triclosan</b> was associated with a high risk of developing resistance and cross-resistance in Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. This was not observed with exposure to chlorhexidine or a hydrogen peroxide-based agent (during the conditions in said study).|$|E
25|$|To make {{antibacterial}} soap, compounds such as <b>triclosan</b> or triclocarban can be added. There is {{some concern}} {{that use of}} antibacterial soaps and other products might encourage antibiotic resistance in microorganisms.|$|E
25|$|In the US, <b>triclosan</b> is {{regulated}} as a pesticide by EPA {{and as a}} drug by FDA. EPA generally regulates uses on solid surfaces, and FDA regulations cover uses in personal care products.|$|E
25|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{analysis from}} the University of Oregon School of Public Health indicated that plain soaps are {{as effective as}} consumer-grade anti-bacterial soaps containing <b>triclosan</b> in preventing illness and removing bacteria from the hands.|$|E
25|$|In 2011 {{the company}} chose {{to retain the}} use of the {{antibacterial}} agent <b>triclosan</b> in its market-leading Total toothpaste range, despite withdrawing it from several other product ranges, following concerns about triclosan's impact on health and the environment.|$|E
25|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{analysis in}} 2007 from the University of Michigan School of Public Health indicated that plain soaps {{are just as}} effective as consumer-grade antibacterial soaps with <b>triclosan</b> in preventing illness and removing bacteria from the hands.|$|E
25|$|<b>Triclosan</b> (TCS) was {{patented}} in 1964 by Swiss company Ciba-Geigy. The earliest known safety testing {{began in}} 1968. It was introduced the next year, mainly {{for use in}} hospitals, and was in worldwide production and use by the early 1970s.|$|E
25|$|<b>Triclosan</b> {{has been}} found to be a weak {{endocrine}} disruptor, though the relevance of this to humans is uncertain. The compound {{has been found}} to bind with low affinity to both the androgen receptor and the estrogen receptor, where both agonistic and antagonistic responses have been observed.|$|E
25|$|<b>Triclosan</b> {{was used}} as a {{hospital}} scrub in the 1970s. Since then, it has expanded commercially and is now a common ingredient in soaps (0.10-1.00%), shampoos, deodorants, toothpastes, mouthwashes, cleaning supplies, and pesticides. It is part of consumer products, including kitchen utensils, toys, bedding, socks, and trash bags.|$|E
25|$|In {{an article}} from May 2015 {{on the current}} status of <b>triclosan,</b> Gurpreet Singh Dhillon and colleagues cite various studies that report “emerging health {{concerns}} related to the use of TCS such as microbial resistance, dermal irritations, endocrine disruption, higher incidence of allergies, altered thyroid hormone metabolism and tumors development due to TCS and its by-products”.|$|E
