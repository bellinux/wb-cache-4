5|$|During his pontificate Clement strove diplomatically {{to bring}} Western European nations <b>to</b> <b>defense</b> of Crete. The Ottomans were {{planning}} to advance on the Venetian owned capital of the Island at Candia. He intervened in the War of Devolution and helped negotiate a peace, which increased the likelihood that Spain and France would both aid Crete. The French initially sent a small force to aid Crete in 1668, before increasing their troop commitment in 1669. This did affect {{the outcome of the}} Ottoman advance, and they captured Candia in September 1669.|$|E
5|$|In April 1943, Philipp was {{transferred}} <b>to</b> <b>Defense</b> of the Reich duties as Geschwaderkommodore (wing commander) of Jagdgeschwader 1 (JG1—1st Fighter Wing), flying high altitude interception operations against the USAAF Eighth Air Force over the North Sea and northern Germany. He claimed his 204th victory on 2 May, and his 205th on 18 May before falling ill with appendicitis. This required hospitalization in Meissen. On 4 October 1943, Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring {{is said to}} have issued the following instructions after another attack by the Eighth Air Force.|$|E
5|$|In June 1776, American Patriot {{officers}} Henry Knox, Nathanael Greene, William Heath, and Israel Putnam {{examined the}} terrain on which Fort Washington would be located; {{they agreed that}} if the fort was properly fortified, it would be practically impossible to take. Later in June, the Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army, George Washington, inspected the location and determined that the area was the key <b>to</b> <b>defense</b> of the lower Hudson. Shortly after Washington's survey, troops from Pennsylvania began construction on the fort {{under the supervision of}} Rufus Putnam.|$|E

5|$|Klemana Schuetz was {{identified}} as the bomber by Franz Mayhoff, a New York anarchist and fraudster, who claimed in an affidavit that Schuetz had once admitted throwing the Haymarket bomb. August Wagener, Mayhoff's attorney, sent a telegram from New York <b>to</b> <b>defense</b> attorney Captain William Black {{the day before the}} executions claiming knowledge of the bomber's identity. Black tried to delay the execution with this telegram but Governor Oglesby refused. It was later learned that Schuetz was the primary witness against Mayhoff at his trial for insurance fraud, so Mayhoff's affidavit has never been regarded as credible by historians.|$|E
5|$|The region {{also plays}} an {{important}} role in defense contracting, with particular emphasis in the shipbuilding and ship repair businesses for the city of Norfolk. Major private shipyards located in Norfolk or the Hampton Roads area include: Huntington Ingalls Industries (formerly Northrop Grumman Newport News) in Newport News, BAE Systems Norfolk Ship Repair, General Dynamics NASSCO Norfolk, and Colonna's Shipyard Inc., while the US Navy's Norfolk Naval Shipyard is just across the Downtown Tunnel in Portsmouth. Most contracts fulfilled by these shipyards are issued by the Navy, though some private commercial repair also takes place. Over 35% of Gross Regional Product (which includes the entire Norfolk-Newport News-Virginia Beach MSA), is attributable <b>to</b> <b>defense</b> spending, and that 75% of all regional growth since 2001 is attributable to increases in defense spending.|$|E
5|$|Weissenberger was {{appointed}} Gruppenkommandeur (group commander) of II. Gruppe of JG 5 on 26 March 1944. He claimed three aircraft shot down on 4 April, and four more on 9 April, taking his victories from 159 to 162. At {{the end of}} April 1944, II. Gruppe relocated to Jakobstadt, withdrawing from the Arctic Front for the last time. On 17 May he claimed victories 169 to 172, {{and the next day}} shot down three Yakovlev Yak-9s, taking his total to 175. These were his last victories on the Eastern Front.

5|$|In October 1940, Saville flew to London with Chaney for {{temporary}} {{duty as a}} military air observer studying British air defenses, and returned to Mitchel Field after two months to become executive officer at the temporary rank of major of the First Interceptor Command. He began drafting a comprehensive air defense doctrine which combined features of the British system with those advocated by Chennault and himself. Saville was promoted to the permanent rank of major in February, 1941, and from March 25 to April 12, he conducted an intensive course in air defense given to 60 fighter group staff, including Kenneth P. Bergquist, posted to Hawaii's fighter wing. In August 1941, he returned to London and observed British air defense measures until December 1941. During this time, Saville's Air Defense Doctrine draft was reviewed by the USAAC, {{but it was not}} approved or published. Saville's proposed defense involved rigorous round-the-clock coordination between ground observers, radar installations, and centralized command posts to filter reports <b>to</b> <b>defense</b> forces consisting of anti-aircraft artillery batteries, barrage balloons, and fighter wings. Unusually, Saville proposed that fighter wings involved in air defense be completely separate from fighter wings making attacks on enemy air forces.|$|E

25|$|Andersson's {{good fortune}} in {{stumbling}} across prospects continued in 2001 when {{he happened to}} see {{a game in which}} Jonathan Ericsson, at the time a center, had been switched <b>to</b> <b>defense</b> temporarily due to injuries on his team. Ericsson had not garnered any attention from other scouts as a forward, but Andersson thought he was an excellent defender with great size and reach, and so recommended that Ericsson should move <b>to</b> <b>defense</b> permanently. The Wings subsequently drafted Ericsson with the last pick in the 2002 draft on Andersson's word of his potential as a defender, and is currently playing in the NHL with the Wings.|$|E
