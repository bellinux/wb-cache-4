40|$|Aim: There {{are still}} {{controversial}} results {{about the role}} of endometrial <b>thickness,</b> <b>pattern,</b> volume, and vascularity in endometrial receptivity. We studied the predictivity of endometrial parameters in endometrial receptivity in over-aged, normogonadotrophic unexplained infertile women. Materials and methods: In this study, 150 women with an age range of 38 - 42 were included. The patients were divided into 4 groups: group 1 was applied recombinant FSH and intrauterine insemination, group 2 was applied clomiphene citrate and intrauterine insemination, group 3 was applied IVF, and group 4 (control group) was composed of fertile control patients. All patients in each study group had standard initiation dosages for ovulation induction. Endometrial thickness, volume, and colour Doppler results were evaluated according to their mean values. Results: The groups were homogeneous according to their age, body-mass-index, basal hormone levels, and maximum follicle diameter on the day of ovulation trigger injection. Endometrial thickness and pattern were significantly different between groups. The difference of endometrial volume was not statistically significant between groups. There were also no differences of uterine artery PI and RI between groups. The difference of spiral artery PI values between groups was statistically significant. When all groups are evaluated, effects of endometrial parameters on pregnancy were not different. Conclusion: Endometrial <b>thickness,</b> <b>pattern,</b> and volume, and RI and PI values for uterine and spiral arteries were found to have no predictive value on endometrial receptivity in over-aged, unexplained infertile women.

40|$|Late Cretaceous (Campanian) tidal rhythmites are {{documented}} in the upper Menefee Formation at the Cliff House Sandstone transition near Durango, Colorado, USA. These tidal rhythmites are records of daily tidal cycles and also indicate the presence of diurnal or mixed diurnal tides in {{this portion of the}} Cretaceous Western Interior Seaway. The tidal rhythmites occur within beds at the base of lateral accretion surfaces in a fluvially connected deltaic meandering tidal channel. The occurrence of Skolithos and rare Teredolites confirm a marine influence in this deposit. Tidal channels at the transition of the fluvial Menefee Formation to the overlying marine Cliff House Sandstone are well {{documented in the}} region (Olsen et al., 1999). The tidal channel filling deposits have a modern day analogue of the Brahmaputra River Delta. These Cretaceous tidal rhythmite <b>thickness</b> <b>patterns</b> occur in both planar laminations and bidirectional ripples. Alternating sandstone and shale planar lamination are inferred to be deposits from tidal flood and ebb events. Bidirectional ripples with shale “mud drapes” also have <b>thickness</b> <b>patterns</b> consistent with tidal rhythmites. Both types of tidal rhythmites show evidence of a semidiurnal or semidiurnal mixed paleotidal system as they lack a distinct linear trend between flood and ebb lamina (Archer et al., 1995). Fifty four planar laminations are persevered that represent 27 tidal cycles. Thirty six separate ripples with opposing slip face directions represent 36 tidal cycles. The cyclic variation in <b>thickness</b> <b>patterns</b> of both planar laminations and bidirectional ripples are similar to modern asymmetrical tidal patterns (flood dominant or ebb dominant). The <b>thickness</b> <b>patterns</b> are consistent with neap/ spring cycles and may be records of synodic half months, several tropical half months, and one anomalistic month. The thickness and recorded duration of the tidal rhythmite cycles was limited due to truncation of bidirectional ripple deposits by either storm surges or fluvial floods. Migrating channel deposits have been previously documented for having a robust tidal rhythmite record, but with a limited number of preserved cycles (Coueffe et al., 2004) ...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} the analyze of the heterogeneity of the Groningen gas field, i. e. characterization of the reservoir rock and the sealing Zechstein salt {{on top of the}} reservoir, by modeling the rock properties of the formations. The aim of this study is twofold, namely to characterize the thickness, shale content and porosity of the reservoir rock and the sealing Zechstein salt. But also to set an geological framework of the Groningen gas field, which can serve as a basic input for subsidence studies and geomechanical modeling of the Groningen field. The Groningen gas field was first discovered in 1959 by well Slochteren 1 and has an horizontal extent of around 900 km 2. The reservoir is situated at a depth of 2600 - 3200 m and the estimated recoverable volume is about 2700 billion m 3. It lies within the Southern Permian Basin gas province, an extensive E-W stretched sedimentary basin. In order to analyze the heterogeneity of the sediments (this include the Ten Boer, Ameland and Slochteren member) and the salt rock, software named Quantumgis is used to obtain two dimensional interpolated plots of the three evaluated rock properties. The three rock properties evaluated are thicknesses, shale content and porosities. Well log data have been used to determine these properties. For the thicknesses, the penetration depth of the well bores are used. For the determination of the shale content, gamma-ray and spontaneous potential logs have been used. And eventually, the porosities are derived from density and neutron logs. The used data is obtained from NLOG, the Dutch gas and oil portal. The Zechstein member is a relative thick formation, and show a relative heterogeneous <b>thickness</b> <b>pattern.</b> The Ten Boer member has a relative homogeneous <b>thickness</b> <b>pattern.</b> It has a high shale content and low porosity. Both properties show a heterogeneous pattern. The Ameland member is relative thin and is only present in the northern half of the field, with a high shale content. The distribution of the shale content show a heterogeneous pattern. Finally, the Slochteren member, which is the main reservoir rock, has a heterogeneous <b>thickness</b> <b>pattern.</b> The porosities are high and the shale content is relative low. Both properties show a relative homogeneous pattern. In short, the evaluated formations show a relative heterogeneous pattern for the three rock properties. If one relates the obtained models in this research with the compaction models done by the NAM (NAM, 2013), it is clear that production must be reduced or completely stopped in regions with high porosities, since at these regions subsidence values are the highest. This will lead to less compaction and a lower chance of seismic activities. Applied Geophysics and PetrophysicsGeoscience & EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E

40|$|Paleogene <b>thickness</b> <b>patterns</b> {{across the}} Bouldnor Syncline and Porchfield Anticline {{in the northwestern}} Isle of Wight have been deduced using outcrop information, {{borehole}} correlation, gamma-ray logs and seismic reflection data. The <b>thickness</b> <b>patterns</b> provide evidence for an early phase of basin inversion at around the Bartonian–Priabonian boundary (Late Eocene) in the Isle of Wight. Paleogene strata older than the Becton Sand Formation show little evidence for significant lateral changes in thickness, even though the boreholes are located at various structural positions around the Bouldnor Syncline and Porchfield Anticline. In contrast, both seismic reflection and borehole data provide evidence for marked thinning of Paleogene strata onto the Porchfield Anticline at around {{the level of the}} Becton Sand Formation and basal Headon Hill Formation (Totland Bay Member) which probably results from an episode of basin inversion and growth folding. The inversion event was relatively minor and short-lived and continues to point toward the main phase of the basin inversion being late Oligocene or younger. However, it still has important implications for understanding structural control on sedimentation patterns in the Headon Hill Formation, with the migration of sandy channelised depositional systems into the axis of the Bouldnor Syncline, and the sequence stratigraphic significance of the important Bartonian–Priabonian regression event, which may related to tectonics rather than global sea-level change. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} and motion of fronts associated with lee-side troughs on large mountain barriers has been investigated. These fronts differ from ordinary cold fronts in their horizontal temperature field, which {{is characterized by}} a sinusoidal thermal ridge. The thermal ridge intensifies, while remaining stationary with respect to the mountains, and moves eastward upon the approach of a Pacific cold front. An equation is derived, showing that changes in the thermal pattern can be described by changes in a potential thermal vorticity equation, which consists of three terms: (1) one representing an advection of the potential thermal vorticity by the 500 -mb. wind; (2) one representing the advection of 500 -mb. absolute vorticity by the thermal wind; and (3) a purely orographic term. An idealized sinusoidal model of the <b>thickness</b> <b>pattern</b> is used in conjunction with the prognostic equation to explain the {{development and}} motion of lee-side thermal ridges.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In fifteen patients with MS retinal thickness measurements in the central (fovea plus inner macular ring) and peripheral (outer ring) macula obtained by ocular coherence tomography (OCT- 3 device) were compared to those of 15 age-matched healthy controls. RESULTS: Eyes of MS patients had on the average a thinner macula (241. 8 +/- 20. 6 micrometers) than control eyes (252. 0 +/- 16. 4, p value 0. 038). Significant segmental differences occurred in the central macula (p = 0. 013). Eight eyes with a positive history of optic neuritis (ON) had on average a thinner macula (226. 8 +/- 14. 0) than eyes of MS patients without a history of ON (non-ON eyes: 247. 3 +/- 20. 1, p value 0. 01). The only measure significantly different between non-ON and control eyes was the ratio between the central and peripheral macular thickness (p = 0. 017). Average macular thickness in non-ON eyes, unlike control eyes (r = - 0. 63, p = 0. 0002), did not correlate with age (r = 0. 01, p = 0. 97), however, it did show a borderline correlation with disease duration (r = - 0. 41, p = 0. 056). CONCLUSIONS: Preferential thinning in the central relative to the peripheral macular region is present in eyes of patients with MS.

In this paper, we develop a finite element sea ice model to investigate {{the sensitivity of the}} Arctic sea ice cover features to the resolution of the narrow straits constituting the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. The model is a two-level dynamic-thermodynamic sea ice model, including a viscous-plastic rheology. It is run over 1979 - 2005, forced by daily NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data. Confronting qualitatively numerical experiments with observations shows a good agreement with satellite and buoys measurements. Due to its simple representation of the oceanic interactions, the model overestimates the sea ice extent during winter in the southernmost parts of the Arctic, while the Baffin Bay and Kara Sea remain ice-covered during summer. In order to isolate the benefits from resolving the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, a numerical experiment is performed where we artificially close the archipelago. Focusing Oil the large-scale sea ice <b>thickness</b> <b>pattern,</b> no significant change is found in our model, except in the close Surroundings of the archipelago. However, the local and shortterm influences of the ice exchanges are nonnegligible. in particular, we show that the ice volume associated to the Canadian Arctic Archipelago represents 10 % of the Northern Hemisphere sea ice volume and that the annual mean ice export towards Baffin Bay amounts to 125 km(3) yr(- 1), which may play an important role on the convective overturning in the Labrador Sea.

We investigated whether a cortical thickness–based clustering method can reflect such findings. MethodsA total of 77 AD subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 2 data set who underwent 3 -T magnetic resonance imaging, [18 F]-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (PET), [18 F]-Florbetapir PET, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tests were enrolled. After clustering based on cortical thickness, diverse imaging and biofluid biomarkers were compared between these groups. ResultsThree cortical thinning patterns were noted: medial temporal (MT; 19. 5 %), diffuse (55. 8 %), and parietal dominant (P; 24. 7 %) atrophy subtypes. The P subtype was the youngest and represented more glucose hypometabolism in the parietal and occipital cortices and marked amyloid-beta accumulation in most brain regions. The MT subtype revealed more glucose hypometabolism in the left hippocampus and bilateral frontal cortices and less performance in memory tests. CSF test results did not differ between the groups.

40|$|Arctic sea ice {{thickness}} distributions from models {{participating in}} the World Climate Research Programme Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP 5) are evaluated against observations from submarines, aircraft and satellites. While it is encouraging that the mean thickness distributions from the models are in general agreement with observations, the spatial patterns of sea ice thickness are poorly represented in most models. The poor spatial representation of <b>thickness</b> <b>patterns</b> {{is associated with a}} failure of models to represent details of the mean atmospheric circulation pattern that governs the transport and spatial distribution of sea ice. The climate models as a whole also tend to underestimate the rate of ice volume loss from 1979 to 2013, though the multimodel ensemble mean trend remains within the uncertainty of that from the Pan-Arctic Ice Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System. Although large uncertainties in observational products complicate model evaluations, these results raise concerns regarding the ability of CMIP 5 models to realistically represent the processes driving the decline of Arctic sea ice and to project the timing of when a seasonally ice-free Arctic may become a reality...|$|R
