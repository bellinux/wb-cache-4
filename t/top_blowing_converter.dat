40|$|A multi-zone {{kinetic model}} {{coupled with a}} dynamic slag {{generation}} model was developed for the simulation of hot metal and slag composition during the BOF operation. The three reaction zones, (i) jet impact zone (ii) slag-bulk metal zone (iii) slag-metal-gas emulsion zone were considered for the calculation of overall refining kinetics. In the rate equations, the transient rate parameters were mathematically described {{as a function of}} process variables. A micro and macroscopic rate calculation methodology (micro-kinetics and macro-kinetics) were developed to estimate the total refining contributed by the recirculating metal droplets through the slag-metal emulsion zone. The micro-kinetics involves developing the rate equation for individual droplets in the emulsion. The mathematical models for the size distribution of initial droplets, kinetics of simultaneous refining of elements, the residence time in the emulsion, dynamic interfacial area change were established in the micro-kinetic model. In the macro-kinetics calculation, a droplet generation model was employed and the total amount of refining by emulsion was calculated by summing the refining from the entire population of returning droplets. A dynamic FetO generation model based on oxygen mass balance was developed and coupled with the multi-zone kinetic model. The effect of post combustion on the evolution of slag and metal composition was investigated. The model was applied to a 200 -ton <b>top</b> <b>blowing</b> <b>converter</b> and the simulated value of metal and slag was found to be in good agreement with the measured data. The post-combustion ratio was found to be an important factor in controlling FetO content in the slag and the kinetics of Mn and P in a BOF process...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to develop {{mathematical}} models to explore the mixing and its related phenomena in converter bath. Specifically, first, a mathematical model of a physical model converter, which was scaled down to 1 / 6 th of a 30 t vessel, was developed in this study. A number of parameters were studied and their effects on the mixing time were recorded in a <b>top</b> <b>blown</b> <b>converter.</b> Second, a mathematical model for a combined top-bottom blown was built to investigate the optimization process. Then, a side tuyere was introduced in the combined top-bottom <b>blown</b> <b>converter</b> and its effects on the mixing and wall shear stress were studied. Moreover, based on the above results, the kinetic energy transfer phenomena in a real converter were investigated by applying the mathematical models. A simplified model, in which the calculation region was reduced to save calculation compared to simulations of the whole region of the converter, was used in the mathematical simulation. In addition, this method was also used in the simulation of real converters. This approach makes it possible to simulate the Laval nozzle flow jet and the cavity separately when using different turbulence models. In the <b>top</b> <b>blown</b> <b>converter</b> model, a comparison between the physical model and the mathematical model showed a good relative difference of 2. 5 % and 6. 1 % for the cavity depth and radius, respectively. In addition, the predicted mixing time showed a good relative difference of 2. 8 % in comparison to the experimental data. In an optimization of a combined top-bottom <b>blown</b> <b>converter,</b> a new bottom tuyere scheme with an asymmetrical configuration was found to be one of the best cases with respect to a decreased mixing time in the bath. An industrial investigation showed that the application effects of the new tuyere scheme yield a better stirring condition in the bath compared to the original case. Furthermore, the results indicated that the mixing time for a combined top-bottom-side <b>blown</b> <b>converter</b> was decreased profoundly compared to a conventional combined top-bottom <b>blown</b> <b>converter.</b> It was found that the side wall shear stress is increased by introducing side blowing, especially in the region near the side blowing plume. For a 100 t converter in real, the fundamental aspects of kinetic energy transfer from a top and bottom gas to the bath were explored. The analyses revealed that the energy transfer is less efficient when the top lance height is lowered or the flowrate is increased in the <b>top</b> <b>blowing</b> operations. However, an inverse trend was found. Namely, that the kinetic energy transfer is increased when the bottom flowrate is increased in the current bottom blowing operations. In addition, the slag on top of the bath is found to dissipate 6. 6 %, 9. 4 % and 11. 2 % for the slag masses 5, 9 and 15 t compared to the case without slag on top of the surface of the bath, respectively.   QC 20151015 </p...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} work is to {{increase}} the knowledge of phenomena taking place during the initial stage in a <b>top</b> <b>blown</b> <b>converter.</b> The work has been done in a few steps resulting in four different supplements. Water model experiments have been carried out using particle image velocimetry (PIV) technology. The system investigated was a fundamental <b>top</b> <b>blown</b> <b>converter</b> where an air jet was set to impinge on a water surface. The flow field of the combined blown case, where an air jet was introduced through a bottom nozzle, was also captured by the PIV. The work clearly showed that the flow field caused by an impinging <b>top</b> <b>blown</b> jet alone could not match that of the bottom blown case. The main re-circulation loop (or vortex) was investigated with respect to position and it was found that an increased flow rate pushes the center of the re-circulation loop downwards into the bath. However, for the top-blown case there is a point when the flow rate is too large to cause a distinguishable re-circulation loop since the jet becomes more plunging (i. e. penetrates deep into the bath) than impinging, with large surface agitation and splashing as a result. A numerical model with the same dimensions as the experimental system was then created. Three different turbulence models from the same family were tested: standard-, realizable- and a modified-(slight modification of one of the coefficients in order to produce less spreading of the air jet) k-ε turbulence model. It could be shown that for the family of k-ε turbulence models the difference in penetration depth was small and that the values corresponded well to literature data. However, {{when it comes to the}} position of the re-circulation loop it was shown that the realizable k-ε model produced better results when comparing the results to the experimental data produced from the PIV measurements, mentioned earlier. It was then shown how the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model could be coupled to thermodynamics databases in order to solve for both reactions and transport in the system. Instead of an air-water system, a gas-steel-slag system was created using the knowledge obtained in the previous simulation step described above. Reactions between gas-steel, gas-slag, steel-slag and gas-steel-slag were considered. Extrapolation of data from a few seconds of simulation was used for comparison to experimental data from the literature and showed reasonable agreement. The overall conclusion was that it is possible to make a coupling of the Thermo-Calc databases and a CFD software to make dynamic simulations of metallurgical processes such as a top-blown converter. A parametric study was then undertaken where two different steel grades were tested; one with high initial carbon content (3. 85 mass-%) and one with lower carbon content (0. 5 mass-%). The initial silicon content was held constant at 0. 84 mass-%. Different initial temperatures were tested and also some variation in initial dissolved oxygen content was tried. It was found that the rate of decarburization/desiliconization was influenced by the temperature and carbon concentration in the melt, where a high temperature as well as a high carbon concentration favors decarburization over desiliconization. It was also seen that the region affected by a lower concentration of alloys (or impurities) was quite small close to the axis where the impinging jet hits the bath. Add the oscillating nature of the cavity and it was realized that sampling from this region during an experiment might be quite difficult. QC 2010072...|$|R

40|$|A {{thermodynamic}} model for calculating the phosphorus distribution ratio between top-bottom combined <b>blown</b> <b>converter</b> steelmaking slags and molten steel {{has been developed}} by coupling with a developed {{thermodynamic model}} for calculating mass action concentrations of structural units in the slags, i. e., CaO-SiO 2 -MgO-FeO-Fe 2 O 3 -MnO-Al 2 O 3 -P 2 O 5 slags, based on the ion and molecule coexistence theory (IMCT). Not only the total phosphorus distribution ratio but also the respective phosphorus distribution ratio among four basic oxides as components, i. e., CaO, MgO, FeO, and MnO, in the slags and molten steel can be predicted theoretically by the developed IMCT phosphorus distribution ratio prediction model after knowing the oxygen activity of molten steel at the slag-metal interface or the Fe (t) O activity in the slags and the related mass action concentrations of structural units or ion couples in the slags. The calculated mass action concentrations of structural units or ion couples in the slags equilibrated or reacted with molten steel show that the calculated equilibrium mole numbers or mass action concentrations of structural units or ion couples, rather than the mass percentage of components, can present the reaction ability of the components in the slags. The predicted total phosphorus distribution ratio by the developed IMCT model shows a reliable agreement with the measured phosphorus distribution ratio by using the calculated mass action concentrations of iron oxides as presentation of slag oxidation ability. Meanwhile, the developed thermodynamic model for calculating the phosphorus distribution ratio can determine quantitatively the respective dephosphorization contribution ratio of Fe (t) O, CaO + Fe (t) O, MgO + Fe (t) O, and MnO + Fe (t) O in the slags. A significant difference of dephosphorization ability among Fe (t) O, CaO + Fe (t) O, MgO + Fe (t) O, and MnO + Fe (t) O has been found as approximately 0. 0 pct, 99. 996 pct, 0. 0 pct, and 0. 0 pct during a combined <b>blown</b> <b>converter</b> steelmaking process, respectively. There is a great gradient of oxygen activity of molten steel at the slag-metal interface and in a metal bath when carbon content in a metal bath is larger than 0. 036 pct.

To optimize the BOP-process under modern conditions, {{it is promising to}} use improved oxygen lances for <b>top</b> <b>blowing</b> in comparison with known designs. Objective. An important stage in the development of advanced steel production technologies is obtaining information on the thermodynamic model of <b>blowing</b> a <b>converter</b> bath through a three-tier lance with the elaboration of the regularities of oxidation processes within the reaction zone of a 160 -ton industrial converter. Methods. The analysis that was carried out has a theoretical nature and is based on the definition of the influence of temperature and pressure on the regularities of oxidation processes within the reaction zones formed when oxygen jets are introduced into the volume of a metal bath, foamed slag-metallic emulsion and waste gases in the working space of the converter. As a thermodynamic parameter, the Gibbs energy was used to estimate the probability of chemical reactions. The pressure effect on the oxidation processes in the converter bath was evaluated in accordance with the Van’t Hoff formula. Results. The thermodynamic features of oxidation processes in the 160 -ton BOF bath using a three-tier lance are presented. Primary reaction zone is characterized by the occurrence of oxidation of manganese, silicon, carbon, and iron by gaseous oxygen. In the secondary reaction zone there are chemical reactions of the oxidation of silicon and carbon dissolved in the metal by oxygen, as well as the reduction of iron oxide by carbon. The presence or absence of a slag phase on the melt surface practically does not affect the occurrence probability of chemical transformations within the boundary of primary and secondary reaction zones. The additional secondary oxygen jets are characterized by oxidation of the oxide components of the slag and gas phases. Conclusions. During the research it was clarified the thermodynamical model of the oxidation processes in primary and secondary reaction zones, that were formed due to the interaction of 160 -ton BOF bath with the supersonic and sonic oxygen jets flowing out of the separate groups of nozzles (of Laval and cylindrical shapes) of top three-level oxygen lance...|$|R
