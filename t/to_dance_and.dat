5|$|Bears {{in captivity}} have for centuries {{been used for}} entertainment. They have been trained <b>to</b> <b>dance,</b> <b>and</b> were kept for baiting in Europe {{at least since the}} 16th century. There were five bear-baiting gardens in Southwark, London at that time; archaeological remains of three of these have survived. Across Europe, nomadic Romani bear {{handlers}} called Ursari lived by busking with their bears from the 12th century.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} ten, after {{spending}} his first decade in Benares, Shankar went to Paris with the dance group of his brother, choreographer Uday Shankar. By the age of 13 {{he had become a}} member of the group, accompanied its members on tour and learned <b>to</b> <b>dance</b> <b>and</b> play various Indian instruments. Uday's dance group toured Europe and the United States in the early to mid-1930s and Shankar learned French, discovered Western classical music, jazz, cinema and became acquainted with Western customs. Shankar heard Allauddin Khan – the lead musician at the court of the princely state of Maihar – play at a music conference in December 1934 in Calcutta, and Uday convinced the Maharaja of Maihar in 1935 to allow Khan to become his group's soloist for a tour of Europe. Shankar was sporadically trained by Khan on tour, and Khan offered Shankar training to become a serious musician under the condition that he abandon touring and come to Maihar.|$|E

She dances erotically around a pole and up against a mirror.

25|$|Meanwhile, {{spurred by}} their {{experiences}} of the Napoleonic Wars, and realising many of the harsh indignities through which the peasant soldiers were forced, Decembrist officers and sympathisers displayed their contempt for the ancien régime by rejecting court lifestyle, wearing their cavalry swords at balls (indicating their unwillingness <b>to</b> <b>dance),</b> <b>and</b> committing themselves to academic study. This new lifestyle captured {{the spirit of the}} times, as a willingness to embrace both the peasant (i.e., the 'Russian way of life') and ongoing reformative movements abroad.|$|E

Sloth bear cubs, which were usually purchased at the age of six months from traders and poachers, were trained <b>to</b> <b>dance</b> <b>and</b> follow commands through coercive stimuli and starvation. Males were castrated at an early age, and their teeth were knocked out at the age of one year to prevent them from seriously injuring their handlers. The bears were typically fitted with a nose ring attached to a four-foot leash. Some were found to be blind from malnutrition.|$|E

In June 2007, Tedder signed a worldwide publishing administration deal with Kobalt Music Publishing. The deal included Tedder's new works and all songs not performed by OneRepublic.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{etymology}} of {{the name}} can be disputed, {{there are only a}} few theories about where the word might have derived from. The origins of the music are traced to the land of Cibao, and Merengue Cibaeño and Merengue Típico are the terms most musicians use to refer to Classical Merengue. The word Cibao was a native name for the island, although the Spanish used it in their conquest to refer to a specific part of the island, the highest mountainous range. Literally speaking, the term Merengue Cibaeño is therefore partially native and so Merengue might also be a derivation or mistranslation of a native word related to song, music, dance or festival. Another theory includes Western African words related <b>to</b> <b>dance</b> <b>and</b> music, based on the fact that Merengue has African elements in it.|$|E
