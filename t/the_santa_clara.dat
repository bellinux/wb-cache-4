5|$|On August12, Betsy struck southeastern Puerto Rico {{and quickly}} crossed the island. Damage was {{heaviest}} where it moved ashore {{and in the}} territory's central portion, and throughout Puerto Rico there were 15,023houses that were destroyed by Betsy. Multiple locations reported heavy crop damage, including Camuy which reported a complete loss of the corn crop. Hurricane Betsy was the first hurricane to be observed from the San Juan radar, and also resulted in the first hurricane warning on the island to be released on television. The hurricane left $40million in damage and 16deaths, which prompted a federally declared disaster area. Locally the hurricane was known as <b>the</b> <b>Santa</b> <b>Clara</b> Hurricane. After exiting Puerto Rico, Betsy brushed the Bahamas before turning northeastward, becoming extratropical on August18. The remnants dissipated two days later {{to the south of}} Newfoundland.|$|E

5|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that almost all California coastal steelhead are of native origin, despite over a century of {{hatchery}} stocking. Genetic analysis shows that the South Central California Coast DPS and Southern California DPS from Malibu Creek north, and including the San Gabriel River, Santa Ana River and San Mateo Creek, are not hatchery strains. Steelhead from Topanga Creek and the Sweetwater River were partly, and those from San Juan Creek completely, of hatchery origin. Genetic analysis has also shown that the steelhead in the streams of <b>the</b> <b>Santa</b> <b>Clara</b> County and Monterey Bay basins are not of hatchery origin, including the Coyote Creek, Guadalupe River, Pajaro River, Permanente Creek, Stevens Creek, San Francisquito Creek, San Lorenzo River, and San Tomas Aquino Creek basins. Natural waterfalls and two major dams have isolated Russian River steelhead from freshwater rainbow trout forms above the impassable barriers; a 2007 genetic study of fin samples collected from steelhead at 20 different sites both above and below passage barriers in the watershed found that although 30million hatchery trout were stocked in the river from 1911 to 1925, the steelhead remain of native and not hatchery origin.|$|E
