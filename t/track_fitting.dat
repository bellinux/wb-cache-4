40|$|Physics {{collisions}} at 13 TeV {{are expected}} at the LHC {{with an average}} of 40 - 50 proton-proton collisions per bunch crossing. Tracking at trigger level is an essential tool to control the rate in high-pileup conditions while maintaining a good efficiency for relevant physics processes. The Fast TracKer (FTK) {{is an integral part of}} the trigger upgrade for the ATLAS detector. For every event passing the Level 1 trigger (at a maximum rate of 100 kHz) the FTK receives data from the 80 million channels of the silicon detectors, providing tracking information to the High Level Trigger in order to ensure a selection robust against pile-up. The FTK performs a hardware- based track reconstruction, using associative memory (AM) that is based on the use of a custom chip, designed to perform pattern matching at very high speed. It finds track candidates at low resolution (roads) that seed a full-resolution <b>track</b> <b>fitting</b> done by FPGAs. Narrow roads permit a fast <b>track</b> <b>fitting</b> but need many patterns stored in the AM to ensure efficient matching, wide roads allow for fewer patterns but combinatorics slow down the <b>track</b> <b>fitting.</b> To optimise this choice, the feature of variable resolution of the roads is implemented via ternary bits in the AM logic. An overview of the FTK system with focus on the pattern matching procedure will be presented. Furthermore, the expected performance and the integration of FTK within the ATLAS trigger system will be discussed...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—On-line track {{reconstruction}} {{is one of}} the bottle-necks of {{the pattern}} recognition task in High-Energy Physics (HEP). This problem has been traditionally divided into the sub-tasks of track finding and <b>track</b> <b>fitting.</b> The latter involves estimating the state of a particle inside a detector moving under the influence of a magnetic field. For the last twenty or so years the most popular solution to the <b>track</b> <b>fitting</b> problem has been the Kalman filter (KF). It is well known that the KF is only guaranteed to compute the optimal estimator if the dynamics of the system are linear and subject to Gaussian noise. However, these conditions are not met in the <b>track</b> <b>fitting</b> problem, in particular, the dynamics are strongly non-Gaussian due to effects such as multiple Coulomb scattering and energy loss. A proposed solution is the “Gaussian sum filter ” (GSF) which runs a bank of KFs to estimate each of the modes of the noise distributions, modelled here as a mixture of Gaussians. But this solution is limited {{by the fact that the}} GSF uses the same distribution for every input dataset. To address this issue, we present in this paper the Input-adaptive KF (IAKF), which makes use of the dynamic code generation features in Intel’s ArBB parallel framework to create a GSF that matches the given (observation) noise distribution. The IAKF further deals with non-linearity by having the GSF drive, instead of KFs, the recently proposed Quasi-Monte Carlo KF (QMC-KF), a generalization of the σ-point KF family. Numerical results are shown to validate the performance of the IAKF. The generated code is not only tailored to the data, but takes advantage of several levels of parallelism in multi-core processors.
