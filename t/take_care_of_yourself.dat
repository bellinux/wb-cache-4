2500|$|As Zhu was (outwardly) {{preparing}} to leave Jiangdu, Xu Zhixun went to bid him farewell. [...] Zhu held a feast for him, offered him wine, had Zhu's favorite concubine come outside to greet him and sing for him, and presented Zhu's favorite horse {{as a gift to}} him. [...] Zhu then invited him into the middle of Zhu's mansion, where Zhu's wife Lady Tao came out to greet him as well as a sign of respect. [...] Xu Zhixun was pleased and took no further precautions, while Zhu already had his elite guards surround the hall. [...] As Lady Tao bowed to Xu Zhixun and he bowed back, Zhu struck him and, as he fell to the ground, Zhu's elite soldiers entered and cut off his head. [...] After Zhu took the head and showed them to Xu Zhixun's soldiers, they all fled. [...] Zhu then entered the palace and showed the head to Yang, stating, [...] "I, your servant, have removed a harm to Your Majesty." [...] However, Yang, in fear of the consequences, fled and stated, [...] "You, Uncle, <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>yourself!</b> [...] I know nothing about this." [...] (Yang referred to Zhu as uncle because Yang Xingmi's first wife Lady Zhu had the same surname, although she was unrelated to Zhu Jin.) [...] Shortly after, Zhu was cornered by soldiers under Xu Wen's associate Zhai Qian (翟虔), and committed suicide.|$|E
60|$|I read in {{the papers}} that your {{accident}} isn't serious but I am worried, oh Carl you must <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>yourself.</b>|$|E

6000|$|... "And now we'll have {{to start}} back," [...] said Dunston Porter, a little later. [...] "Dave, <b>take</b> good <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>yourself,</b> and make a good record." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, you <b>take</b> good <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>yourself,</b> and I'll {{start right}} away," [...] {{returned}} the youngest Rover, {{and after a}} few words more hung up the receiver.|$|R
6000|$|... "You <b>take</b> good <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>yourself,</b> Dave," [...] said Henry, who {{was sitting}} on a bench with his head bound up. [...] "Those Indians are on the warpath, and they mean business." ...|$|R
60|$|MRS WHITEFIELD. Oh, you are different, somehow: you {{are able}} to <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>yourself.</b> You'd serve her out. And anyhow, she must marry somebody.|$|E
6000|$|... "Promise to <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>yourself,</b> Mrs. Eyrecourt, and I will {{confess that}} the {{professional}} visits are over. I come here to-day {{only as a}} friend." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well, then; it's all right. I {{was going}} to show you. I did not suppose that you knew how to <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>yourself</b> so well." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{broke off}} suddenly. [...] "No, I'll stop. You've <b>taken</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>yourself</b> so far; {{it would be}} strange if you couldn't now." [...] She turned quickly and went to Rose. [...] "I love you," [...] she said. [...] "We are spiritual sisters, I felt that the day you crushed me. I like women who do not cry. I want you to forgive me for lecturing you, and I {{want you to go}} on {{following}} the lead of your mysterious guide; I don't know what it is or, rather, who he is--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And you <b>take</b> good <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>yourself</b> {{during the}} winter," [...] {{returned}} Henry. [...] "It snows heavily out here, so they tell me. Don't you {{get lost in}} a snowstorm, like you did when you and Sam were journeying to Fort Oswego." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{gave the}} man special charge," [...] said Mr. George, [...] "not to {{interfere}} with you in any way, and not even {{to let you know}} that I had said any thing about you to him, so that you should be left entirely to your own resources. And you were so left. You acted in the whole affair just as you thought proper, and <b>took</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>yourself</b> admirably well. I think especially that you were very wise in leaving the raft when you did, instead of remaining on board three or four hours longer. But however this may be, you acted for yourself throughout. I did not interfere with you at all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I do hope, Reuben," [...] she said, [...] "if you do {{go to this}} horrid place, {{you will}} <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>yourself,</b> and not be rash." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, I know, Ada dear. Now, good-bye, and <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>yourself,</b> and don't be nervous. It {{may mean}} only that young Japs has twisted his little finger.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You? Trust you to <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>yourself!</b> I {{never knew}} a more {{self-sufficient}} young person. I am only {{waiting for some}} man to teach you your place." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What a Hercules!" [...] she said, again laughing. [...] "Do {{you really}} {{mean that you}} left London only this morning? Why, {{you must have been}} five hours in a railway {{carriage}} and two in a postchaise, not to talk of the walk afterwards. You ought to <b>take</b> more <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>yourself,</b> Captain Broughton!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Our love to you, dear," [...] he said. [...] "Take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> the jewels, but <b>take</b> more <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>yourself.</b> Your {{mother and}} I {{will come to}} New York {{as soon as we}} can. In the meantime, don't forget us amidst the hosts of your new friends and the joy of your new life." ...|$|R

6000|$|BLY. What is up {{and what}} is down? Can you answer me that? Is it up or down to get so soft that you can't <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>yourself?</b> ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Very well," [...] said Mr. George; [...] "then I {{leave you}} to <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>yourself.</b> You can get Charles to go, if his mother will trust him with you." ...|$|E

60|$|MRS. ERLYNNE. You don't {{look at all}} well, Lord Augustus. You stop up too late--it is so bad for you. You {{really should}} <b>take</b> more <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>yourself.</b> Good-bye, Lord Windermere. [Goes towards door with a bow to LORD AUGUSTUS. Suddenly smiles and looks back at him.] Lord Augustus! Won't you see me to my carriage? You might carry the fan.|$|R
6000|$|... "It was horribly dangerous, and {{it could}} not be {{necessary}} to stay in such a place. And you led an assault again. Joan, it is tempting Providence. I want you to make me a promise. I want you to promise me that you will let others lead the assaults, if there must be assaults, and that you will <b>take</b> better <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>yourself</b> in those dreadful battles. Will you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You must <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>yourself.</b> Be {{sure not}} to neglect exercise. Do you know I fancied you {{somewhat}} altered--a little fallen away, and pale. Is your uncle kind to you?" ...|$|E
60|$|Not a word more, says Robert, or {{the post}} will be missed. God bless you! Do <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>yourself,</b> and don't {{stay in that}} damp house. And do make {{allowances}} for love.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{all right}} now. You {{have as much}} as you can do to <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>yourself,</b> and it is not fair to half carry me as you and Poyor have been doing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are {{certainly}} run down," [...] said Dick, [...] "and unless you <b>take</b> extra good <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>yourself</b> you'll be flat {{on your back}} with some serious illness. But the question still is, Dan, What are we to do with you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Men!" [...] said Sir Richard; [...] "boys, you mean! But be a man, {{since you}} will, only <b>take</b> as good <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>yourself</b> as {{consists}} with duty. I had rather have you safe {{than a dozen}} of these black-visaged Gascons." ...|$|R
6000|$|Larry's {{leave of}} absence was for forty-eight hours only, and soon {{he was forced to}} bid his brother and his friend good-by. [...] "Now <b>take</b> good <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>yourself,</b> Ben," [...] he said, on parting. [...] "And do stay here until you are stronger. Remember that a wounded man can't stand this broiling sun half as well as one who isn't wounded, and even the strongest of them are {{suffering}} awfully from the heat." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'A horse!' said my father, sneeringly: 'why, {{you would}} not go a mile without racing him, and {{breaking}} your neck; and, as to a servant, you cannot <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>yourself</b> much less of him.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, well! {{go if you}} wish," [...] {{answered}} the King, impatiently. [...] "But <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>yourself,</b> for when you are away from this Valley {{there will be no}} one to protect you from danger." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A heavy fog {{is blowing}} up: we shall want the bell to-night, and I must be off at once. I shall be back before dark, of course; so <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>yourself,</b> boy," [...] said Dan.|$|E
6000|$|... "For three years," [...] he replied, quietly, [...] "I was the {{physician}} {{in charge of}} that institution. Your son"--turning to Masthead, who was flying all sorts of colors--"was, if I mistake not, one of my patients. I learn that {{a few weeks ago}} a friend of yours, named Norton, secured the young man's release upon your promise to <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> him <b>yourself</b> in future. I hope that home associations have improved the poor fellow. It's very sad!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, just this: you {{women are}} so nervous and excitable, {{that you are}} very apt to see your friends and the world in general with some {{coloring}} just as unreal. I am sorry for you, childie, but really I can't help you to get up a romance out of this bracelet. Well, good-night, Emily; <b>take</b> good <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>yourself</b> and go to bed;" [...] and Mr. Sewell went to his room, leaving poor Miss Emily almost persuaded out of {{the sight of her}} own eyes.|$|R
6000|$|Captain Wopper {{assured her}} with much solemnity {{that it might}} or might not be a compliment, but it was a fact. [...] "Why, look here," [...] said he, [...] "you go and starve yourself, and deny <b>yourself</b> all sorts <b>of</b> little comforts-- what then? Why, you'll die long before your time, which is very like taking the law into your own hands, ma'am, and then you won't leave to Netta nearly as much as you might if you had <b>taken</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>yourself</b> and lived longer, and saved up after a {{reasonable}} fashion. It's sheer madness. Why, ma'am, you're starving now, but I'll put a stop to that. Don't you mind, now, whether I'm rude or not. You can't expect anything else from an old gold-digger, who has lived for years where there were no women except such as appeared to be made of mahogany, with nothing to cover 'em but a coating of dirt and a blue skirt. Besides, Willum told me at parting to look after you and see that you wanted for nothing, which I promised faithfully to do. You've some regard for Willum's wishes, ma'am?--you wouldn't have me break my promises to Willum, would you?" ...|$|R
