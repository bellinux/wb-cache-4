40|$|Choking {{in adults}} can prove fatal, despite {{resuscitation}} attempts. The manner of death can be natural, homicide or accident. When a death {{is due to}} choking, one must consider what conditions contributed to or predisposed the person to choking (eg. alcohol, drugs and physical and mental impairments). Homicidal deaths by choking are relatively uncommon, being more frequently accidental. The diagnosis of death by choking is made at autopsy when the airway is found occluded. If the individual had an occluded airway and the object or food was removed during resuscitation, {{the only way to}} make the diagnosis would be on <b>the</b> <b>history.</b> <b>Here,</b> we <b>present</b> a case of asphyxia (accidental or suicidal) by choking on a handkerchief in a patient with a long <b>history</b> of schizophrenia. <b>The</b> woman had attempted a previous suicide driven by evil spirits coming from inside her body, especially from the head and throat; in order to “shut-up” the spirit, she was trying to suffocate it with her hands or by a belt from her pants.

40|$|Conventionally {{employed}} {{geophysical methods}} in archaeological investigations, i. e. ground penetrating radar(GPR), magnetometry, geoelectric (electrical resistivity tomography: ERT) and geo-electromagnetic (FDEM) techniques, can be hampered by specific site conditions. In <b>the</b> case <b>history</b> <b>here</b> <b>presented,</b> i) magnetometry was ruled out {{due to the}} presence of iron structures used to support nearby fences and greenhouses partially covering part of the site; ii) GPR employment was tested but not employed due to low penetration depth (i. e. presence of superficial clay sediments) which was much less than the depth of the target, iii) ERT, unfortunately, could not detect the paleo-surface(s) layer(s) as their thickness is below the resolving power of the method. For these reasons and keeping in mind that the paleo-surfaces could have been stiffened due to trampling of human activity over the centuries along which the settlement existed, we employed the Horizontal-to-Vertical Spectral Ratio method (HVSR) which is sensitive {{to the presence of}} appreciable contrasts of acoustic impedance of such paleo-surfaces. The obtained results have been proved by direct excavations. Likewise, the Induced Polarization tomography (IPT) which was acquired during the ERT survey, shed light on the presence of increased and well-organized chargeability values that inferred the presence of a paleo-riverbed. This indeed contributed in the reconstruction of the paleo-geomorphological evolution of such important archaeological site of Pilastri. We are confident that the HVSR is capable of localizing eventual presence of paleo-living surfaces thus guiding archaeologists to sites were future excavations can be planned. Finally, the possibility to employ the IPT can help in the reconstruction of the paleo-geographice evironmnets of such sites which are common in lowland areas such as the Po Plain...|$|R

40|$|Reliable {{structural}} dynamic {{models will}} be required {{as a basis for}} deriving the reduced-order plant models used in control systems for large space structures. Ground vibration testing and model verification will {{play an important role in}} the development of these models; however, fundamental differences between the space environment and earth environment, as well as variations in structural properties due to as-built conditions, will make on-orbit identification essential. The efficiency, and perhaps even the success, of on-orbit identification will depend on having a valid model of the structure. It is envisioned that the identification process will primarily involve parametric methods. Given a correct model, a variety of estimation algorithms may be used to estimate parameter values.

40|$|A {{series of}} lakes, {{both large and}} small, existed in New Mexico in late Chinle time (Triassic) and in Entrada, Todilto, and early Morrison time (Late Jurassic). Especially {{in the early part}} of this history, several small lakes, rather than one large lake, were present. Size, shape, and {{location}} changed from time to time, in such a way that regional ti lt ing must have been important. That the regional slope changed during this time interval, is also indicated by variations in patterns of stream-type cross-bedding. The maximum dimension of the largest lake was approxi-mately 500 km, from northwest to southeast. Some of the water bodies, particularly in late Chinle time, were only ponds. During late Entrada time, former sand dunes projected as islands above the lake surface, to be planed off ultimately as the water level rose. The main lake was salty for part of its history (late Todilto time), but in general appears to have been fresh. Fossils from limestone beds (early Todilto time) either have freshwater affinities or are indeterminate. There is no evidence for marine deposits within the lake basin. The extensive dune field of early Entrada time represented an interruption in <b>the</b> lake <b>history,</b> as did other eolian deposits (either not deposited in, or perhaps subsequently eroded from, the Ghost Ranch area).

40|$|We present five {{interpreted}} regional seismic profiles, {{describing the}} full sedimentary sequence across the Swedish {{sector of the}} Baltic Sea. The data for the study {{are part of an}} extensive and largely unpublished 2 D seismic dataset acquired between 1970 and 1990 by the Swedish Oil Prospecting Company (OPAB). The Baltic Basin is an intracratonic basin located in northern Europe. Most of the Swedish sector of the basin constitutes the NW flank of a broad synclinal depression, the Baltic Basin. In the SW of the Swedish sector lies the Hand Bay Basin, formed by subsidence associated with inversion of the Tornquist Zone during the Late Cretaceous. <b>The</b> geological <b>history</b> <b>presented</b> <b>here</b> is broadly consistent with previously published works. We observe an area between the Hand Bay and the Baltic Basin where the Palaeozoic strata has been affected by transpression and subsequent inversion, associated with the Tornquist Zone during the late Carboniferous-Early Permian and Late Cretaceous, respectively. We propose that the Christianso High was a structural low during the Late Jurassic, which was later inverted in the Late Cretaceous. We suggest that a fan shaped feature in the seismic data, adjacent to the Christianso, Fault within the Hand Bay Basin, represents rapidly deposited, coarse-grained sediments eroded from the inverted Christianso High during the Late Cretaceous. We identify a number of faults within the deeper part of the Baltic Basin, which we also interpret to be transpressional in nature, formed during the Caledonian Orogeny in the Late Silurian-Early Devonian. East of Gotland a number of sedimentary structures consisting of Silurian carbonate reefs and Ordovician carbonate mounds, as well as a large Quaternary glacial feature are observed. Finally, we use the seismic interpretation to infer the structural and stratigraphic <b>history</b> of <b>the</b> Baltic and Hand Bay basins within the Swedish sector...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} explores Buddhist {{architecture in}} America from {{the nineteenth century}} through the present day. It examines significant examples of Buddhist architecture {{with respect to the}} spiritual beliefs of the practitioners who created them. Its goal is to understand these structures {{from the point of view}} of human experience. Given the large number of Buddhist structures that exist in the U. S., the narrative navigates the major contours of its development. It follows in isometric fashion <b>the</b> parallel <b>history</b> of Buddhism’s emergence in America that started with the California Gold Rush and its influence on the New England Transcendentalists. Proceeding chronologically through the twentieth and early twenty-first-centuries, the historical sweep of Buddhism’s architectural presence in America is articulated by exploring important structures in depth with respect to Buddhist belief, human emotion, socio-political contexts, and religious faith. A number of hermeneutic binaries are employed throughout <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>presented</b> <b>here.</b> Space and Place, East and West, Interior and Exterior, and Spirit and Matter are the major motifs implemented to explicate the buildings and environments under investigation. The overwhelming feeling pervading the discourse and design of Buddhist architecture and its co-extensive belief system is that of the heart. The human proclivity to attach personal meaning and deep emotion to a space or a place is at the express core of the Buddhist structures that house Buddhist practices. As a result, the study’s methodology is inspired by Yi-Fu Tuan’s humanistic geography, whose work explores the relationship between environment and human subjective experience. The study finds that ritual, lineage, and heritage work in tandem with heart, home, and the human body in the construction, understanding and experience of Buddhist architecture. It argues that traditional forms and practices derived from each community’s home culture infused a sense of shelter and protection onto these buildings. Buddhist belief and its associated architecture assuaged the new and sometimes hostile setting of the United States. As the first study of its kind, this dissertation opens the field of Buddhist architecture in America as a distinct branch of scholarly inquiry...|$|R
40|$|Re-orienting current {{energy systems}} toward {{a far greater}} {{reliance}} on technologies with low or no carbon dioxide emissions is an immense challenge. At the broadest level <b>the</b> <b>histories</b> <b>presented</b> <b>here</b> are very much consistent with widely held views within the energy innovation policy literature. In general, this literature has suggested that greatly increasing rates of energy innovation requires creating significant demand for low carbon technologies, substantially increased federal funding for “well-managed” research, and {{in at least some}} cases support for the initial deployment of new technologies. As the other markets explored in this volume do not face the same degree of unpriced environmental externality, there is no straightforward equivalent to a carbon price in <b>the</b> <b>history</b> of agriculture, chemicals, IT or biopharmaceuticals. Nonetheless, our authors outline a number of ways in which public policy has often stimulated demand, particularly {{in the early stages of}} a technology’s evolution, and confirm that the expectation of rapidly growing demand appears to have been a major stimulus to private sector investment in innovation. Each <b>history</b> also confirms <b>the</b> centrality of publicly funded research to the generation of innovation, particularly in the early stages of an industry’s history, and highlights a range of institutional mechanisms that have enabled it to be simultaneously path breaking and directly connected to industrial practice. Our histories depart somewhat from the bulk of the energy innovation policy literature in focusing attention on the role of vigorous competition – particularly entry – in stimulating innovation, suggesting that in several industries a mix of public policies – including procurement, antitrust and intellectual property protection – played an important role in stimulating innovation by encouraging extensive competition and entry by newly founded firms. Many of the most innovative industries profiled here have been characterized by a lively “innovation ecosystem” that both rapidly incorporated the results of publicly funded research and supports widespread private sector experimentation and rapid entry. There are, of course important differences between the industries profiled here and the energy sector, but we believe that exploring the potential of these kinds of innovation ecosystems in clean energy might be a fruitful avenue for future research. ...|$|R
