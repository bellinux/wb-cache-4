5|$|There {{have been}} eight {{iterations}} in the Naga series, {{not counting the}} redesigned versions, with release dates spanning from 2009 to 2016. <b>The</b> <b>mice</b> are, in order of release: the Naga, Naga Epic, Naga 2012, Naga Hex, Naga 2014, Naga Epic Chroma, Naga Chroma, and Naga Hex v2. All except the Naga Epic and the Naga Epic Chroma are wired and connected through a USB port. The Naga Hex and the Naga Hex v2 are the only iterations to have less than twelve buttons, with six and seven respectively. The Naga 2014 is the only mouse in the series to have a left-handed version. The colors of <b>the</b> <b>mice</b> vary.|$|E
5|$|Malaria {{vaccines}} {{have been}} an elusive goal of research. The first promising studies demonstrating {{the potential for a}} malaria vaccine were performed in 1967 by immunizing mice with live, radiation-attenuated sporozoites, which provided significant protection to <b>the</b> <b>mice</b> upon subsequent injection with normal, viable sporozoites. Since the 1970s, there has been a considerable effort to develop similar vaccination strategies for humans. The first vaccine, called RTS,S, was approved by European regulators in 2015.|$|E

5|$|The {{high rate}} of test animal {{survival}} was {{due in part to}} the nature of single-pulse radiation. As with the two Los Alamos criticality accidents involving the earlier demon core, victims who were close enough to receive a lethal dose died, while those farther away recovered and survived. Also, all <b>the</b> <b>mice</b> were placed outside the expected lethal zone in order to study possible mutations in future generations.|$|E
5|$|Goldfrapp {{signed a}} {{recording}} contract with London-based record label Mute Records in August 1999. The pair began recording their debut album over a six-month period, beginning in September 1999, {{in a rented}} bungalow in the Wiltshire countryside. The recording process was difficult for Alison Goldfrapp, who was often alone and disturbed by <b>the</b> <b>mice</b> and insects in the bungalow. Gregory described their recording sessions as intense because he was unaccustomed to composing with others. Goldfrapp contributed the album's lyrics, and Gregory and Goldfrapp composed the music together. The lyrics are abstract obsessional tales inspired by films, Goldfrapp's childhood, and the loneliness she felt while recording the album. Musically, the album takes influence {{from a variety of}} styles including 1960s pop, cabaret, folk, and electronica.|$|E
5|$|In vertebrates, alpha-latrotoxin {{produces}} {{its effect}} through destabilisation of cell membranes and degranulation of nerve terminals, resulting in excessive release of neurotransmitters, namely acetylcholine, norepinephrine and GABA. Excess neurotransmitter activity leads to clinical manifestations of envenomation, although the precise mechanisms {{are not well}} understood. Acetylcholine release accounts for neuromuscular manifestations, and norepinephrine release accounts for the cardiovascular manifestations. Female redbacks have an average of around 0.08–0.10mg of venom, and experiments indicate that the median lethal dose (LD50) for mice at room temperature is 10–20% of this quantity (0.27–0.91mg/kg based on the mass of <b>the</b> <b>mice</b> used), {{but that it is}} considerably more deadly for mice kept at lower or higher temperatures. Pure alpha-latrotoxin has an LD50 in mice of 20–40µg/kg.|$|E
5000|$|A crude analogy: Think of [...] as the {{computer}} screen and the internal displacement as the position of <b>the</b> <b>mouse</b> pointer. Think of a curved mousepad as spacetime and the position of <b>the</b> <b>mouse</b> as <b>the</b> position. Keeping the orientation of <b>the</b> <b>mouse</b> fixed, if we move <b>the</b> <b>mouse</b> about <b>the</b> curved mousepad, the position of <b>the</b> <b>mouse</b> pointer (internal displacement) also changes and this change is path dependent; i.e., it doesn't only depend upon the initial and final position of <b>the</b> <b>mouse.</b> <b>The</b> change in the internal displacement as we move <b>the</b> <b>mouse</b> about a closed path on the mousepad is the torsion.|$|R

5|$|Maple noted that, unusually—given {{his role}} as a cunning man—Pickingill did not charge for his services, but did receive some money from visitors, and that his {{recorded}} roles included restoring lost property and curing minor ailments, both of which were common practices amongst British cunning folk. According to one account, he cured a woman of rheumatism by transferring the ailment to her father. Maple wrote that Pickingill was known to use cursing and malevolent magic on occasion, something that the folklorist contrasted with the activities of other contemporary cunning folk that he had studied, such as James Murrell. At harvest time, Maple recorded, Pickingill was known to wander around the field threatening to bewitch farm machinery, with many farmers thus offering him beer so that he would leave them alone. He was also recorded as coercing local people to obtain water for him from the village pump by threatening to set upon them white mice, a rodent which in local folklore was associated with misfortune. Another tale that Maple recorded also associated Pickingill with white mice; according to this, a visitor travelled to the cunning man's cottage only to find him lying in bed, with <b>the</b> <b>mice</b> suckling from his nipples.|$|E
5|$|Paracetamol ester prodrug with L-pyroglutamic acid (PCA), a biosynthetic {{precursor}} of glutathione, has been synthesized to reduce paracetamol hepatotoxicity and improve bioavailability. The toxicological studies of different paracetamol esters show that L-5-oxo-pyrrolidine-2-paracetamol carboxylate reduces toxicity after administration of {{an overdose of}} paracetamol to mice. The liver glutathione values in mice induced by intraperitoneal injection of the ester are superimposable with the GSH levels recorded in untreated mice control group. <b>The</b> <b>mice</b> group treated with an equivalent dose of paracetamol showed a significative decrease of glutathione of 35% (p<0.01 vs untreated control group). The oral LD50 {{was found to be}} greater than 2000 mg kg-1, whereas the intraperitoneal LD50 was 1900 mg kg-1. These results taken together with the good hydrolysis and bioavailability data show that this ester is a potential candidate as a prodrug of paracetamol.|$|E
5|$|Superoxide dismutases (SODs) are a {{class of}} closely related enzymes that {{catalyze}} {{the breakdown of the}} superoxide anion into oxygen and hydrogen peroxide. SOD enzymes are present in almost all aerobic cells and in extracellular fluids. Superoxide dismutase enzymes contain metal ion cofactors that, depending on the isozyme, can be copper, zinc, manganese or iron. In humans, the copper/zinc SOD is present in the cytosol, while manganese SOD is present in the mitochondrion. There also exists a third form of SOD in extracellular fluids, which contains copper and zinc in its active sites. The mitochondrial isozyme seems to be the most biologically important of these three, since mice lacking this enzyme die soon after birth. In contrast, <b>the</b> <b>mice</b> lacking copper/zinc SOD (Sod1) are viable but have numerous pathologies and a reduced lifespan (see article on superoxide), while mice without the extracellular SOD have minimal defects (sensitive to hyperoxia). In plants, SOD isozymes are present in the cytosol and mitochondria, with an iron SOD found in chloroplasts that is absent from vertebrates and yeast.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>mouse</b> {{and human}} Ube3a-ATS/Ube3a are {{orthologous}} {{and the general}} organizations of the regions are similar. For example, <b>the</b> <b>mouse</b> locus also contains Snurf/Snrpn, snoRNAs and IPW. The main differences are the locations and the lengths of the Ube3a-ATS transcripts. The human Ube3a/Ube3a-ATS is located on chromosome 15, while <b>the</b> <b>mouse</b> Ube3a is located on chromosome 7. <b>The</b> <b>mouse</b> LNCAT, including Ube3a-ATS, is about 1000 kb long, much longer than the human 450 kb LNCAT. [...] Due to the similar organization of <b>the</b> <b>mouse</b> and human LNCAT/Ube3a-ATS {{and the fact that}} <b>the</b> <b>mouse</b> Ube3a locus is also imprinted, <b>the</b> <b>mouse</b> is an excellent model system to study imprinting and the interactions between Ube3a/Ube3a-ATs.

25|$|Studies on mice {{have shown}} that certain {{conditional}} fears can be inherited from either parent. In one example, mice were conditioned to fear a strong scent, acetophenone, by accompanying the smell with an electric shock. Consequently, <b>the</b> <b>mice</b> learned to fear the scent of acetophenone alone. It was discovered that this fear could be passed down to <b>the</b> <b>mice</b> offspring. Despite the offspring never experiencing the electric shock themselves <b>the</b> <b>mice</b> still display a fear of the acetophenone scent, because they inherited the fear epigenetically by site-specific DNA methylation. These epigenetic changes lasted up to two generations without reintroducing the shock.|$|E
