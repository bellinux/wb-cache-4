5|$|By {{the start}} of 1969, a {{somewhat}} recovered Barrett {{decided to return to}} his musical career and revisit the Jenner-produced recordings. He contacted EMI, and was passed on to Malcolm Jones, then-head of EMI's new prog rock label, Harvest. After both Jenner and Norman Smith, Pink Floyd's producer at the time, declined to work on the album, Jones agreed <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> role.|$|E
5|$|In 1787, he {{came into}} contact with Thomas Clarkson and a group of anti-slave-trade activists, {{including}} Granville Sharp, Hannah More and Charles Middleton. They persuaded Wilberforce <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> cause of abolition, and he soon became one of the leading English abolitionists. He headed the parliamentary campaign against the British slave trade for twenty years until the passage of the Slave Trade Act of 1807.|$|E

5|$|Irving {{appealed to}} Walter Scott for help {{procuring}} a more reputable publisher {{for the remainder}} of the book. Scott referred Irving to his own publisher, London powerhouse John Murray, who agreed <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> <b>The</b> Sketch Book. From then on, Irving would publish concurrently in the United States and Britain to protect his copyright, with Murray as his English publisher of choice.|$|E
5|$|A {{central theme}} {{throughout}} Symeon's teachings and writings {{is that all}} Christians should aspire to have actual direct experience of God in deep contemplation, or theoria. Regarding his own mystical experiences, he presented them not as unique to himself, but as the norm for all Christians. He taught that the experience came after purification through prayer, repentance, and asceticism. He especially called on his monks <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> traditional charismatic and prophetic role in the Church.|$|E
5|$|Although the Admiralty saw no use {{to which}} Halkett's designs could be put in general naval service, this larger design was {{extremely}} well received by explorers. John Franklin bought one <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ill-fated 1845 expedition in which the entire expedition party of 129men and two ships vanished. Franklin saw Halkett boats as so essential to travel in Canada that he gave the boat intended for his expedition to Sir George Simpson, Governor-in-Chief of Rupert's Land, for use in his travels in the region. He ordered a replacement boat from Halkett, who delivered it in {{time for him to}} take possession before setting out on his last expedition.|$|E

5|$|As the Merlin was {{considered}} to be so important to the war effort, negotiations were soon started to establish an alternative production line outside the UK. Rolls-Royce staff visited a number of North American automobile manufacturers in order to select one to build the Merlin in the U.S. or Canada. Henry Ford rescinded an initial offer to build the engine in the U.S. in July 1940, and the Packard Motor Car Company was subsequently selected <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> $130,000,000 Merlin order. Agreement was reached in September 1940, and the first Packard-built engine, a Merlin XX designated the V-1650-1, ran in August 1941.|$|E
5|$|Dodge's {{screenplay}} for Bad Words was {{featured on the}} 2011 Black List and was shortly thereafter picked up by Bateman. In the original script, the story was set at the Scripps National Spelling Bee, but the name was changed to a fictional bee since the filmmakers did not expect Scripps to allow {{the use of their}} name in the film. After two other actors declined to play the main character, Bateman decided <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> role himself, and cast the other roles by a combination of contacting friends and open casting calls. Filming took place in Los Angeles at the end of 2012.|$|E
5|$|From its inception, the {{position}} of Minister of Defence in the government in exile was heavily contested. The appointment of Henri Rolin, an academic, to {{the position}} was particularly resented. In October 1942, Pierlot dismissed Rolin who he accused of involving himself in factional internal politics of the army, parts of which had begun to behave mutinously about their perceived inaction. To resolve the deadlock, Pierlot decided <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> position personally. He began a major restructuring of the command structure of the infantry in an ultimately successful attempt to resolve the situation. A minor mutiny among soldiers from an artillery battery was quickly suppressed in November 1942, but Pierlot was widely criticised by the British press during the soldiers' court martial in January 1943.|$|E

5|$|Goldstone {{insisted that}} he would not follow a one-sided mandate but would {{investigate}} any abuses committed by either side during the conflict. He said that he had initially not been willing <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mission unless the mandate was expanded to cover all sides. Despite then-president of the Human Rights Council, Ambassador Martin Uhomoibhi's verbal commitment that there was no objection to the revised mandate, the Human Rights Council never voted to revise the mandate, and resolution S-9/1 remained unchanged.|$|E
5|$|Grissom may not ask <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> role of mentor, but {{it seems}} to happen naturally, going {{all the way back to}} Sara Sidle when they first met in San Francisco, then Nick Stokes and Greg Sanders in Vegas. Although he can be annoyed with his protégés at times, he is visibly proud when they succeed, as Greg did by passing his field test and {{becoming}} a CSI. He is also protective of his staff and defends them as much as he can, as seen in episode 521 ("Rashomama") for example.|$|E
5|$|Harlan argued to Goebbels that Söderbaum, {{having just}} given birth, {{was too weak}} <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> role. Goebbels countered that a special room could be set up as a nursery and that a wet-nurse could be hired {{to care for the}} infant. He further offered to halt {{shooting}} if Söderbaum became ill. Harlan later reported that Söderbaum was so upset by the entire affair that she considered fleeing back to her native Sweden to avoid having to play the part of Dorothea. In the end, however, she decided to stay and performed the role.|$|E

5|$|In 1924, the Director of the National Museum of Wales, William Evans Hoyle, {{resigned}} amid ill health. Wheeler applied <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> role of his replacement, providing supportive testimonials from Charles Reed Peers, Robert Bosanquet, and H. J. Fleure. Although he had {{no prior}} museum experience, he was successful in his application and was appointed Director. He then employed a close friend, Cyril Fox, <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> vacated position of Keeper of Archaeology. Wheeler's proposed reforms included extending the institution's reach and influence throughout Wales by building affiliations with regional museums, and focusing on fundraising to finance {{the completion of the}} new museum premises. He obtained a £21,367 donation from the wealthy shipowner William Reardon Smith and appointed Smith to be the museum's treasurer, and also travelled to Whitehall, London, where he successfully urged the British Treasury to provide further funding for the museum. As a result, construction on the museum's new building was able to continue, and it was officially opened by King George V in 1927.|$|E
5|$|In 1996 John Sykes {{decided to}} reactivate Thin Lizzy, {{presenting}} the band {{as a tribute}} to Phil Lynott's life and work. He decided <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> role of lead vocals himself in the absence of Lynott, and persuaded Scott Gorham, Brian Downey and Darren Wharton to return to the fold. To complete the line-up, Marco Mendoza continued in Lynott's role as bass player. They received criticism for using the Thin Lizzy name without Lynott being present, but the band only played hits from Thin Lizzy's back catalogue, and did not compose any new material.|$|E

5|$|Kakashi reveals to Naruto that Minato {{intended}} {{to combine the}} Rasengan with his elemental chakra {{but was unable to}} complete the technique.

In order to perform it, Naruto requires the aid of two shadow clones; he provides the chakra, one clone is responsible for the shape transformation, and the other provides the nature transformation. By manipulating the wind-natured chakra of the Wind Release: Rasengan, Naruto was able to create four large points, causing the Rasengan <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> appearance of a giant fūma shuriken, with the Rasengan in the center remaining a perfect sphere.
