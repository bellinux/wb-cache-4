Ultimately, the two court rulings contributed to the policy being used only against foreign NGOs, while not invoked against U.S. NGOs.President Bill Clinton rescinded the Mexico City policy on January 22, 1993. He referred to the policy as being [...] "excessively broad" [...] and stated that it had [...] "undermined efforts to promote safe and efficacious family planning programs in foreign nations". On January 22, 2001, President George W. Bush reinstated the policy by executive order, stating, [...] "It is my conviction that taxpayer funds {{should not be used}} to pay for abortions or advocate or actively promote abortion, either here or abroad. It is therefore my belief that the Mexico City Policy should be restored". In September 2007, Barbara Boxer, a Senator from California, created an amendment designed to lift <b>the</b> <b>funding</b> <b>conditions</b> put in place by the Mexico City policy. It passed by a vote of 53-41. President Bush promised to veto any legislation which would eliminate the Mexico City policy. The policy was rescinded again by President Barack Obama on January 23, 2009, and further reinstated on January 23, 2017 by President Donald Trump. Trump not only reinstated the policy but expanded it, making it cover all global health organizations that receive U.S. government funding, rather than only family planning organizations that do, as was previously the case.

40|$|Banks in {{the euro}} area {{typically}} hold {{a large amount}} of government debt in their bond portfolios, which are valued both for their low credit risk and high liquidity. During the sovereign debt crisis, these characteristics of government debt were severely impaired in stressed euro area countries. In order to understand the transmission channels of stress from government debt markets to the real economy, we augment a standard dynamic macroeconomic model with a banking sector and a market for government debt characterized by search frictions. A sovereign solvency shock modelled as a haircut on government bonds is introduced to study the interaction of sovereign credit and liquidity risk. As banks react to this shock by rebalancing towards highly liquid short-run assets, such as central bank deposits, demand for government bonds collapses, which endogenously worsens their market liquidity. Thus, a sovereign liquidity risk channel from government bond markets to the real sector emerges. Endogenous government bond liquidity negatively affects <b>the</b> <b>funding</b> <b>conditions</b> of the fiscal sector, tightens financing constraints in the banking sector and lowers investment and output. The model is able to match a number of stylised facts regarding the behaviour of sovereign debt markets during the euro area sovereign debt crisis, such as depressed turnover rates and rising bid-ask spreads...|$|E
30|$|As {{a result}} of {{assuming}} the absence of un-organisation and non-institutionalisation, one is also left to wonder how legal advance planning and the deliberate legal organisation and institutionalisation of the Hybrid Firm as a fully-fledged, fourth-party intermediary may have avoided its rapid demise? As a starting point, paraphrasing Tuunainen (2005 a: 175), {{it is obvious that}} ‘the boundaries separating the [Hybrid Firm] from the university [and the Spin-Off Company became] blurred except from a legal point of view’ (emphasis added). Also, it bears reminding that the task of intermediation was to be ‘done simultaneously in [three] distinct environments’ (Tuunainen 2005 a: 175): the university (with its physical research laboratory, the Department of Plant Production, its technology transfer and licensing office, its central university administration and other research support functions on campus), the Spin-Off Company (with its external management, its outside funders and its physical research facilities removed from the locus of academic research) and, in particular, the publicly funded Finnish technology and innovation agencies that provided both financial grants for the research collaboration as well as express encouragement for the commercialisation of any viable research resulting from such funding. Thus, as part of <b>the</b> <b>funding</b> <b>conditions</b> prescribed by the Academy of Finland, Tekes and/or Sitra, {{it would have been a}} simple, straightforward task to require that the funded academic (but potentially to be commercialised) biotechnology research of the Research Group should be conducted, for example, within a separately organised special-purpose, single-entity, smaller-scale CRC. Instead of an idle wait of 8  years of university-based academic research (1990 to 1998) before the Research Group’s spontaneous commencement of commercialisation efforts through the formation of the Spin-Off Company, a Hybrid Firm entity could have been established from the very outset and legally separated from, but sponsored by, the University of Helsinki, the Research Group, any (later) Spin-Off Company and the public funding agencies in order to provide the most crucial services among such three helices and its stakeholders: dynamic, open-ended, open-textured and ongoing intermediation and hybridisation services that bridged both the formation and performance stages of triple-helix collaboration. Indeed, the funding provided by the Academy of Finland, Tekes and/or Sitra could have been made directly (and only) to such CRC entity, together with funding conditions (i) that all grant-relevant research (whether in furtherance of academic or commercial knowledge production and innovation) was to be conducted either at the CRC or under its direction, (ii) that all new, first-generation, intellectual property (IP) resulting from grant-relevant research was to be owned and primarily valorised by the CRC (i.e. not the university, not the Research Group, not the Research Leader or other individual researches and also not the Spin-Off Company), (iii) that such first-generation IP was to be licensed gratuitously to the university (with a right to sub-license to other non-profit academic institutions) for purposes of further academic-only research and as long as such research was not in competition with, or otherwise impeding any commercialisation of, the CRC’s current or prior research, (iv) that such first-generation IP could also be licensed for market-rate fees to any spin-off company intending to explore commercial applications thereof (including, of course, the actual Spin-Off Company later formed by the Research Group) and (v) that any further academic-only research on the licensed IP leading to new, second-generation IP was to be licensed back to the CRC for purposes of additional research and commercialisation efforts. In other words, one is ultimately also left to wonder whether the efficiency, indeed, the survival of the Hybrid Firm in the Tuunainen case study would have been maximised significantly through the legal introduction and functional ‘interjection’ of a fourth, extra-helical and designated intermediation and hybridisation ‘player.’ The special-purpose, single-entity cooperative research centre suggested above (and by example only) would establish the Hybrid Firm legally and would establish the intermediation function of the Hybrid Firm institutionally. In its suggested format, most likely, the CRC entity would have been jointly owned and operated by the University of Helsinki (represented through one of its subdivisions, possibly, its science park organisation), the Spin-Off Company (which could have been formed right at the outset by the Research Leader and other members of the Research Group for purposes of representing their private personal interests with regard to commercialisation and profit-seeking from their publicly funded but, now, cooperative and fully hybridised research) and one or all of the public funding agencies involved (or any other public designee of the Finnish government as a stakeholder). In addition, the CRC entity would be structured to have its own institutionalised and, now, collectivised and internally intermediated decision-making and governance structure for purposes of providing external intermediation services to the three stakeholder-helices. And it would have its own separated identity, its own voice and its own designated and sui-generis intermediary role to play vis-à-vis and among the three helices.|$|E

40|$|From the {{beginning}} of IMF lending in 1947, the staff understood that countries could have difficulty financing their balance of payments for two reasons: either because their economic policies were inadequate or because of circumstances beyond their control.

Even if {{the root cause of}} the problem was an external shock, such as a weak market for the country’s exports, policies would have to be adjusted to compensate unless the shock was temporary and the gap could be covered by a repayable loan.
