40|$|Over 15 {{years of}} {{research}} at the Department of Mechanical Engineering of K. U. Leuven has resulted {{in the development of the}} high-end Leuven piezomotor. The Leuven motor is an all-in-one coarse/fine positioning device that offers large stroke (> 100 mm), wide speed range (1 nm/s to over 100 mm/s) and atomic resolution (< 1 nm). Moreover, by using reliable piezo transducers and a suitable tribopair, the Leuven motor can easily travel distances over 25 km. The force output of piezomotors can be increased by parallel operation. To serve this purpose, a novel suspension mechanism that supports <b>tandem</b> <b>drive</b> of the Leuven motor is developed. The particular design moreover allows the integration of an additional stepping drive mode. This mode is highly controllable, and therefore e. g. allows stable slow-speed motion. Both the design and initial experimental results of the <b>tandem</b> <b>drive</b> are discussed. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Keywords-drive axle housing; shell element; solid element; {{finite element}} analysis; stress Abstract. The {{finite element model}} of <b>drive</b> axle <b>housing</b> was built by using the solid element and the shell element respectively. Vertical bend {{strength}} and stiffness under 2. 5 times of fully load of the <b>drive</b> axle <b>housing</b> were calculated by finite element method. By comparing {{the results of the}} vertical bend strength and stiffness of both models, we could know that both of the two models can be used to analyze the whole stress situation of <b>drive</b> axle <b>housing.</b> Because there were fewer elements of <b>drive</b> axle <b>housing</b> model based on shell element, the amount of final calculation was less. It is more feasible to analyze the whole stress situation of <b>drive</b> axle <b>housing</b> by establishing <b>drive</b> axle <b>housing</b> based on shell element...|$|R

5000|$|In {{the spring}} of 1958, Scania-Vabis {{introduced}} {{a new generation of}} trucks, with newly designed six-cylinder engines, stronger chassis components and a new, more spacious and comfortable cab. The cab would be used for all conventional trucks until 1980. The largest model, called L75, had a ten litre engine. The truck was also offered with a trailing axle. This version was called the LS75, with an “S” for [...] "support axle". For real heavy duty work Scania-Vabis offered a version with <b>tandem</b> <b>drive</b> rear axles. It was called LT75, with “T” for [...] "tandem". The L75 series trucks came with air brakes, but power steering was still an option. From 1961 the truck was offered with a turbo-diesel.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Based on ABAQUS, {{the strain}} and {{stress on the}} <b>drive</b> axle <b>housing</b> is {{obtained}} by the static analyses. Through the model analysis, the inherent frequencies and mode shapes of front 10 order modes are obtained respectively. According to damage accumulation theory and the rain-flow counting method, and the amplitudes and mean values of counted cycles can be determined. Fatigue analysis of automotive <b>drive</b> axle <b>housing</b> under the sine load spectrum are analyzed by applying ABAQUS/FE-SAFE software, and the overall fatigue life contours and distribution of hazardous area are obtained. Under the results of analysis, the improved design of automotive <b>drive</b> axle <b>housing</b> is made.
