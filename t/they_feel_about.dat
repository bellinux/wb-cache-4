Joey Travolta first met Cross at a program Travolta led teaching the art of filmmaking to children with special needs. He helped educate Cross about filmmaking, and the documentary was expanded into a feature-length film.

500|$|Speaking {{about the}} siege of Riverrun, Weiss noted about Brienne and Jaime's reunion that [...] "Jaime didn't expect to see Brienne {{necessarily}} ever again, he certainly didn't expect to see her marching into his military camp. And his relationship is obviously very complicated, and fraught, and has undercurrents that he's uncomfortable with feeling." [...] Benioff continued about Brienne's escape, [...] "It's these two who are not quite sure how <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> the other, and he lets her go. He'd be well within his rights to send his men after her, to capture her, and it wouldn't be that hard to capture her since she's being slowly rowed away by Podrick, but he doesn't. She might technically be an enemy now that she's serving Sansa Stark, who is still obviously a suspect in Joffrey's murder, but she's not Jaime's enemy." ...|$|E
500|$|Upon Blaine's first appearance, Criss {{described}} his character {{as being a}} [...] "very charismatic, put-together, composed guy." [...] He stated that although Blaine is gay, he is not [...] "overly queeny, and not too butch either," [...] and that while his sexuality is a [...] "huge part of who he is", {{it is not a}} major facet of how he wishes to be perceived. Due to similarities which stem from their shared sexuality, Blaine [...] "sees a lot of himself in Kurt, in terms of experiences and the way <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> the world around them. He feels the need to impart his knowledge, be a source of strength for him, and really help him through what he's going through." [...] Initially, Criss felt that the most important element of his character was to give Kurt [...] "someone he can relate to", and demonstrate that Kurt could have [...] "a young out male friend, a support system".|$|E

500|$|In [...] "Dance with Somebody", Kurt {{feels that}} Blaine has been distant, and confides in {{a boy named}} Chandler he meets at the local music store. The two hit it off {{instantly}} with their common interest of moving to New York after high school. Kurt begins texting Chandler quite often soon after that. Rachel thinks he's being in the wrong that Kurt is cheating on Blaine instead of talking to Blaine about the rut they are in. Blaine finds out about Chandler and is extremely hurt. Both Kurt and Blaine sing Whitney songs to express how <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> their situation with Blaine singing It's Not Right but It's Okay and Kurt singing I Have Nothing as an apology. Eventually after having a talk in Emma's office, the two make up and are stronger than ever.

500|$|Sean Kinney {{said about}} the new album and the fans' mixed {{reactions}} about the band moving on after Staley's death: [...] "Look, it’s a big move to fucking stand up and move on. Some people, the music connected with them so strongly, their opinions, how <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> it... It’s amazing that they have such a connection {{but they seem to}} act like it happened to them. This happened to us and Layne’s family, not them. This is actually our lives. If we’re okay with it, why can’t you be? This happened to us, this didn’t happen to you. But this album isn’t about that, it’s a bigger universal point. We’re all going to fucking die, we’re all going to lose somebody, and it fucking hurts. How do you move on? This record is us moving on, and hurting. That, to me, is a victory. I already feel like I’ve won." [...] "Sometimes people ask us, ‘Wouldn’t Layne have been pissed off that we did this?’ And I tell them {{it would have been the}} opposite: he would have been pissed off that it took us so long to do this. We’re not doing this for money; there is no money in the music business anymore. Jerry and I funded the whole album, and we spent lots of our own money, because we believe in this. And one of the reasons I’m doing this is so more light is turned on to something where the light was turned off." [...] And Cantrell added: [...] "We’ve toured around the world, we’ve lost some friends, we buried a dear friend, and somebody that you just can’t fucking replace, and then we’ve chosen by circumstance to get together again. That turned into ‘maybe we can fucking do this.’ And that turned into this".|$|E

Dale, in which the Court ruled that the Boy Scouts organization {{had the right to}} expel Dale for revealing that he was gay through their First Amendment rights. The justices questioned Wolfson [...] "aggressively." [...] The Court ruled 5-4 against Dale, but Wolfson, said, [...] "Even before we change the [...] policy, we are succeeding in getting people to rethink how <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> gay people."

I am not a monster, but I have not felt exactly what other women feel--or say they feel, for fear of being thought unlike others.

I feel many things that I cannot understand. A fatal illness has been growing in me for a year. I shall very likely not live another year. I will not deny anything I have done. I will not pretend to love where I have no love. But shadows are rising round me. Sickness makes them. If I have wronged the dead--I have but little time to do what I left undone." ...|$|E
