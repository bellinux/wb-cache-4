25|$|Press fit are {{available}} in two types with liners or without (wearing bushings). Liner bushings, sometimes called master bushings, are permanently installed into <b>the</b> <b>jig</b> and accept liners that can easily be replaced. Press-fit wearing bushings are used in short run applications or in applications where the tolerance on a hole location is so tight that it cannot facilitate {{the use of a}} liner bushing.|$|E
25|$|A {{common problem}} {{encountered}} is when {{two or more}} holes are too close for independent standard bushings. In this case one large renewable bushing {{can be made with}} two (or more) holes in the proper location (the first example in the image). Another possibility is to make a custom bushing with an eccentric hole and then notches {{on the outside of the}} head are used to locate the proper position of the bushing for each location (the middle example in the image). Another common need for a custom bushing is when the hole needed is perpendicular jig plate; in this case a bracket bushing is used. It is a hardened piece of right angle steel that bolts to <b>the</b> <b>jig</b> plate and is located with dowel pins.|$|E
25|$|In his time, Kempe was {{as famous}} for his stage jigs as for his acting in regular drama. <b>The</b> <b>jig,</b> a kind of rustic cousin to commedia dell'arte, {{featured}} {{as many as five}} performers in a partially improvised song-and-dance routine. Jigs had plots, often bawdy, but the emphasis was on dancing and physical comedy. Two of Kempe's jigs survive in English, and two more in German. Examples of the jigs may be seen in the manuscript collection of John Dowland (now in the Cambridge University Library). A famous 17th century jig called Kemp's Jig was named after Will Kempe and was published in the first book of John Playford's The English Dancing Master of 1651. The tune has received a number of modern renditions, including those by Jan Akkerman and Gryphon.|$|E

25|$|Renewable {{bushings}} must {{be secured}} in their liner bushing, otherwise the tool can cause it to spin, which rapidly wears out the liner, or chips can force the bushing out of the liner. There are {{many different types of}} locking systems for renewable bushings. One system is a dog, which is a collar that is pressed over the head of the bushing and has a long tail. The tail may be bent at the end so it can lock around the edge of <b>the</b> <b>jig</b> plate or it may be left straight if it can butt up against another object. Another option to keep the renewable bushing from rotating is to pin it, either by putting a pin in the renewable bushing and a hole in the liner or vice versa. A more complicated version uses a hole in the bushing collar and a pin with a head; the head on the pin holds the edge of the collar down, but for removal the bushing can be rotated so that the hole lines up with the pin.|$|E
