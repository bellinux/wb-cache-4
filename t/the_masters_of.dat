5|$|His family's nobility {{and wealth}} {{allowed him to}} fully pursue his {{inclination}} toward education. He learned music from <b>the</b> <b>masters</b> <b>of</b> the time (Damon or Pythocleides could have been his teacher) and he is considered {{to have been the}} first politician to attribute importance to philosophy. He enjoyed the company of the philosophers Protagoras, Zeno of Elea, and Anaxagoras. Anaxagoras, in particular, became a close friend and influenced him greatly.|$|E
5|$|The Minister Steward (Shaofu 少府), {{also known}} as the Privy Treasurer and Small Treasurer, served the emperor exclusively, {{providing}} him with entertainment and amusements, proper food and clothing, medicine and physical care, valuables and equipment. For this purpose he was given responsibility for the emperor's personal finances during Western Han, yet this responsibility was transferred to the Minister of Finance during Eastern Han. Although he was not a castrated eunuch, many of his subordinates were, since his ministry managed the imperial harem housing concubines. His secretaries were headed by a Prefect of <b>the</b> <b>Masters</b> <b>of</b> Writing (Shangshu ling 尚書令). The secretaries were responsible for relaying all written messages to the emperor, official correspondence with Excellencies, senior ministers, provincial authorities, common people who submitted memorials to the throne, and non-Han-Chinese peoples within and outside the empire. Since <b>the</b> <b>Masters</b> <b>of</b> Writing were not eunuchs, and thus not allowed into the imperial harem, Emperor Wu established an all-eunuch office of secretaries for the inner palace, which was abolished in 29 BC.|$|E

5|$|As {{with other}} forms {{with a long}} history in many languages, many {{variations}} have been developed, including forms with a quasi-musical poetic diction in Urdu. Ghazals have a classical affinity with Sufism, and a number of major Sufi religious works are written in ghazal form. The relatively steady meter {{and the use of the}} refrain produce an incantatory effect, which complements Sufi mystical themes well. Among <b>the</b> <b>masters</b> <b>of</b> the form is Rumi, a 13th-century Persian poet.|$|E

5|$|Krishna worship or reverence {{has been}} adopted by several new {{religious}} movements since the 19thcentury, and he is sometimes {{a member of an}} eclectic pantheon in occult texts, along with Greek, Buddhist, biblical, and even historical figures. For instance, Édouard Schuré, an influential figure in perennial philosophy and occult movements, considered Krishna a Great Initiate, while Theosophists regard Krishna as an incarnation of Maitreya (one of <b>the</b> <b>Masters</b> <b>of</b> the Ancient Wisdom), the most important spiritual teacher for humanity along with Buddha.|$|E
5|$|More recent {{research}} from art historians such as Lorne Campbell relies on X-ray and infrared photography {{to develop an}} understanding of the techniques and materials used by the painters. The conservation of the Ghent Altarpiece in the mid-1950s pioneered methodologies and scholarship in technical studies. Examination of paint layers and underlayers was later applied to other Netherlandish works, allowing for more accurate attributions. Van Eyck's work, for example, typically shows underdrawings unlike Christus' work. These discoveries, too, hint at the relationships between <b>the</b> <b>masters</b> <b>of</b> the first rank and those in the following generations, with Memling's underdrawings clearly showing van der Weyden's influence.|$|E
5|$|The Scrutineers add {{up all of}} the votes, and the Revisers {{check the}} ballots and the names on the Scrutineers' lists to ensure that no error was made.

50|$|In contrast, the illuminations {{reflect the}} work of at least six {{different}} hands. The art historian Walter Oakeshott first identified and named these artists in 1945, referring to them as <b>the</b> <b>Master</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Leaping Figures, <b>the</b> <b>Master</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Apocrypha Drawings, <b>the</b> <b>Master</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Genesis Initial, <b>the</b> <b>Master</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Amalekite, <b>the</b> <b>Master</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Morgan Leaf, and <b>the</b> <b>Master</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gothic Majesty. Close examination of the illustration often reveals {{the work of}} two separate hands, with one providing the original sketch or design and the other painting in the colour and details.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> roots <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Master</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Aachen Altar in Cologne {{painting}} is beyond question. His proximity to <b>the</b> <b>Master</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Holy Clan, which is clear both in stylistic matters {{and in the}} adoption of subjects and motifs, leads to the assumption that <b>the</b> <b>Master</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Aachen Altar was educated in <b>the</b> workshop <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Master</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Holy Clan. <b>The</b> <b>Master</b> <b>of</b> St Severin also had an important influence on <b>the</b> <b>Master</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Aachen Altar, as similarities in their figures and painting methods indicate. A partnership as journeymen in this workshop is possible. The mature works <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Master</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Aachen Altar, such as the Mary panels, show clear influence from <b>the</b> <b>Master</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Saint Bartholomew Altarpiece. Further afield, the painter has taken important hints from the Netherlandish painters, such as the art of Hugo van der Goes.|$|R

5|$|The Imperial Counselor {{transmitted}} {{and received}} imperial edicts {{to and from}} the chancellery and also presented officials' memorials to the throne. During Western Han, the Palace Assistant Imperial Clerk's office was located within the walls of the palace. He had the authority to investigate attendants and eunuchs of the palace and to reject improperly written memorials before submission to the Imperial Counselor. <b>The</b> <b>Masters</b> <b>of</b> Writing under the Minister Steward then processed these memorials before they were sent to the throne. The Palace Assistant Imperial Clerk's proximity to the emperor during Eastern Han allowed him to surpass the authority of his nominal superior, the Excellency of Works, yet his Western-Han-era power to inspect local provincial authorities was removed. The Minister Steward—who was supervised by the Imperial Counselor (and later Excellency of Works)—became the Palace Assistant Imperial Clerk's new superior by early Eastern Han. The Palace Assistant Imperial Clerk also managed the Imperial Library in both Western and Eastern Han, this duty being transferred to a subordinate of the Minister of Ceremonies in 159 AD.|$|E
5|$|The Inn {{is run by}} Pension, its {{ultimate}} governing body. The name is peculiar to Gray's Inn—at Lincoln's Inn the governing body is called the Council, and at the Inner and Middle Temples {{it is called the}} Parliament. The name was used for the governing bodies of three of the Inns of Chancery—Barnard's Inn, Clement's Inn and New Inn. In Gray's Inn the Readers, when they existed, were required to attend Pension meetings, and other barristers were at one point welcome to, although only the Readers would be allowed to speak. Pension at Gray's Inn is made up of <b>the</b> <b>Masters</b> <b>of</b> the Bench, and the Inn as a whole is headed by the Treasurer, a senior Bencher. The Treasurer has always been elected, and since 1744 the office has rotated between individuals, with a term of one year.|$|E
5|$|The {{release of}} Invincible {{was preceded by}} a dispute between Jackson and his record label, Sony Music Entertainment. Jackson had {{expected}} the licenses to <b>the</b> <b>masters</b> <b>of</b> his albums to revert to him {{some time in the}} early 2000s, after which {{he would be able to}} promote the material however he pleased and keep the profits; however, clauses in the contract set the revert date years into the future. Jackson discovered that the attorney who had represented him in the deal had also been representing Sony. He was also concerned that for years Sony had been pressuring him to sell his share in its music catalog venture; he feared that Sony might have had a conflict of interest, since if Jackson's career failed, he would have had to sell his share of the catalog at a low price. Jackson sought an early exit from his contract.|$|E

5|$|While Aeron {{is within}} the Towers, a time counter is displayed, showing the {{advancement}} of Elena's curse. As Aeron defeats both normal enemies and <b>the</b> <b>Masters</b> <b>of</b> each Tower, he gathers flesh from them which he must give to Elena to eat and reverse the curse's effects, resetting the timer: the amount of reversion {{is dependent on the}} quality of flesh, which deteriorates over time after being extracted. Elena's state is also tied to the Affinity gauge; giving her flesh, talking with her, giving her gifts and asking her to help with tasks raise the meter, but delaying reverting Elena's transformation causes it to decrease. The strength of Aeron's relationship with Elena directly impacts the game's ending. Items and equipment are created and stored in the Observatory, with Mavda using materials brought back from the Towers to create new equipment for Aeron. She can also repair equipment that has been damaged in combat while equipped to Aeron, and upgrade existing weapons and equipment with new materials. If the time limit is exceeded and Elena completes her transformation, or Aeron falls in battle, the game ends and restarts from the last active save.|$|E
5|$|November 27, 1888: Petition {{from the}} King of Rurutu and the Queen of Rimatara and their nobles to Her Most Gracious Majesty Queen Victoria, {{and to the}} Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. May you have good health. We, Teuruarii, King of Rurutu and Te Maere, Queen of Rimatara and our nobles, ask for the Prime Minister to place our islands and our ships under the {{protection}} of the British flag. These are the islands, namely, Rurutu, Rimatara, and Marià, and there are the names of the ships: Faaito and Ronui, and <b>the</b> <b>masters</b> <b>of</b> the same are natives. This is our word to you: Do not forsake us; we are your children; you taught us the word of God, and that has led us in the path of civilisation; therefore we know that you are a good parent to us. The thoughts of the children cling fondly to their good parent; they do not wish to be separated from their good parent. If the parent forsake the children, the children will seek the parent; so do we; we are like those children, and we ask that you will give us your flag to protect us. We have heard that you have taken Rarotonga and the neighbouring islands under your protection, but we remain without anyone to protect us. When we received the news that Rarotonga and the neighbouring islands were placed under your protection, we wept aloud because we were forsaken by you; we were afraid lest we should be adopted by another parent. The strange parent we mean is the French. They did not feed us with the milk of the gospel, but you did. O Great Britain; you fed us with that milk which has given life to us. This is our last word to you; we do not wish for French annexation or protection, not at all, but we wish you to be our parent, O Great Britain. We pray you now to accede to this our request. This letter was written in the house of Queen Pa. -TEURUARII, TE MAERE ARII.|$|E
