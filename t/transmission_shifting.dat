25|$|The Edsel {{offers several}} {{features}} that were considered innovative for the time, including its rolling-dome speedometer; warning lights for such conditions as low oil level, parking brake engaged, and engine overheating; and its push-button Teletouch <b>transmission</b> <b>shifting</b> {{system in the}} center of the steering wheel (a conventional column-shift automatic was also available at a reduced price). Other Edsel design innovations include ergonomically designed controls for the driver and self-adjusting brakes (which Ford claimed for the Edsel as a first for the industry, even though Studebaker had pioneered them earlier in the decade). The Edsel also offers such features, advanced for the time, as seat belts (which were available at extra cost as optional equipment on many other makes) and child-proof rear door locks that could only be unlocked with the key.|$|E
25|$|At its debut, {{the fourth}} {{generation}} model {{was shown in}} rear-wheel drive GS 350 (GRL10) form, powered by a V6 engine linked with a six-speed automatic transmission. Three driving modes are featured, ranging from fuel-conserving Eco to Sport S and Sport S+ which facilitate more sporty <b>transmission</b> <b>shifting</b> and engine throttle settings, as well as suspension damper and steering adjustments. The chassis has been redesigned, and overall curb weight is reduced. To reduce unsprung mass the new GS utilizes aluminum for all its suspension components. The GS 350 F Sport adds a rear-wheel steering system for improved handling on rear wheel drive models. New larger 14-inch brakes come standard as well as 19-inch F Sport wheels, a new front bumper, rear spoiler, F Sport steering wheel, F Sport seats and a new suspension system with AVS adjustable dampers.|$|E

50|$|Shift by wire is {{the system}} by which the {{transmission}} modes are engaged/changed in an automobile through electronic controls without any mechanical linkage between the gear shifting lever and the transmission. The <b>transmission</b> <b>shifting</b> was traditionally accomplished by mechanical links to put the vehicle in Park, Reverse, Neutral and Drive positions through a lever mounted on the steering column or a gear shifter near the center console.|$|E
50|$|Toyota {{announced}} a voluntary recall of 2005 to 2008 Toyota Corollas and Matrixes equipped with 1ZZ-FE engines. The issue involves the engine control module, and includes {{the potential for}} it to develop a crack on the module's circuit board, which can result in the car not starting, the <b>transmission</b> <b>shifting</b> harshly, or the engine stalling. Additionally, Pontiac {{announced a}} voluntary recall of Pontiac Vibes from years 2005 to 2008 for the same issue.|$|E
50|$|Generally speaking, {{overdrive}} is {{the highest}} gear in the transmission. Overdrive allows the engine to operate at a lower RPM for a given road speed. This allows the vehicle to achieve better fuel efficiency, and often quieter operation on the highway. When it is switched on, an automatic transmission can shift into overdrive mode after a certain speed is reached (usually 70+ km/h mph or more depending on the load). When it is off, the automatic <b>transmission</b> <b>shifting</b> {{is limited to the}} lower gears. Overdrive should usually be selected when the average speed is above 70 km/h (40-45 mph).|$|E
50|$|Shift quality: Shift {{quality is}} the driver’s {{perception}} of the vehicle to an automatic <b>transmission</b> <b>shift</b> event. This {{is influenced by the}} powertrain (engine, transmission), and the vehicle (driveline, suspension, engine and powertrain mounts, etc.) Shift feel is both a tactile (felt) and audible (heard) response of the vehicle. Shift quality is experienced as various events: <b>Transmission</b> <b>shifts</b> are felt as an upshift at acceleration (1-2), or a downshift maneuver in passing (4-2). Shift engagements of the vehicle are also evaluated, as in Park to Reverse, etc.|$|R

5000|$|All {{automatics}} {{use some}} sort of manual override of the transmission, with numbered positions in descending order marked below (or to the right) of [...] "Drive", which will prevent the <b>transmission</b> <b>shifting</b> to a gear higher than the selected, but maintaining automatic operation between all lesser numbered gears. Such gates will appear as [...] "P-R-N-D-3-2-1" [...] for example. On some vehicles (mainly Japanese makes such as Honda, Toyota and Lexus being good examples) these numbered positions are replaced by a single [...] "L" [...] (for [...] "Low") position, which will hold the transmission in whatever lower ratio is required for climbing steep grades or for heavy acceleration.|$|E
5000|$|Manumatic {{refers to}} an {{automatic}} transmission that allows convenient driver control of gear selection. For most of automotive history, automatic transmissions already allowed some control of gear selection using the console or column shifter, usually to limit the <b>transmission</b> <b>shifting</b> beyond a certain gear (allowing engine braking on downhills) and/or locking out the use of overdrive gears when towing. Manumatics enhanced such features by providing either steering wheel mounted paddle shifters or a modified shift lever, allowing the driver to enter a [...] "manual mode" [...] and select any available gear, usually in a sequential [...] "upshift/downshift" [...] manner. Different car manufacturers {{use a variety of}} labels for their manumatic transmissions, such as ''''Tiptronic'''', 'Geartronic', ''''Touchshift'''', 'Sportronic', 'clutchless-manual' and others.|$|E

5000|$|The SBEC {{controlled}} the ignition, {{as well as}} the opening and closing of the fuel injectors. During cold startup, wide-open throttle and deceleration, it did this based on [...] "open-loop", pre-programmed operating parameters. During normal idle and cruising, it began [...] "closed-loop" [...] operation, during which the module acted based upon inputs from a variety of sensors. The basic sensors that provided input to the SBEC included the Oxygen sensor (O2), Manifold Absolute Pressure (MAP) sensor, Throttle Position Sensor (TPS), Intake Air Temperature (IAT) sensor and Coolant Temperature sensor (CTS). The basic actuators controlled by the SBEC's outputs included the fuel injectors, ignition coil and pickup, and the Idle Air Control (IAC) valve. The latter controlled idle characteristics. However, the SBEC also {{controlled the}} operation of the charging system, air conditioning system, cruise control and, in some vehicles, <b>transmission</b> <b>shifting.</b> By centralizing control of these systems, the operation of the vehicle was simplified and streamlined.|$|E
50|$|The fully {{electronic}} control {{is accomplished by}} the Transmission Control Module (TCM). Depending on year and application, it can either be a stand-alone module or integrated with the Powertrain Control Module (PCM). The TCM uses data from various transmission and engine sensors to control <b>transmission</b> <b>shifting.</b> The TCM operates the solenoid pack to change hydraulic flow through the valve body to various clutches in the transmission. The solenoid pack is mounted directly to the valve body; its connector protrudes from a hole {{on the left side}} of the transmission. On the 45 and 545RFE the hydraulic control system design (without electronic assist) provides the transmission with PARK, REVERSE, NEUTRAL, SECOND, and THIRD gears, based solely on driver shift lever selection. This design allows the vehicle to be driven (in “limp-in” mode) in the event of an {{electronic control}} system failure, or a situation that the Transmission Control Module (TCM) recognizes as potentially damaging to the transmission. On the 68RFE, fourth gear is used for limp-in instead of second and third.|$|E

50|$|In 2014 GM has {{recalled}} the vehicle regarding {{a condition in}} which the <b>transmission</b> <b>shift</b> cable may fracture. The fracture prevents the driver from selecting gears and may cause the vehicle to move in an unintended direction.|$|R
30|$|As {{shown in}} Figure  6, the {{simulation}} and experimental results consist well with each other. Both curves from simulations and experiments {{are similar to}} pulse curves. However, {{the tops of the}} experimental curves are not quite stable comparing to the simulation ones. The reason for the instability is high stiffness of hydraulic system. There will be disturbance when the pistons of pneumatic- hydraulic <b>transmission</b> sharply <b>shift.</b> In addition, slight lag happens when the <b>transmission</b> <b>shifts</b> phase, and that is because in the hydraulic chambers the left hydraulic fluid left blocks the motion of the pistons.|$|R
5000|$|The {{shifting}} sequence {{was very}} different and much rougher than the Hydra-Matics that preceded it, or the Super Turbines and Turbo Hydramatics that followed it. The shift from 1st to 2nd or 2nd to 3rd range was long and drawn-out, ending with a harsh shift. The reason for this was that three things were happening. Not only was the <b>transmission</b> <b>shifting</b> to a very much higher range ( [...] 2.93 to 1.56, {{but it was also}} simultaneously emptying the fluid coupling and making a mechanical lock-up. The wide gap in the reduction ratio between first and second gears combined with the direct mechanical connection to the engine to create a shift that could be firm enough to lug the engine. Because of the mechanical lock-up, there was sometimes a shudder felt as the transmission shifted into third gear (fourth range) by refilling the fluid coupling. Direct drive (1:1 ratio) is achieved by splitting engine power between the fluid coupling (used for first gear) and the front clutch (used for second gear), which are both applied to provide third gear, effectively locking the planetary gearsets and forcing them to spin at engine speed. The design is unique in that it provides third gear by applying first and second gears at the same time.|$|E
40|$|In {{the first}} two {{chapters}} of this report, the development of discrete compression brake and transmission models is explained. In the vehicle model development, special efforts {{have been put in}} <b>transmission</b> <b>shifting</b> scheduling. Transmission up-shift and down-shift scheduling are separated in the modelling. Hysteresis during shifting is introduced to reduce chattering. A compression brake effect on <b>transmission</b> <b>shifting</b> is identified and considered in the modelling. The new <b>transmission</b> <b>shifting</b> model has been validated through experimental data. The <b>transmission</b> <b>shifting</b> model is combined with the compression brake model and the model of the longitudinal vehicle dynamics for a high-fidelity predictive simulation software tool. Power-width-modulation (PWM) actuation for brake coordination is proposed to further exploit the capacity of the compression brake and reduce the usage of service brake. Simulation results indicates that the PWM actuation strategy will have the same speed regulation performance as the direct torque split strategy, while the usage of the service brake is significantly reduced, and the compression brake can handle a down slope of - 4 when tracking a speed of 56 mile per hour. Simulation results also indicated the importance of vehicle mass and road grade estimation in controller performance. The estimation problem is addressed in detail next. In the third chapter, a recursive least square scheme with multiple forgetting factors is proposed for on-line estimation of road grade and vehicle mass. The estimated mass and grade can be used to robustify many automatic controllers in conventional or automated heavy-duty vehicles. We demonstrate with measured test data from the July 26 - 27, 2002 test dates in San Diego, CA, that the proposed scheme estimates mass within 5 % of its actual value and tracks grade with good accuracy. The experimental setup, signals, their source and their accuracy are discussed. Issues like lack of persistent excitations in certain parts of the run or difficulties of parameter tracking during gear shift are explained and suggestions to bypass these problems are made. In the final part of this work, an adaptive model predictive control scheme is designed for speed control of heavy vehicles. The controller coordinates use of compression brakes and service brakes on downhill slopes. The advantage of model predictive control (MPC) scheme over PI design is its ability to explicitly handle the constraints on service brake and compression command. MPC minimizes use of service brakes based on constrain optimization techniques. Given a perfect model, good performance was obtained in closedloop. We showed with simulation analysis that model uncertainties due to uncertainty in vehicle mass result in degraded and sometimes poor oscillatory closed-loop response. Unknown road disturbance (grade) was another limiting factor to the performance of the controller. It is shown that accurate estimate of mass is necessary for safe and comfortable operation in closed-loop. Also knowledge of the road grade can improve the results further by contributing in feedforward control. Therefore the estimation method presented in the third chapter of the report is used in parallel with the controller to update the estimates of mass and road grade. We show that adaptation allows robust speed tracking even if initial mass is 300 percent over or underestimated. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Erythropoietin (EPO) {{improves}} cognition {{of human}} {{subjects in the}} clinical setting by as yet unknown mechanisms. We developed a mouse model of robust cognitive improvement by EPO to obtain the first clues of how EPO influences cognition, and how it may act on hippocampal neurons to modulate plasticity. Results We show here that a 3 -week treatment of young mice with EPO enhances long-term potentiation (LTP), a cellular correlate of learning processes in the CA 1 region of the hippocampus. This treatment concomitantly alters short-term synaptic plasticity and synaptic <b>transmission,</b> <b>shifting</b> the balance of excitatory and inhibitory activity. These effects are accompanied by an improvement of hippocampus dependent memory, persisting for 3 weeks after termination of EPO injections, and are independent of changes in hematocrit. Networks of EPO-treated primary hippocampal neurons develop lower overall spiking activity but enhanced bursting in discrete neuronal assemblies. At the level of developing single neurons, EPO treatment reduces the typical increase in excitatory synaptic transmission without changing the number of synaptic boutons, consistent with prolonged functional silencing of synapses. Conclusion We conclude that EPO improves hippocampus dependent memory by modulating plasticity, synaptic connectivity and activity of memory-related neuronal networks. These mechanisms of action of EPO have to be further exploited for treating neuropsychiatric diseases. </p...|$|E

MMAS is used to search the optimal initial weights and thresholds of back-propagation (BP) neural networks.
