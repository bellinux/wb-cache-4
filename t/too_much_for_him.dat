5|$|In 1951, Soedjatmoko {{moved to}} Washington D.C. to {{establish}} the political desk at the Indonesian embassy there; he also became Alternate Permanent Representative of Indonesia at the UN. This busy schedule, demanding a commute between three cities, proved to be <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> and {{he dropped out of}} the Littauer Center. In late 1951, he resigned from his positions and went to Europe for nine months, seeking political inspiration. In Yugoslavia, he met Milovan Djilas, who impressed him greatly.|$|E
5|$|A {{golf course}} was {{constructed}} alongside the castle in 1900, and the estate was later sold to Sir Arthur Sutherland, a wealthy shipowner, in 1919. Sutherland opened an additional {{course at the}} castle in 1922, designed by the Scottish golfer, James Braid. The costs of maintaining the property became <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> and, after undertaking eight years of clearance work in the 1920s, he placed the castle into the guardianship {{of the state in}} 1930, with the Commissioners of Works taking control of the property. Archaeological investigations were carried out as part of the clearance work by H. Honeyman in 1929, exposing more of the main gatehouse, and further work was carried out under Robert Bosanquet in the 1930s. Aerial photography was carried out by Walter de Aitchison for the Ordnance Survey.|$|E
5|$|Between 1974 and 1977, Boycott {{elected to}} make himself {{unavailable}} for England. He claimed in 2006 that he had simply lost his appetite for Test cricket and the stress became <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> Boycott's biographer, McKinstry, speculates that the self-imposed exile {{may also have been}} linked to the appointments of Mike Denness and then Tony Greig to the England captaincy, in preference to Boycott. Boycott was very critical of Denness's captaincy and his standard of batting in his autobiography in 1987, citing it as a factor in his decision, along with the pressures at Yorkshire. His weak immune system was a recurring motivation for not touring the Indian subcontinent. This period of exile coincided with the peaks of several fast bowlers' careers, including Dennis Lillee, Jeff Thomson, Andy Roberts, and Michael Holding. However, he later came back to face the West Indies pace battery at its most fearsome in the late 70s and early 80s.|$|E
60|$|Peter Gubbins, with 'is arm {{tied up in}} a sling, was the fust one to turn up at the Cauliflower, and he {{was that}} down-'arted about it we couldn't do nothing with 'im.

5|$|In Cú Chulainn's youth {{he is so}} {{beautiful}} the Ulstermen worry that, without a wife of his own, he will steal their wives and ruin their daughters. They search all over Ireland for a suitable wife for him, but he will have none but Emer, daughter of Forgall Monach. However, Forgall is opposed to the match. He suggests that Cú Chulainn should train in arms with the renowned warrior-woman Scáthach {{in the land of}} Alba (Scotland), hoping the ordeal will be <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> and he will be killed. Cú Chulainn takes up the challenge, travelling to her residence Dún Scáith (Fortress of Shadows) on the Isle of Skye. In the meantime, Forgall offers Emer to Lugaid mac Nóis, a king of Munster, but when he hears that Emer loves Cú Chulainn, Lugaid refuses her hand.|$|E
5|$|Thi {{publicly}} disassociated {{himself from}} the Struggle Movement. However, he remained in I Corps and was still regarded as a significant political influence and motivating factor for the Struggle Movement. Regardless of what he may have thought, the discontent against Kỳ was by then <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to control {{even if he had}} wanted to. By June, ARVN loyalists, {{with the help of the}} American forces, prevailed. Their superior numbers convinced many in the Struggle Movement to back down and realign with the government, and those who refused were militarily defeated, often in bitter street-to-street fighting. While the Struggle Movement was finally ebbing away, Thi agreed to meet with Kỳ at an American air base in Chu Lai to reach a settlement, seeing as the junta was going to prevail in any case. Thi agreed to the original offers of subsidies and the cover story of a medical trip.|$|E
5|$|Carlton {{then turned}} his {{attention}} to the other six residents, pouring gasoline underneath the door of the far end of the residence and setting it on fire. Draftsman Herbert Fritz managed to break open a window and escape, though he broke his arm in the process. Carlton then entered the other dining room and killed Brodelle. He then hid, waiting for the other residents to try to escape. As foreman William Weston and his 13-year-old son Ernest ran through the door, Carlton attacked with the hatchet. The Westons escaped, but Ernest died from his wounds hours later. Carlton sought out the final two residents, laborer Thomas Brunker and gardener David Lindblom. Brunker and Lindblom managed to fight off Carlton and escape, but died days later from their burns and injuries. With the house empty, Carlton ran to the basement and into a fireproof furnace chamber. He brought a small vial of hydrochloric acid with him as a fallback plan in case the heat became <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to handle. Carlton did attempt suicide by swallowing the acid, but it failed to kill him.|$|E
60|$|Bill 'ad {{intended}} {{to lay up}} for another week, and the doctor, wot 'ad been calling twice a day, said he wouldn't be responsible for 'is life if he didn't; but the ten pounds was <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>'im,</b> and one evening, just a week arter the accident, he turned up at this Cauliflower public-'ouse and began to spend 'is money.|$|R
60|$|Henery Walker started raving ag'in, and for {{the next}} few days he tried his 'ardest to get a few words with 'is great-uncle, but Bob Pretty was <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>'im.</b> Everybody in Claybury said wot a shame it was, but it was all no good, and Henery Walker used to leave 'is work and stand outside Bob Pretty's for hours at a time in the 'opes of getting a word with the old man.|$|R

25|$|An early form of {{advertising}} occurred in 1911 when Tetley challenged escape artist Harry Houdini {{to escape from}} a padlocked metal cask of ale.

25|$|After working {{six years}} in Auburn, the restless son of Sacagawea left in search of riches in the gold mines of Montana. He was 61 years old, and the trip was <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> He became ill with {{pneumonia}} and died in a remote area near Danner, Oregon, on May 16, 1866.|$|E
25|$|Blunden {{retired in}} 1964 {{and settled in}} Suffolk. In 1966, he was {{nominated}} for the Oxford Professorship of Poetry in succession to Graves; with some misgivings, he agreed to stand and was elected by a large majority over the other candidate, Robert Lowell. However, he now found the strain of public lecturing <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> and after two years, he resigned.|$|E
60|$|But, if {{he thinks}} so, it is a mistake. He can never suffer the extreme of misery, because {{the tone of his}} whole being is <b>too</b> <b>much</b> subdued <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to feel {{anything}} acutely.|$|R
60|$|Peter {{looked at}} 'im in surprise, {{but that was}} Sam all over. The idea o' knowing a man with money was <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>'im,</b> and he sat there giving good advice to Peter about 'is {{behavior}} until Peter didn't {{know whether it was}} 'is uncle or Sam's. 'Owever, he took the room and wrote the letter, and next arternoon at three o'clock Mr. Goodman came in a four- wheel cab with a big bag and a fat umbrella. A short, stiffish-built man of about sixty he was, with 'is top lip shaved and a bit o' short gray beard. He 'ad on a top 'at and a tail-coat, black kid gloves and a little black bow, and he didn't answer the cabman back a single word.|$|R

25|$|In October, Snow Patrol {{embarked}} on a second European Tour. The tour saw them visit countries like Norway, Denmark, Switzerland, Austria, Germany and France. Artists like The Cinematics, Declan O'Rourke, Asyl and Joseph D'Anvers supported the band throughout the tour on different dates. Midway through the tour, Paul Wilson injured his left arm and shoulder. The bassist had been having a little muscle strain, but he had ignored the pain and carried on playing. It built up and became <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to play on-stage. As a result, four French and two German dates were cancelled.|$|E
25|$|He was {{a regular}} visitor to Lord's, The Canterbury and Scarborough Festivals up {{until his death in}} May 1915. He died just six days after his {{youngest}} son Edward was killed in action at Aubers Ridge. His elder son Major Chandos Leigh was the first Harrovian to be killed in the war, at Mons in August 1914, and the second blow was <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> He died, in the same year as W. G. Grace and his good friend Sir Spencer Ponsonby-Fane, of a broken heart mourning the loss of his two sons {{and the end of the}} golden age of cricket.|$|E
25|$|At around 2:30a.m. (CST) on 4 November 2014, {{an elite}} {{squadron}} of the Federal Police arrested former Iguala mayor Abarca {{and his wife}} Pineda at {{a house in the}} Tenorios neighborhood in Iztapalapa, Mexico City. Neither of them resisted arrest. Abarca confessed that he was tired of hiding and that the pressure was <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> His wife, on the other hand, showed her disdain for law enforcement. The arrest was confirmed through Twitter by the Federal Police spokesperson José Ramón Salinas early that morning. Once in custody, they were taken by law enforcement to the federal installations of SEIDO, Mexico's anti-organized crime investigation agency, for their legal declaration. At the time of their arrest, Abarca and Pineda were among Mexico's most-wanted.|$|E
60|$|I {{should have}} thought his {{employment}} a very easy one, but he used to affirm for some reason or other that his job would be the death of him some day. It was rather mysterious. Perhaps everything naturally was <b>too</b> <b>much</b> trouble <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> He certainly seemed to hate having people in the house.|$|R
50|$|Emil Sayfutdinov {{resign from}} Individual U-21 World Championship, because {{he started in}} four league and Grand Prix and it is <b>too</b> <b>much</b> meeting <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> Sayfutdinov was {{nominated}} to Russia team to Team U-21 World Championship Qualifying Round 2, but Russia was withdrew. In July, he will be participated in the 2009 Speedway World Cup for Russia.|$|R
60|$|Eva's {{father was}} a very {{handsome}} man. He was like Eva, with the same beautiful blue eyes and golden-brown hair. He was very fond of fun and laughter, and though he had quite {{made up his mind}} to buy Tom, he was now teasing Haley, and pretending to think that he was asking <b>too</b> <b>much</b> money <b>for</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
25|$|On 1 December 1942, General Fleischer {{was ordered}} to the {{position}} of Military Attaché to Washington D.C. This was another obvious humiliation, since usually officers of the ranks of Major or Lieutenant-Colonel served in this role. Being <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to swallow, he shot himself with his own gun through the heart on 19 December 1942. He was found by his adjutant Lieutenant Richard Brinck-Johnsen who brought the urn with the General's ashes to London in a Liberator aircraft. In London Brinck-Johnsen {{was ordered to}} keep the circumstances of Fleischer's death secret. Only in 1995 did Brinck-Johnsen speak out, stating that in his opinion Fleischer had taken his own life in sorrow of being set aside and not being needed by anyone.|$|E
25|$|The sixth {{season begins}} {{a year after}} the {{conclusion}} of the fifth season, with Dean living a somewhat happy life with Lisa and Ben. When an emotionless Sam returns to Dean, he is forced to leave his new life behind and work with his resurrected grandfather Samuel to capture Alpha monsters for Crowley. The brothers are unable to get much help from Castiel since his time is occupied by a civil war raging in heaven against the archangel Raphael. Dean does not trust Samuel and his suspicions are confirmed when he finds Samuel working with demons to discover the location of Purgatory. Dean discovers that Sam's soul is still in the Cage, so he implores the Horseman Death to retrieve it. To ensure Sam does not remember his time in the Cage, as it may be <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to handle, Death blocks that part of Sam's memory using a mental wall. The season's second half revolves around the so-called Mother of All, which ultimately leads to events which prove that Castiel is behind the circumstances of Sam's return, the hunt for the Alpha monsters, and the search for Purgatory and was working with Crowley the entire time. When the brothers try to stop Castiel, he brings Sam's memory of the Cage back and proceeds with his plan, absorbing all the souls from Purgatory and pronouncing himself God, having ascended beyond a mere angel.|$|E
500|$|Focusing {{again on}} his zoo, {{he found that}} {{property}} values were skyrocketing. Nelson got a subscription to the Wall Street Journal and added more and more land to his sprawling camp. Shortly after he began his forays into real estate, a health inspector declared his zoo unhygienic and demanded he install lavatories. Nelson did, but the Health Department found them [...] "unsatisfactory", and in 1960 {{he was forced to}} close his zoo. With no income, the taxes on the land became <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> and he ended up borrowing $100,000 ($ in today's dollars) to pay them.|$|E
50|$|At the end {{of season}} 2, Citizen Z decides to leave Northern Lights, knowing all the post's {{resources}} were used up and it has sustained <b>too</b> <b>much</b> damage <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to survive there any longer. He leaves on foot with Pup, pulling a dog sled, in subzero temperatures. Near death, he is rescued by Kaya, an Inuit girl, and her surviving family members.|$|R
60|$|Joe {{shook his}} head. There had been <b>too</b> <b>much</b> {{excitement}} <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to {{feel in the}} least like sleeping. He {{could not bear to}} think of it with the Dazzler leaping and surging along and shattering the seas into clouds of spray on her weather bow. His clothes had half dried already, and he preferred to stay on deck and enjoy it.|$|R

500|$|Several Americans {{died during}} and after the raid. A {{prisoner}} weakened by illness {{died of a heart attack}} as a Ranger carried him from the barracks to the main gate. The Ranger later recalled, [...] "The excitement had been <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> I guess. It was really sad. He was only a hundredfeet from the freedom he had not known for nearly threeyears." [...] Another prisoner died of illness just as the group had reached Talavera. Although Mucci had ordered that an airstrip be built in a field next to Plateros so that a plane could evacuate Fisher to get medical attention, it was never dispatched, and he died the next day. His last words were [...] "Good luck on the way out." [...] The other Ranger killed during the raid was Sweezy, who was struck in the back by two rounds from friendly fire. Both Fisher and Sweezy are buried at Manila National Cemetery. Twenty of Pajota's guerrillas were injured, as were twoScouts and twoRangers.|$|E
500|$|Seizing an axe, Batman hacks {{down the}} front door of the asylum, proclaiming that the inmates are now free. The Joker offers to put him out of his misery. Batman {{retrieves}} Two-Face's coin from Adams and returns it to him, stating that it should be up to Two-Face to decide Batman's fate. Two-Face declares that they will kill Batman if the coin lands scratched side up, but let him go if the unscarred side appears. Two-Face flips the coin and declares Batman free. The Joker bids Batman good-bye, taunting him by saying that should life ever become <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> in [...] "the asylum" [...] (the outside world) then he always has a place in Arkham. As Batman disappears into the night, Two-Face stands looking at the coin and it is revealed that it actually landed scratched side up; Two-Face chose to free Batman with his own will. He then turns to the stack of tarot cards and recites a passage from Alice's Adventures in Wonderland: [...] "Who cares for you? You're nothing but a pack of cards." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{month before}} the filming of the final episode, Aniston said that with each episode it got [...] "harder just to read the lines." [...] She {{explained}} that the cast was [...] "all just nerves and raw emotions [...] No one knows how to feel. We {{may need to be}} sedated on the last night." [...] The producers promised a tearful ending, and the cast admitted their crying was not faked when they filmed their scenes. LeBlanc revealed it had been <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> {{and the rest of the}} cast; he said Kudrow started crying first, and when he looked at Aniston and Cox they also appeared emotional. Schwimmer, who LeBlanc thought was the [...] "consummate professional", was also upset, so LeBlanc [...] "just lost it." [...] Maggie Wheeler, who was Chandler's [...] "on and off" [...] girlfriend Janice, told People, [...] "the entire cast had to go back and have their makeup redone before starting," [...] and that Perry broke the tension by saying, [...] "Somebody is gonna get fired." [...] Perry told the New York Daily News that he did not cry, [...] "but I felt like I was about to for like seven hours." ...|$|E

60|$|At Bellaise he {{had found}} the Abbess much scandalized.
