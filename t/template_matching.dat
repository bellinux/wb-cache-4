40|$|The {{computation}} time of Document Image Decoding can be significantly reduced by employing heuristics {{in the search}} for the best decoding of a text line. By using a cheap upper bound on <b>template</b> <b>match</b> scores, up to 99. 9 % of the potential <b>template</b> <b>matches</b> can be avoided. In the Iterated Complete Path method, <b>template</b> <b>matches</b> are performed only along the best path found by dynamic programming on each iteration. When the best path stabilizes, the decoding is optimal and no more <b>template</b> <b>matches</b> need be performed. Computation can be further reduced in this scheme by exploiting the incremental nature of the Viterbi iterations. Because only a few trellis edge weights have changed since the last iteration, most of the backpointers {{do not need to be}} updated. We describe how to quickly identify these backpointers, without forfeiting optimality of the path. Together these improvements provide a 30 x speedup over previous implementations of Document Image Decoding. Paper 4307 - 28 to be [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Background: Morphology {{discrimination}} (MD) in implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) {{is based}} on the comparison of the ventricular electrogram during tachycardia with a stored reference template obtained during baseline rhythm. However, the effect of heart rate on the <b>template</b> <b>match</b> percentage during supraventricular tachyarrhythmias (SVT) is not known. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the performance of the <b>template</b> <b>match</b> percentage during SVT at different heart rates. Methods and results: Stored electrograms of 868 tachyarrhythmias from 88 patients with a dual-chamber ICD (St Jude Medical, USA) were analysed by the investigators. The effect of heart rate on <b>template</b> <b>match</b> percentage was estimated by regression analysis. For performance measures, data were corrected for multiple episodes in a patient by using the generalized estimating equation method. The mean <b>template</b> <b>match</b> percentage was 86. 6 ± 22. 2 % (median 100 %) for SVT episodes. No significant differences in <b>template</b> <b>match</b> percentage between fast [ventricular cycle length (CL) 300 - 350 ms] and slow (ventricular CL > 400 ms) SVTs were observed (85. 4 ± 27. 0 vs. 87. 1 ± 19. 7 %). Using nominal settings, MD alone provided sensitivity and specificity of 70. 2 % and 89. 4 % overall, respectively. Morphology discrimination in conjunction with rate branch analysis, sudden onset, and stability yielded sensitivity and specificity of 98. 5 % and 91. 2 %, respectively. Conclusion: Morphology discrimination has a consistently high <b>template</b> <b>match</b> percentage during SVTs, which is independent of ventricular CL. The consistent high match percentage results in high specificity for arrhythmia discrimination...|$|R

The time to compute this bound depends on the resolution at which the matching scores are found. At lower resolution, the heuristic computation is reduced, but because a weaker bound is used, the number of Viterbi iterations is increased. We present the optimal (lowest upperbound) heuristic for any degree of subsampling of multilevel template and/or interpolation, for use in text line decoding with ICP. The optimal degree of subsampling depends on image quality, but it is typically found that a small amount of template subsampling is effective in reducing the overall decoding time...|$|R

In this work the set of random variables denoting the possible <b>template</b> <b>matches</b> for the scenario entities is a realization of a Markov Random Field. This approach does not separate low level fusion from high level fusion but optimizes both simultaneously. The result of the added high level context is a method that is robust to false positive and false negative, or missed, sensor readings. Furthermore, the high level context helps to direct {{the search for the}} best <b>template</b> <b>match.</b> Empirical results illustrate the efficacy of the method both at identifying threats in the face of false negatives, and at negating false positives, as well as illustrating the reduced computational effort resulting from the incorporation of additional high-level context...|$|R
50|$|The {{simplest}} {{approach to}} instruction selection {{is known as}} macro expansion or interpretative code generation. A macro-expanding instruction selector operates by <b>matching</b> <b>templates</b> over the middle-level IR. Upon a match the corresponding macro is executed, using the matched portion of the IR as input, which emits the appropriate target instructions. Macro expansion can be done either directly on the textual representation of the middle-level IR, or the IR can first {{be transformed into a}} graphical representation which is then traversed depth-first. In the latter, a <b>template</b> <b>matches</b> one or more adjacent nodes in the graph.|$|R

50|$|Although the pandemonium {{architecture}} arose as {{a response}} to address a major criticism of the <b>template</b> <b>matching</b> theories, the two are actually rather similar in some sense: there is a process where a specific set of features for items is matched against some sort of mental representation. The critical difference between the two is that the image is directly compared against an internal representation in the <b>template</b> <b>matching</b> theories, whereas with the pandemonium architecture, the image is first diffused and processed at the featural level. This granted pandemonium architectures tremendous power because it is capable of recognizing a stimulus despite its changes in size, style and other transformations; without the presumption of an unlimited pattern memory. It is also unlikely that the <b>template</b> <b>matching</b> theories will function properly when faced with realistic visual inputs, where objects are presented in three dimensions and often occluded by other objects (e.g., half of a book is covered by a piece of paper, but we can still recognize it as a book with relative ease). Nonetheless, some researchers have conducted experiments comparing the two theories. Not surprisingly, the results often favored a hierarchal feature building model like the pandemonium architecture.|$|E
