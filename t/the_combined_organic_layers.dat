40|$|In {{the present}} work, a {{ultrafiltration}} (UF) low pressure membrane (LPM) made {{of polyvinyl chloride}} (PVC) was used with an inline poly-ferric sulfate coagulation in a full scale drinking water treatment plant. The organic foulants and their accumulation behavior in the membrane filtration were investigated during a whole year operation. The evolutions of the surface morphology of the membranes were characterized by scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The results revealed that the cake layer and pore blocked {{were responsible for the}} flux declining. Moreover, the roughness of the surface of the membranes continuously increased with the filtration. In order to identify the constitutes of organic foulants, attenuated total reflectance-fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), high pressure size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) and fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM) spectrometry were used to examine the desorbed organic matters from the fouled membranes. The results showed that humic substances kept a very stable situation, indicating {{that it would not be}} important in the formation of <b>the</b> <b>combined</b> <b>organic</b> fouling <b>layer.</b> Protein/protein-like substances and soluble microbial product-like (SMP-like) substances were the dominant components in the <b>organic</b> fouling <b>layer</b> in a long-term ultrafiltration of surface water used as a drinking water source. A decrease of protein/protein-like substances and an increase of SMP-like substances with the filtration time were found, which could be attributed to the transition from proteins to SMP in the fouling layer. Thus, the increase of SMP-like substances in the fouling layer would play a significant role on the accumulation of irreversible fouling. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Synthesis of 21 a: The {{compound}} 21 a was synthesized by the Grignard {{reaction of}} 3 -phenylpropanal with vinylmagnesium bromide. [8 c] To a cooled (273 K) THF solution of vinylmagnesium bromide (40 mL, 1 M) was added 3 -phenylpropanal (3. 4 g, 25. 3 mmol) dropwise over 15 min and {{the solution was}} kept at 273 K for 45 min. Then, the solution was allowed to warm to room temperature (ca. 293 K) and kept {{at room temperature for}} 1 h. The reaction was quenched by the addition of ice until effervescence ceased. The resulting suspension was treated with aqueous H 2 SO 4 (1 M) until the suspension became homogeneous. The solution was diluted with dichloromethane (50 mL), and the aqueous layer was separated and washed with dichloromethane (20 mL × 3). <b>The</b> <b>combined</b> <b>organic</b> <b>layers</b> were dried over calcium chloride and distilled to give 2. 1 g of 21 a as a colorless oil (51 % yield based o...|$|E
30|$|The {{enantioselective}} alkylation of aldehydes {{was performed}} in an overnight oven dried Pyrex glass vial equipped with a septum and a dried magnetic stir bar. Rose Bengal (2.5  mg), the catalyst (24.0  mg), LiCl (2.1  mg) and diethyl bromomalonate (84 μL) were added successively. After purging the container with argon for 1  min, anhydrous DMSO (0.5  M, 1  mL) was added followed by hydrocinnamaldehyde 132  μL) and 2, 6 -lutidine (115  μL). Then the stirred solution was degassed for 10  min under argon bubbling. The mixture was placed 2  cm from the 24  W 6500  K 1425  lm fluorescent light source for irradiation until the complete conversion of the bromide in 2  h (monitored by TLC and/or GC/MS analysis). Then 10  mL of water was added and the resulting solution was extracted with ethyl acetate (3  ×  10  mL). <b>The</b> <b>combined</b> <b>organic</b> <b>layers</b> were dried over anhydrous MgSO 4 and concentrated in vacuo.
