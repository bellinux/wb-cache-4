The F-80s spotted the North Korean planes and engaged them. The North Korean aircraft split into two groups of four and quickly destroyed a Republic of Korea Air Force T-6 Texan parked on the tarmac at Kimpo.|$|E
5|$|According to the legend, the raskovnik could unlock any gate or padlock, {{regardless}} of its size, material or key. It could also uncover treasures buried in the ground: in Bulgarian beliefs, it could split <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> place where a treasure lay so that people could locate it. In some regions of Serbia, the treasure itself was {{a black man in}} chains who requested that a raskovnik be brought to him. The raskovnik would break the chains and the man would disappear into the ground {{to be replaced by a}} cauldron filled with gold coins. Other supernatural properties attributed to the herb by Bulgarians include the alchemic ability to transmute iron into gold, the more general ability to make the one who picked it forever happy or wealthy. In some interpretations, the raskovnik is a wonderful plant that makes true whatever its owner desires.|$|E

5|$|Lactifluus volemus, {{formerly}} known as Lactarius volemus, is a species of fungus in the family Russulaceae. It is widely distributed in the northern hemisphere, in temperate regions of Europe, North America and Asia {{as well as some}} subtropical and tropical regions of Central America and Asia. A mycorrhizal fungus, its fruit bodies grow on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> base of various species of trees from summer to autumn, either individually or in groups. It is valued as an edible mushroom, and is sold in markets in Asia. Several other Lactifluus mushrooms resemble L.volemus, such as the closely related edible species L.corrugis, but these can be distinguished by differences in distribution, visible morphology, and microscopic characteristics. L.volemus produces a white spore print and has roughly spherical spores about 7–8micrometres in diameter.|$|E
5|$|Other methods {{commonly}} practised in Europe included severing the tendons at {{the knees}} or placing poppy seeds, millet, or sand on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> grave site of a presumed vampire; this was intended to keep the vampire occupied all night by counting the fallen grains, indicating an association of vampires with arithmomania. Similar Chinese narratives state that if a vampire-like being came across a sack of rice, {{it would have to}} count every grain; this is a theme encountered in myths from the Indian subcontinent, as well as in South American tales of witches and other sorts of evil or mischievous spirits or beings.|$|E

5|$|The {{disaster}} and investigation received widespread media coverage. The {{impact on the}} public was increased by the dramatic effect of an amateur photo taken of the aircraft rolling that was published {{on the front page of}} the Chicago Tribune on the Sunday two days after the crash. There were some early reports that a collision with a small aircraft had been the cause of the crash. This apparently was the result of the discovery of small-aircraft parts among the wreckage at the crash site. National Transportation Safety Board vice-chairman Elwood T. Driver, in a press briefing, was photographed holding a broken bolt and nut, implying that these parts were a cause of the accident. The small-plane parts were subsequently determined to have been on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time of the crash, at the former general aviation Ravenswood Airport, a facility that had been out of service for a few years. An owner there had been selling used aircraft parts from a remaining hangar building.|$|E
5|$|On the field, the Hokies {{were led}} by quarterback Grant Noel, who {{completed}} 146 of his 254 pass attempts for 1,826 passing yards, 16 touchdowns, and 11 interceptions. Noel's favorite passing target was André Davis, who caught 39 passes for 623 yards and seven touchdowns. In recognition of his success, Davis was named a first-team all-Big East selection. Fullback Jarrett Ferguson also set three single-season receiving records by catching 25 passes for 256 yards and three touchdowns, {{all of which were}} school records for a fullback. Despite those numbers, most of Virginia Tech's offense was gained on <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> beginning of the season, running back Lee Suggs was the leader of the Hokies' rushing offense. He set Virginia Tech records for career rushing touchdowns and career touchdowns before suffering a season-ending injury in the Hokies' game against Connecticut. Following Suggs' injury, his role was taken up by freshman running back Kevin Jones, who set a Tech freshman running record by accumulating 957 yards. That figure also was the fifth most in Division I-A, and he was named Big East rookie of the year and an All-American by The Sporting News.|$|E
