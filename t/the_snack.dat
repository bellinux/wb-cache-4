5|$|At a seminar, Aristo met {{director}} Hanung Bramantyo {{and showed}} him one of his screenplays. Bramantyo, who liked what he saw, asked Aristo to write a screenplay for a new film {{he was working on}} with Leo Sutanto of SinemArt. The resulting work, written after intensive research into the production of brownies and titled after <b>the</b> <b>snack,</b> was released in 2004. It garnered a Citra Award for Best Director at the Indonesian Film Festival for Bramantyo and a nomination for best original screenplay for Aristo. While Brownies was in production, Aristo wrote four other screenplays, for Catatan Akhir Sekolah (Notes from the End of School), Cinta Silver (Silver Love), Jomblo (Single), and Alexandria. All of these were made into films between 2005 and 2006. After these successes, at the end of 2006 Bramantyo asked Aristo and his new wife, screenwriter Ginatri S. Noer, to adapt the novel Ayat-Ayat Cinta (Verses of Love) by Habiburrahman El Shirazy, into a film. The resulting work, also entitled Ayat-Ayat Cinta, was highly successful. This was followed by Karma (2007), and Kambing Jantan: The Movie (2008).|$|E

40|$|The first {{objective}} {{for this}} research was to formulate and produce a set of model high protein extruded snack foods varying by protein level and protein type, incorporating enough protein to meet the health claims stated above. Secondly, <b>the</b> <b>snacks</b> were evaluated in a consumer acceptance test to understand {{the effect of the}} independent variables, protein level and protein type, on overall acceptance. Following this, <b>the</b> <b>snacks</b> were evaluated by a descriptive analysis panel, which was trained to quantify sensory aspects of the products that differentiated in terms of appearance, taste, texture, etc. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>snacks</b> were profiled using a battery of instrumental food analysis techniques to understand how the independent variables affect the physico- chemical properties of <b>the</b> <b>snacks.</b> These measures were repeated after a six-month storage period in ambient conditions (~ 22 °C), to understand <b>the</b> changes <b>the</b> <b>snacks</b> underwent during a typical shelf life. These results were analyzed together to understand how various sensory and physico-chemical characteristics may be responsible for affecting consumer liking, and how that may change over a six-month storage period...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the effect of adding Amaranth leaf powder on the nutrient content and consumer acceptability of extruded provitamin A-biofortified (PVA) maize snacks. Flours of four varieties of PVA maize were composited with Amaranth leaf powder at 0, 1 and 3 % (w/w) substitution of, respectively, and extruded into <b>snacks.</b> <b>The</b> ash content of <b>the</b> <b>snacks</b> increased from 0. 53 g/ 100 g- 0. 58 g/ 100 g to 0. 650 g/ 100 g- 89 g/ 100 g and protein content increased from 9. 12 g/ 100 g- 10. 94 g/ 100 g when Amaranth was increased from 0 % to 3 %. Similarly, lysine content increased from 0. 10 g/ 100 g to 0. 17 g/ 100 g, whilst methionine increased from 0. 14 g/ 100 g to 0. 19 g/ 100 g. The provitamin A content of <b>the</b> <b>snacks</b> ranged from 1. 29 µg/g to 1. 40 µg/g at 0 % Amaranth and 1. 54 µg/g to 1. 78 µg/g at 3 % Amaranth. The acceptability of <b>the</b> <b>snacks</b> decreased with increasing Amaranth concentration, only a very small proportion (2 - 8 %) of the panel liked <b>the</b> <b>snacks</b> extremely.

Foaming absorption capacity (FAC), varied from 128 to 147 % in <b>the</b> <b>snacks</b> while it varied from 184 to 221 % in the oilseed cakes.
