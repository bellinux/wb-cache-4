5|$|Leeds City had {{finished}} 19th in the Second Division {{in the season}} preceding Chapman's arrival, and were facing re-election. Chapman played an essential part in lobbying for the side's readmission and Leeds City were duly re-elected. <b>That</b> <b>done,</b> Chapman signed new talent such as Jimmy Speirs from Bradford City and despite some erratic performances – losing 6–0 in between two 5–1 wins, for example – City finished sixth in 1912–13, Chapman's first season. Attendances rose at Elland Road from 8,500 to 13,000 in his first year, as Chapman's attacking side scored 70goals, the second-highest total in the entire division.|$|E
5|$|Warhol's {{production}} of Campbell's Soup can works underwent three distinct phases.

In 1965, Warhol revisited the theme while arbitrarily replacing the original red and white colors with {{a wider variety of}} hues. In the late 1970s, he again returned to the soup cans while inverting and reversing the images.

25|$|While {{large scale}} {{reclamation}} {{began in the}} 1850s, the earliest reclamations in Wellington were conducted by private citizens. A popular story of the first reclamation conducted in Wellington was <b>that</b> <b>done</b> by George Bennet. Bennet had arrived in 1848 on the Berenicia and purchased a hilly section at Windy, or Clay Point (what is now the corner of Lambton Quay and Willis Street). At that time, Windy Point was a precipice with a narrow and often impassible path connecting Willis Street to Beach Road (now Lambton Quay). Bennet commenced, to the amusement of neighbours, with pick-axe, shovel and barrow to move earth from the Point, tossing the spoil onto the path and into the harbour, thus widened the track and performing Wellington's first reclamation.|$|E

25|$|Prior to {{the early}} 1990s, any {{producer}} of Muscadet wine could use the phrase sur lie on their wine labels regardless {{of the length of}} time and manner that it actually spent in contact with the lees. In 1994, French authorities designed regulations that limit the use of sur lie to only wines that comply with a set guideline. First, while the sub-appellations of Muscadet-Sèvre et Maine, Muscadet-Coteaux de la Loire and Muscadet-Côtes de Grandlieu are permitted to use the term, any wine labeled with just the generic AOC Muscadet cannot. Second, the wine must spend at least a full winter in contact with the lees and not be bottled until after the third week of March following the harvest. Some wines are kept in contact longer, in order to produce a more full-bodied style, and not bottled till between mid-October to mid-November. Finally the wine must be bottled directly off its lees and not go through any racking or filtration process. Currently there is no regulation on the size or type of vessel that the wine should be kept in sur lie with. There is a movement among some Muscadet producers to limit the practice to just <b>that</b> <b>done</b> in standard-sized oak barrels, but currently any size barrel or even stainless steel fermentation tanks are allowed to age a wine sur lie and label it accordingly.|$|E

500|$|According to Art Gallery of New South Wales {{indigenous}} art curator and NATSIAA judge Hetti Perkins, Makinti and {{her work}} are [...] "very dynamic and charismatic". Although {{a member of the}} Papunya Tula Artists, Makinti's work has been described as taking [...] "a more spontaneous approach in illustrating the traditional iconography than <b>that</b> <b>done</b> by previous artists painting at Papunya". Her style evolved over time, beginning with gestural brush strokes in ordered compositions, and developing into more closely interwoven representations of the hair-string skirts and designs reflecting those used in body painting. Throughout this evolution, her colour palette has consistently included a subtle range of yellows and pinks, through to oranges and whites.|$|E
500|$|The {{emphasis}} on manufacturing, especially <b>that</b> <b>done</b> under licence, {{became even more}} apparent following {{the imposition of a}} 20% duty on imported machine tools and reduced demand, both triggered by the Great Depression. There was much innovation and many of these advances were pioneering techniques that are now universal, although from a trading perspective things were dire for the companies. In particular, The Churchill Machine Tool Co successfully harnessed the utility of hydraulics in many aspects of its machinery and developed a cambering mechanism for grinding rollers used in, for example, the paper industry. In 1932 H H Asbridge's [...] "Hydrauto" [...] bearing was introduced: this aided precision positioning of a workpiece with almost no intervening film of lubrication.|$|E
