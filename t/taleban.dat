In the English language newspapers of Pakistan, the word Talibans is often used when referring to more than one Taliban.

In a separate hostage negotiation in April 7 for the release of Daniele Mastrogiacomo, the Italian la Repubblica foreign correspondent, and his interpreter and driver, Hanefi was arrested and put in jail in Kabul by Afghan President Hamid Karzai’s government, alleging that Hanefi had played a part in the capture of Mastrogiacomo by the <b>Taleban.</b> Italy’s deputy foreign affairs minister, Ugo Intini, confirmed that the Afghan government released five <b>Taleban</b> prisoners to win the freedom of Mastrogiacomo.|$|E

[...] However, a later report quotes a <b>Taleban</b> spokesman, Qari Yousaf Ahmadi, telling the Afghan news agency Pajhwok that the kidnappers should [...] "free their hostage because it is not fair to hit at Italy by killing an innocent journalist." [...] He added that [...] "the kidnappers are just bandits interested in money." [...] Reporters Without Borders suggest that their original demands might have been just a way of introducing a ransom request. It is possible that the <b>Taleban</b> issue statements such as this to make kidnappings appear to be political rather than an exercise in revenue generation. To confuse the position, the captors are reported to have contacted Emergency and asked, in exchange for freeing Torsello, for the return to Afghanistan of Abdul Rahman, the Afghan citizen who converted to Christianity and who escaped to Italy after he was sentenced to death in March 2006. Furthermore, the Italian press agency AGI on 20 October 2006, quoted Torsello as saying, under duress, [...] "The kidnappers frequently tell me that I am a spy and that British troops bombed Musa Qala and Nawzad districts on my intelligence", but that the abductors, contrary to their previous remarks, distanced themselves from the <b>Taleban</b> and said they were just Muslims fighting foreign occupation in the war-battered country.|$|E

50|$|The Taliban ("students"), {{alternative}} spelling <b>Taleban,</b> is an Islamic fundamentalist {{political movement}} in Afghanistan.

5000|$|Neasden is a Greater London suburb {{which is}} the {{location}} of various parody institutions, and is often given as the origin of fictional letters. In 1971, Richard Ingrams said simply that Neasden was used [...] "to denote the contemporary urban environment". Stories {{from the world of}} football are satirised in [...] "reports" [...] by E.I.

Sid and Doris Hill are occasionally given as the fans' names, a pun on the suburb of Dollis Hill, which is near Neasden. The club's recent misfortunes lampooned the recent tribulations of major clubs in the national news. Often, underneath a spoof sports story, the sub-column [...] "late result" [...] would appear, reporting on a match recently played by Neasden. This normally involved a humorously unlikely team, often one related to current affairs, such as <b>Taleban</b> FC. Neasden nearly always lose by a huge margin, often owing to own goals scored by veteran player [...] "Baldy" [...] Pevsner, who often scores a consolation [...] "one boot", and in spite of the efforts of their goalkeeper, [...] "One-legged net-minder Wally Foot". Neasden is also the setting for the regular column Neasden Police Log, a fictional log-entry style police report that almost invariably depicts the police as racist, incompetent, and obsessed with observing politically correct rules at the expense of maintaining law and order. In 1970, [...] "Neasden" [...] was a brief hit put in the Eye as a throwaway plastic single, sung by William Rushton, who contributed to the Eye as a cartoonist: it can be heard in Betjeman's TV documentary Metro-land as a backing track.
