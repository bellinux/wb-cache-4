25|$|On September 21, 1849, the Oregon Baptist Educational Society {{was started}} {{in what was then}} the Oregon Territory. On September 27, 1849, a meeting of the group was held and they decided to build a school on the east bank of the Willamette River, {{approximately}} eight miles north of its confluence with the Calapooia River, and established a board of trustees. The Rev. Ezra Fisher was asked to start the school, but {{when he went to the}} planned site it was not available, and instead he started to teach school inside the Oregon City Baptist Church while leaders contemplated what <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> permanent site. Meanwhile, the Rev. Richmond Cheadle was tasked with raising $2,000 to pay for construction of a school building.|$|E

These early live dates were recorded by Dick Bock on a portable reel-to-reel tape deck. Bock along with Roy Harte would soon after, start the Pacific Jazz label and release Mulligan's records. Mulligan's first recording sessions in Los Angeles were produced by Bock for Pacific Jazz. These three informal sessions took place in June, July, and August 1952 at the Hollywood Hills cottage of recording engineer Phil Turetsky. At these sessions, Mulligan, Chet Baker, and others recorded the material that was released as Pacific Jazz PJ LP-1 and later on PJ-8.|$|E

The first song of the soundtrack was completed in December 2011. By February 2012, Rahman {{said in an interview}} with The Times of India that he had completed three songs for the film. He summarized the soundtrack album: [...] "It's a combination.

500|$|A week into filming, Francis {{felt the}} {{infected}} (referred to as [...] "Darkseekers" [...] or [...] "hemocytes" [...] in the script), {{who were being}} portrayed by actors wearing prosthetics, were not convincing. His decision to use CGI resulted in an increased budget and extended post-production, although the end results were not always well received. The concept behind the infected was that their adrenal glands were open {{all of the time}} and Lawrence explained, [...] "They needed to have an abandon in their performance that you just can't get out of people {{in the middle of the}} night when they're barefoot. And their metabolisms are really spiked, so they're constantly hyperventilating, which you can't really get actors <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long time or they pass out." [...] The actors remained on set to provide motion capture. [...] "The film's producers and sound people wanted the creatures in the movie to sound somewhat human, but not the standard", so Mike Patton, lead singer of Faith No More, was engaged to provide the screams and howls of the infected.|$|E

Australian LGBT website SameSame said the story had attracted attention from some media commentators, who called it [...] "an obvious ratings grab and an attempt to out-gay rival soap, Home and Away". However, script producer, Emma Steele defended the storyline and said {{that it is not a}} [...] "ploy to grab ratings". Steele said that she is [...] "particularly proud" [...] of the way Chris's storyline had been handled and she added [...] "It was something we wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> while because it's a story that affects so many people and in so many different ways.

500|$|The {{original}} {{concept for}} the episode was a one line concept card stating [...] "Lightning Boy" [...] {{that had been}} tacked to a board in series creator Chris Carter's office since the first season. Carter's idea was solely about a boy who could control lightning, and the concept wasn't fleshed out into an episode until the third season. Writer Howard Gordon stated that the key moment in the episode's conception came {{when he decided to}} use the boy's power as a metaphor for disenfranchised adolescence. Gordon described the episode's concept as [...] "Beavis and Butt-head electrified". Gordon claimed that the episode suffered conceptually having come directly after a trilogy of mythology episodes. Story editor Frank Spotnitz claims that there were originally ideas on incorporating some of the events from that trilogy into this episode, but those ideas were eventually scrapped due to the producer's desire for each episode {{to be able to have}} its own integrity and stand alone. Spotnitz said the episode was a risky one <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> show with an adult audience due to the high school setting and the fact that the episode was about adolescence and violent impulses when one is a kid.|$|E
500|$|... "The Doctor's Wife" [...] {{was planned}} {{as the third}} episode in the 2011 series but the order was changed during the {{production}} process. Initial production occurred in September, with Gaiman visiting the set during the production period and filming for the associated Confidential. Additional filming took place in October 2010, with guest star Suranne Jones having been filmed for green screen special effects. The scenes where Amy and Rory are on the run allowed the audience to explore the TARDIS outside the control room, something the producers had wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> while. A series of corridors was constructed and retained for future use. The episode also featured {{the return of the}} older TARDIS control room from the Christopher Eccleston and David Tennant era. Gaiman had originally wanted to reconstruct a console room from the original series, but the cost proved prohibitive. The set was retained after filming for [...] "The Eleventh Hour", but has since been removed {{to become part of the}} Doctor Who Experience exhibit. Arthur Darvill noted the floor of the older set had a cheese grater-like quality to it, so when the scene called for the cast to fall on it, they found it uncomfortable to stay down for a long period of time.|$|E

In an interview with Extra, a month later, she revealed that she was working [...] "very slowly, but progressively" [...] on a studio album. She also released the song [...] "Pretty Girls" [...] in 2015 with Iggy Azalea, which was met with moderate impact. This resulted in Spears {{heading back to the}} studio to record more songs without having plans to release a new album. In late 2016, during interviews to promote Glory, Spears declared that she wanted to explore new things on the record, and that it was her [...] "most hip-hop album," [...] explaining, [...] " [...] there are like two or three songs that go in the direction of more urban that I've wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long time now, and I just haven't really done that." [...] Talay Riley, who was among the songwriters that worked with Spears on the album, previously co-wrote Iggy Azalea's [...] "Bounce" [...] (2013) and Nick Jonas' [...] "Levels" [...] (2015). After the release of first single [...] "Make Me..." [...] and the promotional single [...] "Private Show" [...] on August 8, 2016, Spears and website PopCrush announced that [...] "Clumsy" [...] was going to be made available as the second promotional track from the Glory as an instant grant for those who pre-ordered the album.

500|$|The episode {{featured}} Mel Gibson {{as a guest}} voice. Scully {{had previously}} met him while writing jokes for a school fundraiser {{along with his wife}} Julie Thacker. Gibson and Daniel Stern were the hosts and needed jokes for the event. It turned out that Gibson was a fan of the show and watched it with his children. With that knowledge, it did not take Scully long to invite him to do a part. Gibson was willing to do the job and even came in on three separate occasions to do retakes – mostly because he knew his children would be watching. Unlike most guest voices, Gibson recorded the show along with the cast. On one occasion, it turned out that a joke written for Gibson actually did happen in real life. The writing staff wanted Gibson to say that he would urinate behind a dumpster, because it sounded like {{it would not be a}} classy thing <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> movie star. He had, however, already done that during a couple of film premieres because he can feel trapped in a public toilet with a lot of fans. Gibson was surprised the writers knew about the story, but it turned out to be a coincidence. Otherwise, the episode frequently references films Gibson appeared in. After the studio cart crashes, Gibson says to Homer, [...] "I'm getting too old for this crap," [...] a reference to a line said by Danny Glover's character Roger Murtaugh to Gibson's character Martin Riggs in the Lethal Weapon film series. A poster for his film Braveheart is on the wall in the editing room and the Road Warrior car from the 1981 film Mad Max 2 is also featured. In addition to Gibson, Jack Burns guest starred in the episode, voicing a film studio executive named Edward Christian. His frequent use of the terms [...] "Huh?" [...] and [...] "You know what I mean?" [...] is a reference to a comedy routine performed by Burns and Avery Schreiber. The episode also features John Travolta, in whose private jet Gibson flies to Springfield, but his voice was imitated by Dan Castellaneta.|$|E
