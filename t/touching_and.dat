5|$|Common to all {{crimes against}} {{the person is}} the {{infringement}} {{of the right to}} bodily integrity. It extends to the touching of clothing, for example, and where no physical harm actually results. However, if all touchings were criminalised, this would interfere with the right to liberty. It is the very <b>touching,</b> <b>and</b> not the harm, that is the violation of principle. This is related to the right to privacy under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The central statute on this topic is Offences against the Person Act 1861, which brought together a multitude of difference offences, with much overlap and inconsistent terminology. These include both the actual infliction and the threat of violence. Although criticised, the Act has not been replaced.|$|E

40|$|Resumo: Reiki, Toque Terapêutico (TT) e Healing Touch (HT) são Técnicas de Imposição de Mãos (TIM) que trabalham na harmonização do fluxo natural de energia vital do organismo. Esta energia, apesar de ainda não ser qualificada pela física, é citada por alguns autores como sendo o biocampo: o campo de energia intrínseco a todos os seres vivos, chamado também de campo quântico, clássico e não clássico. Um dos efeitos mais comumente reportados proveniente da aplicação dessas técnicas é o relaxamento, este, pode auxiliar na melhora da qualidade de vida de pessoas com câncer, assim como no alívio de sintomas como dor e stress-ansiedade. Este trabalho teve como objetivo verificar o uso e o efeito das TIM aplicadas ao câncer, a dor e ao stress-ansiedade, para isto foi realizada uma revisão sistemática da {{literatura}} nas bases de dados "PubMed/Medline", "Lilacs", "Embase", "Ebsco" e "Web Of Science" com os termos: "Reiki and Cancer, Reiki and Pain, Reiki and Stress, Reiki <b>and</b> Anxiety, Therapeutic <b>Touch</b> <b>and</b> Cancer, Therapeutic <b>Touch</b> <b>and</b> Pain, Therapeutic <b>Touch</b> <b>and</b> Stress, Therapeutic <b>Touch</b> <b>and</b> Anxiety, Healing <b>Touch</b> <b>and</b> Cancer, Healing <b>Touch</b> <b>and</b> Pain, Healing <b>Touch</b> <b>and</b> Stress e Healing <b>Touch</b> <b>and</b> Anxiety". Foram incluídos artigos sem limite em relação ao tempo e de língua Inglesa ou Portuguesa, foram excluídos artigos de revisão, duplicatas, artigos que não realizaram experimentos em seres humanos e que não reportassem o uso e/ou efeito dessas técnicas. Os resultados demonstram que as TIM são um recurso terapêutico não convencional benéfico para pessoas em tratamento do câncer, com dor e stress-ansiedade, revelando melhores resultados quando aplicadas sob abordagem fenomenológica e personalizada.;;Abstract:Reiki, Therapeutic <b>Touch</b> (TT) <b>and</b> Healing <b>Touch</b> (HT) are Techniques of Laying on of Hands (TLH) {{that work}} on harmonizing the natural flow of vital {{energy in the}} body.

One {{of the most commonly}} reported effects from the application of these techniques is relaxation, this can assist in improving {{the quality of life of}} people with cancer, as well as in relieving symptoms such as pain, anxiety and stress. This study aimed to examine the use and effect of TLH applied to cancer, pain and stress-anxiety, therefore systematic literature review was performed in the databases "PubMed/Medline ", " Lilacs ", " Embase ", " Ebsco" and " Web of Science " with the words: "Reiki and Cancer, Reiki and Pain, Reiki and Stress, Reiki <b>and</b> Anxiety, Therapeutic <b>Touch</b> <b>and</b> Cancer, Therapeutic <b>Touch</b> <b>and</b> Pain, Stress <b>and</b> Therapeutic <b>Touch,</b> Therapeutic <b>Touch</b> <b>and</b> Anxiety, Healing <b>Touch</b> <b>and</b> Cancer, Healing <b>Touch</b> <b>and</b> Pain, Healing <b>Touch</b> <b>and</b> Stress <b>and</b> Healing <b>Touch</b> <b>and</b> Anxiety".

Elephants are thought to be able to discern relatives even from their remains. An episode of the acclaimed BBC Documentary Life on Earth shows this in detail - The elephants, upon finding a dead herd member, pause for several minutes at a time, and carefully touch and hold the dead creature's bones.|$|E

In another study college students were asked to recall if they or other students had experienced sexual harassment by high school teachers. 6.5% of the respondents reported having personally experienced sexually inappropriate attention from high school teachers.

25|$|Zona Rosa is one {{of three}} areas in Mexico City where gay bars and other {{businesses}} operate, along with Plaza Garibaldi and an area on Avenida Insurgentes South. However, Zona Rosa is the largest of these and considered to be the gay community’s business center, with over 200 businesses spread over 16 blocks. The best-known businesses are bars such as Hibrido, Caberetito, El Ansia, Black Out, and B-Gay B-Proud (in English). These bars, clubs, and other entertainment places mostly cater to younger crowds and play reggaeton, psycho-punk, etc., with lasers, strobe lights and other typical decor. However, these businesses are usually marked with rainbow colored flags or other decorations on the facade. Singles and couples dance sensually and sometimes a cloud of generated smoke covers the dance floor. <b>Touching</b> <b>and</b> kissing between couples of the same sex is highly tolerated in many of these clubs. Some also have “dark rooms” where patrons can find privacy for more intimate acts. A number also have unofficial dress codes.|$|E
25|$|The {{dictionary}} had scarcely {{been completed}} when an opponent to its author arose in Dunash ben Labrat, {{who had come}} to Spain from Fez, Morocco, and who wrote a criticism on the work, which he prefaced by a eulogistic dedication to Hasdai. Dunash roused Menahem's enemies, who began to complain to Hasdai of Menahem's alleged wrongs against them. The slanders of his personal enemies likewise seem to have aroused Hasdai's anger against Menahem to such a pitch that the latter, at the command of the powerful statesman, suffered bodily violence, being cast out of his house on the Sabbath day, shamed, and imprisoned. In a <b>touching,</b> <b>and</b> at some points audacious letter to Hasdai (a valuable source from which most of this information has been taken) Menahem, who probably died shortly afterward, complained of the wrong done him and sharply criticized Hasdai. He seems to have made some impression on his patron. Menahem is said to have written another work in answer to the criticisms of Dunash, of which only an excerpt has survived, quoted by Rabbi Profiat Duran. Menahem's pupils also defended their teacher, and in response to Dunash's criticism wrote a detailed refutation which was marked by polemical acumen and exact grammatical knowledge, today preserved in the ducal library of Parma. Judah ben David Hayyuj, one of these three young scholars who so effectually defended their master, became the founder of scientific Hebrew grammar; another, Isaac ibn Gikatilla, was subsequently, {{as one of the most}} learned men of Lucena, the teacher of Jonah ibn Janah. Thus the most flourishing period of Hebrew philology, whose chief representatives were Hayyuj and ibn Janah, began with Menahem's work and teachings.|$|E
25|$|Vision is {{the primary}} sense for humans, but speech {{perception}} is multimodal, which means that it involves information {{from more than one}} sensory modality, in particular, audition and vision. The McGurk effect arises during phonetic processing because the integration of audio and visual information happens early in speech perception. The McGurk effect is very robust; that is, knowledge about it seems to have little effect on one's perception of it. This is different from certain optical illusions, which break down once one 'sees through' them. Some people, including those that have been researching the phenomenon for more than twenty years, experience the effect even when they are aware that it is taking place. With the exception of people who can identify most of what is being said from speech-reading alone, most people are quite limited in their ability to identify speech from visual-only signals. A more extensive phenomenon is the ability of visual speech to increase the intelligibility of heard speech in a noisy environment. Visible speech can also alter the perception of perfectly audible speech sounds when the visual speech stimuli are mismatched with the auditory speech. Normally, speech perception is thought to be an auditory process; however, our use of information is immediate, automatic, and, to a large degree, unconscious and therefore, despite what is widely accepted as true, speech is not only something we hear. Speech is perceived by all of the senses working together (seeing, <b>touching,</b> <b>and</b> listening to a face move). The brain is often unaware of the separate sensory contributions of what it perceives. Therefore, when it comes to recognizing speech the brain cannot differentiate whether it is seeing or hearing the incoming information.|$|E
