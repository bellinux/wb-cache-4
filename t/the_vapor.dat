5|$|A Faraday filter, {{magneto-optical}} filter, FADOF or EFADOF (Excited Faraday Dispersive Optical Filter) {{works by}} rotating the polarization {{of the light}} passing through <b>the</b> <b>vapor</b> cell. This rotation occurs near its atomic absorption lines by the Faraday effect and anomalous dispersion. Only light at the resonant frequency of <b>the</b> <b>vapor</b> is rotated and the polarized plates block other electromagnetic radiation. This effect is related to and enhanced by the Zeeman Effect, or the splitting of atomic absorption lines {{in the presence of}} the magnetic field. Light at the resonant frequency of <b>the</b> <b>vapor</b> exits a FADOF near its original strength but with an orthogonal polarization.|$|E
5|$|In {{a passive}} ALF, the input {{frequency}} must correspond almost exactly {{to the natural}} absorption lines of <b>the</b> <b>vapor</b> cell. Active ARFs are much more flexible, however, as <b>the</b> <b>vapor</b> may be stimulated {{so that it will}} absorb other frequencies of light.|$|E

40|$|The method {{disclosed}} herein may {{be practiced}} by passing <b>the</b> <b>vapors</b> to be sampled along {{a path with}} halogen vapor, preferably chlorine <b>vapor,</b> heating <b>the</b> mixed <b>vapors</b> to halogenate those of <b>the</b> sampled <b>vapors</b> subject to halogenation, removing unreacted halogen vapor, and then sensing <b>the</b> <b>vapors</b> for organic halogenated compounds. The apparatus disclosed herein comprises means for flowing <b>the</b> <b>vapors,</b> both sample and halogen vapors, into a common path, means for heating <b>the</b> mixed <b>vapors</b> to effect <b>the</b> halogenation reaction, means for removing unreacted halogen vapor, and a sensing device for sensing halogenated compounds. By such a method and means, <b>the</b> <b>vapors</b> of low molecular weight hydrocarbons, ketones and alcohols, when present, such as methane, ethane, acetone, ethanol, and the like are converted, at least in part, to halogenated compounds, then the excess halogen removed or trapped, and <b>the</b> resultant <b>vapors</b> of <b>the</b> halogenated compounds sensed or detected. The system is highly sensitive. For example, acetone in a concentration of 30 parts per billion (volume) is readily detected...|$|R

30|$|For safety consideration, the {{operating}} pressure in the TDU is maintained at atmospheric pressure, which {{is controlled by the}} exhaust blower installed at the tail of <b>the</b> <b>vapors</b> exhaust pipe. <b>The</b> <b>vapors</b> are timely pumped out of the TDU once the liquids evaporated. The residence time of <b>vapors</b> in <b>the</b> TDU is usually very short.|$|R
5|$|An absorption-re-emission atomic {{line filter}} absorbs the desired {{wavelength}} {{of light and}} emits light that bypasses broadband filters. In passive absorption-re-emission ALFs, a high-pass filter blocks all low-energy incoming light. <b>The</b> <b>vapor</b> cell absorbs the signal, which coincides with the vapor's thin absorption line, and the cell's atoms become excited. <b>The</b> <b>vapor</b> cell then re-emits the signal light by undergoing fluorescence at a lower frequency. A low-pass filter blocks radiation above {{the frequency of the}} fluorescent light. In an active ALF, optical or electrical pumping is used for exciting these atoms so they absorb or emit light of different wavelengths. For active ALFs, other systems of conventional filters may be needed.|$|E
5|$|The band-pass of {{an atomic}} line filter is usually {{equal to the}} Doppler profile of <b>the</b> <b>vapor</b> cell, the natural range of {{frequencies}} at which a vapor cell will be excited by a pure light source. The Doppler profile is {{the width of the}} spectrum of Doppler shifted radiation emitted by <b>the</b> <b>vapor</b> cell due to its thermal motion. This value is less for larger atoms at lower temperatures, a system considered more ideal.|$|E
5|$|The effect {{explains}} supersaturation of vapors. In {{the absence}} of nucleation sites, tiny droplets must form before they can evolve into larger droplets. This requires a vapor pressure many times <b>the</b> <b>vapor</b> pressure at the phase transition point.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Reid <b>vapor</b> {{pressure}} (RVP) differs {{slightly from}} <b>the</b> true <b>vapor</b> pressure (TVP) of a liquid due to small sample vaporization {{and the presence}} of water vapor and air in the confined space of the test equipment. That is, the RVP is <b>the</b> absolute <b>vapor</b> pressure and <b>the</b> TVP is <b>the</b> partial <b>vapor</b> pressure.|$|R
50|$|Spinning band {{distillation}} is {{a technique}} used to separate liquid mixtures which are similar in boiling points. When liquids with similar boiling points are distilled, <b>the</b> <b>vapors</b> are mixtures, and not pure compounds. Fractionating columns help separate the mixture by allowing <b>the</b> mixed <b>vapors</b> to cool, condense, and vaporize again in accordance with Raoult's law. With each condensation-vaporization cycles, <b>the</b> <b>vapors</b> are enriched in a certain component. A larger surface area allows more cycles, improving separation.|$|R

5|$|The next {{component}} in an atomic line filter is <b>the</b> <b>vapor</b> cell; this {{is common to}} all atomic line filters. It either absorbs and re-emits the incident light, or rotates its polarization by the Faraday or Voigt effect. Following <b>the</b> <b>vapor</b> cell is a low-pass filter, designed to block all of the light that the first filter did not, except the designated frequency of light which came from the fluorescence. In Faraday and Voigt filters, a second polarizing plate is used here.|$|E
5|$|While every {{implementation}} of each kind of ALF is different, <b>the</b> <b>vapor</b> cell in each is relatively similar. The thermodynamic properties of vapor cells in filters are carefully controlled because they determine important {{qualities of the}} filter, for instance the necessary strength of the magnetic field. Light is let {{into and out of}} this vapor chamber by way of two low-reflection windows made of a material such as magnesium fluoride. The other sides of the cell may be of any opaque material, though generally a heat-resistant metal or ceramic is used as <b>the</b> <b>vapor</b> is usually kept at temperatures upwards of 100°C.|$|E
5|$|A Voigt filter is a Faraday filter {{with its}} {{magnetic}} field shifted to be {{perpendicular to the}} direction of the light and at 45° to the polarization of the polarized plates. In a Voigt filter, <b>the</b> <b>vapor</b> cell acts as a half wave plate, retarding one polarization by 180° per the Voigt effect.|$|E

5|$|Many {{methods of}} {{decreasing}} the response time of ALFs have been developed.

5|$|After the impact, villagers who had {{approached}} the impact site grew sick from a then-unexplained illness, {{with a wide}} array of symptoms. Two days later, Peruvian scientists confirmed that there had indeed been a meteorite strike, quieting widespread speculation that {{it may have been a}} geophysical rather than a celestial event.

5|$|As {{inert gas}} is {{introduced}} into {{a mixture of}} hydrocarbon vapors and air, it increases the lower flammable limit or lowest concentration at which <b>the</b> <b>vapors</b> can be ignited.

5|$|Loading an {{oil tanker}} {{consists}} primarily of pumping cargo into the ship's tanks. As oil enters <b>the</b> tank, <b>the</b> <b>vapors</b> inside <b>the</b> tank must be somehow expelled.
