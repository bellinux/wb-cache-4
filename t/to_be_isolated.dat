5|$|More recently, {{manifolds}} {{have become}} available which connect the cylinders on the cylinder {{side of the}} valve, leaving the outlet connection of the cylinder valve available for connection of a regulator. This means that the connection cannot be made or broken while the cylinders are pressurised, {{as there is no}} valve to isolate the manifold from the interior of the cylinder. This apparent inconvenience allows a regulator to be connected to each cylinder, and isolated from the internal pressure independently, which allows a malfunctioning regulator on one cylinder <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>isolated</b> while still allowing the regulator on the other cylinder access to all the gas in both cylinders. These manifolds may be plain or may include an isolation valve in the manifold, which allows the contents of the cylinders <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>isolated</b> from each other. This allows the contents of one cylinder <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>isolated</b> and secured for the diver if a leak at the cylinder neck thread, manifold connection, or burst disk on the other cylinder causes its contents to be lost. A relatively uncommon manifold system is a connection which screws directly into the neck threads of both cylinders, and has a single valve to release gas to a connector for a regulator. These manifolds can include a reserve valve, either in the main valve or at one cylinder. This system is mainly of historical interest.|$|E

5|$|Owing {{to their}} {{stability}} and relative ease of preparation, rhodocenium salts are the usual starting material for preparing rhodocene and substituted rhodocenes, {{all of which}} are unstable. The original synthesis used a cyclopentadienyl anion and tris(acetylacetonato)rhodium(III); numerous other approaches have since been reported, including gas-phase redox transmetalation and using half-sandwich precursors. Octaphenylrhodocene (a derivative with eight phenyl groups attached) was the first substituted rhodocene <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>isolated</b> at room temperature, though it decomposes rapidly in air. X-ray crystallography confirmed that octaphenylrhodocene has a sandwich structure with a staggered conformation. Unlike cobaltocene, which has become a useful one-electron reducing agent in research, no rhodocene derivative yet discovered is stable enough for such applications.|$|E
5|$|Among the {{perquisites}} of the Times appointment were {{a company}} {{car and a}} large and splendid office at the paper's building in Printing House Square, London. Levin accepted neither; he could not drive and he hated <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>isolated.</b> He commandeered a desk in the anteroom to the editor's office, a location that kept him closely {{in touch with the}} daily affairs of the paper. It also gave him ready access to the editor, William Rees Mogg, with whom he developed a good friendship. Levin's brief was to write two columns a week (later three) on any subject that he wished. His range was prodigious; he published nine volumes of his selected journalism of which the first, Taking Sides, covered subjects as diverse as the death watch beetle, Field Marshal Montgomery, Wagner, homophobia, censorship, Eldridge Cleaver, arachniphobia, theatrical nudity, and the North Thames Gas Board.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century all of {{the major}} {{pathways}} of drug metabolism had been discovered, along with the outlines of protein and fatty acid metabolism and urea synthesis. In {{the early decades of the}} 20th century, the minor components of foods in human nutrition, the vitamins, began <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>isolated</b> and synthesized. Improved laboratory techniques such as chromatography and electrophoresis led to rapid advances in physiological chemistry, which—as biochemistry—began to achieve independence from its medical origins. In the 1920s and 1930s, biochemists—led by Hans Krebs and Carl and Gerty Cori—began to work out many of the central metabolic pathways of life: the citric acid cycle, glycogenesis and glycolysis, and the synthesis of steroids and porphyrins. Between the 1930s and 1950s, Fritz Lipmann and others established the role of ATP as the universal carrier of energy in the cell, and mitochondria as the powerhouse of the cell. Such traditionally biochemical work continued to be very actively pursued throughout the 20th century and into the 21st.|$|E

5|$|In 1868, Janssen and Lockyer {{independently}} {{observed a}} yellow {{line in the}} solar spectrum that did not match {{that of any other}} element. In 1895, in each case at around the same time, Ramsay, Cleve, and Langlet independently observed helium trapped in cleveite. André-Marie Ampère predicted an element analogous to chlorine obtainable from hydrofluoric acid, and between 1812 and 1886 many researchers tried to obtain it. Fluorine was eventually isolated by Moissan, in 1886. In 1894, Lord Rayleigh and Ramsay discovered argon by comparing the molecular weights of nitrogen prepared by liquefaction from air and nitrogen prepared by chemical means. It was the first noble gas <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>isolated.</b> In 1898, within a period of three weeks, Ramsay and Travers successively separated krypton, neon and xenon from liquid argon by their differences in boiling points. In 1898, Dorn discovered a radioactive gas resulting from the radioactive decay of radium; Ramsay and Robert Whytlaw-Gray subsequently isolated radon in 1910.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, {{experiments}} using minced muscle cells {{demonstrated that}} cellular respiration using one oxygen atom can form two adenosine triphosphate (ATP) molecules, and, in 1941, {{the concept of}} the phosphate bonds of ATP being a form of energy in cellular metabolism was developed by Fritz Albert Lipmann. In the following years, the mechanism behind cellular respiration was further elaborated, although its link to the mitochondria was not known. The introduction of tissue fractionation by Albert Claude allowed mitochondria <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>isolated</b> from other cell fractions and biochemical analysis to be conducted on them alone. In 1946, he concluded that cytochrome oxidase and other enzymes responsible for the respiratory chain were isolated to the mitchondria. Eugene Kennedy and Albert Lehninger discovered in 1948 that mitochondria are the site of oxidative phosphorylation in eukaryotes. Over time, the fractionation method was further developed, improving the quality of the mitochondria isolated, and other elements of cell respiration were determined to occur in the mitochondria.|$|E

5|$|Octaphenylrhodocene, , is {{the first}} rhodocene {{derivative}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>isolated</b> at room temperature. Its olive green crystals decompose rapidly in solution, and within minutes in air, demonstrating a dramatically greater air sensitivity than the analogous cobalt complex, although it is significantly more stable than rhodocene itself. This difference is attributed to the relatively lower stability of the rhodium(II) state {{as compared to the}} cobalt(II) state. The reduction potential for the + cation (measured in dimethylformamide relative the ferrocenium / ferrocene couple) is −1.44V, consistent with the greater thermodynamic stabilisation of the rhodocene by the C5HPh4 ligand compared with the C5H5 or C5Me5 ligands. Cobaltocene is a useful one-electron reducing agent in the research laboratory as it is soluble in non-polar organic solvents, and its redox couple is sufficiently well behaved that it may be used as an internal standard in cyclic voltammetry. No substituted rhodocene yet prepared has demonstrated sufficient stability to be used in a similar way.|$|E
5|$|The Pacific {{electric}} ray and its relatives {{are used as}} model organisms for biomedical research, because their electric organs contain an abundance of important nervous system proteins such as nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and acetylcholinesterase. In the 1970s and 1980s, acetylcholine receptors from this species and the marbled {{electric ray}} (T.marmorata) became the first neurotransmitter receptors <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>isolated</b> and sequenced, in what {{is considered to be}} a landmark success in the field of neurobiology. This led to a number of further advances, one of the most significant being the elucidation of the pathophysiology underlying the disease myasthenia gravis. A small commercial fishery in southern California supplies Pacific electric rays for research purposes; as of 2005 this fishery may have employed as few as two fishers. Otherwise, this ray has no economic value. It is caught incidentally by commercial trawl and gillnet fisheries, and on hook-and-line by sport anglers. These activities appear to have little impact on its population, leading it to be listed under Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Fishing for this ray is not managed by the Pacific Fishery Management Council.|$|E
5|$|While the BTO {{is able to}} {{determine}} {{the distance between the}} satellite and the aircraft at the time of each handshake, it was still necessary {{to determine}} where along the BTO arcs the aircraft was. To accomplish this, an analysis was performed on another attribute of received signals that was recorded by the ground station: the burst frequency offset (BFO)—the difference between the expected and actual frequencies of the signal received from the aircraft. The BFO is primarily caused by the Doppler shift—a shift in frequency caused by the relative movement of the aircraft, satellite, and ground station—along with several other factors which can be calculated and removed, allowing the Doppler shift between the aircraft and satellite <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>isolated.</b> The Doppler shift between the aircraft and satellite indicates the relative motion of the aircraft relative to the satellite, although multiple combinations of aircraft speed and heading exist that match a given Doppler shift value.|$|E

50|$|However, many extinct {{languages}} are very poorly attested, {{and the fact}} that they cannot <b>be</b> linked <b>to</b> other languages may be a reflection of our poor knowledge of them.

In September, Colonel D. A. Sandford arrived to run the project but until the Italian declaration of war, the conspiracy was held back by the British policy of appeasement, intended to avoid a simultaneous war with Germany and Italy. Mission 101 was formed to co-ordinate the activities of the Ethiopian resistance, known as the Arbegnoch. In June 1940, Haile Selassie arrived in Egypt and in July, went to Sudan to meet Platt and discuss plans to re-capture Ethiopia, despite Platt's reservations. In July, the British recognised Selassie as emperor of Ethiopia and in August, Mission 101 entered Gojjam province to reconnoitre. Sandford requested that supply routes to the area north of Lake Tana be established before the rains ended and that Selassie should return in October as a catalyst for the uprising. Gaining control of Gojjam required the Italian garrisons <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>isolated</b> along the main road from Bahrdar Giorgis south of Lake Tana, to Dangila, Debra Markos and Addis Ababa, to prevent them concentrating against the Arbegnoch.
