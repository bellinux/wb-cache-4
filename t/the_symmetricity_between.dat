40|$|In this work, {{we look at}} the {{symmetry}} of normal modes in symmetric structures, particularly structures with cyclic symmetry. We show that normal modes of symmetric structures have different levels of symmetry, or symmetricity. One novel theoretical result of this work is that, for a ring structure with $m$ subunits, <b>the</b> <b>symmetricity</b> of <b>the</b> normal modes falls into $m$ groups of equal size, with normal modes in each group having <b>the</b> same <b>symmetricity.</b> <b>The</b> normal modes in each group can be computed separately, using a much smaller amount of memory and time (up to $m^ 3 $ less), thus making it applicable to larger complexes. We show that normal modes with perfect symmetry or anti-symmetry have no degeneracy {{while the rest of the}} modes have a degeneracy of two. We show also how symmetry in normal modes correlates with symmetry in structure. While a broken symmetry in structure generally leads to a loss of symmetricity in symmetric normal modes, <b>the</b> <b>symmetricity</b> of some symmetric normal modes is preserved even when symmetry in structure is broken. This work suggests a deeper reason for the existence of symmetric complexes: that they may be formed not only for structural purpose, but likely also for a dynamical reason, that certain symmetry is needed by a given complex to obtain certain symmetric motions that are functionally critical...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} {{a swarm of}} autonomous mobile robots {{each of which is}} an anonymous point in the three-dimensional Euclidean space (3 D-space) and synchronously executes a common distributed algorithm. We investigate the pattern formation problem that requires the robots to form a given target pattern from an initial configuration and characterize the problem by showing a necessary and sufficient condition for the robots to form a given target pattern. The pattern formation problem in the two dimensional Euclidean space (2 D-space) has been investigated by Suzuki and Yamashita (SICOMP 1999, TCS 2010), and Fujinaga et al. (SICOMP 2015). <b>The</b> <b>symmetricity</b> ρ(P) of a configuration (i. e., the positions of robots) P is intuitively the order of the cyclic group that acts on P. It has been shown that fully-synchronous (FSYNC) robots can form a target pattern F from an initial configuration P if and only if ρ(P) divides ρ(F). We extend <b>the</b> notion of <b>symmetricity</b> to 3 D-space by using the rotation groups each of which is defined by a set of rotation axes and their arrangement. We define <b>the</b> <b>symmetricity</b> ϱ(P) of configuration P in 3 D-space as the set of rotation groups that acts on P and whose rotation axes do not contain any robot. We show the following necessary and sufficient condition for the pattern formation problem which is a natural extension of the existing results of the pattern formation problem in 2 D-space: FSYNC robots in 3 D-space can form a target pattern F from an initial configuration P if and only if ϱ(P) ⊆ϱ(F). For solvable instances, we present a pattern formation algorithm for oblivious FSYNC robots. The insight of this paper is that symmetry of mobile robots in 3 D-space is sometimes lower than the symmetry of their positions and the robots can show their symmetry by their movement...|$|R
40|$|The {{shape of}} an ogee {{spillway}} {{is based on the}} shape of the lower nappe of water flowing over an aerated sharp-crested weir. At the design discharge, this shape minimises the possibility of sub-atmospheric pressure occurring on the spillway and maximises the discharge across the spillway. The formulae that are currently in use to approximate the ogee profile consider only two-dimensional flow parameters, being the depth of flow over the spillway crest, the inclination of the upstream wall face, and the pool depth upstream of the spillway. The current formulae for the ogee shape, does not consider the influence of three-dimensional flow. The most significant three-dimensional flow parameters that could affect the shape of the lower nappe are the flow velocity distribution upstream of the spillway, the orientation or angle of the water approaching the spillway, the asymmetrical cross-section of the approach channel, and the curvature of the dam wall. This paper reflects the influence of asymmetrical flow in the approach channel. The investigation was based on a physical model constructed at the Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS). The inclination of the model’s sidewalls of the upstream approach channel was varied to cause a change in <b>the</b> <b>symmetricity,</b> while <b>the</b> lower nappe profile was routinely measured. It was found that the flow in the asymmetrical approach channel caused a variation from the theoretical estimated ogee profile. A comparison between the measured nappe profile and the currently used formulae was investigated. It can be concluded that <b>the</b> <b>symmetricity</b> of <b>the</b> approach channel influences the shape of the bottom nappe, which differs from the shape as proposed by the current ogee formulae. It is recommended that three-dimensional flow should be examined when designing an ogee spillway. [URL]...|$|R

We {{extend to}} white noise {{integrals}} the scalar type integrator inequalities introduced by Accardi, Fagnola and Quaegebeur [1] as a generalization of the Hudson–Parthasarathy basic estimates on stochastic integrals.

The white noise approach to stochastic calculus emerged, between 1993 and 1995, from the stochas-tic limit of quantum theory as a new approach [7] to both classical and quantum stochastic calculus [9], [16].

30|$|For more insight, in Fig.  8, the outage {{and delay}} {{performance}} are compared once again. In the figure, {{we take the}} power adjusting factor λ[*]=[*] 1.3. Comparing Figs.  7 a and 8 a, {{we see that the}} increase of the power adjusting factor λ yields the loss in the outage performance of the weight-based MLS schemes. For example, when L[*]=[*] 20, Fig.  8 a shows that the weight-based MLS schemes only achieve the power gain of 3  dB over the traditional MLS schemes at 10 − 4 of outage probability. On the contrary, Fig.  8 b shows that the average packet delays for the proposed weight-based MLS schemes are decreasing with the power adjusting factor λ. This {{is due to the fact}} that the outage probability of relay systems is increasing with <b>the</b> <b>symmetricity</b> of relay channels. When the channels are symmetric entirely, the relay systems achieve the optimal outage performance. Therefore, we have the result that the increasing power factor yields the increasing outage probability. However, when the equivalent power of R-D links is greater than the one of S-R links, the probability that one R-D link is selected is greater than the one that one S-R link is did. The results from Figs.  7 and 8 indicate that in practical application, the power adjusting factor λ should be jointly determined by the maximum delay, maximum outage probability, etc. As a result, the proposed W-MLS scheme is a delay-diversity trade-off scheme.|$|R

For example, the group algebra is a symmetric algebra {{and this is not}} always the case for the Mackey algebra. In this paper we present a systematic approach to the question of <b>the</b> <b>symmetricity</b> of <b>the</b> Mackey algebra, by producing symmetric associative bilinear forms for the Mackey algebra. The category of Mackey functors is a closed symmetric monoidal category, so using the formalism of J. P. May for these categories, S. Bouc has defined the so-called Burnside trace. Using this Burnside trace we produce trace maps for Mackey algebras which generalize the usual trace map the group algebras. These trace maps factorise through Burnside algebras. We prove that the Mackey algebra μ_R(G) is a symmetric algebra if and only if the family of Burnside algebras (RB(H)) _H≤ G is a family of symmetric algebras with a compatibility condition. As a corollary, we recover the well known fact that over a field of characteristic zero, the Mackey algebra is always symmetric. Over the ring of integers the Mackey algebra of G is symmetric if and only if the order of G is square free.

A relation of entanglement in pure {{state with the}} mean value of spin is given, thus, at the experimental level the local measurement of spin may allow to find the value of entanglement. The obtained form of the measure {{is applied to the}} explicit characterization of bipartite entanglement for $n$-qubit systems in the Werner state, Dicke state, GHZ state and trigonometric states. In particular for Werner-like states the rule of sums is found and it is shown that deviations from <b>the</b> <b>symmetricity</b> of such states diminishes the amount of entanglement. For Dicke states the maximal value of bipartite entanglement is achieved when number of excitations is half {{of the total number of}} qubits in these states. For trigonometric states the bipartite entanglement is maximal and does not depend on the number of qubits. We also consider entanglement of discrete-continuous systems on the example of entanglement of spin with continuous variables of electron. The relation of entanglement with the mean value of spin is very useful for calculation of entanglement. With the help of this relation we find in explicit form the entanglement of the one spin with the rest in a spin chain during the evolution determined by the Ising Hamiltonian.

Many standards {{have been developed}} to identify test conditions. EN 442 standard specifies test room properties, temperature measurements and heat output calculations for radiators. In this study, the heat dissipation capabilities of three different panel radiators were determined by using numerical methods. The height and length of the tested radiators were 600 mm and 1000 mm, respectively. An experimental study was conducted in the standard test room in order to determine boundary conditions for computational study and verify numerical results. Tests were carried out in three different operating conditions. Twelve measurements were performed in each condition when test room reached steady state. Turbulent typed air flow in the test room and water flow inside the tested radiators were simulated. Temperature and velocity contours in virtual test room are also investigated in this study. Non uniform temperature distribution on the front surface of tested radiators was observed. It is seen that <b>the</b> <b>symmetricity</b> in velocity contours is distorted by using more complex radiator models and increasing excess temperature.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this line of {{research}} is {{to determine whether the}} ‘Digitizer’ is a reliable and valid way to measure cognitive load during dual working memory-drawing tasks. A quasi-experimental study was conducted at the University of Arkansas in a research laboratory, and participants included seven right-handed healthy adults with normal or corrected vision and no reading difficulty. The participants were selected on a volunteer basis. The study required participants to draw circles while continuously performing in three conditions – one baseline and two working memory experimental tasks, administered in counterbalanced order. The baseline task was to read an 8 th grade level passage at comfortable speed and loudness level. The working memory tasks were symmetry span and operation span tasks. The operation span task required the participants to remember letters in sequence while simultaneously verifying arithmetic operations presented after each letter. The symmetry span task required participants to remember the position of the highlighted square in a grid in sequence while simultaneously determining <b>the</b> <b>symmetricity</b> of a figure presented afterwards. Both tasks were completed while drawing continuous circles on the ‘Digitizer’. A separate repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted for each measure. A significant omnibus effect was found for the stroke duration measure only. Post-hoc paired tests showed that baseline was higher (p=. 01) in stroke duration than in operation span task and symmetry span task. In this literature review, the results and elements of the study are described in full to inform future research. It was initially assumed that the working memory load would be significantly less in the baseline task as compared to the two working memory tasks; however, the data alternatively indicated that it taxed working memory more.

40|$|Users of myoelectric {{prostheses}} {{can often}} find them difficult to control. This {{can lead to}} passive-use of the device or total rejection, which can have {{detrimental effects on the}} contralateral limb due to overuse. Current clinically available prostheses are ‘open loop’ systems, and although considerable effort has been focused on developing biofeedback to “close the loop”, there is evidence from laboratory-based studies that other factors, notably improving predictability of response, may be as, if not more, important. Interestingly, despite a large volume of research aimed at improving myoelectric prostheses, it is not currently known which aspect of clinically available systems has the greatest impact on overall functionality and everyday usage. A protocol has therefore been designed to assess EMG skill of the user and predictability of the prosthesis response as significant parts of the control chain, and to relate these to functionality and everyday usage. Here we present the protocol and results from early pilot work. A set of experiments has been developed. Firstly to characterize user skill in generating the required level of EMG signal, as well as the speed with which users are able to make the decision to activate the appropriate muscles. Secondly, to measure unpredictability introduced at the skin-electrode interface, {{in order to understand the}} effects of the socket mounted electrode fit under different loads on the variability of time taken for the prosthetic hand to respond.

40|$|The {{epicycle}} gearbox or {{planetary gearbox}} (PG) {{is a central}} power transmission systems of important machines such as helicopters and wind turbines which are mission critical and high cost systems. Condition monitoring (CM) has been explored extensively {{in recent years to}} avoid any unexpected interruptions and severe accidences caused by faults PGs. Although, considerable advancements in CM techniques, there still existed significant deficiency such as insensitivity, false diagnosis and high costs in implementing such techniques in industries. To improve CM techniques, therefore, this thesis focuses on an investigation of advanced signal analysis techniques such as higher order spectra (HOS) in order to achieve full characterisation of the nonlinear modulation processes of PG dynamics and thereby develop accurate diagnostic techniques. The lumped mass model is established for modelling the dynamic behaviour of the PG under investigation, which allows the vibration behaviours to be understood for analysing different abnormalities such as tooth breakages and gear errors. This paves the way for subsequent data analytics and fault diagnostics using modulation signal bispectrum (MSB) that allows the vibration data to be examined through HOS, but it is significantly efficient in characterising the multiple and nonlinear modulations of PG dynamics alongside superior noise reduction performance. Different degrees of misalignments in the PG drive system has been investigated and successfully diagnosed using MSB analysis of vibration measurements [...] Moreover, the investigation included detection of tooth breakage faults of different severities in both the sun and a planet gear. The tooth faults were diagnosed using the recently developed MSB through accurately representation and estimate of residual sidebands induced by these faults. Consequently, MSB analysis produces an accurate and reliable diagnosis in that it gives correct indication of the fault severity and location for wide operating conditions. Furthermore, these fault diagnosis practices allows the establishment of residual sideband analysis approach. These residual sidebands resulting from the out-of-phase superposition of vibration waves due to asymmetric, multiple meshing sources are much less influenced by gear errors than the in-phase sidebands due to faults or new occurrences of <b>the</b> <b>symmetricity.</b> MSB can provide an accurate characterisation of the residual sidebands and consequently produces consistent diagnosis as confirmed by both simulation and experiment...|$|R

Knees were read for cartilage damage, bone marrow lesions (BMLs), and meniscal damage according to the Whole-Organ Magnetic Resonance Imaging Score (WORMS) system. Chi 2 tests were used to compare the proportion of knees with unilateral tissue pathology to the proportion what would be expected if both knees were independent. We further used percent agreement and linear weighted kappa statistics to describe agreement of cartilage damage and BMLs in the same articular plates. Results 51. 2 % of participants were men, mean age was 52. 1 (± 6. 2), mean BMI was 29. 0  kg/m 2 (± 4. 1). All plates showed a significant higher degree of symmetricity for cartilage damage as evidenced by weighted kappas ranging from 0. 32 to 0. 59. For BMLs <b>the</b> degree of <b>symmetricity</b> was higher for the patella, trochlea, medial tibia, lateral femur, and medial femur; for meniscal damage the degree of unilaterality was lower for all medial meniscal subregions but not all lateral. Kappas ranged between 0. 52 and 0. 68 for cartilage and 0. 30 and 0. 55 for BMLs for the four subregions with highest agreement. ConclusionA higher degree of symmetricity of tissue damage than expected by chance was observed in this cohort of subjects with knee pain...|$|R
