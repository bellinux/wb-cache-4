5|$|<b>Trench</b> raiding {{involved}} making small-scale surprise {{attacks on}} enemy positions, {{often in the}} middle of the night for reasons of stealth. All belligerents employed <b>trench</b> raiding as a tactic to harass their enemy and gain intelligence. In the Canadian Corps <b>trench</b> raiding developed into a training and leadership-building mechanism. The size of a raid would normally be anything from a few men to an entire company, or more, depending on the size of the mission. The four months before the April attack saw the Canadian Corps execute no fewer than 55 separate <b>trench</b> raids. Competition between units even developed with units competing for the honour of the greatest number of prisoners captured or most destruction wrought. The policy of aggressive <b>trench</b> raiding was not without its cost. A large-scale <b>trench</b> raid on 13 February 1917, involving 900 men from the 4th Canadian Division, resulted in 150 casualties. An even more ambitious <b>trench</b> raid on 1 March 1917, once again by the 4th Canadian Division, failed and resulted in 637 casualties including two battalion commanders and a number of company commanders killed. This experience did not lessen the extent to which the Canadian Corps employed <b>trench</b> raiding with raids being conducted nightly between 20 March and the opening of the offensive on 9 April, resulting in approximately 1,400 additional Canadian casualties. The Germans operated an active patrolling policy and although not as large and ambitious as those of the Canadian Corps, they also engaged in <b>trench</b> raiding. As an example, a German <b>trench</b> raid launched by 79 men against the 3rd Canadian Division on 15 March 1917 was successful in capturing prisoners and causing damage.|$|E
5|$|But by {{the time}} he {{captured}} the position, the rest of his company lay dead or wounded. Singh was left alone to achieve the objective assigned. He advanced towards the second Pakistani medium machine gun post. At this juncture, he was almost blinded by a grenade that blast at his face. His Sten gun ammunition had run out. Singh moved out of the <b>trench</b> and lobbed grenades at the next Pakistani post. Meanwhile, he jumped into another <b>trench,</b> and killed two Pakistani soldiers with his bayonet. Before he was able {{to move out of the}} <b>trench,</b> he was hit by a bullet in his head. As he succumbed to his wounds, Singh hurled a grenade into a nearby Pakistani <b>trench.</b>|$|E
50|$|Another {{technique}} that is useful is contour <b>trenching.</b> This involves the digging of 150m long, 1m deep <b>trenches</b> in the soil. The <b>trenches</b> are made {{parallel to the}} height lines of the landscape, preventing the water from flowing within the <b>trenches</b> and causing erosion. Stone walls are placed around the <b>trenches</b> to prevent the <b>trenches</b> from closing up again. The method was invented by Peter Westerveld.|$|R

5|$|From 1916 the Stokes light <b>trench</b> mortar {{was issued}} to {{infantry}} {{to replace a}} range of <b>trench</b> catapults and smaller <b>trench</b> mortars, whilst it was also used in a battery at brigade-level to provide organic indirect fire support. In addition, individual soldiers often used a range of personnel weapons including knives, clubs, knuckle-dusters, revolvers and pistols. Snipers on the Western Front used Pattern 1914 Enfield sniper rifles with telescopic sights. Light horsemen also carried bayonets (as they were initially considered mounted infantry), although the Australian Mounted Division adopted cavalry swords in late 1917. Artillery included 18-pounders which equipped the field batteries, 4.5-inch howitzers used by the howitzer batteries, and 8-inch and 9.2-inch howitzers which equipped the heavy (siege) batteries. The 9.45-inch heavy mortar equipped a heavy <b>trench</b> mortar battery, while medium <b>trench</b> mortar batteries were equipped with the 2-inch medium mortar, and later the 6-inch mortar. Light Horse units were supported by British and Indian artillery. The main mount used by the light horse was the Waler, while draught horses were used by the artillery and for wheeled transport. Camels were also used, both as mounts and transport, and donkeys and mules were used as pack animals.|$|E

5|$|The {{island of}} Java {{is the most}} densely {{populated}} island on earth, and is vulnerable to both large earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, due to its location near the Sunda <b>Trench,</b> a convergent plate boundary where the Australian tectonic plate is subducting beneath Indonesia. Three great earthquakes occurred {{in the span of}} three years to the northwest on the Sumatra portion of the <b>trench.</b> The 2004 M9.15 Sumatra–Andaman, the 2005 M8.7 Nias–Simeulue, and the 2007 M8.4 Mentawai earthquakes produced the largest release of elastic strain energy since the 1957/1964 series of shocks on the Aleutian/Alaska <b>Trench.</b>|$|E
5|$|The men at {{the front}} had to {{struggle}} with supply problems–there was a shortage of food; and disease was rife in the damp, rat-infested conditions. Along with enemy action, many soldiers {{had to contend with}} new diseases: <b>trench</b> foot, <b>trench</b> fever and <b>trench</b> nephritis. When the war ended in November 1918, British Army casualties, as the result of enemy action and disease, were recorded as 673,375 killed and missing, with another 1,643,469 wounded. The rush to demobilise {{at the end of the}} conflict substantially decreased the strength of the British Army, from its peak strength of 4,000,000 men in 1918 to 370,000 men by 1920.|$|E
5|$|There {{were three}} {{trenches}} {{in a typical}} front line sector; the fire <b>trench,</b> the support <b>trench</b> and the reserve <b>trench,</b> all joined by communication trenches. The trenches varied in depth, but they were usually {{about four or five}} feet deep, or in areas with a high water table a wall of sandbags would be built to allow the defenders to stand upright, fire trenches were provided with a fire step, so the occupants could return fire during an attack (see diagram). Ideally, the bottom of the <b>trench</b> was lined with duckboards to prevent men from sinking into the mud and dugouts were cut into the walls, these gave shelter from the elements and shrapnel, although in the British Army dugouts were usually reserved for the officers and senior NCOs. The men were then expected to sleep wherever they could and in wet weather they lived under groundsheets or in tents {{at the bottom of the}} <b>trench</b> on the duckboards.|$|E

According to witness reports, Bleak rushed the <b>trench</b> and dove into it, tackling one Chinese soldier and, with only his hands, broke the soldier's neck, killing him. Bleak was then confronted by a second soldier, whom he reportedly grabbed by the neck, fatally crushing his windpipe. A third Chinese soldier then approached, and in the ensuing scuffle, Bleak used his combat knife to stab and kill the soldier.|$|E
5|$|At 06:00, Howell, who was {{in charge}} of a post to the right of the line, noticed the {{battalion}} on the right flank was being forced out of its <b>trench</b> and was beginning to retire. Immediately alerting battalion headquarters, Captain Alexander MacKenzie—who had assumed temporary command of the battalion—hurriedly organised a group of non-combatant soldiers from headquarters together with several signallers to form a defensive line along a road bank in order to fend off the expected German advance. A fierce bombing and grenade fight soon ensued, with both sides suffering heavy casualties. Fearing the Germans would outflank his battalion, Howell climbed onto the top of the parapet and began running along the <b>trench</b> line throwing bombs down on the Germans, all the while being subject to heavy rifle and bomb fire. Forcing the Germans back along the <b>trench,</b> Howell was supported by Lieutenant Thomas Richards who followed him along the <b>trench</b> firing bursts from his Lewis Gun. Soon exhusting his supply of bombs, Howell began to attack with his bayonet until he fell into the <b>trench</b> wounded. Howell had been hit in both legs by machine gun fire, and when he was brought into the clearing station some hours later, it was discovered he had suffered at least twenty-eight separate wounds. Due to his actions, the ground which had been lost was soon retaken, and the German attack was later repulsed.|$|E
5|$|Chambers and {{his second}} in command, Captain Charles Spragg, {{immediately}} set about constructing a defensive <b>trench</b> across the post, and strengthening its other defences. But by now the Turks, from the 72nd Infantry Regiment, about 1,000-strong, had managed to use the terrain and darkness to close in on the position. At 22:00 Chambers reported that the position was under attack and surrounded, and at 23:35 the telephone line to headquarters was cut by the Turks. The area in front of No.3 Post was in a gully {{and out of sight}} to the defenders, so they had to climb on the <b>trench</b> parapet to engage the Turks. This tactic worked well, and they broke up the Turkish assault, causing the attackers some casualties. The Turks did not withdraw far, and crept up {{to the edge of the}} New Zealanders' <b>trench</b> during the night. They then threw hand grenades into the New Zealanders' position. At the same time, small arms fire from the surrounding Turkish positions pinned the New Zealanders down.|$|E

5|$|He {{recognised}} German {{skill in}} constructing <b>trench</b> parapets: by {{making use of}} an irregular top and face to the parapet, and constructing it from material of varying composition, {{the presence of a}} sniper or an observer poking his head up became much less conspicuous.

40|$|In {{this study}} we draw {{attention}} to the inherent variability in the results of trial <b>trenching,</b> when taking into account the countless variations in orientation and positioning of <b>trenches.</b> Grids of trial <b>trenches</b> were simulated time and again on the excavation plans of 16 archaeological sites from Flanders, Belgium. Orientation and positioning of the grid layout was shifted randomly, whilst the area coverage varied from 2. 5 % to 80 %. The intersection rates of the archaeological features allow to gain more insight in trends and variability that are inherent to the chosen design of trial <b>trenches.</b> It is assessed how robust a chosen grid layout performs on (multi-period) archaeological sites and how variable these results might be. The most effective layout appears to be a grid with short, parallel and discontinuous <b>trenches</b> or a standard grid, closely followed by 2 m wide continuous <b>trenches.</b> Implementing 4 m wide <b>trenches</b> reduces the effectiveness of the latter method substantially. When the area coverage of the <b>trenches</b> is below 10 %, the results of the archaeological prospection become unreliable and can potentially lead to a substantial over-or underestimation of the actual feature density on the site...|$|R
