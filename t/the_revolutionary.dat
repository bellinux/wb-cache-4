5|$|Although Lenin was {{influenced}} by agrarian-socialist Pëtr Tkachëvi, he and the Social-Democrats clashed with the Socialist–Revolutionary Party (SR), who were inspired by the defunct People's Freedom Party. Advocating a Narodnik agrarian-socialist platform, the SR emphasised <b>the</b> <b>revolutionary</b> role of the peasant, who in 1881 numbered 75 million, {{in contrast to the}} 1 million urban proletariat in Russia. In contrast, the Marxists believed that the peasant class' primary motivation was to own their land, and that they were capitalists; instead, they saw the proletariat as <b>the</b> <b>revolutionary</b> force to advance socialism.|$|E

40|$|When revolutionaries or insurgents, broadly defined, indiscriminately attack civilians, they {{generally}} attack "complicitous civilians, " i. e., those categories of noncombatants which <b>the</b> <b>revolutionaries</b> see as benefiting from, supporting and/or having a substantial capacity {{to influence the}} states that <b>the</b> <b>revolutionaries</b> are attempting to displace or overthrow. Such "categorical " terrorism will be most extensive when revolutionaries view these states (or complicitous civilians themselves) as perpetrators of extensive, indiscriminate violence against <b>the</b> <b>revolutionaries</b> and their constituents. However, if significant numbers of complicitous civilians are seen by rebel groups as potential supporters (or as capable of being influenced by nonviolent appeals or protests), then {{they will not be}} indiscriminately attacked. Whether specific categories of civilians will be perceived as potential allies by revolutionaries depends mainly on the prior history of political interaction and cooperation between these civilians and <b>the</b> <b>revolutionaries.</b> Categorical terrorism is most likely where there has been little such interaction or cooperation, resulting in weak political alliances between <b>the</b> <b>revolutionaries</b> and complicitous civilians —for example, where <b>the</b> <b>revolutionaries</b> and complicitous civilian...|$|R

5|$|The Afghan people revolted {{against the}} PDPA {{government}} {{when the government}} introduced several socialist reforms, including land reforms. By early 1979, twenty-five out of Afghanistan's twenty-eight provinces were unsafe because of armed resistance against the government. On 29 March 1979, the Herat uprising began; the uprising turned the revolt into an open war between the Mujahideen and the Afghan government. It was during this period that Amin became Kabul's strongman. Shortly after the Herat uprising had been crushed, <b>the</b> <b>Revolutionary</b> Council convened to ratify the new Five-Year Plan, the Afghan–Soviet Friendship Treaty, and to vote {{on whether or not}} to reorganise the cabinet and to enhance the power of the executive (the Chairman of <b>the</b> <b>Revolutionary</b> Council). While the official version of events said that all issues were voted on democratically at the meeting, <b>the</b> <b>Revolutionary</b> Council held another meeting the following day to ratify the new Five-Year Plan and to discuss the reorganisation of the cabinet.|$|E
5|$|After the Saur revolution, Taraki was {{appointed}} Chairman of the Presidium of <b>the</b> <b>Revolutionary</b> Council and Chairman of the Council of Ministers, and retained his post as PDPA general secretary. Taraki initially formed a government {{which consisted of}} both Khalqists and Parchamites; Karmal became Deputy Chairman of <b>the</b> <b>Revolutionary</b> Council while Amin became Minister of Foreign Affairs and a Deputy Prime Minister, and Mohammad Aslam Watanjar became a Deputy Prime Minister. The two Parchamites Abdul Qadir and Mohammad Rafi became Minister of National Defence and Minister of Public Works respectively. According to Angel Rasanayagam, the appointment of Amin, Karmal and Watanjar as Deputy Prime Ministers led {{to the establishment of}} three cabinets; the Khalqists were answerable to Amin, the Parchamites were answerable to Karmal, and the military officers (who were Parchamites) were answerable to Watanjar. The first conflict between the Khalqists and Parchamites arose when the Khalqists wanted to give PDPA Central Committee membership to the military officers who participated in the Saur Revolution. Amin, who had previously opposed the appointment of military officers to the PDPA leadership, switched sides; he now supported their elevation. The PDPA Politburo voted in favour of giving membership to the military officers; the victors (the Khalqists) portrayed the Parchamites as opportunists, implying that the Parchamites had ridden <b>the</b> <b>revolutionary</b> wave, but not actually participated in the revolution. To make matters worse for the Parchamites, the term Parcham was, according to Taraki, a word synonymous with factionalism.|$|E
5|$|At first <b>the</b> <b>revolutionary</b> {{movement}} was uncertain whether {{to destroy the}} prison, to reoccupy it as a fortress {{with members of the}} volunteer guard militia, or to preserve it intact as a permanent revolutionary monument. <b>The</b> <b>revolutionary</b> leader Mirabeau eventually settled the matter by symbolically starting the destruction of the battlements himself, after which a panel of five experts was appointed by the Permanent Committee of the Hôtel de Ville to manage the demolition of the castle. One of these experts was Pierre-François Palloy, a bourgeois entrepreneur who claimed vainqueur status for his role during the taking of the Bastille, and he rapidly assumed control over the entire process. Palloy's team worked quickly and by November most of the fortress had been destroyed.|$|E

In 1956 he was one of three Muhammadiyah members who presented their concept of a truly Islamic society, one which emphasised social education. During this time he was more active with Masyumi, and after the 1955 Constituent Assembly election, Fakih was made a member of the Constitutional Assembly of Indonesia. This assembly, meant to reach an agreement for a new national constitution, failed to gain a consensus, and was disbanded by president Sukarno with his decree of 5 July 1959. That year Fakih collaborated with Hamka, Joesoef Poear Abdullah, and Ahmad Joesoef to launch the magazine Pandji Masjarakat. Sukarno later disbanded Masyumi on 17 August 1960 after leading Masyumi members, such as Mohammad Natsir and Sjafruddin Prawiranegara, were involved with <b>the</b> <b>Revolutionary</b> Government of the Republic of Indonesia; Fakih had been involved in the negotiations with <b>the</b> <b>Revolutionary</b> Government, working with Mohammad Roem.|$|E
