5|$|Criticism {{focused on}} {{particular}} {{aspects of the}} game. Miller considered the inability to save progress a drawback since gamers will {{have to play the}} entire game in one sitting if <b>they</b> <b>wish</b> to complete it. Rignall described the audio and visuals as being outdated in comparison to games on the Mega Drive and Super NES (the latter platform having already been launched in other regions by the time Super Mario Bros. 3 was released in Europe).|$|E
5|$|The States may, if <b>they</b> <b>wish,</b> permit {{abortion}} on demand, but the Constitution {{does not require}} them to do so. The permissibility of abortion, and the limitations upon it, are to be resolved like most important questions in our democracy: by citizens trying to persuade one another and then voting.|$|E
5|$|Using the Geneforge {{to empower}} {{himself and his}} followers, the Barzites, Barzahl intends to bestow god-like {{abilities}} on himself and his followers within the city of Rising. Barzahl cut off contact with Drypeak, preparing to repel the inevitable assault of the Shaper Council, who <b>they</b> <b>wish</b> to remain independent from. The Takers, a faction of intelligent serviles who had originated on Sucia Island, were given powers by Barzahl because they worked for him. In turn the Takers created powerful dragon-like beasts called drakons, taught the drakons how to create life themselves, and betrayed Barzahl. The Takers stand for the total destruction of the Shaper Council. The Awakened, the other servile faction in Geneforge 2, believe that Shapers should treat them as equals. They had {{been working with the}} Barzites, but the Awakened's leader Learned Pinner rejected the Barzites' view that serviles need to be controlled. Trade and communications between Zakary's now Shaper Council loyalist Drypeak and the other three factions have ceased, replaced with spies and subterfuge. The player is free to decide which faction <b>they</b> <b>wish</b> to join, if any, and to explore the game world, reacting to the characters and situations they encounter.|$|E

5|$|Astronomical data {{taken with}} CCDs must undergo several {{calibration}} steps {{before they are}} suitable for astronomical analysis. STScI has developed sophisticated software that automatically calibrates data when they are requested from the archive using the best calibration files available. This 'on-the-fly' processing means that large data requests can take a day or more to be processed and returned. The process by which data is calibrated automatically is known as 'pipeline reduction', and is increasingly common at major observatories. Astronomers may if <b>they</b> <b>wish</b> retrieve the calibration files themselves and run the pipeline reduction software locally. This may be desirable when calibration files other than those selected automatically need to be used.|$|E
5|$|Caspian {{invites the}} Telmarines {{to remain in}} Narnia if they will coexist peacefully with the Narnians; but if <b>they</b> <b>wish,</b> they can return to the human world from which they {{originally}} came to Narnia. Some, including General Glozelle, agree to do so, and Aslan creates a portal for them and the four Pevensies. Susan kisses Caspian, knowing they will never meet again, as Aslan told her and Peter that they will never return to Narnia. The Pevensies return to England, leaving Caspian as King.|$|E
5|$|Courses vary {{in length}} {{from a few}} weeks to two years. There are no formal {{academic}} requirements for entry into RNC, but potential students are invited to attend an assessment at the college before being offered a place to determine the level of support they will need during their studies. The assessment typically includes an evaluation of a person's level of vision, their mobility and independence skills, any residential support they may require, basic literacy and numeracy skills tests, and an interview with the leader of the course <b>they</b> <b>wish</b> to take.|$|E

5|$|Dirge of Cerberus is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} third-person shooter. Battles occur in real-time, with the HUD displaying {{information such as}} Vincent's hit points and magic points, the currently selected item and quantity thereof, and a cross-hair to aid in targeting enemies. The action is viewed from an over-the-shoulder perspective similar to Resident Evil 4, although players can switch to a first-person perspective if <b>they</b> <b>wish.</b> Defeating enemies yields EXP, {{and at the end}} of each stage, the player can either use that EXP to level up, increasing Vincent's stats, or convert it to Gil (the in-game currency), which can then be used to purchase items and equipment upgrades.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} said that an error of fact {{involves}} a situation where there are new or different primary facts yet to be put before the court, such as a new witness, or what people saw or heard, whereas an error of law involves a misinterpretation of a statutory word or phrase with regard to such facts. However, this distinction is debatable, and the view has been taken that courts sometimes simply regard a matter as one involving an error of law if <b>they</b> <b>wish</b> to adopt an interventionist approach, and seek to allow judicial review to take place.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} to take individual higher education courses in Commerce from the Business School in Kambsdalur and in Tórshavn. The alumni can work {{at the same time}} and take one course each semester. After three years they will have achieved 60 ECTS which is the same as the first part of the HD education. They can also take the second part of the HD education from the Business College, and they can also combine it with courses from the Aarhus University via distant education. If <b>they</b> <b>wish</b> to study further for at MBA they must take it from a university in Denmark, i.e. the Aarhus University.|$|E

While traveling, the player can encounter other players over the Internet, one at a time. Players cannot communicate verbally, but may help each other or not as <b>they</b> <b>wish.</b> The game was released for the PlayStation 3 on March 13, 2012. Austin Wintory {{was nominated for a}} Grammy Award in 2013 for Best Score Soundtrack for Journey, the first such nomination for a full video game score, but lost to Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross for The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.|$|E

Robert refuses. Meanwhile, Marian barely avoids being forced to marry DeLacey, and only escapes {{with the help of}} the kind Friar Tuck and the Sheriff's seneschal Guy de Gisbourne, who is infatuated with her. She flees to Huntington Castle; the Earl is displeased with his son's disobedience and their liaison, causing Marian and Robert to travel to the small village of Locksley, his namesake and holding.|$|E

The Constitution also allows for the death penalty to be exercised for grave crimes, but only in accordance with national law. If citizens are arrested, they are granted due process of law and do not have to testify against themselves or their family members. Citizens are also given the right to vote, housing, compensation for their share of work, and have the ability to move wherever <b>they</b> <b>wish</b> inside Belarus, and have the right to protest against the government.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{completion}} of the first seven years of primary education, students can continue their studies in lower secondary education in the 8th and 9th grade and if <b>they</b> <b>wish</b> to, they can also take the 10th year of Fólkaskúli. Two thirds of the pupils from the 9th grade chose to take the 10th grade of Fólkaskúlin also. Lower secondary education lasts {{two to three years}} and, as with primary education, it is provided by Fólkaskúli and is free of charge. The first two years are part of the compulsory education, while the third year is optional, though a prerequisite to continue to the upper high school. In 2014 there were 1,932 students in lower secondary education.|$|E

Bart is {{conflicted}} and asks Homer whether it is okay to compromise one's beliefs to be popular.
