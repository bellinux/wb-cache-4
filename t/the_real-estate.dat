5|$|Though Wiggins did {{not give}} up hope {{for a return to}} baseball, he began to study <b>the</b> <b>real-estate</b> market after his {{suspension}} from the game. In the late 1980s, Wiggins began to suffer from health difficulties related to AIDS, though the diagnosis was not publicly disclosed while he was alive. He was receiving deferred payments from his baseball career, and he began to make plans for the financial future of his children. He told one of his former teammates that he was getting into computer work. Gwynn said that he had seen Wiggins in the spring of 1990 and was struck by his visible weight loss.|$|E

25|$|California's new {{military}} governor Bennett C. Riley ruled that land {{could not be}} sold that was not on a city map. In 1849, Lieutenant Edward Ord surveyed Los Angeles to confirm and extend {{the streets of the}} city. His survey put the city into <b>the</b> <b>real-estate</b> business, creating its first real-estate boom and filling its treasury. Street names were changed from Spanish to English. Further surveys and street plans replaced the original plan for the pueblo with a new civic center south of the Plaza and a new use of space.|$|E
25|$|India liberalised its FDI {{policy in}} 2005, {{allowing}} up to a 100% FDI stake in ventures. Industrial policy reforms have substantially reduced industrial licensing requirements, removed restrictions on expansion and facilitated {{easy access to}} foreign technology and investment. The upward growth curve of <b>the</b> <b>real-estate</b> sector owes some credit to a booming economy and liberalised FDI regime. In March 2005, the government amended the rules to allow 100% FDI in the construction sector, including built-up infrastructure and construction development projects comprising housing, commercial premises, hospitals, educational institutions, recreational facilities, and city- and regional-level infrastructure. Between 2012 and 2014, India extended these reforms to defence, telecom, oil, retail, aviation, and other sectors.|$|E

25|$|Even by 1912, much of Upper Rochelle {{remained}} sparsely populated. The Wykagyl and Quaker Ridge stations fronted {{dirt roads}} {{and were not}} served by public transportation. Ironically, most of <b>the</b> <b>real-estate</b> development that did occur {{at the time was}} attracting wealthier residents who owned their own automobiles, frequently chauffeur-driven, and used them instead of public-transportation for local trips. While the populations of some communities served by the NYWB did grow between 1912 and 1937, the growth was not large enough or fast enough to provide sufficient business for the railroad, and service was discontinued on December 31, 1937. The only signs of the railway that are left {{can be found in a}} few remaining station houses, most notably the Quaker Ridge station, currently a private residence, and the former Wykagyl station, now part of a shopping center.|$|E
25|$|Under sail, an oared warship {{was placed}} at much greater risk {{as a result}} of the piercings for the oars which were {{required}} to be near the waterline and would allow water to ingress into the galley if the vessel heeled too far to one side. These advantages and disadvantages led the galley to be and remain a primarily coastal vessel. The shift to sailing vessels in the Mediterranean was the result of the negation of some of the galley's advantages as well as the adoption of gunpowder weapons on a much larger institutional scale. The sailing vessel was propelled in a different manner than the galley but the tactics were often the same until the 16th century. <b>The</b> <b>real-estate</b> afforded to the sailing vessel to place larger cannons and other armament mattered little because early gunpowder weapons had limited range and were expensive to produce. The eventual creation of cast iron cannons allowed vessels and armies to be outfitted much more cheaply. The cost of gunpowder also fell in this period.|$|E

500|$|Skaaren's {{first draft}} {{retained}} {{some of the}} more sinister characteristics of McDowell's Betelgeuse, but toned down the character to make him a troublesome pervert rather than blatantly murderous. Betelgeuse's true form was that of the Middle Eastern man, and much of his dialogue was written in African American Vernacular English. This version concluded with the Deetzes returning to New York and leaving Lydia in the care of the Maitlands, who, with Lydia's help, transform the exterior of their home into a stereotypical haunted house while returning the interior to its previous state. [...] It also would have featured deleted scenes such as <b>the</b> <b>real-estate</b> agent, Jane, trying to convince the Deetzes to allow her to sell the house for them (having sold it to them in the first place—Charles and Delia decline), and a reveal on how Beetlejuice had died centuries earlier (that he'd attempted to hang himself while drunk, only to mess it up and died slowly choking to death, rather than quickly by snapping his neck) and wound-up working for Juno before striking it out on his own as a [...] "free-lance Bio-Exorcist".|$|E

2500|$|Interest rate {{targets are}} a vital tool of {{monetary}} policy and {{are taken into}} account when dealing with variables like investment, inflation, and unemployment. The central banks of countries generally tend to reduce interest rates when they wish to increase investment and consumption in the country's economy. However, a low interest rate as a macro-economic policy can be risky and may lead to the creation of an economic bubble, in which large amounts of investments are poured into <b>the</b> <b>real-estate</b> market and stock market. [...] In developed economies, interest-rate adjustments are thus made to keep inflation within a target range for the health of economic activities or cap the interest rate concurrently with economic growth to safeguard economic momentum.|$|E
2500|$|The easily {{obtainable}} {{credit that}} had helped create and engorge <b>the</b> <b>real-estate</b> bubble {{continued to be}} a problem for several years to come, and as late as 1997, banks were still making loans that had a low guarantee of being repaid. Loan Officers and Investment staff had a hard time finding anything to invest in that would return a profit. Meanwhile, the extremely low interest rate offered for deposits, such as 0.1%, meant that ordinary Japanese savers were just as inclined to put their money under their beds as they were to put it in savings accounts. Correcting the credit problem became even more difficult as the government began to subsidize failing banks and businesses, creating many so-called [...] "zombie businesses". Eventually a carry trade developed in which money was borrowed from Japan, invested for returns elsewhere and then the Japanese were paid back, with a nice profit for the trader.|$|E
