40|$|Epicyclic {{mechanisms}} {{have found}} wide applications in industry, especially in automobiles and robotics. Low efficiency {{due to the}} high gearing power occurring in an epicyclic train is an important problem. This thesis develops a novel family of epicyclic transmissions, based on cams and rollers. This kind of cam-based mechanical transmissions, Speed-o-Cam (SoC), offers features such as high stiffness, low backlash, and high efficiency. We develop multi-lobbed cam profiles, the sun cam and <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> <b>cam,</b> which comprise an epicyclic cam train (ECT) with the roller follower. New design criteria are established: the generalized transmission index (GTI) and the contact ratio in cam transmissions. The GTI is an index that quantifies the force transmission quality in a mechanism, thereby generalizing the pressure angle, the transmission angle, and the transmission index (TI) proposed by Sutherland and Roth in 1973. The contact ratio is an index of the quantity of overlap occurring between two conjugate cams during transmission. A contact ratio greater than unity guarantees smooth motion during operation. In order to avoid "poor" transmission, we apply an undercutting technique on the cam profile to achieve a smooth motion. We introduce two new concepts, virtual power and virtual power ratio, and derive an original algorithm to compute the efficiency in an epicyclic train upon the assumption that power loss is due only to friction upon meshing. The results show that friction has a larger effect on the total efficiency of an epicyclic train than on a simple train. Examples are given to validate this algorithm, by comparison of our results with previous works. The dual-wheel transmission (DWT), proposed elsewhere using epicyclic gear trains (EGTs), is designed here with epicyclic trains of cams and rollers. We optimize the DWT to achieve a compact design and a high transmission performance. Furthermore, we define the total transmission index (TTI), which allow us to evaluate the final DWT design. Two virtual prototypes of the DWT, the central and the offset versions, are generated: the former is capable of quasi-omnidirectional mobility, the latter of full omnidirectional mobility. Finally, we include a general kinematic analysis of wheeled mobile robots (WMRs) with single-wheel drives and apply this method to WMRs with DWT units; then, we obtain symbolic solutions to the direct kinematics (DK) and inverse kinematics (IK) problems, for both central and offset types of units...|$|E
40|$|Bosch Rexroth in Mellansel {{develops}} and fabricates Hägglunds {{hydraulic motors}} among other things. One {{important component of}} the motor is <b>the</b> <b>cam</b> <b>ring,</b> which commonly affects the life span of the motor. The aim is to create the basis of a testing equipment where a loose <b>cam</b> <b>ring</b> can be tested. Previously, a complete motor has been used in order to test the fatigue resistance of <b>the</b> <b>cam</b> <b>ring.</b> In order to load <b>the</b> <b>cam</b> <b>ring</b> similar to <b>the</b> real case. FEM-analysis was performed to investigate how <b>the</b> <b>cam</b> <b>ring</b> is affected during loading and how the rig should be built for the strains to be similar to the real case. The result of this simulation was compiled in a Haighdiagram in order to get an indication of the magnitude of the stresses. The solution is a testing equipment which consist of a cylinder block which usually is in the motor. The cylinder block is bolted onto a bottom plate where <b>the</b> <b>cam</b> <b>ring</b> has a given position. <b>The</b> <b>cam</b> <b>ring</b> is fixated using a sloted spring pin and a dowel pin that keeps <b>the</b> <b>cam</b> <b>ring</b> in position and prevents potential torque. All pistons should be pressurised by pulsation at the same time using the same pressure, thus, the torque is expected to be zero. One of the holes which is holding <b>the</b> <b>cam</b> <b>ring</b> is oval, this is to allow deformation of <b>the</b> <b>cam</b> <b>ring.</b> <b>The</b> result of this work is a basic plan for the components included which affects the mechanical function of the testing equipment. A limitation of this work has been that the residual stresses in the clearance holes is unknown. These residual stresses have a great importance for fatigue resistance of <b>the</b> <b>cam</b> <b>rings.</b> As a consequence of this, it has been difficult to estimate which working pressure the test rig has to use in order to achieve the desired life span. Experimental testing when using the rig will indicate this.

40|$|Abstract. High {{contact stress}} between the vane tips and <b>the</b> <b>cam</b> <b>ring</b> {{is one of}} the main {{obstacles}} to improve the working pressure of a water hydraulic vane pump. A pressure-reducing valve for regulating the bottom pressure of the vanes at the pump suction zone is presented in this paper. Through optimization and simulation, it is found that the throttle structure has great influence on the dynamic performance of the pressure-reducing valve, and the triangular-rectangular groove is proved to be more suitable for the valve among all the investigated grooves. The theoretical analysis results show that the use of the pressure reducing valve can obviously reduce the contact forces between <b>the</b> <b>cam</b> <b>ring</b> and <b>the</b> vanes at the suction zone of the pump.

50|$|The {{screw and nut}} {{may have}} very fine {{identical}} single- or two-start threads. Recirculating rollers are grooved (instead of threaded) so they move axially during spinning engagement with the threads of the nut and screw, shifting up or down by one lead of thread after completing an orbit around the screw.

After a roller completes an orbit about the nut it is released into the groove, disengages from nut and screw, and is pushed between the cams to the axial midpoint of the nut assembly (shifting by a distance equal to the lead of the screw). Returned to its starting position, and reengaged to nut and screw, the roller may then orbit the screw once again.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project {{was to create a}} better {{understanding}} of <b>the</b> <b>cam</b> <b>ring</b> production and provide information on how to reduce customer order lead time. The method used was discrete event simulation. A model of <b>the</b> <b>cam</b> <b>ring</b> production was created in ExtendSim 8 and experiments were performed. Bosch Rexroth Mellansel manufactures durable hydraulic radial piston motors. The motors come in five models that are called CA, CB, CBM, VI and MA. For each motor there are one to six <b>cam</b> <b>rings</b> depending on <b>the</b> model, and there are a total of 30 types of <b>cam</b> <b>rings.</b> <b>The</b> production system consists of four main processes: Milling, hardening, grinding and quality control. The material flow and production control is quite complex which creates frequently occurring problems. One of the main contributors to the complex system is the hardening work cell called EFD, due to a first piece destructive testing and long setup times, large batch sizes are being used. The scope of the simulation was <b>the</b> production of <b>cam</b> <b>rings,</b> from raw material to completed components ready for assembly. The simulation time was 315 days and each experiments was conducted with 3 - 10 simulation runs. The results from the simulation studies are: •Big batch sizes create long lead times and irregular machine load. •The production can successfully be controlled by using a reorder point. •The planned inventory levels in the MRP (Manufacturing Requirements Planning) system Axapta can be better adapted to fit the demand. •Destructive testing motivates large stocks, large batch sizes and creates test costs of approximately (DELETED) million SEK each year. •An investment of nondestructive testing is estimated to give an approximate payback time of 1, 4 years. When implemented, there is a potential to reduce batch sizes by half from current sizes, which would increase flexibility. It would also reduce tied up capital by (DELETED) million SEK. These recommendations were made to Bosch Rexroth Mellansel: •Invest more resources for evaluating the applicability of nondestructive testing and to implement it if possible. •When nondestructive testing is implemented and set-up time in the EFD machine is reduced, reduce batch sizes step by step to find appropriate levels. •Create a standardized production control which {{has its roots in the}} master production schedule. •Adapt the planned inventory and the batch sizes in Axapta to fit the appropriate levels.

50|$|There {{are several}} {{problems}} with the historical design. The vane tips radially contact <b>the</b> <b>cam</b> <b>ring</b> elliptic surface and cause a significant friction as the rotor and vanes turn. This friction is both pressure dependent and speed squared dependent due to RPM-squared centripetal forces. The speed is limited to about 6-7,000 RPM and the pressure is limited to about 2,500 PSI. Another pressure-related {{problem is that the}} pressure forces into the axial rotor to stationary kidney endplate clearance and buckles the device ends thus increasing fluid blowby referred to as 'volumetric efficiency'. Typically, vane pumps and motors have two external ports but there are actually two separate sets of chambers which form two separate pumps and motors.

40|$|In {{order to}} control the high PV value between the vanes and <b>the</b> <b>cam</b> <b>ring</b> in a water {{hydraulic}} vane pump, a pressure-reducing valve with a constant pressure ratio was developed in this study. The pressure and leakage characteristics of the valve were theoretically analyzed by simulation and the experiments were also conducted based on the valve prototype. The theoretical analysis agrees well with the experimental results. Further, these results reveal that the pressure ratio of the valve decreases to the design value with the increasing working pressure. Additionally, the leakage of the valve rises simultaneously with the increasing working pressure and can be reduced significantly by decreasing the clearance between the valve body and the spool. The presented research not only proves the successful development of the pressure-reducing valve but also lays a foundation for the investigation of a high-pressure water hydraulic vane pump...|$|R
50|$|The {{elliptic}} chamber {{is called}} a 'cam ring' by the industry. As a vane moves into, say, a maximum extension, and then rotates into a minimum extension region of <b>the</b> <b>cam</b> <b>ring,</b> it passes through a gradual transition from maximum to minimum followed by a gradual transitionback to maximum and this happens twice per revolution. In order to prevent oil under pressure from bypassing the vanes, 4 sealing areasare created by means of 4 kidney shaped ports located in the transition areas between minimum and maximum. The spaces between the kidney ports are called the sealing areas and this port system is located at either, or both axial ends of the rotor and vanes. The configuration of the ports and sealing areas are such that the space between any two adjacent vanes is slightly less than the coverage ofthe sealing area. In other words, as the vanes rotate through the sealing area, for {{a small amount of}} rotation, both adjacent vanes arewithin the sealing area. As the rotation continues, the first vane in line leaves the sealing area, but not before the next vane in succession is firmly in the sealing region.|$|R

50|$|The fixed {{relationships}} of <b>the</b> elliptic <b>cam</b> <b>ring</b> {{are replaced by}} 4 curved surface (cupped) movable pistons located at the 4 sealing areas, at 12,3,6, and 9 o'clock like {{the face of a}} clock. The curvature of each piston rides on a 'hydrodynamic oil bearing' similar to hydroplaning tires in the wet and this virtually eliminates metal-to-metal contact and friction. The first Hydristor achieved almost 95% efficiency overall and the present designs are in the 97+% range. If the 4 pistons are positioned equidistant from the center of rotation, no oil is expressed or accepted by any of the kidney ports. This is called 'neutral'. For a clockwise rotation, if 3 and 9 pistons are moved inward with 6 and 12 moving outward, all moving an equal amount, then a device displacement in proportion to the piston movement is created. If the 6 and 12 pistons were moved in with 3 and 9 moving equally out, then all the oil flows reverse. Since the piston positions are infinitely variable, any possible displacement between zero and + or - maximum displacement can be created. If two such Hydristor units are packaged face-to-face with the 4 port kidney plate between them, an infinitely variable transmission is formed. This transmission can select any ratio in the forward direction and in the reverse direction without the need for any gears.|$|R
