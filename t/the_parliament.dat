5|$|The House of Lords {{found that}} <b>the</b> <b>Parliament</b> Act 1911 {{did not have}} any {{limitations}} that would prevent it being used to enact <b>the</b> <b>Parliament</b> Act 1949. The 1949 Act had therefore validly amended the requirements for a bill to use <b>the</b> <b>Parliament</b> Acts procedure and the Hunting Act, which was passed in accordance with these amended requirements, was consequently also held to be valid; the appellants' appeal was dismissed.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Parliament</b> Act 1911 is an Act of <b>the</b> <b>Parliament</b> of the United Kingdom. It is constitutionally {{important}} and partly governs {{the relationship between}} the House of Commons and the House of Lords which make up the two Houses of Parliament. This Act and <b>the</b> <b>Parliament</b> Act 1949 are technically to be construed as complementary in their effects. The two Acts may be cited together as <b>the</b> <b>Parliament</b> Acts 1911 and 1949.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Parliament</b> {{also has}} other powers of general supervision, mainly {{granted by the}} Maastricht Treaty. <b>The</b> <b>Parliament</b> {{has the power to}} set up a Committee of Inquiry, for example over mad cow disease or CIA {{detention}} flights—the former {{led to the creation of}} the European veterinary agency. <b>The</b> <b>Parliament</b> can call other institutions to answer questions and if necessary to take them to court if they break EU law or treaties. Furthermore, it has powers over the appointment of the members of the Court of Auditors and the president and executive board of the European Central Bank. The ECB president is also obliged to present an annual report to <b>the</b> <b>parliament.</b>|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Parliament</b> {{gained more}} powers from {{successive}} treaties, namely through {{the extension of}} the ordinary legislative procedure (then called the codecision procedure), and in 1999, <b>the</b> <b>Parliament</b> forced the resignation of the Santer Commission. <b>The</b> <b>Parliament</b> had refused to approve the Community budget over allegations of fraud and mis-management in the Commission.

5|$|As the plenary {{legislative}} {{powers of}} <b>the</b> <b>Parliament</b> were sufficient to grant extraterritorial legislative powers to <b>the</b> <b>Parliament,</b> the Court declined to pronounce whether Article 73(a) was an empowering provision.

5|$|In 2004, {{following}} the largest trans-national election in history, despite the European Council choosing a President from the largest political group (the EPP), <b>the</b> <b>Parliament</b> again exerted {{pressure on the}} Commission.

5|$|Like {{the other}} institutions, the Parliament's seat {{was not yet}} fixed.

In 1985 <b>the</b> <b>Parliament,</b> wishing {{to be closer to}} these institutions, built a second chamber in Brussels and moved some of its work there despite protests from some states. A final agreement was eventually reached by the European Council in 1992. It stated <b>the</b> <b>Parliament</b> would retain its formal seat in Strasbourg, where twelve sessions a year would be held, but with all other parliamentary activity in Brussels. This two-seat arrangement was contested by <b>the</b> <b>Parliament,</b> but was later enshrined in the Treaty of Amsterdam. To this day the institution's locations are a source of contention.|$|E
