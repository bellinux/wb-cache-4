5|$|Deligiannis mobilized the Hellenic Army, and the British Royal Navy {{blockaded}} Greece. The admiral {{in charge}} of the blockade was Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, who had been <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> the Greeks to be their king in 1863, and the First Lord of the Admiralty at the time was Lord Ripon, whose brother-in-law had been murdered in Greece 16 years before. This was not the last time that King George discovered that his family ties were not always to his advantage. Deligiannis was forced to demobilize and Trikoupis regained the premiership. Between 1882 and 1897, Trikoupis and Deligiannis alternated the premiership as their fortunes rose and fell.|$|E

5|$|While {{producers}} Broccoli and Saltzman originally sought Cary Grant for the role, they discarded {{the idea}} as Grant would {{be committed to}} only one feature film, and the producers decided to go after someone who {{could be part of}} a series. Richard Johnson has claimed to have been <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> the director, but he turned it down because he already had a contract with MGM and was intending to leave. Another actor purported to have been considered for the role was Patrick McGoohan on the strength of his portrayal of spy John Drake in the television series Danger Man: McGoohan turned down the role. Another potential Bond included David Niven, who would later play the character in the 1967 parody Casino Royale.|$|E
5|$|Because the Laborers {{had more}} {{applicants}} than jobs available, {{the process for}} getting a job on the pipeline through Laborers Local 942 was a multi-tiered process. There were multiple levels of eligibility, based {{on the amount of}} seniority a person had. A-level members had the first pick of jobs, but they had to have worked at least 800 hours with the union in the previous year. B-level members had to have worked between 100 and 800 hours with the union. C-level members had to have at least two years of experience outside of Alaska or be an Alaska resident for at least one year. D-level was for everyone else, and D-level people rarely got jobs. That didn't stop people from trying. At 11 a.m. on January 1, 1974, shortly before the pipeline right-of-way was signed, more than 100 people spent the night outside the Fairbanks office of the Laborers Union, waiting for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> jobs when the office opened.|$|E

40|$|During foraging, {{animals can}} {{increase}} their success by both remembering feeding sites and remembering food-related object cues. Because earlier studies have tested either the site or object memory in isolation, {{the aim of}} the present study was to evaluate how efficiently birds can utilize both memories simultaneously. Furthermore, the idea was tested that lateralization might be the principle of brain organization that allows for efficient parallel processing. Pigeons learned to search for food in a complex maze with 16 baited sites. To obtain the maximum reward they had to perform two tasks in parallel, a spatial working memory task and an object-specific working memory task. Birds performed well on this dual task but, compared with spatial working memory alone, they were impaired during <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>choices</b> <b>of</b> a trial (Experiment 1). When the left and the right brain hemispheres were tested separately by means of monocular occlusion (Experiment 2), object discrimination was better when birds used their right eye/left hemisphere. This was most pronounced during <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>choices</b> <b>of</b> a trial. On the spatial component of the task, performance on binocular trials was better than on monocular trials, but monocularly both hemispheres performed at the same level. Results show that on this dual task, discrimination of food-related object cues predominantly involved the left brain hemisphere whereas both hemispheres contributed equally to spatial performance...|$|R

25|$|After {{witnessing}} the Royal Air Force's success using radar directed fighters {{at night in}} 1941, the Navy's Bureau of Aeronautics authorized eight Marine night fighter squadrons to be formed by 1945. This timeline was brought forward considerably after the attack on Pearl Harbor and their need proven by the frustration of the Cactus Air Force's pilots {{not being able to}} engage Japanese bombers at night during the Battle of Guadalcanal. This {{led to the formation of}} the first VMF(N) in November 1942. After much deliberation the Lockheed PV-1 Ventura was picked as <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> aircraft for these squadrons. The night fighting squadrons featured radar equipped aircraft, ground based radar and personnel that provided Ground-controlled interception (GCI).

40|$|Background: The {{management}} of pain, agitation, and delirium (PAD) in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) is beneficial for patients {{and makes it}} widely applied in clinical practice. Previous studies showed that the clinical practice of PAD in ICU was improving; yet relatively little information is available in China. This study aimed to investigate the practice of PAD in ICUs in China. Methods: A multicenter, nationwide survey was conducted using a clinician-directed questionnaire from September 19 to December 18, 2016. The questionnaire focused on the assessment and {{management of}} PAD by the clinicians in ICUs. The practice of PAD was compared among the four regions of China (North, Southeast, Northwest, and Southwest). The data were expressed as percentage and frequency. The Chi-square test, Fisher's exact test, and line-row Chi-square test were used. Results: Of the 1011 valid questionnaire forms, the response rate was 80. 37 %. The clinicians came from 704 hospitals across 158 cities of China. The rate of PAD assessment was 75. 77 %, 90. 21 %, and 66. 77 %, respectively. The rates of PAD scores were 45. 8 %, 68. 94 %, and 34. 03 %, respectively. The visual analog scale, Richmond agitation-sedation scale, and confusion assessment method for the ICU were <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>choices</b> <b>of</b> scales for PAD assessment. Fentanyl, midazolam, and dexmedetomidine were <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>choices</b> <b>of</b> agents for analgesic, sedation, and delirium treatment. While choosing analgesics and sedatives, the clinicians put the pharmacological characteristics of drugs in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> place (66. 07 % and 76. 36 %). Daily interruption for sedation {{was carried out by}} 67. 26 % clinicians. Most of the clinicians (87. 24 %) used analgesics while using sedatives. Of the 738 (73 %) clinicians titrating the sedatives {{on the basis of the}} proposed target sedation level, 268 (26. 61 %) clinicians just depended on their clinical experience. Totally, 519 (51. 34 %) clinicians never used other nondrug strategies for PAD. The working time of clinicians was an important factor in the management of analgesia and sedation rather than their titles and educational background. The ratios of pain score and sedation score in the Southwest China were the highest and the North China were the lowest. The ratios of delirium assessment and score were the same in the four regions <b>of</b> China. Moreover, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>choices</b> <b>of</b> scales for PAD in the four regions were the same. However, the top three <b>choices</b> <b>of</b> agents in PAD treatment in the four regions were not the same. Conclusions: The practice of PAD in China follows the international guidelines; however, the pain assessment should be improved. The PAD practice is a little different across the four regions of China; however, the trend is consistent.
