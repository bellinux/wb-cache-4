5000|$|In the {{critical}} 100 days in spring 1933, Long was generally {{a strong supporter}} of the New Deal, but differed with the president on patronage. Roosevelt wanted control of the patronage and the two men broke in late 1933. [...] Aware that Roosevelt had no intention to radically redistribute the country's wealth, Long became one of the few national politicians to oppose Roosevelt's New Deal policies from the left. He considered them inadequate {{in the face of the}} escalating economic crisis. Long sometimes supported Roosevelt's programs in the Senate, saying that [...] "Whenever <b>this</b> <b>administration</b> <b>has</b> gone to the left I have voted with it, and whenever it has gone to the right I have voted against it." [...] He opposed the National Recovery Act, calling it a sellout to big business. In 1933, he was a leader of a three-week Senate filibuster against the Glass banking bill for favoring the interests of national banks over state banks. He later supported the Glass-Steagall Act after provisions were made to extend government deposit insurance to state banks as well as national banks. Long was known as one of the most colorful Senators of all time, leading Kennedy to write that [...] "... Long strode into the national arena in the role of the hillbilly hero and played it with gusto. He wore white silk suits and pink silk ties, womanized openly, swilled whiskey in the finest bars, swaggered his way around Washington, and breathed defiance into the teeth of his critics. The president's mother called him [...] "that awful man". His friends called him [...] "the Kingfish", after a character on the radio program Amos 'n' Andy ("Der Kingfish", said Long's critics, seeing parallels with another dangerous demagogue.) The New York Times called him [...] "a man with a front of brass and lungs of leather"". Long's flamboyant ways and populist style made him into one of the best known Senators in the nation.|$|E
5000|$|In response, Roman Catholic {{officials}} expressed contrasting views. The chairs of two {{committees of}} the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops {{said in a}} joint statement: In the name of forbidding discrimination, this order implements discrimination. With the stroke of a pen, it lends the economic power {{of the federal government}} to a deeply flawed understanding of human sexuality, to which faithful Catholics and many other people of faith will not assent. As a result, the order will exclude federal contractors precisely {{on the basis of their}} religious beliefs. They objected in particular to the order's inclusion of gender identity, which they said [...] "is predicated on the false idea that 'gender' is nothing more than a social construct or psychological reality that can be chosen at variance from one's biological sex." [...] They said its implementation would: ...jeopardize the privacy and associational rights of both federal contractor employees and federal employees. For example, a biological male employee may be allowed to use the women's restroom or locker room provided by the employer because the male employee identifies as a female. Father Larry Snyder, president of Catholic Charities USA, said that the executive order [...] "upholds already existing religious exemptions that will allow us to maintain fidelity to our deeply held religious beliefs." [...] He issued a statement that said: As has always been the case, Catholic Charities USA supports the rights of all to employment and abides by the hiring requirements of all federal contracts.... Specifically, we are pleased that the religious exemption in this executive order ensures that those positions within Catholic Charities USA that are entrusted with maintaining our Catholic identity are to be held exempt. Michael Galligan-Stierle, president of the Association of Catholic Colleges and Universities (ACCU) issued a statement that said his organization: ...stands with both the president and the U.S. bishops-each of whom has affirmed the principles of human dignity and diversity as key values of our nation and our faith. Where differences arise is in determining how to put those principles into practice, which can be complicated. Given that, ACCU is conferring with other faith-based organizations to determine the extent to which the executive order applies to our member colleges and universities. We remain hopeful that common ground between principle and practice may be found. Douglas Laycock, a professor of law and religious studies at the University of Virginia, noted that the order maintained pre-existing protections for religious organizations: And very important, the executive order creates no right for anyone to sue anyone else. So gay rights groups cannot organize litigation against religious contractors. Only the contracting agencies can enforce this order, and they may quietly enforce it with attention to religious liberty—which is what <b>this</b> <b>administration</b> <b>has</b> mostly done so far. Jenny Yang, vice president of advocacy and policy for World Relief, which works under federal grants rather than contracts, said she was pleased that the order was limited, but worried that it might be extended in the future: Our main concern is its implication on religious freedom down the line, where future executive orders could also include not just federal contractors but grantees as well. It's a slippery slope and we feel the need to speak up whenever we feel like religious freedom is threatened. Commenting on behalf of the Family Research Council (FRC), Peter Sprigg called the order and example of [...] "rule by decree" [...] and said: President Obama has ordered employers to put aside their principles, and practices in the name of political correctness. This level of coercion is nothing less than viewpoint blackmail that bullies into silence every contractor and subcontractor who has moral objections to homosexual behavior. This order gives activists a license to challenge their employers and expose those employers to threats of costly legal proceedings and the potential of jeopardizing future contracts. FRC President Tony Perkins echoed Spriggs' language but emphasized the issue of gender identity. He wrote that the executive order required: that all federal contractors and subcontractors-regardless of their religious and moral convictions-give special treatment to homosexuals, transgenders, and cross-dressers in the workplace.... It accepts the premise that distinctions based on actual conduct-such as homosexual behavior and cross-dressing-should be treated the same way as distinctions based on immutable and innocuous characteristics like race..... The order further burdens contractors by stripping away their right to set dress and grooming standards. Robert Jeffress, pastor of the First Baptist Church of Dallas, told Todd Starnes of Fox News that: The problem with this executive order is that it paves the way for the next one - which could withhold the tax-exempt status or broadcast licenses for religious organizations holding biblical beliefs with which the administration disagrees. Starnes concluded a column that discussed the executive order with [...] "The Obama administration seems hell-bent on forcing Christians to assimilate to the militant LGBT agenda. Resistance is futile." ...|$|E
