5|$|Secondly, quotas {{were raised}} {{to limit the}} ability of workers to overfulfill targets.

5|$|Another kashrut {{challenge}} {{which the}} bakery overcame {{in the early}} 1950s concerned the ability to produce fresh bread for sale on Sunday mornings after the plant had been closed for Shabbat in accordance with Jewish law. Normally dough takes four <b>to</b> <b>six</b> <b>hours</b> to rise, but the bakery acquired a mixer made by Tweedy of Burnley, England, which could produce dough in only two hours, thus allowing the bakery to bake bread on Saturday night in time for Sunday-morning deliveries. Today Angel Bakeries owns nine such mixers, five of which are used in its Jerusalem plant.|$|E

The bypass removed traffic from the heavily congested route through the urbanised areas of Oakengates and Wellington, and removed one of the country's most notorious bottlenecks at the Bucks Head crossroads, in Wellington; delays of up <b>to</b> <b>six</b> <b>hours</b> could be experienced in the summer months.|$|E

50|$|Late during 1935, the {{management}} of the Goodyear plant, which was by far the largest employer of rubber workers in the industry, introduced a plan for the reduction of hourly wages for workers as well as a move from <b>six</b> <b>hour</b> shifts <b>to</b> eight hour shifts. The reason for management's plan was to save money on labor. The move to eight <b>hour</b> shifts from <b>six</b> <b>hour</b> shifts would cause significant layoffs of around 1,200 workers, because with <b>six</b> <b>hour</b> shifts, four shifts of workers would be employed compared to three shifts of workers being employed under eight hour shifts. Eventually, Goodyear's management decided to go back <b>to</b> <b>six</b> <b>hour</b> shifts because of the displeasure voiced by workers.|$|R

5|$|The local {{symptoms}} of victims bitten by the many-banded krait are usually neither serious swelling nor pain; the victims merely feel slightly itchy and numb. Systemic symptoms occur, in general, one <b>to</b> <b>six</b> <b>hours</b> after being bitten by this snake. Symptoms may include bilateral ptosis, diplopia, discomfort in the chest, general ache, weak feeling in limbs, ataxia, glossolysis, loss of voice, dysphagia, tunnel vision, and difficulty breathing. In case of serious bite, suppression of breathing may occur, leading to death. Hyponatremia is also seen, but less commonly.|$|E
5|$|The two snails {{circle around}} each other for up <b>to</b> <b>six</b> <b>hours,</b> {{touching}} with their tentacles, and biting lips and {{the area of the}} genital pore, which shows some preliminary signs of the eversion of the penis. As the snails approach mating, hydraulic pressure builds up in the blood sinus surrounding the organ housing the dart. Each snail manoeuvres to get its genital pore in the best position, close to the other snail's body. Then, when the body of one snail touches the other snail's genital pore, it triggers the firing of the dart.|$|E

5|$|The {{stock is}} {{typically}} made by boiling meat, bones, or both. Beef, pork {{or a combination}} of both are most commonly used, with brisket, ribs, shank and chuck considered to give the most flavorful results, especially if cooked on a high flame. Marrow bones are considered best for the bone stock. Meat stock is usually cooked for about two hours, whereas bone stock takes four <b>to</b> <b>six</b> <b>hours</b> to prepare. Meat and bones are usually removed afterwards and the meat is only added back into the soup about 10–15 minutes before the borscht is done. Some recipes call for smoked meats, resulting in a distinctively smoky borscht, while others use poultry or mutton stock. Fasting varieties are typically made with fish stock to avoid the use of meat, while purely vegetarian recipes often substitute forest mushroom broth for the stock.|$|E
5|$|The women {{performed}} up <b>to</b> <b>six</b> <b>hours</b> a day, either singing {{their own}} florid repertoire from memory, sight-reading from partbooks, or {{participating in the}} balletti as singers and dancers. Thomasin LaMay posits that {{the women of the}} concerti delle donne provided sexual favors for members of the court, but there is no evidence for this, and the circumstances of their marriages and dowries argues against this interpretation. The women were paid salaries and received other benefits, such as dowries and apartments in the ducal palace. Peverara received 300 scudi a year and lodging in the ducal palace for herself, her husband, and her mother - as well as a dowry of 10,000 scudi upon her marriage.|$|E
5|$|The Lincolns {{generally}} conducted {{area bombing}} missions, {{as well as}} strikes against pinpoint targets. They operated singly and in formations, sometimes in concert with RAF bombers. Not having to contend with anti-aircraft fire, the Lincolns flew mainly by day. After completing a bomb run, they would make another pass over the target to strafe with machine guns and 20mm cannon. The Lincolns were considered well suited to the campaign, owing to their range and ability to fly at low speeds to search for targets, {{as well as their}} firepower and heavy bomb load. No.1 Squadron also flew night missions—the only Commonwealth air force unit authorised to do so—of up <b>to</b> <b>six</b> <b>hours</b> duration, dropping one bomb every half hour or so. To reduce the risk of collateral damage, all air strikes had to be approved by the Joint Operation Centre, located at Kuala Lumpur in central Malaya and staffed by military, police and civilian personnel. Although the original purpose of the bombing campaign was to kill as many insurgents as possible, the impracticality of achieving this in operations over dense jungle resulted in a shift towards harassing and demoralising the communists, driving them out of their bases and into areas held by Commonwealth ground troops.|$|E

5|$|Some {{users of}} the drug {{consider}} it an entheogen and a tool to supplement practices for transcendence, including meditation and psychonautics. The intensity and duration {{of the effects of}} psilocybin are variable, depending on species or cultivar of mushrooms, dosage, individual physiology, and set and setting, as was shown in experiments led by Timothy Leary at Harvard University in the early 1960s. Once ingested, psilocybin is rapidly metabolized to psilocin, which then acts on serotonin receptors in the brain. The mind-altering effects of psilocybin typically last from two <b>to</b> <b>six</b> <b>hours,</b> although to individuals under the influence of psilocybin, the effects may seem to last much longer, since the drug can distort the perception of time. Psilocybin has a low toxicity and a relatively low harm potential, and reports of lethal doses of the drug are rare. Several modern bioanalytical methods have been adapted to rapidly and accurately screen the levels of psilocybin in mushroom samples and body fluids. Since the 1990s, there has been a renewal of scientific research into the potential medical and psychological therapeutic benefits of psilocybin for treating conditions including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder, social anxiety, treatment-resistant depression, cluster headaches, and anxiety related to terminal cancer. Possession of psilocybin-containing mushrooms has been outlawed in most countries, and it has been classified as a scheduled drug by many national drug laws.|$|E
