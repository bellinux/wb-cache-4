5000|$|If a Deputy Speaker presides in {{the absence}} of the Lord Speaker, then that {{individual}} uses the Woolsack.

5000|$|When the <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Lords {{resolves}} {{itself into}} committee (see below), the Chairman of Committees or a Deputy Chairman of Committees presides, {{not from the}} Woolsack, but from {{a chair at the}} <b>Table</b> <b>of</b> the <b>House.</b> The presiding officer has little power compared to the Speaker <b>of</b> the <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Commons. He or she only acts as the mouthpiece <b>of</b> the <b>House,</b> performing duties such as announcing the results of votes. This is because, unlike in the <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Commons where all statements are directed to [...] "Mr/Madam Speaker", in the <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Lords they are directed to [...] "My Lords"; i.e., the entire body <b>of</b> the <b>House.</b>|$|R

50|$|He {{sits at the}} <b>Table</b> <b>of</b> the <b>House,</b> in the {{right-hand}} chair (the left-hand chair, looking towards the Speaker’s Chair) for part of every sitting. The historic role of the Clerks at the Table is to record the decisions <b>of</b> the <b>House</b> (not what is said, which is recorded by Hansard), and this they (but not the Clerk) still do. The Clerks at the Table used to wear Court dress with wing collar and white tie, a “bob” (barrister’s) wig and a silk gown, however, as of February 2017 the Clerks will only have to wear gowns. For the State Opening of Parliament and other State occasions, the Clerk <b>of</b> the <b>House</b> wears full Court dress with breeches, and a lace jabot and cuffs.|$|R
50|$|The Clerk <b>of</b> the <b>House</b> is {{both the}} House's chief adviser on matters of {{procedure}} and chief executive <b>of</b> the <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Commons. He or she is a permanent official, not a member <b>of</b> the <b>House</b> itself. The Clerk advises the Speaker on the rules and procedure <b>of</b> the <b>House,</b> signs orders and official communications, and signs and endorses bills. He or she chairs the Board of Management, which consists of {{the heads of the}} six departments <b>of</b> the <b>House.</b> The Clerk's deputy is known as the Clerk Assistant. Another officer <b>of</b> the <b>House</b> is the Serjeant-at-Arms, whose duties include the maintenance of law, order, and security on the House's premises. The Serjeant-at-Arms carries the ceremonial mace, a symbol of the authority of the Crown and <b>of</b> the <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Commons, into the House each day in front of the Speaker, and the Mace is laid upon the <b>Table</b> <b>of</b> the <b>House</b> during sittings.

50|$|The Clerk of the Parliaments, {{or another}} clerk, {{sits in the}} Chamber at the <b>Table</b> <b>of</b> the <b>House</b> during sittings, and calls on items of business.

When at the Table the Clerk wears court dress (including a tail coat and waistcoat), a gown and a wig. The wig worn by the Clerk of the Parliaments is a bench wig as worn by a High Court judge; other clerks wear a barrister's wig. Male clerks wear a wing collar and white bow tie, and female clerks bands as worn by barristers.|$|R

60|$|Jerome Casalini, {{who was a}} very {{considerable}} clergyman, both {{in regard}} of his noble blood, and of his virtue, {{went in search of}} this Spanish priest, upon the account which was given of him by his niece; and, having found him at the hospital, he importuned him so much to take a lodging in his house, that Xavier could not in civility refuse him. But the holy man would never accept <b>of</b> his <b>table,</b> <b>of</b> whose <b>house</b> he had accepted.

25|$|Knowles battled {{multiple}} sclerosis from 1946, {{but it was}} his 1981 stroke that ultimately removed him from public life. He retired from politics in 1984, but was given the unprecedented distinction of being made an honorary <b>table</b> officer <b>of</b> the <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Commons by Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau. This allowed him to spend his retirement viewing parliamentary debates from the floor <b>of</b> the <b>House,</b> and he was often seen to do so until further strokes left him bedridden.|$|R
50|$|The present {{ceremony}} {{involves the}} same procession {{as the former}} one, but, instead of proceeding to the Woolsack, it stops in front <b>of</b> the <b>Table</b> <b>of</b> the <b>House.</b> The Reading Clerk reads the Letters Patent presented {{to him by the}} Garter Principal King of Arms, and administers the Oath of Allegiance or Solemn Affirmation to the new peer. The new peer and his supporters together bow to the Cloth of Estate, which is placed at the end <b>of</b> the <b>House,</b> behind the Queen's Throne and the Woolsack. The procession then proceeds out of the Chamber, the new peer stopping at the Woolsack to shake hands with the Lord Chancellor. Upon returning to the Chamber, the new peer takes any seat he pleases, sitting with his party, or, if neutral, sitting amongst the Crossbenchers.|$|R
5000|$|On 22 June, {{when the}} {{government}} intended to progress a bill on Irish tithes, Ashley forestalled them, moving the second reading of the factory bill. He complained of the evasive conduct of ministers and government apathy and complacency on factory reform. Peel (who normally, even in opposition, deprecated obstruction of government business by backbenchers) supported Ashley: he held very different views on the issue from Ashley, but the issue was important, contentious, {{and should not be}} evaded : [...] "so long as ineffectual attempts at legislation remained on the <b>table</b> <b>of</b> the <b>house,</b> the excitement <b>of</b> the manufacturing districts would continue to be kept up" [...] Ashley's motion was lost narrowly 111 to 119.|$|R

5000|$|In 1880 Bradlaugh {{was elected}} Member of Parliament for Northampton. To take {{his seat and}} become an active Parliamentarian, he needed to signify his {{allegiance}} to the Crown and on 3 May Bradlaugh came to the <b>Table</b> <b>of</b> the <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Commons, bearing {{a letter to the}} Speaker [...] "begging respectfully to claim to be allowed to affirm" [...] instead of taking the religious Oath of Allegiance, citing the Evidence Amendment Acts of 1869 and 1870. Speaker Brand declared that he had [...] "grave doubts" [...] and asked the House for its judgment. Lord Frederick Cavendish, for the Government, moved that a Select Committee be set up to decide whether persons entitled to make a solemn affirmation in court were also allowed to affirm instead of taking the Parliamentary oath.|$|R
5000|$|... ===As the <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Commons Chamber=== The former Chapel's {{layout and}} {{functionality}} influenced the positioning of furniture and the seating of Members of Parliament in the Commons. The Speaker's chair {{was placed on}} the altar steps - arguably the origin of the tradition of Members bowing to the Speaker, as they would formerly have done to the altar. Where the lectern had once been, the <b>Table</b> <b>of</b> the <b>House</b> was installed. The Members sat facing one another in the medieval choir stalls, creating the adversarial seating plan that persists in the chamber of the Commons to this day. The old choir screen, with its two side-by-side entrances, was also retained and formed the basis of the modern voting system for parliamentarians, with [...] "aye" [...] voters passing through the right-hand door and [...] "no" [...] voters passing through the left-hand one.|$|R
25|$|At {{the north}} end of the Chamber is the Speaker's Chair, a present to Parliament from the Commonwealth of Australia. The current British Speaker's Chair is an exact copy of the Speaker's Chair given to Australia, by the <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Commons, to {{celebrate}} the opening <b>of</b> Old Parliament <b>House,</b> Canberra. In front of the Speaker's Chair is the <b>Table</b> <b>of</b> the <b>House,</b> at which the clerks sit, and on which is placed the Commons' ceremonial mace. The Table was a gift from Canada. The dispatch boxes, which front-bench Members of Parliament (MPs) often lean on or rest notes on during Questions and speeches, are a gift from New Zealand. There are green benches on either side of the House; members of the Government party occupy benches on the Speaker's right, while those of the Opposition occupy benches on the Speaker's left. There are no cross-benches as in the <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Lords. The Chamber is relatively small, and can accommodate only 427 of the 650 Members of Parliament—during Prime Minister's Questions and in major debates MPs stand at either end <b>of</b> the <b>House.</b>|$|R
