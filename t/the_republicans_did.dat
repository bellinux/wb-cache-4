5|$|As the {{campaign}} progressed, Weaver's message of racial inclusion drew violent protests in the South, as the Greenbackers faced the same obstacles <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>did</b> {{in the face}} of increasing black disenfranchisement. In the autumn, Weaver campaigned in the North, but the Greenbackers' lack of support was compounded by Weaver's refusal to run a fusion ticket in states where Democratic and Greenbacker strength might have combined to outvote the Republicans.|$|E
5|$|Gingrich {{sought a}} rematch against Flynt in 1976. While <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>did</b> {{slightly}} {{better in the}} 1976 House elections than in 1974 nationally, the Democratic candidate in the 1976 presidential election was former Governor of Georgia Jimmy Carter. Carter won {{more than two-thirds of}} the vote in his native Georgia. Gingrich lost his race by 5,100 votes.|$|E
5|$|In a {{departure}} from the political traditions of the day, Weaver himself campaigned, making speeches across the South in July and August. As the Greenbackers had the only ticket that included a Southerner, Weaver and Chambers hoped to make inroads in the South. As the campaign progressed, however, Weaver's message of racial inclusion drew violent protests in the South, as the Greenbackers faced the same obstacles <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>did</b> in the face of increasing black disenfranchisement. In the autumn, Weaver campaigned in the North, but the Greenbackers' lack of support was compounded by Weaver's refusal to run a fusion ticket in states where Democratic and Greenbacker strength might have combined to outvote the Republicans.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Republican</b> {{candidate}} <b>did</b> {{not see a}} Democratic challenger, as Democratic candidate Bob Evans suspended his campaign.|$|R
50|$|Despite her leaving {{government}} service during this time, Villalpando's political involvement, especially {{in regards to}} bringing more Hispanics into <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Party, <b>did</b> not cease.|$|R
5|$|On December 19, 1904, Barkley {{declared}} his candidacy for county attorney of McCracken County {{well before the}} March 1905 Democratic primary. <b>The</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>did</b> not nominate a candidate, so the Democratic primary was the de facto general election. Barkley faced two opponents in the primary – two-term incumbent Eugene A. Graves and Paducah Police Court Judge David Cross. He organized his own campaign and made speeches across the county, showcasing his eloquence and likeability. Graves received more votes than Barkley in Paducah, but McCracken County's rural farmers gave Barkley the victory, 1,525 votes to 1,096; Cross came in third with 602 votes. This {{was the only time}} Barkley ever challenged an incumbent Democrat.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{the major}} party candidates, Weaver {{planned to take}} the field himself, giving speeches around the country. His running mate, Chambers, was to do the same, until a fall from a train in July {{disabled}} him {{for the duration of}} the campaign. As the Greenbackers had the only ticket that included a Southerner, he hoped to make inroads in that region. Weaver's path to victory, already unlikely, was made more difficult by his refusal to run a fusion ticket in states where Democratic and Greenbacker strength might have combined to outvote the Republicans. His party's message of racial inclusion also presaged difficulty in the South, as the Greenbackers would face the same obstacles <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>did</b> in the face of increasing black disenfranchisement.|$|E
25|$|Disappointed by the {{acceptance}} {{on the part}} of the King, Alfonso XIII, of the coup d'état by General Miguel Primo de Rivera on 13 September 1923, Alcalá-Zamora did not collaborate with the new regime. After the departure of the dictator in 1930, he declared himself a republican in a meeting that took place on 13 April in the Apolo theatre of Valencia. He was one of the instigators of the Pact of San Sebastián. The failure of the military uprising (Revolt of Jaca) in Aragon of that same year sent him to prison, as a member of the revolutionary committee, but he left jail after the municipal elections of 12 April 1931. In these elections, although the monarchist candidates won more overall votes than <b>the</b> <b>republicans</b> <b>did,</b> <b>the</b> <b>republicans</b> <b>did</b> so well in the provincial cities that Alfonso soon abandoned power. Without waiting for a fresh election, Alcalá-Zamora put himself at the head of a revolutionary provisional government, becoming the 122nd Prime Minister, which occupied the ministries in Madrid on 14 April and which proclaimed the Second Spanish Republic.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Wyoming <b>Republican</b> Party <b>did</b> {{not release}} the vote totals.|$|R
50|$|On {{the same}} day, the Democratic Party held their Oregon primary and their Kentucky primary, while <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Party <b>did</b> not hold any other {{primaries}} on that day.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Republican</b> Party <b>did</b> not {{nominate}} a candidate. In {{the general}} election, James faced Green Party nominee James Lane and Conservative nominee Robert Maresca {{as well as}} various minor party candidates.|$|R
25|$|After the Republicans {{took control}} of the House in 1995, Traficant tended to vote more often with the Republicans than with his own party. On the issue of abortion, Traficant voted with the {{position}} of the National Right to Life Committee 95% of the time in the 105th Congress, and 100% of the time in the 106th and 107th Congresses. However, he voted against all four articles of impeachment against Bill Clinton. After he voted for Republican Dennis Hastert for Speaker of the House in 2001, the Democrats stripped him of his seniority and refused to give him any committee assignments. Because <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>did</b> not assign him to any committees either, Traficant became the first member of the House of Representatives in over a century—outside the top leadership—to lack a single committee assignment.|$|E
500|$|While Republicans were discouraged, Democrats were {{energized}} and did {{especially well}} in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, and New York. <b>The</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>did</b> maintain their majorities in Congress {{and in the}} major states, except New York. The Cincinnati Gazette contended that the voters were [...] "depressed by the interminable nature of this war, as so far conducted, and by the rapid exhaustion of the national resources without progress".|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{his belief}} that Ulysses S. Grant was not suited for the presidential office and dissatisfaction with Grant's and the party's refusal to endorse his {{comprehensive}} Reconstruction program of [...] "land, education and the ballot", Phillips supported Grant and the Republican Party in the 1868 election. <b>The</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>did</b> pass the Fifteenth Amendment constitutionalizing black suffrage in 1870, but the goal of land redistribution was never realized.|$|E
50|$|In 2013 the RNC {{began an}} {{outreach}} campaign toward American youth and minority voters, after studies showed these groups generally perceived that <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Party <b>did</b> {{not care about}} their concerns.|$|R
50|$|Obama and his {{interest}} groups spent $312,869. McCain and {{his interest}} groups spent just $2,264. The Democratic ticket visited the state once, while <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> ticket <b>did</b> not visit at all.|$|R
5000|$|So, again, <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Party <b>did</b> not [...] "go wrong." [...] It was rotten {{from the}} start. It {{has never been}} {{anything}} but red. <b>The</b> characterization of <b>Republican</b> states as [...] "red states" [...] is quite appropriate.|$|R
2500|$|After {{the defeat}} of Barceló's troops, the Council tried to start peace {{negotiations}} with Franco, hoping to achieve a guarantee against political reprisals. On 12 March the Council proposed a peace deal, asking for a guarantee against reprisals and a period of 25 days to allow anyone who wanted to leave Spain to do so. On 16 March, Franco answered that he would only accept an unconditional surrender. On 23 March, the Council sent two negotiators to Burgos (Colonel Antonio Garijo and Major Leopoldo Ortega), and the Nationalists told them that on 25 March the Republican Air Force had to be surrendered and by the 27th the Republican troops had to raise the white flag. Nevertheless, on 25 March, <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>did</b> not surrender their Air Force due to bad weather and [...] Franco broke off negotiations with the junta.|$|E
2500|$|During the 1992 U.S. presidential {{election}} campaign, {{the civil rights}} of gays and lesbians, particularly their open service in the military, attracted some press attention, and all candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination supported ending the ban on military service by gays and lesbians, but <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>did</b> not make a political issue of that position. In an August cover letter to all his senior officers, Gen. Carl Mundy, Jr., Commandant of the Marine Corps, praised a position paper authored by a Marine Corps chaplain that said that [...] "In the unique, intensely close environment of the military, homosexual conduct can threaten the lives, including the physical (e.g. AIDS) and psychological well-being of others". Mundy called it [...] "extremely insightful" [...] and said it offered [...] "a sound basis for discussion of the issue". The murder of gay U.S. Navy petty officer Allen R. Schindler, Jr. on October 27, 1992, brought calls from advocates of allowing open service by gays and lesbians for prompt action from the incoming Clinton administration.|$|E
50|$|Democrat Brian Higgins easily {{defeated}} Independence Party candidate Dan Humiston. <b>The</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>did</b> not {{put forth}} a candidate, instead cross-endorsing Humiston.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the Democratic caucus, <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Party <b>does</b> not use voting rounds or have minimum {{requirements}} for {{a percent of}} votes. <b>The</b> <b>Republican</b> version is <b>done</b> with a straw vote of those attending the caucus. This vote is sometimes done by {{a show of hands}} or by dividing themselves into groups according to candidate. However, officially it is done with voters receiving a blank piece of paper with no names on it, and the voter writing a name and placing it in a ballot box.|$|R
50|$|On {{the same}} day, Democratic caucuses {{were held in}} Hawaii and {{in the state of}} Washington. <b>The</b> <b>Republican</b> Party <b>did</b> not hold any {{primaries}} that day; their own Alaska caucuses took place on March 1, 2016.|$|R
50|$|The Anti-Masonic state {{convention}} met in August 1830 at Utica, and nominated Assemblyman Francis Granger for governor, and Samuel Stevens, of New York City, for lieutenant governor. <b>The</b> National <b>Republicans</b> <b>did</b> {{not call}} a convention, {{and supported the}} Anti-Masonic ticket.|$|R
50|$|However, <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>did</b> not field a {{candidate}} against {{her in the}} 1999 election, and she handily defeated her three independent challengers, winning by a 3 to 1 margin.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>did</b> not run any {{candidates}} for Congress in 1892. The new People's Party {{made its first}} appearance in Florida's congressional elections this year. Robert Bullock (D) of the [...] did not run for renomination.|$|E
50|$|Peter Welch, a Democrat {{representing}} Vermont's sole congressional district, became {{both the}} Democratic and Republican nominee for the House {{when he ran}} for re-election in 2008. Because <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>did</b> not field any candidate on the primary ballot, Welch won enough write-in votes to win the Republican nomination.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Republican</b> Party <b>did</b> not mandate a {{proportional}} representation system for delegate selection, but instead allowed each state {{to determine its}} selection process. A total of 1,069 delegates were pledged {{by the results of}} the February 5 votes.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Republican</b> Party <b>did</b> not see {{the race}} as winnable and Mays {{received}} little assistance for his campaign. Hollings did little campaigning for the race and easily won re-election {{in the midst of}} an otherwise strong Republican year.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Republican</b> Party <b>does</b> not mandate a {{proportional}} representation system for delegate selection, but instead allows each state {{to determine its}} selection process. A total of 265 delegates were pledged {{by the results of}} the March 4th primaries.|$|R
50|$|On January 24, the National Guard of Lamballe made {{a raid on}} {{the castle}} of GuyoMarch Alerted by a neighbor, La Guyomar hid the marquis at the Gouhandais, a farm, located some hundred meters from the castle. <b>The</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>did</b> not {{discover}} anything, but this treatment could not improve the health status of la Rouerie.|$|E
50|$|Byrd easily won re{{election}} in 1976 against Democrat Admiral Elmo R. Zumwalt Jr. He thereby {{became the first}} senator to win election and re-election as an independent. <b>The</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>did</b> not run a candidate that year and concentrated on carrying Virginia in the presidential election, which they did by the narrowest of margins, for Gerald R. Ford Jr.|$|E
50|$|Gingrich {{sought a}} rematch against Flynt in 1976. While <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>did</b> {{slightly}} {{better in the}} 1976 House elections than in 1974 nationally, the Democratic candidate in the 1976 presidential election was former Governor of Georgia Jimmy Carter.

6000|$|<b>The</b> old <b>republican</b> <b>did</b> {{not believe}} in saints, or in prayers, or in what he called [...] "priest's religion." [...] Liberty and Garibaldi were his divinities; but he tolerated [...] "superstition" [...] in women, {{preserving}} in these matters a lofty and silent attitude.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Republican</b> National Committee mounted an {{expansive}} whip operation {{to ensure that}} all those electors selected to vote for <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> nominee indeed <b>do</b> so.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Republican</b> Party <b>did</b> not field a {{candidate}}. Independent candidate Matthew Ricchiazzi {{withdrew from}} the race after his petition {{to get on the}} ballot was rejected by the Board of Elections. Thus, Brown was unopposed in the general election ...|$|R
