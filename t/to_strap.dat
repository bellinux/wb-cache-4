5|$|Wristwatches {{were first}} worn by {{military}} men {{towards the end}} of the nineteenth century, when the importance of synchronizing manoeuvres during war without potentially revealing the plan to the enemy through signalling was increasingly recognized. It was clear that using pocket watches while in the heat of battle or while mounted on a horse was impractical, so officers began <b>to</b> <b>strap</b> the watches to their wrist. The Garstin Company of London patented a 'Watch Wristlet' design in 1893, although they were probably producing similar designs from the 1880s. Clearly, a market for men's wristwatches was coming into being at the time. Officers in the British Army began using wristwatches during colonial military campaigns in the 1880s, such as during the Anglo-Burma War of 1885.|$|E

500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Picture to Burn" [...] {{was directed by}} Trey Fanjoy, who directed all three of Swift's prior music videos. Swift decided to collaborate with Fanjoy once again because she felt that since Fanjoy directed her prior videos, {{she knew how to}} deviate from it and what new grounds to cover. As opposed to their previous collaborations, the video was conceptualized to be edgy and comical. Swift herself was styled edgier than usual, sporting clothing, hair, and jewelry she was not accustomed to. She was intended to wear thigh-length boots, but was not able to find a pair to correspond with her height. Instead, her stylist sewed black fabric <b>to</b> <b>strap</b> onto black high heels to give the illusion of thigh-length boots. The video's plot was conjectured to involve rampaging and seeking revenge on her ex-boyfriend. Swift chose football player Justin Sandy to portray her ex-boyfriend in the video, believing he had a classic and suspiciously perfect demeanor; she described him as [...] "real like Ken". Swift desired to portray her backup band's sense of humor, and thus enlisted them for the video. Swift's real-life best friend Abigail Anderson also made a cameo appearance in the video.|$|E
500|$|After {{injuring}} {{his knee}} in a festival match {{at the beginning}} of the tour at East Molesey, Johnston attributed the injury to a lack of attention to detail. His new boots had spikes that were longer than usual, and the physiotherapist had failed <b>to</b> <b>strap</b> his ankle before the match. His knee soon failed. Johnston missed the first six first-class matches, and with it a month of cricket. He returned against the Minor Counties in late May and took 3/20 in an innings win. He staked his claim for selection in the final two tour matches before the Tests; he took 4/65 and 3/49 against Sussex and then led the way in a win over Hampshire, much as he did five years earlier, taking [...] 5/75 and 4/21. He had taken 20 wickets at 13.35 in his four tour matches and was duly selected to play in the First Test at Trent Bridge. He was economical but unpenetrative, conceding 36 runs in 36 overs without taking a wicket in a rain-affected draw. Between Tests, he removed Hutton in both innings of a match against Yorkshire, but it came at a cost; he ended with 4/186. He took match figures of 4/161 in the Second Test but England held on for a draw with three wickets in hand, as a recurrence of the knee injury while fielding intervened again. He then had an operation to remove cartilage in his right knee; this allowed him more leg movement but also destabilised his knee. The same surgeon had operated on Compton's knee. After missing another month of cricket, Johnston returned with a remodelled action, and hauls of 4/51, 6/63 and 6/39 against Surrey, Glamorgan and Essex respectively, saw Johnston return for the Fifth Test at The Oval. Although the pitch was helpful for spin, a total of 74 overs in the match yielded 3/146, as Johnston was unable rekindle the form of 1948 following his knee injury. Compton and Edrich batted cautiously to ensure the victory that saw England reclaim the Ashes 1â0. He managed only seven Test wickets at 49.00, but his first-class form remained strong. After the Tests, Johnston took match figures of 11/73 and 9/124 in consecutive matches against Kent and the South of England; Australia won both by an innings. He ended with 75 wickets at 20.54 for the entire tour. His injuries were considered a major factor in Australia's loss of the series.|$|E
500|$|The Matrix {{commented that}} after they {{presented}} songs to Spears, she tailored them to suit herself, especially the lyrics. Christy said, [...] "... she {{really knows what}} she wants. She knows if she's trying something on that doesn't fit right for her. She's like, 'No, that's not me.' She's not one <b>to</b> <b>strap</b> {{on some sort of}} fake image." [...] Christy also claimed to be impressed with Spears's vocal ability during the recording of [...] "Shadow". Steve Anderson, Lisa Greene and Stephen Lee wrote [...] "Breathe on Me" [...] at Metrophonic Studios in London, England. Before meeting with the other writers, Anderson thought of two concepts for songs specifically for Spears: one he had worked on [...] "for ages", and [...] "Breathe on Me", which he drafted {{on the morning of the}} sessions. Greene and Lee did not like the first concept, and they wrote [...] "Breathe on Me" [...] with Anderson. The song was produced by Mark Taylor, who kept most of the programming done by Anderson. With Taylor, Spears recorded [...] "Breathe on Me" [...] and [...] "And Then We Kiss", which did not make the album. Before the album was released, Spears's manager Larry Rudolph commented that it was important for Spears to continue moving away from a traditional pop sound, citing [...] "I'm a Slave 4 U" [...] and [...] "Boys" [...] from Britney as departures from her previous music. Barry Weiss, then-president of Jive Label Group, added, [...] "She has achieved what she set out to achieve, which was to make a mature album that didn't sound like something she would have done three years while still making a commercial album that has hit singles. [...] It's the kind of record she should be doing right now, and it came down to her to make it." [...] In the Zone was recorded at Battery Studios and The Dojo in New York City, 3:20 Studios, Decoy Studios, Pacifique Studios, Record Plant in Los Angeles, California, Westlake Recording Studios in West Hollywood, California, The Chocolate Factory, in Chicago, Illinois, Triangle Sound Studios in Atlanta, Georgia, Metrophonic Studios and Olympic Studios in London, England, and Murlyn Studios in Stockholm, Sweden. Throughout the beginning of 2003, Spears started testing tracks by playing them in nightclubs such as Show in New York City.|$|E

2500|$|The {{team had}} two effects with {{vehicles}} {{that did not}} perform as originally planned. The first, in [...] "Rush", involved a scene where Pete and Chloe intentionally drive their car off a cliff and Clark speeds in to catch it before it hits the ground. To attain the shot of Clark catching Peteâs car required the crew to suspend the car from a crane with Sam Jones III and Allison Mack inside the car. The scene was filmed in a rock quarry, as {{there are not many}} cliffs in the Vancouver area, with segments of the scene created digitally. The car was then filmed as it was being pulled into the air backwardsâthe footage was then reverse {{to give the impression that}} it was falling. Initially, Mike Walls and his crew tried to pull the car straight up, but it was not working. The movement of the car had to be tweaked to give a sense of reality. In the season finale, Jonathan and Martha crash their truck on their way home after an EMP blast, which Clark caused, sends a shock wave out that downs a telephone pole and their truck hits it. In order to get the Kent truck to roll for the moment where Jonathan and Martha encounter the wave of EMP, two stunt drivers drove the truck toward a collapsed telephone pole, skidding into it. Then, with mannequins in the truck for safety, the effects team wrapped some cables around the truck and launched it off a ratchet to make it roll. Unfortunately, this did not go as smoothly as planned the first time, as the telephone pole did not fall when they set off the explosive charge to break it. Since it would be too hard <b>to</b> <b>strap</b> John Schneider and Annette O'Toole into the truck while it is upside down, and too dangerous to flip the truck with them already in it, Mike Walls and his team built a rotating truck seat, which allowed them <b>to</b> <b>strap</b> Schneider and OâToole in, then rotate the seat so that they are upside down and slide that into the overturned truck.|$|E

[...] Puyi commented that he felt at that moment utterly [...] "terrified" [...] at the death cult fanaticism of Bushido ("the way of the warrior") which reduced the value of human life down to nothing, as to die for the Emperor {{was the only thing that}} mattered; he observed that the Japanese infantrymen all had families and friends who cared for them, and had quite possibly been bullied by their officers into becoming [...] "human bullets".
