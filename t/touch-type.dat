This is possible because Plum incorporates mnemonics to assist the learner.

During World War I he was the chief stenographer for financier Bernard Baruch, head of the War Industries Board. Somewhere Billy Rose and Milo Hastings met and hit it off. On the train between New York and Washington Milo would dictate and Billy would record. In the 1920s Billy began to write songs. Milo thought the songs were good but he needed a stage name and suggested “Billy Rose”. Billy would bring his girlfriends over to Milo’s apartment in New York and ask Milo what he thought. When Billy married Fanny Brice in 1929 Milo and his wife Sybil were wedding guests.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- A {{hundred years}} ago, people faced problem {{in using the}} new {{typewriters}} [...] . Typing was error prone [...] . Correcting a character, even a word, {{might not be so}} bad. Correcting a missed sentence, early on the typed page, was better fixed by starting the page over. With this background for almost a human generation of using typewriters, the new idea of <b>touch-typing,</b> typing without looking at the keys, was a very strange one. “That’s silly. Who could possibly do that? ” [...] . Of course, we know how <b>touch-typing</b> turned out as an internationally useful method [...] . But we also know that very few key-looking typists learned how to touch type. It was the young generation coming into the field. There is a lesson in touch typing for software development. In software, teaching a programming language and how to compile and execute programs allows people to write programs immediately. Very likely, such programs will require considerable debugging [...] . errors and unit debugging are just an expected and integral part of programming. However, people with the right education and training need not unit debug their software any more than people {{need to look at the}} keys when they type [...] .

40|$|Nowadays, {{university}} {{students do not}} necessarily acquire their typing skills through systematic <b>touch-typing</b> training, like professional typists. But then, how are the resulting typing skills structured? To reveal the composition of today’s typical typing skills, 32 {{university students}} performed on three writing tasks: copying from memory, copying from text, and generating from memory. Variables of keyboard operation that presumably reflect typing abilities and strategies, were recorded with ScriptLog, a keystroke logging software; these include typing speed, keyboard efficiency, and keyboard activity beyond keypresses that become visible in the final text. Factor analyses reveal three components of typing behavior per task. Their clearest interpretations relate to keyboard activity/efficiency and typing speed. Across tasks, typing speed is the strongest individually stable facet of keyboard operation. In summary, university students’ keyboard behavior is a multi-faceted skill rather than the mere mastery of a <b>touch-typing</b> method...|$|R

The aim was to chart the distribution of visual attention between source and target texts, and to study how visual attention was affected by text complexity and time pressure. Participants with <b>touch-typing</b> skills were found to attend more to on-screen text than those without. Further it was shown that time pressure affected fixation duration on the source text, while text complexity affected the number of fixations on the source text. Also, touch typists made more direct, on-screen transitions from the source text to the target text and back than non-touch typists. Overall, average fixation duration was consistently longer in the target text area than in the source text area. 1...|$|R

In order to evaluate the balance stability and treatment effect of vibrating insoles in these shoes, multivariate multiscale entropy (MMSE) algorithm is applied to calculate the relative complexity index of reconstructed center of pressure (COP) signals in antero-posterior and medio-lateral directions by the multivariate empirical mode decomposition (MEMD). The {{results show that the}} balance stability of 61. 5 % elderly subjects is improved after wearing the developed shoes, which is more than 30. 8 % using multiscale entropy.

40|$|Abstract — The term “Touch ” {{generally}} {{refers to}} touch or contact to {{the display of}} the device by a finger or hand. However, if the object sensed is active, as with a light pen, the term touch screen is generally not applicable. Touch screen penetration has been rapidly increasing in mobile phone, portable navigation, and other applications. Touch screens are electronic visual devices that are sensitive to pressure thus detect the presence and location of a touch within the display area. The screens are sensitive to pressure; a user interacts with the computer by touching pictures or words on the screen. Current haptic solutions {{for the lack of}} tactile response in touch screens offer feedback in the form of vibrations, but only after the screen has been touched. Since sight is still the primary sense needed for these solutions, it is useless for customers wanting to <b>touch-type</b> or navigate their screens. Tactus provides a new dimension of user interface with a fundamentally unique solution: application-controlled, completely transparent physical buttons that rise up from the touch-screen surface on demand. So Tactile Layer technology temporarily replicates the raised buttons of keyboards and other tactile tools in touchscreen devices. Tactile Layer works by raising hard bumps similar to actual buttons on the surface of a touch screen, depending on the application. With the buttons enabled, users can push and type or rest their fingers as they would with any physical button or keyboard. When the buttons are disabled, they recede into the screen, becoming invisible and leaving a smooth, seamless flat touchscreen with maximum viewing area...|$|E
