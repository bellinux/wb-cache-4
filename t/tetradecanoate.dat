This secretion is a complex mixture of sixty compounds of which 53% is ethyl (z)-tetradec-9-enoate, ethyl esters of fatty acids. Other components include ethyl dodecanoate (6%), ethyl <b>tetradecanoate</b> (2%), ethyl (Z)-hexadec-9-enoate (4%), ethyl (Z)-octadec-9-enoate (2%), hexadecan-1-ol (4%), (Z,Z,Z)-octadeca-9,12,15-trien-1-ol (1%), and (Z)-hexadec-7-enal (2%). The biosynthetic pathway of the pheromones is not well known, but {{it was suggested that}} they are produced from common lipids in the body. Young and old males of B. lucorum have similar quantities of labial gland secretions because the secretory activity continues throughout their lifetime with no dependence on age.|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} simple, solution-based {{technique}} for coating arbitrary surfaces with thin layers of self-assembled copper <b>tetradecanoate</b> (CTD) nanostrips, {{resulting in an}} optically transparent, superhydrophobic coating. The nanostrip-coated surfaces show water contact angles close to 150 ° and roll-off angles as small as 2 °- 3 °. Importantly, CTD retains its hydrophobic nature even after annealing the self-assembled nanostrips at 200 °C, which does not alter the crystal structure but “melts” the surface microstructure. This clearly indicates that the hydrophobicity in CTD {{is likely to be}} intrinsic in nature and not induced by the surface microstructure (as has been suggested earlier). Strong hydrophobicity in CTD over a relatively wide temperature range presumably results from the presence of the long aliphatic (<b>tetradecanoate)</b> chains in its structure. Importantly, the self-assembled copper <b>tetradecanoate</b> nanostrips can be dip-coated on glass to render it hydrophobic {{and at the same time}} retain a significant level of transparency over the entire visible region. Such nanostructured thin films may be expected to find applications not only as a self-cleaning glass, but also as a corrosion resistant coating, in gas storage (due to the layered structure), and as an active catalyst because of the visible absorbance...|$|E

Remarkable differences were noted between the composition and the constituent percentage of the different studied organs. The most important compounds found in leaves, flowers and fruits of Opuntia lindheimeri var. linguiformis were tetradecanoic acid (3. 15 - 13. 57 %), hexadecanoic acid (8. 5 - 17. 33 %), butyl <b>tetradecanoate</b> (8. 05 - 21. 47 %) and (E) - 3 -Butyldiene phthalide (6. 92 - 15. 77 %).

Branched-chain pentadecanoates (br-C 15) were the principal fatty acids of log-phase cells. Synthesis of branched-chain <b>tetradecanoates</b> (br-C 14) during sporulation increased the relative proportion of these branched fatty acids in sporulating cells and in mature spores. The log-phase distribution was reestablished during {{outgrowth of the}} spore. The ratio of br-C 15 to br-C 14 could be radically altered by addition of their respective amino acid precursors, isoleucine and valine, without seriously affecting the sporulation process. The fatty acid composition {{of each of the}} purified phospholipids from log-phase cells was the same, indicating that each phospholipid receives a portion of the fatty acid pool present in the cell {{at the time of its}} synthesis. Similarly, the fatty acids of each of the spore phospholipids resembled those of the spore extract.

In {{traditional}} Mexican medicine, it is used topically to treat skin infections, pustules and eruptions and to heal wounds by scar formation. However, studies of its potential anti-inflammatory effects have not been performed. The aim {{of the present study}} was to determine the anti-inflammatory effect of extracts from the leaves of Senna villosa and to perform a bioassay-guided chemical study of the extract with major activity in a model of ear edema induced by 12 -O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13 -acetate (TPA). The results reveal that the chloroform extract from Senna villosa leaves has anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative properties. Nine fractions were obtained from the bioassay-guided chemical study, including a white precipitate from fractions 2 and 3. Although none of the nine fractions presented anti-inflammatory activity, the white precipitate exhibited pharmacological activity.

Tryptic phosphopeptide mapping analysis suggested that treatments with EGF and TPA induced phosphorylation of many common sites in the c-erbB- 2 gene product. However, in contrast to TPA, EGF increased the phosphorylation of the c-erbB- 2 protein in cells whose protein kinase C had been down-regulated by long-term pretreatment with TPA, suggesting that EGF and TPA induce phosphorylation by different mechanisms.

Skin emanations collected from armpits were less attractive to An. coluzzii compared to hands or/and feet. The difference may have been caused by deodorant residues, which were found in the armpit samples and not in those of hands and feet.

We identified the chemical compounds involved in the aggregation behavior of L. africanus using preparations of crude hexanic extracts from male and female beetles (ME and FE, respectively). Both male and female beetles showed significant preferences for ME, which was found to contain three esters. FE was ignored by both the sexes. Further bioassay confirmed the role of esters in the aggregation behavior of L. africanus. Three esters were identified as 2 -propyl dodecanoate, 3 -pentyl dodecanoate, and 3 -pentyl <b>tetradecanoate.</b> Further behavioral bioassays revealed 3 -pentyl dodecanoate to play the main role in the aggregation behavior of female L. africanus beetles. However, significantly more beetles aggregated on a paper disk treated with a blend of the three esters than on a paper disk treated with a single ester. This is the first report on pheromone identification in L. africanus; in addition, the study for the first time presents 3 -pentyl dodecanoate as an insect pheromone...|$|E
40|$|Gas {{chromatography}} with simultaneous {{flame ionisation}} and electroantennographic detection (GCEAD) and gas chromatography with mass spectrometry analysis (GCMS) of abdominal extracts of adult male Dermestes haemorrhoidalis Kuster (Coleoptera: Dermestidae) revealed {{the presence of}} electrophysiologically and behaviourally active compounds to its conspecific males and females. Isopropyl dodecanoate (3), isopropyl (Z) - 9 -tetradecenoate (5), isopropyl <b>tetradecanoate</b> (6), isopropyl (Z) - 9 -hexadecenoate (7) and isopropyl hexadecanoate (8) were detected in male abdominal extracts only. Analysis of collected male headspace volatiles revealed the presence of six EAD-active compounds (3), (5), (6) and isopropyl tridecanoate (4) plus two unidentified compounds (1) and (9). Synthetic compounds (3), (4), (5), (6) and (7) showed EAD activity with antennae of both sexes in contrast to synthetic (8) which showed EAD activity with female antennae only. Male and female antennae of D. haemorrhoidalis reacted with high receptor potentials to isopropyl (Z) - 9 -dodecenoate (2), although this compound itself was detected in neither male nor female abdominal extracts or headspace volatiles. Petri dish bioassays indicated that male abdominal extracts and compounds (2), (3), (5) and (6) aroused and attracted conspecific male and female beetles significantly (...|$|E
40|$|Two {{analytical}} methods based on gas chromatography with direct injection are described for the quantitative analysis of volatile compounds (acetals, aldehydes, esters, alcohols, and volatile phenols) in cider brandies. Analytes {{were divided into}} major, 15, and minor volatile, 24, compounds depending on their usual concentration in samples. Parameters usually tested for method validation are evaluated. Correlation coefficients are calculated to estimate linearity, obtaining values higher than 0. 999. Detection limits range between 0. 325 mg/L (1 -propanol) and 1. 663 mg/L (methanol) among the major volatile compounds and between 0. 086 mg/L (ethyl 2 -methylbutyrate) and 0. 332 mg/L (ethyl <b>tetradecanoate)</b> among the minor volatiles. Mean recoveries ranged between 109 % (ethyl lactate) and 95 % (1 -butanol) for major volatiles and between 109 % (1 -octen- 3 -ol) and 94 % (ethyl 2 -methylbutyrate) for minor volatiles, thus confirming the accuracy of both methods. Reproducibility for major volatiles is < 5. 4 % (furfural) in all cases and < 9. 6 % (hexyl acetate) for minor volatiles. Moreover, {{the accuracy of the}} methods is evaluated by analyzing a certified whisky and five samples from interlaboratory assays, generally obtaining results in accordance with previous values...|$|E
40|$|Males of Bombus terrestris (L.) adopt a patrolling {{behaviour}} {{during their}} nuptial parade using cephalic labial gland (CLG) secretions containing sexual pheromones to attract conspecific virgin queens. The changes in chemical composition of their CLG secretions with age are quite well known. In this study, we investigate {{the evolution of}} CLG secretions with age in greater detail and compare behavioural reactions of conspecific virgin queens to the secretions. We show that compounds of CLG secretions follow two profiles. Most of the compounds increase {{from the first day}} after emergence until the bees are 15 -days-old and then decrease. Others are less abundant in 1 to 15 -day-old males and then increase (e. g. tricosane, tricosene, henicosane, tetradecanoic acid, pentacosene, pentacosane, heptacosene, heptacosane, nonacosene and geranylcitronellyl <b>tetradecanoate).</b> Differences in secretion composition lead to preferences of virgin queens for males according to the male’s age. Virgin queens prefer the pheromonal gland secretions of bees of the following ages in decreasing order; 1 day = 3 days days = 30 days 5 days 0 days. The virgin queens are strongly attracted by secretions containing high amounts of 2, 3 -dihydrofarnesol, 2, 3 -dihydrofarnesal, ethyl dodecanoate and hexadecanol. On the contrary, geranylcitronellol is more abundant in 30 -day-old males. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Clinical {{isolates}} of Stenotrophomonas (Xanthomonas) maltophilia showed growth temperature-dependent {{variation in}} susceptibility (TDVS) to aminoglycoside antibiotics between 30 °C and 37 °C, but {{little or no}} TDVS effect for polymixin B, colistin, ceftazidime, chloramphenicol and piperacillin. When phenylethanol was added at sub-inhibitory concentrations, the TDVS effect was eliminated. Gas liquid chromatography showed that 13 -methyl <b>tetradecanoate</b> (i- 15; 0), was the predominant fatty acid, and was present in lower proportions in cells grown at 30 °C than 37 °C, by contrast to the unsaturated acids, which were found in increased proportions in cells grown at 30 °C. However, {{the extent of the}}se shifts in composition did not correlate with the extent of the TDVS effect in individual strains. Membrane analysis by spin label-electron spin resonance spectroscopy showed that strains exhibiting TDVS had significantly decreased membrane fluidity compared with susceptible strains at 30 °C. Furthermore, analysis of the outer and cytoplasmic membranes from the strains with TDVS revealed that in organisms grown at 30 °C, the outer membrane remained in a more rigid conformation than the cytoplasmic membrane. We conclude that resistance of S. maltophilia to aminoglycoside antibiotics at 30 °C correlates with changes in the conformation of the outer membrane so that binding and/or uptake of the antibiotic is inhibited...|$|E
