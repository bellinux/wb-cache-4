Here, then, at Ramah, Mr. Dove built him a {{house on}} that knoll where first he had pitched his camp. It was a very good house after its fashion, for, as has been said, he did not lack for means, and was, moreover, clever in such matters. He hired a mason who had drifted to Natal <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>stone,</b> of which a plenty lay at hand, and two {{half-breed}} carpenters to execute the wood-work, whilst the Kaffirs thatched the whole as only they can do. Then he set to work upon a church, which was placed on the crest of the opposite knoll where the white man, Ishmael, had appeared on the evening of their arrival. Like the house, it was excellent of its sort, and when at length it was finished {{after more than a year}} of labour, Mr. Dove felt a proud man.|$|E

5000|$|The Fertile Crescent {{architectural}} sculptural tradition {{began when}} Ashurnasirpal II moved his capitol {{to the city}} of Nimrud around 879 BCE. This site was located near a major deposit of gypsum (alabaster). This fairly easy <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>stone</b> could be quarried in large blocks that allowed it to be easily carved for the palaces that were built there. The early style developed out of an already flourishing mural tradition by creating drawings that were then carved in low relief. [...] Another contributing factor in the development of architectural sculpture were the small carved seals that had been made in the area for centuries.|$|E
50|$|A {{concrete}} saw (also {{known as a}} consaw, road saw, cut-off saw or quick cut) is a power tool used for cutting concrete, masonry, brick, asphalt, tile, and other solid materials. It can be a small hand-held cut-off saw, a big walk-behind saw or other styles, {{and it may be}} powered by gasoline, hydraulic or pneumatic pressure, or electric motors. The saw blades used on {{concrete saw}}s are often diamond saw blades to cut concrete, asphalt, stone, etc. Abrasive cut-off wheels can also be used on cut-off saws <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>stone</b> and steel. The significant friction generated in cutting hard substances like concrete usually requires the blades to be cooled to prolong their life and reduce dust.|$|E
50|$|There is good {{information}} concerning {{the location of the}} quarries, some of the tools used <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>stone</b> in the quarries, transportation of the stone to the monument, leveling the foundation, and leveling the subsequent tiers of the developing superstructure. Workmen probably used copper chisels, drills, and saws to cut softer stone, such as most of the limestone. The harder stones, such as granite, granodiorite, syenite, and basalt, cannot be cut with copper tools alone; instead they were worked with time-consuming methods like pounding with dolerite, drilling, and sawing with the aid of an abrasive, such as quartz sand. Blocks were transported by sledge likely lubricated by water. Leveling the foundation may have been accomplished by use of water-filled trenches as suggested by Mark Lehner and I.E.S. Edwards or {{through the use of a}} crude square level and experienced surveyors.|$|E

50|$|The excerpt sheds {{new light}} on the {{development}} of Roman technology in using water power for different applications. It is one of the rare references in Roman literature of water mills used <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>stone,</b> but is a logical consequence of the application of water power to mechanical sawing of stone (and presumably wood also). Earlier references to the widespread use of mills occur in Vitruvius in his De Architectura of circa 25 BC, and the Naturalis Historia of Pliny the Elder published in 77 AD. Such applications of mills were to multiply again {{after the fall of the}} Empire through the Middle Ages into the modern era. The mills at Barbegal in southern France are famous for their application of water power to grinding grain to make flour and were built in the 1st century AD. They consisted of 16 mills in a parallel sequence on a hill near Arles.|$|E
5000|$|Those {{traveling}} by the Panamerican highway between Talara and Sullana may clearly observe a hill that {{appears as if}} the top had been cut off. It is said that due to the flooding of the Chira river, the Zapotoleños had to leave in search of safer regions, locating themselves in the elevated region known as [...] "Cerro Mocho." [...] Other went to Ventarrones, Monte Lima, or Alto Grande. The Zapotoleños, needing materials to construct their huts, began <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>stone</b> blocks from the hill (cerro) until they left it cut (mocho). The older residents will say {{the owners of the}} hacienda on which the hill was located ordered their peons to level the peak to construct the houses of their haciendas on the hill, but later abandoned the task because it was too difficult. In the end the landowners constructed their houses on {{the lower part of the}} hill and still be seen, even in ruins.|$|E
50|$|Yapese quarried the {{limestone}} rocks from {{the islands of}} Palau and took them to Yap with canoes and rafts. There is evidence that some limestone has been mined in Palau by Yapese as early as 500 AD, but more widespread mining started in the time period of 1000-1400 AD. Local legend holds that the Yapese discovered the rock of Palau about 500-600 years ago when an expedition led by a man called Anagumang landed on Palau. Limestone was nonexistent in Yap and therefore very valuable to the Yapese. First Anagumang ordered his men <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>stone</b> {{into the shape of}} fish but eventually a circular shape was chosen, probably because it was easier to transport. A pole was put {{through the hole in the}} center of the stone so that laborers could carry the stone. The largest of the disks probably needed hundreds of men to transport. Residents of Palau in turn required Yapese to pay in beads, coconut meat and copra or in the form of services for the privilege of quarrying.|$|E

50|$|Sandstone {{quarrying}} {{began on}} Newcastle Island in 1869 when Joseph Emery from the United States Mint in San Francisco {{went looking for}} good quality sandstone for their new building. Finding the stone on Newcastle to be exactly {{what he had been}} looking for, he signed a five-year lease with the Vancouver Coal Mining and Land Company <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>stone</b> for the building. Many Americans were angry that their mint would not be built of American stone and this resulted in the Newcastle Island stone being subjected to a battery of tests, all of which it passed with flying colours. It was an appealing white-grey colour; it was easy to remove large blocks because its joints and fractures were few and far between; and it was strong and held up well against weathering because of its unusually high number of quartz grains. The first shipment to San Francisco occurred in the mid-1870s and continued throughout the five years to make the grand total 8000 tons of sandstone removed from Newcastle Island. This stone made up the six blank columns that were 27 ft long and 3 ft in diameter. The San Francisco Mint has survived two major earthquakes. During one earthquake, surrounding fires got hot enough to melt the windows, but the building's interior stayed intact. The San Francisco Mint is no longer in use and is now a national landmark that can still be seen today.Originally, there were to be eight columns for the U.S. Mint, but two of them were on the Zephyr on the night that it was shipwrecked. The Zephyr was a three-masted barque that was built in Medford, Massachusetts in 1855. It arrived at Newcastle Island on January 31, 1872, to take two of the eight sandstone pillars to the U.S. Mint in San Francisco. In stormy weather it left from Departure Bay at 10:00 a.m. on February 12, but on that Monday at 3:30 in the morning, it hit bottom at Mayne Island. Captain Hepson and crewmate James Stewart drowned {{but the rest of the}} crew made it ashore safely. The Zephyr today is commemorated on Newcastle Island with an exhibit about the ship including one of the pillars that had been rescued from the sunken Zephyr.After the success of the Mint, many other companies wanted leases <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>stone.</b> It was used until 1932 for places such as the BC Penitentiary, the Nanaimo Post Office, the Nanaimo Court House, the Bank of Montreal, the British North American Bank of Vancouver, the St. John's Church in Victoria, and the Oddfellows Hall in Victoria.|$|E
5000|$|Formally {{opened on}} May 17, 1921, on land given by Jennings County to the Indiana state government, Vinegar Mills State Park was {{established}} as an 86 acre park. It {{was named for}} an old mill used <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>stone</b> during the pioneer days along the Muscatatuck River. The name was soon changed to Muscatatuck State Park, to reflect the historical Indian name given the River, believed to mean [...] "winding waters". Aside from a small inn built from a brick house known as the William Read Home, which acted as a bed and breakfast, and wood-floored tents, the property was seldom improved upon; it remained a highly forested area popular with travelers between Madison, Indiana and Indianapolis. While a state park, {{it was the first}} to require no financial assistance from the state government, even though it never charged admission and the founder of the Indiana state park system, Richard Lieber, strongly believed in doing so. However, during the Great Depression both the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) and the Works Progress Administration (WPA) made slight improvements to the property, mostly road work and a fire tower.A water-powered mill operated by an overshot wheel built in the 1830s, Vinegar Mill, located within the park but now in ruins, was first called Stone Mill. The mill cut building stones used for sills, caps and steps. Stone cut by the mill may be found as of 1962 in the Jennings County Courthouse in Vernon. An unnamed source attributes the name [...] "Vinegar Mill" [...] to the mill's apparatus supposed resemblance to a cider press.In 1962 the state park had an area of 260.60 acres.|$|E
