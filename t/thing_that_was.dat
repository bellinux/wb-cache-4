Antichrist was {{originally}} scheduled for production in 2005, but its executive producer Peter Aalbæk Jensen accidentally revealed the film's planned revelation: that earth was created by Satan and not by God. Trier was furious and decided to delay the shoot so he could rewrite the script.|$|E

That was the only <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> visible over their grave until 1885 when a monument was placed as they were seen as national heroes because they opposed German ideas, as represented by Biron. This point of view would have been quite amazing to their contemporaries and reflects more {{the concerns of the}} next century than of Biron's and Volynsky's time.|$|E
25|$|As the French made slow, but inexorable progress, De Witt, though very {{reluctant}} to intervene, thought up a solution for his dilemma that would stop the French advance, without necessitating Dutch military intervention, or even (as he hoped) forcing a break with France. He now concluded the Triple Alliance (1668) with England and Sweden. This was an armed coalition of the three countries that forced their mediation on France and Spain. France was to be appeased with all territorial gains it had up to then achieved by military means in the Southern Netherlands (among which the cities of Lille and Cambrai), and Spain was further called upon to cede either Luxembourg, or the Franche-Comté. The only <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> required of Louis was that he halt his advance. This lopsided award was designed to placate Louis, without spoiling the relations with the Republic. The not-so-secret sting in the deal was that the three would intervene militarily if Louis rejected this generous award. Louis therefore complied at the Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle (1668) {{with the demands of}} the allies, but he took the humiliation very hard. After this he started to plot with Charles II of England and the prince-bishop of Munster (who had his own revenge needs after 1666) and the Elector of Cologne, Maximilian Henry of Bavaria, who resented Dutch interference with his attempts to subdue the Free City of Cologne. This resulted in a number of secret arrangements, among which the Secret treaty of Dover, designed to start a war of aggression against the Dutch Republic in 1672, and to divide that country among the participants.|$|E

[...] "Pinkeye" [...] was the first of those new seven episodes to be produced. It was also the first South Park Halloween episode. The script was written by Parker, Stone and writer Philip Stark, and was directed by Parker and Stone, who made the pinkeye a major element of the plot because they associate the illness with the elementary school experience. Parker said, [...] "Pinkeye is just such a huge part of your life when you're in third grade. Pinkeye is the thing every third grader gets and it's just such a bizarre thing." [...] In writing the episode, Parker said he wanted to convey his belief that Halloween is a positive holiday, especially for children: [...] "Halloween's a great <b>thing.</b> <b>That</b> <b>was</b> part of what we wanted (to say).

500|$|Although it {{enjoyed a}} degree of {{commercial}} success, the album received mixed reviews. Melody Maker deemed it [...] "a milestone {{in the history of}} awfulness", and the NMEs Richard Cook wrote: [...] "Like the poor damned Tommies that haunt his mind, Roger Waters' writing has been blown to hell... Waters stopped with The Wall, and The Final Cut isolates and juggles the identical themes of that elephantine concept with no fresh momentum to drive them." [...] Robert Christgau opined: [...] "it's a comfort to encounter antiwar rock that has the weight of years of self-pity behind it", and awarded the album a C+ grade. [...] More impressed, Rolling Stones Kurt Loder viewed it as [...] "essentially a Roger Waters solo album... a superlative achievement on several levels". [...] Dan Hedges of Record also approved, writing: [...] "On paper it sounds hackneyed and contrived – the sort of <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> worked into the ground by everyone from P. F. Sloan to Paul Kantner. In Pink Floyd's case, it still works, partially through the understatement and ingenuity of the music and the special effects... but mostly through the care Waters has taken in plotting out the imagery of his bleak visions." ...|$|E
500|$|Arthur's costume was {{the easiest}} to create, as the color scheme {{mirrored}} his comic book counterpart, and was constructed to give a [...] "wetsuit look". The costume was also designed to be more form-fitting, to complement Ritchson's physique. Victor and Arthur's tops were also hoodie variations. When designing Dinah Lance's Black Canary costume, {{certain aspects of the}} comic book character were kept, while others changed entirely. For instance, the character retains her classic fishnet stockings, but the external, black mask the character wears is swapped for a painted mask. Cranstoun researched the various versions of Black Canary's costume, looking through the 1940s and 50s, to {{try to come up with}} the right version for the show. Cranstoun explained that she primarily came across two versions. One version reminded the designer of a Playboy Bunny, with a [...] "curvy, corseted, strapless <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> not at all action-friendly". The other was more reminiscent of Lara Croft and Tank Girl, which is the route Cranstoun took. What Cranstoun created was a [...] "zipped, sleeveless body suit with a boot that was really flat and practical". The designer also kept the yellow accents the comic version had, as well as the long gloves. The filming crew did test shots with various masks for the character, including a leather mask reminiscent of the comic book character's look, before going with the painted variation.|$|E
500|$|The critic {{writing for}} The Times thought that Bond was [...] "backed up by sound writing" [...] by Fleming. Although the plot was grandiose, the critic noted that: [...] "it sounds – and is – fantastic; {{the skill of}} Mr. Fleming is to be {{measured}} {{by the fact that}} it is made not to seem so." [...] For The Times Literary Supplement, Michael Robson considered that [...] "a new Bond has emerged from these pages: an agent more relaxed, less promiscuous, less stagily muscular than of yore." [...] Bond was not the only <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> more relaxed, according to Robson, as [...] "the story, too, is more relaxed." [...] Robson saw this as a positive development, but it did mean that although [...] "there are incidental displays of the virtuosity to which Mr. Fleming has accustomed us, ...the narrative does not slip into top gear until Goldfinger unfolds his plan". The Evening Standard looked at why Bond was a success and listed [...] "the things that make Bond attractive: the sex, the sadism, the vulgarity of money for its own sake, the cult of power, the lack of standards". The Sunday Times called Goldfinger [...] "Guilt-edged Bond", whilst the Manchester Evening News thought that [...] "Only Fleming could have got away with it...outrageously improbable, wickedly funny, wildly exciting".|$|E

[...] Research highlighted the fact that 12% of abused children go on to become abusers in turn, however Duplock explained: [...] "We felt that to imply on TV that someone who has been abused {{is going to go on}} to abuse other people is not a message you want to give out.

500|$|Initial reviews were mixed, {{with some}} critics applauding the story's conclusion, and others deriding it.

Despite this, he wrote that [...] "it was only right that Samantha be dead since Mulder's life had always been defined by what he has lost, not what he has found". He surmised that the episode was not [...] "perfect", but that its [...] "plusses greatly outweighed any missteps along the way". He was also complimentary towards [...] "the ethereal quality of the final few moments", writing that they [...] "lifted this episode up and made it one of the season's most memorable". Kenneth Silber from Space.com was pleased with the episode, and wrote, [...] "'Closure' is a satisfying episode, one that puts to bed the now-tiresome search for Mulder's sister Samantha." [...] Jeremy Conrad from IGN referred to the episode as [...] "excellent" [...] and noted that a large portion of The X-Files mythology ended with the resolution of Samantha's abduction, saying, [...] " [...] a final, and concrete, answer to the single <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> driving Mulder for the entire run of the series.

500|$|When {{her father}} was jailed for 18 months after being convicted of fraud, she left home with her sister {{to live with her}} mother and partner (Crossroads actor Charles Stapley), in Clapham, London. Her brother went to Brighton to live with his {{paternal}} grandparents. She later wrote that at the age of 15 she ran away to join a funfair, and lived in a cardboard box under Waterloo station for four months, although Stapley denied this by saying that she occasionally left home at weekends to travel with a young man who worked for a funfair in London. During her stated period of homelessness, her school records indicate that she and her sister were both enrolled at Usworth comprehensive in Tyne and Wear until April 1983, and at Hydeburn Comprehensive, in Balham, on 6 June 1983, where they both stayed until 2 July 1984. She remembered that a teacher at the Hydeburn once said, [...] "there's no hope for her at all", and that she left school with no academic qualifications. In the same year, her father had another daughter, Claire Mills, with a new partner. Mills worked for a croissant shop, but was sacked, and vowed [...] "never to work for anyone else again". She later wrote in her autobiography that the owner of a jewellery shop in Clapham gave her a job on Saturdays, but Jim Guy, the owner of Penrose Jewellers, later stated: [...] "Everything she wrote about me was lies, I never gave her a job; she just hung around and made tea. She told me {{her father was}} dead. The only <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> true was she nicked stuff from the shop", which Guy said was worth £20,000.
