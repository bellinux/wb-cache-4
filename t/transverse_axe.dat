After describing the characteristics of various actuators and sensors, we motivate the choice of collocated electromagnetic actuators and a multi-axis piezoelectric bridge sensor. Integral control is shown experimentally to be capable of damping the string independently of the fundamental frequency.

40|$|During a spin-up or spin-down {{maneuver}} of {{a spinning}} spacecraft, it is usual to {{have not only}} a constant body-fixed torque about the desired spin axis, but also small undesired constant torques about the <b>transverse</b> <b>axes.</b> This causes {{the orientation of the}} angular momentum vector to change in inertial space. Since an analytic solution is available for the angular momentum vector as a function of time, this behavior can be studied for large variations of the dynamic parameters, such as the initial spin rate, the inertial properties and the torques.

40|$|The pattern {{regulation}} {{process in}} amphibian limbs has been examined {{with respect to}} the presence of discontinuities in the anterior-posterior (a-p) axis. Limbs bearing such discon-tinuities were surgically created by contralateral exchange of either dorsal or ventral half thighs and these limbs were then amputated immediately after surgery. The results demonstrate that a-p discontinuities lead to the formation of extra limb structures during distal outgrowth in contrast to the mosaic behaviour of comparable limb stumps which contain dorsal-ventral (d-v) discontinuities (Holder & Weekes, 1984). It is evident, therefore, that pattern regulation in the <b>transverse</b> limb <b>axes</b> is accomplished by basically different mechanisms.

40|$|The ALICE ITS Alignment Monitoring System, ITSAMS, is {{a simple}} {{geometrical}} optics system using off-the-shelf CMOS cameras and USB communication protocols. The system consists of four spherical mirrors and four camera modules, with each camera module containing a USB camera with a 1280 × 1024 pixel CMOS array, a 0. 8 mW laser diode light source, a fiber optic collimator, and an electronics driver board. The laser diode’s light is collimated into a beam and projected onto a spherical mirror which has a focal point located on the camera’s imager and then focuses the beam back onto the camera module’s CMOS array. A movement of either the mirror or the camera causes the beam spot on the CMOS array to move the same distance.

40|$|Objective. To {{measure the}} tibial torsion by {{curvature}} maps and study it’s reproducibility. Design. In vivo lower leg surface registration on 6 pairs of legs of adult men. Background. Tibial torsion is the angle between the <b>transverse</b> <b>axes</b> of the proximal and distal tibial articular surfaces, {{the degree of}} twisting of the tibia around its own longitudinal axis. The accurate measurement on the magnitude of tibial torsion is used when monitoring derangements in tibial torsion. It is also useful as a baseline {{in the event of}} surgical intervention. Various methods have been developed but none of them have gained wide acceptance. Even with the CT scan technique, the “gold standard ” until now, has great variability in results amongst researchers. Thus an objective, non-invasive and fast method is needed for the monitoring of tibial torsion in the clinical environment. Methods. The lower leg is scanned by a laser scanner, which gives the surface coordinates of the leg surface. By calculating the curvature maps of the leg from the 3 D coordinates, stable anatomical landmarks such as the lateral and medial malleoli could be located. The angle indicating the degree of tibial torsion can then be derived from thes...|$|R

40|$|AbstractLipid {{membranes}} manifest {{a diverse}} array of surface forces that can fold and orient an approaching protein. To better understand these forces {{and their ability to}} influence protein function, we have used infrared spectroscopy with isotopic editing to characterize the 37 -residue membrane-active antimicrobial polypeptide cecropin A as it approached, adsorbed onto, and finally penetrated various lipid membranes. Intermediate stages in this process were isolated for study by the use of internal reflection and Langmuir trough techniques. Results indicate that this peptide adopts well-ordered secondary structure while superficially adsorbed to a membrane surface. Its conformation is predominantly α-helical, although some β structure is likely to be present. The longitudinal axis of the helical structure, and the <b>transverse</b> <b>axes</b> of any β structure, are preferentially oriented parallel to the membrane surface. The peptide expands the membrane against pressure when it penetrates the membrane surface, but its structure and orientation do not change. These observations indicate that interactions between the peptide and deeper hydrophobic regions of the membrane provide energy to perform thermodynamic work, but separate and distinct interactions between the peptide and superficial components of the membrane are responsible for peptide folding. These results have broad implications for our understanding of the mechanism of action and the specificity of these antimicrobial peptides...|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} Lagrangian {{numerical}} simulations is performed {{to examine the}} dispersion process in open channel flows and to explain through a simple conceptual model its systematic deviations from the ideal long‐term one‐dimensional regime even {{in the case of}} straight axis and fixed impervious bed. The starting point is represented by a suitably depth‐averaged transport equation, with generally nonlocal turbulent mixing, solved in terms of particles trajectories and their first‐ and second‐order moments. Input data refer to six rivers of southern Italy, for which the irregular section morphology is known from a field survey. As the governing equation predicts, and according to experimental observations, in the case of variable cross‐sectional diffusion the tracer cloud exhibits a permanent and asymmetric peripheral drift toward the shallow boundary zones, with a remarkable deceleration along the main flow direction. Longitudinal inertia moments tend to become linear after a period equal to twice the single river diffusive time and sometimes show an early anomalous change of slope. Transverse inertia moments experience an initial very fast increment as compared to the theoretical value corresponding to the uniform transverse concentration and, after a peak, tend to stabilize about a smaller constant. Centrifugal moments remain, in any case, relatively limited, indicating that longitudinal and <b>transverse</b> <b>axes</b> practically identify with the plume principal directions, no matter how irregular and asymmetric the river section is...|$|R

We sought to establish a quantitative computational method based on contrast-enhanced MR angiography (CE-MRA) for estimating aneurysmal volume changes over time. Materials and Methods: Computational volume calculations were tested against a distensible phantom. Untreated patients with IA were followed longitudinally with annual MRI. Maximal linear dimensions along the longitudinal axis and two <b>transverse</b> <b>axes</b> were determined by visual review of maximum intensity projection (MIP) data, and aneurysm volume was approximated as (length x width x height) / 2. Averages of the visual approximations were compared to the lumenal volume as determined with a computational algorithm using the MRI data. Results: MRI-based measurements accurately represented volume changes in the phantom (R- 2 = 0. 97, Y = 1. 06 x + 271 CM 3). In the clinical study there were a total of 11 intervals of one-year follow-up in six patients (mean +/- SD age = 53 +/- 20 years). The raw one-year growth using the computational volume was 9 % +/- 17 %. The corresponding value for the averaged measurement of the reviewers was 8 % +/- 14 %.
