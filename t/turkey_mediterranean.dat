40|$|SAR {{interferometry}} is {{a well-known}} technique for producing surface models. In the global scale, the quality of these models significantly increased {{with the use of}} bistatic systems such as the German TanDEM-X mission. Quality can be measured in two scales: a global and a local one. A global scale quality analysis involves measures for the complete scene, characterizing the whole correctness with a single parameter. A local scale investigates instead inside the single elevation model cell, discriminating the different quality obtained by the various terrains and media present in the scene. Objective of this research is to define strategies for assessing standard and alternative elevation accuracy methods and to inspect the different capabilities of the bistatic system. Four investigations are carried out for this purpose: agricultural fields (Lake Gala, <b>Turkey),</b> <b>Mediterranean</b> hills (Serra de Collcardus, Spain), subglacial volcanoes (Bardarbunga, Iceland) and cities (Berlin, Germany) ...|$|E
40|$|Purpose - To {{contribute}} {{to the design of}} the energy service companies (ESCOs) ' environment in the Mediterranean countries, mainly focusing on the constraints this company's environment face and the actions that can fulfil its needs and aims, taking also into consideration the opportunities and threats emerging from the energy liberalization and climate change. Design/methodology/approach - The methodology that was followed (based in a large part on the context of two projects targeted to the Mediterranean region and funded by the European Commission) incorporated four steps, the desk analysis for energy efficiency potential in the Mediterranean, the data collection, the assessment of the constraints and the final assessment of the ESCOs' environment. Findings - Provides information regarding the current status of ESCOs' development, in the dimensions of the ESCOs' environment (political/legal, economical/financial, social/cultural and technological), both in the European Union (EU) (Cyprus, France, Greece, Italy, Malta and Spain) and non-EU (Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Syria, Tunisia and <b>Turkey)</b> <b>Mediterranean</b> countries. Originality/value - There are no papers investigating the activation environment of ESCOs in a coherent and integrated way in the Mediterranean.

Study findings suggest both hedonic and utilitarian shopping values are strongly linked to overall shopping satisfaction. Overall shopping satisfaction fully mediates utilitarian shopping value's effect on destination repatronage intention (DRI), destination word-of-mouth (DWoM), and partially mediates hedonic shopping value's (HSV) effect on DRI and DWoM.

40|$|The Burdur Lake basin in <b>Turkey’s</b> <b>Mediterranean</b> {{region has}} been facing severe {{environmental}} {{damage in the}} form of increased pollution and a decrease in water volume, despite its Ramsar status as a major wintering site for the endangered white-headed duck (Oxyura leucocephala). In fact, after the basin was granted Ramsar status it was made the subject of a ‘hard-park’ conservation policy. This in practice disenfranchised and alienated local people but did not lead to the effective preservation of the basin. We aim to shed light on the political ecology of the ongoing degradation, which has layers at local, national, and international levels, by using both quantitative and qualitative methods (consisting of in-depth interviews, focus groups, and face-to-face, randomly selected interviews with 625 people). We specifically explore the possible reasons why local people by and large did not—despite their high level of environmental concern about the site—demand conservation policies or voluntarily take action to preserve their site. Acknowledging that the sources of the problem are multilayered in nature, thus requiring a multilevel solution, we then propose a governance modality tailored for the case at hand. Since many of the problems that Burdur Lake faces are not unique, it is hoped that the conducted analysis will be relevant to other similar sites. ...|$|R
