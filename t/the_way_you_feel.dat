500|$|All {{of these}} new things {{entering}} my life are changing the way I view my purpose, but 'Dance in the Dark' in particular is about me wanting to live—but also, the song isn't called 'Dance in the Light'. I'm not a gospel singer trying to cross people over. What I'm saying is, 'I get it. I feel you, I feel the same way, and it's OK.' I {{hope and pray that}} I can inspire some sort of change in people subliminally through the show. They're singing 'Dance in the Dark,' but they're dancing and they're free, they're letting it out. But the songs are not about freedom, they're about [...] I get it. I feel <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel.</b>|$|E
500|$|While in Europe, Spears {{met with}} William Orbit and Daft Punk about {{possible}} collaborations, and originally confirmed Darkchild and The Neptunes as producers. When asked by The Hollywood Reporter {{about the direction}} of the record, Spears responded it was an organic evolution, adding, [...] "It should just happen naturally from <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel.</b> [...] Whatever happens, happens". Additionally, Spears scheduled meet-and-greets with Timbaland and Missy Elliott in an effort to help evolve her sound. Elliott would also enlist in further production work with Nisan Stewart for Spears' project, however none of the initial material saw the light of day. Fred Durst was asked by Spears' management to submit material, and he wrote and produced three trip hop tracks that were recorded by Spears in January 2003. However, after news of an affair between them broke, Durst told Jive Records {{he was not going to}} let them use the songs for the album. In March 2003, Lauren Christy from The Matrix spoke about the development of the album with MTV News, and likened their work with Spears to Madonna's 1998 album Ray of Light. Scott Spock, also from The Matrix, continued comparing her to Madonna, saying, ...|$|E

The script and storyboards went largely unused {{in favor of more}} experimental storytelling techniques. Bakshi said, [...] "I don't like to jump ahead on my films. <b>The</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> about a film on Day One, you may not feel the same way forty weeks down the road. Characters grow, so I wanted to have the option to change things, and strengthen my characters... It was sort of a stream of consciousness, and a learning process for myself." [...] Bakshi wrote the characters without feral animal behavior to lend the material greater realism.|$|E
