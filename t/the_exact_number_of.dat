5|$|For the {{remainder}} of the campaign, about 600 men from the regiment– including a batch of reinforcements that arrived in early October– carried out mainly defensive duties before leaving with the last Australian troops to be evacuated from the peninsula on 20 December. They did not take part in any large-scale battles, but were involved in fighting off a number of sharp attacks. <b>The</b> <b>exact</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> casualties suffered is not known, but 18 men from the regiment are known to have been killed in this time.|$|E
5|$|It is {{estimated}} that the Turkish 27th and 57th Infantry Regiments lost around 2,000 men, or fifty per cent of their combined strength.

5|$|The Turks never {{succeeded in}} {{capturing}} the beachhead, {{and at the}} end of the year the ANZAC forces were evacuated to Egypt. During the 260 days of the Gallipoli Campaign, the British Empire forces took 213,980 casualties. 35,000 of those were from the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps, which included 8,709 Australian and 2,721 New Zealand dead. <b>The</b> <b>exact</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> Turkish casualties is not known, but has been estimated at 87,000 dead from a total of around 250,000 casualties.|$|E

5|$|The largest genera are Gagea (200), Fritillaria (130), Lilium (110), and Tulipa (75 species), {{all within}} the Lilieae tribe. Various {{authorities}} (e.g. ITIS 16, GRIN 27, WCSP, NCBI, DELTA) differ on <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> genera included in Liliaceae s.s., but generally {{there are about}} fifteen to sixteen genera, depending {{on whether or not}} Amana is included in Tulipa and Lloydia in Gagea.

5|$|The {{river and}} its {{drainage}} basin experienced {{some of the}} world's greatest known catastrophic floods {{toward the end of}} the last ice age. The periodic rupturing of ice dams at Glacial Lake Missoula resulted in the Missoula Floods, with discharges exceeding the combined flow of all the other rivers in the world, dozens of times over thousands of years. <b>The</b> <b>exact</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> floods is unknown, but geologists have documented at least 40; evidence suggests that they occurred between about 19,000 and 13,000years ago.|$|E

50|$|Conditions {{in these}} {{detention}} camps were especially harsh. Among the most infamous was the detention camp in Doboj.

5|$|While it is {{believed}} that they were not particularly numerous, <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> Hoosiers to serve in Confederate armies is unknown. It is likely that most traveled to Kentucky to join Confederate regiments formed in that state. At least one Hoosier, Sgt. Henry L. Stone of Greencastle, Indiana, rode with John Hunt Morgan when he raided Indiana. Former U.S. Army officer Francis A. Shoup, who briefly led the Indianapolis Zouave militia unit, left for Florida prior to the war, and ultimately become a Confederate brigadier general.|$|E
5|$|A {{little more}} than thirty years later, in August 1964, {{paleontologist}} John Ostrom led an expedition from Yale's Peabody Museum of Natural History which discovered more skeletal material near Bridger. Expeditions during the following two summers uncovered more than 1,000 bones, among which were at least three individuals. Since the association between the various recovered bones was weak, making <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> individual animals represented impossible to determine properly, the type specimen (YPM 5205) of Deinonychus was restricted to the complete left foot and partial right foot that definitely belonged to the same individual. The remaining specimens were catalogued in fifty separate entries at Yale's Peabody Museum although they could have been from as few as three individuals.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> French {{prisoners who}} escaped from captivity in Germany is unknown, {{it has been}} {{estimated}} at around 70,000, representing approximately five per cent of all French prisoners. The Vichy government did not encourage prisoners to escape, but many of its officials were sympathetic to escapees who reached French territory. Some prisoners, particularly those working in agriculture, spent substantial amounts of time without guards, and prisoners caught by the Germans trying to escape were rarely severely punished. During the period of detention in France, fines were sometimes imposed on locals for mass escapes of prisoners in the region. It was partially to prevent escapes that led to the German decision to deport prisoners to the Reich.|$|E
50|$|The Kinosternidae are {{a family}} of mostly small turtles that {{includes}} the mud turtles and musk turtles. The family contains 25 species within four genera, but taxonomic reclassification is an ongoing process, so many sources vary on <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> species and subspecies. They inhabit slow-moving bodies of water, often with soft, muddy bottoms and abundant vegetation.|$|R

50|$|The larger {{crowd was}} also more {{determined}} than the first. Lafayette again tried to disperse it. In retaliation, the crowd threw stones at the National Guard.

5|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> {{churches that}} existed in Visby during the Middle Ages is unknown, there were {{certainly}} more {{than in any other}} Swedish city, and at least twelve within the city walls. Visby grew to become an important trading port during the Middle Ages, and most of the churches in the city were built during the 12th and 13th centuries. The churches were not, as in the countryside, only parish churches. Some belonged to abbeys, almshouses or served groups of traders of a specific nationality, such as the Russian Church or present-day Visby Cathedral, which was originally a church used by German traders.|$|E
5|$|Although {{they failed}} to achieve their objectives, by nightfall the ANZACs had formed a beachhead, albeit much smaller than intended. In places they were {{clinging}} onto cliff faces with no organised defence system. Their precarious position convinced both divisional commanders to ask for an evacuation, but after taking advice from the Royal Navy about how practicable that would be, the army commander decided they would stay. <b>The</b> <b>exact</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> the day's casualties is not known. The ANZACs had landed two divisions but over two thousand of their men had been killed or wounded, together {{with at least a}} similar number of Turkish casualties.|$|E
5|$|Dukovac was the top-scoring Croatian {{pilot of}} World War II. During his life, {{there was much}} {{controversy}} surrounding <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> aircraft that he had downed. Croatian wartime documents discovered in the Military History Institute in Belgrade after his death show that the ZNDH credited him with 44 confirmed kills. At least one other source indicates a tally of 40 confirmed kills with five unconfirmed. The ZNDH total of 44 included 18 LaGG-3s, 12 Ilyushin Il-2s, three P-39s, two DB-3s, two Yak-1s, and one {{each of the following}} aircraft; II-16, MiG-3, Spitfire, La-5, Yak-9, Pe-2, and A-20. The ZNDH records also noted one unconfirmed claim.|$|E
