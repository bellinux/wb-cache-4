5|$|Stage 3 (24 to 72 hours) {{kidney failure}} {{is the result}} of {{ethylene}} glycol poisoning. In cats, this stage occurs 12–24 hours after getting into antifreeze; in dogs, at 36–72 hours after getting into antifreeze. During this stage, severe kidney failure is developing secondary to calcium oxalate crystals forming in the kidneys. Severe lethargy, coma, depression, vomiting, seizures, drooling, and inappetance may be seen. Other symptoms include acute <b>tubular</b> <b>necrosis,</b> red blood cells in the urine, excess proteins in the urine, lower back pain, decreased or absent production of urine, elevated blood concentration of potassium, and acute kidney failure. If kidney failure occurs it is typically reversible, although weeks or months of supportive care including hemodialysis may be required before kidney function returns.|$|E
5|$|Rhabdomyolysis {{may cause}} kidney failure by several mechanisms. The most {{important}} is the accumulation of myoglobin in the kidney tubules. Normally, the blood protein haptoglobin binds circulating myoglobin and other heme-containing substances, but in rhabdomyolysis the quantity of myoglobin exceeds the binding capacity of haptoglobin. Myoglobinuria, the presence of myoglobin in the urine, occurs when the level in plasma exceeds 0.5–1.5mg/dl; once plasma levels reach 100mg/dl, the concentration in the urine becomes sufficient {{for it to be}} visibly discolored and corresponds with the destruction of about 200grams of muscle. As the kidneys reabsorb more water from the , myoglobin interacts with Tamm–Horsfall protein in the nephron to form casts (solid aggregates) that obstruct the normal flow of fluid; the condition is worsened further by high levels of uric acid and acidification of the filtrate, which increase cast formation. Iron released from the heme generates reactive oxygen species, damaging the kidney cells. In addition to the myoglobinuria, two other mechanisms contribute to kidney impairment: low blood pressure leads to constriction of the blood vessels and therefore a relative lack of blood flow to the kidney, and finally uric acid may form crystals in the tubules of the kidneys, causing obstruction. Together, these processes lead to acute <b>tubular</b> <b>necrosis,</b> the destruction of the cells of tubules. Glomerular filtration rate falls and the kidney is unable to perform its normal excretory functions. This causes disruption of electrolyte regulation, leading to a further rise in potassium levels, and interferes with vitamin D processing, further worsening the low calcium levels.|$|E

40|$|The {{peripheral}} benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) is {{a critical}} component of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, which is involved in the regulation of cell death. In the present study we investigated the role of PBR in the regulation of signaling pathways leading to apoptotic and necrotic damage and renal dysfunction in a rat model of ischemia-reperfusion. Renal ischemia-reperfusion led to extended <b>tubular</b> apoptosis and <b>necrosis</b> that were associated with peroxidative damage, high levels of proapoptotic Bax expression, and low levels of antiapoptotic Bcl- 2 expression, cleavage of death substrate, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), and activation of a key effector of apoptosis, caspase- 3.

30|$|Kidneys {{from all}} animals were weighed, {{observed}} for abnormalities in size or color, {{and placed in}} NBF. Histological analysis was performed by Seventh Wave (Chesterfield, MO). Microscopic lesions were graded {{on a scale of}} one to four, with four being the most severe. Tubulointerstitial nephritis was characterized by multifocal non-suppurative interstitial inflammation, interstitial fibrosis, <b>tubular</b> epithelial degeneration, <b>necrosis,</b> and regeneration with frequent intra-tubular neutrophilic inflammation and cellular debris.|$|R
25|$|Acute kidney injury due to acute <b>tubular</b> <b>necrosis</b> (ATN) was {{recognized}} in the 1940s in the United Kingdom, where crush injury victims during the London Blitz developed patchy necrosis of kidney tubules, leading to a sudden decrease in kidney function. During the Korean and Vietnam wars, the incidence of AKI decreased due to better acute management and administration of intravenous fluids.|$|E
25|$|Intrinsic AKI {{refers to}} disease {{processes}} which directly damage the kidney itself. Intrinsic AKI can {{be due to}} {{one or more of the}} kidney's structures including the glomeruli, kidney tubules, or the interstitium. Common causes of each are glomerulonephritis, acute <b>tubular</b> <b>necrosis</b> (ATN), and acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), respectively. Other causes of intrinsic AKI are rhabdomyolysis and tumor lysis syndrome. Certain medication classes such as calcineurin inhibitors (e.g., tacrolimus) can also directly damage the tubular cells of the kidney and result in a form of intrinsic AKI.|$|E
500|$|Many other {{diseases}} of the kidney are associated with liver disease and must be excluded before making a diagnosis of hepatorenal syndrome. [...] Individuals with pre-renal kidney failure do not have damage to the kidneys, but as in individuals with HRS, have kidney dysfunction due to decreased {{blood flow to the}} kidneys. Also, similarly to HRS, pre-renal kidney failure causes the formation of urine that has a very low sodium concentration. In contrast to HRS, however, pre-renal kidney failure usually responds to treatment with intravenous fluids, resulting in reduction in serum creatinine and increased excretion of sodium. [...] Acute <b>tubular</b> <b>necrosis</b> (ATN) involves damage to the tubules of the kidney, and can be a complication in individuals with cirrhosis, because of exposure to toxic medications or the development of decreased blood pressure. [...] Because of the damage to the tubules, ATN affected kidneys usually are unable to maximally resorb sodium from the urine. [...] As a result, ATN can be distinguished from HRS on the basis of laboratory testing, as individuals with ATN will have urine sodium measurements that are much higher than in HRS; however, this may not always be the case in cirrhotics. [...] Individuals with ATN also may have evidence of hyaline casts or muddy-brown casts in the urine on microscopy, whereas the urine of individuals with HRS is typically devoid of cellular material, as the kidneys have not been directly injured. [...] Some viral infections of the liver, including hepatitis B and hepatitis C can also lead to inflammation of the glomerulus of the kidney. [...] Other causes of kidney failure in individuals with liver disease include drug toxicity (notably, the antibiotic gentamicin) or contrast nephropathy, caused by intravenous administration of contrast agents used for medical imaging tests.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: In 1956, Africanized honeybees (AHB) {{migrated}} from Brazil to {{other regions of}} the Western Hemisphere, including South, Central, and North America, except for Canada. Despite being productive, they are highly aggressive and cause fatal accidents. This study aimed to evaluate patients at the Clinical Hospital of Botucatu Medical School (HC-FMB) and to propose treatment guidelines. METHODS: From 2005 to 2006, the clinical and laboratorial aspects of 11 patients (7 male and 4 female) and the anatomopathological aspects of one patient who had died in 2003 were analyzed. RESULTS: The age of the surviving patients varied from 5 to 87 years, with a mean of 42. 5 years. The majority of accidents occurred in the afternoon, and the number of stings ranged from 20 to 500. The principal signs and symptoms were pain and local inflammatory signs, nausea, tachycardia, and vomiting. Biochemical findings presented increased levels of creatine phosphokinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and aspartate/alanine aminotransferase. An 11 -year-old male patient died upon entering the attic of a two-storey building where he was attacked by a swarm, receiving more than 1, 000 stings. He was sent to HC-FMB where he was treated, but he died 24 h later. Observed at the autopsy were erythematous-purpuric skin lesions besides necrosis at the sting locations, rhabdomyolysis, focal myocardial <b>necrosis,</b> <b>tubular</b> hydropic degeneration and focal <b>tubular</b> acute <b>necrosis</b> of the kidneys, myoglobinuria, and centrolobular necrosis in the liver.
