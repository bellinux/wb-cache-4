40|$|Background: Approximately 30 % of Sri Lankans {{work in the}} {{agricultural}} industry, with the third largest agricultural product being rubber. Rubber tapping involves repetitive and high paced work, static muscle loading, non-neutral body postures, and forceful physical exertion, all potential risk factors for musculoskeletal disorders. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on two plantations near Galle, Sri Lanka to study the risk factors of MSDs and injuries in rubber <b>tappers.</b> Questionnaires were administered to 300 rubber <b>tappers,</b> and an ergonomic analysis using Quick Exposure Check was performed on 90 <b>tappers.</b> Univariate and multivariate analysis {{were used to determine}} risk factors for MSDs and injuries. Results: 66 % of rubber <b>tappers</b> reported experiencing an MSD in the past 12 months. Multivariate analysis revealed that many demographic, work condition, personal and psychosocial factors were associated with MSDs. A total of 594 injuries were experienced in the last 12 months, resulting in <b>tappers</b> missing 1080 days of work. Factors associated with injuries were working an additional job and depression. Conclusions: MSDs and injuries are common among rubber <b>tappers</b> in Sri Lanka. Numerous factors contribute to the high prevalence. These results suggest a need for injury monitoring on plantations. Furthermore, work process modifications should be used to help reduce the number of MSDs and injuries. Thesi...|$|R
