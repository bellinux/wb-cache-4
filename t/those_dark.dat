These entities are perceived as dangerous, with the ONA advising caution when interacting with them. Among <b>those</b> <b>Dark</b> Gods whose identities have been discussed in the Order's publicly available material are a goddess named Baphomet who is depicted as a mature woman carrying a severed head, with the ONA stating that the name is of ancient Greek origin. In addition, there are entities whose names, according to Monette, are borrowed from or influenced by figures from Classical sources and astronomy, such as Kthunae, Nemicu, and Atazoth.|$|E
500|$|The same evidences of {{mourning}} were seen along the levee. The Halliday Hotel the City National Bank {{and the gas}} office all bore crepe on their doors, while a number of buildings along the levee were draped in black and flags hung at half-mast.The funeral of the late Capt. Halliday {{was held at the}} Halliday Hotel Tuesday afternoon. [...] Long before two o’clock the crowds commenced to gather and when the services began the parlors and halfway were crowded with people and numbers could not get upstairs but waited in the office or outside on the street. Rev. F. A. DeRosset, rector of the Church of the Redeemer, conducted the last solemn rites and a quartette choir composed of Mr. Buchanan, Miss Lelia Miller, and Messrs. Buchanan and Tunnel sang several beautiful hymns. [...] The funeral address was delivered by Rev. C. T. Phillips, of Princeville, Ill., formerly pastor of the Presbyterian Church here. [...] Mr. Phillips was a close friend of the deceased, and it was the wish of Capt. Halliday that he might assist in the service. [...] Mr. Phillips spoke of the Captain’s kindness and generosity, how he rendered assistance to so many and did it in such a delicate way that no sensitive or proud natures were hurt. [...] He spoke of the Captain’s loyalty to Cairo. [...] How he aided the city in its struggle against the great floods; how he instructed the bank to cash all paper issued by the city in <b>those</b> <b>dark</b> days; how his fortune was ready to be used in protecting life and property here, and how his barges were always placed in readiness to be sunk opposite weak places in the levee. [...] He told of a conversation the Captain had with him in the panic days of 1892-’93, when banks were failing everywhere, in which the deceased said his entire fortune was ready to preserve the integrity of the bank here and to protect the businessmen from loss. [...] He told what a kind employer Capt. Halliday was, how a position with him was a life job if the employee did his work faithfully. [...] Mr. Phillips said he had known men at DuQuoin 21 years ago that were still in the service of Capt. Halliday. [...] He told how Capt. Halliday watched the careers of young men who were striving to get ahead in life, and how he helped them to get on by opening the way for them without ever letting them see his hand. [...] All this he told and more of the man whom he termed the best friend Cairo ever had.|$|E

2500|$|I compare {{human life}} to a large Mansion of Many Apartments, two of which I can only describe, {{the doors of the}} rest being as yet shut upon me—The first we step into we call the infant or thoughtless Chamber, in which we remain as long as we do not think—We remain there a long while, and {{notwithstanding}} the doors of the second Chamber remain wide open, showing a bright appearance, we care not to hasten to it; but are at length imperceptibly impelled by the awakening of the thinking principle—within us—we no sooner get into the second Chamber, which I shall call the Chamber of Maiden-Thought, than we become intoxicated with the light and the atmosphere, we see nothing but pleasant wonders, and think of delaying there for ever in delight: However among the effects this breathing is father of is that tremendous one of sharpening one's vision into the heart and nature of Man—of convincing ones nerves that the World is full of Misery and Heartbreak, Pain, Sickness, and oppression—whereby This Chamber of Maiden Thought becomes gradually darken'd {{and at the same time}} on all sides of it many doors are set open—but all dark—all leading to dark passages—We see not the balance of good and evil.

Indeed, with fear and terror I imagine the time, when <b>those</b> <b>dark</b> iconoclasts come to power: with their raw fists they will batter all marble images of my beloved world of art, they will ruin all those fantastic anecdotes that the poets loved so much, they will chop down my Laurel forests and plant potatoes and, oh!, the herbs chandler will use my Book of Songs to make bags for coffee and snuff for the old women of the future – oh!, I can foresee all this and I feel deeply sorry thinking of this decline threatening my poetry and the old world order – And yet, I freely confess, the same thoughts have a magical appeal upon my soul which I cannot resist .... In my chest there are two voices in their favour which cannot be silenced .... because {{the first one is}} that of logic ... and as I cannot object to the premise [...] "that all {{people have the right to}} eat", I must defer to all the conclusions....The second of the two compelling voices, of which I am talking, is even more powerful than the first, because it is the voice of hatred, the hatred I dedicate to this common enemy that constitutes the most distinctive contrast to communism and that will oppose the angry giant already at the first instance – I am talking about the party of the so-called advocates of nationality in Germany, about those false patriots whose love for the fatherland only exists in the shape of imbecile distaste of foreign countries and neighbouring peoples and who daily pour their bile especially on France".|$|E
2500|$|The mixtape is {{predominantly}} R/pop; however, JoJo describes the mixtape's sound as genre-less. On the first {{track of the}} tape [...] "Back2thebeginningagain" [...] JoJo talks about her constant record label struggles and how she finally feels okay to record the type of music she has always wanted to. JoJo states [...] "It's about driving around Foxborough in my mom's Toyota Echo with the dents {{on the side of}} it and just getting in touch with my roots: Who I am; where I came from. I'm talking about some of <b>those</b> <b>dark</b> times where I've drank until I've gone to sleep and woken up and feeling like 'ok, everything else is in the past. Today I start forward and start fresh.'" [...] The mixtape's second track [...] "We Get By" [...] is mainly of an old school R/pop genre. It is written by JoJo who expresses remaining optimistic in spite of the obstacles she faces. [...] "I know it will be OK. I believe in myself" [...] she sings, referring to her constant label troubles. JoJo states [...] "It's kind of about me moving from South Boston to Los Angeles and my decision to do that. Feeling like I needed a place to explore and grow." [...] She goes on further in another interview stating [...] "It's the mission statement for {{what we were going to}} expand upon, and I was touching on the feeling like you don't belong anywhere but you still feel like you're going to be okay no matter where you're at." [...] The third track on the tape [...] "Take the Canyon" [...] is influenced by an old relationship. JoJo says [...] "'Take the Canyon' is about cheating, and it's about only having a window of time to be with that lover and needing to get there as soon as possible for this illicit rendezvous. It's about taking the canyon–Beverly Glen or Laurel Canyon or whatever it may be." [...] The fourth track is titled [...] "Billions" [...] and was originally written about an old lover. JoJo states [...] "it became about my family. As much as I can see in the world, there's nothing more important to me than that foundation of family, friendship and real love." ...|$|E
