50|$|Compliance to {{type-approval}} requirements can be {{denoted by}} a third-party marking {{on the back}} of the product (e.g. ABS, TUV,UL, CSA), or by a <b>Type-Approval</b> <b>certificate</b> obtained by a manufacturer and kept on file. The CE mark found {{on the back of}} many electronic devices does not mean that the product has obtained Type Approval in the European Union. The CE mark is the manufacturer's declaration that the system/assembly meets the MINIMUM safety requirements of all the Directives (laws) applicable to it, and of itself, does not signify any Third Party involvement in the design or testing of a system/assembly. Many of the New Approach safety directives do not mandate third party involvement at all (e.g. LVD, EMD), and the ones that do (e.g. PED, MDD, ATEX) only require Notified Body (NoBo) involvement above a certain degree of risk category. When the risk category mandates this involvement, the CE Marking on the system/assembly will be followed by the NoBo number, which right to use is granted by the NoBo after the required design review, testing or auditing, as spelled out in the Conformity Assessment options of each Directive. See http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/single-market-goods/cemarking/about-ce-marking/index_en.htm. On the other hand, in China type approval is denoted by the CCC mark.|$|E
