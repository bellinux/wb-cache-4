5|$|Known {{methods for}} {{repeatedly}} finding the closest pair of clusters in a dynamic set of clusters either require superlinear space {{to maintain a}} data structure that can find closest pairs quickly, or they take greater than linear time to find each closest pair. The nearest-neighbor chain algorithm uses a smaller {{amount of time and}} space than <b>the</b> <b>greedy</b> algorithm by merging pairs of clusters in a different order. In this way, it avoids the problem of repeatedly finding closest pairs. Nevertheless, for many types of clustering problem, it can be guaranteed {{to come up with the}} same hierarchical clustering as <b>the</b> <b>greedy</b> algorithm despite the different merge order.|$|E

40|$|As a {{solution}} algorithm for Unbounded Knapsack Problem, the performance analysis of density-ordered greedy heuristic, weight-ordered greedy heuristic, value-ordered greedy heuristic, extended greedy heuristic and total-value heuristic has been done. Empirical experiments on different test {{problems have been}} analysed and reported. Problem instances with {{a very large number}} of undominated items were generated in addition to the types of instances suggested by Martello and Toth (1990). Theoretically, the lower bound on the performance for total-value heuristic is better than the corresponding lower bounds for <b>the</b> densityordered <b>greedy</b> heuristic and <b>the</b> extended <b>greedy</b> heuristic as discussed by White (1992) and Kohli and Krishnamurti (1992). The computational tests fail to show clear superiority of any particular heuristic algorithm, although each heuristic produces good quality solutions. If the combination of <b>the</b> density-ordered <b>greedy</b> and <b>the</b> total-value <b>greedy</b> heuristics are considered then the combination shows complementary effect. A new heuristic algorithm incorporating the structural properties of <b>the</b> density-ordered <b>greedy</b> heuristic and <b>the</b> total-value <b>greedy</b> heuristic is developed and its complementary effect studied. It was found that the combination of <b>the</b> density-ordered <b>greedy</b> heuristic, <b>the</b> extended <b>greedy</b> heuristic, <b>the</b> total-value <b>greedy</b> heuristic and <b>the</b> new complementary heuristic gives a better performance result than the single best heuristic in the combination...|$|R

The cooling 4.e6 avoids complications and heads for an equal endgame with 4...dxe6 5.Qxd8+ Kxd8, Black's loss {{of the right to}} castle being of no great importance since queens have been traded.

Charlie, on finding some money in the street, just intends to enjoy one chocolate bar when news breaks that the Russian ticket was fake.

40|$|<b>The</b> k-batch <b>greedy</b> {{strategy}} is an approximate algorithm to solve optimization problems where the optimal solution {{is hard to}} obtain. Starting with the empty set, <b>the</b> k-batch <b>greedy</b> strategy adds a batch of k elements to the current solution set with the largest gain in the objective function while satisfying the constraints. In this paper, we bound the performance of <b>the</b> k-batch <b>greedy</b> strategy {{with respect to the}} optimal strategy by defining the total curvature α_k. We show that when the objective function is nondecreasing and submodular, <b>the</b> k-batch <b>greedy</b> strategy satisfies a harmonic bound 1 /(1 +α_k) for a general matroid constraint and an exponential bound (1 -(1 -α_k/t) ^t) /α_k for a uniform matroid constraint, where k divides the cardinality of the maximal set in the general matroid, t=K/k is an integer, and K is the rank of the uniform matroid. We also compare the performance of <b>the</b> k-batch <b>greedy</b> strategy with that of the k_ 1 -batch greedy strategy when k_ 1 divides k. Specifically, we prove that when the objective function is nondecreasing and submodular, <b>the</b> k-batch <b>greedy</b> strategy has better harmonic and exponential bounds in terms of the total curvature.
