40|$|Dog is {{an animal}} that we {{frequently}} see around the neighbourhood. There {{are a lot of}} people who choose dog as a pets because well known as a loyal animal to human. The knowledge about dog is important and necessary for dog's owner in order to maintain its health. The most frequent problem is that society does not have enough knowledge about <b>dog's</b> <b>diseases</b> and they have limited accessibility to consult with experts. This study develops expert system that has the ability to diagnose <b>dog's</b> <b>diseases.</b> The system has 19 basic knowledge of <b>dog's</b> <b>diseases</b> and 66 clinical symptoms. The system is built using PHP web based program and MySQL database. This study uses forward chaining method as a logical method. The system provides output as the probability of <b>dog's</b> <b>diseases</b> based on the result of consultation using input of symptoms undertaken by the user. According to the functional test system that has been conducted, it is concluded that this expert system has fulfilled the requirements for implementation. The system can assist our society to access information on <b>dog's</b> <b>diseases</b> and their treatments. People can consult to discover the possible diseases suffered by their dogs. The expert system is also beneficial as a storage of the expert's knowledge. Society is expected to gain information on <b>dog's</b> <b>diseases</b> more easily, timely, and accurately...|$|R

25|$|However, U.S. pilots claimed 6,600 trucks {{destroyed}} {{along the}} trail during the same period. This mismatch in numbers, combined with a sensor surveillance program begun in late 1967, {{cast doubt on the}} accuracy of the road watch teams. More importantly, the February 1968 advent of AC-130 Spectre gunships with all their onboard electronic surveillance rendered ground observation largely obsolete. A new military intelligence processing center called Task Force Alpha opened at Nakhon Phanom to collate all sources of information from the trail. By Summer 1969, the road watch teams were dwindling away. The ever-increasing countermeasures of enemy foot patrols and use of <b>tracker</b> <b>dogs</b> also had its effect. In any event, the U.S. air effort against PAVN trucks had reached its limit; it became obvious that no matter the true truck count, air strikes were not going to halt the infiltration.|$|R

However, he tells the platoon that the enemy are dropping empty parachutes to confuse the people, and if they spot one, they must report it to GHQ. Jones wonders what the difference is between British parachutes and Nazi parachutes. Mainwaring's memo tells him that British parachutes are white, while Nazi parachutes are a dirty, creamy, off-white. Frazer points out that the parachutist may be miles away by the time they find the parachute, so Walker decides to bring a <b>tracker</b> <b>dog</b> to the next parade.|$|R

50|$|At the German headquarters, general Von Klinkerhoffen is {{very glad}} that the Gestapo's plan has been revealed. He tells Helga, colonel Von Strohm and captain Bertorelli that, {{in order for the}} credit for {{discovering}} the resistance headquarters not to go to the Gestapo, they will adpot their plan and put it into operation first. The colonel points out that their faces are familiar and {{that they will not be}} able to pass themselves off as British airmen. However, captain Bertorelli points out, that the faces of his men are not known and thus, the task of jumping out of a captured British aeroplane while the Germans are firing blanks at them, goes to Bertorelli's men. In order for the Germans not to lose them when the resistance have picked them up, they will be outfitted with aniseed balls, which they will drop every ten meters. Then, the Germans will have <b>tracker</b> <b>dogs</b> that will be able to find them that way.|$|R
