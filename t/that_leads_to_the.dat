5|$|State Route 54 (SR54) is a {{state highway}} in San Diego, California that connects Interstate 5 (I-5) in Chula Vista and National City {{to the city of}} El Cajon. The westernmost part of the highway is known as the South Bay Freeway, {{intersecting}} with I-5 and I-805 and running along the Sweetwater River before ending at the intersection with SR 125 and Jamacha Boulevard. The part east of SR94 is an undivided highway <b>that</b> <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> city limits of ElCajon. County Route S17 (CRS17) connects the two portions of the highway; the center portion of SR54 was never constructed.|$|E
5|$|Unless the {{pituitary}} {{damage is}} being {{caused by a}} tumor that overproduces a particular hormone, it {{is the lack of}} pituitary hormones <b>that</b> <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> symptoms described above, and an excess of a particular hormone would indicate the presence of a tumor. The exception to this rule is prolactin: if a tumor compresses the pituitary stalk, a decreased blood supply means that the lactotrope cells, which produce prolactin, are not receiving dopamine and therefore produce excess prolactin. Hence, mild elevations in prolactin are attributed to stalk compression. Very high prolactin levels, though, point more strongly towards a prolactinoma (prolactin-secreting tumor).|$|E

5|$|As noted above, the Moon's orbit is also elliptical. The Moon's {{distance}} from the Earth can vary by about 6% from its average value. Therefore, the Moon's apparent size varies with its {{distance from}} the Earth, {{and it is this}} effect <b>that</b> <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> difference between total and annular eclipses. The distance of the Earth from the Sun also varies during the year, but this is a smaller effect. On average, the Moon appears to be slightly smaller than the Sun as seen from the Earth, so the majority (about 60%) of central eclipses are annular. It is only when the Moon is closer to the Earth than average (near its perigee) that a total eclipse occurs.|$|E
5|$|Galiella rufa {{produces}} several structurally related hexaketide {{compounds that}} have attracted attention for their biological properties: pregaliellalactone, galiellalactone. The compounds have anti-nematodal activity, killing the nematodes Caenorhabditis elegans and Meloidogyne incognita. These compounds {{have been shown}} in laboratory tests to inhibit the early steps of the biosynthetic pathways induced by plant hormones known as gibberellic acids, and they also inhibit the germination of seeds of several plants. Galiellalactone is additionally a highly selective and potent inhibitor of interleukin-6 (IL-6) signaling in HepG2 cells. IL-6 is a multifunctional cytokine which is produced by a large variety of cells and functions as a regulator of immune response, acute phase reactions, and hematopoiesis. Researchers {{are interested in the}} potential of small-molecule inhibitors (such as the ones produced by G.rufa) to interfere with the IL-6 signaling cascade <b>that</b> <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> expression of genes involved in disease.|$|E
5|$|Later vestiges {{date from}} the Roman epoch and include a colonnaded road lined with shops. Of the large marble columns {{bordering}} the Roman street only fragments and bases remain. The Romans also built a monumental staircase adorned with mosaic patterns <b>that</b> <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top of the podium. To {{the right of the}} Roman road, near the entrance of the site stands a nymphaeum with niches where statues of the nymphs once stood. The floor of the nymphaeum is covered by a mosaic depicting the Maenads. Across the colonnaded road, facing the nymphaeum, are the ruins of a Roman villa; only the villa's courtyard has survived along with the remains of a mosaic depicting the four seasons. To the right of the processional Roman staircase stands a cubic altar, also of Roman construction. Other Roman period structures include two columns of a great portico leading to pools and other cultic installations.|$|E

For this, something should be said to clear up the question.|$|E
5|$|A former colonial marshal on the {{backwater}} {{planet of}} Mar Sara, Raynor joins Arcturus Mengsk's revolutionaries in their {{fight against the}} tyrannical and corrupt Confederacy of Man, where he develops a relationship with Sarah Kerrigan, Mengsk's second in command. However, he quickly comes to realise that Mengsk {{is far from the}} force for good when he abandons Kerrigan and the entire population of a planet to die by the hand of the Zerg to satisfy his own thirst for power. Disillusioned and embittered, Raynor deserts Mengsk and becomes a persona non grata in the new Terran Dominion. The situation gets no better when Kerrigan, who was captured by the Zerg, is assimilated into the swarm and becomes one of their most powerful assets. After desertion, Raynor and his forces take part in major combat operations across the sector: He fights alongside the Protoss templar Tassadar in the battle <b>that</b> <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fall of the Zerg ruler, the Overmind, and splinters the Zerg into several factions. When the expeditionary forces of United Earth Directorate (UED) arrive in the sector to subjugate it, Raynor, Mengsk and Kerrigan (now calling herself the Queen of Blades) combine their Terran, Zerg and Protoss allies to repel the invasion. No sooner than they fall, the alliance shatters.|$|E

5|$|Apart from {{stimulating}} {{the development of}} urban areas, temples and religious buildings featured a number of unique aesthetic and structural features. The Temple of the Saintly Mother (圣母殿) and the Hall of Sacrifice of the Jin Temple (晋祠), located in a southeastern suburb of Taiyuan City, Shanxi province, are extant examples of early Song architecture. The Temple of the Saintly Mother is the main building of the Jin Temple, first built in the period between 1023 and 1032 and renovated in 1102. It has a double-eaved roof with nine ridges, and two dragon-heads with wide-open jaws biting {{the ends of the}} main ridge. The roof is supported by massive dougong brackets corresponding to drawings in Yingzao Fashi. The eaves of the Temple of the Saintly Mother curve upward slightly at each end, a characteristic of Song architecture. The columns of the façade, decorated with dragons that coil around the shafts, become progressively taller with increasing distance to either side of the central pair. The building has a porch around it, the sole example of such a structure; another unique feature of the site is a cross-shaped bridge <b>that</b> <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Goddess Temple.|$|E
5|$|BioShock {{is set in}} 1960. The player {{guides the}} protagonist, Jack, after his {{airplane}} crashes in the ocean near the bathysphere terminus <b>that</b> <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> underwater city of Rapture. Built by the business magnate Andrew Ryan, the city {{was intended to be}} an isolated utopia, but the discovery of ADAM, a genetic material which can be used to grant superhuman powers, initiated the city's turbulent decline. Jack tries {{to find a way to}} escape, fighting through hordes of ADAM-obsessed enemies, and the iconic, deadly Big Daddies, while engaging with the few sane humans that remain and eventually learning of Rapture's past. The player, as Jack, is able to defeat foes in a number of ways by using weapons, utilizing plasmids that give unique powers, and by turning Rapture's own defenses against them. BioShock includes elements of role-playing games, giving the player different approaches in engaging enemies such as by stealth, as well as moral choices of saving or killing characters; additionally, the game and biopunk theme borrow concepts from the survival horror genre.|$|E
5|$|For males, the {{reproductive}} {{system is the}} testis, suspended in the body cavity by tracheae and the fat body. Most male insects have a pair of testes, inside of which are sperm tubes or follicles that are enclosed within a membranous sac. The follicles connect to the vas deferens by the vas efferens, and the two tubular vasa deferentia connect to a median ejaculatory duct <b>that</b> <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> outside. A portion of the vas deferens is often enlarged to form the seminal vesicle, which stores the sperm before they are discharged into the female. The seminal vesicles have glandular linings that secrete nutrients for nourishment and maintenance of the sperm. The ejaculatory duct is derived from an invagination of the epidermal cells during development and, as a result, has a cuticular lining. The terminal portion of the ejaculatory duct may be sclerotized to form the intromittent organ, the aedeagus. The remainder of the male reproductive system is derived from embryonic mesoderm, except for the germ cells, or spermatogonia, which descend from the primordial pole cells very early during embryogenesis.|$|E
