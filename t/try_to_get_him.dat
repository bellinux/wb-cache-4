Kulwicki declined, stating that he was more interested in running his own team. He won his second Cup race at Rockingham on October 21, 1990, and finished eighth in points that year, his first finish in the top10 points in a season. In 29races, he had thirteen top10 finishes and onepole position.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, MGM was keen on remaking Grand Hotel (1932), {{and hoped}} to lure Grant into {{coming out of}} {{retirement}} to star. Hitchcock had long {{wanted to make a}} film based on the idea of Hamlet, with Grant in the lead role. Grant stated that Warren Beatty had made a big effort to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> {{to play the role of}} Mr. Jordan in Heaven Can Wait (1978), which eventually went to James Mason. Morecambe and Stirling claim that Grant had also expressed an interest in appearing in A Touch of Class (1973), The Verdict (1982) and a film adaptation of William Goldman's 1983 novel Adventures in the Screen Trade.|$|E

Roy picks up his last paycheck, apologizes to Jim for threatening him during their previous encounter, and asks Pam to join him for coffee.

In Sweet Thursday, Doc {{returns from}} the war to find Cannery Row almost deserted {{and many of his}} {{colorful}} friends gone. Even his close friend Dora, who ran the Bear Flag Restaurant, a whorehouse, has died, and her sister Fauna has taken her place as madam. A former social worker, Fauna teaches the girls how to set a table properly, hopeful they will marry wealthy men. Doc's friends Mack (Mac in Pipe Dream) and Hazel (both men) are still around. They decide Doc's discontent is due to loneliness, and <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> together with Suzy, a prostitute who has just arrived in Monterey. The two have a brief romance; disgusted by her life as a hooker, Suzy leaves the bawdy house and moves into an abandoned boiler. She decides she cannot stay with Doc, but tells her friends that if Doc fell ill, she would care for him. The accommodating Hazel promptly breaks Doc's arm as he sleeps, bringing the two lovers back together. At the end, Doc and Suzy go off to La Jolla to collect marine specimens together.|$|E
5|$|Headley's {{success for}} Dudley was watched keenly in Jamaica and {{commentators}} began {{to discuss his}} availability for the 1954 series against England. A public subscription to finance his travel to Jamaica, opened by the Daily Gleaner, raised over £1,000, and despite his reservations, Headley returned to Jamaica. Playing in a fund-raising match, he sustained a hand injury and playing for the Combined Parishes in a minor match against the MCC, a short ball from Fred Trueman struck Headley's arm. The latter injury {{kept him out of}} the first-class match between Jamaica and the MCC, but he played in the second where, although hampered by his injury, he scored 53 not out. The Test selectors had seen enough to include Headley in the team for the first Test. Reaction among critics was mixed, and Headley, nearing his 45th birthday, remains the oldest man as of 2015 to play a Test match for West Indies. Headley batted at number six, and it appeared that England, under the captaincy of Len Hutton, let Headley score an easy run to begin his innings, which Hutton later confirmed to be the case. However, Headley later argued that the run was given to ensure that he was batting {{at the beginning of the}} next over, so that England could <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> out before he settled down.|$|E

25|$|The {{team made}} a huge effort for the next 12 hours to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> down the mountain, but to no avail, as they were {{unsuccessful}} in getting him through the difficult sections. Even for the able, the Everest North-East ridge is recognised as a challenge. It is hard to rescue someone who has become incapacitated {{and it can be}} beyond the ability of rescuers to save anyone in such a difficult spot. One way around this situation was pioneered by two Nepali men in 2013, who had intended to paraglide off the summit. They had no choice and were forced to go through with their plan anyway, because they had run out of bottled oxygen and supplies. They successfully launched off the summit and para-glided down to Namche in just 42 minutes, without having to climb down the mountain.|$|E

25|$|Ben-Gal {{described}} {{the battle to}} Eitan {{and told him he}} was not sure he could hold on. Eitan asked him to hold on for another half-hour. At this point, the remaining eleven tanks of the Barak Brigade arrived, and Eitan directed them to Ben-Gal. Eitan told Ben-Gal of Ben-Hanan's force. Kahalani called Captain Emi Palant, the senior officer behind the ramps, to use a signal flag to get the tank commanders' attention and direct them to the ramp, but waving the flag got no response. Palant fired his machine gun {{at the side of the}} nearest tank to get the commander to look out, and the message was passed. He ran from tank to tank and rapped on their turrets to get their attention before returning to his own tank and starting to move forward. No tank followed. Kahalani heard a sergeant from the 74th Battalion and ordered him to take his position and guard the wadi. The sergeant replied he did not have any shells left. Zamir, who was flanking his position to the south, reported a massive Syrian attack and asked for permission to move the remaining tanks to Zamir's company to a better position slightly to the south. Ben-Gal refused. Kahalani reported that he was unable to control the tanks, which kept drifting to the rear. Ben-Gal said he would <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> more tanks. Kahalani ordered the sergeant to take his place, saying the Syrians would not try to attack if they saw his tank.|$|E

500|$|Sandoval's {{first days}} in the majors were marked by a {{tendency}} to free swing.

[...] "As much as I <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> to be disciplined, it's like caging a lion. He leaves the dugout ready to swing the bat. I literally tell him before every at-bat, 'Swing at a strike.'" [...] Sandoval himself characterized his approach as [...] "See ball, swing."

Shortly after Hemingway won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1954, he told Time magazine that [...] "this {{would be a}} good year to release poets". The poet Archibald MacLeish asked Hemingway in June 1957 to write a letter on Pound's behalf. Hemingway believed Pound was unable to abstain from awkward political statements or from friendships with people like Kasper, but he signed a letter of support anyway and pledged $1,500 to be given to Pound when he was released. In an interview for the Paris Review in early 1958, Hemingway said that Kasper should be jailed and Pound [...] released. Kasper was eventually jailed, for inciting a riot in connection with the Hattie Cotton School in Nashville, targeted because a black girl had registered as a student. He was also questioned relating to the bombing of the school.|$|E
500|$|On {{the morning}} of 19 November, the ECMM became aware that {{organised}} resistance had ceased in Vukovar, {{but it did not}} receive any information on the fate of the hospital patients. Consequently, the head of the ECMM, ambassador Dirk Jan van Houten, contacted Rašeta asking him to intervene on the ECMM's behalf. That day, a JNA unit arrived at the hospital and Bosanac was taken to meet JNA Colonel Mile Mrkšić. According to Bosanac, Mrkšić told her that he was not obligated by the evacuation agreement. Even though the ICRC was not granted access to Vukovar by JNA officers at the scene, in the early evening of 19 November, ICRC representative Nicolas Borsinger managed to reach the hospital claiming he had an appointment with [...] "a general". Once there, Borsinger found a JNA captain in charge of the facility who agreed to grant the ICRC access. Borsinger then rejoined the ICRC convoy that was moving towards the hospital to evacuate it. The hospital was also toured by French reporter Agnès Vahramian that day, and there she recorded an interview with Jean-Michel Nicolier, a wounded Frenchman who fought alongside Croatian forces in Vukovar. Vahramian offered Nicolier a press pass to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> out of the city, but he refused.|$|E

500|$|The British Prime Minister went to HMS Tiger in a belligerent mindset. Wilson's {{political}} secretary Marcia Falkender {{later wrote}} of [...] "apartheid... on that ship", with the British and Rhodesian delegations separated in all activities outside {{the conference room}} at Wilson's orders. Despite the uneasy atmosphere—accounts from both sides describe Wilson dealing with the Rhodesians extremely tersely—talks progressed relatively smoothly until the subject turned to {{the manner of the}} transition. Wilson insisted on the abandonment of the 1965 constitution, the dissolution of the post-UDI government in favour of a [...] "broad-based" [...] multiracial interim administration and a period under a British Governor, conditions that Smith saw as tantamount to surrender, particularly as the British proposed to draft and introduce the new constitution only after a fresh test of opinion under UK control. When Smith asserted on 3 December that he could not settle without first consulting his Cabinet in Salisbury, Wilson was enraged, declaring that a central condition of the summit had been that he and Smith would have plenipotentiary powers to make a deal. According to JRT Wood, Wilson and his Attorney General Sir Elwyn Jones then [...] "bullied Smith for two long days" [...] to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> to settle, without success.|$|E
500|$|During 2007 spring practice, Scott {{was third}} on the depth chart, but {{suffered}} a left knee injury, which forced him to miss most of camp. During the 2007 season, he played in nine games as a reserve tailback behind Lance Ball and Keon Lattimore and as a kickoff returner. Despite the team's abundance of running backs, Friedgen wanted to utilize Scott in some capacity because of his speed, which had been recorded at 4.25seconds in the 40-yard dash. Maryland wide receiver Darrius Heyward-Bey said, [...] "On paper it says I'm faster, but Da'Rel, he's just {{a different type of}} animal." [...] Against Wake Forest, he saw his first action when he returned four kickoffs for 101yards. Scott's special teams performance in that game sufficiently impressed head coach Friedgen that he said, [...] "I think I've got to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> involved within the offense. I think he's a guy that can make some plays for us." [...] The following week, unranked Maryland upset 10th-ranked Rutgers, and Scott made his first career appearance as a tailback. He had three carries for 29yards. After sitting out the Georgia Tech game because of an ankle injury, he returned four kicks for 68yards against Virginia, three for 56yards against Clemson, and two for 40yards against North Carolina. Against eighth-ranked Boston College, Scott caught a short screen pass from quarterback Chris Turner and ran 57yards for a touchdown. It was his first career reception and first career touchdown. It was one of just two offensive plays for Scott in that game, and incidentally, he was not intended to be in it. Friedgen said:"When he was in the game, I didn't even know he was in the game. I called a screen pass. I looked up, and it was Da'Rel in there. I figured we were just giving Lance a rest, but I asked [...] Zacharias about it Sunday and he started laughing. I said 'Did you put Da'Rel in for that screen pass?' He said, 'Lance's equipment was broken, so he had to go in the game.'" ...|$|E

Hannam was not impressed, especially since any information gleaned would relate to dead patients. He, and the Attorney-General, Sir Reginald Manningham-Buller (who prosecuted all cases of poisoning), wrote to the BMA secretary, Dr Macrae, [...] "to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> to remove the ban". The impasse continued until on 8 November Manningham-Buller met with Macrae to convince him {{of the importance of the}} case. During this meeting, in a highly unusual move, he passed Hannam's confidential 187-page report on Adams to Macrae. Macrae took the report to the President of the BMA and returned it the next day. In all likelihood, he also copied it and passed it on to the defence. Convinced of the seriousness of the accusations, Macrae dropped his opposition to doctors talking to the police. In the end two Eastbourne doctors gave evidence to the police.|$|E
