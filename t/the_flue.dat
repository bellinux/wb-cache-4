5|$|In Virginia, the Marcellus ore {{occasionally}} contained zinc, {{which produced}} a characteristic green flame in the furnace {{as it was}} consumed, but deposited a hard mass of impure zinc oxide known as cadmia, which built up over time {{near the top of}} <b>the</b> <b>flue,</b> and had to be removed periodically to keep it unobstructed.|$|E
5|$|The {{reduction}} of sulphur emissions {{had been an}} important factor since the station was in the design stages, as {{it was one of}} the main worries of those who protested the construction of the station. The London Power Company began developing an experimental technique for washing <b>the</b> <b>flue</b> gases in 1925. It used water and alkaline sprays over scrubbers of steel and timber in <b>the</b> <b>flue</b> ducts. The gases were subject to continuous washing, and with the presence of the catalyst iron oxide, sulphur dioxide was converted into sulphuric acid. Battersea Power Station was one of the first commercial applications of this technique in the world. This method of washing was stopped in the B Station in the 1960s, when it was discovered that the discharge of these products into the Thames was more harmful to the river than the gases would be to the atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Vanadium occurs {{naturally}} in about 65 different minerals and in fossil fuel deposits. It {{is produced in}} China and Russia from steel smelter slag; other countries produce it either from <b>the</b> <b>flue</b> dust of heavy oil, or as a byproduct of uranium mining. It is mainly used to produce specialty steel alloys such as high-speed tool steels. The most important industrial vanadium compound, vanadium pentoxide, {{is used as a}} catalyst for the production of sulfuric acid.|$|E
5|$|Those {{tending the}} {{furnaces}} were {{unaware that the}} heat from the fires had melted the copper lining of <b>the</b> <b>flues</b> and started a chimney fire. With the doors of the furnaces open, more oxygen was drawn into the furnaces, which ensured the fire burned more fiercely, and the flames driven further up <b>the</b> <b>flues</b> than they should have been. <b>The</b> <b>flues</b> had been weakened over time by having footholds cut in them by the child chimney sweeps. Although these footholds would have been repaired as the child exited on finishing the cleaning, the fabric of the chimney was still weakened by the action. In October 1834 the chimneys had not yet had their annual sweep, and a considerable amount of clinker had built up inside <b>the</b> <b>flues.</b>|$|R

5|$|The Romans {{produced}} considerable {{quantities of}} brass (an alloy of zinc and copper) {{as early as}} 200 BC by a cementation process where copper was reacted with zinc oxide. The zinc oxide {{is thought to have}} been produced by heating zinc ore in a shaft furnace. This liberated metallic zinc as a vapor, which then ascended <b>the</b> <b>flue</b> and condensed as the oxide. This process was described by Dioscorides in the 1st century AD. Zinc oxide has also been recovered from zinc mines at Zawar in India, dating from {{the second half of the}} first millennium BC. This was presumably also made in the same way and used to produce brass.|$|E
5|$|The {{museum is}} the largest {{repository}} of rail relics in North and South Carolina and averages 80,000 visitors annually. About three-thousand people were employed to repair the trains at the Spencer Shops {{in the first half}} of the twentieth-century. <b>The</b> <b>Flue</b> Shop, where all the flues for steam engines were formerly produced, has become the Bumper To Bumper exhibit, featuring vintage and antique cars. These include: several Model Ts, a Model A, and even a Ford Model R (the 1907 predecessor to the Model T). A Highway Patrol car from 1935, a Divco Milk Truck, a Lincoln Continental and others are also part of the museum's collection.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the project}} being split into two phases, it was decided for {{efficiency}} to design each phase as mirror image halves of one complete station with only the handful of items the whole site would share (like <b>the</b> <b>flue</b> stack and coal handling area) and so needed to be build in First Half, being the difference. This extended to seeking the same contractors and suppliers as worked on First Half for Completion. Unfortunately due to the decade timespan between comparable works on the 2 phases several manufacturers that had supplied First Half had merged or ceased trading, combined with changes in legislation, this meant numerous components and equipment ranges used for First Half were either no longer available for Completion or had significantly changed. Separately, operating experience over that timespan had led to design improvement in equipment and plant specified by the Board, leading to a few significant areas of the design of Completion being altered.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> two <b>flue</b> harpoon was <b>the</b> primary weapon used in whaling {{around the}} world, but it {{cut through the}} blubber when under stress. This flaw was {{corrected}} {{with the creation of}} <b>the</b> single <b>flue</b> harpoon; by removing one of <b>the</b> <b>flues,</b> <b>the</b> head of the harpoon was narrowed, making it easier for it to penetrate deep enough to hold fast. In the Arctic, the indigenous people used the more advanced toggling harpoon design. In the early 19th century <b>the</b> one <b>flue</b> harpoon was introduced, which reduced failed harpoons due to the head cutting its way out of the body of the whale. In the mid-19th century, the toggling harpoon was adapted by Lewis Temple, using iron. The Temple toggle was widely used, and quickly came to dominate whaling.|$|R
5000|$|During {{the early}} stages of firing, 200 - 900 C water vapor escapes through <b>the</b> <b>flues</b> located on <b>the</b> roof. Once the steam escapes, roof flues can be closed and heat will {{circulate}} the room before escaping from floor vents. This is when the room is heated to at least [...] and the adobe is baked. After the firing, only <b>the</b> ceiling <b>flues</b> are opened to allow slow cooling over at least 48 hours.|$|R
5|$|Gases {{from the}} furnace are cleaned using {{selective}} non-catalytic reduction (SNCR), spray absorbers and active carbon injection. These processes remove nitrogen oxides, acidic gasses, dioxins and heavy metals from the plants emissions. The remaining gases are passed through fine-fabric bag filters to remove and solid particles, {{before it is}} released from the chimney. Each incineration line has its own independent stack in the chimney, and <b>the</b> <b>flue</b> gases are continuously monitored before being released. This information is relayed to the control room. The remaining fly ash from the filters contains particles from the incineration, lime from the spray absorbers, salt and carbon dust, and so is stored in a sealed silo until it is taken from the site for disposal. Incinerator bottom ash left on the incineration grate after the burning is moved by converyor to a bunker. Whilst on the conveyor, a magnet removes ferrous metal from the ash for recycling. The remaining ash is then used as an aggregate in the construction industry.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, {{the problem}} of ammonia levels in the final {{effluent}} was addressed by {{the construction of a}} system using anoxic zones and diffuse air activated sludge treatment. This dramatically reduced ammonia levels, and was the most significant factor in the re-establishment of fish stocks in the lower River Don. In 1990, the outdated filter presshouse and incineration plant were replaced by a new sludge-dewatering plant and a fluidized-bed incinerator. The new plant made the old sludge beds, situated to the east of the River Don and on the island formed by the Don and the Holmes Cut, redundant, and these have now become a nature reserve. Further improvements to the process were completed by 2005. These included an upgrade to the wet scrubbing system, in order to remove heavy metals and acid gases such as sulphur dioxide, hydrogen chloride and hydrogen fluoride from <b>the</b> <b>flue</b> gases produced by the incinerator, and the addition of a tertiary adsorption filter, which removes mercury and dioxins. The improvements were designed to ensure that the plant met the standards set out in the Waste Incineration Directive.|$|E
25|$|The {{effect of}} {{increasing}} dry solids concentration {{has had a}} significant effect on the main operating variables. The steam flow increases with increasing black liquor dry solids content. Increasing closure of the pulp mill means that less heat per unit of black liquor dry solids will be available in the furnace. <b>The</b> <b>flue</b> gas heat loss will decrease as <b>the</b> <b>flue</b> gas flow diminishes. Increasing black liquor dry solids is especially helpful since the recovery boiler capacity is often limited by <b>the</b> <b>flue</b> gas flow.|$|E
50|$|There were, and are, many {{different}} designs of firebox for stationary boilers. In flue-type boilers (e.g. the Lancashire boiler) <b>the</b> <b>flues</b> themselves form <b>the</b> firebox. In water-tube boilers, the firebox {{is usually a}} firebrick-lined compartment below the water tubes.|$|R
50|$|Natural draft: When air or flue gases flow {{due to the}} {{difference}} in density of <b>the</b> hot <b>flue</b> gases and cooler ambient gases. The difference in density creates a pressure differential that moves <b>the</b> hotter <b>flue</b> gases into <b>the</b> cooler surroundings.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> one <b>flue</b> harpoon or one flue iron (sometimes [...] "single" [...] {{instead of}} [...] "one" [...] is used) {{is a type}} of harpoon used in whaling after its {{introduction}} in the early 19th century when it replaced <b>the</b> two <b>flue</b> harpoon. Due to the asymmetric design of the head for which it is named, <b>the</b> one <b>flue</b> harpoon was less likely to cut its way out of the whale meat and blubber, and was therefore more successful in whaling.|$|R

25|$|Incineration has {{a number}} of outputs such as the ash and the {{emission}} to the atmosphere of flue gas. Before <b>the</b> <b>flue</b> gas cleaning system, if installed, <b>the</b> <b>flue</b> gases may contain particulate matter, heavy metals, dioxins, furans, sulfur dioxide, and hydrochloric acid. If plants have inadequate flue gas cleaning, these outputs may add a significant pollution component to stack emissions.|$|E
25|$|The steam {{content in}} <b>the</b> <b>flue</b> may produce visible fume from the stack, {{which can be}} {{perceived}} as a visual pollution. It may be avoided by decreasing the steam content by flue-gas condensation and reheating, or by increasing <b>the</b> <b>flue</b> gas exit temperature well above its dew point. Flue-gas condensation allows the latent heat of vaporization of the water to be recovered, subsequently increasing the thermal efficiency of the plant.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> two <b>flue</b> harpoon or two flue iron (which, {{together}} with <b>the</b> one <b>flue</b> harpoon, {{were known as}} common harpoons) {{is a type of}} harpoon used in whaling for at least 1000 years. It appears in works of art dating back to the 14th century.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} {{is even more}} remarkable. Its 2-story hall features a grand staircase {{at the south end}} that wraps around the fireplace, a hanging balcony suspended by iron rods on the other three sides, and an intricate leaded glass skylight. A favorite visual pun of Furness's was to place a window over a fireplace, splitting <b>the</b> <b>flues</b> into <b>the</b> walls flanking it - as he did at Jefferson Medical College (1875-77) and the parish hall of First Unitarian Church of Philadelphia (1883-86). With the Jayne house's hall he took his punning to an extreme, placing a curved balcony and horseshoe-shaped seating area over the fireplace (accessed from the staircase behind), and splitting <b>the</b> <b>flues</b> into piers that merged above into a tall arch.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the summer}} of 2014, Cloquet Terminal Railroad ended its part in the {{restoration}} process due to management changes. On August 27, 2014, <b>the</b> <b>flues</b> for #28 arrived at the Lake Superior Railroad Museum from Germany. It was then decided that 28 {{would return to the}} Lake Superior Railroad Museum to complete its restoration with the installation of <b>the</b> <b>flues.</b> On February 3, 2015, #28 was moved back to the Lake Superior Railroad Museum via BNSF Railway to complete its restoration. The remainder of the restoration included boiler flue installation, insulation & jacketing, as well as repainting.. By the end of spring 2015, new metalwork had been installed in the smoke-box and outside the cab. The pilot, running gear, and hand-grabs had been painted.|$|R

25|$|The {{quantity}} of pollutants in <b>the</b> <b>flue</b> gas from incineration plants {{may or may}} not be reduced by several processes, depending on the plant.|$|E
25|$|In 1848, Galloways {{patented}} the Galloway tube, a tapered thermic syphon water-tube {{inserted in}} the furnace of a Lancashire boiler. The tubes are tapered, simply to make their installation through <b>the</b> <b>flue</b> easier.|$|E
50|$|Water {{had to be}} run at {{a trickle}} in order to heat up to a {{desirable}} temperature. The rate of combustion was controlled by <b>the</b> <b>flues</b> and <b>the</b> ash box. With lots of fuel and open <b>flues</b> <b>the</b> water could boil quickly, which was not a desirable result. With practice the correct combination of fuel, flue settings and water flow could result in enough hot water for a shower or bath in approximately 20 minutes.|$|R
5000|$|Open flue—An open flued {{appliance}} draws {{combustion air}} from its surroundings; exhaust gases {{rise in a}} vortex up <b>the</b> open <b>flue.</b> <b>The</b> 19th century Rumford fireplace is an appliance that elegantly refined this principle.|$|R
50|$|Considerable {{effort was}} made to {{insulate}} the building, and to extract the maximum amount of heat from <b>the</b> <b>flues</b> from <b>the</b> stove and the heater, based on lessons learned from the Discovery Hut. Terra Nova expeditioners described the hut as being warm {{to the point of being}} uncomfortable.|$|R
25|$|Oxy-fuel {{combustion}} – Fossil fuels such as coal are {{burned in}} a mixture of recirculated flue gas and oxygen, rather than in air, which largely eliminates nitrogen from <b>the</b> <b>flue</b> gas enabling efficient, low-cost CO2 capture.|$|E
25|$|Many cupolas {{had long}} {{horizontal}} flues, which {{were introduced to}} trap pollutants before they could be discharged into the air. Since the pollutants included metal vapour, the sweepings of <b>the</b> <b>flue</b> could also be recovered for resmelting.|$|E
25|$|Flutes can {{be played}} with several {{different}} air sources. Conventional flutes are blown with the mouth, although some cultures use nose flutes. <b>The</b> <b>flue</b> pipes of organs, which are acoustically similar to duct flutes, are blown by bellows or fans.|$|E
50|$|Firetubes are {{attached}} to one wall of the firebox (the front wall for a longitudinal boiler, the top for a vertical boiler) and carry the hot gaseous products of combustion through the boiler water, heating it, before they escape to the atmosphere. Firetubes serve the additional purpose of staying <b>the</b> flat tube (<b>flue)</b> sheets (front and rear) so that only the top of <b>the</b> front <b>flue</b> sheet and <b>the</b> bottom of <b>the</b> rear <b>flue</b> sheet must be separately braced.|$|R
50|$|Cornish boilers {{had several}} {{advantages}} over the preceding wagon boilers: they were composed of mostly curved surfaces, better {{to resist the}} pressure. Their flat ends were smaller than the flat sides of the wagon boiler and were stayed by <b>the</b> central furnace <b>flue,</b> and sometimes by additional long rod stays. A less obvious advantage was that of boiler scale. Wagon or haystack boilers were heated from beneath and any scale or impurities that formed a sediment settled upon this plate, insulating it from the water. This reduced heating efficiency and could in extremis lead to local overheating and failure of the boiler plates. In <b>the</b> <b>flued</b> boiler, any sediment fell past <b>the</b> furnace <b>flue</b> and settled out {{at the bottom of}} the boiler shell, where it had less effect.|$|R
