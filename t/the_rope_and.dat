5|$|As {{with his}} {{previous}} crossings, steamers took the crowds from Circular Quay, although this time only four were needed, while another 600–700 people {{made their own}} way to the site. The ride was scheduled for 3 pm on 23 December, but delays meant L'Estrange did not appear until 6 pm. Although the length of rope was over 182 metres, it was only just over nine metres above the water. The stay wires were held in boats on either side, with the crews rowing against each other to keep it steady. L'Estrange rode his bicycle towards the centre, where, with the rope swinging to and fro, he stopped briefly to steady himself but instead, realising he was losing his balance, {{he was forced to}} leap from <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> <b>and</b> fell into the water below. Although he was unhurt, it was another knock to his reputation. A repeat attempt was announced for the following weekend. Again steamers took a dwindling crowd to Banbury Bay where they found L'Estrange's rope had been mysteriously cut, and he cancelled the performance. The Daily Telegraph reported that many in the crowd, who had paid for tickets on the steamers, felt they had been scammed.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} match, Sensational Sherri stood at ringside as Shawn Michaels defended his Intercontinental Championship against Marty Jannetty. She {{did not reveal}} her {{allegiance}} to either man. Jannetty gained the early advantage, knocking Michaels {{out of the ring}} and diving onto him through the ropes. He then attacked Michaels by jumping off the top rope, but Michaels countering this move by hitting him on the way down. Michaels hit Jannetty's shoulder against the ring post and focused on wearing down the shoulder once both men had re-entered the ring. Michaels missed an attack from the top rope, which allowed Jannetty to punch him repeatedly. Michaels recovered and threw Jannetty out of the ring, but Jannetty then suplexed Michaels over <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> <b>and</b> onto the arena floor. Sherri turned on Michaels by slapping him in the face, and Jannetty threw Michaels back into the ring with a belly-to-back suplex. Jannetty performed a powerslam and a DDT on Michaels. Michaels attempted to punch Jannetty but knocked the referee unconscious instead. Sherri came into the ring and tried to hit Michaels with her shoe. Michaels moved out of the way, and Sherri hit Jannetty instead. When the referee recovered, Michaels performed a superkick on Jannetty and pinned him to retain the championship.|$|E
5|$|Larry Vaughn {{arrives at}} the Brody house before Brody returns home, and informs Ellen {{that he and his}} wife are leaving Amity. Before he leaves, he tells Ellen that he always thought they would have made a great couple. When Brody and Quint return to sea the {{following}} day, the shark starts ramming the boat, but Quint is able to harpoon it several times. The shark leaps out of the water and onto the stern of the Orca, ripping a huge hole in the aft section and causing the boat to begin to sink. Quint plunges another harpoon into the shark, but as it falls back into the water, his foot gets entangled in <b>the</b> <b>rope,</b> <b>and</b> he is dragged underwater to his death as he drowns. Brody, now floating on a seat cushion, spots the shark swimming towards him and prepares for his death. However, just as the shark gets within a few feet of him, it succumbs to its many wounds, rolls over in the water, and dies before it can kill Brody. The great fish sinks down out of sight, dragging Quint's still entangled body behind it. Brody manages to paddle back to shore on his makeshift float, the lone survivor of the ordeal.|$|E

5|$|On the July 25 {{episode of}} Raw, Mysterio won the tournament {{to become the}} new WWE Champion, and {{immediately}} had to fend off Alberto Del Rio {{to prevent him from}} cashing in his Money in the Bank. TripleH, now Chief Operating Officer, decreed that Mysterio was to face ex-champion Cena later that night for the title; Cena won and again became WWE Champion. After the match, Punk made an unannounced return to WWE with the old WWE Championship belt to confront Cena. Cena and Punk later fought in a match at SummerSlam on August 14 to crown the undisputed WWE Champion, which Punk won controversially as Triple H didn't see Cena's leg was on <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> <b>and</b> it was actually a rope break. As Punk celebrated, Kevin Nash made his WWE return and assaulted him. Del Rio then cashed in his Money in the Bank contract and pinned Punk to become the new champion after kicking Punk in the head. Punk regained the WWE Championship from Del Rio at Survivor Series in November 2011; starting a 434-day reign until The Rock beat him at the 2013 Royal Rumble event.|$|E
5|$|Marge and {{the kids}} wake up to find {{themselves}} back in Springfield, now in ruins (except Springfield Elementary School, much to Bart's chagrin). They find Moe Szyslak, who {{is dressed in a}} bathrobe, a traffic cone and bullets and has become self-proclaimed Emperor of Springfield (although his leadership was unsuccessfully challenged by Barney). Just then, Russ Cargill reappears on the giant screen, and announces to the people of Springfield that placing the dome over Springfield was a mistake, and the government has commenced Operation: Soaring Eagle, an ill-named plan which involves killing them all. A helicopter lowers a small but powerful bomb down a rope {{through a hole in the}} dome. While Homer climbs to the top of the dome, the townspeople attempt to climb the rope to escape through the still-opened hole, but Homer slides down <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> <b>and</b> knocks them off along with the bomb. After reconciling with Bart, Homer drives a motorcycle along the dome, inspired by the earlier carnival attraction. As a passenger of the motorcycle, Bart throws the bomb through the hole; seconds later it detonates, shattering the dome and freeing the town. Cargill arrives personally and prepares to shoot Homer with a shotgun, but Maggie knocks him unconscious with a boulder. The town finally praises and forgives Homer, who rides into the sun rise with Marge and Maggie, whereupon the townspeople restore Springfield to normal. As a symbol of their gratitude, the Simpsons and their friends begin to rebuild the family's house.|$|E

25|$|On {{the evening}} of 23 June, a platoon led by Varinder Singh {{set out to find}} the rope fixed by Pande's patrol. The bad weather slowed down the group: it could travel only 1km in four hours, in waist-deep snow. Due to heavy snowfall, the team could not find <b>the</b> <b>rope,</b> <b>and</b> retreated to the base.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} the ritual, {{the corpse}} is freed from his bondage of rope and bathed again. The corpse is buried or {{immersed}} in a body of water.

25|$|Autosacrifice was {{not limited}} to male rulers, as their female {{counterparts}} often performed these ritualized activities.

25|$|The king's tent {{was next}} to the woods and was under the {{branches}} of a tall tree for shade. When Agne was fast asleep, Skjalf took a rope which she attached to the torc. Then she had her men remove the tent, and she threw the rope over a bough. Then she told her men to pull <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> <b>and</b> they hanged Agne avenging Skjalf's father. Skjalf and her men ran to the ships and escaped to Finland, leaving her sons behind.|$|E
25|$|The second {{match was}} between Sting and Lex Luger. Sting gained the early advantage, and {{performed}} a diving crossbody. Sting attempted another diving crossbody, but Luger caught him, and performed an inverted atomic drop. Luger had the advantage, and they fought outside the ring. As both {{were on the}} apron, Luger pulled them both over the top rope and into the ring. Luger fell on top of Sting, and pinned him while holding <b>the</b> <b>rope,</b> <b>and</b> having {{his foot on the}} rope.|$|E

25|$|The {{technical}} {{rules for the}} Japanese version of men's rhythmic gymnastics came around the 1970s. For individuals, only four types of apparatus are used: the double rings, the stick, <b>the</b> <b>rope,</b> <b>and</b> the clubs. Groups do not use any apparatus. The Japanese version includes tumbling performed on a spring floor. Points are awarded based a 10-point scale that measures {{the level of difficulty}} of the tumbling and apparatus handling. On November 27–29, 2003, Japan hosted first edition of the Men's Rhythmic Gymnastics World Championship.|$|E
25|$|Survival for sponges farmed on ropes is {{generally}} lower as unrecoverable damage occurs to the explant when ‘threading’ onto the rope takes place. Furthermore, sponges cultured {{on the rope}} {{have the potential to}} be torn off the rope during storms as water flow increases significantly, or grow away from <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> <b>and</b> form an unmarketable, low value, characteristic doughnut shaped sponge. Differences in sponge growth and health do occur within species characterised by variations in regenerative ability, susceptibility to infection after cutting, hardiness and growth potential.|$|E
25|$|When {{the nearby}} village of Desertmartin held the county court of County Coleraine, all those {{condemned}} to die were executed or {{hung from a}} stone that projected out over {{the door of the}} old Kilcronaghan parish church. This stone had a gutter cut to embrace <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> <b>and</b> prevent it from slipping from the stone during an execution. During the rebellion of 1641, in which Phelim O'Neill was engaged, and even in subsequent periods, the old Kilcronaghan parish church was still the scene of executions. The hanging stone was in 1806 built into the new church.|$|E

25|$|At 1615 hrs Teti {{returned}} to sea and sighted an exhausted {{man in the}} water and covered with fuel oil. Caffery dived into the sea and supported the man, and Tetis crew threw them a lifebuoy on a line. The sea was tossing Teti so violently that her crew could not haul the two men aboard, so she towed them to calmer water inside the mole. Tetis engineer, Fanciulli, tried to haul the men aboard but because of the oil they kept slipping from his grasp. The tug India came to assist. Her Captain, Ragone, passed a rope around the two men, and Teti took <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> <b>and</b> towed the two men ashore.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{accident}} Whymper asked Taugwalder to see <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> <b>and</b> to his surprise he {{saw that it was}} the oldest and weakest of the ropes they brought and it was only intended as a reserve. All those who had fallen had been tied with a Manila rope, or with a second and equally strong one, and consequently it had been only between the survivors and those who had fallen where the weaker rope had been used. Whymper also had suggested to Hudson that they should have attached a rope to the rocks on the most difficult place, and held it as they descended, as an additional protection. Hudson approved the idea, but it was never done.|$|E
25|$|The {{eleventh}} {{match of}} the event was a Texas Lariat match between Lex Luger and Stan Hansen for the NWA United States Heavyweight Championship. The match started back and forth until they fought outside the ring, and Hansen gained the advantage {{with the use of}} the guard rail and a steel chair. Hansen performed a belly to back suplex, and hung Luger with the rope over the top rope. Luger fought back, and pulled Hansen into the ringpost. After performing leg drops, Luger touched three of the turnbuckles. Both Hansen and Luger pulled <b>the</b> <b>rope,</b> <b>and</b> Luger was sent into the fourth turnbuckle. He also knocked down the referee, and Hansen attacked Luger with his boot. A replacement referee came down, and Hansen touched all four turnbuckles. Hansen was declared the winner, but the original referee revived and declared Luger the winner of the match and the title.|$|E
