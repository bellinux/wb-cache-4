5|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{opponents of the}} Bedell plan had a very {{different}} view of this legislation. Representatives such as Pat Roberts claimed that the referendum was redundant because the farmers already voted the politicians into office, and this bill {{was an example of}} the politicians not doing their jobs. The Reagan Administration opposed the bill because of their opposition to production controls, and the President threatened to veto <b>the</b> <b>farm</b> <b>bill</b> if Bedell's plan was left in place. When the bill got to the floor, an amendment was proposed to strike this provision, and it was passed 251-174.|$|E

2500|$|The New Deal era farm {{programs}} were {{continued into the}} 1940s and 1950s, {{with the goal of}} supporting the prices received by farmers. [...] Typical programs involved farm loans, commodity subsidies, and price supports. [...] The rapid decline in the farm population [...] led to a smaller voice in Congress. [...] So the well-organized Farm Bureau and other lobbyists, worked in the 1970s to appeal to urban Congressman through [...] food stamp programs for the poor. By 2000, the food stamp program was the largest component of <b>the</b> <b>farm</b> <b>bill.</b> In 2010, the Tea Party movement brought in many Republicans committed to cutting all federal subsidies, including those agriculture. Meanwhile, urban Democrats strongly opposed reductions, [...] pointing to the severe hardships caused by the 2008-10 economic recession. The Agricultural Act of 2014 saw many rural Republican Congressman voting against the program despite its support from farmers; it passed with urban support.|$|E
