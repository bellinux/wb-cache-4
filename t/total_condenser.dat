50|$|Orange oxide was {{received}} from the Refinery in five-ton mobile hoppers, which were mounted on seal hoppers to feed the reduction furnace {{at a rate of}} approximately 375 pounds per hour for producing metal grade UF4. The powder was agitated and carried through the reduction furnace by a ribbon flight screw. Dissociated ammonia was metered to the reduction reactors and passed counter-currently to the bed of uranium oxide within the chemical reactor. The off-gases from the reduction reactors were passed to a hydrogen burner where the excess hydrogen was burned and then passed through a dust collector to remove any entrained uranium dioxide that might have been present. The UO2 in the reduction furnace passed through a seal hopper and a feed screw to the first of the three hydrofluorination furnaces. The bed of UO2 was moved through the hydrofluorination furnace by ribbon flight screws and contacted counter-currently by hydrofluoric acid vapors. The UF4 was removed from the third furnace and conveyed to a packaging station where the product was packaged in 10-gallon pails for use in the Metal Plant, or in 5-ton containers for shipment to the cascades. The off-gases containing water vapor formed in the reaction and excess hydrofluoric acid was removed from the first furnace and were sent to hydrofluoric acid recovery. The gases first passed to a partial condenser that removed all of the water in the form of 70% aqueous hydrofluoric acid. The remainder of the gases was then passed to a <b>total</b> <b>condenser,</b> which condenses the remainder of the acid as anhydrous hydrofluoric acid. The gases at this point contain only the nitrogen from seals and purge gases and small amounts of hydrofluoric acid that did not condense in the <b>total</b> <b>condenser.</b> These were passed through potassium hydroxide scrubbers to remove the last traces of acid and then discharged to the atmosphere.|$|E

According to the economical data obtained in the present study, {{it has been shown}} that the <b>total</b> <b>condenser</b> cost components: steam generation, brine water pumping, and fixed charge contribution nearly as 83 %, 6 %, and 11 % respectively according to the fuel cost. However the calculated cost is closed to the known ordinary values when the calculations are based on the minimum variable condenser cost [1] (About 55 % for steam cost, 10 % for pumping cost, and 35 % for the fixed cost). As for the effect of some technical parameters, {{it has been shown that}}: (i) <b>total</b> <b>condenser</b> cost is nearly independent of the tube diameter (ii) total cost depends weakly on the brine velocity, and more strongly on the brine flow rate. The plant fouling condition is of prime importance and should not exceed the design values; otherwise it can lead to increase of 126 % of the <b>total</b> <b>condenser</b> cost if the fouling factor increased to 0. 05 m 2 o C/W. From heat transfer point of view, the effect of the different tube material used in desalination, has a slack effect on the <b>total</b> <b>condenser</b> cost (0. 055 – 0. 02 %).

40|$|This {{dissertation}} details research {{aimed at}} designing a small batch distillation column to purify tetrafluoroethylene and hexafluoropropylene from a mixture containing tetrafluoroethylene, hexafluoropropylene and octafluorocyclobutane. As no vapour-liquid equilibrium {{data are available}} for these chemicals in this mixture, new vapour-liquid equilibrium data were experimentally generated and modelled {{for use in the}} design of the batch distillation column. The data were fitted to the Peng-Robinson equation of state, utilizing the Mathias-Copeman alpha function. The model was used with the Wong- Sandler mixing rules alongside the NRTL alpha function. The model was fitted with mean relative deviations lower than 1. 2 %, indicating an acceptably accurate description of the VLE data gathered by the model. The experimental data and the model also passed the thermodynamic consistency test for all the systems and isotherms. The design simulations were completed by means of the Aspen Batch Distillation, a module of the Aspen Technologies package. The results show that the optimum design for recovering high-purity products requires six equilibrium stages in the column. The batch column should consist of a still pot, also functioning as a reboiler, a packed column section and a <b>total</b> <b>condenser.</b> The <b>total</b> <b>condenser</b> and the reboiler both count as equilibrium stages. Using this design, a TFE product purity of 99. 999 % is predicted with a recovery of 96 %. An HFP product purity of 99 % is predicted at a recovery of 68 %. The recovery of the HFP product can be increased, but entails a significant loss of product purity. The minimum column diameter required to achieve the flow rates suggested in the simulation is 29 mm. The column diameter was selectedas 1 ¼ ″ (or 31. 75 mm) on the basis of the standard pipe diameters available in the industry. Pall ring packing is suggested for use in the column, with an estimated maximum HETP of 0. 5 m. As there are five equilibrium stages in the column itself, the column has to be at least 2. 5 m high.

40|$|In {{programs}} such as BLAST and DOE– 2, the Double Bundle Electric Chiller model uses fixed input values for determining the recoverable heat component. The drawback {{of this approach is}} no dependence on system demands, plant, and cooling tower loads. Determining the availability or gradation (quality of heat) of the recoverable heat, is a subjective user input, and independent of the flow rates and temperatures. In a program like EnergyPlus, the plant and heat recovery equipment is now connected with loops having mass flow rates and temperatures, allowing for a more sophisticated simulation. Execution speed still restricts the chiller simulation to empirical models that give the <b>total</b> <b>condenser</b> heat as an output for the cooling tower and heat recovery loops. A new algorithm that bases the recoverable heat fraction on the flow rates and inlet temperatures has been developed. This algorithm uses relatively simple inputs to determine the fraction of the heat recovered and the heat rejected by the cooling tower. The variations in the mass flow rates and temperatures in the simulation are now used to obtain more realistic heat transfer rates of each component. This paper presents an analysis of the new algorithm for determining the heat recovery factor, and presents examples showing its performance and advantages of this model over the simple model. The electric chiller in EnergyPlus now has the option of having its condenser hooked up to a heat recovery loop, or what is commonly known as a double bundled chiller...|$|E

The results showed that the <b>total</b> phenolics, extractable <b>condensed</b> tannins, <b>total</b> <b>condensed</b> tannins, protein-precipitable phenolics content and protein precipitation capacity in young leaves were higher than those in mature and senescent leaves.

40|$|Due to {{environmental}} concerns, several refrigerants currently {{used by the}} air-conditioning and refrigeration industry {{are expected to be}} gradually phased-out {{by the turn of the}} century. Possible ozone-safe replacement refrigerants such as R- 134 a are being tested to determine their heat transfer and pressure drop characteristics. A computer simulation modeling a typical air-cooled condenser was developed with the goal of providing a faster and less costly alternative to experimental testing. It consists of dividing the <b>total</b> <b>condenser</b> length into an arbitrary number of modules and solving the residual equations obtained from momentum and energy balances on those modules. Existing correlations are used to calculate refrigerant heat transfer coefficients and pressure drop. Air side heat transfer coefficients are evaluated with a correlation developed from experimental data. The input parameters include the condenser's geometric dimensions as well as air and refrigerant inlet conditions. The total capacity and refrigerant pressure drop are calculated, in addition to the length of tube occupied by superheated, condensing and sub-cooled refrigerant. The simulation was validated with an experimental test matrix covering a wide range of conditions. The difference between the calculated and the experimental capacities was within 25 % for all test conditions, and within 10 % for 86 % of them. The larger discrepancies were observed at low air flow rates, suggesting possible experimental errors due to air stratification. The calculated pressure drops were not in agreement with the experimental results, and further testing of the two-phase. refrigerant correlations used is required.

40|$|Thermodynamic {{analysis}} {{provides the}} column grand composite curves and exergy loss profiles, which are becoming readily {{available for a}} converged distillation column simulation. For example, the Aspen Plus simulator performs the thermodynamic analysis through its Column–Targeting tool for rigorous column calculations. This study uses the column grand composite curves and the exergy loss profiles obtained from Aspen Plus to assess {{the performance of the}} existing distillation columns, and reduce the costs of operation by appropriate retrofits in a methanol plant. Effectiveness of the retrofits is also assessed by means of thermodynamics and economics. The methanol plant utilizes two distillation columns to purify the methanol in its separation Section. The first column operates with 51 stages, has a side heat stream to the last stage, a partial condenser at the top and a side condenser at stage 2, and no reboiler. The second column operates with 95 stages, has a side heat stream to stage 95, a <b>total</b> <b>condenser,</b> and high reflux ratio. Despite the heat integration of the columns with the other Sections and a side condenser in column 1, the assessment of converged base case simulations have indicated the need for more profitable operations, and the required retrofits are suggested. For the first column, the retrofits consisting of a feed preheating and a second side condenser at stage 4 have reduced the total exergy loss by 21. 5 %. For the second column, the retrofits of two side reboilers at stages 87 and 92 have reduced the total exergy loss by 41. 3 %. After the retrofits, the thermodynamic efficiency has increased to 55. 4 % from 50. 6 % for the first column, while it has increased to 6. 7 % from 4. 0 % for the second. The suggested retrofits have reduced the exergy losses and hence the cost of energy considerably, and proved to be more profitable despite the fixed capital costs of retrofits for the distillation columns of the methanol plant...|$|E
40|$|The {{combination}} of multi-stage heat pump cycles with small-scale oil-free turbocompressor technology running on gas bearings {{could be a}} promising way to increase performance in domestic and commercial heat pumps. This paper presents a novel two-stage heat pump system with two heat sources at two different temperature levels using two separate turbocompressors rotating on gas bearings optimized for R 134 a. The system allows integration of unused heat sources, e. g. solar thermal or waste heat, into heat production with a minimal loss of exergy. The cycle comprises an evaporator for the first heat source, a condenser as heat sink, an open economizer with integrated heat exchanger for the second heat source, and a tube-in-tube suction line heat exchanger (SHX) in the high-pressure for superheating and subcooling. The {{aim of this study}} is to evaluate theoretically the performance of this heat pump cycle using a system model programmed in the software EES (Engineering Equations Solver). The simulation assumes steady-state, negligible pressure drops and heat losses, and adiabatic expansion processes. The superheating in the evaporator and the SHX is 5 Â°C, and there is no subcooling in the condenser. The heat exchangers are modeled using effectiveness-NTU models. At the design point, the heating capacity of the condenser is set to 6. 5 kW and provides hot water of 55 Â°C. The first heat source is brine of 5 Â°C. The second heat source is water of 30 Â°C and has been designed to provide up to 30 % of the <b>total</b> <b>condenser</b> heat capacity. The two turbocompressors are designed specifically to meet the heat pump design point. Presently, one-dimensional (1 D) compressor maps are used in the heat pump model. Simulation results show that coefficient of performance (COP) improvements of 20 % to 30 % are achievable, depending on the source temperature levels of the heat pump cycle and the amount of second heat source added to the system. The COP increases with higher source temperatures, higher second heat source capacity, and lower sink temperature. The pressure ratios are defined by the imposed temperature levels. The mass flow rate of the refrigerant in the first stage is mainly determined by the second heat source capacity, and in the second stage by the heat capacity of the condenser. In future work, this novel heat pump concept will be tested experimentally...|$|E

40|$|Despite {{a growing}} {{knowledge}} of nutrient limitation for mangrove species and how mangroves adapt to low nutrients, there is scant {{information about the}} relative importance of N:P ratio and leaf phenolics variability in determining nutrient conservation. In this study, we evaluated possible nutrient conservation strategies of a mangrove Rhizophora stylosa under nutrient limitation. 1. The leaf nutrient concentrations of R. stylosa changed with season, with the highest N concentration in winter and the highest P concentration in spring for both mature and senescent leaves. Leaf N and P concentrations decreased significantly during leaf senescence. Based on N:P ratios R. stylosa forest was N-limited. Accordingly, the nitrogen resorption efficiency (NRE) was significantly higher than phosphorus resorption efficiency (PRE) for the R. stylosa leaves during leaf senescence. The NRE and PRE both reached the highest in the autumn. Average N and P concentrations in the senescent leaves were 0. 15 % and 0. 06 % for R. stylosa, respectively, indicating a complete resorption of N and an incomplete resorption of P. There was a significant negative correlation between nitrogen resorption proficiency (NRP) and NRE, meanwhile phosphorus resorption proficiency (PRP) and PRE correlation was also highly significantly. 2. R. stylosa leaves contained relatively high tannin level. <b>Total</b> phenolics, extractable <b>condensed</b> tannins and <b>total</b> <b>condensed</b> tannins contents increased during leaf senescence, and changed between seasons. The lowest concentrations of <b>total</b> phenolics, extractable <b>condensed</b> tannins and <b>total</b> <b>condensed</b> tannins occurred in summer, total phenolics concentrations were inversely related to nitrogen or phosphorus concentrations. 3.

In addition, nitrogen contents of branchlets at the different developmental stages were also determined. The contents of TP and ECT, and PPC in young branchlets {{were significantly higher}} than those in mature and senescent branchlets through the season. However, PBCT contents were significantly higher in senescent branchlets than those in young and mature branchlets; FBCT fluctuated with season. Young branchlets had the highest N content, which decreased during branch maturity and senescence. The highest contents of TP and the lowest contents of TCT and N in young and mature branchlets were observed in summer. There was a significant negative correlation between TP and N contents.

40|$|Associated with {{biofuels}} {{production from}} plant sources, there is generation of several byproducts suitable {{to use in}} animal nutrition, which requires careful study for wide and safe applicability. Crambe meal is a byproduct still poorly understood and {{studies are needed to}} better assess their nutritional potential. In this context, the present study was carried out with the aim of measuring the chemical groups of interest (nutrients and antinutrients) and in vitro protein digestibility of crambe meal in nature and reduced antinutrients forms. For removal antinutrients were applied acidic (adding concentrated sulfuric acid to water until pH 1. 0) and alcoholic (commercial ethanol 92. 8 º) solutions on in nature meal. The results showed that chemical treatment increased the fiber and ash content and reduced the crude protein, amino acids, fat, calcium and phosphorus content as well as phenolic compounds, tannins (<b>total,</b> <b>condensed</b> and hydrolysable) and phytic acid. Although the chemical treatment has changed the balance of the constituents of most of nutritional interest, its effect was not observed in in vitro protein digestibility. The nutritional and antinutritional character obtained for this meal can collaborate in indicative of an alternative protein source for animal nutrition. ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{in vitro}} gas {{production}} of some semi-arid browse species were evaluated. The relationship between in vitro gas measured on incubation of tannin-containing browses in buffered rumen fluid and calculated from short chain fatty acid (SCFA) production was investigated. Crude protein (CP) contents in the browses ranged from 13. 85 to 16. 65 % dry matter (DM). The NDF, ADF and ADL were 37. 30 to 51. 20, 16. 20 to 41. 90 and 4. 90 to 12. 70 g/ 100 g DM respectively. <b>Total</b> <b>condensed</b> tannin (TCT) ranged from 0. 15 to 0. 39 mg/g DM.

The Nevzorov probe measured liquid water (LWC) and <b>total</b> <b>condensed</b> water content (TWC) in supercooled liquid and partly mixed phase clouds, respectively. As for other hotwire probes the calculation of LWC and/or TWC (and thus the ice water content IWC) has {{to take into account}} the collection efficiencies of the two separate sensors for LWC and TWC which both react differently with respect to cloud phase and what is even more difficult to quantify with respect to the size of ice and liquid cloud particles. The study demonstrates that during pure liquid cloud sequences the ASTAR data set of the Nevzorov probe allowed to improve the quantification of the collection efficiency, particularly of the LWC probe part with respect to water. The improved quantification of liquid water content should lead to improved retrievals of IWC content.
