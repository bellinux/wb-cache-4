5|$|With Caen {{north of}} the River Orne in Allied hands, mine-clearance {{operations}} were launched, bulldozers were set to work to clear the streets and a convoy of trucks carrying supplies for the civilian population was brought in.

5|$|Kalimpong is also {{famous for}} their rich {{practice}} of cactus cultivation. Its nurseries attract people from far and wide for the absolutely stunning collection of cacti they cultivate. <b>The</b> <b>strains</b> <b>of</b> cacti, though not indigenous to the locale, have been carefully cultivated over the years, and now the town boasts {{one of the most}} fascinating and exhaustive collections of the Cactaceae family. The plants have adapted well to the altitude and environment, and now prove {{to be one of the}} chief draws of tourism to the township.|$|E
5|$|After {{dreaming of}} {{spectacular}} horrors, Houdini awakens {{at the bottom}} of the pit and eventually manages to free himself from the ropes. Suspecting that he is somewhere in a temple under the Great Sphinx of Giza, he travels through the dark in an attempt to find an exit, following what he believes to be a draft from outdoors. Instead, he discovers that he has actually been heading further underground, eventually falling down a flight of stairs and landing in a large ceremonial cavern. There he witnesses an army of half-man, half-animal mummies, led by the ancient Egyptian pharaohs Khephren and Nitokris, leaving offerings to a hippopotamus-sized, five-headed, tentacled beast that appears from a hole deep in the hall. As he escapes, he realizes that this creature is merely the paw of a much larger deity in whose image the Sphinx was carved. Houdini dismisses the events as a hallucination or a dream consequent of <b>the</b> <b>strains</b> <b>of</b> his kidnapping ordeal, despite the resemblance he sees between Khephren and his guide, Drogman.|$|E

30|$|Based on the {{experimental}} results, {{this study also}} investigates the relationship between <b>the</b> <b>strain</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stirrup and the peak maximum shear crack for each shear-span to depth ratio. <b>The</b> yielding <b>strain</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stirrup that corresponds to the peak maximum shear crack width is then regressed linearly. When the stirrup yields, the peak maximum shear crack width ranges from 0.93 to 1.22  mm, suggesting that the shear-span to depth ratio only slightly affects the relationship between <b>the</b> yielding <b>strain</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stirrup and the peak maximum shear crack width. Additionally, when the peak maximum shear crack width is limited to 0.3  mm, <b>the</b> allowable <b>strain</b> <b>of</b> stirrup ranges from 0.25 to 0.33 times <b>the</b> yielding <b>strain</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stirrup; when the peak maximum shear crack width is limited to 1.0  mm, <b>the</b> allowable <b>strain</b> <b>of</b> stirrup ranges from 0.82 to 1.09 times <b>the</b> yielding <b>strain</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stirrup.|$|R

5|$|Following the Empire-wide seizure and {{imprisonment}} of all Venetians in March 1171, the Byzantine fleet {{was strong}} enough to deter an outright attack by the Venetians, who sailed to Chios and settled for negotiations. Manuel sent a fleet of 150 ships under Kontostephanos to confront them there and employed delaying tactics, until, weakened by disease, the Venetians began to withdraw and were pursued by Kontostephanos' fleet. It was a remarkable reversal of fortunes, compared with the humiliation of 1125. In 1177, another fleet of 70 galleys and 80 auxiliary ships under Kontostephanos, destined for Egypt, returned home after appearing off Acre, as Count Philip of Flanders and many important nobles of the Kingdom of Jerusalem refused to participate in the campaign. However, by the end of Manuel's reign, <b>the</b> <b>strains</b> <b>of</b> constant warfare on all fronts and the Emperor's various grandiose projects had become evident: the historian Niketas Choniates attributes the rise of piracy in the latter years of Manuel's reign to the diversion of the funds intended for the maintenance of the fleet for other needs of the imperial treasury.|$|E
5|$|In March 1952, Lawton joined Second Division side Brentford for a club record £16,000 fee. Manager Jackie Gibbons {{left the}} club {{at the start}} of the 1952–53 season and was succeeded by his {{assistant}} Jimmy Bain, who proved ill-suited to management, and so in January 1953 Lawton was appointed as player-manager, with Bain as his assistant. However he lost the dressing room due to his excessive demands of the players, and <b>the</b> <b>strains</b> <b>of</b> management were having a negative impact on his form. Brentford also lost their best players having sold both Ron Greenwood and Jimmy Hill. He signed two veterans in former Notts County teammate Frank Broome and Ian McPherson to play on the wings, who, with Lawton, formed an attacking trio with a combined age of 104. They got off to a poor start to the 1953–54 season, and Lawton resigned as manager after the Griffin Park crowd began to mock the forward line by singing Dear Old Pals.|$|E
5|$|In her research, Fraser worked {{predominantly}} in infectious disease, studying general infection, puerperal fever, {{scarlet fever}} and septic sore throat among other bacterial infections. She began studies on scarlet fever {{in the early}} 1930s, and along with Dr. Helen Plummer isolated the precipitin present in <b>the</b> <b>strains</b> <b>of</b> streptococci {{likely to lead to}} disease. These findings were important in determining the types of antitoxins which might be employed for immunization to neutralize the disease. The type of research Fraser was engaged in required that the bacteria of the disease which created a toxin be isolated, so that it could be injected into a horse. Repeated injections of small doses of toxin allowed the horse to become immune to the disease. The serum created from the blood of animals which had been immunized, contained an antibody (known at the time as an antitoxin), which could then be injected into humans to cure the disease. Development of the sulfonamides rendered immunization against scarlet fever unnecessary, but she continued to study other aspects of the disease. In 1941, she typed the streptococci of scarlet fever which was an important breakthrough for tracking the epidemiology of the disease. Fraser also conducted research in an attempt to develop an antigen for tuberculosis. With the development of penicillin, her research after 1947, shifted focus to the study of antibiotics including bacitracin, penicillin, polymixin, and subtilin. Fraser studied various preparations of penicillin against the tubercular bacillus and as a treatment for gonorrhoea. Rising through the ranks of assistant professor and associate professor, Fraser became a full professor in 1949 teaching preventative medicine for the Bachelor of Science or nursing degree for the remainder of her career. In 1955 Fraser was appointed as a professor of microbiology and held that post until her retirement a decade later.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a new method for measuring AC field strength, with application of electrostriction effect of electrostrictive ceramics and technology of fiber Bragg grating. We use electrostriction effect {{to design the}} fiber-optic electric field sensor. This device turns <b>the</b> <b>strain</b> <b>of</b> electrostriction material influenced by electric field into <b>the</b> <b>strain</b> <b>of</b> fiber Bragg grating, then wavelength of feedback changes. We can get <b>the</b> <b>strain</b> <b>of</b> electrostriction material through the comparison between initial wavelength and wavelength of feedback, then measurement of electric field strength {{can be achieved by}} detecting <b>the</b> <b>strain</b> <b>of</b> electrostriction material. Experiments indicate that fiber-optic electric field sensor based on electrostriction effect is of effective value for measuring electric field strength, and the response of measuring system to AC electric field is linear. We apply an effective method for the research of measuring electric field strength...|$|R

25|$|On June 13, 2005, the Red Sox honored Carlton Fisk and the 12th-inning {{home run}} that won Game 6 of the 1975 World Series by naming the left field foul pole, which the famous home run contacted, the Fisk Foul Pole. In a pregame {{ceremony}} from the Monster Seats, Fisk was cheered by the Fenway Park crowd while the shot was replayed to <b>the</b> <b>strains</b> <b>of</b> Handel's Hallelujah Chorus, the song longtime Fenway Park organist John Kiley originally played following the home run.

25|$|Meanwhile, the {{relationship}} between the competing editor, Jacobin, and Bratlie's failed replacement, Benjamin, did not go well either. Jacobin reportedly vaunted over the fire victims. In addition, Benjamin authored a series of critical editorials attacking both cement plants of Concrete for dust pollution which led to a loss of advertising revenue for his paper. As a result, in September 1916, Benjamin sold his rebranded Skagit Valley News to Mrs. N.I. Wolbert, and purchased interest in another Washington local paper Wilkeson Record instead. <b>The</b> <b>strains</b> <b>of</b> the World War I and local competition eventually led to the indefinite suspension of Skagit Valley News, making Herald the only newspaper in Concrete by August 1918.|$|E

In January 1914, Kočić was admitted to a Belgrade mental hospital, where he died on 27 August 1916, amid the chaos of World War I and the city's occupation by Austria-Hungary. He was survived by his wife Milka and daughter Dušanka, who {{went on to become a}} professor. The couple also had a son, Slobodan, who predeceased his father and died as a child. Kočić's remains were buried at the New Cemetery.|$|E
25|$|At Shanghai, the new missionaries first {{needed to}} learn the local Wu dialect, as well as Mandarin and the {{literary}} Wen-Li language. They soon learned that of the about twenty missionaries who had traveled to Shanghai to work under Bishop Boone since 1845, only about half remained—many experienced health problems, as well as <b>the</b> <b>strains</b> <b>of</b> cultural adjustment and physical dangers. Soon, {{they were able to}} substitute for the British chaplain who assisted foreign sailors, and by December Williams could read prayers in Chinese well enough to substitute for the bishop. Bishop Boone ordained both Williams and Liggins to the priesthood on 11 January 1857. They soon began making missionary journeys to various cities in the Yangtze River delta from their Shanghai base.|$|E
25|$|Riots amongst {{peasants and}} {{citizens}} of Moscow {{at this time}} were endemic, and included the Salt Riot (1648), Copper Riot (1662), and the Moscow Uprising (1682). By far the greatest peasant uprising in 17th-century Europe erupted in 1667. As the free settlers of South Russia, the Cossacks, reacted against the growing centralization of the state, serfs escaped from their landlords and joined the rebels. The Cossack leader Stenka Razin led his followers up the Volga River, inciting peasant uprisings and replacing local governments with Cossack rule. The tsar's army finally crushed his forces in 1670; a year later Stenka was captured and beheaded. Yet, {{less than half a}} century later, <b>the</b> <b>strains</b> <b>of</b> military expeditions produced another revolt in Astrakhan, ultimately subdued.|$|E

25|$|Following these engagements, Union {{forces were}} {{withdrawn}} from the Valley. Jackson joined Robert E. Lee on the Peninsula for the Seven Days Battles (where he delivered an uncharacteristically lethargic performance, perhaps because of <b>the</b> <b>strains</b> <b>of</b> the Valley Campaign). He had accomplished his mission, withholding over 50,000 needed troops from McClellan. With {{the success of his}} Valley Campaign, Stonewall Jackson became the most celebrated soldier in the Confederacy (until he was eventually eclipsed by Lee) and lifted the morale of the public. In a classic military campaign of surprise and maneuver, he pressed his army to travel 646 miles (1,040km) in 48 days of marching and won five significant victories with a force of about 17,000 against combined foes of 60,000.|$|E
25|$|Though {{the main}} vector (A. aegypti) also occurs in {{tropical}} and subtropical regions of Asia, the Pacific, and Australia, yellow fever has never occurred {{in these parts}} of the globe until the introduction of 11 cases by jet travel from an outbreak in Africa in 2016. Proposed explanations include the idea that <b>the</b> <b>strains</b> <b>of</b> the mosquito in the east are less able to transmit the yellow fever virus, that immunity {{is present in the}} populations because of other diseases caused by related viruses (for example, dengue), and that the disease was never introduced because the shipping trade was insufficient, but none is considered satisfactory. Another proposal is the absence of a slave trade to Asia on the scale of that to the Americas. The trans-Atlantic slave trade was probably the means of introduction into the Western Hemisphere from Africa.|$|E
25|$|I {{think it}} may be taken that we owe the sailors' working song as we now possess it to the Americans. How far do these songs date back? I doubt if the most ancient amongst them is much older than the century.

Work proceeded to <b>the</b> <b>strains</b> <b>of</b> a fiddle, to the piping of the boatswain and his mates, or in earlier times yet, to the trumpet. The working song then is peculiar to the Merchant Service, but one may hunt through the old chronicles without encountering a suggestion of its existence prior to American independence and to the establishment of a Yankee marine.|$|E
