He knew young married couples in all their varieties:--The <b>couples</b> <b>who</b> try to behave {{as if they had been}} married for many years; <b>the</b> <b>couples</b> <b>who</b> attempt no concealment, and take advice from competent authorities about them. <b>The</b> <b>couples</b> <b>who</b> are bashfully talkative before third persons; <b>the</b> <b>couples</b> <b>who</b> are bashfully silent under similar circumstances. <b>The</b> <b>couples</b> <b>who</b> don't know what to do, <b>the</b> <b>couples</b> <b>who</b> wish it was over; <b>the</b> <b>couples</b> <b>who</b> must never be intruded upon without careful preliminary knocking at <b>the</b> door; <b>the</b> <b>couples</b> <b>who</b> can eat and drink in the intervals of [...] "bliss," [...] and <b>the</b> other <b>couples</b> <b>who</b> can't. But <b>the</b> bridegroom who stood helpless on one side of the door, and the bride who remained locked in on the other, were new varieties of the nuptial species, even in the vast experience of Mr. Bishopriggs himself.|$|R
