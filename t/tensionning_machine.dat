50|$|A {{machine head}} (also {{referred}} to as a tuning machine, tuner, or gear head) is a geared apparatus for tuning stringed musical instruments by adjusting string <b>tension.</b> <b>Machine</b> heads are used on mandolins, guitars, double basses etc., and are usually located on the instrument's headstock. Non-geared tuning devices that are used on violins, violas, cellos, lutes, older Flamenco guitars, ukuleles etc., are known as friction pegs. Friction pegs hold the string in tune by way of friction caused by their tapered shape and by the string pull created by the tight string. Some other commonly used slang names for guitar tuners are pegs, gears, machines, cranks, knobs, tensioners and tighteners.|$|R

The time-dependent properties of viscoelastic materials in nanoscale are evaluated by using a harmonic nanoindentation test which is performed by a nanoindenter assembled on an atomic force microscope with a three sided pyramidal Berkovich probe tip. The experimental data are calculated by a numerical regression to fit the three-parameter Kelvin-Maxwell viscoelastic model and compared with the data determined from a creep test conducted by a <b>tension</b> <b>machine.</b> It shows that the compliances evaluated from the nanoindentation are smaller than those from the creep test, which means the properties evaluated by the nanoindentation are much stiffer than those by the creep test. Moreover, the relaxation time determined from the nanoindentation is smaller than the one from the creep test, meaning the response in the nanoindentation is quicker than the response in the creep test.

50|$|There {{has been}} some {{scholarly}} debate {{over the use of}} torsion siege engines. Beginning in the mid-19th century, Guillaume Defour and Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte definitively claimed that torsion siege engines were replaced by trebuchets, <b>tension</b> <b>machines,</b> and counterweight machines early in the Middle Ages because the requisite supplies needed to build the sinew skein and metal support pieces were too difficult to obtain in comparison to the materials needed for <b>tension</b> and counterweight <b>machines.</b> Opposition to this viewpoint appeared later in the 19th century, when General Köhler argued that torsion machines were used throughout the Middle Ages. Scholarly views become more complex at this point, with Rudolf Schneider arguing that the loss of classical knowledge in the early Middle Ages prevented ancient siege engines from being reproduced, while Kalervo Huuri argued that one-armed torsion machines, such as the Roman onager, may have been used in the Medieval Mediterranean, though {{there was no evidence of}} two armed machines, such as the ballista, in this view. Much more recently, Randall Rogers and Bernard Bachrach have argued that the lack of evidence regarding torsion siege engines in the Middle Ages does not provide enough proof that they were not used, especially considering that the narrative accounts of these machines almost always do not provide enough information to definitively identify the type of device being described, even with illustrations.|$|R

50|$|Preceding the {{development}} of torsion siege engines were tension siege engines that had existed {{since at least the}} beginning of the 4th century BC, most notably the gastraphetes in Heron of Alexandria’s Belopoeica that was probably invented in Syracuse by Dionysius the Elder. Though simple torsion devices could have been developed earlier, the first extant evidence of a torsion siege engine comes from the Chalcotheca, the arsenal on the Acropolis in Athens, and dates to c. 338 - 326 BC. It lists the building's inventory that included torsion catapults and its components such as hair springs, catapult bases, and bolts. The transition from <b>tension</b> <b>machines</b> to torsion machines is a mystery, though E.W. Marsden speculates that a reasonable transition would involve the recognition of the properties of sinew in previously existing tension devices and other bows. Furthermore, traditional historiography puts the speculative date of the invention of two-armed torsion machines during the reign of Philip II of Macedon circa 340 BC, which is not unreasonable given the earliest surviving evidence of siege engines stated above.|$|R

While some specific applications require very accurate models, in many common situations simpler (isotropic hardening) models may be sufficient. In these conditions, investigation {{of the impact of}} hardening models requires well defined test configurations and accurate measurements to generate the reference data. Specific draw-bend tests have been especially conceived for this purpose. In this work, such a draw-bending experimental device has been designed, for use on a biaxial <b>tension</b> <b>machine.</b> Three different steel sheets have been tested (one mild steel sheet and two HSS sheets) with thicknesses between 0. 8 and 2 mm.

Twenty-eight aluminum alloy test specimens were subjected {{to a total of}} 7, 834 impacts in the GALCIT Falling-Carriage Repeated <b>Tension</b> -impact <b>Machine.</b> Since the average number of impacts per specimen was about 280 it is believed that this investigation covered a regime different from other investigations made with this equipment. The effect of elapsed time between series of impacts was not established. The results obtained were contradictory, and it is believed that this was due to the energy per impact being variable and unknown. It is established that the geometry of the weight used in this type of test has some influence upon the elongation produced. It is shown that 17 S-T duralumin is relatively sensitive to stress concentrations caused by change in cross-section and strain wave reflection, and relatively insensitive to stress concentrations due to small scribe marks. Evidence is presented to indicate that the elongation at fracture of a specimen subjected to repeated tension impact is inversely proportional to the number of impacts required to produce fracture. Suggestions are offered for improving the test equipment so as to obtain more nearly consistent results. ...|$|R

METHODS: A hypertonic saline solution combined with a digestion method was used to decellularize the ostrich cornea. The microstructure of the acellular corneal matrix was observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. The mechanical properties were detected by a rheometer and a <b>tension</b> <b>machine.</b> The acellular corneal matrix was also transplanted into a rabbit cornea and cytokeratin 3 was used to check the immune phenotype. RESULTS: The microstructure and mechanical properties of the ostrich cornea were well preserved after the decellularization process. In vitro, the methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium results revealed that extracts of the acellular ostrich corneas (AOCs) had no inhibitory effects on the proliferation of the corneal epithelial or endothelial cells or on the keratocytes. The rabbit lamellar keratoplasty showed that the transplanted AOCs were transparent and completely incorporated into the host cornea while corneal turbidity and graft dissolution occurred in the acellular porcine cornea (APC) transplantation. The phenotype of the reconstructed cornea was similar to a normal rabbit cornea with a high expression of cytokeratin 3 in the superficial epithelial cell layer. CONCLUSION: We first used AOCs as scaffolds to reconstruct damaged corneas. Compared with porcine corneas, the anatomical structures of ostrich corneas are closer to those of human corneas.
