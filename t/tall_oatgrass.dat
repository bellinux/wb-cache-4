40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Humboldt State University, Biology, 1994 Coastal grasslands in Redwood National Park, {{known locally}} as the Bald Hills, are {{dominated}} by introduced species. The most dominant and invasive is <b>tall</b> <b>oatgrass,</b> Arrhenatherum elatius. Increasing in cover and distribution rapidly since 1985, it has invaded many areas formerly dominated by native grass species. Park managers wish to develop prescribed burn strategies to inhibit <b>tall</b> <b>oatgrass</b> while not adversely affecting present levels of native species, in particular California oatgrass, Danthonia californica. In 1990 an investigation was undertaken to evaluate and compare the effects of spring and fall prescribed burning on <b>tall</b> <b>oatgrass</b> and California oatgrass. Results indicate that <b>tall</b> <b>oatgrass</b> is inhibited from further spread by both spring and fall burning. California oatgrass is severely reduced from spring burning and slightly reduced from fall burning. Spring burning {{is not an option}} for conducting prescribed burns because of the severe effect on the native California oatgrass. Fall burning may be more effective in controlling <b>tall</b> <b>oatgrass</b> if combined with other techniques. Further investigations are recommended utilizing these techniques...|$|E
40|$|Habitats in agroecosystems are ephemeral, and are {{characterized}} by frequent disturbances forcing pest species to successively colonize various hosts belonging either to the cultivated or to the uncultivated part of the agricultural landscape. The role of wild habitats as reservoirs or refuges for the aphid Sitobion avenae that colonize cultivated fields was assessed by investigating the genetic structure of populations collected on both cereal crops (wheat, barley and oat) and uncultivated hosts (Yorkshire fog, cocksfoot, bulbous oatgrass and <b>tall</b> <b>oatgrass)</b> in western France...|$|E
30|$|In many ecosystems, {{non-native}} grass {{species have}} been implicated in altering fire regimes, particularly where they invade areas with no native analogues (Brooks 1999, D’Antonio 2000, Brooks et al. 2004, Brooks 2008). In the Bald Hills, potential effects on the fire regime are complex, depending {{to a large extent}} on {{the degree to which the}} composition of the fuelbed has shifted with species invasions. Of the four non-native species that we studied, one of these, Harding grass, sustained high moisture content throughout the growing season and may act to delay ignition and dampen fire spread and intensity. In contrast, the non-native annual dogtail might decrease fuel moisture levels and increase their ignitability earlier in the fire season compared to most native perennial species. Two of the non-native species that we studied, sweet vernal grass and <b>tall</b> <b>oatgrass,</b> did not differ from the native species’ moisture contents.|$|E
30|$|By {{the early}} 1990 s, <b>tall</b> <b>oatgrass</b> (Arrhenatherum elatius [L.] J. Presl & C. Presl), {{sweet vernal grass}} (Anthoxanthum odoratum L.), and dogtail (Cynosurus echinatus L.), {{were among the most}} {{dominant}} non-native species in the grasslands of the Bald Hills (Saenz 1983, Grenier 1989, Arguello 1994). Harding grass (Phalaris aquatica L.) was first detected in the park at this time, and quickly spread throughout the grasslands. Due to its tendency to form dense monocultures, Harding grass is currently the most problematic non-native grass in the park (S. Samuels, National Park Service, Orick, California, USA, personal communication). A prescribed fire program was initiated in the early 1990 s to control invasion of the native conifer Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii [Mirb] Franco var. menziesii) and to maintain native herbaceous species richness (Underwood et al. 2003). The fire season for the area spans early summer to late fall; prescribed fires typically occur between September and early November each year.|$|E
30|$|The only annual {{species that}} we studied, the {{non-native}} dogtail, had significantly lower moisture content {{than all other}} study species across all dates except for the non-native sweet vernal grass and the native California oatgrass, which also had relatively low moisture content. These three grasses are relatively small-statured (Figure 2). Dogtail reached its maximum height early and flowered quickly, fitting with its sharp decline in moisture content early in the growing season. After this species senesced (at approximately the end of July), samples of this species contained primarily dead material. California oatgrass is unique among the study species because, when its seeds are mature, the dried culms detach from the still-green basal leaves and fall on the ground. This occurred between the 6 August and 5 September sampling dates, when the moisture content for this species decreased sharply (Figure 3). For the remainder of sampling dates, both basal leaves and detached culms were included in samples. With the exception of Harding grass, the moisture content of the four larger perennials (Figure 2; the native California brome, blue wildrye, California fescue, and the non-native <b>tall</b> <b>oatgrass)</b> {{did not differ significantly}} from each other.|$|E
30|$|The {{relative}} {{dominance of}} non-native species in a fuelbed {{will have a}} significant impact on the overall contribution of the species on the fire regime. A survey of understory vegetation in the oak woodlands of the Bald Hills found that the mean cover of dogtail was 9 % (Livingston 2014). Comparatively, mean cover for <b>tall</b> <b>oatgrass,</b> sweet vernal grass, California brome, blue wildrye, and California fescue in oak woodland understories ranged from only 1 % to 4 %. California oatgrass occurred in woodland understory sampling rarely, and Harding grass was not detected in this survey (Livingston 2014). California oatgrass is one of the more common native grass species in the prairies of the Bald Hills, however, and Harding grass has primarily invaded prairies. Although its overall cover was low in the oak woodland understory survey, California fescue is dominant in several areas of the Bald Hills (Engber et al. 2011), and where it does occur, its cover is generally very high. The non-native species that we studied commonly invade other grasslands and woodlands ecosystems in the Pacific Northwest (Dennehy et al. 2011, Stanley et al. 2011) and elsewhere (Hitchcock 1971), making the results of this study relevant at broader geographic scales.|$|E
40|$|Kincaid's lupine (Lupinus sulphureus ssp. kincaidii [Smith] Phillips) is {{a federally}} listed Threatened plant of Willamette Valley prairies. Both low reproduction, due to seed coat dormancy, and {{competition}} from invasive plants may threaten the longterm viability of this species. In separate studies, I investigated seed germination and an invasive species control technique. My objectives in the seed germination study were {{to test for}} a seed scarification requirement for germination and to identify an effective scarification treatment. I tested the effects of various durations of sulfuric acid immersion on rates of seed water imbibition, germination and emergence in three experiments, and found that sulfuric acid immersion increased germination and emergence rates and 20 min of immersion yielded optimal results. This indicated that Kincaid's lupine seeds have seed coat dormancy effectively broken by a short duration of acid scarification. My objective for the invasive plant control study was to evaluate the effects of growing season mowing on Kincaid's lupine growth and reproduction. This technique was shown effective in reducing cover of the dominant invasive plant in the studied population, <b>tall</b> <b>oatgrass,</b> but its effects on Kincaid's lupine were unknown. I tested the effects of mid-June mowing on the change in numbers of Kincaid's lupine racemes and leaves in permanent plots over one year following treatment. I found that mowing {{reduced the number of}} leaves and racemes produced the year following mowing, indicating that growing season mowing may not be a safe control for invasive species in Kincaid's lupine populations...|$|E
30|$|Past {{work has}} shown that {{non-native}} species affect fuelbed properties (e.g., mass, moisture content, bulk density, structure) and fire regimes (Platt and Gottschalk 2001, Brooks et al. 2004); however, the role of non-native herbaceous species, in regard to fuelbed alteration, is an unknown in Oregon white oak woodlands. MacDougall and Turkington (2007) suggested that invasion of non-native grasses in Oregon white oak savanna in southwestern British Columbia, Canada, in conjunction with fire exclusion, increased grass litter fuel loads at their study site. Growth form of natives and non-natives {{must be considered in}} regard to fuel structure, however. Many native grasses in the Bald Hills are robust perennials (e.g., California brome, blue wildrye, California fescue), and if these have been replaced by wispy annuals (e.g., dogtail), fuel loads may be lighter, leading to lower fire intensities. In the Bald Hills, however, many of the non-native grasses are robust perennials (e.g., <b>tall</b> <b>oatgrass,</b> orchard grass) and contribute to heavy herbaceous fuel loading. That significant alterations of herbaceous mass occurred across structural communities, despite highly variable understory species composition and cover, suggests that overstory structure may be more important than species composition in terms of fuelbed flammability, at least at the structural community scale. An exception to this hypothesis would be oak woodlands with an understory dominated by California fescue, a species Hastings et al. (1997) found to be highly flammable. The substantially inflated fuel loads we observed in fescue fuels (7.67 Mg ha− 1) reveal a possible mechanism for this finding. The role of individual species in surface fire behavior is a topic that holds tremendous promise for further research, with obvious implications for ecological restoration and management (Kane et al. 2008).|$|E
40|$|In 2003 – 2007 {{the issue}} of the forage {{production}} and quality on the permanent grassland was researched by the Crop Research Institute Prague, Research Station Jevíčko. The long-term small plot trials with <b>tall</b> <b>oatgrass</b> stand type (Arrhenatherion) were established in 2003 on a fluvisoil. Four types of utilisation were used in the trial: 1. Intensive (I 1) – 4 cuts per year (1 st cut on 15 th May, every next after 45 days); 2. Medium intensive (I 2) – 3 cuts per year (1 st cut on 30 th May, every next after 60 days); 3. Low intensive (I 3) – 2 cuts per year (1 st cut on 15 th June, 2 nd after 90 days); 4. Extensive (I 4) – 2 cuts per year (1 st cut on 30 th June, 2 nd after 90 days) and four levels of fertilizer application: F 0 = no fertilization; FPK = P 30 K 60 N 0; FPKN 90 = P 30 K 60 +N 90; FPKN 180 = P 30 K 60 +N 180. The overall average DM production of grasslands over five years was 7. 19 t .  ha− 1. The lowest annual DM production is 6. 77 t .  ha− 1 during the intensive utilisation (I 1) and it increases towards the extensive (I 4) utilisation to 7. 62 t .  ha− 1, at all levels of fertilization. Application of phosphorus and potash fertilizers did not have significant effects on grassland DM yield. Application of N-fertilizer increased DM production (P 0. 01) already on the level FPKN 90 to 8. 49 t .  ha− 1, on the level FPKN 180 DM matter still increased up to 9. 51 t .  ha− 1. Forage quality was highest during the intensive (I 1) utilisation and relatively lowest during the extensive (I 4) utilisation. The intensive (I 1) utilisation of permanent grassland improves OMD (P 0. 01), concentration of CP and NEL and decreases fiber concentration (P 0. 01) when compared with the extensive (I 4) utilisation. Fertilizing did not affect quality significantly except for CP concentration which increases with N-fertilization while NEL concentration decreases. Optimal utilisation intensity for dairy cows with annual production of 7 – 8 thousand kg of milk seems to be the intensive (I 1) utilisation with the level of fertilization FPKN 180 for given grass stand (plant society Arrhenatheretum). The forage from the medium intensively (I 2) utilized grassland meets quality parameters for suckler cows at the end of lactation period, the fo­ra­ge from less intensively and extensively (I 3, I 4) utilized grassland is suitable for cows only in the dry period in the form of hay...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1968 Research was {{conducted}} in a mixed-coniferous forest stand that was clearcut, burned, and seeded in order to study early plant succession, grazing influences on native and introduced species, big game use, and environmental relationships vegetation, animal, and environmental research was carried out from 1965 to 1967 in three, five-acre exclosures which had been constructed after treatment in 1963 and 1964. Radical treatments of clearcutting and burning were used to reduce infection of heart rot caused by Indian paint fungus (Echinodontium tinctorium) in grand fir (Abies grandis). Four major tree species [...] Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), ponderosa pine (pinus ponderosa), western white pine (pinus monticola) and western larch (Larix occidentalis) were planted {{at a rate of}} 880 trees per acre. Minor quantities of grand fir, lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta), and Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii) were used to give a total population of 1000 trees per acre. Vegetation analyses showed bull thistle (Cirsium vulgare) to be the most abundant species in early stages of succession. Foliage cover of this species was significantly reduced when competing with introduced grass seedings which included a mixture of timothy (Phleum pralenle), orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata), <b>tall</b> <b>oatgrass</b> (Arrhenatherum elatius), smooth brome (Bromus inermis), white Dutch clover (Trifolium repens) and two pure stands of mountain brome (Bromus marginatus) and blue wildrye (Elymus glaucus). Most thistle and other weedy production were confined to unseeded plots, Redstem ceanothus (Ceanothus sanguineus), ninebark (Physocarpus malvaceus), and birchleaf spirea (Spiraea betulifolia) were the most abundant shrubs in the study area. Canada milkvetch (Astragalus canadensis) and redstem ceanothus [...] both nitrogen fixing species [...] were absent from the uncut stand, and burning enhanced their establishment. Crude protein analysis of the 15 major forage species showed the two nitrogen fixing species to be far superior to other forages from this standpoint. Introduced grass species were more sensitive to soil nitrogen levels than were native species. Yearling replacement heifers stocked at a rate approximating one animal unit per acre were grazed in both cattle exclosures and later combined for grazing the game excluded area. A 1. 5 and 2. 1 pound per day gain was achieved over 42 and 35 -day periods in 1966 and 1967, respectively. During these years, the heifers consumed 7. 1 and 7. 5 gallons of water per day which approximated one gallon per hundred pounds of body weight. Heifers preferred Ross' sedge (Carex rossii), orchardgrass, blue elderberry (Sambucus cerulea), and Canada milkvetch. Different preferences might be noted if an earlier grazing season had been used. Some tree seedling browsing occurred in 1967, but this was believed to result from too high an animal concentration within a small area. Game use in the cattle exclosures markedly reduced production of all browse and Canada milkvetch. Some woody species have been eliminated. Pellet count data supported the hypothesis that game, particularly mule deer, might be attracted to the area for feeding purposes. Digging and feeding activities of small mammals caused isolated effects on seral vegetation development. Environmental measurements showed soil temperatures at two inches below the surface to be generally higher in the clearcut than uncut stand. Air temperatures and solar radiation at three feet above the soil were also higher in the clearcut, Surface soil moisture levels in the clearcut and uncut forest stands indicated that depletion rates were similar in both areas. Due to the preliminary nature of these results, no management plans have been developed. It is believed that grazing and forest management are compatible and essential to maximize profits from the mixed-coniferous forest of northeast Oregon. When proper season of use and numbers of animals are determined, conflicts between range and forest interests should be minimized...|$|E
