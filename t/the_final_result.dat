5|$|A common {{situation}} in ski jumping, and especially ski flying {{due to the}} magnified risks overall, arises when unfavourable weather conditions cause a competition to be cut short or cancelled completely; it is also not uncommon for an entire event to be cancelled. Reasons include strong winds, a lack of (or too much) snow, and poor visibility for athletes or judges. In {{the case of a}} shortened competition, the scores from the first round – if completed – are used to determine <b>the</b> <b>final</b> <b>result.</b> This is called a single-round competition and still counts towards both the Ski Flying and Ski Jumping World Cup. For the World Championships, if one of the two competitions is cancelled, <b>the</b> <b>final</b> <b>result</b> will be based on the competition that took place.|$|E
5|$|At Miami, Hanulak scored {{first on}} a two-yard rush. Morgan {{recovered}} a Miami fumble {{and on the}} ensuing possession Faloney scored on an eight-yard rush. By halftime, Maryland led 27–0.

5|$|In {{the third}} quarter, things got worse for Maryland as the Cavaliers added {{a field goal}} and another touchdown. In a final drive for 46yards, Maryland {{attempted}} to avert a shutout.

5|$|Hugh Jackman later confessed being {{unhappy with}} <b>the</b> <b>final</b> <b>result</b> of X-Men Origins: Wolverine. The actor wanted {{primarily}} {{a film that}} would deepen the Wolverine character, but “somehow the first Wolverine movie ended up looking like the fourth X-Men — just with different characters.” He tried to avert the same results while doing the next solo film for the character, 2013's The Wolverine.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, Johns Hopkins {{narrowly}} retained an undefeated {{regular season}} by winning four one-goal games, which included an edging of Maryland, 16–15.

Edell helped guide the Terps {{to an early}} lead, and they ended the half with an advantage, 10–4, with <b>the</b> <b>final</b> <b>result</b> a rout, 16–8.

5|$|While {{still in}} Madras, Ramanujan {{recorded}} {{the bulk of}} his results in four notebooks of loose-leaf paper. They were mostly written up without any derivations. This is probably the origin of the misapprehension that Ramanujan was unable to prove his results and simply thought up <b>the</b> <b>final</b> <b>result</b> directly. Mathematician Bruce C. Berndt, in his review of these notebooks and Ramanujan's work, says that Ramanujan most certainly was able to prove most of his results, but chose not to.|$|E
5|$|Although only an {{alternate}} {{member of the}} tribunal without a vote, his voice was heard {{in all of its}} deliberations, his hand drafted a large and most important part of its judgment, and no one connected with the tribunal, member or otherwise, had a greater part than he in shaping <b>the</b> <b>final</b> <b>result.</b> If, as I confidently believe, the work of the tribunal will constitute a landmark in the development of world order based on law, to Norman Birkett must go a large share of the credit for the success of the undertaking.

Two weeks later, he scored a double in the club's opening match of the league season against Lens. <b>The</b> <b>final</b> <b>result</b> was 4–1.

5|$|Maryland next {{traveled}} to South Carolina {{to face a}} team coming off of a four-game winning streak. Ralph Felton scored first to cap a long drive with a short rush. In the next series, the Gamecocks punted it away and the ball was returned by Hanulak 35 yards for a touchdown. In the second quarter, South Carolina recovered a Maryland fumble on the Terrapins' 14-yard line. In three plays, Maryland had pushed {{them back to the}} 32-yard line before South Carolina finally scored. With South Carolina held to 37 rushing yards <b>the</b> <b>final</b> <b>result</b> was 24–6.|$|E
5|$|Progressive {{alignments}} are {{not guaranteed}} to be globally optimal. The primary problem is that when errors are made at any stage in growing the MSA, these errors are then propagated through to <b>the</b> <b>final</b> <b>result.</b> Performance is also particularly bad {{when all of the}} sequences in the set are rather distantly related. Most modern progressive methods modify their scoring function with a secondary weighting function that assigns scaling factors to individual members of the query set in a nonlinear fashion based on their phylogenetic distance from their nearest neighbors. This corrects for non-random selection of the sequences given to the alignment program.|$|E

He returned to New Zealand in December that year and resumed his prewar teaching position at Canterbury College, while continuing work on his history. <b>The</b> <b>final</b> <b>result,</b> titled , was published in 1921 and remained the primary reference for New Zealand's contribution to the campaign on the Western Front for several decades.
