Parents who have completed primary school and parents, who live in the Pomurje region, attribute a more prominent role in encouraging children to prepare for <b>The</b> <b>National</b> <b>Assessment</b> <b>of</b> Knowledge to <b>the</b> teachers, rather than themselves.

40|$|Motivation for the diploma thesis {{comes from}} {{the changes in the}} {{curriculum}} for physics in elementary school in 2011. These changes affect assembling tests for <b>the</b> <b>national</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> knowledge for physics. The thesis contains a comparison of the old learning objectives with standards and objectives of the new curriculum, which are based on the problems in <b>the</b> tests <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>national</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> knowledge of physics in year 2012. Objectives and standards from new curriculum are put in a table and numbered. We analyse how much and in what way the objectives from the old curriculum that were used in <b>the</b> <b>national</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> knowledge in 2012, match the objectives and standards from the new curriculum for physics. The main purpose of thesis is to determine to what extent the new curriculum covers the old one in terms of objectives and standards related to <b>the</b> tests <b>of</b> <b>national</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> knowledge. Furthermore, we try to explain the difference between objectives and standards on concrete examples of tasks and thereby allow teachers to understand better these two concepts in relation to the <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> pupils' knowledge. ...|$|R

40|$|One form of {{external}} knowledge assesment is <b>the</b> <b>national</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> knowledge at <b>the</b> {{end of the}} ninth grade in elementary schools. External testing tries to acquire the most objective and accurate insight into students knowledge. With <b>national</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> knowledge we enable students, their parents, teachers, schools and instituitions dealing with education to excess information about success in achieving objectives and standards, provided in national curriculum {{and allow them to}} check quality of teaching and learning. With this kind <b>of</b> <b>assessment</b> we can determine deficiencies and with their help we can improve how we teach and learn in the future. In the school year 2011 / 2012, one of the four subjects being assessed in <b>the</b> <b>national</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> knowledge was biology. There where 5683 participants in <b>the</b> <b>national</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> knowledge in biology. There average score was 48, 02 %.
