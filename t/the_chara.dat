Wilson in 2006 and the Infrared Optical Telescope Array at Mt. Hopkins in 2011, revealed evidence for an inner dust band around Vega.

5|$|Altair {{is one of}} the few {{stars for}} which a direct image has been obtained. In 2006 and 2007, J. D. Monnier and his {{coworkers}} produced an image of Altair's surface from 2006 infrared observations made with the MIRC instrument on <b>the</b> <b>CHARA</b> array interferometer; this was the first time the surface of any main-sequence star, apart from the Sun, had been imaged. The false-color image was published in 2007. The equatorial radius of the star was estimated to be 2.03 solar radii, and the polar radius 1.63 solar radii—a 25% increase of the stellar radius from pole to equator. The polar axis is inclined by about 60° to the line of sight from the Earth.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{calculated}} that the star may have 76 percent of the Sun's mass and 46 percent of the luminosity. The radius has been directly determined by interferometry to be 94 percent that of the Sun's radius using <b>the</b> <b>CHARA</b> array. The rotational period of 54 Piscium is about 40.2 days. The age of the star is about 6.4 billion years, based on chromospheric activity and isochronal analysis. There is some uncertainty in the scientific press about the enriched of elements heavier than hydrogen than the Sun; what astronomers term the metallicity. Santos et al. (2004) report the logarithm of the abundance ratio of iron to hydrogen, , to be 0.12dex, whereas Cenarro et al. (2007) published a value of –0.15dex.|$|E

500|$|When {{the radius}} of Vega was {{measured}} to high accuracy with an interferometer, {{it resulted in}} an unexpectedly large estimated value of [...] times the radius of the Sun. This is 60% larger than the radius of the star Sirius, while stellar models indicated it should only be about 12% larger. However, this discrepancy can be explained if Vega is a rapidly rotating star that is being viewed {{from the direction of}} its pole of rotation. Observations by <b>the</b> <b>CHARA</b> array in 2005–06 confirmed this deduction.|$|E
500|$|Astronomical optical {{interferometry}} {{has had to}} overcome a number of technical issues not shared by radio telescope interferometry. The short wavelengths of light necessitate extreme precision and stability of construction. For example, spatial resolution of 1 milliarcsecond requires 0.5µm stability in a 100m baseline. Optical interferometric measurements require high sensitivity, low noise detectors that did not become available until the late 1990s. Astronomical [...] "seeing", the turbulence that causes stars to twinkle, introduces rapid, random phase changes in the incoming light, requiring kilohertz data collection rates to be faster than the rate of turbulence. Despite these technical difficulties, roughly a dozen astronomical optical interferometers are now in operation offering resolutions down to the fractional milliarcsecond range. , a binary star system approximately 960 light-years (290 parsecs) away in the constellation Lyra, as observed by <b>the</b> <b>CHARA</b> array with the MIRC instrument. The brighter component is the primary star, or the mass donor. The fainter component is the thick disk surrounding the secondary star, or the mass gainer. The two components are separated by 1milli-arcsecond. Tidal distortions of the mass donor and the mass gainer are both clearly visible.|$|E
