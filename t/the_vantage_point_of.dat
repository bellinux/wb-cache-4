From <b>the</b> <b>vantage</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> our latter era, the 19th-century view presents a result that appears now as somewhat of a distortion. On the other hand, each individual's outlook will necessarily encompass unique insights.|$|E

The exhibit includes views of the plumbing from <b>the</b> <b>vantage</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> those residing or working at the prison, including that of the prisoners, prison guards, and the manufacturers of the plumbing.

500|$|Allward {{constructed}} the memorial on <b>the</b> <b>vantage</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> Hill 145, {{the highest point}} on the ridge. The memorial contains many stylized features, including 20 human figures, which help the viewer in contemplating the structure as a whole. The front wall, normally mistaken for the rear, is [...] high and represents an impenetrable wall of defence. There {{is a group of}} figures {{at each end of the}} front wall, next to the base of the steps. The Breaking of the Sword is located at the southern corner of the front wall while Sympathy of the Canadians for the Helpless is located at the northern corner. Collectively, the two groups are The Defenders and represent the ideals for which Canadians gave their lives during the war. There is a cannon barrel draped in laurel and olive branches carved into the wall above each group, to symbolize victory and peace. In Breaking of the Sword, three young men are present, one of whom is crouching and breaking his sword. This statue represents the defeat of militarism and the general desire for peace. This grouping of figures is the most overt image to pacifism in the monument, the breaking of a sword being extremely uncommon in war memorials. The original plan for the sculpture included one figure crushing a German helmet with his foot. It was later decided to dismiss this feature because of its overtly militaristic imagery. In Sympathy of the Canadians for the Helpless, one man stands erect while three other figures, stricken by hunger or disease, are crouched and kneeling around him. The standing man represents Canada's sympathy for the weak and oppressed.|$|E

In contrast to recent historiography that has focused on the translation of Scottish society, culture, and identity in British imperial spaces, this article argues that disidentification from the Highlands of Scotland and the erasure of different peoples, cultures, and textures of life was integral to Mackintosh's configuration of a British imperial identity...|$|R

[...] In general, Amy Barrias' analyses of representative coming-of-age Chicano and American Indian texts, including Bless Me, Ultima allows her to conclude that because American Indian and Chicano(a) writers find very little in dominant culture on which to build an identity, they have turned inward to create their own texts of rediscovery.

40|$|Two {{perspectives}} {{from which}} memories can be retrieved have been distinguished: field resembles {{the view from}} <b>the</b> first-person <b>vantage</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> original experience, whereas observer resembles the view from <b>the</b> third-person <b>vantage</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> a spectator. There {{is evidence that the}} incidences of the two types of perspective differ between at least two different cultural groups. It is hypothesised here that this is a special case of a more general relation between memory perspective and cultural individualism, such that field and observer perspectives are more prevalent among people from, respectively, relatively individualist and relatively collectivist societies. Memory perspectives adopted by participants from a range of different countries were recorded, and were found to vary in the predicted manner. Regression analysis showed that the potential effects of three other cultural variables - uncertainty avoidance, masculinity and, to a lesser extent, power distance - were eclipsed by the influence of individualism, and the implications are discussed.

40|$|This discursive article {{considers}} {{implications for}} teacher education in England following {{the introduction of}} the new Special Educational Needs and Disability (SEND) Code of Practice (CoP) 2014. Tailored training to increase skills in differentiation and personalisation, as well as the skills required to lead effective review meetings for children with SEND and their families, may be one response. However, the article argues that rather than viewing the Code merely as a manual, a critical engagement with its messages and intentions may better prepare beginning teachers to meet the demands and expectations articulated within. One such example is familiarisation with the ongoing debate in the literature about shortcomings in partnership working. By considering the SEND Code <b>of</b> Practice from <b>the</b> <b>vantage</b> <b>points</b> <b>of</b> professionalism and professional ethics, and by discussing contested conceptions of professional identity as well as personal responses to uncertainty, complexity and dilemmas, teacher educators can support individuals to draw on resources beyond prescriptive guidance and SEND awareness training for professional formation...|$|R
