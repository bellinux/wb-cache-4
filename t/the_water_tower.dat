5|$|Except for {{the iron}} or steel {{included}} in the bridges and <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>tower,</b> the structures are built in brick or stone. The stone is almost invariably red sandstone, obtained from local quarries in the Runcorn, Weston, and Halton areas.

5|$|On {{the west}} (rear) of the Ellwood House, the {{circular}} limestone water tower is about 50 feet (15.2 m) tall {{and has a}} diameter of 18 feet (5.5 m). The tower has windows occurring at different levels, which are arched and include keystones in their design. <b>The</b> <b>water</b> <b>tower</b> was built in 1879, {{the same year as}} Ellwood House, and at that time the structure was topped with a wooden water tank with a conical roof. Between 1897 and 1910 the wooden tank was removed and replaced with an additional 30 courses of stone which matched the original structure. The arched door at the base of <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>tower</b> was replaced with a larger square-shaped double door. The roof remained conical and of wood construction until about 1950 when it was replaced with sheet metal.|$|E

5|$|Edmund Crouchback {{passed on}} the castle to his eldest son, Thomas, Earl of Lancaster, in 1298. Lancaster married Alice de Lacy, which made him the richest nobleman in England. Kenilworth became the primary castle of the Lancaster estates, {{replacing}} Bolingbroke, and acted as both a social and a financial centre for Thomas. Thomas built the first great hall at the castle from 1314 to 1317 and constructed <b>the</b> <b>Water</b> <b>Tower</b> along the outer bailey, as well as increasing {{the size of the}} chase. Lancaster, with support from many of the other English barons, found himself in increasing opposition to Edward II. War broke out in 1322, and Lancaster was captured at the Battle of Boroughbridge and executed. His estates, including Kenilworth, were confiscated by the crown. Edward and his wife, Isabella of France, spent Christmas 1323 at Kenilworth, amidst major celebrations.|$|E

5|$|On September 20, 2003, the {{original}} {{wing of the}} Briarcliff Lodge caught fire. The owner, Barrington Venture, had planned to raze the 100-year-old building and construct a 385-unit senior living center, which was opposed by local historians and architects. The fire thus ended the preservation effort. The fire started near the main entrance and was suppressed by mid-day; it was deemed suspicious by fire officials. Residents began calling at 6:37 am, after noticing smoke coming from the site. The Briarcliff Manor Fire Department {{was the first to}} arrive, at 6:40 am, later followed by Ossining, Sleepy Hollow, Millwood, Pleasantville, Chappaqua, Croton, and Pocantico Hills, totaling about 150 firefighters. The fire also spread to the lodge's 9-story west wing, through its wooden attic even though a concrete block firewall stood between both sections. The fire departments contained the fire to prevent it from spreading north or to the village water tower, and therefore saved <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>tower</b> and village and commercial radio antennae. After the fire, Westchester County's Cause & Origin Team sent an arson investigative unit, which sifted through the debris along with trained dogs, and found no evidence of arson. Contemporary portions of the lodge and other campus buildings were later demolished.|$|E
5|$|On-set computer-generated {{effects for}} the pilot were done by Thomas Special Effects. Certain scenes, because of time and money, had to be created digitally. The opening {{sequence}} showing the destruction of <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>tower</b> by a meteor was created on the computer. A persistent problem during production {{was the lack of}} cornfields. As realistic corn was a necessity for a show based in Kansas, this became a problem for the filmmakers. Over 10,000 stalks of corn were grown in a greenhouse {{for the pilot}}, but they only grew two feet high, which was not usable to the crew. The day the crew was filming the scene for Clark's landing there were no cornfields in the surrounding area. The cornfields had to be digitally added. Digital corn was a common substitute for the undersized corn that was grown, but for scenes where digital corn was not an option, six hundred stalks of fake corn were flown in from a manufacturer in Arizona. Other digital effects include the flattened cornfield where Lex was caught in a meteorite blast. Some scenes required physical effects, instead of computer imagery. When Lex drives his car off a bridge and hits Clark, the stunt performer, who doubled as Wolverine in the film X-Men, was literally hit by the car as it went over the bridge.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} 1902 Briarcliff Lodge building {{burned to}} the ground on September 20, 2003. The building was scheduled for demolition within 18 months (they had applied for demolition permits the week before the fire). The owner, Barrington Venture, had planned to raze the building and construct the Garlands, a 385-unit senior living center, which was opposed by local historians and architects. The fire thus ended the preservation effort. The fire started near the main entrance and was suppressed by mid-day; it was deemed suspicious by fire officials, including Briarcliff's fire chief. Residents began calling at 6:37 am, after noticing smoke coming from the site. The Briarcliff Manor Fire Department was the first to arrive, at 6:40 am, later followed by Ossining, Sleepy Hollow, Millwood, Pleasantville, Chappaqua, Croton, and Pocantico Hills, totaling about 150 firefighters. The fire also spread to the lodge's 9-story west wing, through its wooden attic even though a concrete block firewall stood between both sections. The fire departments contained the fire to prevent it from spreading north or to the village water tower, and therefore saved <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>tower</b> and village and commercial radio antennae. The north wing was damaged but still standing. After the fire, Westchester County's Cause & Origin Team sent an arson investigative unit, which sifted through the debris along with trained dogs, and found no evidence of arson. Most that remained of the original section was the stone facade and chimneys. Contemporary portions of the lodge and other campus buildings were later demolished.|$|E
40|$|This study focusses on {{the urban}} {{infrastructure}} for water supply in Roman Pompeii. <b>The</b> <b>water</b> distribution network of lead pipes was constructed {{inside the city}} walls, {{at the time when}} the city was connected to an aqueduct. Life for the Pompeiians changed considerably when aqueduct water started running continuously in street fountains all around the city. The study is based on previous research and on my own investigations and measurements on site in connection with the Swedish Pompeii Project. The thesis presents a new interpretation of <b>the</b> main <b>water</b> system, in specific, the interconnection of <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>towers.</b> Three main <b>water</b> pipelines were connected from a distributor building, Castellum Aquae, located at the highest level in the city, and supplied <b>water</b> to <b>the</b> top containers on at least fourteen <b>water</b> <b>towers.</b> <b>The</b> main <b>water</b> system worked on <b>the</b> principle that <b>water</b> could flow down from the top container of one <b>water</b> <b>tower</b> to <b>the</b> next provided that this was located at a lower level. Investigations and measurements of the vertical grooves on the sides of <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>towers</b> support my conclusion that two of <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>towers</b> were designed to supply water to two public baths. Three of <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>towers</b> were built with a groove for a connection to other <b>water</b> <b>towers</b> in <b>the</b> not yet excavated parts of the city. The study also presents a small part of <b>the</b> <b>water</b> distribution for public and private use. The design of individual pipes from the top container of <b>water</b> <b>towers</b> to all street fountains, public baths, houses and workshops was based not only on the shortest distance between <b>water</b> <b>tower</b> and <b>water</b> user, but also on the head between the level of the top container and the level of <b>the</b> <b>water</b> user. It is argued in the study that the planning of <b>the</b> <b>water</b> infrastructure was a complex procedure. The design engineer in antiquity had to consider changes in the operation of the system and changes in <b>the</b> demand from <b>water</b> users...|$|R
