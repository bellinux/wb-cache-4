5|$|A few DNA {{sequences}} in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, {{and more}} in plasmids and viruses, blur the distinction between sense and antisense strands by having overlapping genes. In these cases, some DNA sequences do double duty, encoding one protein when read along one strand, and a second protein when read {{in the opposite direction}} along the other strand. In bacteria, this overlap may be involved in the regulation of gene transcription, while in viruses, overlapping genes increase <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> that can be encoded within the small viral genome.|$|E
5|$|The {{intermediate}} hippocampus has overlapping characteristics {{with both}} the ventral and dorsal hippocampus. Using anterograde tracing methods, Cenquizca and Swanson (2007) located the moderate projections to two primary olfactory cortical areas and prelimbic areas of the medial prefrontal cortex. This region has the smallest number of place cells. The ventral hippocampus functions in fear conditioning and affective processes. Anagnostaras et al. (2002) showed that alterations to the ventral hippocampus reduced <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> sent to the amygdala by the dorsal and ventral hippocampus, consequently altering fear conditioning in rats.|$|E

5|$|As older {{problems}} are solved, more complexities are being introduced, like adding additional parts to an engine. Interaction {{of these new}} parts, or niches, create emergent properties, like time-saving office devices (e.g. email, mobile computers, etc.) make communication more efficient but also expand the network of contacts and {{increase the amount of}} time spent on such duties. Homer-Dixon relates this to complexity theory explaining that as new niches are filled there is a synergistic burst of simplicity. However, this can also lead to less control or freedom as emergent properties are created, like a new government program leading to a sprawling bureaucracy. Information theory is touched upon relating <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> required to describe a system and the degree of that system's complexity. Chaos theory is used to describe how small changes can lead to widely varying results and path dependence.|$|E
5|$|The first {{spacecraft}} to orbit Jupiter was the Galileo orbiter, which went into orbit around Jupiter on December 7, 1995.

During this period, it gathered {{a large amount of}} information about the Jovian system; <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> was not as great as intended because the deployment of its high-gain radio transmitting antenna failed. The major events during the eight-year study included multiple flybys of all of the Galilean moons, as well as Amalthea (the first probe to do so).

5|$|The pallium is a {{layer of}} gray matter that lies {{on the surface of}} the {{forebrain}} and is the most complex and most recent evolutionary development of the brain as an organ. In reptiles and mammals, it is called the cerebral cortex. Multiple functions involve the pallium, including smell and spatial memory. In mammals, where it becomes so large as to dominate the brain, it takes over functions from many other brain areas. In many mammals, the cerebral cortex consists of folded bulges called gyri that create deep furrows or fissures called sulci. The folds increase the surface area of the cortex and therefore increase the amount of gray matter and <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> that can be stored and processed.|$|E

50|$|To {{use this}} method, one {{proves that the}} history of the given process can be {{recorded}} in an efficient way, such that the state of the process at any past time can be recovered from the current state and this record, and such that <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> additional <b>information</b> that is recorded at each step of the process is (on average) less than <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> new <b>information</b> randomly generated at each step. The resulting growing discrepancy in total information content can never exceed <b>the</b> fixed <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> in <b>the</b> current state, from which it follows that the process must eventually terminate. This principle can be formalized and made rigorous using Kolmogorov complexity.|$|R
25|$|The {{effect of}} {{attention}} on memory recall has surprising results. It {{seems that the}} only time attention largely affects memory is during the encoding phase. During this phase, performing a parallel task can severely impair retrieval success.

In general, measuring an unknown quantum state changes that state in some way. This is a consequence of quantum indeterminacy and can be exploited in order to detect any eavesdropping on communication (which necessarily involves measurement) and, more importantly, to calculate <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> that has been intercepted.|$|E
25|$|Some theorists {{argue that}} the {{capacity}} of working memory decreases as we age, and {{we are able to}} hold less information. In this theory, declines in working memory are described as the result of limiting <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> an individual can simultaneously keep active, so that a higher degree of integration and manipulation of information is not possible because the products of earlier memory processing are forgotten before the subsequent products.|$|E

25|$|For the asymptotics to hold {{in cases}} where the {{assumption}} of independent identically distributed observations does not hold, a basic requirement is that <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> in the data increases indefinitely as the sample size increases.

This information was then forwarded one step down a hierarchy, to the Groups.|$|E
