5|$|Among {{the critics}} of using Sangam {{literature}} for historical studies is Herman Tieken, who maintains that the Sangam poems were composed in the 8th or 9th century and that they attempt <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> <b>a</b> period much earlier than when they were written.|$|E
5|$|In English, {{common names}} of D. russelii include Russell's viper, chain viper, Indian Russell's viper, common Russell's viper, seven pacer, chain snake, and {{scissors}} snake.

5|$|Von Neumann {{founded the}} field of {{continuous}} geometry based on lattice theoretic principles. Earlier, Menger and Birkhoff had axiomatized complex projective geometry {{in terms of the}} properties of its lattice of linear subspaces. Von Neumann, following his work on rings of operators, weakened those axioms <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> <b>a</b> broader class of lattices, the continuous geometries.|$|E
5|$|A major {{disruption}} to Banksia nomenclature {{occurred in}} 1891, when Otto Kuntze challenged Banksia L.f. {{on the grounds}} that Johann Reinhold Forster and his son Georg had already penned the name Banksia <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> <b>a</b> different genus of plant, and hence Banksia J.R.Forst & G. Forst took precedence and rendered Banksia L.f. (i.e. as used by Linnaeus) invalid. Kuntze transferred all Banksia taxa to the new name Sirmuellera; thus B.dentata became Sirmuellera dentata (L.f.) Kuntze. Kuntze's challenge failed, as did a similar challenge by James Britten in 1905. Britten proposed the generic name Isostylis, republishing B.dentata as Isostylis dentata (L.f.) Britten. In 1940 Banksia L.f. was formally conserved against future challenges.|$|E

5|$|Between 1815 and 1824, the Rev William Buckland, a {{professor}} of geology at Oxford, collected more fossilized bones of Megalosaurus {{and became the first}} person <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> <b>a</b> dinosaur in a scientific journal. The second dinosaur genus to be identified, Iguanodon, was discovered in 1822 by Mary Ann Mantell– the wife of English geologist Gideon Mantell. Gideon Mantell recognized similarities between his fossils and the bones of modern iguanas. He published his findings in 1825.|$|E
5|$|Capsize is {{the word}} used <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> <b>a</b> bike falling over without oscillation. During capsize, an {{uncontrolled}} front wheel usually steers {{in the direction of}} lean, but never enough to stop the increasing lean, until a very high lean angle is reached, at which point the steering may turn in the opposite direction. A capsize can happen very slowly if the bike is moving forward rapidly. Because the capsize instability is so slow, on the order of seconds, it is easy for the rider to control, and is actually used by the rider to initiate the lean necessary for a turn.|$|E
5|$|Conchology is the {{scientific}} study of mollusc shells, but the term conchologist is also sometimes used <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> <b>a</b> collector of shells. Many people pick up shells on the beach or purchase them and display them in their homes. There are many private and public collections of mollusc shells, but the largest one in the world is at the Smithsonian Institution, which houses in excess of 20 million specimens.|$|E

5|$|DNA {{sequences}} can be {{mapped to}} reveal a phylogenetic tree that represents evolutionary relationships, with each branch point representing the divergence of two lineages from a common ancestor. On this tree the term basal is used <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> <b>a</b> lineage that forms a branch diverging nearest to the common ancestor. Wolf genetic sequencing has found the Beringian wolf to be basal to all other gray wolves except for the modern Indian gray wolf and Himalayan wolf, and the extinct Belgian clade of Pleistocene wolves.|$|E

5|$|Indian Wars is {{the name}} {{generally}} used in the United States <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> <b>a</b> series of conflicts between the colonial or {{federal government and the}} native people of North America.

5|$|Lady Wilkinson (1858), who {{provides}} an extensive {{discussion of the}} etymology of the various names for this plant, suggests a very different origin, namely the Old English word affodyle (that which cometh early), citing a 14th-century (but likely originally much earlier) manuscript {{in support of this}} theory, and which appears <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> <b>a</b> plant resembling the daffodil. Ellacombe provides further support for this from a fifteenth century English translation of Palladius that also refers to it.|$|E
5|$|Roguelike is a {{term used}} <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> <b>a</b> subgenre of {{role-playing}} video games that are characterized by a dungeon crawl through procedurally generated game levels, turn-based gameplay, tile-based graphics, and permanent death of the player-character.

5|$|The Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (HR diagram) is {{a plot of}} {{luminosity}} {{versus a}} color index {{for a set of}} stars. IK Pegasi A is currently a main sequence star—a term that is used <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> <b>a</b> nearly linear grouping of core hydrogen-fusing stars based on their position on the HR diagram. However, IK Pegasi A lies in a narrow, nearly vertical band of the HR diagram that is known as the instability strip. Stars in this band oscillate in a coherent manner, resulting in periodic pulsations in the star's luminosity.|$|E
