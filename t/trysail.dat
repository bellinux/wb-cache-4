25|$|Brig sails {{are named}} after the masts {{to which they are}} attached: the mainsail; above that the main topsail; above that the main {{topgallant}} sail; and occasionally a very small sail, called the royal, is above that. Behind the main sail there is a small fore-and-aft sail called the spanker or boom mainsail (it is somewhat similar to the main sail of a schooner). On the foremast is a similar sail, called the <b>trysail.</b> Attached to the respective yards of square-rigged ships are smaller spars, which can be extended, thus lengthening the yard, thus receiving an additional sailing wing on each side. These are called studding sails, and are used with fair and light wind only. The wings are {{named after the}} sails to which they are fastened, i.e. the main studding sails, main top studding sails, and the main top gallant studding sails, etc.|$|E
500|$|A {{smartphone}} game, Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story, {{was released}} in Japan on August 22, 2017. The game features a new character named Iroha Tamaki, who arrives {{in the city of}} Kamihama in order to search for her missing sister. The game features the theme song [...] by <b>TrySail.</b>|$|E
500|$|Tropical Storm Tammy caused minor damage. Its highest {{sustained}} {{winds were}} [...] and its strongest recorded wind gust was [...] The winds produced no significant damage, but did disrupt power to 16,500 utility customers and delayed the <b>Trysail</b> College Regatta. Lightning {{produced by a}} thunderstorm in Broward County, Florida struck three teenagers during a football game in Coconut Creek, killing one and injuring the other two.|$|E
5000|$|In the Royal Navy in {{the late}} nineteenth century, the term [...] "trysail" [...] came to denote the main fore-and-aft sail on any mast. This {{included}} the mainsail of the [...] "great brig" [...] HMS Temeraire, the largest fore-and-aft sail ever used by a warship. Naval <b>trysails</b> were usually gaff-rigged and [...] "loose-footed", with a spar along the head but no boom, and small auxiliary <b>trysails</b> continued in intermittent use into the 1920s for seakeeping and stationkeeping.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{must get}} <b>trysails</b> {{on the main}} and foremast," [...] Wilkinson went on, [...] "and manage to lay her course {{a couple of points}} to the west. I wish we had those upper spars down on deck, but it is of no use talking of that now." ...|$|R
60|$|That was all. The rest retreated for'ard on {{the dead}} run, while the three <b>trysails,</b> furled {{at the foot of}} the stays next to the mizzen and set on fire by the {{dripping}} gasolene, went up in flame and burned entirely away and out without setting the rest of the ship on fire. That is one of the virtues of a ship steel-masted and steel-stayed.|$|R
6000|$|... "God bless Mrs. <b>Trysail!</b> She'll get a pension, and I hope contentment! You {{must give}} the reef a good, berth, in {{rounding}} Montauk--and you'll naturally wish {{to find the}} anchors again, when the coast is clear--if {{you can find it}} in your conscience, say a good word of poor old Ben <b>Trysail,</b> in the dispatches--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Blow, good devil, and {{you shall}} have the cook!" [...] muttered <b>Trysail,</b> quoting a very {{different}} author. [...] "Another glass will bring us within hail." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What is gone, Sir?" [...] {{he asked}} of <b>Trysail,</b> whose earnest face just then became {{visible through the}} {{drifting}} smoke. [...] "What sail is so heavily flapping?" ...|$|E
50|$|Sylph was a clipper ship {{built in}} Calcutta in 1831 for the Parsi {{merchant}} Rustomjee Cowasjee. After her purchase by the Hong Kong based merchant house Jardine Matheson, in 1833 Sylph {{went on to}} set an unbroken speed record by sailing from Calcutta to Macao in 17 days, 17 hours. Her primary role was to transport opium between various ports in the Far East. Two contemporary paintings of Sylph show her {{to have been a}} heavily rigged ship with <b>trysails</b> on each mast and a tall, high-peaked spanker.|$|R
500|$|American (Delaware River yard no. 308) was {{launched}} on 14 July 1900, and delivered to American-Hawaiian in October, joining Californian in the American-Hawaiian Fleet. American, {{the first of}} the trio of Pennsylvania ships to be completed, was , and was [...] in length and [...] abeam. She had a deadweight tonnage of , and her cargo holds had a storage capacity of [...] American had a speed of , and was powered by a single triple-expansion steam engine with coal-fired boilers, that drove a single screw propeller. American and her sister ships, equipped with two upright masts, carried and used two large <b>trysails,</b> a fore staysail and jib, and a main staysail, to help conserve coal for their journeys.|$|R
60|$|The Nan-Shan {{was being}} looted {{by the storm}} with a senseless, {{destructive}} fury: <b>trysails</b> torn out of the extra gaskets, double-lashed awnings blown away, bridge swept clean, weather-cloths burst, rails twisted, light-screens smashed--and two of the boats had gone already. They had gone unheard and unseen, melting, as it were, in the shock and smother of the wave. It was only later, when upon the white flash of another high sea hurling itself amidships, Jukes {{had a vision of}} two pairs of davits leaping black and empty out of the solid blackness, with one overhauled fall flying and an iron-bound block capering in the air, that he became aware of what had happened within about three yards of his back.|$|R
6000|$|... "One {{would think}} {{a man of}} your years, Mr. <b>Trysail,</b> would see the {{difference}} between robbing the revenue of a guinea, and robbing it of a thousand pounds." ...|$|E
60|$|A {{gooseneck}} on the gaff of the mainsail broke short off. We {{replaced it}} with the gooseneck from the gaff of the storm <b>trysail,</b> and the second gooseneck broke short off inside fifteen minutes of use, and, mind you, it {{had been taken from}} the gaff of the storm <b>trysail,</b> upon which we would have depended in time of storm. At the present moment the Snark trails her mainsail like a broken wing, the gooseneck being replaced by a rough lashing. We'll {{see if we can get}} honest iron in Honolulu.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now is {{our time}} to bring the matter hand to hand!" [...] he cried, making a gesture to <b>Trysail</b> to descend from the ladder, in order that he might pass.|$|E
6000|$|... "Here is the land, Sir!" [...] {{bellowed}} <b>Trysail,</b> from a cat-head, {{where he}} stood resembling some venerable sea-god, dripping with his native element. [...] "We are passing it, like a race-horse!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Down {{with the}} helm, Watkins. Now, lads, lower away the <b>trysail</b> {{as fast as}} you can. Now, one of you, clear that hawser as they haul on it. Now out with the anchors." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Trysail</b> {{watched the}} countenance {{of his young}} commander, as he {{examined}} the chase {{with the aid of}} the instrument; and he thought he read strong discontent in his features, when the other laid it aside.|$|E
60|$|Darkness {{was closing}} {{down on the}} waste of {{tumbling}} foam, and the Sorata was clear of the shore, when Jimmy made shift to hoist the <b>trysail</b> reduced by two reefs to a narrow strip of drenched canvas. Then, while Anthea Merril held the helm, he proceeded to set the little spitfire jib. However, he clung to the weather-shrouds, gasping and dripping with perspiration {{for the first few}} moments, because the struggle with the <b>trysail</b> had tried his strength. Indeed, Anthea, who stood bareheaded at the helm with her loosened hair whipping about her, wondered how he had contrived to do it alone in that strength of wind.|$|E
6000|$|... "There is no {{help for}} it," [...] he said. [...] "Still, she'll go {{clear of the}} shore as she is, and I don't think we need be anxious about her when she's under <b>trysail</b> in open water." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I {{suppose the}} proper {{thing would be}} to set the <b>trysail</b> and try to beat her out; but with the tide {{knocking}} up the sea, she'd nearly wash us off when she came on the wind." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Tis of failure! Let {{the ship}} fall-of, and square away the yards! Round in, men, round in. We will run {{down to the}} {{entrance}} of the bay, Mr. <b>Trysail.</b> The knaves have been aided by their lucky star!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Andrews, {{do you and}} {{two others}} get down into the sail locker and bring up the storm jib, the small foresail, <b>trysail,</b> and storm mizzen. If it is a tornado, we shan't want to show much sail to it." ...|$|E
60|$|Ten minutes' {{work and}} it was {{securely}} fastened and its cover on; two reefs were put in the <b>trysail.</b> Two hands went {{to each of the}} halliards, while, as the sail rose, Tom Virtue fastened the toggles round the mast.|$|E
6000|$|... "We are weak-handed to {{deal with}} a stranger;" [...] he said, when he {{returned}} the instrument to <b>Trysail,</b> [...] "You see he has nothing but his top-sails set,--a show of canvas that would satisfy no trader, in a breeze like this!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Jimmy, [...] "it's blowing itself out. I expect we'll be able {{to shake}} the reefs out of the <b>trysail</b> and beat up for the Inlet before it's dark. If it were {{necessary}} I would run her before it now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{must get}} the <b>trysail</b> on her, {{and try to}} beat her back. We {{may be able to}} do it--I don't know," [...] he said. [...] "It's deep water along those rocks, and she'd chafe through and go down; {{otherwise}} I'd ram her ashore." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm sorry," [...] he said. [...] "We couldn't stay {{her under}} the <b>trysail</b> with the puffs {{twisting}} all ways flung {{back by the}} trees. Besides, she'd probably drive down upon the reefs before I got it up. It's quite evident we can't go ashore there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Rally in the gangways, and defy them!" [...] was the {{animated}} cry--"Rally in the gangways, hearts of oak." [...] was returned by <b>Trysail,</b> in a ready but weakened voice. The men obeyed, and Ludlow {{saw that he}} could still muster a force capable of resistance.|$|E
6000|$|... "Send Mr. <b>Trysail</b> to me;" [...] he said, in a {{tone that}} had little of a victor's exultation. [...] "The land breeze has made, and we will {{endeavor}} to improve it, and get inside the cape, lest the morning light give us more of these Frenchmen." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The Monsieur is {{beginning}} to bluster;" [...] said <b>Trysail,</b> who had witnessed the descent of his commander, at that moment and on such an errand, with great dissatisfaction. [...] "Although his shot fell short, it {{is too much to}} let a Frenchman have the credit of first word." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A calmer night never shut in the Americas!" [...] {{said the}} veteran <b>Trysail,</b> {{shaking his head}} doubtingly and {{speaking}} in a suppressed and cautious tone. [...] "I am one of those, Captain Ludlow, who think {{more than half the}} virtue is out of a ship when her anchor is down!" ...|$|E
60|$|The <b>trysail</b> {{was soon}} on deck, {{and then the}} Seabird was brought up into the wind, the weather foresheet hauled aft, the mizzen sheeted almost fore and aft, and the Seabird lay, head to wind, rising and falling with a gentle motion, in strong {{contrast}} to her impetuous rushes when under sail.|$|E
60|$|<b>Trysail</b> ceased speaking, and, {{stepping}} on a gun, he {{also began to}} gaze {{in the direction of}} the Cove. A lantern, or some other bright object, was leisurely raised three times, and as often hid from view. The signal came from under the land, and in a quarter that left no doubt of its object.|$|E
60|$|When {{this was}} done, the topmast was also sent down and lashed by the sail. The barrels, which were now all empty, were lowered {{down into the}} saloon, while the <b>trysail</b> was {{fastened}} to the hoops ready for hoisting, and all the reefs tied up. A triangular mizzen was then hoisted, and a storm jib.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then we {{will prepare}} for the worst, Watkins; get the <b>trysail</b> up on deck. When you are ready we will bring her up into the wind and set it. That's the comfort of a yawl, Jack; one can always lie to without any bother, and one hasn't got such a {{tremendous}} boom to handle." ...|$|E
