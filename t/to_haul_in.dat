In this case, however, the action is more horizontal than vertical, hauling the sail forwards, toward the luff and a bit up, towards the gaff.|$|E
25|$|The Raiders {{scored on}} their opening drive {{of the third}} quarter with Stabler's 13-yard {{touchdown}} pass to Fred Biletnikoff, who managed <b>to</b> <b>haul</b> <b>in</b> the ball with one arm along the right sideline and barely tap his feet in bounds through tight coverage by cornerback Tim Foley, giving them a 14–10 lead. Aided by a 29-yard pass interference penalty against the Raiders on third down, Miami struck back with Bob Griese's 16-yard touchdown pass to Paul Warfield. But Oakland lineman Bubba Smith blocked the extra point attempt, keeping the Miami lead at just 2 points, 16–14.|$|E
25|$|On the eighty-fifth {{day of his}} unlucky streak, Santiago {{takes his}} skiff into the Gulf Stream, sets his lines and, by noon, has his bait taken by a big fish that he is sure is a marlin. Unable <b>to</b> <b>haul</b> <b>in</b> the great marlin, Santiago is instead pulled by the marlin, and two days and nights pass with Santiago holding onto the line. Though wounded by the {{struggle}} and in pain, Santiago expresses a compassionate appreciation for his adversary, often referring {{to him as a}} brother. He also determines that, because of the fish's great dignity, no one shall deserve to eat the marlin.|$|E

25|$|Trollers – {{catch fish}} by towing astern {{one of more}} {{trolling}} lines. A trolling line is a fishing line with natural or artificial baited hooks trailed by a vessel near the surface or at a certain depth. Several lines can be towed {{at the same time}} using outriggers to keep the lines apart. The lines can be hauled in manually or by small winches. A length of rubber is often included in each line as a shock absorber. The trolling line is towed at a speed depending on the target species, from 2.3 knots up to at least 7 knots. Trollers range from small open boats to large refrigerated vessels 30 metres long. In many tropical artisanal fisheries, trolling is done with sailing canoes with outriggers for stability. With properly designed vessels, trolling is an economical and efficient way of catching tuna, mackerel and other pelagic fish swimming close to the surface. Purpose built trollers are usually equipped with two or four trolling booms raised and lowered by topping lifts, held in position by adjustable stays. Electrically powered or hydraulic reels can be used <b>to</b> <b>haul</b> <b>in</b> the lines.|$|E

The Dodgers could not add to their lead in facing McMahon, he held their run total at three. Sherry, however, was nearly perfect for the remainder of the game, allowing just one single to the Braves over the final three innings. The Los Angeles Times labeled Sherry and Roseboro the [...] "heroes" [...] of the game.

500|$|The children's book The Mousehole Cat by Antonia Barber is {{inspired}} by Tom Bawcock's Eve. It {{is the story of}} Tom Bawcock and his loyal black and white cat, Mowzer, setting sail to catch the fish. When the boat hits the storm, it is represented by a giant [...] "Storm-Cat", allowing Mowzer to eventually save the day by soothing the storm with her purring. This purring becomes a song and while the Storm-Cat is resting Tom is able <b>to</b> <b>haul</b> <b>in</b> his catch and return to the village. When they arrive back at the village, the entire catch is baked into a [...] "Star-Gazy" [...] pie, on which the villagers feast. Notably, Antonia Barber points out that stargazy pie was a staple of Mousehole diet before Tom's heroic fishing expedition, however, whereas according to tradition it dates from his return and legendary catch.|$|E
2500|$|A {{court of}} inquiry's {{conclusion}} was that no-one {{could be attributed}} {{the blame for the}} incident, {{and that it would be}} reasonable to support the story that the squall was to blame. It was of such a force that later ships would have also been severely damaged if they had encountered it under the same circumstances. Commander Masterman is reported as stating unofficially that, [...] "Mayfly was pulled in half by the handling party when someone forgot to release the lines that tethered the bows of the ship." [...] Furthermore, in an article entitled Twenty-One Years of Airship Progress Lt.Col. W. Lockwood Marsh wrote: [...] "This accident, though the ship was undoubtedly weak, was directly due to a mistake in handling, one of the parties on a hawser continuing <b>to</b> <b>haul</b> <b>in</b> without noticing that the after car had fouled a buoy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Boult is a left-arm fast medium swing bowler. He {{makes up}} for his {{relative}} lack of height with deceptive pace {{and the ability to}} swing the ball both ways. Boult's primary weapon is the inswinger to the right-hander. Perhaps unsurprisingly, his childhood cricketing hero was Wasim Akram. In 2013, in a radio interview, former New Zealand Captain Jeremy Coney rated Boult as New Zealand's best bowling discovery since Shane Bond. [...] He is also known <b>to</b> <b>haul</b> <b>in</b> one-handed catches with either hand, both in Basin Reserve. [...] In 2014, he became the 4th test bowler since Richard Hadlee, Chris Martin and Ian O'Brien to claim 30+ wickets in consecutive years. [...] He has also developed a great opening bowling partnership with Tim Southee, having taken 46% of all wickets between them since 2013, especially since the retirement of Martin. [...] In 2015 at Basin Reserve, he finally removed Kumar Sangakkara with his left hand after he scored a double century.|$|E

2500|$|During {{his long}} tenure {{in the midst}} of the {{surrounding}} political chaos of the Greek Dark Ages, Egypt was beset by foreign invaders (including the so-called Sea Peoples and the Libyans) and experienced the beginnings of increasing economic difficulties and internal strife which would eventually lead to the collapse of the Twentieth Dynasty. In Year 8 of his reign, the Sea Peoples, including Peleset, Denyen, Shardana, Meshwesh of the sea, and Tjekker, invaded Egypt by land and sea. Ramesses III defeated them in two great land and sea battles. Although the Egyptians had a reputation as poor seamen, they fought tenaciously. Rameses lined the shores with ranks of archers who kept up a continuous volley of arrows into the enemy ships when they attempted to land on the banks of the Nile. Then, the Egyptian navy attacked using grappling hooks <b>to</b> <b>haul</b> <b>in</b> the enemy ships. In the brutal hand-to-hand fighting which ensued, the Sea People were utterly defeated.

2500|$|The {{specifications}} {{for the construction}} of the uncompleted portion of the line were accepted by our ex-General Counsel Mr. McNaught, and our Chief Engineer Mr. Kendrick was not allowed an opportunity to examine and comment on same. The specifications were so drawn as to comply with the kind of road which it was expected to build, and allowed but two miles of sidings in [...] of main line, and made entirely inadequate provision for operating facilities. The worst feature, however, was the clause which provided that the track would be ballasted with adjacent material, instead of train-hauled gravel ballast. The soil is particularly wet, and {{a large portion of the}} line traverses muskeg swamps; this omission would be better understood by a physical examination of the line than words can convey. The natural surface was so bad that the construction company [...] forced <b>to</b> <b>haul</b> <b>in</b> ballast in order to get construction trains over the track.|$|E
