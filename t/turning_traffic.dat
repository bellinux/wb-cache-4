25|$|Turning {{rules are}} by no means universal. For example, in New Zealand (a drive-on-the-left country) between 1977 and 2012, left <b>turning</b> <b>traffic</b> had to give way to {{opposing}} right-turning traffic wishing to take the same road (unless there were multiple lanes, but then one must take care in case a vehicle jumped lanes). New Zealand abolished this particular rule on 25 March 2012, except at roundabouts or when denoted by a Give Way or Stop sign. Although the rule caused initial driver confusion, and many intersections required or still require modification, the change is predicted to eventually prevent one death and 13 serious injuries annually.|$|E
2500|$|This {{will usually}} mean that <b>turning</b> <b>traffic</b> {{will have to}} stop in order {{to wait for a}} breach to turn, and this might cause {{inconvenience}} for drivers that follow them but do not want to turn. This is why dedicated lanes and protected traffic signals for turning are sometimes provided. On busier intersections where a protected lane would be ineffective or cannot be built, turning may be entirely prohibited, and drivers will be required to [...] "drive around the block" [...] in order to accomplish the turn. Many cities employ this tactic quite often; in San Francisco, due to its common practice, making three right turns is known colloquially as a [...] "San Francisco left turn". Likewise, as many intersections in Taipei City are too busy to allow direct left turns, signs often direct drivers to drive around the block to turn.|$|E
2500|$|On roads with {{multiple}} lanes, <b>turning</b> <b>traffic</b> is generally expected {{to move to}} the lane closest to the direction they wish to turn. For example, traffic intending to turn right will usually move to the rightmost lane before the intersection. Likewise, left-turning traffic will move to the leftmost lane. Exceptions to this rule may exist where for example the traffic authority decides that the two rightmost lanes will be for turning right, in which case drivers may take whichever of them to turn. In certain parts of the world traffic will adapt to informal patterns that rise naturally rather than by force of authority; for example, [...] it is common for drivers to observe (and trust) the turn signals used by other drivers in order to make turns from other lanes. For example, if several vehicles on the right lane are all turning right, a vehicle may come from the next-to-right lane and turn right as well, doing so in parallel with the other right-turning vehicles.|$|E

40|$|This study {{developed}} decision assistance curves (DAC) for unconventional intersections, including median U-turns (MUT), {{continuous flow}} intersections (CFI), and jughandle intersections, {{based on their}} operational performance relative to a conventional intersection. An economic analysis was performed to compute the net present value (NPV) of benefits and the benefit to cost ratio (B/C) {{with the development of}} a spreadsheet tool. The DAC classified the region of optimal performance of isolated unconventional intersections. For 5 % left <b>turn</b> <b>traffic</b> conditions, MUT was warranted for all volume criteria. For 10 % and 15 % left <b>turn</b> <b>traffic</b> conditions, jughandle was warranted for the major street approach traffic volumes {{greater than or equal to}} 2200 vph, and greater than 1800 vph, respectively. However, the warranty decreased with the increase of minor streets for all of the conditions except at balanced and nearly balanced conditions under 10 % left <b>turn</b> <b>traffic.</b> For 10 % and 15 % left <b>turn</b> <b>traffic</b> conditions with an unbalanced flow, CFI was warranted for major street approach traffic volumes greater than or equal to 2200 vph, and greater than 1800 vph, respectively. The warranty expanded with the increase of minor street approach traffic volumes. The standard signalized intersection with left turn permitted was warranted for minor street approach traffic volumes less than 200 vph and the major street approach traffic volumes of 700 vph to 1350 vph. The high presence of trucks favored the use of CFI. Additionally, a case study performed on a 24 -hour rural pattern volume indicated the highest NPV of benefits and the highest B/C related to new MUT construction. Though the MUT-retrofit had the highest NPV, since the construction cost of MUT-retrofit was high, a jughandle-retrofit was found to have the highest B/C. In this manner, the developed method provided an integrated decision support system utilizing both operational performance and economic aspects as an improved method over the current practice. Some possible extensions of study were also recommended as further studies. ...|$|R

5000|$|A turn lane is {{set aside}} for slowing down and making a turn, {{so as not to}} disrupt traffic.

5000|$|A similar concept {{involves}} a [...] "Parclo" [...] A4 partial cloverleaf interchange, since {{that type of}} junction involves <b>turning</b> <b>traffic</b> off the freeway turning left onto the arterial, though the arterial itself exits with loop ramps eliminating left-hand turns onto the freeway, {{as well as to}} not invoke at-grade crossings for left turns onto the freeway.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, because {{vehicles}} {{must be able}} {{to cross}} the pavement in six different ways, a SPUI generally has a very large area of uncontrolled pavement {{in the middle of the}} intersection.

40|$|Abstract. Network-on-Chip (NoC) {{has been}} {{proposed}} as an attractive alterna-tive to traditional dedicated busses {{in order to achieve}} modularity and high per-formance in the future System-on-Chip (SoC) designs. Recently, end to end flow control has gained popularity in the design process of network-on-chip based SoCs. Where flow control is employed, fairness issues need to be consid-ered as well. In fact, one of most difficult aspects of flow control is that of treat-ing all sources fairly when it is necessary to <b>turn</b> <b>traffic</b> away from the network. In this paper, we proposed a flow control scheme which admits Max-Min fair-ness criterion for all sources. In fact, we formulated Max-Min fairness criterion for the NoC architecture and presented implementation to be used as flow con-trol mechanism...|$|R
50|$|Like the {{continuous}} flow intersection, the diverging diamond interchange allows for two-phase operation at all signalized intersections within the interchange. This {{is a significant}} improvement in safety, since no long turns (e.g. left <b>turns</b> where <b>traffic</b> drives {{on the right side}} of the road) must clear opposing traffic and all movements are discrete, with most controlled by traffic signals.|$|R
50|$|The superstreet {{typically}} requires four traffic light-controlled intersections, {{and most}} traffic must pass through two of them, but each light {{has only two}} phases, greatly increasing average traffic flow; {{there is no need}} for numerous left-turn phases where most traffic is waiting for only a few cars to clear the intersection. Turning movements on roads with lower cross-traffic volumes may be controlled with stop or yield signs for <b>turning</b> <b>traffic</b> rather than with signals.|$|E
50|$|The diamond {{interchange}} uses less space than most types of freeway interchange, and avoids the interweaving traffic flows {{that occur in}} interchanges such as the cloverleaf. Thus, {{diamond interchange}}s are most effective in areas where traffic is light and a more expensive interchange type is not needed. But where traffic volumes are higher, the two intersections within the interchange often feature additional traffic control measures such as traffic lights and extra lanes dedicated to <b>turning</b> <b>traffic.</b>|$|E
50|$|Traffic signals have {{strengths}} and weaknesses that must be considered when deciding whether to install them. Signaled intersections can reduce delay for side road traffic and reduce the occurrence of collisions by <b>turning</b> <b>traffic</b> and cross traffic. But they may also cause delay for traffic on the main road, and often increase rear-end collisions by up to 50%. Since right-angled and turn-against-traffic collisions {{are more likely to}} result in injuries, this is often an acceptable trade-off.|$|E
50|$|Prohibiting <b>turns</b> for <b>traffic</b> {{across the}} bus lane {{significantly}} reduces delays to the buses. Bus priority will often be provided at signalized intersections to reduce delays by extending the green phase or reducing the red {{phase in the}} required direction compared to the normal sequence.

50|$|A jughandle {{is a type}} of ramp or {{slip road}} that changes the way <b>traffic</b> <b>turns</b> left at an {{at-grade}} intersection (in a country where traffic drives on the right). Instead of a standard left turn being made from the left lane, left-turning traffic uses a ramp {{on the right side of}} the road. In a standard forward jughandle or near-side jughandle, the ramp leaves before the intersection, and left-turning <b>traffic</b> <b>turns</b> left off it rather than the through road. Right turns are also made using the jughandle.|$|R
