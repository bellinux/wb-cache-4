5|$|Benn's mother, Margaret Wedgwood Benn (née Holmes, 1897–1991), was a theologian, {{feminist and}} the founder President of the Congregational Federation. She {{was a member of}} the League of the Church Militant, which was the {{predecessor}} of the Movement for the Ordination of Women; in 1925, she was rebuked by Randall Davidson, the Archbishop of Canterbury, for advocating the ordination of women. His mother's theology had a profound influence on Benn, as she taught him that the stories in the Bible were based around the struggle between the prophets and the kings and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>ought</b> in his life to support the prophets over the kings, who had power, as the prophets taught righteousness.|$|E
5|$|Musidora: The Bather 'At the Doubtful Breeze Alarmed, {{also known}} as The Bather, is a name given to four nearly {{identical}} oil paintings on canvas by English artist William Etty. The paintings illustrate a scene from James Thomson's 1727 poem Summer in which a young man accidentally sees a young woman bathing naked, and is torn between his desire to look and his knowledge <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>ought</b> to look away. The scene was popular with English artists as {{it was one of}} the few legitimate pretexts to paint nudes at a time when the display and distribution of nude imagery was suppressed.|$|E
5|$|NASA takes both Homer and Barney to Cape Canaveral for training. As {{only one}} of them can go into space, they soon find {{themselves}} in competition. Under NASA's alcohol ban, the newly sober Barney quickly develops superior skills and is selected to fly with astronauts Buzz Aldrin and Race Banyon. However, when Barney toasts his victory with non-alcoholic champagne, he inexplicably reverts to his normal alcoholic self and escapes, stealing a jetpack and crashing into a nearby pillow factory. Homer wins by default and is selected for space flight, but after watching an episode of Itchy and Scratchy involving space exploration, he becomes very nervous about going. Just as they prepare to take off in the Corvair space shuttle, Homer runs away. He talks with Marge on the phone, and she says <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>ought</b> {{to take advantage of the}} opportunity. He agrees, and the launch, which is also a Nielsen ratings smash, proceeds.|$|E

25|$|The {{question}} of A's beliefs is no different. If A honestly believes that B {{is only slightly}} injured and so could move himself out of danger without difficulty, how fair is it to say <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>ought</b> to have foreseen? The test is what the reasonable person would have known and foreseen, given what A had done. It is the function of any court to evaluate behaviour. A defendant cannot evade responsibility through a form of wilful blindness. Fault lies not only in what a person actually believes, but also in failing {{to understand what the}} vast majority of other people would have understood. Hence, the test is hybrid, looking both at what the defendant actually knew and foresaw (i.e. subjective), and at what the reasonable person would have known (i.e. objective) and then combining the conclusions into a general evaluation of the degree of fault or blameworthiness.|$|E
25|$|Thurman's {{involvement}} {{in identifying the}} fragment later proved controversial because of a 1997 report on the FBI Laboratory, unrelated to the PA 103 investigation, written by U.S. Inspector-General Michael Bromwich, which concluded that Thurman had altered lab reports in ways that had rendered them inaccurate, and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>ought</b> {{to be transferred to}} a position outside the FBI lab (The Wall Street Journal, September 26, 1997). Thurman was not called to testify. Potentially also damaging to the Crown's case as presented at the trial, the testimony of Thurman's UK counterpart, DERA's Alan Feraday, has now been called into question. In three separate cases where Feraday had been the expert witness, men against whom he gave evidence have had their convictions overturned. And, thirdly, Dr Thomas Hayes was castigated for his failure to test the timer fragment for explosives residue, even though at the trial he maintained that the fragment was too small to test. Defence counsel contrasted Hayes' testimony with that of two of his colleagues (Elliott and Higgs) at DERA's forensic laboratory who, as revealed in the notorious Maguire Seven trial, had tested minute samples from underneath the fingernails of the suspects for explosives residue. In another important development, a retired senior Scottish police chief added fuel to the timer fragment fire by claiming that the CIA planted this crucial piece of evidence.|$|E
25|$|England's innings – like Australia's – {{revolved}} around their opener, {{in this case}} Len Hutton, who became the second Englishman to carry his bat through an innings against Australia, the other being Bobby Abel's 132 not out at Sydney in 1891–92. Hutton made 156 not out in England's 272, hit 11 fours and nobody else made 30. Ray Lindwall (3/51) dismissed Cyril Washbrook for 2 when the pedestrian Jack Iverson took a high, leaping catch when the batsmen heaved {{the ball to the}} leg-side. The spinners were soon on and Hutton hit Ian Johnson for two boundaries. He went two yards down the wicket and was almost stumped by Don Tallon for 34, but he nicked the ball and the deflection made Tallon miss both the catch and the stumping. Reg Simpson was the second highest scorer with 29 and together they added 83 for the second wicket before Simpson was bowled by the left-arm bowler Bill Johnston and England finished the day 96/2. The following morning Lindwall and Miller argued with Tallon <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>ought</b> to stand three yards closer to the stumps as the pitch was so slow. He refused and Lindwall bowled at a reduced pace, so nudged by Miller Tallon moved up for the third ball, which nicked Denis Compton's bat and the keeper took the catch low off the ground. Had he remained back Tallon could not have made the catch. The other England batsmen made a steady procession to and from the wicket as Bill Johnston (3/68) and Iverson (3/58) worked their way through the order as Hutton batted serenely on, now untouchable by any of the bowlers. David Sheppard almost ran Hutton out when he rushed down the wicket to get off the mark, Godfrey Evans tried to do the same, but Hutton wisely ignored him and the keeper scrambled back before his wicket was wrecked by Lindwall. Freddie Brown was caught leg before by Miller (1/30), who immediately appealed and Umpire Cocks gave him out, then the ball rolled back onto his stumps and knocked off a bail, so he ended up being bowled. Debutant Roy Tattersall was crowded by the Australian fielders and was caught by Neil Harvey off Iverson for a duck. John Warr was bowled for another duck by Bill Johnston. Doug Wright came in at 219/9 and held off the Australian attack for over an hour as he and Hutton added 53 for the last wicket, resembling their last stand at Brisbane. Lindwall wasn't recalled to the attack until after 5 o'clock and promptly caught the Kent spinner leg before wicket for 14. England were out for 272, 99 runs behind Australia and Hutton was applauded off the field by the Australian team.|$|E

500|$|For {{the trials}} match between the Probables and the Possibles on 18 December 1910 at Colombes, Guillemin {{played for the}} Probables and was then {{selected}} for France. G. Neumeyer writing in la Culture physique, considered that the selectors had {{made the right choice}} of XV, with the exception of Guillemin. In his opinion, it was deplorable that he should be selected, noting his [...] "remarkable brutality", proof of which he demonstrated in the trials match, and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>ought</b> to be thrown out of the national team for all time. Reichel in Le Figaro agreed that Guillemin's play was more violent than effective and would have preferred the selection of Berneron, who did [...] "great work" [...] for the Possibles.|$|E
500|$|Later songs {{performed}} by Blaine and the Warblers became popular {{enough to warrant}} a Warbler soundtrack album, Glee: The Music Presents the Warblers. The tracks had sold over 1.3million copies as singles {{by the time the}} album was released. Blaine performed the lead vocal on covers of Train's [...] "Hey, Soul Sister", which peaked at number 32 in Canada, [...] "Bills, Bills, Bills" [...] by Destiny's Child, which reached number 44 in the U.S., and Robin Thicke's [...] "When I Get You Alone", which got to number 47 on the Billboard Hot 100. Criss downplayed his performance of [...] "Bills, Bills, Bills", and jested <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>ought</b> to issue the group's lead singer, Beyoncé Knowles, an apology for his cover.

500|$|Bradley {{develops}} {{a theory about}} Hamlet's moral agony relating to a conflict between [...] "traditional" [...] and [...] "critical" [...] conscience: [...] "The conventional moral ideas of his time, which he shared with the Ghost, told him plainly <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>ought</b> to avenge his father; but a deeper conscience in him, which was in advance of his time, contended with these explicit conventional ideas. It is because this deeper conscience remains below the surface that he fails to recognise it, and fancies he is hindered by cowardice or sloth or passion or what not; but it emerges into light in that speech to Horatio. And it is just because he has this nobler moral nature in him that we admire and love him". The opening words of Shakespeare's Sonnet 94 ("They that have pow'r to hurt, and will do none") have been admired as a description of conscience. So has John Donne's commencement of his poem : [...] "Let man's soul be a sphere, and then, in this, Th' intelligence that moves, devotion is;" ...|$|E

500|$|Angelou {{was deeply}} {{depressed}} {{in the months}} following King's assassination, so to help lift her spirits, Baldwin brought her to a dinner party at the home of cartoonist Jules Feiffer and his wife Judy in late 1968. [...] The guests began telling stories of their childhoods and Angelou's stories impressed Judy Feiffer. The next day she called Robert Loomis at Random House, who became Angelou's editor throughout her long writing career until he retired in 2011, and [...] "told him <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>ought</b> to get this woman to write a book". At first, Angelou refused, since she thought of herself as a poet and playwright. According to Angelou, Baldwin had a [...] "covert hand" [...] in getting her to write the book, and advised Loomis to use [...] "a little reverse psychology", and reported that Loomis tricked her into it by daring her: [...] "It's just as well", he said, [...] "because to write an autobiography as literature is just about impossible". [...] Angelou was unable to resist a challenge, and she began writing Caged Bird. After [...] "closeting herself" [...] in London, it took her two years to write it.

500|$|In the House, as {{the session}} began at 4:30 pm, the Whig MP Henry Brougham, a leading {{opponent}} of the Orders, {{drew attention to the}} Prime Minister's absence and remarked <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>ought</b> to be there. A messenger was sent to fetch Perceval from Downing Street, but met him in Parliament Street (Perceval having decided to walk and dispense with his usual carriage) {{on his way to the}} House, where he arrived at about 5:15. As Perceval entered the lobby, he was confronted by Bellingham who, drawing a pistol, shot the Prime Minister in the chest. Perceval staggered forward a few steps and exclaimed [...] "I am murdered!" [...] before falling face down at the feet of William Smith, the MP for Norwich. (It was also variously reported Perceval had said [...] "Murder" [...] or [...] "Oh my God".) Smith only realised that the victim was Perceval when he turned the body face upwards. By the time he had been carried into an adjoining room and propped up on a table with his feet on two chairs, he was senseless, although there was still a faint pulse. When a surgeon arrived a few minutes later, the pulse had stopped, and Perceval was declared dead.|$|E
500|$|At his peak in 1882, Crossland was {{considered}} one of the fastest bowlers in England, and his yorker were described as W. G. Grace as being [...] "exceedingly difficult to play." [...] In his Wisden obituary, it was reported that [...] "the majority of experts having no hesitation in describing him as a rank thrower." [...] Grace was scarcely kinder, noting that he was [...] "inclined to think <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>ought</b> to have been no-balled in every over." [...] Despite the widespread opinion against his action, the umpires, themselves professional, were reluctant to no ball him. There was a feeling in the press that the biggest fault lay with the cricket authorities; both the umpires and the MCC; The Daily News, echoed by Cricket magazine, said that [...] "no blame can possibly attach to a bowler who continues a delivery which is habitual with him ... when the proper authorities decline [...] their disapproval of it." [...] As a batsman, he was an aggressive tail-ender, while he {{was considered}} a good fielder with a long throw. In all first-class matches, Crossland claimed 322 wickets at an average of 10.95. He took ten wickets in a match on six occasions, and five wickets in an innings 25 times. He scored 1,172 runs with a high score of 51.|$|E

500|$|In ancient Greece, Alcibiades was a {{polarizing}} figure. According to Thucydides, Alcibiades, being [...] "exceedingly ambitious", {{proposed the}} expedition in Sicily in order [...] "to gain in wealth and reputation {{by means of}} his successes". Alcibiades is not held responsible by Thucydides {{for the destruction of}} Athens, since [...] "his habits gave offence to every one, and caused the Athenians to commit affairs to other hands, and thus before long to ruin the city". Plutarch regards him as [...] "the least scrupulous and most entirely careless of human beings". On the other hand, Diodorus argues that he was [...] "in spirit brilliant and intent upon great enterprises". Sharon Press of Brown University points out that Xenophon emphasizes Alcibiades's service to the state, rather than the harm he was charged with causing it. Demosthenes defends Alcibiades's achievements, saying that he had taken arms in the cause of democracy, displaying his patriotism, not by gifts of money or by speeches, but by personal service. For Demosthenes and other orators, Alcibiades epitomized the figure of the great man during the glorious days of the Athenian democracy and became a rhetorical symbol. One of Isocrates' speeches, delivered by Alcibiades the Younger, argues that the statesman deserved the Athenians' gratitude for the service he had given them. Lysias, on the other hand, argued in one of his orations that the Athenians should regard Alcibiades as an enemy because of the general tenor of his life, as [...] "he repays with injury the open assistance of any of his friends". In the Constitution of the Athenians, Aristotle does not include Alcibiades in the list of the best Athenian politicians, but in Posterior Analytics he argues that traits of a proud man like Alcibiades are [...] "equanimity amid the vicissitudes of life and impatience of dishonor". Alcibiades excited in his contemporaries a fear {{for the safety of the}} political order. Therefore, Andocides said of him that [...] "instead of holding <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>ought</b> himself to conform with the laws of the state, he expects you to conform with his own way of life". Central to the depiction of the Athenian statesman is Cornelius Nepos' famous phrase that Alcibiades [...] "surpassed all the Athenians in grandeur and magnificence of living".|$|E

This virtue, one of the noblest with which man is endowed, seems to arise incidentally from our sympathies becoming more tender and more widely diffused, until they are extended to all sentient beings. As soon as this virtue is honored and practiced by some few men, it spreads through instruction and example to the young, and eventually becomes incorporated in public opinion.|$|E
