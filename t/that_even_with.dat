5|$|Although the {{creation}} of literature was predominantly a male scribal pursuit, some works {{are thought to have}} been written by women. For example, several references to women writing letters and surviving private letters sent and received by women have been found. However, Edward F. Wente asserts <b>that,</b> <b>even</b> <b>with</b> explicit references to women reading letters, it is possible that women employed others to write documents.|$|E
5|$|It {{was noted}} that the naming process would remain stalled without such rules, and <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>with</b> them, few of these bodies can be imaged with {{sufficient}} resolution to determine their shapes. Therefore, the IAU announced in 2008 that for naming purposes, a trans-Neptunian object will be {{assumed to be a}} plutoid if it has an absolute magnitude brighter than H = +1 magnitude.|$|E
5|$|Warren and her {{daughter}} Amelia Tyagi wrote The Two-Income Trap: Why Middle-Class Mothers and Fathers Are Going Broke. Warren and Tyagi point out that a fully employed worker today earns less inflation-adjusted income than a fully employed worker did 30years ago. Although families spend less today on clothing, appliances, and other consumption, the costs of core expenses such as mortgages, health care, transportation, and child care have increased dramatically. The result is <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>with</b> two income earners, families are {{no longer able to}} save and have incurred greater and greater debt.|$|E

5|$|Combat {{was also}} criticized. Reviewers called it poor, clumsy, and unsatisfactory, {{complaining}} that Bloodlines favors melee combat; firearms were weak, unwieldy and slow, even for characters specializing in guns. PC Zone, however, called the first-person shooting entertaining and challenging. Although melee combat was criticized as sluggish and difficult due to enemy attacks interrupting the player's, reviewers considered it overpowered; according to GameSpot, a boss character was killed with melee weapons {{on a first}} attempt after the repeated {{failure to do so}} with a gun. The New York Times found the unavoidable combat in {{the last part of the}} game to be so difficult that they had to cheat to succeed. Stealth was criticized, with IGN noting <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>with</b> low stealth skill it was possible to sneak around many enemies and feed from a guard without alerting another guard next to them. GameSpot opined that some of the best missions were stealth-based, as combat was more straightforward.|$|E
5|$|In 1950, {{calculations}} by the Polish mathematician Stanislaw Ulam and his collaborator Cornelius Everett, {{along with}} confirmations by Fermi, {{had shown that}} not only was Teller's earlier estimate of the quantity of tritium needed for the H-bomb a low one, but <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>with</b> higher amounts of tritium, the energy loss in the fusion process would be too great to enable the fusion reaction to propagate. However, in 1951 Teller and Ulam made a breakthrough, and invented a new design, proposed in a classified March 1951 paper, On Heterocatalytic Detonations I: Hydrodynamic Lenses and Radiation Mirrors, for a practical megaton-range H-bomb. The exact contribution provided respectively from Ulam and Teller to {{what became known as the}} Teller–Ulam design is not definitively known in the public domain, and the exact contributions of each and how the final idea was arrived upon has been a point of dispute in both public and classified discussions since the early 1950s.|$|E
5|$|In June 1947, the {{military}} requirements were updated and the Model 464-17 met {{all of them}} except for the range. It was becoming obvious to the Air Force <b>that,</b> <b>even</b> <b>with</b> the updated performance, the XB-52 would be obsolete {{by the time it}} entered production and would offer little improvement over the Convair B-36; as a result, the entire project was postponed for six months. During this time, Boeing continued to perfect the design, which resulted in the Model 464-29 with a top speed of 455miles per hour (395kn, 730km/h) and a 5,000-mile range. In September 1947, the Heavy Bombardment Committee was convened to ascertain performance requirements for a nuclear bomber. Formalized on 8 December 1947, these requirements called for a top speed of 500miles per hour (440kn, 800km/h) and an 8,000mile (7,000nmi, 13,000km) range, far beyond the capabilities of 464-29.|$|E

5|$|It is {{estimated}} {{that as much as}} another 1.2 GW of capacity remains available to exploit, mostly in the form of micro and small-hydro developments such as the existing one in Knoydart and a system planned for Kingussie. In reality, environmental constraints and given that the most easily available catchment areas have already been exploited {{it is unlikely that the}} full 1.2 GW will exploited. The 100 MW Glendoe Project which opened in 2009 was the first large scale dam in Scotland for almost fifty years but is likely to be one of the last of its kind. There is also further potential for new pumped storage schemes (at present used to meet peak demand) that would work with intermittent sources of power such as wind and wave. Examples include the 440 MW Cruachan Dam and 300 MW Falls of Foyers schemes. A 2011 report calculated that pumped storage hydro capacity could supply 2.8 GW of electricity for 5 hours, then drop to 1.1 GW and run out of water in 22 hours. The report concluded <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>with</b> projected new schemes at Loch Ness and Loch Sloy, pumped storage would not be able to replace wind electricity during extended windless periods.|$|E
5|$|The {{results of}} the Outer Solar System Survey (OSSOS) {{suggests}} that the observed clustering {{is the result of}} a combination of observing bias and small number statistics. OSSOS, a well-characterized survey of the outer Solar System with known biases, observed eight trans-Neptunian objects with semi-major axis > 150 AU with orbits oriented on a wide range of directions. After accounting for the known observational biases of the survey, no evidence for the arguments of perihelion (ω) clustering identified by Trujillo and Sheppard was seen and the orientation of the orbits of the objects with the largest semi-major axis was statistically consistent with random. A previously released paper by Mike Brown analyzed the discovery locations of eccentric trans-Neptunian objects. While identifying some biases he found <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>with</b> these biases the clustering of longitudes of perihelion of the known objects would be observed only 1.2% of the time if their actual distribution was uniform.|$|E
5|$|All the {{alkali metals}} react readily with {{phosphorus}} and arsenic to form phosphides and arsenides with the formula M3Pn (where M represents an alkali metal and Pn represents a pnictogen – phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, or bismuth). This {{is due to}} the greater size of the P3− and As3− ions, so that less lattice energy needs to be released for the salts to form. These are not the only phosphides and arsenides of the alkali metals: for example, potassium has nine different known phosphides, with formulae K3P, K4P3, K5P4, KP, K4P6, K3P7, K3P11, KP10.3, and KP15. While most metals form arsenides, only the alkali and alkaline earth metals form mostly ionic arsenides. The structure of Na3As is complex with unusually short Na–Na distances of 328–330 pm which are shorter than in sodium metal, and this indicates <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>with</b> these electropositive metals the bonding cannot be straightforwardly ionic. Other alkali metal arsenides not conforming to the formula M3As are known, such as LiAs, which has a metallic lustre and electrical conductivity indicating the presence of some metallic bonding. The antimonides are unstable and reactive as the Sb3− ion is a strong reducing agent; reaction of them with acids form the toxic and unstable gas stibine (SbH3). Indeed, they have some metallic properties, and the alkali metal antimonides of stoichiometry MSb involve antimony atoms bonded in a spiral Zintl structure. Bismuthides are not even wholly ionic; they are intermetallic compounds containing partially metallic and partially ionic bonds.|$|E
