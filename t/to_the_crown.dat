5|$|A royal hunting park {{close to}} Melbourne was {{probably}} created by King John around 1200, and the King {{is known to}} have stayed at the manor house on at least five occasions. John gave the manor and its lands to Hugh Beauchamp, although they appear to have soon reverted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>crown,</b> being gifted by Henry III to Bishop Walter Mauclerk of Carlisle in about 1230. The estate returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>crown</b> on the bishop's death in 1248, and Henry granted the land to his son, Edmund Crouchback, 1st Earl of Lancaster, in 1265. At some later date, the manor appears to have been granted to a Philip Marc, before passing to Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster, the King's son. This was in 1298 when he came of age, his father having died two years earlier. Early references to the house itself are rare, but there are records of repairs to the gutters in 1246 and to the roof of the King's Chamber in 1248.|$|E
5|$|Although {{previously}} favourable <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Crown,</b> the Cavalier Parliament was alienated by the king's {{wars and}} religious policies during the 1670s. In 1672, Charles issued the Royal Declaration of Indulgence, {{in which he}} purported to suspend all penal laws against Catholics and other religious dissenters. In the same year, he openly supported Catholic France and started the Third Anglo-Dutch War.|$|E

5|$|In 1270 Roger Bigod, the 5th Earl, {{inherited}} the castle and undertook extensive renovations there whilst living in considerable luxury and style. Although still extremely wealthy, the Bigods were now having to borrow increasing sums from first the Jewish community at Bungay and then, after {{the expulsion of}} the Jews, Italian merchants; {{by the end of}} the century, Roger was heavily in debt to Edward I as well. As a result, Roger led the baronial opposition to Edward's request for additional taxes and support for his French wars. Edward responded by seizing Roger's lands and only releasing them on the condition that Roger granted them <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Crown</b> after his death. Roger agreed and Framlingham Castle passed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Crown</b> on his death in 1306.|$|E

5|$|In the Northern Isles, James's cousin Patrick Stewart, Earl of Orkney, {{resisted}} the Statutes of Iona and was consequently imprisoned.

5|$|It is {{probable}} {{that the idea of}} annulment (not divorce as commonly assumed) had suggested itself to Henry much earlier than this and was motivated by his desire for an heir to secure the Tudor claim <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>crown.</b> Before Henry's father Henry VII ascended the throne, England was beset by civil warfare over rival claims <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>crown</b> and Henry wanted to avoid a similar uncertainty over the succession. He and Catherine had no living sons: all Catherine's children except Mary died in infancy. Catherine of Aragon had first come to England to be bride to Henry's brother Arthur who died soon after their marriage. Since Spain and England still wanted an alliance, a dispensation was granted by Pope Julius II on the grounds that Catherine was still a virgin.|$|E
5|$|John rewarded William for {{his service}} with churches in Sheppey and East Malling, which were granted in 1207, {{and the right}} to oversee the royal forests in Cornwall and Devon.

5|$|After Cerezeda took {{most of the}} {{inhabitants}} of Trujillo into Higueras, the city entered a period of serious decline.
