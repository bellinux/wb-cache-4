5|$|The {{following}} is a timeline of <b>the</b> <b>Manhattan</b> Project. It includes a number of events prior to the official formation of <b>the</b> <b>Manhattan</b> Project, {{and a number of}} events after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, until <b>the</b> <b>Manhattan</b> Project was formally replaced by the Atomic Energy Commission in 1947.|$|E
5|$|At the {{invitation}} of the director of <b>the</b> <b>Manhattan</b> Project, Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, Jr, Bohr visited <b>the</b> <b>Manhattan</b> Project sites in November 1943. Groves offered Bohr substantial pay, but Bohr initially refused the offer {{because he wanted to}} make sure that the relationship between the United States and Great Britain remained a real cooperative partnership. In December 1943, after a meeting with Albert Einstein, Bohr and his son Aage committed to working on <b>the</b> <b>Manhattan</b> Project. Bohr made a substantial contribution to the atomic bomb development effort. He also attempted to prevent an atomic arms race with the Soviet Union after the war, which he believed to be a serious threat. In 1944, Bohr made several key points he believed to be essential towards international nuclear weapon control. He urged that Britain and the United States should inform the Soviet Union about <b>the</b> <b>Manhattan</b> Project in order to decrease the likelihood of it feeling threatened on the premise that the other nations were building a bomb behind their back. His beliefs stemmed from the fact that he was convinced the Russians already knew about <b>the</b> <b>Manhattan</b> Project, which therefore led him to believe that there was no point in hiding it from them.|$|E

The Sixth Avenue Line would also be {{connected}} to the Williamsburg and Manhattan Bridges. The connection between the Nassau Street Line and <b>the</b> <b>Manhattan</b> Bridge south tracks would be eliminated. This would allow for thirty additional trains to operate between Midtown Manhattan and Brooklyn.|$|E

5|$|Following a {{domestic}} {{debate over the}} permanent management of the nuclear program, the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) {{was created by the}} Atomic Energy Act of 1946 to take over the functions and assets of <b>the</b> <b>Manhattan</b> Project. It established civilian control over atomic development, and separated the development, production and control of atomic weapons from the military. Military aspects were taken over by the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project (AFSWP). Although <b>the</b> <b>Manhattan</b> Project ceased to exist on 31 December 1946, <b>the</b> <b>Manhattan</b> District would remain until it too was abolished on 15 August 1947.|$|E

5|$|In early 1944, Smyth {{raised the}} {{possibility}} of producing an unclassified report for the general public on the achievements of <b>the</b> <b>Manhattan</b> Project. The director of the Metallurgical Laboratory, Arthur Compton, supported the idea. He arranged a meeting with James B. Conant, the President of Harvard University and one of the senior administrators of <b>the</b> <b>Manhattan</b> Project, who had similar thoughts. Conant took up the matter with <b>the</b> <b>Manhattan</b> Project's director, Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr.. In April, Smyth received a formal letter from Groves asking him to write such a report. Both the report and the choice of Smyth as its author were approved by <b>the</b> <b>Manhattan</b> Project’s governing body, the Military Policy Committee, in May 1944.|$|E

Groves had Lansdale transferred to <b>the</b> <b>Manhattan</b> District, but instead of placing him {{in charge of the}} new CIC unit, Groves made Lansdale his special assistant for security at Manhattan Project headquarters in Washington, D.C. Lansdale coordinated the activities of <b>the</b> <b>Manhattan</b> Project's field security teams with those of other agencies such as the FBI.|$|E

He {{was responsible for the}} health and safety of the thousands of personnel involved in <b>the</b> <b>Manhattan</b> Project. He was present at the Trinity nuclear test in Alamogordo, New Mexico where he was responsible for the safety aspects of the detonation of the world's first nuclear weapon.

5|$|A {{legacy of}} <b>the</b> <b>Manhattan</b> Project was {{the network of}} {{national}} laboratories, but none was located on the East Coast. Rabi and Ramsey assembled a group of universities in the New York area to lobby for their own national laboratory. When Zacharias, who was now at MIT, heard about it, {{he set up a}} rival group at MIT and Harvard. Rabi had discussions with Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., the director of <b>the</b> <b>Manhattan</b> Project, who was willing to go along with a new national laboratory, but only one. Moreover, while <b>the</b> <b>Manhattan</b> Project still had funds, the wartime organization was expected to be phased out when a new authority came into existence. After some bargaining and lobbying by Rabi and others, the two groups came together in January 1946. Eventually nine universities (Columbia, Cornell, Harvard, Johns Hopkins, MIT, Princeton, Pennsylvania, Rochester and Yale) came together, and on 31 January 1947 a contract was signed with the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), which had replaced <b>the</b> <b>Manhattan</b> Project, that established the Brookhaven National Laboratory.|$|E

Unusually, the contract did not require any guarantees from Kellogg that it could actually accomplish this task. Because {{the scope of the}} project was not well defined, Kellogg and <b>the</b> <b>Manhattan</b> District agreed to defer any financial details to a later, cost-plus contract, which was executed in April 1944. Kellogg was then paid $2.5 million.|$|E
