5|$|For {{the first}} time in U.S. history, SCATANA was invoked, thus {{stranding}} tens of thousands of passengers across the world. The FAA closed American airspace to all international flights, causing about five hundred flights <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>turned</b> back or redirected to other countries. Canada received 226 of the diverted flights and launched Operation Yellow Ribbon to deal with the large numbers of grounded planes and stranded passengers.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, {{the trailer}} {{was made into}} a {{full-length}} feature film starring Rutger Hauer as the hobo, with David Brunt playing a dirty cop. Hobo With a Shotgun was the second of Grindhouses fake trailers <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>turned</b> into a feature film, the first being Machete. The film was released March 25, 2011 in Canada, April 1, 2011 on American Video On Demand and May 6, 2011 in U.S. theatres.|$|E

5|$|The {{addition}} of the Clifton Maybank corridor, built in the 18th century from stone obtained from another house then undergoing alteration, allowed the principal ground- and first-floor rooms to have some privacy from the servants' areas and linked the two staircases. It also allowed the house <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>turned</b> around by creating a new entrance façade facing west.|$|E
5|$|The {{popularity}} of characters from Dark Forces resulted in LucasArts licensing toys {{based on the}} game. Hasbro produced Kyle Katarn and Dark Trooper toys, which are among the Star Wars expanded universe items <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>turned</b> into action figures. The Dark Troopers were also included in books and comics. William C. Dietz's novelizations of the Dark Forces storyline were adapted to full-cast audio dramatizations.|$|E
5|$|All intersections found {{along the}} route are grade separated, except for a single {{at-grade}} intersection currently regulated by traffic lights; a new route is planned to bypass this intersection. As of June 2012, there were tenexits and twoservice areas {{along the route}}. The motorway is currently toll-free except for the Učka Tunnel and the Kanfanar-Rogovići section. However, most of the motorway is potentially a toll road using a ticket system, with each exit including a toll plaza except those of Veprinac, Opatija, and Matulji. The toll system of the A8/A9 Istrian Y is integrated: no ticket needs <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>turned</b> in, gotten, or exchanged when going from the A8 to the A9 or vice versa.|$|E

5|$|Annie {{currently}} {{lives in}} Berlin, where she moved after being evicted {{from the apartment}} in Bergen {{she was living in}} because it was going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>turned</b> into a hotel. She owned a cat named Joey, whom she named after both Joey Ramone and Joey McIntyre of New Kids on the Block. Joey died on 29 January 2010. Annie is an avid reader and follows global politics. She is friends with musician Peaches. Her musical influences include Madonna, Saint Etienne, the Pet Shop Boys, and Kate Bush. She has a green belt in karate.|$|E
5|$|Disheartened, David {{falls from}} a ledge, but is rescued by Joe using their amphibicopter. David tells Joe {{he saw the}} Blue Fairy {{underwater}} and wants {{to go down to}} meet her. Joe is captured by the authorities using an electromagnet. David and Teddy use the amphibicopter to go to the Fairy, which {{turns out to be a}} statue at Coney Island. The two become trapped when the Wonder Wheel falls on their vehicle. David asks repeatedly <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>turned</b> into a real boy until the ocean freezes and is deactivated once his power source is drained.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, Hartmann's mother {{wrote to}} the new West German Chancellor, Konrad Adenauer, to whom she appealed to secure his freedom. A trade {{agreement}} between West Germany and the Soviet Union was reached, and Hartmann was released along with 16,000 German military personnel {{as one of the}} last Heimkehrer. After spending 10 {{and a half years in}} Soviet POW camps, he was among the last batch of prisoners <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>turned</b> over. Returning to West Germany, he was reunited with his wife Ursula, to whom he had written every day of the war.|$|E
50|$|In January {{the first}} of the seven {{replacement}} spokes, manufactured by BMC in the Latrobe Valley, <b>was</b> delivered <b>to</b> Docklands. In July the wheel <b>was</b> expected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>turning</b> again {{by the end of the}} year.|$|R

5|$|In 1995, {{the direct}} carpool lane ramps between I-5 and SR55 were completed; {{these were the}} first in Orange County. The year also saw further {{widening}} of SR55 between SR22 and McFadden Avenue. Between 1996 and 2002, the fifth lane in both directions was constructed between I-5 and SR91, funded with a sales tax of half a cent approved by Measure M. In April 2007, the Orange County Transportation Authority approved funds to study the feasibility of extending the Costa Mesa Freeway south to 17th Street via tunnels or flyover ramps. The segment of SR55 from Finley Street to the Newport Channel bridge was legally authorized <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>turned</b> over {{to the city of}} Newport Beach in 2009.|$|E
5|$|In {{the initial}} {{call to arms}} issued in 1861, Indiana was {{assigned}} a quota of 7,500 men—a tenth of the amount called—to join the Union Army in putting down the rebellion. So many volunteered in the first call that thousands had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>turned</b> away. Before the war ended, Indiana contributed 208,367men to fight and serve in the war. Casualties were over 35% among these men: 24,416 {{lost their lives in}} the conflict and over 50,000 more were wounded.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s Amtrak found {{itself with a}} supply of surplus Metroliner cars with {{problematic}} propulsion systems, but with sound body and frame, stored at their Wilmington and Bear shop complexes in Delaware. The coaches were, except for the propulsion systems, a near-identical match to Amfleet coaches. Twenty-nine of the 31 coaches were renumbered and used as cab control cars for corridor services. This allowed trains to operate in push-pull service, rather than needing <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>turned</b> around on a wye at terminals or to have a locomotive on each end.|$|E
5000|$|The term <b>is</b> {{also used}} <b>to</b> {{describe}} any random process. An example is selecting {{the winner of}} an election by drawing a name from a hat, said <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>turning</b> the process into a [...] "chook raffle".|$|R

5|$|Many booklet stamps can be {{identified}} by one non-perforated edge, though a few are perforated on all edges. On booklets up to 1977, the printing plate construction enabled both upright and inverted watermarks in equal quantities owing to a gutter dividing rows 6 and 7 in the sheets of 12 × 10 stamps. The gutter was used for stitching during assembly, requiring rows 4–6 and 10–12 <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>turned</b> through 180 degrees so those panes could be stitched on {{the left of the}} booklet.|$|E
5|$|Shelby {{pressured}} President James Madison to give Harrison {{command of}} all {{military forces in}} the Northwest. Madison acceded, rescinding his earlier appointment of James Winchester. On the state level, Shelby revised militia laws to make every male {{between the ages of}} 18 and 45 eligible for military service; ministers were excluded from the provision. Seven thousand volunteers enlisted, and many more had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>turned</b> away. Shelby encouraged the state's women to sew and knit items for Kentucky's troops.|$|E
5|$|Spencer begins {{experiencing}} visions, again {{seeing the}} Man in the Planet, {{as well as}} the Lady in the Radiator (Laurel Near), who sings to him as she stomps upon spermatozoon-like creatures. After a sexual encounter with the Beautiful Girl Across the Hall, Spencer has a vision where he is decapitated by a creature resembling the child, revealing a stump underneath that resembles the child's face. Soon afterwards, Spencer's head sinks into a pool of blood and falls from the sky, landing on a street below. A boy finds it, bringing it to a pencil factory <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>turned</b> into erasers.|$|E
50|$|If {{the wheel}} rotates {{a little more}} slowly than two {{revolutions}} per second, {{the position of the}} spokes <b>is</b> seen <b>to</b> fall a little further behind in each successive frame and therefore, the wheel will seem <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>turning</b> backwards.|$|R

5|$|Ten {{days after}} its premiere in Milan, Cannibal Holocaust was confiscated under {{the orders of}} a local magistrate, and Ruggero Deodato {{was arrested and charged}} with obscenity. As all copies were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>turned</b> over to the authorities, the film was {{distributed}} internationally via subterfuge. In January 1981, during the film's theatrical run in France, the magazine Photo suggested that certain deaths depicted in the film were real, which would have made Cannibal Holocaust a snuff film. Following the publication of the Photo article, the charges against Deodato were amended to include murder. The courts believed that the actors who portrayed the missing film crew and the native actress featured in the impalement scene were killed for the camera.|$|E
5|$|The 2011 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid is {{the first}} mass {{production}} car manufactured by Hyundai to include the warning sound system. In 2010 the carmaker {{decided to have a}} button on the Sonata Hybrid's instrument panel to turn the VESS on and off, but after the enactment of the Pedestrian Safety Enhancement Act of 2010, signed into law by President Obama in early 2011, and learning that the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration would not allow such switches to avoid the noise device <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>turned</b> off, Hyundai decided not to install the button, and the first Sonata Hybrids destined for the U.S. market had to be altered to remove the switch.|$|E
5|$|The current Causeway bridges were {{designed}} by E W C Godfrey, and built between 1947 and 1952. They were the first in Western Australia to use steel composite construction. Large roundabouts were also constructed {{at each end of}} the structure, to improve the flow of traffic. The opening of the Graham Farmer Freeway in 2000 reduced the traffic volume on the Causeway, allowing the two central lanes <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>turned</b> into bus lanes. By the early 2000s, the concrete structures had suffered significant damage. Cracks were repaired using carbon fibre reinforcement and localised patching, extending the bridge's life by decades. The Causeway bridges have been recognised for their heritage value by their entry on the Western Australian Register of Heritage Places.|$|E
