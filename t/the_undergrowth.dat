5|$|Flame robins {{often become}} more {{abundant}} in areas recently burnt by bushfires, but move away once <b>the</b> <b>undergrowth</b> regrows. They may also move into logged or cleared areas in forests. However, a field {{study in the}} Boola Boola State Forest in central Gippsland revealed they are not found {{in areas where the}} regrowth after logging is dense.|$|E
5|$|Adders are {{not usually}} aggressive, tending to be rather timid and biting only when cornered or alarmed. People are {{generally}} bitten only after stepping on them or attempting to pick them up. They will usually disappear into <b>the</b> <b>undergrowth</b> at a hint of any danger, but will return once all is quiet, often to the same spot. Occasionally, individual snakes will reveal their presence with a loud and sustained hissing, hoping to warn off potential aggressors. Often, these {{turn out to be}} pregnant females. When the adder is threatened, the front part of the body is drawn into an S-shape to prepare for a strike.|$|E
40|$|The spatial {{structure}} of <b>the</b> fir <b>undergrowth</b> vs. to <b>the</b> fir, aspen, and birch {{trees in the}} climax community of the fir-aspen-birch forest was analyzed by the method of R-functions. The analysis showed that <b>the</b> fir <b>undergrowth</b> is primarily concentrated near old fir trees, but near the fir stumps it is more rare than expected. This distribution of <b>the</b> fir <b>undergrowth</b> should {{have resulted in the}} decrease in area and number of fir population. <b>The</b> fir <b>undergrowth</b> concentrates <b>the</b> most near the small-leaved species, where dense fir clumps are formed. The populations of the small-leaved species are a stabilizing factor of the dominant population in the fir-aspen-birch forests...|$|R

5|$|The Act II {{illustration}} from Les Beautés shows a {{dark wood}} {{with a pool}} of water in the distance. The branches of aged trees create a tree tunnel. Beneath these branches on the left is a marble cross with 'Giselle' carved on it. From one of its arms hangs the crown of grape leaves Giselle wore as Queen of the Vintage. On the stage, thick weeds and wildflowers (200 bulrushes and 120 branches of flowers) were <b>the</b> <b>undergrowth.</b> The gas jets of the footlights and those overhead suspended in the flies were turned low to create a mood of mystery and terror.|$|E
5|$|The Shishugou Formation {{represents}} {{a variety of}} depositional environments, including alluvial fans and alluvial plains, streams, wetlands, and shallow lakes. During the time when Limusaurus lived, the environment would have been consistently warm and dry, judging by the abundance of coal and carbon-rich deposits. The climate was probably highly seasonal due to monsoonal influences, with warm, wet summers and dry winters. The climate enabled {{the growth of a}} richly forested environment; the forest would have been dominated by Araucaria trees, with <b>the</b> <b>undergrowth</b> being occupied by Coniopteris tree ferns, Anglopteris and Osmunda ferns, Equisetites horsetails, and Elatocladus shrubs.|$|E
5|$|The {{flight of}} the {{fieldfare}} is slow and direct. It takes several strong beats then closes its wings briefly before flapping on. It is highly gregarious, quite shy and easily scared {{in the winter and}} bold and noisy in the breeding season. When a group is in a tree they all tend to face in the same direction, keeping up a constant chatter. When foraging on the ground, often in association with redwings, the group works its way up wind, each bird pausing every so often to stand erect and gaze around before resuming feeding. When alarmed they fly off down wind and the feeding group reforms elsewhere. In woodland they do not skulk in <b>the</b> <b>undergrowth</b> as do blackbirds or song thrushes, instead they perch in the open on bushes and high branches. They roost socially, sometimes in overgrown hedges and shrubberies but usually on the ground. Common sites are in rough grass among bushes or clumps of rushes, in young plantations, on stubble and in the furrows of ploughed fields.|$|E

5|$|The two {{combined}} battalions began {{digging in}} around Isurava. A headquarters {{had been set}} {{up at the top of}} the hill, which was vital to the defence of the position. While the Australians dug themselves in, the Japanese, led by Japanese Major General Tomitarō Horii, prepared to attack. On 28 August, the Japanese launched their offensive. The Australians, who had initially been outnumbered but were now roughly equal in strength, resisted in the face of heavy machine-gun fire and hand-to-hand combat. On 29 August, the Japanese broke through the right flank, pushing the Australians back with heavy fire, threatening to cut off their headquarters. The Australians began to prepare a counter-offensive, and men volunteered to join an attack party. Kingsbury, one of the few survivors of his platoon, ran down the Track with the group. Using a Bren gun he had taken from wounded Corporal Lindsay Bear, Kingsbury, alongside Avery and the rest of the group, engaged the nearby Japanese. The fire was so heavy that <b>the</b> <b>undergrowth</b> was completely destroyed within five minutes. It was then that Kingsbury, firing from his hip, charged straight at the Japanese.|$|E

25|$|Many small reptiles, such as {{snakes and}} lizards that {{live on the}} ground or in the water, are {{vulnerable}} to being preyed on by all kinds of carnivorous animals.

25|$|Before King Kong entered production, a long {{tradition}} of jungle films existed, and, whether drama or documentary, such films generally adhered to a narrative pattern that followed an explorer or scientist into the jungle to test a theory only to discover some monstrous aberration in <b>the</b> <b>undergrowth</b> (see Stark Mad). In such films, scientific knowledge could be turned topsy-turvy at any time, and it was this that provided the genre with its vitality, appeal, and endurance.|$|E
