5|$|The {{national}} flag has {{a length of}} 2.20meters and a width of 1.47m, a ratio of 2 to 3. The field is split into three horizontal colored bands, a yellow band of one-half the flag's width, a blue band of one-quarter the width, and a red band of one-quarter the width. All three bands extend {{the full length of}} the flag. The flag is charged with the Ecuadorian coat of arms scaled to one-half the width of the flag and centered in the field. The coat of arms itself is constructed in a rectangle with proportions 12:10. The national standard has the same design as the {{national flag}}, but is square, with length 0.9m and width 0.9m. When used by military units and organizations, lettering can encircle the coat of arms with a diameter of 55 centimeters. The lettering must be 4cm in height, 3cm in width, gold-colored Roman font, embroidered with gold thread. The only other regulated size is a table flag (banderola) where the flag is 200mm wide and 300mm long. When manufacturing the national flag, sellers to the public must include the name of their company, along with <b>the</b> <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>manufacture,</b> by placing a 20 × 10mm tag on the reverse side of the flag on the sleeve.|$|E
25|$|Although many kiosks {{have been}} fitted with {{replacement}} backs over recent years, unmodified examples generally have the identity of their manufacturer marked on a plate on the outside {{at the bottom of}} their back panel. The only exceptions are the few Mk1 models made by Bratt Colbran, which are anonymous. A supplementary way of identifying the manufacturer is by means of casting marks on the various component parts – i.e. LF, CC, MF, MS and BC – which were used to various extents over the years. A more consistent manufacturer mark can be found at about shoulder height on the inner face of the back panel. These marks generally identify both the manufacturer and the precise model of kiosk. Up to around 1949, <b>the</b> <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>manufacture</b> is also included. The more recently erected non-BT K6 kiosks (generally painted black) are for the most part new castings, sourced from new manufacturers.|$|E
500|$|The Type 26 {{revolver}} {{was issued}} with a clamshell holster {{similar to the}} French Modèle 1892 revolver. [...] The earliest Type 26 holsters were black, and the cotton lanyards issued with them were a dark blue color known in Japan as kon. A leather pocket for the cleaning rod was provided, sewn onto the forward edge of the holster body. Most examples of holsters are stamped {{on the inside of}} the clamshell flap with the maker's identification and arsenal inspection markings with <b>the</b> <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>manufacture.</b> [...] Very early holsters, issued in the late 1890s and early 1900s, were of a slightly different size and shape and without a pocket for the cleaning rod. A few holsters developed in 1943 have been noted to be all black lacquered hardware, missing the brass and galvanized steel fittings. Holsters produced towards the end of World War II have a last ditch fabric similar to late production Type 94 Nambu pistol holsters, with no shoulder straps or pouches for cleaning rods and ammunition.|$|E
50|$|The Wanderer dinghy {{design has}} evolved during <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>manufacture,</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most {{significant}} early changes was {{the introduction of}} the MD modification. This was a modification to the distribution of buoyancy resulting in a reduction in the floating height of the boat after a capsize thus aiding recovery (and propitiously making the boat less likely to turn turtle).|$|R
50|$|The 356 is a {{lightweight}} and nimble-handling, rear-engine, rear-wheel drive, two-door, sports car available in hardtop coupé and open configurations. Engineering innovations continued during <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>manufacture,</b> contributing to its motorsports success and popularity. Production started in 1948 at Gmünd, Austria, where approximately 50 cars were built. In 1950 the factory relocated to Zuffenhausen, Germany, and general {{production of the}} 356 continued until April 1965, well after the replacement model 911 made its autumn 1963 debut. Of the 76,000 originally produced, approximately half survive.|$|R
5000|$|The retort bench was the {{construction}} {{in which the}} retorts were located for the carbonization (synonymous with pyrolysis) of the coal feedstock {{and the evolution of}} coal gas. Over <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>manufactured</b> gas production, advances were made that turned the retort-bench from little more than coal-containing iron vessels over an open fire to a massive, highly efficient, partially automated, industrial-scale, capital-intensive plant for the carbonization of large amounts of coal. Several retort benches were usually located in a single [...] "retort house", which there was at least one of in every gas works.|$|R
2500|$|... in 1985 {{a series}} of pieces were {{produced}} under the title The Bizarre Collection, with the mark for the [...] "Royal Staffordshire Pottery by Clarice Cliff", and marketed by the Midwinter pottery. These pieces were all hand painted, unlike some of the later production Wedgwood, and faithfully respected the original designs and production methods {{with the exception of}} the crocus conical sifter. The production actually took lace on the same premises as the original production line of the Newport pottery. [...] The 3 principal designs produced were Honolulu on a 12 inch Mei Ping vase, Summerhouse on a 13 inch [...] wall plate and a striking version of Umbrellas and Rain on a conical bowl. These pieces can be identified with a tiny impressed 85 for <b>the</b> <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>manufacture.</b> There was also a selection of 6 conical sugar sifters, again hand painted, {{with the exception of the}} aforementioned Crocus which was lithographed. Whilst the purists still scoff at these pieces some 30 years later they are actually a very accurate representation of the originals they were copied from and in themselves are now becoming sought after not least because they allow collectors to acquire excellent pieces and a more affordable price.|$|E

The data collated in this paper includes passenger vehicles <b>manufactured</b> <b>of</b> a span of 40  years however not all of the references provided <b>the</b> exact <b>year</b> <b>of</b> vehicle <b>manufacture</b> thus <b>the</b> experiments were divided into three age categories; experiments with <b>the</b> known <b>year</b> <b>of</b> vehicle manufacture; experiments with the known decade <b>of</b> vehicle <b>manufacture</b> and experiments with an estimated decade <b>of</b> vehicle <b>manufacture</b> based on the date of experiment, date of submission or publication of the source reference.

50|$|This {{model is}} unique in the 'trapdoor' series by being marked with <b>the</b> actual <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>manufacture</b> (1868, 1869, or 1870) on the breech-block. The 1868 marking is {{extremely}} rare with probably no more than 150 so marked; about 16,000 were marked 1869, with the remaining 36,000 being stamped 1870. As of December 2016, only 19 specimens are known with the 1868 date. Latest to surface are #62, #127 & #6.|$|R
