40|$|Control {{regions of}} <b>the</b> {{nopaline}} synthase (<b>nos)</b> gene {{have been widely}} used to express foreign genes in plants since the promoter is active {{in a wide variety of}} plant tissues. We report here the characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>nos</b> promoter activity in transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) plants at various developmental stages. The promoter was highly active in the lower parts of a plant and gradually decreased in the upper parts. This vertical gradient was maintained throughout plant growth until the flowering stage when the overall promoter strength decreased significantly in the vegetative organs. However, in various flower organs, <b>the</b> <b>nos</b> promoter activities increased dramatically. Higher activity was observed in calyx, corolla, and stamens although the maximum promoter activity in each organ was found at different stages of flower development. The promoter activity in pistils was low and gradually increased in the ovaries after anthesis. In developing fruits, <b>the</b> <b>nos</b> promoter activity was strongly induced during the mid-stage of embryogenesis. These results indicate that the expression of <b>the</b> <b>nos</b> promoter is developmentally regulated and organ specific in transgenic tobacco plants...|$|R
5|$|A pre-Le Mans testing day {{was held}} at the circuit on 31 May, {{involving}} all 56 entries as well as the KCMG Oreca-Nissan, Ibañez Oreca-Nissan, Gulf Racing Porsche, and Formula Racing Ferrari reserve entries. Two LMP3 class Ginetta vehicles and two additional AF Corse Ferrari cars also participated. The two four-hour sessions were held under mixed weather conditions as rain swept through the area several times. Neel Jani set the fastest time in the early session with a three minutes and 21.945 seconds for <b>the</b> <b>No.</b> 18 Porsche, but Hartley improved to a three minutes and 21.061 seconds in the sister No. 17 Porsche.

Laurens Vanthoor was the fastest LMP2 driver in <b>the</b> <b>No.</b> 34 OAK Ligier-Honda.

5|$|After {{over an hour}} {{behind the}} safety car, the field was {{released}} to race one last time with only twelve minutes remaining. With no close contests between the competitors, the field continued to run at less than racing pace, {{in preparation for the}} finish. <b>The</b> <b>No.</b> 8 Peugeot of Sébastien Bourdais briefly went into the pits, before returning to the track. To ensure that the Peugeot finished the race, and did not break down before crossing the finishing line behind the winner, Bourdais stopped at the Ford Chicanes on the final lap. Once <b>the</b> <b>No.</b> 1 Audi had gone past to take the checkered flag, Bourdais restarted the Peugeot and finished as well. <b>The</b> <b>No.</b> 16 Pescarolo finished the race in third, the highest placed petrol car.|$|E
5|$|After the pit stops Hartley {{remained}} {{the leader in}} <b>the</b> <b>No.</b> 1 Porsche while Jarvis moved in front of Lotterer because the latter had a longer pit stop.

The LMGTE field began making pit stops after 52 minutes when Darren Turner drove <b>the</b> <b>No.</b> 95 Aston Martin into his pit box while Fernando Rees in the sister No. 97 car was issued with a stop-and-go penalty for exceeding track limits. Both Ford cars moved into second and third in LMGTE Pro when <b>the</b> <b>No.</b> 77 Porsche had only fuel placed inside it. Turner overtook Priaulx for fourth place in LMGTE Pro while Christensen moved ahead of Mücke for second position in the category at Stowe corner. Merhi went wide at Copse corner, which allowed Nelson Panciatici to take advantage, and he overtook Merhi for fifth in LMP2. Kane passed González to move into second in the category. Panciatici heavily out-braked Cumming to claim fourth place while Piquet lost control of his car in an attempt to overtake the defensive Rossiter who kept eighth position.|$|E

5|$|As {{temperatures}} cooled in {{the final}} qualifying session, {{over a third of}} the field improved their fastest laps, but Jani's pole position time was unchallenged. Audi No. 7 led the session with a three minutes and 20.967 seconds lap time, still over four seconds shy of pole position. Nissan improved all three of their cars during the session, closing to within a second of the closest LMP1 competitor. <b>The</b> <b>No.</b> 26 G-Drive Ligier-Nissan closed to within a second of KCMG to take the second grid position in LMP2, while Greaves remained in third. In LMGTE Pro <b>the</b> <b>No.</b> 51 AF Corse Ferrari rebounded from the loss of their qualifying times in the first session to lead the final session and come within a tenth of a second of Aston Martin. The sister AF Corse Ferrari also improved to fourth in the category to split the top of the grid in the class amongst the two manufacturers. The lead in LMGTE Am remained with <b>the</b> <b>No.</b> 98 Aston Martin, a second and a half ahead of <b>the</b> <b>No.</b> 83 AF Corse Ferrari. SMP Racing improved their time by leading both of the day's qualifying sessions to take second place on the grid, splitting the Aston Martin cars. <b>The</b> <b>No.</b> 67 AAI Porsche suffered a fire during the session which halted qualifying for nearly half an hour.|$|E
5|$|As {{the race}} {{approached}} its halfway point, Lotterer gained on <b>the</b> <b>No.</b> 9 Audi {{and moved into}} second place, becoming Audi's lead challenger to Porsche. After leaving the pit lane, Pierre Ragues's No. 43 Morand car billowed smoke because of an oil pressure sensor failure and his vehicle caught fire, causing him to retire at Arnage corner. Several LMGTE cars {{took the opportunity to}} change brake discs {{at this point in the}} morning, including Fernando Rees in <b>the</b> <b>No.</b> 99 Aston Martin. Returning to the track Rees' car failed to stop in time for the first Mulsanne Straight chicane and hit the rear of the TDS Racing Oreca-Nissan. The Oreca, which had held second place in the LMP2 category, was abandoned in the gravel at the chicane while Rees limped the damaged Aston Martin back to the garage for repairs to its front-left corner. <b>The</b> <b>No.</b> 26 G-Drive Ligier took over second place in LMP2, although still a lap behind the leading KCMG Oreca while the lead in LMGTE Pro was now left to Jordan Taylor's No. 64 Corvette and <b>the</b> <b>No.</b> 51 AF Corse Ferrari of Bruni on the same lap. In the early morning <b>the</b> <b>No.</b> 7 Audi's hold on second place was relinquished when the right-rear bodywork of the car came apart on the circuit and littered debris at the Porsche Curves, requiring a seven-minute stop for repairs and dropping the car down the race order.|$|E
5|$|Audi's No. 7 car of André Lotterer, Marcel Fässler and Benoît Tréluyer won {{the pole}} {{position}} and maintained their advantage on the race's first lap. Lotterer initially {{pulled away from}} the field but lost the lead to Mark Webber in Porsche's No. 1 car who remained in the position. Co-driver Brendon Hartley remained in first until he retired following heavy contact with Michael Wainwright in <b>the</b> <b>No.</b> 86 Gulf Racing car. This handed the lead to Neel Jani in the sister No. 2 car, but it switched again to Tréluyer when Jani's co-driver Marc Lieb was delayed by a slower vehicle. Although he was challenged by Lieb after being blocked by slower cars Tréluyer pulled away from him and <b>the</b> <b>No.</b> 7 Audi maintained its advantage over <b>the</b> <b>No.</b> 2 Porsche {{for the majority of the}} remainder of the event to finish the race first. However <b>the</b> <b>No.</b> 7 Audi was disqualified when scrutineers discovered that its front skid block was worn out by more than the regulations allowed for, handing the victory to Lieb, Jani and Romain Dumas. Toyota No. 5 drivers Stéphane Sarrazin, Mike Conway and Kamui Kobayashi finished in second and Dominik Kraihamer, Alexandre Imperatori and Mathéo Tuscher came in third to secure Rebellion Racing's first podium in the series since 2013.|$|E
