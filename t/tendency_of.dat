5|$|It {{is thought}} that {{the total amount of}} iridium in the planet Earth is much higher than that {{observed}} in crustal rocks, but as with other platinum-group metals, the high density and <b>tendency</b> <b>of</b> iridium to bond with iron caused most iridium to descend below the crust when the planet was young and still molten.|$|E
5|$|Surface {{tension is}} the elastic <b>tendency</b> <b>of</b> a fluid surface {{which makes it}} acquire the least surface area possible. Surface tension allows insects (e.g. water striders), usually denser than water, to float and stride on a water surface.|$|E

Although the Royal Artillery consists of 13 Regular regiments (equivalent to infantry battalions), it calls itself the Royal Regiment of Artillery when referring to the units as a whole. The Royal Logistic Corps and Intelligence Corps are not corps-sized, but consist of several battalions or regiments.|$|E

5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War II, in 1939, the International Secretariat was moved to New York City. The resident International Executive Committee failed to meet, largely because of a struggle in the U.S. Socialist Workers Party (SWP) between Trotsky's supporters and the <b>tendency</b> <b>of</b> Max Shachtman, Martin Abern and James Burnham. The secretariat was composed of those committee members {{who happened to be}} in the city, most of whom were co-thinkers of Shachtman. The disagreement centred on the Shachtmanites' disagreements with the SWP's internal policy, and over the FI's unconditional defence of the USSR.|$|E
5|$|Electron-beam {{lithography}} (EBL) is {{a method}} of etching semiconductors at resolutions smaller than a micrometer. This technique is limited by high costs, slow performance, the need to operate the beam in the vacuum and the <b>tendency</b> <b>of</b> the electrons to scatter in solids. The last problem limits the resolution to about 10nm. For this reason, EBL is primarily used {{for the production of}} small numbers of specialized integrated circuits.|$|E
5|$|Electronegativity is the <b>tendency</b> <b>of</b> an atom {{to attract}} electrons. An atom's {{electronegativity}} {{is affected by}} both its atomic number and {{the distance between the}} valence electrons and the nucleus. The higher its electronegativity, the more an element attracts electrons. It was first proposed by Linus Pauling in 1932. In general, electronegativity increases on passing from left to right along a period, and decreases on descending a group. Hence, fluorine is the most electronegative of the elements, while caesium is the least, at least of those elements for which substantial data is available.|$|E

5|$|Identified {{risk factors}} for plantar {{fasciitis}} include excessive running, standing on hard surfaces for prolonged periods of time, high arches of the feet, {{the presence of a}} leg length inequality, and flat feet. The <b>tendency</b> <b>of</b> flat feet to excessively roll inward during walking or running makes them more susceptible to plantar fasciitis. Obesity is seen in 70% of individuals who present with plantar fasciitis and is an independent risk factor.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the cargo}} is discharged, the crew begins {{to clean the}} holds. This is {{particularly}} important if the next cargo is of a different type.

Children can accidentally place their hands on top of the stove, playing with the materials while being cooked, or accidentally pull the pot down, which can cause significant injury. The utmost care should be used when deep frying when children are present, to protect their safety at all times.|$|E

5|$|Telangiectasias and {{arteriovenous}} malformations in HHT {{are thought}} to arise because of changes in angiogenesis, the development of blood vessels out of existing ones. The {{development of a new}} blood vessel requires the activation and migration of various types of cells, chiefly endothelium, smooth muscle and pericytes. The exact mechanism by which the HHT mutations influence this process is not yet clear, and it is likely that they disrupt a balance between pro- and antiangiogenic signals in blood vessels. The wall of telangiectasias is unusually friable, which explains the <b>tendency</b> <b>of</b> these lesions to bleed.|$|E

As the <b>tendency</b> <b>of</b> a drop to spread out over a flat, solid surface increases, the contact angle decreases. Thus, the contact angle provides an inverse measure of wettability.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the values and {{academic}} dishonesty <b>tendencies</b> <b>of</b> teacher candidates. The population of this study included teacher candidates who received pedagogic formation education during 2013 - 2014 academic semester at the Faculty of Education at Ege University. The study was conducted with 244 teacher candidates, who were chosen through convenient sampling method. Academic Dishonesty Tendency Scale and Portrait Values Questionnaire were used to collect data. It was a correlational study due to the investigation of the relationship between values and academic dishonesty <b>tendencies</b> <b>of</b> teacher candidates. It was also a survey study since the academic dishonesty <b>tendencies</b> and values <b>of</b> teacher candidates were examined in relation to demographic variables. The results suggested that there wass a significant difference between the values and academic dishonesty <b>tendencies</b> <b>of</b> teacher candidates for gender variable. The values and academic dishonesty <b>tendencies</b> <b>of</b> teacher candidates did not differ for different fields of study. There was not a significant relationship between the academic dishonesty <b>tendencies</b> and values <b>of</b> teacher candidates...|$|R

5|$|The known fossil {{material}} of Limusaurus consists of large assemblages of individuals mired in mud pits. These pits range in depth from , and were likely created by soil liquefaction from {{the footsteps of}} sauropods or other large dinosaurs. The size of these assemblages {{can be attributed to}} the <b>tendency</b> <b>of</b> smaller animals to become trapped in the mud (other animals that were trapped by these deposits include individuals of Guanlong, along with small ornithischians, crocodyliforms, turtles, mammals, and tritylodontid cynodonts), and may also hint at the possible gregarious (group-living) tendencies of Limusaurus.|$|E
5|$|The {{legends of}} self-wounding and the {{provision}} of blood may have arisen because of the impression a pelican sometimes gives that it is stabbing itself with its bill. In reality, it often presses this onto its chest in order to fully empty the pouch. Another possible derivation is the <b>tendency</b> <b>of</b> the bird to rest with its bill on its breast; the Dalmatian pelican has a blood-red pouch in the early breeding season and this {{may have contributed to the}} myth.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{presenting}} sign is a coarse slow tremor {{of the hand}} at rest which disappears during voluntary movement of the affected arm and in the deeper stages of sleep. It typically appears in only one hand, eventually affecting both hands as the disease progresses. Frequency of PD tremor is between 4 and 6 hertz (cycles per second). A feature of tremor is pill-rolling, the <b>tendency</b> <b>of</b> the index finger and thumb to touch and perform together a circular movement. The term derives from the similarity between the movement of people with PD and the early pharmaceutical technique of manually making pills.|$|E

5|$|A study {{published}} by Mulungushi University indicated that age distortions {{were found in}} census data and a <b>tendency</b> <b>of</b> age heaping with terminal digits of ‘0’ and ‘5’ were common. It also reported that gender differences existed in age reporting in Zambia with more number of males reporting their ages wrongly. But the report acknowledged the difficulties in data collection and stated {{that the quality of}} data collection was better than the previous census enumerations. Another {{study published}} in the US National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health journal indicated that the census reported very high adult female mortality, particularly a high pregnancy-related mortality in both rural and urban areas twelve months prior to the census. The evaluation of population age, age-at-death, live births were reported to contain data errors. Another study by Demographic Research indicated that the data of people aged above 80 was not accurately captured in most sub-Saharan countries, which prevented research on age-related health ailments and other socio-economic characteristics.|$|E
5|$|Aborigines were {{represented}} by eight members out of 225 {{seats in the}} Legislative Yuan. In 2008, the number of legislative seats was cut in half to 113, of which Taiwanese aborigines are represented by six members, three each for lowland and highland peoples. The <b>tendency</b> <b>of</b> Taiwanese aborigines to vote {{for members of the}} pan-blue coalition has been cited as having the potential to change the balance of the legislature. Citing these six seats in addition with five seats from smaller counties that also tend to vote pan-blue has been seen as giving the pan-blue coalition 11 seats before the first vote is counted.|$|E
