5|$|At the 2007 Pan American Games in Rio de Janeiro, Cielo {{won three}} {{gold medals in}} the 50-metre, 100-metre, and 4×100-metre {{freestyle}} events, and a silver medal in the 4×100-metre medley. In the 50-metre freestyle, he won the event {{with a time of}} 21.84 seconds, beating the Pan American Games record, and becoming the first swimmer from South America to swim it in under 22 seconds. Cielo began to get close to the world record in the 50-metre freestyle, a time of 21.64 seconds, which at the time belonged to legendary swimmer Alexander Popov. He also broke <b>the</b> <b>Pan</b> <b>Am</b> Games and South American record in the 4×100-metre freestyle, with a time of 3:15.90, along with Fernando Silva, Eduardo Deboni and Nicolas Oliveira. In the 100-metre freestyle, he broke <b>the</b> <b>Pan</b> <b>Am</b> Games record with his time of 48.79 seconds, and in the 4×100-metre medley, he broke the South American record with a time of 3:35.81, along with Thiago Pereira, Henrique Barbosa and Kaio Almeida.|$|E
50|$|The {{interactions}} between food and <b>pan</b> <b>are</b> very {{dependent on the}} material that <b>the</b> <b>pan</b> <b>is</b> made of. Whether or not <b>the</b> <b>pan</b> <b>is</b> hydrophilic or hydrophobic, the heat conductivity and capacity, surface roughness, and more all determine how the food is cooked.|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} types of makiyakinabe: Kantō-type, Kansai-type and Nagoya-type. <b>The</b> Kantō-type <b>pans</b> <b>are</b> squared. <b>The</b> Kansai-type <b>pans</b> <b>are</b> tall-and-thin rectangles. <b>The</b> Nagoya-type <b>pans</b> <b>are</b> short-and-wide rectangles.|$|R

5|$|In October 2014, MART {{announced}} that it would run dedicated bus service from Gardner to Wachusett station when the station opened. By the end of 2014, retaining walls for ramps to the platforms and concrete bases for light poles in the parking lot were in place. Track and signal work on <b>the</b> <b>Pan</b> <b>Am</b> Southern mainline began in Spring 2015. In January 2015, the opening was delayed further to Fall 2016.|$|E
5|$|The Athlete's Village {{was located}} in the West Don Lands along Front Street between Bayview Avenue and Cherry Street. It had the {{capacity}} to hold 10,000 athletes and officials during <b>the</b> <b>Pan</b> <b>Am</b> and Parapan Am Games and after the games will be converted into housing. The development was to be certified LEED Gold.|$|E
5|$|Winnipeg was {{the first}} Canadian city to ever host the Pan American Games, and the second city to host the event twice, in 1967 and again in 1999. <b>The</b> <b>Pan</b> <b>Am</b> Pool, built for the 1967 Pan Am Games, hosts aquatic events, {{including}} diving, speed swimming, synchronized swimming and water polo. Winnipeg co-hosted the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup. The city has been selected to host the 2017 Canada Summer Games.|$|E
50|$|The huge {{expanse of}} <b>the</b> Makgadikgadi <b>Pans</b> <b>is</b> bigger than Switzerland. Once a large river-fed lake, <b>the</b> Makgadikgadi <b>Pans</b> now lie saline and empty. <b>The</b> <b>pans</b> <b>are</b> {{littered}} with stone tools and artefacts dated from between 2,000 and 500,000 years old. During the wet season 35-75,000 zebra and wildebeest migrate {{into the area}} with regular sightings of lion, cheetah and other predators who follow in their wake. The zebra and wildebeest migration across <b>the</b> <b>pans</b> <b>is</b> southern Africa’s last surviving zebra and wildebeest migration and the second largest in the world. Hundreds of thousands of flamingo also appear to feed {{as long as the}} water lasts. <b>The</b> <b>pans</b> <b>are</b> also a permanent haven for desert species such as the meerkat and the elusive brown hyaena, the third rarest carnivore in the world.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>pan</b> <b>is</b> {{undoubtedly}} <b>the</b> ultimate kiting {{destination in}} South Africa. The widespread open spaces offer ideal opportunities for parasailing. <b>The</b> <b>pan</b> <b>is</b> also used by kite-surfers, an extreme sport using wind buggies. These are bicycle-like vehicles with a sail attached to them. With wind buggies speeds {{of up to}} 70 km/h can be reached. There are also many viewpoints that are ideal for birdwatching.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>pan</b> <b>was</b> {{built in}} 2004 by {{men of the}} local {{community}} of Brandon. It took these men a little over forty volunteer man hours to construct <b>the</b> frying <b>pan.</b> It <b>is</b> made out of scrap steel that was donated by local farmers. <b>The</b> <b>pan</b> <b>was</b> originally built as a promotional tool for the Brandon Area Community Club’s semi-annual fundraiser, the [...] "cowboy breakfast". They chose to build a large frying <b>pan</b> because <b>the</b> cowboy breakfast is cooked over open flames using mostly cast iron frying pans.|$|R
5|$|Liukin's {{ankle injury}} {{required}} surgery, and the recovery period kept {{her out of}} both national and international competition {{for much of the}} year. In July 2007, although she was still recovering from her injury, she returned to competition {{as a member of the}} American team for <b>the</b> <b>Pan</b> <b>Am</b> Games in Rio de Janeiro. She competed only on bars and beam, contributing to the team's gold-medal finish and winning individual silver medals in the uneven bars and balance beam finals.|$|E
5|$|On February 17, 2010, the US Department of Transportation {{awarded a}} $55.5M TIGER grant for {{the station in}} West Fitchburg and a new layover {{facility}} {{in the town of}} Westminster. In June 2010, the MBTA and Pan Am Railways reached an agreement for trackage rights and fees on several lines, including MBTA access to Wachusett station and the layover on <b>the</b> <b>Pan</b> <b>Am</b> Southern mainline partially owned by Pan Am Railways. The project officially began with a publicized groundbreaking on October 18, 2010, and was originally scheduled to be completed by the first quarter of 2012. However, by February 2012, the station was just at 30% design phase, with track and signals to reach 30% design by late spring. As of then, the estimated completion date was October 2013.|$|E
5|$|While NY346 {{follows the}} {{southern}} {{bank of the}} Hoosick River, VT346 largely runs along the northern bank. The switch in positioning is made {{just east of the}} state line, where VT346 crosses over the waterway. The route continues eastward, intersecting Indian Massacre Road, the continuation of CR96, and crossing a Pan Am Railways-owned railroad line on its way to a junction with Lime Kiln Road, a local highway leading to the village of Pownal Center. At this point, VT346 turns southward into the village of North Pownal. The route heads generally north–south through the community, running alongside both the Hoosick River and <b>the</b> <b>Pan</b> <b>Am</b> Railways line.|$|E

50|$|The {{effect can}} be seen as drops of water are {{sprinkled}} onto a pan at various times as it heats up. Initially, as the temperature of <b>the</b> <b>pan</b> <b>is</b> just below 100 C, the water flattens out and slowly evaporates, or if the temperature of <b>the</b> <b>pan</b> <b>is</b> well below 100 C, the water stays liquid. As the temperature of <b>the</b> <b>pan</b> goes above 100 C, the water droplets hiss when touching <b>the</b> <b>pan</b> and these droplets evaporate quickly. Later, as the temperature exceeds the Leidenfrost point, the Leidenfrost effect comes into play. On contact with <b>the</b> <b>pan,</b> <b>the</b> water droplets bunch up into small balls of water and skitter around, lasting much longer than when the temperature of <b>the</b> <b>pan</b> <b>was</b> lower. This effect works until a much higher temperature causes any further drops of water to evaporate too quickly to cause this effect.|$|R
5|$|Mandela served 27 {{years in}} prison, {{initially}} on Robben Island, {{and later in}} Pollsmoor Prison and Victor Verster Prison. Amid growing domestic and international pressure, and with fears of a racial civil war, President F. W. de Klerk released him in 1990. Mandela and de Klerk negotiated an end to apartheid and organised the 1994 multiracial general election in which Mandela led the ANC to victory and became President. Leading a broad coalition government which promulgated a new constitution, Mandela emphasised reconciliation between the country's racial groups and created the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate past human rights abuses. Economically, Mandela's administration retained its predecessor's liberal framework despite his own socialist beliefs, also introducing measures to encourage land reform, combat poverty, and expand healthcare services. Internationally, he acted as mediator in <b>the</b> <b>Pan</b> <b>Am</b> Flight 103 bombing trial and served as Secretary-General of the Non-Aligned Movement from 1998 to 1999. He declined a second presidential term and in 1999 was succeeded by his deputy, Thabo Mbeki. Mandela became an elder statesman and focused on combating poverty and HIV/AIDS through the charitable Nelson Mandela Foundation.|$|E
5|$|The special {{visual effects}} for Raiders were {{provided}} by Industrial Light & Magic and include: a matte shot to establish <b>the</b> <b>Pan</b> <b>Am</b> flying boat {{in the water and}} miniature work to show the plane taking off and flying, superimposed over a map; animation effects for the beam in the Tanis map room; and a miniature car and passengers superimposed over a matte painting for a shot of a Nazi car being forced off a cliff. The bulk of effects shots were featured in the climactic sequence wherein the Ark of the Covenant (which was designed by Brian Muir and Keith Short) is opened and God's wrath is unleashed. This sequence featured animation, a woman to portray a beautiful spirit's face, rod puppet spirits moved through water to convey a sense of floating, a matte painting of the island, and cloud tank effects to portray clouds. The melting of Toht's head was done by exposing a gelatine and plaster model of Ronald Lacey's head to a heat lamp with an under-cranked camera, while Dietrich's crushed head was a hollow model from which air was withdrawn. When the film was originally submitted to the Motion Picture Association of America, it received an R rating because of the scene in which Belloq's head explodes. The filmmakers were able to receive a PG rating when they added a veil of fire over the exploding head scene. (PG-13 rating was not created until 1984.) The firestorm that cleanses the canyon at the finish was a miniature canyon filmed upside down.|$|E

Some musicians use four pansticks, holding two in each hand. This skill and performance have been conclusively shown to have grown out of Trinidad and Tobago's early 20th-century Carnival percussion groups known as Tamboo bamboo. <b>The</b> <b>pan</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> national instrument of Trinidad and Tobago.|$|R

A second, smaller <b>pan</b> <b>was</b> set behind and slightly above the first, so that its contents could be siphoned into <b>the</b> front <b>pan.</b> Both <b>were</b> heated by flues from grates before the gases passed into <b>the</b> chimney. <b>The</b> <b>pans</b> <b>were</b> inclined and sloping wooden platforms, called drips, were joined to them on which the salt was drained. The brine was purified with milk of lime, {{the same as in}} the kettle process.|$|R
50|$|The Caribbean Research Institute CARIRI {{investigated}} possibilities to mass-produce raw {{forms with}} the use of pressing machines in the 1970s. Much of this project took place in Sweden in collaboration with the Saab Company. Although first results were promising, the project has been abandoned due to lack of finances and support by local pan tuners in Trinidad. Another method of shaping <b>the</b> <b>pan</b> <b>was</b> attempted: by spinning. <b>The</b> <b>pan</b> <b>was</b> spun on a lathe-like device, and a roller {{on the end of a}} bar was used to sink <b>the</b> <b>pan.</b> While this did create pre-sunk <b>pans,</b> a problem <b>was</b> that there would often be scratches and grooves in the steel.|$|R
