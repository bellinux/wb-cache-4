5|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} on an in-house 3D game engine under construction for multiple years. Each character {{is made of}} over 7000 polygons and 55 bones, making for players with facial expressions, over 800 animations, and a capacity <b>to</b> <b>blink.</b> Character faces can additionally express emotions like happiness or anger, and feelings of pain. The move to Xbox led to greater variation in the team personalities. The artists drew many options for each team and the developers chose from the lot. Deathrow was designed for the Action camera view, but Sports view was introduced to expand the game's appeal.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor {{comes to}} the end of the {{transcript}} and Sally realises Larry has stopped writing it due to the presence of an Angel in the room. The Doctor, surmising their fate, warns them not even <b>to</b> <b>blink</b> around the Angels. Sally and Larry make their way to the basement of the house and discover more Angels guarding the TARDIS. The Angels attack and Sally and Larry use the Yale key to hide inside the TARDIS. The Angels surround and rock the TARDIS to try to gain entry. Once in the control room, a hologram of the Doctor informs them that they have a control disk with them. Larry takes a now-glowing DVD from his pocket and inserts it into the console. The TARDIS' engines engage and the ship dematerialises, leaving a panicking Sally and Larry behind. With the TARDIS gone, the Angels who were all stood around the TARDIS have been tricked into looking at each other and have become permanently frozen as statues.|$|E

They were disbanding troops, blowing up fortresses, sinking their warships and offering indemnities which they both refused to take. Then as they talked, Jinks leaned forward and said something <b>to</b> <b>Blinks</b> in a low voice,--a final proposal of terms evidently.|$|R
30|$|Minimum {{and maximum}} {{measurements}} {{are found to}} be greatly influenced by the boarder of the images (especially the hairline) and by the changes near the eyes (due <b>to</b> <b>blinking)</b> or mouth (due to lip posture) which may result in arbitrary minimum and maximum measurements. Therefore, these two measurements are discarded in the analysis.|$|R

25|$|Facial nerve paralysis* is most {{commonly}} caused in dogs by trauma, otitis media, {{or as an}} idiopathic condition. Signs include an inability <b>to</b> <b>blink,</b> drooping of the ear, and drooping of the lips on the affected side, although in chronic conditions fibrosis occurs and the ear and lips {{may appear to be}} in an abnormal position.|$|E
25|$|On September 10, 2012 during Raw at the Bell Centre in Montreal, {{not long}} after {{defeating}} CM Punk and Dolph Ziggler in a tag-team match with Randy Orton, Lawler legitimately collapsed at the announcers table while Kane and Daniel Bryan competed against The Prime Time Players. Fellow commentator Michael Cole continued to call that match alone, {{as well as the}} next match, before WWE (through Cole) announced the medical situation with Lawler. The remaining matches on the show went ahead as scheduled but without commentary, and updates on Jerry's condition were provided by Cole. At the end of the broadcast, it was announced that he had received CPR, but was breathing independently and reacting to stimulation. It was later confirmed on WWE.com that Lawler had suffered a heart attack. On September 11, 2012, he underwent an angioplasty to improve blood flow to his heart. On September 12, 2012, Lawler was reported to be slowly being eased off sedation, his ventilator removed. He was able <b>to</b> <b>blink,</b> nod, and squeeze with his hands, and that same day, the results of several CT scans showed no signs of brain damage. By September 17, Lawler had returned to his home in Memphis. During Lawler's hospital stay, it was determined that his heart attack was not caused by a blocked artery, but was instead an unexplained cardiac arrest. Lawler was soon medically cleared to continue wrestling.|$|E

Big-amplitude, slow, positive wave prominent in frontal electrodes. 2: Electrode's artifact caused by bad contact (and thus bigger impedance) between P3 electrode and skin. 3: Swallowing artifact. 4: Common reference electrode's artifact caused by bad contact between reference electrode and skin. Huge wave similar in all channels.|$|R
5000|$|The {{resulting}} {{image was}} a unique photograph {{that could not be}} reproduced. Due to the paper's poor light sensitivity, an exposure of approximately twelve minutes was required. Using this method of photography, still subject matter, such as buildings, were favoured. When used for photographing people, sitters were told to close their eyes so as to eliminate the eerie, [...] "dead" [...] quality produced due <b>to</b> <b>blinking</b> and moving one's eyes during such a long exposure.|$|R
40|$|Blinking is {{a normal}} human phenomenom {{involving}} trigeminal and facial patways. To gain understanding on the neurobiology of blinking, five normal subjects were investigated before and after application of transdermal capsaicin at the forehead for two weeks. No effects of topical capsaicin were detected in eye blink rates. However, when capsaicin was applied to a female subject with blepharospasm, she showed a dramatic restoration of her vision subsequent <b>to</b> <b>blinking</b> modification. Deactivation of abnormal A-to-C fibers cross talks at the trigeminal-facial pathways {{seems to be the}} most likely mechanism of such improvement...|$|R
500|$|Of her {{gameplay}} mechanics, Inquisitr {{expressed the}} opinion that her [...] "quick and evasive ways make her an annoyance to deal with". ESPN described her as [...] "the classic in-and-out harasser", referring to her speed and her ability <b>to</b> <b>blink</b> and recall, and also reported that [...] "she was used a lot more before a health nerf late in the beta". Mike Minotti of VentureBeat opined that: [...] "Tracer [...] {{a lot of fun}} to play. Her whole teleporting/rewinding mechanics [...] so unique and fast-paced. I feel like [...] done a great job making a varied, relatively balanced cast." [...] In 2017, Screen Rant ranked Tracer #8 out of the 24 playable characters in Overwatch, expressing that [...] "a good Tracer that goes unchecked can wreak havoc on the back-lines, causing teams to fold before they even know what's happening." ...|$|E
500|$|During shooting, Hitchcock {{was forced}} to uncharacteristically do retakes for some scenes. The final shot in the shower scene, which starts with an extreme {{close-up}} on Marion's eye and pulls up and out, proved very difficult for Leigh, since the water splashing in her face made her want <b>to</b> <b>blink,</b> and the cameraman had trouble as well since he had to manually focus while moving the camera. Retakes were also required for the opening scene, since Hitchcock felt that Leigh and Gavin were not passionate enough. Leigh had trouble saying [...] "Not inordinately" [...] for the real estate office scene, requiring additional retakes. Lastly, the scene in which the mother is discovered required a complicated coordinating of the chair turning around, Vera Miles (as Lila Crane) [...] hitting the light bulb, and a lens flare, which {{proved to be the}} sticking point. Hitchcock forced retakes until all three elements were to his satisfaction.|$|E
500|$|Richard Johnson, under {{contract}} to MGM, was cast as Dr. Markway. Wise saw Johnson in a Royal Shakespeare Company production of The Devils. Impressed with his acting, he offered him the role. Johnson later said he received invaluable film acting advice from Wise. Wise told {{him to keep his}} eyes steady, <b>to</b> <b>blink</b> less, and to try not to time his acting (Wise said he would take care of that in the editing room). Johnson also credited Wise with helping him to craft a much more natural acting performance. Russ Tamblyn, also {{under contract}} with MGM, initially turned down the role as Luke because he felt that the character was [...] "a jerk", although he thought that the script was very good. The studio forced him to reconsider, threatening him with suspension. Tamblyn told the British cinema magazine Film Review in 1995 that while reading the script a second time, he realised the character was much more interesting. [...] "This is the ironic part," [...] he said, [...] "it {{turned out to be one}} of my favourite films that I've been in!" ...|$|E

50|$|The {{series was}} once again relaunched in April 2009, written by Jeff Parker and drawn by Salvador Espin, but {{canceled}} in September 2009. Alternate versions of The Witch, Beast, Forge, Polaris, and The Panther are picked up right before their intended deaths and put {{together as a team}} with the returning Blink, though she pretends to be new to all of this just as much as the others. Morph acts as the Timebroker and this version of the Black Panther is T'challa's son, T'chaka. On their first mission, they are teleported away without finishing their mission, <b>to</b> <b>Blink's</b> shock.|$|R
5000|$|Researchers at the University of Southern California {{reported}} in 2012 that red lights {{are worse than}} white lights, and switching <b>to</b> <b>blinking</b> lights can cut fatalities by half without reducing visibility by aircraft. [...] In a 25-year study of bird mortality at the 1010 ft tower at Tall Timbers Research Station near Tallahassee, Florida, kills occurred nearly every night from mid-August through mid-November. Moderate numbers of migrants were killed under perfectly clear skies, but the toll increased markedly with overcast conditions. Researchers believe the attraction to lighted regions results in most towerkill, and numerous {{studies have been conducted}} to further understand the phenomena.|$|R
500|$|Michael Lantieri, {{mechanical}} effects {{supervisor for}} the 1912 scenes, noted {{the difficulty in}} shooting the train sequence. [...] "You can't just stop a train," [...] he said, [...] "If it misses its mark, it takes blocks and blocks to stop it and back up." [...] Lantieri hid handles for the actors and stuntmen to grab onto when leaping from carriage to carriage. The carriage interiors shot at Universal Studios Hollywood were built on tubes that inflated and deflated to create a rocking motion. For the close-up of the rhinoceros that strikes at (and misses) Indiana, a foam and fiberglass animatronic was made in London. When Spielberg decided {{he wanted it to}} move, the prop was sent to John Carl Buechler in Los Angeles, who resculpted it over three days <b>to</b> <b>blink,</b> snarl, snort and wiggle its ears. The giraffes were also created in London. Because steam locomotives are very loud, Lantieri's crew would respond to first assistant director David Tomblin's radioed directions by making the giraffes nod or shake their heads to his questions, which amused the crew. For the villains' cars, Lantieri selected a 1914 Ford Model T, a 1919 Ford Model T truck and a 1916 Saxon Model 14, fitting each with a Ford Pinto V6 engine. Sacks of dust were hung under the cars to create a dustier environment.|$|E
500|$|Kaminey {{received}} widespread {{critical acclaim}} from critics who praised {{many aspects of}} the film. Raja Sen of Rediff.com rated the film 4.5 out of 5 and wrote, [...] "Kaminey is startlingly clever, an innovative film with genuine surprises. A kind of film whose success we ought all pray for, because it'll prove smart cinema works." [...] The Indian Express gave a rating of 4 out of 5, calling it [...] "Bollywood's first all-the-way-out-to-there pulp fiction". Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave the film 4 stars out of 5, called it a [...] "must watch" [...] and wrote, [...] "t's an unpredictable crime drama that combines violence and dark humor in a manner that's reminiscent of the films of Quentin Tarantino, Guy Ritchie and the Coen Brothers. And yet Kaminey is so original and inventive {{in the manner in which}} it takes Bollywood's favorite formulatwin brothersand turns it on its head." [...] He praised the writingwhich he said was the film's real strength, the non-linear screenplay and the dialogue, and wrote that the film has [...] "the best performance you will see by an ensemble cast in a long time". Nikhat Kazmi from The Times of India rated the film 4 out of 5, and said it is [...] "Bollywood's first film which is full of brains, brawn and belligerence besides being a bravura attempt to rewrite the tried and tested idiom of desi movielore. Kaminey is a smart and balsy film that brings Hollywood to Bollywood which catapult the viewer into the dark, violent world of crime and criminals, leaving you no time <b>to</b> <b>blink</b> or breathe easy...Tarantino, take a bow. Brave new Bollywood is here." ...|$|E

40|$|Generally, blinks {{are treated}} on equal with {{artifacts}} and noise while analyzing EEG signals. However, blinks carry important information about mental processes {{and thus it}} is important <b>to</b> detect <b>blinks</b> accurately. The aim of the presented study is <b>to</b> propose a <b>blink</b> detection method and discuss its application for extracting blink rate variability, a novel concept that might {{shed some light on}} the mental processes. In this study, 14 EEG recordings were selected for assessing the quality of the proposed blink detection algorithm...|$|R
2500|$|Cats often sleep {{during the}} day so they can [...] "hunt" [...] at night. Unlike humans, cats do not need <b>to</b> <b>blink</b> their eyes {{on a regular basis}} to keep their eyes {{lubricated}} (with tears). Unblinking eyes are probably an advantage when hunting. Cats will, however, [...] "squint" [...] their eyes, usually as a form of communication expressing affection and ease around another cat or human.|$|E
2500|$|The {{gameplay}} {{is similar}} to that of Activision's Kaboom!, in which the player must prevent objects dropping from the top of the screen from reaching the bottom by positioning their character directly under the falling objects. In Tooth Protectors, the objects are small [...] "snack" [...] squares dropped by the [...] "Snack Attacker", a menacing-looking face that moves horizontally along the top of the screen. The player's character is a small smiling face carrying a strand of dental floss above its head. The player must prevent the snack squares from reaching the row of white teeth along the bottom of the screen; repeated hits by the snacks cause the teeth <b>to</b> <b>blink</b> and disappear from tooth decay.|$|E
2500|$|Collecting {{details of}} past stunts is {{difficult}} because they are carried out by anonymous teams of students.

40|$|Electro-oculographic {{recordings}} {{were obtained}} from 11 patients with Huntington's disease. Significant reduction of saccadic velocity was constantly found. In all the patients vertical saccades were much more impaired than horizontal. When present, vertical saccades showed long latency, low amplitude, low velocity, and disturbances related <b>to</b> <b>blinking.</b> Following movements were jerky, and ability to perform repeated rhythmic movements was impaired. These results are in agreement with previous observations and underline the selective defect of rapid movements as a characteristic feature of Huntington's disease. Further, they suggest a possible correlation between the difficulty in performing repeated ocular movements and the impaired execution of gestural sequences involving a succession of different fundamental movements...|$|R
5000|$|A coin-collecting minigame called [...] "Code Red" [...] becomes {{available}} if the player's park contains at least 5 carnivorous dinosaurs. In the minigame, the carnivores rampage during a violent storm. A circle appears {{over their heads}} and fills up with color from green <b>to</b> <b>blinking</b> red. The brighter the color, the more coins are earned. The player must tap on the dinosaur before the circle completely fills to earn the coins. If a circle above any carnivore's head fills completely, the carnivore escapes and the minigame is over. The objective is to earn as many coins as possible and prevent any dinosaurs from escaping.|$|R

In relation to Opera Software's announcement earlier in the year that it would switch to WebKit by means of the Chromium codebase, it was confirmed that the Opera web browser would also switch <b>to</b> <b>Blink.</b> Following the announcement, WebKit developers began discussions on removing Chrome-specific code from the engine to streamline its codebase.

2500|$|Turn {{signals are}} {{required}} <b>to</b> <b>blink</b> on and off, or [...] "flash", {{at a steady}} rate of between 60 and 120 blinks per minute (1–2Hz). International UN Regulations require that all turn signals flash in simultaneous phase; US regulations permit side marker lights wired for side turn signal functionality to flash in opposite-phase. An audio and/or visual tell-tale indicator is required, to advise the driver when the turn signals are activated and operating. This usually {{takes the form of}} one or two green indicator lights on the vehicle's instrument cluster, and a cyclical [...] "tick-tock" [...] noise generated electromechanically or electronically. It is also required that the vehicle operator be alerted by much faster- or slower-than-normal flashing in the event a turn signal light fails.|$|E
2500|$|The {{complexity}} of MNG {{led to the}} proposal of APNG by developers of the Mozilla Foundation. It is based on PNG, supports animation and is simpler than MNG. APNG offers fallback to single-image display for PNG decoders that do not support APNG. However, neither of these formats is currently widely supported. APNG is supported in Firefox 3.0 and up, Pale Moon (all versions), and Opera 9.5, but since Opera changed its layout engine <b>to</b> <b>Blink,</b> support was dropped. The latest version of Safari on iOS 8 and Safari 8 for OS X Yosemite support APNG. Chromium 59.0 has added APNG support. The PNG Group decided in April 2007 not to embrace APNG. Several alternatives were under discussion, ANG, aNIM/mPNG, [...] "PNG in GIF" [...] and its subset [...] "RGBA in GIF".|$|E
