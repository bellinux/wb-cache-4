Most are powerful systems consisting of one or more programs that can produce a combination of images, graphics and text, the latter handled with type-setting capability. Typical features of a modern word processor include multiple font sets, spell checking, grammar checking, a built-in thesaurus, automatic text correction, web integration, HTML conversion, pre-formatted publication projects such as newsletters and <b>to-do</b> lists, and much more.|$|E

Calendars can contain feeds from Twitter, Blogger, MySpace, Facebook, WordPress, Vox, and Upcoming.org, which generates a social timeline listing all of a user's recent online activity. Users can also import and export data as ics or csv files, or as an RSS feed. The website includes a plain-language event adding feature, which allows users to type phrases such as “Drinks with Richard, tomorrow, 7-9pm, Flute and Whistle”. The website then translates the phrase into an event, determining the location, time, date, and description. Users can add buddies and share calendars with them. 30 Boxes features a simple webtop, which summarizes daily appointments and <b>to-do</b> items. Users can also add applets to the page, such as Google search, Yahoo! Mail, and Google Calendar, a competing online calendar service. 30 Boxes also offers a mobile version of their calendar.|$|E

500|$|Nick Levine from Digital Spy said [...] " [...] 'What's My Name?' is {{essentially}} the long, luxuriant lovemaking session to 'Rude Boy's hard'n'fast rut... it manages to stay classy even when Drake makes a dodgy joke about the 'square root of 69' and Rihanna delivers a not-so-coy reference to oral sex." [...] Megan Vick from Billboard said [...] "As much as 'What's My Name' is a joint effort, Rihanna owns the song by delivering a more polished version of her pop persona." [...] According to Jon Dolan from Rolling Stone {{with the release of}} [...] "What's My Name?" [...] as second single from the album Rihanna created [...] "a perfect little tropical storm". He continued: [...] " [...] Over dark, humid synths and swirling snare skitters, she's in full-on Caribbean-queen mode, dialing up her islander accent and rolling out a <b>to-do</b> list for any adult male seeking entrance into her chambers". However, he also criticized Drake's [...] "Square root of 69" [...] line, stating that Drake sounds like a nerdy guy from a fraternity while he raps it.|$|E
500|$|... {{the latest}} update was version 0.43.05, with it {{completing}} 14 years in development despite being an alpha version. Adams {{and his brother}} have a <b>to-do</b> list of features the game should have before version 1.0 and the version number is the percentage progress of its completion. He {{says he has been}} able to maintain focus by shifting his attention to different aspects of the game, given its large coverage. While regular game development aim to perfect their work for release, he considers that a drawback since he continues exploring and learning while adding new features. Wired and Rock, Paper, Shotgun called some of its bug fixes unintentional and funny, with PC Gamer saying it makes an entertaining RSS feed to subscribe to. Adams has two favorite bugs. One is about a farmer dwarf planting his own bed. The other involves a dwarven executioner, with broken arms unable to use his hammer, delivering punishments by biting his victims and tearing off their limbs, keeping one in his mouth for years.|$|E
500|$|A {{church was}} founded in Aberdaron in the 6th century by Saint Hywyn, a {{follower}} of Saint Cadfan; it was a significant institution, a monastery and centre of religious learning, rather than simply a place of worship for the locals. The present double-naved Church of St Hywyn (...) , built in 1137 and known as the [...] "Cathedral of Llŷn", stands above the shore {{and was on the}} pilgrim route to Bardsey Island. It contains a 12th-century Romanesque arched door, and a square bell turret. The church was extended in 1417 and abandoned in 1841, when the locals decided to build a new church, Eglwys Newydd, in the village; the new building, however, proved unpopular and the congregation returned in 1906. Inside is a display about the life and works of the poet, Ronald Stuart Thomas; and in the churchyard stand Y Meini Feracius a Senagus (...) , the tombstones of two 5th century Christian priests, found in the 18th century on farmland near Mynydd Anelog. In 2008 the church became the centre of controversy when the local vicar blessed a gay civil partnership, after approval by the local church council; the vicar was reprimanded by Barry Morgan, the Archbishop of Wales (...)

500|$|The halftime show {{received}} critical acclaim. Said Marc Schneider of Billboard: [...] "It's Madonna Louise Ciccone's world, we're just {{living in}} it". Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times wrote {{that although the}} choice of Madonna as halftime-show performer was a subject of discussion, the singer was [...] "defiantly unconcerned with the more conservative red state wing of the football fanbase who'd never be caught dead singing along {{to one of her}} songs ... and her halftime show was pure spectacle by the Cleopatra of the game ... Madonna is Madonna for a reason. And we saw it firsthand Sunday." [...] Chicago Tribune critic Greg Kot called the show an [...] "S party to Ancient Egypt". Along with reminding the audience of her older hits, Madonna had [...] "important career-advancing work to do ... after all, never does anything unless she's got something to sell, and with a new studio album due out in March and a tour to follow, she had plenty on her <b>to-do</b> list". Jon Pareles of The New York Times wrote that although the singer was not as [...] "indefatigable" [...] as she had been, she was a [...] "party girl turned regent: a queen on her throne, a homecoming queen strutting in the bleachers, a church singer fronting a choir". Pareles called Madonna [...] "grown-up", and wrote that she put on a show appropriate for the NFL. Peter Robinson of The Guardian called the performance low-key for the singer, despite the large audience. Robinson wrote that the show's budget would [...] " [...] your average James Cameron effort look like Homes Under the Hammer", and called Madonna's entrance and exit his favorite parts of the show.|$|E

2500|$|However, {{while this}} is fine for initialisms such as ktp [...] for etc., it can be {{problematic}} when spelling out names. For example, several consonantal distinctions are difficult for many nationalities, who normally rely {{on the fact that}} Esperanto seldom uses these sounds to distinguish words (that is, they do not form many minimal pairs). Thus the pairs of letter names ĵo–ĝo, ĥo–ho (or ĥo–ko), co–ĉo (or co–so, co–to), lo–ro, and ŭo–vo (or vo–bo) are problematic. In addition, over a noisy telephone connection it quickly becomes apparent that voicing distinctions can be difficult to make out: noise confounds the pairs po–bo, <b>to–do,</b> ĉo–ĝo, ko–go, fo–vo, so–zo, ŝo–ĵo, as well as the nasals mo–no.|$|E

Following the release of Lion the previous year, {{it was the first}} of the annual rather than two-yearly updates to OS X (and later macOS), which also closely alined with the annual iOS operating system updates. It incorporates some features seen in iOS 5, which include Game Center, support for iMessage in the new Messages messaging application, and Reminders as a <b>to-do</b> list app separate from iCal (which is renamed as Calendar, like the iOS app). It also includes support for storing iWork documents in iCloud. Notification Center, which makes its debut in Mountain Lion, is a desktop version similar to the one in iOS 5.0 and higher. Application pop-ups are now concentrated on the corner of the screen, and the Center itself is pulled from the right side of the screen. Mountain Lion also includes more Chinese features including support for Baidu as an option for Safari search engine, QQ, 163.com and 126.com services for Mail, Contacts [...] and Calendar, Youku, Tudou and Sina Weibo are integrated into share sheets.|$|E

The address bar also has a [...] "Reader" [...] button, showing the user just the text of the article without advertisements and distraction.
