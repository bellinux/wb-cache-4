It also reacts with other chloride salts {{to give the}} yellow tetrahedral FeCl4− ion. Salts of FeCl4− in hydrochloric acid can be extracted into diethyl ether.|$|E
25|$|The Wittig {{reaction}} or Wittig olefination is {{a chemical}} reaction of an aldehyde or ketone with a triphenyl phosphonium ylide (often called a Wittig reagent) {{to give an}} alkene and <b>triphenylphosphine</b> <b>oxide.</b>|$|E
25|$|Iodoalkanes may {{similarly}} {{be prepared}} using red phosphorus and iodine (equivalent to phosphorus triiodide). The Appel reaction is also useful for preparing alkyl halides.

40|$|Heterogeneous polymer-supported <b>triphenylphosphine</b> <b>oxides</b> {{based on}} the rasta resin {{architecture}} have been synthesized, and applied as reagent precursors {{in a wide range}} of halogenation reactions. The rasta resin–triphenylphosphine oxides were reacted with either oxalyl chloride or oxalyl bromide to form the corresponding halophosphonium salts, and these in turn were reacted with alcohols, aldehydes, aziridines and epoxides to form halogenated products in high yields after simple purification. The polymer-supported <b>triphenylphosphine</b> <b>oxides</b> formed as a byproduct during these reactions could be recovered and reused numerous times with no appreciable decrease in reactivity...|$|R
40|$|Quantum {{chemical}} {{analysis was used}} to examine nucleophilic aromatic substitution reactions of fluorinated benzophenones, diphenyl sulfones, and <b>triphenylphosphine</b> <b>oxides.</b> Some experimental results for these compounds were contrary to conventional wisdom, which holds that calculated atomic charges for the aromatic sites and 13 C-NMR and 19 F-NMR chemical shifts should allow prediction of the preferred sites for aromatic substitution. Density functional theory (B 3 LYP/ 6 - 31 +G*//RM 1) and semi-empirical (RM 1) quantum chemical calculations were employed to study the intermediates in the reaction pathways in order to identify the preferred paths for aromatic substitution. In most cases studied para substitution pathways had the lower energy intermediates and were favored. Experimental acid dissociation pKa 2 ̆ 7 s for a set of 41 aliphatic carboxylic acids were compared with quantum chemical indices for the compounds in an attempt to find correlations that might help explain how the electronic structures of the compounds influence their tendencies to dissociate. The quantum chemical indices included the charges on atoms and groups of atoms, calculated vibrational frequencies, calculated nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) chemical shifts, and reaction energy differences both in vacuum and in an aqueous phase solvent model. Several of these calculated quantities yielded respectable correlations, with the vibrational frequency of the carboxylic acid proton (R 2 = 0. 874) and the vibrational frequency of the carbonyl stretch of the carboxylate anion (R 2 = 0. 852) giving the best results. As was observed in earlier work, the RM 1 semi-empirical calculations yielded better correlations than the more sophisticated density functional theory approach...|$|R
25|$|Carbon-carbon bond {{rotation}} {{gives the}} betaine 4, which then forms the oxaphosphetane 5. Elimination gives the desired Z-alkene 7 and <b>triphenylphosphine</b> <b>oxide</b> 6. With simple Wittig reagents, {{the first step}} occurs easily with both aldehydes and ketones, and the decomposition of the betaine (to form 5) is the rate-determining step. However, with stabilised ylides (where R1 stabilises the negative charge) {{the first step is}} the slowest step, so the overall rate of alkene formation decreases and a bigger proportion of the alkene product is the E-isomer. This also explains why stabilised reagents fail to react well with sterically hindered ketones.|$|E
25|$|Substitutions to {{pyridine}} at the 2- or 4-position {{result in}} an energetically unfavorable σ complex. They can be promoted, however, using experimental techniques, such as conducting electrophilic substitution on the pyridine N-oxide followed by deoxygenation of the nitrogen atom. Addition of oxygen reduces electron density on the nitrogen atom and promotes substitution at the 2- and 4-carbons. The oxygen atom can then be removed via several routes, most commonly with compounds of trivalent phosphorus or divalent sulfur, which are easily oxidized. Triphenylphosphine is a frequently used reagent, which is oxidized in this reaction to <b>triphenylphosphine</b> <b>oxide.</b> The following paragraphs describe representative electrophilic substitution reactions of pyridine.|$|E
25|$|For instance, palladium(II) acetate {{is reduced}} by {{triphenylphosphine}} to bis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) (1) and triphenylphosphine is oxidized to <b>triphenylphosphine</b> <b>oxide.</b> Step A is an oxidative addition in which palladium inserts itself in the aryl to bromide bond. Palladium then forms a π complex with the alkene (3) and in step B the alkene inserts itself in the palladium - carbon bond in a syn addition step. Then follows a torsional strain relieving rotation to the trans isomer (not shown) and step C is a beta-hydride elimination step {{with the formation of}} a new palladium - alkene π complex (5). This complex is destroyed in the next step. The palladium(0) compound is regenerated by reductive elimination of the palladium(II) compound by potassium carbonate in the final step, D. In the course of the reaction the carbonate is stoichiometrically consumed and palladium is truly a catalyst and used in catalytic amounts. A similar palladium cycle but with different scenes and actors is observed in the Wacker process.|$|E

50|$|<b>Triphenylphosphine</b> <b>oxide</b> can be {{difficult}} to remove from reaction mixtures by means of chromatography. It is poorly soluble in hexane and cold diethyl ether.

5000|$|Phosphine oxides are {{phosphorus}} compounds {{with the}} formula OPX3. When X = alkyl or aryl, these are organophosphine oxides. <b>Triphenylphosphine</b> <b>oxide</b> is an example.

50|$|Modification of {{the classic}} {{reaction}} allows for the synthesis of oxazoline rings. This method proceeds under relatively mild room temperature conditions, however, owing to the large amounts of <b>triphenylphosphine</b> <b>oxide</b> produced, it is unsuitable for large scale reactions.

50|$|Initially, the triphenyl {{phosphine}} (2) makes a nucleophilic attack upon diethyl azodicarboxylate (1) {{producing a}} betaine intermediate 3, which deprotonates the carboxylic acid (4) {{to form the}} ion pair 5. DEAD itself deprotonates the alcohol (6) forming an alkoxide that can form the key oxyphosphonium ion 8. The ratio and interconversion of intermediates 8-11 depend on the carboxylic acid pKa and the solvent polarity. Although several phosphorus intermediates are present, the attack of the carboxylate anion upon intermediate 8 is the only productive pathway forming the desired product 12 and <b>triphenylphosphine</b> <b>oxide</b> (13).|$|E
50|$|The Appel {{reaction}} {{begins with}} the formation of the phosphonium salt 3, which is thought to exist as a tight ion pair with 4 and therefore is unable to undergo an alpha-elimination to give dichlorocarbene.
