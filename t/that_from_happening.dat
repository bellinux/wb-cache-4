25|$|On November 11, 1921, President Warren G. Harding {{traveled}} to the dedication ceremony for the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery. He became caught in a three-hour traffic jam because Highway Bridge (on which he traveled) could not handle the traffic. Resolving to prevent <b>that</b> <b>from</b> <b>happening</b> again, Harding sought an appropriation of $25,000 in 1922 to fund {{the work of the}} bridge commission. Congress approved his request on June 12, 1922.|$|E
25|$|The state {{became a}} hotbed of racial and {{economic}} tensions during the Populist and Agrarian movements of the 1890s. A Republican-Populist biracial coalition took power away from White Democrats temporarily. To prevent <b>that</b> <b>from</b> <b>happening</b> again, Democrats gained passage of a new constitution in 1895 that effectively disfranchised almost all blacks and many poor whites by new requirements for poll taxes, residency, and literacy tests that dramatically reduced the voter rolls. By 1896, only 5,500 black voters remained on the voter registration rolls, although they constituted {{a majority of the}} state's population. The 1900 census demonstrated the extent of disenfranchisement: the 782,509 African American citizens comprised more than 58% of the state's population, but they were essentially without any political representation in the Jim Crow society.|$|E
25|$|The {{origins of}} the line date from 1863, when a privately owned railway from Barcelona to the then-separated town of Sarrià was opened. In 1912, Catalan {{engineer}} Carles Emili Montañès created the company Ferrocarriles de Cataluña (FCC) {{in order to take}} control of the line and extend it northwards. After successive extensions, the line reached Terrassa and Sabadell in 1919 and 1922, respectively. In 1977, FCC announced that the whole line was to be closed due to the company's bad economic results. Nevertheless, the Spanish government prevented <b>that</b> <b>from</b> <b>happening</b> by taking control of it. The line was transferred to the Catalan government in 1979, and has been operated by Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat de Catalunya (FGC) ever since. Currently, the most prominent intervention on the line is the extension of the Terrassa and Sabadell branches through the construction of a route underneath the two cities; the former was completed in 2015, whilst the latter will do so in 2017.|$|E

25|$|Carol Ferris {{once again}} gains the {{attention}} of the Zamarons as well. After a divorce and giving up the chance at being with Hal Jordan, he is no longer in her life and a hole in her heart has formed. While flying his former plane, the Zamarons send her one of their new violet power rings to fill it. Ferris' reunion with the violet light is not fully shown until Blackest Night: Tales of the Corps #2 (July 2009). In Tales of the Star Sapphires: Lost Love, Ferris initially expects to be possessed by her violet power ring as had been the case with the Star Sapphire gem. The ring explains to her that the Zamarons have changed service to the Star Sapphires: it must be voluntary and now extends to an entire violet Corps. The ring reveals that Ferris has the potential of becoming the most powerful Star Sapphire, and also has the ability of leading the Star Sapphires into war alongside the Green Lantern Corps. At the end of the story, the power ring keeps its word and does not recruit Ferris until she gives it permission. She is, however, manipulated by being told that her love (Hal Jordan) may die depending upon the outcome of the War of Light. By joining the Star Sapphires, Ferris may be able to prevent <b>that</b> <b>from</b> <b>happening.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{most notable}} {{massacre}} of Bulgarian civilians took part after the July battle of Stara Zagora when Gurko's forces had to retreat {{back to the}} Shipka pass. In {{the aftermath of the}} battle Suleiman Pasha's forces burned down and plundered the town of Stara Zagora which by that time was one of the largest towns in the Bulgarian lands. The number of massacred Christian civilians during the battle is estimated at 15,000. Suleiman Pasha's forces also established in the whole valley of the Maritsa river a system of terror taking form in the hanging at the street corners of every Bulgarian who had in any way assisted the Russians, but even villages that had not assisted the Russians were destroyed and their inhabitants massacred. As a result, as many as 100,000 civilian Bulgarians fled north to the Russian occupied territories. Later on in the campaign the Ottoman forces planned to burn the town of Sofia after Gurko had managed to overcome their resistance in the passes of Western part of the Balkan Mountains. Only the refusal of the Italian Consul Vito Positano, the French Vice Consul Léandre François René le Gay and the Austro–Hungarian Vice Consul to leave Sofia prevented <b>that</b> <b>from</b> <b>happening.</b> After the Ottoman retreat, Positano even organized armed detachments to protect the population from marauders (regular Ottoman Army deserters, bashi-bazouks and Circassians).|$|E

500|$|With {{the fall}} of Sihanouk, Hanoi became alarmed at the {{prospect}} of a pro-Western regime that might allow the Americans to establish a military presence on their western flank. To prevent <b>that</b> <b>from</b> <b>happening,</b> they began transferring their military installations away from the border regions to locations deeper within Cambodian territory. A new command center was established at the city of Kratié and the timing of the move was propitious. President Nixon was of the opinion that: [...] "We need a bold move in Cambodia to show that we stand with Lon Nol...something symbolic...for the only Cambodian regime that had the guts to take a pro-Western and pro-American stand." ...|$|E
500|$|Damage to the Gustavus {{campus was}} {{estimated}} at nearly $60million. Despite 33of the 78of the classrooms not being ready for use, the college re-opened {{three weeks after the}} tornado. Following the storm, a major concern for the college was that the student base would be eroded. To prevent <b>that</b> <b>from</b> <b>happening,</b> every returning and graduating student was given a $3,000check by the college. In addition, the school sent out letters and made phone calls to all 2,000applicants within 10 days of the disaster. The 735new students who reported to Gustavus the following fall comprised the largest incoming class in the school's history. After a summer of repairs, the symbolic end to the rebuilding process on campus occurred on October 22, 1998, when a new [...] spire was placed atop the chapel.|$|E

2500|$|In 1936 the buttresses on {{the north}} and south aisles were {{replaced}} with stronger ones. [...] There was no other significant work on the building otherwise {{during the first half of}} the century. In the 1960s, however, the cathedral faced a threat to its existence. Most of the neighborhoods to the north and west that had made up its parish were demolished to clear the way for Empire State Plaza, the modernist complex of state government buildings envisioned by Governor Nelson Rockefeller. Only 300 houses remained, and with the resulting diminution of the congregation it was uncertain that the cathedral could survive as an institution—and as just a building, it faced demolition. Rockefeller and Bishop William Scully worked together to prevent <b>that</b> <b>from</b> <b>happening.</b>|$|E

So they have used scare tactics for years and years and years, to keep <b>that</b> <b>from</b> <b>happening.</b> If there were a broader program like our Medicare program now, it could potentially reduce the profits of these big companies.

"Reading the {{statements}} from last weekend's sessions {{reminded me that}} it was probably the senior warden, not the girl's mother, who in 1975 reported John's abuse, after which I immediately told him to leave the parish, and that {{in order to maintain the}} confidentiality of both John and the girl, I did not tell the parents, who nonetheless confronted me when they had found out four years later.

It was that fear, that caution, that understanding, that perception on the part of Russia and its leaders that was the real deterrent against Russia committing the utterly irrational and suicidal act of plunging into a third world war in which the Soviet Union would be likely to find itself confronting a combination of the greatest industrial and economic powers in the world".|$|E
