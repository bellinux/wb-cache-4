40|$|Thinking Through Geography (TTG) {{strategies}} are popular in secondary education. Geography teachers see these strategies to be powerful to stimulate thinking geographically. However, empirical evidence is scarce. Based on a quasi-experimental design, effects of mysteries, {{one of the}} more famous TTG strategies, were examined on students <b>geographical</b> <b>thinking</b> in terms of their skills to relate phenomena. A multilevel regression analysis showed that students who used mysteries in geography lessons reported significantly more correct geographical relationships than students who attended the regular curriculum.

By exploring the potential role of GIs for enhancing market access while promoting rural and sustainable development and aiding the preservation of biodiversity and traditional knowledge, the chapter shows how the relevance of GIs for Southern countries extend beyond compliance with international legal obligations to include significant potential for unleashing beneficial local dynamics in Southern territories.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{injunction}} to {{experiment in the}} social sciences and, more specifically, geography. This is both a geography of certain ways of thinking experiment, and an exploration of how particular strands of <b>geographical</b> <b>thinking</b> are being re-imagined and reworked as experimental under the influence of ideas and practices from within and beyond the discipline. Against the backdrop of recent debates about the status of experiment, it poses a number of key questions {{about what it means to}} be experimental, how experimental practices emerge and travel, and how these processes are inflected by the organization and atmospheres of particular sites of experimentation. These questions are addressed through a form of attentive participation at four key sites: The SenseLab and the Topological Media Lab in Montreal, the Institut für Raumexperimente in Berlin, and FoAM in Brussels. Based upon these encounters, and drawing upon the work of a range of exemplary experimentalists, the thesis develops the argument that there are new spaces of experiment which are worthy of such examination as part of a renewal of experimentation within <b>geographical</b> <b>thinking.</b> As such, the thesis outlines the logics of these forms of experiment and proposes the notion of ecologies of experiment. It also speculates on the possibilities for re-imagining what constitutes a geographical experiment, foregrounding the necessity of reactivating experiment as an ongoing ethos that needs careful cultivation and tending.

40|$|In {{the case}} of {{geography}} the cultural turn can be understood in three ways and we will define {{it in terms of}} three types of cases: 1. Varying emphases in the research and study of cultural geographical subjects. 2. A new general trend affecting not only cultural geography but also <b>geographical</b> <b>thinking</b> as a whole and 3. A change in the overall intellectual attitude of geographers. In this paper we shall limit ourselves to analyzing certain tendencies in <b>geographical</b> <b>thinking</b> that {{are a part of the}} cultural turn, highlighting - in the second case - what is happening today. This turn can be understood as described by Bergson in “L’Evolution Créatrice” (Bergson, 1907; Wright, 1947) when the attributed the idea of “becoming” to qualitative, evolutionary or extensive movement. The revaluation of what is qualitative would be a welcome alternative to the unbridled cult of the quantitative that has governed the last decades. Or, as Sorokin called it, to the “quantophrenia” to which geography has been no exception (Sorokin, 1964). The evolutionary movement is to be noted when we contrast the normal interest that has always been manifested in the diverse processes of change on the face of the Earth with the accent now laid on the idea of ecological catastrophe. And finally the extensive movement might be considered as a more interactive and global vision of the Earth, going beyond the limits of traditional geography. Cultural tendencies are those that affect what is geographical in toto, in all its branches. These include geosophy, the purely sociological approach, an ideological approach and globalization - that we shall now proceed to analyze one by one...|$|R

In what ways does eco-cosmopolitanism enable us to cultivate ecocritical thinking that addresses environmental issues in various scales (local, national, transnational, global), while resisting the risk of reproducing the deep ecological cliché that everything on earth is simply connected as a global unity? By focusing on three Hong Kong documentaries, The Way of Paddy (2013), Open Road after Harvest (2015) and Kong Rice (2015) – which contemplate upon Hong Kong’s agricultural industry, rural-urban conflicts {{in the name of}} development, and the material significance and symbolic meaning of “leisure farming”, this paper explores the ideological conflicts between place attachment and eco-cosmopolitanism tendencies, rural and urban, individual and government, intellectual and the masses. To offer a post-urban perspective, this paper explores whether the phenomenon of “leisure farming” hints at a possibility of going beyond the boundary set between the rural and the urban? To phrase it in another way, would the “rural” turn in Hong Kong hints at a shift from urban to rural, and see rural not as a metaphoric or social construct but instead focus on soil’s material agency as a matter that “produce (helpful, harmful) effects in human and other bodies. “ (Bennett, 2010 : xii) ...|$|R
40|$|Environmental Education (EE) as a {{development}} cannot be ignored by Geography or Geographers particularly since South Africa, {{as the rest}} of the world, is confronted by a looming environmental crisis.

Geography has a vital role to play in addressing environmental issues. In formal education Geography teachers will be responsible for the implementation of such an approach. This study therefore investigates the perceptions of Natal Senior Secondary School Geography teachers regarding the role of EE in Geography. Questionnaires and semi-structured interviews were used to determine this.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} the emergence of mobile ethnography and its potential benefits to the discipline of geography. The rise of mobile ethnography has been linked with the so-called “new mobilities paradigm”, which has become especially important in <b>geographical</b> <b>thinking</b> over the past ten years. Erstwhile focused on more static concepts, such as space, place or landscape, geography is today rife with theories and analyses of movement, mobility and flow. In spite of that, mobile ethnography can soon claim a preeminent status within the discipline. In this paper, I document the rise of this methodology, focusing myself on three main aspects. The first is to attempt a definition of mobile ethnography itself. The second is to enlist some recent examples of its usages. The third is to provide several strategies and techniques arising from my own work. This paper might, thus, be useful to senior undergraduate and postgraduate students focused on qualitative research methods in geography...|$|R

We draw out these geographies by way of the depths and passages of Irigaray’s (1993) fluid ontology of touch. From here we explore the ‘creative rethinking’ of matter that the installation develops, exploring the organismic topographies that it develops which stand against nano-imaginaries of matter that are focused either on the corporeal violence of nano-splatter, or the understanding of nanotechnologies through the mastery and control of matter...|$|R
40|$|Both {{responsibility}} and care {{have much to}} offer in thinking through the relationalities {{that make up a}} postcolonial world. Although contemporary political systems often posit {{responsibility and}} care within the context of individuated and autonomous selves, geographers have done much to relocate responsibility and care within narratives of interdependency – spatially and temporally. They have argued that both terms offer a route for <b>thinking</b> about ethical <b>geographical</b> relations between myriad places. In this article we take this project further, by looking at how the nature and shape of these relationships might be construed in a postcolonial world. We suggest that, through a more critical engagement with postcolonial thinking, any exploration of existing practices of responsibility and care will not only reveal the enormous potential of imagining these geographies as forms of existing and evolving relationalities, but will also lead us to interrogate the deployments of these terms in the context of past and present inequalities. We show that routing care and responsibility through postcolonial geographies moves us towards a more pragmatic responsiveness, one that involves a ‘care-full’ recognition of postcolonial interaction.

40|$|Geography {{has long}} been a {{predominantly}} visual discipline, but recent work in geography has sought to explore the multisensory, embodied, emotional and affective dimensions of people’s relations with places. One way to engage this type of exploration is through the use of sound walks: walks along a specified route accompanied by a soundtrack (on headphones or stationary speakers) that conveys information, enacts a story, produces an ambience or atmosphere, or illuminates certain aspects of the environment through which the listener is walking. This thesis aims to show how geographers can benefit from using sound walks as thinking tools, representational tools and teaching tools. Drawing on my own experiences producing sound walks, I first examine the ways that sound walk production processes help generate productive <b>geographical</b> <b>thinking</b> for those producing sound walks (Chapter Two).

To answer the first question, Part 1 deals with the uncertainty of an exurban concept as a primary example, since there are many different definitions of exurbanization and the spatial boundaries based on them are not identical. Several definitions of exurbanization are investigated to determine how they represent exurban areas, and formal representations of the fuzzy-set approach are developed to analyze and visualize the uncertainty of the exurban definitions. The study develops a software interface that would allow interactive exploration, analysis, negotiation, and visualization of uncertain geographical concepts.

40|$|This article {{offers a}} {{geographical}} {{investigation into the}} production of a collaborative art project called Tribe (2013). Adopting a site-based approach, it contemplates Tribe as emerging from a collection of processual and contingent relations beyond its collaborative form. This draws the understanding of its production away from just the artist and collaborating youth group, towards the situated relations that unfolded through the artwork’s spatio-temporal specificity. It does so by empirically tracing the gradual emergence of exhibition features through the workshops held by the artist with collaborators. In doing so, the article argues for a delineation between ‘collaboration’ and ‘co-production’, where co-production is the emergence of localised relations and collaboration is understood as the acknowledgement of a selection of this co-production. Such an approach advances <b>geographical</b> <b>thinking</b> by moving the understanding of collaborative artistic production away from a practice sovereign to the artist and chosen others, towards something which is supported by a broader, specific collection of co-productive relations. The article concludes by suggesting how this site-based approach could be applied to geographical research into other forms of art production...|$|R
