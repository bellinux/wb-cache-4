5|$|The Old White Hart Inn is Grade II listed, and {{described}} as a late 16th-century building. The building was an end entry house but it is unclear when it became an inn. It has been suspected that the building was previously used as a courthouse, but <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> been proved. Moreover, tokens were given out under the Old White Hart's name in the 18th century.|$|E

5|$|Appearing from January to April, A. ocreata occurs {{later in}} the year than other amanitas except A. calyptroderma. It is found in mixed {{woodland}} on the Pacific coast of North America, from Washington south through California to Baja California in Mexico. It may feasibly occur on Vancouver Island in British Columbia though <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> been confirmed. It forms ectomycorrhizal relationships and is found in association with coast live oak (Quercus agrifolia), as well as hazel (Corylus spp.). In Oregon and Washington, it may also be associated with the Garry oak (Quercus garryana).|$|E
5|$|Chard was a {{key point}} on the Taunton Stop Line, a World War II {{defensive}} line consisting of pillboxes and anti-tank obstacles, which runs from Axminster north to the Somerset coast near Highbridge. In 1938 a bomb proof bunker was built behind the branch of the Westminster Bank. During the war {{it was used to}} hold duplicate copies of the bank records in case its headquarters in London was destroyed. It was also used to store the emergency bank note supply of the Bank of England. There has also been speculation that the Crown Jewels were also stored there, however <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> been confirmed.|$|E
5|$|The Cleveland Street scandal {{occurred}} in 1889, when a homosexual male brothel in Cleveland Street, Fitzrovia, London, {{was discovered by}} police. The government was accused of covering up the scandal to protect the names of aristocratic and other prominent patrons. At the time, sexual acts between men were illegal in Britain, and the brothel's clients faced possible prosecution and certain social ostracism if discovered. It was rumoured that Prince Albert Victor, the eldest son of the Prince of Wales and second-in-line to the British throne had visited, though <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> been substantiated. Unlike overseas newspapers, the English press never named the Prince, but the allegation influenced {{the handling of the}} case by the authorities, and has coloured biographers' perceptions of him since.|$|E

5|$|Hsu was {{reportedly}} born on 7 July 1898, in Shantou prefecture of China, {{during the reign}} of the Manchu Qing dynasty, although <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> been independently verified. When Hsu was young, her father walked out on the family for another woman. Her mother, who was illiterate, had to fend for the three girls and one brother singlehandedly. At 16, her family moved to Penang in Malaya, where they worked as cleaners in a convent. As {{she did not want to}} be a cleaner all her life, Hsu asked the nuns there to allow her to study with the children, and they agreed. Combining study with work, she passed her Senior Cambridge examinations four years later. Equipped with a basic education, she ventured to Hong Kong to work and, later, to Chongqing, China, where she became a secretary and bookkeeper at a German news agency in the 1930s. She quit her job to become a volunteer, helping the injured during the Sino-Japanese War.|$|E
5|$|Safeties are {{the least}} common method of scoring in American {{football}} but are not rare occurrencesâ€“ since 1932, a safety has occurred once every 14.31 games in the National Football League (NFL), or {{about once a week}} under current scheduling rules. On October 21, 1973, Fred Dryer, playing for the Los Angeles Rams against the Green Bay Packers, became the only player in NFL History to score two safeties in a single game. A much rarer occurrence is the one-point safety, which can be scored by the offense on an extra point or two-point conversion attempt; those have occurred at least twice in NCAA Division I football since 1996, most recently at the 2013 Fiesta Bowl. No conversion safeties have occurred since at least 1940 in the NFL. A conversion safety by the defense is also possible, though highly unlikely; although <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> occurred, it is the only possible way a team could finish with a single point in an American football game.|$|E

25|$|In other {{variants}} of snooker {{the value of}} the maximum break is different. In six-red snooker, the maximum is only 75 points, as there are fewer reds and thus fewer black-scoring opportunities. In snooker plus the maximum is 210 due to the additional, two high point-value colours, but <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> been achieved due to the distance between the highest value ball and the reds.|$|E
25|$|Ostriches have co-existed {{with another}} lineage of flightless didactyl birds, the eogruids.
