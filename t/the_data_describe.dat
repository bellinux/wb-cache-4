40|$|Interoperability is the {{transfer}} {{and use of}} information in a uniform and efficient manner across multiple organisations and IT systems.

Data integration is the process which takes heterogeneous data and their structural information and produces a unified description and mapping information to allow seamless access to all existing data. Interpretation of these data must be unambiguous. More generally, interoperability goes beyond data compatibility as we also need interoperable hardware, software, and communication protocols to allow data to be interpreted correctly and unambiguously across system or organisational boundaries...|$|E
40|$|Abstract [...] The depth {{distribution}} ofillite/smectite (I/S) compositions {{was investigated}} for a well drilled {{to a depth}} of 3462 m on Barbados Island, the only subaerial exposure of the Barbados accretionary complex. The classical pattern of increasing percentage of illite interlayers in the mixed-layer clay with increasing burial depth was not observed. Rather, <b>the</b> <b>data</b> <b>describe</b> an irregular, zig-zag trend with depth. This trend is probably the result of reverse faulting in the section. I/S data were also used to infer several kilometers of uplift and subsequent erosion of the section. This study shows that irregular patterns of clay diagenesis with depth can be anticipated for sequences that have undergone complicated tectonism and deformation. Combined with other geologic information, these patterns can help to determine the tectonic history of the sedimentary sequence...|$|E

40|$|Much {{remains unknown}} of the {{phylogeny}} {{and evolution of}} Mycobacterium tuberculosis, an organism that kills 2 million people annually.

The lineages are strongly geographically associated. Nucleotide substitutions proven to cause drug resistance are distributed throughout the tree, whereas nonsynonymous base substitutions unrelated to drug resistance have a restricted distribution. The phylogenetic structure is concordant with all the previously described genotypic and phenotypic groupings of M. tuberculosis strains and provides a unifying framework for both epidemiologic and evolutionary analysis of M. tuberculosis populations...|$|E

Similarly, for the metabolite doxorubicinol, we obtained 126 data points, which become 869 patient-data points when multiplied by the number of patients.
