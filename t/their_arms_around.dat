5|$|In 1895, surgeon J. W. Ballantyne {{considered}} {{the case of}} the Biddenden Maids from a teratological perspective. He suggested that they had in fact been pygopagus (twins joined at the pelvis). Pygopagus twins are known to put <b>their</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> each other's shoulders when walking, and Ballantyne suggested that this accounted for their apparently being joined at the shoulders in drawings. The pygopagus Millie and Christine McCoy had lived in Britain for a short time before going on to a successful singing career in the United States, and it was known from their case that such twins were capable of surviving to adulthood.|$|E
5|$|Historian Nancy Rabinowitz {{argues that}} ancient Greek red vase images portraying women with <b>their</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> another woman's waist, or leaning on a woman's {{shoulders}} can {{be construed as}} expressions of romantic desire. Much of {{the daily lives of}} women in ancient Greece is unknown, specifically their expressions of sexuality. Although men participated in pederastic relationships outside marriage, there is no clear evidence that women were allowed or encouraged to have same-sex relationships before or during marriage as long as their marital obligations were met. Women who appear on Greek pottery are depicted with affection, and in instances where women appear only with other women, their images are eroticized: bathing, touching one another, with dildos placed in and around such scenes, and sometimes with imagery also seen in depictions of heterosexual marriage or pederastic seduction. Whether this eroticism is for the viewer or an accurate representation of life is unknown.|$|E
5|$|The next day's {{stage was}} preceded by a minute's silence, and ridden as a {{procession}} in Weylandt's memory. In keeping with convention, there was no competitive racing. Each of the 23 teams took {{to the front of}} the peloton for about 15 minutes, and the remaining Leopard Trek squad, along with Farrar, were allowed to finish first with <b>their</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> each other. Millar led the rest of the field across the line a few seconds later. No results for the stage were recorded, and it did not count towards the general classification or any of the points competitions. After the stage, instead of any podium presentations, the four jersey classification leaders (Millar, Alessandro Petacchi, Gianluca Brambilla, and Jan Bakelants) appeared on stage with the Leopard Trek team to lead another moment of silence. Subsequently, Farrar and the remaining Leopard Trek squad all decided to leave the race. Feillu did not want to leave the Giro, feeling that continuing to race would have been the best way to honor Weylandt, but he did not mind acquiescing to his teammates' will. For most of them, the decision was based on a desire to attend Weylandt's funeral, which took place nine days after his death. Members of the Giro squad served as pallbearers. Other teammates, as well as Farrar, members of Weylandt's former team , and Giro director Angelo Zomegnan were all in attendance, along with hundreds of cycling fans assembled outside the chapel.|$|E

25|$|Public touch {{can serve}} as a ‘tie sign’ that shows others that your partner is “taken”. When a couple is holding hands, putting <b>their</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> each other, this is a ‘tie sign’ showing others that you are together. The use of ‘tie signs’ are used more often by couples in the dating and {{courtship}} stages than between their married counterparts according to Burgoon, Buller, and Woodall.|$|E
25|$|A player may tackle an {{opposing}} {{player who has}} the ball by bringing them to ground. Once tackled, a player must immediately release the ball, either by passing to a teammate or placing it on the ground, and the tackler must release them and move away. After the ball has been released by a tackled player, players from either side may try to regain possession of the ball. Tacklers cannot tackle above the shoulder (the neck and head are out of bounds), and the tackler has to attempt to wrap <b>their</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> the player being tackled to complete the tackle. It is illegal to push, shoulder-charge, or to trip a player using feet or legs, but hands may be used (this being {{referred to as a}} tap-tackle or ankle-tap). Tackles that involve lifting a player and then forcing or dropping them to the ground head first (called a tip tackle or spear tackle) have been deemed particularly dangerous. A player performing this sort of tackle would typically be sent-off.|$|E
50|$|The wrestler wraps <b>their</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> {{the opponents}} neck as if {{performing}} a sleeper hold, then climbs {{to the second}} rope and hangs the opponent by the neck. This move is illegal due to usage of the ring ropes, and results in a disqualification for the wrestler should they not release the hold before a count of five.|$|R

The fighter's palm should be facing their own chest. With the other hand, the fighter grasps the first hand, ensuring {{that they have not}} reached <b>around</b> the enemy's <b>arm,</b> and pulls upward with both hands.

500|$|Team manager Gibbs {{reported}} {{that at the}} end of the first day's play the Australian dressing room was stunned into silence. Egar asked Benaud for permission to enter, and after the Australian captain allowed him in, the umpire sat quietly for a period before speaking to some other players and then to Meckiff. The pair were close friends, and shook hands before putting <b>their</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> one another's shoulders. The condemned bowler did not take Egar's judgment personally and did not have hard feelings about the incident. Egar claimed to be [...] "the second most upset person in the world", and later added that he thought Meckiff's first ball was suspect. He said that he could have called more deliveries, but was worried whether the over would ever end.|$|E
500|$|The peloton {{chose not}} to run stage four {{competitively}} following Weylandt's death; instead the stage was ridden as a procession in his memory. The remaining members of his team , as well as training partner Tyler Farrar from the [...] squad, crossed the finish line first with <b>their</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> one another before withdrawing from the race that evening. Stage 5 was held on the dirt roads of Tuscany, which had provided {{for one of the}} more spectacular stages in the 2010 Giro d'Italia. Dutch rider Pieter Weening won the stage with an 8-second time gap against the field. That, coupled with the 20-second time bonus for winning the day, gave him the pink jersey. There was some stability in the overall standings at this point, as the race's top riders finished together, or nearly so, in the next three stages.|$|E
500|$|Race {{director}} Angelo Zomegnan {{said in a}} post-stage {{press conference}} that race officials would respect whatever decision the peloton made regarding the next day's stage.

500|$|On January 26, 2014 {{the couple}} opened the 56th Annual Grammy Awards in Los Angeles, {{performing}} the song live {{together for the}} first time. The performance opened with Beyoncé sporting wet-look hair in a leotard and a leather basque, sitting on a chair {{with her back to the}} audience. She conctinued seductively dancing cabaret-style, singing and gyrating on the dark stage surrounded by smoke. Jay-Z appeared to rap his verses dressed in a suit and bow tie. The sexually-charged performance ended with a kiss and the two walked off with <b>their</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> each other. Beyoncé's chair dance received comparisons with scenes from the movie Flashdance, the song's music video and the video for [...] "Partition"; VH1's Emily Exton felt that it was one of the best chair dances of all time. The duet was described as [...] "scorching" [...] and [...] "chill inducing" [...] with many critics considering the performance to be a show highlight; Lily Harrison of E! added that the pair [...] "set the bar impossibly high". A Rolling Stone editor felt it was [...] "near flawless". Nadeska Alexis writing for MTV News noted that when the singer started singing the first verses of the song, [...] "you could almost taste the aroma of sex appeal in the air". A negative review came from Beverly Beckham of The Boston Globe who felt that the pair failed to showcase love in the lyrics and performance.|$|E

50|$|The wrestler {{applying}} the hold positions himself behind his opponent. The wrestler then wraps <b>their</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> the opponent's neck, pressing the biceps against {{one side of}} the neck and the inner bone of the forearm against the other side. The neck is squeezed inside the arm very tightly. Additional pressure can be applied by grabbing the left shoulder with the right hand, or grabbing the biceps of the left arm near the elbow, then using the left hand to push the opponent's head towards the crook of the right elbow.|$|R

[...] He was particularly close {{to the children of}} his brother Konstantin.

2500|$|At {{least four}} veined octopus (Amphioctopus marginatus) {{individuals}} were witnessed retrieving coconut shells, manipulating them, stacking them, transporting them some distance (up to 20 metres), and then reassembling {{them to use}} as a shelter. The octopuses use coconut shells discarded by humans which have eventually settled in the ocean. They probe their arms down to loosen the mud, then rotate the shells out. After turning the shells so the open side faces upwards, the octopuses blow jets of mud out of the bowl before extending <b>their</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> the shell—or if they have two halves, stacking them first, one inside the other. They then stiffen their legs and move away in a manner which has been called [...] "stilt-walking". The octopuses eventually use the shells as a protective shelter in areas where little other shelter exists. If they just have one half, they simply turn it over and hide underneath. But if they are lucky enough to have retrieved two halves, they assemble them back into the original closed coconut form and sneak inside. This behaviour [...] The authors of the research article claimed this behaviour falls under the definition of tool use because the shells are carried for later use. However, this argument remains contested by a number of other biologists who state that the shells actually provide continuous protection from abundant bottom-dwelling predators in their home range.|$|E
