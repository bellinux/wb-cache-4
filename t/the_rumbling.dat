25|$|Contracting muscles produce {{vibration}} and sound. Slow twitch fibers produce 10 to 30 contractions {{per second}} (equivalent to 10 to 30Hz sound frequency). Fast twitch fibers produce 30 to 70 contractions per second (equivalent to 30 to 70Hz sound frequency). The vibration can be witnessed and felt by highly tensing one's muscles, as when making a firm fist. The sound {{can be heard}} by pressing a highly tensed muscle against the ear, again a firm fist is a good example. The sound is usually described as a rumbling sound. Some individuals can voluntarily produce this rumbling sound by contracting the tensor tympani muscle of the middle ear. <b>The</b> <b>rumbling</b> sound can also be heard when the neck or jaw muscles are highly tensed as when yawning deeply.|$|E
25|$|The final {{air attack}} mission (code-named Mad Dog Flight) {{comprised}} five B-26s, four {{of which were}} manned by American CIA contract air crews and pilots from the Alabama Air Guard. One FAR Sea Fury (piloted by Douglas Rudd) and two FAR T-33s (piloted by Rafael del Pino and Alvaro Prendes) shot down two of these B-26s, killing four American airmen. Combat air patrols were flown by Douglas A4D-2N Skyhawk jets of VA-34 squadron operating from USS Essex, with nationality and other markings removed. Sorties were flown to reassure Brigade soldiers and pilots, and to intimidate Cuban government forces without directly engaging in acts of war. At 10 am, a tank battle had broken out, with the brigadista holding their line until about 2:00 pm, which led Olvia to order a retreat into Girón. Following the last air attacks, San Román ordered his paratroopers and {{the men of the}} 3rd Battalion to launch a surprise attack, which was initially successful, but soon failed. With the brigadistas in disorganized retreat, the Cuban Army and militiamen started to advance rapidly, taking San Blas and only being stopped outside of Girón at about 11 am. Later that afternoon, San Román heard <b>the</b> <b>rumbling</b> of the advancing T-34s and reported with no more mortar rounds and bazooka rounds, he could not stop the tanks and ordered his men to fall back to the beach. Oliva arrived afterwards to find that the brigadistas were all heading out to the beach or retreating into the jungle or swamps. Without direct air support, and short of ammunition, Brigade 2506 ground forces retreated to the beaches in the face of considerable onslaught from Cuban government artillery, tanks and infantry.|$|E
500|$|Several critics {{mentioned}} Bertin's hands. Twentieth-century {{art historian}} Albert Boime described them as [...] "powerful, vulturine... grasping his thighs in a gesture... projecting... enormous strength controlled". Some contemporary critics {{were not so}} kind. The photographer and critic Félix Tournachon was harshly critical, and disparaged {{what he saw as}} a [...] "fantastical bundle of flesh... under which, instead of bones and muscles, there can only be intestines – this flatulent hand, <b>the</b> <b>rumbling</b> of which I can hear!" [...] Bertin's hands made a different impression on the critic F. de Lagenevais, who remarked: [...] "A mediocre artist would have modified them, he would have replaced those swollen joints with the cylindrical fingers of the first handy model; but by this single alteration he would have changed the expression of the whole personality... the energetic and mighty nature".|$|E

500|$|Many mammals {{communicate}} by vocalizing. Vocal communication serves many purposes, including in mating rituals, as warning calls, to indicate food sources, and for social purposes. Males often call during mating rituals {{to ward off}} other males and to attract females, as in the roaring of lions and red deer. The songs of the humpback whale may be signals to females; they have different dialects in {{different regions of the}} ocean. Social vocalizations include the territorial calls of gibbons, and the use of frequency in greater spear-nosed bats to distinguish between groups. The vervet monkey gives a distinct alarm call for each of at least four different predators, and the reactions of other monkeys vary according to the call. For example, if an alarm call signals a python, the monkeys climb into the trees, whereas the eagle alarm causes monkeys to seek a hiding place on the ground. Prairie dogs similarly have complex calls that signal the type, size, and speed of an approaching predator. Elephants communicate socially with a variety of sounds including snorting, screaming, trumpeting, roaring and rumbling. Some of <b>the</b> <b>rumbling</b> calls are infrasonic, below the hearing range of humans, and can be heard by other elephants up to [...] away at still times near sunrise and sunset.|$|E
500|$|Stephen Thomas Erlewine {{thought that}} [...] "Thunder" [...] and [...] "Fire Under My Feet" [...] {{were some of}} Lewis's [...] "strongest compositions" [...] to date, and added that they are [...] "sharply crafted and passionate".

He listed [...] "Thunder" [...] in his top four tracks to {{download}} from I Am, along with [...] "Another Love Song, [...] "Power" [...] and [...] "I Got You". Both Kathy Iandoli and Robbie Daw of Idolator praised [...] "Thunder": the former described the track as [...] "equally anthemic" [...] as [...] "Fire Under My Feet" [...] while the latter wrote that it is a [...] "soulful, soaring ballad" [...] which, as with many of Lewis' songs, is difficult not to get immersed in with its strong emotional sentiment. Knoxville News Sentinel writer Chuck Campbell highlighted it as one of the albums many great tracks, writing [...] "Lewis lassoes <b>the</b> <b>rumbling</b> beat of opener 'Thunder' to announce her return – and she’s off from there." [...] Next Magazine writer Benjamin Lindsay picked [...] "Thunder" [...] as a [...] "standout" [...] song on I Am, along with [...] "Fire Under My Feet", [...] "The Essence of Me" [...] and [...] "You Knew Me When". In the United States, [...] "Thunder" [...] peaked at number 29 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart for one week. It peaked at number 25 on the Adult Pop Songs chart and spent seven weeks charting, and number 12 on the Dance Club Songs chart. It has also peaked at number 21 in Hungary, number 98 in the Czech Republic and number 100 in Slovakia.|$|E

2500|$|The {{village of}} East Conemaugh was next.

From his idle locomotive in the town's railyard, the engineer John Hess heard and felt <b>the</b> <b>rumbling</b> of the approaching flood. Throwing his locomotive into reverse, Hess raced backward toward East Conemaugh, the whistle blowing constantly. His warning saved many people who reached high ground. When the flood hit, it picked up the locomotive and floated it aside; Hess himself survived, but at least 50 people died, including about 25 passengers stranded on trains in the town.|$|E
2500|$|A {{parallel}} {{recovery of}} Sămănătorist views is argued {{to have taken}} place in the Soviet Union's Moldavian SSR, formed from the bulk of the Bessarabia upon the 1940 breakup of Greater Romania. While the local population's cultural identification with Romania was officially discouraged and repressed during the adoption of Moldovenist ideology, the rural aesthetics of Sămănătorism were adapted to the proletarian themes favored by official culture. This phenomenon was later described by literary critic Iulian Ciocan in terms of cultural synthesis: [...] "Sămănătorism was harnessed to <b>the</b> <b>rumbling</b> wagon of proletkultism. The original ideology was, of course, retouched. 'National specificity' was replaced with 'social class specificity', subordinated to 'proletarian internationalism', and the contrast between the idyllic village and the dehumanized city [...] is supplanted by the animosity between the agricultural proletariat and the (petty) bourgeoisie. The working class, attenuating the rift between village and city, is called to the forefront." [...] According to Ciocan, the reaction against this merger was less significant than in Romania, even though postmodern authors also emerged in the Moldavian SSR.|$|E
2500|$|As well as {{progressively}} shorter titles, Tyrannosaurus Rex's albums {{began to}} show higher production values, more accessible songwriting from Bolan, and experimentation with electric guitars and a true rock sound. A breakthrough had been [...] "King of <b>the</b> <b>Rumbling</b> Spires" [...] (recorded with Took and released in summer 1969 shortly prior to his departure), which used a full rock band setup, and the electric sound had been further explored on A Beard of Stars. The group's next album, T. Rex, continued the process of simplification by shortening the name, and completed the move to electric guitars. Visconti supposedly got fed up with writing the name out in full on studio charts and tapes and began to abbreviate it; when Bolan first noticed he was angry but later claimed the idea was his. The new sound was more pop-oriented, and the first single, [...] "Ride a White Swan" [...] released in October 1970 made the Top 10 in the UK by late November and reached number two in January 1971. In early 1971, T. Rex reached the top 20 of the UK Albums Chart.|$|E

2500|$|Earlier {{during the}} month, the CAAC had {{approved}} the temporary operations of charter flights between mainland China and Taiwan. On {{the same day}} as the widebody orders, a China Southern Airlines Boeing 777-200 took off from Guangzhou and landed in Taipei the following day, becoming the first mainland Chinese aircraft to land in the Republic of China since 1949, when the Kuomintang were involved in Chinese Civil War with the Communist Party of China. The flight carried 242 passengers home after the Lunar New Year. Previously, passengers travelling between the mainland and Taiwan had to transit through a third port such as Hong Kong or Macau. Within three years, in July 2008, a China Southern Airlines Airbus A330 carrying 230 tourists again landed in Taipei. The governments of China and Taiwan had both agreed to allow direct flights across the Taiwan Strait in June, ending six decades of limited air travel between the two sides.

Knowing that {{there is no other way}} to bring him back to the living, Hook wants Emma to go on without him and decides that it's time to say goodbye and vows not to let her be his unfinished business. Emma agrees not to put her emotional armor back up once they are separated. When Emma returns, she's on to Hades' and the Blind Witch's scheme to leave the outsiders in the Underworld, and she and Regina use their magic to free everyone, while Henry leaves behind the [...] "Once Upon a Time" [...] storybook with the details on the “unfinished business” of all the remaining Underworld residents. Finally, Gold places Robin's heart into Pan's, only for Pan to discover that Gold tricked his father: Gold had returned Robin's heart to Robin earlier, while Pan was distracted. Instead, he had replaced the heart with a wineskin filled with water from the River of Lost Souls, which was enchanted with a glamour spell to resemble Robin's heart. Gold tells a stunned Pan that he did this to keep him from getting the happy ending that a villain like him never deserved, as Pan dissolves into the River of Lost Souls. Then, Gold uses Pandora's Box to contain Belle safely, before leaving through the portal. Afterwards, all people, except for David and Emma, enter the portal. A heartbroken Emma explains to David that she needs to protect her loved ones. David understands and then takes Emma through the portal, just as it closes.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>rumble</b> strips {{have proven}} to provide a good {{protection}} against the run-off-the-road type of accidents. However, installing them on the local and community roads has raised many concerns among the cyclists.

The majority of the reported concerns are those regarding the ride comfort and controllability of a bicycle traversing <b>the</b> <b>rumble</b> strip patterns. <b>The</b> ride discomfort and controllability of a bicycle traveling on <b>the</b> <b>rumble</b> strips are experimentally investigated by considering a comprehensive test matrix involving: (1) the conventional and suspended bicycles; (2) different rumble strip patterns and traversing speeds; (3) oblique angle of approach to rumble strip; (4) multiple trials and (5) seven test subjects.
