2500|$|The {{solution}} is to burn out each rivet with an oxygen torch. The hole is then prepared to a precise diameter with a reamer. A special locator bolt, consisting of a head, a shaft matching the reamed hole, and a <b>threaded</b> <b>end</b> is inserted and retained with a nut, then tightened with a wrench. As the bolt has been formed from an appropriate high-strength alloy and has also been heat-treated, [...] it {{is not subject to}} either the plastic shear failure typical of hot rivets nor the brittle fracture of ordinary bolts. Any partial failure will be in the plastic flow of the metal secured by the bolt; with proper engineering any such failure should be non-catastrophic.|$|E

50|$|Flexolets {{are like}} weldolets {{with a minor}} {{distinction}} i.e. flexolet has straight bore while weldolet has decreased bore. We give flexolets butt weld, socket weld and <b>threaded</b> <b>ends.</b> Hence, you can pick any of them as per the piping applications.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Threaded</b> <b>end</b> cylinders: Ends are {{screwed onto}} the tube body. The {{reduction}} of material can weaken {{the tube and}} may introduce thread concentricity problems to the system.|$|E
5000|$|Anchor bolt - Bolt {{designed}} to allow objects to be attached to concrete. The bolt head is usually placed in concrete before it has cured, leaving the <b>threaded</b> <b>end</b> exposed.|$|E
50|$|A {{cylindrical}} blank, {{which is}} usually slightly less than the required diameter, is machined with a taper (chamfer) at the <b>threaded</b> <b>end.</b> This chamfer allows the die to ease onto the blank before it cuts a sufficient thread to pull itself along.|$|E
50|$|Fasteners take various forms, {{for example}} with <b>threaded</b> <b>ends</b> {{to use as}} an {{embedded}} bolt, with washers at the tips that grip softer material etc. Fasteners used in powder-actuated tools are manufactured from special steel and heat-treated to produce a very hard yet ductile fastener. Those properties are necessary for the fastener to penetrate concrete or steel without breaking.|$|R
50|$|Some square tapered {{bottom bracket}} axles are <b>threaded</b> at the <b>ends</b> and use nuts. Other square tapered bottom {{brackets}} are hollow or not and crank bolts <b>thread</b> into the <b>ends.</b>|$|R
25|$|The five {{characters}} go {{onto the}} surface, where {{they find it}} desolate. Zaphod suggests that the Magratheans lived {{beneath the surface of}} the planet. They split into two groups – Trillian, Zaphod and Ford explore a tunnel, whilst Arthur and Marvin remain on the surface. Trillian, Zaphod and Ford's <b>thread</b> <b>ends</b> on a cliff-hanger, with them seeing something alarming at the end of the corridor.|$|R
50|$|B16.11- Forged Fittings, Socket-Welding and Threaded. This Standard covers ratings, dimensions, tolerances, marking and {{material}} requirements for socket-welding and threaded forged fittings. These fittings are designated as Class 2000, 3000, and 6000 for <b>threaded</b> <b>end</b> fittings and Class 3000, 6000, and 9000 for socket-weld end fittings.|$|E
50|$|Nipolets {{is only a}} {{blend of}} olets with nipples. These olets work like the weldolets or threadolets, yet are with nipple. They come either with a plain end or a <b>threaded</b> <b>end.</b> You can utilize either as {{indicated}} by the applications. Nipolets are broadly utilized for vents, taps, or depletes (drains).|$|E
50|$|The bolt or axle has one or {{two holes}} drilled through its <b>threaded</b> <b>end.</b> The nut is torqued {{properly}} and then, if the slot is not aligned with {{the hole in the}} fastener, the nut is rotated forward to the nearest slot. The nut is then secured with a split pin/cotter pin, R-clip or safety wire. It is a positive locking device.|$|E
50|$|A short {{length of}} pipe having an MIP <b>thread</b> at both <b>ends</b> is {{sometimes}} called a nipple. A short pipe fitting having an FIP <b>thread</b> at both <b>ends</b> {{is sometimes called}} a coupling.|$|R

50|$|Double-butted spokes {{have reduced}} {{thickness}} over the center section and are lighter, more elastic, and more aerodynamic than spokes of uniform thickness. Single-butted spokes are thicker at the hub and then taper to a thinner section {{all the way}} to the threads at the rim. Triple-butted spokes also exist and are thickest at the hub, thinner at the <b>threaded</b> <b>end,</b> and thinnest in the middle.|$|E
50|$|The {{arrangements}} for adjusting the toe angle are not changed by introducing ball joints in the suspension, although {{it should be}} noted that the steering linkage itself must use 4 or more pivots, also usually ball joints, and in almost every vehicle ever made, some of these have been adjustable by having a <b>threaded</b> <b>end</b> and locknut, to enable the toe to be set precisely.|$|E
50|$|The twine {{is first}} {{threaded}} diagonally through the rope. The twine is then wrapped round the rope including the diagonally <b>threaded</b> <b>end.</b> A needle is {{then used to}} thread the two ends through the rope to enclose the wrapping turns. Finally a reef (square) or a string of reef (square) knots is tied. Then this string of reef (square) knots is pulled through the rope to bury the ends.|$|E
5000|$|A {{sucker rod}} is a steel rod, {{typically}} between 25 and 30 feet (7 to 9 meters) in length, and <b>threaded</b> at both <b>ends,</b> {{used in the}} oil industry to join together the surface and [...] components of a reciprocating piston pump installed in an oil well. The pumpjack is the visible above-ground drive for the well pump, and is connected to the downhole pump {{at the bottom of the}} well by a series of interconnected sucker rods. Sucker rods are also commonly available made of fiberglass in 37 1/2 foot lengths and diameters of 3/4, 7/8, 1, and 1 1/4 inch. These are terminated in metallic <b>threaded</b> <b>ends,</b> female at one end and male at the other.|$|R
5000|$|A snatch-block can {{be closed}} around a line, {{to grab the}} line, rather than <b>threading</b> the <b>end</b> of the line through the block.|$|R

5000|$|The third type of mandrel {{discussed}} {{here is that}} {{which is used to}} hold circular saw blades, buffing wheels (used for polishing), and sanding discs onto drills, circular saws, and similar power tools. A mandrel of this type generally consists of a cylinder, threaded on one end, with a washer brazed onto the <b>threaded</b> <b>end</b> and an accompanying screw and second washer used to clamp the circular saw blade, sanding media, or other rotary tool onto the mandrel.|$|E
50|$|Bracing wires must be {{carefully}} rigged to maintain the correct length and tension. In flight the wires tend to stretch under load and on landing some may become slack. Regular rigging checks are required and any necessary adjustments made before every flight. Rigging adjustments may {{also be used to}} set and maintain wing dihedral and angle of incidence, usually {{with the help of a}} clinometer and plumb-bob. Individual wires are fitted with turnbuckles or <b>threaded</b> <b>end</b> fittings so that they can be readily adjusted. Once set, the adjuster is locked in place.|$|E
50|$|An {{anchor bolt}} is a {{fastener}} used to attach objects or structures to concrete. There are {{many types of}} anchor bolts, consisting of designs that are mostly proprietary to the manufacturing companies. All consist of a <b>threaded</b> <b>end,</b> to which a nut and washer can be attached for the external load. Anchor bolts are extensively used on all types of projects, from standard buildings to dams and nuclear power plants. They {{can also be used}} to firmly affix embed plates to a concrete foundation when used with a structural steel element.|$|E
50|$|Small details {{differentiate}} flags produced between 1882 and 1897 {{from their}} predecessors. The canvas was square, 156 centimeter to a side; a ribbon of tricolored <b>thread</b> <b>ending</b> in tassels {{was attached to}} the flagpole. The lions holding up the coat of arms had gold teeth and claws this time, while the coat of arms was no longer bordered in maroon. In the middle of the shield, the coat of arms of the House of Hohenzollern was surrounded by a gold border.|$|R
50|$|When tied by <b>threading</b> the <b>end</b> {{and then}} the end is secured to the {{standing}} part, the knot {{is known as a}} bale sling hitch.|$|R
50|$|An {{example of}} a tool used for {{installation}} for a small plumbing pipe (<b>threaded</b> <b>ends)</b> is the pipe wrench. Small pipe is typically not heavy and can be lifted into place by the installation craft laborer. However, during a plant outage or shutdown, the small (small bore) pipe may also be pre-fabricated to expedite installation during the outage. After the pipe is installed it will be tested for leaks. Before testing it {{may need to be}} cleaned by blowing air or steam or flushing with a liquid.|$|R
50|$|The {{threaded}} pipes {{used in some}} plumbing installations for {{the delivery}} of fluids under pressure have a threaded section that is slightly conical. Examples are the NPT and BSP series. The seal provided by a threaded pipe joint is created when a tapered externally <b>threaded</b> <b>end</b> is tightened into an end with internal threads. Normally a good seal requires {{the application of a}} separate sealant in the joint, such as thread seal tape, or a liquid or paste pipe sealant such as pipe dope, however some threaded pipe joints do not require a separate sealant.|$|E
50|$|For safety, it {{is common}} to mouse a {{threaded}} shackle to keep the pin from coming loose. This is done by looping mousing wire or a nylon zip tie {{through the hole in the}} pin and around the shackle body. For pins that have a cross-hole in the <b>threaded</b> <b>end</b> a cotter pin can be used. One disadvantage of wire is that mousing can introduce galvanic corrosion because of material differences; it is especially bad when used in places where the shackle is exposed to air and water. Nylon is not recommended for use where significant movement of the shackle is expected.|$|E
5000|$|Apart from {{integral}} suppressors {{which are}} integrated {{as a part}} of the firearm's barrel, most suppressors have a [...] "female" [...] <b>threaded</b> <b>end,</b> which attaches to [...] "male" [...] threads cut into the exterior of the barrel. These types of suppressors are mostly used on handguns and rifles chambered in [...]22LR. More powerful rifles may use this type of attachment, but harsh recoil may cause the suppressor to over-tighten to the barrel and the suppressor can become difficult to remove. SilencerCo's Salvo suppressor for shotguns attaches via internal barrel threading normally used to mount removable chokes.|$|E
50|$|During repair, {{the tissues}} are {{securely}} held together {{long enough for}} biological healing to occur. One procedure involves threading long needles into the meniscus and out an incision {{in the back of}} the knee through the aid of a guide tube called a cannula. The suture <b>thread</b> <b>ends</b> are tied together on the outside of the knee capsule layer to bring the tear together. Another procedure requires specially designed devices that employ multiple sutures and knot pusher instruments to allow surgeons to provide excellent meniscal repair with just a single 1 ½” incision.|$|R
50|$|In 2008, Iceland {{was ranked}} 118th in total trade with Mexico and was ranked 4th among the {{countries}} of European Free Trade Association. In 2015, two-way trade amounted to $10.8 million USD. Mexico's exports to Iceland were: metal tubes with <b>threaded</b> <b>ends</b> (46.0%), motor vehicles (18.7%) and lactic acid (2.0%). The major imports from Iceland to Mexico were: cod liver oil (4.6%), gutted fish (3.1%) and roe (2.8%). In 2011, Icelandic manufactur and non-invasive orthopaedics equipment company, Össur, opened a manufacturing plant {{in the city of}} Tijuana, northern Mexico.|$|R
50|$|In an {{external}} (male) thread (e.g., on a bolt), the major diameter Dmaj and the minor diameter Dmin define maximum {{dimensions of the}} thread. This means that the external <b>thread</b> must <b>end</b> flat at Dmaj, but can be rounded out below the minor diameter Dmin. Conversely, in an internal (female) thread (e.g., in a nut), the major and minor diameters are minimum dimensions, therefore the <b>thread</b> profile must <b>end</b> flat at Dmin but may be rounded out beyond Dmaj.|$|R
