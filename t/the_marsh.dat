5|$|Although in {{some areas}} <b>the</b> <b>marsh</b> shrew is {{sympatric}} {{with other members of}} the genus Sorex, no other large, velvety, gray-black shrew shares this geographic range. Its size distinguishes it from all but the American water shrew (Sorex palustris). Although <b>the</b> <b>marsh</b> shrew and the American water shrew (the two largest shrews in North America) share some features, the American water shrew has more dark-grey-to-black fur on its back, a silver-grey belly and a bi-colored tail and <b>the</b> <b>marsh</b> shrew's fringed hairs are more distinct. The American water shrew has a smaller skull, without <b>the</b> <b>marsh</b> shrew's characteristic curvature, and its upper incisors have less-distinct medial tines. <b>The</b> <b>marsh</b> shrew typically has a longer snout than that of the American water shrew, which is more streamlined when viewed from the side.|$|E
5|$|Merriam and Goldman had {{recognized}} {{that a number}} of Central American species, including Oryzomys couesi and numerous forms with more limited distributions, are related to <b>the</b> <b>marsh</b> rice rat. O.couesi ranges north to southernmost Texas, where its distribution meets that of <b>the</b> <b>marsh</b> rice rat. In 1960, Raymond Hall argued that specimens from the contact zone were intermediate between the local forms of O.couesi and <b>the</b> <b>marsh</b> rice rat, and accordingly included the former in <b>the</b> <b>marsh</b> rice rat. While reporting on the ecology of Texan O.couesi in 1979, Benson and Gehlbach noted that populations of O.couesi and <b>the</b> <b>marsh</b> rice rat there were in fact distinct, with the latter being smaller and less brown and more gray in color; their karyotypes were also distinct. Since then, the two have generally been retained as distinct species, as supported by further research; a 1994 study even found the two to occur at some of the same places (in sympatry) in southern Texas and nearby Tamaulipas, Mexico.|$|E

5|$|Behavior {{is known}} mainly from <b>the</b> <b>marsh</b> rice rat and O.couesi, with some {{scattered}} {{data from the}} other species. Oryzomys are semiaquatic, spending {{much time in the}} water, and otherwise mainly live on the ground; both <b>the</b> <b>marsh</b> rice rat and O.couesi are known to be excellent swimmers and will flee into the water when disturbed. Both are also active during the night and build nests of interwoven vegetation, which may be suspended above the water. Breeding may occur throughout the year in both species, but is known to be seasonally variable in <b>the</b> <b>marsh</b> rice rat. In both, gestation takes about 21 to 28days and litter size is usually one to seven, averaging three to five. Young marsh rice rats and O.couesi become reproductively active when about 50days old.|$|E
5|$|Edward Alphonso Goldman revised North American Oryzomys in 1918 and {{consolidated}} {{many forms}} {{into a single}} species Oryzomys couesi, with ten subspecies distributed from southern Texas and western Mexico south to Costa Rica. He placed it in an Oryzomys palustris group with <b>the</b> <b>marsh</b> rice rat and several species with more limited distributions, which he regarded as related to O.couesi but distinctive enough to be classified as separate species. In the 1930s, a few more forms related to O.couesi were described. As then recognized, the ranges of <b>the</b> <b>marsh</b> rice rat, a United States species, and Oryzomys couesi meet in southern Texas. In 1960, Raymond Hall reviewed specimens from this contact zone and found no grounds on which to separate the two species; thus, he reduced O.couesi to a subspecies of <b>the</b> <b>marsh</b> rice rat. Other workers continued this lumping and by 1971 all other species Goldman had placed in the O.palustris group were classified under <b>the</b> <b>marsh</b> rice rat, together with Oryzomys azuerensis from Panama, described as a species in 1937.|$|E

5|$|In 2010, Delton Hanson {{and colleagues}} {{published}} {{a study of}} the relationships among populations of Oryzomys on the basis of data from three genes—the mitochondrial gene cytochrome b (Cytb) and two nuclear markers, exon 1 of the interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein gene (Rbp3) and intron 2 of alcohol dehydrogenase gene 1 (Adh1-I2). The Cytb data placed all marsh rice rats studied sister to a clade containing various populations of O.couesi; the mean genetic distance between the two groups was 11.30%. <b>The</b> <b>marsh</b> rice rats fell into two main groups, differing on average by 6.05%, one containing animals from Mississippi, southwestern Tennessee, and further west, and the other including specimens from Alabama and further east. Within the eastern group, variation was only about 0.65%, though examples of the putative subspecies O. p. palustris, O. p. coloratus, O. p. sanibeli, and O. p. planirostris were all included. Data from both of the slower-evolving nuclear markers Rbp3 and Adh1-I2 also placed examples of Oryzomys in two main clades, but did not recover the western and eastern groups of <b>the</b> <b>marsh</b> rice rat as separate clades. In addition, Adh1-I2 placed a Costa Rican population within <b>the</b> <b>marsh</b> rice rat clade and some other southern Oryzomys specimens closer to <b>the</b> <b>marsh</b> rice rat than to the O.couesi group. The combined data supported the western and eastern clades within <b>the</b> <b>marsh</b> rice rat and placed the Costa Rican population marginally closer to <b>the</b> <b>marsh</b> rice rat than to O.couesi. Using the genetic species concept, the authors suggested that the western populations of <b>the</b> <b>marsh</b> rice rat be recognized as a separate species, Oryzomys texensis. They recommended further research in the Mississippi–Alabama–Tennessee region, where the ranges of the two meet.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>marshes</b> {{started a}} long time ago. Around 5,000 years ago, <b>the</b> <b>marshes</b> started by <b>the</b> great rivers Tigris and Euphrates by {{collision}} impact. These rivers flooded the land to create <b>the</b> <b>marshes</b> and started a new ecosystem with new animals, birds, fish and plants. That made a great change in that time to original Sumerians and Babylonians who lived there. They lived off <b>the</b> <b>marshes</b> by fishing, hunting and planting. The people came to live in <b>the</b> <b>marshes</b> also, but time changed some of the people’s ideas and beliefs. With the break between the Shia and Mandaean forms of religion, the Shia Muslims came to dominate in <b>the</b> <b>marshes.</b> Some ideas of the original people changed because of this religion and the other ideas remained from the Sumerians. These ideas include fantastic stories about ghosts, curses and extraterrestrials. In 1990-1992 when the Iraq government decided to dry <b>the</b> <b>marshes</b> because they thought an armed group lived there, the population left. After the government decided to dry the water, some of them moved to the cities and the others moved to Iran. After the war in 2003 the Iraqi government open the water the marcher people returned to <b>the</b> <b>marshes.</b> Mashers are now true people of marshes around 5,000 in all of Iran and Iraq and the people like the all different kind of birds what came to marshes they are from different religion like Shia Islam, Mandaeism {{they have a different}} ceremony of marriage or believe the life together from long time ago and share <b>the</b> <b>marshes.</b>|$|R
50|$|As {{their name}} suggests, <b>the</b> Mesopotamian <b>Marshes</b> {{are located in}} the larger region which used to be called Mesopotamia.

Originally covering an area of 20000 km2 and divided into three major areas, <b>the</b> Central <b>Marshes</b> lie between <b>the</b> Tigris and Euphrates, while <b>the</b> Hammar <b>Marshes</b> lie south of the Euphrates and <b>the</b> Hawizeh <b>Marshes</b> are bound east of the Tigris. Before the 2003 Invasion of Iraq, about 90% of <b>the</b> <b>marshes</b> had been drained.|$|R
5|$|In Tamaulipas and {{southern}} Texas, the ranges of <b>the</b> <b>marsh</b> rice rat {{and the related}} Oryzomys couesi meet; in parts of Kenedy, Willacy and Cameron counties, Texas, and in far northeastern Tamaulipas, the two are sympatric (occur in the same places). In experimental conditions, they fail to interbreed and genetic analysis yields no evidence of gene flow or hybridization in the wild. Compared to O.couesi, <b>the</b> <b>marsh</b> rice rat shows less genetic variability within but more between populations in the contact zone, probably because the species is restricted to isolated populations near the coast.|$|E
5|$|John Bachman {{discovered}} <b>the</b> <b>marsh</b> {{rice rat}} in 1816, {{and it was}} formally described in 1837. Several subspecies have been described since the 1890s, mainly from Florida, but disagreement exists over their validity. The Florida Keys population is sometimes classified as a different species, the silver rice rat (Oryzomys argentatus). Data from the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene indicate a deep divergence between populations east of Mississippi and those further west, {{which suggests that the}} western populations may be recognized as a separate species, Oryzomys texensis. The species is part of the genus Oryzomys, which also includes several others occurring further south in Mexico, Central America, and northwestern South America, some of which have previously been regarded as subspecies of <b>the</b> <b>marsh</b> rice rat. One, Oryzomys couesi, occurs with <b>the</b> <b>marsh</b> rice rat in Tamaulipas and southern Texas.|$|E
5|$|Northumberland {{failed to}} engage, {{possibly}} {{due to the}} presence of the Stanleys, whose intentions were unclear, or due to the position of <b>the</b> <b>marsh</b> (or for both reasons).

The Cytb data placed all studied specimens of O.couesi in a clade sister to <b>the</b> <b>marsh</b> rice rat; the mean genetic distance {{between the two groups}} was 11.30%, much larger than the distance between sister species in the related genera Melanomys and Nectomys (7.48% and 7.52%, respectively). Within the O.couesi clade, two populations from Panama and Costa Rica were successively basal to the other specimens, which fell into two large subclades—one containing animals from the Pacific seaboard from western Mexico to El Salvador and the other containing rats from the eastern seaboard from Texas to Nicaragua. The Panamanian and Costa Rican populations differed by 6.53% to 11.93% from the others and the western and eastern subclades differed by 4.41% on average. Data from both of the slower-evolving nuclear markers Rbp3 and Adh1-I2 also placed examples of Oryzomys in two main clades, but did not recover the western and eastern groups of O.couesi as separate clades. In addition, Adh1-I2 placed the Costa Rican population within <b>the</b> <b>marsh</b> rice rat clade and placed some western O.couesi specimens closer to <b>the</b> <b>marsh</b> rice rat than to the O.couesi group. The combined dataset supported the western and eastern clades within O.couesi and placed the Costa Rican population marginally closer to <b>the</b> <b>marsh</b> rice rat than to O.couesi. Using the genetic species concept, the authors suggested that the four groups they found within O.couesi should be recognized as distinct species. If this suggestion is followed, the eastern subclade would retain the name Oryzomys couesi, the western group would be named Oryzomys mexicanus, and the appropriate names for the Panamanian and Costa Rican species remain unclear.|$|E
