50|$|The form {{of mercury}} {{released}} by human activity is called methyl mercury, and it bioaccumulates and biomagnifies in organisms, particularly marine fish. When mercury is {{released into the}} atmosphere, it goes into plankton and other small fish as methyl mercury. The bioaccumulation and biomagnification occurs as larger fish consume the smaller fish and magnify the mercury concentration as it goes up the food chain. Currently, humans around the world collectively emit 2000 metric tons per year. With strict regulations, the number could be decreased to 800 metric tons, however, if humans continue without stricter regulations, <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>will</b> <b>increase</b> to 3400 metric tons. Furthermore, some areas {{in the world are}} more sensitive to mercury than others, meaning that fish in these areas become highly contaminated at relatively small levels of mercury. One factor that increases the effects of mercury contamination is the presence of coniferous forests. Additionally, the fact that mercury can travel far distances from its location of release provides further justification for regulation. For instance, mercury contamination occurs in the Arctic and Antarctic, where it has not been released.|$|E

40|$|Excerpt] Widespread {{economic}} growth and increased productivity in Africa has been insufficient to reduce the growing numbers of unemployed and working poor in Africa. This is the main finding of the first African Employment Trends Report written for the ILO’s 11 th African Regional Meeting to be held on 24 - 27 April in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The unemployment rate in Africa stood at 10. 3 per cent in 2006 and the share of people who, {{despite the fact that}} they work, still live with their families below the US$ 1 a day poverty line is nowhere in the world higher than in Africa. And perspectives are not bright either: It is estimated in the report that, between 2006 and 2015, the percentage of persons working but still living on less than US$ 2 per person in the household, per day will decrease from 78. 6 per cent to 76. 4 per cent, but <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>will</b> <b>increase</b> from 260. 3 million to 316. 7 million.

Why is this the case? The Report tries to find answers to this question by analysing the latest labour market data available for Africa. But it also takes other social and economic challenges such as HIV/AIDS, migration and child labour into account to explain the reasons for Africa’s struggle against poverty. Such an analysis can help to design effective poverty reduction policies which could help the poor take advantage of the employment opportunities generated by growth...|$|E

Objectives: Assess perception of care and challenges faced in availing eye care services among persons with diabetics and generate evidence on available human resources, infrastructure, and service utilization for DR in India. Methods: The cross-sectional, hospital-based survey was conducted in eleven cities across 9 States in India. In each city, public and private providers of eye-care were identified. Both multispecialty and standalone facilities were included. Specially designed semi-open ended questionnaires were administered to the clients. Semi-structured interviews were administered to the service providers (both diabetic care physicians and eye care teams) and observational checklists were used to record findings of the assessment of facilities conducted by a dedicated team of research staff. Results: A total of 859 units were included in this study.

If climate change was an issue in the early 17 th century, Don Quijote might have specialized in fighting nuclear or fossil fuel power plants. The change in power production is clearly pronounced, and it inspires the market to respond immediately. Numerous wind turbine manufacturers emerge, developing one technological innovation after another. The trend clearly goes in one direction: horizontal axis wind turbines in all possible variations. However, there are a few companies that do not follow the mainstream – they swim against the current and introduce new concepts, with the potential to set new standards in the industry. Nevertheless, the question whether these companies can establish operations and survive in an industry dominated by large multinational corporations arises. If these companies want to become recognized, they need to compete on an international scale from the outset – they become born globals. This master’s thesis investigates the preconditions under which an innovative start-up company can become born global in the wind turbine industry. For that, distinctive resources and capabilities of such companies, as well as key success factors for the industry are defined. Furthermore, enhancing or restricting parameters lying within company’s environment – in particular, within its networks – are discovered. These findings are based on and supported by the case study of an innovative vertical axis wind turbine manufacturer.
