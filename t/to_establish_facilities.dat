2500|$|The Admiralty sent Vice Admiral Charles Daniel to the United States for {{consultation}} {{about the}} supply and {{administration of the}} fleet. He then proceeded to Australia where he became Vice Admiral, Administration, British Pacific Fleet, a role that [...] "if unspectacular compared with command of a fighting squadron, was {{certainly one of the}} most arduous to be allocated to a British Flag officer during the entire war." [...] The US Pacific Fleet had assembled an enormous fleet of oilers and supply ships of every type. Even before the war, it had been active in the development of underway replenishment techniques. The Admiralty realised that it needed a great deal of new equipment and training, in a short time and with whatever it had to hand. Lacking specialist ships, it had to improvise a fleet train from whatever RN, RFA or merchant ships were available. On 8 February 1944, the First Sea Lord, Admiral of the Fleet Sir Andrew Cunningham, informed the Defence Committee that 91 ships would be required to support the BPF. This was based on an assumption that the BPF would be active off the Philippines or would have a base there. By March, the war zone had moved north and the Americans were unwilling to allow the British <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> <b>facilities</b> in the Philippines. The estimate had grown to 158 ships, as it was recognised that operations eventually would be fought close to Japan. This had to be balanced against the shipping needed to import food for the civilian population of the UK. In January 1945, the War cabinet was forced to postpone the deployment of the fleet by two months due to the shortage of shipping.|$|E

From 1967, he served as a military surgeon and head of the Biafran teaching hospital in various locations including Enugu and Emekukwu during the war. He was also the secretary to the Biafran Relief and Rehabilitation Association during the war. Later Udekwu was distinguished professor and head of department of surgery of the University of Nigeria, Nsukka Teaching Hospital (UNTH) and was the administrative head of the Enugu campus of the university. Udekwu is credited with building up the department of surgery of the University of Nigeria. After several unsuccessful attempts at sourcing funding to [...] establish a modern surgical department from many organisations in the United States, United Kingdom, Scandinavia and through church aid, he was able to scrape together funding from the Enugu campus aided by the contributions of individual Nigerians to build the operating theater and buy the equipment needed <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> <b>facilities</b> for open heart surgery in Nigeria. He was one of the pioneers that established cardiac surgery in Nigeria. Professor Udekwu led the team of surgeons that performed the first successful open heart surgery in Nigeria in 1974 which was the first of its kind in black Africa. Also in the team of surgeons that performed this landmark operation were Professor Sir Magdi Yacoub, Professors Anyanwu C.H., Nwafor D.C., the anaesthetist Dr. Shreeniwas Jawalekar and others. This was followed by a series of six further open heart surgeries under Udekwu at the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital Enugu (UNTH) between 1974 and 1980.|$|E
