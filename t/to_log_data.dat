Verification is performed by applying a simple formula <b>to</b> sensor <b>log</b> <b>data,</b> for each activity of interest. The result value determines whether an activity has been performed. We have conducted an experimental study to validate our approach. To do so, four participants have been monitored during five days at their home, equipped with sensors.

40|$|Abstract. The {{conventional}} {{prediction model}} of rock drillability {{is based on}} regression analysis using well <b>logging</b> <b>data.</b> Regression analysis directly uses initial data to establish model, so its precision is not satisfied. By accumulating initial data, gray theory model (GM (0,N)) is able to weaken the random of initial data. Therefore, a practical approach to calculate the rock drillability, which base on GM(0,N) using well <b>logging</b> <b>data,</b> is presented in this paper. Based on the inherent relation of well logging information and rock drillability, a lot of logging parameters are selected closely to rock drillability, and the prediction model of rock drillability are established by GM(0,N). This method is applied <b>to</b> <b>logging</b> <b>data</b> process of Du 4 well in SC oil field, {{the results show that}} it can improve predicting accuracy of rock drillability, and can easily frame rock drillability profile in some areas. ...|$|R
