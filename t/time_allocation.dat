30|$|Algorithm 1 {{outlines}} our proposed dynamic <b>time</b> slot <b>allocation</b> algorithm, (dynamic-FAA). Table 1 displays all {{the variables}} {{used in the}} algorithm. The algorithm starts with some arbitrary (e.g., equal) <b>time</b> slot <b>allocation</b> ϕ^l(δ_(t)) and iteratively improves total system utility function in a while loop. The while loop iterates over consecutive frames, and for each frame t corresponding to a DoF vector δ_(t), the reduced convex problem presented in (19)–(23) is solved (lines 7.1 through 7.6). The solution provides current <b>time</b> slot <b>allocations,</b> ϕ^l(δ_(t)), for that particular frame, which also updates the average <b>time</b> slot <b>allocation</b> ϕ^l(δ_(t)) through an exponential moving average (line 7.4).

Therefore, in this paper, following Lazear’s (2005) jack-of-all-trades approach, we study how his or her composition of skills affects a scientist’s intention of becoming an entrepreneur. Extending Lazear, we examine how the effect of balanced entrepreneurial skills is moderated by a balanced working <b>time</b> <b>allocations</b> and peer effects. Using unique data collected from 480 life sciences researchers, we provide the first evidence that scientists with more balanced skills are more likely to have higher entrepreneurial intentions, particularly when they are in contact with entrepreneurial peers. Furthermore, we find even higher entrepreneurial intentions when balanced skill sets are combined with balanced working <b>time</b> <b>allocations.</b> Thus, to encourage the entrepreneurial intentions of life scientists, one has to ensure that they are exposed to diverse work experiences, have balanced working <b>time</b> <b>allocations</b> across different activities and work with entrepreneurial peers; i. e., collaborating with colleagues or academic scientists who have started new ventures in the past is important...|$|R
