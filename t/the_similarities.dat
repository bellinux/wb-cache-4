5|$|As {{each region}} {{has its own}} {{traditional}} pattern, batiks are commonly distinguished by the region they originated in, such as batik Solo, batik Pekalongan, and batik Madura.

5|$|Hydrogen, {{like the}} alkali metals, has one valence {{electron}} and reacts easily with the halogens, but <b>the</b> <b>similarities</b> end {{there because of}} the small size of a bare proton H+ compared to the alkali metal cations. Its placement above lithium is primarily due to its electron configuration. It is sometimes placed above carbon due to their similar electronegativities or fluorine due to their similar chemical properties.|$|E

30|$|In {{line with}} our {{previous}} works ([13, 14]), this paper introduces {{a model for}} measuring <b>the</b> <b>similarity</b> between users based on their behavior on social network.
