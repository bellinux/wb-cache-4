5|$|In a {{study done}} by Statistics Canada's General Social Survey of 10,000 households, the average man spent under {{two hours a day}} dealing with {{childcare}} and house work while women on average spent a little more than three. This study highlights the unequal distribution of labor between partners. Of the people surveyed, under fifteen percent of <b>the</b> <b>couples</b> agreed on doing around the same amount of work in the house. About 83 percent of women participated in housecleaning and food preparation compared to only 51 percent of men who were surveyed.|$|E
5|$|Screen {{time was}} divided up equally between <b>the</b> <b>couples</b> {{over the course}} of an episode, though {{occasionally}} some scenes would run longer; in Series 4, Episode 3, the scenes of Karen clubbing went on for ten uninterrupted minutes. These scenes were also a rarity for location filming; usually filming in public places was done on a Sunday during closing hours but the clubbing scenes in this episode were filmed during opening hours at the Music Box in Manchester. A hand-held camera was used to enhance the frenetic pace.|$|E

5|$|Ebla was a polytheistic state. During {{the first}} kingdom, Eblaites worshiped their dead kings. The pantheon {{of the first}} Ebla {{included}} pairs of deities {{and they can be}} separated into three genres; in the first and most common one, there were <b>the</b> <b>couples,</b> such as the deity and his female consort. The second type of pairs was the divine twosomes, such as the deities that cooperate to create the cosmos, like in the Egyptian and Mesopotamian pantheons. The third type included divine pairs who were actually a single deity that had two names. Eblaites worshiped few Mesopotamian deities, preferring North-Western Semitic gods, some of which were unique to Ebla. The first genre of pairs included Nidakul, who was exclusive to Ebla, and his consort, Belatu ("his wife"); Rasap and his consort Adamma; the patron gods of the city Kura, who was unique to Ebla, and his consort Barama. The third genre included the artisan god Kamish/Tit, Kothar-wa-Khasis and the planet Venus represented by twin mountain Gods; Shahar as the morning star and Shalim as the evening star.|$|E

25|$|Two legal {{challenges}} to Northern Ireland's same-sex marriage ban were {{heard in the}} High Court in November and December 2015. Two couples, Grainne Close and Shannon Sickles and Chris and Henry Flanagan-Kanem brought the case claiming that Northern Ireland's prohibition on same-sex marriage breached their human rights. The case was heard simultaneously with a case brought in January 2015 in which two men who wed in England sought to have their marriage recognised in Northern Ireland. A ruling was handed down in August 2017; Judge O'Hara found against <b>the</b> <b>couples</b> and determined {{that there were no}} grounds under case law from the European Court of Human Rights that the couple’s rights were violated by Northern Ireland's refusal to recognise their union as a marriage. <b>The</b> <b>couples</b> have vowed to appeal.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>coupling</b> between {{negative}} and positive index medium waveguides is investigated theoretically in this paper. A coupled mode theory is developed for such a waveguide system and its validity is verified. Interesting phenomena in <b>the</b> <b>coupled</b> waveguides are demonstrated, which occur in the case when the negative index medium waveguide in isolation guides its mode backward. A new type of coupled mode solution that varies exponentially with <b>the</b> <b>coupling</b> length {{is found in the}} special case when the propagation constants of two individual waveguides are nearly the same. A coupler operating in this case is insensitive to <b>the</b> <b>coupling</b> length, and its coupling efficiency can reach 100 % as long as <b>the</b> <b>coupling</b> length is long enough. However, when the propagation constants of the two individual waveguides differ greatly, <b>the</b> <b>coupled</b> mode solution is still a periodic function of <b>the</b> <b>coupling</b> length, but <b>the</b> <b>coupled</b> power is output backward. In addition, the modes in the composite waveguide system are also studied using <b>the</b> <b>coupled</b> mode theory, and their fundamental properties are revealed. Comment: 7 page...|$|R

25|$|After {{being denied}} a {{marriage}} license, a lesbian couple {{filed a lawsuit}} on October 30, 2013 in the Seventeenth Judicial District. The case, Brinkman v. Long, seeks to overturn the state's constitutional ban on same-sex marriage. The couple was joined on February 18, 2014, by nine other same-sex couples who filed a lawsuit, McDaniel-Miccio v. Hickenlooper, also in state district court, seeking the same outcome. Four of <b>the</b> <b>couples</b> are raising children, and five of <b>the</b> <b>couples</b> have married in other states. The suit named Governor John Hickenlooper and Denver City Clerk Debra Johnson as defendants. Hickenlooper responded by noting Colorado's support for civil unions. Johnson said she supported marriage rights for same-sex couples but was obligated to follow the law by denying them marriage licenses. Colorado Attorney General John Suthers, a Republican, announced he would defend the state's ban.|$|E

25|$|Initially, the waltz was {{significantly}} different from its form today. In the first place, <b>the</b> <b>couples</b> did not dance in the closed position as today. The illustrations and descriptions {{make it clear that}} <b>the</b> <b>couples</b> danced with arm positions {{similar to that of the}} precursor dances, the Ländler and the Allemande. The hold was at times semi-closed, and at times side by side. Arms are intertwined and circling movements were made under raised arms. No couple in Wilson's plate are shown in close embrace, but some are in closed hold facing each other. There was another significant difference from our present technique. The feet were turned out and the rise of foot during the dance was much more pronounced than it is today. This can be seen quite clearly in the figure, and such a style imposes its limitations on how the dance can be performed.|$|E
25|$|In May 2009, the Alameda County Clerk-Registrar, Patrick O'Connell, denied Kristin Perry and Sandra Stier a {{marriage}} license {{because they are}} a same-sex couple.
