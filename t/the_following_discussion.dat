25|$|<b>The</b> <b>following</b> <b>discussion</b> {{is mostly}} {{presented}} {{in terms of}} linear functions {{but the use of}} least squares is valid and practical for more general families of functions. Also, by iteratively applying local quadratic approximation to the likelihood (through the Fisher information), the least-squares method may be used to fit a generalized linear model.|$|E
25|$|There {{are four}} basic punches in boxing: the jab, cross, hook and uppercut. Any punch {{other than a}} jab is {{considered}} a power punch. If a boxer is right-handed (orthodox), his left hand is the lead hand and his right hand is the rear hand. For a left-handed boxer or southpaw, the hand positions are reversed. For clarity, <b>the</b> <b>following</b> <b>discussion</b> will assume a right-handed boxer.|$|E

25|$|The {{development}} of theatre in England in the 16th and 17th centuries {{was not an}} isolated phenomenon; similar developments occurred simultaneously in other European countries, to greater or lesser degrees. The same broad factors influenced English actors as those that affected actors in neighboring countries, especially Scotland, France, Denmark, and states in northern Germany like Saxony and the Rhineland Palatinate. Yet conditions in other societies also differed significantly from those in England; <b>the</b> <b>following</b> <b>discussion</b> applies specifically to England in the 16th century and 17th century.|$|E
