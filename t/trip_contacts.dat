It would then rise again, but too late: with the train moving quickly, the trip valve, just a few feet behind the wheel, would already have gone past, thus making the train stop useless for ensuring signal compliance.|$|R

The outreach endeavour ‘Vision Vietnam’ is an initiative by the students and strongly supported by the Western Australian Catholic Doctors’ Association. Medical student, Marc Dantoc said HIV/AIDS patients in Vietnam receive minimal health care {{from the government and}} are often marginalised by society. “The free clinics offer what little medical care they can give to the patients,” said Marc. The students are hoping {{to raise money for the}} free clinics in Ho Chin Min City. They will also provide practical assistance to the clinics by teaching language skills and health education and delivering urgently needed medical supplies and equipment. Another objective of the trip is to establish an ongoing relationship between Notre Dame medical students and the free clinics in Vietnam. The vision is to be able to send students on an annual basis to support the work being done by doctors and health professionals at the clinics. One of the recent fund raising projects for the group was to set up a stall at Our Lady of the Mission Parish in Whitford as part of their International Food Festival and Fete. “We set up a hair colouring and fake tattoo stall which turned out to be a big hit with the kids. The fete was a hugely successful event and as a result of our stall, between 50 and 60 kids ran loose with coloured hair and fake tattoos,” said Marc. All proceeds raised at the stall will be used to purchase the much needed medical supplies for the free HIV/AIDS clinics. The students are looking for donations.

40|$|Using {{a private}} {{car is a}} {{transportation}} system very common in industrialized countries. However, it causes different problems such as overuse of oil, traffic jams causing earth pollution, health problems and an inefficient use of personal time. One possible solution to these problems is carpooling, i. e. sharing a trip on a private car of a driver {{with one or more}} passengers. Carpooling would reduce the number of cars on streets hence providing worldwide environmental, economical and social benefits. The matching of drivers and passengers can be facilitated by information and communication technologies. Typically, a driver inserts on a web-site the availability of empty seats on his/her car for a planned trip and potential passengers can search for <b>trips</b> and <b>contact</b> the drivers. This process is slow and can be appropriate for long trips planned days in advance. We call this static carpooling and we note it is not used frequently by people even if there are already many web-sites offering this service and in fact the only real open challenge is widespread adoption. Dynamic carpooling, on the other hand, takes advantage of the recent and increasing adoption of Internet-connected geo-aware mobile devices for enabling impromptu trip opportunities. Passengers request trips directly on the street and can find a suitable ride in just few minutes. Currently there are no dynamic carpooling systems widely used. Every attempt to create and organize such systems failed. This paper reviews {{the state of the art}} of dynamic carpooling. It identifies the most important issues against the adoption of dynamic carpooling systems and the proposed solutions for such issues. It proposes a first input on solving the problem of mass-adopting dynamic carpooling systems. Comment: 10 pages, whitepaper, extracted from B.

40|$|Human {{development}} {{is a result of}} social relations that are mediated, experimented and internalized by the individual. Thus, the way the subject is included in their social group has definite impacts on their constitution. Due to changes in social interaction, language and the presence of stereotyped behaviors, autistic subjects can have their participation in social and cultural life restricted, making their difficulties more pronounced. The objective {{of this study was to}} analyze the dialogic processes of five autistic adolescents focusing on: evidence taken from experiences lived by them in their daily lives and from social enunciations impregnated in their oral discourses, attempting to find subsides for the therapeutic process of such subjects. The empirical material was collected from two individual speech-language therapy sessions, which were recorded and transcribed, with three autistic adolescents. The sessions were addressed by looking at subjects' life stories and personal photographs were used as therapeutic resources. The analyses were qualitative and supported by microgenetic analysis. Results show that the subjects' experiences are provided by their school and family, and are related to leisure, <b>trips,</b> birthday parties, <b>contact</b> with more distant relatives, church. We also observed that parents and professionals extend the autistic person's childhood, representing them as children even during adolescence. Autistic subjects were observed to have relationships restricted to their families, with little opportunity for close contact with other people.

40|$|Environmental {{regulations}} {{can only}} be effective if they are adhered to, but the motivations for regulatory compliance are not always clear. We assessed vessel operator compliance with a December 2008 regulation aimed at reducing collisions with the endangered North Atlantic right whale that requires vessels 65 feet or greater in length to travel at speeds of 10 knots or less at prescribed times and locations along the U. S. eastern seaboard. Extensive outreach efforts were undertaken to notify affected entities {{both before and after}} the regulation went into effect. Vessel speeds of 201, 862 trips made between November 2008 and August 2013 by 8, 009 individual vessels were quantified remotely, constituting a nearly complete census of transits made by the regulated population. Of these, 437 vessels (or their parent companies), some of whom had been observed exceeding the speed limit, were contacted through one of four non-punitive information programs. A fraction (n = 26 vessels/companies) received citations and fines. Despite the efforts to inform mariners, initial compliance was low (< 5 % of the trips were completely < 10 knots) but improved in the latter part of the study. Each notification/enforcement program improved compliance to some degree and some may have influenced compliance across the entire regulated community. Citations/fines appeared to have the greatest influence on improving compliance in notified vessels/companies, followed in order of effectiveness by enforcement-office information letters, monthly summaries of vessel operations, and direct at-sea radio <b>contact.</b> <b>Trips</b> by cargo vessels exhibited the greatest change in behavior followed by tanker and passenger vessels.

50|$|The Venus flytrap {{is a small}} plant whose {{structure}} can {{be described}} as a rosette of four to seven leaves, which arise from a short subterranean stem that is actually a bulb-like object. Each stem reaches a maximum size of about three to ten centimeters, depending on the time of year; longer leaves with robust traps are usually formed after flowering. Flytraps that have more than seven leaves are colonies formed by rosettes that have divided beneath the ground.The leaf blade is divided into two regions: a flat, heart-shaped photosynthesis-capable petiole, and a pair of terminal lobes hinged at the midrib, forming the trap which is the true leaf. The upper surface of these lobes contains red anthocyanin pigments and its edges secrete mucilage. The lobes exhibit rapid plant movements, snapping shut when stimulated by prey. The trapping mechanism is <b>tripped</b> when prey <b>contacts</b> one of the three hair-like trichomes that are found on the upper surface of each of the lobes. The mechanism is so highly specialized that it can distinguish between living prey and non-prey stimuli, such as falling raindrops; two trigger hairs must be touched in succession within 20 seconds of each other or one hair touched twice in rapid succession, whereupon the lobes of the trap will snap shut, typically in about one-tenth of a second. The edges of the lobes are fringed by stiff hair-like protrusions or cilia, which mesh together and prevent large prey from escaping. These protrusions, and the trigger hairs (also known as sensitive hairs) are likely homologous with the tentacles found in this plant’s close relatives, the sundews. Scientists have concluded that the snap trap evolved from a fly-paper trap similar to that of Drosera.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to evaluate biomechanical differences in alternate stair descent strategies to determine the mechanisms by which these strategies modulate task mechanics Seventeen healthy subjects (9 males, 8 females) performed ten trials in four experimental conditions; forwards (FD), backwards (BD), step-by-step lead (SBSL) and trail (SBST) limbs. Results showed that peak ankle plantiflexor powers and work in BD and SBSL were similar in magnitude (p> 0. 05) and reduced relative to FD at initial contact (p 0. 05). Lastly, peak moments, powers and work at push-off were greater in FD compared to all other conditions (p 0. 05). Peak knee moments, powers and work were reduced during the eccentric midstance burst. Knee moments, powers and work were similar in FD and SBST (p> 0. 05), but were greater than BD and SBSL (p< 0. 001). Peak moments, powers and work were greater in BD compared to the SBSL limb (p< 0. 001). Thus, the step-by-step descent strategy is more appropriate for individuals with unilateral knee problems, whereas backwards descent is more suitable for bilateral quadriceps weakness. Peak hip powers and work were larger in BD relative to FD (p < 0. 001) during initial contact. Similarly, the extensor moment in BD was significantly larger than the flexor moment demonstrated in FD. No consistent stair or condition effects were observed for the concentric hip flexor burst at push-off in FD, SBSL and SBST conditions. Finally, this study considered foot clearance in stair descent. Clearance was greater in BD relative to FD, SBSL and SBST in the mid staircase region, but was similar at step 1, which represented the transition from standing to stair descent. No foot <b>contacts,</b> <b>trips</b> or stumbles were recorded, demonstrating the likelihood of contacting a stair edge in all patterns was nonexistent for these healthy participants. The present results have implications to improve functionality in stair descent for individuals that find the task difficult or painful. Future studies will likely consider the strategies employed during the initiation of stair descent by elderly and clinical populations to gain insight on the strategies used to minimize mechanical burden on both the joints and overlying musculature. Lastly, research should consider the effects of handrail use on alternate stair descent strategy mechanics, such as backwards and step-by-step descent...|$|R
40|$|Medieval madwoman Noh plays {{have been}} {{performed}} in Japan continually for the last 600 years. In these plays, the association of the feminine with madness {{makes it possible to}} demonstrate to audiences a symbolic transformation of medieval cultural and religious practices. My study explores feminine subjectivities and sexuality conveyed through madness and examines the significance of feminine madness as a form of resistance from the margins of society. The purpose of this trip is to explore how contemporary Noh performers negotiate medieval Noh texts on the theme of feminine madness. I am particularly interested in what these performers bring to their interpretation of texts of medieval provenance and how they situate these texts in the larger scope of their performances. Of special emphasis in my study is the question of how female Noh performers negotiate female roles in Noh, roles open to women only since the 20 th century as these parts were traditionally the exclusive privilege of male performers. To investigate the contemporary context of Japanese performance traditions, I plan to conduct fieldwork in Japan by observing madwoman plays and by participating in workshops on traditional Japanese theatre led by professional actors. Plays that I could otherwise study only as written texts are performed frequently in Kyoto. By observing performances, I will be able to grasp the significance of the performed word of Noh, as well as its music and dance. Participation in the summer’s intensive workshop consisting of lectures, demonstrations, and practicums for Noh (stylized, poetic drama featuring chant and abstract dance) will also help me gain insight into a performer’s thoughts about playing different roles. With its concentration of resources as the traditional cultural center of Japan, Kyoto has thus become a center for my research. In preparation for this research <b>trip,</b> I have <b>contacted</b> Dr. Jonah Salz at Ryukoku University in Kyoto, an expert on Japanese traditional theater. He will provide me with access to the library at Ryukoku University, which has a large collection of invaluable manuscripts and other materials. At this library I plan to research medieval Buddhism, which had profound influence on Noh plays. Their collection of Buddhist texts, particularly, ranks among the best in Japan. Having access to this collection is critical because similar material is difficult to obtain in the United States. I have also arranged to meet Dr. Yuriko Kite, Vice President of International Affairs at Kansai University, and Prof. Toshihiko Sekiya, who teaches Japanese theatre there. Because BSC has an exchange program with Kansai University, I believe that by working in collaboration with their faculty, I can make a significant contribution to strengthening our Japan-U. S. partnership as well as making rich resources in Japan accessible to BSC students in my courses on Japanese Studies...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} novelty seeking {{has been used}} by over decades to study {{consumer}} behaviour in tourism. Cohen (1972) differentiated international tourists based on {{the degree to which they}} seek novelty in their travel experience, through four categories: Drifter, Explorer, Individual Mass Tourist and the Organized Mass Tourist. However this was a conceptual classification for which further methodological refinement in quantitative terms was recommended by Cohen in 1974. The 20 -item International Tourist Role (ITR) Scale designed by Mo, Howard and Havitz (1993) is an extension of this concept, based on three different dimensions: Social Contact Dimension, Travel Arrangement Dimension and Destination Oriented Dimension. Jiang et al. (2000) validated 16 of the 20 items as reliable for investigating travel preferences of American tourists. Originally, written in English, the need for cross-cultural validation of this scale in a foreign language, led Spiers (2005) to translate these 20 items in French language and successfully segment French and French Canadian international tourists into five distinct clusters. Thus, the realization that cultures can vary significantly in terms of tourist motivations in these three separate investigations and the need to further validate the scale in other languages/cultures formed the research gap for this current study. As worldwide tourism arrivals are expected to reach 1. 8 billion by 2030, emerging market destinations are expected to generate and accommodate much of this growth. According to Tourism Industry Association of Canada, China (29. 4 %) and India (18. 8 %) ranked number 1 and 2 as the top 2014 performance markets leading to a + 11 % growth in Canada’s GDP in 2014. Given their historical and demographic similarities, and the fact that both these countries are now dominating the Canadian outbound tourism market, inspired this current research into studying the travel preferences of Chinese and Indian international tourists in Canada by translating the 20 -item ITR scale into Mandarin and Hindi language. Data were collected from 220 Mandarin and Hindi- speaking overseas tourists over a series of weekends in the month of December 2014 at the CN Tower, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. A purposive sampling technique along with distribution of a self-administered questionnaire was utilized by Hindi-speaking bilingual researcher and a Mandarin- speaking bilingual research assistant. The questionnaire including the 20 -item ITR scale was translated into Mandarin and Hindi with the help of bilingual translators using the back translation method. Quantitative analysis of the data was conducted using statistical procedures SPSS 22. 0. Results suggested the reliability of the scale’s three dimensions and 18 items for studying Mandarin and Hindi- speaking overseas travelers. The ITR scale proved useful in segmenting Chinese and Indian overseas travelers into five distinct clusters: High Familiarity Seekers, Destination Novelty Seekers, Guided- <b>Trip</b> Seekers, Social <b>Contact</b> Seekers and High Novelty Seekers. Four of these five clusters were consistent with one or more previous analyses conducted using the ITR scale. Implications of the study for tourism sectors such as DMOs, hotel industry, travel agencies etc. are presented along with limitations of the present study and recommendations for future research. Overall, this research represented an extension towards growth of emerging tourist markets research and served as a much needed validation of the ITR scale in a cross cultural setting...|$|R
