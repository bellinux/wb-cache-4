5|$|The bark {{of other}} {{varieties}} of oak {{has traditionally been}} used in Europe for the tanning of hides though bark from other species of tree has been used elsewhere. The active ingredient, <b>tannin,</b> is extracted and after various preliminary treatments, the skins are immersed {{in a series of}} vats containing solutions in increasing concentrations. The <b>tannin</b> causes the hide to become supple, less affected by water and more resistant to bacterial attack.|$|E
5|$|Hemlock logs {{were used}} to build the plank road. At that time, the tree's bark was {{a major source of}} <b>tannin</b> used to tan leather. The wood was not used much for lumber, so {{hundreds}} of thousands of stripped hemlock logs were normally left to rot. There were sawmills and experienced lumber workers available from the local timber industry.|$|E
5|$|In wine making, the {{delicate}} {{nature of the}} Riesling grape requires special handling during harvesting to avoid crushing or bruising the skin. Without this care, the broken skins could leak <b>tannin</b> into the juice, giving a markedly coarse taste and throwing off balance the Riesling's range of flavors and aromas.|$|E
50|$|Condensed <b>tannins</b> (proanthocyanidins, polyflavonoid <b>tannins,</b> catechol-type <b>tannins,</b> pyrocatecollic type <b>tannins,</b> non-hydrolyzable <b>tannins</b> or flavolans) are {{polymers}} {{formed by}} the condensation of flavans. They do not contain sugar residues.|$|R
50|$|The <b>tannins</b> {{that are}} {{extracted}} from grapes found in red wine are primarily condensed <b>tannins</b> which are polymers of procyanidin monomers. Hydrolysable <b>tannins</b> are {{extracted from the}} oak wood the wine is aged in. Hydrolysable <b>tannins</b> are more easily oxidised than condensed <b>tannins.</b>|$|R
50|$|While many hydrolyzable <b>tannins</b> {{and most}} {{condensed}} <b>tannins</b> are water-soluble, several <b>tannins</b> are also highly octanol-soluble. Some large condensed <b>tannins</b> are insoluble. Differences in solubilities {{are likely to}} affect their biological functions.|$|R
5|$|Lumber thus {{became one}} of the leading {{industries}} in Pennsylvania. Trees were used to furnish fuel to heat homes, <b>tannin</b> for the many tanneries that were spread throughout the state, and wood for construction, furniture, and barrel making. Large areas of forest were harvested by colliers to fire iron furnaces. Rifle stocks and shingles were made from Pennsylvania timber, as were a wide variety of household utensils, and the first Conestoga wagons.|$|E

5|$|Cabernet Sauvignon {{is a very}} {{bold and}} {{assertive}} wine that has potential to overwhelm light and delicate dishes. The wine's high <b>tannin</b> content {{as well as the}} oak influences and high alcohol levels associated with many regional styles play important roles in influencing how well the wine matches with different foods. When Cabernet Sauvignon is young, all those elements are at their peak, but as the wine ages it mellows; possibilities for different food pairings open up. In most circumstances, matching the weight (alcohol level and body) of the wine to the heaviness of the food is an important consideration. Cabernet Sauvignons with high alcohol levels do not pair well with spicy foods due to hotness levels of the capsaicins present in spices like chili peppers being enhanced by the alcohol with the heat accentuating the bitterness of the tannins. Milder spices, such as black pepper, pair better due to their ability to minimize the perception of tannins—such as in the classic pairings of Cabernet Sauvignon with steak au poivre and pepper-crusted ahi tuna.|$|E
25|$|Reactions of <b>tannins</b> {{with the}} {{phenolic}} compound anthocyanidins creates another class of <b>tannins</b> known as pigmented <b>tannins</b> which influences {{the color of}} red wine.|$|R
40|$|<b>Tannins</b> are {{phenolic}} metabolites, which naturally {{produced by}} plants. They can defend plants against pathogen microorganisms and viruses. According to animal nutrition, <b>tannins</b> have both adverse and beneficial effects depending on animal species, physiological {{state of the}} animal, structure and concentration of the <b>tannins.</b> The objective {{of this study was}} to review the literature about <b>tannins,</b> their effects and usage of <b>tannins</b> in animal nutrition...|$|R
50|$|<b>Tannins</b> are {{phenolic}} compounds that are {{commonly found in}} plants. Found in the leaf, bud, seed, root, and stem tissues, <b>tannins</b> are widely distributed in many different species of plants. <b>Tannins</b> are separated into two classes: hydrolysable <b>tannins</b> and condensed <b>tannins.</b> Depending on their concentration and nature, either class can have adverse or beneficial effects. <b>Tannins</b> can be beneficial, having been shown to increase milk production, wool growth, ovulation rate, and lambing percentage, as well as reducing bloat risk and reducing internal parasite burdens.|$|R
5|$|Outside Australia it {{has become}} naturalised in South Africa, Tanzania, Italy, Portugal, Sardinia, India, Indonesia and New Zealand. It is present in California as a garden escapee, but is not {{considered}} to be naturalised there. In South Africa, where it had been introduced between 1858 and 1865 for dune stabilization and <b>tannin</b> production, it had spread along waterways into forest, mountain and lowland fynbos, and borderline areas between fynbos and karoo. The gall-forming wasp Trichilogaster signiventris has been introduced in South Africa for biological control and has reduced the capacity of trees to reproduce throughout their range. The eggs are laid by adult wasps into buds of flower heads in the summer, before hatching in May and June when the larvae induce the formation of the grape-like galls and prevent flower development. The galls can be so heavy that branches break under their weight. In addition, the introduction in 2001 of the acacia seed weevil Melanterius compactus has also proved effective.|$|E
5|$|The soft organic {{material}} aboard and dispersed onto the seabed around the hull {{would have been}} the first to disappear, rapidly devoured by fish and crustaceans. Wood-boring molluscs such as Teredo colonized the ship's decks and interior in huge numbers, eating away the wooden decking and other wooden objects such as furniture, paneling, doors and staircase banisters. When their food ran out they died, leaving behind calcareous tubes. The question of the victims' bodies is one that has often troubled explorers of the wreck site. When the debris field was surveyed in Robert Ballard's 1986 expedition, pairs of shoes were observed lying next to each other on the sea bed. The flesh, bones, and clothes had long since been consumed but the <b>tannin</b> in the shoes' leather had apparently resisted the bacteria, leaving the shoes as the only markers of where a body had once lain. Ballard has suggested that skeletons may remain deep within Titanics hull, such as in the engine rooms or third-class cabins. This has been disputed by scientists, who have estimated that the bodies would have completely disappeared by the early 1940s at the latest.|$|E
5|$|Plant {{material}} {{makes up}} the majority of most lemur diets. Members of at least 109 of all known plant families in Madagascar (55%) are exploited by lemurs. Since lemurs are primarily arboreal, most of these exploited species are woody plants, including trees, shrubs, or lianas. Only the ring-tailed lemur, the bamboo lemurs (genus Hapalemur), and the black-and-white ruffed lemur (Varecia variegata) are known to consume herbs. While Madagascar is rich in fern diversity, these plants are rarely eaten by lemurs. One possible {{reason for this is that}} ferns lack flowers, fruits, and seeds—common food items in lemur diets. They also occur close to the ground, while lemurs spend most of their time in the trees. Lastly, ferns have an unpleasant taste due to the high content of tannins in their fronds. Likewise, mangroves appear to be rarely exploited by lemurs due to their high <b>tannin</b> content. Some lemurs appear to have evolved responses against common plant defenses, however, such as tannins and alkaloids. The golden bamboo lemur (Hapalemur aureus), for instance, eats giant bamboo (Cathariostachys madagascariensis), which contains high levels of cyanide. This lemur can consume twelve times the typically lethal dose for most mammals on a daily basis; the physiological mechanisms that protect it from cyanide poisoning are unknown. At the Duke Lemur Center (DLC) in the United States, lemurs that roam the outdoor enclosures have been observed eating poison ivy (Taxicodendron radicans), yet have shown no ill effects.|$|E
50|$|Although {{citrus fruits}} do not {{themselves}} contain <b>tannins,</b> orange-colored juices often contain food dyes with <b>tannins.</b> Apple juice, grape juices and berry juices are all high in <b>tannins.</b> Sometimes <b>tannins</b> are even added to juices and ciders {{to create a}} more astringent feel to the taste.|$|R
50|$|In all {{vascular}} plants studied so far, <b>tannins</b> {{are manufactured}} by a chloroplast-derived organelle, the tannosome. <b>Tannins</b> are mainly physically {{located in the}} vacuoles or surface wax of plants. These storage sites keep <b>tannins</b> active against plant predators, but also keep some <b>tannins</b> from affecting plant metabolism while the plant tissue is alive; it is only after cell breakdown and death that the <b>tannins</b> are active in metabolic effects.|$|R
30|$|<b>Tannins</b> are {{astringent}} {{vegetable products}} {{found in most}} of the vegetable kingdom. <b>Tannins</b> are obtained from the various parts of the plants such as fruit, pods, plant galls, leaves, bark, wood, and roots. <b>Tannins</b> are defined as, water soluble phenolic compounds having molecular weights between 500 and 3000. <b>Tannins</b> are usually classified into two groups-hydrolysable (pyrogallol) and condensed <b>tannins</b> (proanthocyanidins). The hydrolysable <b>tannins</b> are polyesters of a sugar moiety and organic acids, grouped as gallotannis and ellagitannins which on hydrolysis yield galllic acid and ellagic acid, respectively [3, 68].|$|R
25|$|Banana {{plantations}} {{and other}} fruit orchards were established, and a tannery exploiting <b>tannin</b> from the mangroves.|$|E
25|$|The name of {{the wood}} may refer to dark stains on the hands of woodworkers, caused by {{the high levels of}} <b>tannin</b> in the timber.|$|E
25|$|Due {{to their}} {{concentrated}} flavours and high <b>tannin</b> content, many premium Syrah wines {{are at their}} best after some considerable bottle aging. In exceptional cases, this may be 15 years or longer.|$|E
5000|$|Phlobaphens can {{be formed}} under action of acids or heating of {{condensed}} <b>tannins</b> {{or of the}} fraction of <b>tannins</b> called phlobatannins. Water containing soda {{can be used for}} the conversion of hop <b>tannins</b> into phlobaphens. [...] When heated with hydrochloric acid, <b>tannins</b> in cocoa solids yield a glucose and a phlobaphene.|$|R
30|$|<b>Tannins</b> are {{primarily}} {{used in the}} preservation of leather. <b>Tannins</b> are used in glues, inks, stains and mordants. <b>Tannins</b> are also used for heavy metal removal in surface water treatment. <b>Tannins</b> play very important role in dyeing with natural dyes by improving the affinity of fibres towards different dyes. By mixing with different natural dyes it gives different shades like yellow, brown, grey and black. Acacia catechu (Cutch), Terminalia chebula (Harda), Punica granatum (Pomegranate/Anar), Quercus infectoria (Gallnut), are plant sources for <b>tannins</b> [3, 41, 65, 68, 69].|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} deals with {{phytochemical}} and anthelmintic evaluation of corm of Amorphophallus campanulatus. This evaluation revealed {{the presence of}} many phytochemical constituents. Corm was extracted with petroleum ether, chloroform and methanol. Crude <b>tannins</b> were isolated from methanol extract. All extracts and crude <b>tannins</b> were evaluated for anthelmintic activity. Chloroform, methanol extracts and crude <b>tannins</b> showed very good anthelmintic activity. Paralysis and death times of crude <b>tannins</b> were {{very close to the}} standard drug Albendazole. KEY WORDS Amorphophallus campanulatus, elephant foot yam, crude <b>tannins</b> and anthelmintic activity...|$|R
25|$|Blaufränkisch wines have {{aromas of}} dark ripe {{cherries}} and dark berries, are spicy, have medium <b>tannin</b> levels and sometimes very good acidity. Young wines are deeply fruity {{and become more}} velvety, supple and complex with age.|$|E
25|$|Australian bass vary in colour from xanthic (a {{shade of}} yellow), or gold in clear sandy streams {{to the more}} usual bronze or bronze-green {{colouration}} in streams with darker substrates and/or some <b>tannin</b> staining to the water.|$|E
25|$|The {{style and}} flavor profile of wines made from Syrah is {{influenced}} by the climate where the grapes are grown with moderate climates (such as the northern Rhone Valley and parts of the Walla Walla AVA in Washington State) tending to produce medium to full-bodied wines with medium-plus to high levels of tannins and notes of blackberry, mint and black pepper. In hot climates (such as Crete, and the Barossa Valley and McLaren Vale regions of Australia), Syrah is more consistently full-bodied with softer <b>tannin,</b> jammier fruit and spice notes of licorice, anise and earthy leather. In many regions the acidity and <b>tannin</b> levels of Syrah allow the wines produced to have favorable aging potential.|$|E
50|$|Principal human dietary {{sources of}} <b>tannins</b> are tea and coffee. Most wines aged in charred oak barrels possess <b>tannins</b> absorbed from the wood. Soils high in clay also {{contribute}} to <b>tannins</b> in wine grapes. This concentration gives wine its signature bitterness.|$|R
50|$|Phloroglucinolysis is an {{analytical}} technique to study condensed <b>tannins</b> {{by means of}} depolymerisation. The reaction makes use of phloroglucinol as nucleophile. Phlobaphenes formation (<b>tannins</b> condensation and precipitation) can be minimized in using strong nucleophiles, such as phloroglucinol, during pine <b>tannins</b> extraction.|$|R
50|$|<b>Tannins</b> are {{a common}} {{impurity}} in the bevarage ayahuasca made from mimosa hostilis root bark. <b>Tannins</b> contribute to the nausea and gastrointestinal upset associated with ayahuasca consumption. Addition of gelatin to ayahuasca binds to these <b>tannins,</b> causing them to sink.|$|R
25|$|Mulberry {{papers are}} coated with {{persimmon}} <b>tannin</b> and sealed {{together to form}} a firm sheet. A design is drawn onto the paper directly or traced from another source. The details are cut with a small blade and afterwards it is coated again to keep it from bending.|$|E
25|$|The small {{berries and}} thick skins of the grape {{contribute}} to high phenolic levels of Agiorgitiko which leads the wine needing very little maceration {{time in order}} to extract the deep, dark color associated with the grape. It also contribute to the <b>tannin</b> levels and the grape's ability to handle the effects of oak aging in the barrel.|$|E
25|$|Because of its shorter maceration, {{white wine}} {{contains}} very little <b>tannin</b> and therefore little antioxidants that make red wine so interesting medically speaking. However, {{a team of}} researchers from Montpellier has developed a white wine enriched with polyphenols. This wine niche is now intended for export to Northern Europe, a region that consumes a high proportion of white wine.|$|E
50|$|Acorns {{also contain}} bitter <b>tannins,</b> the amount varying with the species. Since <b>tannins,</b> which are plant polyphenols, {{interfere}} with an animal's ability to metabolize protein, creatures must adapt {{in different ways}} to use the nutritional value acorns contain. Animals may preferentially select acorns that contain fewer <b>tannins.</b> When the <b>tannins</b> are metabolized in cattle, the tannic acid produced can cause ulceration and kidney failure.|$|R
40|$|<b>Tannins</b> are a {{group of}} {{phenolic}} compounds which have {{received a lot of}} attention with respect to their possible nutritional and physiological actions. <b>Tannins</b> can be grouped into condensed and hydrolysable <b>tannins,</b> widely distributed in the plant kingdom. Hydrolysable <b>tannins</b> are polyester of phenolic acids such as gallic acid or ellagic acid or their derivatives and D-glucose. The condensed <b>tannins</b> are polymer of flavan- 3 -ols, flavan- 3, 4 -diols or related flavanol residues linked via carbon–carbon bonds. There is evidence that high levels of <b>tannins</b> could produce adverse effects in animals. These effects can be instantaneous like astringency or a bitter or unpleasant taste or can have a delayed response related to antinutritional/toxic effects...|$|R
5000|$|Pseudo <b>tannins</b> are low {{molecular}} weight compounds associated with other compounds. They do not change color during the Goldbeater's skin test, unlike hydrolysable and condensed <b>tannins,</b> and cannot be used as tanning compounds.
