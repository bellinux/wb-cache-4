Appointed medical registrar to the London Hospital in 1896 and elected assistant physician four years later, there is a verbatim report {{of one of his}} rounds in 1900. On this day he showed the young men a patient with mitral stenosis, adherent pericardium and heart failure. Almost twenty years later, one of <b>these</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> (a Dr. Donald Hunter) recorded him as teaching on the difference between bronchial and cardiac asthma.|$|E
25|$|In the 1950s St Patrick's Barracks in Ballymena was the Regimental Training Depot of the Royal Ulster Rifles (83rd & 86th). Many {{young men}} who had been conscripted on the United Kingdom mainland, along with others who had volunteered for service in the British Army, {{embarked}} upon their period of basic training in the Regimental Depot, prior to being posted to the regular regimental battalions. Many of <b>these</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> were to serve in Korea, Cyprus and with the British Army of the Rhine. In 1968 due to a series of government austerity measures, the remaining three Irish regiments, Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers (27th) Royal Ulster Rifles (83rd & 86th) and the Royal Irish Fusiliers (89th) merged to become the Royal Irish Rangers. Early in the 1990s the Royal Irish Regiment, whose Regimental Headquarters was at St Patrick's Barracks, was granted the Freedom of the Borough.|$|E

Among <b>these</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> were Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, who were given new names (Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah became Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, while Daniel's Babylonian name was Belteshazzar) and allocated rations of food and wine. But Daniel resolved not to defile himself, and refused the royal food and wine, thriving instead on vegetables and water. God gave them knowledge and skill, and to Daniel he gave insight into visions and dreams, and when the three years of training were completed none were found to compare with them in wisdom and understanding.|$|E

25|$|Navy {{nurses were}} on duty {{during the initial}} Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Kāneʻohe Bay, the Philippines, Guam, and aboard the Solace; they were vital in {{preventing}} further loss of life and limb. In fact, the nursing profession's vital role was quickly recognized and it became the only women's profession that was deemed so essential as to be placed under the War Manpower Commission. Despite shortages of qualified nurses during the war, the navy was able to hold to its standards and enroll nurses of outstanding qualifications and experience. These outstanding nurses received advanced training in surgery, orthopedics, anesthesia, contagion, dietetics, physiotherapy, and psychiatry, the latter helping men understand and manage Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome (then known as shell-shock) and battlefield fatigue. But the navy nurses' duties did not only include the tending to the injured and sick {{but also to the}} equally serious task of training Hospital Corpsmen. Many of <b>these</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> had never seen the inside of a hospital unless they themselves had been admitted, and as such it was training from the ground up. Once trained, the men were sent to work aboard fighting ships and on invasion beaches, where nurses were not yet officially assigned. Additionally, nurses trained WAVES for the Hospital Corps.|$|E
25|$|The rabbis {{in ancient}} times insisted on the {{marriage}} couple entering into the ketubah as a protection for the wife. It acted as a replacement of the biblical mohar – the price paid by the groom to the bride, or her parents, for the marriage (i.e., the bride price). The ketubah became a mechanism whereby the amount due to the wife (the bride-price) came to be paid {{in the event of}} the cessation of marriage, either by the death of the husband or divorce. It may be noted that the biblical mohar created a major social problem: many young prospective husbands could not raise the mohar at the time when they would normally be expected to marry. So, to enable <b>these</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> to marry, the rabbis, in effect, delayed the time that the amount would be payable, when they {{would be more likely to}} have the sum. The mechanism adopted was to provide for the mohar to be a part of the ketubah. It may also be noted that both the mohar and the ketubah amounts served the same purpose: the protection for the wife should her support (either by death or divorce) cease. The only difference between the two systems was the timing of the payment. A modern secular equivalent would be the entitlement to alimony in the event of divorce. Another function performed by the ketubah amount was to provide a disincentive for the husband contemplating divorcing his wife: he would need to have the amount to be able to pay to the wife.|$|E
500|$|As the {{university}} grew, more buildings were constructed {{on campus and}} a trolley system was built to connect the growing university to downtown Grand Forks. However, there were several major interruptions {{in the life of}} {{the university}}. In 1918, UND was the country's hardest-hit single institution by the flu epidemic that killed 1,400 people in North Dakota alone. Later that year, classes were suspended so the campus could become an army base for soldiers during World War I. During the Great Depression, UND provided free housing to students willing to do manual labor on campus. [...] "Camp Depression," [...] as it was called, consisted of railroad cabooses that housed eight male students each. [...] "Camp Depression" [...] students did not get regular meals from the cafeteria and had to be satisfied with only free leftovers. However, Grand Forks citizens often opened their homes and kitchen tables to many of <b>these</b> <b>young</b> <b>men.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The term patriarchy {{is often}} misused loosely {{to stand for}} [...] "male domination", while the more {{rigorous}} definition lies with the literal interpretation: [...] "the rule of the father".

500|$|Adopting {{the color}} of their {{favorite}} charioteers was a way fans showed their loyalty to that particular racer or faction. Many of the young men in the fan clubs, or factions, adopted extravagant clothing and hairstyles, such as billowing sleeves, [...] "Hunnic" [...] hair-styles, and [...] "Persian" [...] facial hair. There is evidence that <b>these</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> were the faction members most prone to violence and extreme factional rivalry. Some scholars have tried to argue that the factional rivalry and violence was a result of opposing religious or political views, but more likely the young men simply identified strongly with their faction for group solidarity. The factional violence was probably engaged in similarly to the violence of modern football or soccer fans. The games themselves were the usual focus of the factional violence, even when it was taken to the streets. Although fans who went to the hippodrome cheered on their favorite charioteers, their loyalty appears to be to the color for which the charioteer drove more than for the individual driver. Charioteers could change faction allegiance and race for different colors during their careers, but the fans didn't change their allegiance to their color.|$|E
