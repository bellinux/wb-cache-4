5|$|Few films {{before the}} late 1970s about the Vietnam War {{actually}} depicted combat. The exceptions included The Green Berets (1968). Critics such as Basinger explain <b>that</b> <b>Hollywood</b> avoided the subject because {{of opposition to}} United States involvement in the Vietnam War, making the subject divisive; in addition, the film industry was in crisis, and the army {{did not wish to}} assist in making anti-war films.|$|E

5|$|Kerry Conran {{grew up on}} {{films and}} comic books of the 1930s and 1940s. He and his brother, Kevin, were {{encouraged}} by their parents to develop their creative side at a young age. Kerry studied at a feeder program for Disney animators at CalArts, and became interested in 2-D computer animation. While there, he {{realized that it was}} possible to apply some of the techniques associated with animation to live-action. Conran had been out of film school for two years and was trying to figure out how to make a movie. He figured <b>that</b> <b>Hollywood</b> would never take a chance on an inexperienced, first-time filmmaker, so he decided to make the movie himself.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, Ralph's Spot {{was founded}} as a {{division}} of Bakshi Productions to produce commercials for Coca-Cola and Max, the 2000-Year-Old Mouse, a series of educational shorts paid for by Encyclopædia Britannica. Bakshi was uninterested {{in the kind of}} animation the studio was turning out, and wanted to produce something personal. He soon developed Heavy Traffic, a tale of inner-city street life. Krantz told Bakshi <b>that</b> <b>Hollywood</b> studio executives would be unwilling to fund the film because of its content and Bakshi's lack of film experience. While browsing the East Side Book Store on St. Mark's Place, Bakshi came across a copy of Robert Crumb's Fritz the Cat. Impressed by Crumb's sharp satire, Bakshi purchased the book and suggested to Krantz that it would work as a film. Krantz arranged a meeting with Crumb, during which Bakshi presented the drawings he had created while learning the artist's distinctive style to prove that he could adapt Crumb's artwork to animation. Impressed by Bakshi's tenacity, Crumb lent him one of his sketchbooks for reference.|$|E
5|$|Outside North America {{it opened}} {{reasonably}} well. In Australia {{it was the}} highest-earning film in its opening weekend of October 9–12, 2008 with $2,104,319, ahead of Pixar Animation's Wall-E, which fell to second place, while Beverly Hills Chihuahua held third. In the United Kingdom, the film's earnings were the second-highest behind Quantum of Solace during November 21–23, its opening weekend. It earned £991,939 from 393 screens. Overall, while the film grossed only $40 million at the North American box office, it has grossed $115,097,286 worldwide. In the United States, contemporary war films have performed relatively poorly. Warner Bros. had hoped the large budget and Scott's direction could better them, but the film performed relatively poorly compared to his others; analysts attributed this to the film's Middle East setting and exploration of terrorism. Brandon Gray pointed out that people read these themes {{in the news media}} already, and there is a perception <b>that</b> <b>Hollywood</b> films are biased.|$|E

25|$|Popular fiction often confuses Bligh with Edward Edwards of , who {{was sent}} on the Royal Navy's {{expedition}} to the South Pacific to find the mutineers {{and bring them to}} trial. Edwards is often made out to be the cruel man <b>that</b> <b>Hollywood</b> has portrayed Bligh as being. The 14 men from Bounty who were captured by Edwards' men were confined in a cramped 18′ × 11′ × 5′8″ wooden cell on Pandoras quarterdeck. Yet, when Pandora ran aground on the Great Barrier Reef, three prisoners were immediately let out of the prison cell to help at the pumps. And finally Captain Edwards did also give orders to release the other 11 prisoners, to which end Joseph Hodges the armourer's mate went into the cell to knock off the prisoners' irons. But before he could finish the job, the ship sank very quickly. Eventually four of the prisoners and 31 of the crew died during the wrecking. More prisoners would likely have perished, had not William Moulter, a bosun's mate, unlocked their cage before jumping off the sinking vessel.|$|E

In Lawrence Suid's view, The Longest Day [...] "served as the model for all subsequent combat spectaculars".
