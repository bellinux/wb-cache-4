5|$|Other {{studies suggest}} that rivaling Carnotaurus did not deliver rapid head blows, but pushed slowly against each other with the upper sides of their skulls. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>horns</b> {{may have been a}} device for the {{distribution}} of compression forces without damage to the brain. This is supported by the flattened upper sides of <b>the</b> <b>horns,</b> the strongly fused bones of the top of the skull, and the inability of the skull to survive rapid head blows.|$|E

5|$|Apart {{from its}} long face, the large chest and the sharply sloping back {{differentiate}} the hartebeest from other antelopes. The hartebeest shares several physical traits with the sassabies (genus Damaliscus), {{such as an}} elongated and narrow face, the shape of <b>the</b> <b>horns,</b> the pelage texture and colour, and the terminal tuft of the tail. The wildebeest have more specialised skull and horn features than the hartebeest. The hartebeest exhibits sexual dimorphism, but only slightly, as both sexes bear horns and have similar body masses. The degree of sexual dimorphism varies by subspecies. Males are 8% heavier than females in Swayne's and Lichtenstein's hartebeest, and 23% heavier in the red hartebeest. In one study, the highest dimorphism was found in skull weight. Another study concluded that {{the length of the}} breeding season is a good predictor of dimorphism in pedicle (the bony structures from which <b>the</b> <b>horns</b> grow) height and skull weight, and the best predictor of the horn circumference.|$|E
5|$|Gerardo Mazzetta {{and colleagues}} (1998) propose that <b>the</b> <b>horns</b> {{might also have}} been used to injure or kill small prey. Though horn cores are blunt, they may have had a similar form to modern bovid horns if there was a keratinous covering. However, this would be the only {{reported}} example of horns being used as hunting weapons in animals.|$|E
5|$|Male horn {{development}} {{has been linked to}} sexual selection, Horns are small spikes in the monogamous duikers and other small antelopes, whereas in the polygynous, they are large and elaborately formed (for example in a spiral structure, as in the giant eland). Thus, to some extent, horns depict the degree of competition among males in a species. However, the presence of horns in females is likely due to natural selection. <b>The</b> <b>horns</b> of females are usually smaller than those of males, and are sometimes of a different shape. <b>The</b> <b>horns</b> of female bovids are believed to have evolved for defence against predators or to express territoriality, as nonterritorial females, which are able to use crypsis for predator defence, often do not have horns. Females possess horns only in half of the bovid genera, and females in these genera are heavier than those in the rest. Females use horns mainly for stabbing.|$|E
50|$|While <b>the</b> <b>horn</b> (also {{known as}} <b>the</b> French <b>Horn)</b> is {{primarily}} used in classical music literature, in the mid-20th century <b>the</b> <b>horn</b> broke into <b>the</b> jazz world.

The second record was most total yards per game at 512.1. They also set a school single-season record for yards per rushing play with 5.9.|$|E
5|$|The skull {{had a pair}} of horns {{above and}} in front of the eyes. These horns were {{composed}} of extensions of the lacrimal bones, and varied in shape and size. There were also lower paired ridges running along the top edges of the nasal bones that led into <b>the</b> <b>horns.</b> <b>The</b> <b>horns</b> were probably covered in a keratin sheath and may have had a variety of functions, including acting as sunshades for the eye, being used for display, and being used in combat against other members of the same species (although they were fragile). There was a ridge along the back of the skull roof for muscle attachment, as is also seen in tyrannosaurids.|$|E
5|$|The thin {{long legs}} of the {{hartebeest}} provide for a quick escape in an open habitat; if attacked, the formidable horns are used {{to ward off the}} predator. The elevated position of the eyes enables the hartebeest to inspect its surroundings continuously even as it is grazing. The muzzle has evolved so as to derive maximum nutrition from even a frugal diet. <b>The</b> <b>horns</b> are also used during fights among males for dominance in the breeding season; the clash of <b>the</b> <b>horns</b> is loud enough that it can be heard from hundreds of metres away. The beginning of a fight is marked with a series of head movements and stances, as well as depositing droppings on dung piles. The opponents drop onto their knees and, after giving a hammer-like blow, begin wrestling, their horns interlocking. One attempts to fling the head of the other to one side to stab the neck and shoulders with his horns. Fights are rarely serious, but can be fatal if they are.|$|E

5|$|Four-horned antelopes tend {{to inhabit}} areas with {{significant}} grass cover or heavy undergrowth, and avoid human settlements. Earlier common throughout deciduous forests in India, the antelope now occurs in widely disjunct, small populations. Most of the populations are in India, and lower numbers {{can be found}} in adjoining Nepal. The four-horned antelope is threatened by the loss of its natural habitat due to agricultural expansion. Moreover, the unusual four-horned skull and <b>the</b> <b>horns</b> have been a popular target for trophy hunters. The four-horned antelope is classified as Vulnerable by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN).|$|E

5000|$|The {{most recent}} {{development}} in dehorning technology is {{use of a}} caustic dehorning paste. The paste is used on calves at less than two days old. The hair around <b>the</b> <b>horn</b> is trimmed back and then the paste is spread all over <b>the</b> <b>horn</b> bud and {{around the base of}} <b>the</b> <b>horn</b> on <b>the</b> growth cells. The paste kills the growth ring of <b>the</b> <b>horn</b> and then <b>the</b> <b>horn</b> falls off like a scab when it is healed.

5|$|On 30 March, the Kurdish irregulars confronted Aqil's irregulars and Bedouin allies at <b>the</b> <b>Horns</b> of Hattin, {{near the}} village of Hattin. For the most part, both sides were armed with swords and spears and to a lesser extent, rifles, rather than the modern {{weaponry}} at the Ottoman military's disposal. Initially, the battle was going in Shamdin's favor and a portion of Aqil's troops began to flee. However, Salih Agha, Aqil's brother, led his group in a surprise attack against the Kurds. As a result, Shamdin's forces were dealt a decisive blow and commander Hasan Agha was among the 150 fatalities of that battle.|$|E
5|$|The bovids show great {{variation}} {{in size and}} pelage colouration. Excepting some domesticated forms, all male bovids have two or more horns, and in many species females possess horns, too. The {{size and shape of}} <b>the</b> <b>horns</b> vary greatly, but the basic structure is always one or more pairs of simple bony protrusions without branches, often having a spiral, twisted or fluted form, each covered in a permanent sheath of keratin. Most bovids bear 30 to 32 teeth.|$|E
5|$|The four-horned {{antelope}} {{is the sole}} member of the genus Tetracerus, and is placed under the family Bovidae.

40|$|A new horn {{with high}} {{displacement}} amplification for ultrasonic welding is developed. The profile of <b>the</b> <b>horn</b> is a nonrational B-spline curve {{with an open}} uniform knot vector.

5|$|Admiral Friedrich von Ingenohl, {{commander}} of the German High Seas Fleet, decided that another raid on the English coast should be {{carried out in the}} hopes of luring a portion of the Grand Fleet into combat where it could be destroyed. At 03:20, CET on 15 December 1914, Blücher, Moltke, Von der Tann, the new battlecruiser , and Seydlitz, along with the light cruisers Kolberg, Strassburg, Stralsund, Graudenz, and two squadrons of torpedo boats left the Jade estuary. The ships sailed north past the island of Heligoland, until they reached <b>the</b> <b>Horns</b> Reef lighthouse, at which point the ships turned west towards Scarborough. Twelve hours after Hipper left the Jade, the High Seas Fleet, consisting of 14 dreadnoughts and eight pre-dreadnoughts and a screening force of two armored cruisers, seven light cruisers, and 54 torpedo boats, departed to provide distant cover for the bombardment force.|$|E
40|$|A new horn {{for high}} {{displacement}} amplification {{has been designed}} and tested. The profile of <b>the</b> <b>horn</b> is a cubic B?zier curve.
