5|$|The Sci-Fi Dine-In {{is modeled}} after a 1950s {{drive-in}} theater. The entrance {{is made to}} look like a box office, and guests can walk from there along a tall fence <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room,</b> where they sit at formica countertops in booths {{made to look like}} convertibles from the 1940s and 1950s. These booths were designed by Walt Disney Imagineering and are made of fiberglass with much chrome plating. The cars have whitewall tires, and speakers are mounted on poles next to each car. The license plates are dated from 1955, and each convertible seats four people, although these mock vehicles were initially six-seaters when the restaurant first opened. There are six picnic tables near {{the back of the room}} that are only used when the rest of the restaurant is full and there are guests who are willing to forego the experience of sitting in the cars. All guests who make reservations are seated in the cars, although this was not the case the year the restaurant first opened. The restaurant has a total seating capacity of 260.|$|E
5|$|For the National Register of Historic Places nomination, {{only the}} {{interior}} {{of one of the}} four units was surveyed, the second floor interior of 341 Broadway. This unit is accessed from a spiral staircase leading from the first floor to the attic. The second floor landing has a short foyer before opening to two parlors. The front parlor is said to have had a water fountain which was removed, but the plumbing is said to exist within the floor. The back parlor has a Queen Anne mantel and leads <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> with large floor-to-ceiling china closets. Located {{on the east side of}} the apartment is the kitchen, pantry and rear staircase. The north part of the apartment contains two bedrooms and a bath. The NRHP nomination states that the alterations to the unit were minimal and it is likely that the same would have been done for the first floor unit. The northern Fuller House, containing 343-345 Broadway, has been more seriously modified because it has been split into four units. In 2013, real estate information for 343 Broadway suggests the expanse of the modifications to the house by listing the property as having 20 rooms, with 8 bedrooms and 5 baths. According to Trulia the house was sold in 2010 for $140,000 and still in the four unit configuration. A three-bay stuccoed garage dating from the 1920s or 1930 is used by 339-341 Broadway.|$|E
5|$|Kenwood {{has three}} floors: {{on the ground}} floor during the Lennon period the front door opened onto an {{entrance}} hall, where Lennon placed a suit of armour and a gorilla suit. Across the hall was a large living room, which had black carpets, two 18-foot sofas and a marble fireplace. To the left of the hall was a toilet, and through the living room was a dining room, where purple, velvet wallpaper was put up. Adjacent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room,</b> {{at the back of the}} house, was a small sunroom. This was decorated with various pictures, caricatures and stickers, such as the one from the Safe as Milk debut album (1967) by Captain Beefheart & His Magic Band, and one advertising the Monterey Pop Festival. Photos published by The Beatles Book Monthly show the shelves of the sunroom filled with articles such as a large, ornate cross, a Mickey Mouse doll and a mortar and pestle, reportedly used by Lennon to mix various combinations of cocaine, amphetamine, barbiturates and LSD. There was also a yellow sofa or chaise-longue upon which Lennon would spend much of his time. It was a present from his aunt, Elizabeth Smith (née Stanley) also known as Mimi. Behind the sunroom was the split-level kitchen where state-of-the-art appliances were installed, so complex that a tutor had to come and give the Lennons lessons in their use.|$|E
50|$|The Servants' Hall is {{a common}} room for {{domestic}} workers in a great house. The term usually refers <b>to</b> <b>the</b> servants' <b>dining</b> <b>room.</b>|$|R

50|$|Many of the {{passengers}} who had been asleep in their cabins found themselves unable <b>to</b> escape <b>the</b> fire. Some passengers were told <b>to</b> go <b>to</b> <b>the</b> main <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> await instructions, but most ignored this order, since <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> lay directly {{in the path of}} the fire.|$|R
5|$|The Capitol {{has also}} been witness to murder and death. Rep. William P. Taulbee had been a congressman from Kentucky from 1884 to 1888. Charles E. Kincaid, a {{journalist}} for The Louisville Times, had accused Taulbee of adultery and involvement in a Patent Office scandal, which had ruined Taulbee's political career. On February 28, 1890, the ex-congressman and the reporter ran into {{one another in the}} Capitol, and Taulbee assaulted and embarrassed Kincaid by tweaking the much smaller man's nose. Kincaid ran home, grabbed a pistol, and, when he encountered Taulbee on a marble staircase leading from the House chamber down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room,</b> shot him in the face just below Taulbee's left eye. Taulbee died two weeks later, and Kincaid was acquitted after claiming self-defense. Journalists and others claim that whenever a reporter slips on these steps, Taulbee's ghost briefly appears. Former President and then-Rep. John Quincy Adams suffered a stroke at his desk in the House chamber on February 21, 1848, and was taken into the Speaker's Room. His physical condition was too precarious to permit him to be moved, and he died at the Capitol two days later. Many people claim to have heard Adams' ghost denouncing slavery late at night in National Statuary Hall, and one Congressional staff member claims that by standing in the spot where Adams' desk once stood a person can still hear the former president's ghostly whisper. James A. Garfield {{was a member of the}} House from 1863 to 1881 before assuming the Presidency in March 1881. Garfield was shot by Charles J. Guiteau, a disgruntled office seeker, on July 2, 1881, at 9:30a.m. as he walked through the Sixth Street Station of the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad in Washington, D.C. Garfield died of heart failure brought about by blood poisoning (itself caused by poor medical care) on September 19, 1881, while recuperating at a beach house near Long Branch, New Jersey. Witnesses have seen Garfield's specter walking solemnly through the halls of Congress.|$|E
25|$|At 6:00am, {{one of the}} assassins, Hamdi Quran, went <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> of {{the hotel}} {{to make sure that}} Minister Ze'evi would indeed be there in {{accordance}} with his routine schedule. At 06:20am Ze'evi and his wife Yael went down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> of the hotel. When Quran noticed the minister was in a dining hall, he immediately went back to the room where the assassins were staying and updated his associates. As a result, two assailants headed towards their vehicle, which was parked in the hotel's basement parking lot, to fetch their pistols which were modified with silencers. In order not to raise suspicion, the two assailants returned separately back to their room through the staircase instead of the elevator.|$|E
25|$|A stained-glass {{antechamber}} {{leads from}} the yard to {{the interior of the}} house. The lobby, which includes a French fireplace and a bust of Atatürk, leads <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> and to the biggest of the three salons. The remaining rooms include a winter garden and Atatürk's former office.|$|E
50|$|Inside {{the main}} house, a {{stairway}} leads {{up from the}} front entry, with a parlor occupying <b>the</b> space <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left. <b>The</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> is behind <b>the</b> parlor, with the kitchen occupying the first addition. <b>The</b> parlor and <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> have matching fireplaces with black marble mantels. The upstairs of the main house has three bedrooms, one of which has a builtin desk and bookcases, {{and may have been}} used as a study.|$|R
50|$|The French 75 Bar {{that lies}} next <b>to</b> <b>the</b> main <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> of Arnaud's was {{strictly}} a gentlemen-only area when the Cazenave family owned the restaurant. In 2003, the bar after being renovated reverted {{to its original}} name, French 75 Bar.|$|R
50|$|Interior areas {{amount to}} 3300 ft2 m2 {{on the first}} floor and 1980 ft2 m2 on the second. In {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> add-on <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> and kitchen, <b>the</b> property includes a woodshed and an outhouse, neither of which remains functional.|$|R
25|$|Meanwhile, at 6:45am Ze'evi's driver, Adi Maman, got <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> of {{the hotel}} and joined Ze'evi and his wife for breakfast. At 06:50am Ze'evi headed by himself towards his room using the elevator. Two minutes later, Yael Ze'evi and the driver, Adi Maman, also began heading towards Ze'evi's room.|$|E
25|$|The {{restaurant}} was closed in 2001, and {{a used car}} dealership leased the property. In January 2007, the lessees of Johnie's started to illegally tear it down. The destruction of the building was halted, with extreme damage to the building, though the sign is intact. Tenants made significant alterations <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> without permits, and the City of Downey had to issue several stop work orders and citations.|$|E
25|$|To {{the left}} of the Entrance Hall, {{mirroring}} the Living Room is the Dining Room. The room features rounded curio cabinets in the north end corners of the room, and black marble flooring {{in the center of the}} room, with carpet around the perimeter. Connected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dining</b> <b>Room</b> is the Kitchen that was not open to the public until 1995, as Elvis' aunt Delta used it until her death in 1993.|$|E
40|$|What {{occurs in}} a {{physical}} properties and sensory research laboratory is relevant to food developers, chefs, and others working in the hospitality/culinary sector {{as well as to}} any curious food lover. Thanks <b>to</b> <b>the</b> contributions of science, the latest food innovations are percolating through <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>rooms</b> of restaurant managers who want <b>to</b> improve <b>the</b> consumption experience. However, scientific developments and findings are not limited <b>to</b> <b>the</b> food revolution itself. New methods are being applied to understand consumers better and convey correct messages successfully. Contextual factors are also being taken into account when studying consumer perceptions. Taken together, if managed appropriately in a restaurant setting, these insights can enhance the gastronomic experience...|$|R
25|$|A major {{restoration}} of the Ebell complex commenced in 1989. The theater's seats were recovered, the stage refitted, and new sound and lighting systems installed.

25|$|The Officers' Mess {{was moved}} in 1960 to the Senior Staff Mess {{at which point}} 'Bill & Alfie's' became a {{recreational}} space for Senior Cadets. There were renovations to Fort LaSalle dormitory and Yeo Hall between 1993–1995 to accommodate {{the closure of the}} other two colleges. In 1997, there were additions <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dining</b> <b>Room,</b> and an extension for the kitchen and servery above which is the Cadet Mess at Yeo Hall.|$|E
25|$|The {{main house}} was rebuilt by William Douglas, 3rd Duke of Hamilton in 1677 with a uniform facade {{and a pair}} of stone {{staircases}} at the ends. He sent his plans to help William Douglas, 1st Duke of Queensberry with his building works, which included Drumlanrig Castle in Dumfriesshire and Queensberry House in Edinburgh. An inventory of 1688 gives the names of rooms in the now gutted main house. The front door opened into a Laich Hall, and a grand stair to the south led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> above. The same arrangement can still be seen at the contemporary Argyll's Lodging, Stirling.|$|E
25|$|Order of precedence: {{even without}} showy display, {{a group of}} people walking forward may be said to form a {{procession}} if their order and placement clearly visualize a hierarchy or symbiotic relationship. For instance, one's nearness to the king or others of high rank had important political connotations when the royal family walked to or from chapel services at the palace of Versailles. Similarly, precedence came into play when the grandest Edwardian parties progressed from the sitting room <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room,</b> and the stylized movement and hierarchy of marching military units clearly sets up a formal procession.|$|E
50|$|The centre costs {{approximately}} £4m {{each year}} to run, and is funded almost entirely by regular donations from 67,000 police officers. It does not solicit donations from the public. However, there are sometimes other sources of income; since 2009, the Home Office provided £1.6m in grants {{in order to improve}} accessibility, and <b>to</b> refurbish <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room.</b>|$|R
50|$|In early 2010, the Alajmo {{brothers}} remodeled <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> of Le Calandre, using Max’s culinary {{philosophy as}} their guide.

50|$|Leys married Adelaïde van Haren in 1841. The {{couple had}} {{two daughters and}} a son. The family Leys {{initially}} lived in the Hobokenstraat. In 1855 Leys had a more spacious house built in the street, which now bears his name, and was then called the Statiestraat. From 1857 to 1861 he worked on murals <b>to</b> decorate <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> of his house.|$|R
25|$|Jesuit has {{a spacious}} country retreat with a lake and woods to {{accommodate}} {{various forms of}} retreats, and other groups. It includes a chapel and dining room each seating 125 people, and adjacent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> a conference hall plus 8 rooms for break-out sessions. Near the chapel is a large, octagonal building in a wooded setting, for quiet reflection. There are 8 cabins spread over the grounds, each with 5 double bedrooms. There is also a bunkhouse, in proximity to the recreation area which includes a 400,000 square foot covered pavilion. A guest house completes the facility.|$|E
25|$|The bishops {{apartment}} {{consisted of}} two antechambers, bedroom-study and a study. The antechamber adjacent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> area was once decorated with a plafond depicting {{the scene of the}} 1634 treaty ending the Polish-Muscovite War (Treaty of Stuhmsdorf), while its walls were covered with a gilded cordovan. Among the elements of the original furnishing the most important are black marble fireplace topped with the Korab coat of arms and the remnants of marble floor. The framework Venetian ceilings, patterned after such in the Palazzo Ducale, appeared in Poland in the early 17th century initially in the interiors of royal residences (Wawel Castle). Such decoration soon become the main feature of the representative chambers of the noble residencies, town halls and even merchant houses. Among a dozen ceilings documented in sources only two preserved - in Gdańsk and Kielce.|$|E
25|$|The {{house has}} a classic Beaux-Arts plan, with the major public rooms on its ground floor – the central Elliptical Hall, Dining Room, and Living Room – all in one line, {{parallel}} to the Hudson River. North and South Foyers provide transitional space from the Hall <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dining</b> <b>Room</b> and Living Room. Five secondary spaces are located off the Elliptical Hall: the Lobby, Den, Gold Room, Grand Stair Hall, and Lavatory. The second floor rooms, comprising Mrs. Vanderbilt's suite of Bedroom, Boudoir and Bathroom (designed by Ogden Codman), Mr. Vanderbilt's Bedroom and Bathroom, Guest Bedrooms and Baths and the Linen Room, are disposed around the Second Floor Hall and the North and South Foyers. The third floor contains five additional guest bedrooms, and a Servants' Hall separated from the guests' rooms by a door at the main staircase. Supported by both concrete and steel, the Vanderbilt mansion was considered modern for its time. The mansion also included plumbing and forced hot air central heating and electric lighting which was powered by a hydroelectric plant built on the estate on the Crumb Elbow stream. The Vanderbilt estate had electric lighting before the surrounding area.|$|E
50|$|The {{adjoining}} building, situated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east of {{the main}} hotel, is two storeyed with a painted corrugated galvanised iron hip roof. Originally single storeyed it is externally clad with painted vertical corrugated iron on the lower storey and ripple iron <b>to</b> <b>the</b> upper. <b>The</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> has timber double hung windows and is lined with an early fibro sheeting. A skillion roofed veranda <b>to</b> <b>the</b> first floor level on the street elevation has been enclosed with flat fibro cladding. The living quarters behind it have recently been lined internally.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> luxurious <b>dining</b> <b>room,</b> {{there was}} also a chapel with a neo-gothic style, a grand foyer which rose four decks, a shooting gallery, an elaborate gymnasium, and even a merry-go-round for the younger passengers. Every cabin had beds instead of bunks, and even many of the chairs aboard the Île de France had a new design.|$|R
40|$|Adjacencies in {{architecture}} are those {{relationships between the}} various parts of building that are critical to its success. For example, <b>the</b> living and <b>dining</b> <b>rooms</b> in typical home design have {{a high degree of}} adjacency. The rooms support each other and, frequently, the living room is <b>the</b> space <b>to</b> which <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> is adjacent. In other words, the living room is the central space that <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> should be near so that both spaces may function in a positive way...|$|R
25|$|On {{the first}} floor are located the parlor, the library, two dining rooms, and the kitchen. One of the dining rooms {{is located in the}} western wing, off of the hallway, and was used {{primarily}} used by the family for smaller meals like breakfast or tea. The kitchen is also in the wing, directly adjacent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room.</b> The other dining room, located in the front western side of the main house, was used only for formal dinners and as the sitting room where the men would converse after dinner. The fireplace in the room was enclosed in marble when Buchanan bought Wheatland and had a furnace installed. Across the hall, {{on the other side of}} the main house is the parlor, where the women guests would congregate after dinner. The library is located off the hallway in the east wing. The woodwork, doors, a bookcase, and a bookshelf built into the wall were grained to resemble oak. The shelves in the bookshelf no longer exist; but, the backboard of the bookshelf is visible, as is the plaster wall made to resemble wood. Two mahogany bookcases, flanking the fireplace in the library, were furnished by Jenkins and having been sold to each successive owner by the previous one. The library was primarily used by Buchanan as the place to meet with guests.|$|E
25|$|With Anna in chains, Ingrid asks Anna {{to recall}} {{the tale of a}} king who lost his only daughter, and as a result, used a mirror to cast a spell on his whole kingdom, making them see only the worst qualities in those around them, leading them to kill each other. Ingrid uses a small shard of the mirror to cast the same spell, the Spell of Shattered Sight, on Anna, {{resulting}} in Anna becoming negative and resentful against Elsa for deserting her during their childhood. Elsa suspects a spell has been cast on her sister when Anna comes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> carrying the urn and saying only negative things about her. Ingrid demands that Elsa freeze Anna to prevent her from trapping Elsa inside of the urn; however, Elsa refuses to hurt her sister, crossing her arms to hold in her magic. Still under the spell, Anna traps Elsa inside the urn, even as Elsa tells her that no matter what she does, she will always love her. Anna realizes too late what she has done when Ingrid takes the urn from her, and Kristoff arrives to stop Ingrid. Unfortunately, Elsa's entrapment was not Ingrid's original plan, and in her anger, she uses her powers to freeze Anna, Kristoff, and the entire Kingdom of Arendelle. Rumplestiltskin appears in the dining room, finding Ingrid practicing her Rock Troll magic, pulling memories from Elsa, still inside the urn, over to a rock in her other hand. Rumplestiltskin asks her to give him the Sorcerer's Hat box; when she refuses, he magically takes and hides the urn and Anna's necklace, saying he will return them only in exchange for the box.|$|E
