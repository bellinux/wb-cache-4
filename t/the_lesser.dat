Despite {{seasonal}} and local variations, foliage from {{trees and shrubs}} constitute 60–80% of the diet throughout the year. <b>The</b> <b>lesser</b> kudu is mainly active at night and during the dawn, and seeks shelter in dense thickets just after the sunrise. <b>The</b> <b>lesser</b> kudu exhibits no territorial behaviour, and fights are rare. While females are gregarious, adult males prefer being solitary. No fixed breeding season is seen; births may occur {{at any time of}} the year. <b>The</b> <b>lesser</b> kudu inhabits dry, flat, and heavily forested regions.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>lesser</b> kudu browses {{primarily}} at dusk or at dawn, and {{is associated with}} the gerenuk and the impala. <b>The</b> <b>lesser</b> kudu and the gerenuk might compete for evergreen species in the dry season.

It eats succulent plants, such as the wild sisal, Sansevieria, and Euphorbia species in the dry season, and drinks water when sources are available.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>lesser</b> kudu's shyness and {{its ability}} to {{camouflage}} itself in dense cover has protected it from the risks of poaching.

However, rinderpest outbreaks, to which <b>the</b> <b>lesser</b> kudu is highly susceptible, have resulted in a steep decline of 60% in the animal's population in Tsavo National Park in Kenya. Overgrazing, human settlement, and loss of habitat are some other threats to the survival of <b>the</b> <b>lesser</b> kudu.|$|E

5|$|It differs in {{appearance}} from the similar {{lesser yellow-headed vulture}} in several ways. It is larger than <b>the</b> <b>lesser</b> yellow-headed vulture, with a longer, broader tail. The plumage is a dark, glossy black in contrast to <b>the</b> <b>lesser</b> yellow-headed vulture's browner plumage. Its legs are darker in color and its head is more yellow and less orange/pink than that of <b>the</b> <b>lesser</b> yellow-headed vulture. Its wings are broader and its flight is also steadier. Unlike {{the other members of}} the genus Cathartes, the greater yellow-headed vulture has relatively dark inner primaries, which contrast slightly with the paler secondaries and outer primaries. The greater yellow-headed vulture prefers to live in forests while <b>the</b> <b>lesser</b> yellow-headed vulture prefers to inhabit savannas, and it is more heavily built than <b>the</b> <b>lesser</b> yellow-headed vulture. The greater yellow-headed vulture is also somewhat larger than the turkey vulture. It can be distinguished from that species only at relatively close range by the differing head coloration. The underwing coloration is similar to the turkey vulture but the greater yellow-headed usually has a faint but broad and dark band vertically down the middle of the wings.|$|E
5|$|Later in 2015, Lenoble {{reviewed}} overlooked historical Spanish and French sources, finding {{references to}} mainly red macaws consistent with <b>the</b> <b>Lesser</b> Antillean macaw. The {{writings of the}} French missionary Raymond Breton (on Guadeloupe from 1635 to 1654) were especially illuminating, as they showed that both he and the native Island Caribs clearly distinguished between the red macaws of Guadeloupe and the scarlet macaws from the mainland, which supports the idea that <b>the</b> <b>Lesser</b> Antillean macaw represents an independent species. As <b>the</b> <b>Lesser</b> Antillean Carib language had different words reserved for men and women, Breton gave {{the name of the}} bird as Kínoulou (♂) and Caarou (♀). Lenoble furthermore concluded that the supposed violet macaw (named Anodorhynchus purpurascens based on accounts of blue parrots from Guadeloupe) was based on misidentified references to the also-extinct Guadeloupe amazon (Amazona violacea), and therefore never existed.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Lesser</b> Antillean macaw or Guadeloupe macaw (Ara guadeloupensis) is a {{hypothetical}} extinct species of macaw that {{is thought to}} have been endemic to <b>the</b> <b>Lesser</b> Antillean island region of Guadeloupe. In spite of the absence of conserved specimens, many details about <b>the</b> <b>Lesser</b> Antillean macaw are known from several contemporary accounts, and the bird is the subject of some illustrations. Austin Hobart Clark described the species {{on the basis of these}} accounts in 1905. Due to the lack of physical remains, and the possibility that sightings were of macaws from the South American mainland, doubts have been raised about the existence of this species. A phalanx bone from the island of Marie-Galante confirmed the existence of a similar-sized macaw inhabiting the region prior to the arrival of humans, and was correlated with <b>the</b> <b>Lesser</b> Antillean macaw in 2015. Later that year, historical sources distinguishing between the red macaws of Guadeloupe and the scarlet macaw (A. macao) of the mainland were identified, further supporting its validity.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>lesser</b> yellow-headed vulture flies solitarily, {{with wings}} {{held in a}} {{dihedral}} position.
