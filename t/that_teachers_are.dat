Chinea stated that, in many schools she served, the students {{had no interest in}} learning, abused the teachers, vandalized property, and joined gangs. Chinea, who was injured on the job, stated <b>that</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>are</b> underpaid and under-appreciated in the district.

60|$|The {{spreading}} {{recognition of}} drawing {{as an element}} of education is one among many signs of the more rational views on mental culture now beginning to prevail. Once more it may be remarked <b>that</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>are</b> at length adopting the course which Nature has perpetually been pressing on their notice. The spontaneous attempts made by children to represent the men, houses, trees, and animals around them--on a slate {{if they can get}} nothing better, or with lead-pencil on paper if they can beg them--are familiar to all. To be shown through a picture-book is one of their highest gratifications; and as usual, their strong imitative tendency presently generates in them the ambition to make pictures themselves also. This effort to depict the striking things they see is a further instinctive exercise of the perceptions--a means whereby still greater accuracy and completeness of observation are induced. And alike by trying to interest us in their discoveries of the sensible properties of things, and by their endeavours to draw, they solicit from us just that kind of culture which they most need.|$|E

50|$|Human behavior, {{like most}} other animals, is often driven by rewards and {{directed}} by the energetic cost of an action.

With experience, they internalize effort as a valuable commodity.|$|E
