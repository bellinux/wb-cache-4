3000|$|This paper {{shows that}} {{validation}} of in vivo medical imaging techniques and image processing algorithms is challenging partially {{due to the}} lack of appropriate reference data. Although experimental validation methods using soft tissue MR imaging phantoms can be developed, the data derived from these often suffers uncertainties similar to those present in the target soft tissue. Therefore <b>the</b> <b>validation</b> <b>method</b> itself often lacks an appropriate reference. In this paper a novel technique for the validation of a 3 D MR imaging-based motion and deformation tracking technique, applicable to 3 D deformation, is presented. <b>The</b> <b>validation</b> <b>method,</b> based on marker tracking, was evaluated (and validated) using simulated magnitude MR image data because this allows full control and knowledge of marker locations and thus provides the final real [...] "gold standard.''

40|$|Aims and objectives: To explore {{any changes}} in nurses’ skills at {{communicating}} with residents with dementia disease when using <b>the</b> <b>validation</b> <b>method,</b> as observed in one-to-one videotaped conversations. Background: Communication difficulties due to cognitive impairment among residents with dementia disease may complicate care situations. Training can improve nurses’ communication skills and increase care quality. <b>The</b> <b>validation</b> <b>method</b> aims to facilitate communication with residents with dementia disease through empathic and confirmatory approaches. Evaluations of <b>the</b> <b>validation</b> <b>method</b> have primarily focused on the residents’ perspective, and reports on nurses’ experiences are sparse. Improved communication and relationships with residents after validation method training have been described previously. Videotaped data could provide additional information about these earlier results. Design: A descriptive qualitative design. Methods: Eight nurses participated in a year of validation method training, including videotaped conversations with eleven residents. Videotapes with at least five months {{between the first and}} last recording were analysed and compared qualitatively. Results: The analysis revealed an overall pattern: nurses’ movements within and between various paths when improving their communication skills. This was based on three sub-patterns: from controlling communication towards developing attentiveness in communication, from ambiguous communication towards developing coherence in communication, and from being open and attentive towards having a refined attuned communication. Conclusions: All nurses developed their communication skills during the programme, albeit to different degrees. The findings are in congruence with the experiences described by nurses, and so it is reasonable to believe that the programme helped to improve the nurses’ skills in communicating with residents with dementia disease. Relevance to clinical practice: A validation method training programme could give nurses the possibility to develop their skills in communicating with residents with dementia disease...|$|E

40|$|Communication {{difficulties}} among {{residents with}} dementia disease living {{in nursing homes}} may complicate care situations. These residents can have difficulties describing how they experience their everyday lives, {{which can lead to}} withdrawal, social isolation, or feelings of homelessness. Research indicates that nurses involved in dementia care experience communication as difficult and challenging. <b>The</b> <b>validation</b> <b>method</b> developed by Feil is held to facilitate communication through emphatic and confirmatory approaches. Scientific reviews show insufficient evidence for recommending the use of the method, in spite of this the method is used in dementia care. Evaluations of <b>the</b> <b>validation</b> <b>method</b> have primarily focused on the residents’ perspective, and reports on nurses’ experiences of <b>the</b> <b>validation</b> <b>method</b> are sparse. The overall aim for this thesis was to evaluate Feils’ validation method by describing nurses’ experiences and skills in communication observed during implementation of a training programme. Twelve nurses participated in <b>the</b> <b>validation</b> <b>method</b> training programme that included 10 days of theoretical training with supervision about once a month, and practical training integrated in everyday work. During practical training nurses had conversation with 3 residents each 2 - 3 times a week, and videotaped one conversation per month. Methods: The design is based on naturalistic scientific approach. Data were collected with interviews (I, II) and a questionnaire (II) before and after the programme, and videotaped conversations during the programme (III, IV). An interview was conducted as a comparison with nurses from another nursing home, who had long experiences of using <b>the</b> <b>validation</b> <b>method</b> (I). The result showed that nurses improved their communication and had closer relationships with residents with dementia disease after validation method training, in accordance with nurses with long experiences (I). The training strengthened the nurses, but also posed an extra strain on them. Even though the nurses described an extra strain on the entire nursing staff, this was not reflected in the results from the questionnaire about the work climate (II). Videotaped one-to-one conversations between nurses and residents showed that the nurses developed their approaches and communication skills, although to different degrees. An overall pattern revealed nurses’ movements within and between various paths when improving their communication skills (III). The findings were in congruence with the nurses described experiences (I). In videotaped conversations {{from the end of the}} programme, the residents had the possibilities to use their remaining communication abilities and to communicate what was currently on their mind (IV). This may be related to the development of the nurses’ communication skills during the programme. Conclusions of this thesis were that the nurses developed their skills in caring approach and communication when communicating with residents with dementia disease, which gave these residents possibilities to communicate according to their abilities. In order to integrate new knowledge about communication the results showed that it was necessary to combine theoretical and practical training with supervision and reflection. To provide nursing staff with this type of training could be seen as an investment for nursing homes, an opportunity to increase job satisfaction for nurses and to increase social community for residents...|$|E
