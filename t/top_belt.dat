50|$|The title, {{which had}} {{originally}} been classed as a world title, was downgraded to regional status after All Japan joined the National Wrestling Alliance but retained its status as the top All Japan singles title until 1981. In 1989 Jumbo Tsuruta and Stan Hansen would unify this, the NWA United National Championship and the NWA International Heavyweight title to create the Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship. The original belt remained in use {{as part of the}} Triple Crown until 2013, when the three belts were replaced by a single belt. As the original <b>top</b> <b>belt</b> in All Japan, its design formed the front plate of the new belt; the other two belts' designs took the sides.|$|E

Bureau of Mines {{evaluated}} {{the effectiveness of}} automatic water sprinkler systems on the suppression of incipient and propagating conveyor belt fires under ventilated conditions. Large-scale experiments were performed at airflows ranging from 1. 1 to 4. 6 m/s. In incipient fire experiments with 10020 C, standard-response sprinklers installed above and between the belts, the sprinklers activated later, the peak heat release rates were larger, and more belting was consumed at the higher airflow. In similar experiments with 74 20 C, fast-response sprinklers, the sprinklers activated at the same heat release rate for both high and low airflows, but the peak heat release rate and amount of belting consumed was slightly higher at the lower airflow. In incipient fire experiments with sprinklers located only above the <b>top</b> <b>belt,</b> the heat release rate and amount of belting consumed was larger at the higher airflow. The propagating fire experiments showed that sprinklers located above and between the belts were effective in stopping flame propagation.

40|$|Commercially {{available}} extractors and dryers {{are equipped}} with spreading and overfeeding devices to regain width and return the stretched loops to a more normal state. Spreading must be accompanied with overfeed {{in order to be}} effective ’ Relaxation drying allows those excessive tensions to be released since the fabric is dried under little or no restraints. Most relaxation dryers are based on the belt principle, where the fabric is placed between two belts and then passed through the drying zone. The bottom belt supports the fabric but allows for shrinkage, while the <b>top</b> <b>belt</b> prevents any stretching. In some cases, the bottom belt can be vibrated for additional mechanical action. Air flow is normally directed down and up through the fabric to give a ripple/wave effect. Once the drying is completed under relaxed condtions, those excessive tensions which have occurred during prior processing, have been released. If the fabric has been spread with overfeed prior to relax drying, width shrinkage occurs first. This may prevent the length from shrinking initially, but as the drying progresses, both width and length shrinkage occurs. At the exit of the relaxation dryer, the fabric width will be inconsistent and may not be completely wrinkle-free. Thus, calendering or compacting is necessary to provide a uniform, finished roll for cut and sew 3. Fabrication If there is any one statement which should provide a quideline for optimum shrinkage control, it is that prouer construction is essential. Without a doubt, too often many fabrics are not constructed properly to meet end-use specifications. In most cases, a particular fabric is made using a certain gauge machine with a specific yarn which should have 5 x 5 shrinkage at a certain weight and width. Once finished, the customer may find that at 5 x 5 shrinkage, the...|$|E

While this meant that under full-load condition the <b>top</b> of the <b>belt</b> approached the water-line, the view was taken that combat with a heavily armed enemy was very unlikely in the immediate vicinity of a British port, and steaming to a more distant potential battleground would use enough fuel to reduce the draught and bring the <b>top</b> of the <b>belt</b> well above water.|$|R
