5|$|Starting {{development}} as an action role-playing sequel to , it retained elements from the Final Fantasy series while having its own story and gameplay elements. The producer of The 4 Heroes of Light, Tomoya Asano, returned to produce Bravely Default. The story's writer was Naotaka Hayashi, who {{was brought in}} from 5pb. due to his work on Steins;Gate. The characters designs were handled by multiple artists, including art director Akihiko Yoshida and Atsushi Ōkubo. The game was influenced by western video games and television series, and individual elements were inspired by aspects of the Dragon Quest series and Higurashi When <b>They</b> <b>Cry.</b> The music, composed by Revo of Sound Horizon, was intended to evoke the feelings of classic series such as Dragon Quest and SaGa.|$|E
25|$|The {{women are}} wonderful. <b>They</b> <b>cry</b> very little and never complain. The very {{magnitude}} of their sufferings, their indignities, loss and anxiety seems to lift them beyond tears… {{only when it}} cuts afresh at them through their children do their feelings flash out.|$|E
25|$|Mahavira: I shall {{describe}} the truly insupportable pains {{where there is}} distress and (the punishment of) evil deeds. Those cruel sinners who, from a desire of (worldly) life, commit bad deeds, will sink into the dreadful hell which is full of dense darkness and great suffering. He who always kills movable and immovable beings {{for the sake of}} his own comfort, who injures them, who takes what is not freely given, who does not learn what is to be practised (viz. control). The impudent sinner, who injures many beings without relenting will go to hell; at the end of his life he will sink to the (place of) darkness; head downwards he comes to the place of torture. The prisoners in hell lose their senses from fright, and do not know in what direction to run. Going to a place like a burning heap of coals on fire, and being burnt <b>they</b> <b>cry</b> horribly; they remain there long, shrieking aloud.|$|E

500|$|The revivers are now immortal {{and heal}} from all wounds. Some of them {{begin to take}} {{physical}} risks or be otherwise careless {{because they do not}} fear harm. When they experience strong negative emotions, <b>they</b> <b>cry</b> blood and become violent. As a result, Dana and Ramin investigate several murders in the weeks following [...] "Revival Day". Meanwhile, some people outside the quarantine area believe the government is covering up a religious miracle. Others believe they can absorb the revivers' immortality by ingesting their flesh, leading to an active smuggling business that moves body parts of revivers and other recently dead individuals.|$|E
500|$|Casey Brienza, Carlo Santos, Carl Kimlinger and Theron Martin at Anime News Network (ANN) {{reviewed}} {{the first episode}} {{as part of a}} [...] "fall 2008 anime preview guide". Brienza called the series [...] "thoroughly enthralling" [...] when at its best, and said that its imagery of death and destruction would be intriguing to viewers interested in apocalypse-themed works. She found the opening and ending themes [...] "bright but boring", and noted that they were at odds with the story. Santos, too, disliked the ending theme, combined with Takumi being an otaku with an imaginary girlfriend, saying that despite being [...] "tongue-in-cheek" [...] it felt too overt and annoying: he felt that Takumi's growing paranoia, the music and the art direction of the graphically violent scenes worked well to set the tone, but that the [...] "fluff" [...] involving Takumi's imaginary girlfriend and his sister disrupted the mood. Kimlinger also noted the inconsistent tone, and called the female characters [...] "painfully artificial". He was not opposed to the combination of the themes of [...] "otaku alienation" [...] and horror, but called the series' horror mystery an uninteresting mix of Higurashi When <b>They</b> <b>Cry</b> and Japanese psychological horror films. Martin called the series a contender for [...] "weirdest" [...] anime of the season, and also compared the tone to that of Higurashi When <b>They</b> <b>Cry.</b> He liked the visuals and music, calling the latter [...] "eerie" [...] and effective.|$|E
500|$|Detailing and {{protesting the}} ugliness {{of life is}} a common theme {{throughout}} the history of Spanish art, from the dwarves of Diego Velázquez to Pablo Picasso's Guernica (1937). Reflecting on The Disasters of War, biographer Margherita Abbruzzese notes that Goya asks that the truth [...] "be seen and... shown to others; including those who have no wish to see it.... And the blind in spirit stay their eyes on the outward aspect of things, then these outward aspects must be twisted and deformed until <b>they</b> <b>cry</b> out what they are trying to say." [...] The series follows a wider European tradition of war art and the examination of the effect of military conflict on civilian life—probably mostly known to Goya via prints. This tradition is reflected especially in Dutch depictions of the Eighty Years' War with Spain, and in the work of 16th-century German artists like Hans Baldung. It is believed Goya owned a copy of a famous set of 18 etchings by Jacques Callot known as Les Grandes Misères de la guerre (1633), which record the devastating impact on Lorraine of LouisXIII's troops during the Thirty Years' War.|$|E

500|$|Coke's {{style and}} {{attitude}} as a barrister are well documented. He was regarded, even during his life, {{as the greatest}} lawyer {{of his time in}} both reputation and monetary success. He was eloquent, effective, forceful, and occasionally overbearing. His most famous arguments can be read in Complete State Trials [...] and [...] Most early lawyers were not noted for their eloquence, with Thomas Elyot writing that [...] " [...] lacked elocution and pronunciation, two of the principal parts of rhetorike", and Roger Ascham saying that [...] "they do best when <b>they</b> <b>cry</b> loudest", describing a court case where an advocate was [...] "roaring like a bull". In court, Coke was insulting to the parties, disrespectful to the judges and [...] "rough, blustering, overbearing"; a rival once wrote to him saying [...] "in your pleadings you were wont to insult over misery and to inveigh bitterly at the persons, which bred you many enemies". Coke was pedantic and technical, something which saw him win many cases as a barrister, but when he became Attorney General [...] "he showed the same qualities in a less pleasing form... He was determined to get a conviction by every means in his power".|$|E
500|$|During development, {{the team}} decided to cater for the core Japanese RPG fanbase, {{as they did}} not believe the game viable for Western release at the time. At the early stages of development, Bravely Default {{was going to be an}} action {{role-playing}} game, a genre Silicon Studios had previously worked on with 3D Dot Game Heroes. After developing a prototype build and putting it before Asano, it was decided to make the battle system a traditional turn-based model. The interdependent [...] "Bravely" [...] and [...] "Default" [...] systems underwent changes during the development process. Initially, Asano envisioned a system similar to the Tension stat used in multiple Dragon Quest games, but designer Kensuke Nakahara wanted something more exciting for players. He was also annoyed that the majority of bosses in both Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy got two or more actions per turn while player characters only got one each. After some consideration, Nakahara decided on a system where characters could bank points by not taking actions during a turn for later use, or create loan points to act multiple times in a current turn. The concept of the Notebook of D, which would offer players deeper insights into the world of Bravely Default, was inspired by a similar system from Higurashi When <b>They</b> <b>Cry.</b> During the late stages of the game's development, the team had to make several last-minute tweaks and changes to ensure the game delivered the best possible performance. Due to the game's chosen mechanics, balancing the game became a major part of later development.|$|E

2500|$|The term [...] "Crocodile tears" [...] (and {{equivalents}} {{in other}} languages) {{refers to a}} false, insincere display of emotion, such as a hypocrite crying fake tears of grief. It is derived from an ancient anecdote that crocodiles weep in order to lure their prey, or that <b>they</b> <b>cry</b> for the victims they are eating, first told in the Bibliotheca by Photios I of Constantinople. The story is repeated in bestiaries such as De bestiis et aliis rebus. This tale was first spread widely in English in {{the stories of the}} Travels of Sir John Mandeville in the 14th century, and appears in several of Shakespeare's plays. In fact, crocodiles can and do generate tears, but they do not actually cry.|$|E
2500|$|Cognitive or {{behavioral}} dysfunction {{is present in}} 30-50% of individuals with ALS. Around half of people with ALS will experience mild changes in cognition and behavior, and 10–15% will show signs of frontotemporal dementia. [...] Repeating phrases or gestures, apathy, and loss of inhibition are frequently reported behavioral features of ALS. Language dysfunction, executive dysfunction, and troubles with social cognition and verbal memory are the most commonly reported cognitive symptoms in ALS; a meta-analysis found no relationship between dysfunction and disease severity. [...] However, cognitive and behavioral dysfunctions {{have been found to}} correlate with reduced survival in people with ALS and increased caregiver burden; this may be due in part to deficits in social cognition. [...] About half the people who have ALS experience emotional lability, in which <b>they</b> <b>cry</b> or laugh for no reason.|$|E

2500|$|... (عاشوراء) : Tenth day of {{the month}} of Muharram. It is the day God saved Moses and the {{children}} of Israel from the Pharaoh. The grandson of Muhammad, Imam Hussayn sacrificed his life along with 72 of his companions on the sand dunes of Karbala. Sunni Scholars recommended to fast during this day. To the Shias, it is also a day on which they mourn the death of the third Shia Imam, Husayn ibn Ali, along with his family and companions, who were killed in the famous battle in Karbala. <b>They</b> <b>cry</b> and weep and organize lamentating programmes where they not only learn how to live a proper Islamic life and improve their Spiritual Self but also cry {{at the end of the}} ritual to show their true love and faith towards imam Hussayn.|$|E
2500|$|Similarly, Rabbi Phinehas, the priest, son of Rabbi Hama, {{interpreted}} God's hardening of Pharaoh's {{heart in}} light of [...] "But they who are godless in heart lay up anger; <b>they</b> <b>cry</b> not for help when He binds them." [...] Rabbi Phinehas taught that if the godless, for whose repentance God waits, do not do so, then later on, {{even when they do}} think of it, God distracts their hearts from penitence. Rabbi Phinehas interpreted the words of [...] "And they who are godless in heart," [...] to teach that those who begin by being godless in heart end up bringing upon themselves God's anger. And Rabbi Phinehas interpreted the words of [...] "They cry not for help when He binds them," [...] to teach that though the godless wish later to return to God and to pray to God, they are no longer able, because God binds them and bars their way. Thus after several plagues, Pharaoh wished to pray to God, but God told Moses in [...] "Before he goes out , stand before Pharaoh." ...|$|E
2500|$|Chapter 6 {{continues}} to intersperse songs amongst the prose. [...] "When old corruption", sung by Quid, is a satire {{on the medical}} profession {{and may have been}} suggested by The Devil Upon Two Sticks (1768), a three-act comedic satire by Samuel Foote, which was itself based on the satirical Alain-René Lesage novel Le Diable boiteux (1707). The Devil Upon Two Sticks had been revived on the London stage in 1784, so it would have been topical at the time of writing. The poem also seems to parody parts of Book II of the John Milton epic Paradise Lost (1667), particularly the scenes outlining the genealogy of the sentries of the Gates of Hell, Sin and Death. Chapter 6 is also an important chapter for Suction, insofar as it is here he outlines his primary philosophy; [...] "Ah hang your reasoning I hate reasoning I do every thing by my feelings." [...] The satire in this section comes from Sipsop's discussion of the surgery of Jack Tearguts, and how his patients react; [...] "Tho <b>they</b> <b>cry</b> ever so he'll Swear at them & keep them down with his fist & tell them that he'll scrape their bones if they don't lie still & be quiet." [...] The inherent but unacknowledged irony here recalls Sigtagatist's proud recollection of Minister Huffcap in Chapter 4.|$|E
