40|$|Tungsten oxide <b>tapered</b> <b>needles</b> with nanotips were {{synthesized}} on a {{large scale}} by reacting tungsten nanopowders with hydrous nickel nitrate in hydrogen atmosphere. The resultant tungsten oxide needles have lengths more than 100 mu m, root diameters of several hundred nanometers and tip diameters of several nanometers, showing a perfectly axisymmetric configuration. HRTEM and SAED analyses showed that the synthesized tungsten oxide <b>tapered</b> <b>needles</b> have a single-crystalline structure with growth direction of [0 1 0]. The effects of the experimental conditions (the ratio between tungsten and hydrous nickel nitrate, the size of tungsten powders, and the reaction atmosphere) on the morphology of the products were systematically investigated. It was found that tungsten oxide nanowires, submicro-/ micro-whiskers and microtubules could be facilely obtained under different experimental conditions. The unique configuration and the single-crystal structure of the <b>tapered</b> <b>needles</b> may make them a potential candidate for field emitters and probing tips. (C) 2007 Elsevier B. V.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of our modifications, which included (1) use of an Alexis wound retractor (Applied Medical) to secure the surgical field through a small incision, and (2) use of a 12 -mm, 1 / 2 R, insert-molded <b>taper</b> <b>needle</b> with 3 - 0 nylon suture to prevent damage to the arytenoid cartilage. Study DesignThis is a retrospective non-randomized observational cross-sectional study. MethodsWe compared the operative time and skin incision length between the conventional fenestration approach and our modified procedure, and verified the improvement of patients' voice by our procedure. ResultsSeven patients underwent the conventional fenestration approach for arytenoid adduction with type I thyroplasty, whereas nine patients underwent our modified fenestration approach for arytenoid adduction with type I thyroplasty. The skin incision length with our modifications (median, 3. 0 [*]cm; interquartile range [IQR], 3. 0 – 4. 0) was significantly shorter than with the conventional procedure (median, 5. 0 [*]cm; IQR, 4. 3 – 5. 8) (P[*]=[*] 0. 001). The operative time with our modifications (median, 95 minutes; IQR, 90 – 100) was significantly shorter than without our modifications (median, 115; IQR, 100 – 130) (P[*]=[*] 0. 035). All patients who underwent our modified fenestration approach for arytenoid adduction had maximum phonation time greater than 11 seconds after surgery.

5000|$|Variable-Venturi: {{in which}} the fuel jet opening is varied by the slide (which {{simultaneously}} alters air flow). In [...] "constant depression" [...] carburetors, this is done by a vacuum operated piston connected to a <b>tapered</b> <b>needle</b> which slides inside the fuel jet. A simpler version exists, most commonly found on small motorcycles and dirt bikes, where the slide and needle is directly controlled by the throttle position. The most common variable Venturi (constant depression) type carburetor is the sidedraft SU carburetor and similar models from Hitachi, Zenith-Stromberg and other makers. The UK location of the SU and Zenith-Stromberg companies helped these carburetors rise {{to a position of}} domination in the UK car market, though such carburetors were also very widely used on Volvos and other non-UK makes. Other similar designs have been used on some European and a few Japanese automobiles. These carburetors are also referred to as [...] "constant velocity" [...] or [...] "constant vacuum" [...] carburetors. An interesting variation was Ford's VV (Variable Venturi) carburetor, which was essentially a fixed Venturi carburetor with one side of the Venturi hinged and movable to give a narrow throat at low rpm and a wider throat at high rpm. This was designed to provide good mixing and airflow over a range of engine speeds, though the VV carburetor proved problematic in service.|$|E

The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the use of blunt tapered and "sharp" needles during abdominal wall closure with respect to the incidence of glove perforation and the convenience of needle handling. A series of 200 patients undergoing laparotomy in a 6 -month period for general surgical disorders were randomized to two groups; in one, the abdominal fascia was closed with a blunt tapered needle; in the other, a sharp needle was used. The main outcome measures were glove perforation and convenience of handling the needle. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. In all, 56 glove perforations occurred during 40 (20 %) surgical procedures. Perforation rates differed significantly: 12 % for the blunt (n = 100) <b>tapered</b> <b>needle</b> and 28 % (n = 100) for the sharp needle (p = 0. 003). Only in 12 cases (21 %) was the glove perforation detected at surgery. The type of needle (odds ratio 0. 35, p = 0. 006) and time taken to close the fascia (odds ratio 1. 001, p = 0. 05) significantly affected the risk of glove perforation. At multivariate logistic regression analysis the type of needle (odds ratio 0. 23, p = 0. 004) and the visual analog linear scale (VAS) for ease of needle handling (odds ratio 1. 18, p = 0. 019) were important predictive factors for glove perforation. With the blunt <b>tapered</b> <b>needle,</b> the VAS was significantly (p = 0. 0003) higher at primary laparotomy than at relaparotomy. Use of the blunt <b>tapered</b> <b>needle</b> reduces the incidence of glove perforation. Laborious closure predicts glove perforation.

30|$|The {{strength}} of the uterine scar after repair depends on correct approximation of the myometrial incision without haematoma formation. The recommendations by some for a two- or three-layer closure require further evaluation. The shift from multiple-layer closure of the uterus after caesarean section to a single-layer approach has been validated by many studies [24, 25]. Though {{this is not the}} same as closure during a myomectomy, the emphasis should be on adequate closure with the optimum number of sutures. More layers do not directly imply better healing. In fact, ischaemia due to excessive sutures may impair healing. We have found the use of Dexon II to be quite suitable for myometrial closure. The 40 -mm, half-circle, <b>tapered</b> round body <b>needle</b> is much sturdier and more surgeon-friendly than those of other commonly used sutures. Two-layer closure is performed only when either the endometrium is opened or the myometrial thickness is greater.|$|R

5000|$|There {{are three}} basic types of {{knitting}} needles (also called [...] "knitting pins"). The {{first and most}} common type consists of two slender, straight sticks tapered to a point at one end, and with a knob {{at the other end}} to prevent stitches from slipping off. Such needles are usually 10 - 16 in long but, due to the compressibility of knitted fabrics, may be used to knit pieces significantly wider. The most important property of needles is their diameter, which ranges from below 2 to 25 mm (roughly 1 inch). The diameter affects the size of stitches, which affects the gauge/tension of the knitting and the elasticity of the fabric. Thus, a simple way to change gauge/tension is to use different needles, which is the basis of uneven knitting. Although the diameter of the knitting needle is often measured in millimeters, there are several measurement systems, particularly those specific to the United States, the United Kingdom and Japan; a conversion table is given at knitting needle. Such knitting needles may be made out of any materials, but the most common materials are metals, wood, bamboo, and plastic. Different materials have different frictions and grip the yarn differently; slick needles such as metallic needles are useful for swift knitting, whereas rougher needles such as bamboo offer more friction and are therefore less prone to dropping stitches.

40|$|Needle trap device (NTD) is a {{technique}} that is useful {{for a wide variety}} of applications involving the sample preparation of compounds with a wide range of chemico-physico properties, and varying volatilities. A newly designed NTD that improves the performance relative to previous NTD designs is simple to produce is developed. The NTD utilizes a side-hole needle with a modified tip to improve the sealing between the NTD and narrow neck liner of the GC injector, thereby increasing the desorption efficiency. The slurry packing method was applied, evaluated, and NTDs prepared by this method were compared to NTDs prepared using the vacuum aspiration method. NTD geometries including blunt tip with a side-hole <b>needle,</b> <b>tapered</b> tip with side-hole <b>needle,</b> dome <b>tapered</b> tip with side-hole, sliding tip with side-hole and blunt tip with no side-hole needle (expanded desorptive flow) were prepared and evaluated. Sampling performance and desorption efficiency were investigated using automated headspace extraction of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, p¬-xylene (BTEX), anthracene and pyrene. The tapered tip and sliding tip NTDs were found to have increased desorption efficiency. SPME and NTDs are valuable sample preparation tools for on-site analysis. Combining both extraction techniques allows for the differentiation of free and particle-bound compounds in a sample matrix. Portable GC/MS instrumentation can achieve fast separation, identification, and quantitation of samples prepared by the above techniques on-site without the need for transport to the laboratory. This minimizes the effects of volatiles lost and sample degradation during storage time. Here, SPME and tapered tip NTDs combined with portable GC/MS are used to investigate free and total emissions of BTEX and select PAHs from gasoline and diesel exhaust.

The challenging accelerator design requirements for the IVA approach include: {ge} 12 -MeV beam energy; {approximately} 60 -ns electrical pulse width; {le} 40 -kA electron beam current; {approximately} 1 -mm diameter e-beam; four pulses on the same axis or {{as close as possible to}} that axis; and an architecture that fits within the existing building envelope. To satisfy these requirements the IVA concepts take a modular approach. The basic idea is built upon a conservative design for eight ferromagnetically isolated 2 -MV cavities that are driven by two 3 to 4 -{Omega} water dielectric pulse forming lines (PFLs) synchronized with laser triggered gas switches. The 100 -{Omega} vacuum magnetically insulated transmission line (MITL) would <b>taper</b> to a <b>needle</b> cathode that produces the electron beam(s).

40|$|Tissue {{engineering}} is an emerging area with an aim to create artificial tissues or organs by employing methods of biology, engineering and material science. In tissue engineering, scaffolds are three-dimensional (3 D) structure made from biomaterials with highly interconnected pore networks or microstructure, {{and are used}} to provide the mechanical and biological cues to guide cell differentiation in order to form desired three-dimensional tissues or functional organs. Hence, tissue scaffold plays {{a critical role in}} tissue engineering. However, fabrication of such scaffolds {{has proven to be a}} challenge task. One important barrier is the inability to fabricate scaffolds with designed pore size and porosity to mimic the microstructure of native tissue. Another issue is the prediction of process-induced cell damage in the cell-involved scaffold fabrication processes. By addressing these key issues involved in the scaffold fabrication, this research work is aimed at developing methods and models to represent the dispensing-based solid free form scaffold fabrication process with and without the presence of living cells. The microstructure of scaffolds, featured by the pore size and porosity, has shown to significantly affect the biological and mechanical properties of formed tissues. As such, during fabrication process the ability to predict and determine scaffold pore size and porosity is of great importance. In the first part of this research, the flow behaviours of the scaffold materials were investigated and a model of the flow rate of material dispensed during the scaffold fabrication was developed. On this basis, the pore size and porosity of the scaffolds fabricated were represented by developing a mathematical model. Scaffold fabrication experiments using colloidal gels with different hydroxylapatite volume fractions were carried out and the results obtained agreed with those from model simulations, indicating the effectiveness of the models developed. The availability of these models makes it possible to control the scaffold fabrication process rigorously, instead of relying upon a trial and error process as previously reported. 	 In the scaffold fabrication process with the presence of living cells, cells are continuously subjected to mechanical forces. If the forces exceed certain level and/or the forces are applied beyond certain time periods, cell damage may result. In the second part of this research, a method to quantify the cell damage in the bio-dispensing process is developed. This method consists of two steps: one step is to establish cell damage models or laws to relate cell damage to the hydrostatic pressure / shear stress that is applied on cells; and the second step is to represent the process-induced forces that cells experience during the bio-dispensing process and then apply the established cell damage law to model the percent cell damage in the process. Based on the developed method, the cell damage percents in the scaffold fabrication processes that employ two types of dispensing <b>needles,</b> i. e., <b>tapered</b> and cylindrical <b>needles,</b> respectively, were investigated and compared. Also, the difference in cell damage under the high and low shear stress conditions was investigated, and a method was developed to establish the cell damage law directly from the bio-dispensing process. To validate the aforementioned methods and models, experiments of fabricating scaffolds incorporating Schwann cells or 3 T 3 fibroblasts were carried out and the percent cell damage were measured and compared with the simulation results. The validated models allow one to determine of the influence of process parameters, such as the air pressure applied to the process and the needle geometry, on cell damage and then optimize these values to preserve cell viability and/or achieve the desired cell distribution within the scaffolds...|$|R
