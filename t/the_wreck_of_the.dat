5|$|Nelson's former flagship, HMS Foudroyant, was moored {{alongside}} North Pier for an exhibition, but slipped {{anchor and}} was wrecked {{on the shore}} in a violent storm on 16 June 1897, damaging part of the jetty. <b>The</b> <b>wreck</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ship broke up during December storms.|$|E
5|$|A naval {{footnote}} in {{the history}} of Lundy was <b>the</b> <b>wreck</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Royal Navy battleship HMS Montagu. Steaming in heavy fog, she ran hard aground near Shutter Rock on the island's southwest corner at about 2:00a.m. on 30 May 1906. Thinking they were aground at Hartland Point on the English mainland, a landing party went ashore for help, only finding out where they were after encountering the lighthouse keeper at the island's north light.|$|E

25|$|In 2011, {{surveyors}} {{conducting a}} detailed preparatory survey <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sea floor for the Neart Na Gaoithe offshore wind farm, published sonar images <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrecks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two submarines, K-4 and K-17 sunk during the accident.|$|R
25|$|Spence states he has {{salvaged}} over $50,000,000 in valuable {{artifacts and}} has been responsible, through his archival research, for <b>the</b> location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrecks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> side-paddle-wheel steamers Republic and Central America from which over one billion dollars in treasure has been recovered.|$|R
5|$|In August 2015, {{members of}} the Dutch sport-diving club Duikteam Zeester dove on <b>the</b> <b>wreck</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mainz and {{retrieved}} a variety of prosaic artifacts, including a sextant and the engine telegraph. Their actions provoked criticism from German sources, who noted that the wreck was a war grave containing the remains of 89 crew members and thus should not be disturbed. The German Federal Police were investigating the incident.|$|E
5|$|On August 3, 2015, divers found <b>the</b> <b>wreck</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> USNS Mission San Miguel (T-AO-129) {{within the}} monument. She had sunk there on October 8, 1957 {{when she ran}} aground on Maro Reef while running at full speed and in ballast. Researchers will map and study the wreck in situ.|$|E
5|$|Prior {{to a new}} hotel {{opening on}} Amity Island, an {{enormous}} great white shark ambushes and kills two divers who are photographing <b>the</b> <b>wreck</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Orca. A couple of days later, their camera is recovered, and the shark goes after a female water skier and speedboat driver, killing the skier, while the driver fends off the shark using a gas tank and flare gun, causing the boat to explode, which kills her and severely burns the shark's face.|$|E
2500|$|<b>The</b> Cowle's <b>wreck</b> is {{protected}} {{for future generations}} of scuba divers by the Whitefish Point Underwater Preserve {{as part of an}} underwater museum. [...] <b>The</b> 1892 <b>wreck</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> steamer Vienna lies to her south and <b>the</b> 1884 <b>wreck</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> steamer John M. Osborn lies to her north. Divers who visit <b>the</b> <b>wreck</b> sites are expected to observe preservation laws and [...] "take nothing but pictures and leave nothing but bubbles".|$|R
50|$|In 1859 Windeyer {{stood for}} the New South Wales Legislative Assembly seat of Paddington and was {{defeated}} by 47 votes. He was, however, returned for the Lower Hunter at the same election. In 1860 he was returned for West Sydney, but afterwards resigned his seat on account <b>of</b> ill-health following <b>the</b> <b>wrecking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> City <b>of</b> Sydney on which he was returning from Melbourne in after winning a rifle match. In 1866 he was again elected for West Sydney defeating Sir John Robertson.|$|R
50|$|Bellamy {{intended}} to loot <b>the</b> <b>wrecks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1715 Spanish treasure fleet, reportedly to impress <b>the</b> family <b>of</b> Mary Hallett, whose Cape Cod family disapproved of her marrying a poor sailor. In Boston he befriended 40-ish Newport silversmith Paulsgrave Williams whose age, wife and children, and well-to-do lineage {{made him an}} unlikely pirate. Together in early 1716 they traveled to the Caribbean with a few dozen treasure-hunters and searched <b>the</b> <b>wrecks</b> unsuccessfully. Despairing, they traded their canoes for small periaguas and turned to piracy.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>wreck</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gouldsboro was {{discovered}} when {{a section of}} riverbank collapsed in 2003 and the Army Corps of Engineers surveyed the area in 2004 to determine how best to stabilize the riverbank. There are no plans to raise the wreck, but the Corps of Engineers will preserve it in place.|$|E
5|$|Animal remains {{have been}} found in <b>the</b> <b>wreck</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mary Rose. These include the skeletons of a rat, a frog and a dog. The dog, a mongrel between {{eighteen}} months and two years in age, was found near the hatch to the ship's carpenter's cabin and is thought to have been brought aboard as a ratter. Nine barrels {{have been found}} to contain bones of cattle, indicating that they contained pieces of beef butchered and stored as ship's rations. In addition, the bones of pigs and fish, stored in baskets, have also been found.|$|E
5|$|During {{the mid-19th}} century the area {{developed}} into a major saw-milling region, supplying the newly developing town of Dunedin with timber shipped from the ports of Waikawa and Fortrose. A -long jetty was built at Fortrose in 1875, although this has long since disappeared. Several shipwrecks occurred along the treacherous coastline during this period. Most notably, one of New Zealand's worst shipping disasters occurred here: <b>the</b> <b>wreck</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> passenger-steamer Tararua, en route from Bluff to Port Chalmers, which foundered off Waipapa Point on 29 April 1881 {{with the loss of}} all but 20 of the 151 people aboard.|$|E
2500|$|Robert Duane Ballard (born June 30, 1942) is {{a retired}} United States Navy officer and a {{professor}} <b>of</b> oceanography at <b>the</b> University <b>of</b> Rhode Island who is most noted {{for his work in}} underwater archaeology: maritime archaeology and archaeology of shipwrecks. He is most known for <b>the</b> discoveries <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrecks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> RMS Titanic in 1985, the battleship Bismarck in 1989, and the aircraft carrier [...] in 1998. He discovered <b>the</b> <b>wreck</b> <b>of</b> John F. Kennedy's PT-109 in 2002 and visited Biuku Gasa and Eroni Kumana, who saved its crew. He leads ocean exploration on E/V Nautilus.|$|R
50|$|Bermuda's {{settlement}} {{began in}} 1609, with <b>the</b> <b>wrecking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flagship <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Virginia Company, the Sea Venture. Although most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{passengers and crew}} ultimately completed their voyage to Virginia, the archipelago was permanently settled from that point, and left in <b>the</b> hands <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Virginia Company. The first intentional settlers arrived in 1612, under the colony's first Governor, Richard Moore. A carpenter by trade, Moore ensured <b>the</b> long-term survival <b>of</b> <b>the</b> colony by concentrating on building fortifications, including the first stone forts in the English New World, and developing St. George's Town.|$|R
50|$|He {{continued}} to write poetry, for children often, but {{was best known}} as a writer of adventure and detective novels for children. Many of these are historical novels based on <b>the</b> exploits <b>of</b> people such as Bartholomew Roberts and Twm Sion Cati. He published well over 50 books in total, including books for adults as well as children. Some of these are non-fiction titles, for example Ofnadwy Nos is an account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrecking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Royal Charter. Some of his books have been translated into English and a number have been adapted for television.|$|R
5|$|El Oriente resumed cargo {{service with}} the Morgan Line, and enjoyed a quiet career, {{typically}} sailing between New York and Galveston. One event of note occurred in February 1922 when El Oriente came upon <b>the</b> <b>wreck</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> schooner, Caldwell H. Colt, which had run aground on a reef near the Tortugas Light during a gale. When El Oriente {{came upon the}} hulk, only her captain remained alive, surviving without food or water for several days before his rescue. El Oriente continued on to Galveston and landed the man there.|$|E
5|$|The {{marriage}} {{was the third}} attempt of Geoffrey's father, Fulk V, Count of Anjou, to build a political alliance with Normandy. He first espoused his daughter, Alice, to William Adelin, Henry I's heir. After William drowned in <b>the</b> <b>wreck</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> White Ship Fulk married another of his daughters, Sibylla, to William Clito, son of Henry I's older brother, Robert Curthose. Henry I had the marriage annulled to avoid strengthening William's rival claim to Normandy. Finally Fulk achieved his goal through the marriage of Geoffrey and Matilda. Fulk then passed his titles to Geoffrey and became King of Jerusalem.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>wreck</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mary Rose was rediscovered in 1971. It {{was raised}} in 1982 by the Mary Rose Trust, {{in one of the}} most complex and {{expensive}} projects in the history of maritime archaeology. The surviving section of the ship and thousands of recovered artefacts are of immeasurable value as a Tudor-era time capsule. The excavation and raising of the Mary Rose was a milestone in the field of maritime archaeology, comparable in complexity and cost only to the raising of the Swedish 17th-century warship Vasa in 1961.|$|E
50|$|After {{assuming}} they had sunk the enemy U-boat, Lydonia and Basilisk proceeded hastily to <b>the</b> <b>wreck</b> <b>of</b> Ingleside. <b>The</b> British and American vessels rescued some survivors {{and took them}} to a friendly port, probably Algiers.|$|R
50|$|Bermuda, {{also known}} as the Somers Isles, lying in the North Atlantic, were accidentally settled by <b>the</b> Virginia Company <b>of</b> London in 1609, due to <b>the</b> <b>wrecking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> company's {{flagship}} Sea Venture; the company's possession was made official in 1612, when St George's, the oldest continually-inhabited, and the first proper, English town in the New World was established; in 1615 its administration passed to the Somers Isles Company, which was formed by the same shareholders; House of Assembly of Bermuda established in 1620; Bermudians' complaints to the Crown led to <b>the</b> revocation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> company's Royal charter in 1684.|$|R
50|$|During World War II, {{anchored}} DOSCO cargo ships, {{along with}} the loading pier at Wabana, were <b>the</b> target <b>of</b> Nazi U-boats {{on at least two}} occasions. During one attack on anchored ore carriers, a torpedo missed its target and struck the pier, making Bell Island one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> few places in North America to suffer a direct enemy attack (see Attacks on North America during World War II). <b>The</b> <b>wrecks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> four cargo ships sunk during these two attacks are visible at low tide; a memorial on shore is dedicated to the 69 merchant sailors who lost their lives.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>wreck</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SS Vina, a cargo steamer {{built in}} 1894, {{can be seen}} at low tide. In 1944, she was {{anchored}} offshore for use as an RAF target when a gale dragged her to her present location and sank her. After the war, some of the wreck was salvaged as scrap. The remains of the Vina are accessible at low tide, but visiting them is potentially hazardous as the wreck is quickly cut off and submerged by the incoming tide. A warning sign on the wreck advises anyone reaching it to return to the beach immediately.|$|E
5|$|As {{the ship}} was {{intended}} {{to function as a}} floating, self-contained community, it was stocked with victuals (food and drink) that could sustain its inhabitants for extended periods of time. The casks used for storage on the Mary Rose have been compared with those from a wreck of a trade vessel from the 1560s and have revealed that they were of better quality, more robust and reliable, an indication that supplies for the Tudor navy were given high priority, and their requirements set a high standard for cask manufacturing at the time. As a miniature society at sea, <b>the</b> <b>wreck</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mary Rose held personal objects belonging to individual crew members. This included clothing, games, various items for spiritual or recreational use, and objects related to mundane everyday tasks such as personal hygiene, fishing, and sewing. The master carpenter's chest, for example, contained a backgammon set, a book, three plates, a sundial, and a tankard, goods suggesting he was relatively wealthy.|$|E
5|$|For {{nine weeks}} Riou and his small crew navigated the Guardian, by now {{little more than}} a raft, across the 400 leagues to the Cape of Good Hope. The Cape of Good Hope was sighted on 21 February 1790, and whalers were {{despatched}} from Table Bay to help the battered ship to safety. Riou ran her aground to prevent her sinking, but a gale struck the coast shortly afterwards, completing <b>the</b> <b>wreck</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Guardian. The voyage was described by J. K. Laughton in the Dictionary of National Biography as 'almost without parallel'. Those who remained with the Guardian were among the few survivors of the accident. Of the boats sent out on 25 December, only the launch with 15 people survived, having been rescued by a French merchant. The launch had witnessed the sinking of the jolly-boat, before losing contact with the two cutters and the long-boat. Riou arranged for the surviving convicts who had helped to save the ship to be pardoned for their good service.|$|E
2500|$|The {{controversy}} surrounding {{artifacts from the}} Superior City continued in 1996 over <b>the</b> ownership <b>of</b> her telegraph. [...] The telegraph was on loan to the Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum. [...] When the owner’s representative, Great Lakes shipwreck diver Steve Harrington, removed the telegraph from the museum, the museum’s director, Tom Farnquist, notified the Michigan State Police who held the telegraph until ownership was determined. [...] Both men admitted that the controversy really stemmed from proposed legislation over <b>the</b> photography <b>of</b> dead bodies in Michigan waters that included <b>the</b> <b>wrecks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Superior City and the SS Edmund Fitzgerald.|$|R
500|$|She {{remained}} with the Grand Fleet until refitted in late 1915, {{when she was}} transferred to the North America and West Indies Station for convoy escort duties. In 1916 she participated in the unsuccessful search for the German commerce raider [...] In late 1917 Drake was torpedoed by a German submarine off Northern Ireland and sank in shallow water with <b>the</b> loss <b>of</b> eighteen lives. <b>The</b> <b>wreck</b> was partly salvaged, beginning in 1920; a fishing trawler collided with <b>the</b> remainder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wreck</b> in 1962 and sank <b>the</b> next day. <b>The</b> <b>wrecks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two ships were demolished during the 1970s, but their remnants remain a popular dive site.|$|R

5|$|In {{the present}} day, Tintin, his dog Snowy, {{and his friends}} Captain Haddock and Professor Calculus follow {{coordinates}} that Sir Francis had left his three sons in a strange riddle hidden in three model ships of the Unicorn. Reaching the coordinates, they discover the island and, upon diving, they find <b>the</b> <b>wreck</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Unicorn. Although they recover various artefacts from it, they do not find the treasure. Back in Belgium, Tintin realises that Sir Francis' message referred, not {{to the location of}} the Unicorn, but to a globe mounted on a statue in Sir Francis' former country home. Understanding now that Francis would never have left the treasure but would have taken it with him to his home, Tintin locates the coordinates to the treasure on the globe, presses a secret button he finds there, and discovers Red Rackham's treasure hidden inside.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many films}} from the silent era, The Carpet from Bagdad was {{believed}} completely lost, but in 1982 an Oceaneering International diving expedition salvaged {{a number of}} artifacts from <b>the</b> <b>wreck</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> RMS Lusitania, including one reel of film. With the assistance of BBC technical advisor Laurie Ward, the BFI National Archive was able to recover images from several feet of the film, sufficient to identify the title, but not to restore any of the film to projectable condition. Although there was a theater on the Lusitania, this print of The Carpet from Bagdad was probably being taken to London as a film distributor's preview, {{as was the case}} for several other films known to have been on board.|$|E
5|$|Pericles {{runs into}} <b>the</b> <b>wreck</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Oberon and Leo runs after him, {{followed}} by General Thade. Thade and Leo fight. Pericles {{tries to help}} Leo, but Thade throws him hard against a wall. Thade takes Leo's gun from him and tries to fire the weapon at Leo. Leo sees that Thade is within the pilot's deck and closes the automatic door, trapping Thade inside. Thade fires the weapon repeatedly at the door but the ricochets create sparks that cause Thade to huddle afraid under a control panel. Leo decides to escape the Planet of the Apes and return to Earth. He gives Pericles to Ari, who promises to look after him. He says goodbye and kisses Ari and Daena. Leo climbs aboard Pericles's undamaged pod and travels back in time through the same electromagnetic storm. Leo crashes in Washington, D.C. on Earth. He looks up at {{what appears to be}} the Lincoln Memorial, only to find that it is now a monument to General Thade. A swarm of police officers, firefighters, and news reporters descend on Leo, all of whom are apes.|$|E

500|$|Evidence <b>of</b> several <b>of</b> <b>the</b> piers remains. The most {{significant}} {{is a large}} circular tower, sited between the canal and river. This had formed <b>the</b> base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> swinging section and housed the steam engine to power it. A large stone arch also remains on <b>the</b> landward side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> canal, the original abutment to the swinging section. Some piers are reduced to the stone foundations and only visible at low tide, as are <b>the</b> <b>wrecks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> petrol barges that caused the original damage. The river at this point has always been hazardous to shipping because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> strong tidal currents, which caused the 1960 collision.|$|R
