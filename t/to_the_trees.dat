5|$|Established clearfelling {{practices}} {{have been shown}} to favour the Pindi moth, and could lead to it being considered a pest due to opportunistic proliferation of the species. The resulting damage caused <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> on which it feeds may be considered significant.|$|E
5|$|Greece: The {{species has}} been {{recorded}} in the Pindus and Rhodopi Mountains of central and northern Greece. Here, M.alcathoe is usually found in stands of plane or alder trees next to small streams in ravines. The bat hunts close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees,</b> within the stand. It is often found together with the lesser horseshoe bat and with M.mystacinus.|$|E
5|$|Mother and I agreed, when {{we talked}} about it, that Dad never meant his poem to apply to one {{particular}} tree, or <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> of any special region. Just any trees or all trees that might be rained on or snowed on, {{and that would be}} suitable nesting places for robins. I guess they'd have to have upward-reaching branches, too, for the line about 'lifting leafy arms to pray.' Rule out weeping willows.|$|E

Then the part that the hunter is moving is set back level and the next part is moved up. This is done until the hunter is at the desired height. In addition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> stand, some hunters use a safety harness to prevent injury in the event that any component of <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> stand fails. You should always be connected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> for safety. <b>To</b> descend <b>the</b> <b>tree,</b> <b>the</b> hunter simply reverses the order of operations <b>to</b> climb <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> - lowering <b>the</b> standing platform, standing on the standing platform, then lowering the sitting platform.|$|R

Logan ends up closer to Keith and Keith clings to Logan dragging him under when <b>the</b> whole <b>tree</b> house collapses and Logan and Keith disappear. Zeus saves Ben.|$|R
5|$|Sam Brown and W. D. Hamilton and Marco Archetti {{proposed}} that autumn leaf colour is {{a signal from}} trees to aphids and other pest species that migrate in autumn <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees.</b> In their theory, bright autumn coloration with pinks and yellows is costly to trees because pigments require energy to synthesize, but the investment may help them to reduce their parasite load.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} {{suggestions}} that leaf shedding {{may be a}} response that provides protection against diseases and certain kinds of pests such as leaf miners and gall forming insects. Other responses such as the change of leaf colors prior to fall have also been suggested as adaptations that may help undermine the camouflage of herbivores. Autumn leaf color has also been suggested {{to act as an}} honest warning signal of defensive commitment towards insect pests that migrate <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> in autumn.|$|E

5|$|The {{site was}} so popular that in 1999 the East Sussex county council made an appeal to Disney as the old wooden bridge had been worn down by an {{overwhelming}} number of visitors. The company provided a substantial donation towards the estimated £30,000 needed to replace the bridge. Partly rebuilt in 1979, the donations from Disney, building firms {{and members of the}} public funded its complete reconstruction. The newly built and modernised bridge retained its precursor's original style. A plaque was also placed to commemorate the occasion and thank those who financially contributed to the project. The sport can still be played in Ashdown Forest to this day and the site regularly attracts tourists from as far afield as the United States and Japan. However, visitors are now advised to bring their own sticks, as previous visitors have caused damage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> in the vicinity.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{other animal}} stories that uses words humans use, the feline {{characters}} of the Warriors series use different words for certain concepts and objects in the natural world. The most common terms found within the books are 'Twolegs' (humans), 'kittypets' (house cats), 'monsters' (cars), 'the Thunderpath' (a road) or 'the horseplace' (a stable). The cats also have their own terms for time and measurement, such as sundown or moonhigh representing different times of day according to {{the positions of the}} moon, sun, and stars overhead. The seasons are given names according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> and foliage in the forest, with 'newleaf' meaning spring, 'greenleaf' meaning summer, 'leaf-fall' meaning autumn, and 'leaf-bare' meaning winter.|$|E
5|$|With the {{darkness}} and fog, Mexican soldiers could not estimate how many men had surrounded them. They withdrew 300 yards (meters) to a nearby bluff. At about 6am, Texians emerged from the trees and began firing at the Mexican soldiers. Lieutenant Gregorio Pérez counterattacked with 40 mounted soldiers. The Texians fell back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> and fired a volley, injuring a Mexican private. According to some accounts, the cannon {{fell out of the}} wagon upon the shot. Unable to safely maneuver among the trees, the Mexican horsemen returned to the bluff.|$|E

5|$|The falling trees downed {{power lines}} and poles, causing power outages and some {{property}} damage due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> and poles hitting houses. One indirect fatality occurred when a motorist drove into a downed tree. Two other vehicles in Franklin County and a fire truck in York were hit and greatly damaged by trees. Downed wires set a Family Dollar on fire in Paradise Township and was believed to have started a fire in a church in Ringtown. Falling trees hit at least eleven houses, with one tree severely damaging a mobile home in Bellwood. Damage directly from the wind was generally minor, and included a house losing a chimney in Camp Hill, a carport being blown over in New Oxford, and at least four houses reporting roof or siding damage. The hurricane also damaged corn fields near Lancaster. Downed trees closed or disrupted traffic on at least 56roads in the region, including U.S. Routes 6 and 322, as well as Interstate 83 in York County.|$|E

25|$|Cocoa trees grow in hot, rainy {{tropical}} {{areas within}} 20° of latitude from the Equator.

25|$|Threats <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> include land-clearing, rodents {{and exotic}} grasses. The {{non-native}} grasses are more aggressive and produce more seed than the native perennials, which attracts seed-eaters like Botta's Pocket Gopher that also feed on acorns and oak seedlings. Restoration includes breaching the levees, allowing floodwaters to scour out the non-native grasses, reduce rodent populations and deposit sediment. With {{the buildup of}} sand and sediments in the flooded areas, studies have shown an increase growth of cottonwoods and willows, which in turn trap more sediments during the next flood cycles.|$|E
