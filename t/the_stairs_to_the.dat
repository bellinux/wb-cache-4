5|$|Momolo {{came home}} to find the {{apartment}} empty apart from Vitta, Marianna's brother (also called Angelo Padovani), the two policemen and Edgardo himself. At about 20:00 the carabinieri arrived, in two carriages—one for Lucidi and his men, and another in which Agostini would drive Edgardo. Lucidi entered the apartment and took Edgardo from his father's arms, prompting the two policemen who had guarded him to shed tears. Momolo followed the police down <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> street, then fainted. Edgardo was passed to Agostini and driven away.|$|E
5|$|The {{upper level}} {{contains}} {{a mix of}} seating options. At one end are eight tables, four to each side, each seating four passengers. In the center is a lounge area with a wet bar and several groups of seats. <b>The</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lower level are located here as well. At the other end are swivel chairs. The lower level contains a bathroom, additional tables, and a snack bar. As built, the lounges had seating for 73. The cars were built with an electric piano in the lower level, which has since been removed.|$|E
5|$|A book {{published}} in November 2011, Seal Target Geronimo, by Chuck Pfarrer, a former SEAL, contradicted the account {{as given by}} U.S. government sources. According to Pfarrer, neither helicopter crashed {{at the beginning of}} the raid. Instead, the SEALs jumped onto the roof from the hovering Razor 1 helicopter and entered a third-floor hallway from the roof terrace. Osama's third wife, Khairah, was in the hallway, headed towards the SEALs. She was blinded by a strobe light and pushed to the floor as the SEALs went past her. Osama bin Laden stuck his head out of a bedroom door, saw the SEALs, and slammed the door closed. At the same time, Osama's son Khalid bin Laden ran up <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> third floor and was killed with two shots.|$|E

50|$|Internally, {{the first}} floor is not unusual. <b>The</b> <b>stair</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> vaults is not {{accessible}} in the present day. Some steps of <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> that led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> second floor are, however, {{to be seen in}} a cupboard in the north-east corner. The second floor was likely one room with plain stone corbels around the walls.|$|R
50|$|Near <b>the</b> <b>stair</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{second floor}} is a wooden settee. The {{staircase}} itself is cantilevered out, {{and consists of}} open stringers with carpet on the steps. It is decorated with a turned newel post and balusters. The round arched window on the east profile lights the landing with 19th-century stained glass.|$|R
5|$|Ellen {{encounters}} her possessed {{friend and}} flees into another room, grabbing knives to protect her. Something attempts {{to enter the}} room where Ellen is hiding, and she blindly lashes out with a knife - mistakenly stabbing Scotty who had just returned to the cabin. While horrified, Ellen is then attacked by the possessed Bruce. Ellen manages to trap Bruce outside, stabbing Bruce's hand {{several times in the}} process. The bleeding Scotty tells Ellen to look into the cellar for the gun they brought along. While walking down <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cellar, she trips on a broken step and injures herself. After finding the gun, she goes back up stairs and discovers that Scotty had been stabbed to death while she was downstairs. The demonic Bruce then attacks her, but she manages to cut off his hand.|$|E
5|$|Hiding {{inside an}} oil field shack while police comb {{the area and}} set up roadblocks, Gil is {{discovered}} by young Suzy who offers to fetch him cookies. Hurrying back to her house, Suzy is caught hoarding cookies by her mother and is forced to reveal who they are for. While her mother calls the police, Suzy slips {{out of the door}} to return to Gil. Her mother chases after her into the oil field, and police cars soon arrive. Realizing Suzy is endangered by being with him, Gil carries the girl out of the shack into the sunlight where he lets her go. He soon transforms into the creature. In the ensuing police chase, Gil slaughters one of the officers and then climbs <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top of a tall natural gas tank, where the remaining officer chases after him. As Gil begins to strangle him, the officer shoots Gil in the neck. Mortally wounded, the mutated Gil falls several stories to his death while Buckell, Hoffman and a sobbing Ann watch in dismay.|$|E
25|$|The {{manor house}} {{is laid out}} symmetrically. It is 33 meters from the foot of <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top of the tower, and 33 meters from the foot of <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> main gate portal.|$|E

25|$|A passage {{beneath a}} one-eyed witch statue by <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Defence Against the Dark Arts classroom, {{leading to the}} cellar of Honeydukes. Speaking aloud the word 'Dissendium' to the witch allows access to this passage; the hump on the statue then opens and reveals the hidden passageway.|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} {{has been}} extensively altered. The first floor is now entirely open, with its original hardwood floor. The bars in the tavern room, including the intricately carved rear one, remains. An original walnut banister is on <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> second floor, where the walls have old posters of vaudeville performers from the late 19th century. The third floor's ballroom remains.|$|E
25|$|Ropes {{had been}} {{suspended}} between {{the legs of}} the tower by the police at Reichelt's request <b>to</b> prevent <b>the</b> crowds from spilling onto the landing zone, and he spent some time discussing the arrangements with the marshals and ensuring that there was sufficient space for his landing before going <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> climb <b>to</b> <b>the</b> first platform.|$|R
50|$|Erected in 1929 <b>to</b> house <b>the</b> Industrial High School, Block R is {{a simple}} rectangular, hip-roofed, three-storey, facebrick {{pavilion}} linked to J Block by a gangway at the ground and first floor levels. Constructed on reinforced concrete piers and beam foundations, the basement floors are of concrete and the upper floors of timber. The planning of the building is altered from the original with workshops and classrooms now partitioned into smaller units. <b>The</b> <b>stair</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west has been removed and vertical circulation for both K and R is now within the inserted link wing.|$|R
50|$|Beyond the {{vestibule}} a door opens {{into a room}} {{at the rear of the}} house which overlooks Cabbage Tree Creek, and from which two small rooms open, one either side, entered via arches, one of which is an early arch. These are the rooms which give access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rear rooms in the side wings. The back room on the western side also has access to an external set of <b>stairs,</b> but <b>the</b> <b>stair</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> room on the eastern side has been removed. Later bathroom extensions at the rear are accessed from these rooms also.|$|R
25|$|Larocque had {{sketched out}} his plans on {{two pieces of}} plywood, which {{are part of the}} church's {{structure}} today, visible on <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cupola. To clear the building for construction and get a building permit, formal blueprints had to be sent to officials with the federal government in Ottawa. Larocque drew some up and sent them, only to have the officials send them back when they were unable to comprehend them.|$|E
25|$|Route 67 is {{a walking}} trail {{consisting}} of 67 public artworks, symbolising 67 years which Nelson ‘Madiba’ Mandela {{dedicated to the}} freedom of South Africa. The artwork is a celebration of South African culture and history and is scattered along the route as it starts from the Campanile, up <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Vuysile Mini Market Square and to the large South African flag at the Donkin Reserve. The artworks were created by local Eastern Cape artists.|$|E
25|$|Frechette, in her {{harboring}} trial testimony, {{said that}} she told Dillinger {{that the police had}} showed up after speaking to Cummings. Upon hearing Van Meter firing at Coulter, Dillinger opened fire through the door with a Thompson submachine gun, sending Cummings scrambling for cover. Dillinger then stepped out and fired another burst at Cummings. Cummings shot back with a revolver, but quickly ran out of ammunition. He hit Dillinger in the left calf with one of his five shots. He then hastily retreated down <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> front entrance. Once Cummings retreated, Dillinger and Frechette hurried down the stairs, exited through the back door and drove away in the Hudson.|$|E

50|$|At {{some point}} in time, <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> leading <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top of the service {{pavilion}} were removed. The structure was clad in mirrors separated by narrow pilasters, and most (but not all) of the spindles removed from the north wall.|$|R
25|$|Inside, the {{vestibule}} {{is flanked by}} small rooms. In the nave, oak pews become curved toward the chancel. There, the dark oak pulpit is raised and flanked by similar balustrades on either side. Behind it is a large pedimented cornice with similar pilasters and columns to the entrance. The organ {{is located in the}} recess. At the rear of the church is a gallery and <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bell tower. The interior is lit with a chandelier over the pulpit and teardrop lights over the congregation. The ceiling is plaster with canted corners. On the side walls there is wainscoting and a molded entablature, with all the large windows having broad molded surrounds.|$|E
25|$|Changing {{the title}} of the {{screenplay}} to La Dolce Vita, Fellini soon clashed with his producer on casting: the director insisted on the relatively unknown Mastroianni while De Laurentiis wanted Paul Newman as a hedge on his investment. Reaching an impasse, De Laurentiis sold the rights to publishing mogul Angelo Rizzoli. Shooting began on 16 March 1959 with Anita Ekberg climbing <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cupola of Saint Peter’s in a mammoth décor constructed at Cinecittà. The statue of Christ flown by helicopter over Rome to Saint Peter's Square was inspired by an actual media event on 1 May 1956, which Fellini had witnessed. The film wrapped August 15 on a deserted beach at Passo Oscuro with a bloated mutant fish designed by Piero Gherardi.|$|E
25|$|He {{took the}} {{elevator}} to the executive reception area on the third floor and, as soon as the doors opened, fired at receptionists Sharon Needy, whom he killed, and Angela Bowman, whom he paralyzed with a shot in the back. Searching for Standard Gravure's President, Michael Shea, and other supervisors and managers of the plant, Wesbecker calmly walked through the hallways, deliberately shooting at people. He killed James Husband and injured Forrest Conrad, Paula Warman and John Stein, a bindery supervisor whom he shot in the head and abdomen. Wesbecker then headed down <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pressroom, where he killed Paul Sallee and wounded Stanley Hatfield and David Sadenfaden, two electricians from Marine Electric who were working on a broken machine.|$|E
50|$|He {{was born}} in Florence, Tuscany, where he studied with Aristodemo Costoli. Masini's most prominently-sited work is the bronze statue of Cola di Rienzi (1877) on the left of <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> leading <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Campidoglio, Rome. Contemporary bronze {{reductions}} of it were made.|$|R

25|$|Legere {{was convicted}} {{in the murder of}} shopkeeper John Glendenning, of Black River Bridge, New Brunswick, which {{occurred}} on the evening of June 21, 1986. After cutting the power, Legere and his accomplices Todd Matchett and Scott Curtis, broke into the elderly couple's store. After repeatedly beating John and his wife Mary, the trio fled the scene. Mary then discovered her husband (who had been beaten to death); she crawled up <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> phone and dialed 911. The dispatcher spoke with Mary on the phone until the emergency forces arrived. Police tracked down the three and arrested them. Matchett pleaded guilty to murdering John Glendenning and brutally beating his wife Mary; Curtis and Legere were convicted at trial.|$|E
25|$|At about 10:30p.m., Powell {{was escorted}} to the Seward {{residence}} on Lafayette Square near the White House by David Herold. Seward {{had been injured}} in a carriage accident on April 5, and suffered a concussion, broken jaw, broken right arm, and many serious bruises. Local newspapers reported that Seward was at home convalescing, so Powell and Herold knew where to find him. Powell was armed with a Whitney revolver and large knife, and wore black pants, a long overcoat, a grey vest, a grey dress coat, and a hat with a wide brim. Herold waited outside, holding Powell's horse. Powell knocked and rang the bell, and the door was answered by William Bell, Seward's African American butler. Holding up a small bottle, Powell claimed that Seward's physician, Dr. T.S. Verdi, had sent some medicine to the house. Bell was suspicious, as Dr. Verdi had departed the home only an hour earlier and left instructions for Seward not to be disturbed. Bell asked Powell to wait, but Powell pushed past him and began mounting <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> second-floor bedrooms.|$|E
25|$|The {{entrance}} is {{situated at the}} back of the Saw Plaza. The exterior queue line consists of mock razor wire fences and various large torture implements rusting on the ground (most of which come from the films). Walkie talkie announcements are heard from policemen inside the building, often sounding as if they are panicking. Loud ambient music is played throughout the area. The queue travels around the back of the warehouse and then into the building itself. Inside, riders walk through a dimly lit corridor, with four shotguns hanging from the ceiling. The guns 'fire' every few minutes to give a jump effect. The corridor leads up some stairs past a cage with a trap (the Rack from Saw III) seen in it. On special occasions, live actors are placed in this cage and act as Jigsaw's victims. Travelling up the stairs, Billy the Puppet can be seen and heard on TV monitors up <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> station. Above the queue, a body is seen tangled in barbed wire (referencing the first Saw), before the queue goes into the station. In here, mannequin parts are fixed in various small devices or hanging from the walls, and misted windows flash on the wall opposite the queue.|$|E

2500|$|The {{frontage}} of {{the station}} was rebuilt in 1875, and was described: [...] "Although the Roman Catholic chapel room is no longer used the station still has a cathedral-like atmosphere as one passes from the period booking hall <b>to</b> <b>the</b> vault-like station and <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> original station area".|$|R
