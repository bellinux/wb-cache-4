6000|$|I really cannot <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>whether</b> {{the journey}} was long or short. As he tramped along he {{suddenly}} {{heard a voice}} saying: 'Vassili! where are you going?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If ye'll let me {{hear the}} question," [...] said Edie, with the caution of a canny Scotchman, [...] "I'll <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>whether</b> I'll answer it or no." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{a man of}} them," [...] said Hatton peremptorily. [...] "Tell me one {{of their}} names, and I will <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>whether</b> they will be made peers." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Simply {{do what he}} <b>tells</b> <b>you,</b> <b>whether</b> it {{is wrong}} or right. If it's right, {{it ought to be}} done, and if it's wrong, it will not be your fault." ...|$|R
5000|$|... 2.c) The three {{remaining}} coins balance. In {{this case}} {{you just need}} to weigh the remaining coin against any of the other 11 coins and this <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> <b>whether</b> it is heavier or lighter.|$|R
5000|$|The model chi-square, 15.404, <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> <b>whether</b> any of {{the three}} Independent Variabls has {{significant}} effects. It is the equivalent of a global F test, i.e. it tests H0: βGPA = βTUCE = βPSI = 0.|$|R
6000|$|... 'These {{shoes were}} quite new when I left Rome,' he said, 'and {{look at them}} now; that will <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>whether</b> you are far from it or not.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{on those}} terms," [...] said Mr. George. [...] "If you {{will tell me}} what the usual ferriage is, I can then <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>whether</b> we wish to go or not." ...|$|E
60|$|ROBERTS. That's right, sir. We {{have another}} God down here; I doubt He is rather {{different}} to Mr. Wilder's. Ask Henry Thomas; he will <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>whether</b> his God and Mr. Wilder's are the same.|$|E
6000|$|... "They are not sharp enough. The last 'bus {{home on a}} wet night <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> <b>whether</b> a {{woman is}} capable of pushing her own way in the world. Tommy's the sort to get left on the kerb." ...|$|R
5000|$|The step chi-square, [...]474, <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> <b>whether</b> {{the effect}} of the {{variable}} that was entered in the final step, TUCE, significantly differs from zero. It is the equivalent of an incremental F test of the parameter, i.e. it tests H0: βTUCE = 0.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not dullness," [...] she smiled. [...] "Exceptional certainly, but as {{something}} {{so different from}} the usual thing, when one talks of nothing but the opera, the theatres and exhibitions, as to deserve to be put down in one's diary by a mark. I won't flatter <b>you</b> by <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>whether</b> a red or a black one." ...|$|R
6000|$|ERNEST. In {{that case}} I {{certainly}} won't <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>whether</b> I {{agree with you}} or not. But I will put another question. You have {{explained to me that}} criticism is a creative art. What future has it? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{will be the}} first,' said Philip, {{stepping}} forward manfully. 'I will prove him for you, lady, and <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>whether</b> he be a cozener or not, or if his magic be fit for you to deal with.' ...|$|E
60|$|But {{it is not}} {{policy to}} bind oneself too closely to detail. A wise friend of mine, who knows his business, {{describes}} his hero invariably in the vaguest terms. He will not even <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>whether</b> the man is tall or short, clean shaven or bearded.|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{now will}} <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> me <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> {{have not heard}} the names of Jael and Miss Van Siever coupled together? I see you know all about it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mamma," [...] {{continued}} Mimmy, after a moment's pause, [...] "won't <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> me <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> {{are fond of}} M. Lacordaire? I'm {{quite sure}} of this,-- that he's very fond of you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was {{all through}} a {{misunderstanding}} that I don't think I {{was to blame}} for, to say the least; but I can't explain it without making Barbara appear perfectly--Mr. Langbourne, will <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> are engaged?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{will not}} do.--This may appease a quiet conscience, like your own, Sir; but we of the {{brigantine}} may not trifle with our mistress. One {{touch of the}} rattan will <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> <b>whether</b> these visits to the Water Witch are likely to prove to your advantage." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well; {{they are}} not. And {{he has nothing}} of his own, as far as I can learn. It would be just the thing for her to do,--to give the money to his friend. At any rate she will <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>whether</b> it was so or not." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{can take}} care of myself," [...] she said, jumping off the chair. [...] "I shall have left this place now in another month, and shall utterly {{disregard}} the words which anyone at your theatre may say of me. I shall not <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>whether</b> the lord has lent me money or not." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A wild tale truly," [...] said Godwin. [...] "But {{did this}} man <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> further <b>whether</b> that lady has chanced {{to come to}} Palestine?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "First of all," [...] I asked, [...] "would <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> me <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> have {{collected}} any {{cases where the}} mesmerist has gained a command over the subject and has used it for evil purposes?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Exactly so. Miss Stanbury will," [...] {{said that}} lady. [...] "Mr. Gibson, I insist upon it, that <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> me <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> did give any such {{authority}} to Miss Camilla French, or to Miss French." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, and it worries me, and I must let it out! I want to {{know what}} I should do. To-day, Edgar Linton has asked me to marry him, and I've given him an answer. Now, before I <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>whether</b> it was a consent or denial, you tell me which it ought to have been.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your sex {{has nothing}} {{whatever}} {{to do with}} it," [...] he interrupted. [...] "As to your appearance, I have not even considered it. I could not <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>whether</b> you are beautiful or ugly--I am no judge of these matters. What I have done, I have done because it pleased me to do it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{never said}} {{my uncle was}} a backbiter. Just to shew you {{what he thinks of}} you, I will <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> <b>whether</b> you want to know or not, that he bid me not mind you because you were only a poor mad creature, sent down here by your family to be out of harm's way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Give me {{a nibble}} and I will try it; then I can <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> better <b>whether</b> it is {{grateful}} to my appetite," [...] returned the Woozy.|$|R
6000|$|McCOMAS. Oh, indeed! Well, sir, let me <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> {{like it or}} not, he is your father, {{and your}} sister' father, and Mrs. Clandon's husband. Now! What have you to say to that! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's curious what a {{difference}} marriage makes in people. Now, I know that I don't look any more like a bachelor of my age than I do like {{the man in the}} moon, and yet I couldn't say where the difference came in, to save me. And it's just so with a woman. The minute you catch sight of her face, there's something in it that <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> <b>whether</b> she's married or not. What do you suppose it is?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>whether</b> {{it is true}} or not, Jessie, for I don't know," [...] {{answered}} the boy, as bravely as he could. [...] "I suppose they'll investigate the matter at Crumville and at that place in Maine, and let me know." [...] He looked at her curiously. [...] "What if they prove I am not the real Dave Porter, Jessie--will you care very much?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Until we get them," [...] Dr. Beddersley said, [...] "I don't {{know that}} we can do anything. But if you can once give me two {{distinct}} photographs of the real man, no matter how much disguised, I could <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>whether</b> they were taken from one person; and, if so, I think I could point out certain details in common which might aid us to go upon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Allurements!" [...] almost {{shouted the}} doctor, and, {{as he did}} so, Lady Arabella stepped back a pace or two, {{retreating}} from the fire which shot out of his eyes. [...] "But the truth is, Lady Arabella, {{you do not know}} my niece. If you will have the goodness to let me understand what it is that you desire I will <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>whether</b> I can comply with your wishes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{may not be}} able to keep it. There's another claimant--this fellow Davies, and he's not a fool. I can't <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> yet <b>whether</b> I'll make a third. It wants {{thinking}} over." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{would not}} eat that, if I were you, for I {{think it is}} poisoned. However, if you will allow me to examine it, I will <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> {{certainly}} <b>whether</b> it is or not." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look here, youngster!" [...] Condor growled. [...] "You {{have come}} in here as a midshipman, and let me <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that <b>whether</b> a fellow is an {{interpreter}} or not we don't allow cheek here." ...|$|R
