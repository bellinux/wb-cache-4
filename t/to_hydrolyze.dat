5|$|Chemically, {{actinium}} {{is similar}} to lanthanum, which is explained by their similar ionic radii and electronic structure. Like lanthanum, actinium has oxidation of +3, but it is less reactive and has more pronounced basic properties. Among other trivalent actinides Ac3+ is least acidic, i.e. has the weakest tendency <b>to</b> <b>hydrolyze</b> in aqueous solutions.|$|E
25|$|ZrCl4 is an {{intermediate}} in {{the conversion of}} zirconium minerals to metallic zirconium by the Kroll process. In nature, zirconium minerals invariably exist as oxides (reflected also by the tendency of all zirconium chlorides <b>to</b> <b>hydrolyze).</b> For their conversion to bulk metal, these refractory oxides are first converted to the tetrachloride, which can be distilled at high temperatures. The purified ZrCl4 can be reduced with Zr metal to produce zirconium(III) chloride.|$|E
25|$|Dimethyl sulfate is {{carcinogenic}} and mutagenic, highly poisonous, corrosive, environmentally hazardous {{and volatile}} (presenting an inhalation hazard). It {{is considered a}} potential chemical weapon. Dimethyl sulfate is absorbed through the skin, mucous membranes, and gastrointestinal tract, and can cause a fatal delayed respiratory tract reaction. An ocular reaction is also common. There is no strong odor or immediate irritation to warn of lethal concentration in the air. The LD50 (acute, oral) is 205mg/kg (rat) and 140mg/kg (mouse), and LC50 (acute) is 45 ppm / 4 hours (rat). The vapor pressure of 65 Pa is sufficiently large to produce a lethal concentration in air by evaporation at 20°C. Delayed toxicity allows potentially fatal exposures to occur prior to development of any warning symptoms. Symptoms may be delayed 6–24 hours. Concentrated solutions of bases (ammonia, alkalis) can be used <b>to</b> <b>hydrolyze</b> minor spills and residues on contaminated equipment, but the reaction may become violent with larger amounts of dimethyl sulfate (see ICSC). Although the compound hydrolyses in water, plain water cannot be assumed <b>to</b> <b>hydrolyze</b> dimethyl sulfate quickly enough for decontamination purposes. The hydrolysis product, monomethyl sulfate, is environmentally hazardous. In water, the compound is ultimately hydrolysed to sulfuric acid and methanol.|$|E

50|$|Aluminum sulfide or {{aluminium}} sulphide is {{a chemical}} compound with the formula Al2S3. This colorless species has an interesting structural chemistry, existing in several forms. The material is sensitive <b>to</b> moisture, <b>hydrolyzing</b> <b>to</b> hydrated aluminium oxides/hydroxides. This can begin when the sulfide {{is exposed to}} the atmosphere. The hydrolysis reaction generates gaseous hydrogen sulfide (H2S).|$|R
25|$|Metachromatic leukodystrophy, {{also known}} as MLD, is a {{recessive}} lysosomal storage disorder. It {{is believed to be}} caused by a deficiency in arylsulfatase A. Arylsulfatase A is a lysosomal sulfatase that is able <b>to</b> <b>hydrolyze</b> the 3-O-sulfogalactosylceramide and 3-O-sulfolactosylceramide. Both 3-O-sulfolactosylceramide and 3-O-sulfogalactosylceramide can be located mainly in the central nervous system {{as well as in the}} peripheral nervous system. When lacking the lysosomal enzyme or mutations in the gene coding for saposin B occur, this can lead to the accumulation of lysosomal sulfatide, which then develops into metachromatic leukodystrophy.|$|E
25|$|In {{a similar}} fashion, sodium {{hydroxide}} {{is used to}} digest tissues, as {{in a process that}} was used with farm animals at one time. This process involved placing a carcass into a sealed chamber, then adding a mixture of sodium hydroxide and water (which breaks the chemical bonds that keep the flesh intact). This eventually turns the body into a liquid with coffee-like appearance, and the only solid that remains are bone hulls, which could be crushed between one's fingertips. Sodium hydroxide is frequently used in the process of decomposing roadkill dumped in landfills by animal disposal contractors. Due to its low cost and availability, it has been used to dispose of corpses by criminals. Italian serial killer Leonarda Cianciulli used this chemical to turn dead bodies into soap. In Mexico, a man who worked for drug cartels admitted disposing of over 300 bodies with it. Sodium hydroxide is a dangerous chemical due to its ability <b>to</b> <b>hydrolyze</b> protein. If a dilute solution is spilled on the skin, burns may result if the area is not washed thoroughly and for several minutes with running water. Splashes in the eye can be more serious and can lead to blindness. This danger is often overlooked.|$|E
500|$|Np(IV) or Np4+ is pale yellow-green in acidic solutions, {{where it}} exists as {{hydrated}} complexes (...) [...] It is quite unstable to hydrolysis in acidic aqueous solutions at pH1 and above, forming NpOH3+. In basic solutions, Np4+ tends <b>to</b> <b>hydrolyze</b> {{to form the}} neutral neptunium(IV) hydroxide (Np(OH)4) and neptunium(IV) oxide (NpO2).|$|E

500|$|Titanium forms {{a variety}} of sulfides, but only TiS2 has {{attracted}} significant interest. It adopts a layered structure and {{was used as a}} cathode in the development of lithium batteries. Because Ti(IV) is a [...] "hard cation", the sulfides of titanium are unstable and tend <b>to</b> <b>hydrolyze</b> to the oxide with release of hydrogen sulfide.|$|E
500|$|TiCl4 is a Lewis acid as implicated by its {{tendency}} <b>to</b> <b>hydrolyze.</b> With {{the ether}} THF, TiCl4 reacts to give yellow crystals of TiCl4(THF)2. With chloride salts, TiCl4 reacts to form sequentially −, 2− (see figure above), and 2−. Interestingly, {{the reaction of}} chloride ions with TiCl4 depends on the counterion. NBu4Cl and TiCl4 gives the pentacoordinate complex NBu4TiCl5, whereas smaller [...] gives (NEt4)2Ti2Cl10. These reactions highlight the influence of electrostatic forces on the structures of compounds with highly ionic bonding.|$|E

5000|$|Some {{clinical}} studies {{report that the}} oral ingestion of hydrolyzed collagen decreases joint pain, those with the most severe symptoms showing the most benefit. Beneficial action is likely due <b>to</b> <b>hydrolyzed</b> collagen accumulation in the cartilage [...] and stimulated production of collagen by the chondrocytes, the cells of cartilage. Several {{studies have shown that}} a daily intake of hydrolyzed collagen increases bone mass density in rats. It seems that hydrolyzed collagen peptides stimulated differentiation and osteoblasts activity- the cells that build bone- over that of osteoclasts (cells that destroy bone).|$|R
30|$|These results {{indicate}} that xylo-polysaccharides have released acetyl groups and <b>hydrolyzed</b> <b>to</b> be some oligosaccharides without any acetyl groups during hot-compressed water treatment at 230  °C/ 10  MPa and/or that some portions of xylo-polysaccharides without acetyl groups were <b>hydrolyzed</b> <b>to</b> be xylo-oligosaccharides. Consequently, xylo-oligosaccharides without any acetyl groups were resulted.|$|R
2500|$|Silicon tetrabromide is the {{inorganic}} compound with the formula SiBr4.

2500|$|Amygdalin is a cyanogenic {{glycoside}} {{derived from the}} aromatic amino acid phenylalanine. Amygdalin and prunasin are very common among plants of the Rosaceae family, particularly the genus Prunus, Poaceae (grasses), Fabaceae (legumes), and in other food plants, including linseed and manioc. [...] Within these plants, amygdalin and the enzymes necessary <b>to</b> <b>hydrolyze</b> them are stored in separate locations {{so that they will}} mix in response to tissue damage. This provides a natural defense system.|$|E
2500|$|Grignard {{reagents}} do {{not typically}} react with organic halides, {{in contrast with}} their high reactivity with other main group halides. [...] In the presence of metal catalysts, however, Grignard reagents participate in C-C coupling reactions. For example, nonylmagnesium bromide reacts with methyl p-chlorobenzoate to give p-nonylbenzoic acid, {{in the presence of}} Tris(acetylacetonato)iron(III) (Fe(acac)3), after workup with NaOH <b>to</b> <b>hydrolyze</b> the ester, shown as follows. Without the Fe(acac)3, the Grignard reagent would attack the ester group over the aryl halide.|$|E
50|$|Carbamate {{groups are}} <b>hydrolyzed</b> <b>to</b> produce phenols and the N-methyl group {{undergoes}} hydroxylation. Sulfur is rapidly oxidized to give ethiofencarb sulfoxide. As stated above, ethiofencarb is stable in acidic conditions, but hydrolyzes {{when in the}} presence of a base. It was found <b>to</b> rapidly <b>hydrolyze</b> at pH conditions of 9 and 12. When subjected to sunlight, the main products that resulted from photodegredation are 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde and 3-methylbenzoe-1,3oxazine-2-4-dione. The main reaction to occur is the precession of ethiofencarb to its sulfide. When in plants, ethiofencarb is close to optimum lipophilicity as the plant breathes. The chemical is metabolized to a sulfoxide, to a sulfone and then <b>hydrolyzed</b> <b>to</b> a phenol sulfoxide and a phenol sulfone.|$|R

50|$|The {{hydrolysis}} of fluorosilanes {{requires more}} forcing reagents, i.e. alkali. The alkoxysilanes (silyl ethers) {{of the type}} R3Si(OR') are slow <b>to</b> <b>hydrolyze.</b> Compared to the silyl ethers, silyl acetates are faster <b>to</b> <b>hydrolyze,</b> with the advantage that the released acetic acid is less aggressive.
