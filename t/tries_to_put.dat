500|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Anthony Mandler, who had previously directed Rihanna videos for [...] "Hate That I Love You" [...] and [...] "Shut Up and Drive". The video was shot in Venice, Los Angeles on April 3, 2008. The video begins with Rihanna {{standing in front of}} a black backdrop for the opening of the song. As the first verse starts, the scene is intercut with another of Rihanna looking out the window at her boyfriend and standing behind the front door as he approaches and asks to come in. As Rihanna walks way from the door singing the lyrics [...] "Don't tell me you're sorry cos you're not", the viewer realizes that her boyfriend has perhaps done something wrong and been unfaithful. During the first chorus and second verse, Rihanna is shown in a different outfit, this time sitting in a silver Porsche in a garage. As Rihanna pulls out of the garage and onto the street, her ex-boyfriend walks alongside the car as she drives and begs her to forgive him; she pulls away. For the bridge, Rihanna is shown sitting on a bed as well as in front of the black backdrops as she reads a text message from her ex-boyfriend, who asks to meet her. During the last chorus, Rihanna appears in a different outfit and walks into a lounge, where she puts some clothes on a table and then sits on a sofa. As her ex-boyfriend walks in, the singer gets up and walks over to the clothes, where she withdraws some matches and strikes one, dropping it on what is made aware to be some of her ex-boyfriend's clothes. As the song comes to and end, Rihanna walks out of the room whilst he <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> out the fire.|$|E

500|$|Zeratul is a Nerazim prelate {{and one of}} {{the main}} Protoss protagonists. The {{character}} is voiced by Jack Ritschel in StarCraft and Brood War, and by Fred Tatasciore in all three parts of StarCraft II. A renowned psionic warrior and assassin, Zeratul is somewhat secretive and calculating, but is nevertheless honorable and loyal to his species. He teaches Tassadar how to use dark templar energies and facilitates the final attack on the Overmind by slaying several cerebrates. Following the death of the Overmind, Zeratul <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> in motion the reunification of the Khalai survivors with the wayward dark templar and unmask the secrets of Samir Duran's experiments. After Duran revealed he had been breeding Protoss-Zerg hybrids for a greater master, Zeratul set out to find Duran's master and his plan, which encompasses all of his activities in the three installments of StarCraft II. [...] In Wings of Liberty, he gives Jim Raynor a crystal with his memories to emphasize the importance of the latter's mission to de-infest Kerrigan. [...] In Heart of the Swarm, he guides Kerrigan to Zerus, the original home of the Zerg, and encourages her to re-infest herself so she can stop Amon, a fallen Xel'naga who is revealed to be the master of Duran and seeks to destroy all life in the Korpulu Sector and remold it in his image. Zeratul will also feature in the events of Legacy of the Void (originally believed to be the central character, the actual protagonist of the story is Artanis). He appears early on but is killed as he severs Artanis's nerve cords to cut him off from Amon's control. [...] He is described by GameSpot as a [...] "dark warrior who champions the light" [...] and a [...] "willing scapegoat" [...] for his people and ranked in their top ten heroes chart.|$|E
500|$|Hamasaki's lyrics, all her own, have {{resonated}} {{among her}} fans, who praise {{them as being}} honest and heartfelt and [...] "expressing determination"; in two surveys conducted by Oricon, respondents voted Hamasaki's lyrics as their favorite aspect of her artistry. Steve McClure of The Japan Times noted that Hamasaki has [...] "developed {{a reputation as a}} thoughtful, introspective lyricist"; Barry Walters of The Village Voice comments that Hamasaki's lyrics [...] "pack unlikely insights". Having [...] "trouble voicing her thoughts", Hamasaki uses her lyrics as an outlet; she draws inspiration from her own (and occasionally her friends') experiences and emotions and <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> them [...] "honestly into words". She has stated that honesty is essential to her lyrics, saying, [...] "If I write when I'm low, it will be a dark song, but I don't care. I want to be honest with myself at all times." [...] This meant that she did not use English lyrics until her album Rainbow, as she felt that she could best express herself in Japanese. As with her musical style, the themes of her lyrics have varied. Her debut album A Song for ×× dealt mostly with themes of [...] "loneliness and confusion", as did her second album Loveppears. Duty likewise expressed feelings of disappointment and confusion. Hamasaki began to take on a more global outlook with her following albums I Am... and Rainbow, branching out to wider themes such as faith and peace. Music critic Tetsu Misaki noted a large change in her lyrics style between her debut album A Song for ×× (1999), which mostly dealt with personal problems, and her following albums Loveppears and Duty. Misaki believed Hamasaki had begun thinking about her influence on society more, and began writing songs with important messages she wanted to express to her listeners. This was signalled by her not using first person pronouns as much, and instead using the words [...] and [...] more often. As Hamasaki matured, her lyrics began to express more confidence; themes in her later albums included love and the struggles of women. With Guilty, Hamasaki began to compose her lyrics not only as an exposition of her personal feelings but as encouragements for her listeners, an outlook she applied in Next Level as well. In songs such as [...] "Talkin' 2 Myself" [...] and [...] "Mirrorcle World", Hamasaki deals with the [...] "awareness and fighting spirit of surviving in a high-risk age" [...] to encourage listeners; in [...] "Rollin'" [...] (from Next Level), Hamasaki writes, [...] "The age is rolling around/At the speed of heading toward the end/Beyond the border/Disappointment and hope fight with each other". In addition to personal experiences and feelings, Hamasaki bases lyrics on sources such as historical events. The life of Joan of Arc was the inspiration for [...] "Free & Easy", while a story told to her by her friend about a saint named Mary served as the basis for [...] "M"; the September 11 attacks inspired [...] "A Song Is Born".|$|E

He even felt attached to the minor characters killed during the massacre. It was so painful for him that he skipped the chapter and continued writing, and only {{when the rest of the}} book was finished, he [...] "forced himself" [...] to come back to the dreaded scene. In 2012, at ComicCon he even joked that [...] "he will visit a country with no television when the episode goes on air".|$|E

However, the spells prove too strong for him and his mind becomes a door into the [...] "Dungeon Dimensions", home to a manner of eldritch creatures. Rincewind and Twoflower manage to kill the now-mutated Trymon, and Rincewind reads all eight of the Octavo's spells aloud. This causes eight moons of the red star to crack open and reveal eight tiny world-turtles that follow their parent A'Tuin on a course away from the star. The Octavo then falls and is eaten by the Luggage.|$|E

2500|$|After several misadventures, and {{escaping}} from Pontius Pilate, Brian {{winds up in}} a line-up of would-be mystics and prophets who harangue the passing crowd in a plaza. Forced {{to come up with}} something plausible in order to blend in and keep the guards off his back, Brian repeats some of what he had heard Jesus say, and quickly attracts a small but intrigued audience. Once the guards have left, Brian <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> the episode behind him, but he has unintentionally inspired a movement. He grows frantic when he finds that some people have started to follow him around, with even the slightest unusual occurrence being hailed as a miracle. Their responses grow in fervour and intensity, making it harder and harder for him to get away from them, yet because of the mob's excitement over the 'miracles' they discover, they ultimately end up completely ignoring Brian himself. [...] Judith is the only one that doesn't leave; Brian and Judith then spend the night together. In the morning, Brian, completely naked, opens the curtains to discover an enormous crowd outside his mother's house which proclaims him to be the Messiah. Brian's mother protests, telling the crowd that [...] "He's not the Messiah, he's a very naughty boy" [...] and, [...] "There's no Messiah in here. There's a mess, all right, but no Messiah." [...] All of her attempts at dispersing the crowd are rebuffed. Furthermore, once Brian addresses them, he also finds that he is unable to change their minds. His followers are completely committed to their belief in Brian's divinity. They immediately seize upon everything he says and does as points of doctrine.|$|E

2500|$|His down-to-earth manner was {{attested to}} by a White House butler who {{recalled}} that, {{on a visit}} in 1979, Philip had engaged him and a fellow butler in a conversation, and poured them drinks. As well as a reputation for bluntness and plain speaking, Philip is noted for occasionally making observations and jokes that have been construed as either funny, or as gaffes: awkward, [...] politically incorrect or even offensive, but sometimes perceived as stereotypical of someone of his age and background. In {{an address to the}} General Dental Council in 1960, he jokingly coined a new word for his blunders: [...] "Dontopedalogy  is  the science of opening your mouth and putting your foot in it, a science which I have practised for a good many years." [...] Later in life he suggested his comments {{may have contributed to the}} perception that he is [...] "a cantankerous old sod". The historian David Starkey has described him as a kind of [...] "HRH Victor Meldrew". For example, in May 1999 British newspapers accused Philip of insulting deaf children at a pop concert in Wales by saying, [...] "No wonder you are deaf listening to this row." [...] Later Philip wrote, [...] "The story is largely invention. It so happens that my mother was quite seriously deaf and I have been Patron of the Royal National Institute for the Deaf for ages, so it's hardly likely that I would do any such thing." [...] When he and the Queen met Stephen Menary, an army cadet blinded by an IRA bomb, and the Queen enquired how much sight he retained, Philip quipped: [...] "Not a lot, judging by the tie he's wearing". Menary later said: [...] "I think he just <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> people at ease by trying to make a joke. I certainly didn't take any offence." [...] During a state visit to the People's Republic of China in 1986, in a private conversation with British students from Xi'an's North West University, Philip joked, [...] "If you stay here much longer, you'll go slit-eyed." [...] The British press reported on the remark as indicative of racial intolerance, but the Chinese authorities were reportedly unconcerned. Chinese students studying in the UK, an official explained, were often told in jest not to stay away too long, lest they go [...] "round-eyed". His comment had no effect on Sino-British relations, but it shaped his own reputation.|$|E
2500|$|Sonnets 153 and 154 use Greek mythology {{to portray}} the roles that the {{individuals}} have within the love triangle. Both sonnets involve Cupid, the god of love, and Diana, the virgin goddess of hunt. In sonnet 153, Cupid falls asleep, a virgin nymph takes the torch from cupid and tries to extinguish the fire but [...] "she only succeeds in turning the water into a boiling fountain". In Sonnet 154, Cupid falls asleep and the torch is taken by the most beautiful nymph who <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> {{it out in a}} nearby well but does not succeed. Drawing from both effects of these actions performed by both nymphs, both sonnets arrive at same conclusion: [...] "Water cannot quench love". In connecting the sonnets to the love triangle, {{there is a sense of}} determination in satisfying ones urges for love for the torch is the phallic symbol according to Levin. No matter how hard these three troubled lovers try to satisfy their urges,their need for love grows stronger. Cupid is the god of love and is in the midst of love just as the young man is in the midst of the love triangle between the poet and the Dark Lady. In sonnet 153, a virgin nymph takes the torch which corresponds to the young man getting engaged to the virgin which [...] "briefly interrupts the cycle of passion and betrayals in the love triangle that the sonnet cycle has traced". The torch still turns the fountain into a boiling fountain and for Levin this portrays the young man's drive to [...] "heat the desire of others". The love triangle will be severed for a certain time and will form again due to the young man's sexual tendencies. In sonnet 154, the most beautiful nymph takes the torch and tries to extinguish the torch in the well and also fails. In sonnet 154,The beautiful nymph is the virgin that will now marry the young man for now [...] "seeing that she can have for herself [...] "that fire" [...] (154.5) that previously she had to share with [...] "many Legions of true hearts" [...] (154.6), seizes [...] "advantage" [...] (153.2) by picking up the young man's brand and quenching it in [...] "the could vallie-fountain of that ground"—that is, in her virgin vagina”. There is still a small possibility that the young man will commit adultery but Levin states that this is also related to Hymen, the God of love. The act of setting the torch in the well indicates that the young man will settle with virgins propositions that is [...] "suggested by her vow, which was to [...] "keep" [...] not maidenhood but [...] "chast life" [...] (154.3)".|$|E
