She tells Sawyer that she knows <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> <b>was</b> written when Sawyer was a kid, and also works out that the letter wasn't written to Sawyer, but by him. He tells Kate that his real name isn't Sawyer and that <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> <b>was</b> written to the real Sawyer, a con man, who ruined his family. He ended up {{becoming}} a con man himself, so he took the name Sawyer as an alias. He snatches the letter from Kate and tells her not {{to feel sorry for}} him and to leave.|$|E

5|$|During the {{campaign}} Shelby's political enemies, notably Humphrey Marshall, criticized {{his response to}} Jefferson's second letter regarding the Genêt affair and questioned his loyalty to the United States. Shelby contended that his noncommittal response to <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> <b>was</b> meant to draw the federal government's attention {{to the situation in}} the west. He cited the agreement between Washington and the Spanish as evidence that his ploy had worked. He also claimed to have known at the time he wrote the letter that the French scheme was destined to fail.|$|E
5|$|Hermano Pule {{immediately}} sent {{a letter}} to Archbishop José Seguí in Manila rebuking the acts of the Tayabas friars, and accusing them of beatings and threatening the excommunication of cofradía members. He also challenged the friars' authority to do such acts because the aims of the cofradía were never against the Catholic faith. On January 29, 1841, Pule {{sent a letter}} to the Bishop of Nueva Cáceres restating that the cofradía was not against canon law. <b>The</b> <b>letter</b> <b>was</b> forwarded to the juez provisor of the bishopric, who then endorsed it to Fr. Antonio Mateo and Fr. Manuel Sancho, who rejected Pule's petition.|$|E
5|$|His unmailed {{letter was}} found {{by one of his}} staff and {{circulated}} among workers at the Anemia Commission. When Rhoads learned of this, he quickly made a public apology at a meeting of all staff and doctors.

With relations having deteriorated locally, he returned to New York in December 1931.|$|E

5|$|In 2002, the {{controversy}} was revived. Alerted to the incident, American Association for Cancer Research (AACR), which had established the Cornelius P. Rhoads Memorial Award in 1979, commissioned a new investigation. It {{was led by}} Jay Katz, emeritus professor at Yale Law School and a specialist in medical ethics. He concluded {{there was no evidence}} of unethical human experimentation, but <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> <b>was</b> so offensive that the prize should be renamed. AACR concurred and stripped the honor from Rhoads because of his racism.|$|E
5|$|In 2015 Hewson {{signed an}} open letter which the ONE Campaign had been {{collecting}} signatures for; <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> <b>was</b> addressed to Angela Merkel and Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, urging them to focus on women as they serve {{as the head of}} the G7 in Germany and the AU in South Africa respectively, which will start to set the priorities in development funding before a main UN summit in September 2015 that will establish new development goals for the generation.|$|E
5|$|In August 2015 the Australian Federal Court {{refused the}} {{application}} for film makers of Dallas Buyers Club to force ISPs {{to hand over}} the details of their customers.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>letter</b> <b>is</b> in a crude {{cuneiform}} style, but {{in nearly}} perfect condition (few lacunas).

50|$|<b>The</b> uncial <b>letters</b> <b>are</b> large, broad, attractive, {{and very}} precise. <b>The</b> <b>letters</b> <b>are</b> larger than in codices Alexandrinus and Vaticanus, but smaller than in Codex Petropolitanus Purpureus.|$|R
5|$|The French chemist Antoine Laurent Lavoisier later {{claimed to}} have {{discovered}} the new substance independently. Priestley visited Lavoisier in October 1774 and told him about his experiment and how he liberated the new gas. Scheele also posted a letter to Lavoisier on September 30, 1774 that described his discovery of the previously unknown substance, but Lavoisier never acknowledged receiving it (a copy of <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> <b>was</b> found in Scheele's belongings after his death).|$|E

5|$|The {{story was}} {{told in the}} form of a letter from a wife and mother to her husband. The writer, Hester Hyman, had written the letter to explain why she had decided to {{sacrifice}} her life for the cause of democracy. While the text of <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> <b>was</b> shown in captions, the pictures first illustrated events described in the early part of the letter, and then showed the circumstances of her death at the hands of a squad of judges led by Judge Dredd.|$|E

50|$|KHKZ {{started off}} as country KTEX 106 (KTXF). Then in 1983 changed calls to KGAR and format to Hot AC. In 1989 <b>the</b> callsign <b>letters</b> <b>were</b> changed to KBOR-FM. Then again in 1992 <b>the</b> callsign <b>letters</b> <b>were</b> changed to KTJN. In 2003 <b>the</b> callsign <b>letters</b> <b>were</b> changed to KMAZ.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>letters</b> <b>are</b> {{small and}} upright. <b>The</b> <b>letters</b> <b>are</b> regular and well-formed. They {{do not look}} like {{experimental}} ones in character.

5|$|After the Texas Revolution ended, the {{original}} draft of <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> <b>was</b> given to Travis's family in Alabama. Several prominent Texians {{are known to}} have visited Travis's estranged wife shortly after the hostilities ended, but historians are unsure which of these men might have delivered the letter. Travis's daughter Susan (aged five {{at the time of his}} death) passed the letter down to her descendants; it eventually reached her great-grandson, John G. Davidson. In February 1891, Davidson lent the letter to the Texas Department of Agriculture, Insurance, Statistics, and History. Two years later, Davidson offered to sell the letter to the state of Texas for $250 ($ today). This represented half of the annual sum allocated for collecting historical manuscripts, and the state was hesitant to agree. After negotiations, Davidson agreed to accept $85 ($ today) for the letter, and on May 29 it officially passed into state ownership.|$|E
5|$|As {{the story}} begins, {{a woman named}} Emmy Altava is hired to be Professor Layton's {{assistant}} at the fictional Gressenheller University. Upon her introduction to him, he reveals that he is currently heading towards a town named Misthallery. According to a letter allegedly sent by his close friend, Clark Triton, a specter is attacking the village at night. As the pair reach Clark's house, though, they find that <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> <b>was</b> sent not by Clark, but by his son, Luke, who has learned how to predict the specter's attacks and wished to enlist Layton's help in {{putting an end to}} them. Luke sneaks out of his house to join Layton and Emmy's investigation. After they finish exploring Misthallery for the day, they go to spend the night at a local hotel. As they look out from the window in their room, they hear the sound of a flute and see a large, shadowy figure emerge from the mist, which proceeds to forge a path of destruction through the town, including their hotel room, before vanishing without a trace.|$|E
5|$|Chilembwe {{also sought}} {{support for his}} {{uprising}} from the German forces in German East Africa, on Nyasaland's far northern border, hoping that a German offensive from the north combined with a native insurrection in the south might force the British out of Nyasaland permanently. On 24 January, he {{sent a letter to}} the German Governor by courier through Portuguese East Africa. The courier was intercepted and <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> <b>was</b> never received. During the latter stages of the East African Campaign, after the German invasion of Portuguese East Africa, the German colonial army actually helped to suppress anti-Portuguese rebellions, among the Makombe and Barue peoples, worrying that African uprisings would destabilise the colonial order.|$|E
5000|$|The date mark <b>is</b> a <b>letter</b> {{indicating}} <b>the</b> exact year {{in which}} the piece was made.

2500|$|In modern Hebrew, <b>the</b> <b>letter's</b> name <b>is</b> Tsadi or Ṣadi, {{depending}} on whether <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> <b>is</b> transliterated as <b>the</b> common [...] "ts" [...] or the more scientific [...] "ṣ".|$|R
50|$|The {{lyrics of}} the song tell a fictional story about seeing death in a car {{accident}} and being told in first person. <b>The</b> <b>letter</b> itself <b>is</b> a fallacy; because its author explained that <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> <b>is</b> fictional, although I dedicate it to a cousin, who died in a traffic accident. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> <b>is</b> put in <b>the</b> place of the victim and the feelings you may have felt to experience death.|$|R
