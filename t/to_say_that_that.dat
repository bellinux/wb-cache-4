500|$|The British Commonwealth Secretary George Thomson {{expressed}} outrage, accusing Beadle and {{the other}} judges of breaching [...] "the fundamental laws of the land", while Gibbs stated that since his position as Governor existed under the 1961 constitution he could only reject the ruling. An internal UK Foreign Office memorandum rejected Beadle's argument but recognised his belief that [...] "because {{of the effect of}} the effluxion of time, he was entitled to take a different view", and concluded that the Chief Justice's argument was [...] "sufficiently plausible to make it difficult <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> position is manifestly improper or that, in adopting it, Sir Hugh Beadle is manifestly guilty of misconduct." [...] Beadle explained in a 1972 interview: [...] "We had been doing our best to try and uphold the law and when the thing was in the revolutionary stage we dug our toes in, we wouldn't budge. But then as the government became more and more entrenched we had to apply the principle of law, which says that if a revolution succeeds the law changes with it. Yet because we accepted the inevitable we're blamed {{by a lot of people}} for being responsible for the revolution, which is a very different thing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear, dear!" [...] said Alexander. [...] "You {{really mean}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> upsets him? Well, I'm afraid I am {{too old to}} change my methods now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; she is {{the wife}} of Fragoso. You do not mean <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> lad is the {{commander}} of the galley? Why, he looks the youngest of you all." ...|$|E
60|$|W. (Aside.) Hang it, I {{was going}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that!</b> <b>That's</b> {{one of the}} noblest things in the book.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, no,' whispered John Pitcher. ''Tisn't {{our side}} ought <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that.</b> <b>That's</b> the {{doctrine}} of vagabonds like him, and we {{be on the side}} of the law.' ...|$|R
5000|$|I'd like {{somebody}} to mention <b>that</b> day <b>that</b> Martin Luther King Jr. {{tried to give}} his life serving others. I'd like for somebody <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> day <b>that</b> Martin Luther King Jr. tried to love somebody.I want you <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> day <b>that</b> I tried to be right on the war question. I want you <b>to</b> be able <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> day <b>that</b> I did try to feed the hungry. I want you <b>to</b> be able <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> day <b>that</b> I did try {{in my life to}} clothe those who were naked. I want you <b>to</b> <b>say</b> on <b>that</b> day <b>that</b> I did try in my life to visit those who were in prison. And I want you <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> I tried <b>to</b> love and serve humanity.Yes, if you want <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> I was a drum major. <b>Say</b> <b>that</b> I was a drum major for justice. <b>Say</b> <b>that</b> I was a drum major for peace. I was a drum major for righteousness. And all of the other shallow things will not matter. I won't have any money to leave behind. I won't have the fine and luxurious things of life to leave behind. But I just want to leave a committed life behind.|$|R
6000|$|... "If a {{man comes}} prying into a person's room at midnight when {{that person is}} half-naked, will you be so unjust as <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> person is showing himself to that man?" ...|$|E
60|$|He {{was very}} decent <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that.</b> <b>That</b> was all {{to make him}} laugh. But he could not laugh because his cheeks and lips were all shivery: and then the prefect had to laugh by himself.|$|E
6000|$|... "Allow me <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> is a {{point on}} which I cannot admit a doubt. She is a princess to me, and just at present I must be {{regarded}} as the only judge in the matter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There now!" [...] exclaimed Maria Port, {{springing}} to her feet. [...] "What {{have you}} got <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>that?</b> If <b>that</b> isn't brazen I never saw brass!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If I'm to go coastin' at all," [...] said Mrs. Aleshine, [...] "I'd as lief do it {{with strangers}} as friends; and a little liefer, for <b>that</b> matter, if there's any bones to be broken. But I must <b>say</b> <b>that</b> I'd like <b>to</b> make the {{acquaintance}} of them ladies afore I git on to the sled, which"--at <b>that</b> moment catching sight of the mattress--"you don't mean <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>that's</b> it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What!" [...] {{the captain}} said, incredulously, [...] "do you mean <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that,</b> with <b>that</b> little ten-gun craft, you {{captured}} a thirty-six-gun frigate single-handed?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No {{excitement}} {{in a young}} man's coming into the house! Without shocking your propriety, allow me <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> is impossible. Of course, he is coming to see whether he can't make matters all right by marrying you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Land of love!" [...] exclaimed Mrs. Brown, jumping {{back and}} {{clutching}} her skirts {{in both hands}} as if she expected Unc' Billy would try to take refuge behind them. [...] "Do you mean <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> Possum is alive?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is a great}} mystery. Had you not {{met them}} after the fall over the bluff I would be {{inclined}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> fall must have been accidental. But, as it is, it was premeditated, beyond a doubt. And you are certain that you never met the men before?" ...|$|E
2500|$|For the former, {{tradition}} is <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> for <b>that</b> child we ask [...] "Why?" [...] and, like the simple child, {{we have no}} answer.|$|R
6000|$|His {{answer was}} a {{sinister}} [...] "No fear," [...] {{as much as}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> even <b>that</b> way of escape from inclement fortune was closed to him.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is rather}} like my handwriting," [...] she admitted, [...] "and {{as for the}} signature, do you mean <b>to</b> <b>say</b> really <b>that</b> <b>that</b> is not yours?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And do {{you mean}} to say," [...] said Robinson--"{{do you mean}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> is now your wish?" [...] And he looked at her till the audacity even of her eyes sank beneath the earnestness of his own. But though for the moment he quelled her eye, nothing could quell her voice.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{doubt it}} not," [...] said I, {{thinking}} that if his imagination were as fertile in that connection {{as it had been}} in mine he was likely, indeed, to have some amazing things to tell. [...] "But do I understand you <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> was the time of the scandal you have touched upon?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "One {{moment before}} you go, Miss Nevil. If {{this is the}} result of any {{misunderstanding}} as to the presence of another woman here, in company with Mr. Somers, it is only fair to him <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> woman is here as a friend of MINE, not of his, and I alone am responsible." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How {{would it}} be if you and I were going without anybody else? Do you mean <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> in <b>that</b> case we might not sit in the same carriage?" ...|$|R
50|$|In the book, for example, Kingsley argues <b>that</b> {{no person}} is {{qualified}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> something <b>that</b> {{they have never}} seen (like a human soul or a water baby) does not exist.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, I {{was merely}} going <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> in <b>that</b> case I {{should never have}} given myself the {{pleasure}} of proposing to you, since your freedom from <b>that</b> experience was your attraction, darling.' ...|$|R
60|$|He made {{no reply}} to this for {{he could think}} of no reply that was {{sufficiently}} polite. 'Yes?' sounded as if he meant <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> was just what he had expected. 'Really?' had a sarcastic ring. He fell back on facial expression, to imply that he was interested and that she might tell all.|$|E
60|$|But here he paused. It {{had been}} his {{intention}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> very man, the first husband of this loved mother now looked upon as dead for so many years, this miscreant of whom he had spoken--that this man had been in that room that very day. But he hardly knew how to frame the words.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] quoth the hermit, [...] "God {{knows that}} all we who live upon His earth may easily do ill in His sight; yet I dare <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> yonder knight hath done as little ill as any of us. Sir, you must {{know that he is}} none other than Sir Launcelot of the Lake." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I mean <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> in <b>that</b> case I {{should not}} go at all. It isn't done in England. You {{have been in the}} States so long <b>that</b> you forget all our old-fashioned ways." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{was not to}} be propitiated by a show of {{interest}} in his health. His answer was a sinister [...] "No fear," [...] as much as <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> even <b>that</b> way of escape from inclement fortune was closed to him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why you see, old chap," [...] said Joe, {{in a tone}} of remonstrance, and by way {{of getting}} at it by degrees, [...] "I wouldn't go so far as <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that,</b> for <b>that's</b> a deal to say; but she ain't--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes;--and he {{will pay}} the rent; and we shall be a drag upon him, {{as though he had}} been fool enough to have a wife and a family of his own. And what good have we done? We had not {{strength}} enough <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> wicked man should not see her when he came;--for he is a wicked man." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>To</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> {{moment was}} a turning point in my life would be to use a ridiculously {{inadequate}} phrase. It dynamited my life. In a sense it killed me. The man I had been died that night, regretted, I imagine, by few. Whatever I am today, I am certainly not the complacent spectator of life that I had been before that night.|$|E
6000|$|... "That I won't; my men are men. I've {{been out}} to your miserable barracks and watched them eat. Faugh! Potatoes! Nothing but potatoes! No salt! Nothing! Only potatoes! I may have been mistaken, but I thought I {{understood}} them <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> was all they ever got to eat. Two meals a day and {{every day in the}} week?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I don't mean <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> even <b>that</b> {{kind of girl}} won't get on, if {{she gives}} her mind to it; but I think I should prefer a little less plain-mindedness, as you call it, if I were a man." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look here," [...] he said, facing Mrs. Conroy in a hard, matter-of-fact way, [...] "do {{you mean}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> what <b>that</b> man--your husband--said, was true? <b>That</b> he knows nothing of you; of the {{circumstances}} under which you came here?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Twere {{as honest}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> he <b>that</b> was trait'rous to his king was trait'rous to his country," [...] said Mistress Thankful with sudden audacity, bending her knit brows on Lady Washington. But <b>that</b> lady turned dignifiedly away, and Mistress Thankful again faced the general.|$|R
