5|$|Amanda Carter (born 16 July 1964) is an Australian Paralympic {{wheelchair}} basketball player. Diagnosed with <b>transverse</b> <b>myelitis</b> {{at the age}} of 24, {{she began}} playing wheelchair basketball in 1991 and participated in the Australia women's national wheelchair basketball team, the Gliders, at three Paralympics from 1992 to 2000. An injury in 2000 forced her to withdraw from the sport, but she came back to the national team in 2009, and {{was a member of the}} team that represented Australia and won silver at the 2012 London Paralympics.|$|E
5|$|Carter {{was born}} on 16 July 1964 in Heidelberg, Victoria. She spent her {{childhood}} living in the Melbourne suburb of Heidelberg West. She went to Olympic Village Primary School, attended years 7 to 10 at Latrobe High School and years 11 and 12 at Thornbury High School. She then entered LaTrobe University, where she obtained Bachelor of Applied Science and Master of Occupational Therapy degrees. As a youngster, she played netball. In 1989, {{at the age of}} 24, she was diagnosed with <b>transverse</b> <b>myelitis</b> after a bout of chicken pox. She works as an occupational therapist and has a son, Alex. , she still lives in Heidelberg West.|$|E

25|$|Whether Devic's {{disease is}} a {{distinct}} disease {{or part of the}} wide spectrum of multiple sclerosis is debated. Devic's disease differs in that it usually has more severe sequelae after an acute episode than standard MS, MS infrequently presents as <b>transverse</b> <b>myelitis,</b> and oligoclonal bands in the CSF, as well as white matter lesions on brain MRI, are uncommon in Devic's disease, but occur in over 90% of MS patients.|$|E
25|$|Central {{nervous system}} lesions occur occasionally. Cerebral granulomatous disease {{may be caused}} by S. japonicum eggs in the brain. Communities in China {{affected}} by S. japonicum have been found to have rates of seizures eight times higher than baseline. Similarly, granulomatous lesions from S. mansoni and S. haematobium eggs in the spinal cord can lead to <b>transverse</b> <b>myelitis</b> with flaccid paraplegia. Eggs are thought to travel to the central nervous system via embolization.|$|E
25|$|This ruling {{held that}} tetanus vaccine caused a {{particular}} case of optic neuritis even though no scientific evidence supported the petitioner's claim. Other rulings have allowed petitioners to gain awards for claims that the MMR vaccine causes fibromyalgia, that the Hib vaccine causes <b>transverse</b> <b>myelitis,</b> and that the hepatitis B vaccine causes Guillain–Barré syndrome, chronic demyelinating polyneuropathy, and multiple sclerosis. In the most extreme of these cases, a 2006 petitioner successfully claimed that a hepatitis B vaccine caused her multiple sclerosis despite several studies showing that the vaccine neither causes nor worsens the disease, and despite a conclusion by the Institute of Medicine that evidence favors rejection of a causal relationship.|$|E
2500|$|The {{disease can}} be monophasic, i.e. a single episode with {{permanent}} remission. [...] However, at least 85% of patients have a relapsing {{form of the}} disease with repeated attacks of <b>transverse</b> <b>myelitis</b> and/or optic neuritis. In patients with the monophasic form, the <b>transverse</b> <b>myelitis</b> and optic neuritis occur simultaneously or within days of each other. [...] On the other hand, patients with the relapsing form {{are more likely to}} have weeks or months between the initial attacks, and to have better motor recovery after the initial <b>transverse</b> <b>myelitis</b> event. Relapses usually occur early, with about 55% of patients having a relapse in the first year and 90% in the first five years.|$|E
2500|$|The {{disease is}} characterised by {{bilateral}} diffuse uveitis, with pain, redness and blurring of vision. The eye symptoms may {{be accompanied by}} a varying constellation of systemic symptoms, such as auditory (tinnitus, vertigo, and hypoacusis), neurological (meningismus, with malaise, fever, headache, nausea, abdominal pain, stiffness of the neck and back, or a combination of these factors; meningitis, CSF pleocytosis, cranial nerve palsies, hemiparesis, <b>transverse</b> <b>myelitis</b> and ciliary ganglionitis), and cutaneous manifestations, including [...] poliosis, vitiligo, and alopecia. The vitiligo often is found at the sacral region.|$|E
2500|$|Approximately 20% of {{patients}} with monophasic Devic's disease have permanent visual loss, and 30% have permanent paralysis in one or both legs. [...] Among patients with relapsing Devic's disease, 50% have paralysis or blindness within five years. [...] In some patients (33% in one study), <b>transverse</b> <b>myelitis</b> in the cervical spinal cord resulted in respiratory failure and subsequent death. [...] However, the spectrum of Devic's disease has widened due to improved diagnostic criteria, and the options for treatment have improved; as a result, researchers believe these estimates will be lowered.|$|E
2500|$|Adverse reactions, rarely serious, {{may occur}} from each {{component}} of the MMR vaccine. Ten percent of children develop fever, malaise, and a rash 5–21 days after the first vaccination; and 3% develop joint pain lasting 18 days on average. Older women {{appear to be more}} at risk of joint pain, acute arthritis, and even (rarely) chronic arthritis. Anaphylaxis is an extremely rare but serious allergic reaction to the vaccine. One cause can be egg allergy. In 2014, the FDA approved two additional possible adverse events on the vaccination label for acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), and <b>transverse</b> <b>myelitis,</b> with permission to also add [...] "difficulty walking" [...] to the package inserts. A 2012 IOM report found that the measles {{component of the}} MMR vaccine can cause measles inclusion body encephalitis in immunocompromised individuals.

5000|$|<b>Transverse</b> <b>myelitis</b> is a {{heterogeneous}} condition, that is, {{there are several}} identified causes. Sometimes the term <b>Transverse</b> <b>myelitis</b> spectrum disorders is used. It is rare for the condition to have no identifiable cause (called [...] "idiopathic").|$|E

50|$|<b>Transverse</b> <b>myelitis</b> is a {{neurological}} {{condition in which}} the spinal cord is inflamed. The inflammation damages nerve fibers, and causes them to lose their myelin coating leading to decreased electrical conductivity in the central nervous system. Transverse implies that the inflammation extends across the entire width of the spinal cord.
