40|$|Temperatures in the {{tropical}} tropopause layer (TTL) {{play an important role}} in stratosphere–troposphere exchange and in the formation and maintenance of thin cirrus clouds. Many previous studies have examined the contributions of extratropical and equatorial waves to the TTL using coarse-vertical-resolution satellite and reanalysis data. In this study, the authors provide new insight into the role of extratropical and equatorial waves in the TTL using high-vertical-resolution GPS radio occultation data. The results examine the influence of four different wave forcings on the TTL: extratropical waves that propagate vertically into the stratosphere, extratropical waves that propagate meridionally into the subtropical stratosphere, extratropical waves that propagate meridionally into the subtropical troposphere, and the equatorial planetary waves. The vertically and meridionally propagating extratropical stratospheric waves are associated with deep, zonally symmetric temperature anomalies that extend and amplify with height throughout the lower-to-middle tropical stratosphere. In contrast, the extratropical <b>tropospheric</b> <b>waves</b> and the equatorial planetary waves are associated with tropical temperature anomalies that are confined below 20 -km altitude. The equatorial planetary waves dominate the zonally asymmetric component of the TTL temperature field, and both the equatorial planetary waves and the extratropical <b>tropospheric</b> <b>waves</b> are linked to large temperature variability in a 1 – 2 -km-deep layer near {{the tropical}} tropopause. The fine vertical scale of the TTL temperature features associated with the equatorial planetary waves and the extratropical <b>tropospheric</b> <b>waves</b> is only readily apparent in high-vertical-resolution data...|$|R

The consistency between the two sets of data provides observational support for the hypothesis that shear instability in the upper tropospheric flow is the mechanism responsible for the generation of such waves. The comparison presented suggests that microbarograph arrays might be useful adjuncts to future radar studies of upper <b>tropospheric</b> <b>wave</b> dynamics, supplying such wave parameters as phase velocity and wavelength in favorable cases. The radar data pertinent to this event show an apparent vertical wave phase variation, permitting a very approximate and somewhat uncertain estimate of the wave-associated vertical flux of horizontal momentum, which is found to be about 4 dyn per sq cm.

Simultaneously, AIRS satellite data indicated stratospheric gravity waves propagating away from the location of active convection. Peak perturbation pressure values associated with waves propagating outside of regions where there was precipitation reached amplitudes close to 400 Pa at the surface. Here we investigate the origins of the waves and their relationship to observed precipitation with a specialized model study. Simulations with a 4 -km resolution dry numerical model reproduce the propagation characteristics and amplitudes of the observed waves {{with a high degree of}} quantitative similarity despite the absence of any boundary layer processes, surface topography, or moist physics in the model. The model is forced with a three-dimensional, time-dependent latent heating/cooling field that mimics the latent heating inside the precipitation systems. The heating is derived from the network of weather radar precipitation observations. This shows that deep, intense latent heat release within the precipitation systems is the key forcing mechanism for the waves observed at ground level by the USArray. Furthermore, the model simulations allow for a more detailed investigation of the vertical structure and propagation characteristics of the waves. It is found that the stratospheric and <b>tropospheric</b> <b>waves</b> are triggered by the same sources, but have different spectral properties.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the correspondence of planetary wave activity between the troposphere and the stratosphere during the Northern Hemisphere winter from December 1981 to March 1982 using Elliassen–Palm E;P) flux diagnostics. Two typical cases of correspondence are found during this period. In December and early January (period 1), the time variation of wave {{activity in the}} troposphere and stratosphere is out of phase; when the <b>tropospheric</b> <b>wave</b> activity is, vigorous the stratospheric wave activity is quiet, and vice versa. In February and March (period 2), after the stratospheric sudden warming, the <b>tropospheric</b> <b>wave</b> activity seems to propagate into the stratosphere. These two periods (period 1 and 2) are characterized by the following dynamical features. The mean zonal geostrophic wind at middle latitudes in the upper stratosphere is stronger in period 1 than in period 2. The meridional gradient of the mean zonal wind velocity at high latitudes in the troposphere and lower stratosphere is steeper in period 2 than in period 2. Consequently, {{significant changes in the}} refractive index are observed between the two periods. The, E-P flux vectors in the troposphere and lower stratosphere regularly point upward in period 2, while they branch off equatorward and poleward around the tropopause level in period 1. This feature of the E-P flux pattern is in broad agreement with the refractive index. It is also observed that there exists a strong convergence zone of the E-P flux in the upper troposphere and dust the intensity of the convergence varies with a time scale of 10 – 15 days. This variation is closely related to that of the wave activity in the troposphere and stratosphere. Finally, it is briefly shown that some of these features for the Northern Hemisphere can be observed in the Southern Hemisphere also...|$|E

During low ice phases a negative tropospheric Arctic Oscillation pattern is found, which is connected to a weakened stratospheric polar vortex and warmer stratospheric temperatures.

Results suggest that the generation and maintenance of these episodes, with positive stratospheric geopotential anomalies over the North American continent and the adjacent North Pacific, are associated with an intensified polar jet.

The study emphasizes on the {{variability of}} the jet core and its association with the Asian winter monsoon, tropical convection, upper <b>tropospheric</b> <b>wave</b> patterns, and the teleconnection of the jet with other climate systems. The relationship between the jet and North Pacific sea surface temperature pattern (SST) is also explored. NCEP/NCAR reanalysis, NASA GISS surface temperature, NASA GEOS reanalysis, NOAA reconstructed SST, GPCP precipitation, and NOAA snow cover data sets are analyzed in this study. An index of the East Asian jet has been defined by the December-February means of the 200 mb zonal winds that are averaged within a box enclosing the jet maximum, which shifts only moderately {{from one year to}} another especially in the south-north direction. The jet links to a teleconnection pattern whose major climate anomalies appear over the Asian continent and western Pacific (west of the dateline). This pattern differs distinctly from the teleconnection pattern associated with El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which causes the Pacific/North American pattern to the east of the dateline. A strong jet is accompanied clearly by an increase in the intensity of the atmospheric circulation over Asia and the Pacific. In particular, the winter monsoon strengthens over East Asia, leading to cold climate in the region, and convection intensifies over the tropical Asia-Australia sector. Changes in the jet are associated with broad-scale modification in the upper <b>tropospheric</b> <b>wave</b> patterns that leads to downstream climate anomalies over the eastern Pacific. Through this downstream influence, the East Asian jet causes climate signals in North America as well. A strong jet gives rise to warming and less snow cover in the western United States but reverse climate anomalies {{in the eastern part of}} the country, although these signals are relatively weaker than the jet-related anomalies in East Asia. There is a strong association between the East Asian jet and the North Pacific SST (NPSST). A strong jet is accompanied by a cooling in the extratropical Pacific and a warming in the tropical-subtropical Pacific. Evidence also indicates that the extratropical NPSST pattern plays a role in modulating the intensity of the jet stream.

First, a cross-spectral analysis clarifies the time scales at which downward propagation of stratospheric anomalies occurs in the low-frequency band (that is at periods longer than 50 days). At these periods the strength of the polar vortex, measured by the 20 -hPa Northern Annular Mode (NAM) index and the wave activity flux, measured by the vertical component of the Eliassen-Palm flux (EPz) from both the troposphere and the stratosphere, are significantly related with each other and in lead-lag quadrature. While, in the low-frequency band of the downward propagation, the EPz anomalies of the opposite sign around NAM extremes drive the onset and decay of NAM events, we found that the EPz anomalies in the tro-posphere, are significantly larger after stratospheric vortex anomalies than at any time before. This marked difference in the troposphere is related to planetary waves with zonal wavenumbers 1 – 3, showing that there is a <b>tropospheric</b> planetary <b>wave</b> response to the earlier state of the stratosphere at low frequencies.

The asymmetric responses of the northern and southern polar stratosphere to SST meridional gradient changes were found to be mainly due to different wave properties and transmissions in the northern and southern atmosphere. Although SST increases may give rise to stronger waves, the results showed that the effect of SST increases on the vertical propagation of <b>tropospheric</b> <b>waves</b> into the stratosphere will vary with height and latitude and be sensitive to SST meridional gradient changes. Both uniform and non-uniform SST increases accelerated the large-scale Brewer-Dobson circulation (BDC), but the gradient increases of SST between 60 °S and 60 °N resulted in younger mean age-of-air in the stratosphere and a larger increase in tropical upwelling, with a much higher tropopause than from a global uniform 1. 0 K SST increase. © 2014 Chinese National Committee for International Association of Meteorology and Atmospheric Sciences, Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Science Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R
