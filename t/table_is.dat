50|$|There {{are many}} sizes and styles of pool and billiard <b>tables.</b> Generally, <b>tables</b> <b>are</b> {{rectangles}} {{twice as long}} as they are wide. Most pool <b>tables</b> <b>are</b> known as 7-, 8-, or 9-footers, referring to the length of the table's long side. Full-size snooker and English billiard <b>tables</b> <b>are</b> 12 ft long on the longest side. Pool halls tend to have 9 ft tables and cater to the serious pool player. Pubs will typically use 7 ft <b>tables</b> which <b>are</b> often coin-operated. Formerly, 10 ft <b>tables</b> <b>were</b> common, but such <b>tables</b> <b>are</b> now considered antique collectors items; a few, usually from the late 19th century, can be found in pool halls from time to time. Ten-foot tables remain the standard size for carom billiard games.
