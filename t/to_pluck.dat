5|$|The {{purple-throated cotinga}} feeds {{primarily}} on the fruits of forest trees, most notably those belonging to the genus Cecropia. It also occasionally consumes small invertebrates, such as insects. All reported observations of the species feeding involve the cotinga leaning down from its perch <b>to</b> <b>pluck</b> fruit off a tree in the forest canopy. These birds are distinct from similar species {{in that they are}} often seen in pairs. This species perches in the canopy to take in the morning sun.|$|E
5|$|Based {{upon the}} {{structure}} of the bill, {{it has been suggested that}} this unique bill was used as a pincer, with the tips of both mandibles touching. The hookbill could have used this movement <b>to</b> <b>pluck</b> fruits or flowers for consumption, or it may have been used to extract snails from their shells. It is also possible that the bird could have crushed a snail shell between its mandibles and then used its tongue to ingest the meat and expel the shell out of the open sides of the beak.|$|E
5|$|Most {{scholars}} {{hold that}} Jesus lived in Galilee and Judea {{and did not}} preach or study elsewhere. They agree that Jesus debated with Jewish authorities {{on the subject of}} God, performed some healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. Jesus' Jewish critics considered his ministry to be scandalous because he feasted with sinners, fraternized with women, and allowed his followers <b>to</b> <b>pluck</b> grain on the Sabbath. According to Sanders, it is not plausible that disagreements over how to interpret the Law of Moses and the Sabbath would have led Jewish authorities to want Jesus killed.|$|E

5|$|Another {{interesting}} {{habit of}} males {{of this and}} other fairywren species during the reproductive season is <b>to</b> <b>pluck</b> petals (in this species, predominantly pink and purple ones which contrast with their plumage) and show them to female fairywrens. Petals often form part of a courtship display and are presented to a female in the male fairywren's own or another territory. Outside the breeding season males may sometimes still show petals to females in other territories, presumably to promote themselves. It is notable that fairywrens are socially monogamous and sexually promiscuous: pairs will bond for life, but regularly mate with other individuals; a proportion of young will have been fathered by males from outside the group. Young are often raised not by the pair alone, but with other males who also mated with the pair's female assisting. Thus, petal-carrying might be a behaviour that strengthens the pair-bond. Petal carrying might also be a way for extra males to gain matings with the female. In either case, the data does not strongly link petal-carrying and presenting to a copulation soon thereafter.|$|E
5|$|The African crake {{feeds on}} {{invertebrates}} including earthworms, gastropods, molluscs and the adults and larvae of insects, especially termites, ants, beetles and grasshoppers. Vertebrate prey such as small frogs or fish {{may also be}} taken. Plant material is eaten, especially grass seeds, but also green shoots, leaves and other seeds. The crake searches for food both within vegetation and in the open, picking insects and seeds from the ground, turning over leaf litter, or digging with its bill in soft or very dry ground. It will chase faster moving prey, reach up to take food from plants, and wade <b>to</b> <b>pluck</b> food items from the water. Crop plants such as rice, maize and peas may sometimes be eaten, but this bird is not an agricultural pest species. It forages singly, in pairs or in family groups, sometimes in association with other grassland birds such as great snipes, blue quails and corn crakes. Chicks are fed mainly on animal food. As with other rails, grit is swallowed to help break up food in the stomach.|$|E

5000|$|The bolon is a three-stringed instrument, {{constructed}} {{from a large}} calabash covered by unshaven goat skin, and a bow-shaped neck. When playing, it is placed between the legs with the strings facing the musician. In addition <b>to</b> <b>plucking</b> the strings, the musician also hits the calabash as if playing a drum.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtZiWtVrOVQ ...|$|R
2500|$|Thumb damp {{provides}} a staccato sound similar <b>to</b> <b>plucking</b> or malleting on the table. This {{is often described}} as a [...] "tinkling" [...] sound. The bell is rung with a thumb and/or several fingers touching the outside below the rim; this damps the sound immediately after the bell is rung. This technique can often be easier than plucking or malleting with smaller bells.|$|R
50|$|In 1821-23, a North Kent Gang of smugglers used Pluck's Gutter. One account from a Revenue Officer stated they {{travelled}} fourteen {{miles on}} foot, through Trenleypark Wood to Stodmarsh, then via Grove Corner <b>to</b> <b>Pluck's</b> Gutter, where {{they crossed the}} river by the ferry, and onward north-east to Mount Pleasant near Acol, then to Marsh Bay - the former name for what is modern-day Westgate-on-Sea.|$|R
25|$|If the {{contestant}} elected <b>to</b> <b>pluck</b> a duck, {{the character}} Plucka Duck—a {{man in a}} duck costume—appeared and contestants plucked a feather from his tail. Each feather had a number concealed on it which corresponded to a prize, {{and that would be}} the prize won.|$|E
25|$|Vysotsky {{used his}} fingers {{instead of a}} pick <b>to</b> <b>pluck</b> and strum, as was the {{tradition}} with Russian guitar playing. He {{used a variety of}} finger picking and strumming techniques. One of his favorite was to play an alternating bass with his thumb as he plucked or strummed with his other fingers.|$|E
25|$|It was fashionable <b>to</b> <b>pluck</b> or shave the {{forehead}} {{to raise the}} hairlines. The hair was tied tightly on the scalp and usually hidden inside the cone (possibly {{one end of the}} veil was tied to the hair and wrapped round, with the free end being pulled through the hole {{at the tip of the}} cone). However some images show long hair worn loose behind the hennin.|$|E
25|$|Gyokuro Grown under shade {{for three}} weeks prior <b>to</b> <b>plucking,</b> gyokuro {{is one of the}} most {{exclusive}} varieties of tea produced in Japan. The shading technique imparts a sweeter flavor, and produces a particularly rich color thanks to the higher amounts of chlorophyll in the shaded leaf. Gyokuro tea is associated with the Uji region, the first tea-growing region in Japan. It is often made using smaller-leaf cultivars of the tea plant.|$|R
5000|$|Thumb damp {{technique}} {{provides a}} staccato sound similar <b>to</b> <b>plucking</b> or malleting. This {{is often described}} as a [...] "tinkling" [...] sound. The bell is rung normally with a thumb or several fingers touching the outside of the bell below the rim. This damps the bell's sound immediately after it is rung. With smaller bells, this technique can often be easier than plucking or malleting because the bells don't have to lay on the table.|$|R

25|$|Mona Lisa has no {{clearly visible}} eyebrows or eyelashes. Some {{researchers}} {{claim that it}} was common at this time for genteel women <b>to</b> <b>pluck</b> these hairs, as they were considered unsightly. In 2007, French engineer Pascal Cotte announced that his ultra-high resolution scans of the painting provide evidence that Mona Lisa was originally painted with eyelashes and with visible eyebrows, but that these had gradually disappeared over time, perhaps {{as a result of}} overcleaning. Cotte discovered the painting had been reworked several times, with changes made {{to the size of the}} Mona Lisa's face and the direction of her gaze. He also found that in one layer the subject was depicted wearing numerous hairpins and a headdress adorned with pearls which was later scrubbed out and overpainted.|$|E
25|$|A rich man, who is ruined {{after having}} twelve daughters, {{abandons}} {{them in a}} forest. They are adopted by an ogress, Sandhamāra, but escape to Kutāra. After they are found in a banyan tree, emitting a golden aura, the king of Kutāra makes all of them his queens. Sandhamāra enraptures the king, is made his major queen, and persuades him <b>to</b> <b>pluck</b> out the twelve queens’ eyes, leaving only the youngest with sight in one eye. The eleven others become pregnant. Sakka sends down the Bodhisatta Rathasena to be conceived by the youngest. The king has all twelve imprisoned in a cave. When the eleven give birth, they share their babies’ flesh as food. The youngest gives birth to Rathasena. On growing up, Rathasena appeals to Sakka {{to provide them with}} cloth and ornaments, and to teach him to gamble.|$|E
25|$|In 1655, though, the {{settlers}} again came in fatal {{conflict with the}} native population in The Peach Tree War. According to popular belief, it started when a young Indian girl was shot by a Dutchman as she attempted <b>to</b> <b>pluck</b> fruit from a peach tree in an orchard on Manhattan. Her murder elicited calls for revenge from the native population, who did a house-to-house search of New Amsterdam. At the time, Stuyvesant and his troops were on an expedition to the Zuydt Rivier (Delaware Bay), where they had forced the colony of New Sweden to submit to rule by his government. Five hundred Indians attacked Pavonia, killing 100 settlers. One hundred fifty hostages were taken and held at Paulus Hook. When later ransomed they returned to New Amsterdam, and once again the settlements on the west shore of the Noort Rivier were evacuated.|$|E

25|$|Web-based spiders have poor spatial {{appreciation}} and {{get much of}} their information from reading tensions and movement in their web. P. africana, P. fimbraba and P. labiata can use their eight legs and two palps <b>to</b> <b>pluck</b> another spider's web with a virtually unlimited range of movements, using a trial and error method, until it finds and repeats a set of movements that either lures the prey {{out into the open}} or calms the prey while the Portia walks slowly close enough to bite the victim. If the prey stops being controlled by the sequence, the Portia tries new combinations until one works, and then repeats the new sequence. While such hunting shows use of least short-term memory, as of 2011 researchers do not know how long a Portia can retain such memories nor whether a Portia may use different trial and error starts for some prey species.|$|E
25|$|Prey {{is almost}} always {{obtained}} on the wing. The most commonly employed foraging technique is a sally-glean flight, where a trogon flies from an observation perch to a target on another branch or in foliage. Once there the birds hovers or stalls and snatches the item before returning to its perch to consume the item. This type of foraging is commonly used by some types of bird to obtain insect prey; in trogons and quetzals it is also used <b>to</b> <b>pluck</b> fruit from trees. Insect prey may also be taken on the wing, with the trogon pursuing flying insects {{in a similar manner}} to drongos and Old World flycatchers. Frogs, lizards and large insects on the ground may also be pounced on from the air. More rarely some trogons may shuffle along a branch to obtain insects, insect eggs and very occasionally nestling birds. Violaceous trogons will consume wasps and wasp larvae encountered while digging nests.|$|E
25|$|During a June 2, 1875, {{experiment}} by Bell and {{his assistant}} Thomas Watson, a receiver reed {{failed to respond to}} the intermittent current supplied by an electric battery. Bell told Watson, who was {{at the other end of}} the line, <b>to</b> <b>pluck</b> the reed, thinking it had stuck to the pole of the magnet. Mr. Watson complied, and to his astonishment Bell heard a reed at his end of the line vibrate and emit the same timbre of a plucked reed, although there were no interrupted on-off-on-off currents from a transmitter to make it vibrate. A few more experiments soon showed that his receiver reed had been set in vibration by the magneto-electric currents induced in the line by the motion of the distant receiver reed in the neighborhood of its magnet. The battery current was not causing the vibration but was needed only to supply the magnetic field in which the reeds vibrated. Moreover, when Bell heard the rich overtones of the plucked reed, it occurred to him that since the circuit was never broken, all the complex vibrations of speech might be converted into undulating (modulated) currents, which in turn would reproduce the complex timbre, amplitude, and frequencies of speech at a distance.|$|E
50|$|One {{way they}} form is through plucking. Different bedrock types {{may be more}} {{susceptible}} <b>to</b> <b>plucking.</b> If a highly jointed layer of bedrock is on the surface, large portions {{of it will be}} picked up by the glacier and deposited later as a glacial erratic. The valley formed in this fashion may have a steep wall at its head caused by a change in the bedrock type. The stronger bedrock will remain {{in the form of a}} riser at the end of a hanging valley.|$|R
5000|$|Playing guitar with a pick {{produces}} a bright sound compared <b>to</b> <b>plucking</b> with the fingertip. Picks {{also offer a}} greater contrast in tone across different plucking locations; for example, the difference in brightness between <b>plucking</b> close <b>to</b> the bridge {{and close to the}} neck is much greater when using a pick compared to a fingertip. [...] Conversely, the many playing techniques that involve the fingers, such as those found in fingerstyle guitar, slapping, classical guitar, and flamenco guitar, can also yield an extremely broad variety of tones.|$|R
5000|$|Mussels: Interpretation {{of archaeological}} mussel shell is {{complicated}} {{because it is}} reliant {{on the condition of}} the mussel beds, distance to the mussel beds and the type of harvest method being employed. In general, however, sites closer to mussel beds should have larger mussel shell due <b>to</b> <b>plucking</b> and residential consumption. Sites far from mussel procurement beds would be expected to have a mix of mussel shell sizes due to stripping. The presence of higher amounts of small mussel shell could also indicate and increase in resource intensification.|$|R
25|$|Throughout the Baroque era, the {{harpsichord}} {{was one of}} {{the main}} instruments used in chamber music. The harpsichord used quills <b>to</b> <b>pluck</b> strings, and it had a delicate sound. Due to the design of the harpsichord, the attack or weight with which the performer played the keyboard did not change the volume or tone. In between about 1750 and the late 1700s, the harpsichord gradually fell out of use. By the late 1700s, the pianoforte became more popular as an instrument for performance. Even though the pianoforte was invented by Bartolomeo Cristofori at the beginning of the 1700s, it did not become widely used until the end of that century, when technical improvements in its construction made it a more effective instrument. Unlike the harpsichord, the pianoforte could play soft or loud dynamics and sharp sforzando attacks depending on how hard or soft the performer played the keys. The improved pianoforte was adopted by Mozart and other composers, who began composing chamber ensembles with the piano playing a leading role. The piano was to become more and more dominant through the 19th century, so much so that many composers, such as Franz Liszt and Frédéric Chopin, wrote almost exclusively for solo piano (or solo piano with orchestra).|$|E
25|$|From the 15th {{century in}} the Netherlands onwards, it was more usual to show the non-Biblical subject of the Holy Family resting on the journey, the Rest on the Flight to Egypt, often {{accompanied}} by angels, and in earlier images sometimes an older boy who may represent, James the Brother of the Lord, interpreted as a son of Joseph, by a previous marriage. The background to these scenes usually (until the Council of Trent tightened up on such additions to scripture) includes a number of apocryphal miracles, and gives {{an opportunity for the}} emerging genre of landscape painting. In the Miracle of the corn the pursuing soldiers interrogate peasants, asking when the Holy Family passed by. The peasants truthfully say it was when they were sowing their wheat seed; however the wheat has miraculously grown to full height. In the Miracle of the idol a pagan statue falls from its plinth as the infant Jesus passes by, and a spring gushes up from the desert (originally separate, these are often combined). In further, less commonly seen, legends a group of robbers abandon their plan to rob the travellers, and a date palm tree bends down to allow them <b>to</b> <b>pluck</b> the fruit.|$|E
