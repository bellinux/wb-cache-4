50|$|A {{widely used}} way {{to compare the}} {{structures}} of biomolecules or solid bodies is to <b>translate</b> <b>and</b> <b>rotate</b> one structure {{with respect to the}} other to minimize the RMSD. Coutsias, et al. presented a simple derivation, based on quaternions, for the optimal solid body transformation (rotation-translation) that minimizes the RMSD between two sets of vectors. They proved that the quaternion method is equivalent to the well-known Kabsch algorithm. The solution given by Kabsch is an instance of the solution of the d-dimensional problem, introduced by Hurley and Cattell. The quaternion solution to compute the optimal rotation was published in the appendix of a paper of Petitjean. This quaternion solution and the calculation of the optimal isometry in the d-dimensional case were both extended to infinite sets and to the continuous case in the appendix A of an other paper of Petitjean.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{motion of}} objects that are both <b>translating</b> <b>and</b> <b>rotating</b> can be {{decomposed}} into {{an infinite number of}} translational and rotational combinations. How, then, do such stimuli routinely elicit specific percepts and behavioral responses that are usually appropriate? A possible answer is that motion percepts are fully determined by the probability distributions of all the possible correspondences and differences in the stimulus sequence. To test the merits of this conceptual framework, we investigated the perceived motion elicited by a line that is both <b>translating</b> <b>and</b> <b>rotating</b> behind an aperture. When stimuli are presented such that a particular sequence of appearance and disappearance occurs at the aperture boundary, subjects report that the line is rotating only; furthermore, the perceived centers of rotation appear to describe a cycloidal trajectory, even when one aperture shape is replaced by another. These and other perceptual effects elicited by <b>translating</b> <b>and</b> <b>rotating</b> stimuli are all accurately predicted by the probability distribution of the possible sources of the physical movements, supporting the conclusion that motion perception is indeed generated by a wholly probabilistic strategy. ...|$|R

Given an image, the Zernike moments of that image are unique, and furthermore, the effects of scaling, <b>translating</b> <b>and</b> <b>rotating</b> the image are easily removed. However, in operational use, the author discovered two major problems hampering the utility of the Zernike moments. Firstly, changing the resolution does not preserve moments, and secondly, resistance to noise is poor.
