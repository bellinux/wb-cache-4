500|$|As {{with other}} {{games in the}} Guitar Hero series, the player is {{challenged}} to play through the lead or bass guitar portions of rock songs by matching colored notes that scroll on screen towards the player in time with physical actions to score points and keep the virtual crowd pleased. While the console versions of Guitar Hero use a separate guitar-shaped peripheral, Vicarious Visions developed a [...] "Guitar Grip" [...] unit that slips into the Game Boy Advance port on the DS or the DS Lite {{to be used with}} the games; the Grip is incompatible with the Nintendo DSi and Nintendo 3DS. The Guitar Grip provides a strap to hold the game unit while providing the player with four fret buttons; the player uses the fret buttons in combination with using the stylus to simulate strumming on the <b>touch-sensitive</b> <b>screen</b> of the DS. Each game features more than 25 songs, with some variation in track lists depending on the region of release, and multiple single-player modes. The local wi-fi capabilities of the DS are used for multiplayer mode, and allow a player to use songs from one installment of the series in competitive modes with a player with a different installment.|$|E

These large, <b>touch-sensitive</b> <b>screens,</b> which control a computer {{connected to a}} digital projector, {{seem to be the}} first type of educational technology particularly suited for whole-class interaction. Strong claims are made for their value by manufacturers and policy-makers, but there has been little research on how, if at all, they influence established pedagogic practices, communicative processes and educational goals. This study has been designed to examine this issue, using observations in primary (elementary) school classrooms, and builds on the authors' previous research on Information and Communication Technology in educational dialogues and collaborative activities...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Traditional GIS {{tools are}} {{well suited for}} desktop workstations, but need to be adapted {{in order to satisfy}} the {{requirements}} of mobility. We propose a concept for sketch-based spatial querying in mobile GIS environments. This concept combines newest techniques for spatial querying and mobile technolo-gies. Such a combination is beneficial because it allows formulating queries by drawing the desired spatial configuration on <b>touch-sensitive</b> <b>screens,</b> thus avoid-ing typing complex statements in some SQL-like query language. Client-server architectures in mobile environments are characterized by low and fluctuating bandwidth, and by frequent disconnections. We discuss client-server strategies in mobile environments and suggest an adaptive client-server architecture for geo-mobile querying. It is shown that adaptation to the mobile environment is necessary in order to ensure efficiency of geo-mobile queries...|$|R

50|$|Surface {{computing}} {{is the use}} of {{a specialized}} computer GUI in which traditional GUI elements are replaced by intuitive, everyday objects. Instead of a keyboard and mouse, the user interacts with a surface. Typically the surface is a <b>touch-sensitive</b> <b>screen,</b> though other surface types like non-flat three-dimensional objects have been implemented as well. It has been said that this more closely replicates the familiar hands-on experience of everyday object manipulation.|$|E
50|$|The main {{competitor}} for the onHand PC was the Fossil Wrist PDA, a wristwatch-sized PDA. The device runs Palm OS 4.1., {{and like}} other Palm OS devices, has a virtual keyboard and <b>touch-sensitive</b> <b>screen</b> with handwriting recognition, giving the Wrist PDA an advantage on the joystick input on the onHand PC. The Wrist PDA features 8Mb of memory, 4 times the memory in the onHand, although a major disadvantage of the Fossil device was volatile memory - if the battery died, data was lost. The Ruputer/OnHand used non-volatile memory, {{which was not}} battery dependent so data was retained.|$|E
50|$|Advances {{of mobile}} {{technology}} {{and of the}} machine translation services have helped reduce or even eliminate some of the disadvantages of mobile translation such as the reduced screen size of the mobile device and the one-finger keyboarding. Many new hand-held devices come equipped with a QWERTY keyboard and/or a <b>touch-sensitive</b> <b>screen,</b> as well as handwriting recognition which significantly increases typing speed. After 2006, most new mobile phones and devices began featuring large screens with greater resolutions of 640 x 480 px, 854 x 480 px, or even 1024 x 480 px, which gives the user enough visible space to read/write large texts. In 2011, the so-called hybrid translation technology, was introduced by myLanguage through its mobile app Vocre, which relies {{in large part on}} crowd-sourced language data.|$|E
40|$|Many mobile {{devices have}} <b>touch-sensitive</b> <b>screens</b> that people {{interact}} with using fingers or thumbs. However, such interaction {{is difficult because}} targets become occluded, and because fingers and thumbs have low input resolution. Recent research has addressed occlusion through visual techniques. However, the poor resolution of finger and thumb selection still limits selection speed. In this paper, we address the selection speed problem through a new target selection technique called Escape. In Escape, targets are selected by gestures cued by icon position and appearance. A user study shows that for targets six to twelve pixels wide, Escape performs at a similar error rate and at least 30 % faster than Shift, an alternative technique, on a similar task. We evaluate Escape’s performance in different circumstances, including different icon sizes, icon overlap, use of color, and gesture direction. We also describe an algorithm that assigns icons to targets, thereby improving Escape’s performance. Author Keywords Target selection, finger gesture, touch screen, mobile devic...|$|R
40|$|Autism is a {{developmental}} disorder evident from infancy. Yet, its clinical identification {{is often not}} possible until after {{the third year of}} life. New evidence indicates disruption to motor timing and integration may underpin the disorder, providing a potential new marker for its early identification. We employed smart tablet computers with <b>touch-sensitive</b> <b>screens</b> and embedded inertial movement sensors to record the movement kinematics and gesture forces made by 37 children 3 - 6 years old with autism and 45 age- and gender-matched children developing typically. Machine learning analysis of the children’s motor patterns identified autism with 93 % accuracy. Analysis revealed these patterns consisted of greater forces at contact and with a different distribution of forces within a gesture, and gesture kinematics were faster and larger, with more distal use of space. These data support the notion disruption to movement is core feature of autism, and demonstrate autism can be assessed by smart device gameplay...|$|R

40|$|<b>Touch-sensitive</b> <b>screens</b> enable natural {{interaction}} {{without any}} instrumentation and support tangible {{feedback on the}} touch surface. In particular multi-touch interaction has proven its usability for 2 D tasks, but the challenges to exploit these technologies in virtual reality (VR) setups have rarely been studied. In this paper we address the challenge to allow users to interact with stereoscopically displayed virtual environments when the input is constrained to a 2 D touch surface. During interaction with a large-scale touch display a user changes between three different states: (1) beyond the arm-reach distance from the surface, (2) at arm-reach distance and (3) interaction. We have analyzed the user’s ability to discriminate stereoscopic display parallaxes while she moves through these states, i. e., if objects can be imperceptibly shifted onto the interactive surface and become accessible for natural touch interaction. Our {{results show that the}} detection thresholds for such manipulations are related to both user motion and stereoscopic parallax, and that users have problems to discriminate whether they touched an object or not, when tangible feedback is expected...|$|R

40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo {{study the}} effect of new {{interactive}} computer input devices on cartilage segmentation in terms of time, consistency between input devices, and precision in quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI). DesignWe compared two new input devices, an interactive digitizing tablet and an interactive <b>touch-sensitive</b> <b>screen,</b> to a traditional mouse. Medial tibial and patellar cartilage of six healthy and six osteoarthritic knees were segmented using each input device. Cartilage volume, surface area and mean thickness were assessed using a validated algorithm and used to determine consistency and precision. Segmentation time was also measured. ResultsSegmenting with an interactive <b>touch-sensitive</b> <b>screen</b> reduced segmentation time by 15 % {{when compared to the}} traditional mouse but we found no significant difference in segmentation time between the interactive digitizing tablet and the traditional mouse. We found no difference in consistency or precision of cartilage volume, mean thickness or surface area between the three input devices tested. ConclusionsWe conclude that measurements of cartilage made using articular cartilage segmentation from MR images are independent of the input device chosen for user interaction...|$|E

40|$|The {{current state}} of three human-computer {{interface}} areas was reviewed, and potential dairy herd management ap-plications were proposed. Alternative in-put devices (e. g., <b>touch-sensitive</b> <b>screens</b> and speech recognition) can provide more intuitive communication with com-puters. Several user interface designs have been developed that narrow the dichotomy between ease of use and ease of learning. Information technologies can provide dairy herd managers with more complete and immediate access to management information for decision making: 1) natural language interfaces, which allow users to query a structured database to remeve information; 2) full text retrieval systems, which retrieve per-tinent passages from a collection of documents; and 3) hypertext, which {{is a means of}} linking related passages of text {{so that they can be}} browsed in a logical, nonlinear fashion. The third area of human-computer interface concerns methods of integrating decision support systems into a management workstation that could contain independent systems, systems integrated through a user inter-face manager, or systems integrated through an intelligent dialogue manager.
