5|$|During a pre-credits {{flashback}} sequence, methamphetamine manufacturer Gale Boetticher (David Costabile) excitedly sets up {{equipment in}} an underground meth superlab for drug kingpin Gus Fring (Giancarlo Esposito). Gale asks Gus about the blue meth being produced by chemist Walter White (Bryan Cranston), who at <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> not yet working for Gus. Gus explains he has reservations about hiring Walter, but Gale insists Gus hire {{him because of}} his superior product.|$|E
5|$|For {{merchant}} {{solar power}} stations, where the electricity is being sold into the electricity transmission network, the levelised cost of solar energy {{will need to}} match the wholesale electricity price. <b>This</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> sometimes called 'wholesale grid parity' or 'busbar parity'.|$|E
5|$|The {{height of}} horses is usually {{measured}} at the highest point of the withers, where the neck meets the back. <b>This</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> used {{because it is a}} stable point of the anatomy, unlike the head or neck, which move up and down in relation to the body of the horse.|$|E

5|$|A one-vertex crease pattern {{consists}} {{of a set of}} rays or creases drawn on a flat sheet of paper, all emanating from the same point interior to the sheet. (<b>This</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> called the vertex of the pattern.) Each crease must be folded, but the pattern does not specify whether the folds should be mountain folds or valley folds. The goal is to determine whether it is possible to fold the paper so that every crease is folded, no folds occur elsewhere, and the whole folded sheet of paper lies flat.|$|E
5|$|Despite many {{media and}} {{government}} {{claims to the}} contrary, Caroline Island {{was not the first}} point of land to see sunrise on January 1, 2000 (local time); that distinction belongs to a point of land between Dibble Glacier and Victor Bay on the coast of East Antarctica, at , where the sun rose 35 minutes earlier. As <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> close to the Antarctic Circle, and the area beyond the Antarctic Circle is affected by the continuous sunlight in December, the definition of the exact point becomes a question of distinguishing between a sunset and an immediate sunrise in view of atmospheric refraction effects.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of captive breeding methods {{has led to}} peregrines being commercially available for falconry use, thus mostly eliminating the need to capture wild birds for support of falconry. The main reason for taking wild peregrines at <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> to maintain healthy genetic diversity in the breeding lines. Hybrids of peregrines and gyrfalcons are also available that can combine the best features of both species to create what many {{consider to be the}} ultimate falconry bird for the taking of larger game such as the sage-grouse. These hybrids combine the greater size, strength, and horizontal speed of the gyrfalcon with the natural propensity to stoop and greater warm weather tolerance of the peregrine.|$|E

5|$|The highway follows West Main Street {{for several}} blocks into the city's {{downtown}} district, where it crosses the Norfolk Southern Railway's Southern Tier Line and intersects NY36. NY21 turns north onto NY36, separating from the WNYP and forming a concurrency with NY36 north along a four-lane divided highway {{known as the}} Maple City Bypass. The overlap ends {{north of the city}} limits in the town of Hornellsville, where NY21 splits from NY36 and resumes its northeasterly track. Not far to the north of <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> exit34 of the Southern Tier Expressway, accessed by way of NY36. From Hornell, NY21 heads northeast through progressively less developed areas as it winds its way across the hilly terrain of the Southern Tier. For the next , NY21 serves only small, roadside hamlets, such as Fremont, Haskinville, and Loon Lake.|$|E
5|$|The next lock is Conegar Lock, {{which was}} also called Stoke Conegar or Coneygear Lock. Just above it are some hatches which {{supplied}} water to the adjacent water meadows. They were built of dressed stone, and are the best-preserved of the original hatches. There is no modern sluice at Conegar Lock, and the change in level has resulted in fast-flowing rapids which have cut back the channel above the lock. A little further south at Fish House Bay, the navigation crossed the Barton River diagonally, as the mill stream made its {{way back to the}} main river. A footbridge on the eastern bank carried the towpath over the Barton River, but the navigation below <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> dry, with its line occupied by a vegetable garden.|$|E
5|$|After {{the five}} heroine's routes are completed, the story shifts to a setting amid a ruined Kazamatsuri where Kotarou {{encounters}} Kagari {{in a world}} after re-evolution, still on the Moon. Kotarou at <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> a unified entity of all the Kotarous from all timelines where humanity was destroyed and he has memories of these events. The Moon's Kagari is trying to research a way so the Earth and humanity are not destroyed, and Kotarou attempts to buy her time while fighting a hoard of familiars summoned by Sakura Kashima of Gaia whose resolve is to annihilate humanity by killing Kagari. Kotarou and the entire cast rejoin together to protect Kagari, who manages to finish her plan to allow the Earth and humanity to coexist by sending the Moon's life force back to Earth. In the past, the Earth had sent this energy to the Moon so life could continue. There is just enough energy and resources left for a final re-evolution.|$|E

5|$|M-44 {{starts at}} the {{intersection}} of 28th Street and East Beltline Avenue in Kentwood. M-11 runs east and west along 28th Street and M-37 runs south along Broadmoor Avenue as the continuation of East Beltline. M-44 and M-37 run together on East Beltline Avenue north from this intersection, which is also the location of the Woodland Mall in Kentwood. From here north, M-37/M-44 runs along a four-lane divided boulevard through the campus of Calvin College. East Beltline passes through suburban residential areas near the east end of Reeds Lake and M-21's western terminus at Fulton Street. Just north of this intersection is an interchange with I-96 at exit38. M-37 leaves the roadway to run along I-96 while M-44 continues northward along East Beltline Avenue. All of M-44 to <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> listed on the National Highway System, a network of roadways important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility.|$|E
5|$|The {{record of}} events during the mid {{part of the}} twelfth century {{suggests}} that Leinster-based overkings of Dublin enjoyed {{the cooperation of the}} indigenous leaders of Dublin, and the emergence of the Meic Torcaill during this period may well fit into such a context. When an indigenous ruler was not to be found, however, the Dubliners seem to have sought leadership from the Isles, rather than endure a non-Leinster overking, as evidenced by the aforesaid episode concerning Gofraid. Mac Murchada's considerable authority in Dublin at <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> apparent through several ecclesiastical grants, foundations, and appointments. Furthermore, two major military operations undertaken by Dublin's forces in 1164 and 1165 were almost certainly conducted under Mac Murchada's authority. The former campaign, recorded by the thirteenth/fourteenth-century texts Brut y Tywysogyon and Brenhinedd y Saesson, concerned naval manoeuvres off Wales, in the service of Henry II, King of England (died 1189). The latter campaign, recorded by the Annals of Ulster, consisted of involvement in the ill-fated invasion of mainland Scotland, launched by Somairle mac Gilla Brigte, King of the Isles (died 1164).|$|E
5|$|To {{calculate}} what astronomical {{features a}} structure faced a coordinate system is needed. The stars provide such a system. If {{you were to}} go outside on a clear night you would observe the stars spinning around the celestial pole. <b>This</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> +90° if you are watching the North Celestial Pole or −90° if you are observing the Southern Celestial Pole. The concentric circles the stars trace out are lines of celestial latitude, known as declination. The arc connecting the points on the horizon due East and due West (if the horizon is flat) and all points midway between the Celestial Poles is the Celestial Equator which has a declination of 0°. The visible declinations vary depending where {{you are on the}} globe. Only an observer on the North Pole of Earth would be unable to see any stars from the Southern Celestial Hemisphere at night (see diagram below). Once a declination has been found for the point on the horizon that a building faces it is then possible to say whether a specific body can be seen in that direction.|$|E
