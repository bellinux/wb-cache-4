40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} is {{ultimately}} to answer the two questions raised and left unresolved in Plato’s Protagoras: What is virtue? Is virtue teachable? Following the dramatic order of Plato’s dialogues as outlined by Catherine Zuckert, I intend to show that <b>the</b> <b>Meno</b> returns to <b>the</b> issues raised and left unresolved in the Protagoras, but now {{with the idea of}} recollection. My intention is to look at how the idea of recollection, developed and associated with eros in the intervening dialogues, can help explain the nature of virtue and its teachability. I believe that we can come to answer both questions, “What is virtue?” and “Is virtue teachable?” posed in the Protagoras and <b>the</b> <b>Meno</b> by drawing on the ideas of anamnesis and eros as they appear in <b>the</b> <b>Meno,</b> Phaedrus, and Symposium...|$|R
25|$|Plato was {{the first}} philosopher who {{systematically}} inquired into issues such as those noted above. He wrote many dialogues, such as Euthyphro and the Apology, but it is from <b>the</b> <b>Meno</b> that <b>the</b> modern instantiation of Plato's Problem is derived. In <b>the</b> <b>Meno,</b> Plato theorizes {{about the relationship between}} knowledge and experience and provides an explanation for how it is possible to know something that one has never been explicitly taught. Plato believed that we possess innate ideas that precede any knowledge that we gain through experience.|$|R

We re-examine the geometry lesson in <b>the</b> <b>Meno,</b> focusing on <b>the</b> interaction between interlocutors {{in the practice of}} recollection. We appeal to an analogy with interactive memory to suggest how Plato could think that inquiry could be successful even when participants have no awareness of what would satisfy their inquiry. This exposes a feature of recollection that needs no metaphysical assumptions, and which emphasises interaction. This feature, which has escaped the notice of philosophers, is more fundamental to <b>the</b> <b>Meno</b> than a theory of innate ideas. Such a theory may be superimposed on the view about interactive memory we describe for <b>the</b> <b>Meno,</b> but to focus on Plato’s epistemological theory without first understanding {{what he has to say}} about the social dimensions of memory is putting the cart before the horse...|$|R

50|$|The unifying {{theme of}} Plato’s Literary Garden (1995) is that Plato wrote his dialogues to engage his readers in philosophic conversations {{similar to those}} he shared with Socrates. The book {{develops}} this theme with discussions of various early and middle dialogues, including <b>the</b> <b>Meno,</b> <b>the</b> Phaedo, the Phaedrus, the Symposium, and the Republic.|$|R

40|$|Recent {{critiques of}} veritistic value monism, or {{the idea that}} true belief is unique in being of {{fundamental}} epistemic value, typically invoke a claim about the surplus value of knowledge over mere true belief, in turn traced back to Plato’s <b>Meno.</b> However, to <b>the</b> extent Plato at all defends a surplus claim in <b>the</b> <b>Meno,</b> it differs from that figuring in contemporary discussions with respect to both its scope {{and the kind of}} value at issue, and is under closer scrutiny fully compatible with veritistic value monism. Consequently, contrary to what seems to be sup- posed in the literature, the critics of monism have little to gain from turning to <b>the</b> <b>Meno</b> for support...|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>meno</b> mosso {{is divided}} into two-bar phrases. The string {{orchestra}} plays a divided chord in steady quarter notes, while the solo violins arpeggiate notes of the chord in sixteenth notes above. Each time the key changes in the orchestra, the piano punctuates the texture with an A minor chord in both hands. <b>The</b> <b>meno</b> mosso works its {{way back to the}} key of A minor through several chords, beginning with a diminished F-sharp minor chord. When the soloists and orchestra finally reach the A minor chord, the soloists play the opening ff “A” octave, followed by four measures of silence in which the chamber orchestra plays a triple forte A minor chord.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{will argue}} that Plato's {{influential}} philosophical puzzle known as <b>the</b> <b>Meno</b> Paradox and <b>the</b> related Problem of False Belief are a more serious threat to Plato's philosophical programme (and ours) than many interpreters recognize. Furthermore, Plato's most obvious candidate for a solution to these problems, the Theory of Recollection, {{is not sufficient to}} explain how the Paradox misunderstands the epistemic processes of learning which it treats. This failure of Plato's account motivates a close consideration of Aristotle's sophisticated attempt to resolve the difficulties Plato raises. I {{will argue that}} a proper understanding of Aristotle's philosophy of mind and the forms of cognition through which he thinks humans progress yields the key to a powerful and heretofore unrecognized Aristotelian solution to <b>the</b> <b>Meno</b> Paradox and <b>the</b> Problem of False Belief...|$|R
25|$|No {{satisfactory}} {{definition of}} virtue emerges in <b>the</b> <b>Meno.</b> Socrates' comments, however, {{show that he}} considers a successful definition to be unitary, rather than a list of varieties of virtue, that it must contain all and only those terms which are genuine instances of virtue, and must not be circular.|$|R

50|$|On Virtue (Περὶ Ἀρετῆς; De Virtute) is a Socratic {{dialogue}} {{attributed to}} Plato, {{but which is}} considered spurious. In the short dialogue, Socrates discusses with a friend questions about whether virtue can be taught.

25|$|Later in <b>the</b> <b>Meno,</b> Socrates uses a {{geometrical}} {{example to}} expound Plato's view that knowledge in this latter sense is acquired by recollection.

5000|$|In <b>the</b> <b>Meno,</b> quasi lento section, {{the violin}} plays [...] "artificial," [...] "stopped," [...] or (less accurately) [...] "false" [...] harmonics.

25|$|Some of Plato's famous {{works are}} Phaedo, the Crito, and, as noted earlier, <b>the</b> <b>Meno.</b> Within {{these works are}} found a {{comprehensive}} philosophy that addresses epistemology, metaphysics, ethics, aesthetics, theology, and logic.

Plato's teacher and mentor, Socrates, always plays a significant and formative role in these dialogues.|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>Meno</b> project {{came up with}} a {{framework}} for narrative guidance and narrative construction in the context of non-adaptive systems. As part of the HOMEWORK project we are exploring the extension of this framework in order to enable us to create adaptive systems that can help teachers offer learners a coherent experience across artifacts and contexts. We are attempting to ensure that the framework that underpins the HOMEWORK project helps designers, teachers and learners to work together effectively. Lesson planning is an important activity for a teacher, which helps them link different educational resources into a coherent narrative. We discuss the evolution of the current Non Linear Interactive Narrative Framework (NINF) and, in particular, our continuing work with teachers as we try to increase our understanding about how best to design a system to support them in their lesson planning activities. Here our emphasis is upon the extension of <b>the</b> <b>Meno</b> framework to <b>the</b> design of a system that can be adaptive to the needs of individual learners and groups...|$|R
25|$|One such {{dialogue}} of Plato's that utilized the Socratic Method was <b>the</b> <b>Meno.</b> <b>The</b> participants were Socrates, Meno, Anytus, {{and one of}} <b>Meno's</b> slave boys. <b>The</b> dialogue begins with Meno asking Socrates whether virtue can be taught. Socrates responds by stating {{that he does not}} know the definition of virtue. Meno replies by stating the characteristics of a virtuous man, to which Socrates responds that the characteristics of a virtuous man may be the by-products of virtuousness but they by no means define virtue. Meno is obliged to agree; to wit, he tries to modify his explanation of virtue. Socrates counters each attempt by pointing to inconsistencies and circular arguments.|$|R

50|$|The Polonaise {{opens with}} a fiery Allegro appassionato in C-sharp minor, the primary theme preceded by {{descending}} octaves. The section climaxes {{with a series of}} virtuosic arpeggio figures which give way to a tender melody. This is then followed by a repetition of the theme. After this opening section, there is a new theme introduced in the enharmonic D-flat major. This new theme is then developed and followed by a new left hand melody, which increases the tension until a repeat of <b>the</b> <b>meno</b> mosso.|$|R
40|$|Socrates (in <b>the</b> <b>Meno)</b> {{denied that}} virtues like courage could be taught, whereas Protagoras defended this claim. Compassion is {{discussed}} below in this context; it is distinguished from related, but different, moral qualities, {{and the role}} of imagination is emphasised. 'Sympathy's and role-modelling views of compassion's acquisition are criticised. Compassion can indeed be taught, but neither by the example of a few, isolated physicians nor by creation of Departments of Compassion. In replying to one standard objection to teaching compassion, it is emphasised that scientific competence and compassion aren't mutually exclusive...|$|R
5000|$|Plato holds a {{very strict}} notion of knowledge. For example, {{he does not}} accept {{expertise}} about a subject, nor direct perception (see Theaetetus), nor true belief about the physical world (<b>the</b> <b>Meno)</b> as knowledge. It {{is not enough for}} the philosopher to understand the Ideas (Forms), he must also understand the relation of Ideas to all four levels of the structure to be able to know anything at all. For this reason, in most of the [...] "earlier Socratic" [...] dialogues, Socrates denies knowledge both to himself and others.|$|R
25|$|Plato's Problem {{describes}} {{the disparity between}} input (poverty of the stimulus) and output (grammar).

Plato's Problem, as conceived here, informs much of the theory in this branch of linguistics.|$|R
2500|$|An {{association}} between Pythagorean philosophy and reincarnation was routinely accepted throughout antiquity.
