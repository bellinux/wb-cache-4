50|$|Thomas {{presents}} the {{three levels of}} technology in medicine: “nontechnology” that helps patients with diseases that are not well understood {{but does not help}} solve the underlying mechanisms of the disease, “halfway technology” that makes up for disease or postpones death for diseases whose courses we cannot do much about, and “high technology” that from understanding the mechanism of the disease we are now able to cure. When looking at the costs of the three different technologies they are all needed, but once a “high technology” is found for a disease the benefits outweigh <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>studying</b> the mechanism of the disease so thoroughly. Thomas suggests that in order to save money in health care, the highest priority in funding should be given to basic research.|$|E
30|$|Nevertheless, the {{introduction}} of tuition fees led to a controversial debate in Germany. The major concern was that tuition fees could discourage potential students, leading to a decrease in enrollment rates. A high proportion of individuals with a tertiary education is desirable because they have higher wages on average (thus increasing tax and social security revenues) and a lower unemployment probability than individuals with less education. Moreover, it contributes to the innovation potential of countries (Hoareau et al. 2013). On the individual level, the imposition of tuition fees increases <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>studying,</b> which may have adverse effects on university enrollment. However, the corresponding increase of available resources at universities may improve studying conditions and thus the probability of study success, mitigating potential adverse effects of higher costs.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} whether {{universities are}} delivering pedagogical value to international accounting students commensurate with <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>studying</b> abroad. The paper uses survey and interview methods {{to explore the}} extent to which Chinese Learners (CLs) in an Australian postgraduate accounting subject have distinct learning needs. The paper then reviews universities’ responses to these needs, especially in light of funding and resource pressures. The paper reinforces findings that CLs have different learning approaches to local students, but not inferior or ‘shallow’ approaches. However, since CLs face distinctive financial and social pressures to achieve high results, their learning practices may be more sensitive to changes in teaching and assessment, such that cost constraints on educational resources might disproportionately affect their learning. This suggests that a paradoxical result of the funding pressures on many universities may be to encourage large international student cohorts while constraining available resources to meet their learning needs. 16 page(s...|$|E

50|$|When {{the study}} administrators or {{automated}} mechanisms process the CRFs that {{were sent to}} the sponsor by local researchers, they make a note of queries. Queries are non-sensible or questionable data that must be explained. Examples of data that would lead to a query: a male patient being on female birth control medication or having had an abortion, or a 15-year-old participant having had hip replacement surgery. Each query has to be resolved by the individual attention of a member of each local research team, as well as an individual in the study administration. To ensure quality control, these queries are usually addressed and resolved before the CRF data is included by the sponsor in the final clinical study report.
