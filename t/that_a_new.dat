His alliance with the Persians resulted in the recovery of the Holy Sponge which fastened to the True Cross in an elaborate ceremony on 14 September 629. The ceremonial parade went toward the Hagia Sophia. There, the True Cross was slowly raised up until it vertically towered over the high altar. To many, this was a sign <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> golden age was about to begin for the Byzantine Empire.|$|E
5|$|Bethe {{managed to}} work it out on the train from New York to Schenectady. He arrived at a value of 1040MHz, {{extremely}} close to that obtained experimentally by Lamb and Retherford. He did so by realising that it was a non-relativistic process, which greatly simplified the calculations. His paper, published in the Physical Review in August 1947 was only two pages long and contained just 12 mathematical equations, but was enormously influential. Hitherto, it had been assumed that the infinities meant that QED was fundamentally flawed, and <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>new,</b> radical theory was required. Bethe demonstrated that this was not necessary.|$|E

In July 1943, Montenegrin Partisan leader Milovan Đilas contacted both Baćović and Ostojić to establish their willingness to work jointly against the Germans and Italians, given <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> Yugoslav government-in-exile was about to be established in London without Mihailović.

5|$|Following the mistrial in Boston, the {{prosecution}} moved {{to schedule a}} new trial.

The contempt of court fines were appealed again on January 9, 1989, and affirmed again on March 29. Following the convictions in the Alexandria court, prosecutors moved to dismiss the charges from the Boston court, canceling the retrial. The LaRouche lawyers appealed that decision on March 13, 1989, arguing that they needed the trial to exonerate LaRouche.|$|E
