5|$|Nothing came of the proposal, which The <b>Times</b> <b>of</b> <b>London</b> {{called one}} of the most loathsome stories of the war. Historians believe that the SS, {{including}} its commander, Heinrich Himmler, intended the negotiations as cover for peace talks with the Western Allies that would exclude the Soviet Union and perhaps even Adolf Hitler. Whatever its purpose, the proposal was thwarted by the British government. They arrested Brand in Aleppo (then under British control), where he had gone to propose Eichmann's offer to the Jewish Agency, {{and put an end to}} it by leaking details to the media.|$|E

In accordance with Operational Order B. 60, dated 17 December, the targets were German warships either in port or at sea.

News of the attack made front pages throughout the world, including The <b>Times</b> <b>of</b> <b>London,</b> The New York Times, and the Montreal Gazette. In some newspapers, the news took precedence over the 'Dambuster' raids performed in Europe by No. 617 Squadron RAF.|$|E

25|$|Just {{before the}} retraction, {{criticism}} arose {{over the fact}} that the Royal Free Hospital had received £55,000 in August 1996 from lawyers preparing to sue MMR manufacturers for support of Wakefield's research. Wakefield asserted that the donation was to fund a second clinical study; some of the children involved were subjects in both studies. However, it was subsequently revealed by The Sunday <b>Times</b> <b>of</b> <b>London</b> that Wakefield had personally been paid more than £400,000.|$|E

It is still widely available today in numerous languages, in print and on the Internet, and continues to be presented by some proponents as a genuine document.|$|E

25|$|Overnight on 23 January, gunmen set off {{a number}} of explosions along the wall near the crossing.

Between 200,000 and 700,000 Palestinians crossed over to Egypt and bought items at shops at the Egyptian half of Rafah and the North Sinai Governorate's capital, Arish. A Palestinian security guard later told The <b>Times</b> <b>of</b> <b>London</b> that militants had been steadily cutting through {{the base of the}} Israeli Gaza Strip barrier with oxyacetylene torches for months.|$|E
25|$|After being {{rejected}} {{by a number}} of local media companies, Christopher succeeded in having his Talisman story published by a small online magazine that specializes in publishing un- and under-reported news stories, rabble.ca. About a week later Christopher's article on Rabble was noticed by the Financial <b>Times</b> <b>of</b> <b>London.</b> After the Financial Times ran the Tailsman story, it was noticed by other news services and was circulated globally via the Associated Press, Canadian Press, and Reuters. The negative publicity caused by Christopher's article forced Talisman to suspend its operations in Sudan within about a year, but local media never carried the article.|$|E
25|$|Other leading British and American {{newspapers}} corroborated {{these accounts}} of the Assyrian genocide. The New York Times reported on 11 October that 12,000 Persian Christians had died of massacre, hunger, or disease; thousands of girls as young as seven had been raped or forcibly converted to Islam; Christian villages had been destroyed, and three-fourths of these Christian villages were burned to the ground. The <b>Times</b> <b>of</b> <b>London</b> was perhaps the first widely respected publication to document the fact that 250,000 Assyrians and Chaldeans eventually died in the Ottoman genocide of Christians, a figure which many journalists and scholars have subsequently accepted.|$|E

To do, the band unexpectedly requested that believers limit their investments and delay reaching the $50,000 target.|$|R
25|$|Also in 2003, a stage {{adaptation}} of Nabokov's unused screenplay {{was performed in}} Dublin adapted by Michael West. It was described by Karina Buckley (in the Sunday <b>Times</b> <b>of</b> <b>London)</b> as playing more like Italian commedia dell'arte than a dark drama about paedophilia. Hiroko Mikami notes that the initial sexual encounter between Lolita and Humbert was staged {{in a way that}} left this adaptation particularly open to the charge of placing the blame for initiating the relationship on Lolita and normalizing child sexual abuse; however, Mikami challenged this reading of the production, noting that the ultimate devastation of events on Lolita's life is duly noted in the play.|$|E
25|$|Stevenson {{was born}} in Montreal and raised in Ottawa, one of three children. His father, John Stevenson, was a Scottish lawyer who was working in Ottawa as the Canadian {{correspondent}} for The <b>Times</b> <b>of</b> <b>London</b> or The New York Times. His mother, Ruth, {{had an interest in}} theosophy and an extensive library on the subject, to which Stevenson attributed his own early interest in the paranormal. As a child he was often bedridden with bronchitis, a condition that continued into adulthood and engendered in him a lifelong love of books. According to Emily Williams Kelly, a colleague of his at the University of Virginia, he maintained a list of the books he had read, which numbered 3,535 between 1935 and 2003.|$|E
25|$|The events {{generated}} {{criticism and}} a general distrustful attitude toward the sport of professional cycling from media and public opinion. The doping allegations also resulted in several team sponsors threatening to retire their support if events advanced further. Some media such as German TV channels ARD and ZDF left the Tour once the first scandals broke. Following the Tour's conclusion, the sport's governing bodies spoke out about ways to combat the prevalence of doping in cycling and key team sponsors elected to withdraw their support due to the reputational damage caused by the scandals. The 2007 Tour de France {{has been referred to}} {{as one of the most}} controversial Tours. After the end of the Tour, The <b>Times</b> <b>of</b> <b>London</b> ranked it 4th in its list of the top 50 sporting scandals.|$|E
