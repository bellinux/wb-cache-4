Rodman wrote that Ciara [...] "takes her own advice to 'put some snap into it'." [...] About.com writer Bill Lamb named {{it one of}} the album's best, and wrote that it [...] "lands somewhere between Ciara's {{contemporary}} classic '1, 2 Step' and Missy Elliott's own 'Lose Control'." [...] Andrew Rennie of Now considered it the album's strongest track and noted Ciara and Elliott's [...] "trademark chemistry". IGN's Finn White wrote that the song [...] "will make all the bad girls sweat on the dance floor". In his review of Fantasy Ride, Marrio Tarradell of The Dallas Morning News wrote that [...] "Love Sex Magic" [...] is a [...] "dance-floor corker", and noted that [...] "Work" [...] is [...] "similarly club-ready", referring both songs to as [...] "ultra-catchy". Regarding [...] "Work", Tarradell wrote, [...] "The rapid-fire 'work, work, work' refrain will bond <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>head</b> as if with Krazy Glue." [...] Writing for Metro Weekly, Doug Rule called the song an [...] "instant classic" [...] and referred it to as a [...] "sequel of sorts to Elliott's marvelous 2002 hit 'Work It'." [...] A writer from Rap-Up named the song one of the album's top tracks.|$|E

On February 25, 2004, Eugene broke a table, smashed items around the house, and pushed his mother out of the kitchen. Afterward, his mother told {{officers}} that he had said, [...] "I'll put a gun <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>head</b> and kill you." [...] This crime led to his serving probation for resisting an officer without violence. The remaining charges were mainly related to marijuana, which he had {{expressed a desire to}} quit.

He has said that, [...] "You can't define human beings as illegal, as exploitable [...] as non-status." [...] He has also criticized the high bar for refugee status in Canada saying that, [...] "You have to prove that there is a gun <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>head</b> or there will be a gun to your head," [...] in order to be allowed to stay.|$|E
2500|$|The musical {{originally}} {{relied on}} heavy prosthetics and elaborate costumes {{in an attempt}} to make the musical resemble the film as closely as possible. In an attempt to replicate the film's famous movie poster, Egan was dressed in flats while Mann was positioned on stilts to establish a more dramatic height difference. According to Egan, the studio [...] "didn't trust the audience's ability to suspend disbelief, something theater-goers are routinely asked to do." [...] However, the company finally began to relent as the production neared Houston tryouts after a final run-through during which the actors did not wear costumes; thus, the prosthetics were gradually lessened and replaced by make up for the Beast and enchanted objects during 1993 previews. The elaborate costumes resulted in their fair share of technical difficulties, malfunctions and performance restrictions, many of which manifested during the seven-week tryouts in Houston. The costumes left little room for the performers to change between scenes, and air conditioners were fastened to them to regulate their temperatures. In general, the weight of the enchanted objects' costumes limited their dancing. Chiropractors and therapists remained on standby to assist Fowler, whose Mrs. Potts costume required her to always keep one arm in the air. Beach compared holding up the two propane tanks used to represent Lumiere's candles to carrying two hams around a grocery store two and a half hours. To build his stamina, Beach would carry the tanks during rehearsal. Beach's hand caught fire during one performance, which he did not notice until Mann subtly pointed it out using [...] "furtive head nods". While dancing, the inertia of Egan's heavy ballgown caused its skirt to constantly pull her in the opposite direction of whichever way she turned. Mann likened performing in the Beast's costume to wearing several heavy winter coats, comparing the wig to [...] "four Angora cats and gaffer taping them <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>head</b> and then running around the block 10 or 12 times." [...] Disney was outraged when, after their first performance at the Palace Theatre, The New York Times published caricaturist Al Hirschfeld's line drawing interpretation of Belle and the Beast's pose, in which Belle's yellow gown was colored pink, and the Beast's tuxedo appeared greenish as opposed to royal blue. When Disney confronted Hirschfeld, the artist defended his work, explaining, [...] "The costumes may have been blue and yellow, but they made me feel green and pink." [...] Hould-Ward adjusted the costumes to accommodate the locations as the production traveled to various theaters.|$|E
