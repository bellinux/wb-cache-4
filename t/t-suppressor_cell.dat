Intratumoral delivery of IL- 12, in contrast, can restore cytotoxic function to tumor-associated CD 8 + T cells and induce the apoptotic death of T-suppressor cells. Depletion of CD 8 + T cells from tumors before IL- 12 treatment resulted in the abrogation of treatment-mediated <b>T-suppressor</b> <b>cell</b> apoptosis revealing a link between CD 8 + T cell activation and T-suppressor elimination. Furthermore, IL- 12 failed to induce <b>T-suppressor</b> <b>cell</b> loss in IFN-y- or FasL-deficient mice demonstrating a requirement for IFN-y and FasL in this process. Adoptive transfer of wild-type CD 8 + T cells to FasL-knockout mice restored posttherapy <b>T-suppressor</b> <b>cell</b> elimination from tumors establishing that expression of FasL on CD 8 + T cells was sufficient to promote <b>T-suppressor</b> <b>cell</b> death.

40|$|Reports by {{a number}} of {{investigators}} have described the thymus-derived (T) -cell dependence of immunoglobulin synthesis by pokeweed mitogen (PWM) stimulated human peripheral blood bone marrow-derived (B) cells. Because of the cooperative nature of this in vitro system, it was chosen for examination of the differential effects of low density lipoprotein inhibitor (LDL-In) on B- and T-cell functions. Supernates from 7 -d cultures that contained either peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBM) or combinations of isolated lymphocyte populations were assayed for immunoglobulin (Ig) G by competitive inhibition radio-immunoassay. LDL-In suppression of whole PBM IgG synthesis occurred at 5 - 20 μg protein/ml and was independent of PWM concentration. Maximal suppression required preincubation of cells with LDL-In before stimulation. Suppression was also observed when B cells alone were exposed for 24 h to LDL-In before PWM stimulation; these suppressed B cells were not rescued by normal T cells. Exposure of T cells alone to low doses of LDL-In for 24 h augmented, but high doses suppressed, IgG synthesis, suggesting a differential effect on T-helper vs <b>T-suppressor</b> <b>cell</b> populations. Independent LDL-In exposure of T-helper or <b>T-suppressor</b> <b>cell</b> enriched populations, separated by rosetting with IgG- or IgM-coated ox erythrocytes, identified the <b>T-suppressor</b> <b>cell</b> populations as the most sensitive of the lymphocyte populations tested. The sensitivities of lymphocyte subpopulations to LDL-In, relative to PBM, were 2. 8, 1. 2, and 0. 3 for the T-suppressor cells, B cells and T-helper cells, respectively. Thus, both B and T lymphocytes are sensitive to and can be regulated by LDL-In. In addition, the biologic activity observed when unseparated PBM are exposed to LDL-In appears to represent a composite of the sensitivity of each of the lymphocyte subpopulations...|$|E

STUDY DESIGN: Plasma samples from 10 women with preeclampsia, from 10 normal pregnant women, and from 10 nonpregnant women matched for age and gestation, were analyzed by flow cytometry. RESULTS: The total number of circulating microparticles was unaltered in pregnancy and preeclampsia. The largest portion of microparticles was derived from platelets in all groups. <b>T-suppressor</b> <b>cell</b> microparticle numbers were decreased in normal pregnancy (P=. 04). In preeclampsia T-suppressor, T-helper cell, and granulocyte microparticle numbers were increased (P = 008,. 008, and. 03, respectively).
