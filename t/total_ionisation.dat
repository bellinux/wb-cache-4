40|$|The <b>total</b> single-photon <b>ionisation</b> {{cross section}} was {{calculated}} for helium atoms in their ground state. Using a full configuration-interaction approach the photoionisation cross section was extracted from the complex-scaled resolvent. In the energy range from ionisation threshold to 59 eV our results agree with an earlier B-spline based calculation in which the continuum is box discretised within a relative error of 0. 01 % in the non-resonant part of the spectrum. Above the ^++ threshold our results agree {{on the other hand}} very well to a recent Floquet calculation. Thus our calculation confirms the previously reported deviations from the experimental reference data outside the claimed error estimate. In order to extend the calculated spectrum to very high energies, an analytical hydrogenic-type model tail is introduced that should become asymptotically exact for infinite photon energies. Its universality is investigated considering also H^-, Li^+, and HeH^+. With the aid of the tail corrections to the dipole approximation are estimated. Comment: 20 pages, 7 figures, 2 table...|$|R

State selection of the two metastable states of Ne* was obtained by optical pumping with a cw dye laser. We observe a strongly different velocity dependence at collision energies below about 1 eV for the ionisation {{cross section of the}} systems Ne* [...] -H 2, N 2, CO, and CH 4, and the systems Ne* [...] -O 2, NO, CO 2, and N 2 O, respectively. The first group shows an increasing cross section in this energy range, similar to the Ne* [...] -Ar system, while the second group shows a very flat behaviour. This behaviour correlates with the difference in character (p or sb) of the orbital of the electron that is removed from the target molecule. For the molecules H 2, N 2, CO, and CH 4 an electron from a sb orbital is removed from the molecule, whereas for O 2, NO, N 2 O, and CO 2 an outer p-ortibal electron is involved. For the systems Ne* (3 P 0, 3 P 2) [...] -H 2 we have derived the imaginary part of the optical potential by assuming a real potential similar to the theoretically calculated ground state Na [...] -H 2 potential of Botschwina et al. The resonance width G(r) {{as a function of the}} internuclear distance r shows a saturation at small r (r 2 ̆ 6 lt; 2. 8 Å) for both the Ne*(3 P 0) [...] -H 2 and the Ne*(3 P 2) [...] -H 2 interaction.

40|$|The {{method of}} {{measuring}} {{the energy of}} a charged particle {{by means of the}} <b>total</b> amount of <b>ionisation</b> it produces in a gas, through which it passes, is well established. Gas filled devices may be subdivided into (a) current ionisation chambers and (b) pulse ionisation chambers, proportional counters and Geiger counters. Proportional counters in a very crude form were used by Rutherford and Geiger in 1908. Soon afterwards the Geiger counter was developed, which after considerable improvement by Geiger and Müller in 1928, became the well known Geiger-Müller counter. In fact the three gas filled devices mentioned in (b) can be achieved with the same counter by using it with different applied voltages. If the applied voltage on a typical cylindrical counter is varied and the output pulse height is measured for a fixed number of ion pairs liberated in the gas, a characteristic curve of the form shown in Fig. (1) will be obtained. With voltages between say v₁ and v₂, the field strength is just sufficient to collect all the ion-pairs and no new ion-pairs are liberated, so the pulse height will remain constant. This is the region of pulse ionization chambers where the gas gain is unity. As the voltage is further increased to between v₂ and v₃ both elastic and inelastic collisions take place and the pulse height increases exponentially [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Results are {{presented}} {{for a series}} of experiments investigating effects which call influence the interpretation of data from ionisation-based dust detectors carried oil spacecraft. First, the variation of the impact ionisation yield with angle of impact was Studied for impacts of iron microparticles onto gold at speeds of 1 - 75 km s(- 1). The angle of incidence was from 0 degrees (normal incidence) to 80 degrees (glancing incidence). Little or no variation was observed at angles up to 60 degrees, but at 80 degrees the <b>total</b> impact <b>ionisation</b> signal was around an order of magnitude lower than at smaller angles. In addition, the fast rising component of the ionisation signal rise time showed no variation with impact angle, but the total signal rise time showed a steady decrease. The effect of secondary impact ionisation resulting from particle impacts on detector side walls was also Studied. Iron microparticles were fired oil to an aluminium target Lit various angles, and the impact ionisation signal on a nearby gold target was measured. It was found that ionisation signals were observed oil the gold target, and that these were very similar in appearance to those observed in direct impacts. The effect of reduction in particle charge oil an impact ionisation signal was investigated. Iron microparticles were fired on to a gold target after passing through a thin film which reduced the charge which was used to accelerate them. It was found that there was a measurable drop in ionisation signal in the reduced-charge case. The empirical relation I-IONISATION = 1. 67 x 10 (- 9) Q(PARTICLE) (0. 35) (units of C) was found. This implies there is a component in the observed ionisation signal that is not related to the impact. To test this, charged tungsten carbide particles were dropped at very low velocity onto a replica of a dust detector used in space whilst placed in a vacuum chamber. lonisation signals were frequently recorded by the detector. It was concluded that this signal originated from the incident particle charge. In the final section of work, as all example, the influence of oblique incidence, side-wall impacts and particle charge effects oil data collected by the Gorid dust detector in Earth orbit were investigated. Corrections were applied to the mass and velocity distributions derived from Gorid data. In extremis, oblique incidence effects were found to shift the mass distribution down by an order of magnitude, and the velocity distribution up by a factor of two to three. If all the data had come from unrecognised side-wall impacts, the mass distribution would be shifted downwards to lower masses by three orders of magnitude. and the velocity distribution upwards by a factor of five. Possible particle charge effects were found to shift the mass distribution down by 30 % and did not alter the velocity distribution. Overall we have investigated a variety of impact-related phenomena and conclude that these call affect the interpretation of data from instruments deployed in space...|$|R
40|$|CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is {{the largest}} machine ever built, with a total {{circumference}} of 26. 7 km; {{and it is the}} most powerful accelerator ever, both in beam energy and beam intensity. The main magnets are superconducting, keeping the particles into two counter circulating beams, which collide in four interaction points. CERN and the LHC will be described in chap. 1. The superconducting magnets of the LHC have to be protected against particle losses. Depending on the number of lost particles, the coils of the magnets will become normal conducting and/or will be damaged. To avoid these events a beam loss monitoring (BLM) system was installed to measure the particle loss rates. If the predefined safe thresholds of loss rates are exceeded, the beams are directed out of the accelerator ring towards the beam dump. The detectors of the BLM system are mainly ionization chambers located outside of the cryostats. In <b>total,</b> about 3500 <b>ionisation</b> chambers are installed. Further challenges include the high dynamical range of losses (chamber currents ranging between 2 pA and 1 mA). The BLM system will be further described in chap. 2. The subject of this thesis is to study the loss patterns and find the origin of the losses in a deterministic way, by comparing measured losses to well understood loss scenarios. This is done through a case study: different techniques were used on a restrained set of loss scenarios, as a proof of concept of the possibility to extract information from a loss profile. Finding the origin of the losses should allow acting in response. A justification of the doctoral work will be given at the end of chap. 2. Then, this thesis will focus on the theoretical understanding and the implementation of the decomposition of a measured loss profile as a linear combination of the reference scenarios; and the evaluation of the error on the recomposition and its correctness. The principles of vector decomposition are developed in chap. 3. An ensemble of well controlled loss scenarios (such as vertical and horizontal blow-up of the beams or momentum offset during collimator loss maps) has been gathered, in order to allow the study and creation of reference vectors. To achieve the Vector Decomposition, linear algebra (matrix inversion) is used with the numeric algorithm for the Singular Value Decomposition. Additionally, a specific code for vector projection on a non-orthogonal basis of a hyperplane was developed. The implementation of the vector decomposition on the LHC data is described in chap. 4. After this, the use of the decomposition tools systematically on the time evolution of the losses will be described: first as a study of the variations second by second, then by comparison to a calculated default loss profile. The different ways to evaluate the variation are studied, and are presented in chap. 5. The next chapter (6) describes the gathering of decomposition results applied to beam losses of 2011. The vector decomposition is applied on every second of the ''stable beans'' periods, as a study of the spatial distribution of the loss. Several comparisons of the results given by the decompositions with measurements from other LHC instruments allowed different validations. Eventually, a global conclusion on the interest of the vector decomposition is given. Then, the extra chapter in Appendix A describes the code which was developed to access the BLM data, to represent them in a meaningful way, and to store them. This included connecting to different databases. The whole instrument uses ROOT objects to send SQL queries to the databases, as well as java API, and is coded in Python.

40|$|The {{velocity}} {{dependence and}} absolute {{values of the}} <b>total</b> <b>ionisation</b> cross sections of Ar, Kr, Xe and N 2 by metastable Ne*(3 P 0) and Ne*(3 P 2) atoms have been measured in a crossed beam scattering experiment. State selection of the beam of metastable atoms has been performed by optical pumping with a cw dye laser. Our technique, which uses the UV photons released in the radiative decay following the laser excitation to measure the density of metastable atoms in the scattering centre, is very insensitive to details {{of the process of}} optical pumping. Systematic errors in detection efficiencies of the metastable atoms are largely eliminated in this approach. We have analysed our experimental data in terms of an optical potential, using a least-squares method to determine the potential parameters. For the real part we use an ion—atom Morse—Morse—spline—van der Waals potential (V 0 (r) as proposed by Siska. The well area for V 0 (r) 0. 1 eV is left unmodified. The energy dependence of the cross sections for the Ne*-rare gas systems points unambiguously to a pronounced 2 ̆ 2 kink 2 ̆ 2 in the repulsive branch at 0. 1 – 0. 2 eV. For the imaginary part, with the usual exponential behaviour, we have to introduce a saturation to a constant value at small internuclear distances r 2 ̆ 6 lt;rIm with rIm in the range 2. 1 2 ̆ 6 lt;rIm(Å) 2 ̆ 6 lt; 2. 6 which is only probed for energies 0. 15 eV. These modifications result in a satisfactory description of the data for the Ne*(3 P 2) —Ar, Kr, Xe systems. For the Ne*(3 P 0 systems additional modifications of the well area are necessary. By calibrating the density—length product of the secondary beam and using the available detection efficiencies for ions and UV photons of the spiraltron detector we have also determined absolute values of the <b>total</b> <b>ionisation</b> cross section. In the thermal energy range (0. 06 – 0. 16 eV) they are in fair agreement with the rate constants for the quenching of metastable atoms as measured by Brom in flowing afterglows...|$|E
40|$|Electron impact {{ionisation}} and dissociative ionisation {{of the two}} smallest primary alcohols have been investigated. A quadrupole mass spectrometer was used, with an internal ionising electron source resulting in an energy resolution of ~ 0. 8 eV.

40|$|An {{integrated}} radiobiological {{model has}} been developed in this thesis using the Monte Carlo toolkit “Geant 4 ” to produce a radiobiological modelling software package. The result is a simulation capable of: (a) growing a simulated 3 D cell structure (i. e. tumour or mammalian tissue) composed of individual cells (with accurate chemical composition and geometry), (b) irradiating the cells and recording the microdosimetric track structure in each cell, (c) clustering spatially correlated ionisation events into DNA double strand breaks and then (d) predicting the likelihood that any given cell will survive. The novelty of this model {{is its ability to}} predict both the microscopic and macroscopic outcome of radiobiology experiments while varying input parameters such as cell line, radiation type, tumour geometry, dose etc. Previous research in this area has been limited to simple water volumes as representations of cells and none have been combined into an integrated radiobiological model. Model Development Cellular Growth Model The cellular growth model consists of two parts. The first part is a geometrical and chemical description of a single cell. The second is a cellular growth model describing the growth kinetics of a group of cells. When combined, they form a simulated macroscopic cell mass composed of individual microscopic cells. A template was first designed within Geant 4 for a single cell containing properties such as cell size, nucleus dimensions, and cytoplasm composition. Cellular dimensions and composition were obtained from previous publications. The cellular growth model is a mathematical model which attempts to replicate the growth characteristics of either regular or cancerous cells. The code populates a volume of specified dimension and shape with cells of random dimension, rotation and position governed by the characteristics of a given cell line. A general requirement for Geant 4 simulations is a non-overlapping geometry. A custom algorithm was developed in the current work to ensure that the cells in the tumour geometry did not overlap before importing into Geant 4. The time required to “grow” a tumour using this code is proportional to the number of cells in the volume. The time to produce a tumour containing approximately 10 ⁵ cells is typically less than 1 hour. However, the time required to complete the irradiation stage of the code is strongly dependant on the number of cells in the tumour. To produce results in a reasonable amount of time, we were limited to using tumours containing less than 10 ⁴ cells. The position, rotation and size of each tumour were then exported to a file in a format which could be imported by our custom Geant 4 simulation. Cellular Irradiation A method called parameterisation was used inside Geant 4 to combine the single cell structure and the spatial properties of the cells (generated by the cellular growth model) to produce a cellular mass which can be irradiated virtually. To our knowledge, Geant 4 has not been used to simulate particle interactions in such a large number of complex volumes. This achievement {{is the result of the}} efficiency of the unique parameterisation code developed in this thesis. The Geant 4 particle tracking tool kit enables the cells to be irradiated with different types of radiation (such as protons, electrons, photons) and records the positions of the ionisation damage in each cell. For high LET radiation (such as heavy ions), the primary cell damage mechanism is direct ionisation damage. By recording the position and energy deposited in each ionisation event, the probability of a cell surviving or dying can be calculated. The first two stages of the code were tested by predicting and quantifying the radiosensitisation effect of cells by gold nanoparticles. Gold nanoparticles were introduced into the cellular geometries and the frequency of ionisation effects within the cells was measured. It was determined that the radiosensitisation effect of gold nanoparticles is proportional to the concentration of gold within the cell, inversely proportional to the energy of the incident photon and strongly dependant on position within the cell. When the cells were irradiated with 80 kVp x-rays, the damage to the cells was determined to be approximately 10 times that of cells irradiated without gold nanoparticles. When a typical 6 MV linear accelerator x-ray beam was used to irradiate the cells, the damage to the cells was only 1. 2 times higher that measured without gold nanoparticles. These results suggest that the primary dose enhancement effect is the result of the increase in photoelectric cross section caused by the local increase in the effective atomic number within the cell. Ionisation Clustering In order to predict the biological damage to the cells, the ionisation damage calculated in the previous two stages of the code needed to be clustered into DNA strand breakages. To cluster the ionisation events into double strand breaks, a hierarchical clustering algorithm was developed. Ionisation events are clustered into a DSB if the Euclidean distance from the centre of the DSB centroid ("centre of mass" of the cluster) is less than 3. 4 nm (length of 10 base pairs in DNA). A DSB is defined to be “simple” if the cluster contains two ionisation events. A DSB is “complex” if it contains three or more ionisation events. In typical radiotherapy treatments, several grays of radiation dose are delivered. Microscopically, this corresponds to billions or trillions of individual ionisation events. When simulated computationally, this has obvious storage and processing issues. The effects of this problem were minimised by considering only a small volume of cells (< 10 ³ cells). Even with such a small number of cells, the <b>total</b> number of <b>ionisation</b> events to process was in excess of 10 ⁷. In terms of computational time, this section of the code is highly efficient but at the expense of system resources. The large system RAM requirements mean that the code can only be executed on a 64 bit processor in its current form. DNA Repair Model The basis for the DNA repair model in the current work is the two lesion kinetics (TLK) model. In the current work we have expanded on the TLK model and implemented it as a method of describing the repair of the ionisation damages produced in Geant 4. The most notable improvement lies in implementing the model on a cell by cell basis instead of modelling the repair kinetics as an average of all cells in the volume (e. g. a tumour). The DNA repair model was calibrated and tested using experimental data for V 79 Chinese hamster cells irradiated with 0. 76 and 1. 9 MeV proton radiation. Once calibrated, the experimental and calculated values for cell survival were in good agreement (< 7 % difference). Cross Section Verification The validity and accuracy of the Geant 4 cross sectional data was tested by comparing simulated and experimental data. Geant 4 has been shown to be able to simulate radiation interactions of very low energy particles (to approximately ~ 1 eV (debated)). However, our investigation (and previous publications) has shown differences of up to ± 30 % (between simulated and experimental data) in the differential cross section of electrons and protons at energies below 100 eV. Our investigation also revealed a similar discrepancy with other comparable Monte Carlo packages including PARTRAC and RITRACKS. However, within the energy range we have investigated throughout this research, there is good agreement between both experimental data and data predicted by other MC packages. Effect of Indirect Radiation Damages on Cellular Survival To investigate the contribution from indirect damages in our previous studies, a MC software package called RITRACKS was used which is capable of simulating the production yields of free radical species due to the physical interactions of ionising radiation in water. Utilising the clustering algorithm and DNA repair model from our previous Geant 4 investigation, we attempted to quantify the cellular lethality of direct and indirect radiation damages. Our study has shown that for particles with LET ~ 1000 keV/μm (50 MeV/amu ⁵⁶Fe ions, the contribution to DNA damage from indirect damages is still approximately 50 %. Conclusion A comprehensive radiobiological simulation has been developed capable of predicting the complex ionisation track structure of ionising radiation (e. g. photons, protons and carbon ions) through individual cells. Subsequently, predicting the biological outcome within individual cells by tracking the formation and repair of DNA strand breaks. The capabilities of the software have been demonstrated for use in novel radiotherapy treatment techniques. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Adelaide, School of Chemistry and Physics, 201...|$|R

The particle content of the Earth’s magnetosphere is studied with electron and ion detectors in various energy ranges, from the cold and dense eV solar wind to the MeV radiation belts. Here, the in situ high-energy (50 keV to 725 keV) electron measurement is targeted. The design and development of space embedded electronic equipment require a specific approach.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the phenomenon of}} high harmonic generation from atoms irradiated by intense, ultrashort laser pulses. Particular {{attention is paid to}} the benefits achieved by using multicolour driving fields. A theoretical description of few-cycle laser pulses is presented, together with their interaction with free-electrons and the role they play in various nonlinear optical processes. A number of numerical models are presented to simulate high harmonic generation from atomic systems. These are used to analyse and explain the temporal structure of the emitted high-frequency dipole radiation. Propagation of the macroscopic harmonic response through a gaseous volume is modelled and the role of phase-matching explained in detail. We consider focussing geometry in optimising the yield of particular harmonics, together with the effects of free-electrons within the interaction region. We discuss means by which multicolour fields may overcome some of the constraints of single-colour high harmonic generation. Using two delayed pulses of the same frequency and parallel polarisation we demonstrate significant cut-off extension without increasing <b>total</b> <b>ionisation</b> throughout the pulse, crucial for maintaining harmonic yield close to the saturation limit. We also explain the significant yield enhancements observed in recent experiments using two parallel colours of incommensurate frequency. Finally, we describe the use of a second, perpendicularly polarised colour in trajectory selection, allowing for a temporal filtering of harmonic emission. Using an ω + 1. 5 ω frequency ratio also allows for a reduction in the periodicity of emitted attosecond pulse trains, permitting the production of isolated attosecond pulses with longer driving fields. Furthermore, by controlling the relative phase between the two colours, the ellipticity of these attosecond pulses may also be controlled.

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{experiment}} described in this thesis was to generate a molecular beam of thymine and to investigate the fragmentation processes induced by low-energy electron impact. A molecular beam of thymine is generated by placing thymine in powder form inside a resistively heated oven. The beam of thymine is then crossed by a pulsed electron beam from an electron gun that consists of four electrostatic lens elements and a deflection system for steering the beam. A reflectron time-of-flight mass spectrometer with a microchannel plate detector is used to detect and mass resolve the positively charged fragments. LabVIEW based data acquisition techniques are used to accumulate the time-of-flight data {{as a function of}} electron impact energy. The work described in this thesis is based on a single data set of thymine with electric impact energy varied from 0. 5 to 99. 7 eV in steps of 0. 5 V. To determine the yield of the various fragment ions, groups of peaks were fitted with a sequence of normalised Gaussian peaks using a specially developed LabVIEW program. Using this program the fitting of the peaks was done automatically for all electron energies. Excitation functions for the most positively ionised fragments have been extracted/or determine and their appearance energies have been determined and compared to current research on thymine. Because all excitation functions have been generated from this single data set and assuming that the detection efficiency of the RTOFMS is mass independent, the yield of all fragments are on the same relative scale and are comparable. <b>Total</b> <b>ionisation</b> cross sections have been obtained for our data set and are in good agreement with theoretical calculations...|$|E
40|$|An L 2 {{expansion}} of Yamani and Reinhardt [I 975] which employs non-orthogonal, square integrable functions of Laguerre type {{is used to}} approximate Coulomb wave functions of continuum and bound states. The convergence of L 2 approximations to continuum and bound states is investigated in the hydrogenic case. The connection between the L 2 approximation and pseudo states is derived by studying the completeness relation for the exact states and the quadrature approximations. Corresponding equivalent weights are shown {{to be related to}} a Gaussian quadrature derived from attractive-Coulomb Pollaczek polynomials. Gaussian quadrature rules that are satisfied are calculated numerically. The use of pseudo states in the close-coupling equations is discussed especially in relation to the Poet [1978] model which gives a highly accurate solution for a simplified model of electron-hydrogen collisions in which only s-wave hydrogen target states are admitted. The convergence of channel potentials which contribute to the close-coupling equations is then examined and discussed the convergence of pseudostate Born amplitudes is studied as a further test in obtaining a good pseudo-state set. In addition, the convergence rate of the L 2 approximation to the bound-bound, bound-free channel and free-free channel potentials is examined. The bound-bound, bound-free potentials are shown to converge geometrically while the free-free potentials have very slow convergence. In order to examine the effect of convergence rates several detailed models are employed and compared with the full Poet calculations. Elastic, discrete inelastic, <b>total</b> <b>ionisation</b> and inelastic cross-sections are presented for the energy interval 1. 0 to 3. 5 Rydbergs. Triplet scattering is reproduced excellently. Singlet scattering displays minor pseudo-resonance structure for the largest (10 basis set) calculations. Weak coupling approximations are examined. They perform very well in triplet scattering but decidedly less well for the singlet channel...|$|E
40|$|In this work, a magnetically {{confined}} e beam was crossed with a gas jet {{to study}} ionisation of Ne, Kr and Xe atoms. Ions {{produced in the}} overlap of the beams were detected in coincidence with the scattered projectile, so as to discriminate against ionisation events involving positronium (Ps) formation. The single ionisation cross section (#sigma#_i"+) and {{the ratio of the}} double to single ionisation cross sections (R_ 2) were measured for each target from near threshold to 1 keV. By multiplying the R_ 2 values by the appropriate #sigma#_i"+, double ionisation cross section (#sigma#_i" 2 "+) data were also obtained. Comparisons were made with existing data for He and Ar and for e"-, p"+ and p"- impact, to investigate the effects of the projectile mass and charge and the target atomic number (Z). The ratio between #sigma#_i"+ maxima for e"+ and e"- was generally found to be lower for targets with higher Z, whereas no such effect was observed for p"+ and p"-. This might be due to the deflection of the light projectiles by the target nucleus. In contrast to the charge dependence exhibited by low Z targets, R_ 2 (e"+) and R_ 2 (e"-) for Xe were found to have merged at high velocities. This is thought to be due to the increasing importance of inner-shell ionisation followed by Auger decay for heavier atoms. An atomic hydrogen source was incorporated into the system for the investigation of e"+ impact ionisation of H. The <b>total</b> <b>ionisation</b> cross section (#sigma#_T"+), including contributions from both direct ionisation and Ps formation, was measured by extracting ions randomly. The Ps formation cross section (#sigma#_P_s) of H was then determined from these measurements by subtraction of #sigma#_i"+ data. Two recent theoretical calculations, generally considered to be the most reliable thus far, are found to be in agreement with the results for #sigma#_P_s over the entire energy range investigated. The present measurements also differentiate between two prior conflicting measurements of #sigma#_P_s, thus providing a degree of consensus amongst experimental data.

40|$|A capacitively coupled {{rf plasma}} is {{investigated}} {{in the context}} of the heating mechanisms that sustain it under various conditions. These mechanisms are critically dependent on gas pressure, applied rf potential, rf current and discharge gap. Pressure ranges of 10 to 300 mTorr and rf potentials from a few Volts to several hundred Volts are investigated. The argon plasma is generated in two capacitively coupled rf systems. Plasma parameters are measured using a Langmuir probe. A microwave interferometer is used to compare density measurements with that of the probe. A current voltage monitor is used to measure the voltage, current and phase for the purpose of relating the control parameters to the plasma parameters. The design and construction of a retarding field energy analyser is presented. Plasma potential measurements using the analyser are compared with that of the Langmuir probe. Use of the analyser in electron collection mode has revealed a higher electron temperature behind the rf sheath than that measured by the Langmuir probe in the plasma. Transitions in the heating modes are investigated via plasma parameter and Electron Energy Probability Function (EEPF) measurement in the centre of the discharge. Particular attention is paid to the a-y transition. The relationship between the current voltage characteristic and the plasma parameters is considered. Pressure effects on the transition are determined. A model of the diffusion process in the capacitive rf discharge is devised and the resulting density profiles checked against known analytic solutions of the diffusion equation. A procedure to extract the ionisation profiles from experimental density measurements is devised using this model and a reconstruction algorithm. The twodimensional evolution of density and ionisation profiles is presented at low and high discharge powers over the 10 mTorr to 300 mTorr range. The <b>total</b> <b>ionisation</b> rate is compared with the theoretical ionisation rate calculated using simple particle balance equations. Disagreement in the ionisation rates is attributed to the use of unrealistic models and the assumption of uniform electron energy in the discharge. Spatially resolved EEPF measurements are made along the discharge axis. Rate coefficients for ionisation are calculated by integrating the product of the measured EEPF and the cross section for ionisation. Spatially resolved ionisation rates obtained from the coefficients are in good agreement with the measured ionisation rate profiles generated using the diffusion model and reconstruction algorithm...|$|E
