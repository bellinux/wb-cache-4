5|$|After {{the war he}} {{was offered}} a {{permanent}} commission, which he initially accepted. Having resigned his commission in March 1946 he re-enlisted briefly. After struggling to find a career that would support his family, Braham emigrated to Canada {{with his family and}} enlisted in the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) in 1952. Having held office at the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe Braham retired from military life and began working as a civilian for the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development. He continued to work there until his death from an undiagnosed brain <b>tumor</b> <b>in</b> 1974, aged 53.|$|E
5|$|Diagnosed {{with a brain}} <b>tumor</b> <b>in</b> March 2017, Noriega {{suffered}} complications during surgery, {{and died}} two months later. Generally described as a military dictatorship, Noriega's rule in Panama was marked by repression of the media, {{an expansion of the}} military, and the persecution of political opponents, effectively controlling the outcomes of any elections. He was known for his complicated relationship with the U.S., being described as being its ally and nemesis at the same time. He has been called one of the best-known dictators of his time, and compared to authoritarian rulers such as Muammar Gaddafi and Augusto Pinochet.|$|E
50|$|Ethylbenzene is {{classified}} as a possible carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) however, the EPA has not determined ethylbenzene to be a carcinogen. The National Toxicology Program conducted an inhalation study in rats and mice. Exposure to ethylbenzene resulted in an increased incidence of kidney and testicular <b>tumors</b> <b>in</b> male rats, and trends of increased kidney <b>tumors</b> <b>in</b> female rats, lung <b>tumors</b> <b>in</b> male mice, and liver <b>tumors</b> <b>in</b> female mice.|$|R
40|$|Primary liver <b>tumors</b> <b>in</b> {{children}} are not rare, and the incidence of malignant liver <b>tumors</b> <b>in</b> children ranks third of all malignant abdominal <b>tumors</b> <b>in</b> children, with the features of {{a high rate of}} malignancy, a high incidence of congenital tumors, and a specific age of onset. Liver <b>tumors</b> <b>in</b> children often have no specific clinical manifestations, with an insidious onset, a large volume of tumor lesion, various pathological types, and complicated locations, which makes them more difficult to treat compared with liver <b>tumors</b> <b>in</b> adults. This article reviews the imaging diagnosis of liver <b>tumors</b> <b>in</b> children and points out that with the rapid development of imaging medicine, imaging examination provides an important reference for clarifying the location of liver tumors, identifying benign or malignant tumors, and determining tumor stage...|$|R

5|$|Hennessey {{was drafted}} by the San Francisco Giants {{in the first round}} (21st overall) of the 2001 Major League Baseball draft. He began his career with the Salem-Keizer Volcanoes of the Single-A short season Northwest League, where he had a 10 record, a 2.38 ERA, 22 strikeouts, and 34 innings pitched in nine starts. That year, Salem-Keizer won the Northwest League championship. While {{pitching}} in an instructional league later that year, Hennessey began experiencing soreness that was initially attributed to a muscle strain but {{turned out to be a}} non-cancerous <b>tumor</b> <b>in</b> his back. He had it removed in February 2002, but it grew back later that season, and he missed the entire year while undergoing a second surgery.|$|E
5|$|In June 2014, a <b>tumor</b> <b>in</b> his {{bile duct}} was {{discovered}} during a routine physical exam. It was removed, and Iwata {{returned to work}} in October of that year. The issue resurfaced in 2015, and Iwata {{died at the age}} of 55 from its complications on July 11. Members of the gaming industry and fans alike expressed their despair over his death through public announcements and social media, and fans worldwide established temporary memorials. Iwata was posthumously granted the Lifetime Achievement Award at both the 2015 Golden Joystick Awards and the 2016 DICE Awards.|$|E
5|$|The Indian Field has {{baseball}} and softball fields, a sandbox, picnic tables, tennis courts, horseshoes courts, and shuffleboard courts.

50|$|DDD {{is in the}} “Group B2” classification, {{meaning that}} it is a {{probable}} human carcinogen. This is based on an increased incidence of lung <b>tumors</b> <b>in</b> male and female mice, liver <b>tumors</b> <b>in</b> male mice, and thyroid <b>tumors</b> <b>in</b> male rats. Further basis is that DDD is so similar to and is a metabolite of DDT, another probable human carcinogen.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Malignant <b>tumors</b> <b>in</b> {{children}} are rare but serious conditions {{as they can}} impair function and survival. <b>Tumors</b> <b>in</b> pediatric patients can originate from the orbit.

5|$|He also {{experienced}} stomach disease, having a low production of gastric acids. This was worsened by harsh military conditions, including long periods with little food. The first {{references to the}} disease {{that would lead to}} his death, a case of edema, are from a year before, in a letter directed to Álvarez Thomas. He declared having problems in the chest, a lung, and his right leg. A later letter to Sarratea confirmed his situation, and specified that it started on 23 April 1819. The gravity of his condition led the doctor Francisco de Paula Rivero to diagnose an advanced dropsy. Belgrano returned to Buenos Aires, where he died. He was embalmed by Joseph Redhead and Juan Sullivan. Sullivan performed the autopsy; it revealed high levels of fluid in multiple edemas and a <b>tumor</b> <b>in</b> the right epigastrium. The liver and spleen had grown beyond normal levels, there were hamartomas in the kidneys, and problems with the lungs and heart.|$|E
5|$|In 1967, Sayers and Bears {{teammate}} Brian Piccolo {{became the}} first interracial roommates in the NFL. Sayers' ensuing friendship with Piccolo and Piccolo's struggle with cancer (embryonal cell carcinoma, which was diagnosed after it metastasized to a large <b>tumor</b> <b>in</b> his chest cavity), {{became the subject of}} the made-for-TV movie Brian's Song. The movie, in which Sayers was portrayed by Billy Dee Williams in the 1971 original and by Mekhi Phifer in the 2001 remake, was adapted from Sayers' account of this story in his 1970 autobiography, I Am Third. A notable aspect of Sayers' friendship with Piccolo, a white man, and the first film's depiction of their friendship, was its effect on race relations. The first film was made in the wake of racial riots, escalating racial tensions fueled by Martin Luther King's assassination, and charges of discrimination across the nation. Sayers and Piccolo were devoted friends and deeply respectful of and affectionate with each other. Piccolo helped Sayers through rehabilitation after injury, and Sayers was by Piccolo's side throughout his illness until his death in June 1970.|$|E
5|$|Terhune donated {{some of the}} {{earnings}} from the magazine stories to the Red Cross and Blue Cross in Lad's name, earning the collie the Honorary Crosses of both groups. When Lad was fifteen, he lost his hearing, after which the other dogs in residence began ignoring him and vice versa. Lad died on September 3, 1918, having had a <b>tumor</b> <b>in</b> his heart for five years before his death. Lad's obituary was carried on a multi-page spread of the September 14, 1918 issue of Field and Fancy magazine. He was buried near the driveway of Sunnybank, with the Honorary Crosses he was awarded. He was mourned by thousands of fans who had read Terhune's stories, with dozens of readers, primarily children, visiting Sunnybank to see Lad's grave. In one season, over 1,700 visitors came to see Lad's grave, prompting Terhune to close the place to visitors for the day.|$|E
30|$|There {{are some}} rare reports of extrahepatic HCC without primary hepatic parenchymal lesions [2, 11]; hence, the bile duct <b>tumors</b> <b>in</b> this case might be new HCC lesions. However, the bile duct <b>tumors</b> <b>in</b> this case were {{considered}} recurrence {{because of the}} morphological similarities and venous invasion. Furthermore, most cases of primary extrahepatic HCC are continuous and localized masses [12], whereas the <b>tumors</b> <b>in</b> this case are extensively distinct and scattered.|$|R

40|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} {{interest in the}} use of small fish models for detecting potential environmental carcinogens. In this study, both guppies (Poecilia reticulata) and medaka (Oryzias latipes) were exposed in the aquaria water to three known rodent carcinogens for up to 16 months. Nitromethane, which caused mammary gland tumors by inhalation exposure in female rats, harderian gland and lung <b>tumors</b> <b>in</b> male and female mice, and liver <b>tumors</b> <b>in</b> female mice by inhalation, failed to increase <b>tumors</b> <b>in</b> either guppies or medaka. Propanediol, which when given in the feed was a multisite carcinogen in both sexes of rats and mice, caused increased liver <b>tumors</b> <b>in</b> male guppies and male medaka. There was reduced survival in female guppies and no increased <b>tumors</b> <b>in</b> female medaka. 1, 2, 3 -Trichloropropane, which when administered by oral gavage was a multisite carcin-ogen in both sexes of rats and mice, caused an increased incidenc...|$|R

40|$|In this study, we {{examined}} the prevalence, pathology, and epidemiology of <b>tumors</b> <b>in</b> free-ranging island foxes occurring on three islands in the California Channel Islands, USA. We found a remarkably high prevalence of ceruminous gland <b>tumors</b> <b>in</b> endangered foxes (Uro-cyon littoralis catalinae) occurring on Santa Catalina Island (SCA) — 48. 9 % of the dead foxes examined from 2001 – 2008 had <b>tumors</b> <b>in</b> their ears, and <b>tumors</b> were found <b>in</b> 52. 2 % of randomly-selected mature (4 years) foxes captured in 2007 – 2008, representing {{one of the highest}} prevalences of <b>tumors</b> ever documented <b>in</b> a wildlife population. <b>In</b> contrast, no <b>tumors</b> were detected <b>in</b> foxes from San Nicolas Island or San Clemente Island, although ear mites (Otodectes cynotis), a predisposing factor for ceruminous gland <b>tumors</b> <b>in</b> dogs and cats, were highly prevalent on all three islands. On SCA, otitis externa secondary to ear mite infection was highly correlated with ceruminous gland hyperplasia (CGH), and tumors were significantly associated with the severity of CGH, ceruminous gland dysplasia, and age group (older foxes). We propose a conceptual model for the formation of ceruminous gland <b>tumors</b> <b>in</b> foxes on SCA that is based on persistent, ubiquitous infection with ea...|$|R
