40|$|<b>The</b> {{acetylation}} <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> lysine residues in nucleosomes, {{which are}} determined by the opposing activities of histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and deacetylases, {{play an important role in}} regulating chromatin-related processes, including transcription. We report that HMGN 1, a nucleosomal binding protein that reduces the compaction of the chromatin fiber, increases <b>the</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> acetylation of K 14 in H 3. <b>The</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> H 3 K 14 ac in Hmgn 1 −/− cells are lower than in Hmgn 1 +/+ cells.

40|$|Abstract. Generalized {{forms of}} {{meningococcal}} infection (GFMI) are usually accompanied with apparent symptoms of systemic inflammatory response (SIRS). Systemic production of inflammatory cytokines, their accumulation in circulating blood and action on various organs and tissues represent a crucial constituent of SIRS. Current study explored <b>the</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> soluble receptor of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) p 55, TNF, neutrophil-derived alpha-defensins (HNP) and both isoforms of Interleukin- 8 (IL- 872 and IL- 877) {{in blood and}} cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from children with GFMI. <b>The</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> cytokines were estimated using "sandwich" enzyme-linked immunoassays emploing monoclonal antibodies to corresponding cytokines that were previously developed in our laboratory. It was shown that <b>the</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> p 55 in the blood correlated with severity of SIRS and GFMI, while <b>the</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> HNP (human neut rophil peptides) in CSF may serve as more sensitive marker of inflammation since HNP levels decreased more rapidly during a recovery of disease comparing to p 55.

40|$|Abstract. The {{antitumor}} {{effect of}} natural killer T cells {{has been reported}} in several studies analyzing the expression of CD 1 d on antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Therefore, the present study questioned whether APCs may be abnormal in the peripheral blood (PB) of acute leukemia (AL) patients, particularly <b>the</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> CD 1 d. To improve the understanding of the role of CD 1 d on APCs, <b>the</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> CD 1 d on mono-cytes were analyzed in healthy controls, AL patients and AL patients with complete remission (CR). In addition, the corre-lation between the number of CD 3 +CD 56 + T lymphocytes and <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> CD 1 d on monocytes was analyzed. Flow cytometry was used to determine <b>the</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> CD 1 d on monocytes and lymphocytes. A significant decrease was observed in <b>the</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> CD 1 d on monocytes in the PB of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients compared with the healthy controls. Simultaneously, signifi-cantly different <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> CD 1 d on monocytes were identified between the CR-AML and the CR-ALL patients; <b>the</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> CD 1 d on monocytes remained low in the CR-AML patients, while <b>the</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> CD 1 d on monocytes recovered in the CR-ALL patients. A significantly negative correlation was observed between the number of CD 3 +CD 56 + T lymphocytes and <b>the</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> CD 1 d on monocytes in AL patients. However, a significantly positive correlation was identified between the cytotoxicity of the CD 3 +CD 56 + T lymphocytes and <b>the</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> CD 1 d on monocytes.

40|$|AIMS: To {{investigate}} the potential predictive value of cathepsins B, D and K {{in a series}} of 51 adamantinomatous craniopharyngiomas. While almost always benign, craniopharyngiomas exhibit a high propensity to recur postsurgically and biological markers are therefore needed to predict their recurrence. We have previously demonstrated the potential predictive value of retinoic acid receptors (RARs) (Lefranc et al. J. Neurosurg. 2003; 98; 145 - 153). METHODS AND RESULTS: Computer-assisted microscopy was used to determine quantitatively <b>the</b> immunohistochemical <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> expression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> alpha, beta and gamma RAR subtypes and cathepsins B, D and K. <b>The</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> expression of cathepsin D and of cathepsin B correlated significantly with <b>the</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> expression <b>of</b> RARbeta. <b>The</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> expression of cathepsin K correlated significantly with <b>the</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> expression of RARgamma. CONCLUSIONS: Recurrent adamantinomatous craniopharyngiomas are characterized by low <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> RARbeta and high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> RARgamma. <b>The</b> tendency to recurrence seems, at least partly, to relate to the fact that (i) craniopharyngiomas with low <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> RARbeta express low <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> cathepsin D, and (ii) craniopharyngiomas with high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> RARgamma express high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> cathepsin K.

The present investigation was carried out to establish the protective effect of natansnin, a novel dibenzoyl glycoside from Salvinia natans against CCl 4 induced oxidative stress and cellular degeneration in rat liver. Results CCl 4 significantly increased <b>the</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> lipid peroxides, oxidized glutathione and decreased <b>the</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> reduced glutathione, SOD and CAT. CCl 4 induce marked histopathological changes and increase in <b>the</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> apoptotic proteins. CCl 4 treatment significantly increased <b>the</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> apoptotic proteins such as caspases- 3, PARP, Bax, Bid and cytochrome C and also increased <b>the</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> inflammatory mediators iNos and Cox- 2.

Conclusions In conclusion, our study demonstrated the protective effect of natansnin against CCl 4 induced oxidative stress and cellular degeneration in rat liver tissue.
