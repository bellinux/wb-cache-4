The {{results show that}} drill pipe’s failure reason is the "martensite " white bright layer in its out-surface caused by intense friction in drilling process. Under the effect of torque and tensile loads, lots of cracks initiated in the white bright layer and developed along the vertical. In the end, when its tensile capacity was less than the weight of drilling string, drill pipe fractured along the horizontal.

5000|$|The Abia State born travel enthusiast, whose {{dressing}} {{is incomplete}} without a hat or a neck scarf, {{is a very}} well traveled person, traveling close to 200 days in a year. He was editor of Tourism Factfinders, a book on Nigeria published to mark Nigeria's hosting of The Organization of African Unity (OAU) summit in 1991. In 1991 to 1992 he was tourism editor of Happy Land, Happy World tourist Guide. Happy Land, Happy World was the Nigerian version of Disneyland, Disney World, a project that did not materialize when its Certificate of Occupancy was revoked by the Lagos State Government. Realizing the lack of literature that deeply documents the unique festive celebrations in Nigeria, in 1998 he published Festivals In Nigeria in collaboration with The Nigerian Tourism Development Corporation (NTDC). His passion for traveling and adventures {{led him to the}} publication of Travelers Weekend Magazine, a weekly magazine in 1996, along which he launched Travelers Awards. Travelers Weekend was the first regular travel magazine in West Africa. With the aim for the magazine to set the pace and to be Africa’s forerunner in the travel world, in 2003 Travelers Weekend Magazine was rebranded as African Travel Quarterly (ATQ). In 2004 he launched Travelers Awards and Exhibitions, the first attempt at introducing an exhibition into the <b>travel</b> <b>environment.</b> In 2005, Travelers Awards and Exhibition was rebranded as Akwaaba African Travel Market. Akwaaba African Travel Market is the only international travel fair in West Africa. With participation from international dealers in travel, tourism, aviation and the hospitality industries, it is regarded as [...] "’Where Africa meets the world". Akwaaba African Travel Market is designated by the Nigerian Tourism Development Corporation (NTDC) as the official travel exhibition in Nigeria. It is the only international travel expo in West Africa in partnership with NTDC, listed by United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), a partner event for African Business Travel Association (ABTA) in West Africa, partner event with National Association of Nigerian Travel Agencies (NANTA) and the only member of International Tourism Trade Fairs Association (ITTFA).|$|E

40|$|Generally, {{travel is}} {{considered}} a demand derived from the desire to engage in activities at destinations and travel time is also considered a wasteful time. However, if people can engage in activities while travelling, travel time {{is not just a}} wasteful time but could be a productive time. In recent years, ICTs provide travellers with various activity opportunities while travelling. This paper examined what activities train commuters were engaging in while travelling and what factors of <b>travel</b> <b>environment</b> and passengers' characteristics caused the difference in activities conducted and desired. Through on-board observation and questionnaire surveys, we found that difference in travelling mode (standing, sitting in normal/high-grade/extra-high-grade trains), the length of in-vehicle time and type of work hours affected the participation rate of different types of activities. Train environment with wider personal space and more secure privacy would induce activities restricted in the current <b>travel</b> <b>environment</b> and some commuters prefer to pay extra money to obtain it.

Video8 also has an advantage in terms of time, because although VHS-C offers the same [...] "palmcorder" [...] size as Video8, the VHS-C tapes only hold, at most, 45 minutes of tape in SP speed. Thus, Video8's 120-minute capacity served well for most users during its peak.

40|$|Short {{distance}} {{trips are}} defined as any trips shorter {{than or equal to}} 5 kilometers, which {{have been found to be}} a big contributor to the traffic congestion problem. This paper is intended to analyze factors that influence the mode choice of short distance travels in order to help reduce short distance trips by cars. A survey is conducted at two typical kinds of residential areas, one with a high proportion of short distance car trips and another one with a low proportion. Then, by applying the structural equation modeling, it is found that the age, the household income, and the vehicle ownerships have a significant effect on the mode choice of short distance travels. Besides, among residents of the same type (same age, household income, and vehicle ownerships) in surveyed areas, those in the area with a better green-mode <b>travel</b> <b>environment</b> account for a higher proportion choosing the green mode than those in other areas. Based on this result, it is concluded that a better green-mode <b>travel</b> <b>environment</b> leads to a higher proportion of green-mode travels.

40|$|This {{paper is}} derived from an {{unpublished}} D. Phil thesis: "Unplanned Wayfinding in Path-Networks: A Theoretical Study of Human Problem-Solving (Gotts 1988). It is {{a modified version of}} those parts of the thesis most relevant to the design of wayfinding aids such as variable message signs (VMS) and in-vehicle route-guidance information (IVRGI) systems. This paper, however, does not itself discuss such wayfinding aids; rather, it is a step toward understanding the problem-solving strategies and the internal representations ofthe environment human wayfinders use in the absence of aids of these types. The paper is theoretical in nature, but suggestions are made for empirical tests of some of the hypotheses put forward. Without an understanding of common wayfinding strategies and the internal representations underlying them, efforts to design genuinely useful wayfinding aids are bound to be groping in the dark: at best, they may be shown to be useful in a specific network, to a specific group of people, under given circumstances - with no guarantee that this usefulness will transfer to other networks, travellers, or circumstances. Understanding the route-choice behaviour of road-users requires consideration of the information about the <b>travel</b> <b>environment</b> available to them. An assumption of perfect information about the layout of the <b>travel</b> <b>environment</b> and the traffic conditions within it is a convenient simplification - but is also wholly unrealistic.

40|$|The {{past few}} years have {{witnessed}} an impressive progress in the capabilities of travel information services. It is expected {{that in a few}} years, travelers will be constantly informed, pre-trip as well as en-route, about their optimal departure time, route and transport mode. The information is based on a careful monitoring of the transport network as well as travelers' personal preferences and schedules. Traffic jams, train delays and the like will no longer be unpleasant surprises. Unfortunately, our knowledge concerning how travelers will respond to this stream of increasingly advanced information seriously lags behind these technological advances themselves. A number of important questions have not been addressed adequately yet: To what extent do travelers actually use information available to them? Are they able to deal in an intelligent way with the immense complexity that is associated with travel in nowadays dense and multimodal transport networks? This dissertation answers these and other questions by integrating theories from the fields of microeconomics, psychology, marketing and transportation into mathematical models of traveler behavior. Subsequently, a computer-based <b>travel</b> <b>environment</b> is developed that simulates actual travel situations (involving for example time pressure, traffic jams and train delays). By observing the behavior of hundreds of participants to an experiment using the artificial <b>travel</b> <b>environment,</b> a unique dataset is obtained. Advanced econometrical analyses of the data show that the developed theoretical models form an adequate description of actual traveler behavior. And more importantly, they suggest that travelers are pretty good at dealing intelligently with complex travel situations and sophisticated information services.
