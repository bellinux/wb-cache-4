25|$|Since {{classical}} times, it {{has been}} noted that peace has sometimes been achieved by the victor over the vanquished by the imposition of ruthless measures. In his book Agricola the Roman historian Tacitus includes eloquent and vicious polemics against the rapacity and greed of Rome. One, that Tacitus says is by the Caledonian chieftain Calgacus, ends Auferre trucidare rapere falsis nominibus imperium, atque ubi solitudinem faciunt, pacem appellant. (To ravage, to slaughter, to usurp under false titles, they call empire; and where they make a desert, <b>they</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> peace. — Oxford Revised Translation).|$|E

25|$|Territorial {{expansion}} of the Luhya people (the western neighbours of the Terik) has strained Terik-Luhyia relations during the last decades. Luhya are felt {{to be a threat}} to the Terik identity and intermarriage has drastically reduced. The {{expansion of}} the Luhya (especially the Logoli group) into Terik territory has been a cause of population pressure. This, along with dwindling agricultural potential in the area, has {{in the second half of}} the twentieth century motivated many of the Terik to move eastwards, into 'Nandiland' as <b>they</b> <b>call</b> <b>it.</b> Some Terik even claim that they abandoned their homeland because they were afraid of the Luhya.|$|E
25|$|In 1976, Morinobu Endo of CNRS {{observed}} hollow {{tubes of}} rolled up graphite sheets synthesised by a chemical vapour-growth technique. The first specimens observed would later {{come to be}} known as single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs). Endo, in his early review of vapor-phase-grown carbon fibers (VPCF), also reminded us that he had observed a hollow tube, linearly extended with parallel carbon layer faces near the fiber core. This appears to be the observation of multi-walled carbon nanotubes at the center of the fiber. The mass-produced MWCNTs today are strongly related to the VPGCF developed by Endo. In fact, <b>they</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> the “Endo-process”, out of respect for his early work and patents.|$|E
25|$|Settled {{mostly by}} American {{migrants}} from New York and New England, Monroe later became associated with {{events in the}} West in the later 19th century, particularly the Indian Wars. It {{is known as the}} childhood home of Major General George Armstrong Custer (1839–1876). His family moved here when he was young, and he lived in Monroe for much of his childhood. Here he later met and in 1864 married Elizabeth Bacon (1842–1933), during the Civil War. He led troops in the Indian Wars and died at the Battle of the Little Bighorn, in which his forces were killed by the Lakota. <b>They</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> the Battle of the Greasy Grass.|$|E

500|$|In the DVD {{commentary}} for the episode, Scully {{stated that}} he regretted not submitting [...] "Simpsons Bible Stories" [...] for the Primetime Emmy Award {{in the category of}} animated programming less than one hour in 1999. At the time, Scully reasoned that, because the original stories were not conceived by the writing staff, the episode would not hold up. However, he noted that the episode's animation was [...] "outstanding", and that he later found out that the Emmy awards [...] "put a lot of importance on" [...] the animation in submitted episodes.

500|$|In a 1999 {{documentary}} {{celebrating the}} original album, Meat Loaf says that Bat Out of Hell polarizes people: some hate it, and some worship it. The bombast {{did not meet}} some critics' approval. As with the first album, Rolling Stone gave the album a mixed review. <b>They</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> [...] "harmless, low-octane operatic drivel" [...] with [...] "insufferably long Steinman compositions with equally long names." [...] Non-specialist publications gave the most negative reviews. The Fort Worth Star-Telegram also referred {{to the length of}} the songs, in which Steinman [...] "vomits up 75 minutes of endlessly repeated choruses." [...] The newspaper branded it [...] "the worst pop album of 1993." [...] The Des Moines Register thought that the album was [...] "wallowing in excess so gratuitous as to make Michael Bolton, by comparison, seem a master of understatement... Mountains of banshee-like wailing guitars! Thunderous drums! Herniated vocals! Profoundly stupid lyrics! Gack. This isn't pandering to the lowest common denominator—it's lowering the lowest common denominator." ...|$|E
