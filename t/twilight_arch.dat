40|$|I {{first met}} Michael Gadsden {{in the late}} 1970 s when he visited our Upper Atmospheric Group at Southampton University, UK. At that time I was a new {{graduate}} student studying for my Ph. D. under Pamela Rothwell. Mike (as I was later privileged to call him) was interested in developing a collaborative program to study polarization in noctilucent clouds (NLC) using our low-light video cameras. Of course at that time I had {{never even heard of}} noctilucent clouds but what an impression he made on us all! Within a couple of months I found myself heading north for Scotland, with my car packed full of video gear, eager to learn all about these fascinating night shining clouds that only occur during the summer months at higher latitudes. True to his nature, Mike gave me the “royal tour” of the ancient city of Aberdeen and its famous university, introducing me to the faculty in the Department of Natural Philosophy as a “heathen from the south” (you have to say it with a Scottish accent) who had “come north for the summer to gain a decent education!” We set up our cameras at the majestic Cromwell Tower Observatory, located in Kings College in the oldest part of the university (circa 1400 AD). Mike had recently refurbished this abandoned observatory and after several weeks of tutoring me while waiting for the Scottish skies to clear, we were eventually rewarded with a wonderful NLC display. It was a most impressive event that lit up the northern sky late at night, with many beautiful iridescent blue-white waves illuminated within the <b>twilight</b> <b>arch.</b> I savored this eerie yet tranquil time, and as the display grew in brightness, it was soon accompanied by a chorus of birds singing as they were tricked by this “false dawn”. I was firmly hooked! Moreover, we gained our first data on circular polarization in NLC on this night and Mike swiftly prepared a letter for publication in Nature [Gadsden, Rothwell, Taylor, 1979. Nature 278]. Therein began a wonderful relation with Mike, first as a mentor and later as a colleague and dear friend...|$|E
40|$|Noctilucent {{clouds are}} very tenuous clouds {{that appear in}} the high {{latitude}} mesosphere during the summer 1. They are seen by scattering of sunlight from cloud particles near the mesopause. They {{are known to be}} at altitudes of ~ 82 km, more than 50 km higher than the next highest clouds in the atmosphere, the nacreous or mother-of-pearl clouds. They are usually seen after midnight in June and July in the north-east <b>twilight</b> <b>arch</b> at latitudes of 55 – 65 ° and appear silvery-blue 2 in the red twilight glow. Observations have been made from ground level 3, 4, rocket 5 and satellites 6, 7. Studies of sunlight scattered from the clouds have concentrated on measurements of polarisation of the scattered light to allow estimates of the size distribution of the cloud particles to be made. These estimates agree in that only submicron particles with an upper radius limit in the range 0. 05 – 0. 3 µm are present. Recent measurements 4 of scattered light have shown the presence of a small proportion of circular polarisation, indicating that the cloud particles are probably non-spherical, and estimates of the particle size, being {{based on the assumption that}} scattering is from homogeneous spheres (Mie scattering), may need revision. The revision might be enough to force reappraisal of the amount of water condensed to form the clouds and consequent reappraisal of the relative humidity in this part of the atmosphere. A small amount of circular polarisation can be produced in the scattering of natural (unpolarised) light from elongated particles 8 but a greater proportion of circular polarisation will arise if the incident light is partly polarised and if the axes of the elongated particles show some directional preference. However, light scattered from spherical particles will also show some small amount of circular polarisation, if the incident light were to be linearly polarised in a direction skewed with respect to the plane of scattering. If the circular polarisation is produced by elongated cloud particles, it is possible that polarisation of the scattered light will show marked differences from place to place due to different proportions and directions of alignment of particles being caused by updraughts or vertical wind shears present in different parts of the cloud region. This would not be expected if the circular polarisation was due to scattering of linearly polarised light from spherical particles. Apart from early photographic observations 3, recent measurements of the polarisation in noctilucent clouds have been photoelectric and there has been no simultaneous measurement at different points spread over an appreciable part of the cloud display. We have developed and report here a method which allows us to test how circular polarisation varies over the area of display...|$|E
6000|$|... 157. The best {{examples}} {{of the results of}} wise normal evidence in Art will be found in whatever evidence remains respecting the lives of great Italian painters, though, unhappily, in eras of progress, but just in proportion to the admirableness and efficiency of the life, will be usually the scantiness of its history. The individualities and liberties which are causes of destruction may be recorded; but the loyal conditions of daily breath are never told. Because Leonardo made models of machines, dug canals, built fortifications, and dissipated half his art-power in capricious ingenuities, we have many anecdotes of him;--but no picture of importance on canvas, and only a few withered stains of one upon a wall. But because his pupil, or reputed pupil, Luini, labored in constant and successful simplicity, we have no anecdotes of him;--only hundreds of noble works. Luini is, perhaps, the best central type of the highly-trained Italian painter. He is the only man who entirely united the religious temper which was the spirit-life of art, with the physical power which was its bodily life. He joins the purity and passion of Angelico to the strength of Veronese: the two elements, poised in perfect balance, are so calmed and restrained, each by the other, that most of us lose the sense of both. The artist does not see the strength, by reason of the chastened spirit in which it is used: and the religious visionary does not recognize the passion, by reason of the frank human truth with which it is rendered. He is a man ten times greater than Leonardo;--a mighty colorist, while Leonardo was only a fine draughtsman in black, staining the chiaroscuro drawing, like a colored print: he perceived and rendered the delicatest types of human beauty that have been painted {{since the days of the}} Greeks, while Leonardo depraved his finer instincts by caricature, and remained to the end of his days the slave of an archaic smile: and he is a designer as frank, instinctive, and exhaustless as Tintoret, while Leonardo's design is only an agony of science, admired chiefly because it is painful, and capable of analysis in its best accomplishment. Luini has left nothing behind him that is not lovely; but of his life I believe hardly anything is known beyond remnants of tradition which murmur about Lugano and Saronno, and which remain ungleaned. This only is certain, that he was born in the loveliest district of North Italy, where hills, and streams, and air meet in softest harmonies. Child of the Alps, and of their divinest lake, he is taught, without doubt or dismay, a lofty religious creed, and a sufficient law of life, and of its mechanical arts. Whether lessoned by Leonardo himself, or merely one of many disciplined in the system of the Milanese school, he learns unerringly to draw, unerringly and enduringly to paint. His tasks are set him without question day by day, by men who are justly satisfied with his work, and who accept it without any harmful praise, or senseless blame. Place, scale, and subject are determined for him on the cloister wall or the church dome; as he is required, and for sufficient daily bread, and little more, he paints what he has been taught to design wisely, and has passion to realize gloriously: every touch he lays is eternal, every thought he conceives is beautiful and pure: his hand moves always in radiance of blessing; from day to day his life enlarges in power and peace; it passes away cloudlessly, the starry <b>twilight</b> remaining <b>arched</b> far against the night.|$|R
