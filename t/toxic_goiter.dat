50|$|Patients will {{experience}} a hyperthyroid period as the cellular lining of colloid spaces fails, allowing abundant colloid into the circulation, with neck pain and fever. Patients typically then become hypothyroid as the pituitary reduces TSH {{production and the}} inappropriately released colloid is depleted before resolving to euthyroid. The symptoms are those of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism. In addition, patients may suffer from painful dysphagia. There are multi-nucleated giant cells on histology. Thyroid antibodies can be present in some cases. The clinical presentation during the hyperthyroid phase can mimic those of Diffuse <b>Toxic</b> <b>Goiter</b> or Graves' disease. In such cases, a radionuclide thyroid uptake and scan can be helpful, since subacute thyroiditis will result in decreased isotope uptake, while Graves' disease will generally result in increased uptake. Distinguishing between {{these two types of}} disease is important, since Graves' disease and Diffuse <b>Toxic</b> <b>Goiter</b> can be treated with radioiodine therapy, but subacute thyroiditis is usually self-limited and is not treated with radioiodine.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} was to study the risk factors which favor formation of structural and functional disorders of osseous tissue at thyrotoxicosis and to estimate diagnostic value of x-ray morphometric examination and ultrasound densitometry at early identification of osteoporotic processes. We examined 170 females of reproductive age and at menopausal period, first of all with diagnosis of diffuse <b>toxic</b> <b>goiter.</b> All these women were divided into three subgroups depending on the intensity of their osteoporotic changes (the patients with diffuse <b>toxic</b> <b>goiter</b> without evidence of changes in bone tissue; the patients with diffuse <b>toxic</b> <b>goiter</b> and osteopenia; and the patients with diffuse <b>toxic</b> <b>goiter</b> and osteoporosis). A control group included the healthy women of the both age groups which were divided into the same subgroups. It has been established that radiographic method which is used to reveal osteoporotic changes in women of different age groups with diffuse <b>toxic</b> <b>goiter</b> (including determination of indexes of the vertebrae deformation such as Rokhlin index, Scharmazanova index, metacarpal index) allows evaluate the condition of the bone tissue on the first stage of examination. Nevertheless, this method doesn’t pertain to the most highly informative techniques. The evaluation of mineral density indexes of bone tissue by ultrasound osseous densitometry is more modern and informative method. The present study revealed that osteopenia and osteoporosis are associated with loss of the density of the heel bone in females of the both age groups, either in case of presence of diffuse <b>toxic</b> <b>goiter</b> or without it. Nevertheless the percentage share of the density loss depends both on age and presence of diffuse <b>toxic</b> <b>goiter.</b> In reproductive age the mineral density of the bone tissue in osteopenia is not complicated with diffuse <b>toxic</b> <b>goiter</b> but in osteoporosis the fact of presence of thyroid pathology additionally impact the bone structure. Loss of density of the heel bone in menopausal women shows the same tendency as in the women of reproductive age. It has been proved that decrease in density of the heel bone up to stage of osteopenia does not depend on the diagnosed diffuse <b>toxic</b> <b>goiter.</b> Meanwhile, the more serious changes in density connected with the degree of osteoporosis have no correlation with the diffuse <b>toxic</b> <b>goiter,</b> and are observed in the age group of menopausal women. The diffuse <b>toxic</b> <b>goiter</b> balances these age differences in the mentioned parameter: both in reproductive period and in menopausal period the loss of density in osteoporosis is of approximately 35 %. So identification of primary impairment of mineral density of the bone tissue is likely to help in prevention of the development of the further destruction in bone tissue which is connected with thyroid status. It may be supposed that normalizing of the thyroid state may stop the process of destruction in the bone tissue. It has been revealed that in the groups of patients with osteopenia and osteoporosis the reduced mineral density of the bone tissue is associated with certain statistically significant differences in bone density in the women of both subgroups (with diffuse <b>toxic</b> <b>goiter</b> and without it) {{as well as in the}} velocity of ultrasound transmission and changes of wide-band ultrasound reduction.

40|$|Relevance. Diffuse <b>toxic</b> <b>goiter</b> (DTG) is an {{autoimmune}} thyroid disease, {{which is}} based on the excessive secretion of autoantibodies to thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TRAb). Over the last decades, high relapse rate of thyrotoxicosis is observed after withdrawal of conservative therapy. At the same time, there are no reliable criteria to predict the efficiency of drug therapy.

In 408 patients who underwent surgery for hyperthyroidism in our Surgery Department from January 1967 through December 1994 the {{incidence of}} thyroid carcinoma was 5. 6 % (23 cases). In detail, a neoplasm occurred in 5 cases of Graves' disease (specific incidence: 3. 8 %), in 13 cases of <b>toxic</b> nodular <b>goiter</b> (12. 5 %) and in 5 cases of hyperfunctioning adenomas (2. 8 %). 19 cancers were papillary (12 in <b>toxic</b> nodular <b>goiter,</b> 3 in Graves' disease, 4 in hyperfunctioning adenomas), three were follicular (1 in Graves' disease, 1 in <b>toxic</b> nodular <b>goiter,</b> 1 in hyperfunctioning adenomas) and 1 medullary in Graves' disease. A papillary carcinoma was diagnosed preoperatively on fine needle aspiration with ultrasonography in only two patients with Graves' disease and confirmed by postoperative histological examination on permanent section.
