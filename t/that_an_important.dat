5|$|Peking opera follows other {{traditional}} Chinese arts in emphasizing meaning, rather than accuracy. The highest aim of performers {{is to put}} beauty into every motion. Indeed, performers are strictly criticized for lacking beauty during training. Additionally, performers are taught to create a synthesis between the different aspects of Peking opera. The four skills of Peking opera are not separate, but rather should be combined in a single performance. One skill may take precedence at certain moments during a play, {{but this does not}} mean that other actions should cease. Much attention is paid to tradition in the art form, and gestures, settings, music, and character types are determined by long held convention. This includes conventions of movement, which are used to signal particular actions to the audience. For example, walking in a large circle always symbolizes traveling a long distance, and a character straightening his or her costume and headdress symbolizes <b>that</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> character is about to speak. Some conventions, such as the pantomimic opening and closing of doors and mounting and descending of stairs, are more readily apparent.|$|E
5|$|The first inkling to {{the outside}} world that Hitler was dead came from the Germans themselves. On 1 May the radio station Reichssender Hamburg {{interrupted}} their normal program to announce <b>that</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> broadcast would soon be made. After dramatic funeral music by Wagner and Bruckner, Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz (appointed as Hitler's successor in his will) announced that Hitler was dead. Dönitz called upon the German people to mourn their Führer, who died a hero defending the capital of the Reich. Hoping to save the army and the nation by negotiating a partial surrender to the British and Americans, Dönitz authorized a fighting withdrawal to the west. His tactic was somewhat successful: it enabled about 1.8 million German soldiers to avoid capture by the Soviets, but it came at a high cost in bloodshed, as troops continued to fight until 8 May.|$|E

25|$|Communist {{states were}} {{established}} in the East, while parliamentary democracy became the dominant form of government in the West, and proved highly popular there until the turmoil of the late 1960s.

Martin Conway also adds <b>that</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> impetus came from the anti-Nazi wartime political coalitions.|$|E
25|$|The next {{encounter}} {{took place}} in two stages: first in Stockholm on August 12, 1923, when Bishop Müller played host to Bishops Brems and Smit en route to Helsinki. During a festive reunion Bishop Müller launched a warm appeal for increased Nordic Catholic collaboration and announced <b>that</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> Scandinavian Catholic congress probably would soon be arranged in Copenhagen. Nine years, however, were to pass before this became a reality.|$|E

Film director Richard Linklater discusses this novel in his film Waking Life, which begins with a scene reminiscent of another Dick novel, Time Out of Joint.|$|E
25|$|According to most historians, {{the core}} territories of Moravia {{were located in}} {{the valley of the}} river Morava in present-day Czech Republic and Slovakia. Archaeological {{findings}} of large early medieval fortresses and the significant cluster of settlements growing around them suggest <b>that</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> centre of power emerged in this region in the 9thcentury. Early sources (Alfred the Great's contemporaneous translation of Orosius's History of the World, which mentioned Moravia's neighbours, and the description of the travel of Constantine and Methodius from Moravia to Venice through Pannonia in the Life of Constantine) also substantiate the traditional view.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, Terrence Kaufman {{presented}} linguistic {{evidence suggesting}} <b>that</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> ethnic group in Teotihuacan was of Totonacan or Mixe–Zoquean linguistic affiliation. He uses this to explain general influences from Totonacan and Mixe–Zoquean languages {{in many other}} Mesoamerican languages, whose people {{did not have any}} known history of contact with either of the above-mentioned groups. Other scholars maintain that the largest population group must have been of Otomi ethnicity, because the Otomi language is known to have been spoken in the area around Teotihuacan {{both before and after the}} Classic period and not during the middle period.|$|E

25|$|Evolutionary {{psychologist}} Satoshi Kanazawa {{has argued}} <b>that</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> cause of intergroup conflict {{may be the}} relative availability of women of reproductive age. He found that polygyny greatly increased the frequency of civil wars but not interstate wars. Gleditsch et al. did not find a relationship between ethnic groups with polygyny and increased frequency of civil wars but nations having legal polygamy may have more civil wars. They argued that misogyny is a better explanation than polygyny. They found that increased women's rights were associated with less civil wars and that legal polygamy had no effect after women’s rights were controlled for.|$|E
25|$|Current robotic and {{prosthetic}} hands receive {{far less}} tactile information than the human hand. Recent research {{has developed a}} tactile sensor array that mimics the mechanical properties and touch receptors of human fingertips. The sensor array is constructed as a rigid core surrounded by conductive fluid contained by an elastomeric skin. Electrodes are mounted {{on the surface of}} the rigid core and are connected to an impedance-measuring device within the core. When the artificial skin touches an object the fluid path around the electrodes is deformed, producing impedance changes that map the forces received from the object. The researchers expect <b>that</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> function of such artificial fingertips will be adjusting robotic grip on held objects.|$|E
25|$|Minister of Finance Xia Yuanji was a vocal {{opponent}} to {{the treasure}} voyages. In 1421, he was imprisoned for voicing his opposition against the Yongle Emperor's decision {{to undertake the}} third Mongol military campaign, which would add another expenditure to the existing ones. The Hongxi Emperor was fiercely against the treasure voyages throughout his reign. After the advice of Xia Yuanji, he ordered the cessation of the treasure voyages on 7 September 1424, {{the day of his}} accession to the throne. On 8 September 1424, he released Xia Yuanji from his imprisonment. However, the succeeding Xuande Emperor ordered Admiral Zheng He to command the fleet for the seventh voyage. This was after the death of Xia Yuanji on 19 Februari 1430, thus it can be argued <b>that</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> obstacle disappeared after his death. The Xuande Emperor went against the general court opinion when he ordered the seventh voyage.|$|E

25|$|The Meigle Sculptured Stone Museum is a {{permanent}} exhibition of 27 carved Pictish stones in {{the centre of the}} village of Meigle in eastern Scotland. It lies on the A94 road running from Coupar Angus to Forfar. The museum occupies the former parish school, built 1844. The collection of stones implies <b>that</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> church was located nearby, or perhaps a monastery. There is an early historical record of the work of Thana, son of Dudabrach, who was at Meigle (recorded as Migdele) {{in the middle of the}} 9th century during the reign of King Pherath. Thana was likely to have been a monk serving as a scribe in a local monastery that could have been founded in the 8th century. The stones contained in the museum were all found near Meigle, mostly in the neighbouring churchyard or used in the construction of the old church. The present church building dates to about 1870, the previous building having been destroyed in a fire on 28 March 1869. The stones are Christian monuments to the dead of the Pictish warrior aristocracy, who are depicted on the stones bearing their weapons or hunting.|$|E
500|$|As a {{substantial}} body of film criticism {{has built up}} around the film, numerous writers have analyzed it in other ways as well. It has been interpreted as a modern fairy tale and in psychoanalytic terms. Producer Kathleen Kennedy noted <b>that</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> theme of E.T. is tolerance, which would be central to future Spielberg films such as Schindler's List. Having been a loner as a teenager, Spielberg described it as [...] "a minority story". Spielberg's characteristic theme of communication is partnered with the ideal of mutual understanding: he {{has suggested that the}} story's central alien-human friendship is an analogy for how real-world adversaries can learn to overcome their differences.|$|E
500|$|Improvisation {{stands at}} the centre of Chopin's {{creative}} processes. However, this does not imply impulsive rambling: Nicholas Temperley writes that [...] "improvisation is designed for an audience, and its starting-point is that audience's expectations, which include the current conventions of musical form." [...] The works for piano and orchestra, including the two concertos, are held by Temperley to be [...] "merely vehicles for brilliant piano playing... formally longwinded and extremely conservative". After the piano concertos (which are both early, dating from 1830), Chopin made no attempts at large-scale multi-movement forms, save for his late sonatas for piano and for cello; [...] "instead he achieved near-perfection in pieces of simple general design but subtle and complex cell-structure." [...] Rosen suggests <b>that</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> aspect of Chopin's individuality is his flexible handling of the four-bar phrase as a structural unit.|$|E

500|$|Both Fishburne and Bassett also remarked <b>that</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> {{message of}} Akeelah and the Bee is to [...] "speak properly" [...] rather than {{strictly}} in vernacular, although Bassett {{emphasized the importance}} of the film's themes beyond spelling and spelling bees. Atchison added that beyond learning how to spell words, Akeelah must learn the importance of the words. He said that Larabee [...] "looks at Akeelah as a potential leader. He wants her to understand her history. She needs to know the importance of language – and competition." [...] In spite of knowing its importance, it [...] "deconstruct the 'competition' paradigm of learning", according to Ingman. Fishburne noted not only children but parents can learn from the film; in his opinion, the most important is that they should pay attention to their children's abilities. Villarreal also felt that, through Dylan's father, parents would be able to ponder if they are [...] "push their kids to follow their own dreams and not the children's dreams." ...|$|E
500|$|Stirrups, horse {{bits and}} spear points from inhumation graves {{unearthed}} at Sânpetru German {{suggest that the}} Avars settled along the Mureș River in Banat soon after their conquest of the Carpathian Basin in the late 560s. However, most archaeological finds in the lands south of the Mureș that had been attributed to the Avars are dated to the [...] "Late Avar" [...] period. Written sources show the survival of Gepids under Avar rule in the wider region of the Timiș River. For instance, the Byzantine historian Theophylact Simocatta wrote of [...] "three Gepid settlements" [...] which were destroyed by an invading Byzantine army in 599 or 600. A rich burial yielding weapons unearthed at Pančevo and the Treasure of Sânnicolau Mare show <b>that</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> center of power existed in Banat in the [...] "Late Avar" [...] period, according to archaeologist Florin Curta. However, [...] "Late Avar" [...] cemeteries did not survive the 8th century.|$|E
500|$|Although Gay {{withdrew from}} the second race of the competition, the Jamaican once again {{produced}} world record-breaking form in the 200 metres final. He broke his own record by 0.11 seconds, finishing {{with a time of}} 19.19 seconds. He won the 200 m race by the biggest margin in World Championships history, even though the race had three other athletes running under 19.90 seconds, the greatest number ever in the event. Bolt's pace impressed even the more experienced of his competitors; third-placed Wallace Spearmon complimented his speed, and the Olympic champion in Athens 2004 Shawn Crawford said [...] "Just coming out there...I felt like I was in a video game, that guy was moving – fast". Bolt pointed out <b>that</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> factor in his performance at the World Championships was his improved start to the races: his reaction times in the 100 m (0.146) and 200 m (0.133) were significantly faster than those he had produced in his world record runs at the Beijing Olympics. However, he, together with other members of Jamaican 4x100 m relay team, fell short of their own world record of 37.10 s set at 2008 Summer Olympics by timing 37.31 s, which is, however, a championship record and the second fastest time in history at that date.|$|E
