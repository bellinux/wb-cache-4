40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the Bayesian analysis of stochastic volatility (SV) models with leverage. Specifically, the paper shows how the often used Kim et al. (1998) method that was developed for SV models without leverage can be extended to models with leverage. The approach relies on the novel idea of approximating the joint distribution of the outcome and volatility innovations by a suitably constructed ten-component mixture of bivariate normal distributions. The resulting posterior distribution is summarized by MCMC methods and the small approximation error in working with the mixture approximation is corrected by a reweighting procedure. The overall procedure is fast and highly efficient. We illustrate the ideas on daily returns of the <b>Tokyo</b> <b>Stock</b> <b>Price</b> <b>Index.</b> Finally, extensions of the method are described for superposition models (where the log-volatility is made up of a linear combination of heterogenous and independent autoregressions) and heavy-tailed error distributions (student and log-normal).

40|$|This paper {{examines}} two asymmetric stochastic volatility mod-els used {{to describe}} the heavy tails and volatility dependencies found in most financial returns. The first is the autoregressive stochastic volatility model with Student’s t-distribution (ARSV-t), and the sec-ond is the multifactor stochastic volatility (MFSV) model. In order to estimate these models, the analysis employs the Monte Carlo like-lihood (MCL) method proposed by Sandmann and Koopman (1998). To guarantee the positive definiteness of the sampling distribution of the MCL, the nearest covariance matrix in the Frobenius norm is used. The empirical results using returns on the S&P 500 Composite and <b>Tokyo</b> <b>stock</b> <b>price</b> <b>indexes</b> and the Japan–US exchange rate indicate that the ARSV-t model provides a better fit than the MFSV model on the basis of Akaike information criterion (AIC) and the Bayes in-formation criterion (BIC) ...|$|R

Particularly, the multilayer perceptron architecture mostly applied as a forecasting model and found to be similar to other complex non-linear models based on exponential GARCH processes (Bollerslev 1986; Campbell et al. 1997). Among the earliest investigations, in 1990 Kimoto et al. used a modular neural network to learn the relationships among various market factors (Kimoto et al. 1990). They used several learning algorithms and forecasting methods to develop a prediction system for the <b>Tokyo</b> <b>Stock</b> Exchange <b>Prices</b> <b>Indexes</b> (TOPIX).The correlation coefficients produced by their model was found to be much higher than those produced by using a multiple regression method. The researchers in (Trippi and DeSieno 1992) combined the outputs of individual networks using logical operators to produce a set of composite rules. They demonstrated that their best composite synthesized rule set system achieved a higher gain than obtained by previous research.|$|R

40|$|Realized volatility, {{which is}} the sum of squared intraday returns over a certain {{interval}} such as a day, has recently attracted the attention of financial economists and econometricians as an accurate measure of the true volatility. In the real market, however, the presence of non-trading hours and market microstructure noise in transaction prices may cause bias in the realized volatility. On the other hand, daily returns are less subject to noise and therefore may provide additional information on the true volatility. From this point of view, modeling realized volatility and daily returns simultaneously based on the well-known stochastic volatility model is proposed. Empirical studies using intraday data of <b>Tokyo</b> <b>stock</b> <b>price</b> <b>index</b> show that this model can estimate realized volatility biases and parameters simultaneously. The Bayesian approach is taken and an efficient sampling algorithm is proposed to implement the Markov chain Monte Carlo method for our simultaneous model. The result of the model comparison between the simultaneous models using both naive and scaled realized volatilities indicates that the effect of non-trading hours is more essential than that of microstructure noise and that asymmetry is crucial in stochastic volatility models. The proposed Bayesian approach provides an estimate of the entire conditional predictive distribution of returns under consideration of the uncertainty in the estimation of both biases and parameters. Hence common risk measures, such as value-at-risk and expected shortfall, can be easily estimated. ...|$|E
40|$|Stochastic {{neural network}} is a {{hierarchical}} network of stochastic neurons which emit 0 or 1 with the probability {{determined by the}} values of inputs. We have developed an efficient training algorithm so as to maximize the likelihood of such a neural network. This algorithm enables us to apply the stochastic neural network to a practical problem like prediction of fall or rise of <b>Tokyo</b> <b>Stock</b> <b>Price</b> <b>Index</b> (TOPIX). We trained it with the data from 1994 to 1996 and predicted the fall or rise of 1 day ahead of TOPIX for the period from 1997 to 2000. The result is quite promising. The accuracy of the prediction of the stochastic network is the 60. 28 %, although those of non-stochastic neural network, autoregressive model and GARCH model are 50. 02, 51. 38 and 57. 21 %, respectively. However, the stochastic neural network is not so advantageous over other networks or models for prediction of the TOPIX used for training. This means that the stochastic neural network is less over fitting to the training data than others, and results in the best prediction. We will demonstrate how the stochastic neural network learns well non-linear structure behind of the data in comparison to other models or networks, including Generalized Linear model (GLM).

40|$|Currently, {{the world}} {{economic}} activity is increasingly linked and dependent on each other. Almost all states interact {{with the outside world}} (Husnan 2001). It {{can be seen from the}} incident of monetary crisis that hit Asia in 1997. The post-crisis had created many agreements and efforts that led to the establishment of the institution on multilateral cooperation in the field of economy which was expected to improve understanding on the impact of regional economic integration formed through the combination of East Asia Summit (ASEAN, the People's Republic of China, Japan, Republic of Korea, Australia, India, and New Zealand) or better known as ASEAN+ 6. The effect of Indonesia economic relations with other countries renders Indonesia capital market integrated. Consequently, the effect can be positive or negative. The correlation of long term composite <b>stock</b> <b>price</b> <b>index</b> in the capital market among countries is used to determine the level and the development of capital market integration. Composite <b>Stock</b> <b>Price</b> <b>Index</b> (IHSG) is an important variable in the financial sector whose fluctuation is worth to note from time to time. This index includes the movement of the composite index of all shares listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (BEI). Sectoral Indonesia Stock Exchange (BEI) index is a sub index of the Composite <b>Stock</b> <b>Price</b> <b>Index</b> (IHSG), in which the volatile movement of the sectoral <b>stock</b> <b>price</b> <b>index</b> determines the movement of Composite <b>Stock</b> <b>Price</b> <b>Index</b> (IHSG). This research aims to analyze the relation between long-term integration and the impact of ASEAN+ 6 stock market shock on Indonesia Composite <b>Stock</b> <b>Price</b> <b>Index</b> (IHSG) and to identify the industrial sector that has the most influence on the movement of the Indonesia Composite <b>Stock</b> <b>Price</b> <b>Index</b> (IHSG) as well as the effect of industrial shock, and to provide input regarding managerial implication that can be taken by the investors. The scope of this study includes the ASEAN+ 6 countries, namely Indonesia (JKSE), Malaysia (KLSE), Singapore (STI), Thailand (SET), Philippines (PSEi), Australia (AORD), the People's Republic of China (SSE), Japan (Nikkei 225), Republic of Korea (Kospi), India (BSESN), and New Zealand (NZX 50). Sectoral <b>stock</b> <b>price</b> <b>indices</b> used include agriculture (JKAGRI), mining (JKMING), chemical and basic industries (JKBIND), various industries (JKMISC), consumer goods (JKCONS), property and real estate (JKPROP), transportation and infrastructure (JKINFA), finance (JKFINA), trade, services, investment (JKTRADE) and manufacturing (JKMNFG). The method used in this study is VAR / VECM. The result shows that <b>stock</b> <b>price</b> <b>index</b> Philippines, Republic of Korea and India positively related to Composite <b>Stock</b> <b>Price</b> <b>Index</b> (IHSG) Indonesia, while Singapore, New Zealand, and Republic of China negatively related to the Composite <b>Stock</b> <b>Price</b> <b>Index</b> (IHSG) Indonesia. Malaysia <b>stock</b> <b>price</b> <b>index,</b> Japan, Singapura and Australia has no influence on Composite <b>Stock</b> <b>Price</b> <b>Index</b> (IHSG). The shocks on <b>stock</b> <b>price</b> <b>indices</b> of Philippines, Republic of Korea, and India lead to the rise of JKSE in the long term, while the shocks on <b>stock</b> <b>price</b> <b>indices</b> of SET, NZXX 50 and SSE impact to the decline of JKSE in the long term, while the shocks on <b>stock</b> <b>price</b> <b>indices</b> of Thailand, New Zealand, and Republic of China impact to the decline of Composite <b>Stock</b> <b>Price</b> <b>Index</b> (IHSG) in the long term. The most affecting Industrial sectors to the movement of the Indonesia Composite <b>Stock</b> <b>Price</b> <b>Index</b> (IHSG) are the transportation and infrastructure, financial, basic industries and chemical, manufacturing sector, the sector of various industries, consumer goods industry and the mining sector. The shocks on basic and chemical industries as well as various industries lead to the increase of Indonesia Composite <b>Stock</b> <b>Price</b> <b>Index</b> (IHSG) in the long term, while the shocks on financial sector, manufacturing, consumer goods industry, transportation, infrastructure, and the mining sector impact to decline of Indonesia Composite <b>Stock</b> <b>Price</b> <b>Index</b> (IHSG) in the long term. It is suggested for the investors who invest in the Stock Exchange (BEI) to observe the movement of the <b>stock</b> <b>price</b> <b>index</b> of Philippines (PSEit), the <b>stock</b> <b>price</b> <b>index</b> of Republic of Korea (Kospi) and <b>stock</b> <b>price</b> <b>indices</b> of India (BSESN) as references or considerations for investment decisions because the research results suggest that the composite <b>stock</b> <b>price</b> <b>index</b> of those countries positively correlate with IHSG. The industrial sectors which can be served as stock investment alternatives are manufacturing, transportation, infrastructure, and mining industries because these sectors have positive influences on the movement of the Indonesia Composite <b>Stock</b> <b>Price</b> <b>Index</b> (IHSG). This indicates that at the time the Composite <b>Stock</b> <b>Price</b> <b>Index</b> (IHSG) rises, investors can sell the shares of manufacturing, transportation, infrastructure and mining sectors. In the other hand, during the Composite <b>Stock</b> <b>Price</b> <b>Index</b> (IHSG) rises, financial sector, basic industry and chemicals, various industries and consumer goods industries can serve as alternatives for stock purchase as the result of this research suggests those sectoral <b>price</b> <b>indices</b> negatively correlate with Composite <b>Stock</b> <b>Price</b> <b>Index</b> (IHSG). 	Investors from Indonesia may invest in Malaysia, Japan, Singapore and Australia as the results using VECM test display zero influence on <b>Stock</b> <b>Price</b> <b>Index</b> (IHSG) Indonesia which indicates that the degree of those countries stock index integration with the Indonesia Composite <b>Stock</b> <b>Price</b> <b>Index</b> (IHSG) is low. A low degree of integration provides potential an opportunity benefit of international portfolio diversification. Market players must also consider the implications of the stock market integration which will affect the prospects of investment especially the domestic. The Indonesian government can take some steps to further develop the industrial sector such as manufacturing, transportation, infrastructure and mining because these sectors have positive influences on the movement of the Composite <b>Stock</b> <b>Price</b> <b>Index</b> (IHSG) as well as to pay attention to the <b>stock</b> <b>price</b> shocks on the financial, manufacturing, consumer goods industry, transportation, infrastructure, and mining sectors as they impact to decline of Indonesia Composite <b>Stock</b> <b>Price</b> <b>Index</b> (IHSG) in the long term...|$|R

40|$|The {{stochastic}} volatility model usually incorporates asymmetric effects {{by introducing}} the {{negative correlation between}} the innovations in returns and volatility. In this paper, we propose a new asymmetric stochastic volatility model, based on the leverage and size effects. The model is a generalization of the exponential GARCH (EGARCH) model of Nelson (1991). We consider categories for asymmetric effects, which describes the difference among the asymmetric effect of the EGARCH model, the threshold effects indicator function of Glosten et al. (1992), and the negative correlation between the innovations in returns and volatility. The new model is estimated by the efficient importance sampling method of Liesenfeld and Richard (2003), and the finite sample properties of the estimator are investigated using numerical simulations. Four financial time series are used to estimate the alternative asymmetric stochastic volatility (SV) models, with empirical asymmetric effects found to be statistically significant in each case. The empirical results for S&P 500 and Yen/USD returns indicate that the leverage and size effects are significant, supporting the general model. For <b>Tokyo</b> <b>stock</b> <b>price</b> <b>index</b> (TOPIX) and USD/AUD returns, the size effect is insignificant, favoring the negative correlation between the innovations in returns and volatility. We also consider standardized t distribution for capturing the tail behavior. The results for Yen/USD returns show that the model is correctly specified, while the results for three other data sets suggest there is scope for improvement.

We {{start from the}} case of a dynamic model without fixed parameter estimation to demonstrate how particle filter work. Then we show how advanced particle filters work on posterior density approximations for models that allow dynamic states and fixed parameters estimation simultaneously. It is proven that these state and parameter estimations can be achieved for these classes of dynamic models via efficient Particle Filter methods without the need of the more traditional Forward Filtering Backward Sampling (FFBS) simulation. Simulations for the first order dynamic linear model and a time-varying extreme value analysis via the Generalized Extreme Value distribution are illustrated using particle filter methods and a MCMC algorithm through sampling of full conditionals that involve a variety of Metropolis-Hastings steps. Additionally, we illustrate all the different methodologies with three practical time series of extreme values.

Findings – On average, it was found that irrespective of the test employed, the returns of all the 24 African continent-wide <b>stock</b> <b>price</b> <b>indices</b> examined in the study are less non-normally distributed compared to the eight individual national <b>stock</b> <b>price</b> <b>indices</b> examined. The authors also report evidence of the African continent-wide <b>stock</b> <b>price</b> <b>indices</b> having significantly better weak-form informational efficiency than their national counterparts. Practical implications – The policy implication of this evidence is that the African equity price discovery process can be significantly improved if African stock markets integrate their operations. Economically, this may contribute to improved liquidity and more efficient allocation of capital, which in turn can be expected to have a positive impact on economic growth. Originality/value – The paper makes two major contributions to the extant literature. First, it offers for the first time a comparative analysis of the informational efficiencies of a sample of national <b>stock</b> <b>price</b> <b>indices</b> as against African continent-wide <b>stock</b> <b>price</b> <b>indices.</b> Second, there is no prior evidence as to whether African stock markets can improve their informational efficiencies by integrating their operations.

40|$|Using 16 OECD <b>stock</b> <b>price</b> <b>indices</b> data, {{this paper}} revisits the random walk {{hypothesis}} by inspecting {{the degree of}} persistence of <b>stock</b> <b>prices.</b> We adopt two recently developed econometric procedures, due to Hansen (1999) and Romano and Wolf (2001), in order to estimate 95 % confidence intervals for {{the sum of the}} AR coefficients in AR representations of international <b>stock</b> <b>prices.</b> Confidence intervals provide much more information than knowing whether the null hypothesis of a unit root can be rejected or not. They serve as a measure of sampling uncertainty and describe the range of models that are consistent with the observed data. The results convincingly support the view that the <b>stock</b> <b>price</b> <b>indices</b> in the OECD countries are highly persistent. The high persistence in the OECD <b>stock</b> <b>price</b> <b>indices</b> provides strong evidence for the random walk hypothesis. ...|$|R

40|$|A simple {{model that}} is {{commonly}} used to interpret movements in corporate common <b>stock.</b> <b>price</b> <b>indexes</b> asserts that real <b>stock</b> <b>prices</b> equal {{the present value of}} rationally expected or optimally forecasted future real dividends discounted by a constant real discount rate. This valuation model (or variations on it in which the real discount rate is not constant but fairly stable) is often used by economists and market analysts alike as a plausible model to describe the behavior of aggregate market indexes and is viewed as providing a reasonable story to tell when people ask what accounts for a sudden movement in <b>stock</b> <b>price</b> <b>indexes.</b> Such movements are then attributed to "new information" about future dividends. I will refer to this model as the "efficient markets mode" although it should be recognized that this name has also been applied to other models. It has often been claimed in popular discussions that <b>stock</b> <b>price</b> <b>indexes</b> seem too "volatile," that is, that the movements in <b>stock</b> <b>price</b> <b>indexes</b> could not realistically be attributed to any objective new information, since movements in the <b>price</b> <b>indexes</b> seem to be "too big " relative to actual subsequent events. Recently, the notion that financial asset prices are too volatile to accord with efficient markets has received some econometric support in papers by Stephen LeRo...|$|R

Of the seven countries we find, at best, evidence of mean reversion in the <b>stock</b> <b>price</b> <b>index</b> of Japan. Thus, overall, our results support the random walk hypothesis. We also consider {{the implications of the}} identified structural breaks for movement in <b>stock</b> <b>prices</b> over time.

Two major methods applied in this study are Event Study Methodology and Multivariate Regression Model. The first method, event study, is used to analyze <b>stock</b> <b>price</b> movement around Gus Dur & Mega election.

Significant abnormal return were not found because President & Vice President election event can be categorized as an anticipated event, so before the event date investors have anticipated it long time ago. <b>Stock</b> <b>price</b> movement around that event was caused by fluctuation in exchange rate. We also found that Central Bank Certificate Interest Rate did not influence <b>stock</b> <b>price</b> movement because the fluctuation on Central Bank Certificate Interest Rate was relative constant...|$|R
