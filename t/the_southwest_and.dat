5|$|In North America, it {{is found}} mainly in areas east of the Mississippi River, but similar {{mushrooms}} also occur in the Pacific Northwest, <b>the</b> <b>Southwest,</b> <b>and</b> Texas. Its range also stretches south into Mexico. They are ecologically mycorrhizal, and habitats include hardwood forests and coniferous forests. The mushroom grows alone, scattered, or in groups during summer and autumn. It is primarily eastern in distribution but also reported in the Pacific Northwest, <b>the</b> <b>Southwest,</b> <b>and</b> Texas (with an apparent association with pecan trees).|$|E

5|$|October 21, 1969– Hurricane Laurie attains a peak {{strength}} of 105mph (170km/h) while moving eastward in the Gulf of Mexico.

5|$|A weak wave in the ITCZ {{organized}} into Tropical Depression Ten-E on August 30. It headed west-northwest and quickly intensified into {{a tropical storm}} and eventually, a hurricane. Hernan then began rapidly deepening, reaching Category5 intensity on September 1. It maintained that intensity for 12hours before tracking over cooler waters. The storm weakened steadily, with wind shear contributing to its deterioration. Hernan then degenerated into a remnant low on September 6. The low turned to <b>the</b> <b>southwest</b> <b>and</b> dissipated three days later.|$|E

5|$|After heading east {{past the}} {{junction}} with I-69, the highway turns southeast as it heads through rural fields toward Eaton Rapids. Once {{it reaches the}} city, M-50 converges with M-99, and the two intersect M-188 {{on the south side}} of the Grand River. The two highways run south out of the city. Immediately prior to entering Jackson County, the two trunklines diverge with M-99 heading off to <b>the</b> <b>southwest</b> <b>and</b> M-50 to the southeast.|$|E
5|$|As Carlos moved inland, {{it turned}} to the {{northwest}} {{in response to the}} anticyclone over Mexico, and it quickly weakened to tropical depression status. By 12hours after landfall, there was little evidence of a circulation on satellite imagery. Late on June27, Carlos degenerated into a non-convective remnant low pressure area near Acapulco. The circulation turned to <b>the</b> <b>southwest</b> <b>and</b> emerged into the Pacific Ocean; by 0000UTC on June29, the system dissipated completely.|$|E
5|$|As constructed, {{the main}} {{facade of the}} station faced Glenwood Avenue. The two-story {{entrance}} loggia consisted of seven arched bays, with a three-bay wing to the northeast and a two-bay wing to <b>the</b> <b>southwest,</b> <b>and</b> acted as a transition point between {{the street and the}} station interior. The first floor (at track level) featured a large waiting room occupying the entire center block, with vault lights providing natural illumination and a fountain set into the western wall. Restrooms, a kitchen, and a cafe occupied the wings.|$|E

It lies mostly between latitudes 42° and 47° N and longitudes 13° and 20° E. Part of the territory in the extreme south surrounding Dubrovnik is a practical exclave connected {{to the rest of}} the mainland by territorial waters, but separated on land by a short coastline strip belonging to Bosnia and Herzegovina around Neum.|$|E
5|$|Further {{expansion}} {{took place}} during the 1990s. The Charter/International Terminal, later renamed Terminal 2, was opened in December 1991 to handle rising international traffic to Las Vegas. An additional, nine-story parking garage and an underground tunnel linking the Las Vegas Beltway to the airport were constructed as well. In June 1998, <b>the</b> <b>southwest</b> <b>and</b> southeast wings of the D Gates were opened.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Epsilon was {{the final}} of fifteen {{hurricane}}s within the record-breaking 2005 Atlantic hurricane season. Originating from a cold front beneath an upper-level low, Epsilon formed on November29 about 915mi (1470km) east of Bermuda. Initially, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) forecast the storm to transition into an extratropical cyclone within five days, due to conditions unfavorable for significant intensification. Epsilon continually defied forecasts, at first due to an unexpected loop to <b>the</b> <b>southwest,</b> <b>and</b> later due to retaining its strength despite cold waters and strong wind shear.|$|E

5|$|On 11 December 2010, a monsoon trough {{developed}} {{northwest of}} Western Australia. Slowly tracking to the south, the system spawned a low pressure system (Tropical Low 03U) by 15 December. Turning southeastward, the low later made landfall near Coral Bay on 18 December. Within hours of moving inland, the system turned to <b>the</b> <b>southwest</b> <b>and</b> moved back over water the following morning. The storm was last noted on 20 December well {{off the coast}} of Western Australia.|$|E
5|$|Railroad {{connections}} with <b>the</b> <b>southwest</b> <b>and</b> Texas were improved during the 1870s, with {{the formation of}} the Cotton Belt Railroad. In addition to connecting St. Louis with the West, the railroads began to demand {{connections with}} the east across the Mississippi. Between 1867 and 1874, work on the Eads Bridge over the Mississippi continued despite setbacks such as caisson disease. The bridge formally opened on July 4, 1874.|$|E
5|$|The 1993 {{annexation}} made London one of {{the largest}} urban municipalities in Ontario. Intense commercial and residential development is presently occurring in <b>the</b> <b>southwest</b> <b>and</b> northwest areas of the city. Opponents of this development cite urban sprawl, destruction of rare Carolinian zone forest and farm lands, replacement of distinctive regions by generic malls, and standard transportation and pollution concerns as major issues facing London. The City of London is currently the eleventh-largest urban area in Canada, eleventh-largest census metropolitan area in Canada, and the sixth-largest city in Ontario.|$|E

5|$|The {{combination}} of southeastern trade winds and northwestern monsoons produces a hot rainy season (November–April) with frequently destructive cyclones, and a relatively cooler dry season (May–October). Rain clouds originating over the Indian Ocean discharge {{much of their}} moisture over the island's eastern coast; the heavy precipitation supports the area's rain forest ecosystem. The central highlands are both drier and cooler while the west is drier still, and a semi-arid climate prevails in <b>the</b> <b>southwest</b> <b>and</b> southern interior of the island.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} {{segment of}} CR101 heads northward along Middle Neck Road, passing local residences and local commercial buildings {{to the west}} and the Village Club of Sands Point to the east.

At times, the cavalry fought dismounted, with their horses led at a safe distance behind. The opposing forces were always within range of the Union cavalry carbines, keeping the weapon's seven-shot advantage—and not enabling the Confederate infantry to utilize the advantage of their longer range weapons.|$|E
