Some believe McDade's 11th-hour endorsement of Sherwood made the difference, even though Sherwood is considerably more conservative than McDade. He almost certainly got an additional boost from Governor <b>Tom</b> <b>Ridge's</b> landslide reelection victory. Sherwood narrowly defeated Casey again in 2000, most likely helped by George W.

Kerik stated that he had unknowingly hired an undocumented worker as a nanny and housekeeper.

US Attorney General John Ashcroft, Homeland Security Secretary <b>Tom</b> <b>Ridge</b> and FBI Director Robert Mueller were all named in the lawsuit.

The book further discusses [...] "the infighting he saw that frustrated his attempts to build a smooth-running department. Among the headlines promoted by publisher Thomas Dunne Books: Ridge was never invited to sit in on National Security Council meetings; was 'blindsided' by the FBI in morning Oval Office meetings because the agency withheld critical information from him; found his urgings to block Michael Brown from being named head of the emergency agency blamed for the Hurricane Katrina disaster ignored; and was pushed to raise the security alert on the eve of President Bush's re-election, something he saw as politically motivated and worth resigning over." ...|$|R

25|$|Daschle {{also served}} as a {{panelist}} on the Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense, a body that recommended changes to U.S. policy to strengthen national biodefense. In order to address biological threats facing the nation, the Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense created a 33 step initiative for the U.S. Government to implement. Headed by former Senator Joe Lieberman and former Governor <b>Tom</b> <b>Ridge,</b> the Study Panel assembled in Washington D.C. for four meetings concerning current biodefense programs. The Study Panel concluded that the federal government had little to no defense mechanisms in case of a biological event. The Study Panel's final report, The National Blueprint for Biodefense, proposes a string of solutions and recommendations for the U.S. Government to take, including items such as giving the Vice President authority over biodefense responsibilities and merging the entire biodefense budget.

The group was on the State Department list from 1997 until September 2012. They were placed on the list for killing six Americans in Iran during the 1970s and {{attempting}} to attack the Iranian mission to the United Nations in 1992. Giuliani, along with other former government officials and politicians Ed Rendell, R. James Woolsey, Porter Goss, Louis Freeh, Michael Mukasey, James L. Jones, <b>Tom</b> <b>Ridge,</b> and Howard Dean, were criticized for their involvement with the group. Some were subpoenaed during an inquiry about who was paying the prominent individuals' speaking fees. Giuliani and others wrote an article for the conservative publication National Review stating their position that the group should not be classified as a terrorist organization. They supported their position by pointing out that the United Kingdom and the European Union had already removed the group from their terrorism lists. They further assert that only the United States and Iran still listed it as a terrorist group. However, Canada did not delist the group until December 2012.|$|E

50|$|In 1991, Oh was {{a member}} of Ed Rendell's Mayoral {{transition}} team. In 1999, Oh organized Governor <b>Tom</b> <b>Ridge's</b> trade mission to South Korea. In 2003 and 2007, Oh mounted unsuccessful campaigns to win one of Philadelphia City Council's two minority party (Republican) At-Large seats. In both elections, Jack Kelly and Frank Rizzo out-polled Oh. In 2003, Oh ran for Philadelphia City Council At-Large. Despite being an outsider with little funds and almost no party support, Oh shocked the pundits by receiving 98,000 votes. Oh ran again in 2007. He won on Election Day by just 7 votes but the next day, the Election Board announced that it had not counted any absentee ballots. The absentee ballots had been held at its facility and not distributed to the polling places. Weeks later, Oh lost by 122 absentee votes. However, in 2011, Kelly did not stand for re-election, and Rizzo was defeated in the Republican primary. In the general election, State Representative Denny O'Brien took one of the at-large seats, leaving Oh and former Mayoral candidate Al Taubenberger in a close race for the final seat. Oh led by 166 votes after the initial election day tally, and was able to increase his lead after provisional ballots were counted. After Oh was certified the winner, he met with incoming Council President Darrell Clarke and advocated for the creation of Council's Committee on Global Opportunities and the Creative/Innovative Economy. It was created and Oh was appointed Chairman. Oh was also selected as Minority Whip. In 2015, Oh ran for re-election and won. This time, Oh was the top Republican vote-getter and Al Taubenberger defeated incumbent Councilman At-Large Denny O'Brien. Oh was again selected Minority Whip and reappointed as Chairman of Council's Committee on Global Opportunities and the Creative/innovative Economy.|$|R
