40|$|The central {{question}} {{in this paper}} {{is the relationship between}} European modernist <b>traveller</b> <b>s</b> self-fashioning and the representation of Sub-Saharan African cultures, spaces and cross-cultural encounters in the early 20 th century. The premise is that the cultural production of identity, including the question of artistic identity and poetics, is most productive where it is most ambivalent and uneasy. High modernist critical narratives pose the question of the phenomenology of travel in terms of textual authority. Authority, in the perception in late colonial European writing, was often simultaneously questioned and affirmed, meaning that Western art, and the modern society, were seen as lacking something significant outside of its margin. At the same time, the idea of the pure exotic emerged as incompatible with modern historical consciousness, and colonial texts anticipate many later theoretical ideas in postcolonial studies. The question is how to portray cross-cultural encounters, and how to fashion the self in the contact zone of travel and sojourn. Modernist travel writing asks what was the writer s self and the recognition of identity and difference in others. The modernist image of Africa carries important implications for the re-evaluation of art and literature and the renewal of artistic or narrative forms. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{floating}} bridge is a structure carrying traffic across {{a body of}} water and whose supports floats on the surface. The history of the {{floating bridge}} goes as far back as around 2000 BCE, when their use was mainly military. Today, several large floating pontoon bridges help relieve traffic in and out of large cities and populated areas. In Norway, the National Public Road Administration (NPRA) have made plans to build floating bridges across two large fjords to replace the ferries that currently ship traffic across. One of these fjords is Bjørnafjorden, for which the NPRA {{have come up with a}} few different concept solutions for crossing. One of these concepts was chosen for this study to look closer at static and dynamic responses. The model of the concept bridge was created in ANSYS 17. 1, and several different analyses were performed; modal, static, regular wave and irregular sea state for three storm conditions. The main aim was to determine the dynamic response of the bridge in waves, to ensure <b>traveller</b> <b>s</b> safety and comfort even during certain storm conditions. Criteria included limitations to maximum accelerations in y- and z-direction, and maximum rotations about the x-axis. The modal analysis showed that some vertical and horizontal eigenfrequencies of the bridge may coincide with environmental loads and could potentially be of concern. The static analyses with environmental and traffic loads showed that the bridge would remain structurally safe for maximum traffic and winds and currents with a 100 -year return period. Of some concern were the responses to the regular wave analyses, as the results showed little coherency and were larger than expected. The reason for this was somewhat unclear, and the responses to regular waves should be studied further. The results from the irregular sea states were more consistent and showed that the bridge would be safe for traffic during storms with a 1 -year return period. For more severe storms with return periods of 10 and 100 years the extreme responses exceeded the criteria limits, and would therefore not be deemed safe for traffic. This was not considered to be of concern, however, as the NPRA for safety reasons close bridges when wind speeds exceed 25 m/s, which they are likely to do during these storms...|$|R
40|$|In Finland, {{the annual}} number of {{reported}} Salmonella infections has been approximately 2, 000 - 3, 000 {{during the past}} 10 years. The {{vast majority of the}} infections has been acquired abroad. Nowadays salmonellosis is the second most reported cause of gastroenteritis in Finland. All Salmonella infections are included in generally hazardous communicable diseases. This register-based study aims to find out the trends of Salmonella infections that are most likely contracted from abroad, but detected in Finland during 1995 - 2009, and to examine how these trends are correlated with the number of Finnish travellers to these destinations. All the registered 30, 977 Salmonella cases of foreign origin during 1995 - 2009 were received from the National Infectious Diseases Register. Passenger information was extracted from the public data of Statistics Finland. The analyses targeted countries that had been at least once among the ten most frequently reported source countries for salmonellosis during the follow-up period. The vast majority of the Salmonella infections was detected among Finnish citizens (95. 0 %). More female (54. 4 %) than male cases were reported (p <. 001). The mean age of the persons with registered salmonellosis of foreign origin (37. 7 yrs) was not essentially changed during the study period, but, instead, reports on children (< 20 yrs) with Salmonella infection increased {{at the end of the}} study. Thailand, Spain and Turkey were the most frequently reported source countries. The overall risk of travel-related salmonellosis was 31. 8 / 100, 000 Finnish travellers per year (including one-day cruises). The highest risk countries were Thailand (679. 8 / 100, 000 travellers to the country), Tunisia (517. 0), and India (415. 1). In general, the trends of incidences seemed to decline in almost every studied country since year 2000. However, Thailand was the only country that increased the number of Finnish passengers but had a steady or even increasing incidence trend of salmonellosis among the Finnish <b>travellers.</b> <b>S.</b> enteritidis (43. 5 %) was unambiguously the most frequently detected serotype in Finland, followed by S. typhimurium (7. 8 %), S. virchow (4. 2 %), and S. stanley (3. 7 %). The majority of some serotypes was almost solely connected with travellers to a single country: S. stanley to Thailand and S. bareilly to India. Future research is needed to understand the increasing number of reported salmonellosis of foreign origin in children under 20 years. Also, the gender disposition of reported salmonellosis in various age categories is still unknown. Asiasanat:Salmonella, salmonellosis, traveller's diarrhea, tourists, Finnis...|$|R
40|$|Cheques {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{accepted}} forms of payment for settling transactions. Money transactions through cheque collections are pertinent to banking and are an integral activity of any bank. It is not an optional service and hence such services by no means are a gratis. Moreover, the cost involved in collections of such cheques (local or outstation) is borne by the customers in some form or other. It was recognized as early as in the 1970 <b>s</b> that <b>cheque</b> collection policy for the banks in India is a matter of concern. Though a micro issue with respect to the whole gamut of banking, this has its macro implications keeping in mind the mass of bank account holders in India. In this paper, we study the cheque collection policy of the country for both pre and post deregulation scenario. Also, based on a multidimensional scaling technique, categorisation of 31 banks with respect to various parameters of their present cheque collection policies has been made. Although not an exhaustive study, the minimal statistics gathered and analysed leads one to believe that the existing institutional mechanism for setting up cheque collection policies is not adequate. The spirit with which RBI deregulated the cheque collection process has not got translated into the policies made by banks. It is seen that forces of competition, as a deterrent, is inadequate to improve quality service in the field of cheque collections and that the banks and the regulator have a responsibility to act proactively in the interest of the depositors. 1...|$|R

40|$|This thesis, titled Travel to the Threshold, {{presents}} a close reading of Graham Greene s The Lawless Roads (1939), {{an account of}} a journey he undertook through Mexico in 1938. Greene describes Mexico of the period as troubled with social division, poverty, political corruption and religious suppression. His description of the surrounding environment and the journey involves personal recollections of his childhood juxtaposed with subjective inner consideration and reflection in relation to various encounters in his journey. Underlying exploration of the text is consideration of his at times harsh regard toward {{the people and the}} environment in which he is traveling. Overall the thesis regards Greene s travels as both a physical expedition but mainly as a trope for psychological and metaphorical journeying in developing greater understanding of self and the world. The main focus is to explore, through an analysis of The Lawless Roads, the idea of travel as motivated by individual striving to discover more about self and the world (Why do we travel?) {{and the ways in which}} travel is physically, metaphorically or symbolically utilized as a tool for this discovery process (How do we travel?). The key critical concerns consider how preconceptions, personal views, intertextuality and social and cultural background generally, effect the way one travels and the insight that may be gained from travel. This includes: consideration of how one s view of the other, the border and the unknown effect travel experience; how reflections upon experience and upbringing influence travel choices and direction; how the concept of ethical travel impacts on these ideas; and overall, in light of these concerns, how Greene s account of his Mexican travel experience broadens the concept of what travel represents, and reflects elements of what may be gained from the travelling experience. Travel may be seen as an innate search for meaning; relentless, ongoing yearnings inherent in human consciousness for understanding and at the same time a movement from innocence to experience. From the pivotal point of the threshold, (the point representing an in-between stage of knowledge of self and the other), the traveler may expand understanding of self and the world through transition into an area of unfamiliarity. A significant portion of the theoretical consideration of Greene s account of Mexico is discussed in regard to the distinction between the concepts of sedentary and nomadic travel. Sedentary travel is considered in a negative light as inhibiting the <b>traveller</b> <b>s</b> ability to gain insight from his or her travel encounters. Such a traveller carries socially and culturally conditioned preconceptions, prejudices or values that categorize and pigeon-hole experience of the alien or the other, creating a notion of difference and distance that prevents crossing over boundaries to greater understanding of the other. Nomadic travel on the other hand may be seen as a more positive form of travel in terms of gaining insight and generating tolerance within the experience of encounter. The nomadic traveler is open to, in some senses even welcomes, difference, interaction and transformation. Nomadic openness to otherness serves to break down the preconceptions and prejudices symptomatic of social and cultural conditioning, the boundaries that in a sense cage the individual and societies generally. This interpretation suggests that Greene s journey relates to aspects of both these modes of travel...|$|R
