5|$|There are two {{approaches}} to treating Chagas disease: antiparasitic treatment, {{to kill the}} parasite; and symptomatic treatment, to manage the symptoms and signs of the infection. Management uniquely involves addressing selective incremental failure of the parasympathetic nervous system. Autonomic disease imparted by Chagas may eventually result in megaesophagus, megacolon and accelerated dilated cardiomyopathy. The mechanisms <b>that</b> <b>explain</b> why Chagas targets the parasympathetic autonomic nervous system and spares the sympathetic autonomic nervous system remain poorly understood.|$|E
5|$|Food webs exhibit {{principles}} of ecological emergence through {{the nature of}} trophic relationships: some species have many weak feeding links (e.g., omnivores) while some are more specialized with fewer stronger feeding links (e.g., primary predators). Theoretical and empirical studies identify non-random emergent patterns of few strong and many weak linkages <b>that</b> <b>explain</b> how ecological communities remain stable over time. Food webs are composed of subgroups where members in a community are linked by strong interactions, and the weak interactions occur between these subgroups. This increases food web stability. Step by step lines or relations are drawn until a web of life is illustrated.|$|E
5|$|On March 8, it was {{announced}} that Second Sons pre-order sales had surpassed those of The Last of Us in the United Kingdom. Two special edition versions of the game were produced; pre-ordered and first-run copies of the game received the Limited Edition, which includes the Coles Legacy mission pack <b>that</b> <b>explain</b> story events between Infamous 2 and Second Son. The Collector's Edition includes a unique box cover, a replica of Delsin's beanie, eight pins from his vest, an exclusive in-game vest, and a D.U.P.-themed patch. All pre-ordered copies of the game included four in-game vests for Delsin.|$|E

5|$|The Science Behind Pixar is a {{travelling}} exhibition that first opened on June 28, 2015, at the Museum of Science in Boston, Massachusetts. It {{was developed by}} the Museum of Science in collaboration with Pixar. The exhibit features forty interactive elements <b>that</b> <b>explain</b> the production pipeline at Pixar. They are divided into eight sections, each demonstrating a step in the filmmaking process: Modeling, Rigging, Surfaces, Sets & Cameras, Animation, Simulation, Lighting, and Rendering. Before visitors enter the exhibit, they watch a short video at an introductory theater.|$|E
5|$|VKORC1 polymorphisms explain 30% of {{the dose}} {{variation}} between patients: particular mutations make VKORC1 {{less susceptible to}} suppression by warfarin. There are two main haplotypes <b>that</b> <b>explain</b> 25% of variation: low-dose haplotype group (A) and a high-dose haplotype group (B). VKORC1 polymorphisms explain why African Americans are on average relatively resistant to warfarin (higher proportion of group B haplotypes), while Asian Americans are generally more sensitive (higher proportion of group A haplotypes). Group A VKORC1 polymorphisms {{lead to a more}} rapid achievement of a therapeutic INR, but also a shorter time to reach an INR over 4, which is associated with bleeding.|$|E
