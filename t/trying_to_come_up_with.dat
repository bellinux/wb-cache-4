5|$|The {{game was}} {{directed}} and written by Shu Takumi {{as the last}} game in an Ace Attorney trilogy; he also {{wanted it to be}} the final entry in the series, as he felt he had explored Phoenix's character fully. Because he was satisfied with the gameplay in Justice for All, he did not introduce any new gameplay mechanics in Trials and Tribulations. Flashbacks were used as a major theme in the game; this originated in Takumi <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> a way of handling dialogue-integrated tutorials, and deciding to use a flashback to a case from when Mia was a rookie attorney.|$|E
5|$|They {{visited the}} Trianon gardens again on several occasions, but {{were unable to}} trace the path they took. Various landmarks, such as the kiosk and the bridge, were missing, and the grounds were full of people. <b>Trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> an explanation, they {{wondered}} if they had stumbled across a private party or an event booked that day. However, they found that nothing had been booked that afternoon. During their research, they thought they recognised the man by the kiosk as the Comte de Vaudreuil, a friend of Marie Antoinette, who herself had been {{thought to have been}} seen by Moberly.|$|E
5|$|<b>Trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> {{a better}} way to {{generate}} alternating current, Tesla developed a steam powered reciprocating electricity generator. He patented it in 1893 and introduced it at the Chicago World's Columbian Exposition that year. Steam would be forced into the oscillator and rush out through a series of ports, pushing a piston up and down that was attached to an armature. The magnetic armature vibrated up and down at high speed, producing an alternating magnetic field. This induced alternating electric current in the wire coils located adjacent. It did away with the complicated parts of a steam engine/generator, but never caught on as a feasible engineering solution to generate electricity.|$|E

5|$|In a {{scene in}} the episode, Homer and Bart exit the Magic Palace's gift shop, only {{to end up in}} another gift shop. The scene was based on an {{experience}} of the episode's show runner Mike Scully, who, in order to exit the Lance Burton Theatre after a magic show, had to pass through a gift shop. The ending scene of the episode went through several changes and was as a result completed late in the episode's production. The writers had conceived the courtroom scene, but they were stuck <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> an ending after Skinner had been shot. They eventually decided that the trial was a scam staged by the townspeople, and Simpsons writer George Meyer pitched the surfing scene that closed the episode.|$|E

While the team managed to purchase all 10 items, many deals were rushed through with only minimal discounts. Meanwhile, Velocity wasted nearly three hours at the start <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> a strategy, and while Ruth's sub-team performed well, Jo's sub-team wasted even more time by bargaining for items in shops {{that did not have}} them in stock, and failing to purchase the tyre required, resulting in a fine that cost them victory.|$|E

25|$|The Aliens have {{appeared}} in many crossovers (including {{a large number of}} intercompany crossovers) in comic books and other media such as novels, toys, and video games. The largest of these crossovers is the Alien vs. Predator franchise, in which the Aliens battle the Predators. This was an idea that came to comic book artist Chris Warner in early 1989. He and other people at Dark Horse Comics were <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> a good character combo for a new comics series. Dark Horse had been publishing Aliens comic book under license from 20th Century Fox since 1987. In 1990, the first depiction of the idea in film appeared in Predator 2, when an Alien skull, sculpted by Kevin Hudson, appeared as one of the trophies in the Predator spacecraft.|$|E
25|$|Rocket Juice & the Moon is {{the title}} of Albarn's new side-project {{featuring}} Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea and afrobeat legend Tony Allen. Albarn has stated {{that he is not}} responsible for the name; someone in Lagos did the sleeve design and that's the name it was given. Albarn has claimed that he's content with the outcome, as <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> band names is difficult for him. The band performed {{together for the first time}} on 28 October 2011 in Cork, Ireland, as part of the annual Cork Jazz Festival. They performed under the moniker Another Honest Jon's Chop Up!. A full tour is not expected any time soon due to conflicting schedules, with the Red Hot Chili Peppers' tour continuing until 2013. Their debut album was released on 26 March 2012.|$|E

500|$|The album's cover art, {{photographed by}} Ament, {{features}} two skeletons wearing crowns, suggesting {{the possibility that}} the two represent a king and a queen. The forged metal figurines were created by blacksmith Kelly Gilliam. According to Ament, the band had trouble coming up with a name for the album. After the artwork had been finalized and the tracks were sequenced, the band spent weeks <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> a title. Vedder suggested Riot Act, and the band members went with it as they were tired with <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> a title. McCready stated that the title has no real significance. He said, [...] "I guess we were <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> a title that reflected some of the music on the record, which we thought was urgent-sounding and kind of loud...It just seemed to fit."

500|$|The {{album was}} named Double Nickels on the Dime as a {{reaction}} to the Sammy Hagar song [...] "I Can't Drive 55," [...] a protest against the federally imposed speed limit of 55 miles per hour on all U.S. highways.

500|$|Referencing Zahn's {{annotations}} in the 20th Anniversary Edition of Heir to the Empire, John Booth {{wrote in}} Wired that Zahn [...] "created and developed Thrawn {{as a character}} [...] deliberately establishing the Grand Admiral as a villain who leads not by coercion and fear but through valuing strategy and loyalty". Zahn explained in 2008 that Thrawn's version of the Empire is different than that of Palpatine because Thrawn does not have Palpatine's megalomania and xenophobia. Calling Thrawn and Mara Jade his favorite of the characters he created, Zahn noted in 2006 that writing the Grand Admiral [...] "provides the intellectual challenge of <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> new, clever, and (hopefully) workable tactics and strategies".|$|E
500|$|Sakimoto {{noted that}} during the initial phase, he {{composed}} [...] "bright and cheerful" [...] tunes similar to Final Fantasy Tactics, but Matsuno emphasized music that was [...] "more deep and heavy". Matsuno also advised him {{to listen to music}} from The X-Files for ideas on ambient scores, and Sakimoto pointed out influences of James Horner and Hans Zimmer in his compositions. Sakimoto was impressed with the dedication of the development team to the game, and expressed uneasiness <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> music during the game previews. Sakimoto created themes for each character and monster, and made several changes in their melody to reflect their relationships, feelings as well as antagonistic views. The soundtrack for Vagrant Story remains to be one of Sakimoto's favorite compositions.|$|E
500|$|Currently ranked 2144th in Movies and Television on Amazon.com and 1713th in Film and Television on Amazon.co.uk, the box set {{received}} mixed reviews. Kelly West of Cinema Blend {{noted that}} the [...] "seriously extended episodes" [...] were not significantly expanded, only adding {{a few minutes of}} extra footage, which don't influence the storyline. She also noted a [...] "weakness" [...] in the audio commentary provided by four of the actresses, who she deemed to have been fantastic during the series, describing the features as [...] "random chit-chats". However, she praised Sandra Oh's commentary, noting that she put the most effort in hers by <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> interest topics, while being [...] "amusing and worth listening to". She described the bonus features as [...] "mildly entertaining", emphasizing Dempsey's interview about his passion for racing cars, which she regarded useless. USA Today had a positive perspective on the box set, by calling it [...] "scintillating" [...] and [...] "addictive".|$|E

500|$|By season 8, {{the show}} {{had begun to}} explore episodes {{revolving}} around secondary characters. Reverend Lovejoy was selected for this episode because, aside from being noted as [...] "the priest who didn't care", he had not had much character development. This was the first episode that Donick Cary wrote for The Simpsons. He was disappointed that his first story was about [...] "Marge's crisis with faith." [...] The trip to the dump was inspired by Donick Cary's youth, {{in which he would}} often go [...] "dump picking". This led to the writers deciding to have Homer's face on a discarded box, which became the Mr. Sparkle subplot. To help create the advertisement, the writers watched videos of many Japanese commercials. An original scene from Lovejoy's flashback showed that Jasper Beardley preceded him as minister of the First Church of Springfield. The solution for how Mr. Sparkle resembles Homer was written by George Meyer, after hours of time had been spent <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> a realistic ending. Matsumura Fishworks was named after Ichiro Matsumura, a friend of David X. Cohen.|$|E
500|$|... "Bart to the Future" [...] {{was written}} by Dan Greaney and {{directed}} by Michael Marcantel {{as part of the}} eleventh season of The Simpsons (1999â€“2000). It was the second episode of the series to show the Simpson family's life in the future, following the season six episode [...] "Lisa's Wedding" [...] that aired five years earlier in 1995. Three more future-set episodes have been released since [...] "Bart to the Future", the first being Future-Drama (season 16, 2005), second being [...] "Holidays of Future Passed" [...] (season 23, 2011) and third being [...] "Days of Future Future" [...] (season 25, 2014). Greaney's inspiration for [...] "Bart to the Future" [...] came from [...] "Lisa's Wedding". He and The Simpsons writer Matt Selman were sitting in Greaney's office one day, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> new episode stories, when they received the idea of making a companion piece to that episode. Greaney wanted to write an episode set in the future that focused on Bart instead of Lisa. He thought {{it would be interesting to}} explore how the future works out for [...] "a guy like Bart, who doesn't pay attention to school work and is all about being cool." ...|$|E
500|$|Because the dialogue-integrated {{tutorial}} in {{the first}} game had been well received, it was considered a major point for future games in the series. In the first game, Takumi had Phoenix being guided through his first trial by the judge and Mia, and for the second game, he had Phoenix suffer from amnesia; when writing the third game, Takumi {{did not know what to}} do, as it would not seem credible if Phoenix had amnesia a second time. Eventually he came up with the idea of using a flashback to a case where Mia had just become an attorney; he developed this idea further, and ended up using flashbacks as a major theme for the game's story. He decided that he wanted to include a case where Mia faces off against Edgeworth back when he was a rookie prosecutor, but encountered a problem: both characters had previously been established as never having lost a single case. <b>Trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> a way for a case in the past to work with neither of them winning or losing, he came up with the story for Terry Fawles, who dies during the trial.
