5|$|Adenanthos cuneatus {{was taken}} to Great Britain in 1824, and has been grown in {{cultivation}} in Australia and the western United States. Its attractive bronzed or reddish foliage is its main horticultural feature, along with its ability to attract birds to the garden. It requires a well-drained position <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>well,</b> but will grow in full sun or semi-shade, and tolerates both sand and gravelly soils. George Lullfitz, a Western Australian nurseryman, recommends growing it as a rambling ground cover in front of other shrubs, or in a rockery.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{having lost}} 5–0 to the West Indies {{in each of}} the two most recent series, England had grounds for {{optimism}} leading up to the Test series: the West Indian team was ageing and lacked a leg-spinner; and the England team had home advantage. England's morale was also surging following good performances in the shorter form of the game: the team had reached the World Cup Final the previous year, losing to Australia, and were expected <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>well</b> in One Day International cricket, even against the West Indies.|$|E
5|$|Populations of C.australis were {{decimated}} in {{some parts}} of New Zealand because of Sudden Decline. In some areas, particularly in the north, no big trees are left. Although Sudden Decline often affects cabbage trees in farmland and open areas, trees in natural forest patches continue <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>well.</b> Trees in the southern North Island and northern South Island are generally unaffected with few dead branches and no symptoms of Sudden Decline. By 2010, there was evidence to suggest the severity of the disease was lessening.|$|E

5|$|Rarely cultivated, Banksia ilicifolia {{requires}} a sunny position and sandy well-drained soil <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>well.</b> A slow-growing plant, it takes {{up to ten}} years to flower from seed. The glossy green foliage and long flowering period, combined with prominently displayed flowers give it horticultural potential, although its prickly foliage makes fallen leaves a problem if planted near lawns or walkways. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 22 to 41 days to germinate. Difficulties in collection and low seed set make seed relatively expensive. Seeds are often eaten by insects {{before they can be}} collected.|$|E
5|$|Seeing {{himself as}} the heir to Chibás, Castro wanted to run for Congress in the June 1952 elections. Senior Ortodoxo members feared his radical {{reputation}} and refused to nominate him; instead he was nominated {{as a candidate for}} the House of Representatives by party members in Havana's poorest districts, and began campaigning. The Ortodoxo gained a considerable level of support and was predicted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>well</b> in the election.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Bardia {{brought to}} the fore the {{simmering}} hostility between regular officers and reservists. Frank Berryman, the 6th Division's General Staff Officer (Grade 1), and Alan Vasey, the Deputy Assistant Adjutant and Quartermaster General (DA), were eager for Robertson <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>well</b> and show that Staff Corps officers could make good commanders, and if {{that could be done}} at the expense of an old-style reservist like Stanley Savige, so much the better. They pushed for Robertson's 19th Infantry Brigade, then in reserve, to be committed when the attack by Savige's 17th Infantry Brigade slowed down. The abrupt manner in which this was done generated antipathy between Robertson and Savige.|$|E

5|$|When Harry Dean Stanton {{auditioned for}} Brett, he told Ridley Scott {{he was not}} a fan of science-fiction or horror films; Scott replied that he was not either, but {{expected}} Alien <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>well.</b> According to Stanton, he was pleased with the film and said it and Pretty in Pink are the films for which he is best recognized. Several of Brett's scenes were deleted from the original cut, including Ripley and Parker seeing his death and his cocooned corpse in the Alien's lair; they were included in the 2003 director's cut. According to writer Dan O'Bannon, the latter scene hinted that Brett's body was becoming an Alien incubator.|$|E
5|$|After {{scoring a}} second century for Mitchell Main {{at the start}} of the 1910 season, Kilner was chosen to play for Yorkshire Second XI. In his first season, he took three wickets and had a batting average of 12.50 but {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>well</b> for Mitchell Main. For 1911, Yorkshire sent Kilner to play for Harrogate Cricket Club which provided a higher standard of cricket than Mitchell Main: the county had a system whereby promising young players were sent to gain experience in competitive matches for local clubs. Kilner began to record good batting and bowling performances. Although his form for Yorkshire Second XI was more inconsistent, he made his first-class debut for Yorkshire that season against Somerset in the County Championship. He scored 0 and 14 and did not bowl. In a further six matches for Yorkshire in 1911, his highest innings was 18 runs, his average with the bat was just 6.66 in ten innings and he did not take any wickets. For Harrogate, he was more successful, with 519 runs and 28 wickets.|$|E
5|$|Castro co-founded a legal {{partnership}} that primarily catered for poor Cubans, although it proved a financial failure. Caring little for money or material goods, Castro {{failed to pay}} his bills; his furniture was repossessed and electricity cut off, distressing his wife. He {{took part in a}} high-school protest in Cienfuegos in November 1950, fighting with police in protest at the Education Ministry's ban on student associations; arrested and charged for violent conduct, the magistrate dismissed the charges. His hopes for Cuba still centered on Chibás and the Partido Ortodoxo, and he was present at Chibás' politically motivated suicide in 1951. Seeing himself as Chibás' heir, Castro wanted to run for Congress in the June 1952 elections, though senior Ortodoxo members feared his radical reputation and refused to nominate him. Instead he was nominated as a candidate for the House of Representatives by party members in Havana's poorest districts, and began campaigning.

A woman from a well-respected family known in the community as “a family of medical doctors” who is currently enrolled in a premed major at her university would be expected to have a high attainment value for the said major because <b>doing</b> <b>well</b> in this major might affirm her personal or social identity (Eccles 2005; Eccles et al. 1983).|$|R

5|$|Further medal {{success was}} {{anticipated}} at the 1998 Olympics in Nagano, which were attended by 24 Australian athletes. Zali Steggall, who months earlier {{had become the}} first Australian woman to win a World Cup event and was ranked sixth in the world, won the country's first individual medal with a bronze in slalom skiing. Her time of 1m 32.67s was only 0.27s behind the gold medallist. Marshall, the world champion in 1997 and 1999, and Jacqui Cooper—ranked second in the world—were expected <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>well</b> in the aerials, but both crashed and {{failed to make the}} final. Bradbury, Nizielski and Kieran Hansen, three of the quartet that won Australia's maiden medal in 1994, returned but finished last, in eighth place.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, Kajol {{featured}} in the melodrama Udhaar Ki Zindagi, as the granddaughter of the characters played by Jeetendra and Moushumi Chatterjee. The film, which was a remake of the hit Telugu film, Seetharamaiah Gari Manavaralu, failed <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>well</b> at the box office. However, Kajol received praise for her performance and won the BFJA Award for Best Actress. She subsequently starred in and earned public recognition with Yash Raj Films's hit romantic drama Yeh Dillagi, alongside Akshay Kumar and Saif Ali Khan. The film, which was an unofficial remake of the Hollywood film Sabrina, narrated {{the story of a}} chauffeur's daughter who becomes a model, and engages in a love triangle between two brothers. The success of Yeh Dillagi proved a breakthrough for Kajol and her performance in the film fetched her a first Best Actress nomination at the annual Filmfare Awards.|$|E
5|$|Later that year, in December 1993, Kariya {{left his}} college team, the Maine Black Bears, {{to join the}} Canadian {{national}} team {{in preparation for the}} 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway. At the start of the tournament, Canada was seeded seventh overall and were not considered favourites <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>well.</b> Playing on a line with Chris Kontos and Petr Nedved, Kariya led his team in scoring with three goals and seven points over eight games, helping Canada to a silver medal. Tied with the Czech Republic 2–2 in the quarterfinal, Kariya scored the game-winning goal after 16 minutes of overtime play to help the Canadians advance. In the gold medal game, Kariya scored the first goal as Canada went on to lose 3–2 in a shootout to Sweden. With a chance to tie the shootout after Swedish forward Peter Forsberg scored, Swedish goaltender Tommy Salo stopped Kariya with a glove save.|$|E

5|$|Made on a 400-million budget, Dostana was {{released}} on 14 November 2008. The film opened well, with over 80-percent occupancy in multiplexes and over 60-percent occupancy in single-screen cinemas. According to Box Office India, the film earned about 53 million on its opening day and over 173 million in its first weekend at the domestic box office. At {{the end of its}} first week, it had earned 267 million. In its second week, Dostana continued <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>well</b> and was the best-performing film despite the release of Yuvvraaj. The film was considered a hit in its second week. It also performed well in the overseas market, especially in the United Kingdom and the United States. Dostana grossed ₹261 million on the overseas market and over ₹610 million at the domestic box office for a worldwide gross of over ₹871 million. The film, a commercial success, was the eighth-highest-grossing Bollywood film of the year.|$|E

The pilot episode was also popular for DVR playback (over five million, a 79-percent increase, for a total 3.4 rating among adults 18–49 and total viewership of 12.15million). The series, which continued <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>well</b> in live viewing, more than doubled several times in DVR playback during the season.

5|$|The Philadelphia Phillies' 2014 {{season was}} the 132nd {{in the history}} of the franchise. After a disappointing 2013, the Phillies entered the offseason with a {{strategy}} to reload rather than rebuild; they did not want to relinquish the opportunity <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>well</b> in 2014 in hopes of being competitive down the road. Commensurate with this strategy, among their key acquisitions were right fielder Marlon Byrd and starting pitcher A. J. Burnett. The Phillies began the season with new coaches (as Ryne Sandberg entered his first season as manager after taking over on an interim basis in August 2013) and new broadcasters; Jamie Moyer and Matt Stairs, two members of the 2008 World Series squad, replaced Chris Wheeler and Gary Matthews as analysts on Comcast SportsNet Philadelphia.|$|E

5|$|The discography of Snow Patrol, an {{alternative}} rock band from Northern Ireland and based in Dundee, Scotland, consists of six studio albums, twenty-eight singles, eight extended plays, two compilation albums and one live DVD. Snow Patrol {{was formed in}} 1994 by Gary Lightbody, Michael Morrison and Mark McClelland under the name Shrug. They released an extended play (EP) titled The Yogurt vs. Yogurt Debate. Morrison left in 1995, and the band changed their name to Polarbear. Under this name they released their other EP, Starfighter Pilot, on the Electric Honey label. Drummer Jonny Quinn joined in 1997 and the band signed to Jeepster Records the same year. They then underwent their final name change to Snow Patrol. The band's first two studio albums: Songs for Polarbears and When It's All Over We Still Have to Clear Up were released in 1998 and 2001 respectively, but failed <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>well</b> commercially. Subsequently, the band was dropped by the label.|$|E
5|$|Valkyrie was {{intended}} to be a high-profile film that would jump-start United Artists, the host studio partly owned by Tom Cruise and Paula Wagner. Pressure was placed on Valkyrie <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>well</b> since an earlier United Artists film featuring Cruise, Lions for Lambs, performed poorly in the box office, and the studio's planned production of Oliver Stone's Pinkville was canceled. The film changed release dates multiple times. It was originally slated to be released on August 8, 2008, then moved up earlier to June 27, 2008. The film was then held off to October 3, 2008, to avoid competition from WALL-E and Wanted, and to enable the late filming of the North African battle sequence. The October date was also originally chosen to increase the film's chances of awards success. In April 2008, the release date was pushed back to February 13, 2009, with the studio citing the early fall schedule as too crowded with Academy Award prospects. Valkyrie would have taken advantage of the lucrative President's Day weekend, after The Wolfman and The Pink Panther 2 were moved from this date.|$|E
5|$|Hammond {{struck his}} contemporaries as a sad figure, a loner with few friends in cricket. He rarely {{encouraged}} young players or gave out praise. He liked {{to mix with}} middle-class people, spending money he did not really have, leading to accusations of snobbery. Team-mates regarded him as moody, private and uncommunicative. Often silent {{in the company of}} others, he could be arrogant and unfriendly. Charlie Barnett and Charles Dacre, two of his Gloucestershire team-mates, came almost to hate him. Dacre often played in a reckless way of which Hammond disapproved; Hammond, in turn, may have been jealous of him. Hammond once tried hard to injure Dacre by bowling fast at him while he was wicketkeeper. Barnett began as a close friend but fell out over Hammond's treatment of his first wife and later his refusal to play in Barnett's benefit match. Other players who were involved in disputes with Hammond included Denis Compton, whose cavalier approach Hammond disliked, and Learie Constantine, who believed Hammond insulted him in the West Indies in 1925, although the two later made peace. Hammond's ultimate rivalry was with Bradman, who overshadowed him throughout his career, and with whom he developed an increasing obsession. It was not enough for Hammond to be the second-best batsman in the world, and he disliked the constant comparisons made between them in Bradman's favour. He felt not only that he had <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>well,</b> but also that he had to score more than Bradman.|$|E
