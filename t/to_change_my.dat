500|$|On 17 July Smith {{complained of}} feeling unwell with chest and eye pain while under cross-examination, and {{proceedings}} were briefly halted {{while he was}} treated for the symptoms of a panic attack. When Smith returned to the witness stand, he said he wished to speak to his barrister. Presiding judge Rafferty {{told him that he}} must answer questions, to which Smith replied: [...] "I want <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>my</b> plea. I'm fed up with this. I want <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>my</b> plea." [...] The charges were read to him again the following day, and he pleaded guilty. On 18 July 2001 Smith was sentenced to life imprisonment. In January 2005 Birmingham's Sunday Mercury newspaper reported that Smith had decided to change his plea after police agreed to return £400 confiscated from him during a raid on his flat after his arrest, and that he wanted the money to buy Mars bars in prison.|$|E

[...] He was especially proud that the band had successfully backed Tony Bennett during a late 1990s appearance on Late Night: [...] "Two years ago if you'd asked me if I could play with Tony Bennett, I would have said absolutely not. I'm not in his league. But we played with him the other night, and it was wonderful. We swung." ...|$|E

And now {{for the cause of}} this disturbance, not unexpected, I may say, by us, for we have heard accounts of former matches played by English teams."

500|$|At {{this point}} in time, [...] Morrison was under {{pressure}} by Warner Bros. Records to produce chart singles and two albums within a year. [...] His previous album, His Band and the Street Choir, had been released in November 1970. [...] In an interview with journalist Sean O'Hagan in 1990, he described this period as being {{in contrast to the}} laid back atmosphere pictured on the album cover: [...] "When I went to the West Coast these people [...] weren't that available so I had to virtually put a completely new band together overnight to do [...] So it was a very tough period. I didn't want <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>my</b> band but if I wanted to get into the studio I had to ring up and get somebody. That was the predicament I was in." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{environment}} in Lody's boarding-house was becoming increasingly hostile; his hosts were growing suspicious of him. Their doubts grew as the ongoing espionage scare progressed. He had {{stayed there for}} more than three weeks and his evasive answers when questioned about when he expected to leave did not satisfy them. When they said that his accent appeared to be [...] "more German than American", he knew it was time to go. He wrote in his letter of 27 September that [...] "the fear of espionage is very great and every day I see some Germans going to Redford Barracks under the escort of a soldier... It is advisable for me to vanish for a few days, and <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>my</b> place of abode. I can only hope that my telegraphic and letter information have duly arrived." [...] He told his controllers that he would go to Ireland, disembarking at Dublin as it was the only Irish port not closed to foreigners. Despite his hopes, his letter was intercepted by the British; this time it was retained as the information therein was of genuine military value.|$|E

500|$|DeHavilland {{turned to}} Warner's wife Anne for help. Warner later recalled, [...] "Olivia, {{who had a}} brain like a {{computer}} concealed behind those fawn-like eyes, simply went to my wife and they joined forces <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>my</b> mind." [...] Warner relented, and deHavilland was signed to the project {{a few weeks before}} the start of principal photography on January 26, 1939. Set in the American South during the 19th century, the film is about the strong-willed daughter of a Georgia plantation owner in love with the husband of her sister-in-law, Melanie, whose kindness stands in sharp contrast to those around her. According to film historian Tony Thomas, deHavilland's skillful and subtle performance effectively presents this character of selfless love and quiet strength in a way that keeps her vital and interesting throughout the film. Gone with the Wind had its world premiere in Atlanta, Georgia, on December 15, 1939, and was well received. Frank S. Nugent of The Times wrote that deHavilland's Melanie [...] "is a gracious, dignified, tender gem of characterization", and John C. Flinn, Sr., in Variety called her [...] "a standout". The film won 10 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and deHavilland received her first nomination for Best Supporting Actress.|$|E
500|$|In a DVD {{review for}} the {{individual}} episode DVD release Spongicus, Roy Hrab of DVD Verdict said that [...] "In my previous SpongeBob reviews I have commented that series has lost its edge. This offering does nothing <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>my</b> opinion. But what the heck do I know? Clearly, the show continues to maintain a large following and the franchise is a license to print money for Nickelodeon." [...] The DVD consists of eight episodes and praised the episodes [...] "Not Normal" [...] and [...] "Gone" [...] by describing them [...] "the best episode on the disc" [...] and [...] "a decent episode", respectively. Also from DVD Verdict, Gordon Sullivan, on the DVD release To SquarePants or Not to SquarePants, said that [...] " [...] a solid collection of SpongeBob SquarePants episodes." [...] He added that [...] "My only serious problem with this set is that it's only eight episodes long; a more complete season-style release would be more efficient. On the technical front everything is fine, with the bright, solid colors of Bikini Bottom shining through clearly and all the dialogue and effects clear and detailed." [...] Sullivan gave the episodes [...] "The Splinter", [...] "Slide Whistle Stooges", and [...] "The Krabby Kronicle" [...] an 8/10 rating, while [...] "Boating Buddies" [...] received the lowest rating with 3/10.|$|E
500|$|The poem {{discusses}} {{his understanding}} of nature within the concept of [...] "One Life", an idea that {{is presented as a}} resulting from Coleridge's reflection on his experiences at Clevedon. The conversation poems as a whole are connected to the ideas within The Eolian Harp that deal with understanding the universe. The [...] "One Life" [...] lines added to the 1817 edition interconnect the senses and also connects sensation and experience of the divine with the music of the Aeolian harp. Although the earlier editions do not include the same understanding of perception, there traces of the idea expressed in the earlier editions. Coleridge derived his early understanding from the works of Jakob Böhme, of which he wrote in a 4 July 1817 letter to Ludwig Tieck: [...] "Before my visit to Germany in September, 1798, I had adopted (probably from Behmen's Aurora, which I had conjured over at School) the idea, that Sound was = Light under the praepotence of Gravitation, and Color = Gravitation under the praepotence of Light: and I have never seen reason <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>my</b> faith in this respect." [...] Along with this view of sensation, Coleridge adopted Böhme's idea of connecting to God through the will instead of the intellect, and that pantheism should be denied. Coleridge also relies in part on Böhme's understanding of polarity of opposites in his own views of Polar Logic and man's attempt to return to Paradise.|$|E
