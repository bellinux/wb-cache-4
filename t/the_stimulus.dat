Tedisco, who had been criticized by Murphy for opposing the package, used the outrage over the AIG bonuses to reframe the debate. On March 19, Tedisco called for the resignation of Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner over the AIG controversy.

50|$|A neutral {{stimulus}} is {{a stimulus}} which initially produces no specific response other than focusing attention. In classical conditioning, when used {{together with an}} unconditioned <b>stimulus,</b> <b>the</b> neutral <b>stimulus</b> becomes a conditioned stimulus. With repeated presentations of both <b>the</b> neutral <b>stimulus</b> and <b>the</b> unconditioned <b>stimulus,</b> <b>the</b> neutral <b>stimulus</b> will elicit a response as well, known as a conditioned response. Once <b>the</b> neutral <b>stimulus</b> elicits a conditioned response, <b>the</b> neutral <b>stimulus</b> becomes known as a conditioned <b>stimulus.</b> <b>The</b> conditioned response {{is the same as}} the unconditioned response, but occurs in the presence of <b>the</b> conditioned <b>stimulus</b> rather than <b>the</b> unconditioned <b>stimulus.</b>|$|R

5|$|In many {{accounts}} {{of the development of}} evolutionary theory, Wallace is mentioned only in passing as simply being <b>the</b> <b>stimulus</b> to the publication of Darwin's own theory. In reality, Wallace developed his own distinct evolutionary views which diverged from Darwin's, and was considered by many (especially Darwin) to be a leading thinker on evolution in his day, whose ideas could not be ignored. One historian of science has pointed out that, through both private correspondence and published works, Darwin and Wallace exchanged knowledge and stimulated each other's ideas and theories over an extended period. Wallace is the most-cited naturalist in Darwin's Descent of Man, occasionally in strong disagreement.|$|E
5|$|Neuroscientist and {{psychologist}} Pascal Wallisch {{states that}} while inherently ambiguous stimuli {{have been known}} to vision science for many years, this is the first such stimulus in the colour domain that was {{brought to the attention of}} science by social media. He attributes differential perceptions to differences in illumination and fabric priors, but also notes that <b>the</b> <b>stimulus</b> is highly unusual insofar as the perception of most people does not switch. If it does, it does so only on very long time scales, which is highly unusual for bistable stimuli, so perceptual learning might be at play. In addition, he says that discussions of this stimulus are not frivolous, as <b>the</b> <b>stimulus</b> is both of interest to science and a paradigmatic case of how different people can sincerely see the world differently, an acknowledgement of which is a precondition for world peace. Daniel Hardiman-McCartney of the College of Optometrists stated that the picture was ambiguous, suggesting that the illusion was caused by a strong yellow light shining onto the dress, and human perception of the colours of the dress and light source by comparing them with other colours and objects in the picture. The philosopher Barry C. Smith compared the phenomenon with Ludwig Wittgenstein and the rabbit–duck illusion.|$|E
5|$|Reversible pulpitis is {{characterized}} by short-lasting pain triggered by cold and sometimes heat. The symptoms of reversible pulpitis may disappear, either because the noxious stimulus is removed, such as when dental decay is removed and a filling placed, or because new layers of dentin (tertiary dentin) have been produced inside the pulp chamber, insulating against <b>the</b> <b>stimulus.</b> Irreversible pulpitis causes spontaneous or lingering pain in response to cold.|$|E
50|$|The timing {{between the}} {{conditioned}} and unconditioned stimulus is important. There {{are two types}} of approaches for eye blink conditioning when it comes to timing between <b>the</b> <b>stimuli.</b> <b>The</b> first is called delay conditioning, which is when <b>the</b> conditioned <b>stimulus</b> (tone) starts, then continues until <b>the</b> unconditioned <b>stimulus</b> (air puff) is released after a delay, then they both suspend at the same time. The other is called trace conditioning, where <b>the</b> conditioned <b>stimulus</b> (tone) is shorter and stops before <b>the</b> unconditioned <b>stimulus</b> (air puff) begins, leaving a gap between <b>the</b> two <b>stimuli.</b> This type of conditioning forces the subject, in this particular example, a bunny, to remember to link <b>the</b> conditioned <b>stimulus</b> with <b>the</b> unconditioned <b>stimulus.</b>|$|R

5|$|The manor {{remained}} {{in the possession of}} the Assheton family until 1514 when its male line terminated. The lordship of the manor passed to Sir George Booth, great-great grandson of Sir Thomas Ashton, devolving through the Booth family until the Earls of Stamford inherited it through marriage in 1758. The Booth-Greys then held the manor until the 19thcentury, whose patronage, despite being absentee lords, was probably <b>the</b> <b>stimulus</b> for Ashton's growth of a large-scale domestic-based textile industry in the 17thcentury. Pre-industrial Ashton was centred on four roads: Town Street, Crickets Lane, Old Street, and Cowhill Lane. In the late-18th and early-19thcenturies, the town was re-planned, with a grid pattern of roads. As a result, very little remains of the previous town. In 1730 a workhouse was established which consisted of a house and two cottages; it later came {{to be used as a}} hospital.
