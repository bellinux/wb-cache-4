5|$|On {{the train}} Sameer meets Suraj Prakash (Satish Shah), who makes him <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is a thief by asking {{him where he}} keeps {{important}} things (like money) in his luggage. Sameer stays awake all night to avoid being robbed, while Suraj sleeps after conning Sameer into guarding his luggage. Suraj admits this to Sameer {{the next morning at}} the station. Sameer learns that Suraj is a security guard at his resort, and puts him on night guard duty for three months. This puts a crimp in Suraj's marriage and, although he apologises, Sameer is adamant.|$|E
5|$|After {{she turned}} 15, Falle {{had her first}} {{experience}} in the sex industry {{at a party in}} a bar in Chinatown, Calgary. A 25-year-old man at the party who had forged identity documents convinced her to sell sex for money and give him half of her earnings. Falle found this man well-dressed and attractive and did not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> fit the stereotypical image of a pimp. She had nowhere to sleep that night and had no money for food, so she accepted his offer. The man to whom she sold sex that night had teeth that were rotten. They had sex on a soiled mattress in a poorly-ventilated restaurant attic, and she received $100.|$|E
5|$|The {{top three}} drivers of both races {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and at a later press conference. After the first race, Giovinazzi {{said he had been}} amazed at his first victory in the GP2 Series and thanked his team and his primary sponsor. He stated that he did not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would able to secure his first victory before the season was over, and was happy to score the points he earned for himself and his team. Sirotkin said the race was not easy for him because {{he did not have the}} start he intended. He said that he was happy with his second-place result but would not to be content finishing in either second or third in every event. Marciello stated that he expected some safety cars to affect the race but was unhappy with how many there were as they had prevented him building a large enough gap to his rivals. He said that his third-place finish was good for his team and revealed that he was not surprised when Sirotkin passed him on the start/finish straight on the first race's final lap as he saw him close up to him under the safety car.|$|E

25|$|Starting to {{move his}} army toward Jetersville at 1:00p.m. with Longstreet's corps in the lead, Lee {{discovered}} that his route to Danville was blocked by fast-moving Union cavalry.

25|$|Theophilus had a light complexion. He {{changed his}} name to T. John McKee and let people <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was white.

In the 1940s, however, after all his siblings and first cousins had died, he sued for a portion of his grandfather McKee's estate that had not been distributed.|$|E
25|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that Herod was born around 73 BCE in Idumea, south of Judea.. However, some authors <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{was born in}} about 72/71 BCE. He was the second son of Antipater the Idumaean, a high-ranking official under ethnarch Hyrcanus II, and Cypros, a Nabatean. Herod's father was by descent an Edomite whose ancestors had converted to Judaism. Herod was raised as a Jew.|$|E

25|$|Menasseh ben Israel was {{the author}} of many works. His major work Nishmat Hayim is a {{treatise}} in Hebrew on the Jewish concept of reincarnation of souls, published by his son Samuel six years before they both died. Some scholars <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> studied kabbalah with Abraham Cohen de Herrera, a disciple of Israel Saruk. This would explain his familiarity with the method of Isaac Luria.|$|E
25|$|Having {{had enough}} of Caligula’s anger at her criticisms and of his behavior, she {{committed}} suicide. Suetonius’s Caligula, clause 23, mentions how he might have poisoned her.When his grandmother Antonia asked for a private interview, he refused it except {{in the presence of}} the prefect Macro, and by such indignities and annoyances he caused her death; although some <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> also gave her poison. After she was dead, he paid her no honour, but viewed her burning pyre from his dining-room.|$|E
25|$|The royal {{inscriptions}} of the Assyrian king Adad-nirari I (c. 13071275 BC) relate how the vassal king Shattuara of Mitanni rebelled {{and committed}} hostile acts against Assyria. How this Shattuara {{was related to}} the dynasty of Partatama is unclear. Some scholars <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was the second son of Artatama II, and the brother of Shattiwazza's one-time rival Shuttarna. Adad-nirari claims to have captured King Shattuara and brought him to Ashur, where he took an oath as a vassal. Afterwards, he was allowed to return to Mitanni, where he paid Adad-nirari regular tribute. This must have happened during the reign of the Hittite King Mursili II, but there is no exact date.|$|E

25|$|Portillo's {{loss of the}} Enfield Southgate seat, in the 1997 general {{election}} to Labour's Stephen Twigg, {{came as a shock}} to many politicians and commentators, and came to symbolise the extent of the Labour landslide victory. Halfway through the campaign, Portillo invited aides Andrew Cooper and Michael Simmonds to his house and presented them with some ideas for a leadership campaign following the expected Conservative defeat and asked them to finish it off. However, when a poll in The Observer on the weekend before the election showed that Portillo held only a three-point lead in his hitherto-safe seat, Portillo asked Cooper, who oversaw the party's internal polling, to reassure him that it was wrong; Cooper was unable to and Portillo began to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> might lose.|$|E
25|$|The {{battle of}} Hatvan {{was not a}} very {{important}} victory, but its influence on the moral of the Hungarian troops was remarkable. The most important result of the battle was that Gáspár succeeded to make Schlik to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> faced the whole Hungarian army, and not just its VIIth corps. Windisch-Grätz continued to be unsure about the plans and displacement of the Hungarian main army, and because of this he remained mostly incapable of stopping them to advance from two sides, towards his headquarters at Gödöllő. After the victory of Hatvan, the other, more numerous Hungarian army, consisting of three corps, won at Tápióbicske another victory, than neared to Isaszeg, where, on 6 April, the decisive battle of {{the first phase of the}} Spring Campaign took place.|$|E
25|$|In 1324, Odoric of Pordenone, a Franciscan missionary from Friuli, Italy, is {{believed}} {{by some to}} have celebrated a Catholic Mass and baptized natives at Bolinao, Pangasinan. In July 2007, memorial markers were set up in Bolinao to commemorate Odoric's journey based on a publication by Luigi Malamocco, an Italian priest from Friuli, Italy, who claimed that Odoric of Perdenone held the first Catholic Mass in the Philippines in Bolinao, Pangasinan. That 1324 mass would have predated the mass held in 1521 by Ferdinand Magellan, which is generally regarded as the first mass in the Philippines, by some 197 years. However, historian William Henry Scott concluded after examining Oderic's writings about his travels that he likely never set foot on Philippine soil and, if he did, {{there is no reason}} to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> celebrated mass.|$|E

25|$|It {{is natural}} to a {{republic}} {{to have only}} a small territory, otherwise it cannot long subsist. In a large republic there are men of large fortunes, and consequently of less moderation; there are trusts too great {{to be placed in}} any single subject; he has interest of his own; he soon begins to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> may be happy, great and glorious, by oppressing his fellow citizens; and that he may raise himself to grandeur on the ruins of his country. In a large republic, the public good is sacrificed to a thousand views; it is subordinate to exceptions, and depends on accidents. In a small one, the interest of the public is easier perceived, better understood, and more within the reach of every citizen; abuses are of less extent, and of course are less protected.|$|E
25|$|The {{plaintiff}} in that suit, Robert Blankenship, charged that DeLay {{and a third}} partner in Albo Pest Control had breached the partnership agreement by trying to force {{him out of the}} business without buying him out. Blankenship filed suit, charging DeLay and the other partner with breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, wrongful termination, and loss of corporate expectancy. While being deposed in that suit, DeLay claimed that he did not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was an officer or director of Albo and that he believed that he had resigned two or three years previously. However, his congressional disclosure forms, including one filed subsequent to the deposition, stated that he was either president or chairman of the company between 1985 and 1994. Blankenship also alleged that Albo money had been spent on DeLay's congressional campaigns, in violation of federal and state law. DeLay and Blankenship settled for an undisclosed sum. Blankenship's attorney said that had he known about the congressional disclosure forms, he would have referred the case to the Harris County district attorney's office for a perjury prosecution.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} of July 9, 1937 Gershwin {{collapsed}} in Harburg's house, {{where he had been}} working on the score of The Goldwyn Follies. He was rushed back to Cedars of Lebanon, and fell into a coma. Only then did his doctors <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was suffering from a brain tumor. Leonore called George's close friend Emil Mosbacher and explained the dire need to find a neurosurgeon. Mosbacher immediately called pioneering neurosurgeon Harvey Cushing in Boston, who, retired for several years by then, recommended Dr. Walter Dandy, who was on a boat fishing in Chesapeake Bay with the governor of Maryland. Mosbacher then called the White House and had a Coast Guard cutter sent to find the governor's yacht and bring Dandy quickly to shore. Mosbacher then chartered a plane and flew Dandy to Newark Airport, where he was to catch a plane to Los Angeles; however, by that time, Gershwin's condition was critical and the need for surgery immediate. In the early hours of July 11th doctors at Cedars removed a large brain tumour, believed to have been a glioblastoma, but Gershwin died on the morning of July 11, 1937, at the age of 38.|$|E
