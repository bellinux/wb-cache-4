5000|$|Due to the {{involvement}} of Indian intelligence (RAW) in supporting the Northern Alliance, Pakistan looked to neutralise this threat by cultivating the Taliban. In 2001 alone, according to several international sources, 28,000-30,000 Afghans, which took refuge in Pakistan during Afghan jihad, 14,000-15,000 Afghan <b>Taliban</b> <b>and</b> 2,000-3,000 <b>Al</b> Qaeda militants were fighting against anti-Taliban forces in Afghanistan as a roughly 45,000 strong military force. Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf - then as Chief of Army Staff - was responsible for sending thousands of Pakistanis to fight alongside the <b>Taliban</b> <b>and</b> Bin Laden {{against the forces of}} Ahmad Shah Massoud. Of the estimated 28,000 Afghan refugees returned from Pakistan fighting in Afghanistan, 8,000 were militants recruited in madrassas filling regular Taliban ranks.

25|$|During {{the first}} four months of its {{presence}} in Afghanistan, the Helmand Task Force was expected to take part in Operation Enduring Freedom, and help track down <b>Taliban</b> <b>and</b> <b>Al</b> Qaeda extremists. It was thus placed under the command of U.S. Major General Benjamin Freakley, commander of the Combined Joint Task Force 76. But being part of ISAF, it was also answerable to the ISAF Regional Command South, then led by a Canadian, Brigadier General David Fraser. This tangled chain of command was accompanied by a certain difficulty in defining the priority between two different and sometimes contradictory missions: either to win the support of the local population, or to fight and eliminate the Taliban.|$|E

2500|$|The {{involvement}} of the CIA in the newly coined [...] "War on Terror" [...] was further increased on September 15, 2001. During a meeting at Camp David George W. Bush agreed to adopt a plan proposed by CIA director George Tenet. This plan consisted of conducting a covert war in which CIA paramilitary officers would cooperate with anti-Taliban guerillas inside Afghanistan. They would later be joined by small special operations forces teams which would call in precision airstrikes on <b>Taliban</b> <b>and</b> <b>Al</b> Qaeda fighters. This plan was codified on September 16, 2001 with Bush's signature of an official Memorandum of Notification that allowed the plan to proceed.|$|E

2500|$|The 169th Fighter Wing, South Carolina Air National Guard, was {{the first}} ANG fighter unit to deploy to Southwest Asia in direct support of the air war over Afghanistan. It sent over 200 {{personnel}} and six F-16CJs in January 2002 to Al Udeid Air Base in Doha, Qatar, to assist air combat operations over Afghanistan. In particular, they provided Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAMs) against <b>Taliban</b> <b>and</b> <b>al</b> Qaeda positions, the only Air Force fighter unit in the theater to do so. F-16s sometimes were also configured for Cluster Bomb Units (CBUw). [...] In addition, F-16 pilots sometimes fired their 20mm gun against ground targets. Missions could last up to 10 hours with multiple air refuelings. After so many hours strapped in their seats, pilots generally received one to three days of crew rest. The unit returned to South Carolina on 3 April 2002.|$|E
40|$|The {{resurgence}} of the <b>Taliban</b> <b>and</b> the <b>al</b> Qaida are interwoven with {{the rising tide of}} militancy in the tribal areas of Pakistan. After the Taliban’s ouster from Afghanistan, the <b>al</b> Qaida <b>and</b> its supporters regrouped in the FATA and launched attacks on the US and NATO troops in Afghanistan. Pakistan, a major ally of the US on war upon terror tried to quell the insurgents but did not succeed. The cross-border infiltration and attacks on US troops continued, causing serious doubts about Pakistan’s sincerity in the suppression of the militancy. The present research focuses on these and other similar issues including the recent trust deficit between US and Pakistan and the essential measures for bringing stability to the region thus ensuring safe withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan by the end of 2014...|$|R
