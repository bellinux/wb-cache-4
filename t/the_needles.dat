5|$|The first {{reaction}} of the host tree is traced to the adult wasp and occurs after 10 to 14 days. A phytotoxic secretion of the wasp impairs metabolism in the shoots and needles, causing loss of water balance. The result is brown coloration of <b>the</b> <b>needles</b> and leaf drop. As with many other wood pests, fine resin drops in wasp boreholes {{are found in the}} central trunk. Attacked pines tend to develop flagging. Tip dieback begins with <b>the</b> <b>needles</b> becoming chlorotic and changing from green to yellowish-red, finally turning completely brown over a three- to six-month period. The wasp bores 1/8- to 3/8-inch-diameter holes in the tree. Unstressed trees may be attacked uniformly along the main stem, while trees with low osmotic phloem pressure are preferentially attacked, with denser clusters of boreholes.|$|E
5|$|After the {{monument}} was discovered and {{identified in the}} twentieth century, a folk motif came {{to be associated with}} it. According to this story, the circle's stones had landed in their location after having been hurled at Corfe Castle by the Devil. This is a variant of a story that has also been connected to the Agglestone Rock near Studland. According to stories associated with this large sandstone block, it had been thrown by the Devil from <b>The</b> <b>Needles</b> on the Isle of Wight, with the intention of hitting either the castle, Sherborne Abbey, Bindon Abbey, or Salisbury Cathedral.|$|E
5|$|Nos. 607 and 609 Squadrons {{engaged the}} Germans {{south-west}} of <b>The</b> <b>Needles.</b> The British reported 30–40 Bf 110s with 15 Do 17s in support. The tonnage of bombs dropped suggested {{there were fewer}} bombers than claimed. The RAF fighters claimed four Do 17s. The fact remains that the Germans penetrated the airspace without interception and {{came very close to}} inflicting critical damage to the Spitfire factory. The radar had done its job and alerted No. 11 and 10 Group 20 minutes before the bombs started to fall. The fault lay either with the No. 10 or 11 Group controllers who were late in ordering their Squadrons to scramble.|$|E
50|$|While {{maintaining}} a fixed position of <b>the</b> <b>needle,</b> <b>the</b> culture broth {{will be moved}} up <b>the</b> <b>needle</b> until <b>the</b> <b>needle</b> tip is submerged. During {{the withdrawal of the}} broth culture <b>the</b> <b>needle</b> and <b>the</b> <b>needle</b> hand should not move in order to prevent springing action. The transfer from broth to needle concludes with flaming the open end of the broth culture and the closing of the lid while keeping <b>the</b> <b>needle</b> hand immobile.|$|R
5000|$|If <b>the</b> <b>needle</b> reads [...] "fast," [...] {{then the}} plant's {{generator}} is slowed {{down by a}} very small amount and <b>the</b> <b>needle</b> turns counterclockwise (toward the zero mark). Alternatively, if <b>the</b> <b>needle</b> reads [...] "slow," [...] then the plant operator speeds the generator up slightly, and <b>the</b> <b>needle</b> turns clockwise. Slightly before <b>the</b> <b>needle</b> reaches <b>the</b> zero mark, the plant operator returns the generator to the grid frequency {{in order to stop}} <b>the</b> <b>needle</b> when it reaches the zero mark. When <b>the</b> <b>needle</b> is at zero and is not moving, the two systems are synchronized.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>needle</b> {{turns to}} point {{at a nearby}} charged object due to charges induced in the ends of <b>the</b> <b>needle</b> by <b>the</b> {{external}} charge, through electrostatic induction. For example, if a positively charged object is brought near, the mobile negative charges in the metal will be attracted to it, {{and move to the}} end of <b>the</b> <b>needle</b> nearest <b>the</b> object. The attractive force on these negative charges will then turn <b>the</b> <b>needle</b> until <b>the</b> end is nearest to the charged object, when it will stop. Conversely the positive charges in <b>the</b> <b>needle</b> will be repelled, and move {{to the far end of}} <b>the</b> <b>needle.</b> <b>The</b> repulsive forces will then push this end of <b>the</b> <b>needle</b> as far away from the object as possible. The result, after <b>the</b> <b>needle</b> stops swinging, is that the axis of <b>the</b> <b>needle</b> points through <b>the</b> object.|$|R
5|$|Over the centuries, {{the tree}} grows thicker and taller as {{successive}} rings develop around its trunk and new buds grow on the branches. The tree {{becomes part of}} an old growth forest with a shaded and damp understory of broadleaf trees, shrubs, and ferns. In the canopy, a mat of dead needles and lichen accumulate on the wide upper branches. Exposed to light, air, and rain, <b>the</b> <b>needles</b> decompose and the mat becomes colonized by insects, fungus, and new plants.|$|E
5|$|The fungus {{has been}} shown to provide a {{protective}} effect against heavy metal toxicity when associated with the host Pinus sylvestris, preventing copper accumulation in <b>the</b> <b>needles,</b> and protecting seedlings against cadmium toxicity. Owing to its frequent rate of sexual reproduction and the resulting extensive gene flow within populations, the fungus can rapidly evolve a trait to tolerate otherwise toxic levels of heavy metals in the environment. The genetic basis of this adaptation—intriguing to researchers investigating the bioremediation potential of metal-adapted plants and their fungal associates—are contained in the genome sequence of S.luteus, published in 2015.|$|E
5|$|In 1540 {{additional}} work {{was ordered to}} defend Cornwall. Carrick Roads was an important anchorage {{at the mouth of}} the River Fal and the original plans involved constructing five new fortifications to protect it, although only two castles, Pendennis and St Mawes, were actually built, on opposite sides of the estuary. Work began on further fortifications to protect the Solent in 1541, with the construction of Hurst Castle, overlooking <b>the</b> <b>Needles</b> Passage, and Netley Castle just outside Southampton itself. Following a royal visit to the north of England, the coastal fortifications around the town of Hull were upgraded in 1542 with a castle and two large blockhouses. Further work was carried out in Essex in 1543, with a total of seven fortifications constructed, three in Harwich itself, three protecting the estuary leading to the town, and two protecting the estuary linking into Colchester. St Andrew's Castle was begun to further protect the Solent.|$|E

50|$|An {{inoculation}} needle {{is used in}} inoculating {{a sterile}} broth culture. Flaming the open end of the broth will keep the it sterile. The broth will be moved up to <b>the</b> <b>needle</b> so that <b>the</b> <b>needle</b> tip is submerged while maintaining <b>the</b> <b>needle's</b> original position. Careful swirling of <b>the</b> <b>needle</b> can help <b>the</b> inoculation of the microorganism from <b>the</b> <b>needle</b> to <b>the</b> sterile broth.|$|R

25|$|A {{developing}} {{trend in}} the knitting world is interchangeable needles. These kits consist of pairs of needles with usually nylon cables or cords. The cables/cords are screwed into <b>the</b> <b>needles,</b> allowing the knitter to have both flexible straight needles or circular needles. This also allows the knitter to change the diameter and length of <b>the</b> <b>needles</b> as needed.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} a visual feedback system using a stereoscopic microscope that controls a micromanipulator {{so that a}} needle may pierce a target as much length as desired. At first, for achieving the manipulation at a realistic rate, we proposed a strategy of moving <b>the</b> <b>needle</b> head. Secondarily, we developed an algorithm for prediction of the tip position of <b>the</b> <b>needle</b> head within <b>the</b> target. Before <b>the</b> <b>needle</b> pierces <b>the</b> target, the shape of <b>the</b> <b>needle</b> head is preserved as a reference pattern. After <b>the</b> <b>needle</b> piercing <b>the</b> target, the shape of <b>the</b> <b>needle</b> head within <b>the</b> target is predicted using the reference pattern and the tip position of <b>the</b> <b>needle</b> head can be detected. Experimental {{results indicate that the}} proposed system may be useful in micromanipulation such as microinjection to seeds </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{success of}} {{minimally}} invasive procedures under MR-guidance {{can be increased}} by the knowledge of <b>the</b> current <b>needle</b> pose. We hypothesize that a one-toone mapping exists between <b>the</b> <b>needle</b> orientation {{with respect to the}} static magnetic field and the cross-sectional shape of <b>the</b> <b>needle’s</b> susceptibility artifact. For this purpose, we derived a mathematical model, which describes the cross sectional geometry of <b>the</b> <b>needle</b> artifact. It is approximated by two ellipses. Certain parameters of these ellipses can be utilized for mapping the geometry of <b>the</b> <b>needle</b> artifact onto <b>the</b> <b>needle</b> orientation. <b>The</b> relation between the two ellipse parameters α (inclination of the semi-major axis) and b (length of the semi-minor axis) and <b>the</b> <b>needle’s</b> azimuth angle can be approximated by linear regression in a certain angle interval. A combination of these two ellipse parameters is suitable for estimating <b>the</b> <b>needle’s</b> azimuth angle within a range between 0 ° and 60 °...|$|R

25|$|Needles, {{the adult}} leaves, are green (photosynthetic) and bundled in {{clusters}} called fascicles. <b>The</b> <b>needles</b> can number {{from one to}} seven per fascicle, but generally number from two to five. Each fascicle is produced from a small bud on a dwarf shoot in the axil of a scale leaf. These bud scales often remain on the fascicle as a basal sheath. <b>The</b> <b>needles</b> persist for 1.5–40 years, depending on species. If a shoot is damaged (e.g. eaten by an animal), the needle fascicles just below the damage will generate a bud which can then replace the lost leaves.|$|E

30|$|We {{have been}} researching the method {{to enhance the}} {{targeting}} in breast tissue, named a preloading-based <b>needle</b> insertion method. <b>The</b> concept of the method is that before inserting <b>the</b> <b>needle,</b> <b>the</b> breast is pressed by the preloading probe to stabilize the tumor as <b>the</b> <b>needle</b> approaches. During <b>the</b> <b>needle</b> insertion phase, <b>the</b> <b>needle</b> direction does not change to avoid damaging internal tissues. Insertion is stopped when the tumor position and needle tip are closest. Thus, this method has a preloading phase and a needle insertion phase to locate the preloading probe and pierce the breast tissue. The preloading phase hardens the tissue between the target and <b>the</b> <b>needle</b> tip to stabilize the tumor and {{make it easier to}} pierce the tissue during <b>the</b> <b>needle</b> insertion phase.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>needle</b> complex {{starts at}} the {{cytoplasm}} of the bacterium, crosses the two membranes and protrudes from the cell. The part anchored in the membrane is the base (or basal body) of the T3SS. The extracellular part is <b>the</b> <b>needle.</b> A so-called inner rod connects <b>the</b> <b>needle</b> to <b>the</b> base. <b>The</b> <b>needle</b> itself, although <b>the</b> biggest and most prominent part of the T3SS, {{is made out of}} many units of a single protein. The majority of the different T3SS proteins are therefore those that build the base and those that are secreted into the host. As mentioned above, <b>the</b> <b>needle</b> complex shares similarities with bacterial flagella. More specifically, the base of <b>the</b> <b>needle</b> complex is structurally very similar to the flagellar base; <b>the</b> <b>needle</b> itself is analogous to the flagellar hook, a structure connecting the base to the flagellar filament.|$|R
