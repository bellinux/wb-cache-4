500|$|The film {{includes}} 33 {{minutes of}} animation. Its animators at the Nickelodeon Animation Studios at Burbank, California sketched {{the outlines of}} the story in a year. Paul Tibbitt, the show's supervising producer who also serves as the showrunner, explained [...] "We're one of the last shows <b>that</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> the old-fashioned way, like they used to do it back in the Warner Brothers days." ...|$|E
60|$|THE BOYS. Hear, hear! Thats right. Thats fair. <b>That</b> <b>does</b> <b>it.</b> Now Blanco. Own up.|$|E
60|$|JOHN [after looking her over]. What's her age? She looks young, {{but they}} say it's the curls <b>that</b> <b>does</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "No, you couldn't, Dick. <b>It's</b> not he <b>that's</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it.</b> It's Ellen; {{you know}} that well enough; and you've just got to stand it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I--I am not well, sir," [...] said Dick {{in a low}} voice. [...] "None of us are. But it was not liquor <b>that</b> <b>did</b> <b>it.</b> It was the vapor." ...|$|R
60|$|THE ELDER MISS WETHERELL. Perhaps she's young, and hasn't {{commenced}} it. I fancy it's {{only the}} older ones <b>that</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Stop!" [...] shouted Eemerk, [...] "you {{want to kill}} us. What great {{creature}} is <b>that?</b> <b>Does</b> <b>it</b> come from the moon or the sun? Does it eat fire and smoke?" ...|$|E
60|$|ATHENE. [Playing with a leathern {{button on}} his coat] If you'd watched it ever since you could watch anything, seen it kill out all--It's having power <b>that</b> <b>does</b> <b>it.</b> I know Father's got awfully good points.|$|E
6000|$|... "Quite so," [...] I {{answered}} quietly. I {{had known}} men before {{who had lost}} their jobs. It is generally the cramping of the atmosphere <b>that</b> <b>does</b> <b>it.</b> Some of them can use up a tremendous lot of horizon.|$|E
5000|$|In 2014 the Sun-Sentinel {{was named}} one of the [...] "10 Newspapers <b>That</b> <b>Do</b> <b>It</b> Right" [...] by Editor & Publisher magazine.|$|R
50|$|Schreck {{develops}} {{software that}} can create sounds <b>that</b> <b>do</b> {{not exist in}} nature and modify those <b>that</b> <b>do.</b> <b>It</b> {{is also used to}} emulate sounds generated by obsolete electronic equipment.|$|R
60|$|Bessie. It's the {{brooding}} {{over his}} hope <b>that's</b> <b>done</b> <b>it.</b> People teased him so. It's his fondness for you that's troubled his mind.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm beginnin' to see through't," [...] murmured Junkie, after {{watching}} for some time. [...] "See! he has hooked another. Ye see, Tonal', {{it must be}} lettin' the hook drift away down under the ledges <b>that</b> <b>does</b> <b>it.</b> Look! He's got 'im!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why {{are these}} Governments always {{doing what we}} don't want them to do? We should not be {{fighting}} in the Cirenaica if we were all Italians. It is the Government <b>that</b> <b>does</b> <b>it.</b> They talk and talk and do things with us: but we don't want them.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mark how the Navy 'olds it's own. He's sober. The Agathites are not, as {{you might}} say, an' yet they can't live with 'im. It's the {{discipline}} <b>that</b> <b>does</b> <b>it.</b> 'Ark to the bald an' unconvincin' watch-officer chimin' in. I wonder where Mr. Moorshed has got to?" ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>That</b> <b>did</b> <b>it.</b> Gullett {{shut off}} the Pirate threat immediately, {{striking}} out the side in the seventh and finishing with [...] hitless innings for the save.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hush! Bygones be bygones, {{and those}} <b>that</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> {{are in their}} graves long ago. But it was too hard of him on the poor thing." ...|$|R
6000|$|DR. FREEMANTLE. Old! Good Lord no! First Lord Bantock {{was only}} Vernon's great-grandfather. That {{is the woman}} <b>that</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> all. [He {{is looking at the}} Hoppner.] ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We'll {{hope they}} aren't in training. Now for the list. First I want Flint. It's the Euclid <b>that</b> <b>does</b> <b>it.</b> You must work {{deductions}} with me. Perowne, extra mechanical drawing. Dawson goes to Mr. King for extra Latin, and Venner {{to me for}} German. Have I damaged the First Fifteen much?" [...] He smiled sweetly.|$|E
6000|$|... 'It's the field-work, sir--the field-work, <b>that</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> all. They get {{accustomed}} {{there from}} their childhood to hear words whose very meanings they shouldn't know; {{and the older}} teach the younger ones, and the married ones are worst of all. It wears them out in body, sir, that field-work, and makes them brutes in soul and in manners.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes that I did. What glorious loveliness! There {{is nothing}} <b>that</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> justice but the {{description}} in the lecture. Oh I forgot, {{you have not}} heard it. You must let me read it to you by and by. Those two little angels, what faces they have. Perfect innocence--one full of reasoning, the other of unreasoning adoration!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The two of yez are {{no better}} nor simpletons," [...] said Richard, magisterially. [...] "'Twarn't he <b>that</b> <b>done</b> <b>it.</b> The likes of him couldn't do the likes o' that." ...|$|R
60|$|ATHENE. He works fearfully hard; he's upright, and plucky. He's not stingy. But he's smothered his animal nature-and <b>that's</b> <b>done</b> <b>it.</b> I don't {{want to see}} you smother anything, Guy.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, no matter--don't want it {{this kind}} of weather. I know the man <b>that</b> <b>did</b> <b>it.</b> I'll get him. Now, here is the way this stuff ought to be written." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{can always}} bowl like blazes after lunch,' said the fast man to Pringle. 'It's the lobster salad <b>that</b> <b>does</b> <b>it,</b> I think.' Four {{for a hundred}} and fifty-seven had changed to seven for a hundred and fifty-nine {{in the course of}} a single over. Gethryn's calculations, if he had only known, could have done now with a little revision.|$|E
6000|$|Watts {{rubbed his}} jaw. [...] "Well, it's a {{difficult}} situation, Harris. I {{have to let}} the men leave the grounds sometimes. They can see the forest from the buildings, {{and as long as}} you can see a nice place to stretch out and relax <b>that</b> <b>does</b> <b>it.</b> Once every ten days they have a full period of rest. Then they go out and fool around." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{my flesh}} that's beat me, sir," [...] said he. [...] "It creeps over me amazin' fast. I should fight at thirteen-eight, and 'ere I am nearly seventeen. It's the {{business}} <b>that</b> <b>does</b> <b>it,</b> what with loflin' about {{behind the bar}} all day, and bein' afraid to refuse a wet for fear of offendin' a customer. It's been the ruin of many a good fightin'-man before me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course; I can't help thinkin' so, because I see it," [...] {{returned}} O'Rook. [...] "Was it a fall, now, w'en you was a babby, <b>that</b> <b>did</b> <b>it,</b> or measles?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's true, Miss Newson. We'll hear news of {{this some}} day depend on't, and who <b>it</b> was <b>that</b> <b>did</b> <b>it.</b> I wouldn't stand for it {{hindering}} myself; but you, Miss Newson----" ...|$|R
50|$|Accent {{and tone}} {{are the most}} {{variable}} aspect of Japanese dialects. Some have no accent at all; of those <b>that</b> <b>do,</b> <b>it</b> may occur {{in addition to a}} high or low word tone.|$|R
6000|$|Then the pluck of {{the revolutionary}} McSpadden rose to the occasion, and he replied with fervor, [...] "Out of my house, the whole beggarly tribe of you! I was beguiled by the books, but shall never be beguiled again--once is {{sufficient}} for me." [...] And turning to William he shouted, [...] "Yes, you did save my wife's life, and the next man <b>that</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> shall die in his tracks!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If Cornelia {{has seen}} fit {{at last to}} hold out the hand of {{reconciliation}} I'm glad enough to take it. Dear knows, I've wanted to make up often enough, but I didn't think she ever would. We've both of us got too much pride and stubbornness. It's the Turner blood in us <b>that</b> <b>does</b> <b>it.</b> The Turners were all so set. But I mean to do my part now she has done hers." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{authority}} in Holmes's voice had its effect upon the bearers. Peters had suddenly {{vanished into the}} house, and they obeyed these new orders. [...] "Quick, Watson, quick! Here is a screw-driver!" [...] he shouted as the coffin was replaced upon the table. [...] "Here's one for you, my man! A sovereign if the lid comes off in a minute! Ask no questions--work away! That's good! Another! And another! Now pull all together! It's giving! It's giving! Ah, <b>that</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> at last." ...|$|E

6000|$|Sir Richard {{had drawn}} back a step. [...] "I trust {{neither of these}} gentlemen knows me," [...] he said. [...] "I would not be seen here by any <b>that</b> <b>did.</b> <b>It</b> might {{compromise}} you." ...|$|R
