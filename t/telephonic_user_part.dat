50|$|The SS7 {{protocol}} stack may be partially mapped to the OSI Model of a packetized digital {{protocol stack}}. OSI layers 1 to 3 {{are provided by}} the Message Transfer Part (MTP) and the Signalling Connection Control Part (SCCP) of the SS7 protocol (together {{referred to as the}} Network Service Part (NSP)); for circuit related signaling, such as the BT IUP, Telephone <b>User</b> <b>Part</b> (TUP), or the ISDN <b>User</b> <b>Part</b> (ISUP), the <b>User</b> <b>Part</b> provides layer 7. Currently there are no protocol components that provide OSI layers 4 through 6. The Transaction Capabilities Application Part (TCAP) is the primary SCCP User in the Core Network, using SCCP in connectionless mode. SCCP in connection oriented mode provides transport layer for air interface protocols such as BSSAP and RANAP. TCAP provides transaction capabilities to its Users (TC-Users), such as the Mobile Application Part, the Intelligent Network Application Part and the CAMEL Application Part.|$|R

5000|$|The {{earliest}} deployed {{upper layer}} protocols in the SS7 suite were dedicated to the setup, maintenance, and release of telephone calls. [...] The Telephone <b>User</b> <b>Part</b> (TUP) was adopted in Europe and the Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) <b>User</b> <b>Part</b> (ISUP) adapted for {{public switched telephone network}} (PSTN) calls was adopted in North America. ISUP was later used in Europe when the European networks upgraded to the ISDN. [...] North America has not accomplished full upgrade to the ISDN, and the predominant telephone service is still the older Plain Old Telephone Service. Due to its richness and the need for an out-of-band channel for its operation, SS7 is mostly used for signaling between telephone switches and not for signaling between local exchanges and customer-premises equipment.|$|R

50|$|The Message Transfer Part (MTP) {{covers a}} portion of the {{functions}} of the OSI network layer including: network interface, information transfer, message handling and routing to the higher levels. Signalling Connection Control Part (SCCP) is at functional Level 4. Together with MTP Level 3 it is called the Network Service Part (NSP). SCCP completes the functions of the OSI network layer: end-to-end addressing and routing, connectionless messages (UDTs), and management services for users of the Network Service <b>Part</b> (NSP). Telephone <b>User</b> <b>Part</b> (TUP) is a link-by-link signaling system used to connect calls. ISUP is the key <b>user</b> <b>part,</b> providing a circuit-based protocol to establish, maintain, and end the connections for calls.
