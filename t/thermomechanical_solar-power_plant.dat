5000|$|Madhya Pradesh {{is one of}} India's most solar-developed states, {{with its}} total {{photovoltaic}} capacity reaching 1,117 MW {{by the end of}} July 2017. The Welspun Solar MP project, the largest <b>solar-power</b> <b>plant</b> in the state, was built at a cost of [...] on 305 ha of land and will supply power at [...] per kWh. A 130 MW <b>solar-power</b> <b>plant</b> project at Bhagwanpura, a village in Neemuch district, was launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It is the largest solar producer, and Welspun Energy {{is one of the top}} three companies in India's renewable-energy sector.A planned 750 MW <b>solar-power</b> <b>plant</b> in Rewa district will, when completed, be the world's largest <b>solar-power</b> <b>plant.</b>|$|R
50|$|Capital {{subsidies}} were {{applicable to}} rooftop <b>solar-power</b> <b>plants</b> up {{to a maximum}} of 500 kW. The 30-percent subsidy was reduced to 15 percent.|$|R
5000|$|There are <b>solar-power</b> <b>plants</b> {{located on}} the {{northern}} coast of Marado, a scarce sight in South Korea. Combined capacity is about the plants provide 27 households with electricity.|$|R
50|$|Other {{facilities}} include Wi-Fi, {{a health}} centre {{with a doctor}} and nurse, a water-purification plant, an entrepreneurial-development center, a 100KW <b>solar-power</b> <b>plant</b> with 400 solar panels, an Andhra Pradesh State Skill Development Corporation incubation center and a 50-buses fleet with service to Guntur, Tenali, Vijayawada and other major towns and mandals.|$|R
50|$|The Mysore City Corporation {{is setting}} up a large solar power plant in Mysore with a 50-percent {{concession}} from the government of India. The Maharashtra State Power Generation Company (Mahagenco) planned to set up four 200 MW power plants in the state.Delhi Metro Rail Corporation plans to install rooftop <b>solar-power</b> <b>plants</b> at the Anand Vihar and Pragati Maidan metro stations and its residential complex at Pushp Vihar.|$|R
50|$|Solar energy, {{generated}} mainly {{during the}} day in the non-monsoon period, complements wind in India. Solar panels can be located in the space between the towers of wind-power plants. It also complements hydroelectricity, generated primarily during India's monsoon months. <b>Solar-power</b> <b>plants</b> can be installed near existing hydropower and pumped-storage hydroelectricity, utilizing the existing power infrastructure and storing the surplus secondary power generated by the solar plants.|$|R
50|$|The 2016 {{manufacturing}} {{capacity of}} solar cells and solar modules in India was 1,212 MW and 5,620 MW, respectively. Except for crystalline silicon wafers or cadmium telluride photovoltaics, nearly 80 percent of solar-panel weight is flat glass. One hundred to 150 tons of flat glass {{is used to}} manufacture a one-MW solar panel. Low-iron flat or float glass is manufactured from soda ash and iron-free silica. Soda-ash manufacturing from common salt is an energy-intensive process {{if it is not}} extracted from soda lakes or glasswort cultivation in alkali soil. To increase installation of photovoltaic <b>solar-power</b> <b>plants,</b> the production of flat glass and its raw materials must expand to eliminate supply constraints or future imports.|$|R
50|$|Land {{is scarce}} in India, and per-capita land {{availability}} is low. Dedication {{of land for}} the installation of solar arrays must compete with other needs. The amount of land required for utility-scale solar power plants is about 1 km2 for every 40-60 MW generated. One alternative {{is to use the}} water-surface area on canals, lakes, reservoirs, farm ponds and the sea for large <b>solar-power</b> <b>plants.</b> These water bodies can also provide water to clean the solar panels. Highways and railways may also avoid the cost of land nearer load centres, minimising transmission-line costs by having solar plants about 10 meters above the roads or rail tracks. Solar power generated by road areas may also be used for in-motion charging of electric vehicles, reducing fuel costs. Highways would avoid damage from rain and summer heat, increasing comfort for commuters.|$|R
25|$|Johnson enlisted J.P. Plunier {{to produce}} his fourth {{full-length}} studio album, Sleep Through the Static. It was recorded using 100% solar energy at the <b>Solar-Powered</b> Plastic <b>Plant</b> studio in Los Angeles. The album featured Gill (keys), Podlewski (bass) and Topol (drums, percussion). Sleep Through the Static {{was released on}} February 1, 2008, and {{was followed by a}} world tour.|$|R
40|$|Most of the {{traditional}} convolutional neural networks (CNNs) implements bottom-up approach (feed-forward) for image classifications. However, many scientific studies demonstrate that visual perception in primates rely on both bottom-up and top-down connections. Therefore, in this work, we propose a CNN network with feedback structure for Solar power plant detection on middle-resolution satellite images. To express {{the strength of the}} top-down connections, we introduce feedback CNN network (FB-Net) to a baseline CNN model used for solar power plant classification on multi-spectral satellite data. Moreover, we introduce a method to improve class activation mapping (CAM) to our FB-Net, which takes advantage of multi-channel pulse coupled neural network (m-PCNN) for weakly-supervised localization of the solar power plants from the features of proposed FB-Net. For the proposed FB-Net CAM with m-PCNN, experimental results demonstrated promising results on both <b>solar-power</b> <b>plant</b> image classification and detection task.

5000|$|The 125-MW Sakri solar {{plant is}} the largest <b>solar-power</b> <b>plant</b> in Maharashtra. The Shri Saibaba Sansthan Trust has the world's largest solar steam system. It was {{constructed}} at the Shirdi shrine at an estimated cost of , [...] which was paid as a subsidy by the renewable-energy ministry. The system is used to cook 50,000 meals per day for pilgrims visiting the shrine, resulting in annual savings of 100,000 kg of cooking gas, and was designed to generate steam for cooking {{even in the absence}} of electricity to run the circulating pump. The project to install and commission the system was completed in seven months, and the system has a design life of 25 years. The Osmanabad region in Maharashtra has abundant sunlight, and is ranked the third-best region in India in solar insolation. A 10 MW solar power plant in Osmanabad was commissioned in 2013.|$|R
5000|$|In March 2013, {{the company}} {{commissioned}} the 50-MW Phalodi solar plant, which {{that time was}} the largest solar plant in India. [...] In December 2013 the company commissioned an 8-MW solar project in Karnataka. In February 2014, it inaugurated the 151-MW Neemuch solar project in Madhya Pradesh, which is the India's largest and among the world largest <b>solar-power</b> <b>plants.</b> [...] In April 2014, GE Energy Financial Services invested US$24 million in this project. This was also GE's first investment into a renewable energy project in India. In May 2014, the company commissioned a 19 MW solar power project in Chitradurga district of Karnataka. [...] Together with the Maharashtra State Power Generation Company WEL has developed a 50 MW solar power plant at Baramati in Pune district. In August 2015, the company commissioned a 34-MW solar project in Bhatinda district of Punjab. The company aims to develop a total of 550 MW solar capacities in Karnataka, 100 MW in Andhra Pradesh, and 150 MW in Punjab.|$|R
50|$|<b>Solar-power</b> <b>plants</b> {{equipped}} with battery-storage systems where net energy metering is used can feed stored electricity into {{the power grid}} when its frequency is below the rated parameter (50 Hz) and draw excess power from the grid when its frequency is above the rated parameter. Excursions {{above and below the}} rated grid frequency occur about 100 times daily. The solar-plant owner would receive nearly double the price for electricity sent into the grid compared to that consumed from the grid if a frequency-based tariff is offered to rooftop solar plants or plants dedicated to a distribution substation. A power-purchase agreement (PPA) is not needed for solar plants with a battery storage system to serve ancillary-service operations and transmit generated electricity for captive consumption using an open-access facility. Battery storage is popular in India, with more than 10 million households using battery backup during load shedding. Battery storage systems are also used to improve the power factor. Battery storage is also used economically to reduce daily/monthly peak power demand for minimising the monthly demand charges from the utility to the commercial and industrial establishments.|$|R
