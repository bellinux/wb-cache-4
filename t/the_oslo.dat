Named the Holmenkollen Kandahar, it was inaugurated in 1947. The event {{was held in}} Rødkleiva in 1947–48, 1950–51, 1953, 1957–58, and 1960–63. From 1972 the slalom event was held at Kirkerudbakken in Bærum the years it was in <b>the</b> <b>Oslo</b> area and from 1977 it was held in Wyllerløypa when held in <b>the</b> <b>Oslo</b> area.

50|$|Oslo has Norway's most {{extensive}} public transport system, managed by Ruter. This includes <b>the</b> six-line <b>Oslo</b> Metro, <b>the</b> world's {{most extensive}} metro per resident, <b>the</b> six-line <b>Oslo</b> Tramway and <b>the</b> eight-line <b>Oslo</b> Commuter Rail. <b>The</b> tramway operates within the areas {{close to the}} city centre, while the metro, which runs underground through the city centre, operates to suburbs further away; this includes two lines that operate to Bærum, and the Ring Line which loops to areas north of <b>the</b> centre. <b>Oslo</b> is also covered by a bus network consisting of 32 city lines, as well as regional buses to the neighboring county of Akershus.|$|R
5|$|In 1954, <b>the</b> <b>Oslo</b> City Council {{decided to}} build a four-line metro to the new suburbs {{to the east of}} the city center. The plans would lead to the system opening in 1966, after the {{conversion}} of the Østensjø and the Lambertseter Line of <b>the</b> <b>Oslo</b> Tramway to metro standard, and supplemented with the new Furuset and Grorud Line. The system would feature higher and longer platforms, allowing step-free access to six-car trains, automatic train protection and third rail power supply. This would make the metro incompatible with the existing tramways.|$|E

5|$|On 1 July 2003, Oslo Sporveier was reorganized {{with the}} {{operation}} of the trams transferred to Oslo Sporvognsdrift ("Oslo Tram Operations") and {{the operation of}} the Metro to Oslo T-banedrift ("Oslo Metro Operations"). Another reorganization was made on 1 July 2006, when Oslo Sporveier was demerged into two companies. <b>The</b> <b>Oslo</b> Public Transport Administration, which kept <b>the</b> <b>Oslo</b> Sporveier brand name, was made responsible for purchasing and the marketing of the public transport system. The ownership and maintenance of the tracks and stations was transferred to Kollektivtransportproduksjon ("Public Transport Production"). The latter also became the parent of the operating companies, who retained the actual running of the trams and metro trains. The brand name Oslo Sporveier was discontinued on 1 January 2008, when Ruter was created as a merger between <b>the</b> <b>Oslo</b> Public Transport Administration and Stor-Oslo Lokaltrafikk ("Greater Oslo Local Traffic")—which had been responsible for public transport in Akershus.|$|E

5|$|A {{planning}} {{office was}} established in 1962, initially led by Erik Himle. The final plans for the route were passed by parliament in 1968, and construction started in 1971. The rationale for {{the building of the}} station was that Frogner was to be developed as a dense, commercial district. However, to cut costs with <b>the</b> <b>Oslo</b> Tunnel, it was decided that parts of Nationaltheatret would not be built yet, and that Elisenberg Station would not open until after the tunnel was completed. By 1978, the platform area had been built, but the access way had not. The investments cost 30 million Norwegian krone (NOK), 75 mill. of 1998 standard. <b>The</b> <b>Oslo</b> Tunnel opened, without Elisenberg Station, on 1 June 1980.|$|E

5|$|Forskningsparken is a {{rapid transit}} {{station on the}} Sognsvann Line of <b>the</b> <b>Oslo</b> Metro.

It is located at the north of the Blindern campus of the University of Oslo in the Nordre Aker borough of Oslo, Norway. The {{decision}} to build the station was made in 1998, and it opened in 1999, replacing the former station Vestgrensa, and allowed interchange between the metro and the tramway. The Ullevål Hageby Line was at the same time extended to serve the new Rikshospitalet. Forskningsparken is served by lines 3, 4 and 6 of the metro, each operating every 15minutes and providing services along both the Sognsvann Line and the Ring Line. Lines 17 and 18 of the tramway serve Forskningsparken, operating to Rikshospitalet and the city center.|$|E

They were test-run on the existing tramways from 1959 to 1960, and were then put into service on the Kolsås Line. Prone to technical faults, they were taken out of regular service in 1982.|$|E

30|$|Next, {{consider}} {{the loss of}} toll revenues {{as a result of}} EVs being exempted from road tolls in <b>the</b> case of <b>Oslo.</b> <b>The</b> current <b>Oslo</b> toll ring system was implemented in 1990 to generate funds for road investments in <b>the</b> larger <b>Oslo</b> area. Currently, approximately 60  % of toll income is being used for investments and for the maintenance of public transport. The use of a large share of toll income on public transport may be seen as strategy to induce people to use public transport. It follows then that if EVs are exempted from paying tolls, toll revenue from the toll ring will decrease.|$|R
5|$|In 1960, <b>the</b> <b>Oslo</b> City Council {{voted to}} close the street tramway and replace all routes with either diesel buses or <b>the</b> <b>Oslo</b> Metro. The {{specific}} plans for the Ekeberg Line were not decided, although the line was considered either to be a stand-alone light rail or connected to the metro. From 30 October 1960, the route for the Ekeberg Line trams in the city changed, so they instead followed the route Schweigaards gate – Vognmannsgata – Jernbanetorget – Kirkeristen to Stortorvet instead of the old route via Grønland and Brugata. From 1963, the route terminated at Jernbanetorget, after {{the rest of the}} route was closed due to the construction of the metro.|$|E
