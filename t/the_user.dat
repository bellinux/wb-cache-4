5|$|Over {{the course}} of its development, the Sharingan will grant <b>the</b> <b>user</b> three unique abilities: The first being its famous ability for <b>the</b> <b>user</b> to {{instantly}} memorize and replicate any opponent's movement and attacks with perfect accuracy.

This also allows <b>the</b> <b>user</b> to easily recognize genjutsu and different forms of chakra (i.e.: to visualize chakra in different colors). Its final ability is a brand of scenarios that suggests actions and thoughts to the opponent, acting as {{an effective way to}} produce beyond genjutsu abilities or implant memories in another person.|$|E

30|$|Consider the case, when <b>the</b> <b>users</b> {{report their}} utility {{functions}} {{to a central}} controller, e.g., base station.

50|$|A {{scoreboard}} on the upper-right {{keeps track}} of <b>the</b> <b>user's</b> score. <b>The</b> <b>user's</b> score starts at zero, and is incremented whenever two tiles combine, by {{the value of the}} new tile.

5|$|The TRIM command {{also needs}} {{the support of}} the SSD. If the {{firmware}} in the SSD does not have support for the TRIM command, the LBAs received with the TRIM command will not be marked as invalid and the drive will continue to garbage collect the data assuming it is still valid. Only when the OS saves new data into those LBAs will the SSD know to mark the original LBA as invalid. SSD Manufacturers that did not originally build TRIM support into their drives can either offer a firmware upgrade to <b>the</b> <b>user,</b> or provide a separate utility that extracts the information on the invalid data from the OS and separately TRIMs the SSD. The benefit would be realized only after each run of that utility by <b>the</b> <b>user.</b> <b>The</b> <b>user</b> could set up that utility to run periodically in the background as an automatically scheduled task.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} a requirements engineerings {{method that}} makes heavy use of linguistic instruments.
