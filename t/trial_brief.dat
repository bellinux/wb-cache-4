40|$|This {{pilot study}} tested the overall and {{relative}} efficacy of 3 common approaches to multicultural {{education in a}} sample (N 52) of White undergraduate students using a randomized controlled <b>trial.</b> <b>Brief</b> multicultural education interventions were delivered {{in the form of}} educational, social norming, and entertainment conditions. Affective (i. e., White guilt) and cognitive (i. e., awareness of White privilege) outcomes of interventions were assessed. Possible causal relations between intervention condition, White guilt, and awareness of White privilege were also examined. Analyses revealed a main effect and large effect size for intervention condition. Results showed that education and entertainment conditions produced higher scores on a measure of White guilt compared with control and that the entertainment condition produced higher scores on awareness of White privilege compared with all other conditions. Mediation analyses revealed that observed changes in White guilt scores from pretest to posttest explained the relationship between intervention condition and awareness of White privilege. Findings did not support a causal ordering with changes in awareness of White privilege as a mediator of intervention condition and White guilt. Results suggest that brief multicultural education interventions are effective and that entertainment-oriented interventions may be particularly useful in terms of producing desired changes in White college students...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: We {{describe}} {{a review of}} published main reports of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), {{in order to measure}} the frequency of reported use of data monitoring committees (DMCs) and factors associated with reported DMC use. METHODS: Twenty-four higher impact general and specialist medical journals were handsearched for main reports of RCTs in order to provide a cross-sectional sample of trials published in the year 2000. Additionally, the same general medical journals were handsearched for 1990 to allow a comparison across time. RESULTS: Of 662 RCTs published in 2000, 120 (18 %) explicitly reported using a DMC, while 107 (16 %) reported planned interim analyses. Overall, about a quarter (24 %) reported at least one of these. A higher proportion of trials reported using a DMC in 2000 than 1 990 (70 / 282, 25 % versus 21 / 204, 10 %) in the general medical journals. Logistic regression models suggested the more important variables associated with increased reported DMC use were: later year of publication, publication in general medical journal, survival-based endpoint, multicentre trial, increasing number of patients recruited, at least one arm involving a placebo, at least one arm involving a drug, factorial design and USA involvement in the trial. CONCLUSIONS: In 2000, about a quarter of main RCT reports mention use of a DMC. Actual use of DMCs is likely to be somewhat greater. Reporting use of a DMC was more likely for larger and longer trials among other factors. We believe the factors affecting reported use affect actual use. It is recommended that when a DMC oversees a <b>trial,</b> <b>brief</b> details should be explicitly included in the main trial paper. Standard nomenclature for DMCs is recommended...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{two studies}} of mono-pulse braking for rear-end collision avoidance applications. The first {{study was a}} single-vehicle parameter-setting study without a lead vehicle that produced recommended pulse braking display duration and jerk rate. However, results also indicated that pulse braking display magnitude influenced the magnitude of driver braking behavior. A second study examined {{the impact of this}} driver interface concept both when a lead vehicle was braking to a stop and when the display came on even though the lead vehicle was not slowing down. The results indicated that in the first case drivers modulated their response according to the constraints of the situation rather than the magnitude of the haptic display. On approximately one-third of false positive <b>trials,</b> <b>brief</b> and mild inappropriate braking responses were recorded...|$|R
