25|$|I {{should be}} bitter, but I am not. Disappointed, yes, because {{after so many}} heartbreaks this was a rather {{ruthless}} end. I was the fall guy, the player who carried the ACB flag all summer against all the odds. I had <b>to</b> <b>cop</b> it sweet then, and I had <b>to</b> <b>cop</b> my dismissal the same way... We were lambs to the slaughter anyway. Besides or own cricketing shortcomings, we were forced o play on wickets that suited the Englishmen and were alien to us; we copped the bad end of umpiring decisions to a damning degree throughout the Ashes series and we were crucified by media in many quarters from beginning to end. All this, combined with the talented opposition which was expected to whitewash us anyway, was just too much. The hurt that remains is that I tried so hard, {{and so did the}} young, raw team that took on so much despite all the ods. My name is now eternally entrenched in the cords books as the man who led this country to that ignominious hiding against England.|$|E
25|$|In the 2004-2005 Philippine Cup (formerly the All-Filipino Cup), the Beermen {{finished}} the classification phase {{with an even}} 9-9 record. In the quarterfinals, San Miguel swept the Sta. Lucia Realtors in a three-game series. Then, the Beermen also swept Alaska in the quarterfinals. In the semis against sister rival Barangay Ginebra, the Beermen took a 2-1 series in the best-of-five affair but the Kings won the next two games to win the series, that capped with Rodney Santos' game-winner in the deciding game. The Beermen then beat Shell <b>to</b> <b>cop</b> third-place in the tournament.|$|E
25|$|I knew I {{was going}} <b>to</b> <b>cop</b> {{a lot of}} stick {{but it will be}} like water off a duck's back...I {{expected}} stick {{at the start of the}} innings, and I'm sure it will carry on through the whole series. But I just sat back and laughed at the opposition, with their swearing and 'traitor' remarks... some of them can hardly speak English. My affiliation is with England. In fact, I'm starting to speak too much like Darren Gough... In fact, I'm going to get one of Gough's tattoos with three lions and my number underneath...No one can say I'm not English.|$|E

25|$|The insurgents {{began to}} retreat {{later in the}} day. Quick {{reaction}} forces (QRF) from 1st Battalion, 32nd Infantry Regiment did not reach the outpost until 7:00pm that day, while insurgents remained {{in parts of the}} outpost as late as 5:10pm. Relief had been slowed in reaching COP Keating {{due to a lack of}} available aircraft and density of terrain. Members of 10th Mountain Division’s 1-32 Infantry Regiment were air lifted to the nearest helicopter landing zone on OP Fritsche and arrived at approximately 1400 hrs, as recalled by a soldier on scene. After assisting with securing the OP from potential follow on attacks, members of the Quick Reaction Force descended from the mountain’s peak <b>to</b> <b>COP</b> Keating on foot. While in route the Platoon encountered a planned ambush on the side of the mountain resulting in three confirmed enemy KIA at approximately 1800 hrs. After dispensing with the enemy, QRF continued their descent and entered the outpost at approximately 1900 hrs. At such time the platoon cleared the remaining areas of the outpost which members of 3-61 had not yet retaken. Within moments of entry, members of the QRF discovered and confirmed the death of Sgt. Joshua Hardt, who until this time had been MIA. Follow-up attacks attempted by Taliban forces were subsequently thwarted by U.S. aircraft.|$|E
