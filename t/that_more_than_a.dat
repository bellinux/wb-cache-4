25|$|Blacks cleared land, selling {{timber and}} {{developing}} bottomland to achieve ownership. In 1900, two-thirds of farm owners in Mississippi were blacks, a major achievement {{for them and}} their families. Due to the poor economy, low cotton prices and difficulty of getting credit, many of these farmers could not make it through the extended financial difficulties. Two decades later, the majority of African Americans were sharecroppers.

25|$|During the Gilded Age, highly {{prominent}} laity such as banker J. P.

These philanthropists propelled the Episcopal Church into a quasi-national position of importance while at the same time giving the church a central role in the cultural transformation of the country. Another mark of influence is the fact <b>that</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> quarter of all presidents of the United States have been Episcopalians (see religious affiliations of Presidents of the United States). It was during this period that the Book of Common Prayer was revised, first in 1892 and later in 1928.|$|E

25|$|It {{is unclear}} quite how {{the letters of}} Abelard and Héloïse came to be preserved. There are brief and factual {{references}} to their relationship by 12th-century writers including William Godel and Walter Map. It seems unlikely, however, that the letters were widely known in this period. Rather, the earliest manuscripts of the letters are dated to the late 13th century. It therefore {{seems likely that the}} letters sent between Abelard and Héloïse were kept by Héloïse at the Paraclete along with the 'Letters of Direction', and <b>that</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> century after her death they were brought to Paris and copied.

25|$|A {{screening}} {{program a}} year later in 2012 found <b>that</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> third (36%) of children in Fukushima Prefecture have abnormal growths in their thyroid glands. As of August 2013, {{there have been more}} than 40 children newly diagnosed with thyroid cancer and other cancers in Fukushima prefecture as a whole. In 2015, the number of thyroid cancers or detections of developing thyroid cancers numbered 137. However, whether these incidences of cancer are elevated above the rate in un-contaminated areas and therefore were due to exposure to nuclear radiation is unknown at this stage. Data from the Chernobyl accident showed that an unmistakable rise in thyroid cancer rates following the disaster in 1986 only began after a cancer incubation period of 3–5 years; however, whether this data can be directly compared to the Fukushima nuclear disaster is yet to be determined.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the defeat}} of the Greek army by the Turks in 1922 and the {{subsequent}} armed insurrection led by Colonels Nikolaos Plastiras and Stylianos Gonatas, King Constantine was dethroned (and succeeded by his eldest son, George), and six royalist leaders were executed. Venizelos assumed the leadership of the Greek delegation that negotiated peace terms with the Turks. He signed the Treaty of Lausanne with Turkey on 24 July 1923. The effect of this was <b>that</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> million Greeks (Christians) were expelled from Turkey, in exchange for the more than 500,000 Turks (Muslims) expelled from Greece, and Greece was forced to give up claims to eastern Thrace, Imbros and Tenedos to Turkey. This catastrophe marked the end of the Megali Idea. After a failed pro-royalist insurrection led by General Ioannis Metaxas forced King George II into exile, Venizelos returned to Greece and became prime minister once again. However, he left again in 1924 after quarreling with anti-monarchists.|$|E

Massive lines formed at midnight releases of the game; the event garnered significant media attention. This was followed by releases on November 10, 2004 in France and other European countries, and November 11 in the UK. The game sold 2.4 million copies and earned up to US$125 million in its first 24 hours on store shelves, thus out-grossing the film [...] as the highest grossing release in entertainment history. The game sold 260,000 units in the United Kingdom in its first week, making it the third fastest-selling title in that territory. It ultimately received a [...] "Double Platinum" [...] sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 600,000 copies in the United Kingdom.
