5|$|Despite Nedvěd's {{signing a}} new {{four-year}} contract with Lazio in April 2001, the club {{tried to sell}} him and teammate Juan Sebastián Verón that summer, triggering fan protests against club chairman Sergio Cragnotti. <b>The</b> <b>players</b> <b>were</b> ultimately sold to Juventus and Manchester United respectively.|$|E

5|$|Kemp, {{along with}} Williams {{and three other}} teammates, were accused of raping a 19-year-old woman {{at the time of}} a high school all-star {{basketball}} tournament on January 20, 2002, at the Columbus, Ohio Hyatt hotel. <b>The</b> <b>players</b> <b>were</b> suspended from the team during the investigation. However, the woman did not press charges, and the district attorney opted to not pursue the matter {{due to a lack of}} evidence.|$|E
5|$|The club's top scorer in the 1981–82 {{season is}} unknown due to {{insufficient}} data. During that {{season in the}} third division the two top scorers were Bojan Krempl (9) and Milan Žurman (7). However, due to the lost archives it is unclear if either of <b>the</b> <b>players</b> <b>were</b> among goal scorers during the match against Ptuj, played on 4 April 1982 and won by Maribor with the score 5–1.|$|E
5|$|There {{had been}} heavy rain in Liverpool {{in the week}} before the first leg. Nevertheless, Austrian referee Erich Linemayr decided that the first leg on 9 May would still go ahead. The rain had {{intensified}} following the kick-off and <b>the</b> <b>players</b> <b>were</b> unable to pass the ball to each other. The referee took the decision to abandon the game after 27 minutes with the match to be played the next day.|$|E
5000|$|The game first {{begins when}} <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>is</b> on a mountain. <b>The</b> <b>player</b> <b>is</b> struck by {{lightning}} causing <b>the</b> <b>player</b> to fall down the mountain. Then, <b>the</b> <b>player</b> slays many undead forces of [...] and defeats a dragon called the Dread Dragon.|$|R
5000|$|If <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>is</b> {{unable to}} lay any card then <b>the</b> <b>player</b> must {{pick up a}} card from the stock pile. If <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>is</b> then able to play then they can lay a card down on this go.|$|R

5|$|This {{includes}} {{baseball players}} from Puerto Rico that {{have played in}} MLB from 1942 to the present day. While the majority of <b>the</b> <b>players</b> <b>were</b> born on the archipelago, the list also includes players born on the mainland US to Puerto Rican parents, such as John Candelaria, Bobby Bonilla and John Valentin. Puerto Ricans typically consider the diaspora as their own.|$|E
5|$|Alston's Dodgers {{teams of}} the 1960s {{benefited from the}} strong {{pitching}} by Drysdale and Koufax. In 1966, both players held out of spring training and demanded three-year contracts each worth $500,000, which was more money than anyone was making in baseball at the time. <b>The</b> <b>players</b> <b>were</b> eventually signed for lesser amounts. Drysdale struggled that year, but Koufax won 27 games. The Dodgers went to the 1966 World Series but were defeated in four games. Koufax retired after the season {{on the advice of}} doctors who examined his sore arm. Drysdale retired three years later. Both men had pitched their entire major league careers for Alston.|$|E
5|$|As {{the teams}} {{prepared}} to leave their dressing rooms, Manchester City deliberately delayed their exit by a short period to play on any nerves the Leicester City players may have had. Manchester City coach Malcolm Allison was not permitted {{to take his place}} on the bench, as he was serving a touchline ban. Instead, he had to sit in the stand behind the dugout. Before kick-off, <b>the</b> <b>players</b> <b>were</b> introduced to the guest of honour, Princess Anne.|$|E
40|$|The {{project is}} meant to assist a {{basketball}} player in their practicing. The project hangs directly on the basketball rim and automatically rotates to find <b>the</b> <b>player</b> on <b>the</b> court. Once <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>is</b> detected, <b>the</b> automated basketball return system (ABRS) stays focused {{in the direction of}} <b>the</b> <b>player</b> so that any baskets successfully made will be funneled back to <b>the</b> <b>player.</b> When <b>the</b> <b>player</b> moves from center, IR motion detectors find which direction you moved to and rotates accordingly, until <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>is</b> focused in front of the funnel again. If at any time <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>is</b> absent from <b>the</b> court or cannot be located, the rotation continues in a 180 degree sweeping motion until <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>is</b> picked up again...|$|R

50|$|Before getting far, <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>is</b> {{informed}} that shredded portions {{of a secret}} document containing Magma Ltd.'s plans for world domination have <b>been</b> stolen. <b>The</b> <b>player</b> <b>is</b> instructed to retrieve the document by bargaining with the spies who stole it, who are located at various locations throughout <b>the</b> globe. <b>The</b> <b>player</b> <b>is</b> warned {{that it must be}} retrieved in order to prevent the US government from thwarting their plans. At this point, <b>the</b> <b>player's</b> objective <b>is</b> clear: retrieve the strips of the stolen document, then deliver them to Washington DC.|$|R
5|$|Boyd {{suffered}} from a fear of flying, which had on occasion caused difficulties in his football career. Chosen by the Birmingham County Football Association for a representative match in Hamburg in 1953, <b>the</b> <b>players</b> <b>were</b> already at the airport when he requested to be omitted from the team. While his teammates flew to Birmingham's Fairs Cup match in Milan, Boyd travelled across the English Channel by boat and then across France and into Italy by train.|$|E
5|$|Bruce Copeland, sportswriter for the Rock Island Argus, {{compiled}} the All-Pro {{list for}} 1920. He used the games played in Rock Island, other newspapers, {{and his own}} memory to determine the first-, second-, and third-team All-Pro list. Pro-Football-Reference.com uses this list as the official All-Pro list of 1920. Twenty of <b>the</b> <b>players</b> <b>were</b> from Illinois and thirteen were from Ohio. The Rock Island Independents had the most players on the list (9), and Racine Cardinals had the least (1).|$|E
5|$|Due to the club's {{financial}} situation, {{the reserve}} team had their wages halved {{early on in}} the season, and by January 1886 the payments made to reserve players were withdrawn altogether, although there was a possibility of them receiving a bonus {{at the end of the}} season if funds permitted. This resulted in Albion's second team refusing to play against Small Heath Alliance and the game was cancelled. Some of <b>the</b> <b>players</b> <b>were</b> suspended as a result of their actions, but were later re-instated.|$|E

They will find people on the island that will give <b>the</b> <b>player</b> quests, mostly to take {{pictures}} of schoolgirls' panties for a journalism club. If <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>is</b> caught doing so, they will either be reported to the police and taken into custody or be taken into the school counsellor's office (if <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>is</b> caught taking pictures inside the school).|$|R
5000|$|During a fight, each boxer has a healthmeter that {{decreases}} whenever <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>is</b> hit.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>player</b> <b>is</b> {{then sent}} to the {{research}} facility, and kills several snow based enemies. <b>The</b> <b>player</b> then battles <b>the</b> first boss, Tanya, who uses a burner to scorch <b>the</b> <b>player.</b> Afterwards, <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>is</b> sent outside <b>the</b> snow base, battles more enemies, then battles another boss, Fox.|$|R
5|$|Grace's bad wicket batting {{skills were}} fully {{tested in the}} first innings at The Oval and he scored 40 {{in a total of}} only 76, Alfred Shaw and Fred Morley taking five wickets each for the Players. The Players replied with 122 to take a first innings lead of 46. Grace took 2–37 in support of Allan Steel who claimed 6–60. The Gentlemen {{produced}} a much better batting performance on the Friday and scored 202, Grace again top-scoring with 63. He then took 3–30 as <b>the</b> <b>Players</b> <b>were</b> bowled out for 101, the match ending on Friday afternoon.|$|E
5|$|In the Italian capital, Terlecki {{continued}} {{to defy the}} establishment. <b>The</b> <b>players</b> <b>were</b> under strict instructions not to associate with the Vatican while in Rome, but Terlecki arranged for them to meet Pope John Paul II, who was himself Polish. Seeing this as a second act of defiance, the PZPN promptly sent Terlecki, Młynarczyk, Boniek and Żmuda home, escorted by General Marian Ryba of the Polish Army, who was also the football association president. Lech Poznań's Piotr Mowlik replaced Młynarczyk for the match against Malta, which Poland won 2–0.|$|E
5|$|Johnson's team {{arrived in}} Australia {{towards the end}} of 1945, but the armed {{services}} and Australian Board of Control ordered them to play another series against the various Australian states. Johnson had sought fixtures for his team in Australia, but this was before the Evatt had added the matches in the subcontinent. He implored the administrators to recognise that <b>the</b> <b>players</b> <b>were</b> already overworked, but was ignored. The Services performed poorly; after playing out consecutive draws against Western Australia and South Australia, they were crushed by an innings by both Victoria and New South Wales, before drawing against Queensland and Tasmania, the smallest state in the country.|$|E
50|$|The game plays {{similar to}} a board game, where <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>is</b> given a {{predetermined}} dice roll that moves <b>the</b> <b>player</b> up to six spaces on the board; however, if <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>is</b> so given <b>the</b> choice, he can move to a space of his choosing {{if there is a}} fork in the road. After landing on a space, <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>is</b> given a series of questions (The amount of questions needed to be answered increase as the game progresses) in order to proceed back to the board for another dice roll. <b>The</b> <b>player</b> <b>is</b> given a time limit to answer the question, with points given that vary based on how fast <b>the</b> <b>player</b> answered <b>the</b> question correctly. If <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>is</b> successful in answering a question, one of the gems above the enemy's picture will light up, indicating a correct answer. If <b>the</b> <b>player</b> answers a question incorrectly, he will lose a life point. If <b>the</b> <b>player</b> loses all life points, <b>the</b> <b>player</b> must continue within the time limit or else the game is over.|$|R
5000|$|The game {{begins with}} a surreal sequence, wherein an unknown party asks the player; “What do you {{remember}} about that day?” <b>The</b> <b>player</b> <b>is</b> given several dialogue choices that build a cohesive description of [...] "that day", though at this time, <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>is</b> {{not aware of the}} event's importance. Before the game actually begins, <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>is</b> asked to draw an image depicting this mysterious scene, introducing them to the game's core drawing mechanics.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the aids}} that the game {{provides}} <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>is</b> that past dialogue is accessible. Also, it contains a notebook which keeps track of what <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>is</b> searching for at any given point in the plot.|$|R
5|$|Of the 71 players picked in {{the first}} round by Montreal or Washington, 36 have been pitchers, the most of any position; 25 of them were right-handed, while 11 were left-handed. Thirteen outfielders, ten shortstops, five third basemen, four catchers, and three first basemen were also taken. The team has never drafted a player at second base. In all, 40 of <b>the</b> <b>players</b> <b>were</b> drafted from high school, 27 from {{four-year}} colleges, and four from junior colleges. Eleven of the players came from high schools, universities, or junior colleges in the state of California, and Florida follows with 10 players. They have also drafted two players from Puerto Rico: Josue Estrada (1993) and Hiram Bocachica (1994).|$|E
5|$|On this tour, Chappell {{clashed with}} cricket administrators over pay and {{conditions}} for the first time. The South African authorities requested that an extra Test {{be added to the}} fixture and the Australian Board of Control consented. Incensed that <b>the</b> <b>players</b> <b>were</b> not consulted about the change, Chappell led a group of his teammates in a demand for more money to play the proposed game. Eventually the match was cancelled after Chappell and his supporters refused to back down.|$|E
5|$|Team Canada {{arrived back}} in Canada on October 1. The team was mobbed by an {{estimated}} crowd of 10,000 at Montreal's Dorval Airport. Also greeting {{the team was}} Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau and City of Montreal Mayor Jean Drapeau. Montrealers Ken Dryden, Serge Savard, Yvan Cournoyer, Jean Ratelle and coach John Ferguson stayed in Montreal, {{while the rest of}} the team travelled on to Toronto. In Toronto, an estimated crowd of 80,000 attended a ceremony at Nathan Phillips Square to salute the players. <b>The</b> <b>players</b> <b>were</b> welcomed by Ontario Premier Bill Davis and Toronto Mayor William Dennison.|$|E

50|$|In any {{circumstance}} {{in which}} a played card may capture either a single or multiple cards, <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>is</b> forced to capture only the single card. For example, if the {{cards on the table}} are 1, 3, 4, and 8 (Knave, or Fante in Italian), and <b>the</b> <b>player</b> plays another Knave, <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>is</b> not allowed to capture the 1, 3, and 4, even though their total does add up to 8. Instead, <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>is</b> only allowed to capture the Knave.|$|R
