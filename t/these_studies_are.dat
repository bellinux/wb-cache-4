5|$|Microbiology {{was largely}} ignored by early {{evolutionary}} theory. This {{was due to}} the paucity of morphological traits and the lack of a species concept in microbiology, particularly amongst prokaryotes. Now, evolutionary researchers are taking advantage of their improved understanding of microbial physiology and ecology, produced by the comparative ease of microbial genomics, to explore the taxonomy and evolution of these organisms. <b>These</b> <b>studies</b> <b>are</b> revealing unanticipated levels of diversity amongst microbes.|$|E
5|$|Studies on {{embryogenesis}} {{and developmental}} biology. Mutants {{are created by}} adding transposons into their genomes, or specific genes are deleted by gene targeting. By studying the changes in development these changes produce, scientists aim to understand both how organisms normally develop, and what can go wrong in this process. <b>These</b> <b>studies</b> <b>are</b> particularly powerful since the basic controls of development, such as the homeobox genes, have similar functions in organisms as diverse as fruit flies and man.|$|E
5|$|The most {{sensitive}} enzyme assays use lasers focused through a microscope to observe changes in single enzyme molecules as they catalyse their reactions. These measurements either use {{changes in the}} fluorescence of cofactors during an enzyme's reaction mechanism, or of fluorescent dyes added onto specific sites of the protein to report movements that occur during catalysis. <b>These</b> <b>studies</b> <b>are</b> providing a new view of the kinetics and dynamics of single enzymes, as opposed to traditional enzyme kinetics, which observes the average behaviour of populations of millions of enzyme molecules.|$|E

5|$|Although {{many more}} {{invertebrates}} than vertebrates {{are used in}} animal testing, <b>these</b> <b>studies</b> <b>are</b> largely unregulated by law. The most frequently used invertebrate species are Drosophila melanogaster, a fruit fly, and Caenorhabditis elegans, a nematode worm. In the case of C. elegans, the worm's body is completely transparent and the precise lineage of all the organism's cells is known, while studies in the fly D. melanogaster can use an amazing array of genetic tools. These invertebrates offer some advantages over vertebrates in animal testing, including their short life cycle and {{the ease with which}} large numbers may be housed and studied. However, the lack of an adaptive immune system and their simple organs prevent worms from being used in several aspects of medical research such as vaccine development. Similarly, the fruit fly immune system differs greatly from that of humans, and diseases in insects can be different from diseases in vertebrates; however, fruit flies and waxworms can be useful in studies to identify novel virulence factors or pharmacologically active compounds.|$|E
5|$|Anxiety {{disorder}} and {{major depressive disorder}} {{are the most common}} conditions seen at the same time; comorbidity of these in persons with AS is estimated at 65%. Reports have associated AS with medical conditions such as aminoaciduria and ligamentous laxity, but these have been case reports or small studies and no factors have been associated with AS across studies. One study of males with AS found an increased rate of epilepsy and a high rate (51%) of nonverbal learning disorder. AS is associated with tics, Tourette syndrome, and bipolar disorder, and the repetitive behaviors of AS have many similarities with the symptoms of obsessive–compulsive {{disorder and}} obsessive–compulsive personality disorder. However many of <b>these</b> <b>studies</b> <b>are</b> based on clinical samples or lack standardized measures; nonetheless, comorbid conditions are relatively common.|$|E
5|$|Early studies {{reported}} high success rates: {{in one study}} in 1925, 60% of patients became seizure-free, and another 35% of patients had a 50% reduction in seizure frequency. These studies generally examined a cohort of patients recently treated by the physician (what {{is known as a}} retrospective study) and selected patients who had successfully maintained the dietary restrictions. However, <b>these</b> <b>studies</b> <b>are</b> difficult to compare to modern trials. One reason is that these older trials suffered from selection bias, as they excluded patients who were unable to start or maintain the diet and thereby selected from patients who would generate better results. In an attempt to control for this bias, modern study design prefers a prospective cohort (the patients in the study are chosen before therapy begins) in which the results are presented for all patients regardless of whether they started or completed the treatment (known as intent-to-treat analysis).|$|E

5|$|To {{allow for}} track or {{forecast}} uncertainties, usually several model runs with varying input parameters are generated {{to create a}} map of MOMs, or Maximum of Maximums. For hurricane evacuation studies, a family of storms with representative tracks for the region, and varying intensity, eye diameter, and speed, are modeled to produce worst-case water heights for any tropical cyclone occurrence. The results of <b>these</b> <b>studies</b> <b>are</b> typically generated from several thousand SLOSH runs. These studies have been completed by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, under contract to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for several states and are available on their Hurricane Evacuation Studies (HES) website. They include coastal county maps, shaded to identify the minimum category of hurricane {{that will result in}} flooding, in each area of the county.|$|E

25|$|Climate {{change can}} induce {{a number of}} changes on the environment, and subsequently, ectomycorrhizal communities. Many of <b>these</b> <b>studies</b> <b>are</b> in their infancy, {{but it is clear}} that they often exhibit some effect. In some studies, {{elevated}} CO2 levels increased fungal mycelium growth due to increased carbon allocation and increased EcM root colonization by 14%. However, CO2 levels can affect different EcM associations quite differently, and many studies with negligible effects have also been performed.|$|E
25|$|<b>These</b> <b>studies</b> <b>are</b> {{possible}} because nuclei {{are surrounded by}} orbiting electrons, which are charged particles that generate small, local magnetic fields that add to or subtract from the external magnetic field, and so will partially shield the nuclei. The amount of shielding depends on the exact local environment. For example, a hydrogen bonded to an oxygen will be shielded differently from a hydrogen bonded to a carbon atom. In addition, two hydrogen nuclei can interact via {{a process known as}} spin-spin coupling, if they are on the same molecule, which will split the lines of the spectra in a recognizable way.|$|E
25|$|The Archeological-Mining of the Sierra Gorda Project {{was begun}} in the 1970s, based on an earlier {{interdisciplinary}} study carried out at the Sierra de Querétaro. The project {{was supported by the}} federal and state governments as well as UNAM. The project further mapped the cities of Las Ranas and Toluqillo. Further studies in the 1980s consolidated earlier findings and worked out settlement patterns in the wider area. Continued work at that time classified the ancient cultures and register more than 500 sites, encompassing all of northern Querétaro and into San Luis Potosí. The effect of mercury poisoning is not only an ancient problem but a modern one as well. <b>These</b> <b>studies</b> <b>are</b> also investigating the high levels of certain chronic diseases in the current population. The theory is that there is widespread mercury contamination in the environment because of it build up from mining for over hundreds of years.|$|E

30|$|The work {{detailed}} {{in this article}} starts from four primary industrial studies on sound attributes dealing with sounds produced by car engines (Susini et al. [2 – 4], McAdams et al. [5]), air-conditioning units (Susini et al. [6]), car horns (Lemaitre et al. [7, 8]), and closing car doors (Parizet et al. [9]). The aim of <b>these</b> <b>studies</b> <b>was</b> to apply the methodology developed to study the timbre of musical sounds to a specific category of environmental sounds. The standard methodology used in <b>these</b> <b>studies</b> <b>was</b> based on a multidimensional scaling technique (MDS) applied to dissimilarity ratings.|$|R

25|$|Genome-wide {{association}} studies (GWAS) revealed {{regions of}} linkage {{that were found}} on most chromosomes. <b>These</b> <b>studies</b> <b>are</b> useful in identifying the genes that {{may be responsible for}} complex diseases such as SLE. Candidate gene loci implicated with SLE include multiple alleles from the HLA region, Fc-gamma receptor, and complement component system. However, association does not prove that a specific form of a gene is responsible for the disease, as there may be other polymorphisms in the region that have a greater association effect. However, because the biological role of most genes are not completely understood, {{it can be difficult to}} attribute phenotypic traits to certain genetic polymorphisms. Since SLE is associated with so many genetic regions, it is likely an oligogenic trait, meaning that there are several genes that control susceptibility to the disease. Further complicating our understanding is the association of certain linkages with various ethnic groups.|$|E
25|$|Other {{scholars}} {{suggest that}} these arguments are flawed, ignores history and more laws will {{do more harm than}} good. According to them, child labour is merely the symptom of a greater disease named poverty. If laws ban all lawful work that enables the poor to survive, informal economy, illicit operations and underground businesses will thrive. These will increase abuse of the children. In poor countries with very high incidence rates of child labour - such as Ethiopia, Chad, Niger and Nepal - schools are not available, and the few schools that exist offer poor quality education or are unaffordable. The alternatives for children who currently work, claim <b>these</b> <b>studies,</b> <b>are</b> worse: grinding subsistence farming, militia or prostitution. Child labour is not a choice, it is a necessity, the only option for survival. It is currently the least undesirable of a set of very bad choices.|$|E
500|$|... "Complexity {{in ecology}} is {{of at least}} six {{distinct}} types: spatial, temporal, structural, process, behavioral, and geometric." [...] From these principles, ecologists have identified emergent and self-organizing phenomena that operate at different environmental scales of influence, ranging from molecular to planetary, and these require different explanations at each integrative level. Ecological complexity relates to the dynamic resilience of ecosystems that transition to multiple shifting steady-states directed by random fluctuations of history. Long-term ecological studies provide important track records {{to better understand the}} complexity and resilience of ecosystems over longer temporal and broader spatial scales. <b>These</b> <b>studies</b> <b>are</b> managed by the International Long Term Ecological Network (LTER). The longest experiment in existence is the Park Grass Experiment, which was initiated in 1856. Another example is the Hubbard Brook study, which has been in operation since 1960.|$|E
