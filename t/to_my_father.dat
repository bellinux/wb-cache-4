Although he {{had no interest in}} college, soon after coming back he was practically forced to attend Cornell University's law school, as he lost all of his money at the races. Later Warner wrote [...] "I dare not write <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> and tell him I was broke" [...] he felt {{that the only way to}} get funds was to inform his father that he decided to study law. His father, who had always wanted him to be a lawyer, sent him $100 (approximately $2,500 in 2016).|$|E
500|$|Both Margaret Salinger and Maynard {{characterized}} the author as a devoted film buff. According to Margaret, his favorite movies include Gigi (1958), The Lady Vanishes (1938), The 39 Steps (1935; Phoebe's favorite movie in The Catcher in the Rye), and the comedies of W.C. Fields, Laurel and Hardy, and the Marx Bros.. Predating VCRs, Salinger had an extensive collection of classic movies from the 1940s in 16mm prints. Maynard wrote that [...] "he loves movies, not films", and Salinger argued that her father's [...] "worldview is, essentially, {{a product of}} the movies of his day. <b>To</b> <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> all Spanish speakers are Puerto Rican washerwomen, or the toothless, grinning-gypsy types in a Marx Brothers movie". Lillian Ross, a staff writer for The New Yorker and longtime friend of Salinger's, wrote following his death, [...] "Salinger loved movies, and he was more fun than anyone to discuss them with. He enjoyed watching actors work, and he enjoyed knowing them. (He loved Anne Bancroft, hated Audrey Hepburn, and said that he had seen Grand Illusion ten times.)" ...|$|E

2500|$|When {{the king}} of the Franks [...] was on the hill with that band, they made a {{formidable}} charge against the Muslims facing them, so that they drove them back <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> [...] I looked towards him and he was overcome by grief and his complexion pale.

2500|$|On Golden Pond in 1981, {{the film}} {{adaptation}} of Ernest Thompson's play, marked one final {{professional and personal}} triumph for Fonda. [...] Directed by Mark Rydell, the project provided unprecedented collaborations between Fonda and Katharine Hepburn, along with Fonda and his daughter, Jane. [...] The elder Fonda played an emotionally brittle and distant father who becomes more accessible {{at the end of}} his life. [...] Jane Fonda has said that elements of the story mimicked their real-life relationship, and helped them resolve certain issues. She bought the film rights in the hope that her father would play the role, and later described it as [...] "a gift <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> that was so unbelievably successful." ...|$|E

He started driving, and ran out of gas and money in Jersey City, New Jersey at Audubon Park. A man came over and started talking to us, a Mr. Cohn. He said <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> 'You look like you need a job,' and my father said 'I do'."

Eventually, they moved to Van Nostrand Avenue between Ocean Avenue and Rutgers Avenue. His mother worked for Western Electric in Kearny, New Jersey.|$|E

Alexander Graham Bell, a young teacher of the deaf, spent a few weeks of leisurely contemplation and invented the telephone." [...] The stamp depicts three telephones of various time periods, including his famous Gallows model, considered the world's first telephone. In 1915 Alexander Graham referred to it saying [...] "The instrument, just as you see it here, was invented in the summer of 1874, during a visit I paid <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> and mother in Brantford..."

The McDonald family was very grateful to Strother for his actions and the two families remained close. Fifty years later, during the American Civil War, McDonald's son Colonel Angus William McDonald interceded on Strother's behalf when he was arrested by McDonald's Confederate squad for treason in August 1861.

He notes that [...] "I can only think off-hand of a few occasions when I've drawn bondage. A few Wonder Woman covers perhaps, a Flash cover, a 2000 AD cover, a Mr. Mamoulian page... but that's all that I can remember out of many hundreds of images." [...] In 2006's The Art of Brian Bolland, he does suggest that [...] "I trace my mild bondage fetish back to a book of Bible stories {{that must have been}} given <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> as a Sunday school gift when he was a child," [...] wherein [...] "was a picture of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednigo [...]" [...] Such Biblical imagery was bolstered in 1971 by a book bought in Paris [...] "called Les Filles de Papier... large part of [...] was taken up with comic strips about women tied up in fiendish and excruciating positions by mad robots... it was just jaw-droppingly bonkers... and yet... there was something rather appealing about it." [...] The Art of Brian Bolland also features a separate [...] "Nudes" [...] section, mostly created for the purpose of [...] "trying out a different inking technique or trying to work out the figure from a difficult angle."

2500|$|Most {{mainline}} Christians {{claim that}} {{the doctrine of the}} Trinity implies that God should be called Father and not called Mother, {{in the same way that}} Jesus was a man and was not a woman. Jesus tells His followers to address God as Father. He tells his disciples to be merciful as their heavenly Father is merciful. He says the Father will give the Holy Spirit to those who ask and that the Spirit of their Father will speak through them in times of persecution. On Easter Sunday, he directs Mary Magdalene to tell the other disciples, [...] "I am going <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>Father</b> and your Father...." [...] Mark Brumley points out that behind New Testament language of Divine Adoption and regeneration is the idea that God is our Father because He is the [...] "source" [...] or [...] "origin" [...] of our new life in Christ. He has saved us through Christ and sanctified us in the Spirit. Brumley claims this is clearly more than a metaphor; the analogy with earthly fatherhood is obvious. God is not merely like a father for Christ’s followers; he is really their Father. Among Christians who hold to this idea, there is a distinct sense that Jesus' treatment of women should imply equality in leadership and marital roles every bit as strongly as the definite male gender of Jesus should imply a name of Father for God. Rather than as antifeminist, they characterize alternative naming as unnecessary and unsupported by the words found in the Bible.|$|E
