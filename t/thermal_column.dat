50|$|A <b>thermal</b> <b>column</b> (or thermal) is a {{vertical}} section of rising {{air in the}} lower altitudes of the Earth's atmosphere. Thermals are created by the uneven heating of the Earth's surface from solar radiation. The Sun warms the ground, which in turn warms the air directly above it. The warmer air expands, becoming less dense than the surrounding air mass, and creating a thermal low. The mass of lighter air rises, and as it does, it cools by expansion at lower air pressures. It stops rising when it has cooled to the same temperature as the surrounding air. Associated with a thermal is a downward flow surrounding the <b>thermal</b> <b>column.</b> The downward moving exterior is caused by colder air being displaced {{at the top of}} the thermal. Another convection-driven weather effect is the sea breeze.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>thermal</b> <b>column</b> (or thermal) is {{a column}} of rising air in the lower altitudes of Earth's atmosphere, a form of {{atmospheric}} updraft. Thermals are created by the uneven heating of Earth's surface from solar radiation, and are an example of convection, specifically atmospheric convection. The Sun warms the ground, which in turn warms the air directly above it.|$|E
5000|$|Riding Thermals to Winter Grounds [...] (2017, Leaky Boot Press, 114 pages, $14.99)—One day {{the poet}} climbed Overlook Mountain in the Catskills. An eagle began riding a <b>thermal</b> <b>column</b> in great circles, wings outstretched and motionless. In one circle the eagle came close—poet and eagle stared into each others eyes. The poet {{came to see}} the {{incident}} as a metaphor for old age—riding the thermals of experience. Most of these poems were written with that incident on the mountain in mind.|$|E
5|$|Often, the {{migration}} route of a long-distance migrator bird doesn't follow {{a straight line}} between breeding and wintering grounds. Rather, it could follow a hooked or arched line, with detours around geographical barriers. For most land-birds, such barriers could consist in seas, large water bodies or high mountain ranges, {{because of the lack}} of stopover or feeding sites, or the lack of <b>thermal</b> <b>columns</b> for broad-winged birds.|$|R
50|$|One {{example is}} <b>thermal</b> <b>columns</b> {{extending}} above {{the top of}} the equilibrium level (EL) in thunderstorms: unstable air rising from (or near) the surface normally stops rising at the EL (near the tropopause) and spreads out as an anvil cloud; but {{in the event of a}} strong updraft, unstable air is carried past the EL as an overshooting top or dome. A parcel of air will stop ascending at the maximum parcel level (MPL). This overshoot is responsible for most of the turbulence experienced in the cruise phase of commercial air flights.|$|R
5000|$|Especially large {{wildfires}} {{may affect}} air currents in their immediate vicinities by the stack effect: air rises {{as it is}} heated, and large wildfires create powerful updrafts that will draw in new, cooler air from surrounding areas in <b>thermal</b> <b>columns.</b> Great vertical differences in temperature and humidity encourage pyrocumulus clouds, strong winds, and fire whirls {{with the force of}} tornadoes at speeds of more than 80 km/h. [...] Rapid rates of spread, prolific crowning or spotting, the presence of fire whirls, and strong convection columns signify extreme conditions.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} houses several experimental facilities. These facilities {{are used for}} research and for classroom lab activities. A <b>thermal</b> <b>column,</b> consisting of a 3.5 * 3.5 * 5 ft block of graphite, provides a source of slow neutrons. A 6 in diameter aluminum tube, called a beam port, can be positioned between the reactor core and an experimental area in {{the ground floor of}} the reactor building, allowing irradiation of a sample with higher energy neutrons. Other facilities, called rabbits, are used to pneumatically inject a sample directly into the core of the reactor for a specified amount of time. One of the rabbit facilities is lined with cadmium in order to stop low-energy neutrons while allowing bombardment of the sample with high-energy neutrons.|$|E
5000|$|All {{castellanus}} clouds {{show that}} there exists an unstable (or conditionally unstable) layer at their altitude but not necessarily under the cloud. Some scientists (Scorer, Corfidi) define acastellanus as a cloud generated by the release of latent heat during the ascension of a saturated <b>thermal</b> <b>column</b> in an unstable (or conditionally unstable) layer at altitude. The cloud will have {{the appearance of a}} [...] This unstable (or conditionally unstable) layer can be generated in different ways: (1) a large scale lifting (synoptic scale) that under some circumstances makes the air unstable since the temperature {{at the base of the}} layer decreases more slowly than the temperature at the top of cloud due to adiabatic decompression, (2) a cooling of the cloud top that generates the same differential, and (3) an unstable (or conditionally unstable) airmass advection over a stable airmass, etc.|$|E
50|$|Zippe {{was born}} in Varnsdorf, Austria-Hungary (nowadays Czech Republic) in 1917. Zippe studied and {{graduated}} with B.Sc. Physics at the University of Vienna in the '1938, and served in the Luftwaffe as a flight instructor and a researcher on radar and airplane propellers. In 1941, Zippe received his B.S. in mechanical engineering, and M.Sc. in 1943 in the same discipline. While doing his post doctoral research at the University of Vienna, Zippe participated in Germany's nuclear weapons project in 1940s. He was the junior research team member of the isotope separation project led by Klaus Clusius at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. In 1945, he was awarded a PhD in mechanical engineering with emphasizing on <b>thermal</b> <b>column</b> and its applicant physics. By the time Zippe fully joined the project as the team leader, communist spies kidnapped him, along with other technically skilled scientists and engineers, and imprisoned him in a special camp where he led a team that worked on centrifuge research for the Soviet Union. In the Soviet Union Zippe worked at the Physics Institute of Sukhumi on a centrifuge project, led by German director Manfred von Ardenne, and directed by another German scientist Max Steenbeck, whose theoretical achievements Zippe used. He was allowed to leave in 1956, and returned to Vienna.|$|E
50|$|As {{described}} in the Sun article, the Sun has a radiative core and a convective outer envelope. In the core, the luminosity due to nuclear reactions is transmitted to outer layers principally by radiation. However, in the outer layers the temperature gradient {{is so great that}} radiation cannot transport enough energy. As a result, thermal convection occurs as <b>thermal</b> <b>columns</b> carry hot material to the surface (photosphere) of the Sun. Once the material cools off at the surface, it plunges back downward {{to the base of the}} convection zone, to receive more heat from the top of the radiative zone.|$|R

40|$|The <b>thermal</b> <b>column</b> in the ET-RR- 2 reactor is {{intended}} to promote a thermal neutron field of high intensity and purity {{to be used for}} following tasks: (a) to provide a thermal neutron flux in the neutron transmutation silicon doping, (b) to provide a thermal flux in the neutron activation analysis position, and (c) to provide a thermal neutron flux of high intensity to the head of one of the beam tubes leading to the room specified for boron thermal neutron capture therapy. It was, therefore, necessary to determine the thermal neutron flux at above mentioned positions. In the present work, the neutron flux in the ET-RR- 2 reactor system was calculated by applying the three dimensional diffusion depletion code TRITON. According to these calculations, the reactor system is composed of the core, surrounding external irradiation grid, beryllium block, <b>thermal</b> <b>column</b> and the water reflector in the reactor tank next to the tank wall. As a result of these calculations, the thermal neutron fluxes within the <b>thermal</b> <b>column</b> and at irradiation positions within the <b>thermal</b> <b>column</b> were obtained.

40|$|Some 900 t of graphitic reactor {{components}} (moderators, reflectors and <b>thermal</b> <b>columns</b> fabricated from graphite or carbonstone) in Germany will {{sooner or later}} be subject to decommissioning and/or dismantling. To dismantle these graphitic components, comprehensive information about amount (volumes, masses, dimensions, [...] .) and radiological as well as thermal history is needed. Results of stock-taking of graphitic {{reactor components}} in Germany are presented. To fractionalize graphitic components, cutting techniques had to be developed and/or adapted to the special recommendations in nuclear industry: A minimization of secondary waste emission is as well desired {{as the ability to}} be applied by remote handling and as necessary as a certain performance in cutting thicker structures. Available experiences stemming from former cutting operations (1) are taken into account.

40|$|The {{inventory}} analysis of radiological for graphite <b>thermal</b> <b>column</b> from Triga Mark II reactor, Bandung has been presented. The age of Triga Mark II reactor {{is more than}} 45 years, therefore the reactor certainly will be decommissioned sooner or later. Before being decommissioned, one important thing that should be done is the {{inventory analysis}} of radiological of its all component. The data of the inventory analysis is needed to calculate the radioactive waste, which needed budget for decommissioning.

40|$|Coordinated soaring by a {{flock of}} small {{unmanned}} aerial vehicles (sUAVs) provides a means of conserving fuel while performing aerial tasks. The ability to exploit <b>thermal</b> <b>columns</b> in the atmospheric boundary layer allows sUAVs to remain airborne without expending any onboard sources of energy, i. e., soaring flight. This paper presents {{an analysis of the}} cruising phase during coordinated soaring where {{a flock of}} sUAVs relies on thermal exploitation to maximize endurance for monitoring-type missions. To this end, a maneuver is investigated that involves each sUAV repeating a round-trip between a thermal and a monitoring/surveillance target so as to maintain continuous monitoring of the target. The focus is on minimizing the number of agents required to maintain continuous, persistent surveillance of the target for given atmospheric conditions (thermal strength and distance between the thermal and monitoring target) and on maximizing a free parameter (time or distance) when the number of agents is specified. It will be shown that the optimal cruising speed for maximizing the endurance of monitoring-type missions varies between the best L/D speed and the MacCready speed and depends on the “aggregate thermal strength” of a given cycle, or equivalently, the ratio of the time that one sUAV spends away fro...|$|R
40|$|After the {{discovery}} of cooling system leak of about 284 liters per twenty-four (24) hour period, an investigation determined that the 76. 2 -cm diameter, 33. 5 -m long stainless-steel (304) OWR delay line was losing water at the same nominal rate. An excavation effort revealed that a circumferential crack, approximately 0. 0025 cm in width, extended around {{the bottom half of}} the delay line. In addition, other evidence of what appeared to be microcracking and pitting that originated at random nucleated sites around the pipe were also found. Results of destructive analysis and nondestructive testing allowed Los Alamos staff to conclude that the direct cause for the main crack and other pitting resulted from stress-assisted, microbial-induced corrosion of the stainless steel primary piping. The results also indicated that microbial action from bacteria that are normally present in earth can be extremely harmful to stainless- steel piping under certain conditions. Other potential problems that could have also eventually led to a permanent shutdown of the OWR were discussed. These problems, although never encountered nor associated with the current shutdown, were identified in aging studies and are associated with: (1) the water-cooled, bismuth gamma-ray shield and, (2) the aluminum <b>thermal</b> <b>column</b> head seal that prevents reactor vessel water from entering into the graphite-filled <b>thermal</b> <b>column...</b>|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the design, build and initial {{operation of a}} standard neutron spectrum source facility of application to fast reactor physics. The facility, called NISUS, consists {{of a set of}} spherical natural uranium and boron carbide shells mounted in a graphite <b>thermal</b> <b>column</b> of the University of London CONSORT research reactor. A variety of calculational methods are needed for the design of the facility, some of which had to be newly developed. They must predict neutron and gamma-ray distributions in both the <b>thermal</b> <b>column</b> and the NISUS shells. Special methods had to be developed to match together these very different types of calculation. All the calculational methods are described in detail together with their application to the design of NISUS. The facility must generate a neutron spectrum that is typical of that of a fast reactor and, most importantly, ensure that both the neutron and gamma-ray spectra within the facility are independent of the surrounding structure of the host reactor. The first measurements in the NISUS facility are described. They demonstrate that the design objectives for a standard spectrum facility have been achieved.

40|$|Root Cause Analysis of Swelling Problem in Kartini Reactor. A {{root cause}} {{analysis}} (RCA) related to the swelling problem in Kartini reactor have been done. Three areas of interest were observed from the inspection of Kartini reactor tank liner conducted in 2001 i. e. : a small area with apparent thinning, a small crack that was analysed as an original manufacturing defect, {{and there were two}} areas of swelling (bulges) observed under the <b>thermal</b> <b>column.</b> The visual inspections each year by the video equipment and replication indicate that the swelling parts observed in 2001 had grown in size. Recent examination 2006 - 2007 showed that the size of bulges relatively constant, and the peak of the bulges appears to contain tears (cracks). Therefore, RCA has been conducted to evaluate the problem and the result shows that probable root cause of swelling are as follows: it is probable that the seal on the cover plate in the service pool has deteriorated and allowed water to enter both the <b>thermal</b> <b>column</b> and the space between the aluminium reactor pool liner and the concrete. The water will also saturate the concrete and has the potential to corrode the steel reinforcement close {{to the surface of the}} concrete.

5|$|Some large broad-winged birds rely on <b>thermal</b> <b>columns</b> {{of rising}} hot air {{to enable them}} to soar. These include many birds of prey such as vultures, eagles, and buzzards, but also storks. These birds migrate in the daytime. Migratory species in these groups have great {{difficulty}} crossing large bodies of water, since thermals only form over land, and these birds cannot maintain active flight for long distances. Mediterranean and other seas present a major obstacle to soaring birds, which must cross at the narrowest points. Massive numbers of large raptors and storks pass through areas such as the Strait of Messina, Gibraltar, Falsterbo, and the Bosphorus at migration times. More common species, such as the European honey buzzard Pernis apivorus, can be counted in hundreds of thousands in autumn. Other barriers, such as mountain ranges, can also cause funnelling, particularly of large diurnal migrants. This is a notable factor in the Central American migratory bottleneck. Batumi bottleneck in the Caucasus is one of the heaviest migratory funnels on earth. Avoiding flying over the Black Sea surface and across high mountains, hundreds of thousands of soaring birds funnel through an area around the city of Batumi, Georgia. Birds of prey such as honey buzzards which migrate using thermals lose only 10 to 20% of their weight during migration, which may explain why they forage less during migration than do smaller birds of prey with more active flight such as falcons, hawks and harriers.|$|R
