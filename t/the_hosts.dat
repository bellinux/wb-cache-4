5|$|For {{the first}} six episodes, the show had five corners, or parts, which started with opening {{greetings}} from <b>the</b> <b>hosts</b> {{and went on to}} thoughts and impressions that listeners had about the show. This moved on to an informal talk between <b>the</b> <b>hosts,</b> followed by a section where entries previously submitted by listeners concerning their enthusiasm for Key were read by <b>the</b> <b>hosts.</b> The fourth corner concerned answering questions that had been submitted by listeners, and the final corner had Orito playing the flute; listeners could submit suggestions for songs he was to play. Two more corners were added starting with the seventh broadcast. The first corner added concerns scary stories that <b>the</b> <b>hosts</b> can tell themselves, or read from submissions by listeners, and was added partly because Hinoue enjoys such stories. The second corner added deals with submissions by listeners describing a new fictional character, and Hinoue takes these submissions and forms a new fictional character out of combining elements from multiple submissions together. During the broadcasts, tracks from the soundtracks released under Key Sounds Label play in the background.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} match against Leicestershire, Loxton was given his first chance on English soil. Batting at No. 7, he managed only four before being trapped leg before wicket by Australian {{expatriate}} left arm orthodox spinner Vic Jackson, as Australia amassed 448. He {{then opened the}} bowling and castled home captain Les Berry for one to leave <b>the</b> <b>hosts</b> at 1/1 and take his first wicket on English soil. He also took two catches, both from the bowling of fellow Victorian Doug Ring as <b>the</b> <b>hosts</b> fell for 130. Loxton again opened the bowling in the second innings as Australia enforced the follow on and dismissed <b>the</b> <b>hosts</b> for 147 to seal another innings win. Loxton took 1/11 and 0/12 from six and seven overs respectively.|$|E

50|$|A mochokid catfish of Lake Tanganyika, Synodontis multipunctatus, is a brood {{parasite}} {{of several}} mouthbrooding cichlid fish.

50|$|The {{parasitic}} plant has many obstacles to overcome {{in order to}} attach to <b>the</b> <b>host.</b> Distance from <b>the</b> <b>host</b> and stored nutrients are only some of <b>the</b> problems, <b>the</b> <b>host's</b> defenses are an obstacle to overcome itself. The first hurdle is penetrating <b>the</b> <b>host,</b> <b>the</b> <b>host</b> has systems to reinforce the cell wall by protein cross-linking so that it stops the parasitic progress at the cortex of <b>the</b> <b>host's</b> roots. <b>The</b> second hurdle is <b>the</b> <b>host's</b> ability to secrete germination inhibitors. This prevents germination of the parasitic seed. The third hurdle is <b>the</b> <b>host's</b> ability to create a toxic environment for where the {{parasitic plant}} attaches to. <b>The</b> <b>host</b> secretes phenolic compounds into the apoplast the creates a toxic environment for the parasitic plant eventually killing it. The fourth hurdle is <b>the</b> <b>host's</b> ability to ruin the tubercle using gums and gels or injecting toxins into the tubercle.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>host</b> {{is often}} <b>the</b> {{personality}} that seeks treatment. Therefore, the psychotherapists often deal primarily with <b>the</b> <b>host</b> personality.

There are situations where <b>the</b> <b>host</b> wants therapy; however, {{one or more of the}} alters does not and can try to end the therapeutic process. While <b>the</b> <b>host</b> is aware of the person's body, the alters are not always aware that they share the same body as <b>the</b> <b>host,</b> which can lead to belief that suicide would have no effect on <b>the</b> <b>host.</b>|$|R

40|$|Cloud {{computing}} is {{an upcoming}} efficient networking computing environment. Our work proposes sharing an application across various clients {{of a host}} system via cloud computing.

25|$|The facehugger is a parasitoid; {{its only}} {{purpose is to}} make contact with <b>the</b> <b>host's</b> mouth for <b>the</b> {{implantation}} process, by gripping its legs around the victim's head and wrapping its tail around <b>the</b> <b>host's</b> neck. Upon making contact, the facehugger administers a cynose-based paralytic in order to render it unconscious and immobile. During a successful attachment, the facehugger will insert a proboscis down <b>the</b> <b>host's</b> throat, while simultaneously implanting an embryo. <b>The</b> <b>host</b> is kept alive, and the creature breathes for <b>the</b> <b>host.</b> Attempts to remove facehuggers generally prove fatal, as the parasitoid will respond by tightening its tail around <b>the</b> <b>host's</b> neck, and its acidic blood prevents it from being cut away. In addition, its grip on <b>the</b> <b>host's</b> head is strong enough to tear <b>the</b> <b>host's</b> face off if it is forcibly removed.|$|R

However, when Australia batted, Bradman rearranged the order and Hassett came in at No. 7 with Australia’s score at 5/320 after losing 4/55 in a middle-order collapse.

5|$|Australia's biggest {{challenge}} in the post-Test tour matches was against the Leveson Gower's XI. During the last Australian tour in 1938, this team was effectively a full-strength England outfit, but this time Bradman insisted that only six current Test players be allowed to represent <b>the</b> <b>hosts.</b> After <b>the</b> <b>hosts</b> had complied, the Australian skipper fielded a full-strength team. In a rain-interrupted match, Lindwall bowled Hutton for a duck with the new ball. He returned and took five {{of the last six}} wickets to fall as <b>the</b> <b>hosts</b> lost their last six wickets for 57 runs. His last five victims were former England captain Walter Robins and Test players Freddie Brown, Evans, Bedser and Laker. Lindwall ended with 6/59; four of his wickets were bowled, while the other two were caught by Ian Johnson in the slips. He made five as Australia with 8/489 declared; time ran out in the rain-affected match with Leveson-Gower's XI at 0/75.|$|E
5|$|Australia's biggest {{challenge}} in the post-Test tour matches was against the Leveson-Gower's XI starting on 8 September, its last first-class match for the tour.

His bowlers skittled <b>the</b> <b>hosts</b> for 177, and Morris and Barnes put on an opening stand of 102 before Morris was out for 62. Bradman joined Barnes and they put on 225 runs for the second wicket. Bradman top-scored with 153 as Australia declared at 8/469 late on the final day. Upon reaching 153, he threw away his wicket with a lofted cover drive, having decided to attempt sixes to give Alec Bedser his wicket. He was already running towards the pavilion before the catch was taken, ending his last first-class innings in England. <b>The</b> <b>hosts</b> were 2/75 when the match ended in a draw after multiple rain delays. When it became obvious that Australia would not lose, Bradman bowled his only over of the tour, conceding two runs.|$|E

As such, {{we are interested in}} <b>the</b> <b>host</b> cell's mechanisms to silence such gene expressions to find out firstly, how <b>the</b> <b>host</b> cell manages provirus transcription to eliminate the deleterious effects of retroviruses; and secondly, how can we ensure stable and long term expression of retrovirus-mediated gene transfer.|$|R

5000|$|Once {{germination}} is stimulated, the Striga seed {{sends out}} an initial root {{to probe the}} soil for <b>the</b> <b>host</b> root. <b>The</b> initial root secretes an oxidizing enzyme that digests <b>the</b> <b>host</b> root surface, releasing quinones.
