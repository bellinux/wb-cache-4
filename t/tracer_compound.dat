50|$|Radioactive <b>tracer</b> <b>compounds</b> {{are used}} to observe the {{function}} of various organs and body systems. These compounds use a chemical tracer which is attracted to or concentrated by the activity which is being studied.

Gamma cameras and other similar detectors are highly efficient, and the <b>tracer</b> <b>compounds</b> are generally very effective at concentrating at the areas of interest, so the total amounts of radioactive material needed are very small.|$|R
5000|$|In {{order to}} be used as a <b>tracer,</b> a <b>compound</b> must be emitted {{preferentially}} by some sources and not by others, giving the emission source a relatively unique chemical makeup. The compound must react slowly enough in the atmosphere that it is chemically conserved from the emission source to the receptor site where an ambient sample may be taken. Additionally, a tracer species should not be formed in the atmosphere and it should not volatilize during transport so that mass balance is maintained. [...] <b>Tracer</b> <b>compounds</b> must then be of primary origins (not formed in the atmosphere), which are created through condensation and coagulation of mainly combustion and biological sources.|$|R
40|$|<b>Tracer</b> <b>compounds</b> {{used for}} {{studying}} solute transport should ideally have identical functions and transport properties to the molecules {{they are designed}} to mimic. Unfortunately, the xylem-mobile <b>tracer</b> <b>compounds</b> currently used to infer solute transport mechanisms in botanical specimens such as the fruit of the grapevine, Vitis vinifera L., are typically xenobiotic and have difficulty exiting the xylem during berry ripening. Here it is demonstrated that the transport of paramagnetic Mn ions can be indirectly observed within the grape berry, using relaxation magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Mnions from a 10 mM Mn chloride solution were taken up into the grape berry via the pedicel and moved through the peripheral vasculature before exiting into surrounding pericarp tissue. Mn did not exit evenly across the berry, implying that the berry xylem influences which sites Mn exits the vasculature 2 ̆ 7 downstream 2 ̆ 7 of the berry pedicel. It was also found that when the cellular membranes of pericarp tissues were disrupted, the distribution of Mn through the pericarp tissue became noticeably more homogenous. This indicates that the cellular membranes of extra-vascular cells affect the spatial distribution of Mn across the berry extra-vascular pericarp tissue upon exiting the grape berry vasculature...|$|R

30|$|Due to the {{structural}} similarity and shared transcriptional {{origin of the}} native peptides GCG and GLP- 1, cross-binding to GLP- 1 R is a distinct possibility for any GCGR targeting agent [13].

However, careful design of the <b>tracer</b> <b>compounds</b> based on structural insights into both the GCG and GLP- 1 receptor [10] led to negligible cross-binding of either radiotracer in this study as indicated by both the lack of inhibitory effect of GLP- 1 on [68 Ga]Ga-DO 3 A-S 01 -GCG or [68 Ga]Ga-DO 3 A-S 02 -GCG binding, {{as well as the}} low baseline binding in the GLP- 1 R-rich pancreas.|$|R

5000|$|Organic {{molecular}} tracers, {{also referred}} to as organic molecular markers, are compounds or compound classes of interest in the field of air quality because they can help identify particulate emission sources, as they are relatively unique to those sources.

30|$|Besides various {{degradation}} and transport processes, all chemicals that enter the environment form NER in solid matrices in varying amounts [11, 12]. NER formation {{can be quantified}} in environmental fate studies using, e.g., 14 C or 13 C-labeled <b>tracer</b> <b>compounds.</b> Previous NER definitions led to a mismatch of legislation and current state of knowledge in research and modeling; only parent compounds and primary metabolites are considered as NER, whereas remaining label conversion into natural bio-components was explicitly excluded [13]. The regulatory views on NER formation differ considerably with the two extremes of (i) assuming them as either degraded residues of no environmental concern in the regulation of pesticides [14, 15], at least if the NER are below or the mineralisation rates above certain threshold values, or (ii) as potentially bioavailable and non-degraded residues (“parent substance”) in the regulation of general industrial chemicals [7, 9, 16] if no clear indication for ultimate degradation or irreversible immobilization is available. In other words, NER in the respective matrix are valued either as ‘safe sink’ or as potential ‘hidden hazard’.|$|R

The published article is copyrighted by Elsevier {{and can be found}} at: [URL] aerosols are important atmospheric components, and their formation and sources represent important aspects of urban air quality and health effects. Asia, including India, is the largest global source of aerosol particles due to regional natural advection (e. g. desert and soil dust) and anthropogenic activities (e. g. emissions from traffic, industry and burning of coal, biomass and agricultural waste) that generate vast amounts of particulate matter (PM) significantly contributing to climate change.

40|$|In {{most of this}} thesis, the {{chemical}} composition of SOA from the photooxidation of isoprene under both high- and low-NOx conditions has been thoroughly investigated {{through a series of}} controlled laboratory chamber experiments. It is found that {{the chemical}} nature of the resultant SOA is significantly different in the two NOx regimes, which indicates that different chemical formation mechanisms are operating due to the kinds of gas-phase oxidation products favored to form under each NOx condition. Under high-NOx conditions, the SOA constituents are acidic and isoprene SOA formation occurs through oxidation of its second-generation product, methacryloylperoxynitrate (MPAN). The similarity of the composition of SOA formed from the photooxidation of MPAN to that formed from isoprene and methacrolein demonstrates the role of MPAN in the formation of isoprene high-NOx SOA. More specifically, we confirm that MPAN is the key intermediate in the isoprene and methacrolein systems in the formation of 2 -methylglyceric acid, a known high-NOx <b>tracer</b> <b>compound</b> for the formation of isoprene SOA in the atmosphere, and its corresponding low-volatility oligoesters in the aerosol phase.

The systemwas designed around the unique properties of riboflavin. Excitation energy was centered near 440 nm (in the blue region of the visible spectrum); emitted energy wasmeasured at 600 nm (in the red/orange region), well beyond the significant fluorescence peakmaximum of natural skin.

In this study, the organic constituents present in fine particulate (d_p ≤ 2. 0 µm) road dust, brake lining wear particles, and tire tread debris (not size segregated) are analyzed using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The objective is to characterize such traffic-related sources on an organic compound basis and to search for molecular markers that will assist the identification of traffic-associated dusts in the urban atmosphere.
