5|$|The {{autonomous}} navigation of the Air-Cobot robot is in two phases. The first, navigation in {{the airport}} or the factory, allows <b>the</b> <b>robot</b> to move close to the aircraft.

In addition, <b>the</b> <b>robot</b> must insert itself in a dynamic environment where humans and vehicles are moving. To address this problem, it has an obstacle avoidance module. Many navigation algorithms are constantly running on <b>the</b> <b>robot</b> with real time constraints. Searches are conducted on optimizing the computing time.|$|E

5|$|Razer's four-wheeled {{drive train}} used a skid-steering arrangement, whereby the wheels {{on one side}} of <b>the</b> <b>robot</b> rotated faster than those on the other to turn the machine. Also, the weight of <b>the</b> <b>robot</b> was biased towards the rear so that its weapon stayed facing its {{opponent}} as Razer turned. However, the solid rubber rear wheels used in series two provided too much traction and were reluctant to 'swing' the machine. For the third series, Razer used custom-made aluminium drive wheels which incorporated rollers, reducing the amount of force required for simultaneous forward and sideways movement. These wheels were later upgraded with a stronger titanium construction, whilst the level of oversteer in the drive system was reduced through the implementation of an electronic gyroscope. For the series Robot Wars Extreme II, Razer's rubber front wheels were replaced with metal ones bearing small spiked protrusions.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Consider {{a system}} of {{multiple}} mobile robots in which each robot, at infinitely many unpredictable time instants, observes the positions of all <b>the</b> <b>robots</b> and moves to a new position determined by the given algorithm. <b>The</b> <b>robots</b> are anonymous {{in the sense that}} they all execute the same algorithm and they cannot be distinguished by their appearances. Initially they do not have a common x-y coordinate system. Such a system can be viewed as a distributed system of anonymous mobile processes in which the processes (i. e., robots) can “communicate ” with each other only by means of their moves. In this paper we investigate a number of formation problems of geometric patterns in the plane by <b>the</b> <b>robots.</b> Specifically, we present algorithms for converging <b>the</b> <b>robots</b> to a single point and moving <b>the</b> <b>robots</b> to a single point in finite steps.
