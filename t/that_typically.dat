5|$|Armillaria species form fleshy, white-spored {{mushrooms}} with a cottony or membranous veil <b>that</b> <b>typically</b> forms {{a distinct}} annulus on the stem. The fruit bodies usually occur in autumn in large clusters {{at the base}} of the stem or roots. Armillaria species can produce rhizomorphs—rootlike aggregations of hyphae—that can form massive, long-lasting underground networks. The growth of the rhizomorph networks allows for tree-to-tree spread of the fungus even when direct contact between diseased and healthy plants is not possible.|$|E
5|$|Height is not {{the sole}} {{criterion}} for distinguishing horses from ponies. Breed registries for horses <b>that</b> <b>typically</b> produce individuals both under and over 14.2h consider all animals of that breed to be horses regardless of their height. Conversely, some pony breeds may have features in common with horses, and individual animals may occasionally mature at over 14.2h, but are still considered to be ponies.|$|E
5|$|Many {{different}} mammalian {{species can}} be affected by prion diseases, as the prion protein (PrP) is very similar in all mammals. Due to small differences in PrP between different species it is unusual for a prion disease to transmit from one species to another. The human prion disease variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, however, {{is believed to be}} caused by a prion <b>that</b> <b>typically</b> infects cattle, causing Bovine spongiform encephalopathy and is transmitted through infected meat.|$|E

Luidia ciliaris has seven arms, members of the Solasteridae have ten to fifteen while the Antarctic Labidiaster annulatus can have up to fifty.

5|$|Additional collections, then still {{believed}} to be T.toomansis, were made from South Australia in 1952, again on dead cones of unspecified Banksia, and also in 1956 on dead cones of Banksia marginata. In 1957 and 1958, R. W. G. Dennis redescribed the species, and after consultation with Canadian mycologist James Walton Groves, who had earlier completed a monograph on the genus Tympanis, transferred the taxon to the genus Encoelia (family Sclerotiniaceae). Encoelia species are small, tough, brownish discomycetes <b>that</b> <b>typically</b> grow in clusters on hardwood or woody substrates. Because the original collections were incomplete and certain microscopic features inadequately described, various collections made from Australia were presumed to be variations of the original 1887 collection.|$|E

5|$|Galiella rufa, {{commonly}} known as the rubber cup, the rufous rubber cup, or the hairy rubber cup, is a species of fungus in the family Sarcosomataceae. The fungus produces cup-shaped fruit bodies <b>that</b> <b>typically</b> grow in clusters on branches and exposed portions of buried wood throughout eastern and Midwest North America and in Malaysia. The fruit bodies have the texture of tough, gelatinous rubber, and have a rough, blackish-brown, felt-like outer surface and a smooth reddish-brown inner surface. Although generally considered inedible by North American mushroom field guides, it is commonly consumed in Malaysia. The fungus produces several chemicals with a variety of bioactive properties.|$|E

I can never be safe; I always try and go against the grain. As soon as I accomplish one thing, I just set a higher goal. That's how I've gotten to where I am.|$|E
5|$|Malaria is a mosquito-borne {{infectious}} disease affecting humans {{and other animals}} caused by parasitic protozoans (a group of single-celled microorganisms) belonging to the Plasmodium type. Malaria causes symptoms <b>that</b> <b>typically</b> include fever, tiredness, vomiting, and headaches. In severe cases it can cause yellow skin, seizures, coma, or death. Symptoms usually begin ten to fifteen days after being bitten. If not properly treated, people may have recurrences of the disease months later. In those who have recently survived an infection, reinfection usually causes milder symptoms. This partial resistance disappears over months to years if the person has no continuing exposure to malaria.|$|E

5|$|Mars is a {{terrestrial}} planet {{that consists of}} minerals containing silicon and oxygen, metals, and other elements <b>that</b> <b>typically</b> make up rock. The surface of Mars is primarily composed of tholeiitic basalt, although parts are more silica-rich than typical basalt and may be similar to andesitic rocks on Earth or silica glass. Regions of low albedo suggest concentrations of plagioclase feldspar, with northern low albedo regions displaying higher than normal concentrations of sheet silicates and high-silicon glass. Parts of the southern highlands include detectable amounts of high-calcium pyroxenes. Localized concentrations of hematite and olivine have been found. Much of the surface is deeply covered by finely grained iron(III) oxide dust.|$|E
5|$|Similar fungi with simple, white fruit bodies include Clavaria acuta, {{an equally}} {{widespread}} species <b>that</b> <b>typically</b> grows singly {{or in small}} groups rather than in dense clusters and can be distinguished microscopically by its clamped basidia and larger spores; the morphologically similar, but rare C.atkinsoniana, found in the southwestern and central United States, which cannot be distinguished from C.fragilis by field characteristics alone but has larger spores—8.5–10 by 4.5–5µm; C.rubicundula, another North American species, which is similar in stature but has a reddish tint; and Multiclavula mucida, a widespread lichenized species with smaller fruit bodies that occurs with its associated algae on moist wood.|$|E
5|$|Suillus luteus is {{a pioneer}} species <b>that</b> <b>typically</b> {{establishes}} {{itself in the}} early stages of forest succession. The fungus forms mycorrhizal associations with various species of pine, including Scots pine (P.sylvestris), black pine (P.nigra), and Macedonian pine (P.peuce) in Europe, and red pine (P.resinosa) and white pine (P.strobus) in North America. An in vitro experiment demonstrated that the species could form an ectomycorrhizal association with Aleppo pine (P.halepensis), a key species used in reforestation in the Mediterranean. A study of the ectomycorrhizal fungi associated with a lodgepole pine (P.contorta) invasion front near Coyhaique, Chile, showed that many invasive trees were supported by S.luteus as the sole mycorrhizal partner.|$|E

In order to maximize the device's battery life, Asus engineers spent one month attempting to reduce electrical leakage by measuring heat and voltage at every point on the printed circuit board (PCB). The tablet includes a highly efficient power management integrated circuit designed by Maxim Integrated Products. Google claims the Nexus7's battery life allows 9hours of HD video playback, 10hours of web browsing or e-reading, and 300hours on standby.|$|E

5|$|The post-conventional level, {{also known}} as the principled level, is marked by a growing {{realization}} that individuals are separate entities from society, and that the individual’s own perspective may take precedence over society’s view; individuals may disobey rules inconsistent with their own principles. Post-conventional moralists live by their own ethical principles—principles <b>that</b> <b>typically</b> include such basic human rights as life, liberty, and justice. People who exhibit post-conventional morality view rules as useful but changeable mechanisms—ideally rules can maintain the general social order and protect human rights. Rules are not absolute dictates that must be obeyed without question. Because post-conventional individuals elevate their own moral evaluation of a situation over social conventions, their behavior, especially at stage six, can be confused with that of those at the pre-conventional level.|$|E
