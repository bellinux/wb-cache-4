5|$|Lynch {{has also}} been honored by the French {{government}} with induction into the Legion of Honour, first being honored as a Chevalier (knight) in 2002, and again as an Officier (officer) in 2009. In 2012, Lynch was presented with <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> city of Bydgoszcz, Poland, by the city's mayor Rafał Bruski.

5|$|Modern historians, however, {{doubt the}} {{veracity}} of this theory. For one thing, notes Kenneth R. Beesley, the Deseret News and every book published in the alphabet prominently feature <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> alphabet, and anyone without a key could have gotten a copy of A Journey to Great-Salt-Lake City, or traveled to Salt Lake City themselves and bought one. Contemporary scholars Richard F. Burton and Jules Remy also dismissed the secrecy argument, in 1860 and 1855 respectively.|$|E
5|$|Smallpeice {{was also}} honoured by various other countries, and {{was made a}} member of the National Order of the Cedar by Lebanon in 1955.

5|$|St. John's {{economy is}} {{connected}} to both its role as the provincial capital of Newfoundland and Labrador and to the ocean. The civil service which {{is supported by the}} federal, provincial and municipal governments has been <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> expansion of the city's labour force and to the stability of its economy, which supports a sizable retail, service and business sector. The provincial government is the largest employer in the city, followed by Memorial University.|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} of planetesimals {{is the biggest}} unsolved problem in the nebular disk model. How 1cm sized particles coalesce into 1km planetesimals is a mystery.

5|$|Although such a {{long-range}} {{attack on a}} state far from {{the centre of the}} Empire may seem extraordinary (the last time the Empire had attempted anything on this scale was the failed invasion of Sicily over one hundred and twenty years earlier), it can be explained in terms of Manuel's foreign policy, which was to use the Latins to ensure the survival of the Empire. This focus on the bigger picture of the eastern Mediterranean and even further afield thus led Manuel to intervene in Egypt: it was believed that {{in the context of the}} wider struggle between the crusader states and the Islamic powers of the east, control of Egypt would be the deciding factor. It had become clear that the ailing Fatimid Caliphate of Egypt held <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fate of the crusader states. If Egypt came out of its isolation and joined forces with the Muslims under Nur ad-Din, the crusader cause was in trouble.|$|E

5|$|Building on his progress, Champollion now {{began to}} study other texts in {{addition}} to the Rosetta stone, studying a series of much older inscriptions from Abu Simbel. During 1823, he succeeded in identifying the names of pharaohs Ramesses and Thutmose written in cartouches in these ancient texts. With the help of a new acquaintance the Duke de Blacas in 1824, Champollion finally published the Précis du système hiéroglyphique des anciens Égyptiens dedicated to and funded by King Louis XVIII. Here he presented the first correct translation of the hieroglyphs and <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Egyptian grammatical system.|$|E
5|$|Calhoun's father, Patrick Calhoun, {{helped shape}} his son's {{political}} views. He was a staunch supporter of slavery who taught his son that social standing depended not merely on {{a commitment to}} the ideal of popular self-government but also on the ownership of a substantial number of slaves. Flourishing {{in a world in which}} slaveholding was a hallmark of civilization, Calhoun saw little reason to question its morality as an adult. He further believed that slavery instilled in the remaining whites a code of honor that blunted the disruptive potential of private gain and fostered the civic-mindedness that lay near the core of the republican creed. From such a standpoint, the expansion of slavery decreased the likelihood for social conflict and postponed the declension when money would become the only measure of self-worth, as had happened in New England. Calhoun was thus firmly convinced that slavery was <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> success of the American dream.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though it}} had lost its {{defensive}} role, {{it was one of}} the strongest fortresses in the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland up until the Second Partition of Poland of April 21, 1793. when both Kamianets-Podilskyi Castle and the city were transferred to the sovereignty of the Russian Empire. On the same day, the castle's commandant gave up <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> castle and swore allegiance to the empire in the city's cathedral. One hundred and one artillery cannons later saluted the commandant's decision inside the castle. During the French invasion of Russia of 1812, the Russian Imperial Army was stationed in the castle. In 1815, Konstantin Batyushkov, who later became a well-known poet and writer, was stationed as an officer in the castle. In 1846, poet Vladimir Raevsky was stationed in the castle, during which time he established a pro-Decembrist organization of progressively-minded army officers.|$|E

5|$|Fletcher, {{along with}} Yorktowns {{commanding}} officer, Captain Elliott Buckmaster, and their staffs, had acquired first-hand experience in organizing and launching a full strike against an enemy {{force in the}} Coral Sea, {{but there was no}} time to pass these lessons on to Enterprise and Hornet which were tasked with launching the first strike. Spruance ordered the striking aircraft to proceed to target immediately, rather than waste time waiting for the strike force to assemble, since neutralizing enemy carriers was <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> survival of his own task force.|$|E
5|$|Further {{work was}} {{conducted}} by Otto von Guericke, Robert Boyle, Stephen Gray and C. F. du Fay. In the 18th century, Benjamin Franklin conducted extensive research in electricity, selling his possessions to fund his work. In June 1752 he is reputed to have attached a metal key {{to the bottom of}} a dampened kite string and flown the kite in a storm-threatened sky. A succession of sparks jumping from <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> back of his hand showed that lightning was indeed electrical in nature. He also explained the apparently paradoxical behavior of the Leyden jar as a device for storing large amounts of electrical charge in terms of electricity consisting of both positive and negative charges.|$|E
5|$|Henry's {{ability to}} govern was intimately {{bound up with}} the Church, which formed <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{administration}} of both England and Normandy, and this relationship changed considerably {{over the course of his}} reign. William the Conqueror had reformed the English Church with the support of his Archbishop of Canterbury, Lanfranc, who became a close colleague and advisor to the King. Under William Rufus this arrangement had collapsed, the King and Archbishop Anselm had become estranged and Anselm had gone into exile. Henry also believed in Church reform, but on taking power in England he became embroiled in the investiture controversy.|$|E

5|$|In {{the course}} of his career, Lynch has {{received}} multiple awards and nominations. Amongst these are three Academy Award nominations for Best Director, and a nomination for best screenplay. Lynch has twice won France's César Award for Best Foreign Film, as well as the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival and a Golden Lion award for lifetime achievement at the Venice Film Festival. The French government has awarded him the Legion of Honour, the country's top civilian distinction, honoring him first as a Chevalier in 2002 and then as an Officier in 2009; Lynch has also been awarded <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> city of Bydgoszcz, Poland.|$|E
5|$|Introduced as Billie Jenkins's long-lost sister, she {{secretly}} collaborates {{with the}} demonic council {{known as the}} Triad with their plans to destroy the Charmed Ones. She eventually convinces Billie that the Charmed Ones are corrupt, and use their power to fulfill their own personal desires, rather than help for the greater good. Billie kills Christy in self-defense after being unable to convince her to understand the Halliwell sisters were good, and to return home with her. Throughout season eight, Christy is {{shown to be a}} powerful witch with a mastery of her powers of telepathy and pyrokinesis. She is also called <b>the</b> <b>Key</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ultimate Power due to her connection with Billie, who is prophesied to be the Ultimate Power.

5|$|On September 6, Montgomery led a probing {{force to}} Fort St. Johns, <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> British defense of Montreal. Montgomery led {{the main body}} of troops toward the fort through a marshy and heavily wooded area. A {{flanking}} party led by Captain Matthew Mead was ambushed by 100 Native Americans allied to the British. The party held its ground, forcing the ambushing Natives to fall back to the fort. Montgomery, fearing that the British force was larger than he had anticipated, called off operations {{for the rest of the}} day and withdrew his force to a spot beyond the range of the British guns. Believing that the fort could not be captured quickly, Schuyler recalled Montgomery's force and fortified Île aux Noix.|$|E
5|$|Over the winter, {{there seems}} to have been some tension between the Allies. In particular, the Athenians, who were not {{protected}} by the isthmus, but whose fleet were <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> security of the Peloponnesus, felt hard done by. They demanded an Allied army march north the following year. When the other Allies failed to commit to this, the Athenian fleet probably refused to join the Allied navy in the spring. The navy, now under the command of the Spartan king Leotychides, thus skulked off Delos, while the remnants of the Persian fleet skulked off Samos, both sides unwilling to risk battle. Similarly, Mardonius remained in Thessaly, knowing an attack on the isthmus was pointless, while the Allies refused to send an army outside the Peloponessus.|$|E
