5|$|The London Underground {{has also}} owned several {{departmental}} self-powered vehicles designed for other duties. These include a tunnel cleaning train, {{consisting of two}} 1938 stock motor cars and three purpose-built cars, which act like a giant vacuum cleaner, and can hold 6 tons of dust before the filter tanks need to be emptied. Three Plasser & Theurer <b>track</b> <b>tamping</b> machines were purchased in 1980, and two Unimog road-rail vehicles were obtained in 1983 and 1986, for use as depot shunters.|$|E
50|$|The {{traditional}} use {{of these}} locomotives has been to haul trains using power from the rails until they reach the area where work is to be undertaken, where they switch to battery operation if the traction supply has been isolated. They are also used for transporting diesel powered equipment such as <b>track</b> <b>tamping</b> machines through tunnel sections. Normally one locomotive is marshalled {{at each end of}} the train, allowing the train to be reversed easily. The connections between different Underground lines often require reversals on route. Early locomotives were not allowed to operate on their own as they only had a single air compressor, but twin compressors were fitted to vehicles built from 1964 onwards, to allow single operation.With the building of the Jubilee line diesel-powered locomotives manufactured by Schöma of Germany in 1996 took over some of the duties of the battery locomotives.|$|E
40|$|The diploma´s thesis {{deals with}} {{evaluation}} of adjusted <b>track</b> <b>tamping</b> technology and its comparison with currently used technology. This {{is based on}} track geometry parameters measuring and its vertical movement on the test section, which was created on double track Břeclav – Přerov near Rohatec station. On this test section one line was tamped with the currently used method within regular maintenance work and the second line was tamped with the adjusted technology. The technology modification is based on application of increased number of tamping tines squeezing strokes, which results in a creation of bigger and more compacted sleeper bed. The point of this thesis is to verify, that {{the speed of the}} track geometry parameters degradation is smaller in case of adjusted technology use. Thanks to that {{it would be possible to}} extend the maintenance cycles in case of compliance with track parameters maintenance limits and traffic safety...|$|E

2500|$|Track needs regular {{maintenance}} {{to remain}} in good order, especially when high-speed trains are involved. Inadequate maintenance {{may lead to a}} [...] "slow order" [...] (North American terminology, or Temporary speed restriction in the United Kingdom) being imposed to avoid accidents (see Slow zone). Track maintenance was at one time hard manual labour, requiring teams of labourers, or trackmen (US: gandy dancers; UK: platelayers; Australia: fettlers), who used lining bars to correct irregularities in horizontal alignment (line) of the <b>track,</b> and <b>tamping</b> and jacks to correct vertical irregularities (surface). Currently, maintenance is facilitated by a variety of specialised machines.|$|R
50|$|A DTS will {{normally}} {{be used only}} after a stretch of <b>track</b> has been <b>tamped</b> and aligned. D.G.S. has a vibrating unit which holds the track in position and applies a horizontal vibration and vertical load to simulate the passage of trains. The track parameters (or cross levels), before and after stabilising, can be viewed through bogies {{in the front and}} rear.|$|R
2500|$|If the {{trackbed}} becomes uneven, it {{is necessary}} to pack ballast underneath sunk ties to level the track out again. This is, in the mechanized age, usually done by a ballast tamping machine. A more recent, and probably better, technique is to lift the rails and ties, and to force stones, smaller than the track ballast particles and all of the same size, into the gap. This has the advantage of not disturbing the well-compacted ballast on the <b>trackbed,</b> as <b>tamping</b> is likely to do. This technique is called pneumatic ballast injection (PBI), or, less formally, [...] "stoneblowing". However, this technique is not as effective with fresh ballast, as the smaller stones tend to move down between the larger pieces of ballast.|$|R
40|$|International audienceBallasted tracks {{have been}} widely used because of their {{flexibility}} {{from the point of view}} of construction and maintenance. The deterioration of the railway track under heavy train traffics induces various irregularities in the track mainly due to differential settlement. In order to restore the initial geometry of the <b>track,</b> the ballast <b>tamping</b> operation is currently in use. In this work, we focused on the influence of tamping on ballast compaction by means of three-dimensional Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulations...|$|R
40|$|A {{geosynthetic}} material, {{known as}} the GEOWEB cellular confinement system, {{has been shown to}} significantly reduce traffic-induced stresses passed into the track subgrade. The material was tested in track at the Facility for Accelerated Service Testing at FRAs Transportation Technology Center near Pueblo, Colorado. Before placement of the GEOWEB system, the soft clay subgrade was deforming at a relatively rapid rate with a track substructure composed of conventional ballast/subballast with a combined layer thickness of 18 inches. For these conditions the <b>track</b> required <b>tamping</b> every 15 MGT on average to maintain track class 4 geometry. Due to the increased stiffness produced by (C) AREMA (R) 2000 2 the subballast-GEOWEB layer, compared to the subballast layer alone, the reduced subgrade stresses allowed the tamping cycle to increase beyond 160 MGT of heavy (39 ton) axle load traffic.

50|$|The {{station was}} opened on 5 October 1863 by the Kent Coast Railway (KCR). The KCR was {{operated}} by the London, Chatham and Dover Railway (LCDR), which absorbed the KCR on 1 July 1871, and the station was renamed Birchington-on-Sea by the LCDR in October 1878. From the start of 1899, the LCDR's services were {{operated by the}} newly formed South Eastern and Chatham Railway, which the LCDR co-owned with the South Eastern Railway (SER). At the start of 1923, the LCDR amalgamated with other railways (including the SER) to form the Southern Railway. A small goods yard was situated on the Up London bound side of the station which closed in the 1970s and operated by the signalbox located midway on the down platform closed {{about the same time}} during a resignalling programme. The wire and rod cutout can still be seen within the brick face of the down platform. The 2007 Budget plan of Network Rail allows for the removal of the remaining manual turnround and it is believed short residual siding occasionally used for storing <b>tamping</b> <b>track</b> maintenance units, 'tampers'.A junction existed {{to the west of the}} station to serve RAF Manston until the 1930s operated from a Ground Frame Birchington B located some 440 yd upside of the station - a plan of which can be seen in the RAF Manston Museum.|$|R
40|$|New {{railway track}} is laid to a {{specified}} level and alignment. However, {{with time and}} trafficking movements occur in the ballast bed and the underlying subgrade, and frequent maintenance is necessary to re-establish the correct geometry. This is currently done {{by the process of}} tamping, where extra material is vibrated under the sleeper to raise its level. Unfortunately this is not permanent, and the sleeper eventually reverts to its premaintenance state. Prior to mechanised <b>tamping,</b> <b>track</b> was relevelled by hand shovel packing in which the sleepers were raised and fine aggregate shovelled into the space under the sleeper, giving a permanent lift. A prototype of a mechanised version of this process, called the Stoneblower, has been developed and is currently undergoing field trials. It lifts the sleeper and blows single size stone smaller than the ballast into the void space, creating a two layer granular foundation for each sleeper. In order to get {{a better understanding of the}} behaviour of a two layer granular foundation when subjected to repeated loading a laboratory study involving large scale cyclic triaxial testing of single size and two layer ballast has been carried out. This has been complemented by a large scale model study using a 'half sleeper rig' in which ballast beds similar to those produced by stoneblowing have been subjected to repeated loading simulating long term railway trafficking. These tests have been used to carry out a parametric study into stone angularity, stone size and layer geometry to assess their influence on the layered system, with the results being assessed primarily in terms of the resilient modulus and plastic deformation undergone by the material. In the triaxial tests it was found that the layer of smaller material was the major controlling factor for the deformation. However, the layer of larger material tended to act as a restraint, effectively reducing the HID ratio of the specimen. In the model testing, it was found that the smaller material dictated how the load was transmitted to the ballast bed, and this was then responsible for the majority of the settlement...|$|R
