5|$|The {{succeeding}} year, {{the only}} time since 1851, the school did not hold a commencement. Members of the senior class had decided {{to make fun of}} the professors in the Green Bag—City College's year book since 1896. When <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>board</b> was alerted of the matter, it attempted to censor the edition, passing a resolution requiring the Green Bag to be reviewed by Principal Francis A. Soper. However, the year book had already been printed, and the editors refused to have the edition censored and reprinted. <b>The</b> <b>school</b> <b>board</b> responded by withholding the diplomas of six of the editors of the Green Bag and the business manager, and by preventing the school from holding a commencement ceremony. One of the boys expelled, Clarence Keating Bowie, became a member of <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>board</b> in 1926.|$|E

5|$|He {{was elected}} the first {{president}} of the Edmonton Board of Trade upon its founding in 1889. He served until 1894. He also played a vital {{role in the development of}} the school system in Edmonton, involving himself in education-related affairs as early as 1881, and serving on the public school board from 1886–87 and 1889 until 1897. In 1881, he was part of a group that provided funds for the first school teacher in the city. In 1886, with <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>board,</b> Cameron was responsible for introducing a fee for the parents of students attending schools in the Edmonton Public School District who did not live within the district, as district residents were taxed for the school's services. He would serve as secretary-treasurer from 1882 to 1884 and later as chairman of <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>board</b> from 1890 to 1892 and 1894.|$|E
5|$|In 1879, after Stone {{organized}} a petition by suffragists across the state, Massachusetts women were given strictly delimited voting rights: {{a woman who}} could prove the same qualifications as a male voter was allowed to cast her vote for members of <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>board.</b> Stone applied to the voting board in Boston but was required to sign her husband's surname as her own.

5|$|In 1988, {{the city}} opened their first library building, which {{replaced}} the one-room library located in space leased {{from the school}} district. The population grew to 7,106 at the 1990 census, and in 1991 the Town Center Shopping Center along Wilsonville Road opened. Due to growth in the West Linn-Wilsonville School District, <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>board</b> approved building a new high school to be located in Wilsonville in 1992.|$|E

Based on recommendations specified by the Township Council, the Board of Education approved $544,391 in cuts. The school budget was rejected again in 2009, with the Council cutting $1 million from the $94.8 million originally proposed. After the 2010 school budget failed, the Township Council removed $6.1 million from the $95 million budget proposed by the school district, zeroing out {{what would have been}} an 8.2% increase in the school tax levy. <b>The</b> <b>school</b> <b>board</b> eliminated 77 positions to meet the cuts approved by the council.|$|E
5|$|It {{is illegal}} to serve alcohol to anyone under 21, {{encourage}} an underage person to drink, knowingly allow underage drinking on property that one owns or leases, or possess alcoholic beverages on public school property without written consent of <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>board</b> or school principal. State law grants an exemption for religious services, and for parents and guardians over 21 who serve alcohol to their own children in a private location (such as a private home).|$|E
5|$|School resumed on September 5, 1927, and, for the 1927–1928 school year, {{was held}} in the {{community}} hall, township hall, and two retail buildings. Most of the students returned. The board appointed O. M. Brant of Luther, Michigan, to succeed Huyck as superintendent. The Lansing architect Warren Holmes donated construction plans, and <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>board</b> approved the contracts for the new building on September 14. On September 15, Michigan's Republican U.S. Senator James J. Couzens presented his personal check for $75,000 (roughly $ in today's money) to the Bath construction fund to build the new school.|$|E

5|$|The Baltimore City Board of School Commissioners {{ultimately}} accepted {{all but one}} of {{the task}} force's recommendations in 1979. The group recommended maintaining the school's then-141-year-old tradition of all-male education. Citing concerns over conflicting federal and district court decisions which had not yet been resolved by the U.S. Supreme Court, <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>board</b> voted to make City a coeducational school. The board's action followed trends at the time at all-male colleges and universities like Harvard University, Yale University, and nearby Johns Hopkins University, which admitted women during the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|The {{combined}} school retains the name School for the Creative and Performing Arts. Private donors {{will have a}} significant and ongoing voice in how the school is operated. According to the Cincinnati Enquirer, <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>board</b> approved a plan in 2003 to allow the GCAEC to choose five of the twelve members of the Local School Decision-Making Committee (LSDMC), an independent body that provides oversight for the school, {{as a condition for}} continued fund-raising. This private sector oversight has been criticized by union leaders as excluding faculty and staff. The GCAEC began fundraising for an endowment in 2010, and as of 2010, had pledged to contribute at least $150,000 per year to the school.|$|E
5|$|In 1892, Louisville factory owner Alfred Victor du Pont donated $150,000 to {{the board}} of Louisville Public Schools to {{establish}} a training school to teach young men industrial arts ("manual") skills that would fit them for their duties in life. The Victorian building was built on the corner of Brook and Oak Streets by the firm of Clark and Loomis, which also designed the Speed Art Museum and Waverly Hills Sanatorium. After Manual moved out of the building it was used as a Middle School until 1974 when it was converted to apartments. Manual's first principal, Henry Kleinschmid, was a favorite of du Pont but was unpopular with <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>board,</b> which conspired to replace him in 1895. Despite a summer of controversy and protest from the du Pont family, Manual's first two graduating classes and the four major local newspapers, the board replaced him with Harry Brownell on July 2.|$|E

5|$|In 1913, Louisville Public Schools {{announced}} {{a plan to}} merge Manual and its rival Male High School into Louisville Boys High so that the two schools could share a new $300,000 facility. The plan took effect in 1915. Industrial training classes continued at the old Manual building. Parents objected to their children having to travel between the two buildings and the consolidation did not save <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>board</b> any money, so they voted to end the experiment in 1919. The new building became Male's home for the next 70 years and Manual returned to its old building at Brook and Oak. In 1923 an expansion added new laboratories, a cafeteria, and the largest gym ever built in Louisville at the time. The addition eventually burned {{and had to be}} destroyed in 1991.|$|E
5|$|In North Carolina, {{there was}} often a {{strategy}} of nominally accepting Brown, but tacitly resisting it. On May 18, 1954 the Greensboro, North Carolina school board declared that it would abide by the Brown ruling. This {{was the result of}} the initiative of D.E. Hudgins Jr, a former Rhodes Scholar and prominent attorney, who chaired <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>board.</b> This made Greensboro the first, and for years the only, city in the South, to announce its intent to comply. However, others in the city resisted integration, putting up legal obstacles to the actual implementation of school desegregation for years afterward, and in 1969, the federal government found the city was not in compliance with the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Transition to a fully integrated school system did not begin until 1971, after numerous local lawsuits and both nonviolent and violent demonstrations. Historians have noted the irony that Greensboro, which had heralded itself as such a progressive city, was one of the last holdouts for school desegregation.|$|E
5|$|Minneapolis Public Schools enroll 36,370 {{students}} in public {{primary and secondary}} schools.
