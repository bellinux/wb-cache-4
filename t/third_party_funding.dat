50|$|Legal {{financing}} companies normally provide {{money in}} the form of a lump sum payment, and generally no specific account is established for the litigant. If the case proceeds to trial and the litigant loses, the <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>funding</b> company receives nothing and loses the money they have invested in the case. In other words, if the litigant loses, he does not have to repay the money. In addition, litigants generally do not have to pay monthly fees after obtaining legal financing. Instead, no payments of any kind are made until the case settles or judgment is obtained, which could occur months or years after legal funding is received. Accordingly, to qualify for funding with a legal financing company, a litigant's case must have sufficient merit that the company deems its investment in the case to be worth the risk.|$|E
