Listen to the song. <b>This</b> <b>guy</b> <b>is</b> a loser." [...] In writing about the song in the liner notes of his Songs in the Attic album, Joel once again emphasized the point: [...] "...so many friends shoveled under the Long Island dirt.

500|$|In one {{sequence}} {{the character}} Martin Vanger plays the song [...] "Orinoco Flow" [...] by Enya before beginning his torture of Mikael Blomkvist. David Fincher, the director, {{said that he}} believed that Martin [...] "doesn’t like to kill, he doesn’t like to hear the screams, without hearing his favorite music" [...] so therefore the character should play a song during the scene. Daniel Craig, the actor who played Blomkvist, selected [...] "Orinoco Flow" [...] on his iPod as a candidate song. Fincher said [...] "And we all almost pissed ourselves, we were laughing so hard. No, actually, it’s worse than that. He said, ‘Orinoco Flow!’ Everybody looked at each other, like, what is he talking about?

His final public concerts were held in Fukuoka Dome in Japan on December 19–20, 1994. The {{following}} year, Sinatra sang for the very last time on February 25, 1995, before a live audience of 1200 select guests at the Palm Desert Marriott Ballroom, on the closing night of the Frank Sinatra Desert Classic golf tournament.

500|$|The {{episode was}} written to humanize Sawyer {{and set up}} the love {{triangle}} between him, Kate and Jack. Kate was meant to look at Sawyer in a new way, and, according to Lindelof, think, [...] "wow, <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> <b>is</b> not just a belligerent." [...] The episode also shows the moral ambiguity of some characters by revealing more of their personalities, with the ones introduced as protagonists doing things that are generally not viewed as protagonist-like– an example being Jack beating Sawyer and eventually asking Sayid to torture him; and an antagonistic character, Sawyer, proving not to be solely antagonist-like– an example being his backstory and flashback, which show that he is not exclusively evil. Lindelof explained that he wanted Sawyer to [...] "come out of his shell a little, and say to the audience, 'you're supposed to like this guy'", further explaining, [...] "the root of him being an asshole is that these horrible things happened to him {{when he was a little}} kid, and he's really really angry." ...|$|E

500|$|Concerning the {{recording}} of the album's opening song [...] "N.Y. State of Mind", producer DJ Premier later stated [...] "Nas — he's one of our saviors now. When we did ‘N.Y. State of Mind,’ at the beginning when he says, ‘Straight out the dungeons of rap / Where fake niggas don’t make it back,’ then you hear him say, ‘I don’t know how to start this shit,’ ’cause he had just written it. He's got the beat running in the studio, but he doesn’t know how he's going to format how he's going to convey it. So he's going, ‘I don’t know how to start this shit,’ and I’m counting him in [...] One, two, three. And then you can hear him go, ‘Yo,’ and then he goes right into it." [...] DJ Premier later discussed the unexpectedness of Nas's delivery during {{the recording}}, stating [...] "He didn’t know how he was gonna come in, but he just started going because we were recording. I’m actually yelling, ‘We’re recording!’ and banging on the [...] window. ‘Come on, get ready!’ You hear him start the shit: Rappers…. And then everyone in the studio was like, ‘Oh, my God’, ’cause it was so unexpected. He was not ready. So we used that first verse. And {{that was when he}} was up and coming, his first album. So we was like, 'Yo, <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> <b>is</b> gonna be big.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Larry Drake as Robert G. Durant, a ruthless, sadistic mob {{boss and}} the head of his own {{criminal}} organization.

Furthermore, the actor felt that [...] "at heart he thinks he's Indiana Jones but the circumstances are always too much for him". Russell felt that the film would be a hard one to market. [...] "This is a difficult picture to sell because it's hard to explain. It's a mixture of the real history of Chinatown in San Francisco blended with Chinese legend and lore. It's bizarre stuff.
