5|$|As a child, Morrissey {{was greatly}} {{interested}} in film, television and Gene Kelly musicals. After seeing a broadcast of Kes on television, {{he decided to}} become an actor. At his primary school, St Margaret Mary's School, he was encouraged by a teacher named Miss Keller, who cast him as the Scarecrow in a school production adapted from The Wonderful Wizard of Oz when he was 11 years old. Keller left the school soon after, leaving Morrissey without encouragement. His secondary school, De La Salle School, had no drama classes and {{was the sort of}} place where Morrissey thought the fear of bullying dissuaded pupils from participating in lessons. On the advice of a cousin, Morrissey joined the Everyman Youth Theatre. For the first couple of weeks, he was quite shy and did not join in the workshops. When he eventually participated, he appeared in the youth theatre's production of Fighting Chance, a play about the riots in Liverpool. He went to the theatre on <b>Tuesday</b> <b>and</b> <b>Wednesday</b> nights.|$|E

25|$|Just over a {{week before}} the weekend of the grand prix, there was an {{organised}} test session at the track for four days, with primary focus on aerodynamic set-ups.

Both Ferrari and Red Bull took advantage of these conditions and scored first and second fastest times respectively on both <b>Tuesday</b> <b>and</b> <b>Wednesday.</b> The wet weather eventually led to a fourth day of testing, in which Red Bull driver David Coulthard broke Ferrari's run and set the fastest time by 0.2 seconds.|$|E

25|$|Throughout the {{two days}} that the whale was in the Thames waters, there were {{unconfirmed}} sightings of a second whale near the Thames Barrier and in Southend-on-Sea.

The first stage is the development of story and plot, which is carried out by a team of writers. Once the stories have been fleshed out and agreed, a scene breakdown is created. The episodes are then assigned to script writers, who create the dialogue and stage directions for the actors.|$|E

500|$|At {{the heart}} of the Octavia Hill system was the weekly visit to collect rent. From the outset, Hill {{conceived}} this as a job for women only. She and her assistants (who included Emma Cons and Eva McLaren) combined the weekly rent collection with checking every detail of the premises and getting to know the tenants personally, acting as early social workers. At first Hill believed, [...] "Voluntary workers are a necessity. They are better than paid workers, and can be had in sufficient numbers." [...] Later, she found it expedient to maintain a paid workforce. Her system required a large staff. Rent was collected on Monday, <b>Tuesday</b> <b>and</b> <b>Wednesday</b> mornings. Rent accounts were balanced in the afternoons and arrangements were made with contractors for repairs. On Thursdays and Fridays arrears were pursued, contractors' invoices paid, new tenancy lettings and tenants' moves organised.|$|E
