5|$|Written by Gareth Roberts. A story idea {{considered}} for the seventh and eighth episodes of the fourth series. It would have seen Sarah Jane being kidnapped and replaced by an identical look-alike. It was ultimately replaced by The Empty Planet as the production team was concerned it had <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> feel of the 1970s Gerry Anderson science-fiction series, UFO.|$|E
5|$|Game three {{was held}} in Winnipeg on September 6. After the second game, the Soviets {{said that they had}} strayed into playing <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Canadian style, as individuals, and promised to return to their team style for the third game. Canada went with the same lineup as game two, with the {{exception}} of Ratelle replacing Bill Goldsworthy. Team Canada held leads of 3–1 and 4–2, but the Soviet side responded and the game ended in a 4–4 tie.|$|E
5|$|Vainio's {{childhood}} {{heart problems}} surfaced again in 1990 {{with his sister}} Marja recalling that he often placed {{his hand over his}} heart. He had even finished writing his will. At one time Vainio was travelling to Florida with his friend, composer Veikko Samuli. Vainio {{had to go to the}} bathroom during the flight, and soon there was a call for a doctor from the flight crew. Vainio had kept his heart medicines in his pocket, where the box had opened and mixed with his pastilles. Vainio had eaten <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> medicine by accident, and his heartbeat started to slow down. Once a stewardess found out what had happened, she saved Vainio's life by quickly forcing him to vomit.|$|E

5|$|In {{coherence}} scanning interferometry, interference is only achieved {{when the}} path length delays of the interferometer are matched within the coherence {{time of the}} light source. CSI monitors the fringe contrast rather than the phase of the fringes. Fig.17 illustrates a CSI microscope using a Mirau interferometer in the objective; other forms of interferometer used with white light include the Michelson interferometer (for low magnification objectives, where the reference mirror in a Mirau objective would interrupt <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aperture) and the Linnik interferometer (for high magnification objectives with limited working distance). The sample (or alternatively, the objective) is moved vertically over the full height range of the sample, and the position of maximum fringe contrast is found for each pixel. The chief benefit of coherence scanning interferometry is that systems can be designed that do not suffer from the 2pi ambiguity of coherent interferometry, and as seen in Fig.18, which scans a 180μmx140μmx10μm volume, it is well suited to profiling steps and rough surfaces. The axial resolution {{of the system is}} determined in part by the coherence length of the light source. Industrial applications include in-process surface metrology, roughness measurement, 3D surface metrology in hard-to-reach spaces and in hostile environments, profilometry of surfaces with high aspect ratio features (grooves, channels, holes), and film thickness measurement (semi-conductor and optical industries, etc.).|$|E
5|$|Secret of Mana was {{originally}} {{planned to be}} a launch title for the SNES-CD add-on. After the contract between Nintendo and Sony to produce the add-on failed, and Sony repurposed its work on the SNES-CD into the competing PlayStation console, Square adapted the game for the SNES cartridge format. The game had to be altered to fit the storage space of a SNES game cartridge, which is much smaller {{than that of a}} CD-ROM. The developers initially resisted continuing the project without the CD add-on, believing that <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game would have to be cut, but they were overruled by company management. As a result of the hardware change, several features had to be cut from the game, and some completed work needed to be redone. One of the most significant changes was the removal of the option to take multiple routes through the game that led to several possible endings, in contrast to the linear journey in the final product. The plot that remained was different than the original conception, and Tanaka has said that the original story had a much darker tone. Ishii has estimated that up to forty percent of the planned game was dropped to meet the space limitations, and critics have suggested that the hardware change led to technical problems when too much happens at once in the game. In 2006, Level magazine claimed that Secret of Manas rocky development was Square's main inspiration to move their games, such as the Final Fantasy series, from Nintendo consoles to Sony consoles in 1996.|$|E
25|$|The Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy {{notes that}} {{consumption}} of unripened persimmons {{has been identified}} as causing epidemics of intestinal bezoars, and that up to 90% of bezoars that occur from eating <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fruit require surgery for removal.|$|E

25|$|In case {{of balance}} of {{payments}} imbalances, Keynes recommended that both debtors and creditors should change their policies. As outlined by Keynes, countries with payment surpluses should increase their imports from the deficit countries, build factories in debtor nations, or donate to them—and thereby create a foreign trade equilibrium. Thus, Keynes was sensitive to the problem that placing <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> burden on the deficit country would be deflationary.|$|E
25|$|The largest {{population}} of feral camels is in Australia. There are around 700,000 feral dromedary camels in central parts of Australia, descended from those introduced {{as a method}} of transport in the 19th and early 20th centuries. This population is growing about 8% per year. Representatives of the Australian government have culled more than 100,000 of the animals in part because the camels use <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> limited resources needed by sheep farmers.|$|E
25|$|Calcium channel blocker {{toxicity}} is {{the taking}} of <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> medications known as calcium channel blockers (CCBs) either by accident or on purpose. This often causes a slow heart rate and low blood pressure. This can progress to the heart stopping altogether. Some CCBs can also cause a fast heart rate {{as a result of}} the low blood pressure. Other symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, sleepiness, and shortness of breath. Symptoms usually occur in the first six hours but with some forms of the medication may not start until 24 after hours.|$|E

25|$|Historically, {{poisoning}} {{was very}} successful in reducing wolf populations, particularly in the American West and Imperial Japan. Strychnine was {{the most frequently used}} compound. The poison would be typically mixed in lard or tallow, and spread on bits of meat, or placed within incisions on the bait. Though effective, the method had the disadvantage of greatly loosening the fur of the dead wolf, causing it to shed easily. Wolves killed by strychnine were typically skinned immediately after death, {{in order to avoid the}} fur absorbing <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> poison.|$|E
25|$|An alpine {{tree line}} is the highest {{elevation}} that sustains trees; higher up it is too cold, or the snow cover lasts for <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> year to sustain trees. The climate above the tree line of mountains is called an alpine climate, and the terrain {{can be described as}} alpine tundra. In the northern hemisphere treelines on north-facing slopes are lower than on south-facing slopes because the increased shade on north-facing slopes means the snowpack takes longer to melt. This shortens the growing season for trees. In the southern hemisphere, the south-facing slopes have the shorter growing season.|$|E
25|$|Hastings is {{connected}} to Napier through the Hawke's Bay Expressway, {{also known as the}} Napier-Hastings Expressway, and provides a more direct and efficient link between the two cities compared to SH2, and better access to Hawke's Bay Airport. The expressway also provides a more direct and efficient route to the Port of Napier for heavy-vehicle traffic coming from Hastings, as it allows them to avoid travelling through <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hastings urban area. The expressway has connections to many of Hastings's arterial roads that lead to the city centre and outlying suburbs, such as the junctions at Omahu Road, York Road/Flaxmere Ave and Evenden Road.|$|E

60|$|We cannot {{do without}} our {{inheritance}} from the forefathers who were <b>the</b> puppets <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cosmic process; the society which renounces {{it must be}} destroyed from without.

25|$|In {{the late}} 14th and 15th centuries the Carmelites, like {{a number of}} other {{religious}} orders, declined and reform became imperative. In 1432 the Carmelites obtained from Pope Eugenius IV the bull Romani pontificis, which mitigated the Rule of St Albert and the 1247 modification, on the ground that the original demanded <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> friars. The main clauses modified concerned fasting and remaining within individual cells: the bull allowed them to eat meat three days a week and to perambulate in the cloisters of their convents. This reform brought the Carmelites closer into line with other mendicant orders, but it was also the source of much subsequent tension, as others refused to accept this change {{in the nature of the}} Order, seeing it as a loss of Carmel's original vision and spirit.|$|E
25|$|The United Kingdom {{insisted on}} special {{status as a}} longstanding belligerent during the war, {{concerned}} {{that if it were}} treated equally with the devastated continental powers it would receive virtually no aid. The Americans were pushing the importance of free trade and European unity to form a bulwark against communism. The Truman administration, represented by William L. Clayton, promised the Europeans that they would be free to structure the plan themselves, but the administration also reminded the Europeans that implementation depended on the plan's passage through Congress. A majority of Congress members were committed to free trade and European integration, and were hesitant to spend <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> money on Germany. However, before the Marshall Plan was in effect, France, Austria, and Italy needed immediate aid. On December 17, 1947, the United States agreed to give $40 million to France, Austria, China, and Italy.|$|E
25|$|After {{staying on}} during the fifteenth season under Williams for a brief {{handover}} period, Holmes also left the programme, and his replacement, Anthony Read, worked with Williams, who was told to create a less violent and more humour-based approach, much to Baker's liking. The actor now felt very possessive of the part and frequently argued with directors over his inclusion of ad-libbed lines, but he was extremely pleased when the levity of the show increased even further after the departure of Read and the hiring of Douglas Adams as script editor for season seventeen in 1979. Some fans have criticised Adams for introducing <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sort of humorous content that served him well in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. However, others consider some of Adams' scripts {{to be among the}} series' high points, with City of Death (1979) being the primary example.|$|E

25|$|Tory {{propaganda}} {{was built}} in part on a foundation of anti-Dutch and anti-Habsburg xenophobia, but Britain was being drained of its resources, and many thought the country had borne <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> burden pursuing their allies' interests while being denied any advantage for itself. Domestically, Oxford had {{the backing of the}} Queen, the war-weary public, the House of Commons; support from the House of Lords was secured by the expedient of the Queen creating 12 new Tory peers. Nevertheless, the Whigs and some Tory Lords refused to accept the possibility of Philip V remaining in Spain, and persisted in supporting the Habsburg bloc as a counterbalance to powerful France. To others, Charles VI's succession as Holy Roman Emperor and inheritor of the Habsburg lands meant supporting his claim to the Spanish succession had long ceased to be politically desirable. The danger of too much power accumulating to Austria had convinced many, including Daniel Defoe, the chief Whig propagandist, to re-think Grand Strategy.|$|E
25|$|With {{the capture}} of Bergen op Zoom, the French now had control of {{the entire length of}} the river Scheldt. The defeat caused a rift between the Dutch and British governments. It now dawned on the British that they had demanded <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{military}} capability of the Dutch Republic and that its ability to resist the French had been exhausted. The Dutch on the other hand were furious about the fact that her allies were unwilling to relieve the city. The city was key to opening up the Dutch Republic and Hanover to a potential French invasion. Lowendal was made a Marshal of France for his exploit and the French now controlled the length of the Scheldt river. Along with the defeat at Lauffeld, the defeat at Bergen op Zoom forced the British to re-enter negotiations, and to take seriously the ongoing talks at the Congress of Breda, leading to a treaty in 1748.|$|E
25|$|In {{numerous}} {{cases in}} both the 1794 print and the 1795 print, {{it seems as if}} the acid has eaten away <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relief, and Blake has had to go over sections with ink and wash, often touching the text and design outlines with pen. This ink and wash work may have been executed in 1818, along with the addition of the frame lines, although this cannot be ascertained for certain. Several of the plates also bear evidence of rudimentary colour printing, a method with which Blake was experimenting in the 1790s, and these plates may represent his first attempts at this technique (whereby he used coloured inks to print rather than black). Several of the plates also feature examples of white line engraving, a technique where Blake would literally cut into the stop-out to create tiny furrows, which would be eaten away by the acid, creating a streak effect in the final print.|$|E
