5|$|It {{was long}} assumed that Vulcanodon lived during the {{lowermost}} (earliest) {{part of the}} Jurassic (the Hettangian stage) or at the Triassic-Jurassic boundary, approximately 200 million years ago. Therefore, it was regarded as the earliest sauropod known, until {{the discovery of the}} even older Late Triassic Isanosaurus was announced in 2000. Adam Yates (2004) has recently shown that Vulcanodon is actually much younger than previously thought, dating to the uppermost (latest) part of the Lower Jurassic during the <b>Toarcian</b> <b>stage,</b> approximately 175–183 million years ago. – thus, it is contemporary to the closely related Tazoudasaurus. Although the locality of Vulcanodon itself cannot be dated radiometrically because of weathering of the lavas, it would roughly be a contemporary to Karoo lavas from other localities, as the entire sequence of volcanic eruptions was finished within one million years.|$|E

50|$|Neolioceratoides is genus of ammonites {{that lived}} during the Pliensbachian and <b>Toarcian</b> <b>stages</b> of early Jurassic. It has been {{considered}} to be a synonym of Lioceratoides, but cladistic analysis has shown, that this genus is not only valid, but they even belong to different subfamily, as Lioceratoides belongs to Harpoceratinae. Their fossils were found in Europe and northern Africa.|$|R

5000|$|In 1933, Max Littlesalt, a Navajo Indian, {{discovered}} Segisaurus in Tsegi Canyon of the Navajo Sandstone Formation, of Coconino County, Arizona. The specimen {{was found}} in calcareous sandstone, which was deposited during the Pliensbachian - <b>Toarcian</b> <b>stages</b> of the Jurassic, approximately 190 to 174 million years ago. After discovering the remains, Littlesalt, who kept livestock inside the canyon, pointed out the fossils to archeologists who were on an expedition inside the canyon. Other than the first finding of Segisaurus, no other specimens have been discovered.|$|R
40|$|Five crises {{affecting}} ammonite evolution {{occurred during}} the Late Pliensbachian to Late <b>Toarcian</b> <b>stages</b> (Early Jurassic). The first two (Gibbosus and end-Spinatum zones) occurred during highly cold and regressive conditions which were followed by a global anoxic event generated during a supergreenhouse warm event (Levisoni subzone) concomitant with a worldwide transgressive event. The last two (Late Variabilis and Late Insigne zones) are related to regressive events. We present new carbon isotope data from Southern Peru that demonstrate {{that most of the}} major Toarcian crises affecting ammonite evolution can be correlated with the variations affecting the δ 13 C during that unstable period. The morphogenetic reactions of the ammonites during the five different upper Liassic critical episodes are analysed, showing how this group can be used as stress indicators...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the biggest}} mass extinctions {{took place at the}} Triassic-Jurassic Boundary. It {{affected}} both marine and terrestrial ecosystems, and caused the disappearance of many animal taxa, mostly marine ones. Its influence on floral changes has been widely discussed, with arguments offered for the sudden mass extinction of plants over vast areas, or, alternatively, for slow, less extensive changes. The aim {{of this study was to}} statistically verify changes in terrestrial plant composition during the TJB in Europe, and to examine the type and extent of these changes. Data from Polish localities, an interesting new addition to the floristic data from the TJB, were compared with those from other selected localities in Europe. The database contains 311 macroflora taxa from 106 localities (16 Polish) in 13 countries, grouped into 29 regions; and 571 microflora taxa from 105 localities (29 Polish) in 11 countries, grouped into 37 regions. The analysed data cover the period from the Anisian to the <b>Toarcian</b> <b>stages.</b> Range-based metrics for diversity dynamics were calculated to show trends in floral changes during the studied time interval, the focus being on the TJB. Due to strong disproportions in the number of localities and occurrences, the Rhaetian and the Hettangian stages were overrepresented. The warm and humid climate of those stages promoted plant diversity and led to the formation of numerous broad floodplains conducive to the preservation of remains (e. g. in coal). The patterns established by the raw data analyses were also assessed by applying a sampling standardisation procedure. Our results, based on accurate data from Poland and the rest of Europe, confirm and visualize a scenario in which there were no significant changes in terrestrial plant composition at the TJB. Hierarchical clustering suggests that local habitat conditions are the key factor in the grouping of localities with similar floristic composition, and that differences between floras are not associated with the time dimension (stages) ...|$|R

40|$|The Lower Jurassic Sub-system {{comprises}} four stages, in chronological order, the Hettangian, Sinemurian, Pliensbachian and <b>Toarcian.</b> Each <b>stage</b> is {{subdivided into}} {{a sequence of}} `standard zones' (= chronozones) and subzones - each correlated primarily {{on the basis of}} its ammonite fauna. A further increase in stratigraphical resolution is available by the use of intra-subzonal units known collectively as `horizons'. The close link between ammonites and chronostratigraphy means that faunal provincialism may determine which zonal framework, and therefore which subdivision of the Lower Jurassic, applies in different regions of Europe. Such provincialism is of minor importance in the early Jurassic (Hettangian - Lower Pliensbachian) but increases significantly in the Upper Pliensbachian and into the Toarcian where at least three ammonoid faunal provinces are distinguishable. The standard zonal schemes for each relevant faunal area are discussed here, with greatest emphasis being placed on the Northwest European Province, which is characteristic of much of northern Europe throughout most of the Early Jurassic. Intra-subzonal units have only been described in certain regions for parts of the Lower Jurassic but where recognisable these are introduced...|$|R
40|$|Jurassic radiolarians from 220 {{samples in}} Queen Charlotte Islands, B. C., Williston Lake, B. C., east-central Oregon, Baja California Sur, {{southern}} Spain, Austria, Slovenia, Turkey, Oman, Japan and Argentina were studied {{in order to}} construct global zonation for the Pliensbachian, <b>Toarcian</b> and Aalenian <b>stages.</b> Well-preserved faunas from continuous stratigraphic sections in Queen Charlotte Islands provide the most detailed record for this time interval, and all collections are tied to North American ammonite zones or assemblages. Collections from nearly all other areas lack independent dating except for early Toarcian carbon-isotope dating in Slovenia and late Aalenian ammonites in Spain. A database of 197 widely distributed updated taxonomic species was used to construct a Unitary Association (UA) zonation for the interval. A global sequence of 41 UAs was obtained for {{the top of the}} Sinemurian {{to the base of the}} Bajocian. The first and the last UAs represent the Late Sinemurian and the Early Bajocian respectively. The remaining 39 UAs were merged into nine zones (four Early Pliensbachian, one Late Pliensbachian, one Early Toarcian, one Middle-Late Toarcian, and two Aalenian) according to prominent radiolarian faunal breaks and ammonite data. The new zones are the Canutus tip pen - Katroma clara Zone (latest Sinemurian/earliest Pliensbachian); Zartus mostleri - Pseudoristola megaglobosa, Hsuum mulleri - Trillus elkhornensis and Gigi fustis - Lantus sixi zones (Early Pliensbachian); Eucyrtidiellum nagaiae - Praeparvicingula tlellensis Zone (Late Pliensbachian); Napora relica - Eucyrtidiellum disparile Zone (Early Toarcian); Elodium pessagnoi - Hexasaturnalis hexagonus Zone (Middle and Late Toarcian); Higumastra transversa - Napora nipponica Zone (early Aalenian); and Mirifusus proavus - Transhsuum hisuikyoense Zone (late Aalenian). These zones can be correlated worldwide and link previously established UA zonations for the Hettangian-Sinemurian and the Middle to Upper Jurassic. The new zonation allows high-resolution dating in the studied interval and provides a solid basis for analyzing faunal turnovers and the paleobiogeography of Jurassic radiolarians.
