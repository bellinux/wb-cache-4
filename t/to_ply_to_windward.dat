60|$|This was a {{very serious}} matter; and never before had the council a {{question}} before it which gave its members so much concern, or which so urgently called for action, as this of the course that was now {{to be taken to}} avert a danger so imminent. Not only was Juno's safety involved; but the discovery of the cove and the reef, one or both, was very likely {{to be involved in the}} issue, and the existence of the whole colony placed in extreme jeopardy. As the canoes were still more than a league from the island, Bob thought there was time to go out with the Bridget, and meet the Dido, when both boats could <b>ply</b> <b>to</b> <b>windward</b> until it was dark; after which, they might go into the reef, or come into the cove, as circumstances permitted. The governor was about to acquiesce in this suggestion, little as he liked it, when a new proposition was made, that at first seemed so strange that no one believed it could be put in execution, but to which all assented in the end.|$|R

At ten A.M. the three frigates, towed by their boats, cast anchor out of cannon-shot, near the Bufadero; whilst the other vessels <b>plied</b> <b>to</b> <b>windward,</b> [Footnote: At the time the weather was calm in the town, but a violent levante, or east wind, prevented vessels from approaching the bay, where the lee shore is very dangerous.] and disembarked about 1,200 men on the beach of Valle Seco, between {{the town and the}} valley. This party occupied the nearest hill before it could be attacked; its movements showed an intention to seize the steep rocky scarp commanding the Paso Alto--the furthest {{to the north of the}} town. [Footnote: Nelson's rough sketch, vol. ii. p. 434, shows that it had 26 guns. San Cristobal de Paso Alto commands the large ravine called by the Guanches 'Tahoide' or 'Tejode,' which is now defended by San Miguel. This is a small rockwork carrying six guns in two tiers, the upper en barbette and the lower casemated.] Thus the enemy would have been enabled to land fresh troops during the night; and, after gaining the heights and roads leading to the town, to attack us in flank as well as in front.|$|R

The thermal and mechanical properties, along with the microstresses, for a SiC/RBSN (silicon carbide fiber and reaction bonded silicon nitride matrix) composite at different fiber volume ratios and varying degrees of interfacial bond around the fiber circumference are computed.

40|$|This paper {{examined}} the scaling of transversely loaded carbon/epoxy plates by utilizing ply-level scaling, or geometrically increasing {{the thickness of}} a ply. A scale factor of l= 2 was examined in scaling from 8 <b>to</b> 16 <b>ply,</b> 16 <b>to</b> 32 <b>ply,</b> and 32 <b>to</b> 64 <b>ply</b> laminates. The laminates were loaded until a sudden drop in the recorded load occurred. The specimens were then unloaded. Force-transverse displacement data was monitored for each test. Post test inspection included measuring dent depth, delamination area as seen by xrays and cross-sectional examination. The following conclusions are drawn from this experimental study. · Static indentation measurements of maximum load, maximum deflection and delamination area were more repeatable than dent depth. · Scaled values of load and displacement from smaller specimens were greater than those from full-scale specimens. The largest differences were in scaling from 8 <b>ply</b> <b>to</b> 16 <b>ply</b> specimens, which had a 35 % larger scaled load and 11 % larger scaled displacement. 1...|$|R
