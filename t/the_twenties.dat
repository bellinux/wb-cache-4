5|$|On 28 April 1923, Bolton {{won their}} first major trophy in their third final, beating West Ham United 2–0 {{in the first}} ever Wembley FA Cup final. The match, famously known as The White Horse Final was played in front of over 127,000 supporters. Bolton's centre-forward, David Jack scored the first ever goal at Wembley Stadium. Driven by {{long-term}} players Joe Smith in attack, Ted Vizard and Billy Butler on the wings, and Jimmy Seddon in defence, they became the most successful cup side of <b>the</b> <b>twenties,</b> winning three times. Their second victory of the decade came in 1926, beating Manchester City 1–0 in front of over 91,000 spectators, and the third came in 1929 as Portsmouth were beaten 2–0 in front of nearly 93,000 fans.|$|E
5|$|Sainsbury batting scores {{dipped in}} county cricket during 1879; in nine {{appearances}} for Somerset during the year, his highest score was 39. He performed {{better with the}} ball, twice taking four wickets during an innings, against both Bedfordshire and the MCC. The following county season began more positively for Sainsbury, as he collected nine wickets in the match against Sussex at Lansdown's ground in Bath, claiming six wickets for 54runs in the second innings of the game. He claimed another eight wickets when Somerset travelled to Leicestershire, during which Sainsbury and Arnold Fothergill took five wickets each in Leicestershire's first innings, restricting the home side to 51runs. Somerset won the low-scoring contest by 85runs, Sainsbury having scored a valuable 28 during his side's first innings. Somerset's visit to Sussex saw Sainsbury continue his success against the county, {{this time with the}} bat rather than the ball. Sussex built on their 63 run first innings lead with a second innings total of 183, leaving Somerset the task of scoring 247 runs to win the match. Sainsbury scored his second century for Somerset, remaining 101 not out when Somerset reached the winning total. He was assisted by a half-century from Stephen Newton, and scores in <b>the</b> <b>twenties</b> by Bill Fowler and Frederick Smith. Later that month, his batting was once again instrumental in setting up a Somerset victory, when he top-scored with 87 as Somerset beat the MCC by an innings.|$|E

25|$|Lindy hop's {{nature as}} a {{predominantly}} social dance with its roots as a self-learned vernacular dance, combined with the comparative lack of experts, resources, and public demand in many local communities also contribute to its differences.

The two cities of Breda and Tilburg are just 20 kilometres apart, leading to an intense feeling of a cross-town rivalry, heightened by a feeling that it is city against city with local pride at stake.|$|E

25|$|Vincent Brooks, Day & Son {{was a major}} British lithographic firm {{most widely}} known for {{reproducing}} the weekly caricatures published in Vanity Fair magazine.

25|$|Early 20th century {{developments}} in Honduran {{water resources management}} were in some ways a response to an expanding export market for bananas during <b>the</b> <b>twenties.</b> The need for irrigation within Honduras' banana farming operations became important for economic development. These irrigated banana fields were located in the fertil valleys of Sula, Aguán y La Ceiba along the Atlantic coast. And today, irrigation is still {{very important for the}} agriculture sector of Honduras as it provides for internal consumption and seeks to amplify exports in non-traditional crops.|$|E
25|$|World War I brought Fairfield {{out of its}} agrarian past by {{triggering}} {{an unprecedented}} economic boom in Bridgeport, which {{was the center of}} a large munitions industry at the time. The prosperity created a housing shortage in the city, and many of the workers looked to Fairfield to build their homes. The trolley and later the automobile made the countryside accessible to these newly rich members of the middle class, who brought with them new habits, new attitudes, and new modes of dress. The prosperity lasted throughout <b>the</b> <b>twenties.</b>|$|E
60|$|The {{rest of the}} {{crossed and}} self-fertilised seeds from the two parent-plants (the same as in the last experiment) was sown on the 1st of July in four long {{parallel}} and separate rows in good soil in the open ground; so that the seedlings were not subjected to any mutual competition. The summer was wet and unfavourable for their growth. Whilst the seedlings were very small the two crossed rows had a clear advantage over the two self-fertilised rows. When fully grown <b>the</b> <b>twenty</b> tallest crossed plants and <b>the</b> <b>twenty</b> tallest self-fertilised plants were selected and measured on the 11th of November to the extremities of their leaves, as shown in Table 6/90. Of <b>the</b> <b>twenty</b> crossed plants, twelve had flowered; whilst of <b>the</b> <b>twenty</b> self-fertilised plants one alone had flowered.|$|R

25|$|During <b>the</b> <b>twenties,</b> the Nists {{also made}} a {{strategic}} decision to serve customers who had to order boxes in small lots, identifying a niche market. (Larger companies usually specialized in specific types of boxes, and required large orders to keep costs down.) The business that began in 1889, with four employees, had over a hundred people on the payroll by 1924, and had extensive business in California and Hawaii. By 1927, Northwest Daily Produce News reported Seattle Box had orders from the West Indies for butter boxes made of odorless spruce, as well as another large order from a local creamery to box premium Edam cheese.|$|E
25|$|In general, though, Machen {{thoroughly}} disliked {{work at the}} newspaper, and it {{was only}} the need to earn money for his family which kept him at it. The money came in useful, allowing him to move in 1919 to a bigger house with a garden, in St John's Wood, which became a noted location for literary gatherings attended by friends such as the painter Augustus John, D. B. Wyndham Lewis, and Jerome K. Jerome. Machen's dismissal from the Evening News in 1921 came as a relief in one sense, though it caused financial problems. Machen, however, was recognized as a great Fleet Street character by his contemporaries, and he remained in demand as an essay writer for much of <b>the</b> <b>twenties.</b>|$|E

The 1927 Athletics featured several future Hall of Fame players including veterans Ty Cobb, Zack Wheat and Eddie Collins as well as young stars like Mickey Cochrane, Lefty Grove, Al Simmons and rookie Jimmie Foxx. That team won the pennant in 1929, 1930 and 1931, beating the Chicago Cubs in the 1929 World Series (when they came from 8–0 behind in Game 4, plating a Series record ten runs {{in the seventh inning}} and winning the game, 10–8, and then from two runs down {{in the bottom of the}} ninth in Game 5 for a walk-off Series win) and easily defeating the St. Louis Cardinals in 1930. The following year, St. Louis beat the A's in seven games led by the brilliant Pepper Martin.|$|E
