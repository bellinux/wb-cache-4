5000|$|Casing of {{offshore}} oil wells {{is done with}} a set of nested steel pipes, cemented to the rock walls of the borehole as in Figure 4. Each section is suspended by a <b>threaded</b> <b>adapter</b> inside the bottom end of the section above. [...] Failure of either the casings or the cement can lead to injection of oil into groundwater layers, flow to the surface far from the well, or a blowout at the wellhead.|$|E
5000|$|The SM58 is unswitched, {{while the}} {{otherwise}} identical SM58S model has an on-off {{switch on the}} body. Other variants refer to the accessory kits supplied with the microphone: -LC models are without a cable, -E models include a 5/8" [...] screw <b>thread</b> <b>adapter</b> for the stand mounting clip.|$|R
50|$|The P22 can be {{purchased}} with a 3.4-inch short barrel (pictured to the right), or with a 5-inch barrel which includes a barrel mounted weight compensator matching {{the profile of the}} slide. All P22's except the P22 CA come with an internally threaded barrel which allows the attachment of a sound suppressor or silencer with a separate <b>thread</b> <b>adapter</b> available from Walther. The P22 CA variant specifically excludes this capability to comply with California law.|$|R
50|$|Fujifilm {{made two}} {{conversion}} lens kits available, a 1.50x tele conversion lens and a 0.79x wide-angle conversion lens, {{both of which}} come with a 55 mm <b>thread</b> diameter <b>adapter</b> extension tube.|$|R
50|$|The 950, {{like all}} 9xx series Coolpix cameras, are still used as {{inexpensive}} microscopy cameras, {{primarily due to}} the exceptional macro capabilities. 28 mm <b>threaded</b> eyepiece <b>adapters</b> for popular commercial microscopes are widely available.|$|R
50|$|DK Bicycles {{introduced}} the Dual Drive hub {{back in the}} early 2000s which is a BMX Left/Right drive flip flop hub with the smaller sized metric (30 mm x 1 mm) BMX threads for 13T-15T freewheels, but also includes two <b>threaded</b> <b>adapters,</b> one left and one right, threaded inside to match the smaller metric threads and threaded on the outside with standard ISO threads. This allows the hub to use any size or combination of left and right drive freewheels available. Other companies like Wethepeople also made these dual-threaded metric hubs for a short time before cassette hubs enabled the use of much smaller rear cogs.|$|R
50|$|In {{appearance}} the A-5 {{was modeled}} after the H&K MP5K but can be modified {{to look like a}} number of different real world firearms. It {{is one of the most}} customizable markers on the market, with many different cosmetic and performance parts. The Tippmann A5 could easily accept standard ASA expansion chambers and regulators allowing easier performance upgrades, unlike the later X-7. Departing from previous Tippmann bodies, the A-5s hammer is completely enclosed within the clam-shell, using a separate overhead cocking mechanism. The body also incorporates a removable barrel <b>thread</b> <b>adapter,</b> allowing the marker to change its barrel threads to any major type (Spyder and Autococker being the most common).|$|R
50|$|The {{standard}} Presta valve has {{an external}} <b>thread.</b> An <b>adapter</b> can be fitted onto this external thread {{to permit the}} Presta valve {{to be connected to}} a pump with a Schrader chuck. The same adapter, because of a coincidence of thread sizes, may be able to convert a Schrader pump into one that can connect to flexible adapters of either kind.|$|R
50|$|Simple BFAs {{for these}} {{firearms}} {{consist of a}} metal plug with screw <b>threads.</b> The <b>adapter</b> {{is attached to the}} muzzle of the firearm, and may attach to or replace the muzzle brake if there is one. A means is provided to allow some of the powder gases to escape. This can be adjustable, allowing it to regulate the amount of pressure used to rechamber the next round.|$|R
5000|$|The M-61 is a Finnish {{gas mask}} {{manufactured}} by Nokia since the 1960s {{up to the}} 1980s. It was the standard issue gas mask for the Finnish Defense Forces, but {{was replaced by the}} updated M-95 in the 1990s. It is a side loading mask (meaning the filter attaches to the side) It uses 60 millimeter <b>threads,</b> but <b>adapters</b> are available to convert it to 40 millimeter threads.|$|R
50|$|The {{importance}} of greenhouses in Delhi Township was even {{reflected in the}} equipment of the Delhi Township Fire Department; as late as 1986, small-diameter fire attack lines were equipped with iron pipe couplings (rather than otherwise ubiquitous National Standard threads) {{in order to be}} compatible with the fittings in use on most greenhouse irrigation standpipes of the time. This arrangement permitted firefighters to connect their hoses to the source of water closest to an interior greenhouse fire, eliminating the need to drag (potentially) hundreds of feet of heavy, charged hose connected at the fire apparatus's pump panel outside. In this arrangement, water pressure in the involved greenhouse was boosted by a connection from the pumper to a standpipe connection {{on the outside of the}} structure. The requirement to carry a large variety of <b>thread</b> <b>adapters</b> (in order to be compatible with nearby, mutual aid departments), along with the rapid, penultimate decline of hothouse agriculture in Delhi Township led to the complete standardization to National Standard-threaded couplings within the department by the late 1980s.|$|R
50|$|An add-on bidet {{typically}} {{connects to}} the existing water supply of a toilet via {{the addition of a}} <b>threaded</b> tee pipe <b>adapter,</b> and requires no soldering or other plumbing work. Electronic add-on bidets also require a GFCI protected grounded electrical outlet.|$|R
2500|$|Practically, {{in modern}} {{milliliter}} to liter-scale laboratory operations involving condensers, pieces of apparatus are often held together tightly by complementary, tapered [...] "inner" [...] and [...] "outer" [...] "joints" [...] ground to produce very tight fits (augmented as necessary by PTFE rings or sleeves), or uniquely formulated greases or waxes; increasingly, {{other means of}} joint glass, such as <b>threaded</b> fittings with <b>adapters,</b> are used (some of which are also used across the range of process scales.|$|R
5000|$|Guido Storz {{patented}} his {{coupling in}} Switzerland in 1890, and {{it soon became}} a standard for fire hydrants throughout much of Europe â€” but it took nearly one hundred years before the main larger [...] "steamer ports" [...] on fire hydrants started to be converted to the Storz coupling in the United States. U.S. fire engines typically carry LDH (large diameter hose) with Storz couplings on both ends for connections between fire hydrants and pumps. However, if a hydrant usually has <b>threaded</b> couplings, an <b>adapter</b> is required to use with Storz. All major U.S. hydrant manufacturers now offer Storz couplings as original equipment on their hydrants, {{to connect with the}} Storz couplings used by firefighters. Hydrants may also be retro-fitted from thread to Storz to aid interoperability between firefighting organizations.|$|R
