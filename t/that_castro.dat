5|$|In 1977 the Ethio-Somali War {{broke out}} over the disputed Ogaden region as Somalia invaded Ethiopia; {{although}} a former ally of Somali President Siad Barre, Castro had warned him against such action, and Cuba sided with Mengistu Haile Mariam's Marxist government of Ethiopia. He sent troops {{under the command of}} General Arnaldo Ochoa to aid the overwhelmed Ethiopian army. After forcing back the Somalis, Mengistu then ordered the Ethiopians to suppress the Eritrean People's Liberation Front, a measure Castro refused to support. Castro extended support to Latin American revolutionary movements, namely the Sandinista National Liberation Front in its overthrow of the Nicaraguan rightist government of Anastasio Somoza Debayle in July 1979. Castro's critics accused the government of wasting Cuban lives in these military endeavors; the anti-Castro Center for a Free Cuba has claimed that an estimated 14,000 Cubans were killed in foreign Cuban military actions. When U.S. state critics claimed <b>that</b> <b>Castro</b> had no right to interfere in these nations, he countered that Cuba had been invited into them, pointing out the U.S.' own involvement in various foreign nations.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. {{realized}} that Batista {{would lose the}} war, and fearing <b>that</b> <b>Castro</b> would displace U.S. interests with socialist reforms, decided to aid Batista's removal by supporting a rightist military junta, believing that General Cantillo, then commanding most of the country's armed forces, should lead it. After being approached with this proposal, Cantillo secretly met with Castro, agreeing that the two would call a ceasefire, following which Batista would be apprehended and tried as a war criminal. Double-crossing Castro, Cantillo warned Batista of the revolutionary's intentions. Wishing to avoid a tribunal, Batista resigned on 31 December 1958, informing the armed forces that they were now under Cantillo's control. With his family and closest advisers, Batista fled into exile to the Dominican Republic with over US$ 300,000,000. Cantillo then entered Havana's Presidential Palace, proclaimed the Supreme Court judge Carlos Piedra as the new President, and began appointing new members of the government.|$|E
25|$|January 16 – Spanish paper El País {{states in}} a large article <b>that</b> <b>Castro</b> is in {{critical}} condition after three operations and <b>that</b> <b>Castro</b> is now fed through an infusion.

25|$|A {{small group}} of shareholders, {{supposedly}} all members of a Caracas Country Club, joined with the Banco Provincial, the powerful industrial group Grupo Polar and Finalven opposing the Banco Consolidado of José Alvarez Stelling, the Grupo Progreso Latinoamericano of Orlando Castro and the Grupo del Banco Unión. According to an unnamed {{member of the board}} of the Banco de Venezuela, Halvorssen was contracted to prevent at all cost <b>that</b> <b>Castro</b> would become the major shareholder and would control the bank. Halvorssen concluded <b>that</b> <b>Castro</b> Llanes was laundering drug money and was involved in other financial irregularities and handed over the material to allies in the Congress who had parliamentary immunity. Castro's adversaries started a media campaign to discredit him.|$|E
25|$|November 6 – Cuban foreign minister, Felipe Perez Roque, {{backed away}} from his earlier {{prediction}} <b>that</b> <b>Castro</b> would return to power in early December, further fueling speculation that Castro's health is much worse than Cuban government officials are saying.|$|E
25|$|Some have {{suggested}} <b>that</b> <b>Castro</b> {{had decided to}} retaliate for the attempts on his life, and that perhaps he was behind the assassination of JFK. According to the Church Committee: Book V, Drew Pearson, {{a writer for the}} Washington Post, met with Chief Justice Earl Warren in January 1967. The columnist passed along information to Warren that a client of one of his Washington lawyer friends had told his friend <b>that</b> <b>Castro</b> had plans to retaliate. Pearson asked Warren to meet with the lawyer, but Warren never did. However, Warren did inform the director of the Secret Service, James Rowley. Rowley passed the information on to Hoover, who in turn sent six secret letters to senior Bureau officials. There are no records of these conversations, and officials have adamantly denied that conversations about Castro's revenge plans ever took place. The FBI's final word on the matter was that they had not found evidence suggesting that Lee Harvey Oswald had links to the Cuban government. They never informed the new administration of these talks.|$|E
25|$|In the 1950s, various organizations, {{including}} some advocating armed uprising, competed for public support {{in bringing about}} political change. In 1956, Fidel Castro and about 80 supporters landed from the yacht Granma {{in an attempt to}} start a rebellion against the Batista government. It was not until 1958 <b>that</b> <b>Castro's</b> July 26th Movement emerged as the leading revolutionary group.|$|R

25|$|December 24 – while Cuba {{continues}} to deny U.S.-made claims <b>that</b> <b>Castro</b> {{is suffering from}} a terminal cancer, on December 24, 2006, Spanish newspaper El Periódico de Catalunya reported that Spanish surgeon José Luis García Sabrido has been flown to Cuba on a plane chartered by the Cuban government. Dr. García Sabrido is an intestinal expert who further specializes {{in the treatment of}} cancer. The plane that Dr. García Sabrido's traveled in also was reported to be carrying a large quantity of advanced medical equipment.|$|E
25|$|It {{was after}} the Cuban Revolution of 1959, <b>that</b> <b>Castro</b> forged strong {{economic}} links with the Soviet Union, with whom, at the time, the United States was engaged in the Cold War. US President Dwight D. Eisenhower was very concerned at the direction Castro's government was taking, and in March 1960, he allocated $13.1 million to the CIA to plan Castro's overthrow (though the plan to overthrow Castro was put off for Kennedy to decide). The CIA proceeded to organize the operation {{with the aid of}} various Cuban counter-revolutionary forces, training Brigade 2506 in Guatemala. Eisenhower's successor, John F. Kennedy, approved the final invasion plan on 4 April 1961.|$|E
25|$|Schlesinger, a {{historian}} and adviser to Kennedy, told National Public Radio {{in an interview}} on October 16, 2002 <b>that</b> <b>Castro</b> did not want the missiles, but Khrushchev pressured Castro to accept them. Castro was not completely happy with the idea, but the Cuban National Directorate of the Revolution accepted them, both to protect Cuba against US attack and to aid the Soviet Union. Schlesinger believed that when the missiles were withdrawn, Castro was more angry with Khrushchev than with Kennedy because Khrushchev had not consulted Castro before deciding to remove them. Although Castro was infuriated by Khrushchev, he planned on striking the US with remaining missiles if an invasion of the island occurred.|$|E
5000|$|But Castro's {{photography}} transcends run-of-the-mill BDSM imagery. Writer Mark Christopher Harvey notes <b>that</b> <b>Castro's</b> photography [...] "can {{be viewed}} as a long form of meditation—not only on the aesthetic virtues of bondage but also on the psyche of sex itself..." [...] Harvey points to the [...] "wry humor" [...] that is often missing in more commercially inspired or less artistic BDSM photographs.|$|R

Prime Minister Charles Michel {{suggested}} <b>that</b> <b>Castro's</b> death {{marked a}} historic moment as [...] "a definite {{end to the}} Cold War which divided populations to such a great extent last century."

50|$|In February 1960 Khrushchev {{sent his}} deputy Anastas Mikoyan to Cuba to {{discover}} what motivated Castro following Castro's failed trip to Washington where he was refused a meeting with President Dwight D. Eisenhower. According to reports, Khrushchev's aides had initially tried to characterize Castro as an untrustworthy American agent. Mikoyan returned from Cuba with the opinion <b>that</b> <b>Castro's</b> new administration should be helped economically and politically. Though there was no talk yet of military assistance.|$|R
25|$|Castro made {{threats to}} {{overthrow}} Trujillo, and Trujillo responded {{by increasing the}} budget for national defense. A foreign legion formed to defend Haiti, as many expected <b>that</b> <b>Castro</b> might invade the Haitian {{part of the island}} first and remove François Duvalier as well. On June 14, 1959, a Cuban plane with 56 fighting men landed near Constanza, Dominican Republic, only to be immediately wiped out. Six days later, 140 more invaders in 2 yachts were intercepted by the Dominican navy and sunk. Trujillo ordered his son, Ramfis, to lead the hunt for the invaders, and soon they were captured. The leaders of the invasion were taken aboard a Dominican Air Force plane and then pushed out in mid-air, falling to their deaths.|$|E
25|$|La Madrid learned <b>that</b> <b>Castro,</b> {{aware of}} the route and {{movements}} of the Dragoons due to his local informers, had ordered a company to mount an ambush on the outpost of Tambo Nuevo, a mountain pass 25km north of Yocalla. On {{the night of the}} 24th, La Madrid and his men climbed a hill behind the outpost. Three soldiers, acting as scouts, were the first to reach the enemy position. They found a stable of adobe sheltering at least 50 horses, and another building guarded by a sentry. After overpowering the surprised soldier, they broke into the building where they found another ten men sleeping. All of them were initially taken prisoners, but later a royalist sergeant managed to escape and gave the alarm. The rest of the company, suspecting that the republican forces outnumbered them, remained inside another building until dawn. There was a sporadic exchange of fire. At first light, La Madrid fell back to Macha with the ten captives. The three soldiers were promoted to sergeants by Belgrano, with the title of Sargentos de Tambo Nuevo.|$|E
25|$|Anastas Mikoyan was {{tasked with}} the {{negotiations}} with Castro over the missile transfer deal {{that was designed}} to prevent a breakdown in the relations between Cuba and the Soviet Union. While in Havana, Mikoyan witnessed the mood swings and paranoia of Castro, who was convinced that Moscow had made the agreement with the US at the expense of Cuba's defense. Mikoyan, on his own initiative, decided <b>that</b> <b>Castro</b> and his military not be given control of weapons with an explosive force equal to 100 Hiroshima-sized bombs under any circumstances. He defused the seemingly intractable situation, which risked re-escalating the crisis, on November 22, 1962. During a tense, four-hour meeting, Mikoyan convinced Castro that despite Moscow's desire to help, it would be in breach of an unpublished Soviet law, which did not actually exist, to transfer the missiles permanently into Cuban hands and provide them with an independent nuclear deterrent. Castro was forced to give way and, much to the relief of Khrushchev {{and the rest of the}} Soviet government, the tactical nuclear weapons were crated and returned by sea to the Soviet Union during December 1962.|$|E

50|$|Even if the {{operation}} had initially succeeded, {{the idea that}} this paramilitary battalion would have melted into the jungles and mountains to spawn a general uprising against Castro is fatuous. CIA's own analysts judged <b>that</b> <b>Castro's</b> popular support was strong and that he controlled the army and the security services. Even if the group had secured the beachhead, its members eventually would have been hunted down. The supposed leak {{had nothing to do with}} historical reality.|$|R

500|$|While {{various sources}} state <b>that</b> <b>Castro</b> didn't enrich himself, instead {{living a life}} more modest than most Latin American presidents, his former {{bodyguard}} Juan Reinaldo Sánchez alleged <b>that</b> <b>Castro</b> lived in great luxury, with several houses and yachts that he had hidden from the Cuban populace. In 2006, Forbes estimated his personal net worth at $900 million. According to Spanish newspaper El País, the house of Fidel Castro [...] "is comfortable and functional, but not luxurious".|$|E
500|$|Biographer Leycester Coltman {{described}} Castro as [...] "fiercely hard-working, dedicated loyal... {{generous and}} magnanimous" [...] but {{noted that he}} could be [...] "vindictive and unforgiving". He asserted <b>that</b> <b>Castro</b> [...] "always had a keen sense of humor and could laugh at himself" [...] but could equally be [...] "a bad loser" [...] who would act with [...] "ferocious rage if he thought that he was being humiliated". Castro was well known for throwing tantrums, and could make [...] "snap judgements" [...] which he refused to back down from. Biographer Peter Bourne noted <b>that</b> <b>Castro</b> [...] "suffers fools poorly" [...] and that in his younger years he was intolerant of those who did not share his views. He claimed <b>that</b> <b>Castro</b> liked to meet with ordinary citizens, both in Cuba and abroad, but took a particularly paternal attitude toward Cubans, treating them as if [...] "they were a part of his own giant family". British historian Alex Von Tunzelmann commented that [...] "though ruthless, [...] was a patriot, a man with a profound sense that it was his mission to save the Cuban people". Balfour described Castro as having a [...] "voracity for knowledge" [...] an [...] "elephantine memory" [...] that allowed him to speak for hours on a variety of different subjects.|$|E
500|$|Castro {{publicly}} {{rejected the}} [...] "dictator" [...] label, stating that he constitutionally held less power than most {{heads of state}} and insisting that his regime allowed for greater democratic involvement in policy making than Western liberal democracies. Nevertheless, critics claim <b>that</b> <b>Castro</b> wielded significant unofficial influence aside from his official duties. Quirk stated <b>that</b> <b>Castro</b> wielded [...] "absolute power" [...] in Cuba, albeit not in a legal or constitutional manner, while Bourne claimed that power in Cuba was [...] "completely invested" [...] in Castro, adding {{that it was very}} rare for [...] "a country and a people" [...] to have been so completely dominated by [...] "the personality of one man". Balfour stated that Castro's [...] "moral and political hegemony" [...] within Cuba diminished the opportunities for democratic debate and decision making. Describing Castro as a [...] "totalitarian dictator", Sondrol suggested that in leading [...] "a political system largely [...] his own creation and bearing his indelible stamp", Castro's leadership style warranted comparisons with totalitarian leaders like Mao Zedong, Hideki Tojo, Joseph Stalin, Adolf Hitler, and Benito Mussolini.|$|E
25|$|On August 5, 2006, the Brazilian {{newspaper}} Folha de S.Paulo {{reported that}} Cuban authorities had informed Brazilian president Lula da Silva <b>that</b> <b>Castro's</b> health was {{much worse than}} what the Cuban government had previously admitted in public. According to the report, Castro is actually suffering from intestinal cancer and {{will be unable to}} resume control of the Cuban state. The Brazilian government quickly denied that the report was accurate. Folhas editors responded to the government's denials by saying their sources were aides to the president.|$|R
5000|$|Former President Lula da Silva {{published}} an article on his personal website where he praised Castro as [...] "the greatest of all Latin-Americans" [...] and called him [...] "a friend and a comrade."

500|$|During {{her career}} as a {{passenger}} liner, Saratoga carried some notable passengers between New York and Caribbean ports. Mario García Menocal sailed from Havana to New York for [...] "personal business" [...] after having lost the Cuban presidential election in 1908. In 1913, Cipriano Castro, the former President of Venezuela (1899–1909), sailed to Havana for his health in 1913. A report in The New York Times speculated <b>that</b> <b>Castro</b> was going to meet with associates and [...] "professional revolutionaries" [...] in Havana in an attempt to regain power in Venezuela (which never occurred). In February 1914, Cardinal Farley, the Archbishop of New York from 1902 to 1918, sailed on Saratoga for a trip to The Bahamas.|$|E
500|$|Cuban state {{television}} announced <b>that</b> <b>Castro</b> had {{died on the}} night of November 25, 2016. The cause of death was not disclosed. His brother, President Raúl Castro, confirmed the news in a brief speech: [...] "The {{commander in chief of the}} Cuban revolution died at 22:29 [...] this evening." [...] His death came 9 months after his older brother Ramón died at the age of 91 in February. Fidel Castro was cremated on November 26, 2016. A funeral procession travelled 900 kilometres along the island's central highway, tracing in reverse, the route of the [...] "Freedom Caravan" [...] of January 1959, and after nine days of public mourning, his ashes were entombed in the Santa Ifigenia Cemetery in Santiago de Cuba.|$|E
500|$|In the song, Bono {{included}} the lyric: [...] "Jara sang, his song {{a weapon in}} the hands of love / You know his blood still cries from the ground". This refers to the Chilean political activist and folk singer Víctor Jara, who became a symbol of the resistance against the Augusto Pinochet military dictatorship after he was tortured and killed during the 1973 Chilean coup d'état. Bono learned of Jara after meeting René Castro, a Chilean mural artist, while on Amnesty International's A Conspiracy of Hope tour. Castro had been tortured and held in a concentration camp for two years by the military because his artwork criticised the Pinochet-led regime that had seized power in 1973 during the coup. While purchasing a silkscreen of Martin Luther King, Jr. <b>that</b> <b>Castro</b> had created, Bono noticed a print of Jara. He became more familiar with him after reading Una Canción Truncada (An Unfinished Song), written by Jara's widow Joan Turner.|$|E

50|$|Good as it is, Castro's {{photography}} also stands {{squarely in}} the quasi-religious tradition of most BDSM photography. The art historian and critic Edward Lucie-Smith has pointed out <b>that</b> <b>Castro's</b> work is deeply rooted in religious art, especially Catholic art of the Baroque period. The believer, suffering for his beliefs, is mimicked by the gay man, suffering for his homosexuality. The ecstasy of martyrdom is mimicked by the ecstasy of sex. These themes were explored by the great Christian Baroque painters, and Castro's bondage photography—like most bondage photography—draws heavily on these paintings for its poses.|$|R
5000|$|... Prime Minister Dr. Keith Rowley {{expressed}} his condolences and said <b>that</b> <b>Castro's</b> death {{marked the end}} [...] "of an iconic period of history {{not only for the}} Caribbean and Latin American region, but also for the world."
