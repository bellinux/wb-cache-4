5|$|After Lee's death, {{his wife}} Emma {{continued}} {{to operate the}} ferry for two years, in 1878 establishing an alternative ferry route below {{the confluence of the}} Paria River that allowed travelers to avoid <b>the</b> <b>infamous</b> Lee's Backbone segment.

This is a parody of <b>the</b> <b>infamous</b> and controversial Daisy ad used by Lyndon B. Johnson in the 1964 United States presidential election.|$|E
