2500|$|Homosexuality is {{addressed}} in Catholic moral theology under two forms: homosexual orientation {{is considered an}} [...] "objective disorder" [...] because Catholicism views it as being [...] "ordered toward an intrinsic moral evil", but not sinful unless acted upon. Homosexual sexual activity, by contrast, {{is viewed as a}} [...] "moral disorder" [...] and [...] "homosexual acts" [...] are viewed as [...] "contrary to the natural law. They close the sexual act to <b>the</b> <b>gift</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> They do not proceed from a genuine affective and sexual complementarity." ...|$|E

The 20th torch, representing the 20th century and called the Unity Torch, is revealed when the Globe blossoms into a Lotus Flower, and the Unity Torch rises from its center. The Unity Torch represents the world coming together to celebrate <b>the</b> <b>gift</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> and the land that we have been granted as a whole. [...] The torches also symbolize the significance of fire to humanity as an element that unites cultures over time, as well as its significance to the Earth, as is alluded to in the show's prologue.|$|E
2500|$|Organ gifting entails two {{simultaneous}} gifts: {{the gift}} of the organ itself and <b>the</b> <b>gift</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> The first form of gift is a transaction where the giver provides an object to the receiver. [...] This action leads {{to the creation of a}} relationship among individuals where the receiver is compelled to provide a counter-gift. The obligation to return the gift has received various interpretations, but one common assumption is that the object that is given tends to keep a portion of the identity of the giver (hau used by Mauss). In the case of organ gifting, this personalization of the gifted object reaches extreme proportions because the gift is actually a piece of the giver's body.|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Phinehas in {{the name}} of Rabbi Reuben {{interpreted}} the words [...] "If your brother grows poor [...] [...] [...] then shall his kinsman [...] [...] [...] redeem" [...] in [...] to exhort Israel to acts of charity. Rabbi Phinehas taught that God will reward with life anyone who gives a coin to a poor person, for the donor could be giving not just a coin, but life. Rabbi Phinehas explained that if a loaf costs ten coins, and a poor person has but nine, then the gift of a single coin allows the poor person to buy the loaf, eat, and become refreshed. Thus, Rabbi Phinehas taught, when illness strikes the donor, and the donor's soul presses to leave the donor's body, God will return <b>the</b> <b>gift</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> Similarly, Rav Nahman taught that [...] exhorts Israel to acts of charity, because fortune revolves like a wheel in the world, sometimes leaving one poor and sometimes well off. And similarly, Rabbi Tanhum son of Rabbi Hiyya taught that [...] exhorts Israel to acts of charity, because God made the poor as well as the rich, so that they might benefit each other; the rich one benefiting the poor one with charity, and the poor one benefiting the rich one by affording the rich one the opportunity to do good. Bearing this in mind, when Rabbi Tanhum's mother went to buy him a pound of meat, she would buy him two pounds, one for him and one for the poor.|$|E

2500|$|The Roman Catholic Church defines {{marriage}} as a covenant [...] "by which {{a man and a}} woman establish between themselves a partnership of the whole of life and which is ordered by its nature to the good of the spouses and the procreation and education of offspring." [...] The church teaches that [...] "homosexual acts are intrinsically disordered. They are contrary to the natural law. They close the sexual act to <b>the</b> <b>gift</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> They do not proceed from a genuine affective and sexual complementarity. Under no circumstances can they be approved." [...] Nevertheless, homosexuals [...] "must be accepted with respect, compassion, and sensitivity. Every sign of unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided." [...] Some Roman Catholics take this to mean that voting in favor of [...] "benefits for lifelong partners" [...] is a compassionate act, whereas others see voting in favor of [...] "benefits for lifelong partners" [...] as merely promoting behavior contrary to natural law. According to a 2009 survey, 59% of practicing Catholics oppose same-sex marriage, while those who are not practicing support it by 51%. Cardinal John Joseph O'Connor was an outspoken critic of homosexuality; other prominent Catholics who were outspoken critics have included John Boehner, David Vitter, Paul Ryan, Newt Gingrich, Rick Santorum, Bobby Jindal, Jeb Bush, Bob McDonnell, Marco Rubio, Michael Steele, Donald Carcieri, Sam Brownback, and Democrat Tim Kaine. Catholics Rudolph Giuliani, Chris Christie, and Bob Casey, Jr. have supported gay rights and civil unions but not same-sex marriage. [...] Liberal Catholics have generally supported repeal of sodomy laws that called for jail time for homosexuals and Employment Non-Discrimination laws that would prohibit large employers from firing workers because of sexual orientation. [...] Conservative Catholics have taken the contrary view, rejecting claims that these are examples of [...] "unjust discrimination" [...] and that because homosexual act is an intrinsic evil, it must always be opposed.|$|E
