40|$|Abstract—We {{investigate}} {{the application of}} evolutionary computation to the automatic generation of tracks for high-end racing games. The idea underlying our approach is that diversity is {{a major source of}} challenge/interest for racing tracks and, eventually, might {{play a key role in}} contributing to the player’s fun. In particular, we focus on the diversity of a track in terms of its shape (i. e., the number and the assortments of turns and straights it contains), and in terms of driving experience it provides (i. e., the range of speeds achievable while driving on the track). We define two fitness functions that capture our idea of diversity as the entropy of the <b>track’s</b> <b>curvature</b> and speed profiles. We apply both a single-objective and a multi-objective real-coded genetic algorithm to evolve tracks involving both a wide variety of turns and straights and also a large range of driving speeds. The results we report show that both single-objective and multi-objective approaches can successfully evolve tracks with a high degree of diversity both in terms of shape and achievable speeds.

40|$|For {{certain types}} of {{railroad}} lines replacing the equipment for precise train positioning along the track by suitable low-cost sensors and a digital map on the train {{can result in a}} more cost-efficient railway operation. This paper presents a modular multi-hypothesis based map-matching (MHMM) approach providing track-selective localization of the train by fusing the data of several train-borne positioning sensors. The MHMM is based on four main process steps: hypothesis generation, update, evaluation, and selection. These are periodically run through in a cycle. While previously presented contributions examined various sensor data for evaluating the different position hypotheses, especially right after passing a switch facing, this work focuses on the step of the position hypotheses update. Here, the inertial measurement unit (IMU) as the central navigation sensor is analyzed. First, its acceleration data are fused with speed observations from additional sensors, e. g. a GNSS receiver, providing precise information about the travelled distance. Then, the thus updated relative position on the track is adjusted by evaluating the <b>track’s</b> <b>curvature,</b> fusing the IMU yaw rate measurement with heading observations. Both data fusion steps are based on Kalman filters in order to calibrate the IMU. Compared to solely determining the travelled distance by an odometer or a Doppler-radar, the IMU-based hypotheses update provides a more accurate position information that builds the basis for the following hypotheses evaluation step within the MHMM. The second main benefit of the thus modified algorithm is its higher cycle frequency...|$|R

The techniques used to measure <b>track</b> <b>curvatures</b> and the positions of points inside the chambers are discussed in detail as is the analysis of the possible errors in these quantities. A formula is derived for computing the momentum of a particle from its measured curvature on the film.

A method for correcting approximately for the variation of the magnetic field along the track is also presented. A summary of the dynamics of the two-body decay of a neutral V-particle is presented. A discussion of the uses of plots of [ [...] . ] and [ [...] . ] for a two-body decay is included. The dynamics of some simple three-body decays are discussed. The distribution of the momenta of one of the decay products is derived, including only the effects of the density of states in phase space.

40|$|Real time {{curvature}} classification {{is crucial}} for all train localization problems. A reliable method to detected the track taken by the train after a switch is necessary and essential for train collision avoidance systems.

In this paper, we discuss three possible <b>track</b> <b>curvature</b> detection methods based on two accelerometers and one gyroscope. We define and analyze corresponding test statistics that determine the actual <b>track</b> <b>curvature.</b> Given system safety requirements, i. e., maximum allowable probabilities of false alert and miss-detection, we derive a minimum detectable curvature difference (MDCD) between two possible tracks and compare these values with standard curvatures used in Germany. In this paper, it is shown that these MDCDs strongly depend on the sensor quality (for which an analytical form of the Gaussian error overbound of the sensor error is derived) and on the train dynamics (velocity). This analysis shows for two detectors very promising results and suggests a possible optimal combination of their test statistics...|$|E

The X 2000 was pulled by a specially-modified XPT power car at all times, and had one on each end.

Tracking performance and adaptive changes, measured in terms of spatiotemporal error, <b>tracking</b> trajectory <b>curvature,</b> and spatial gain, were compared in 7 control subjects (CSs) and in 1 deafferented subject (DS).

50|$|Trains travel {{along the}} line at 300 km/h during the {{sections}} of the track close to Madrid. They travel at 200 km/h through the Sierra Morena region, possibly because the S/100 trains aren't pressure-sealed and this section includes many tunnels and {{also because of the}} tight curvatures in the Sierra Morena (occasionally dipping as low as 2300m). According to the HS2 website, a 200 km/h <b>track</b> needs a <b>curvature</b> of 1800m and a 400 km/h <b>track</b> needs a <b>curvature</b> of 7200m. As the necessary curvature increases in proportion to the square of the maximum velocity, the maximum safe speed for a curvature of 2300m would be 226 km/h, assuming no tilting technology: - only the AVE Class 100, AVE Class 102 and AVE Class 103 run through the Sierra Morena section, of which only the AVE Class 102 has tilting technology. The trains travel at a top speed of 250 km/h between Córdoba and Seville, possibly on account of the AVANT services that also use the line, whose trains are limited to 250 km/h. On most journeys, the trains spend a very small proportion of the journey travelling above 250 km/h, although most of the Málaga branch is done at 300 km/h (save for station approaches and the Gobantes and Abdalajís tunnels). The trains slow down to approximately 160 km/h when travelling through Ciudad Real station. They also have to slow down to 70 km/h when travelling through Puertollano station {{because of the lack of}} a bypass route and tight curvatures in the station.|$|R
