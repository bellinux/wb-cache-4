5|$|According to Hinchliffe, {{this is an}} {{incorrect}} statement. Hinchliffe based his account on Rumpelhardt's testimony who claims that Schnaufer was never taken to England. Rumpelhardt was released on 4 August 1945 and soon after Schnaufer was admitted {{to a hospital in}} Flensburg, ill with a combination of diphtheria and scarlet fever. Interrogation had begun in late May 1945 by a team of twelve officers from the Department of Air <b>Technical</b> <b>Intelligence</b> (DAT), led by Air Commodore Roderick Aeneas Chisholm. The German prisoners were brought to Eggebek. Here they conducted a number of interviews with various members of the night fighter force.|$|E
5|$|Despite their {{relatively}} smaller brains {{compared to}} other primates, lemurs have demonstrated levels of <b>technical</b> <b>intelligence</b> in problem solving that are comparable to those seen in simians. However, their social intelligence differs, often emphasizing within-group competition over cooperation, which {{may be due to}} adaptations for their unpredictable environment. Although lemurs have not been observed using objects as tools in the wild, they can be trained to use objects as tools in captivity and demonstrate a basic understanding about the functional properties of the objects they are using.|$|E
5|$|Several {{research}} organizations support NASIC, AFRL, and the Dayton community. The Advanced <b>Technical</b> <b>Intelligence</b> Center is a confederation of government, academic, {{and industry}} partners that leverage advanced <b>technical</b> <b>intelligence</b> expertise. daytaOhio is {{a non-profit organization}} based at Wright State University in Dayton, which also hosts five Ohio Centers of Excellence, {{one of which is}} the Knowledge Enabled Computing (Kno.e.sis) center, which specializes in making technical advances in computer science areas such as semantics and big data. The University of Dayton Research Institute (UDRI) is led by the University of Dayton. In 2004 and 2005, UDRI was ranked #2 in the nation by the National Science Foundation in federal and industry-funded materials research. The Cognitive Technologies Division (CTD) of Applied Research Associates, Inc., which carries out human-centered research and design, is headquartered in the Dayton suburb of Fairborn. The city of Dayton has started Tech Town, a development project to attract technology-based firms and revitalize the downtown area. Tech Town is home to the world's first RFID business incubator. The University of Dayton-led Institute for Development & Commercialization of Sensor Technologies (IDCAST) at TechTown is a world-class center for excellence in remote sensing and sensing technology. It is one of Dayton's technology business incubators housed in The Entrepreneurs Center building.|$|E

5|$|Lemurs have {{traditionally}} been regarded as being less intelligent than anthropoid primates, with monkeys and apes often described as having more cunning, guile, and deceptiveness. Many lemur species, such as sifakas and the ring-tailed lemur, have scored lower on tests designed for monkeys while performing as well as monkeys on other tests. These comparisons may not be fair since lemurs prefer to manipulate objects with their mouths (rather than their hands) and only take interest in objects when in captivity. Recent {{studies have shown that}} lemurs exhibit levels of <b>technical</b> <b>intelligence</b> on par with many other primates, although they manipulate objects less often. Tool use has not been witnessed by lemurs in the wild, although in captivity the common brown lemur and the ring-tailed lemur have been demonstrated to be able to understand and use tools.|$|E

25|$|A {{proposed}} joint U.S. Army-U.S. Navy {{research unit}} in the continental United States was never established, as neither service was prepared {{to work with the}} other.

25|$|During {{the first}} six months of the war, <b>technical</b> <b>intelligence</b> {{information}} was almost non-existent due to Air Corps units being in constant retreat and lacking sufficient personnel.

25|$|The risk to sappers is {{far greater}} because they may {{be called upon to}} perform {{clearance}} as tactics dictate, including in all-weather conditions and on schedule. Command may accept casualties in the process. Furthermore, it is accepted that mine clearance will be imperfect and there may be casualties from undiscovered mines. One advantage is that, in military operations, sappers are dealing with recently laid mines that respond predictably to clearance, have not 'migrated', and have not degraded (unless old stock was used). In this they are often aided by <b>technical</b> <b>intelligence</b> on the current adversary's mines, which are usually of a single type.|$|E

25|$|Donald Keyhoe later began {{investigating}} flying saucers for True Magazine.

Project Sign, based at Air <b>Technical</b> <b>Intelligence</b> Command at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and its successors Project Grudge and Project Blue Book were officially assigned to investigate the flying saucers. Edward Ruppelt's book The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects, reports that many people within these research groups did in fact support the hypothesis that the flying saucers were from outer space.|$|E

25|$|This {{system was}} {{deployed}} to satisfy scientific and <b>technical</b> <b>intelligence</b> collection requirements during the Cold War. The first installation (designated AN/FPS-17, XW-1) at Diyarbakir was {{originally intended to}} provide surveillance of the USSR's missile test range at Kapustin Yar south of Stalingrad - especially to detect missile launchings. The data it produced, however, exceeded surveillance requirements, permitting the derivation of missile trajectories, the identification of earth satellite launches, the calculation of a satellite's ephemeris (position and orbit), and the synthesis of booster rocket performance. The success achieved by this fixed-beam radar led to the co-location of a tracking radar (AN/FPS-79), beginning in mid-1964. Together, these radars had the capability for estimating the configuration and dimensions of satellites or missiles and observing the reentry of manned or unmanned vehicles.|$|E
25|$|The First Main Directorate (or First Chief Directorate, Russian: Первое главное управление, Pervoye glavnoye upravleniye) of the Committee for State Security of the USSR (PGU KGB) was the {{organization}} responsible for foreign operations and intelligence activities by {{providing for the}} training and management of covert agents, intelligence collection administration, and the acquisition of foreign and domestic political, scientific and <b>technical</b> <b>intelligence</b> in the Soviet Union. The First Chief Directorate was formed within the KGB directorate in 1954, and {{after the collapse of}} the Soviet Union was renamed as the Central Intelligence Service and finally the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR RF). Although the agency SVR restyle in 1991 implies a generic overseas surveillance activity, the primary foreign intelligence service in Russia and the Soviet Union has been the GRU, a military intelligence organization and special operations force shrouded in secrecy, most famed for stealing the blueprints of the atomic bomb during the Manhattan Project and barring entry into its headquarters to anyone, even the leader of the Soviet Union proper, without a formal authentication.|$|E
25|$|From the beginning, foreign {{intelligence}} {{played an important}} role in the Soviet foreign policy. In the Soviet Union, {{foreign intelligence}} was formally formed in 1920, as a foreign department of Cheka (Inostrannyj Otdiel—INO). Soviet intelligence services were formed during the Russian Civil War of 1918–1920. On December 19, 1918, the Central Committee Bureau of the Russian Communist Party (Bolshevik) had decided to combine front formations of Cheka and the Military Control Units, which were controlled by the Military Revolutionary Committee, and responsible for counter-intelligence activities, into one organ which was named Special Section (department) of Cheka. The head of the Special Section (department) was Mikhail Sergeyevich Kedrov. The task of the Special Section was to run human intelligence: to gather political and military intelligence behind enemy lines, and expose and neutralize counter-revolutionary elements in the Red Army. At the beginning of 1920, in Cheka's Special Section there was an under section named War Information Bureau (WIB) which conducted political, military, scientific and <b>technical</b> <b>intelligence</b> in surrounding countries. WIB headquarters was located in Kharkiv and was divided in two sections: Western and Southern.|$|E
