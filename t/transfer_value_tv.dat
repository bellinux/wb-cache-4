50|$|Where {{there is}} {{reference}} above to “tax-relieved funds”, this is {{interpreted by the}} Assessor of Income Tax, {{in the context of}} transfers in, to be synonymous with the value of the fund transferred in. So the 50C requirement to designate at least 70% of tax-relieved funds for pension means at least 70% of <b>transfer</b> <b>values</b> received must provide a pension. This is precisely the same requirement as that which exists under UK QROPS rules (SI 2006/206). In other words, at least 70% of the <b>transfer</b> <b>value</b> into a 50C QROPS must provide a pension for life. The remainder can therefore be paid as a retirement lump sum.|$|R

Nuggets prepared from spent hen meat showed significantly higher (p< 0. 05) moisture content however pH, fat and protein content were significantly higher (p< 0. 05) in duck nuggets. TBA <b>values,</b> <b>TVs</b> and (TPC) were highest in duck nuggets but were within the acceptable level up to 7 th day of refrigerated storage (4 ± 1 °C) in both types of nuggets. Both nuggets maintain their sensory quality up to 7 th day of refrigeration storage but spent hen nuggets were preferred by consumers compared to nuggets prepared from spent duck meat. Result of the study indicated that, despite the comparative differences among these nuggets, spent duck and hen meat could be used for preparation of nutritionally rich and acceptable nuggets...|$|R

40|$|Unit {{value or}} point <b>value</b> <b>transfers</b> from {{individual}} source studies remain {{the oldest and}} most common form of benefit transfer. Although practitioners generally recommend benefit function transfers, these are not always possible. Where unit <b>value</b> <b>transfers</b> are to be performed, appropriate protocols must be followed to select source studies, <b>transfer</b> <b>values,</b> and perform necessary value adjustments. This chapter demonstrates the processes and challenges involved in the implementation of unit <b>value</b> <b>transfers,</b> using case studies of environmental values in a peri-urban community on the east coast of Australia where key ecosystems ranged from coastal beaches to inland forests. Key issues in evaluating the potential for benefit transfer included the availability and quality of source studies, the extent of overlap between source studies and the target site, the need for different forms of adjustment to account for variations in scope and scale, and the limitations to unit <b>value</b> <b>transfers...</b>|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} {{category of}} conservation benefits are non-use (or passive) {{values that are}} time-consuming and costly to quantify using direct surveys. In the absence of estimates of these values, there will likely be an underinvestment in conservation actions that generate substantial non-use benefits, such as species and biodiversity conservation. To improve conservation investment decision making, this paper explains why, {{when and how to}} use environmental <b>value</b> <b>transfer</b> (EVT) to derive indirect estimates of non-use value while accounting for the uncertainty associated with <b>transferring</b> <b>values</b> from one site to another. Key words: environmental <b>value</b> <b>transfer,</b> uncertainty, transfer error, species conservation, non-use values...|$|R

40|$|The Indonesian National Standard SNI 03 - 6389 - 2000 {{adapted the}} 1983 Singapore’s Handbook on Energy Conservation and limited the Overall Thermal <b>Transfer</b> <b>Value</b> (OTTV) of the {{building}} envelope to 45 Watt/m 2. In 2008, the Singapore’s Building and Construction Authority (BCA) shifted to Envelope Thermal <b>Transfer</b> <b>Value</b> (ETTV) value of 50 Watt/m 2, while SNI 03 - 6389 - 2011 continues to use OTTV. This paper reviewed the new SNI 03 - 6389 - 2011 and compared it with BCA by calculating OTTV and ETTV of prismatic buildings with eight different shapes and building orientations, 11 Window to Wall Ratio, and 27 building envelope materials. This study also tested those variables {{to find the best}} building shape and orientation for an energy saver building. The result shows that ETTV (BCA) is stricter than OTTV (SNI 03 - 6389 - 2011) except the OTTV with black building envelope, while parallelogram shape building with North-South orientation is the best combination of energy saver building...|$|R
