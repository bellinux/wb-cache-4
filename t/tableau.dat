5|$|For Carlotta Grisi's {{performances}} as Giselle {{with the}} Imperial Ballet in St. Petersburg, Perrot commissioned the composer Cesare Pugni {{to score a}} new pas de cinq for the ballerina that {{was added to the}} first <b>tableau.</b> This pas was only retained for Grisi's performances and never performed again after her departure from St. Petersburg. Marius Petipa would also commission an additional piece for the first <b>tableau</b> of the ballet. This was a pas de deux from the composer Ludwig Minkus that was added to the choreographer's 1884 revival for the ballerina Maria Gorshenkova. As with Pugni's 1850 pas de cinq for Grisi, Gorshenkova's 1884 pas de deux by Minkus never became part of the performance tradition of Giselle.|$|E

This feature was a success and widely copied. Paintings inspired his work {{in a number of}} other plays. For The Golden Branch (1847) and Love and Fortune (1859), he created costumes based on the paintings of Watteau. The latter play, which was subtitled A Dramatic <b>Tableau</b> (in Watteau Colours), also included a <b>tableau</b> from Watteau's Noces de Village.|$|E
5|$|After Potter's {{death in}} December 1943, Frederick Warne & Co. granted {{licenses}} to various firms {{for the production}} of merchandise based on the Potter characters. Beswick Pottery of Longton, Staffordshire released six porcelain figurines beginning in 1965 depicting characters or scenes from the tale: Flopsy, Mrs. Tittlemouse, Benjamin Bunny, Peter Rabbit Digging, a Flopsy and Benjamin Bunny <b>tableau,</b> and a <b>tableau</b> depicting the sleeping bunnies under the lettuce. and, in 1984, Schmid & Co. of Toronto and Randolph, Massachusetts released a Flopsy Bunnies music box, a flat ceramic Flopsy Christmas ornament, and in 1985 a Flopsy music box. Stuffed toy manufacturers had sought licensing rights as early as 1906 for Potter's characters, {{but it was not until}} the 1970s that an English firm was granted worldwide rights. Their labour-intensive products were unprofitable however, and in 1972, The Eden Toy Company of New York became the exclusive manufacturer of Potter characters. Although Peter Rabbit and Mr. McGregor were released as plush toys, they were associated with the Peter Rabbit tale and not with that of The Flopsy Bunnies. None of The Flopsy Bunnies characters were released as Eden plush toys.|$|E

5|$|The first {{scientific}} {{description of}} the common thresher, as Squalus vulpinus, was written by French naturalist Pierre Joseph Bonnaterre in the 1788 <b>Tableau</b> encyclopédique et méthodique des trois règnes de la nature. In 1810, Constantine Samuel Rafinesque described Alopias macrourus from a thresher shark caught off Sicily. Later authors recognized the genus Alopias as valid while synonymizing A. macrourus with S. vulpinus, and thus the common thresher's scientific name became Alopias vulpinus.|$|E
5|$|The second {{variation}} {{was added}} by Petipa {{to the first}} <b>tableau</b> for the ballerina Emma Bessone's début as Giselle at the Mariinsky Theatre in 1886, and on this occasion the composer Riccardo Drigo wrote the music for the variation. The music was never used again after Bessone's departure from Russia until Agrippina Vaganova added it to the Peasant pas de deux for the Kirov Ballet's production of Giselle in 1932. The inclusion of this variation in the Peasant pas de deux remains part of the Mariinsky Theatre's performance tradition of Giselle to the present day.|$|E

40|$|For many {{applications}} of automated reasoning, <b>tableaux</b> methods have several advantages over theorem provers {{that do not}} generate models. A couple of such applications are briefly discussed and {{it is argued that}} they need methods that are not only refutation complete but also complete for finite satisfiability. The novel approach Extended Positive <b>Tableaux</b> is introduced which was developed for such applications. Extended Positive <b>Tableaux</b> rely on positive unit hyper-resolution and "range restriction" for avoiding the "blind instantiation" performed by the fl rule of standard <b>tableaux.</b> Instead of relying on Skolemization, as most refutation methods do, Extended Positive <b>Tableaux</b> use an extended ffi rule. This rule makes the Extended Positive <b>Tableaux</b> method complete not only for refutation, like standard <b>tableaux</b> methods, but also for finite satisfiability.

5|$|Although court {{entertainments}} {{were few}} after the Prince Consort's death, Beatrice and the Queen enjoyed <b>tableau</b> vivant photography, which was often {{performed at the}} royal residences. Henry, increasingly bored {{by the lack of}} activity at court, longed for employment, and in response, the Queen made him Governor of the Isle of Wight in 1889. However, he yearned for military adventure and pleaded with his mother-in-law to let him join the Ashanti expedition fighting in the Anglo-Asante war. Despite misgivings, the Queen consented, and Henry and Beatrice parted on 6 December 1895; they would not meet again. Henry contracted malaria and was sent home. On 22 January 1896, Beatrice, who was waiting for her husband at Madeira, received a telegram informing her of Henry's death two days earlier.|$|E
5|$|For {{much of his}} life, Rimsky-Korsakov {{combined}} his {{composition and}} teaching with {{a career in the}} Russian military—at first as an officer in the Imperial Russian Navy, then as the civilian Inspector of Naval Bands. He wrote that he developed a passion for the ocean in childhood from reading books and hearing of his older brother's exploits in the navy. This love of the sea might have influenced him to write two of his best-known orchestral works, the musical <b>tableau</b> Sadko (not to be confused with his later opera of the same name) and Scheherazade. Through his service as Inspector of Naval Bands, Rimsky-Korsakov expanded his knowledge of woodwind and brass playing, which enhanced his abilities in orchestration. He passed this knowledge to his students, and also posthumously through a textbook on orchestration that was completed by his son-in-law, Maximilian Steinberg.|$|E
5|$|In 1892 Rimsky-Korsakov {{suffered}} a second creative drought, {{brought on by}} bouts of depression and alarming physical symptoms. Rushes of blood to the head, confusion, memory loss and unpleasant obsessions led to a medical diagnosis of neurasthenia. Crises in the Rimsky-Korsakov household {{may have been a}} factor—the serious illnesses of his wife and one of his sons from diphtheria in 1890, the deaths of his mother and youngest child, as well as the onset of the prolonged, ultimately fatal illness of his second youngest child. He resigned from the Russian Symphony Concerts and the Court Chapel and considered giving up composition permanently. After making third versions of the musical <b>tableau</b> Sadko and the opera The Maid of Pskov, he closed his musical account with the past; he had left none of his major works before May Night in their original form.|$|E
40|$|We {{define a}} number of new {{combinatorial}} operations on skew semistandard domino <b>tableaux,</b> which together with constructions introduced earlier by C. Carre and B. Leclerc, define an elegant structure on the set of these <b>tableaux,</b> that closely parallels the structure defined in [math. CO/ 9908099] for ordinary skew semistandard <b>tableaux,</b> that is related to the Littlewood-Richardson rule. These operations are: (1) a bijection between semistandard domino <b>tableaux</b> and certain pairs of ordinary <b>tableaux</b> of the same weight that together fill the same shape; (2) a weight preserving transformation of domino <b>tableaux</b> to ordinary <b>tableaux</b> of a related shape (the correspondence involves 2 -quotients) with the property that Yamanouchi domino <b>tableaux</b> correspond precisely to Littlewood-Richardson tableaux; (3) a correspondence between Yamanouchi domino <b>tableaux</b> of shape λ and weight μ and Yamanouchi domino <b>tableaux</b> of shape μ' and weight λ, where μ' is μ scaled by a factor 2. The property {{at the heart of the}} structure so defined is that operations (1) and (2) commute with the coplactic operations (implicitly) defined by Carre and Leclerc. (1) elucidates their bijection analogous to that of Robinson (a. k. a. the Robinson-Schensted correspondence), while the operation of moving chains in domino <b>tableaux</b> underlying (2) is very similar to jeu de taquin.

Returning to San Francisco in 1919, Pflueger once again focused on the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, who now wished for a further doubling in size, extending their Stockton Street frontage 140 feet to California Street, and adding a seventh floor. A massive new entrance incorporating 17 Ionic columns was erected, topped by a pediment displaying a <b>tableau</b> carved by Armenian sculptor Haig Patigian. The Neoclassic-style project was completed in 1920. In 1984, the building was designated San Francisco Landmark No. 167.|$|E
5|$|The {{epaulette}} shark was originally described as Squalus ocellatus by the French naturalist Pierre Joseph Bonnaterre in the 1788 <b>Tableau</b> encyclopédique et méthodique des trois règnes de la nature. The name was later changed to the currently valid Hemiscyllium ocellatum. The type specimen was a 35cm (14in) long immature male caught near Cooktown, Queensland, Australia. Other common names for this species are the itar shark and the blind shark (also used for Brachaelurus waddi). Goto's 2002 morphological {{analysis of the}} carpet sharks showed the genus Hemiscyllium as a polytomy, meaning that the phylogenetic relationships between the {{epaulette shark}} and its sister species could not be resolved.|$|E
5|$|During {{this period}} Delius did not confine himself to purely orchestral works; he {{produced}} his final opera, Fennimore and Gerda (1908–10), like A Village Romeo and Juliet written in <b>tableau</b> form, {{but in his}} mature style. His choral works of the period, notably An Arabesque (1911) and A Song of the High Hills (1911) {{are among the most}} radical of Delius's writings in their juxtapositions of unrelated chords. The latter work, entirely wordless, contains some of the most difficult choral music in existence, according to Heseltine. After 1915, Delius turned his attention to traditional sonata, chamber and concerto forms, which he had largely left alone since his apprentice days. Of these pieces Payne highlights two: the Violin Concerto (1916), as an example of how, writing in unfamiliar genres, Delius remained stylistically true to himself; and the Cello Sonata of 1917, which, lacking the familiarity of an orchestral palate, becomes a melodic triumph. Cardus's verdict, however, is that Delius's chamber and concerto works are largely failures. After 1917, according to Payne, there was a general deterioration in {{the quantity and quality of}} Delius's output as illness took hold, although Payne exempts the incidental music to Hassan (1920–23) from condemnation, believing it to contain some of Delius's best work.|$|E

There was a comparison throughout the entirety of the first section between the three occupations and different locations throughout France. The second portion of the book included the topic of health as it relates to dangerous workplaces and the effects of low pay and overcrowding. and he is considered a founder of epidemiology.
