The {{finite difference method}} {{is used to calculate}} the time dependent temperature distribution and thermal stresses along the cylinder thickness. Furthermore, finite element analysis is performed to determine the weight function coefficients and to investigate the accuracy of the predicted stress intensity factors from the weight functions. Variation of the stress intensity factors with time and effects of the material gradation on the results are investigated, as well. It is shown that the proposed technique can be used to accurately predict transient <b>thermomechanical</b> <b>stress</b> intensity factors for functionally graded cylinders with arbitrary material gradation...|$|E

40|$|This study {{addresses}} encapsulated {{wire bonds}} in chip-on-board (CoB) multi chip modules, which provide a low cost option {{for dealing with}} the current trend towards compact microelectronic packages with increased I/O, higher reliability and lower cost. The focus is on <b>thermomechanical</b> <b>stresses</b> caused in the bond wires when the encapsulant is cooled from high curing temperatures and subsequently subjected to thermal cycling loading. The stresses generated in bond wires due to thermal expansion mismatches, in an encapsulated CoB are very complex and are driven by both global and local thermal expansion mismatches between: (i) glob-top encapsulant and the silicon die, (ii) encapsulant and the wire, and (iii) encapsulant and the substrate assembly.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this study}} we develop a {{methodology}} for mapping operational curves (pressures in the vessel versus cold leg temperature), to avoid brittle fractures under pressurized thermal shock with asymmetric refrigeration. The methodology begins by a thermal analysis of several transients with an asymmetric refrigeration of the beltline region (the fluid temperature of the vessel inner wall depends on theta and the maximum heat transference coefficient is taken for all temperatures). The thermal problem is solved by using a hybrid method of finite elements and a global base for spatial dependency. An implicit scheme of finite differences, as the Euler's, {{has been used for}} temporal dependency. Later, a stress analysis was carried out considering a quasi-stationary model. A hybrid method is used, once again, to obtain a <b>thermomechanical</b> <b>stresses</b> profile. Finally, <b>thermomechanical</b> <b>stresses</b> are post-processed to carry out the fracture mechanics analysis using the linear-elastic fracture mechanics model. Operational bounding curves (pressure versus cold leg temperature) are presented for a typical PWR.

Furthermore, a well-defined triazole mid-chain functionalized block homopolymer, i. e. polystyrene-b-polystyrene (PS-b-PS, Mn,SEC = 4. 4 kDa,= 1. 08), was synthesized via a combination of ARGET ATRP and copper(i) -catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) as a reference material.

40|$|The {{interconnection}} {{of silicon}} solar cells by soldering causes <b>thermomechanical</b> <b>stress</b> due to different coefficients of thermal {{expansion of the}} materials involved, especially copper and silicon. In contrast to the current standard interconnection technology, using three to five flat ribbons to be soldered on continuous or segmented busbars on the solar cells front side and on large contact pads on the solar cells rear side, the Multi Busbar concept uses twelve to fifteen round solder coated copper wires to be soldered on {{a large number of}} small contact pads for each polarity. In this paper we present two finite element models, one for a solar cell with a common busbar-based interconnection and a second one for a solar cell using the Multi Busbar interconnection approach to analyze and compare the distribution of the <b>thermomechanical</b> <b>stress</b> induced by the cell interconnection. The results show only a slight vertical deformation of a contacted solar cell of 0. 4 mm for the three busbar design and 2. 2 mm for the Multi Busbar interconnection technology due to the non-symmetric pad layout and the aluminum metallization on the rear side. However, most parts of the copper interconnector (ribbons and wires) are plastically deformed because the tensile stress exceeds the yield strength of 100 MPa. In addition, the results indicate that there is only slight tensile stress {{in most parts of the}} silicon solar cell after the soldering process.
