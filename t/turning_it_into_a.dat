In addition, Duyệt opposed Emperor Minh Mạng's ascension and defended Christian missionaries and converts from the emperor's isolationist and Confucian policies.

Later, Emperor Thiệu Trị, the successor of Minh Mạng, rehabilitated Duyệt and restored his tomb.|$|E

5|$|The Soviet {{occupation}} in 1940 {{led to the}} closing of the church. During World War II, services were continued, but in the spring of 1944 hooligans broke into the church and destroyed the altar with the altarpiece, the organ, the chairs and the windows. In 1946, the congregation asked the Soviet government to list the Cathedral as a protected historical monument, but it failed to raise their interest. The church was empty for years; for some time it was used for storing grain, even plans for <b>turning</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> swimming-pool were made.|$|E
5|$|After the siege, Maltese {{military}} engineer Girolamo Cassar drew up {{plans to}} reduce Mdina's size by half and <b>turning</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> fortress, {{but these were}} never implemented due to protests by the city's nobles. The city's main gate was reconstructed in the early 17th century, but the next major alterations were not made until the 1650s, when the large De Redin Bastion was built at {{the centre of the}} land front. Despite these modifications, by 1658 there were also proposals to abandon or demolish the entire fortress due to its state of disrepair, although these plans were opposed by the locals. In the late 17th century, some of Mdina's medieval double walls began to be encased in sloping ramparts.|$|E
5|$|Gia Long's {{rule was}} {{noted for its}} Confucian orthodoxy. He overcame the Tây Sơn {{rebellion}} and reinstated the classical Confucian education and civil service system. He moved the capital from Hanoi south to Huế as the country's populace had also shifted south over the preceding centuries, and built up fortresses and a palace in his new capital. Using French expertise, he modernized Vietnam's defensive capabilities. In deference to the assistance of his French friends, he tolerated the activities of Roman Catholic missionaries, something that became increasingly restricted under his successors. Under his rule, Vietnam strengthened its military dominance in Indochina, expelling Siamese forces from Cambodia and <b>turning</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> vassal state.|$|E

5|$|In 1904, Gus Mears {{acquired}} the Stamford Bridge athletics stadium {{with the aim}} of <b>turning</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> football ground. An offer to lease it to nearby Fulham was turned down, so Mears opted to found his own club to use the stadium. As there was already a team named Fulham in the borough, the name of the adjacent borough of Chelsea was chosen for the new club; names like Kensington FC, Stamford Bridge FC and London FC were also considered. Chelsea were founded on 10 March 1905 at The Rising Sun pub (now The Butcher's Hook), opposite the present-day main entrance to the ground on Fulham Road, and were elected to the Football League shortly afterwards.|$|E

Her lawyer {{asked the court to}} issue a preliminary injunction, that would forbid Pixar and Disney from releasing the film while the suit was pending.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} team {{hoped the}} new title {{would appeal to}} both newcomers and fans of the series, be accessible and introduce the franchise to a broader audience. They assumed most players would not have played the original Syndicate games. The team also considered {{that because of the}} change in audience tastes and the introduction of new video game platforms, altering the game's perspective to first-person was a correct decision. <b>Turning</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> first-person game was the first design choice made by the team, who hoped allowing players to view from the agent's perspective directly would make the game more immersive for players.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} century BC {{additional}} lines of bank and ditch were constructed <b>turning</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> multivallate hillfort which {{is now known as}} the castle. There is evidence that the fort was violently taken in around AD43 and that the defences were further slighted later in the 1st century after the construction of a Roman army barracks on the hilltop. Excavations of the southwest gate in 1968 and 1969 revealed evidence for one or more severe violent episodes, associated with weaponry and destruction by fire. Whereas the excavator, Leslie Alcock, believed this to have been dated to around AD70, Richard Tabor argues for a date associated with the initial invasion, either AD43 or 44. Michael Havinden states that it was the site of vigorous resistance by the Durotriges and Dobunni to the second Augusta Legion under the command of Vespasian.|$|E
5|$|Gia Long's {{rule was}} {{noted for its}} strict Confucian orthodoxy. Upon {{toppling}} the Tây Sơn, he repealed their reforms and reimposed a classical Confucian education and civil service system. He moved the capital from Hanoi in the north to Huế in central Vietnam to reflect the southward migration of the population over the preceding centuries. The emperor built new fortresses and a palace in his new capital. Using French expertise, Gia Long modernized Vietnam's defensive capabilities. In deference to the assistance of his French friends, he tolerated the activities of Catholic missionaries, something that was increasingly restricted by his successors. Under Gia Long's rule, Vietnam strengthened its military dominance in Indochina, expelling Siam from Cambodia and <b>turning</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> vassal.

5|$|When a {{main-sequence star}} consumes the {{hydrogen}} at its core, {{the loss of}} energy generation causes its gravitational collapse to resume. Stars with less than 0.23 , are predicted to directly become white dwarfs when energy generation by nuclear fusion of hydrogen at their core comes to a halt. In stars between this threshold and 10 , the hydrogen surrounding the helium core reaches sufficient temperature and pressure to undergo fusion, forming a hydrogen-burning shell. In consequence of this change, the outer envelope of the star expands and decreases in temperature, <b>turning</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> red giant. At this point the star is evolving off the main sequence and entering the giant branch. The path which the star now follows across the HR diagram, to the upper right of the main sequence, is called an evolutionary track.|$|E
5|$|Coloured {{seats and}} a police room {{were added to the}} Kemlyn Road stand in 1987. After the Hillsborough {{disaster}} in 1989 when Police mismanagement led to overcrowding and the deaths of 96 Liverpool fans, the Taylor Report recommended that all grounds in the country should be converted into all-seater grounds by May 1994. A second tier was added to the Kemlyn Road stand in 1992, <b>turning</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> double-decker layout. It included executive boxes and function suites as well as 11,000seating spaces. Plans to expand the stand had been made earlier, with the club buying up houses on Kemlyn Road during the 1970s, and 1980s, but had to be put on hold until 1990 because two sisters, Joan and Nora Mason, refused to sell their house. When the club reached an agreement with the sisters in 1990, the expansion plans were put into action. The stand—renamed the Centenary Stand—was officially opened on 1 September 1992 by UEFA president Lennart Johansson. The Kop was rebuilt in 1994 after the recommendations of the Taylor Report and became all seated; it is still a single tier, and the capacity was significantly reduced to 12,390.|$|E
5|$|Floodlights were {{installed}} {{at a cost}} of £12,000 in 1957. On 30 October they were switched on for the first time for a match against Everton to commemorate the 75-year anniversary of the Liverpool County Football Association. In 1963 the old Kemlyn Road stand was replaced by a cantilevered stand, built {{at a cost of}} £350,000, accommodating 6,700 spectators. Two years later alterations were made at the Anfield Road end, <b>turning</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> larger covered standing area with refreshments under the structure. The biggest redevelopment came in 1973, when the old Main Stand was partially demolished and extended backwards with new roof. Simultaneously the concrete pylon floodlights were demolished with new lights installed along the rooflines of the Kemlyn Road and Main Stands. The new stand was officially opened by the Duke of Kent on 10 March 1973. In the 1980s the paddock in front of the Main Stand was turned into seating, and in 1982 seats were introduced at the Anfield Road end. The Shankly Gates were erected in 1982, a tribute to former manager Bill Shankly; his widow Nessie unlocked {{them for the first time}} on 26 August 1982. Across the Shankly Gates are the words You'll Never Walk Alone, the title of the hit song by Gerry and the Pacemakers adopted by Liverpool fans as the club's anthem during Shankly's time as manager.|$|E

5|$|In 1776 the Marquess {{began to}} {{renovate}} the property {{with the intention of}} <b>turning</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> residence for his son, John. The grounds were radically altered under a programme of work that involved Capability Brown and his son-in-law, Henry Holland. The stone wall that separated the inner and outer baileys was destroyed using gunpowder, the Shire Hall and the knights' houses in the outer bailey were destroyed and the remaining ground partially flattened; the whole of the area was laid with turf. Considerable work was carried out on the main lodgings, demolishing the Herbert additions, building two new wings and removing many of the older features to produce a more contemporary, 18th century appearance. The keep and motte was stripped of the ivy and trees that had grown up them, and a spiral path was laid down around the motte. The motte's moat was filled in as part of the landscaping. A summer house was built in the south-east corner of the castle. Further work was planned on the property, including a reported proposal to roof the keep in copper, insert new windows and turn it into an assembly room for dances, but these projects were cut short by the Marquess's son's death in 1794.|$|E
5|$|The 7000 {{series of}} cars, {{currently}} being built by Kawasaki Heavy Industries Rolling Stock Company of Kobe, Japan are being delivered for on-site testing during winter 2013, and first entered service April 14, 2015 on the Blue Line. The new cars {{are different from}} previous models in that while still operating as married pairs, the cab in one car was eliminated, <b>turning</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> B car. The new design allows for increased passenger capacity, elimination of redundant equipment, greater energy efficiency, and lower maintenance costs. The National Transportation Safety Board investigation of the fatal June 22, 2009, accident led it {{to conclude that the}} 1000 series cars are unsafe and unable to protect passengers in a crash. As a result, on July 26, 2010, Metro voted to purchase 300 7000 series cars to replace the remaining 1000 series cars. An additional 128 7000 series cars were also ordered to serve the new Silver Line to Dulles Airport (64 for each phase). In May 2013, Metro placed another order for 100 7000 series cars, which will replace all of the 4000 series cars. On July 13, 2015, WMATA used their final option and purchased an additional 220 7000 series railcars for fleet expansion, bringing the total number of 7000 series railcars on order to 748.|$|E
5|$|The {{combination}} of agnatic kinship and the feudal system, which formalised mutual obligations {{of service and}} protection, organised through heritable jurisdictions, {{has been seen as}} creating the Highland clan system. The head of a clan was usually the eldest son of the last chief of the most powerful sept or branch. The leading families of a clan formed the fine, often seen as equivalent to Lowland lairds, providing council in peace and leadership in war, and below them were the daoine usisle (in Gaelic) or tacksmen (in Scots), who managed the clan lands and collected the rents. Most of the followers of the clan were tenants, who supplied labour to the clan heads and could be called upon to act as soldiers when needed. In the early modern era they usually took the clan name as their surname, <b>turning</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> massive, if often fictive, kin group. Economic change and the imposition of royal justice had begun to undermine the clan system before the eighteenth century, but the process was accelerated after the Jacobite rising of 1745. Highland dress was banned, clansmen were forcible disarmed, there was the compulsory purchase of heritable jurisdictions, many chiefs were exiled and ordinary clansmen were sent to the colonies as indentured labourers. Within a generation, these factors reduced most clan leaders to the status of simple landholders, without independent military power.|$|E
