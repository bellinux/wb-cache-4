500|$|After Marker saw Manson's group Angelfish on 120 Minutes, {{the band}} {{invited her to}} Vig and Marker's Smart Studios to sing {{on a couple of}} songs, but after a [...] "dreadful" [...] first audition, she {{returned}} to Angelfish. Manson eventually returned to Smart for a successful second time, where she began to work on the then-skeletal [...] "Queer", [...] "Vow" [...] and [...] "Stupid Girl". Working on the lyrics, [...] "Stupid Girl" [...] became an [...] "anthem for a girl who won't settle for less than what she wants". Later she added, [...] " [...] really about squandering potential, [...] our version of Madonna's 'Express Yourself', but a little more subversive". Manson aimed the song as a rebuke towards a friend's foolish behaviour: [...] "A lot of females still find it difficult to find their own voice in society. It's just that women have a different set of problems from men... make <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> potential." [...] Manson added that [...] "Stupid Girl" [...] was [...] "a song of reproach {{to a lot of people}} we know", both male and female, and that [...] "we could have called it 'Stupid Guy,' but we thought another song about a strident female dissing a guy would be tedious." ...|$|E

[...] It originally began as a [...] "gathering for Indigo kids" [...] but developed into a [...] "movement of Integrity, Love and Unity" [...] which is [...] "trying to be the best you can be, taking responsibility for your reality and living with your eyes open.

2500|$|The book [...] "was {{extensively}} reworked by James Goldman, with Sondheim's {{cooperation and}} also given an intermission." [...] The producer Cameron Mackintosh {{did not like}} [...] "that there was {{no change in the}} characters from beginning to end.... In the London production ... the characters come to understand each other." [...] Sondheim [...] "did not think the London script was as good as the original." [...] However, he thought that it was [...] "wonderful" [...] that, {{at the end of the}} first act, [...] "the principal characters recognized their younger selves and were able to acknowledge them throughout the last thirty minutes of the piece." [...] Sondheim wrote four new songs: [...] "Country House" [...] (replacing [...] "The Road You Didn't Take"), [...] "Loveland" [...] (replacing the song of the same title), [...] "Ah, But Underneath" [...] (replacing [...] "The Story of Lucy and Jessie", for the non-dancer Diana Rigg), and [...] "Make <b>the</b> <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>Your</b> Music" [...] (replacing [...] "Live, Laugh, Love").|$|E
