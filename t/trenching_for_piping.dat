40|$|The {{prevailing}} lack {{of proper}} and uniform seismic design guidelines <b>for</b> <b>piping</b> systems impels designers to follow standards conceived for other structures, such as buildings. The modern performance-based design approach {{is yet to}} be widely adopted <b>for</b> <b>piping</b> systems, while the allowable stress design method is still the customary practice. This paper presents a performance-based seismic analysis of petrochemical piping systems coupled with support structures through a case study. We start with a concept of performance-based analysis, followed by establishing a link between limit states and earthquake levels, exemplifying Eurocode and Italian prescriptions. A brief critical review on seismic design criteria of piping, including interactions between piping and support, is offered thereafter. Finally, to illustrate actual applications of the performance-based analysis, non-linear analyses on a realistic petrochemical piping system is performed to assess its seismic performance...|$|R
