2500|$|Birds {{frequent}} the mountains, {{some as a}} {{migratory path}} and others as native species. The migratory birds often use the area to the west as an overwintering area, and migrate north along the western slopes. In the northern canyons birds may be divided into different habitats, or more specifically, {{the different types of}} forest, leading to differences in range by altitude. Some of this difference by altitude may even extend the range of some species, enabling tropical species to use the mountain valleys for migration. Bird species endemic to the Sierra Madre Occidental include <b>tufted</b> <b>jay,</b> the [...] "gray-eared" [...] subspecies of red warbler, eared quetzal, thick-billed parrot, and formerly included the imperial woodpecker, which now may be extinct.|$|E

5000|$|In {{addition}} to his business activities, Moore was an active ornithologist who published about 60 scientific papers. From 1911-1916 Moore edited Cassinia, which is {{the journal of the}} Delaware Valley Ornithological Club. Moore moved to California around 1929, and became an associate of the Department of Zoology at the California Institute of Technology. In 1933 he hired Chester C. Lamb to help build his collection of birds; Lamb worked with Moore on the project for 22 years, collecting ~40,000 bird and mammal specimens in Mexico from 1933 until 1955. Herbert Friedmann has written that Moore's [...] "great achievement was his forming of the Moore collection, containing about 65,000 birds, over 80 percent of which are from Mexico, and 1,000 mammals, now housed in a building given by him to Occidental College in Los Angeles, with an endowment for its maintenance and for furthering studies on American birds, particularly those of Mexico and adjacent areas." [...] The Moore Laboratory of Zoology at Occidental College is still in operation half a century following Moore's death; the present director is Dr. John E. McCormack. Friedmann also particularly notes Moore's discovery of two new bird species and a genus; Moore is credited at the Integrated Taxonomic Information System with the discoveries of five bird species (the <b>tufted</b> <b>jay,</b> the masked mountain-tanager, the maroon-fronted parrot, the short-crested coquette, and the Balsas screech-owl) and thirty subspecies.|$|E
