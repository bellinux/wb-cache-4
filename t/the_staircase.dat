5|$|Surviving {{interior}} {{features include}} an early 18th-century staircase with carved tread ends decorated with scroll, flower and leaf designs. Each step has three twisted balusters, {{and there is}} a moulded hand rail. <b>The</b> <b>staircase</b> is situated in a hall with an 18th-century ceiling painting of pelicans, trumpets and swags. In the early 21st century it was planned to remove <b>the</b> <b>staircase</b> from the house entirely.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of the Castellania contains offices, court halls, a chapel and prison cells. A large allegorical statue representing Lady Justice or Astraea wearing a blindfold and holding weighing scales stands at <b>the</b> <b>staircase</b> which lead to the former courtrooms. The statue stands on a pedestal, and its sculptor is unknown. <b>The</b> <b>staircase</b> is grandiose on its own.|$|E
5|$|The {{triangular}} pediment depicts {{sculptures of}} plants and geometrical figures. <b>The</b> <b>staircase</b> has nine unusually high steps— high, about {{twice as high as}} the average height of stairs. Tananyan suggests that the unusually high stairs compel a person ascending <b>the</b> <b>staircase</b> to feel humbled and make physical effort to reach the altar. On the both sides of <b>the</b> <b>staircase</b> there are roughly square pedestals. Atlas, the Greek mythological Titan who held up the earth, is sculpted on both pedestals in a way seemingly trying to hold the entire temple on its shoulders. It is assumed that, originally, pedestals held up altars (sacrificial tables).|$|E

5|$|Ascending <b>the</b> <b>staircase</b> are bronze {{railings}} with mahogany banisters. The railings {{are decorated}} with the swastika symbol which, whilst mostly associated with Nazi Germany, has been traced {{back as far as}} the 3rd millennium B.C.E. in Asia. The stairway's newel posts, on the landing between the second and third floors, are a pair of bronze ram's heads, identical newel posts grace {{the bottom of the stairs}} as well. The second floor landing offers a view of the stained glass windows, all original, which were fully restored during the 1980s renovation. Elevator access is also located on the second floor landing, the elevator was a 1950s addition to the courthouse. Originally, to access the third floor, the only option was one of two staircases. Both staircases rose from the second floor landing to the third floor, one staircase was located to either side of the stairwell leading to the landing. When the elevator was installed <b>the</b> <b>staircase</b> on the left-hand side of the landing was removed.|$|E
5|$|Excavations {{near the}} arch resumed between 1994 and 1996, {{directed}} by Ronny Reich and Yaacov Billig. These have uncovered {{much of the}} debris from {{the collapse of the}} arch. The remains include both stairs from <b>the</b> <b>staircase</b> and stones from its rounded handrails. Some of these are still visible where they were found, at the Jerusalem Archaeological Park now occupying the site.|$|E
5|$|On {{the inside}} of the tower there are 96 steps leading to the gallery in 4 stages, the first 3 of the same grade and the last stage a bit steeper and narrower. <b>The</b> <b>staircase</b> is made of {{concrete}} with slate treads and cast iron and brass balustrade.|$|E

5|$|South of the Temple Mount, {{excavators}} {{have uncovered}} an inscribed Roman milestone bearing {{the names of}} Vespasian and Titus, fashioned from one of <b>the</b> <b>staircase</b> handrails which stood {{on top of the}} arch. This places the destruction of the arch at no later than 79CE.|$|E
5|$|St Andrews Church, a Grade II* listed {{building}} {{on the outskirts of}} Chew Stoke, was constructed in the 15th century and underwent extensive renovation in 1862. The inside of the church is decorated with 156 angels in wood and stone, and the church includes a tower with an unusual spirelet on <b>the</b> <b>staircase</b> turret. In the tower hang bells cast by the Bilbie family.|$|E
5|$|The counterfort with <b>the</b> <b>staircase</b> was roofed {{with wooden}} boards and tin sheets in 1869. A {{telegraph}} installation and rescue stations were established near the lighthouse {{in the same}} year; the first-established worked until 1898 when it {{was replaced by a}} telephone.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> King's <b>Staircase</b> (Király-lépcső), <b>the</b> Baroque main <b>staircase</b> of <b>the</b> {{southern}} wing gave {{access to}} the private apartments of Emperor Francis I. Both <b>the</b> King's <b>Staircase</b> and its northern twin, <b>the</b> Diplomat's <b>Staircase,</b> had ornate gates opening onto Lions Court, decorated with telamons. The kitchens were originally situated {{on the ground floor}} of the southern wing, but they were relocated by Hauszmann.|$|R
5|$|The main {{family living}} {{quarters}} {{are located in}} the 1752 addition. <b>The</b> <b>staircase</b> hall is the only room in the 1752 house to have kept its original, Georgian interior. The rococo plaster ceiling is attributed to Shrewsbury-born architect, Thomas Farnolls Pritchard, who also designed interiors at Tatton Hall, Powis Castle and Croft Castle. Facing the gardens, {{on the north side of}} the house, is the library. Remodelled in the early 1800s, this room was previously used by the family as a dining room. It features fitted 19th-century mahogany bookcases, decorated with small acanthus friezes. The white marble fireplace is flanked on either side by family coats of arms. Connecting the library to <b>the</b> <b>staircase</b> hall and the drawing room is the ante-room, which is furnished with pieces commissioned by the family in the late 18th century. Originally, an entrance into the hall was located in this octagonal room, until Randle Wilbraham III relocated it. The room features copies of works by Raphael, attributed to Michelangelo Maestri.|$|E
5|$|Bruce's {{new house}} was {{complete}} by 1699, and was worked on {{by many of}} the same craftsmen who were engaged by Bruce at nearby Hopetoun House, which was under construction at the same time. Craftsmen included the plasterers John McKay and Thomas Albur, cabinet maker William Scott, plumber Joseph Foster, smith Alexander Gardener, and the wright Andrew Barclay. <b>The</b> <b>staircase,</b> with its wrought-iron balustrade decorated with roses, thistles, tulips and oak leaves, bears many similarities to the one at Caroline Park, Granton, and was the work of the smiths James Storrie and James Horne.|$|E
5|$|By 1508, {{construction}} work was completed {{at the north}} of the Loggia, which contained <b>the</b> <b>staircase</b> to access the upper level of the public building. The construction is designed as a body in itself, separated from the main building by a path and connected to it by a covered overpass, a configuration that has come down to us intact. The contribution of Cairano, who at that point returned to the Loggia after at least five years of a stellar career elsewhere, is the portal to the ground floor of the annex and in some ornamentation on the overpass.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> Grand <b>Staircase</b> is <b>the</b> chief {{stairway}} {{connecting the}} State Floor and the Second Floor of the White House, the official {{home of the}} President of the United States. The stairway is primarily used for a ceremony called the Presidential Entrance March. <b>The</b> present Grand <b>Staircase,</b> <b>the</b> fourth <b>staircase</b> occupying <b>the</b> same general space, was completed in 1952 {{as a part of}} the Truman White House reconstruction. <b>The</b> Grand <b>Staircase</b> is entered on the State Floor from the Entrance Hall.|$|R

5|$|Crimea's coastal highway {{runs through}} the park, {{dividing}} it into {{the upper and lower}} portions. The upper park is dominated by the mountain springs, {{as well as by the}} native southern coast forestry and clusters of foreign tree growth. A feature of the upper park is the Fountain of Trilby, which was placed there in 1829. The lower park is modelled upon a style called the Italian Renaissance garden. It features three pairs of Medici lions near <b>the</b> <b>staircase</b> leading up to the palace's southern façade, carved out of carrara marble by sculptor Giovanni Bonnani.|$|E
5|$|Either {{side of the}} Marble Hall, lie the Great Staircase (2) and the Tapestry Room (11), which {{contains}} a collection of early eighteenth century Mortlake tapestries. The Great Staircase {{to the east of}} the Marble Hall is unusually placed at Belton, as in a house of this period one would expect to find <b>the</b> <b>staircase</b> in the hall. The stairs rise in three flights around the west, north, and east walls to the former Great Dining Room above the Marble Hall. Thus <b>the</b> <b>staircase</b> served as an important state procession link between the three principal reception rooms of the house. The Great Dining Room, now the Library, has been greatly altered and all traces of Carolean decoration removed, first by James Wyatt in 1778 when it was transformed into a drawing room with a vaulted ceiling, and again in 1876, when its use was again changed, this time to a library. The room contains some 6000 volumes, a superb example of book collecting over 350 years. When Lord Tyrconnel died in 1754 a catalogue of his library identified almost 2,300 books. Almost all of these remain in the Belton library today. Rupert Gunnis attributed the carved marble chimneypiece depicting two Roman goddesses to Sir Richard Westmacott.|$|E
5|$|Larsson was {{commissioned}} to decorate all {{the walls of}} the central staircase in the museum except for one, and he wanted to decorate the last wall as well. He intended the last wall to present a contrast to the other illustrations of <b>the</b> <b>staircase.</b> Whereas the painting Gustav Vasa enters Stockholm 1523 presented a midsummer theme with a triumphant king, Larsson wanted the last illustration to be a midwinter theme with a king who sacrificed himself for his people.|$|E

50|$|The {{ceiling of}} the {{vestibule}} is decorated with glazed ceramic moldings that are arranged {{in the shape of}} stars. From the vestibule, on the left and right, grand marble staircases ascend from between crowned lamps on columns to bring visitors to the second floor. The balustrades of <b>the</b> <b>staircases,</b> also marble, are supported by unusual transparent yellow glass balusters. The underside of <b>the</b> <b>staircases</b> is covered with tiles that form gleaming canopies {{on either side of the}} vestibule.|$|R

5|$|On 22 June, {{the liner}} hosted a press luncheon, and, the next afternoon, hosted some 3,000 {{members of the}} Daughters of the American Revolution who {{presented}} a commemorative bronze tablet. Stewart L. Woodford, a former Congressman and ambassador, spoke at the ceremony dedicating the tablet, which was placed {{at the base of}} <b>the</b> <b>staircase</b> in the first-class smoking room. Beginning 24 June, the North German Lloyd opened George Washington to the public for five days of viewing of the new ship.|$|E
5|$|On {{the first}} floor of the home the rooms remain much the same as they were when Glidden lived in the house. An {{original}} multi-paneled wooden door remains at the entry from the porch to the central hall. The door, however, was altered, having glass panels installed to admit more light. <b>The</b> <b>staircase</b> is also original and its newel posts resemble those found in the Isaac and Harriet Ellwood House, another Haish designed home, and the Gurler House, whose architect is unknown though it was quite possibly Haish, both in DeKalb.|$|E
5|$|Runcorn {{railway station}} is {{on a branch}} of the West Coast Main Line and {{provides}} frequent services to the Liverpool Lime Street, Birmingham New Street, and London Euston stations. The A533 road passes through the town from the south, crossing the Runcorn Gap over the Silver Jubilee Bridge, the lowest bridge crossing of the River Mersey. The Manchester Ship Canal runs alongside the Runcorn bank of the River Mersey; the Bridgewater Canal terminates in the canal basin in the town centre, as <b>the</b> <b>staircase</b> of locks leading down to the ship canal was filled in many decades ago.|$|E
