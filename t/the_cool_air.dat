5|$|The {{system worked}} as follows. Heat is {{constantly}} lost from the body. Food products reach {{the heart and}} are processed into new blood, releasing fire during metabolism, which raises the blood temperature too high. That raises the heart temperature, causing lung volume to increase, in turn raising the airflow at the mouth. <b>The</b> <b>cool</b> <b>air</b> brought in through the mouth reduces the heart temperature, so the lung volume accordingly decreases, restoring the temperature to normal.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the warm}} waters of the Great Salt Lake, lake effect snowfalls are {{frequent}} phenomena of the surrounding area. Cold north, northwest, or west winds generally blow across the lake following {{the passage of a}} cold front, and the temperature difference between the warm lake and <b>the</b> <b>cool</b> <b>air</b> can form clouds that lead to precipitation downwind of the lake. It is typically heaviest from eastern Tooele County east and north into central Davis County. It can deposit excessive snowfall amounts, generally with a narrow band of snow highly dependent on the direction the wind is blowing.|$|E
5|$|An {{occluded}} front is formed {{during the process}} of cyclogenesis when a cold front overtakes a warm front. The cold and warm fronts curve naturally poleward into the point of occlusion, which is also known as the triple point in meteorology. It lies within a sharp trough, but the air mass behind the boundary can be either warm or cold. In a cold occlusion, the air mass overtaking the warm front is cooler than <b>the</b> <b>cool</b> <b>air</b> ahead of the warm front, and plows under both air masses. In a warm occlusion, the air mass overtaking the warm front is not as cool as the cold air ahead of the warm front, and rides over the colder air mass while lifting the warm air. A wide variety of weather can be found along an {{occluded front}}, with thunderstorms possible, but usually their passage is associated with a drying of the air mass. Occluded fronts are indicated on a weather map by a purple line with alternating half-circles and triangles pointing in direction of travel. Occluded fronts usually form around mature low pressure areas.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cooling</b> <b>the</b> {{leading edge}} of the blade can be difficult, because the {{pressure}} of <b>the</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> just inside <b>the</b> <b>cooling</b> hole may not be much {{different from that of the}} oncoming gas stream. One solution is to incorporate a cover plate on the disc. This acts as a centrifugal compressor to pressurize <b>the</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> before it enters the blade. Another solution is to use an ultra-efficient turbine rim seal to pressurize the area where <b>the</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> passes across to the rotating disc.|$|R
50|$|As air is heated, it expands and {{possesses}} less density (weight {{per unit}} volume) than <b>cooler</b> <b>air.</b> Therefore, <b>the</b> heated air rises and displaces <b>the</b> <b>cooler</b> <b>air</b> (<b>the</b> <b>cooler</b> <b>air</b> descends). <b>The</b> method of Dry-heat gravity convection produces inconsistent temperatures within the chamber {{and has a}} very slow turn over.|$|R

5|$|In the {{dissipation}} stage, the thunderstorm {{is dominated}} by the downdraft. If atmospheric conditions do not support super cellular development, this stage occurs rather quickly, approximately 20–30 minutes into the life of the thunderstorm. The downdraft will push down out of the thunderstorm, hit the ground and spread out. This phenomenon is known as a downburst. <b>The</b> <b>cool</b> <b>air</b> carried to the ground by the downdraft cuts off the inflow of the thunderstorm, the updraft disappears and the thunderstorm will dissipate. Thunderstorms in an atmosphere with virtually no vertical wind shear weaken as soon as they send out an outflow boundary in all directions, which then quickly cuts off its inflow of relatively warm, moist air, and kills the thunderstorm's further growth. The downdraft hitting the ground creates an outflow boundary. This can cause downbursts, a potential hazardous condition for aircraft to fly through, as a substantial change in wind speed and direction occurs, resulting in a decrease of airspeed and the subsequent reduction in lift for the aircraft. The stronger the outflow boundary is, the stronger the resultant vertical wind shear becomes.|$|E
25|$|The caves, ravines and crevices were partly {{formed by}} {{slippage}} in sandstone formations. The Devil's Ice Box, {{one of the}} most visited caves in the park, is named for <b>the</b> <b>cool</b> <b>air</b> that rushes out of the cave. Air enters the cave at a point higher on the mountainside and is cooled as it passes through the mountain to the mouth of the cave.|$|E
25|$|Another {{important}} {{factor is the}} relief. The Bulgarian mountains and valleys act as barriers or channels for air masses, causing sharp contrasts in weather over relatively short distances. The Balkan Mountains form a barrier which effectively stops <b>the</b> <b>cool</b> <b>air</b> masses coming {{from the north and}} the warm masses from the south. The barrier effect of the Balkan Mountains is felt throughout the country: on the average, northern Bulgaria is about one degree cooler and receives about 192mm more rain than lowlands of southern Bulgaria. The Rilo-Rhodope Massif bars the warm Mediterranean air masses and limits the Mediterranean influence to the southern valleys of the rivers Struma, Mesta, Maritsa and Tundzha, despite the close proximity of the Aegean Sea.|$|E

40|$|To reduce {{carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) {{emissions}} of road going vehicles, the aerodynamic drag {{is an important}} area to focus on. Reducing aerodynamic drag will lead to reduced fuel consumption and hence decreased CO 2 emissions. A significant element of the aerodynamic drag of a modern passenger car is <b>the</b> <b>cooling</b> drag, which can constitute up to 15 %. Possible solutions to reduce <b>the</b> <b>cooling</b> drag include closing off parts of <b>the</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> inlets when {{only a small amount}} of <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> flow is needed. The focus of this study is on the aerodynamic effects closing off <b>the</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> inlets have on a modern passenger car.

25|$|There {{were many}} heros {{throughout}} the exhausting {{five days of}} play, but with a doubt, the most unsung of them was Greg Matthews, who scored 44 and 27 not out and took five wickets in each innings. His stamina and resilience were absolutely staggering, especially on the last day, when he bowled 39.5 overs just about consecutively to keep us {{in the game and}} then ultimately tie it. Making his feat all the more noteworthy in the eyes of his fellow players was the fact that he wore two sleeveless sweaters throughout the day. Actually, he gave one to the umpire when he fielded and only wore them both when he was bowling. We just shook our heads in disbelief, because it was so hot with 90 degree humidity, but as usual Greg had a theory. He explained that nomadic herders in the desert wore woollen coats because they kept <b>the</b> <b>cool</b> <b>air</b> in, thus acting as a kind of air-conditioner.|$|E
25|$|The {{southeast}} {{province of}} Gorizia {{is home to}} the DOCs of the Collio region, most notably Collio Goriziano. Part of the region's vineyards extend over the border with Slovenia but none of the Slovenian Wines can bear the designation Collio. The area benefits from its location among the foothills of the Alps where the cool winds that come off the Adriatic moderate the climate. <b>The</b> <b>cool</b> <b>air</b> helps maintain the acidity levels in the grape. The region's best vineyards are found in the clay and sandstone soil around the comune of Cormons. The region is dominated by white wine production, making five times more white than red wine. Collio wine is typically full bodied and rich, made as a varietal or blend of Friulano, Ribolla Gialla, Malvasia Istriana, Chardonnay, Pinot bianco, Pinot grigio and Sauvignon blanc. Red wine under the designation Collio Rosso is made from a blend of Merlot, Cabernet franc and Cabernet Sauvignon. The general Collio Bianco designation can also include the white grapes Müller-Thurgau, Picolit, Riesling, Traminer and Welschriesling as well as the white juice from the red wine grapes of Cabernet Sauvignon and Pinot nero.|$|E
25|$|The rooms {{within the}} {{elongation}} are accessed through a 48-foot long, 6-foot wide gallery. The gallery is enclosed in its full length {{through the use}} of an original row of wooden balustrade, supporting operable wooden transoms, movable wooden louvers and wooden shutters, simultaneously providing shade and air, two important local design considerations, as Ponce is known for its hot weather and its implacable sun. Another significant design in Casa Vives related to Ponce's climate is the treatment given to the air circulation within the living quarters. The house has high ceilings, ranging from 14 to 15 feet, to give hot air more space to rise. Adorned ventilation holes are strategically located at the four corners of every room's ceiling, allowing for the heat to exit through the roof and letting <b>the</b> <b>cool</b> <b>air</b> circulate throughout the entire house. The fresh air is captured at the roof through a set of brick and masonry ventilation structures, oriented in an east-to-west direction (the usual direction of the wind currents), and channelized to the house interior. Every single room in the house connects to the adjacent room through wooden double doors (some with louvers and shutters, other of solid construction), allowing air to circulate from one space to another. Furthermore, many of the interior doors are crowned with wooden transoms, facilitating the air conduit even with the doors closed. In addition, every single room has, at least, one wooden double door that open toward the exterior.|$|E

50|$|Warm fronts occur {{where the}} warm air pushes out a {{previously}} lodged cold air mass. The warm <b>air</b> overrides <b>the</b> <b>cooler</b> <b>air</b> and moves upward.
