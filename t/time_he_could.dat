5|$|In 2011, Warren Jeffs {{was convicted}} in Texas on sexual assault charges {{unrelated}} to Wall's case and {{sentenced to life in}} prison plus 20 years. Since Warren Jeffs would therefore be 100 years old by the earliest <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> be released from prison, Utah decided to drop the retrial.|$|E
5|$|After {{his playing}} career, McBride retired to Florissant, Missouri, where he briefly owned a liquor store. He was enjoying the <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> spend with his family, but the New York Mets called {{him with a}} {{coaching}} opportunity. In 1985, the organization hired McBride as an outfield and baserunning coach for their minor league system. He stayed with the organization for seven years. In the 1990s, McBride was a minor league hitting coach for the Cardinals.|$|E
5|$|Flanagan's first {{concert was}} around 1945, with trombonist Frank Rosolino. Given Flanagan was only around 15 {{years old at}} the <b>time,</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not stay in the bar area of the club; between sets, therefore, he went to another room and did some homework. As a teenager, he played in a band led by Lucky Thompson that also {{contained}} Pepper Adams and Kenny Burrell. Still in his teens, Flanagan also sat in on piano for some appearances by Charlie Parker in Detroit. During 1949, Flanagan had his first residence, at the Blue Bird Inn in Detroit. In 1950 he played with Rudy Rutherford, until the clarinetist returned to the Count Basie band. Flanagan then played jazz and rhythm and blues with saxophonist George Benson in Toledo, before being drafted into the army in 1951.|$|E

5|$|Growing up {{as part of}} a lucha libre {{family the}} future Espanto Jr. decided he wanted to follow in the {{footsteps}} of his father and grandfather at an early age. In a 2010 interview he recalled how he would be in the front row watching his father wrestle from the <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> walk. In 1996 his father suffered an injury during a match and was briefly clinically dead while in the ring until he was revived. While the injury left a big impression on the then-10 year old he later accepted that it was an accident and tried not to think about it, but did comment that his mother still worried about him every time he competed.|$|E
5|$|In short, had Mr. Boulton {{done nothing}} {{more in the}} world than he has {{accomplished}} in improving the coinage, his name would deserve to be immortalised; and if it be considered that this was done in the midst of various other important avocations, and at enormous expense,— for which, at the <b>time,</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have had no certainty of an adequate return,—we shall be at a loss whether most to admire his ingenuity, his perseverance, or his munificence. He has conducted the whole more like a sovereign than a private manufacturer; and the love of fame has always been to him a greater stimulus than the love of gain. Yet it is to be hoped that, even in the latter point of view, the enterprise answered its purpose.|$|E
5|$|Six {{weeks from}} {{theatrical}} release, no dubbing {{had taken place}} and the score had not been written as Horner was unable to view the completed film. The final cue for the scene in which Ripley battles the alien queen was written overnight. Cameron completely reworked the scene, leaving Horner to rewrite the music. As Gale Hurd {{did not have much}} music production experience, she and Cameron denied Horner's request to push the film back four weeks so he could finish the score. Horner felt that, given more <b>time,</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> get the score to 100% of his satisfaction rather than the 80% he estimated {{he had been able to}} achieve. The score was recorded in roughly four days. Despite his troubles, Horner received an Academy Award nomination (his first) for Best Original Score.|$|E
50|$|Maciel contributed {{significantly}} to the team's domestic supremacy renewal, appearing in 18 games and scoring three <b>times.</b> <b>He</b> <b>could</b> not participate, however, in its victorious campaign in the UEFA Champions League, being cup-tied for having played with Leiria in the season's UEFA Cup.|$|R

5|$|Free-labor proponents in the East {{also wanted}} to create a similar {{organization}} in the western states. In the 1840s members of the Salem Free Produce Association approached Coffin to see if he would be interested in managing the proposed Western Free Produce Association. At first he declined, saying he lacked the money required to fund the venture, and {{that he did not want}} to move into the city. In 1845 a group of abolitionist businessmen opened a wholesale mercantile business in Cincinnati and the Free Produce Association raised $3,000 to help stock the new warehouse with goods. Different groups continued to pressure Coffin to accept a position as the new business's director, claiming there were no other western abolitionists qualified to manage the enterprise. Reluctantly, he finally agreed to oversee the warehouse for five years, in which <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> train someone else to run it, and in 1847 Levi and Catharine Coffin moved to Ohio.|$|E
5|$|Hughes then {{signed a}} multi-fight {{deal with the}} UFC. Hughes {{defeated}} Renzo Gracie, the 1st cousin once removed of his opponent at UFC 60, via third round TKO at , setting the record for most UFC wins with 17. Both of them seemed very comfortable fighting on their feet in the early going, with Gracie landing the cleaner and more effective punches and also landing a couple of kicks. Hughes started the second round with powerful leg kicks, but after that Gracie returned to his in-and-out punching style. Hughes got double underhooks and managed to take Gracie down briefly. In the final round Hughes connected with a right hook to Gracie's chin, then connected with a leg kick and another punch. With two minutes to go he knocked Gracie down with a leg kick. Gracie took all the <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> before Hughes helped him up and then dropped him with a second leg kick. Gracie stalled again, but when he finally stood up Hughes floored him with a punch, let him get up and then attacked again. Hughes knocked Gracie down again with a fourth punch, when referee Herb Dean ended it.|$|E
5|$|The biogeographical {{patterns}} Charles Darwin {{observed in}} places such as the Galápagos Islands during the second voyage of HMS Beagle caused him to doubt the fixity of species, and in 1837 Darwin started {{the first of a series}} of secret notebooks on transmutation. Darwin's observations led him to view transmutation as a process of divergence and branching, rather than the ladder-like progression envisioned by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck and others. In 1838 he read the new 6th edition of An Essay on the Principle of Population, written in the late 18th century by Thomas Robert Malthus. Malthus' idea of population growth leading to a struggle for survival combined with Darwin's knowledge on how breeders selected traits, led to the inception of Darwin's theory of natural selection. Darwin did not publish his ideas on evolution for 20 years. However, he did share them with certain other naturalists and friends, starting with Joseph Dalton Hooker, with whom he discussed his unpublished 1844 essay on natural selection. During this period he used the <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> spare from his other scientific work to slowly refine his ideas and, aware of the intense controversy around transmutation, amass evidence to support them. In September 1854 he began full-time work on writing his book on natural selection.|$|E

5|$|That same year, Brian Hodgson, who {{had spent}} many years in Nepal serving as the Assistant Resident, and who had a good {{knowledge}} about Nepal's bio-diversity, culture, and politics, became the new British Resident. Although the British Residents were officially instructed {{to keep out of}} the internal politics of Nepal, the Resident was courted by both the King as well as the Mukhtiyar. Hodgson was waiting for an opportunity to exploit the rift between the Mukhtiyar and the royal family and begin a more aggressive campaign to increase British influence and trading opportunities. Hodgson also believed the large standing army to be a security threat and that the border tensions could be pacified if the King was directly in control, rather than a mukhtiyar who needed to keep {{on the right side of}} the army. By 1834, Hodgson had come to a conclusion that he would not be able to have his way so long as Bhimsen was in control of the Nepalese administration; thus he strongly sympathized with the Pande faction, and he wished to install Fateh Jung Shah, who was more favorably disposed to him, as the mukhtiyar. In August 1834, Hodgson proposed to conduct a new commercial treaty between Nepal and Britain, which Bhimsen in principle agreed to but disagreed with several of the clauses. At a time when his authority was diminishing, Bhimsen could not afford to antagonize the Resident; but at the same <b>time,</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not accept his proposals and be seen as subservient to the British by the Nepalese court. Nevertheless, he tried to maintain a friendly and conciliatory attitude toward the Resident, in order to win him as his ally, by loosening the restrictions on his movements and granting direct access to the King.|$|E
25|$|Usually {{the chosen}} Hieromonk is consecrated {{first as a}} Diocesan Bishop, then with <b>time,</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> be awarded the higher dignity of Metropolitan Bishop. Sometimes the {{nominated}} Diocesan Bishop is already an Assistant Bishop, Auxiliary Bishop or General Bishop, in which case he is only enthroned as the bishop of that Diocese.|$|E
25|$|For a {{prototype}} difference engine, Babbage brought in Joseph Clement {{to implement the}} design, in 1823. Clement worked to high standards, but his machine tools were particularly elaborate. Under the standard terms of business of the <b>time,</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> charge for their construction, and would also own them. He and Babbage fell out over costs around 1831.|$|E

25|$|On March 2, 2012, Odom was {{assigned}} to the Texas Legends of the NBA D-League. He had missed the prior three games due to personal reasons. His stint with the Legends was canceled on March 3, 2012 and he returned to the Mavs' active roster.

25|$|During de Córdoba's first command he was {{primarily}} in Calabrian mountain warfare, which resembled his former experience in Granada. There was, however, a material {{difference in the}} enemy. The French forces under d'Aubigny consisted largely of Swiss mercenary pikemen, and their own men-at-arms, the heavily armoured professional cavalry gendarmes. With his veterans of the Granadine war (foot soldiers armed with sword and buckler—or arquebuses and crossbows—and light cavalry), with endurance unparalleled among soldiers of the <b>time,</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> conduct guerrilla warfare which wore down his opponents.|$|E
25|$|Bryant {{then moved}} back to the {{passenger}} side of the Corolla as Hall attempted to climb over to the driver's seat. Bryant raised his rifle and fired three shots, killing her. Many people around the service station witnessed this and ran to hide in nearby bushland. The service station attendant told everyone to lie down and he locked the main doors. He grabbed his rifle, but by the <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> retrieve some ammunition and load his gun, Bryant had left in the BMW. A police officer arrived several minutes later and then set out in pursuit of Bryant.|$|E
25|$|On June 18, 1977, Chris Gardner married Sherry Dyson, a Virginia {{native and}} an {{educational}} expert in mathematics.

Gardner was advised to consider more lucrative career options; a few days before his 26th birthday, he informed his wife, Sherry, of his plans to abandon his dreams of becoming a physician.|$|E

His dissections were made using the most simple instruments, almost children's toys.
