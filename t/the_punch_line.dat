5|$|As {{the reigning}} most {{valuable}} player, Richard sought a pay raise {{prior to the}} 1947–48 season. General manager Frank Selke refused, even after Richard and team captain Émile Bouchard both sat out the Canadiens' preseason before capitulating and returning to the team when the season began. <b>The</b> <b>Punch</b> <b>line</b> was broken up after Blake suffered a career-ending leg injury. Richard's season also ended early as he missed the final {{games of the season}} due to a knee injury. He finished second in team scoring with 53 points in 53 games, but Montreal missed the playoffs. After recording only 38 points in 1948–49, Richard posted a 65-point campaign the next season and his 43 goals led the NHL for the third time. In 1950–51, Richard scored 42 goals, including his 271st career goal, making him Montreal's all-time goal leader.|$|E

25|$|Bisociation: This is a {{technical}} term coined by Arthur Koestler. He {{says that a}} funny text is situated in two different semantic levels. In the beginning, the hearer or reader is aware of only one of them. In <b>the</b> <b>punch</b> <b>line,</b> the second level comes up so suddenly that they start laughing. The sudden coming up of the second level is the point. For example: I only want your best – your money.|$|E

500|$|The brand {{label on}} Homer's shower radio reads [...] "No-Soap, Radio!", so-named for <b>the</b> <b>punch</b> <b>line</b> of a {{well-known}} practical joke. The scene where Homer dances {{in his underwear}} to the Royal Teens song [...] "Short Shorts" [...] is almost identical to a scene in the 1983 Tom Cruise film, Risky Business.

500|$|The {{title for}} the episode is {{purposely}} vague. During the commentary, the cast revealed that there are actually three [...] "secrets" [...] in the episode: Jim's hidden feelings for Pam, Dwight and Angela's relationship, and Oscar's homosexuality. Stupkitsky later joked that there are [...] "actually nine secrets in the episode". The cold opening – wherein Michael tries to tell a joke where <b>the</b> <b>punch</b> <b>line</b> is [...] "What's up dog?" [...] – {{was inspired by the}} same prank being pulled on Stupnitsky. The original cold opening for the episode featured Michael playing golf in his office, but it was cut.|$|E
500|$|A bright blues [...] "stomper" [...] about lovers parting, [...] "Most Likely You Go Your Way And I'll Go Mine" [...] {{is one of}} {{the more}} literal songs Dylan {{recorded}} in his 1965–66 period. The narrator has tired of carrying his lover and is going to let her [...] "pass". As in [...] "Just Like a Woman" [...] and [...] "Absolutely Sweet Marie", he waits until the end of each verse to deliver <b>the</b> <b>punch</b> <b>line,</b> which in this case comes from the title.

500|$|Formed in 1980 by guitarist D. Boon and bassist Mike Watt, the Minutemen {{signed to}} the Californian {{independent}} record label SST Records at their second concert. Their first extended play, Paranoid Time, appeared later that year, {{followed by the}} Joy EP (on their own label, New Alliance Records) and their first studio album, <b>The</b> <b>Punch</b> <b>Line.</b> The Minutemen continued to release new material throughout 1982 and 1983 to a mostly local audience. In 1984, the band released Double Nickels on the Dime, their only double album and best-selling release.

500|$|As Richard {{approached}} 50 {{goals for}} the season, opposition players resorted to increasingly violent efforts {{to prevent him from}} scoring. He had to fight past slashes, hooks, and even players who draped themselves across his back. Richard went eight games without scoring and began Montreal's final regular season game, March 18, on the road against the Boston Bruins with 49 goals. He finally reached the milestone by scoring with 2:15 remaining in the game, a 4–2 Montreal win. He became the first player to score 50 goals in 50 games, a standard that {{remains one of the most}} celebrated achievements in NHL history. [...] Richard finished the season with 73 points, seven behind Lach and six ahead of Blake, as <b>the</b> <b>Punch</b> <b>line</b> finished first, second and third in league scoring. [...] Richard finished second in the voting for the Hart Trophy as league MVP behind Lach.|$|E
500|$|Batman subdues the Joker {{and tells}} him that Gordon survived the Joker's torments, and {{suggests}} that the Joker is alone in his madness. He attempts {{to reach out to}} the Joker and offers to help him recover in order to end their everlasting war, which Batman fears may one day result in a fight to the death. The Joker declines, saying it is too late..."far too late". He then says that this situation reminds him of a joke about two inmates in a lunatic asylum who try to escape. One inmate jumps across a narrow gap between the asylum and the adjoining building, but the other is afraid he will fall. The first inmate offers to shine his flashlight across the gap so the other can walk across it, but the second inmate replies, [...] "What do you think I am, crazy?

5000|$|Another example {{comes from}} the film The Aristocrats, wherein Wendy Liebman pulls [...] "the old switcheroo".

40|$|This study investigates how {{the gender}} of a {{performer}} affects the way they produce physical comedy in a theatrical context, framed through Kristeva's theory of abjection and Butler's notion of gender as performance. As a thesis by creative work, it produced an original piece of theatre, The Furze Family Variety Hour, which featured a male/ female comic duo, where the female performer enjoyed an equal share of <b>the</b> <b>punch</b> <b>lines.</b> <b>The</b> study generates {{a new understanding of}} how the body operates in physical comedy, namely, a system of bodily registers, as well as a new understanding of the female grotesque comic body...|$|R
500|$|Chicago Sun-Times {{film critic}} Roger Ebert gave the film the rating {{of half a}} star out of four, and {{compared}} his screening to [...] "taking a bus trip with someone who has needed a bath for a long time.

[...] Leonard Maltin rated the film a [...] "BOMB" [...] in his book Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide, writing: [...] "Clumsy plot, misplaced satire, unbelievable coincidences, and a leaden pace trample Travolta's weird but amusing performance." [...] David Bleiler gave the film one star out of four in the TLA Video & DVD Guide, writing: [...] "This is disjointed, tedious, and every bit as bad as its reputation." [...] Jon Stewart mocked the film on his television program The Daily Show, describing it as [...] "a cross between Star Wars and the smell of ass." ...|$|E
500|$|It was in {{the next}} game of the series which [...] Leaf defenceman Bill Barilko scored {{one of the most}} famous goals in NHL history with a goal in {{overtime}} to win the Stanley Cup. However, without Kennedy's face-off skills Barilko's goal would not have occurred. Montreal had been leading late in the game 2–1 and it appeared that the teams were headed to a sixth game in Montreal. With just 39 seconds remaining, Toronto was able to get a faceoff in the Montreal end. Toronto coach Joe Primeau had pulled the goaltender so they could have six skaters. Primeau had the option of changing his players, but decided to leave Kennedy out to take the faceoff against Canadien Billy Reay. Kennedy's plan on the faceoff was to get the puck to Max Bentley, who was stationed at the point. Then Montreal coach Dick Irvin decided to switch and have his best forwards, <b>the</b> <b>Punch</b> <b>Line,</b> out for this critical faceoff. Kennedy faced Lach instead. Kennedy later recalled he was relieved at the switch as he had trouble with Reay on faceoffs, but when Lach came out he felt [...] "I had a chance," [...] Kennedy won the faceoff from Lach, got the puck to Bentley and from the ensuing scramble around the net Tod Sloan tied the game. The goal dispirited the Montreal team and led to Barilko's famed overtime goal which won another Stanley Cup for the Leafs.|$|E
2500|$|A {{construction}} site expects an inspection from the higher-ups, so a foreman warns {{the boys to}} watch their tongues. During the inspection, a hammer is accidentally dropped from the fourth floor right on a worker's head... <b>The</b> <b>punch</b> <b>line</b> is an exceedingly polite, classy rebuke {{from the mouth of}} the injured, rather than a typically expected [...] "#@&%$!". For example the injured worker might say: [...] "Dear co-workers, could you please watch your tools a little more carefully, so as to prevent such cases and avoid work-place injuries?" [...] In another variant of the joke <b>the</b> <b>punch</b> <b>line</b> is [...] "Vasya, please desist in pouring molten tin over my head".|$|E

50|$|The {{spirit of}} <b>the</b> song's <b>punch</b> <b>line</b> {{is a common}} humorous or ironic gag.
