40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} a novel hand gesture interface system via a depth imaging sensor for appliances control in smart home environments. To control appliances with hand gestures, {{we recognize the}} hand parts in a depth hand silhouette and generate control commands. In our methodologies, we first create a database (DB) of synthetic hand depth silhouettes and their corresponding hand parts-labelled maps and then train a random forests (RFs) classifier with the DB. Via the trained RFs, we recognize the hand parts in a depth silhouette. Then {{based on the information}} of the recognized hand parts, control commands are finally generated according to our implemented control interface. By testing our system on real hand gestures, we have obtained an average recognition rate of 98. 50 % from five different subjects. With the presented interface system, users can control smart home appliances such as <b>TV,</b> <b>fan,</b> lighting, doors and change channels, temperature, and volume by just hand gestures...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A leisure {{ship has}} a {{stand-alone}} type power system, and a generator is in use on this condition. But the generator cannot be operated in condition of leisure activity, ocean measurement and etc, because of environment and noise. Recently, renewable energy system {{is connected with}} power system of the leisure-ship for saving energy. The renewable energy system can not supply the stable power to leisure-ship because power generation changes according to weather condition. And most of the leisure ship is operated without methodical power management system. This study's purpose is to develop SPMS(Smart Power Management System) algorithm using the renewable energy (photovoltaic, wind power and etc.). The proposed algorithm is able to supply stable the power according to operation mode. Furthermore, the SPMS manages electric load (sailing and communication equipment, <b>TV,</b> <b>fan,</b> etc.) and reduces operating times of the generator. In this paper, the proposed algorithm is realized and executed by using LabVIEW. As a result, the hour for operating the generator is minimized...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to explore a new model to {{generate}} electricity with higher penetration rate of renewable energy. Conventional system to generate electricity is to generate large amount electricity at power station and then deliver to the consumer through long transmission line and distribution system. The losses and costs, incorporated with these processes, are not negligible. Another System is the Solar Home System (SHS) which is being used to replace traditional kerosene based lamp, battery based <b>TV,</b> <b>fan</b> and light bulb from 1998 in Bangladesh. But with the advancement of technology, the demand of the consumer is increasing significantly. To meet this demand it is necessary to expand national grid connection. An alternative way is to produce sufficient power using renewable resources at consuming spots. A novel method to achieve this goal has been discussed in this paper which is supported by the field study of Bangladesh University. Also a comparison has been shown with traditional power system...|$|E
