5|$|After birth, {{the mother}} cleans <b>the</b> <b>cubs,</b> and can then {{recognize}} each by its smell. At first, she spends 60% to 90% {{of her time}} with <b>the</b> <b>cubs.</b> After the first week, the mother starts spending more time outside the nest, returning every few hours to nurse and groom <b>the</b> <b>cubs.</b> She moves the young frequently among several nests, all of which she keeps clean. <b>The</b> <b>cubs</b> start to open their eyes at about 18 days of age. By about 90 days, they have achieved full adult fur and coloring, and begin to venture out of the nest. They also start eating solid foods at this point, weaning at around six to eight months of age. <b>The</b> <b>cubs</b> stay with their mother until the next litter is born in the following summer. Males rarely help raise the young, and only if they live in pairs or in small groups.|$|E

5|$|When first {{introduced}} {{to the rest of}} the pride, <b>the</b> <b>cubs</b> initially lack confidence when confronted with adult lions other than their mother. They soon begin to immerse themselves in the pride life, however, playing among themselves or attempting to initiate play with the adults. Lionesses with cubs of their own are more likely to be tolerant of another lioness's cubs than lionesses without cubs. The tolerance of the male lions toward <b>the</b> <b>cubs</b> varies – sometimes, a male will patiently let <b>the</b> <b>cubs</b> play with his tail or his mane, whereas another may snarl and bat <b>the</b> <b>cubs</b> away.|$|E

5|$|A {{dominant}} cub {{emerges in}} most litters, usually a male. This cub is more active than its siblings {{and takes the}} lead in their play, eventually leaving its mother and becoming independent earlier. <b>The</b> <b>cubs</b> open their eyes at six to fourteen days old. By eight weeks, <b>the</b> <b>cubs</b> make short ventures outside the den with their mother, although they do not travel with her as she roams her territory until they are older. <b>The</b> <b>cubs</b> are nursed for three to six months. Around {{the time they are}} weaned, they start to accompany their mother on territorial walks and they are taught how to hunt. <b>The</b> <b>cubs</b> often become capable (and nearly adult size) hunters at eleven months old. <b>The</b> <b>cubs</b> become independent around eighteen months of age, but it is not until they are around two to {{two and a half years}} old that they fully separate from their mother.

5|$|Chicago's win {{clinched}} the team's 15th postseason berth in franchise history, their first in 9 years since losing in the 1989 National League Championship Series.

The Billy Goat story suggests that Billy Sianis cursed <b>the</b> <b>Cubs</b> after he and his goat were asked to leave game four of the 1945 World Series. The playoff berth matched <b>the</b> <b>Cubs</b> with the Atlanta Braves in the NLDS, where <b>the</b> <b>Cubs</b> were swept 3 games to 0. <b>The</b> <b>Cubs</b> would have to wait another 18 years to win the National League pennant and World Series in 2016, their first NL pennant since 1945, and their first title since 1908.|$|E

50|$|The next design after <b>the</b> <b>Cub</b> Cadet 70 and 100 was <b>the</b> <b>Cub</b> Cadet 71, 102, and 122. <b>The</b> <b>Cub</b> Cadet 71 was the {{replacement}} for <b>the</b> <b>Cub</b> Cadet seventy and kept {{many of the}} same features as the 70 including the pan seat, optional round fenders, and seven horsepower Kohler engine. The model 102, which replaced the model 100, was fitted with a ten-horsepower Kohler engine. <b>The</b> <b>Cub</b> Cadet 122 was <b>the</b> first <b>Cub</b> Cadet Garden tractor to contain a twelve-horsepower Kohler engine. <b>The</b> <b>Cub</b> Cadet 102 and 122 retained the same frame as the models 70 and 100, but they were <b>the</b> first <b>cub</b> cadets to come standard with square fenders. Production of the 71, 102, and 122 ran from 1965 to 1967. During this production run, in 1966, International produced <b>the</b> <b>Cub</b> Cadet model 123. The model 123 was the same as the model 122, except the three speed gear driven transmission was replaced by a shaft driven hydrostatic transmission. The hydrostatic transmission allowed the operator to have complete control over their speed eliminating the requirement to clutch and choose gears. Because International thought people would be skeptical of the reliability of a hydrostatic transmission, they painted a few 123s as tigers and put them in circus acts in which operators would perform tricks on them jamming it in reverse and forward to prove the durability of the new transmission.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Cubs,</b> led by Tinker, Evers, and Chance, won the National League pennant in 1906, 1907, 1908, and 1910. In 1908, <b>the</b> <b>Cubs</b> {{clinched}} the pennant after defeating the Giants {{in part due}} to Merkle's Boner. In the Merkle game, Tinker hit a home run off Christy Mathewson, and Evers alerted umpire Hank O'Day to Merkle's baserunning gaffe. In the replay of the Merkle game, Tinker hit a triple off Mathewson that started the rally that gave <b>the</b> <b>Cubs</b> the victory, clinching the pennant.|$|E
5|$|Tinker, Evers, and Chance {{began playing}} {{together}} with <b>the</b> <b>Cubs</b> in 1902, {{and formed a}} double play combination that lasted through April 1912. <b>The</b> <b>Cubs</b> won the National League pennant four times from 1906 and 1910 (and the 1907 and 1908 World Series), often defeating the Giants {{en route to the}} World Series.|$|E
50|$|The next {{models that}} {{followed}} <b>the</b> <b>Cub</b> Cadet Original were <b>the</b> <b>Cub</b> Cadet 70 and 100. International designed <b>the</b> <b>Cub</b> Cadet 70 and 100 because of requests from customers {{to build a}} tougher tractor. International responded to these requests by incorporating a two channel frame, called the narrow frame, inside which the engine sat. The new frame allowed the flywheel on the engine to be directly {{in line with the}} drive shaft eliminating the need for a belt to drive the three speed transmission. Therefore, <b>the</b> <b>Cub</b> Cadet model 70 and 100 was the first true shaft driven <b>Cub</b> Cadet. <b>The</b> <b>Cub</b> Cadet 70 was a direct replacement to the original which still contained the seven horsepower Kohler engine. The model 100 offered the same features as the model 70; the only difference was it had a ten-horsepower Kohler engine instead of the seven horsepower engine. Round fenders, headlights, and a creeper gear were all examples of options that could be had on the model 70 and 100. Production of <b>the</b> <b>Cub</b> Cadet 70 and 100 ranged from 1963 to 1965.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Cub</b> Lo-Boy, {{introduced}} in 1955, was a lowered version of <b>the</b> Standard <b>Cub.</b> <b>The</b> rear axle housings were rotated, lowering the tractor about 7-8 inches.

These modifications lowered {{the center of}} gravity, and decreased the turning radius, which made the tractor more maneuverable improving the mowing capability of <b>the</b> <b>Cub.</b>|$|R

5|$|Usually, {{the mother}} does not {{integrate}} {{herself and her}} cubs back into the pride until <b>the</b> <b>cubs</b> are {{six to eight weeks}} old. Sometimes this introduction to pride life occurs earlier, however, particularly if other lionesses have given birth at about the same time. For instance, lionesses in a pride often synchronise their reproductive cycles and there is communal raising and suckling of the young (once <b>the</b> <b>cubs</b> are past the initial stage of isolation with their mother), who suckle indiscriminately from any or all of the nursing females in the pride. The synchronization of births also has an advantage in that <b>the</b> <b>cubs</b> end up being roughly the same size, and thus have an equal chance of survival, and older cubs do not dominate the sucklings.|$|E
