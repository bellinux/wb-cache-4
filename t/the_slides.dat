5|$|More complex {{parts are}} formed using more complex moulds. These may have {{sections}} called slides, that {{move into a}} cavity perpendicular to the draw direction, to form overhanging part features. When the mould is opened, <b>the</b> <b>slides</b> are {{pulled away from the}} plastic part by using stationary “angle pins” on the stationary mould half. These pins enter a slot in <b>the</b> <b>slides</b> and cause <b>the</b> <b>slides</b> to move backward when the moving half of the mould opens. The part is then ejected and the mould closes. The closing action of the mould causes <b>the</b> <b>slides</b> to move forward along the angle pins.|$|E

5|$|In 2012, Cedar Point added Dinosaurs Alive!, a {{walk-through}} exhibit featuring approximately 50 life-size animatronic dinosaurs. It {{is located}} on Adventure Island and replaced the Paddlewheel Excursions boat cruise ride. A six-lane mat racer slide complex called Dragster H2O was added to Soak City. <b>The</b> <b>slides</b> around Dragster H2O were repainted and the Speed Slides were dismantled {{to make room for}} Dragster H2O. Cedar Point also introduced Fast Lane, their version of a fast-pass system, and a new nighttime show, Luminosity– Ignite the Night!. Cedar Point also removed WildCat for the 2012 season to make room for Luminosity. This was the first time since 1978 that a roller coaster was removed from Cedar Point.|$|E
50|$|The take-down lever {{is used to}} lock <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> back (as <b>the</b> Browning Hi-Power {{safety is}} used) during {{disassembly}} to allow removal of <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> release lever. In later variants, this lever is omitted and <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> must be manually aligned to remove <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> release lever. Once <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> and frame are aligned (by the disassembly lever or manually), the recoil guide is pulled forward to release <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> release lever {{and allow it to}} drop free. <b>The</b> <b>slide</b> will then be free to run forward and be removed from the frame.|$|R

5|$|India {{experienced}} similar {{development to}} China in the Middle Ages; however, stringed instruments developed differently as they accommodated {{different styles of}} music. While stringed instruments of China were designed to produce precise tones capable of matching the tones of chimes, stringed instruments of India were considerably more flexible. This flexibility suited <b>the</b> <b>slides</b> and tremolos of Hindu music. Rhythm was of paramount importance in Indian music of the time, {{as evidenced by the}} frequent depiction of drums in reliefs dating to the Middle Ages. The emphasis on rhythm is an aspect native to Indian music. Historians divide the development of musical instruments in medieval India between pre-Islamic and Islamic periods due to the different influence each period provided.|$|E
5|$|The {{sequence}} of earthquakes caused widespread landslides {{from the coast}} to east of Scotia and from the northern extent of the Eel River basin near Thompson Hill to south of Petrolia. Most of these were existing landslides that had been re-initiated and the largest of <b>the</b> <b>slides</b> were either slumps or bedding plane failures along the coastal bluffs. Several slump failures between Guthrie Creek and Oil Creek stretched from the bluffs out towards the shore for a distance of , leaving some of the slide to be eroded by the surf. The road between Ferndale and Petrolia was closed {{for more than a}} week where about six mostly minor landslides blocked the passage, with the roadway itself sustaining light damage due to sliding or settlement of the road fill in a few instances. One of the largest slides occurred along the railroad tracks at the Scotia bluffs where previous slides had taken place. That slide also took about a week to clear.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of 2013 Wyangala Waters State Park advertised for expressions of interest to remove the water slides from within the Park. <b>The</b> <b>slides</b> {{had not been in}} use due to problems of Park management finding a suitable operator. This unexpected announcement by the Park resulted in an extensive campaign to save <b>the</b> <b>slides.</b>|$|E
50|$|Field {{stripping}} {{is accomplished}} by locking <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> to <b>the</b> rear, rotating the takedown lever clockwise ninety degrees and releasing <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> stop while carefully allowing <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> to be pushed forward out of the frame. The barrel and recoil spring then separate from <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> to complete <b>the</b> disassembly procedure.|$|R
50|$|Using an aseptic technique, {{bacteria}} {{are placed on}} a slide and heat fixed. <b>The</b> <b>slide</b> is then suspended over a water bath {{with some sort of}} porus paper over it, so that <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> is steamed. Malachite green is applied to <b>the</b> <b>slide,</b> which can penetrate the tough walls of the endospores, staining them green. After five minutes, <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> is removed from the steam, and the paper towel is removed. After cooling, <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> is rinsed with water for thirty seconds. <b>The</b> <b>slide</b> is then stained with diluted safranin for two minutes, which stains most other microorganic bodies red or pink. <b>The</b> <b>slide</b> is then rinsed again, and blotted dry with bibulous paper.|$|R
5000|$|When {{the trigger}} is pulled <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> is {{released}} and driven {{forward by the}} return spring, stripping a round from the magazine and feeding it into the chamber. As soon as the cartridge is lined up with the chamber the extractor grips the [...] and the gun fires while <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> is still moving forward. The firing impulse retards the forward movement of <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> and drives it back. The extractor grips the empty case until the ejector pushes it through the ejection port in the right of <b>the</b> <b>slide.</b> <b>The</b> <b>slide</b> continues to <b>the</b> rear and the return spring, located under the barrel, is fully compressed. <b>The</b> <b>slide</b> rides over a retarder lever which snaps up and holds <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> to <b>the</b> rear. The rate-reducing device, an inertia buffer {{in the rear of}} <b>the</b> <b>slide,</b> continues rearward under its own momentum and compresses the buffer spring. When the spring is fully compressed it throws the retarder forward and this pushes the retarder lever down out of engagement with <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> and, provided <b>the</b> trigger is still depressed and ammunition remains in <b>the</b> magazine, <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> goes forward to repeat the firing cycle.|$|R
25|$|The slide is aged using a salt {{solution}} usually consisting of 2X SSC (salt, sodium citrate). <b>The</b> <b>slides</b> are then dehydrated in ethanol, and the probe mixture is added. The sample DNA and the probe DNA are then co-denatured using a heated plate {{and allowed to}} re-anneal for at least 4 hours. <b>The</b> <b>slides</b> are then washed to remove excess unbound probe, and counterstained with 4',6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) or propidium iodide.|$|E

25|$|In some cases, a {{computer}} system may prescreen <b>the</b> <b>slides,</b> indicating {{those that do not}} need examination by a person or highlighting areas for special attention. The sample is then usually screened by a specially trained and qualified cytotechnologist using a light microscope. The terminology for who screens the sample varies according to the country; in the UK, the personnel are known as cytoscreeners, biomedical scientists (BMS), advanced practitioners and pathologists. The latter two take responsibility for reporting the abnormal sample which may require further investigation.|$|E
25|$|In a {{study of}} Richards and Gross (1999) and Tiwari (2013), {{participants}} viewed slides of injured men that produced increases in negative emotions, while information concerning each man was presented orally with his slide. The participants were assigned to either an expressive suppression group (where {{they were asked to}} refrain from showing emotion while watching <b>the</b> <b>slides)</b> or to a control group (where they were not given regulatory instructions at all). As predicted by the researchers, suppressors showed significantly worse performance on a memory test for the orally presented information.|$|E
5000|$|Because sliding mode {{control laws}} are not continuous, it {{has the ability to}} drive trajectories to <b>the</b> <b>sliding</b> mode in finite time (i.e., {{stability}} of <b>the</b> <b>sliding</b> surface is better than asymptotic). However, once the trajectories reach <b>the</b> <b>sliding</b> surface, <b>the</b> system takes on the character of <b>the</b> <b>sliding</b> mode (e.g., <b>the</b> origin [...] may only have asymptotic stability on this surface).|$|R
5|$|The action {{could not}} be opened until a slight forward {{movement}} of <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> handle released <b>the</b> action <b>slide</b> lock. In firing, the recoil of the shotgun gave a slight forward motion to <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> handle and released <b>the</b> action <b>slide</b> lock which enabled immediate opening of the action.

Sullenberger advised the ferry crews to rescue {{those on the}} wings first, {{as they were in}} more jeopardy than those on <b>the</b> <b>slides,</b> which detached to become life rafts. As the plane drifted, passengers on one slide, fearing that the boat would crush them, shouted for it to steer away. The last person was taken from the plane at 3:55 pm.|$|E
25|$|A four-slide {{is quite}} {{different}} from most other presses. The key of the machine is its moving slides that have tools attached, which strike the workpiece together or in sequence to form it. These slides are driven by four shafts that outline the machine. The shafts are connected by bevel gears so that one shaft is driven by an electric motor, and then that shaft's motion drives the other three shafts. Each shaft then has cams which drive <b>the</b> <b>slides,</b> usually of a split-type. This shafting arrangement allows the workpiece to be worked for four sides, which makes this machine extremely versatile. A hole {{near the center of the}} machine is provided to expel the completed workpiece.|$|E
25|$|On 5 February 2010, {{heavy rains}} and hail caused {{flooding}} and mudslides in the region, with Angangueo being hard hit. Landslides {{on two of}} the hills surrounding the town buried sections and blocked roads. The week prior a smaller slide had killed three miners. <b>The</b> <b>slides</b> forced the evacuation of hundreds, due to the danger of more slides. The Topos de Tlatelolco assisted with the search for survivors and bodies. At least 1,000 persons were made homeless and moved to a shelter in San José del Rincón, Mexico State. Many houses built on the riverbanks were swept away. At least thirty were killed by the event in the town alone. Bodies were found in the municipal seat and in smaller communities such as Salitre. 2,500 people lost everything in the disaster.|$|E
50|$|Whereas the {{majority}} of treatises indicate <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> is to begin on the beat, Donington notes that Johann Gottfried Walther (1708) believed <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> should occur prior to the beat. Frederick Neumann (in 1973) indicates {{that any of the}} 3 notes of a 3-note slide could occur on the beat, but did not cite any sources to support this. By 1993, he stated that <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> could occur only before or on the beat (i.e. the last note of <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> on <b>the</b> beat, or the first note of <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> on <b>the</b> beat).|$|R
50|$|The Ahole Holua Complex is a holua slide {{located on}} Ahole Bay on the {{southwest}} {{side of the island}} of Hawaii. <b>The</b> <b>slide</b> was used in the Native Hawaiian sport of holua, in which upper-class men raced toboggans down lava slides covered in slippery grasses. Stone platforms along the side of <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> allowed spectators to watch <b>the</b> races. <b>The</b> <b>slide</b> consists of a 60 m slope and a 23 m runway; the slope and length of <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> indicate that <b>the</b> Native Hawaiians had developed advanced engineering skills. <b>The</b> <b>slide</b> is among <b>the</b> best-preserved holua <b>slides</b> in Hawaii.|$|R
50|$|On most designs, {{once the}} {{magazine}} and chamber both are empty, <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> will lock back, released only when <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> stop is depressed; if a new magazine is inserted before <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> stop is depressed then a new cartridge will be chambered.|$|R
25|$|Cells from bone marrow, blood, amniotic fluid, cord blood, tumor, and tissues (including skin, {{umbilical}} cord, chorionic villi, liver, {{and many}} other organs) can be cultured using standard cell culture techniques {{in order to increase}} their number. A mitotic inhibitor (colchicine, colcemid) is then added to the culture. This stops cell division at mitosis which allows an increased yield of mitotic cells for analysis. The cells are then centrifuged and media and mitotic inhibitor are removed, and replaced with a hypotonic solution. This causes the white blood cells or fibroblasts to swell so that the chromosomes will spread when added to a slide as well as lyses the red blood cells. After the cells have been allowed to sit in hypotonic solution, Carnoy's fixative (3:1 methanol to glacial acetic acid) is added. This kills the cells and hardens the nuclei of the remaining white blood cells. The cells are generally fixed repeatedly to remove any debris or remaining red blood cells. The cell suspension is then dropped onto specimen slides. After aging <b>the</b> <b>slides</b> in an oven or waiting a few days they are ready for banding and analysis.|$|E
25|$|Super Speed Water Slides: These two water slides, {{also known}} as Geronimo Falls, were set {{slightly}} {{apart from the rest}} of the park and took advantage of nearly vertical slopes to allow riders to attain higher speeds than usually possible. One started with riders going almost vertically downwards and was covered with screening for the first several feet. As barriers on the side of <b>the</b> <b>slides</b> were very low, lifeguards reminded every user to remain flat on their back with their arms at their side as they descended, since there was no way to ride it otherwise and stay on. The fall from both slides had the potential for very serious injury. Those who made it to the bottom found their progress arrested by water—which made a large splash—and then a small pool. Only one of these slides remains today, however the track was replaced with one that was not as steep. The tracks the old slides followed are still visible. Today it is known as the H-2-Oh-No. Vertigo and Vortex, two adjacent enclosed tube slides still use the same end splash pool that 2 of the other old speed slides used.|$|E
