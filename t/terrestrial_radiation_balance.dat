The space shuttle solid-fuelled booster rockets emit ∼ 150 tonnes of alumina (Al 2 O 3) particles per launch, much of which spreads throughout the upper troposphere and stratosphere 1. Such particles can seed aerosols and clouds, and might therefore cause changes in the <b>terrestrial</b> <b>radiation</b> <b>balance</b> and climate 2. Estimates are made here showing that average ice nuclei concentrations in the upper troposphere could increase by a factor of 2, and that an aluminium dust layer weighing up to 1, 000 tonnes might eventually form in the lower stratosphere. © 1982 Nature Publishing Group...|$|E

The paper proposes a one-dimensional model of the stratospheric aerosol layer, and it is used to compare aerosol theory with observational data. The model considers gaseous sulfur photochemistry and the physical aerosol processes of nucleation, coagulation, sedimentation, and diffusion. Calculations of the effects on the aerosol layer of stratospheric injections of aluminum oxide particles by Space Shuttle engines and of sulfur dioxide molecules by volcanic activity are performed. The relation between measured aerosol variability and changes in stratospheric air temperatures and vertical transport rates are discussed...|$|E

The stratospheric aerosols are perturbed by volcanic injection of SO 2 and ash, by aircraft injection of SO 2, by rocket exhaust of Al 2 O 3 and by tropospheric mixing of particles and pollutant SO 2 and COS. In order to assess the effects of these perturbations on climate, the effects of the aerosols on the <b>radiation</b> <b>balance</b> must be understood and in order to understand the radiation effects the properties of the aerosols must be known.

40|$|Globally, {{forest fires}} are {{considered}} {{as one of the}} major drivers of climate change, altering the <b>terrestrial</b> ecosystems and <b>radiation</b> <b>balance</b> of the earth-atmospheric system through high carbon emissions, emissions of trace gases, aerosols and black carbon into the atmosphere (Balch et al. 2010). The current study presents the impact of air temperature variation on forest fire occurrences in Central Indian region during 2003 - 2010. The decadal (2001 - 2010) fire events in Central India were analysed in relation to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) derived Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Land Surface Temperature (LST) and interpolated air temperature data from Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) to characterise the regional impact of climate on fire occurrences. The study shows the exponential relation of fire with LST and rise in air temperature. There exists an inverse relation between spatial patterns of fire and EVI, which represents the intra-annual variability in fire incidences during the summer season in Central Indian region. Majority of the fire incidences are recoded in the March month of every year with highest rank in the year 2009. The linear regression relation of forest fire density and decadal mean temperature has been applied to simulate the probable fire vulnerable zones for the 2020 s decade using projected temperature spatial layer from IPCC HaDCM 3 (Hadley Centre Coupled Model, version 3) data. 1...|$|R
40|$|The global <b>radiation</b> <b>balance</b> of the {{atmosphere}} is still poorly observed, particularly at the surface. We investigate the observed <b>radiation</b> <b>balance</b> at (1) the surface using the ARM Mobile Facility in Niamey, Niger, and (2) the top of {{the atmosphere}} (TOA) over West Africa using data from the Geostationary Earth Radiation Budget (GERB) instrument on board Meteosat- 8. Observed radiative fluxes are compared with predictions from the global numerical weather prediction (NWP) version of the Met Office Unified Model (MetUM). The evaluation points to major shortcomings in the NWP model's radiative fluxes during the dry season (December 2005 to April 2006) arising from (1) a lack of absorbing aerosol in the model (mineral dust and biomass burning aerosol) and (2) a poor specification of the surface albedo. A case study of the major Saharan dust outbreak of 6 – 12 March 2006 is used to evaluate a parameterization of mineral dust for use in the NWP models. The model shows good predictability of the large-scale flow out to 4 – 5 days with the dust parameterization providing reasonable dust uplift, spatial distribution, and temporal evolution for this strongly forced dust event. The direct radiative impact of the dust reduces net downward shortwave (SW) flux at the surface (TOA) by a maximum of 200 W m− 2 (150 W m− 2), with a SW heating of the atmospheric column. The impacts of dust on <b>terrestrial</b> <b>radiation</b> are smaller. Comparisons of TOA (surface) <b>radiation</b> <b>balance</b> with GERB (ARM) show the “dusty” forecasts reduce biases in the radiative fluxes and improve surface temperatures and vertical thermodynamic structure...|$|R

Substantial differences in the <b>radiation</b> <b>balance</b> among the various types of surface were observed. The observations carried out in the summer seasons of 2010 – 2014 in the area of Kaffiøyra demonstrated that the considerable reflection of solar radiation on the Waldemar Glacier (albedo 55 %) resulted in a smaller solar energy net income. During the polar day, a diurnal course of the components of the <b>radiation</b> <b>balance</b> was apparently related to the solar elevation angle.

40|$|Deforestation in the Amazon {{region will}} {{initially}} impact the energy balance at the land surface through changes in land cover and surface hydrology. However, continuation of this human activity will {{eventually lead to}} atmospheric feedbacks, including changes in cloudiness which may {{play an important role}} in the final equilibrium of solar and <b>terrestrial</b> <b>radiation</b> at the surface. In this study, the different components of surface radiation over an undisturbed forest in the Amazon region are computed using data from the Amazon region micrometerological experiment (ARME). Several measures of cloudiness are defined: two estimated from the <b>terrestrial</b> <b>radiation</b> measurements, and one from the solar radiation measurements. The sensitivity of the surface fluxes of solar and <b>terrestrial</b> <b>radiation</b> to natural variability in cloudiness is investigated to infer the potential role of the cloudiness feedback in the surface energy balance. The results of this analysis indicate that a 1 % decrease in cloudiness would increase net solar radiation by ca. 1. 6 W/m 2. However, the overall magnitude of this feedback, due to total deforestation of the Amazon forest, is likely to be of the same order as the magnitude of the decrease in net solar radiation due to the observed increase in surface albedo following deforestation. Hence, the total change in net solar radiation is likely to have a negligible magnitude. In contrast to this conclusion, we find that <b>terrestrial</b> <b>radiation</b> is likely to be more strongly affected; reduced cloudiness will decrease net terrestrial radiation; a 1 % decrease in cloudiness induces a reduction i...|$|R

40|$|A new {{parameterization}} {{of solar}} and <b>terrestrial</b> <b>radiation</b> {{was developed and}} tested. The solar radiation parameterization is based on that of Lacis and Hansen (1974), but with zenith-angle-dependent surface albedoes, and revised treatments of cloudiness. The <b>terrestrial</b> <b>radiation</b> parameterization {{is based on the}} work of Chou (1984) for water vapor, Chou and Peng (1983) for carbon dioxide, and Rogers (1968) for ozone, with a new parameterization of the effects of clouds. Results obtained were compared with the new parameterizations to those obtained with the earlier parameterization described by Schlessinger (1976). Several dramatic improvements came to light. For the most part these are related to the fact that the new <b>terrestrial</b> <b>radiation</b> paramerization includes the effects of the water vapor continuum, while the earlier parameterization does not. In the moist tropical planetary boundary layer (PBL) continuum emission leads to much stronger cooling of the PBL over the oceans. Over land, however, the cooling of the PBL is significantly reduced. The latter, somewhat paradoxical result is due to the strong diurnal cycle of the continental PBL. At night the shallow continental PBL is overlain by a moist layer created by mixing during the previous afternoon. The moist upper layer acts as a radiative blanket, reducing the time-averaged radiative cooling of the continental PBL...|$|R

40|$|Saharan Dust Experiment (SHADE) {{are used}} to {{quantify}} {{the effect of a}} strong dust outbreak on radiance and brightness temperatures. The dust gives a distinct spectral signature in upwelling and downwelling <b>terrestrial</b> <b>radiation</b> when high spectral resolution data for a dusty day is compared to data from a clear day. A radiative transfer model is used together with a size distribution retrieved from Sun photometers and atmospheric profiles from dropsondes to simulate the radiance data and provide a constraint on the refractive indices of Saharan dust in the terrestrial part of the spectrum. The degree of agreement between observed and simulated brightness temperatures is dominated by the choice of refractive index, the mass loading, and the altitude of the dust layer. The uncertainties in size distribution appear to have less of an effect so long as large particles (radius greater than 1 mm) are included. In the terrestrial spectrum the dust produced a relative warming rate of up to 0. 5 K/day below the dust and a relative cooling of up to 0. 5 K/day within the dust layer itself.
