5|$|Astronomers hypothesized, {{based on}} its {{interior}} chemistry, that the comet formed in the Uranus and Neptune Oort cloud region of the Solar System.

5|$|The type {{species of}} this genus is Brancasaurus brancai, first named by Theodor Wegner in 1914 {{in honor of}} German {{paleontologist}} Wilhelm von Branca.

While traditionally considered as a basal member of the Elasmosauridae, Brancasaurus has more recently been recovered as a member, or close relative, of the Leptocleididae, a group containing many other freshwater plesiosaurs.|$|E
5|$|An eagle’s {{appearance}} in the sky when thunderclouds threatened was greeted with joy and hope by people who trusted {{in their power to}} defeat an ala; after defeating the ala, the eagle led the clouds away from the fields. An explanation for this, recorded in eastern Serbia, is that the eagles which nest in the vicinity of a village want thunderstorms and hail as far as possible from their nestlings, so coincidentally protect the village’s fields as well. The role of eagles, however, was controversial, because in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>region</b> there was a belief that an eagle flying in front of thunderstorm clouds was a manifestation of an ala, leading the clouds toward the crops, rather than driving them away.|$|E

5|$|Around 10:00pm {{local time}} on 4January, {{the centre of}} Tropical Cyclone Helen made {{landfall}} near Channel Point. As it moved ashore, the storm developed an eye; however, this feature began breaking apart once overland and the eyewall merged into the system's feeder bands. Roughly 12hours after landfall, Helen weakened to a tropical low before moving over the Gulf of Carpentaria late on 5January. Due {{to an increase in}} forward motion, the system was unable to regenerate sufficient convection to be reclassified a tropical cyclone before making a second landfall along the Cape York Peninsula. Once overland again, the remnants of Helen abruptly slowed and were last noted on 7January in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>region.</b>|$|E
5|$|Astronomers {{originally}} {{supposed that}} the entire trans-Neptunian population would show a similar red surface colour, as they were thought to have originated in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>region</b> and subjected to the same physical processes. Specifically, SDOs were expected to have large amounts of surface methane, chemically altered into complex organic molecules by energy from the Sun. This would absorb blue light, creating a reddish hue. Most classical objects display this colour, but scattered objects do not; instead, they present a white or greyish appearance.|$|E
5|$|Fady can {{not only}} help protect lemurs and their forests under stable {{socioeconomic}} situations, {{but they can also}} lead to discrimination and persecution if a lemur is known to bring bad fortune, for instance, if it walks through town. In other ways, fady does not protect all lemurs equally. For example, although the hunting and eating of certain species may be taboo, other species may not share that same protection and are therefore targeted instead. Fady can vary from village to village within <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>region.</b> If people move to a new village or region, their fady may not apply to the lemur species that are locally present, making them available for consumption. Fady restrictions on lemur meat can be relaxed in times of famine and drought.|$|E
