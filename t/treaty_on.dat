For this purpose we employ a numerically solvable general equilibrium model of trade and multinational firms to study the impact of tax <b>treaties</b> <b>on</b> both welfare and outward FDI. The model indicates under which factor endowment configurations countries gain in welfare when implementing a tax treaty. This motivates an empirical specification of the endogenous selection into implementing new tax treaties. Using data of bilateral OECD outward FDI between 1985 and 2000, we find a significant negative impact of newly implemented tax <b>treaties</b> <b>on</b> outward FDI stocks. ...|$|R

5|$|Hamilton {{formulated}} the Jay Treaty {{to normalize}} {{trade relations with}} Great Britain, remove them from western forts, and resolve financial debts remaining from the Revolution; John Jay negotiated and signed the <b>treaty</b> <b>on</b> November 19, 1794. Jeffersonians supported France and strongly attacked the treaty. Washington listened to both sides, then announced his strong support, which mobilized public opinion and was pivotal in securing ratification in the Senate on June 24, 1795 by the requisite two-thirds majority.|$|E
5|$|In 1633 Koniecpolski thwarted the Turks' {{attacks on}} the Commonwealth, {{defeating}} their forces on 4 July at Sasowy Róg. On 22 October that year, he repulsed a superior invading Ottoman force of over 20,000 at Kamianets-Podilskyi, his own forces numbering a mere 11,000. The Ottoman defeats and Koniecpolski's attitude persuaded the Turks to sign a new <b>treaty</b> <b>on</b> 19 August 1634. The treaty repeated {{the terms of the}} Treaty of Chocim of 1621 and ended the Ottoman–Commonwealth War (1633–34).|$|E

5|$|On 16 June, the Allied Powers {{demanded that}} Germany unconditionally sign the treaty within seven days or face the {{resumption}} of hostilities. The German government was divided on whether to sign or reject the peace <b>treaty.</b> <b>On</b> 19 June, Chancellor Philipp Scheidemann resigned rather than sign the treaty and was followed by Brockdorff-Rantzau {{and other members of}} the government, leaving Germany without a cabinet or peace delegation. After being advised by Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg that Germany was in no condition to resume the war, President Friedrich Ebert and the new Chancellor, Gustav Bauer, recommended that the Weimar National Assembly ratify the treaty. The Assembly did so by a large majority, and Clemenceau was informed nineteen minutes before the deadline expired. Germany unconditionally signed the peace <b>treaty</b> <b>on</b> 22 June.|$|E

It has since signed and ratified the <b>Treaty</b> <b>on</b> the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Switzerland never possessed biological or chemical weapons.|$|E
