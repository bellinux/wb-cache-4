It was alarming that a socialist-mixed-economy state could do in a few short months what the Somoza dynasty, a U.S. client state, could not do in 45 years! It was truly alarming that the Sandinistas were intent on providing the very services that establish a government's political and moral legitimacy.|$|E
25|$|The foul strike {{rule was}} a major rule change <b>that,</b> <b>in</b> <b>just</b> a few years, sent {{baseball}} from a high-scoring game to a game where scoring any runs was a struggle. Prior to this rule, foul balls did not count as strikes. Thus, a batter could foul off a countless number of pitches with no strikes counted against him—except for bunt attempts. This gave the batter an enormous advantage. In 1901, the National League adopted the foul strike rule, and the American League followed suit in 1903.|$|E

25|$|Once the rebellions {{had been}} put down, Abu Bakr began a war of conquest. Whether or not he {{intended}} a full-out imperial conquest is hard to say; he did, however, {{set in motion a}} historical trajectory <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>just</b> a few short decades would lead to one of the largest empires in history. Abu Bakr began with Iraq, the richest province of the Sasanian Empire. He sent general Khalid ibn Walid to invade the Sasanianan Empire in 633. He thereafter also sent four armies to invade the Roman province of Syria, but the decisive operation was only undertaken when Khalid, after completing the conquest of Iraq, was transferred to the Syrian front in 634.|$|E
25|$|When in 1551 the {{mismanagement}} of Sir William Dansell, King's Merchant to the Low Countries, {{had caused the}} English Government much financial embarrassment, the authorities called Gresham for advice, thereafter following his proposals. Gresham advocated the adoption of various methods– highly ingenious, but quite arbitrary and unfair— for raising {{the value of the}} pound sterling on the bourse of Antwerp which proved so successful <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>just</b> a few years King Edward VI had discharged almost all of his debts. The Government sought Gresham's advice in all their money difficulties, and also frequently employed him in various diplomatic missions. He had no stated salary, but in reward of his services received from King Edward various grants of lands, the annual value of which at that time amounted ultimately to about 400 pounds a year.|$|E
25|$|Abu Bakr's Caliphate {{lasted for}} 27 months, {{during which he}} crushed the {{rebellion}} of the Arab tribes throughout the Arabian Peninsula in the successful Ridda Wars. In {{the last months of}} his rule, he sent general Khalid ibn al-Walid on conquests against the Sassanid Empire in Mesopotamia and against the Byzantine Empire in Syria. This would set in motion a historical trajectory (continued later on by Umar and Uthman ibn Affan) <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>just</b> a few short decades would lead to one of the largest empires in history. He had little time {{to pay attention to the}} administration of state, though state affairs remained stable during his Caliphate. On the advice of Umar and Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah he agreed to have a salary from state treasury and abolish his cloth trade.|$|E

25|$|On {{that same}} day in 1873, the Cortes proclaimed the First Spanish Republic. However, the Republic fell victim to the same instabilities {{provoked}} by the ongoing wars and the division amongst republicans. The majority of republicans were federalists, and they therefore supported {{the formation of a}} federal democratic republic, {{but there was also a}} unitary republic school. What is more, within the federalists there was an intransigent pro-confederation sector that was infuriated and later quashed by the Cantonal Revolution of 1873. The complicated political situation is demonstrated by the fact <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>just</b> eleven months there were four presidents of the Republic: Francesc Pi i Margall, Estanislao Figueras, Nicolás Salmerón, and Emilio Castelar (the only non-federalist president). On January 3, 1874, General Manuel Pavía led a coup d'état that established a conservative unitary republican dictatorship under the command of General Francisco Serrano y Domínguez. The dictatorship was in turn ousted by pronunciamiento on December 29, 1874, in which Brigadier General Arsenio Martínez Campos declared the Bourbon Restoration and Alfonso XII ascended to the throne.|$|E
500|$|Mary {{is remembered}} {{in the 21st century}} for her {{vigorous}} efforts to restore Roman Catholicism after Edward's short-lived crusade to minimize Catholicism in England. Protestant historians have long denigrated her reign, emphasizing <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>just</b> five years she burned several hundred Protestants {{at the stake}} in the Marian persecutions. In the mid-20th century, H. F. M. Prescott attempted to redress the tradition that Mary was intolerant and authoritarian by writing more objectively, and scholarship since then has tended to view the older, simpler, partisan assessments of Mary with greater scepticism. An historiographical revisionism since the 1980s has to some degree improved her reputation among scholars. Christopher Haigh argued that her revival of religious festivities and Catholic practices was generally welcomed. Haigh concluded that the [...] "last years of Mary's reign were not a gruesome preparation for Protestant victory, but a continuing consolidation of Catholic strength." ...|$|E

[...] John Payne of The Washington Post wrote, [...] "Depending on your point of view, Terra Nova is either a stripped-down Mechwarrior or a souped-up Doom." [...] However, he stated that it was enjoyable regardless of which perspective was taken. While he described the game's animation as [...] "fluid", he found its graphics in general to be [...] "fairly blocky, even at a distance". He finished his review by stating that the game [...] "requires more practice than action fans are used to" [...] but provides [...] "a nice payoff". Next Generation Magazine wrote, [...] "Looking Glass has always been known for breaking the barriers of conventional gameplay, and it has done it again with Terra Nova". The magazine considered the game to be [...] "an all around stunning effort".|$|E

2500|$|In 2012, NASA {{researchers}} Metzger, Muscatello, Mueller, and Mantovani {{argued for}} a bootstrapping approach to start self-replicating factories in space. They developed this concept {{on the basis of}} In Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) technologies that NASA has been developing to [...] "live off the land" [...] on the Moon or Mars. Their modeling showed <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>just</b> 20 to 40 years this industry could become self-sufficient then grow to large size, enabling greater exploration in space as well as providing benefits back to Earth. In 2014, Thomas Kalil of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy published on the White House blog an interview with Metzger on bootstrapping solar system civilization through self-replicating space industry. Kalil requested the public submit ideas for how [...] "the Administration, the private sector, philanthropists, the research community, and storytellers can further these goals." [...] Kalil connected this concept to what former NASA Chief technologist Mason Peck has dubbed [...] "Massless Exploration", the ability to make everything in space so that you do not need to launch it from Earth. Peck has said, [...] "...all the mass we need to explore the solar system is already in space. It's just in the wrong shape." [...] In 2016, Metzger argued that fully self-replicating industry can be started over several decades by astronauts at a lunar outpost for a total cost (outpost plus starting the industry) of {{about a third of the}} space budgets of the International Space Station partner nations, and that this industry would solve Earth's energy and environmental problems in addition to providing massless exploration.|$|E
2500|$|Over {{the course}} of her essay, Clark {{considers}} the question of what makes a piece of literature a classic and why the idea of [...] "the classics" [...] is important to society as a whole. Clark says that [...] "teachers of English have been so long trained in the 'classics' that these 'classics' have become to them very much like the Bible, for the safety of which the rise of modern science causes such unnecessary fears." [...] She {{goes on to say that}} among the sources she consulted was a group of eighth-graders when she asked them the question: [...] "What do you understand by the classics in literature?" [...] Two of the answers Clark received were [...] "Classics are books your fathers give you and you keep them to give to your children" [...] and [...] "Classics are those great pieces of literature considered worthy to be studied in English classes of high school or college". Calvino agrees with the Ohio educator when he states [...] "Schools and universities ought to help us understand that no book that talks about a book says more than the book in question, but instead they do their level best to make us think the opposite." [...] Clark and Calvino come to a similar conclusion that when a literary work is analyzed for what makes it 'classic', <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>just</b> the act of analysis or as Clark says [...] "the anatomical dissection", the reader can end up destroying the unique pleasure that mere enjoyment a work of literature can hold.|$|E
2500|$|After the action, Lieutenant-Colonel J. F. C. Fuller wrote a {{memorandum}} Minor Tank and Infantry Operations against Strong Points, [...] in which combined conventional minor tactics with {{the methods used}} by the Tank Corps that had succeeded during the battles around Ypres, published on 23 August and influential in {{the adoption of the}} [...] "Single File Drill". In 1919, Williams-Ellis and Williams-Ellis wrote that the action was memorable and that a German officer had been found hanged by his men in one of the strongpoints. In 1931, Gough called the attack a [...] "very successful little operation...." [...] In 1995, J. P. Harris called the attack on the pillboxes [...] "One brilliant little feat of arms....", which justified Haig's decision to keep some tanks in Flanders, even after the heavy rains began in August; in 2008 Harris described the operation as [...] "brilliant" [...] and [...] "amazingly low cost". In 1996, Prior and Wilson wrote <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>just</b> over two hours Maxe's [...] "novel stratagem" [...] had captured five formidable fortified posts but the method was not feasible in most of the salient. On 22 August, XVIII Corps attacked with tanks again but the objectives were too far from the roads and the tanks ditched when the crews tried to drive closer. In 2014, R. A. Perry wrote that the operation was spectacularly successful but that it created unrealistic expectations of what the tanks could do. In 2017, Nick Lloyd wrote that the action had been [...] "a remarkable exercise in ingenuity and imagination" [...] and that the success raised the morale of the Tank Corps.|$|E
