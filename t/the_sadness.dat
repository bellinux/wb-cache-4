5|$|<b>The</b> <b>sadness</b> of {{the harsh}} {{conditions}} {{of those days}} is captured by the simple epitaph on the gravestone of James Myers who is buried in the Methodist Cemetery at Yeadon behind the Town Hall. James was a married man just 22 years old who 'died by an accident in the Bramhope Tunnel on the 14th day of April, 1848'. Next to him lies the body of his 3 years old daughter who died two weeks later of some unspecified illness.|$|E
5|$|In later life, she {{eventually}} adopted more conventional behaviour, took up pious works and even reformed the convent that became her second {{residence in the}} Paris suburbs. As {{the years went by}} she suffered serious setbacks to her health and <b>the</b> <b>sadness</b> of mourning her eldest son, Grand Prince Ferdinando, for whom she had had a genuine affection. Rendered financially independent by a legacy, she purchased a house in Paris, from which she spent {{the end of her life}} dispensing charity and keeping up dignified correspondence.|$|E
25|$|Patriotic {{folk songs}} are common, mostly written during {{the wars of}} Israel. They {{typically}} concern themselves with soldiers' friendships and <b>the</b> <b>sadness</b> of death during war. Some are now played at memorials or holidays dedicated to the Israeli dead.|$|E

25|$|The film is {{dedicated}} to director/screenwriter Jim Sheridan's brother Frankie, who {{died at the age}} of ten. In The Making of in America, a featurette on the DVD release of the film, Sheridan explains Christy and Ariel are based on his daughters (and co-writers) Naomi and Kirsten. He says they wanted to make a film showing how people can learn to overcome their pain and live for the future instead of dwelling on <b>the</b> <b>sadness</b> of the past.|$|E

25|$|Some specialists say {{the word}} may have {{originated}} during the Great Portuguese Discoveries, giving meaning to <b>the</b> <b>sadness</b> felt about those who departed on journeys to unknown seas and disappeared in shipwrecks, died in battle, or simply never returned. Those who stayed behind—mostly women and children—suffered deeply in their absence. However, the Portuguese discoveries only started in 1415 and since the word {{has been found in}} earlier texts, this does not constitute a very good explanation. The Reconquista also offers a plausible explanation.|$|E
25|$|Two rows of {{furnaces}} on {{each side}} were fired up; the effect was not unlike the description of Vulcan's forge, except that the Cyclops were animated with a divine spark, whereas the dusky servants of the English furnaces were joyless, silent and benumbed.... The foreman told me that stokers were selected from among the strongest, but that nevertheless they all became consumptive after {{seven or eight years}} of toil and died of pulmonary consumption. That explained <b>the</b> <b>sadness</b> and apathy in the faces and every movement of the hapless men.|$|E
25|$|This play is {{loosely based}} {{on the lives of}} Friel's mother and aunts who lived in Glenties, on the west coast of Donegal. Set in the summer of 1936, the play depicts the late summer days when love briefly seems {{possible}} for three of the Mundy sisters (Chris, Rose, and Kate) and the family welcomes home the frail elder brother, who has returned from a life as a missionary in Africa. However, as the summer ends, the family foresees <b>the</b> <b>sadness</b> and economic privations under which they will suffer as all hopes fade.|$|E

25|$|The body found beside Alistair in the {{original}} investigation was not that of his wife, but that of Dorothea; Margaret had died a month earlier {{at the hands of}} her sister, who fatally injured her as part of a psychotic episode. Before she died, she made her husband promise to protect her sister from arrest, to which both he and Zélie concealed the truth by planting Margaret's body {{at the foot of a}} cliff and fabricating the story that it was Dorothea who had died. Dorothea then took her sister's place. While she fooled the servants easily, she could not fool the Ravenscrofts' dog, which could distinguish between the sisters, thus explaining why it bit her. A month later, Alistair murdered her to prevent her from injuring anyone else, making certain she held the revolver before she was killed, and then committed suicide afterwards. Desmond and Celia recognise <b>the</b> <b>sadness</b> of the true events, but now knowing the facts are able to face a future together.|$|E
25|$|In December 2013 in a blog {{article for}} The Spectator website {{published}} shortly after Nelson Mandela died, Rod Liddle wrote of BBC coverage: But for Christ's sake BBC, {{give it a}} bloody break for five minutes, will you? It's as if the poor bugger now has to bear your entire self-flagellating white post-colonial bien pensant guilt; look! Famous nice black man dies! Let's re-run {{the entire history of}} South Africa. That's better than watching the country we're in being flattened by a storm. He also wrote:Look; I'm sorry Nelson Mandela is dead. It happens quite often to people in their 90s who have been very ill, even famous people, but I'm sure that doesn't lessen <b>the</b> <b>sadness</b> for many of us. I never met the man but, on balance, I {{came to the conclusion that}} he was a force for good rather than ill. I think I came to that rather banal and broad brush conclusion twenty years ago, or maybe fifteen. So, I'm sorry he's dead, I wish it were otherwise.|$|E

500|$|Later in 1894, Parry and {{his wife}} hoped {{a trip to the}} US would help ease some of <b>the</b> <b>sadness</b> over the deaths of their two sons. [...] Parry had last visited the United States on a vocal concert tour in 1880. Though the Parrys would be visiting family, he {{believed}} he should be available to the public during the visit since many people in the US had helped him financially when he was studying music in England.|$|E

The same Kiowa chief who had supervised the torture and burning of captives went about converting his own people to Christ. There were days, he would proudly recount his cruel acts against the white man, although it is faithfully recorded that he always concluded those tales with the solemn note that God had forgiven him for those [...] "hideous" [...] acts.|$|E

Murphy from Variety felt American Graffiti was a vivid [...] "recall of teenage attitudes and morals, told with outstanding empathy and compassion through an exceptionally talented cast of unknown actors". Dave Kehr, writing in the Chicago Reader, called the film a brilliant work of popular art that redefined nostalgia as a marketable commodity, while establishing a new narrative style.|$|E

Ruud Lubbers, then UNHCR High Commissioner, expressed <b>the</b> <b>sadness</b> of the UNHCR and the entire humanitarian community, commenting that [...] "he left an indelible print on UNHCR's history—leading the agency through some of the most challenging moments.

Hillary Frey of The New York Observer opined that Jenny provided [...] "voyeuristic pleasure" [...] for straight females in season one. She said she believed Jenny's confusion to whom she should be with was plausible. Also adding the fact she gradually became self-obsessed – yet still conveyed the [...] "thrill and pleasure of a fresh sexual experience", while portraying <b>the</b> <b>sadness.</b>|$|E
