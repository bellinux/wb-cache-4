5|$|Amargasaurus is {{classified}} {{as a member of}} the Dicraeosauridae, a family ranked clade within the Diplodocoidea. Currently, this clade consists of five species belonging to four genera. These are, besides Amargasaurus cazaui, the species Dicraeosaurus hansemanni and Dicraeosaurus sattleri from the Late Jurassic Tendaguru beds of Tanzania, as well as Brachytrachelopan mesai from the Late Jurassic of Argentina. Whitlock (2011) argued that Suuwassea emilieae from the Morrison Formation of <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> be placed inside the Dicraeosauridae as well, which was supported by subsequent studies. Amargasaurus is the only named dicraeosaurid from the Cretaceous; an unnamed specimen from Brazil indicates that this group persisted until the end of the Early Cretaceous. Most analyses find Dicraeosaurus and Brachytrachelopan to be more closely related to each other than to Amargasaurus. Suuwassea was recovered as the most basal member of the family. A 2015 analysis by Tschopp and colleagues came to the preliminary result that two poorly known genera from the Morrison Formation, Dyslocosaurus polyonychius and Dystrophaeus viaemalae, might be additional members of the Dicraeosauridae.|$|E

50|$|On August 14, 2013, {{a federal}} court granted the Office of the General Prosecutor (Spanish: Procuraduría General de la República, PGR) an arrest warrant against Caro Quintero after the United States {{government}} issued a petition to the Mexican government. Once the Mexican authorities re-arrest Quintero, the U.S. government has a maximum limit of 60 days to present a formal extradition request. Mexico's Attorney General clarified, however, that if arrested, Caro Quintero cannot be extradited to the United States {{for the murder of}} Camarena because Mexican law prohibits criminals from being tried for the same crime in another country. U.S. lawyers, nonetheless, may argue that Quintero's initial trial was illegitimate {{in the first place and}} that double jeopardy is not applicable. In order for Caro Quintero's extradition to be accepted by Mexico, <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> present other criminal charges and accept that he would not face the death penalty if convicted because there are no laws for capital punishment in Mexico.

5000|$|On March 21, 2017, Seth G. Jones {{outlines}} an Afghanistan {{foreign policy}} {{strategy for the}} new Trump administration, in the article, “How Trump Should Manage Afghanistan: A Realistic Set of Goals for the New Administration.” (Jones) Jones describes that the current administration faces major issues in Afghanistan. The country is still a vital state in combating the war on terror. Jones discusses that the United States should have a realistic set of goals for Afghanistan. He states, “The United States should thus not expect the Afghan government to defeat the Taliban on the battlefield {{over the next four}} years of the administration. Instead, Washington should set a more realistic goal: to ensure that the Taliban doesn’t win. In order to do this, Washington could take several steps.” (Jones) Jones lays out two main areas the United States should focus on. First, the United States should continue to encourage for governance reform in the country. Past elections have been riddled with corruption. <b>The</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> push to make sure this does not happen. He also determined that the United States should encourage a “diplomatic reconciliation” with the Taliban. The next point Jones makes has to do with the amount of U.S. troops in Afghanistan. General Nicholson has requested, “several thousand additional troops.” (Jones) Jones concludes that this is a reasonable request.|$|E

China needs to contribute more than any other developing country and perhaps as much as industrial countries on market access for manufactured goods. To complete the Doha Round, US officials need Congress to extend trade promotion authority (TPA), but it won't do so unless the Bush administration demonstrates progress in trade talks. TPA is dead unless the Doha Round and big bilateral trade talks promise to deliver a substantial package of reforms in agriculture, manufactures, and services that create trade and investment opportunities for US firms, workers, and farmers. ...|$|E
40|$|This is a {{study of}} the impact of the United States drug-related de- {{certification}} upon the consolidation of democracy in Colombia. De-certification is one of the most powerful tools <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> focus international attention on the threat of narcotics and drug trafficking. This thesis argues that the de-certification decision made by the United States on March 1, 1996, in the short term undermines Colombian democracy. The de-certification is politically riented to oust the government of President Ernesto Samper Pizano. President Pizano was targeted because of the infiltration of illegal drug money in his presidential campaign. The de-certification did not accomplish its objective. On the contrary, it brought more instability to the country, made the social situation more volatile and the democracy weaker and more vulnerable. However, it is possible that in the long term de-certification could have a positive impact on Colombian democracy, by helping the state to develop a strong posture against corruption and the drug syndicates.
