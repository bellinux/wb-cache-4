5|$|As {{a result}} of the length of the election, during which three of the twenty cardinal-electors died and one resigned, Gregory X promulgated the apostolic {{constitution}} Ubi periculum on July 7 (or 16), 1274, during the Second Council of Lyon, establishing the papal conclave, whose rules were based on <b>the</b> <b>tactics</b> employed against the cardinals in Viterbo. The election itself is sometimes viewed as the first conclave.|$|E
5|$|During the {{previous}} winter, England had played Australia in the controversial Bodyline series {{in which the}} English bowlers were accused of bowling {{the ball on the}} line of leg stump. The deliveries were often short-pitched with four or five fielders close by on the leg side waiting to catch deflections off the bat. <b>The</b> <b>tactics</b> were difficult for batsmen to counter and were designed to be intimidatory. In the 1933 English season, Bodyline was a sensitive subject. There had already been controversy in the tourists' match against the MCC, during which Constantine and Manny Martindale, another West Indian fast bowler, were criticised in the press for bowling short. Frustrated by a slow pitch which he believed was intended to neutralise his fast bowlers, Grant had ordered Constantine to bowl Bodyline against Yorkshire, and decided to repeat <b>the</b> <b>tactics</b> in the second Test. The West Indies scored 375, of which Constantine made 31. When England replied, several batsmen were discomfited by the Bodyline bowling; Wally Hammond was struck on the chin and retired hurt. Constantine and Martindale bowled up to four short deliveries each over so that the ball rose to head height; occasionally they bowled around the wicket.|$|E
5|$|In September 1944, Nowotny {{was made}} {{commander}} of a specialist unit dubbed Kommando Nowotny, flying the newly developed Messerschmitt Me 262 out of airfields near Osnabrück. The unit {{not only had}} to contend with the enemy, but also with working through the 'teething' phase of the Me 262and developing <b>the</b> <b>tactics</b> appropriate for a jet unit. On 7 October, Nowotny downed a B-24 Liberator bomber, his first aerial victory on the Western Front.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>tactic</b> was {{proposed}} by General Maxime Weygand during the Battle of France in 1940. However, Allied forces in 1940 {{were unable to}} successfully apply <b>the</b> <b>tactic</b> before they sustained heavy losses and France capitulated. The remaining forces which did apply <b>the</b> <b>tactic</b> were simply bypassed.|$|R

50|$|While <b>the</b> <b>tactic</b> of <b>the</b> United Front {{was first}} adopted by ECCI in December 1921, the 4th World Congress is remembered to history for having {{extended}} and further institutionalized <b>the</b> <b>tactic.</b>|$|R
5|$|King and the SCLC {{put into}} {{practice}} many {{of the principles of}} the Christian Left and applied <b>the</b> <b>tactics</b> of nonviolent protest with great success by strategically choosing the method of protest and the places in which protests were carried out.

5|$|Martin Luther King Jr. (born Michael King Jr., January 15, 1929– April 4, 1968) was an American Baptist {{minister}} and activist {{who became the}} most visible spokesperson and leader in the Civil Rights Movement. He {{is best known for}} his role in the advancement of civil rights using <b>the</b> <b>tactics</b> of nonviolence and civil disobedience based on his Christian beliefs and inspired by the nonviolent activism of Mahatma Gandhi.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle is}} known through two {{detailed}} accounts, Anna Komnene's Alexiad, {{and her husband}} Nikephoros Bryennios the Younger's Material for History, on which Anna's own account relies to a large degree. It {{is one of the}} few Byzantine battles described in detail, and hence a valuable source for studying <b>the</b> <b>tactics</b> of the Byzantine army of the late 11th century.|$|E
50|$|C29 was {{involved}} in <b>the</b> U-boat trap <b>tactic.</b> <b>The</b> <b>tactic</b> was to use a decoy trawler to tow a submarine. When a U-boat was sighted, the tow line and communication line was slipped and the submarine would attack <b>the</b> U-boat. <b>The</b> <b>tactic</b> was partly successful, but was abandoned after the loss of two C-class submarines. In both cases, all the crew were lost. C29 {{was one of the}} two C class submarines sunk because of <b>the</b> <b>tactic.</b> She was mined when her trawler Ariadne strayed into a minefield in the Humber Estuary on 29 August 1915.|$|R

50|$|Hawthorn's {{dominant}} 1980s team used <b>the</b> <b>tactic</b> {{of running}} in waves using multiple handballs {{to draw the}} man, move the ball down the field and open holes in the attack {{in a similar way}} to rugby.

5|$|The battle {{resulted}} {{in the loss of}} the German torpedo boat squadron and prevented the mining of busy shipping lanes, such as the mouth of the River Thames. The British had few casualties and little damage to their vessels. The battle influenced <b>the</b> <b>tactics</b> and deployments of the remaining German torpedo boat flotillas in the North Sea area, as the loss shook the faith of their commanders in the effectiveness of the force.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>tactics</b> proved {{successful}} in the Canadian Wing. Johnson scored his 19—21 victories on 23 and 26 August, whilst claiming yet another Fw 190 on 4 September 1943. Johnsons 19th victory was gained against Oberfeldwebel (First-Sergeant) Erich Borounik 10./JG 26, who was killed. Johnson's 21st victim, Oberfeldwebel Walter Grunlinger 10./JG 26, was also killed.|$|E
5|$|Be Here Now is {{the third}} studio album by English rock band Oasis, {{released}} on 21 August 1997 by Creation Records. Oasis had achieved worldwide success with their 1994 debut album Definitely Maybe and 1995 follow up (What's the Story) Morning Glory? The third album was highly anticipated by both fans and music critics. Oasis' management company, Ignition, {{were aware of the}} dangers of overexposure, and before release sought to control the media's access to the album. The campaign included limiting pre-release radio airplay and forcing journalists to sign gag orders. <b>The</b> <b>tactics</b> resulted in the alienation of both the press and many industry personnel connected with the band, and fueled large-scale speculation and wide publicity within the British music scene.|$|E
50|$|Throughout the Cold War, <b>the</b> <b>tactic</b> was {{primarily}} utilized by media figures speaking {{on behalf of}} the Soviet Union. By accusing critics of hypocrisy, the Soviet Union hoped to deflect attention away from the original criticism itself. The term whataboutism was known locally the Soviet Union as a way to draw attention from criticism of Moscow. As <b>the</b> <b>tactic</b> became ubiquitous in the Soviet Union, whataboutism became known as a Soviet cliché. At the end of the Cold War, alongside U.S. civil rights reforms, <b>the</b> <b>tactic</b> began dying out.|$|R

5|$|England's bodyline tactics, which {{involved}} bowling at speeds of around 150km/h at the heads and torsoes of the Australian batsmen—including Woodfull—and employing a close leg-side cordon to catch balls fended {{away from the}} upper body, caused great controversy and ill-feeling among Australian players and crowds. England devised <b>the</b> <b>tactics</b> {{in an attempt to}} curb Donald Bradman, Australia's star batsman, whose average hovered around 100, around twice that of all other world-class batsman. However, they also hoped to restrict the other batsmen, Woodfull among them, through such means.|$|E
5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath, many people assumed Jack Fingleton, the only full-time journalist on either team, was responsible. This belief {{may have affected}} {{the course of his}} subsequent career. Fingleton later wrote that Donald Bradman, Australia's star batsman and the primary target of Bodyline, was the person who disclosed the story. Bradman always denied this, and continued to blame Fingleton; animosity between the pair continued {{for the rest of their}} lives. Woodfull's earlier public silence on <b>the</b> <b>tactics</b> had been interpreted as approval; the leak was significant in persuading the Australian public that Bodyline was unacceptable.|$|E
5|$|Many {{commentators}} and cricketers deplored {{the use of}} Bodyline bowling. Some felt {{frustration that}} Woodfull had not publicly condemned <b>the</b> <b>tactics,</b> believing that his silence was interpreted as approval. Once his opinions were revealed by the leak, opponents of Bodyline felt publicly legitimised and expressed their opinions more freely. It also revealed deep and unaccustomed divisions between the teams which had been kept from view. The leak and subsequent events in the same match brought varied opinions from journalists and former players on Bodyline into the newspapers, both for and against Bodyline tactics.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a {{transformation}} tactic that provides general tabulation of func-tional algorithms. This tabulation tactic can be applied to dependency graphs in which variable size cuts can be defined. <b>The</b> <b>tactic</b> can be considered a generalization of <b>the</b> tupling <b>tactic</b> proposed by other authors. Tables are dynamically created and their sizes determined at execution time. <b>The</b> <b>tactic</b> is greatly simplified by the use of the data type array present in the functional language Haskell. According {{to the size of the}} tables used, two forms of tabulation are distinguished, respectively named total and partial tabulation. Some signi-ficative examples are developed using <b>the</b> <b>tactic,</b> including dynamic programming problems. Finally, we apply <b>the</b> loop inversion <b>tactic</b> to <b>the</b> partially tabulated algorithms to show that, in many cases, these algorithms can be transformed into tail recursive versions, similar to their imperative counterparts...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>tactic</b> has its drawbacks; in particular, if the nightwatchman does survive {{until the}} end of the day, the {{beginning}} of the next day's play will see refreshed bowlers with better light facing a less capable batsman. As a result, not all captains utilise the tactic; Steve Waugh, for example, abandoned <b>the</b> <b>tactic</b> during his captaincy of Australia.|$|R
5|$|Planned as {{the first}} chapter of a trilogy from the very beginning, Mass Effect was {{developed}} over the course of {{three and a half years}} and uses the Unreal Engine 3 as a groundwork. It was designed so that the player would assume the role of a central character that could make important decisions and impact the story of the game in numerous ways. The combat was designed to offer <b>the</b> <b>tactics</b> and customization of a role-playing game, but through a simpler and real-time third-person shooter interface. In 2008 and 2009, two downloadable content packs that introduced new missions to the base game were released.|$|E
5|$|That day, the Prussians took as trophies 72 cannons (62 {{percent of}} the French/Imperial artillery), seven flags, and 21 standards. With some 3,500 {{horsemen}} and 20 cannons, plus a portion of Prince Henry's regiment of infantry, the Prussian army had defeated the combined armies of two European powers, France and the Holy Roman Empire. <b>The</b> <b>tactics</b> at Rossbach became a landmark {{in the history of}} military art. The same night, on the field, the King awarded Seydlitz the Order of the Black Eagle, and promoted him to lieutenant general. Seydlitz had been wounded during the melée and he remained out of action for four months, nursed by a lady in Leipzig.|$|E
5|$|The Cunningham–Rawnsley team {{used the}} AI {{specifically}} to position themselves directly astern and underneath the enemy. Although the German bombers carried a dorsal gunner, {{it was difficult}} to locate an enemy against the black colour of the landscape. Usually the blackness of the country would swallow up the outline of an approaching night fighter. As they approached, the slipstream of the enemy could prove hazardous; bucking the Beaufighter and throwing the pilot off his aim. Approaching from slightly below allowed the attacking pilot to avoid the slipstream. <b>The</b> <b>tactics</b> allowed for Cunningham to close the range and fire first, which was usually sufficient to end the engagement quickly and successfully. Bob Braham, a rival night fighter ace, also used this tactic.|$|E

5|$|The {{respective}} {{forces of}} the royal and baronial armies have been estimated to be 10,000 and 5,000 strong. Montfort, facing such unfavourable numbers, decided to concentrate his forces on {{the centre of the}} enemy’s front, hoping to drive a wedge through the line. Though <b>the</b> <b>tactics</b> were initially successful, the baronial forces soon lost the initiative, especially as the Welsh infantry provided by Llywelyn ap Gruffudd had proved unreliable, and deserted at an early point. The flanks of the royal army closed in on Montfort's, surrounding them. With Montfort confronted by a force twice the size of his own, on unfavourable ground, the battle rapidly turned into a massacre.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>tactics</b> {{employed}} by the Anzac Mounted Division were to prove effective throughout the coming campaigns in the Sinai and in the Levant (also known {{at the time as}} Palestine). The key to the mounted rifles and light horse's approach was to quickly move onto tactical ground and then to effectively operate as infantry once dismounted. In defence, the artillery and machine guns wrought havoc on enemy attacks, and during the mounted advance, they covered and supported the British Empire mounted force.|$|E
5|$|While Jardine won {{the series}} as captain, he contributed just 199 runs {{at an average}} of 22.11 in the Tests, and 628 runs (average 36.94) in all {{first-class}} cricket in Australia. Jardine only played in the first Test of the short series which followed in New Zealand, due to rheumatism. All the players enjoyed the short tour although rain ruined the cricket, and Jardine was observed to show signs of paranoia towards all things Australian. Pelham Warner, although he later stated that he disapproved of Bodyline bowling, praised Jardine's captaincy on the tour and believed that he was cruelly treated by the Australian crowds. He further believed that Jardine was convinced that <b>the</b> <b>tactics</b> were legitimate.|$|E
