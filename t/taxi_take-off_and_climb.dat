40|$|The growing {{level of}} {{environmental}} implications of aviation {{and a significant}} increase in air traffic have been driving technological advancements in the aerospace industry. The rising developments in battery technology allowed the automotive industry to build hybrid and fully electric cars. However, the limited power-to-weight ratio components impede the development of fully electric aircrafts. In this regard, Hybrid Electric Propulsion Systems (HEPS) are more viable. With HEPS, the aero-engine is combined with an electric system. This brings several technological challenges, such as the increased complexity in the performance and sizing methodology of the propulsion system and the necessary offset of the weight increment. Because of these issues, the different state of the art HEPS concepts largely depend on the development of new technologies, as well as maintaining efficient power management during the different phases of the flight envelope. The power management system adjusts the supplied power ratio between the energy sources during operation, as power can come from fuel and/or electrical energy. The objective {{of this study is to}} analyse the power management of HEPS, focusing on passenger transport aircraft. The application of HEPS in the mid/long-term is heavily dependent on the technology maturity level of electric components. To examine the performance of HEPS, a simulation model is developed after determining the power requirements of a flight mission. The effects of different power management control strategies are analysed by combining different <b>take-off</b> <b>and</b> <b>climb</b> power splits. The power management control strategy with a <b>take-off</b> <b>and</b> <b>climb</b> power split of approximately 25 % and 14 % respectively, while scaling down the engine to 90 %, is the most optimal and feasible strategy.

40|$|Tests {{were made}} of eight {{full-scale}} propellers of different shape at various tip speeds up to about 1, 000 feet per second. The range of blade-angle settings investigated was from 10 degrees to 30 degrees at the 0. 75 radius. The results indicate that a loss in propulsive efficiency occurred at tip speeds from 0. 5 to 0. 7 the velocity of sound for the <b>take-off</b> <b>and</b> <b>climbing</b> conditions. As the tip speed increased beyond these critical values, the loss rapidly increased and amounted, in some instances, to more than 20 percent of the thrust power for tip-speed values of 0. 8 the speed of sound. In general, as the blade-angle setting was increased, the loss started to occur at lower tip speeds. The maximum loss for a given tip speed occurred at a blade-angle setting of about 20 degrees for the <b>take-off</b> <b>and</b> 25 degrees for the climbing condition.

50|$|The VC10 was a {{new design}} but used some {{production}} ideas and techniques, {{as well as the}} Conway engines, developed for the V.1000 and VC7.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this work is the {{development}} of a Multi-degree Of Freedom (MOF) model for simulation and control of the landing performances of the SAE Heavy Lift Airplane model built by the Aerodynamics design team of RIT. From dynamic considerations, the landing gear performance has two areas of interest: a) behavior during touchdown impact, and b) response to excitation induced by track roughness during <b>taxi,</b> <b>take-off</b> <b>and</b> later part of the landing runs. As the problem at hand is highly nonlinear and complex, initially a simplified 1 -dof model of the same aircraft is derived and analyzed using Lagrange 2 ̆ 7 s equations and energy methods. After understanding the basic dynamics of the system, a more complex 3 -dof model is derived considering the dynamics of the wheels of the landing gear. Analyses with and without the runway profile are carried out to study the effects of the input signals on the derived model. In order to achieve a controlled landing behavior of the aircraft, a linear damper or shock absorber is incorporated into the analysis and simulation, even though it is not available in the original prototype. The nonlinear models are linearized in Simulink and control system designs are performed on the linearized models using Root Locus techniques, Pole Placement methods, LQR approach, and Error Space approach. The designed controllers are then applied on the original nonlinear 3 -dof model of the landing gear and a study of the effects of changing landing gear parameters is performed.

40|$|Among {{the most}} {{important}} problems faced by the air transport today there can be mentioned some negative influences of aircraft and airports {{on the environment and}} the increasing costs of air transport. One of the possibilities to improve the situation is to work out innovative solutions aimed at decreasing of the aircraft pollution and improving the transport effectiveness. Among the most innovative ideas is the use of magnetic levitation (MAGLEV) to aid the <b>take-off</b> <b>and</b> landing of the transport aircraft. The “Integrated Ground and on-Board system for Support of the Aircraft Safe <b>Take-off</b> <b>and</b> Landing ” – GABRIEL, deals with radically new integration of the MAGLEV technology into the air transportation system that contains aircraft, airport, air traffic control, authority, logistic and operational support, maintenance, etc. GABRIEL idea includes operation of the aircraft without the conventional undercarriage system and using the ground based power and supporting systems for <b>take-offs</b> <b>and</b> landings. In case of using the GABRIEL system as a catapult, the aircraft on the track must be accelerated to the speed permitting to reach the altitude of 300 m or more. Such <b>take-off</b> <b>and</b> <b>climb</b> results in minimum noise and minimal emission of substances harmful for the environment. After reaching the altitude of 300 m, the aircraft may follow its flight with using different flight strategies. Different conditions of the unconventional take-off needs to shape other way the trajectory of the initial stage of the aircraft flight after the lift-off. The aim of the present work was to determine the optimal conditions of the lift-off and the optimal trajectory of the initial climb minimizing the emission. Simplified realization of the Ritz-Galerkin method was used in this work, which uses an approximate solution to boundary value problems for determining the optimal flight trajectory...|$|R
