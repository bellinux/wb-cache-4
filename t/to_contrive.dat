Through this distraction he finds himself within a church, where he notices an old man, Ilia Murin, with his young wife, Katerina. His fascination for the couple, particularly Katerina, causes him <b>to</b> <b>contrive</b> further encounters, {{with the intention of}} securing a lodging at their home. He becomes their house guest. The gloomy Murin is a perceived Old Believer, with powers of clairvoyance that have perturbed his neighbours and the local police, and which appear to control his wife. Katerina implies that Murin was her mother's lover, that she might be Murin's biological daughter, and that the pair ran-off together after he killed her father. There is an unresolved suggestion that Murin caused the death of Katerina's fiancé during their escape.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} {{conceived}} by Mike Bullen and Cold Feets executive producer Andy Harries in 2000. Both attended a television conference in Sydney and decided <b>to</b> <b>contrive</b> the main {{plot of the}} fourth series so the characters {{would end up in}} Australia. Helen Baxendale was pregnant and could not fly to Australia, so all scenes featuring Rachel were filmed in Manchester and Salford, England. After location scouting and casting around the Sydney area in May and July, production in Australia ran for 18 days in October 2001. Locations used included a heritage home in Vaucluse for the wedding scenes, Palm Beach for a beach barbecue scene, and outside the Opera House. The episode was watched by nearly ninemillion people on its original UK broadcast and received a mixed reaction from newspaper critics; some believed the trip to Sydney was an unnecessary jaunt for the cast and crew, others selected the episode as a [...] "pick of the day". It also received mixed reviews in Australia and New Zealand. Kimberley Joseph's performance was praised, as was Gary Sweet's guest role. The episode represented the series when it won the award for Best Drama Series at the British Academy Television Awards 2002.|$|E

2500|$|While {{the real}} reason for the {{discrepancy}} between The Original Series Klingons and their feature film and later television series counterparts was a lack of budget, fans took it upon themselves <b>to</b> <b>contrive</b> an acceptable canon reason for the sudden change.

2500|$|Roughly {{ninety percent}} of the film was shot on set. Bong's {{original}} wish was to shoot the film entirely in Korea, but a studio large enough to accommodate a set of such scale was difficult to find, thus Barrandov Studio was used instead, requiring the construction of a 100-meter replica of the title train. In choosing Barrandov Studio, Bong explained, [...] "All the artwork, huge train sets and the gimbal were greatly completed and fully operational. Shooting at Barrandov Studios will never stop with a perpetual engine." [...] Bong's usage of the studio allowed him and his team to carry out meticulous experiments <b>to</b> <b>contrive</b> perpetual movement by staging the film on a giant gyroscopic gimbal, which can roll from side to side or bend realistically, to give three-dimensional feel to the train Nearly all the shots within the train are filmed so that the tail sections are left of the characters on-screen, and the engine to the right; this was a [...] "discipline" [...] that Bong wanted to [...] "maintain that energy, and give the audience a sense that whichever way the shot is moving, that's where the characters are going".|$|E
2500|$|After a {{brief period}} of leave in Britain during 1958, Burgess took up a further Eastern post, this time at the Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddin College in Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei. Brunei had been a British {{protectorate}} since 1888, and was not to achieve independence until 1984. In the sultanate, Burgess sketched the novel that, when it was published in 1961, was to be entitled Devil of a State and, although it dealt with Brunei, for libel reasons the action had to be transposed to an imaginary East African territory similar to Zanzibar, named Dunia. In his autobiography Little Wilson and Big God (1987) Burgess wrote:"This novel was, is, about Brunei, which was renamed Naraka, Malay-Sanskrit for 'hell.' Little invention was needed <b>to</b> <b>contrive</b> a large cast of unbelievable characters and a number of interwoven plots. Though completed in 1958, the work was not published until 1961, for what it was worth it was made a choice of the book society. Heinemann, my publisher, was doubtful about publishing it: it might be libellous. I had to change the setting from Brunei to an East African one. Heinemann was right to be timorous. In early 1958, The Enemy in the Blanket appeared and at once provoked a libel suit." ...|$|E

[...] A film titled Leatherface received a direct-to-video release from Lightning Pictures in the United Kingdom in January 2017, featuring a masked chainsaw-brandishing figure on the home video cover. However, this film was not the Texas Chain Saw Massacre prequel, but rather a re-packaging of the unrelated Playing With Dolls: Bloodlust. The release was criticised by members of the press for its misleading marketing, with William Bibbiani scrutising on Blumhouse.com that [...] "It's not uncommon for horror movies to pick up new titles in domestic or foreign markets in an attempt to capitalize on various trends, but this is a particularly egregious example. It goes beyond mockbusters, which try to trick you into thinking it's the real deal, and simply takes the title of an upcoming, anticipated horror movie and tries to pass itself off as that movie." [...] Playing With Dolls director Rene Perez apologised for the title change, [...] "I am [...] to this title change but I am powerless to stop it.
