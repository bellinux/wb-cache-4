5|$|The {{captain of}} a sailing ship seeks a course along which the winds can be {{expected}} to blow in the direction of travel. During the Age of Sail, the pattern of prevailing winds made various points of the globe easy or difficult to access, and therefore had a direct effect on European empire-building and thus on modern political geography. For example, Manila galleons could not sail into <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>at</b> all.|$|E
5|$|A French frigate {{squadron}} sent to on {{a cruise}} in the Northern Bay of Biscay in the early autumn of 1793 was commanded by Captain Zacharie Allemand and consisted of the frigates Carmagnole, Résolue, Sémillante and Uranie with the brig-corvette Espiègle. On 22 October, the squadron sighted the 16-gun Spanish brig Alcoudia and Allemand ordered Uranie under Captain Jean-François Tartu to separate from the squadron and pursue the Spaniard. Uranie was easily able to capture Alcoudia, taking the prisoners on board the frigate and establishing a prize crew on the brig. Two days later, Uranie was sailing southwards in company with the prize with <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>at</b> the southwest, when a sail appeared to the north at 09:30.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} video surfaced {{online in}} late May 2010, explaining why Beyoncé's character was remembering her love {{interest in the}} original version. It begins {{with a view of}} the night sky and many trees, as Beyoncé drives a car and Ealy's character is chased by the police through a forest. As the video progresses, she parks her car on the side of the road and scenes from the original version are shown. Police dogs eventually catch Ealy's character and attack him savagely. An open bag reveals stolen money, which is dispersed by <b>the</b> <b>wind.</b> <b>At</b> the end of the video, in the forest, Beyoncé finds Ealy lying lifelessly on the ground.|$|E

40|$|The {{variance}} in <b>the</b> <b>winding</b> number of various random fractal curves, including the self-avoiding walk, the loop-erased random walk, contours of FK clusters, and stochastic Loewner evolution, {{have been studied}} by numerous researchers. Usually the {{focus has been on}} <b>the</b> <b>winding</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> endpoints. We measure <b>the</b> {{variance in}} <b>winding</b> number <b>at</b> typical points along the curve. More generally, we study <b>the</b> <b>winding</b> <b>at</b> points where k strands come together, and some adjacent strands may be conditioned not to hit each other. The measured values are consistent with an interesting conjecture. Comment: 4 pages, 2 figure...|$|R
5|$|Unlike fueled {{generating}} plants, {{the capacity}} factor {{is affected by}} several parameters, including the variability of <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>at</b> the site {{and the size of}} the generator relative to the turbine's swept area. A small generator would be cheaper and achieve a higher capacity factor but would produce less electric power (and thus less profit) in high winds. Conversely, a large generator would cost more but generate little extra power and, depending on the type, may stall out at low wind speed. Thus an optimum capacity factor of around 40–50% would be aimed for.|$|E
5|$|He {{joined the}} Oxford Playhouse in 1951 and worked {{there for three}} years, {{appearing}} in plays such as He Who Gets Slapped as the clown. Peter Hall worked with Barker at Oxford and gave him his break, casting him as the Chantyman and Joe Silva in his production of Mourning Becomes Electra at the Arts Theatre in London's West End in 1955. By {{the time he had}} made it to the West End, Barker had appeared in an estimated 350 plays. Barker remained a West End actor for several years, appearing in numerous plays between 1955 and 1968. These included, in 1955, two performances each night as he played a gypsy in Listen to <b>the</b> <b>Wind</b> <b>at</b> the Arts Theatre and then a peasant in Summertime later in the evening. Other roles included Mr Thwaites in Double Image in 1956 (with Olivier), Camino Real (directed by Hall) in 1957, French gangster Robertoles-Diams in Irma La Douce for two years from 1958, Lord Slingsby-Craddock in Mr Whatnot in 1964 and Birdboot in The Real Inspector Hound in 1968. He also appeared in several Royal Court Theatre productions, including A Midsummer Night's Dream as Quince.|$|E
5|$|Wind {{direction}} is usually {{expressed in terms}} of the direction from which it originates. For example, a northerly wind blows from the north to the south. Weather vanes pivot to indicate the direction of <b>the</b> <b>wind.</b> <b>At</b> airports, windsocks indicate wind direction, and {{can also be used to}} estimate wind speed by the angle of hang. Wind speed is measured by anemometers, most commonly using rotating cups or propellers. When a high measurement frequency is needed (such as in research applications), wind can be measured by the propagation speed of ultrasound signals or by the effect of ventilation on the resistance of a heated wire. Another type of anemometer uses pitot tubes that take advantage of the pressure differential between an inner tube and an outer tube that is exposed to the wind to determine the dynamic pressure, which is then used to compute the wind speed.|$|E
50|$|The {{amount of}} {{electricity}} produced by <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> turbine {{depends on the}} strength and quality of <b>the</b> <b>winds</b> <b>at</b> any given time. <b>The</b> <b>wind</b> speed <b>at</b> which this turbine begins to generate electricity (its cut-in speed) is about 16.9 km/h (10.5 mph). When operating, the blades turn at a constant speed of 15.7 revolutions per minute. If <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> speed is more than 90 km/h (56 mph), on-board computers stop the turbine to avoid damage to it.|$|R

The same week, her other releases, The Fame and The Fame Monster were at {{positions}} two and three, respectively. Billboard chart manager Keith Caulfield noted that Gaga became the first act to occupy the chart's top three positions, in its nine-year history. She additionally charted on the Billboard 200, with The Fame at number 12 and The Fame Monster at number 27, marking the first time an artist placed three concurrent titles in the top 30 since January 23, 1993, when Garth Brooks placed four sets in the top 30: The Chase at number two, Beyond the Season at number 23, Ropin' <b>the</b> <b>Wind</b> <b>at</b> number 26 and No Fences at number 29. According to Nielsen SoundScan, The Remix has sold 314,000 copies in US as of April 2016. In Canada, the album debuted at number five on the Canadian Albums Chart issue dated May 22, 2010, and remained on the chart {{for a total of}} ten weeks.

25|$|Further inefficiencies, such as gearbox losses, {{generator}} and converter losses, {{reduce the}} power delivered by a wind turbine. To protect components from undue wear, extracted power is held constant above the rated operating speed as theoretical power increases at the cube of wind speed, further reducing theoretical efficiency. In 2001, commercial utility-connected turbines deliver 75% to 80% of the Betz limit of power extractable from <b>the</b> <b>wind,</b> <b>at</b> rated operating speed.|$|E
25|$|The {{prevailing}} {{winds and}} currents create particular problems for vessels trying to round the Horn against them, i.e. {{from east to}} west. This was a particularly serious problem for traditional sailing ships, which could make very little headway against <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>at</b> the best of times; modern sailing boats are significantly more efficient to windward and can more reliably make a westward passage of the Horn, {{as they do in}} the Global Challenge race.|$|E

25|$|Cloud {{coverage}} is generally extensive, with averages from 5.2eighths in May and July to 6.4eighths in December and January. Precipitation is high throughout the year: the weather {{station on the}} nearby Diego Ramirez Islands, 109kilometres (68mi) south-west in the Drake Passage, shows the greatest rainfall in March, averaging 137.4 millimetres (5.41in); while October, which has the least rainfall, still averages 93.7 millimetres (3.69in). Wind conditions are generally severe, particularly in winter. In summer, <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>at</b> Cape Horn is gale force up to 5% of the time, with generally good visibility; however, in winter, gale-force winds occur up to 30% of the time, often with poor visibility.|$|E
25|$|New England won {{the coin}} toss and drove 63 yards in 14 {{plays for the}} winning field goal, with Brady {{completing}} eight consecutive passes for 45 yards, including a 20-yard completion to J.

While Vinatieri's game-tying kick had <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>at</b> his back, this drive was into {{the wind and the}} Patriots wanted to move closer. Following five runs from Antowain Smith for 15 yards and one from Brady for 2, and after a drive of more than eight minutes, Vinatieri and Walter cleared snow away from where the ball would be spotted. Vinatieri then gave New England its first lead of the game, making a 23-yard field goal to win.|$|E

25|$|In 2008 Bath {{won their}} first {{silverware}} in 10 years, beating Worcester {{to win the}} European Challenge Cup. After defeat in the 2003 and 2007 finals, it was third time lucky for the English team who ground out an impressive win over Worcester Warriors at Kingsholm. Outgoing skipper Steve Borthwick led by example and was a tower of strength in the lineout {{on his way to}} becoming FedEx Man of the match. Bothwick, who joins Saracens next season, was carried aloft by his jubilant teammates after a titanic tussle in appalling conditions. Worcester won the toss and opted to play with <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>at</b> their backs in the first period. It mattered not as Bath dominated possession and territory in the first quarter, and deservedly took the lead on 15 minutes with an Olly Barkley penalty. Barkley went on to score a second penalty a drop goal and a conversion, but it was tries from Jonny Fa'amatuainu and Nick Abendanon that put the game beyond the reach of brave Worcester. Bath won 24–16.|$|E
25|$|New York had <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>at</b> {{their back}} in the first quarter, but could only score on kicker David Treadwell's 26-yard field goal on their opening drive. In the second quarter, they had another chance to score, but {{receiver}} Mark Jackson dropped a pass on third and 2 from the Vikings 17 and then Treadwell drilled a 34-yard field goal attempt wide left. Meanwhile, the Vikings went up 7-3 on Jim McMahon's 40-yard pass to wide receiver Cris Carter. Near {{the end of the}} half, Giants quarterback Phil Simms threw a third down pass to Dave Meggett that lost nine yards, bringing up fourth and 19 from the New York 23. On the next play, punter Mike Horan shanked a kick that went right into the back of teammate Greg Jackson, a blocker in the backfield, enabling the Vikings to take over on the Giants 36 with 29 seconds left in the half and take a 10-3 halftime lead on Fuad Reveiz's franchise postseason record 52-yard field goal.|$|E
25|$|Locust swarms {{fly with}} <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>at</b> roughly {{the speed of}} the wind. They can cover from 100 to 200 {{kilometers}} in a day, and will fly up to about 2,000 meters above sea level (thereafter, it becomes too cold). Therefore, swarms cannot cross tall mountain ranges such as the Atlas, the Hindu Kush or the Himalayas. They will not venture into the rain forests of Africa nor into central Europe. However, locust adults and swarms regularly cross the Red Sea between Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, and are even reported to have crossed the Atlantic Ocean from Africa to the Caribbean in ten days during the 1987-89 plague. A single swarm can cover up to 1200 square kilometers and can contain between 40 and 80 million locusts per square kilometer (a total of around 50 to 100 billion locusts per swarm, representing 100,000 to 200,000 tons, considering an average mass of 2 grams per cricket). The locust can live between three and six months, and there is a ten to 16-fold increase in locust numbers {{from one generation to the}} next.|$|E

25|$|In 1874, the Old Etonians {{entered the}} FA Cup {{for the first}} time. They started their {{campaign}} against the Swifts, which proved a very tough match. After two drawn games, the Etonians managed {{to pull off a}} 3–0 victory. In the second round they received a bye which led them into the Quarter Finals. Following a win against Maidenhead, they played Shropshire Wanderers; in an extremely close match, the Old Boys came through by a single goal to nil. Thus, the Old Boys reached the FA Cup Final at their first attempt, where they came up against a strong team from the Royal Engineers who were in the final {{for the third time in}} the first four years of the competition. The final was played in a strong wind, which favoured the Old Etonians who had <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>at</b> their backs for all but ten minutes of the 90, and all 30 minutes of extra time (teams in this period only changed ends after a goal was scored). The teams finished level after 90 minutes, with a goal from Capt Henry Renny-Tailyour being cancelled out by one from Alexander Bonsor.|$|E
