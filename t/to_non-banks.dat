40|$|In former studies about Russian banks, {{analysis}} from a comprehensive viewpoint {{has been almost}} completely ignored. In order to clarify the characteristics of Russian banking activities, an {{analysis from}} the viewpoints of bank location, foundation and scale is indispensable. Russian banks have shown some distinguishing characteristics in their activities when viewed by these classifications. To analyze this situation, we have classified Russian banks in this article by their location, foundation and scale. To do this we used the lists of large Russian banks that were periodically published in "Ekonomika i zhizn'" (data as of July 1994, January 1995, January 1996 and January 1997; the list has not been published since 1998) and "Finansovye izvestiia" (data as of January 1996, January 1997 and January 1998). The situation after 1998 was not analyzed {{because of the lack}} of information. For an analysis of Russian banking activities by bank foundation, banks were classified into former state banks and non-former state banks. Former state banks include the Savings Bank of Russia, Promstroibank of USSR, Agroprombank of USSR, Zhilsotsbank of USSR (excluding the Foreign Trade Bank of Russia) and the Foreign Trade Bank of Russia. For an analysis of activities by their location, banks were classified into those which were located in Moscow city and Moscow oblast (hereafter referred to as Moscow banks) and those in 11 other economic regions (North, Northwest, Central excluding Moscow city and Moscow oblast, Volga-Vyatka, Central Black-Soil, Volga, North Caucasus, Urals, West Siberia, East Siberia, and Far East; Kaliningrad was excluded because there were no data about it). The banks in these economic regions are referred to below as regional banks. In addition, regression analysis was applied to clarify differences in banking activities by bank foundation and location. Because of the limited data, in the regression banks were classified by foundation into former state banks and non-former state banks, and banks were classified by location into Moscow banks and regional banks. In the analysis by bank scale, data were taken into account for the banks that were ranked as the 50 top banks in the 100 largest bank lists and for 50 banks from the bottom of the lists. Regression was then used to confirm whether or not differences existed in the activities between large banks and medium-sized banks. Before analyzing Russian banks' activities by these classifications, let us survey the trends and changes of their lending and investing activities. Russian banks earned profits under the hyperinflation caused by the liberalization of prices in January 1992, through devaluation of their liabilities and from other sources. Subsequent government tight money policies led to the suppression of inflation and stabilization of the ruble exchange rate. From about 1994, therefore, banks tended to increase loans to other banks, although they still held a large share of hard currency as non-working assets. The banks made profits by raising funds in the call market and lending the money as call loans under a positive yield curve for terms longer than the call money repayment period. Such a profit-making structure collapsed under tight monetary and fiscal policies, however, and some banks fell into default in August 1995. Banks therefore began to place more emphasis on their lending activities <b>to</b> <b>non-bank</b> sectors or <b>to</b> holdings of state securities. Especially after 1995 the amount of outstanding state securities has increased dramatically, because the government was prohibited in 1995 from compensating its budget deficits with Central Bank loans. Because the inflation rate decreased further in 1996 - 1997, the refinance rate of the Central Bank also was reduced. This resulted in the decline of the yield on state securities. During these years banks tended to increase the amount of loans <b>to</b> <b>non-bank</b> sectors, reducing the proportion of non-working assets. In the following sections we will analyze loans <b>to</b> <b>non-bank</b> sectors, loans <b>to</b> other banks and holdings of state securities. 1. Loans <b>to</b> <b>non-bank</b> sectors. In this section we will analyze the general situation regarding loans <b>to</b> <b>non-bank</b> sectors and the situation of foreign currency-denominated loans <b>to</b> <b>non-bank</b> sectors. (1) General situation of loans <b>to</b> <b>non-bank</b> sectors. First we analyzed the situation by foundation of banks. In the data of "Ekonomika i zhizn'" the share of loans <b>to</b> <b>non-bank</b> sectors in the assets of the former Promstroibank and Agroprombank was high. This was because these banks had strong relationships with their customers, industrial and agricultural companies. In contrast, the share of loans <b>to</b> <b>non-bank</b> sectors in the assets of the former Zhilsotsbank was lower than that of the former Promstroibank and Agroprombank. Banks that originated from the former Zhilsotsbank did not tend to participate in unprofitable government economic programs such as agricultural programs. Activities of these banks were quite different [...] some of them gave priority <b>to</b> loans <b>to</b> <b>non-bank</b> sectors, while others gave weight to operations of state securities. The share of loans <b>to</b> <b>non-bank</b> sectors at the Foreign Trade Bank of Russia was much lower than that of banks of other categories. That was because its main activities were to hold its assets in hard currency in foreign banks. The share of loans <b>to</b> <b>non-bank</b> sectors at non-former state banks was lower than that of the former Promstroibank and Agroprombank but higher than that of the former Zhilsotsbank. Let us further analyze the situation of loans <b>to</b> <b>non-bank</b> sectors by the location of banks. In the data of "Ekonomika i zhizn'" the share of loans <b>to</b> <b>non-bank</b> sectors at Moscow banks was much lower than that of regional banks in 1994 and 1995, but in 1996 and 1997 differences between Moscow banks and regional banks became smaller. Furthermore, regression indicates that the share of loans <b>to</b> <b>non-bank</b> sectors at smaller Moscow former state banks tended to be greater in 1994 and 1995. From the viewpoint of the scale of banks, the share of loans <b>to</b> <b>non-bank</b> sectors at larger banks tended to be lower. But in 1996 and 1997 differences between classifications were smaller. In the data of "Finansovye izvestiia" the share of loans <b>to</b> <b>non-bank</b> sectors in the assets of non-former state banks was the highest of all categories by foundation of bank. At the former Promstroibank, Agroprombank and Zhilsotsbank and at the Foreign Trade Bank of Russia, the share was about 20 - 30 %. In the data of "Finansovye izvestiia" the share of loans <b>to</b> <b>non-bank</b> sectors at non-former state banks exceeded that of the former Promstroibank and Agroprombank. This is different from the result of the analysis based on the data of "Ekonomika i zhizn'" and is caused by the difference in the definition of "asset" in the data. This means the share of interest arrears, the inter-office account and other assets in the assets of the former Promstroibank and Agroprombank was larger than the share at non-former-state banks. The share of loans <b>to</b> <b>non-bank</b> sectors at the Savings Bank of Russia was much lower than that of other categories. This was caused by the weakness of the bank's relationship with companies in the Soviet era. In the data of "Finansovye izvestiia" regression shows that larger non-former state banks tended to loan more, whereas differences between Moscow banks and regional banks were weaker. On the other hand, differences between large banks and medium-sized banks became greater as years passed, which is distinguished by the smaller proportion of loans <b>to</b> <b>non-bank</b> sectors at larger banks. (2) Foreign currency loans <b>to</b> <b>non-bank</b> sectors. The data of "Finansovye izvestiia" were used for an analysis of foreign currency loans <b>to</b> <b>non-bank</b> sectors (there were no such data in "Ekonomika i zhizn'"). The data showed that of loans <b>to</b> <b>non-bank</b> sectors, the share of foreign currency loans tended to be larger at the non-former state banks than at the former state banks, but differences by location of banks were weak. Regression shows that the share of foreign currency loans <b>to</b> <b>non-bank</b> sectors denominated at larger non-former state banks tended to be greater. Differences between large banks and medium-sized banks were evident. 2. Loans to other banks. In this paper we defined "loans to other banks" as loans that were included in the category "Loans" on the balance sheet, excluding deposits in correspondent accounts at other banks. Only the data in 1994 and 1995 of "Ekonomika i zhizn'" were consistent with this definition. According to the data the proportion of loans to other banks in the total of all bank loans was high in Central (excluding Moscow city and Moscow oblast) in 1994, and high in Moscow city and Moscow oblast and Urals in 1995. Therefore differences in loans to other banks between Moscow banks and regional banks were not so evident. From the viewpoint of the foundation of banks, the share of loans to other banks at non-former state banks was higher. This was related to the weakness of their relationship with companies when compared with the former Promstroibank and Agroprombank, as well as the lower overall share of loans <b>to</b> <b>non-bank</b> sectors (in the data of "Ekonomika i zhizn'"). Moreover, regression proved that non-former state banks tended to loan to other banks more than former state banks. On the other hand, differences between large banks and medium-sized banks were not observed in the data. 3. Holdings of state securities. Data about holdings of state securities were available in "Finansovye izvestiia. " From the viewpoint of the foundation of banks the share of state securities in the assets of the Savings Bank of Russia was far larger than that of other categories, and the share in the assets of the Foreign Trade Bank of Russia was relatively high. Differences between former state banks and non-former state banks were clear. From the viewpoint of location, the share of state securities in the assets of Moscow banks tended to be higher than the share at regional banks. Analysis by regression showed that in 1996 and 1998, differences in holdings of state securities by both foundation and location were clear, and the share of state securities at larger Moscow former state banks tended to be higher. Furthermore, in 1996 and 1998 differences between large banks and medium-sized banks were clear, judged from the higher share of state securities in the assets of large banks than those of medium-sized banks. Conclusion. In many phases of Russian banking activities, differences in characteristics according to the foundation of banks came to the fore. Differences in characteristics by the location of banks were weaker, except for holdings of state securities. Differences based on the scale of banks were outstanding, especially differences in loans <b>to</b> <b>non-bank</b> sectors. Recently differences in the activities between large banks and medium-sized banks have attracted more media attention. On the other hand, differences by foundation of banks in particular have tended to be ignored. Our analysis indicates, however, that viewing bank activity from the standpoint of the foundation of banks is still effective to explain Russian banking activities. Our work may as well be the first step towards understanding the changing activities of Russian banks since the collapse of USSR. The task of analyzing the situation after the crisis of August 1998 remains to be addressed...|$|R

40|$|For their {{short-term}} payment obligations, savings banks hold {{substantially more}} liquid assets than the liquidity regulation requires. This paper investigates whether sight deposits, an important funding source for savings banks, help in explaining liquid asset holdings {{in excess of}} regulatory requirements. We analyze whether savings banks transform sight deposits in illiquid assets less intensively than is permitted because (i) the liquidity regulation underestimates actual withdrawal rates (underestimation effect) and/or (ii) savings banks are subject to limits in their lending <b>to</b> <b>non-banks</b> {{that they do not}} offset by, for instance, medium-term interbank lending or fixed asset holdings (lending effect). In our sample, we do not find the underestimation effect to be applicable as actual deposit withdrawal rates are in most cases lower than the regulatorily specified rate. However, we find the lending effect to be at work: Savings banks with low shares of loans <b>to</b> <b>non-banks</b> do not transform sight deposits into illiquid assets as intensively as savings banks with high shares of non-bank loans. Our analysis does not only show that liquid assets positively depend on sight deposits, but also shines a light on how bank size and the individual bank's position in the interbank market affect liquid assets.

One view on the matter is that the market, having some potential for net credit creation, adds dangerously to the rate of world credit expansion. As a challenge to this view, there are others who caution that the case for joint action is not yet well-founded. The author sides with the latter argument, arguing that considerable evidence can be found to show that the growth of the Euro-currency market represents to a significant extent a substitution for, rather than an addition to, credit expansion in other forms.

40|$|Abstract This article {{analyzes}} the last financial crisis focussing on the recurrent dynamics of externalities in banking. It shows that two major determinants {{of the crisis}} were the uncertainty of {{a new form of}} financial intermediation and the failure of regulation to cope with its externalities. Differently from more standard explanations, which are based on opportunism and/or irrationality of financial institutions, this analysis suggests that regulation has not just been insufficient. Regulation has contributed to financial instability too, supporting fragile conventions to handle uncertainty and encouraging regulatory arbitrage through financial innovation. Three implications are derived from this analysis and contrasted with the ongoing reforms of financial regulation in the US and in the EU. First, regulatory arbitrage is better dealt with by protecting banking from disintermediation than by extending prudential regulation <b>to</b> <b>non-banks.</b> Maturity transformation should be defined functionally and reserved to banks. Second, a major danger with ratings is that they support false conventions of safety. To avoid this outcome, the relevance of ratings for regulatory purposes should be reduced and rating agencies should be deterred from rating without firm knowledge. Third, in order to reduce short-termism, regulation of banks’ corporate governance should rather question than reinforce managerial accountability to shareholders...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} credit risk {{transfer}} (CRT) {{in an economy}} with endogenous financing (by both banks and non-bank institutions). Our analysis suggests that the incentive of banks to transfer credit risk is aligned with the regulatory objective of improving stability, and so the recent development of credit derivative instruments is to be welcomed. Moreover, we find the transfer of credit risk from banks <b>to</b> <b>non-banks</b> to be more beneficial than CRT within the banking sector. Intuitively, this is because it allows for the shedding of aggregate risk which must otherwise remain within the relatively more fragile banking sector. Therefore, regulators should act to maximize the benefits from CRT by encouraging the development of instruments favorable to the cross-sectoral transfer of aggregate credit risk (including basket credit derivatives such as collateralized debt obligations). Finally, we derive the optimal regulatory stance for banks relative to nonbank financial institutions. We show that {{a level playing field}} approach is sub-optimal. Regulatory stances should be set to actively encourage cross-sector CRT, first because of the higher fragility of the banking sector and second to induce banks to incur the costs of CRT which otherwise lead them to undertake an insufficient amount of CRT...|$|E
30|$|The {{arguments}} {{in favor of}} the reform are also often backward looking, citing facts, or reasonings in the nineteenth century or early twentieth century. But the role of money used for transactions has clearly changed in the last decades. It is likely to keep changing in the near future, and the liquidity services of demand deposits will most likely drop. 8 With a decline in the demand for transaction money, the potential revenue for the central bank, one of the main arguments for reform, would also shrink. The development of new forms of e-money will also require a different analysis. However, at this stage, we ignore what form of e-money will be widely used. An important question is whether central banks will issue e-currency in the future. Here, we need to distinguish between two different cases. First, central banks could offer e-currency directly <b>to</b> <b>non-banks</b> in addition to the existing system. This is the option currently considered by some central banks. It {{remains to be seen if}} there would be a demand for such a product. 9 The second case is where e-currency would replace all sight deposits, i.e., it would be compulsory to use central bank e-money instead of sight deposits at commercial banks. The latter system would be similar to a sovereign money system.|$|E
40|$|Structuralist {{models of}} {{development}} still {{persist in the}} 1990 s, and many developing countries continue to target macroeconomic stability through aggressive monetary controls based on structuralist assumptions. Simultaneously, prudential criteria, principally capital controls take effect through the commercial banking system. It is the central hypothesis of this thesis that monetary controls impact adversely on commercial bank performance and on banks' market share, and that the simultaneous implementation of monetary and prudential regulation can undermine the objectives of monetary stability {{and the growth of}} the banking system. This study argues that those monetary measures most frequently applied to protect the balance of payments; primary and secondary reserve requirements, credit controls, and interest rate controls, force cost adjustments and non-optimal portfolio realignments which stymie commercial bank performance. These arguments are illustrated from the cases of Barbados, Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago for the period 1973 - 1992. The study discusses the rationale for regulation, analyses commercial bank performance in the Caribbean and formulates a model which includes regulatory variables for testing the impact of monetary and prudential regulation on bank performance. The model also defines the determinants of bank performance and provides the basis for deriving regulation and performance indices with global application. Results disclose that most regulatory variables are negatively associated with commercial bank performance and tentative causality is established running from regulation to bank performance. Where cost-axiomatic interest rate-setting is practised the adverse impact on bank performance is alleviated, but unevenness of monetary and prudential regulations adversely influence the performance of commercial banks, contributing to loss of market share relative <b>to</b> <b>non-banks.</b> Regulation assists in achieving macroeconomic objectives, but greater liberalisation appears desirable for the development of commercial banking. However, new monetary theories are needed to identify alternative vehicles, other than commercial banks, if macroeconomic objectives are to be achieved in increasingly liberalised environments...|$|E

40|$|The {{maintenance}} of price stability is the Bundesbank's ultimate objective. The memory of two hyperinflations within a 30 -year period {{has made the}} fight against inflation of paramount social and political importance. In the Bank's view inflation engenders uncertainties which may jeopardise capital investment on which the competitiveness of German industry as well as full employment and economic growth depends. The Bundesbank pursues this goal by setting the marginal cost of central bank money required by the banks to finance their expansion. Thus, both the liquidity of the banking system {{and the cost of}} borrowing are controlled. This {{does not necessarily mean that}} the banks' loan rate of interest is the Bundesbank's Intermediate target. In fact, the Bank does not have one single intermediate target. Since the Bank's views of the monetary sector are manifested in the form of an interlocking system of financial variables, the selection of an appropriate intermediate target depends on the actual economic situation. In this context, the money stock supply (M 3) is seen by the Bundesbank as functionally related to bank lending and the accumulation of long-term funds at the banks (monetary capital formation). An increase in interest rates would reduce bank lending, stimulate monetary capital formation and hence reduce the money stock supply (M 3). In addition, it would check the utilisation of the money stock supply. This is seen as important because once money has entered the system it may generate unacceptable expenditure flows. To control the growth of the money stock supply, the Bundesbank relies on monetary capital formation, because small stocks of public debt rule out large-scale open market operations. In the Bank's view monetary policy should aim at keeping the banks' loan rate of interest as closely as possible to the natural rate. Lags in this Wicksellian transmission process may arise if the banks have ample margins between their loan and deposit rates when a restrictive monetary policy is implemented. As deposit rates adjust sooner than loan rates to a change in market rates, this also blunts the immediate impact of a policy change. The Bundesbank favours flexible rates of exchange in order to safeguard the financial system against inflows of foreign capital. It would welcome an appreciation of the D-Mark as a contribution to price stability, even though it could result in a loss of employment and exports as it stimulates German business to invest abroad. Furthermore, the Bank aims at constraining the monetary disturbances arising from public sector deficits and collective wage bargaining by means of its annual monetary growth target. This should serve as a signal <b>to</b> <b>non-banks,</b> which they are supposed to internalise in their decision-making. During the review period, the effectiveness of these safeguards was small as witnessed by inflows of foreign capital, large public sector deficits and excessive wage settlements. Moreover, the Bundesbank has been confronted with the development of parallel markets, in particular the Eurocurrency markets, in which borrowers can avoid the effects of its constraints...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{investigates the}} risk-related {{behaviours}} {{of financial institutions}} across the global financial markets and provides reasonable explanations for the empirical results. The thesis has a few conclusions and contributions to the existing literature. It investigates various risks to which financial institutions are exposed, particularly capital risk, real estate risk and valuation risk. The importance of capital adequacy had drawn public and regulators attention in the recent financial turmoil, especially when financial institutions face unexpected credit and liquidity shocks in the financial markets. The thesis shows that banking organizations show little pecking order behaviour in capital structure. Banks are different in terms of leverage relative <b>to</b> <b>non-banks,</b> as taxpayers deposit subsidized debt relative to equity in banking. Therefore, the debt structure in banking is different from nonfinancial firms. For {{the same level of}} financial deficit, a bank may have higher debt level than non-financial firms. However, this is not due to pecking order but because the taxpayers funds deposit in the bank. The thesis also finds that despite of the regulatory minimum capital requirement, the banking organizations target capital level is linearly and collectively influenced by bank-specific, macroeconomic and country-specific variables. In addition, the thesis adopts bivariate GARCH framework and finds significant evidences that with the development of mortgage loans issuance and related derivatives, financial institutions are increasingly exposed to real estate markets, and there is a significant and positive cross-volatility spillover from real estate sector to banks, and the co-movement is in the same direction. It is also crucial that financial institutions and fund managers can predict the expected portfolio returns more accurately. The thesis also finds that zero-beta CAPM significantly improve the expected returns, represented as average predicted returns in the month ahead when comparing with threefactor model, which has difficulty explaining small and growth portfolios returns. We show that market risk is composed of two components, average market returns and cross-sectional market volatility. The findings of the thesis not only contribute and extend the existing literature, but also have important implication for regulators, risk and asset managers as well as investors at both company and public policy levels. The regulators and financial institution managers can monitor banks targeted capital structure more closely based on the bank-specific, macroeconomic and country-specific variables discussed in the thesis. When there is any changes in these determinant variables, institution managers should make relevant adjustments in the targeted capital structure. Moveover, regulators should be aware the influence of real estate market over financial institutions, especially any significant volatility changes in real estate as it can spillover into financial institutions. As financial institutions are increasingly exposed to real estate market, any significant changes in real estate market can also have influential impact on the capital adequacy in bank organisations. Therefore, it is suggested institutional managers need to control the real estate exposure in their financial assets and include real estate factor in the stress testing. Furthermore, it is also important that financial institution and fund managers can estimate the expected returns more accurately, so that they can make correct collection of assets for required risk and return. In the thesis we find that the zero-beta CAPM outperforms the traditional asset pricing model, particularly three-factor model, by providing better prediction on portfolio expected returns. Therefore, the fund managers can adopt the zero- beta ZCAPM framework along with other asset pricing framework when predicting portfolio returns. As high returns often come with high risk, predicting returns more accurately means we can predict and monitor risk more precisely. The financial institution managers can also apply zero-beta CAPM on their institutional asset holdings to monitor whether the institutions are exposed to higher risk assets. The regulators can use the framework to control the financial intermediaries risk and return behaviour to maintain the financial market stability. By identifying and quantifying the risk and return behaviours of financial intermediaries, stakeholders can assess and improve their management and investment performances. The empirical findings also help the regulatory bodies to make effective and suitable policies for financial sectors to ensure a stable, prosperity and sustainable growth of financial market...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY Following its March 1999 meeting, the Committee on the Global Financial System {{formed a}} working group, chaired by Karen Johnson of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, {{to examine the}} events {{surrounding}} the market stresses in many international financial markets in autumn 1998. The group was charged with putting these events in perspective, with special emphasis on understanding the suddenness of the deterioration in liquidity and elevation of risk spreads {{in a wide variety}} of markets, the proximate causes of the withdrawal from risk-taking, and the speed with which and extent to which markets subsequently recovered. The focus of the working group, therefore, was on developments across many markets in a relatively narrow time frame, as opposed to the more general investigation of market liquidity provided by an earlier report to the CGFS or the scrutiny of a narrow set of financial entities contained in the report of the US President’s Working Group and the recommendations on industry practices of the Counterparty Risk Management Policy Group. The working group assembled a large dataset on key financial prices in major international markets and attempted to characterise the degree to which price movements in the autumn were outsized and evidenced different correlations from those observed in relatively more tranquil times. (These data and some of the broad regularities among them are described in Annex 2.) It also searched contemporaneous accounts of the events to establish a time line of significant influences on markets (included as Table 1). Group members interviewed market participants in a number of international financial centres in June 1999 to learn about their actions regarding risk exposure and credit risk management. The group as a whole met with a half dozen market participants in Basel in early July to further that dialogue. Annex 1 summarises the insights gained from the interviews. This is the report of the Working Group. Chapter 2 provides background on the episode of market stress in autumn 1998. The first part of Chapter 2 summarises the events of the period of market turmoil since mid- 1997, noting the differences between the period July 1997 - July 1998 and the period July 1998 - early 1999. The second part examines the process of recovery in markets, which occurred rapidly as participants were encouraged by official action and emboldened by the profit opportunities offered in wide price spreads. Chapter 3 provides an analytic interpretation of the events of July-October 1998 and identifies important mechanisms that appeared to spread disruption across financial centres and amplified price dynamics. Some of those factors - such as an inadequate assessment of counterparty risks that permitted the excessive use of leverage, the failure to incorporate in risk management potential feedback effects of market liquidity on price setting, and the lack of information on aggregate positions - have already been identified as weaknesses in market structure in prior analyses of the events of last autumn by both the private sector and official institutions and have triggered a variety of responses and recommendations for additional changes. Other mechanisms - including a shrinking number of key market participants, the widespread emulation of certain financing, trading and risk management strategies, and compensation schemes encouraging a short-term focus in decision-making - are more entrenched in the structure of the financial industry and may still pose risks going forward. A diagram at the end of Chapter 3 summarises in schematic form the cycle of deterioration in market functioning as understood by the Working Group. Chapter 4 examines the lasting imprint of last year’s events. Risk spreads and many indicators of market liquidity have not returned to their levels of the summer preceding the storm, and indeed some have returned to their crisis levels. This may suggest that, on balance, market-makers and arbitrageurs have scaled back their activities somewhat and investors are more wary about the income prospects associated with a broad range of securities. To the extent that such risk spreads had been bid down to extremely low levels by historical standards in the period before the market pressures erupted, the subsequent net increase in those spreads may have made them now more consistent with fundamentals. Moreover, market participants appear to be taking steps to reduce their exposures to the recurrence of a widespread flight to quality, such as by using rates on private sector rather than government obligations as the benchmarks for pricing. But the net effect of these changes - both the reduced amount of capital devoted to enforcing arbitrage strategies and the shifting of hedging strategies - may have contributed to the recent widening of interest rate spreads, particularly on swaps, in many industrial countries in recent months. Chapter 4 also draws some tentative lessons for policymakers from this experience. Foremost is the realisation that the first line of defence at a time of market stress is sound risk management by market participants, which in turn requires a regulatory and monetary policy environment ensuring that market discipline effectively governs credit decisions and risk-taking. Policymakers should also appreciate that the fallout from last year’s financial market strains was less pronounced on real activity in the industrial countries because a healthy commercial banking system was able to act as a substitute means of intermediating funds. This helps to explain why in this episode the availability of credit <b>to</b> <b>non-banks</b> proved to be relatively more resilient in financial systems, such as those in the continental European countries, where banks play an important role, compared with those systems more oriented towards market-based financial intermediation. Thus, keeping depository institutions safe and sound must remain a priority. While some financial institutions were under severe stress at times, the events of last autumn were initially more a matter of a drying-up of market liquidity than a general withdrawal of credit availability. The subsequent dynamics, though, were complicated as the initial deterioration in market functioning that made participants less confident about price setting also subsequently induced credit strains as collateral values eroded and concerns about counterparties mounted. Chapter 5 concludes with an outline of work still to be done. The group’s efforts to describe the large dataset it collected only scratched the surface of potential empirical work. In addition, more sophisticated financial theory may be able to define more rigorously indicators of market stress, while continued contacts with market participants may make it possible to understand better the management of credit and market risks. ...|$|E
