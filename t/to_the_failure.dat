5|$|According to the Polish {{historian}} Tadeusz Mańczuk, Piłsudski – who {{was planning}} a coup d'état in Kaunas – discouraged the local PMO activists from {{carrying out the}} Sejny Uprising.

5|$|Following {{the failure}} of the Cyberpunk album, Billy Idol did not produce another {{original}} album until 2005, 13 years later.

With the founding of Sanctuary Records, an independent record label Idol felt positive about, and the formation of a new band with Steve Stevens, Idol decided to produce Devil's Playground. Idol's later album featured a more power pop and classic rock sound similar to Idol's 80s style, and received middling reviews.|$|E

5|$|Historian Nancy Bristow {{has argued}} that the pandemic, when {{combined}} with the increasing number of women attending college, contributed to the success of women in the field of nursing.

The assault was likely carried out on behalf of Alexander, in response <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> of Scottish mission to Norway the year previous. In response, Hákon organised a massive military force to re-assert Norwegian control along the western seaboard of Scotland.

5|$|In 1839, threats by the {{imperial}} court of Qing to place sanctions on opium imports caused diplomatic friction with the British Empire. Tensions escalated into the First Opium War. The Qing admitted defeat when British forces captured Hong Kong Island on 20 January 1841. The island was initially ceded under the Convention of Chuenpi {{as part of}} a ceasefire agreement between Captain Charles Elliot and Governor Qishan. A dispute between high-ranking officials of both countries, however, led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> of the treaty's ratification. On 29 August 1842, Hong Kong Island was formally ceded in perpetuity to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland under the Treaty of Nanking.

5|$|It {{had been}} well {{understood}} by the Dutch that the forces occupying the Grebbe Line would not be sufficiently strong to repel all attacks by themselves; they were intended to delay an offensive long enough for reserves to reinforce them.

This was all the more serious as the Stop Line had no depth and lacked large shelters to accommodate enough troops to stage a strong frontal counterattack. In the late evening it was decided to execute a flank attack from the north the next day.|$|E

A December 2014 New York Post article attributed the delay to Hudson Yards' developer, The Related Companies', need to dig caissons for the foundations, just above the subway station, and the foundation work needed to be complete before the MTA could open the station. Continuing trouble with the fire and security alarms in March 2015 would delay the opening until summer.|$|E
