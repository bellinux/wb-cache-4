40|$|Colorfastness <b>to</b> <b>washing</b> and {{crocking}} (color loss due to rubbing) {{are essential}} qualities for any dye/fabric combination {{that will be}} used for garments or upholstery. In this study, colorfastness <b>to</b> <b>washing</b> and crocking of fabrics dyed with wood-staining fungal pigments was compared to colorfastness of commercial dyes using an alternative mechanical testing method. Overall, wood-staining fungal pigments out performed commercial dyes for colorfastness <b>to</b> <b>washing</b> and wet and dry crocking. Xylindein was the most colorfast dye. Draconin red yielded inconsistent results, and the yellow pigment required a mordant to achieve any colorfastness. This study showed that the mechanical color reading method, along with statistical analysis, provided an objective, repeatable gauge of colorfastness, although visual inspection is also needed for practical purposes...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{loreclezole}} on {{the function of}} the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A. (GABA(A)) receptor complex in rat cerebral cortical membrane preparations were compared with those of propofol and diazepam. Loreclezole and propofol modulated [H- 3]muscimol binding and t-[S- 35]butylbicyclophosphorothionate ([S- 35]TBPS) binding <b>to</b> <b>washed</b> and unwashed membranes with potencies and efficacies greater than those of diazepam. Loreclezole and propofol enhanced [H- 3]flunitrazepam binding <b>to</b> <b>washed</b> membranes with efficacies lower than those of GABA and muscimol. Both loreclezole and propofol showed biphasic effects on [S- 35]TBPS binding <b>to</b> <b>washed</b> membranes: at low concentrations (5 to 10 mu M), both drugs, with different efficacies, enhanced [S- 35]TBPS binding whereas, at higher concentrations (30 to 100 mu M), they inhibited this biochemical parameter. In contrast, diazepam enhanced [S- 35]TBPS binding <b>to</b> <b>washed</b> membranes at all concentrations tested. The combination of loreclezole with GABA, at a concentration (0. 3 mu M) that only slightly increased [S- 35]TBPS binding <b>to</b> <b>washed</b> membranes, reversed the increase in binding elicited by loreclezole (5 to 10 mu M) and significantly potentiated the inhibitory effect exerted by higher concentrations (30 to 100 mu M) of this drug. Similar effects were observed with the combination of GABA and propofol. However, GABA had no effect on the enhancement of [S- 35]TBPS binding induced by diazepam. The ability of GABA to reverse and potentiate the effects of loreclezole and propofol on [S- 35]TBPS binding <b>to</b> <b>washed</b> membranes was shared by pentobarbital (200 mu M) and alphaxalone (3 mu M). These anesthetics showed greater efficacies in combination with propofol than with loreclezole. These results suggest that, unlike diazepam, loreclezole and propofol may activate the receptor-associated Cl- channel in the absence of GABA. Furthermore, the difference in the pharmacological profiles of loreclezole and propofol may result from their different effectiveness in activating the receptor Cl- channel directly...|$|R

5|$|Referring to this period, John Martyn (who in 1973 {{wrote the}} title song of his album Solid Air for and about Drake) {{described}} him as the most withdrawn person he had ever met.

5|$|Sea otters {{spend much}} of their time grooming, which {{consists}} of cleaning the fur, untangling knots, removing loose fur, rubbing the fur to squeeze out water and introduce air, and blowing air into the fur. To casual observers, it appears as if the animals are scratching, but they are not known to have lice or other parasites in the fur. When eating, sea otters roll in the water frequently, apparently <b>to</b> <b>wash</b> food scraps from their fur.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Industrial Revolution, Northern England had plentiful coal and water power while the poor agriculture in the uplands meant that labour in the area was cheap. Mining and milling, which had been practiced on a small scale in the area for generations, began to grow and centralise. The boom in industrial textile manufacture is sometimes attributed to the damp climate and soft water making it easier <b>to</b> <b>wash</b> and work fibres, although the success of Northern fabric mills has no single clear source. Readily available coal and the discovery of large iron deposits in Cumbria and Cleveland allowed ironmaking and, with the invention of the Bessemer process, steelmaking to take root in the region. High quality steel in turn fed the shipyards that opened along the coasts, especially on Tyneside and at Barrow-in-Furness.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of his junior year {{beginning}} in September 1928, Richard's parents permitted him to transfer to Whittier High School. At Whittier High, Nixon suffered his first electoral defeat, for student body president. He often rose at 4a.m., to drive the family truck into Los Angeles and purchase vegetables at the market. He then drove to the store <b>to</b> <b>wash</b> and display them, before going to school. Harold had been diagnosed with tuberculosis the previous year; when their mother took him to Arizona in the hopes of improving his health, the demands on Richard increased, causing him to give up football.

5|$|Black currawongs {{are found}} singly or in pairs, but may gather into groups of 20 to 80 birds. Birds have been {{observed}} digging wet yellow clay out of a drain and applying it all over their plumage. Wiping the carpal areas of wings in particular with their bills, they did not appear <b>to</b> <b>wash</b> afterwards, using the procedure {{as a form of}} dirt bath. The black currawong has an undulating flight pattern in time with its wing beats, and often cocks its tail in the air for balance when it lands. Play behaviour has been observed, particularly with subadult individuals. Black currawongs {{have been observed}} wrestling with each other, where a bird would attempt to force its opponent on its back, at Maydena, while others have been reported rolling on their backs and juggling with food items such as pears with their feet.|$|E
5|$|Both sexes have genital slits on the {{underside}} of their bodies. The male can retract and conceal his penis through his slit. The female's slit houses her vagina and anus. Females have two mammary slits, each housing one nipple, one {{on each side of the}} genital slit. The ability to stow their reproductive organs (especially in males) allows for maximum hydrodynamics. The breeding season produces significant physiological changes in males. At that time, the testes enlarge, enabling them to hold more sperm. Large amounts of sperm allow a male <b>to</b> <b>wash</b> away the previous suitor's sperm, while leaving some of his own for fertilization. Also, sperm concentration markedly increases. Having less sperm for out-of-season social mating means it wastes less. This suggests sperm production is energetically expensive. Males have large testes in relation to their body size.|$|E
