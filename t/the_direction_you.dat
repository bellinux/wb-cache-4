6000|$|... "I travel officially, and I {{must travel}} alone," [...] he replied. [...] "As for yourself, {{they will be}} {{breaking}} up here to-morrow, but they will lend you an escort and put you in <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> <b>you</b> wish to take. This, alas, is as much as I can do for you. For us it must be farewell." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Most {{of those}} that have crossed my path are so. At all events, this one was, for when I pointed out <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> <b>you</b> had gone--which was just the {{opposite}} way from here--he said, `I don't believe you!' and when I leaped on him to give him his deserts, he dodged me, and fled into the woods like a squirrel. It was as well, for I should have killed him." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "That {{all sounds}} very nice," [...] he admitted, [...] "but supposing that I have no taste {{in any of}} <b>the</b> <b>directions</b> <b>you</b> have mentioned? Supposing my life here {{satisfies}} me? Supposing I find all that I expect to find in life here on my own land, among my own hills? What then?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{hand at the}} top {{points the}} way clear enough," [...] said the Indian, [...] "but were you careful to observe <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> before <b>you</b> moved it?" ...|$|R
60|$|When {{one comes}} {{to think of}} it, few {{bicycles}} do realise the poster. On only one poster that I can recollect have I seen the rider represented as doing any work. But then this man was being pursued by a bull. In ordinary cases {{the object of the}} artist is to convince the hesitating neophyte that the sport of bicycling consists in sitting on a luxurious saddle, and being moved rapidly in <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> <b>you</b> wish to go by unseen heavenly powers.|$|E
60|$|The {{uniformity}} of lime-washed houses makes Cordova {{the most difficult}} {{place in the world}} wherein to find your way. The streets are exactly alike, so narrow that a carriage could hardly pass, paved with rough cobbles, and tortuous: their intricacy is amazing, labyrinthine; they wind in and out of one another, leading nowhither; they meander on for half a mile and stop suddenly, or turn back, so that you are forced to go in <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> <b>you</b> came. You may wander for hours, trying to find some point that from the steeple appeared quite close. Sometimes you think they are interminable.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is not an}} {{easy thing}} to tow a heavy raft in light boats like these, exactly in <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> <b>you</b> wish it to go," [...] {{returned}} the captain, gaping. [...] "He who trusts to the winds and waves, trusts an uncertain friend, and one who may fail him at the very moment when there is most need of their services. Fair as things now seem, I would give a thousand dollars of a small stock, in which no single dollar has been lightly earned, to see these spars safely on board the Montauk, and snugly fitted to their proper places. Sticks, gentlemen, are to a ship what limbs are to a man. Without them she rolls and tumbles about as winds, currents, and seas will; while with them she walks, and dances, and jumps Jim Crow; ay, almost talks. The standing rigging are the bones and gristle; the running gear the veins in which her life circulates; and the blocks the joints." ...|$|E
5000|$|From Wertheim (or from Rothenburg ob der Tauber in <b>the</b> other <b>direction),</b> <b>you</b> can cycle {{back to the}} {{starting}} point in five recommended extra stages of the route [...] "Charming Tauber Valley (Sportive)": ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'You may depend,' I answered, 'on my {{doing exactly}} what you order me to do. Must I obey you blindly? Or may I know your reason for <b>the</b> {{extraordinary}} <b>directions</b> <b>you</b> have just given to me?' ...|$|R
50|$|In BMX a fakie {{is riding}} {{backwards}} and pedaling with the sprocket movement {{as you are}} moving backwards then at the right point turning your bars <b>the</b> opposite <b>direction</b> <b>you</b> want to turn and sliding out so you are riding forward again.|$|R
5000|$|Fish - This will bounce {{forward in}} <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> <b>you</b> face. Both Goro and the Meowkies will chase it.|$|E

6000|$|... "As you like," [...] Clarke {{said with}} a smile. [...] "I'll give <b>you</b> <b>the</b> <b>directions</b> before <b>you</b> go, but there's another matter I want to talk about." [...] He fixed his eyes on Blake. [...] "You are a nephew of Colonel Challoner's." ...|$|R
50|$|Silver Earring is a point-and-click (mouse controlled) {{third person}} {{adventure}} {{in which you}} play as both Holmes and Watson. Clicking in <b>the</b> general <b>direction</b> <b>you</b> wish to go will usually cause your character to move in that <b>direction.</b> When <b>you</b> see <b>the</b> footsteps icon, clicking will take the character to the next “authorized” spot. Double-clicking makes Holmes or Watson run.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} termination {{condition was}} to stop after visiting the start pixel {{for the second time}}. This limits the set of contours the algorithm will walk completely. An improved stopping condition proposed by Jacob Eliosoff is to stop after entering the start pixel {{for the second time in}} <b>the</b> same <b>direction</b> <b>you</b> originally entered it.|$|R
50|$|The {{origin of}} the word “froe” is not clear, and some {{references}} find it spelled “frow.” One possibility of its roots {{can be found in}} the Old English word “fro,” which meant “away,” which was <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> <b>you</b> hammered the “froe” to split the wood.|$|E
5000|$|Arm to {{the right}} has the {{advantage}} {{that it is more}} visible to any traffic likely to be affected, for example vehicles in the next lane {{to the right}} or also intending to turn right. It is also easier to teach to children: [...] "point in <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> <b>you</b> are going to turn." ...|$|E
50|$|Temple Bridges: High {{above the}} clouds, these bridges {{are the only}} way to get around the Dragon King's army and deeper into the land. However, you'll need to solve a deceptively simple puzzle of levers to {{position}} the bridges in <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> <b>you</b> want to go, and one misstep could be your last...|$|E
6000|$|... "He says," [...] added Mrs. Holiday, [...] "that {{you may get}} ready, {{and then}} go into his room, and he will give <b>you</b> <b>the</b> <b>directions.</b> Only <b>you</b> must not talk much with him, for it hurts him to talk. Hear {{what he has to}} say, and then come out immediately." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{will have}} to try. It may be some time yet before we find the spot. For one thing, <b>the</b> <b>directions</b> aren't complete. <b>You</b> see they stop--" ...|$|R
50|$|From Bobbio, {{the road}} to Piacenza {{is only a few}} minutes from Barberino Orrido, an {{overlook}} of the river Trebbia. Continuing in <b>the</b> same <b>direction</b> <b>you</b> enter <b>the</b> village of Mezzano Scotti, and a few kilometers afterwards, the little village called Perino. It is an ideal starting point for visiting the Perino Valley or the ancient characteristic villages of Aglio and Pradovera.|$|R
5000|$|Concerning gameplay, [...] "most of {{the game}} {{revolves}} around hitting targets to start KISS shows, then hitting more targets to complete the shows....Nudging the ball, which is accomplished by hitting the D-pad, simply causes the ball to jerk {{an inch or two}} in <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> <b>you</b> pressed." [...] The game [...] "features two tables, Last Stop Oblivion and Netherworld." ...|$|E
5000|$|By holding L1 and tapping a direction, {{characters}} do a semi-invincible evade/roll animation in <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> <b>you</b> tapped. Doing {{this with}} proper timing can enter an enemies defense and even bypass certain attacks. New to Sengoku Basara 4, performing {{it at the}} last second, similar to a Parry, will trigger a [...] "Detect" [...] which has a different animation and maneuvers you around an attacking opponent.|$|E
50|$|The threads on a {{right-handed}} screw are a right-handed helix. They are basically a long inclined plane {{wrapped around a}} cylinder such that turning the screw advances the screw back and forth along the z-axis. From {{the point of view}} of the external threads, turning the screw forces the screw up or down the inclined plane. If a screw is right-handed (most screws are) the rule is this: point your right thumb in <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> <b>you</b> want the screw to go and turn the screw in the direction of your curled right fingers.|$|E
5000|$|You were on {{your bike}} on the {{sidewalk}} (Sunday). I was walking <b>the</b> opposite <b>direction.</b> <b>You</b> had a plastic parrot on your handlebars. I smiled. You said [...] "Hi" [...] and smiled back. You won my undying admiration for not wearing a football jersey. That's it. Coffee or a drink?

6000|$|... 'Well, I {{have noticed}} that {{whenever}} the ogre brings back water he always comes from that side; so if <b>you</b> follow <b>the</b> same <b>direction</b> perhaps <b>you</b> may find some.' ...|$|R
50|$|Kramerspitz can be climbed {{directly}} from Garmisch-Partenkirchen in 4 hours, but a round trip will take closer to eight. The access {{is from the}} east side. At the altitude of 1028 m, you will pass St. Martin hut, and from there just continue through the woods generally in <b>the</b> west <b>direction.</b> <b>You</b> do not need any special equipment, any hiking shoes or boots will be good enough.|$|R
50|$|Chi Shot (any {{direction}} + Triangle): More useful {{than the}} Chi Blast, the Chi Shot sends out a fireball of Chi energy in <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> <b>you</b> were pointing when performing the attack. It has a fair distance to it, making hitting enemies from afar much easier. Performing this attack during a combo performs the Chi Shot Combo Finisher, ending the current combo with an outward fan of Chi Shots {{in the direction}} you're facing. Both it and the Chi Blast are also used to charge crystals that will materialize platforms across otherwise-impassable chasms for T'ai to use.|$|E
5000|$|In Kero Blaster, {{the player}} {{controls}} a frog working for Cat & Frog, a teleporter company. Armed with a peashooter, {{he has to}} clean the teleporters of strange black monsters. The player has {{to work their way}} through a series of linear stages, by means of running, gunning and jumping. USGamer described the gameplay as [...] "akin to ... Contra or old-school, pre-Symphony of the Night Castlevanias." [...] Furthermore, the game is controlled by changing direction, jumping, firing your weapon and changing your weapon. Holding down the fire button continues to fire in <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> <b>you</b> were facing when you started shooting.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1990s, {{he wrote}} for cult cartoon spoof talk show, Space Ghost Coast to Coast, which process he {{described}} as:Two things: First you pitch them an idea {{that you want to}} do. Once they say they like <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> <b>you</b> are going, {{there is a lot of}} creative freedom, so they let you write it. They send you a list of people they have interviewed as guests. They have already done the interviews. They have the voice of Space Ghost ask a bunch of questions and they have a bunch of responses. You can pick your guest and see if it works within the premise of your show then you get to re-write the questions.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Chok' it all, wasn't <b>the</b> Lord-Lieutenant's <b>direction,</b> {{whenever}} <b>you</b> see Rainbarrow's Beacon burn to the nor'east'ard, or Haggardon to the nor'west'ard, or {{the actual}} {{presence of the}} enemy on the shore?' ...|$|R
50|$|Rivers: River symbol {{meanings}} {{deal with}} motion, <b>direction,</b> and <b>the</b> flow of our thoughts {{as well as}} our lives. When the river in the ace of wands Tarot card flows into our psychic vision it is a message that we must consider <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> we are taking in our lives. Specifically, since the ace of wands deals with passion and energy, we may want to consider where our actions are taking us. Take the time to reassess your goals and be confident you are heading in <b>the</b> life <b>direction</b> <b>you</b> desire.|$|R
