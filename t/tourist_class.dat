25|$|The Sylvania, {{like her}} sisters, was {{originally}} built {{with a general}} arrangement of three cargo holds located both to aft and forward of the superstructure, the passenger spaces located between them, with <b>tourist</b> <b>class</b> dominating the passenger spaces. Despite {{the dominance of the}} <b>tourist</b> <b>class,</b> her interiors were built to the elegant standards maintained by Cunard on their previous ships. Notable public spaces included a cinema with a balcony and even a soda fountain. The ship was also built with full air-conditioning.|$|E
25|$|In October 1966, she {{was again}} {{transferred}} back to P Lines. Passenger capacity was again changed to 455 {{in first class}} and 517 in <b>tourist</b> <b>class.</b>|$|E
25|$|Using the ship's {{versatile}} {{design to}} its full potential, the CGT began to send the France on winter cruises, which was off-season for the Atlantic trade. One design flaw was revealed when the ship reached warmer waters: her two swimming pools, one each for first and <b>tourist</b> <b>class,</b> were both indoors; the first class pool deep within the ship's hull, and the <b>tourist</b> <b>class</b> pool on an upper deck, but covered with an immovable glass dome. The latter, perhaps, was the more aggravating in hot weather. She also had limited outdoor deck space, with much of what was available protected behind thick glass wind-screens, useful on the North Atlantic, but frustrating when blocking cooling breezes in the tropics.|$|E

25|$|Queen Elizabeth 2s {{interior}} configuration {{was laid}} out in a horizontal fashion, similar to France, where the spaces dedicated to the two classes were spread horizontally on specific decks, in contrast to the vertical class divisions of older liners. Where QE2 differed from France was that the first class deck (Quarter Deck) was below the deck dedicated to <b>tourist</b> <b>class</b> (Upper Deck). Originally there were to be main lounges serving three classes, layered one atop the other, but when Cunard decided to make the ship a two class vessel, only two main lounges were needed. Instead of completely reconfiguring the Boat Deck, the ship's architects simply opened a well in the deck between what were to have been the second and third class lounges, creating a double height space known as the Double Room (now the Grand Lounge). This too was unconventional in that it designated a grander two-storey space for <b>tourist</b> <b>class</b> passengers, while first class passengers gathered in the standard height Queen's Room. However, the configuration for segregated Atlantic crossings gave first class passengers the theatre balcony on Boat Deck, while <b>tourist</b> <b>class</b> used the orchestra level on Upper Deck.|$|E
25|$|Launched on June 7, 1955, {{it offered}} modern amenities, like private {{plumbing}} in passenger cabins and air-conditioning throughout the ship. It {{was designed to}} carry freight and passengers, with first, cabin and <b>tourist</b> <b>class</b> accommodations. A perspex statue of Aphrodite, Birth of Aphrodite, which was carved by Arthur Fleischmann stood in the Embarcation Hall.|$|E
25|$|Some {{anomalies}} that contravened {{the class}} lines were Bar de l'Atlantique, essentially an after-hours club for drinking and dancing {{late into the}} night which was open to both First and <b>Tourist</b> <b>Class</b> passengers, the Tourist Children’s' Playroom, and the Chapel, open as well to both classes, all of which were located on First Class Pont Veranda.|$|E

Along with the usual economic analyses of the local <b>tourist</b> entrepreneur <b>class,</b> this article aims at devel-oping a historical, political and comparative perspective of the conditions that help to configure the local entrepreneurship.

Some Chinese tourists have increased their levels of spending from previous years. 30.26 percent of <b>tourists</b> are middle <b>class,</b> spending between $662 to $1,285.|$|R
25|$|One level {{down was}} Pont Promenade, the main <b>Tourist</b> <b>Class</b> deck. The main lounges and rooms here were the , , , and {{orchestra}} {{level of the}} theatre. Like the Pont Veranda, Pont Promenade also had a glass-enclosed promenade along the port and starboard sides of the ship, though the windows did not run full height, nor were the spaces as long.|$|E
25|$|The {{new ships}} {{reflected}} the economics and travel {{patterns of the}} post-war world—they were not built exclusively as passenger liners, but also included cargo-carrying facilities. Their passenger accommodation were divided into just two classes, first and tourist, with the <b>tourist</b> <b>class</b> occupying {{the majority of the}} ship. The outer dimensions of the ships were defined by the Saint Lawrence Seaway, as they {{had to be able to}} navigate from the Atlantic Ocean up to Montreal.|$|E
25|$|P had Harland and Wolff in Belfast refit her for {{civilian}} service. First class was abolished and all accommodation was made <b>tourist</b> <b>class,</b> which slightly increased total passenger capacity from 1,168 to 1,252. The dummy {{first and third}} funnels were removed, which made Strathnaver look more like her later sisters Stratheden, Strathallan and Strathmore. Strathaird had already had her dummy funnels removed in 1947. When she returned to service in 1950 she had accommodation for 567 passengers in first-class and 458 in tourist-class.|$|E
50|$|In May 1926 she was {{refitted}} {{to carry}} First, Second, <b>Tourist</b> and Third <b>class</b> passengers, and by April 1930 changed yet again to carry First, <b>Tourist</b> and Third <b>class.</b> Her last Rotterdam - New York voyage commenced 5 April 1940 therefore {{she managed to}} escape before the Netherlands was overrun and surrendered to the Germans May 1940.|$|R
50|$|Transaero's Premium Economy Class {{offered the}} same seat width as the <b>Tourist</b> Economy <b>Class</b> but a greater seat pitch {{of up to}} 36 inches and {{enhanced}} recline features for a recline of 29 degrees(just over 7 inches). The Premium Economy Class seats on the 777-300 were also distinguished by red seats instead of the blue seats in <b>Tourist</b> Economy <b>Class.</b> In addition to more seat pitch, recline and free food, Transaero also offers a larger baggage allowance for the Premium Economy class fares. The in-flight-entertainment system was available for free, with Lumexis AVOD on select Boeing 747-400s and all Boeing 777-300s. Passengers flying Premium Economy were also able {{to make use of}} a dedicated check-in desk at selected airports.|$|R
50|$|Lloyd {{worked as}} a miner, and in 1912 {{was part of the}} Monmouthshire County team that faced the touring South Africans. Lloyd played well and gave the Springbok halves, Freddie Luyt and Uncle Dobbin a {{difficult}} match, though the <b>tourists</b> <b>class</b> shone through to win the game comfortably. A scrum-half, Lloyd was first capped for Wales in a winning game against Scotland on 1 February 1913. The game was played at Inverleith and both sides had a sparsity of international experience; though Wales were captained by the veteran Billy Trew. Lloyd played in the next six consecutive games in the 1913 and 1914 Five Nations Championships, which saw Wales finish second to England in both tournaments. Lloyd was a favourite at Pontypool {{and was one of the}} finest scrum-halves produced by the club.|$|R
25|$|The jet age {{arrived in}} South Africa on 3 May 1952 when a BOAC de Havilland Comet arrived in Palmietfontein after a 24-hour journey with five {{refuelling}} stops en route. South African chartered two Comets from the British airline; on 4 October 1953, when Comet G-ANAV left London for Johannesburg. On {{the same day}} <b>Tourist</b> <b>Class</b> was introduced on the 58-seater Lockheed Constellation on the Springbok Service. The two chartered aircraft sported both BOAC and SAA titles and logos but were operated by South African's crew.|$|E
25|$|Owned by Isak Skaugen, Skaubryn {{was first}} {{intended}} to be a shelter deck cargo ship for one of his companies, Eikland. She was built by the Öresundsvarvet Shipbuilding Company in Landskrona, Sweden, and launched on October 7, 1950. Whilst being fitted out, Skaugen decided to have her completed as an emigrant liner, and she was transferred to the Howaldtswerke shipyard for completion as a passenger liner. When completed she offered <b>tourist</b> <b>class</b> accommodation for 1,205 passengers, as well as eight twin-bedded cabins accommodating 16 first class passengers on the bridge deck.|$|E
25|$|On 3 March 1950 {{the ship}} was {{transferred}} from P to the Home Lines-affiliated Compania de Navegacion Incres SA (Incres Shipping Company) of Panama for £95,000. She was renamed SS Europa, converted to take 614 <b>tourist</b> <b>class</b> passengers, was stripped of her refrigerated cargo space, and placed into service transporting stateless immigrants from Europe to the United States and Canada. She was Italian-crewed, and first sailed from Genoa; later crossings began from Antwerp and later Le Havre. A stop en route was made at Plymouth to collect British immigrants. The destinations were Halifax, Nova Scotia and New York City. The Europa continued in this service {{until the end of}} September, 1951.|$|E

On 16 October, 1929, Żwirko and Antoni Kocjan set an international FAI altitude record of 4,004 m (13,133 ft) in the light <b>tourist</b> plane <b>class</b> (below 280 kg / 616 lb empty weight).|$|R
25|$|On July 17, 1956, Andrea Doria {{set sail}} {{from her home}} port of Genoa on {{what should have been}} a routine nine-day {{crossing}} between Italy and the United States. It was to be her 51st westbound crossing. Before setting course for the open Atlantic, she made stops at three ports where the Italian Line had established passenger terminals to pick up more passengers. She first stopped at the French port of Cannes, then returned to the southeast to Naples on July 18 before making her last stop at Gibraltar on July 20. After leaving Gibraltar, she had a total complement of 1,134 passengers aboard, barely 100 shy of her passenger capacity of 1,241. They consisted of 190 first class passengers, 267 cabin class passengers and 677 <b>tourist</b> <b>class</b> passengers, which along with her crew of 572 came to a total of 1,706 people aboard.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the lives lost in the collision, three more of the Andrea Dorias passengers died from injuries and ailments which occurred {{during and after the}} evacuation. Norma Di Sandro, a four-year-old Italian girl traveling in <b>tourist</b> <b>class</b> with her parents, Tullio and Filomena Di Sandro, was dropped on her head into a lifeboat by her panicked father. She was taken to the Stockholm and subsequently airlifted to Brighton Marine Hospital in Boston, where she died from a fractured cranium without ever regaining consciousness. Carl Watres, a businessman from Manasquan, New Jersey, who was traveling in cabin class aboard the Doria with his wife Lillian, died from a sudden heart attack while en route to New York aboard the Stockholm. Angelina Grego, a 48-year-old, broke her back after falling into one of the lifeboats from the Ile de France. She was taken to St. Claire's Hospital in New York City, where she lingered in an immense amount of pain and suffering until her death six months later.|$|E
25|$|C deck was {{the highest}} deck within the ship's hull. Third class cabins were in the {{starboard}} bow section, and the third class dining room was opposite of the cabins. After the third class area were more first-class cabins, terminating at a stair tower. Aft of the stairwell were second-class berths without private bath facilities, and aft of the second-class rooms was a sheltered promenade. B deck consisted mostly of public space. The first class and <b>tourist</b> <b>class</b> dining areas were both located amidships, separated by the ship's galley. The first class dining saloon was lit with fluorescent lights and equipped with apparatus to minimize sensation of the roll of the ship. The second-class dining area {{was similar to the}} first-class area, but not as lavish, and also doubled as the ship's cinema. The bow section of B Deck had more third-class accommodations and the third-class ship entrance. A deck had mostly crew's quarters, storage rooms, and had the ship's engines. There were also third class cabins in the bow. Notably, Cambodges original steam turbine engine never suffered significant breakdowns and never had to be replaced.|$|E

500|$|Hack would {{eventually}} be dropped in favor of NetHack (1987). When Mike Stephenson, an analyst at a computer hardware manufacturer, took maintainership of Hacks code, he improved it, taking suggestions from Izchak Miller, a philosophy professor at University of Pennsylvania, and Janet Walz, another computer hacker. Calling themselves the DevTeam, they began to make major modifications to Hacks code. [...] They named their new version NetHack, {{in part due to}} their collaboration over the game being done through USENET. NetHacks major deviations from Hack were the introduction of a wider variety of monsters, borrowing from other mythologies and lores, including anachronistic and contemporary cultural elements (such as a <b>tourist</b> <b>class</b> with a flash-bulb camera inspired by Terry Pratchett's Discworld series) in the high fantasy setting, and the use of pre-defined levels with some procedural elements that the player would encounter deeper in the dungeons. Further iterations of the game included branching pathways through the dungeon and optional character-based quests that could grant the player an extremely useful item to complete the game. Though the DevTeam released the code publicly, they carefully maintained who could contribute to the code base to avoid excessive forking of the vanilla game, and remain relatively quiet about suggested improvements to each release, working in relatively secrecy from its player base. There are separate forks of NetHack, such as Slash'EM.|$|E
