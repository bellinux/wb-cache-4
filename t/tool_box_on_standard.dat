In comparison with Ob'yekt 765Sp1, Ob'yekt 764 was 4 mm higher, had a maximum swimming speed of 10 km/h, a lower maximum range (550 km on road) and a reduced number of firing ports for its passenger's armament (six). The vehicle had a curved shock-absorber behind the first road wheel and the rear fender and two <b>tool</b> stowage <b>boxes</b> <b>on</b> the fenders. To start production of the new vehicle, the design of the fighting and troop compartments were improved. Unlike the BMP-1, Ob'yekt 764 used a waterjet for swimming, which was removed to save space inside the vehicle. Ob'yekt 764 also had a larger main fuel tank, while the BMP-1 had the main fuel tank reduced in size and partially placed under the troop compartment.|$|R
5000|$|BMP-1 (Ob'yekt 765Sp1) (Sp {{stands for}} spetsifikatsiya - specification) - An early type with a shorter nose section {{and a larger}} angled plate {{at the top of}} the hull line. The two <b>tool</b> stowage <b>boxes</b> <b>on</b> the fenders were removed. The swim vanes were {{modified}} by reducing the number of vanes from seven to four and the fender profile was raised nearer to the horizontal. The fume extraction ports on the hull roof to the rear of the turret were moved outwards and reoriented to point toward the rear of the vehicle. The single torsion bar used to spring the rear roof troop hatches was replaced by a twin torsion bar system. The firing ports on the side were moved up into the armor plate, giving the weapons used in the ports a higher degree of elevation. The vehicle weighs 12.6 tonnes. It was built from 1966 to 1969. It is sometimes incorrectly known as the BMP-A by some Western sources. NATO gave it the designation BMP Model 1966.|$|R

As the contributors to the construction industry raises {{the complexity of the}} industry too raises demanding us to explore and analyze the industry with much needed attention. The bidders who can cope up with the competitive nature of the bidding only will survive. Therefore it is very much in importance to have a bidding strategy, which leads to win- win situation to both the client and the contractor. The critical early analysis of factors affecting the mark- up size decision for any given project plays a vital role. The contractors' behavior of bidding affects by a large number of factors which ranging from the construction company characteristics (internal to the company considered) to Macro Economic environment (society at large) including the project specific characteristics. In this context the bidding decisions are of highly complex, unstructured where clear guidelines are difficult to set up. The decisions on bidding will be usually made based on the intuition and experience of the domain experts. The aim of this exercise is to develop a Knowledge Based System (KBS) to help the contractors to streamline their attention on to most critical factors identified, which are affecting bidding decision and to suggest a reasonable range of mark up size for a given project under specific context. There were ten important factors selected through intensive literature review; Availability of Projects, Need for work, Owner Client relation, Past profits in similar projects, Rate of return in investment, Experience in similar projects, Cash flow (negative), Current work load, Competition, and the KBS was developed using the Fuzzy logic <b>tool</b> <b>box</b> <b>on</b> Matlab platform. ThisKBS enables the decision makers to evaluate the impact of said factors on a specific bid situation. Given the subjective nature of the mark up size decision the Fuzzy set theory, which is a sub branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI), enables the assessments to be arrived in qualitative and approximate terms. Seven decision rules were constructed based on the expert comments. Seven sets of data analysis were carried out in this system. The quality of information and awareness of the decision on mark up size of a particular tentative project that can be gained from this model may help the construction companies to obtain a competitive edge in biddin...|$|R

The {{reason is the}} following conflict: On the one hand, computing with rounded arithmetic may question the reliability of programs while, on the other hand, computing with exact arithmetic may be too expensive and hence inefficient.
