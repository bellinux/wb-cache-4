The optical loss is examined theoretically using a simple waveguide model from the scalar Helmholtz equation. The modal loss of fabricated lasers is extracted from the observed spectral-mode splitting. The effect of modal loss on the slope effi-ciency and modal behavior is examined.

40|$|Magnetic effects at optical {{frequencies}} {{are notoriously}} weak, so magneto-optical devices must be large {{to create a}} sufficient effect. In graphene, {{it has been shown}} that inhomogeneous strains can induce 'pseudomagnetic fields' that behave in a similar manner to real ones. Here, we show experimentally and theoretically that it is possible to induce such a field at optical frequencies in a photonic lattice. To our knowledge, this is the first realization of a pseudomagnetic field in optics. The field yields 'photonic Landau levels' separated by bandgaps in the spatial spectrum of the structured dielectric lattice. The gaps between these highly degenerate levels lead to <b>transverse</b> <b>optical</b> <b>confinement.</b> The use of strain allows for the exploration of magnetic-like effects in a non-resonant way that would be otherwise inaccessible in optics. It also suggests the possibility that aperiodic photonic-crystal structures can achieve greater field enhancement and slow-light effects than periodic structures via high density of states at the Landau levels. Generalizing these concepts to systems beyond optics, such as matter waves in optical potentials, offers new intriguing physics that is fundamentally different from that in purely periodic structures...|$|E

40|$|The Vertical-Cavity Surface-Emitting Laser (VCSEL) is an {{established}} optical source in short-distance optical communication links, computer mice and tailored infrared power heating systems. Its low power consumption, easy integration into two-dimensional arrays, and low-cost manufacturing also make {{this type of}} semiconductor laser suitable for application {{in areas such as}} high-resolution printing, bio-medical and general lighting. However, these applications require emission wavelengths in the blue-UV instead of the established infrared regime, which can be achieved by using GaN-based instead of GaAs-based materials. The development of GaN-based VCSELs have shown to be challenging, and so far only a handful research groups have demonstrated lasing from such electrically pumped devices [1 - 6]. The presented performance is typically orders of magnitudes lower compared to that from electrically driven GaAs-based VCSELs. Some of the challenges are to achieve efficient transverse current spreading, <b>transverse</b> <b>optical</b> mode <b>confinement,</b> high-reflectivity mirrors and resonator length control. This talk will summarize the different strategies to solve these issues in electrically pumped GaN-VCSELs together with state-of-the-art results. We will highlight our work on combined <b>transverse</b> current and <b>optical</b> mode <b>confinement,</b> where we show that many structures used for current confinement result in unintentionally optically anti-guided resonators. Such resonators can have a very high optical loss, which easily doubles the threshold gain for lasing [7]. We will also present an alternative to the use of distributed Bragg reflectors as high-reflectivity mirrors, namely a TiO 2 /air high contrast gratings (HCGs). Fabricated HCGs of this type show a high reflectivity (> 95 %) over a 25 nm wavelength span, which is in excellent agreement to the reflectivity spectrum predicted by numerical simulations assuming an ideal HCG geometry [8].

The laser trap consists of a primary trapping beam, and a counterpropagating self-pumped phase conjugate beam, the latter being derived from the primary signalbeam when it is transmitted through the sample and phase conjugated in a photorefractive crystal. Using a fundamental TEMOO gaussian beam from an Ar-ion laser (514 nm), and a barium titanate (BaTiO 3) crystal in the CAT (total internal reflection) geometry, an optical laser trap was created using 25 mW of laser power.

40|$|Vertical cavity surface {{emitting}} laser (VCSEL) {{sources have}} been adopted into Gigabit Ethernet applications in a remarkably short time period. VCSELs are particularly suitable for multimode optical fiber local area networks (LANs), due to their reduced threshold current, circular output beam, and inexpensive and high volume manufacture. Moreover, selectively oxidized VCSELs are nearly ideal LAN sources since the oxide aperture within the laser cavity produces strong electrical and <b>optical</b> <b>confinement</b> which enables high electrical to optical conversion efficiency and minimal modal discrimination allowing emission into multiple <b>transverse</b> <b>optical</b> modes.

Shear force topography and two photon induced photoluminescence (TPI-PL) images captured simultaneously by the system facilitated to clarify the correlation between the local geometry and the emitted photon of TPI-PL.
