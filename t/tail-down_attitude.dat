2500|$|The first GV-103L, {{as it was}} {{originally}} called, was a two- or three-seat light touring aircraft first flown in 1969. Later {{referred to as the}} GV-103 and powered by an 86kW (115hp) Lycoming O-235 flat-four engine, it led to several production variants with two, three and four seats using engines of increasing power within the same airframe. It had a side-by-side seating layout and a fixed tricycle undercarriage with a longer nosewheel which gave the aircraft a pronounced <b>tail-down</b> <b>attitude</b> on the ground. [...] Its construction was primarily metal but included some glass fibre structures and plastic bonding, novel at the time.|$|E
2500|$|The Attacker {{suffered}} from deficiencies {{which led to}} it quickly being superseded; one being that the aircraft retained the Spiteful's tail-wheel undercarriage (due {{to the extent of}} the re-tooling that would have been required to alter the Spiteful's wing), rather than a nose-wheel undercarriage, thus making the Attacker more difficult to land on aircraft carriers. This same <b>tail-down</b> <b>attitude</b> meant that when operating from grass airfields the jet exhaust would create a long furrow in the ground that [...] "three men could lie down in". Also the new wing was apparently aerodynamically inferior to the original Spitfire elliptic one, with lower critical Mach number, leading to someone quipping that [...] "they rather should have left the Spitfire wing on the thing".|$|E

50|$|The Fantastic Four's Pogo Plane, {{so-called}} {{because of}} its <b>tail-down</b> landing/take-off <b>attitude,</b> was the first significant air-breathing engine design of Reed Richards. Employing new turbine blade configurations and a new titanium-alloy process, Richards increased overall engine performance to a very high thrust-to-weight ratio. It is loosely based on the never mass-produced Convair XFY Pogo.|$|R
2500|$|The Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) {{became a}} {{significant}} customer of the Sea Fury, {{and many of}} its aircraft were diverted from existing Royal Navy contracts. On 23 June 1948, the first aircraft was accepted at RCAF Rockcliffe. The type was quickly put to use replacing Canada's existing inventory of Seafires, taking on the primary role of fleet air defence operating from the aircraft carrier [...] Two Canadian squadrons operated the Sea Fury, Nos. 803 and 883 Squadrons, which were later renumbered as 870 and 871. Pilot training on the Sea Fury was normally conducted at the RCN's HMCS Shearwater land base. Landing difficulties with the Sea Fury were experienced following the RCN's decision to convert to the US Navy's deck landing procedures, which were prone to overstressing and damaging the airframes as the Sea Fury had been designed for a <b>tail-down</b> landing <b>attitude.</b> The Sea Fury would be operated between 1948 and 1956 by the RCN, at which point they were replaced by the jet-powered McDonnell F2H Banshee. The aircraft themselves were put into storage, and some were subsequently purchased by civilians.|$|R
40|$|Tests {{were made}} of a 1 / 10 -scale {{dynamically}} similar model of the North American XFJ- 1 airplane to study its behavior when ditched. The model was landed in calm water at the Langley tank no. 2 monorail. Various landing attitudes, speeds, and conditions of damage were simulated. The behavior of the model was determined from visual observations, by recording the accelerations, and by taking motion pictures of the ditchings. Data are presented in tabular form, sequence photographs, and time-history acceleration curves. From {{the results of the}} tests it was concluded that the airplane should be ditched at the near-stall, <b>tail-down</b> landing <b>attitude</b> of 12 deg. The flaps should be fully extended to obtain the lowest possible landing speed. The wing-tip tanks should be jettisoned if any appreciable load of fuel remains; if empty, they should be retained for additional buoyancy. In a calm-water ditching the airplane will probably run about 600 feet Maximum longitudinal decelerations of about 2. 5 g and maximum vertical acceleration of about 2 g will be encountered. The nose-intake duct will be clear of the water until practically all forward motion has stopped...|$|R
