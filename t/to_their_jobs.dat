5|$|After the First World War ended, severe discontent among farmers (over wheat prices) {{and union}} members (over wage rates) {{resulted}} in an upsurge of radicalism, coupled with a polarization over the rise of Bolshevism in Russia. The most dramatic result was the Winnipeg general strike of 1919. It began on 15 May and collapsed on 25 June 1919; as the workers gradually returned <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>jobs,</b> the Central Strike Committee decided to end the movement.|$|E
5|$|Orange Bowl {{organizers}} {{predicted that}} Virginia Tech fans, who were located {{closer to the}} site of the game, would be attracted by its proximity and the warm weather offered by southern Florida. Delta Air Lines added more flights from Virginia to Florida in anticipation. To entice more fans to attend, tourism officials planned to step up their advertising in order to boost the economic impact of the event, estimated in 2009 at $200million. The advertising campaign was a difficult sell because the game was scheduled for the first Monday after New Year's Day, the date when most American workers return <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>jobs</b> after the New Year.|$|E
5|$|On 1 August 1940, Governor-General Hans Frank {{issued a}} decree {{requiring}} all Kraków Jews {{to leave the}} city within the next two weeks. Only those who had jobs directly related to the German war effort would be allowed to stay. Of the 60,000 to 80,000 Jews then living in the city, only 15,000 remained by March 1941. These Jews were then forced to leave their traditional neighbourhood of Kazimierz and relocate to the walled Kraków Ghetto, established in the industrial Podgórze district. Schindler's workers travelled on foot to and from the ghetto each day <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>jobs</b> at the factory. Enlargements to the facility in the four years Schindler was in charge included the addition of an outpatient clinic, co-op, kitchen, and dining room for the workers, in addition to expansion of the factory and its related office space.|$|E

40|$|Background: This study {{explored}} {{the perspectives of}} people with intellectual disabilities on themes relevant <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>job</b> satisfaction in integrated and sheltered employment. Method: The photovoice method was used. Nine participants with moderate to mild intellectual disabilities, working in integrated and sheltered employment, took pictures of aspects related <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>job</b> satisfaction. Each participant was subsequently interviewed about his/her pictures. Interview transcripts were content analysed to distinguish themes. Results: Nine themes were found: {{the nature of the}} work itself, working conditions, experienced job demands, social relations at work, received support, perceived autonomy, opportunities for using competencies, opportunities for growth and development and meaningfulness. All themes were applicable in integrated and sheltered employment. Conclusions: From the perspective of people with intellectual disabilities, various themes relate <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>job</b> satisfaction, either in positive or negative ways. Photovoice appeared to be a valuable approach, facilitating participants in expressing their views and providing in-depth information...|$|R

25|$|In {{the last}} decades of the 19th century further changes in {{northern}} Westchester negatively affected the West Somers church.

The growing city, in need of water, began acquiring large tracts of land, sometimes including whole communities, in the area through eminent domain, reducing the total amount of land available for development and thus driving up the value of what remained. This induced many of the area's farmers, the population from which West Somers had grown, to sell their farms for subdivision and development.|$|E

About one in every three users of mass transit in the United States and two-thirds of the nation's rail riders live in New York and its suburbs, and New York City's public transit system accounts for nearly four times as many passenger miles as the Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles metro regions combined. Only 6% of shopping trips by New Yorkers involve the use of a car.|$|E

Eager {{to find some way}} to break ground and begin the construction of the subway system, WMATA asked voters in the two states to approve construction bonds for the subway. They overwhelming did so in November 1968, with 72 percent of voters in favor. Natcher also agreed in the fall of 1968 to release funds for architectural plans, engineering design, and land acquisition (but not construction) of Metro, and Metro broke ground in December 1969. But as Natcher continued to withhold construction funds through 1971, citizens of Maryland and Virginia began to think that the money they had invested in Metro would be wasted. Soon, political pressure was building on members of Congress from these two states to stop Natcher and move ahead with Metro.|$|E
