40|$|Asian {{terrestrial}} {{records of}} the Eocene-Oligocene Transition (EOT) are rare and, when available, often poorly constrained in time, {{even though they are}} crucial in understanding the atmospheric impact of <b>this</b> <b>major</b> <b>step</b> in Cenozoic climate deterioration. Here, we present a detailed cyclostratigraphic study of the continuous continental EOT succession deposited between ~ 35 to 33 Ma in the Xining Basin at the northeastern edge of Tibetan Plateau. Lithology supplemented with high-resolution magnetic susceptibility (MS), median grain size (MGS) and color reflectance (a*) records reveal a prominent ~ 3. 4 m thick basic cyclicity of alternating playa gypsum and dry mudflat red mudstones of latest Eocene age. The magnetostratigraphic age model indicates that this cyclicity was most likely forced by the 41 -kyr obliquity cycle driving oscillations of drier and wetter conditions in Asian interior climate from at least 1 million year before the EOT. In addition, our results suggest a duration of ~ 0. 9 Myr for magnetochron C 13 r that is in accordance with radiometric dates from continental successions in Wyoming, USA, albeit somewhat shorter than in current time scales. Detailed comparison of the EOT interval in the Tashan section with marine records suggest that the most pronounced lithofacies change in the Xining Basin corresponds to the first of two widely recognized steps in oxygen isotopes across the EOT. This first step precedes the major and second step (i. e. the base of Oi- 1) and has recently been reported to be mainly related to atmospheric cooling rather than ice volume growth. Coincidence with lithofacies changes in our Chinese record would suggest that the atmospheric impact of the first step was of global significance, while the major ice volume increase of the second step did not significantly affect Asian interior climate...|$|E
40|$|The {{authors would}} like to thank Christian Tenaud (LIMSI - CNRS) for {{providing}} the basis of the multi-resolution kernel of MR CHORUS, code that he developed at LIMSI for compressible Navier-Stokes equations. International audienceIn silico research in medicine is thought to reduce the need for expensive clinical trials under the condition of reliable mathematical models and accurate and efficient numerical methods. In the present work, we tackle the numerical simulation of reaction-diffusion equations modeling human ischemic stroke. This problem induces peculiar difficulties like potentially large stiffness which stems from the broad spectrum of temporal scales in the nonlinear chemical source term as well as from the presence of steep spatial gradients in the reaction fronts, spatially very localized. Furthermore, simulations on realistic 3 D geometries are mandatory in order to describe correctly this type of phenomenon. The main goal of this article is to obtain, for the first time, 3 D simulations on realistic geometries and to show that the simulation results are consistent with those obtain in experimental studies or observed on MRI images in stroke patients. For this purpose, we introduce a new resolution strategy based mainly on time operator splitting that takes into account complex geometry coupled with a well-conceived parallelization strategy for shared memory architectures. We consider then a high order implicit time integration for the reaction and an explicit one for the diffusion term in order to build a time operator splitting scheme that exploits efficiently the special features of each problem. Thus, we aim at solving complete and realistic models including all time and space scales with conventional computing resources, that is on a reasonably powerful workstation. Consequently and as expected, 2 D and also fully 3 D numerical simulations of ischemic strokes for a realistic brain geometry, are conducted for the first time and shown to reproduce the dynamics observed on MRI images in stroke patients. Beyond <b>this</b> <b>major</b> <b>step,</b> in order to improve accuracy and computational efficiency of the simulations, we indicate how the present numerical strategy can be coupled with spatial adaptive multiresolution schemes. Preliminary results in the framework of simple geometries allow to assess the proposed strategy for further developments...|$|E
40|$|On 10 December 2007 Minister-President Kris Peeters and Minister Patricia Ceysens {{disclosed}} {{the plans}} of the Flemish Government {{to build a new}} research vessel to replace the current vessel RV Zeeleeuw. The Flanders Marine Institute (VLIZ) will be responsible for the scientific programme and management of the research equipment. DAB Vloot (MDK) will ensure the good operation of the new coastal vessel. The ship was named Simon Stevin after a Flemish intellectual jack-of-all-trades (° 1548, Bruges) with numerous maritime and hydraulic achievements. By constructing this new research vessel Flanders not only undertakes to provide a successor for the oceanographic vessel RV Zeeleeuw but also wants to stress that it continues to invest in scientific and technological innovations as an engine for a sustainable society. Since 2001 marine researchers have been able to board the Zeeleeuw to carry out scientific samplings in the North Sea and the Scheldt Estuary. Constructed in 1977, the Zeeleeuw was converted from a pilot vessel into a research vessel for this purpose in 2000. In recent years it has become clear how this investment has resulted in better and more multidisciplinary marine scientific top research in our region and to training opportunities for marine scientists. A recent poll and feasibility study among the over 500 marine scientists in Flanders confirmed that there is a great need for logistic support of their research. Within this context priority needs to be given to a modern and well equipped vessel with a shallow draught and swift access to the shallow coastal waters of the southern bight of the North Sea and the adjacent river estuaries. By building this new vessel Minister Patricia Ceysens wants to continue along the path of innovation in the field of research and technology. The new ship will meet the established need to spend time on board within the scope of research of monitoring and will keep Flemish scientists in the European lead. The new research vessel will furthermore be able to actively contribute to international marine management obligations and to substantiating the Flemish policy on fishing and port accessibility. The ship will also be used for training and educational purposes and as a test platform for new maritime technologies. In its capacity as multifunctional shipowner on behalf of the Flemish Government the DAB Vloot (Agency for Maritime and Coastal Services) will use its nautical and technical expertise to ensure good operation of the vessel. The Flanders Marine Institute (VLIZ) will be responsible for the scientific programme of the voyages and the management of the research equipment. As a result of <b>this</b> <b>major</b> <b>step</b> in the support of marine scientific research the VLIZ will be able to fulfil its role as a facilitator of marine scientific knowledge development and as a marine focal point for the international community even better in the future. Minister Ceysens also announced the purchase of additional land-based facilities. These facilities are located {{within walking distance of the}} VLIZ and are part of the InnovOcean site, the central site for oceanographic initiatives on the east bank in Ostend. Minister-President Peeters has undertaken to ensure that the vessel is manned and maintained by DAB Vloot and leaves port daily for research purposes...|$|E
