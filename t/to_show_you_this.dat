Following Euler, we define a partition of the positive integer n as a representation of n as a sum of positive integers, in which order is unimportant. The partitions of 4 are 4 = 3 + 1 = 2 + 2 = 2 + 1 + 1 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1. The number of partitions of n is denoted by p(n); thus, p(4) = 5. For convenience, we define p(0) = 1.

As neither individuals were in equal agreement on choosing a perspective to conceive the film, Kosinski asked Bailey to lend him money in order to create a conceptual prototype of the Tron: Legacy universe, which was eventually presented at the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con International. [...] "So, we went into Disney," [...] he recalled, [...] "and I told them, 'We can talk about this all day, but in order to really get on the same page, I need <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> what <b>this</b> world looks and feels like.

By this office he prevents not temporal punishment, but by it he chiefly preserveth the soul from hell. 4. By this office he brings in no justifying righteousness for us, he only thereby prevaileth to have the dispose of that brought in by himself, as Priest, for the justifying of those, by a new and fresh act, who had made their justification doubtful by new falls into sin.

6000|$|Now, my Lords, you {{see that}} all these estates, except 25,782l. a year, were either jaghires for the Nabob's own {{immediate}} family, settled by his father upon his mother, and by his father's father upon his grandmother, and upon Salar Jung, his uncle, or were {{the property of the}} most considerable nobility, to the gross amount of 285,000l. Mr. Hastings confesses that the Nabob reluctantly made the confiscation to the extent proposed. Why? [...] "Because," [...] says he, [...] "the orderlies, namely, certain persons so called, subservient to his debaucheries, were persons whom he wished to spare." [...] Now I am <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> that <b>this</b> man, whatever faults he may have in his private morals, (with which we have nothing at all to do,) has been slandered throughout by Mr. Hastings. Take his own account of the matter. [...] "The Nabob," [...] says he, [...] "would have confiscated all the rest, except his orderlies, whom he would have spared; but I, finding where his partiality lay, compelled him to sacrifice the whole; for otherwise he would have sacrificed the good to save the bad: whereas," [...] says Mr. Hastings, [...] "in effect my principle was to sacrifice the good, {{and at the same time}} to punish the bad." [...] Now compare the account he gives of the proceedings of Asoph ul Dowlah with his own. Asoph ul Dowlah, to save some unworthy persons who had jaghires, would, if left to his own discretion, have confiscated those only of the deserving; while Mr. Hastings, to effect the inclusion of the worthless in the confiscation, confiscates the jaghires of the innocent and the virtuous men of high rank, and of those who had all the ties of Nature to plead for the Nabob's forbearance, and reduced them to a state of dependency and degradation.|$|R

Look here; I will tell you all that I know about the matter, which is not much. One afternoon, just before sunset, I was sitting on the veranda, when a poor, miserable, starved-looking man came limping up and squatted down before me. I asked him where he came from and what he wanted, and thereon he plunged into a long rambling narrative about how he belonged to a tribe far in the north, and how his tribe was destroyed by another tribe, and he with a few other survivors driven still further north past a lake named Laga. Thence, it appears, {{he made his way to}} another lake that lay up in the mountains, [...] "a lake without a bottom" [...] he called it, and here his wife and brother died of an infectious sickness -- probably smallpox -- whereon the people drove him out of their villages into the wilderness, where he wandered miserably over mountains for ten days, after which he got into dense thorn forest, and was one day found there by some white men who were hunting, and who took him to a place where all the people were white and lived in stone houses. Here he remained a week shut up in a house, till one night a man with a white beard, whom he understood to be a [...] "medicine-man", came and inspected him, after which he was led off and taken through the thorn forest to the confines of the wilderness, and given food and this sword (at least so he said), and turned loose.' ...|$|R

It {{would be}} easy <b>to</b> go on <b>showing</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> same thing in many more instances; but my {{business}} to-night is <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> its full effect in one thing only, namely, in art, and I must come straightway to that, as I have little enough time. This, then, is the great and broad fact which distinguishes modern art from old art; that all ancient art was religious, and all modern art is profane. Once more, your patience for an instant. I say, all ancient art was religious; that is to say, religion was its first object; private luxury or pleasure its second. I say all modern art is profane; that is, private luxury or pleasure is its first object; religion its second. Now you all know, that anything which makes religion its second object, makes religion no object. God will {{put up with a}} great many things in the human heart, but there is one thing He will not put up with in it--a second place. He who offers God a second place, offers Him no place. And there is another mighty truth which you all know, that he who makes religion his first object, makes it his whole object; he has no other work in the world than God's work. Therefore I do not say that ancient art was more religious than modern art. There is no question of degree in this matter. Ancient art was religious art; modern art is profane art; and between the two the distinction is as firm as between light and darkness.|$|R
5000|$|The region around Herat Province became Islamized in 642 AD, {{during the}} end of Muslim conquest of Persia. In 653-4 AD, General Abdur Rahman bin Samara arrived from Zaranj to the Zunbil capital Zamindawar with an army of around 6,000 Arab Muslims. The General [...] "broke off a hand of the idol and plucked out the rubies which were its eyes in order to persuade the Marzbān of Sīstān of the god's worthlessness." [...] He {{explained}} to the worshippers of the solar deity, [...] "my intention was <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> that <b>this</b> idol can do neither any harm nor good." [...] The people of southern Afghanistan began accepting Islam from this date onward. The Arabs then proceeded to Ghazni and Kabul to convert or conquer the Buddhist Shahi rulers. However, most historians claim that the rulers of Ghazni and Kabul remained non-Muslim. There is no information {{on the number of}} converts although the Arabs unsuccessfully continued their missions of invading the land to spread Islam for the next 200 or so years. It was in 870 AD when Ya'qub bin Laith as-Saffar finally conquered Afghanistan by establishing Muslim governors throughout the provinces. [...] "Arab armies carrying the banner of Islam came out of the west to defeat the Sasanians in 642 AD and then they marched with confidence to the east. On the western periphery of the Afghan area the princes of Herat and Seistan gave way to rule by Arab governors but in the east, in the mountains, cities submitted only to rise in revolt and the hastily converted returned to their old beliefs once the armies passed. The harshness and avariciousness of Arab rule produced such unrest, however, that once the waning power of the Caliphate became apparent, native rulers once again established themselves independent. Among these the Saffarids of Seistan shone briefly in the Afghan area. The fanatic founder of this dynasty, the coppersmith's apprentice Yaqub ibn Layth Saffari, came forth from his capital at Zaranj in 870 AD and marched through Bost, Kandahar, Ghazni, Kabul, Bamyan, Balkhand Herat, conquering in the name of Islam.".

60|$|<b>To</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> that <b>this</b> {{supposition}} is by {{no means}} an unreasonable one, let me now point out what took place in the case of Seth Wright's sheep, where it happened {{to be a matter of}} moment to him to obtain a breed or raise a flock of sheep like that accidental variety that I have described--and I will tell you why. In that part of Massachusetts where Seth Wright was living, the fields were separated by fences, and the sheep, which were very active and robust, would roam abroad, and without much difficulty jump over these fences into other people's farms. As a matter of course, this exuberant activity on the part of the sheep constantly gave rise to all sorts of quarrels, bickerings, and contentions among the farmers of the neighbourhood; so it occurred to Seth Wright, who was, like his successors, more or less 'cute, that if he could get a stock of sheep like those with the bandy legs, they would not be able to jump over the fences so readily, and he acted upon that idea. He killed his old ram, and as soon as the young one arrived at maturity, he bred altogether from it. The result was even more striking than in the human experiment which I mentioned just now. Colonel Humphreys testifies that it always happened that the offspring were either pure Ancons or pure ordinary sheep; that in no case was there any mixing of the Ancons with the others. In consequence of this, in the course of a very few years, the farmer was able to get a very considerable flock of this variety, and a large number of them were spread throughout Massachusetts. Most unfortunately, however--I suppose it was because they were so common--nobody took enough notice of them to preserve their skeletons; and although Colonel Humphreys states that he sent a skeleton to the President of the Royal Society at the same time that he forwarded his paper, I am afraid that the variety has entirely disappeared; for a short time after these sheep had become prevalent in that district, the Merino sheep were introduced; and as their wool was much more valuable, and as they were a quiet race of sheep, and <b>showed</b> no tendency <b>to</b> trespass or jump over fences, the Otter breed of sheep, the wool of which was inferior to that of the Merino, was gradually allowed to die out.|$|R

In a following part, our four cases of organisational learning in the steam cracker will be presented. This paper is structured {{in such a way that}} we will first give you some background on a case, then discuss the case in detail to then make the link with organisational learning. A first case is about the re-evaluation of standard procedures. We will have a look at what a standard operating procedure is exactly, what the role of a plant manual is and how operators can make suggestions for improvement on the standard operating procedures. A second case is the competence management system they have implemented at Company B and at the steam cracker. First we will have a look at the job of an operator, then investigate the organisation of labour at the steam cracker and indicate some pitfalls <b>to</b> finally <b>show</b> <b>you</b> how <b>this</b> is a case of organisational learning. In a third case we will have a look at the organisational structure of Company B and indicate how this structure provides learning and knowledge sharing possibilities, which would otherwise not be present.

We will indicate what happened and which initiatives have been taken to prevent something similar from happening again. In a conclusive part, we will present you an overview matrix, showing how these cases are related to the five criteria of organisational learning. European commission - ORGLEARN projec...|$|R
