40|$|The {{received}} view {{in medical}} contexts is <b>that</b> <b>informed</b> consent is both necessary and sufficient for patient autonomy. This paper argues <b>that</b> <b>informed</b> consent {{is not sufficient}} for patient autonomy, at least when autonomy is understood as a “relational ” concept. Relational conceptions of autonomy, which have become promi-nent in the contemporary literature, draw on themes in the thought of Charles Taylor. I first identify four themes in Taylor’s work that together constitute a picture of human agency corresponding {{to the notion of}} agency implicit in relational accounts of autonomy. Drawing on these themes, I sketch two arguments against the posi-tion <b>that</b> <b>informed</b> consent secures autonomy. The first is <b>that</b> <b>informed</b> consent is an “opportunity ” concept whereas autonomy is an “exercise ” concept; the second is <b>that</b> <b>informed</b> consent requires merely weak evaluation and not strong evaluation. On Taylor’s analysis of agency, strong evaluation is required for agency and for autonomy...|$|R

25|$|Gadamer {{writes that}} human {{tradition}} and reason {{can serve as}} a standard of measure for testing uncovered truths and avoiding relativism. Heidegger states that we can avoid relativism by testing interpreted truths against Dasein's facticity, or something that is already given in existence <b>that</b> <b>informs</b> our theorizing. Additionally, hermeneutic psychotherapists and theorists say that interpreted truths must be congruent with ontological hermeneutics theory.|$|E
25|$|In Tunisian Arabic, as {{in other}} Semitic languages, the {{creation}} of new words is based on a root and pattern system, also known as the Semitic root. That means that new words can be created through the association of a root that is composed most of the time of three letters that have a meaning with a rhythm or pattern <b>that</b> <b>informs</b> about the position of the object in the fact. For example, K-T-B is a root meaning to write and مفعول mafʿūl is a pattern meaning that the object submitted the fact. Thus, the combination of the root and the given pattern render maKTūB, which means something that was written.|$|E

25|$|Although its {{strongly}} conservative {{views on}} theology and ethics {{might seem to}} make the LCMS politically compatible with Protestant evangelicals and fundamentalists in the U.S., the LCMS largely eschews political activity, partly out of concerns to keep the denomination untainted with potential heresies and also because of its strict understanding of the Lutheran distinction between the Two Kingdoms (see above), which repudiates the primarily Calvinist presuppositions about the totalizing rule of God <b>that</b> <b>informs</b> much, if not most, of U.S. evangelical understanding of politics and Christianity.

25|$|Although place {{cells are}} part of a non-sensory {{cortical}} system, their firing behavior is strongly correlated to sensory input. Place cells fire when an animal is located in parts of the environment known as place fields. These circuits may have important implications for memory, as they provide the spatial context for memories and past experiences. Like many other parts of the brain, place cell circuits are dynamic. They are constantly adjusting and remapping to suit the current location and experience of the brain. Place cells do not work alone to create visuospatial representation; they are a part of a complex circuit <b>that</b> <b>informs</b> place awareness and place memory.|$|E

25|$|As {{human beings}} (Dasein) {{navigate}} their world around them, {{they look for}} tools and ways to accomplish {{what they need to}} do: food and water for survival, instruments to complete tasks, shelter for protection etc. Heidegger theorized that Dasein’s “quest” to exist, so to speak, can only be completed via his relationship with others and his world around him. This is what Slife termed radical relationality: human beings are fundamentally and inescapably relational beings. That human beings exist in-the-world as radically relational beings ultimately means that Dasein must seek out his existence through opportunities that present themselves in his world and through his relationships with others. In other words, what ontological hermeneutics is saying about what nature is that human beings cannot be thought of as merely “self-certain actants” capable of distancing themselves above and against their world effortly to determine rational courses of action, nor as little more than computers that have been programmed to react to stimuli. Instead, all understanding of how to exist comes from being-in-the-world and understanding one’s relation to, or place in, that world. Put another way, human beings conduct themselves within the context of their life-world (the world in which their lives take place) which provides Dasein with possibilities of how to act. It is this understanding of himself in that life-world <b>that</b> <b>informs</b> his choice.|$|E
