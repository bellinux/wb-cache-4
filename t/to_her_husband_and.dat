5|$|A {{secretary}} at the FBI office, Dorothy Bahnsen (Jane Perry), helps Dales find a file that mentions Gissing, {{one of the}} two other men mentioned by Bill who had committed suicide. She explains that she files all the unsolved cases under X because there is more room under X than U. Gissing's body is still in the morgue and Dales convinces the technician to cut open the body where they find a strange creature has been sewn into Gissing's chest. Dales goes to Skur's wife and tells her what was done <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> that he wants to expose the experiments.

5|$|The {{funeral service}} for Pat Nixon {{took place in}} the grounds of the Richard Nixon Library in Yorba Linda on June 26, 1993. Speakers at the ceremony, {{including}} California Governor Pete Wilson, Kansas senator Bob Dole, and the Reverend Dr. Billy Graham, eulogized the former First Lady. In addition <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> immediate family, former presidents Ronald Reagan and Gerald Ford and their wives, Nancy and Betty, were also in attendance. Lady Bird Johnson was unable to attend because she was in the hospital recovering from a stroke, and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis did not attend either. President Nixon sobbed openly, profusely, and at times uncontrollably during the ceremony. It was a rare display of emotion from the former president, and Helen McCain Smith said that she had never seen him more distraught.|$|E

25|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} it was not {{sufficient}} for the husband simply to say to his wife (in the presence of two witnesses) not to converse with a man. And if she nonetheless conversed with him, she was still permitted <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> (if a daughter of a Kohen) still permitted to eat from sacrifices. If, however, she entered a private place with the man and stayed with him long enough to have committed misconduct, she was forbidden <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> forbidden to eat from sacrifices, and if her husband died, she was required to perform the ceremony of halizah and could not contract a levirate marriage.|$|E

25|$|The dutiful wife, the pativrata, {{is devoted}} and subservient <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband,</b> <b>and</b> also {{protective}} of him.

25|$|As he {{was held}} on remand at Winson Green Prison in the months {{following}} his arrest, Fred became increasingly depressed as to his predicament. This state of depression would further increase following Rose's public rejection of him at Gloucester Magistrates Court on 30 June, her refusal to reply to letters he sent her, and reports leaked to the press in which she (Rose) had assumed the role of a grieving mother who had lost a daughter and stepdaughter <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> in which she declared both her innocence of murder, and her hatred of him.|$|E

25|$|She {{was educated}} at Miss Murphy's {{private school in}} Melbourne, and in 1873 married Captain Charles Rowan, who had fought in the New Zealand wars. Her husband was {{interested}} in botany and he encouraged her to paint wild flowers. She had had no training but working conscientiously and carefully in water-colour; her work is noted for being botanically informative as well as artistic. Rowan returned to Melbourne in 1877, and for many years travelled in Australia painting the flora of the country, at times {{in the company of}} her painting companion, Margaret Forrest. She published in 1898 A Flower-Hunter in Queensland and New Zealand, largely based on letters <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> friends.|$|E
25|$|Women's {{property}} {{rights in the}} Quran are from parents and near relatives. A woman, according to Islamic tradition, {{does not have to}} give her pre-marriage possessions <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> receive a mahr (dower) which she then owns. Furthermore, any earnings that a woman receives through employment or business, after marriage, is hers to keep and need not contribute towards family expenses. This is because, once the marriage is consummated, in exchange for tamkin (sexual submission), a woman is entitled to nafaqaâ€“ namely, the financial responsibility for reasonable housing, food and other household expenses for the family, including the spouse, falls entirely on the husband. In traditional Islamic law, a woman is also not responsible for the upkeep of the home and may demand payment for any work she does in the domestic sphere.|$|E

25|$|In 1914, {{at one of}} the {{literary}} salons hosted by Adelaida Gertsyk, Parnok met the young poet Marina Tsvetaeva, with whom she became involved in an affair that left important imprints on the poetry of both women. Around the same time, Parnok read, and later rewrote some of the works of the Greek poet Sappho. By October, Tsvetaeva had committed to the affair, disregarding her obligations <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> daughter by writing her first love poem to Parnok. Prior to her affair with Tsvetaeva, Parnok's poetry had not shown the originality of expression that her later works would evidence. Each of the two women drove the other to excel, revealing that Parnok had the upper-hand in love while Tsvetaeva was the more refined poet. On a personal level, Tsvetaeva was both attracted and repelled Parnok's passion, increasing her feelings of insecurity. On a professional level, both were surprised at the depth of their own jealousy, channeling their envy into a creative duel of words.|$|E
25|$|Grand Duchess Anastasia {{brought up}} her {{children}} with simplicity and more freedom than she received from her parents, and would {{keep a close}} relationship with them. She spoke French <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> English with her children. She was a keen tennis player, with her own tennis court at the Villa Wenden. She loved Italian music, particularly the operas of Puccini, and the theater. Her extant letters reveal a warm, caring person, who always seems to have been happy about life. She frequented many other European royals who stayed at the Riviera; her parents and brothers were also frequent visitors. Her mother {{died of a heart attack}} in 1891, and Anastasia remained very close to her widower father and her brothers, particularly the two eldest Nicholas and Michael. Anastasia spent lavishly from the Grand Duke's income and her own dowry, for which she was widely criticized, but she loved to shock people who condemned her. She liked society and became a frequent visitor to the gambling tables of Monte Carlo, losing a large sum of money at the casino; but in spite of her extravagances, she never lost her husband's affection.|$|E
25|$|In {{the present}} {{universe}} of Camelot, King Arthur showed David the broken Excalibur after reading books {{on how to}} make it whole, and when he asked David to help him find the other half, David realized where the portion of the dagger came from. As for the dagger itself Emma is being drawn to it with each passing day, but is repelled by a protection spell put in place by Regina. The manifestation of Rumplestiltskin continues to consume Emma's mind to the point of Emma nearly hurting Hook. The effects are starting a toll on Emma, prompting an intervention from Hook, Henry, Mary Margaret, David, and Regina, but before they {{can come up with a}} solution, Mary Margaret asks David for a moment alone to talk <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband,</b> <b>and</b> as expected, was to tell him about King Arthur. However, when she told him about Lancelot being alive and the message he gave her, David ended up defending Arthur, believing that he is being very trustworthy. Mary Margaret on the other hand, believes David has become friends with Arthur because he misses the life he enjoyed back in the Enchanted Forest and that fulfilling it as a Knight in the Round Table will make him important again.|$|E
50|$|Lucy of Bolingbroke (died circa 1138) was an Anglo-Norman heiress {{in central}} England and, later in life, countess of Chester.

His widow saved her life by recanting views similar <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband's</b> <b>and</b> lived out <b>her</b> life in an abbey.|$|R

25|$|I {{have been}} a Catholic and an infidel; I {{have been a}} Roman priest and a hypocrite; I have been a profligate under a cowl. I am that Father Achilli, who as early as 1826, was {{deprived}} of my faculty to lecture, for an offence which my superiors {{did their best to}} conceal; and who in 1827 had already earned the reputation of a scandalous friar. I am that Achilli, who in the diocese of Viterbo in February, 1831, robbed of her honour a young women of eighteen; who in September 1833, was found guilty of a second such crime, {{in the case of a}} person of twenty-eight; and who perpetrated a third in July, 1834, in the case of another aged twenty-four. I am he, who afterwards was found guilty of sins, similar or worse, in other towns of the neighbourhood. I am that son of St. Dominic who is known to have repeated the offence at Capua, in 1834 or 1835; and at Naples again, in 1840, in the case of a child of fiteen. I am he who chose the sacristy of the church for one of these crimes, and Good Friday for another. Look on me, ye mothers of England, a confessor against Popery, for ye 'ne'er may look upon my like again.' I am that veritable priest, who, after all this, began to speak against, not only the Catholic faith, but the moral law, and perverted others by my teaching. I am the Cavaliere Achilli, who then went to Corfu, made the wife of a tailor faithless <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband,</b> <b>and</b> lived publicly and travelled about with the wife of a chorus-singer. I am that Professor of the Protestant College at Malta, who with two others was dismissed from my post for offences which the authorities cannot get themselves to describe. And now attend to me, such as I am, and you shall see what you shall see about the barbarity and profligacy of the Inquisitors of Rome.|$|E
