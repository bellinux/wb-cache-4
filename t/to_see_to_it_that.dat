5|$|The {{history of}} Highway3 dates back over 200 {{years to the}} {{pioneering}} settlement era of Upper Canada following the American Revolution and the resulting influx of United Empire Loyalists. Thomas Talbot, an influential scion who joined the British army {{at the age of}} 11, would challenge the government, the terrain, and the forces of nature <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> his road be built. Due to his family legacy, Talbot worked through the ranks quickly and found himself a personal aide to John Graves Simcoe, the first Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada. He returned to England after Simcoe fell ill, but vowed to return to the hinterland he had come to love.|$|E

25|$|It {{is clear}} {{now that the}} present {{situation}} cannot be allowed to continue. It is evident also that the Stormont government {{is no longer in}} control of the situation. Indeed, the present situation is the inevitable outcome of the policies pursued for decades by successive Stormont governments. It is clear also that the Irish Government can no longer stand by and see innocent people injured and perhaps worse. It is obvious that the RUC is no longer accepted as an impartial police force. Neither would the employment of British troops be acceptable nor would they be likely to restore peaceful conditions, certainly not in the long term. The Irish Government have, therefore, requested the British Government to apply immediately to the United Nations for the urgent dispatch of a Peace-Keeping Force to the Six Counties of Northern Ireland and have instructed the Permanent Representative to the United Nations to inform the Secretary General of this request. We have also asked the British Government <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> police attacks on the people of Derry should cease immediately.|$|E
500|$|George and May {{had five}} {{sons and a}} daughter. Randolph Churchill claimed that George was a strict father, {{to the extent that}} his {{children}} were terrified of him, and that George had remarked to Edward Stanley, 17th Earl of Derby: [...] "My father was frightened of his mother, I was frightened of my father, and I am damned well going <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> my children are frightened of me." [...] In reality, there is no direct source for the quotation and it is likely that George's parenting style was little different from that adopted by most people at the time.|$|E
500|$|In Canada, public {{sentiment}} widely supported the players. Opinion polls {{taken in the}} aftermath of the brawl saw 87–92% of respondents supporting their actions. Don Cherry's passionate defence of the Canadian team led to a sharp increase in his popularity. Toronto Maple Leafs owner Harold Ballard had special gold medals made up for the Canadian team. Ballard stated that [...] "I believe the Canadian boys deserve the gold medal and I'm going <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> they get them.

Judge Yagnik {{described}} her as the [...] "kingpin of the violence", and as the 37 months of trials ended, the court {{said in a statement that}} Kodnani had received help from the state government, and efforts had been made to avoid her name appearing on the list of accused. The statement said, [...] "Kodnani was tremendously favoured by the then investigating agencies (before the Supreme Court-appointed Special Investigation Team took over). All care, at the cost of the duty of the investigating officer and even the interest of the victims, was taken <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> Kodnani's involvement does not come on the books.

500|$|A {{few weeks}} after the release of this [...] "Long Telegram", former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill {{delivered}} his famous [...] "Iron Curtain" [...] speech in Fulton, Missouri. The speech called for an Anglo-American alliance against the Soviets, whom he accused of establishing an [...] "iron curtain" [...] from [...] "Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic". [...] Only a week later, on 13 March Stalin responded vigorously to the speech, saying that Churchill could be compared to Hitler insofar as he advocated the racial superiority of English-speaking nations so that they could satisfy their hunger for world domination, and that such a declaration was [...] "a call for war on the U.S.S.R.The Soviet leader also dismissed the accusation that the USSR was exerting increasing control over the countries lying in its sphere.

2500|$|In 1680 the Jews of Stockholm {{petitioned the}} king {{that they be}} {{permitted}} to reside there without abandoning their creed, but the application was denied because the local consistory had refused to endorse it.

[...] Bingham said about this version: [...] "It confers upon Congress power <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> the protection given {{by the laws of}} the States shall be equal in respect to life and liberty and property to all persons."

2500|$|Raeder's last speech {{occurred}} as Commander-in-Chief occurred on 30 January 1943 before the Reichstag, where {{he asserted that}} he had brought the Navy [...] "smoothly and completely" [...] into {{the service of the}} Führer in 1933. Raeder argued that: [...] "This was possible only because, despite all outside efforts to influence it, the training of the Navy [...] derived from an inner attitude that was itself truly National Socialist. For this reason, we did not have to change, but could become followers of the Führer with open hearts. I find it particularly satisfying that the Führer has always attributed this to me, and I would like to ask all of you <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> the Navy remains a strong and reliable support of the Führer in this regard". Though Hitler had cordial relations with Raeder, the two had never been close, and there was nothing like the mutual admiration that Hitler and Dönitz shared.|$|E
