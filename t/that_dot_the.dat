The cliffs are a stronghold of the chough, and a nesting place for razorbills and guillemots. On the lower rocks, in reach of the waves, are plentiful lichens, seaweeds, sponges, limpets and barnacles.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the urban}} portion of Elliot Lake, the highway is locally {{maintained}} under a Connecting Link agreement. It passes the Nuclear Mining Museum and the Mount Dufour ski resort {{before leaving the}} community and crossing {{the eastern end of}} the geographic Elliot Lake. From this point to the northern terminus of the highway, the route provides access to several mines <b>that</b> <b>dot</b> <b>the</b> surrounding areas. Immediately south of Quirke Mine Road, Highway108 becomes Secondary Highway639; the centre lane ends and the pavement quality is visibly reduced.|$|E

25|$|Agriculture, the {{traditional}} {{industry in the}} region, continues to {{play a significant role}} in Steinbach's economy as well. The agricultural industry in the area is notable for many of the large commercial pig, and poultry farming operations. Aside from intensive pig and chicken barns there are numerous small, family, dairy farms <b>that</b> <b>dot</b> <b>the</b> area. Crops grown on the fertile farmland surrounding Steinbach primarily include canola, corn, alfalfa, as well as barley, soybeans, oats, and wheat.|$|E
25|$|While {{the main}} line of US20 takes a direct path between Hamburg, Buffalo, and East Bloomfield via Avon, US20A veers to the south to serve several villages and hamlets, {{including}} the villages of Geneseo and Warsaw. The town of Attica, famous for the Attica Prison riots of 1971, lies between US20 and US20A. As the route heads east, US20A connects to several north–south freeways, such as NY400 outside of East Aurora and Interstate390 (I-390) between Geneseo and Lakeville. Outside of the communities <b>that</b> <b>dot</b> <b>the</b> highway, US20A is a two-lane, rural highway.|$|E

25|$|By 3400 BCE, the Sahara was as dry {{as it is}} today, due {{to reduced}} {{precipitation}} and higher temperatures resulting from {{a shift in the}} Earth's orbit. As a result of this aridification, it became a largely impenetrable barrier to humans, with the remaining settlements mainly being concentrated around the numerous oases <b>that</b> <b>dot</b> <b>the</b> landscape. Little trade or commerce is known to have passed through the interior in subsequent periods, the only major exception being the Nile Valley. The Nile, however, was impassable at several cataracts, making trade and contact by boat difficult.|$|E
25|$|Chicago, {{along the}} shores of Lake Michigan, is the nation's third largest city. In 2000, 23.3% of Illinois's {{population}} {{lived in the city}} of Chicago, 43.3% in Cook County, and 65.6% in the counties of the Chicago metropolitan area: Will, DuPage, Kane, Lake, and McHenry counties, as well as Cook County. The remaining population lives in the smaller cities and rural areas <b>that</b> <b>dot</b> <b>the</b> state's plains. As of 2000, the state's center of population was at , located in Grundy County, northeast of the village of Mazon.|$|E
25|$|The {{whole area}} is very mountainous, with steep cliffs, many glaciers, and countless waterfalls. It is {{renowned for its}} scenic beauty and the charm of the small Swiss villages <b>that</b> <b>dot</b> <b>the</b> area. As a result of this, tourism {{is one of the}} main sources of income in the Bernese Oberland. The region also has an {{extensive}} train network as well as many cable cars and funiculars, with the highest train station in Europe at the Jungfraujoch and the longest gondola cableway in the world from Grindelwald to the Männlichen.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} part of the 20th century, Atlantic City went through a radical {{building}} boom.

25|$|The Merrimack, which flows southerly from Franklin, New Hampshire to Lowell, makes a northeasterly turn {{there before}} {{emptying}} into the Atlantic Ocean at Newburyport, Massachusetts, approximately 40 miles downriver from Lowell. It {{is believed that}} in prior ages, the Merrimack continued south from Lowell to empty into the ocean somewhere near Boston. The glacial deposits that redirected {{the flow of the}} river left the drumlins <b>that</b> <b>dot</b> <b>the</b> city, most notably, Fort Hill in the Belvidere neighborhood. Other large hills in Lowell include Lynde Hill, also in Belvidere, and Christian Hill, in the easternmost part of Centralville at the Dracut town line.|$|E
25|$|Through {{a strong}} {{centralized}} administration and an aggressive military stance towards invaders, the Ajuran Sultanate successfully resisted an Oromo invasion {{from the west}} and a Portuguese incursion from the east during the Gaal Madow and the Ajuran-Portuguese wars. Trading routes dating from the ancient and early medieval periods of Somali maritime enterprise were also strengthened or re-established, and the state left behind an extensive architectural legacy. Many {{of the hundreds of}} ruined castles and fortresses <b>that</b> <b>dot</b> <b>the</b> landscape of Somalia today are attributed to Ajuran engineers, including a lot of the pillar tomb fields, necropolises and ruined cities built during that era. The royal family, the House of Gareen, also expanded its territories and established its hegemonic rule through a skillful combination of warfare, trade linkages and alliances.|$|E
25|$|The {{waterfront}} was {{the setting}} of much bustle and activity. It {{was used for the}} landing of marine resources harvested by local fishers, the processing of cod, salmon, seals and herring, the production of barrels, the packaging of fish products, the mending of nets and the production of saltfish. The flake or fish drying platform at Battle Harbour was the biggest such structure in all of Labrador. The Salt Store, the area's main warehouse for the salt used in the processing of several species, could hold up to 1,500 tons. The reconstructed waterfront buildings are reminiscent of an era now past but retain the history of years gone by and they also house an impressive collection of fisheries-related artifacts. The Battle Harbour Historic District was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1996. The ocean vistas and craggy rock outcrops are a dramatic backdrop for the small wooden church and houses <b>that</b> <b>dot</b> <b>the</b> landscape. Battle Harbour's hub is the wharf and the waterfront premises; rustic, wooden and shingle-clad buildings erected by English and Newfoundland-based merchants in the late 18th and 19th centuries.|$|E

After passing through forests for , the route enters the small community of Dacre, where it intersects former Highway513 (Scotch Bush Road) north to Hyndford. Leaving Dacre, the highway passes by several farms as it dips south to cross Constant Creek, {{a tributary of the}} Madawaska River, before turning east-northeast. It meanders around several large swamps and small lakes <b>that</b> <b>dot</b> <b>the</b> Madawaska Highlands, otherwise passing through thick forests for the next [...] until it enters a clearing and the hamlet of Shamrock.|$|E
500|$|According to the {{traditional}} beliefs of many Malagasy ethnic groups, one attains the status of [...] "ancestor" [...] after death. [...] It is often believed that ancestors continue to watch over and shape events on Earth and can intervene on behalf of (or interfere with) the living. [...] As a consequence, ancestors are to be revered: prayers and sacrifices to honor or appease them are common, {{as well as the}} observation of the local fady (taboos) the ancestors may have established in life. Gestures of respect, such as throwing the first capful of a new bottle of rum into the northeast corner of the room to share it with the ancestors, are practiced throughout the island. The most visible emblem of the respect due to ancestors is the construction of the elaborate family tombs <b>that</b> <b>dot</b> <b>the</b> countryside in much of Madagascar.|$|E
50|$|Just west of Columbus on {{a branch}} of the Oshawa Creek at the SE corner of Thornton Rd. and Columbus Rd. existed the largest mill in the entire area.

50|$|Politically, Aljezur {{was founded}} in the 10th century by Berbers who {{remained}} in the region for the following five centuries, until the Christian conquest.

50|$|However, {{the stakes}} for {{cultural}} domination played out through {{comparison of the}} two aesthetics. In the forty or-so pamphlets <b>that</b> <b>dotted</b> <b>the</b> period, the contrast recurred between a totally Italian musical language with Italian opera that favored singing, and the more consonantal, articulated French language and a French genre more preoccupied with words. Furthermore, for the French side, the laughter provoked by comic opera was considered noxious because one lost self-control and was irrational even though the Italian side called for passion and emotion.|$|R
