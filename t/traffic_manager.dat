5|$|Although the {{introduction}} of the Bagnall locomotives and the traffic generated by the works at Waddesdon Manor had boosted the route's fortunes, it remained in serious financial difficulty. The only connection with the national railway network was by way of the turntable at Quainton Road. The 3rd Duke of Buckingham chaired the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway but its management regarded the Tramway as a nuisance. In the 1870s it charged disproportionately high fees for through traffic between the Tramway and the main line with the intention of forcing the Tramway out of business. Relations deteriorated between Jones and J.G. Rowe, Secretary and <b>Traffic</b> <b>Manager</b> of the A The A's trains at Quainton Road would miss connections with the Tramway, causing milk shipped to Quainton to become unsellable, to the extent that Jones began unloading milk at Waddesdon and shipping it to Aylesbury by road. Although Jones asked the Duke to intervene relations remained poor; in 1888 Rowe blocked the telegraph along the Tramway, and in one meeting Jones and Rowe threatened violence.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – Post {{incident}} {{traffic management}} on a freeway network depends {{mainly on the}} decisions of <b>traffic</b> <b>managers</b> that surface from their individual exposure to similar conditions. This manual approach to tackle a dynamic scenario induces uncertainty, inconsistency and inefficient use of rescue resources. This paper suggests a decision support scheme known as Freeway Incident Analysis System, (FIAS). The novel idea presented here {{is the use of}} real time data from the Toll Collection System (TCS) and Vehicle Detection System (VDS). This data is conjugated with the historical data on a microscopic simulation platform to predict traffic flows in a post-incident scenario. The system employs Cellular Automata for the microscopic simulation of vehicle movement, and we also suggest two additional rules in the modified version of the conventional model. This has enabled us to model the dynamic flow parameters in a post incident scenario more realistically. The evaluation of FIAS indicates that it yields significantly accurate post incident information about traffic flows for the use of <b>traffic</b> <b>managers...</b>|$|R
25|$|At {{around the}} time the rail {{connection}} to wharf no. 2 was removed, the Railways Department decided to also rationalise their trackwork on the waterfront and informed the Harbour Board of their plans to disconnect wharves 4 and 7. The Harbour Board inspected wharf no. 4 and determined that rail access to it could continue for several more years provided repairs were made. They were also advised by the <b>Traffic</b> <b>Manager</b> that rail access to wharf no. 4 was still required, and it was therefore decided not to make any changes to this connection. However, the Department decided in October to proceed with its plans for wharf no. 7 and arrangements were made with the Inspector of the Permanent Way for this work to be carried out.|$|E
25|$|In 1957, Gerry Fiennes, {{the line}} <b>traffic</b> <b>manager</b> {{on the former}} Great Northern route out of London King's Cross station, was seeking high power {{locomotives}} to run services on the East Coast Main Line, having found the 2000hp English Electric type 4 locomotives produced under the 1955 modernisation plan lacking sufficient power for his planned timings; as a consequence he proposed using 'Deltic' type locomotives on the line. Objections to the order included those arising from: a limited permitted top speed due to {{the mass of the}} locomotive; the potential for the order to delay a proposed (1957) electrification scheme of the line; as well the size which required modifications to the King's Cross platforms. An order was placed in 1959 for 22 Class 55s to replace 55 steam locomotives.|$|E

40|$|A far-term {{collaborative}} {{traffic flow}} management concept {{has been proposed}} for mitigating flow constraint situations that result in imbalance between demand and capacity in the National Airspace System. This paper presents a scenario-based task analysis of core attributes of the concept in the expected future traffic environment. These attributes include a dynamic allocation of some traffic flow management responsibility to airline operation centers, while the <b>traffic</b> flow <b>managers</b> maintain a supervisory role, monitoring performance and intervening increasingly as time-to-constraint decreases. This analysis proposes a three-tier time horizon with different collaboration schemes between <b>traffic</b> flow <b>managers</b> and airlines within each tier. In the outer tier, the airlines are responsible for modifying flight trajectories to mitigate the constraints identified by the <b>traffic</b> flow <b>managers,</b> before any flow plan is needed. In the middle tier, the <b>traffic</b> flow <b>managers</b> collaborate with the airlines to select and impose a flow plan, while the airlines continue to modify trajectories according to the flow plan. In the inner tier, the flow managers take over responsibility for modifying flight trajectories while incorporating airline preferences for flights, reroutes, and delay. The task analysis describes the activities in each tier to the level required for identifying the communication and information sharing between the airlines and the <b>traffic</b> flow <b>managers.</b> It also identifies benefit mechanisms and feasibility issues. Some key benefits mechanisms include reducing the <b>traffic</b> flow <b>manager</b> workload by shifting some responsibilities to airlines and increasing airline satisfaction by increasing their proactive participation and incorporating their preferences. Some key feasibility issues identified include the ability to delegate responsibility for flight trajectory changes to airlines and to coordinate among them. Addressing these issues avoids creating constraints elsewhere and ensures equity. Implications of the task analysis on future research related to feasibility and benefit assessments of the concept are discussed...|$|R

500|$|About this time, {{the amount}} of trade handled by the Port of Lancaster was declining, largely owing to silting up of the River Lune. [...] In May 1842 Sharpe had been elected a Port Commissioner, and later {{proposed}} what became the Morecambe Bay Harbour Project. [...] This planned {{to build a new}} port at Poulton-le-Sands (soon to become part of Morecambe), and link it to Lancaster by means of a ship canal. [...] After prolonged discussion this proved to be too expensive, and it was agreed to link Lancaster and Morecambe by railway rather than by canal. [...] An Act for the creation of the Morecambe Harbour and Railway Company (MH) received Royal assent in July 1846, the revised plan being to link this line to the [...] "L"NWR at Green Ayre, {{in the northern part of}} Lancaster next to the River Lune. [...] A clause in the Act allowed the MH to be sold to the [...] "L"NWR, which took place in October. The parts played by Sharpe in all of this financial manoeuvring were conflicting and complex: he was simultaneously a Port Commissioner, a Town Councillor, a member of the board of the Morecambe Bay Harbour Company, and Secretary to the [...] "L"NWR. In 1847, near the Morecambe terminus of the railway, Sharpe laid the first stone of the North Western Hotel (later the Midland), which he (or more probably Paley) had designed. In April that year Sharpe had resigned as Secretary to the [...] "L"NWR to enable him to tender for building the line from Morecambe to Wennington, a village north-east of Lancaster near to the Yorkshire border. His tender of £100,000 (equivalent to £ as of [...] ) for the line (excluding the bridge over the River Lune at Green Ayre) was accepted. [...] He also gained the contract for building the harbour. In June 1848 the section of line from Lancaster to Morecambe was opened, and by October 1849 the ten-mile section from Lancaster to Wennington was completed. In September Sharpe had also resigned as a director of the [...] "L"NWR to become its <b>traffic</b> <b>manager,</b> and was then contracted to manufacture and supply rolling stock for the railway, something for which he had neither expertise nor previous experience. [...] By February 1851 the line was experiencing difficulties, its traffic being less than expected and its costs rising; and in December Sharpe was given notice that his contract with the company would be curtailed the following month.|$|E
