Further north are the Calm Lands, a series of plains <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> site of numerous battles in Spira's history; the Cavern of the Stolen Fayth, an equally historical area; and Mt.

2500|$|An {{alternative}} theory {{based on}} [...] review of contemporary toxicological literature {{indicates that it}} is oleander that causes symptoms {{similar to those of}} the Pythia. Pythia used oleander as a complement during the oracular procedure, chewing its leaves and inhaling their smoke. The toxic substances of oleander resulted in symptoms similar to those of epilepsy, the “sacred disease,” which amounted to the possession of the Pythia by the spirit of Apollo, an event that made the Pythia his spokesperson, and subsequently, his prophetess. The oleander fumes (the [...] "spirit of Apollo") could have originated in a brazier located in an underground chamber (the antron) and have escaped through an opening (the [...] "chasm") in the temple’s floor. This hypothesis perfectly fits the findings of the archaeological excavations that revealed an underground space under the temple. This explanation sheds light on the alleged spirit and chasm of Delphi, <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> subject of intense debate and interdisciplinary research for the last hundred years.|$|E
2500|$|The {{characteristic}} long tail of most rodents is {{a feature}} that has been extensively studied in various rat species models, which subsequently suggest three primary functions of this structure: thermoregulation, minor proprioception, and a nocifensive-mediated degloving response. Rodent tails, particularly in rat models, has been implicated with a thermoregulation function that follows from its anatomical construction. This particular tail morphology is evident across the Muridae family (in contrast to the bushier tails of the Squirrel/Sciuridae family). The tail is hairless and thin-skinned, but highly vascularized, thus allowing for efficient counter-current heat exchange with the environment. The high muscular and connective tissue densities of the tail, along with ample muscle attachment sites along its plentiful caudal vertebrae facilitate specific proprioceptive senses to help orient the rodent in a three dimensional environment. Lastly, murids have evolved a unique defense mechanism termed [...] "degloving" [...] which allows for escape from predation through {{the loss of the}} outermost integument layer on the tail. However, this mechanism is associated with multiple pathologies <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> subject of investigation.|$|E
