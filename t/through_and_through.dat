25|$|One {{consequence}} of these positions that Unger points {{to is the}} revision of the concept and function of mathematics. If {{there is only one}} world drenched in time <b>through</b> <b>and</b> <b>through,</b> then mathematics cannot be a timeless expression of multiple universes that captures reality. Rather, Unger argues that mathematics is a means of analyzing the world removed of time and phenomenal distinction. By emptying the world of time and space it is able to better focus on one aspect of reality: the recurrence of certain ways in which pieces of the world relate to other pieces. Its subject matter are the structured wholes and bundles of relations, which we see outside mathematics only as embodied in the time-bound particulars of the manifest world. In this way, mathematics extends our problem solving powers as an extension of human insight, {{but it is not a}} part of the world.|$|E

25|$|News of the Sarajevo {{assassination}} reached Xavier and Sixte in Austria, {{en route}} to Asia. Enraged by murder of their step-cousin, both brothers intended to enlist to the Austrian army and seek revenge. Things changed when France declared war on Vienna. Though some of the Bourbon-Parma siblings – Zita, René, Felix and the half-brother Élie – sided with Austro-Hungary and males joined the imperial troops, Xavier and Sixte felt Frenchmen <b>through</b> <b>and</b> <b>through.</b> They openly intended to enlist to the French army, the declaration which might have cost them detention. It took personal appeals of Zita before the kaiser took steps which prevented their incarceration and allowed them to leave Austria for a neutral country. When back in France Xavier and Sixte indeed volunteered, {{only to find that}} the French law banned members of foreign dynasties from serving. Determined to join, they contacted their cousin Elisabeth, the queen consort of Belgium, who looked to it that both were allowed to serve in the Belgian military. Due to car accident suffered by Sixte, the brothers joined ranks of the Belgian army no earlier than in late November 1914. Xavier was initially accepted as private in medical services and was seconded to the 7th artillery regiment. Exact details of his service are not clear; {{what was left of the}} pre-war Belgian army served on a relatively calm sector of the frontline, in the Belgian and French Flanders next to the English Channel. At unspecified time Xavier was released from the line and got seconded to an officer training course, organized by the Belgian general staff, which he completed successfully. In mid-1916 he was sub-lieutenant, later to grow to captain.|$|E

500|$|The Quest Begins {{began as}} a request from HarperCollins who wanted Victoria Holmes, editor and creator of the Warriors series which {{followed}} the adventures of feral cats, to write another series about animals. The company suggested dogs to Holmes, but the idea was rejected since dogs behave very similarly to the cats in the Warriors series. Both horses and dolphins were suggested, but rejected due to their tendency to run away rather than fight and the slowness of battles underwater. Out of ideas, HarperCollins consulted with Holmes on {{what she wanted to}} write about. After a bit of thinking Holmes replied, [...] "BEARS! They live much more solitary lifestyles than cats, they are wild <b>through</b> <b>and</b> <b>through</b> with no history of domestication whatsoever (performing bears don’t count), and they are much bigger animals, with a whole lot more potential for fighting".|$|E
500|$|The {{objections}} to Cantor's work were occasionally fierce: Henri Poincaré {{referred to his}} ideas as a [...] "grave disease" [...] infecting the discipline of mathematics, and Leopold Kronecker's public opposition and personal attacks included describing Cantor as a [...] "scientific charlatan", a [...] "renegade" [...] and a [...] "corrupter of youth." [...] Kronecker objected to Cantor's proofs that the algebraic numbers are countable, and that the transcendental numbers are uncountable, results now included in a standard mathematics curriculum. Writing decades after Cantor's death, Wittgenstein lamented that mathematics is [...] "ridden <b>through</b> <b>and</b> <b>through</b> with the pernicious idioms of set theory", which he dismissed as [...] "utter nonsense" [...] that is [...] "laughable" [...] and [...] "wrong". Cantor's recurring bouts of depression from 1884 {{to the end of}} his life have been blamed on the hostile attitude of many of his contemporaries, though some have explained these episodes as probable manifestations of a bipolar disorder.|$|E
500|$|During {{the second}} half of the series, Toriyama has said that he had become more {{interested}} in coming up with the story than actually drawing it, and that the battles became more intense with him simplifying the lines. In 2013, he stated that because Dragon Ball is an action manga the most important aspect is the sense of speed, so he did not draw very elaborate, going so far as to suggest one could say that he was not interested in the art. He also once said that his goal for the series was to tell an [...] "unconventional and contradictory" [...] story. In 2013, commenting on Dragon Balls global success, Toriyama said, [...] "Frankly, I don't quite understand why it happened.

500|$|When Dragon Ball began, it was {{loosely based}} on the classic Chinese novel Journey to the West, with Goku being Sun Wukong and Bulma as Xuanzang. Toriyama {{continued}} to use his characteristic comedic style in the beginning, but {{over the course of}} time this slowly changed, with him turning the series into a [...] "nearly-pure fighting manga" [...] later on. He did not plan out in advance what would happen in the series, instead choosing to draw as he went. This, coupled with him simply forgetting things he had already drawn, caused him to find himself in situations that he had to write himself out of. In a rare 2013 interview, commenting on Dragon Balls global success, Toriyama admitted, [...] "Frankly, I don't quite understand why it happened. While the manga was being serialized, the only thing I wanted as I kept drawing was to make Japanese boys happy."

500|$|In 2011, manga {{critic and}} editor of Viz's editions of the series Jason Thompson said that: [...] "Dragon Ball {{is by far the}} most {{influential}} shonen manga of the last 30 years, and today, almost every Shōnen Jump artist lists it as one of their favorites and lifts from it in various ways." [...] Explaining its basic formula of [...] "lots of martial arts, lots of training sequences, [...] a few jokes" [...] became the model for other shōnen series, such as Naruto. Thompson cited the artwork as influential, pointing out that popular shōnen manga of the late 1980s and early 1990s had [...] "manly" [...] heroes, such as City Hunter and Fist of the North Star, whereas Dragon Ball had the cartoonish and small Goku, thus starting a trend that he says still continues. Commenting on Dragon Balls global success nearly two decades after it ended, Toriyama said, [...] "Frankly, I don't quite understand why it happened.

500|$|He next {{played the}} protagonist in the English {{language}} art film, Being Cyrus (2006), co-starring alongside Naseeruddin Shah and Dimple Kapadia. Directed by debutant Homi Adajania, the psychological drama revolves around a dysfunctional Parsi family with who Khan's character moves into. The film received predominantly positive reviews, and Khan was particularly praised. Later in the year, he portrayed {{the character of}} Iago in Omkara, the Indian adaptation of William Shakespeare's Othello. Directed by Vishal Bhardwaj, the film is a tragedy of sexual jealousy set {{against the backdrop of}} the political system in Uttar Pradesh. The film premiered at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival and was also selected for screening at the Cairo International Film Festival. Omkara was received positively by critics, and Khan went on to receive major acclaim earning the awards for Best Performance in a Negative Role at the Filmfare, Screen, Zee Cine and IIFA ceremonies; his performance was later included in the 2010 issue of the [...] "Top 80 Iconic Performances" [...] by Filmfare. Variety described it as a [...] "powerhouse performance" [...] and wrote that [...] "t is Khan's movie <b>through</b> <b>and</b> <b>through,</b> in a performance of rugged, contained malevolence which trades on his previous screen persona as a likable best friend as well as his stint as the manipulative outsider in Being Cyrus.

500|$|Both {{teams had}} injury {{concerns}} {{ahead of the}} final. Liverpool {{were expected to be}} without midfielders Charlie Adam and Lucas Leiva, who were both out with knee injuries, while Chelsea were missing defenders David Luiz and Gary Cahill to hamstring injuries. Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard was determined to claim a domestic double with victory in the final: [...] "The FA Cup is special, but we got a taste of success from winning the Carling Cup. That will help the younger players in the squad. Winning breeds confidence and you want more." [...] Gerrard believed success in the final would compensate for a poor season in the Premier League: [...] "We are all aware we have underachieved in the league and the squad of players is certainly better than where we are. We will assess the season and if we win two trophies I think it would alleviate the pressure slightly." [...] Chelsea captain John Terry was hopeful Chelsea would win the final, to help caretaker manager Roberto Di Matteo's hopes of getting the job full-time: [...] "To win it [...] will put himself in a very good position. He's not thinking of that at the moment, he's not letting the players get distracted by anything. He's very passionate, he's Chelsea <b>through</b> <b>and</b> <b>through,</b> and that's certainly rubbed off on the players.

However, the marriage ended, {{paving the way for}} a reunion between Billy and his high school sweetheart, Mac Browning (Clementine Ford).

[...] Chloe's next relationship is with Chance Chancellor (John Driscoll), Jill's grandson who is a virgin.

500|$|Similarly to the Warriors series, Seekers {{began as}} a request from HarperCollins to Victoria Holmes to develop another series {{about a group of}} animals, but not cats. Dogs were considered, but {{rejected}} because they were too close to cats in their hierarchical social organization, pack and hunting lifestyles, and territoriality. This was expressed by Victoria Holmes later in an online chat, where she stated that she [...] "was reluctant to create stories that... would be quite similar to Warriors. Dogs live in packs, they hunt for their food, they have a strict hierarchy within their communities, they guard their territories". Horses, otters and dolphins were considered, but were dismissed: Holmes felt that horses tended to run away rather than stay and fight, and that dolphin battles would be slow without [...] "the all-action excitement that Erin loves so much". In the end, the company left the decision to Holmes and she opted for bears; in the later author chat she notes that bears [...] "live much more solitary lifestyles than cats, they are wild <b>through</b> <b>and</b> <b>through</b> with no history of domestication whatsoever (performing bears don't count), and they are much bigger animals, with a whole lot more potential for fighting". The series took inspiration from Inuit beliefs and Native American languages. Holmes found that Native Americans and bears are very closely linked to the natural environment. The names of the bears are taken from several different Native American languages. Lusa, for example, means [...] "black" [...] in Choctaw.|$|E
