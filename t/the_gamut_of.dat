Of particular significance {{was the work of}} National Cancer Institute researcher and environmental cancer section founding director Wilhelm Hueper, who classified many pesticides as carcinogens. Carson and her research assistant Jeanne Davis, with the help of NIH librarian Dorothy Algire, found evidence to support the pesticide-cancer connection; to Carson the evidence for the toxicity of a wide array of synthetic pesticides was clear-cut, though such conclusions were very controversial beyond the small community of scientists studying pesticide carcinogenesis.|$|E

25|$|The diagram {{represents}} {{all of the}} chromaticities {{visible to}} the average person. These are shown in color and this region is called <b>the</b> <b>gamut</b> <b>of</b> human vision. <b>The</b> <b>gamut</b> <b>of</b> all visible chromaticities on the CIE plot is the tongue-shaped or horseshoe-shaped figure shown in color. The curved edge of the gamut is called the spectral locus and corresponds to monochromatic light (each point representing a pure hue of a single wavelength), with wavelengths listed in nanometers. The straight edge on {{the lower part of}} the gamut is called the line of purples. These colors, although they are on the border of the gamut, have no counterpart in monochromatic light. Less saturated colors appear in the interior of the figure with white at the center.|$|E
25|$|Linguistics {{has many}} sub-fields {{concerned}} with particular aspects of linguistic structure. The theory that elucidates on these, as propounded by Noam Chomsky, {{is known as}} generative theory or universal grammar. These sub-fields range from those focused primarily on form to those focused primarily on meaning. They also run <b>the</b> <b>gamut</b> <b>of</b> level of analysis of language, from individual sounds, to words, to phrases, up to cultural discourse.|$|E
25|$|If one chooses any {{two points}} of {{color on the}} {{chromaticity}} diagram, then all the colors that lie {{in a straight line}} between the two points can be formed by mixing these two colors. It follows that <b>the</b> <b>gamut</b> <b>of</b> colors must be convex in shape. All colors that can be formed by mixing three sources are found inside the triangle formed by the source points on the chromaticity diagram (and so on for multiple sources).|$|E

Though undetermined at the time, the Admiral had great hopes for his son's career under the favour of the King. Back at Oxford, Penn considered a medical career and took some dissecting classes. Rational thought began to spread into science, politics and economics, which he took a liking to. When theologian John Owen was fired from his deanery, Penn and other open-minded students rallied to his side and attended seminars at the dean's house, where intellectual discussions covered <b>the</b> <b>gamut</b> <b>of</b> new thought. Penn learned the valuable skills of forming ideas into theory, discussing theory through reasoned debate, and testing the theories in the real world.|$|E

A number of advances in clinical practice occurred during the conflict, with the development of acrylic resin for the manufacture of dentures, the involvement of dental surgeons in facio-maxillary surgery as part of the treatment of soldiers suffering from facial trauma—including plastic surgery and the fitting of moulds for epithelial inlays and skin and bone grafts—as well as developments in the manufacture of artificial eyes.|$|E
