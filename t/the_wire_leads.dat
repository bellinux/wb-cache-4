40|$|For {{calculations}} and measurements of transient characteristics of groundings, {{the current and}} potential <b>lead</b> <b>wires</b> are frequently used accordingly to inject the current into the grounding and find the grounding potential rise (GPR). The results of the {{calculations and}} measurements can be dependent on {{the location of the}} current and potential <b>lead</b> <b>wires</b> due to mutual influence between them and <b>the</b> grounding <b>wire.</b> It is important to determine to what extent the location of <b>the</b> <b>wires</b> influences <b>the</b> calculation results for the grounding with a simple configuration. Notably, in contrast to the measurements, for the calculations it is possible to locate <b>wires</b> vertically, also <b>the</b> potential <b>lead</b> <b>wire</b> can be replaced by the integral of the electric field. For the calculations the finite difference time domain method (FDTD) has been used in the work. In order to estimate to what extent the calculated GPR can be influenced by location of <b>the</b> <b>wires,</b> calculations with different wires locations have been carried out. An analysis of the calculation results has been made. There are calculation methods in which the injection of the current and calculation of the GPR are performed without the current and potential <b>lead</b> <b>wires.</b> <b>The</b> method based on the telegrapher's equations is one of such methods. In order to determine what location of <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> <b>wires</b> gives <b>the</b> same calculation results as those of the method that uses the telegrapher's equations, a comparison of calculation results of two methods has been made. Based on the calculation results it can be concluded that the calculated transient characteristics depend to a different extent on such factors as mutual location of <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> <b>wires</b> and <b>the</b> grounding <b>wire,</b> replacing <b>the</b> potential <b>lead</b> <b>wire</b> by <b>the</b> integral of the electric field, electrical parameters of the soil.

50|$|Starting {{from the}} second layer, the {{relocation}} is facilitated, since the wire is guided through the inter-spaces of the preceding layer. In case of deflections that are not too excessive {{as far as the}} process is concerned, <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> <b>leads</b> itself and with a constant number of windings per layer. It means for the wire guiding movement that the smaller the distance of the wire guiding nozzle towards the coil, the more precise the tracking must be. In certain circumstances it can be completely performed without a relocating movement, if the distance from the nozzle to the coil is that long that the force component against the guiding behavior of the wire itself has no longer an effect. Due to the self-guiding behavior of the wire, it is therefore possible that also during orthocyclic winding the wire guide can run continually and does not need to follow gradually.|$|E

25|$|The {{principle}} of silver/silver chloride sensors operation is {{the conversion of}} ion current at the surface of human tissues to electron current to be delivered through <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> <b>wire</b> to <b>the</b> instrument to read. An {{important part of the}} operation is electrolyte gel which is applied between the electrode and tissues. The gel contains free chloride ions such that the charge can be carried through the electrolyte, therefore the electrolyte can be considered as conductive for ion current as the human tissues. When the ion current exists, the silver atoms in the electrode oxidize and discharge cations to the electrolyte and the electrons carry charge through <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> <b>wire.</b> At <b>the</b> same time, the chloride ions which are anions in the electrolyte travel toward the electrode and they are reduced as they bond with silver of the electrode resulting in silver chloride and free electrons to deliver to <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> <b>wire.</b> <b>The</b> reaction allows current to pass from electrolyte to electrode and the electron current passes through <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> <b>wire</b> for <b>the</b> instrument to read.|$|R
40|$|Scattering {{resonances}} in ballistic conduction {{across a}} quantum dot {{in a weak}} magnetic field are investigated. Due to the special geometry considered, the resonances grow narrower with decreasing B, until at B = 0 they become bound states in the continuum. Whereas previously treated geometries exhibit at most one bound state with energy in the continuum, {{the number of such}} states in the present case is limited only by the number of transverse modes that <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> <b>leads</b> can sustain. Furthermore, the present model demonstrates the possibility of quantum-mechanical bound states in the continuum having a classical analog. The energy shifts of the resonances in a magnetic field show paramagnetic as well as diamagnetic behavior, which can be understood in terms of the dominant influence of a particular subband and its distance from the cutoff threshold in the dot region. ...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} technique {{designed to}} increase in-situ electrical connections in a cubic anvil press has been developed. Two encompassing cell designs (extruded gasket and pre-formed gasket) were tested with several electrical barrier methods: PVD coatings, G- 10 /FR- 4 and Canvas Electrical (C.

Many variations of techniques were attempted and each (n) th attempt was founded on the experience from/observation of the results obtained with the (n- 1) thtechnique variation. Eighteen pressure cell configurations were designed and tested. The cells with self-extruded gaskets were unsuccessful due to the destructive nature of the extruding gaskets on <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> <b>leads.</b> The final, successful pressure cell was designed with pre-formed gaskets, machined as a single part using a four-axis CNC mill with a C.

This technique was viable for applied hydraulic load up to 7, 000 psi. It allows for HPHT experiments requiring 4 -wire measurement methods to be made using only one anvil pair.

We demonstrate a piezoelectric nanowire based nanogenerator that converts biomechanical energy, {{such as the}} movement of a human finger and the body motion of a live hamster (Campbell’s dwarf), into electricity.

40|$|Eroding potentiometers {{have been}} devised for {{measuring}} the time-dependent positions of char fronts advancing through layers of insulating material subject to intense heating from one side. In the original application, the material layers of interest are thermal insulators in rocket motors and the heat comes from firing of the motors, but the principle of operation is equally applicable to other insulating materials subject to intense heating (e. g., ablative fire-retardant materials). Measuring the thickness decrement of propellant (in hybrid motors in particular) is another possible application of this transducer. Telemetry informs mission control of the propellant left after each burn. An eroding potentiometer could be characterized, more precisely, as an eroding two-wire resistor. It includes a twisted pair of thin, insulated wires oriented along the thickness of, and embedded in, the layer of thermal-insulation material to be tested (see figure).

30|$|One {{mechanism}} {{that could lead}} to such faceting is surface reconstruction due to charge stabilization in polar compounds. ZnO crystal is formed by alternating stacks of oppositely charged O 2 - and Zn 2 + planes parallel to the surface. If the resulting dipole moment perpendicular to the surface is nonzero, stabilization of such a surface is accomplished by a rearrangement of surface charges or by introducing compensating charges into the outermost surface planes [18]. This could lead a significant modification of the surface geometric structure and stoichiometry. The stabilization mechanism for the Zn-terminated face of ZnO has been experimentally investigated by a variety of techniques, and various mechanisms have been proposed for the reduction in the surface charge density to yield a stable Zn termination. Recent experimental studies [19] combined with theoretical calculations [20] suggest that the Zn-terminated surface can be stabilized by a reconstruction involving triangular surface structures [21]. However, due to the unstable nature of the catalyst at the wire tip, it is believed here that faceting due to droplet oscillation is the dominant {{mechanism that}} causes the surface reconstructions. The observations seen here can be explained based on a thermodynamic model used earlier to explain similar faceting in Si nanowires [17]. The allowed facets correspond to a wire that is widening or narrowing as it grows. The wire widens as the droplet is stretched thinner and contact angle β (Figure 4 a) decreases, which generates an inward force favoring the introduction of the narrowing facet. Conversely, the narrowing of <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> <b>leads</b> to the droplet applying an increasing outward force on the wire, favoring an introduction of the widening facet. This oscillatory mechanism leads to the periodic faceting seen here.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the distribution of}} the electron density and the potential in a quantum wire coupled to reservoirs, treating this structure as a unified quantum system and taking into account the Coulomb interaction of electrons. The chemical potential difference that exists between a decoupled, isolated quantum wire and the reservoirs gives rise to charge transfer in the coupled system. We show that the quantum wire can be charged positively or negatively or remain neutral as a whole, depending on such factors as the wire radius and the background charge density in the wire. The magnitude of the charge and its sign are to a large extent determined by the exchange interaction of the electrons in the wire. Using a Hartree-Fock approach, we develop a model of a quantum wire which includes the reservoirs. This model allows us to find the self-consistent distribution of the electron density and the potential in the wire both at equilibrium and in the presence of transport. The linear conductance is investigated {{as a function of the}} chemical potential. The nonadiabatic transition from the reservoirs to <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> <b>leads</b> to conductance oscillations caused by multiple scattering of electron waves. The period of the oscillations depends on the charge acquired by the wire and the exchange energy. We find that the exchange interaction strongly enhances the Friedel oscillations near the contacts. However, they do not noticeably suppress the conductance because the wire has a finite length and is charged. Under far from equilibrium conditions, which appear when the applied voltage exceeds the Fermi energy in the wire, the system becomes unstable with respect to fluctuations of the electric potential and the electron density. The instability results in the appearance of multistable electron states. Comment: 13 pages, Latex, 9 figure...|$|E

50|$|A thermosonic bond {{falls in}} the {{category}} of a solid state metallic bond which is formed by mating two metal surfaces well below their respective melting points. Coucoulas introduced Thermosonic bonding which significantly improved upon the bond-reliability produced by available commercial solid-state bonding machines where he pre-heated <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> <b>wire</b> (and/or metallized silicon chip) prior to introducing the ultrasonic energy cycle. In addition to thermal softening <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> <b>wire,</b> <b>the</b> subsequent delivery of ultrasonic energy produced further softening by interacting at the atomic lattice level of <b>the</b> heated <b>wire</b> (known as ultrasonic softening). These two independent softening mechanisms (pre-heating <b>lead</b> <b>wire</b> and deliverying <b>the</b> ultrasonic energy at the atomic lattice level) eliminated the incidences of cracking the fragile and costly silicon chip which were observed by Coucoulas when using earlier commercially available solid-state bonding machines. The improvement occurs because pre-heating and ultrasonic softening the lead-wire dramatically facilitated its deformation in forming the required contact area while using a relatively low set of bonding parameters. Depending on the temperature level and material properties of <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> <b>wire,</b> <b>the</b> onset of recrystallization (metallurgy) or hot working of <b>the</b> deforming <b>wire</b> can occur while it is forming the required contact area. Recrystallization takes place in the strain hardening region of <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> <b>wire</b> where it aids in the softening effect. If <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> was ultrasonically deformed at room temperature, it would tend to extensively strain hardened (cold working) and therefore tend to transmit damaging mechanical stresses to the silicon chip.
