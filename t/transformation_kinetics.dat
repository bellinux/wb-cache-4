Under such conditions, rates of surface nucleation and bulk nucleation are low {{due to their}} high activation energies. Thus, phase transformation occurs predominantly via interface nucleation [...] that depends on contact between nanoparticles. As a consequence, the transformation rate is particle number (size)-dependent and it proceeds faster in densely packed (or highly aggregated) than in loosely packed nanoparticles. Complex concurrent phase transformation and particle coarsening often occur in nanoparticles.|$|E

They are generated from percentage transformation-vs time measurements, and {{are useful for}} understanding the transformations of an alloy steel at elevated temperatures. An isothermal transformation diagram is only valid for one specific composition of material, and only if the temperature is held constant during the transformation, and strictly with rapid cooling to that temperature. Though usually used to represent <b>transformation</b> <b>kinetics</b> for steels, they {{also can be used}} to describe the kinetics of crystallization in ceramic or other materials.

The thickening rate of the lamellae is described with a modified multi-component Zener model of precipitation while the growth rate of massive γ is calculated with an expression for interface-controlled reactions. The model, which is coupled with a thermodynamic database, permits to investigate the influence of the alloy composition and cooling rate on the proportion of massive and lamellar γ. Calculted CCT diagrams showed good agreement with experimental data for binary alloys.

40|$|International audienceMost {{advanced}} {{high-strength steel}} products contain complex phases, including ferrite, bainite and martensite, which form successively during elaboration. It {{is essential to}} understand the effect of prior ferrite transformation on the subsequent bainite and martensite <b>transformation</b> <b>kinetics</b> to achieve precise control of the final microstructure. Nevertheless, {{the effect of the}} interface between the prior formed ferrite and the residual austenite (α/γ), together with the related chemical heterogeneity at the interface, on the subsequent phase transformations has been studied only rarely, and remains unclear. This study pays particular attention to the effect of the α/γ interface and its related concentration gradients on bainite and martensite transformation. It is shown that the interface and its related concentration gradients can play a very significant role on the subsequent bainite or martensite transformation kinetics: it retards bainite transformation whereas it accelerates martensite transformation. It is revealed from microprobe wavelength-dispersive spectrometry analysis and model calculations that there are both manganese and carbon gradients in front of the α/γ interface {{at the end of the}} ferrite transformation holding. The subsequent bainite <b>transformation</b> <b>kinetics</b> is controlled by the competition between the acceleration effect of the interface boundary itself and the retardation effect of the higher alloying concentration near the interface.

40|$|Purpose: The {{reason for}} writing {{this paper was}} to {{describe}} the <b>kinetics</b> of phase <b>transformations</b> during continuous heating from quenched state. In this investigation two high-speed steels of the variable concentration of W and Mo were used. Moreover, the differences in hardness of samples of the investigated steels {{in relationship to the}} heating rate were evaluated. Design/methodology/approach: The <b>kinetics</b> of phase <b>transformations</b> during continuous heating (tempering) from as-quenched state of investigated steels, was elaborated using a DT 1000 dilatometer of a French company Adamel. The microstructure of investigations steels in as-quenched state were examined by a light microscope Axiovert 200 MAT, scanning electron microscope Hitachi 3500 N and transmission JEM 200 CX microscope. The measurements of hardness were performed with the Vickers HPO 250 apparatus. Findings: Change of heating rate during tempering has strong influence on the temperatures of beginnings and the ends of individual transitions {{as well as on the}} accompanying dilatation effects. It was shown that in quenched high-speed steels a part of retained austenite was already transforming during heating for tempering, but its significant part transformed only during cooling process after tempering. Research limitations/implications: It has been found that the substitution of tungsten with molybdenum in HS 6 - 5 - 2 steel has influenced mainly the stability of retained austenite and the temperature of precipitation beginning of MC (MCs) type carbides. Whereas the precipitation ranges of ε carbide and cementite in both steels are close. Practical implications: Description of phase <b>transformations</b> <b>kinetics</b> during continuous heating from as-quenched state in high-speed steels.

The CALPHAD approach is applied to the study of the equilibrium thermodynamic properties of Pu-based alloys, Pu-X, where X=Al, Fe, Ga.
