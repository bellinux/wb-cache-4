5|$|In the 2010 general election, the Moderate Party {{increased}} {{its share of}} the vote to 30.06%. The Alliance got a majority of votes cast, but with 173 seats no absolute majority in parliament.

5|$|On 20 August, Tsipras {{announced}} {{the resignation of}} the Syriza-ANEL government, and that a legislative election was scheduled for 20 September. Tsakalotos {{and the rest of the}} cabinet remained as lame duck ministers whilst opposition parties attempted to form their own government. However, <b>the</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>parties</b> failed to form a government and Vassiliki Thanou-Christophilou was appointed as an interim Prime Minister on 27 August. On 28 August, Thanou-Christophilou's caretaker cabinet was sworn in, with George Chouliarakis being sworn in as the interim Minister of Finance.|$|E
5|$|Several {{procedures}} {{enable the}} Scottish Parliament to scrutinise the Government. The First Minister {{or members of}} the cabinet can deliver statements to Parliament upon which MSPs are invited to question. For example, {{at the beginning of}} each parliamentary year, the First Minister delivers a statement to the chamber setting out the Government's legislative programme for the forthcoming year. After the statement has been delivered, the leaders of <b>the</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>parties</b> and other MSPs question the First Minister on issues related to the substance of the statement.|$|E
5|$|The three-pronged {{government}} {{lasted only}} from May to December 1992, as Panić and Ćosić decided to challenge Milošević in institutionally-revised elections in December that same year. The December election {{ended up as}} a failure for the opposition to Milošević, as Ćosić {{pulled out of the}} campaign in the last moment due to health problems. Multiple politicians of <b>the</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>parties</b> criticized the US-instigated fossil-fuel sanctions {{in the midst of a}} cold 1992-93 winter, saying that they actually further helped sympathy for Milošević and not against him.|$|E

5|$|In May 1996, about 200 {{soldiers}} of the Central African Republic mutinied in Bangui, demanding salary increases and the abdication of Ange-Félix Patassé. In the aftermath, the renegades plundered and killed more than 50 people. Following this, the French troops stationed in the country suppressed the rebellion and restored the dictatorial power. After being elected, President Patassé announced a national unity government in early 1997. The Patassé government, <b>the</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>parties,</b> and religious groups signed the Bangui Agreements in January 1997 which were a series of measures designed to reconcile competing political factions, reform and strengthen the economy. The same year, the rebel troops refused a military base in Bangui and in June a new revolt broke out.|$|E
5|$|Stelmach {{clashed with}} rural landowners again in 2009 when his {{government}} introduced the Land Assembly Project Area Act, {{designed to make}} it easier for the government to acquire large blocks of land for public purposes such as ring roads or reservoirs. The Act allowed the government to identify land that it may be interested in expropriating at some point in the future and to indefinitely prohibit any development on that land that could conflict with the government's purposes. Despite vigorous opposition from landowners and <b>the</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>parties,</b> the bill passed the legislature in late April.|$|E
5|$|The Liberals made no new, radical {{proposals}} {{during their}} campaign, but instead ran a quiet campaign with occasional attacks on <b>the</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>parties.</b> They {{were convinced that}} the public still supported their party, and that no expensive promises need be made to voters. St. Laurent was made {{the image of the}} nation's prosperity, and the Liberals refused to admit any reason for discontent existed. When Minister of Finance Harris proposed raising the upcoming increase in old age pension by an additional four dollars a month, St. Laurent refused to consider it, feeling that the increase had been calculated {{on the basis of the}} available facts, and those facts had not changed.|$|E

5|$|The MDC-T led by Morgan Tsvangirai {{is now the}} {{majority}} in the Lower chamber of Parliament. The MDC split into two factions. One faction (MDC-M), now led by Arthur Mutambara contested the elections to the Senate, while the other, led by Tsvangirai, opposed to contesting the elections, stating that participation in a rigged election is tantamount to endorsing Mugabe's claim that past elections were free and fair. <b>The</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>parties</b> have resumed participation in national and local elections as recently as 2006. The two MDC camps had their congresses in 2006 with Tsvangirai being elected to lead MDC-T, which has become more popular than the other group.|$|E
5|$|After the election, {{many analysts}} {{concluded}} {{that it was the}} unity of <b>the</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>parties</b> against Congress, missing in the 1962 elections, that made the difference. The victory is attributed to the electoral alliance between DMK and Rajaji. Even though Congress had done an effective job of managing the state of Madras, the effective grass roots campaigning by the DMK and the political acumen of Annadurai, defeated the Congress and its leader M. Bhaktavatsalam. The popularity of the United Front was so large {{that they were able to}} win an absolute majority in ten out of the 14 districts in the state, while Congress could not accomplish that in a single district. This was largely due to the fact that the United Front was able to capitalize on its growing support in large towns and cities, combined with the decline in Congress support in its traditional Schedule Caste constituencies.|$|E
5|$|In August 1909, a {{group of}} army {{officers}} that had formed a military league, Stratiotikos Syndesmos, demanded, among other things, that the royal family be stripped of their military commissions. To save the King the embarrassment of removing his sons from their commissions, they resigned them. The military league attempted a coup d'état, and the King insisted on supporting the duly elected Hellenic Parliament in response. Eventually, the military league joined forces with Venizelos in calling for a National Assembly to revise the constitution. King George gave way, and new elections to the revising assembly were held in August 1910. After some political maneuvering, Venizelos became prime minister of a minority government. Just a month later, Venizelos called new elections for , at which he won an overwhelming majority after most of <b>the</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>parties</b> declined to take part.|$|E

5|$|On 6 October, {{a number}} of private interbank credit {{facilities}} to Icelandic banks were shut down. Prime Minister Geir Haarde addressed the nation in a speech that became infamous for its portentous closing words: 'God bless Iceland'. He announced a package of new regulatory measures which were {{to be put to}} the Althing, Iceland's parliament, immediately, with the cooperation of <b>the</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>parties.</b> These included the power of the FME to take over the running of Icelandic banks without nationalising them, and preferential treatment for depositors in the event that a bank had to be liquidated. In a separate measure, retail deposits in Icelandic branches of Icelandic banks were guaranteed in full. The emergency measures had been deemed unnecessary by the Icelandic government less than 24 hours earlier.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after winning}} an {{increased}} {{majority in the}} 2008 election, Stelmach's cabinet approved substantial raises for themselves, increasing the salary paid to cabinet ministers from $142,000 to $184,000 and that paid to the Premier from $159,450 to $213,450. The increases also affect the severance paid to ministers who resign or are defeated in elections—under the program implemented by Ralph Klein's government to replace the previously existing pension program, departing MLAs receive three months' pay for every year they served, {{with the level of}} the pay based on their three highest-earning years. The increases were attacked by the Canadian Taxpayers Federation and <b>the</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>parties,</b> but Stelmach defended the raises as the first received by cabinet ministers in fifteen years and as being necessary to attract qualified people to politics.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} of Singapore underwent several significant changes. Non-Constituency Members of Parliament {{were introduced in}} 1984 to allow up to three losing candidates from opposition parties to be appointed as MPs. Group Representation Constituencies (GRCs) was introduced in 1988 to create multi-seat electoral divisions, intended to ensure minority representation in parliament. Nominated Members of Parliament were introduced in 1990 to allow non-elected non-partisan MPs. The Constitution was amended in 1991 to provide for an Elected President who has veto power {{in the use of}} national reserves and appointments to public office. <b>The</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>parties</b> have complained that the GRC system has made {{it difficult for them to}} gain a foothold in parliamentary elections in Singapore, and the plurality voting system tends to exclude minority parties.|$|E

50|$|The American Party (commonly {{called the}} Know Nothings) and <b>the</b> <b>Opposition</b> <b>Party</b> formed a {{coalition}} government which elected Nathaniel P.

Several members were elected to the 29th Illinois General Assembly on <b>the</b> <b>Opposition</b> <b>Party</b> ticket in <b>the</b> election of 1874; these included Moses Wentworth in the 1st district, William H. Stickney in the 6th district, and William H. Skelly in the 7th district. [...] The coalition was not successful at the local level, and did not appear in subsequent elections.|$|R
5|$|Kirchner soon distanced {{himself from}} Duhalde, {{removing}} those close to the former president from the government to reduce his political influence. He also sought supporters across {{the social and political}} spectrum to counter Duhalde's influence in the party. Although Duhalde was not initially against Kirchner, Kirchner tried to prevent the presence of alternative leaderships within the PJ. However, they put their differences behind them during the October 2003 legislative elections. Their dispute was fanned by the political weight of Buenos Aires province (the most populous in Argentina, with almost 40 percent of the national vote), and continued through the 2005 midterm elections. Without consensus in the PJ for a candidate for senator in the Buenos Aires province, both leaders had their wives run for office: Hilda González de Duhalde for the PJ and Cristina Fernández de Kirchner for the Front for Victory, which contested the election as a different party. Cristina Kirchner won the election. As in 2003, the elections were defined by Peronist factions; <b>the</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>parties</b> could not put up a united national front. The victory gave Kirchner the confidence to remove Lavagna, Rafael Bielsa, Jose Pampuro, and Alicia Kirchner from his cabinet and replace them with ministers who, though less well-known, had perspectives closer to his own.|$|E
