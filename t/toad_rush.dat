50|$|The game opens {{for both}} book {{one and two}} with Toad and Toadette getting the Power Star {{at the top of}} the building, until the villainous giant crow named Wingo takes the star and kidnaps either Toad or Toadette. As the game progresses, Toad and Toadette defeat Draggadon, the king of Pyropuff Peak. At the end of book two, Wingo kidnaps Toadette and sends Toad flying away from the battle tower. In book three, Wingo leaves the cave with the star, before Toadette escapes and {{attempts}} to reunite with Toad. After Wingo takes Toadette to the watch tower, Toad climbs up to it filled with treasures and throws the summoned giant turnip at Wingo who swallows it for heavy weight and falls from the sky, freeing Toadette and the star. At the end of book three, <b>Toad</b> <b>rushes</b> off alone and follows the falling Green Star in the glass pipe.|$|R

40|$|A {{glasshouse}} {{study examined}} weed seedling emergence in soils collected from 20 sites. Soil {{was placed in}} open topped columns of differing heights {{and the number of}} seedlings that emerged were counted. A total of 77 different weed species emerged but most were in small numbers. Four summer broadleaf weeds, black nightshade (Solanum nigrum), fathen (Chenopodium album), spurrey (Spergula arvensis) and willow weed (Polygonum persicaria), showed little restriction and emerged freely from depths up to 50 mm. Of the grasses, summer grass (Digitaria sanguinalis) and annual poa (Poa annua) were clearly constrained at depths greater than 20 mm while smooth witchgrass (Panicum dichotomiflorum) was not. Of the other broadleaf weeds, waxweed (Hydrocotyle sp.) and Lotus sp. were constrained at depths greater than 30 mm while two small-seeded species, cudweed (Gnaphalium sp.) and <b>toad</b> <b>rush</b> (Juncus bufonius) did not emerge from depths greater than 10 mm...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Peru has a {{long history}} of mud constructions. The use of these {{techniques}} has been forgotten throughout time, and currently the adobe buildings lack a constructive system suitable for our seismic, economic and ecological characteristics. Current solutions to this problem, including the countryâ€™s normative, alter its natural characteristics and make it more expensive. To achieve a way of life that integrates cultural identity, dwelling, environment and health, a natural material of easy acquisition is studied: the <b>toad</b> <b>rush</b> (Juncus bufonius L.) It is a plant that grows in humid areas of the country, between 0 and 4 000 AMSL, in order to address its use as reinforcement in the walls of adobe, based on structural proposals approved in Peru. An experimental methodology has been used under the modality of trial and error. The study was performed in three stages; in the first one, its elasticity coefficient and resistance to traction was determined in laboratory tests. The analysis were performed on simple fibers and braids (of up to 6 fibers), finding the following results: elasticity modulus = 36 kPa with 5 % strain, maximum tension stress = 745 N in both directions with 12 % elongation. Using these data, an orthogonal mesh of toad rushes, with 0. 030 m of separation between braids, was designed to be attached to an adobe wall. This mesh was subjected to a test of horizontal impact, applying 84. 49 MP...|$|E
