50|$|Forest floor {{interception}} is {{the part}} of the (net) precipitation or <b>throughfall</b> that is temporarily stored in the top layer of the forest floor and successively evaporated within a few hours or days during and after the rainfall event. The forest floor can consist of bare soil, short vegetation (like grasses, mosses, creeping vegetation, etc.) or litter (i.e. leaves, twigs, or small branches).|$|E
50|$|Another {{method that}} tried to avoid this problem is applied by e.g., Shuttleworth et al. 1984, Calder et al. 1986, and Calder 1990. They covered the forest floor with plastic sheets and {{collected}} the <b>throughfall.</b> The disadvantage of this method {{is that it is}} not suitable for long periods, because in the end the trees will dry due to water shortage, and the method is also not applicable for snow events.|$|E
50|$|In Hydrology, <b>throughfall</b> is {{the process}} which {{describes}} how wet leaves shed excess water onto the ground surface. These drops have erosive power because they are larger than rain drops, however, if they travel a shorter distance their erosive power is reduced. In {{the case of a}} high canopy, higher than what is required for the drops to reach terminal velocity, about 8 m, the erosive power is increased.|$|E
50|$|In hydrology, {{stemflow}} is {{the flow}} of intercepted water down the trunk or stem of a plant. Stemflow, along with <b>throughfall,</b> {{is responsible for the}} transferral of precipitation and nutrients from the canopy to the soil. In tropical rainforests, where this kind of flow can be substantial, erosion gullies can form {{at the base of the}} trunk. However, in more temperate climates stemflow levels are low and have little erosional power.|$|E
50|$|In soils, it {{is assumed}} that larger amounts of natural phenols are {{released}} from decomposing plant litter rather than from <b>throughfall</b> in any natural plant community. Decomposition of dead plant material causes complex organic compounds to be slowly oxidized (lignin-like humus) or to break down into simpler forms (sugars and amino sugars, aliphatic and phenolic organic acids), which are further transformed into microbial biomass (microbial humus) or are reorganized, and further oxidized, into humic assemblages (fulvic and humic acids), which bind to clay minerals and metal hydroxides.|$|E
50|$|Thinning {{decreases}} {{canopy closure}} {{and increases the}} penetration of solar radiation into the canopy. The photosynthetic efficiency of this energy is improved, and needle retention is prolonged, especially in the lower parts of the crown. The root system, crown length, crown diameter, and crown area all increase after thinning. Even if soil evaporation and individual tree transpiration increases after thinning, total evapo-transpiration at stand level tends to decrease; canopy water interception is reduced and <b>throughfall</b> increased, so that tree-water status usually improves after thinning.|$|E
50|$|Litterfall is the {{dominant}} pathway for nutrient return to the soil, especially for nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). The accumulation of these nutrients in {{the top layer of}} soil is known as soil immobilization. Once the litterfall has settled, decomposition of the litter layer, accomplished through the leaching of nutrients by rainfall and <b>throughfall</b> and by the efforts of detritivores, releases the breakdown products into the soil below and therefore contributes to the cation exchange capacity of the soil. This holds especially true for highly weathered tropical soils.|$|E
50|$|These {{modifications}} at {{the crown}} level influence photosynthate production positively {{as long as}} water supply is not limiting. Even if soil evaporation and individual tree transpiration are more important after thinning, total evapo-transpiration at stand level tends to decrease. Furthermore, with the reduced importance of leaf area index (LAI), thinning reduces canopy water interception and increases <b>throughfall.</b> This explains why the soil moisture content increases in a thinned stand. Thus, during the vegetation period, tree-water status is usually better in a thinned stand than in a high-density stand.|$|E
50|$|In soils, it {{is assumed}} that larger amounts of phenols are {{released}} from decomposing plant litter rather than from <b>throughfall</b> in any natural plant community.

There has been a long debate about the ability of plants to uptake humic substances from their root systems and to metabolize them. There is now a consensus about how humus plays a hormonal role rather than simply a nutritional role in plant physiology.|$|E

Our analyses of rainfall and <b>throughfall</b> KE are based on measurements using calibrated splash cups. Two experiments were carried out, one focusing on density effects and the other testing for species-specific effects and effects of species mixtures. The major architectural traits were measured to characterize sapling morphology. Mixed effects models were used for statistical analysis. In both models, rainfall KE was identified {{as the most important}} effect on <b>throughfall</b> KE. Overall, rainfall KE per area was reduced by 59 % below the canopy of the studied saplings. We found a significant effect of sapling density on <b>throughfall</b> KE. This is primarily due to the relation between free <b>throughfall</b> and released <b>throughfall.</b> As free <b>throughfall</b> possesses a far higher KE than released <b>throughfall</b> originating from saplings, lower sapling density results in higher total <b>throughfall</b> KE. We also showed that the influence of density on <b>throughfall</b> KE decreases with increasing sapling height due to lateral canopy growth of the saplings. <b>Throughfall</b> KE was significantly different among species. We attribute this to species-specific differ- ences in crown architectural traits. These traits have opposite influence on <b>throughfall</b> KE and interact with each other.

40|$|The {{conversion}} of vegetated land cover to impervious surfaces has made stormwater runoff {{into a major}} hydrological concern due to its capacity to deteriorate water quality and stream health in cities. Urban forests are capable of {{reducing the amount of}} potential stormwater runoff by regulating <b>throughfall</b> via canopy rainfall interception. The lack of stand-scale studies of urban <b>throughfall</b> hinders realistic estimates of the benefits of urban trees for stormwater regulation. Urban forests are extremely variable with regard to canopy cover and species composition and are to a large extent managed by private residents with varying landscape preferences. To quantify the amount of rainfall interception by vegetation in an urban forest we measured <b>throughfall</b> in Raleigh, North Carolina, USA between July and November 2010.

Monthly <b>throughfall</b> is calculated by applying a mass balance model on weather data from Singapore; Vancouver, Canada; and Stanford, USA. Regression analysis is then performed on the calculated <b>throughfall</b> with three dependent variables (i. e. maximum canopy storage, average rainfall depth and time interval between two consecutive rainfall in a month) to derive the empirical equations.

The equations are further verified with calculated monthly <b>throughfall</b> from other weather data and actual <b>throughfall</b> field measurements, giving an accuracy of about 80 - 90 %.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Throughfall,</b> the {{solution}} that {{falls from the}} forest canopy, is an important and commonly measured flux in forest ecosystem studies. <b>Throughfall</b> water and chemistry are highly variable spatially, requiring large numbers of collectors to quantify it.

Our <b>throughfall</b> collection method uses com-pact ion exchange resin columns that need only be collected every 1 – 2 months. The resin columns are subsequently extracted with 1. 0 M potassium iodide (KI), releasing anions back into solution, with extraction efficiencies> 94 % for sulfate, nitrate, and chloride. The extracts are analyzed by ion-chromatography (IC) to determine the total microequivalents of anions per unit area of collector surface collected over the period of resin column exposure.

40|$|To {{study and}} model the interrill erosion process in an {{unmanaged}} Japanese cypress (Chamaecyparis obtusa) plantation, soil splash detachment rates were estimated {{based on the}} quantification of <b>throughfall</b> raindrop indices. <b>Throughfall</b> drops and soil splash detachment were simultaneously observed in the field, and observed data were compared with estimates produced by previous models. Observations took place over five months in 2005, during six observation periods. Raindrop indices of kinetic energy (KE), momentum (M), and momentum multiplied by the drop diameter (MD) were calculated from drop diameters and velocities. The median volume diameter of 1. 99 1 mm for the overall observation period was well bounded by those from other Japanese cypress plantations. <b>Throughfall</b> consisted of large drops, generated as drips, exceeding 3 mm in diameter. The fall height was insufficient for the drops to attain terminal velocity, with 91 % of the drops reaching less than 90 % terminal velocity. The observed <b>throughfall</b> raindrop indices had strong correlation with <b>throughfall</b> rainfall intensity, even though <b>throughfall</b> raindrops occurred in seven rainfall events with different meteorological conditions. The values of observed KE and M were lower than previous model-derived estimations. Earlier models tended to overestimate <b>throughfall</b> KE and M, partly because the expected velocity was greater than that observed, and partly {{because they did not}} consider the effect of the splash water component during <b>throughfall.</b> The splash detachment rate in forests was weakly correlated with the total-amount raindrop indices but strongly correlated with the maximum value of raindrop indices over a short time scale such as 1 h.

In the <b>throughfall</b> of C. japonica (Cj 1 and Cj 2), archaeal amoA genes were actually detected by PCR, although betaproteobacterial amoA genes were not found. Therefore, nitrification {{observed in the}} <b>throughfall</b> was probably accomplished by AOA. qPCR analysis estimated that the abundance of archaeal amoA gene in 1  mL of <b>throughfall</b> from Cj 1 or Cj 2 was < 20 copies. This quantity was close {{to that of a}} low-nutrient groundwater sample (< 100 copies mL− 1, Reed et al. 2010), but lower than that of a deep oligotrophic lake sample (1.8  ×  103 – 5.6  ×  103, Auguet et al. 2012). Erguder et al. (2009) suggested that AOA play a more important role than AOB in the nitrogen cycle under low-ammonium, low-phosphate, low-pH, and/or sulfide-containing conditions. The initial ammonium concentrations in the <b>throughfall</b> of C. japonica (Cj 1 : 0.17  mM; Cj 2 : 0.40  mM) were as low as the level in which the moderately thermophilic AOA (Candidatus Nitrososphaera gargensis) showed high activity (0.14 or 0.79  mM) (Hatzenpichler et al. 2008). The phosphate concentrations were also low (< 2  µM) in the <b>throughfall.</b> In addition, the pH of the <b>throughfall</b> was weakly acidic (Cj 1 : 5.7; Cj 2 : 5.6); therefore, the <b>throughfall</b> of C. japonica may be preferred by AOA rather than AOB.

40|$|This thesis {{defines a}} {{physically}} based model describing the kinetic energy of <b>throughfall</b> from any vegetation canopy. Empirical {{measurements of the}} drop-size distribution of rainfall and sub-canopy <b>throughfall</b> were used to develop the model which was tested {{in the context of}} splash erosion. Comparisons are made for individual storms between rain falling in the open and through a canopy. Three canopies were used, one oak and two tropical rain forest differing in height. Through each storm raindrop sizes were frequently measured using the paper-staining technique. Kinetic energy/mm/m 2 was calculated from the drop sizes, their velocities and amount of rain or <b>throughfall.</b> The velocities were assumed to depend on the height of fall. In the rain forest sites splash cups surrounded by uniform areas of sand were used to measure the material splashed. The oak canopy data was used to examine the validity of a working hypothesis relating qualitatively the size of <b>throughfall</b> drops to the saturation of the canopy. It was confirmed that the canopy changed the drop-size distribution of the rain and consequently changed the kinetic energy/mm/m 2. The sequences of drop-size distribution change proposed by the hypothesis were related to the cumulated canopy storage. The tropical rain forest results confirmed these findings and extended them. Although rainfall kinetic energy/mm/m 2 may be predicted from rainfall intensity, <b>throughfall</b> kinetic energy/mm/m 2 was independent of intensity and the frequency distribution of the energy of <b>throughfall</b> samples was bimodal, with a high energy group which was commonly higher than that of the rainfall. The probability of a thoroughfall sample being in either energy group depended on the cumulated canopy storage or the percentage storm duration elapsed. The relative magnitude of rainfall and <b>throughfall</b> total kinetic energy depended on the saturation of the canopy and on the canopy height and for some storms the <b>throughfall</b> energy was higher than the rainfall. Soil splash increased with increasing kinetic energy.

The goal {{of this research is}} to quantify the attenuation of rainfall intensity by forest canopy interception, with the specific objective of estimating the contribution of this attenuation to hillslope hydrology and slope stability during extreme rainfall. Measurements of <b>throughfall</b> in two forest stands in the Pacific Northwest showed peak rainfall intensities were lagged in time and damped in intensity compared to rainfall measured in nearby openings. Spatial patterns of intensity smoothing and <b>throughfall</b> amounts persisted among storms.

A black-box model to quantify lagging and damping of <b>throughfall</b> efficiently described timevarying rates of <b>throughfall</b> using only data of rainfall and storm-total <b>throughfall.</b> However, the prediction capabilities of this model were limited because variation of best-fit model parameters among storms was unpredictable.

40|$|Since June 2004 <b>throughfall</b> {{samples in}} beech and spruce {{vegetation}} {{have been taken}} at the observatory Milesovka. Ever since 1998 fog water samples have been taken there as well. In this paper are compared the concentrations of main ions and trace elements in <b>throughfall</b> and in deposited precipitation. The concentrations of main ions and trace elements in throughfal are primarily affected by the volume of samples. The highest concentrations of monitored sustances in <b>throughfall</b> were recorded in September and in October when the lowest rainfall totals were measured. The concentrations of monitored sustances were in <b>throughfall</b> mostly higher in spruce vegetation in comparison with beech vegetation. It is {{probably due to the}} thicker treetop in spruce vegetation on Milesovka observatory. Due to the thicker treetop a smaller volume of <b>throughfall</b> is let fall and the substances from ambient air are captured more effectively in comparison with beech vegetation. In the case of main ions the lowest concentrations were measured in fog water samples. For trace elements wasn´t data. From comparison with reference locality Lesni potok is obvious that concentrations of monitored sustances in <b>throughfall</b> on Milesovka exceed sharply concentrations in locality Lesni potok. This difference is considerably higher by spruce vegetation in comparison to beech vegetation which indicate that it is necessary take not only local air quality into account but also type of vegetation and thick of treetop which can very significantly contribute to the chemical composition of <b>throughfall...</b>|$|E
