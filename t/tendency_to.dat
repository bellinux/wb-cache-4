A weaker effect should {{be found in}} the second alphabet, as names in second alphabets are likely to be less connected to the self. Hoorens and Todorova found that bilinguals with a <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> like their name letters in Cyrillic also had a <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> like their name letters in the Roman alphabet. The effect was found to be weaker in the second alphabet. This was replicated in a Thai-English study by Hoorens, Nuttin, Herman and Pavakanun.|$|E

5|$|An infant with an anxious-avoidant {{pattern of}} {{attachment}} will avoid or ignore the caregiver—showing little emotion when the caregiver departs or returns. The infant will not explore very much {{regardless of who}} is there. Infants classified as anxious-avoidant (A) represented a puzzle in the early 1970s. They did not exhibit distress on separation, and either ignored the caregiver on their return (A1 subtype) or showed some <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> approach together with some <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> ignore or {{turn away from the}} caregiver (A2 subtype). Ainsworth and Bell theorized that the apparently unruffled behaviour of the avoidant infants was in fact a mask for distress, a hypothesis later evidenced through studies of the heart-rate of avoidant infants.|$|E

5|$|At low forward speeds, the {{precession}} of {{the front}} wheel is too quick, contributing to an uncontrolled bike’s <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> oversteer, start to lean {{the other way and}} eventually oscillate and fall over. At high forward speeds, the precession is usually too slow, contributing to an uncontrolled bike’s <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> understeer and eventually fall over without ever having reached the upright position. This instability is very slow, on the order of seconds, and is easy for most riders to counteract. Thus a fast bike may feel stable even though it is actually not self-stable and would fall over if it were uncontrolled.|$|E

40|$|Self-control theory {{holds that}} human nature {{consists}} of selfishimpulses whose satisfaction often entails offending. Modern behav-ioural science has discerned emotional systems and cognitive biases underlying <b>tendencies</b> <b>to</b> engage in prosocial and self-directed behav-iours, which themselves predict offending. Many of these tendencies {{appear in the}} construct of self-control, but are not sufficiently dealt with by life-course criminology. This paper presents an expanded model of human nature that implies that self-control is factorially-complex, containing self-regulation; prosociality (<b>tendencies</b> <b>to</b> form social bonds and engage in social reciprocity); and self-direction (<b>tendencies</b> <b>to</b> work on one’s own long-term behalf without external sanctions). This model also suggests that the construct of opportunity should be expanded to include opportunities for prosocial and self-directed behaviours in addition to crime and deviance. What is human nature, {{and what does it}} have to do with crime? Human nature consists of the inherent potentials and abilities shared by all or most individuals...|$|R
