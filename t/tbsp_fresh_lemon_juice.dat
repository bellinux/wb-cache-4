40|$|Dental caries is a localized, {{transmissible}} {{infection that}} {{ends up in the}} destruction of hard dental tissue. It results from the accumulation of plaque on the surface of teeth and biochemical activities of complex microorganisms. Streptococcus mutans {{is one of the main}} opportunist pathogen of dental caries, which plays a major role in fermenting carbohydrates that result in acid production, leading to the corrosion of tooth enamel. In addition, other microorganisms like Lactobacillus species, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus are also associated with active caries lesions. Lactobacillus acidophilus is one of the most common organisms. The in vitro antimicrobial activity of <b>lemon</b> <b>juice,</b> tomato juice, aqueous extracts of mint leaves, coriander leaves and ginger were studied against Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus which are associated with dental caries. The aqueous extracts of the selected plants exhibited antimicrobial activity against all the tested microorganisms.

St Vincent wrote to Earl Spencer, commenting [...] "I have ever considered {{the care of the}} sick and wounded {{as one of the first}} duties of a Commander-in-chief, by sea or land." [...] Based on Doctor Baird's advice on cleanliness and hygiene the admiral brought in as many fresh vegetables as he could, along with vast quantities of <b>fresh</b> <b>lemon</b> <b>juice</b> to minimise illness, particularly scurvy. The effect was dramatic. The hospital ship that accompanied the fleet was sent home unneeded and in November 1800 when the fleet came to anchor in Torbay there were as few as sixteen hospital cases among the estimated twenty three thousand men. In a letter to Sir Evan Nepean, first secretary to the Admiralty, St Vincent described Baird as [...] "the most valuable man in the Navy not excepting the Board itself," [...] The oncoming winter of 1800–1801 forced the admiral to live ashore at Torre Abbey overlooking Torbay.

First part of this thesis is dedicated to the optimalisation of the experimantal conditions for antioxidant capacity measurements {{as well as to the}} construction of apparatus for flow measurings.

In the second part of this thesis the freshly developed method was used to determinate total antioxidant capacity of real food product simples, namely tea and coffee simples, beers, wines, chocolates, fresh fruit juices and selected food supplements. Results of this analysis were expressed as a vitamin C equivalent antioxidant capacity (VCEAC) related to standard, in mg/ml for liquid simples and in g/mg for solid simples.

40|$|Abstract Background Epidemiologic {{research}} has shown that perimenopausal contraception is an important medical issue, because women during the perimenopause still need effective contraception. The objective {{of the study was to}} assess the contraceptive choices of perimenopausal Turkish women. Methods This is a descriptive cross-sectional study that in a non – random fashion recruited 202 perimenopausal and naturally menopausal women who lived in a suburban area of Istanbul. Women who took part were aged between 45 – 59 years old. Chief database used to identify the suitable participants in the district. Subjects who voluntarily participated in the study were interviewed in their homes by the researcher. The analysis of the data was evaluated using percentages. Results The percentage of sexually active women among the participants was 87. 6 %. A large majority – 80. 2 % – of the participants did not have any idea of when they should bring contraception to an end. The method most commonly used was withdrawal (Coitus Interruptus), represented by 38. 8 %. In regard to the participants' choices of medical contraception, those being utilized were the IUD (24. 3 %), tubal sterilization (8. 9 %), condom (5. 9 %) and COC (6. 4 %). Additionally, 18 % of women used other traditional methods including vaginal lavage, vaginal aspirin, and even inserting a small sponge presoaked with <b>fresh</b> <b>lemon</b> <b>juice</b> or cola deep into the vagina. Among the perimenopausal women who participated, the IUD was the most popular and appropriate contraceptive method. Conclusion Most perimenopausal Turkish women are still using traditional methods and women's knowledge about contraception in the menopausal stages is very limited. Health professionals should provide information about perimenopausal contraception. </p...|$|R

40|$|This paper reviews {{historical}} aspects regarding {{medical knowledge}} on scurvy vitamin C deficiency, and its etiological factors. This disease used to affect naval-crews on long lasting sea voyages, soldiers {{during times of}} war and the poor. Although efficient therapy of scurvy (<b>fresh</b> vegetables, <b>lemon</b> <b>juice)</b> was known in the mid- 18 th century, its etiology was not known. It was believed to be caused by the cold, moist winds, unhealthy evaporations malnutrition and it was called "alkaline disease". It was established that acid substances like <b>lemon</b> <b>juice,</b> had beneficial effects on the disease However, it was soon generally accepted that it was caused by deficient diet. In 1830, Dr. John Elliotson, Professor of Medicine at London University supported this opinion. In 1928, Albert Szent Gyordyi, professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Szeged and Budapest Universities, isolated vitamin C from green pepper, vegetable proved to be rich with vitamin C. Due to this discovery, and some discoveries regarding biological processes, he was awarded the Nobel Prize for medicine and physiology in 1937 Back in 1864, a military doctor in Belgrade, Dr. Maksim Nikolić-Miškovićev from Sremski Karlovci, wrote to Ministry of Defence of the Serbian Principality. He informed the authorities about a successful, quick and cheap cure for scurvy - pepper juice. A medical board headed by Dr. Vladan Đorđević was formed to evaluate his discovery. Dr. Nikolić-Miškovićev was underestimated and laughed at, and his discovery was completely forgotten The aim of this paper was to correct injustice done to Dr. Maksim Nikolić-Miškovićev...|$|R
