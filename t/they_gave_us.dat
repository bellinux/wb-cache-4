However, after hearing labelmates Hüsker Dü's double album Zen Arcade (1984), {{which had been}} recorded a month earlier, Minutemen decided to write more material. Watt later commented: [...] "It wasn't really a competition even. When I wrote 'Take that Hüskers!" [...] in [...] it was acknowledging that <b>they</b> <b>gave</b> <b>us</b> the idea to make a double album."

It was a magnificent final. We knew that they could score goals but that we could also. We needed to keep going but after 63 games it was really difficult." [...] Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard also praised West Ham, stating: [...] "West Ham were brilliant, <b>they</b> <b>gave</b> <b>us</b> a really good game {{but we had a}} never-say-die attitude and we stuck in there, our best chance was on penalties as we did not have any energy left." [...] Due {{to the nature of the}} comeback, the match has come to be regarded as The Gerrard Final, teammate Peter Crouch summed up the effect Gerrard had on the match: [...] "When the injury-time board went up we thought our chance had gone, but it is always good to have a player like Steven Gerrard in your team." [...] A BBC Sport poll in May 2015 deemed Gerrard's goal to be the best in an FA Cup Final from the past 50 years.|$|E

2500|$|We {{were at the}} end of our {{recording}} {{contract with}} Century Media, and basically they didn't know if we were going to re-sign with them, so <b>they</b> <b>gave</b> <b>us</b> a very small budget for our last album to work with. That was about $20,000 which is a nothing deal to do a record. What we needed to do at the time was to find a producer that was immediately available to make a record with such a small budget, and that guy was Kelly Gray (laughs). Unfortunately, he was just not the right guy to do this album." ...|$|E

Prosecutors had [...] "presented proof that Littlejohn's blood, tissue and DNA were found on the plastic ties that were used to bind St. Guillen's hands." [...] The six men / six women jury took less than seven hours to convict Littlejohn of murdering Imette St. Guillen and found him guilty of first degree murder. One juror, Marian Mallero, said: [...] "The DNA said a lot about it. <b>They</b> <b>gave</b> <b>us</b> evidence and it was obvious"; and, [...] "He's guilty, that's all I'm going to say."

2500|$|Hobbs {{ended the}} series with an {{aggregate}} of 662 runs {{at an average}} of 82.75, setting a new record number of runs for an individual batsman in a Test series. Jack Crawford, now living in Australia, was struck by the improvement in Hobbs since they had played together at Surrey, noting that he seemed to possess no weaknesses. In his review of the tour, Warner said: [...] "I have long since exhausted my vocabulary of praise in favour of Rhodes and Hobbs, and, thanks in a very large degree to their superlative work, our batting was eminently successful. Too much stress cannot be laid on what they accomplished, for in innings after innings <b>they</b> <b>gave</b> <b>us</b> a wonderful start. They were the backbone of the batting." [...] In addition, Hobbs ran out 15 batsmen and Warner praised his fielding at cover point. The Australians did not dare run when he fielded the ball for fear of the speed of his throw. In all first-class matches, Hobbs scored 943 runs at 55.47.|$|E
2500|$|The largely unenthusiastic press {{reaction}} to the album caused the individual members of the band to lose faith {{in the concept of}} an ongoing, periodic series of band reunions and ultimately, all five members returned to their own careers following the album's release. [...] In the following years, the band themselves would echo many of the sentiments expressed by the music press, with the general consensus being that the recording of the album was rushed and ill-thought out. [...] Gene Clark offered his thoughts on the album during a 1977 interview: [...] "I am disappointed in that album. Some of the harsh criticism is unjust, because, if you listen to it carefully, the album isn't that bad, but it just hasn't got the punch that it could have had if we'd taken the time." [...] Chris Hillman concurred with Clark, telling The Byrds' biographer Johnny Rogan [...] "In all honesty, we didn't have enough time on the album. <b>They</b> <b>gave</b> <b>us</b> one-and-a-half months to do that album, expecting guys to regroup after a five to six year absence." [...] Hillman also cited the band's eagerness to avoid conflict as a contributing factor to the album's artistic failure: [...] "everybody was so afraid of stepping on the other person's feet because of the tension that had gone down six years prior to that, that it became a bland album. Everybody was being too nice to each other." [...] McGuinn blamed the reunion album's lack of success, at least partly, on the hedonism exhibited by members of the band during the recording process: [...] "David had this incredibly strong pot. Half a joint and you couldn't do anything. We were stoned out of our minds the whole time. I don't remember much recording." ...|$|E
