Amid Amidi of Cartoon Brew called the opening revolutionary {{and explained that}} [...] "in 35 short and sweet seconds, he liberates the animation of The Simpsons from years of graphic banality." [...] He continued: [...] "The visual look of the show, which has been so carefully controlled by its producers, becomes a giddy and unrestrained playground for graphic play, and the balance of creative authority is shifted from the writers' room to the animators in one fell swoop." [...] When comparing the segment to Banksy's, Amidi concluded that it is [...] "in fact, far more subversive because he focuses almost exclusively on making a pictorial statement, relegating the show's dominant literary elements to the back seat." [...] Similarly, Television Blend's Katey Rich wrote that she appreciates [...] "The Simpsons always being willing <b>to</b> <b>push</b> <b>the</b> <b>envelope</b> in different ways", but admitted {{that it would take}} her [...] "some time to get the gangly-legged Marge Simpson and the leering Homer Simpson out of [...] brain." ...|$|E

Finally, distributed embodiment refers to how the sense of being present in the world can be separated from that of ownership of a particular body, through the development of new approaches to deploying the technologies of virtual realization.
