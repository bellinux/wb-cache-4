40|$|DIN- 6847 is {{the most}} {{suitable}} standard to estimate shielding requirements in medical radiotherapy installations using linear electron accelerators. Its calculation method {{is based on the}} <b>tenth-value</b> <b>thickness</b> concept for which values given by curves and tables are recommended in DIN- 6847. These parameters have been estimated for both primary and secondary X-ray beams using the MCNP code based on the Monte Carlo method. Results show that DIN- 6847 values are conservative for secondary X-ray beam, but not always for direct radiation. The methodology used has been tested using the mentioned code and results are well consistent. I. INTRODU~ON There is a great number of medical installations using particle accelerators for radiotherapy. The importance of an accurate estimation of the doses due to these installations that can be received by health workers, patients or public is obvious. The lower limits of doses established in the new ICRP recommendations [l] imply a recalculation of items concerning such installations 121. There are only two known standards [3], [4] to estimate shielding requirements in medical installations using linear accelerators, i. e. NCRP- 51 and DIN- 6847. The last one is more suitable for this type of calculations. NCRP- 51 is incomplete and difficult to apply, while DIN- 6847 is fairly comprehensive and easy to apply [2], [S]. However, it is based on various semiempirical approaches which should be adequately verified. In the paper, the <b>tenth-value</b> <b>thickness</b> included in DIN- 6847 for various materials for primary and secondary X-rays produced in electron accelerators has been verified using the MCNP code based on the Monte Carlo method [6]...|$|E
