5|$|Bush {{began his}} {{presidency}} with approval ratings near 50percent. After the September 11 attacks, Bush gained an approval rating of 90percent, maintaining 80 to 90percent approval {{for four months}} after the attacks. It remained over 50percent during most of his first term and <b>then</b> <b>fell</b> to as low as 19percent in his second term.|$|E
5|$|Flooding {{returned}} {{in the winter}} of early 1890, when the river first rose very quickly and <b>then</b> <b>fell</b> very quickly. Portland's main street was completely submerged, communication over the Cascades was cut off, and many rail lines were forced to shut down. In 1894, another major flood occurred on the Willamette, and although it too caused huge damage, it was not as large as that of 1861.|$|E
5|$|His {{younger brother}} William {{was born in}} 1927. Their father came from Kentucky and managed a dairy. Charles Keating Sr. lost a leg in a hunting accident, and <b>then</b> <b>fell</b> into a long decline from Parkinson's disease around 1931, and was nursed by his wife {{until his death in}} 1964.|$|E

25|$|Whether Mozart {{declined}} gradually, experiencing {{great fear}} and sadness, {{or whether he}} was fundamentally in good spirits {{toward the end of}} his life, <b>then</b> <b>felled</b> by a relatively sudden illness. The former hypothesis held sway for most of the history of Mozart biography, but the latter has been advanced by contemporary scholars.|$|R
5|$|Hymaees {{went to the}} Propontis {{and took}} the city of Cius. After Daurises moves his forces towards Caria, Hymaees marched towards the Hellespont and {{captured}} many of the Aeolian cities {{as well as some}} of the cities in the Troad. However, he <b>then</b> <b>fell</b> ill and died, ending his campaign. Meanwhile, Otanes, together with Artaphernes, campaigned in Ionia (see below).|$|E
5|$|Reports on NBA jersey sales {{over the}} last three years (20062009) reveal that Kobe Bryant of the Los Angeles Lakers is the most sold jersey in China; however, Yao Ming fell from 6th to 10th and then back to 6th while his Houston Rockets {{teammate}} Tracy McGrady remained ranked third for two straight seasons <b>then</b> <b>fell</b> to fourth in 2009.|$|E
5|$|The Government {{amended the}} bill to delay debate for six months. As expected, the bill <b>then</b> <b>fell</b> when the Dáil was {{dissolved}} in the intervening period for the 2007 general election. Deputy Howlin said that {{the real reason for}} the delay was that the Government did not want to enact this type of social legislation {{in the face of an}} election.|$|E

5|$|The {{bill was}} seen as entirely {{innocuous}} when it was introduced on January 16, 1956. It enjoyed bipartisan support, and on January 18 it was passed unanimously by the House of Representatives. It <b>then</b> <b>fell</b> to the Senate to consider the equivalent bill in the upper chamber, S. 2518, which was expected to have an equally untroubled passage following hearings scheduled to begin on February 20.|$|E
5|$|After her {{commissioning}} on 1 May 1912, Oldenburg conducted {{sea trials}} in the Baltic. On 17 July, she {{was assigned to}} the I Battle Squadron of the High Seas Fleet, alongside her sisters. After individual ship training exercises, she joined I Squadron maneuvers and then fleet maneuvers in November. The annual summer cruise in July and August, which typically went to Norway, was interrupted by the Agadir Crisis. As a result, the cruise only went into the Baltic, {{in order to keep the}} fleet closer to Germany. Oldenburg and the rest of the fleet <b>then</b> <b>fell</b> into a pattern of individual ship, squadron, and full fleet exercises over the next two years of peace-time training.|$|E
5|$|Back at the front, Potemkin {{won more}} {{military}} acclaim, but <b>then</b> <b>fell</b> ill; rejecting medicine, he recovered only slowly. After {{a lull in}} hostilities in 1772 his movements are unclear, {{but it seems that}} he returned to St. Petersburg where he is recorded, perhaps apocryphally, to have been one of Catherine's closest advisers. Though Orlov was replaced as her favourite, it was not Potemkin who benefited. Alexander Vasilchikov, another Horse-Guardsman, replaced Orlov as the queen's lover. Potemkin returned to war in 1773 as Lieutenant-General to fight in Silistria. It appears that Catherine missed him, and that Potemkin took a December letter from her as a summons. In any case Potemkin returned to St. Petersburg as a war hero.|$|E
50|$|Currently, rubber {{plantation}} trees are generally harvested for wood after they complete the latex producing cycle, {{when they are}} 25 to 30 years old. When the latex yields become extremely low, the trees are <b>then</b> <b>felled,</b> and new trees are usually planted. This makes rubberwood 'eco-friendly' in that the wood is harvested from a renewable source.|$|R
50|$|In 2014, he {{appeared}} in Chikara's yearly King of Trios tournament as Team UK with Pete Dunne and Damian Dunne. The team defeated The Bloc Party in the first round, advancing to the quarter finals, where they were <b>then</b> <b>felled</b> by The Devastation Corporation. On the third night of the tournament, Andrews appeared in singles action, defeating Oliver Grimsly.|$|R
60|$|And <b>then</b> he <b>fell</b> back again, weak, and {{the breath}} going from him.|$|R
5|$|Clark's {{successor}} as MP, Stewart Jackson, was re-elected in 2010 with {{an increased}} majority, which <b>then</b> <b>fell</b> in 2015. The 2017 result {{marks the first time}} since 1929 that Peterborough has voted Labour in an election where the Conservatives won the national popular vote, and the first time it has ever elected a Labour MP in a year in which Labour did not form the government. Furthermore, Peterborough became one of five constituencies, the others being Croydon Central, Enfield Southgate, Leeds North West and Reading East, which elected Labour MPs in 2017 having not done so since 2001.|$|E
5|$|Harvard had cruised to a 91 {{record in}} conference play and <b>then</b> <b>fell</b> to 72 Princeton on March 1. The {{following}} night, Princeton defeated Dartmouth and Harvard lost to Penn to give Princeton {{the lead in}} the conference race. Harvard earned the Ivy League Championship with wins on March 8 and 9 over Columbia and Cornell to finish at 113 in conference as Princeton was swept on the same nights to Yale and Brown to fall to 94 in conference.|$|E
5|$|In 1897, Maryland faced Johns Hopkins for {{the first}} time since the Aggies' inaugural season. Hopkins beat Maryland handily, 30–6, and the Aggies went on to lose their next three games to finish the year with a 2–4 mark. The 1898 season saw the Aggies finish 2–5–1 and in 1899, the team {{canceled}} the remainder of its season after accumulating a 1–4 record. Maryland saw a marginal improvement to 3–4–1 in 1900, but <b>then</b> <b>fell</b> to a 1–7 season in 1901.|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> Tom <b>fell</b> in a tremble, for he {{knew his}} wickedness was discovered.|$|R

5|$|In the United States, {{the album}} debuted on the Billboard 200 at number 199 on {{the week of}} November 28, 1998. On January 16, 1999, the album rose into the top 100 on the chart for the first time, {{climbing}} 33 spots to number 79. The album reached its number 41 peak on February 13. The album remained at its peak the following week, <b>then</b> <b>fell</b> to number 51 on the Billboard 200 dated February 27. The album spent a total of 40 weeks on the chart, and placed at number 126 on the year-end Billboard 200 in 1998. It achieved Platinum status (1,000,000 copies sold) in the United States {{less than a year}} after its release.|$|E
5|$|On 18 March the PAVN {{had taken}} Phuoc An, {{eliminating}} {{any hope of}} reaching Buôn Ma Thuột. Darlac Province in its entirety <b>then</b> <b>fell</b> under North Vietnamese control. ARVN forces began to rapidly shift positions {{in an attempt to}} keep the North Vietnamese from quickly pushing eastward to the coastal lowlands. In the final analysis, the blame for the fall of the highlands lies with General Phú, who refused to act on sound intelligence and when he realized his error, {{it was too late to}} get reinforcements to the scene.|$|E
5|$|On May 28, Bonds passed Ruth, {{hitting his}} 715th career home run to center field off Colorado Rockies pitcher Byung-hyun Kim. The ball was hit an {{estimated}} 445feet (140m) into center field where {{it went through}} the hands of several fans but <b>then</b> <b>fell</b> onto an elevated platform in center field. Then it rolled off the platform where Andrew Morbitzer, a 38-year-old San Francisco resident, caught the ball {{while he was in}} line at a concession stand. Mysteriously, radio broadcaster Dave Flemming's radio play-by-play of the home run went silent just as the ball was hit, apparently from a microphone failure. But the televised version, called by Giants broadcaster Duane Kuiper, was not affected.|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> he <b>fell</b> {{forward on}} his face and when we lifted him he was dead.|$|R

5|$|Since {{deliveries}} {{began in}} January 2011, the i-MiEV became the best selling electric {{car in the}} country, and the 1000th i-MiEV was delivered in November 2011. A total of 2,240 electric cars were sold in Norway during 2011, of which, 1,050 were i-MiEVS, 210 were Citroën C-Zeros, and 217 Peugeot iOns, for combined sales of 1,477 units representing together a 66% share of all electric cars sold during the year. Registrations climbed to 1,670 units in 2012, <b>then</b> <b>fell</b> to 1,094 in 2013, and stabilized in 2014 with 1,093 units. Cumulative registrations through December 2014 reached 5,334 units, including 2,589 i-MiEVs, 1,352 C-Zeros, and 1,393 iOns.|$|E
5|$|The two bridges were {{captured}} during Operation Deadstick, a glider infantry assault by a reinforced company from the 2nd Battalion Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry. As part of Operation Tonga, the division's secondary objectives involved its two parachute brigades. The 5th Parachute Brigade provided a {{defence in depth}} for the captured bridges, deploying {{to the east and}} west of the canal and river. The 3rd Parachute Brigade destroyed the Merville gun battery along with the bridges crossing the Dives, <b>then</b> <b>fell</b> back to form a defensive line to the east of 5th Parachute Brigade.|$|E
5|$|Used by CharlesVII in the 15thcentury, the Château de Chinon {{became a}} {{prison in the}} second half of the 16thcentury, but <b>then</b> <b>fell</b> out of use and was left to decay. It has been {{recognised}} as a monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture since 1840. The castle, which contains a museum, is now owned and managed by the Indre-et-Loire General Council and is a major tourist attraction. In the early 21stcentury it was restored at a cost of 14.5million euros.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the film}} Alex Rider: Operation Stormbreaker, a guard in Sayle Tower, similar in build and {{appearance}} to Harold Sakata, throws his hat away {{as he prepares}} to kill Alex Rider. However, the guard is <b>then</b> <b>felled</b> simply by getting kicked very hard in his crotch (which Alex refers to as [...] "a schoolboy trick"); he is then kicked in the same place again by Sabina Pleasure.|$|R
