Some {{of the other}} items <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>found</b> <b>were</b> iron, pieces of smoking pipes, as well as beads. The beads <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>found</b> <b>were</b> common to find while the excavations were being done. [...] The beads were generally disc beads of freshwater shell, and then later in the deposits there were ivory beads and a glass beads as well, which are rare to find, <b>were</b> also <b>found.</b>|$|R

50|$|Peponidium is a genus of {{flowering}} {{plants in the}} Rubiaceae family. The genus is endemic to Madagascar, except for Peponidium ovato-oblongum and Peponidium venulosum <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>found</b> on the Comoros, and Peponidium carinatum and Peponidium celastroides <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>found</b> on the Seychelles.|$|R
5|$|Apatosaurus louisae {{was named}} by Holland in 1916, being first known from a partial {{skeleton}} <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>found</b> in Utah. The holotype is CM3018, with referred specimens including CM3378, CM11162, and LACM52844. The former two {{consist of a}} vertebral column; the latter two consist of a skull and a nearly complete skeleton, respectively. Apatosaurus louisae specimens all come from the late Kimmeridgian of Dinosaur National Monument. In 2015 Tschopp etal. found the type specimen of Apatosaurus laticollis to nest closely with CM3018, meaning the former is likely a junior synonym of A.louisae.|$|E
5|$|Stela 53 is a {{fragment}} of sculpture <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>found</b> in the latter Early Preclassic phase of Structure12, directly behind Stela 5. Stela53 forms {{a part of the}} Cargador del Ancestro sculpture. Stela5 was placed {{at the same time that}} Stela53 was embedded in Structure12, and the long count date on the former also allows the placing of Stela53 to be fixed in time at Late Preclassic–Early Classic transition.|$|E
5|$|Stela 74 is a {{fragment}} of Olmec-style sculpture <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>found</b> in the Middle Preclassic fill of Structure 7, where it was placed when that structure replaced the Pink Structure. It bears a foliated maize design topped with a U-symbol within a cartouche and has other, smaller, U-symbols at its base. It {{is very similar to}} a design found on Monument 25/26 from La Venta.|$|E

5|$|DDT was {{a widely}} used {{pesticide}} in agriculture <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>found</b> to have significant {{adverse effects on}} wildlife, particularly egg thinning and subsequent breakage in birds of prey. A review of DDT's impact on Australian raptors between 1947 and 1993 found that the average egg-shell thickness had decreased by 6%. This average level of thinning was not thought {{likely to result in}} significantly more breakage overall, however individual clutches that had been even thinner might have broken. The white-bellied sea eagle was one of the more affected species, probably due to its feeding in areas heavily treated with pesticide such as swamps. DDT use peaked in 1973, but was no longer approved after 1987 and its use had effectively ceased by 1989.|$|E

5|$|More of {{his later}} works are the Jewish {{community}} center in Duisburg (1996–1999), and with Rafi Segal, the Palmach Museum in Tel Aviv (1995–2000). The Duisburg Jewish community center {{is located on}} a park, the Garten der Erinnerung designed by Dani Karavan. The community center shares a similar concept to the Page Memorial in its likening to the open pages of a book, and symbolically the Torah of Moses. The Palmach Museum has an angular zig-zag plan positioned around the preservation of trees on the site. It is clad in a local sandstone <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>found</b> in excavations for the project. It was exhibited at the Venice Biennale.|$|E
5|$|Ranson {{suspected}} a suicide, but {{a thorough}} search of Newhaven Downs was judged impossible. A partial search was made, using tracker dogs, but all <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>found</b> were the skeletal {{remains of a}} judge who had disappeared years earlier. Police divers searched the harbour, and a partial search using infra-red photography was undertaken the following year, to no avail. A warrant for Lucan's arrest, to answer charges of murdering Sandra Rivett, and attempting to murder his wife, was issued on Tuesday 12November 1974. Descriptions of his appearance, already issued to police forces across the UK, were then issued to Interpol.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} {{then moved}} to Vaiden, Mississippi to film scenes set in the Carroll County Courthouse, where several courtroom scenes, as well as scenes set in Sheriff Ray Stuckey's office were filmed. The production moved to Vicksburg, Mississippi, where the crew filmed a funeral procession. On April 11, 1988, the crew filmed a scene set in the Cedar Hill Cemetery. From April 15 to April 16, the production moved to the Mississippi River valley to depict the FBI and United States Navy's search for the three civil rights workers. The art department recreated a Choctaw Indian Village on the location, based on old photographs. On April 23, the crew filmed a scene depicting a Citizens' Councils rally with 750 extras. On April 25, the crew returned to Jackson, Mississippi, where an unused building was to recreate a diner <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>found</b> in Alabama during location scouting. A day later, Hackman and Dafoe filmed their opening scene, in which the characters Anderson and Ward drive to Jessup County, Mississippi.|$|E

5|$|The stern section {{remained}} aground, but did {{not pose}} a significant oil spill threat as {{the majority of the}} oil on board had already leaked or burned. Some remaining oil <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>found</b> on board was skimmed or pumped out manually. In June 1999, Green Atlas awarded a ship breaking contract to Donjon Marine Co. and Fred Devine Diving and Salvage. Although the two companies were able to remove approximately one-third of the stern, their attempts to dismantle the largest section or tow it to sea were unsuccessful and had to be abandoned over the winter. However, work did not resume in the spring of 2000, and in 2001, a salvage expert hired by Green Atlas claimed the stern should not be removed because it would create a dangerous work environment. The state later accused Green Atlas of sabotaging the stern removal effort in order to save money; a protracted legal battle ensued.|$|E
5|$|This {{evidence}} that giant reptiles had lived on Earth {{in the past}} caused great excitement in scientific circles, and even among some segments of the general public. Buckland did describe the jaw of a small primitive mammal, Phascolotherium, <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>found</b> in the same strata as Megalosaurus. This discovery, known as the Stonesfield mammal, was a much discussed anomaly. Cuvier at first {{thought it was a}} marsupial, but Buckland later realized it was a primitive placental mammal. Due to its small size and primitive nature, Buckland did not believe it invalidated the overall pattern of an age of reptiles, when the largest and most conspicuous animals had been reptiles rather than mammals.|$|E
5|$|Thorium {{was first}} {{observed}} to be radioactive in 1898, by the German chemist Gerhard Carl Schmidt and later that year, independently, by the Polish-French physicist Marie Curie. It {{was the second}} element <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>found</b> to be radioactive, after the 1896 discovery of radioactivity in uranium by French physicist Henri Becquerel. Between 1900 and 1903, British physicists Ernest Rutherford and Frederick Soddy showed how thorium decayed at a fixed rate over time {{into a series of}} other elements. This observation led to the identification of the half-life as one of the outcomes of the alpha particle experiments that led to their disintegration theory of radioactivity. The biological effect of radiation was discovered in 1903. The newly discovered phenomenon of radioactivity excited scientists and the general public alike. In the 1920s, thorium's radioactivity was promoted as a cure for rheumatism, diabetes, and sexual impotence. In 1932, most of these uses were banned in the United States after a federal investigation into the health effects of radioactivity. Public interest in radioactivity had declined {{by the end of the}} 1930s.|$|E

5|$|Uranium-235 was {{the first}} isotope <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>found</b> to be fissile. Other {{naturally}} occurring isotopes are fissionable, but not fissile. On bombardment with slow neutrons, its uranium-235 isotope will {{most of the time}} divide into two smaller nuclei, releasing nuclear binding energy and more neutrons. If too many of these neutrons are absorbed by other uranium-235 nuclei, a nuclear chain reaction occurs that results in a burst of heat or (in special circumstances) an explosion. In a nuclear reactor, such a chain reaction is slowed and controlled by a neutron poison, absorbing some of the free neutrons. Such neutron absorbent materials are often part of reactor control rods (see nuclear reactor physics for a description of this process of reactor control).|$|E
5|$|Proposed in 1987 by Brinkman and Sues, Herrerasaurus has {{at times}} been {{considered}} basal to Ornithischia and Saurischia, although Brinkmann and Sues still considered {{it to be}} inside Dinosauria. They supported this {{on the basis that}} Herrerasaurus has a large pedal digit V, and has a well developed medial wall on the acetabulum. Brinkmann and Sues considered Staurikosaurus and Herrerasaurus to not form a true group called Herrerasauridae, and that instead they were successively more primitive forms. Also, they considered the characters used by Benedetto to be invalid, instead representing only the plesiomorphic state <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>found</b> in both taxa. This was disagreed with in 1992 by Novas, who stated many derived synapomorphies of Herrerasauridae, such as a distinct pubic boot, but still classified them as basal to Ornithischia and Saurischia. Novas defined the family as the least common ancestor of Herrerasaurus and Staurikosaurus and all its descendants. A differing definition of Herrerasaurus but not Passer domesticus first suggested by Sereno (1998), and more closely follows the original inclusion proposed by Benedetto. Another group, Herrerasauria was named by Galton in 1985, and defined as Herrerasaurus but not Liliensternus or Plateosaurus by Langer (2004), who used the node-based definition for Herrerasauridae.|$|E
5|$|Stela 39 is {{the broken}} {{bottom half of}} a stela <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>found</b> inside Temple 5D-86, on the east-west axis running through the East Platform from the Lost World Pyramid. The {{monument}} is sculpted {{on the front and}} back faces and was deliberately broken in ancient times and was moved inside the temple in order to save it. The front of the stela shows the bottom half of a person, who is identified as a ruler by his costume; the back features two columns of hieroglyphs. The king depicted on the stela is ChakTokIch'aakI, who governed in the 4th century AD. This king is standing over a bound captive; the bearded captive appears to be a noble since he retains his clothing. The stela celebrates an event in AD 376 and appears to have been moved to the Mundo Perdido in relation to a funerary ceremony. The stela was possibly moved to the temple by king YaxNuunAyiinII to celebrate the changing of the 20-year k'atun Maya calendrical cycle in AD 771 and thereby link himself to ChakTokIch'aakI. It was placed directly over the most important of the late 4th century elite tombs. The stela continued to be worshipped in the Terminal Classic, as evidenced by the presence of polychrome ceramic offerings and incense burners.|$|E
