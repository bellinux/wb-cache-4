60|$|After {{a glance}} at <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> opposite, he went into Number Four. The sound of the closing door was heard, {{the sound of the}} turning lock {{followed}} it. Then the dead silence fell over the house once more.|$|E

The GPS calculated positions would quickly drift into error, accumulating to 10 kilometers per day. This was corrected for in the design of GPS.|$|R

60|$|Nothing {{moved in}} the parlour till Mrs Verloc raised her head slowly {{and looked at the}} clock with inquiring mistrust. She had become aware of a ticking sound in the room. It grew upon her ear, while she remembered clearly that <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> was silent, had no audible tick. What did it mean by {{beginning}} to tick so loudly all of a sudden? Its face indicated ten minutes to nine. Mrs Verloc cared nothing for time, and the ticking went on. She concluded it could not be the clock, and her sullen gaze moved along the walls, wavered, and became vague, while she strained her hearing to locate the sound. Tic, tic, tic.|$|E
6000|$|Wilson {{stopped and}} stood silent. Inattention dies {{a quick and}} sure death when a speaker does that. The stillness gives warning that {{something}} is coming. All palms and finger balls went down now, all slouching forms straightened, all heads came up, all eyes were fastened upon Wilson's face. He waited yet one, two, three moments, to let his pause complete and perfect its spell upon the house; then, when through the profound hush {{he could hear the}} ticking of <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> he put out his hand and took the Indian knife by the blade and held it aloft where all could see the sinister spots upon its ivory handle; then he said, in a level and passionless voice: ...|$|E

6000|$|Mrs. Roberts, with rapturous {{admiration of}} him: [...] "Well, Edward, {{you have got}} a brain! I declare, the cook had utterly gone out of my mind. Forgetting that plush bag makes me forget everything. I've got a splendid one--a perfect treasure. She won't do any of the wash, and we'll have to put that out; and she's been used to having a kitchen-maid; but she said we were such a small family that she could shell the pease herself. She's the most respectable-looking old thing you ever saw; and she's been having ten dollars a week from the last family she was in; but she'll come the summer with us for six. I was very {{fortunate}} to get her; all the good girls are snapped up for the sea-side in May, and they won't go into the country for love or money. It was the greatest chance! She's such a neat, quiet, lady-like person, and all the better for being Irish and a Catholic: Catholics do give so much more of a flavor; and I never could associate that Nova Scotia, sunken-cheeked leanness of Maria's with a cook. This one's name is--well, I forget what her name is; Bridget, or Norah, or something like that--and she's a perfect little butter-ball. She's coming {{to go out on the}} same train with us; and she'll get the dinner to-night; and I sha'n't have the mortification of sitting down to a pickup meal with Amy Campbell, the first time she has visited us; she's conceited enough about her house-keeping as it is, I'm sure, and I wouldn't have her patronizing and pitying me for worlds. The cook will be here at half-past three precisely; I had to pretend the train started a little earlier than it does so as to make her punctual; they are such uncertain things! and I don't suppose I shall be back by that time, quite, Edward, and so you must receive her. Let me see!" [...] She glances up at <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall.</b> [...] "It's just quarter-past now, and our train goes at ten minutes to four--My goodness! I'll have to hurry." ...|$|E

5000|$|Zeppo, as usual, plays, {{according}} to James Agee, [...] "a peerlessly cheesy improvement {{on the traditional}} straight man", in his final on-screen appearance with his Brothers. He sings with the group (including soloing the first few lines of the first song, [...] "When <b>the</b> <b>Clock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wall</b> Strikes 10"). He also sings with the others in [...] "Freedonia's Going to War", filling out the four-cornered symmetry as the Brothers sing and dance in pairs during the number.|$|E
50|$|In the meantime, Griffiths had {{continued}} to write for the theatre with Comedians commissioned by the Nottingham Playhouse. The premiere production of the play was directed by Richard Eyre, then {{artistic director of the}} Nottingham theatre, and was first performed on 20 February 1975. Comedians is set in a Manchester night-school, where a group of budding comics gather for a final briefing before performing to an agent from London. The play is set in real time, i.e. as the real time is 7.27, <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> of the school room also says 7.27. It subsequently transferred to Broadway, and was later adapted for television by Eyre while he was responsible for Play for Today.|$|E

5000|$|The [...] "Freedonia National Anthem" [...] is used {{frequently}} {{throughout the}} film, both as vocal and instrumental; the entire song seems {{to consist of}} [...] "Hail, Hail, Freedonia, land of the brave and free", contrasting with the final line of The Star-Spangled Banner. The [...] "Sylvania theme", which sounds vaguely like [...] "Rule, Britannia!", is also used several times. [...] "When <b>The</b> <b>Clock</b> <b>On</b> <b>The</b> <b>Wall</b> Strikes 10", the first musical number in the film, {{is part of the}} same scene as [...] "Just Wait 'Til I Get Through With It", Groucho's song about the laws of his administration. [...] "This Country's Going To War" [...] is the final musical ensemble in the film, and is also the only musical number in the Marx Brothers' films to feature all four of the Brothers.|$|E
5000|$|James {{exhibits}} {{a knack for}} popular expression that Peirce seldom sought, and here his analysis of correspondence {{by way of a}} simple thought experiment cuts right to the quick of the first major question to ask about it, namely: To what extent is the notion of correspondence involved in truth covered by the ideas of analogues, copies, or iconic images of the thing represented? The answer is that the iconic aspect of correspondence can be taken literally only in regard to sensory experiences of the more precisely eidetic sort. When it comes to the kind of correspondence that might be said to exist between a symbol, a word like [...] "works", and its object, the springs and catches of <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> then the pragmatist recognizes that a more than nominal account of the matter still has a lot more explaining to do.|$|E
5000|$|Silent Light {{begins with}} a long {{tracking}} shot of the sun rising over a beautiful plain. The protagonist Johan, his wife Esther, and their children sit silently saying grace, after which each member of Johan's family departs from their home except for him. Once he is alone, he stops <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> and breaks down crying. Johan goes to work and discusses with a colleague that he is {{having an affair with}} a single woman by the name of Marianne; he makes it clear that his wife knows about the affair. Johan leaves work to meet Marianne in a field, and they begin to kiss. In the next scene, Johan's children are bathing and playing along a riverbank while he and his wife watch. They call one of their children over to bathe her, and as they are doing so, Esther begins to cry.|$|E

50|$|The film {{starts with}} a scene of a sitting room, empty of people, at some two minutes to 7 oclock in the morning, and ends with a scene of the same empty room at some two minutes past 7 oclock {{in the morning of}} some weeks later; this passage of time is {{accurately}} depicted by the brightness of the natural light that is reflected on the wall of a corridor, that leads to this sitting room, in the initial and final scenes. The meticulous attention that Taghvāi has given to the accurate representation of even the most mundane aspects of the film would at first sight seem to be at odds with the fact that {{with the exception of the}} opening and closing scenes, in all other scenes where <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> of the sitting room is in sight, its pendulum is conspicuously motionless. The opening scene depicts some moments before the family starts a very active day (the day at which the two children of the family, Shangul and Mangul, have their first school-day after the summer school-holiday) and the closing scene, the end of a protracted Friday night, during which Jahāngir and Royā have spent an intellectually and emotionally exhausting night. The motionless pendulum suggests that the events in the intervening period have taken place out of time, or only in imagination. Although the work presented by Taghvāi certainly qualifies as a surrealist art-form, this motionless pendulum serves as a more profound tool than a means that solely hints at surrealism. Taghvāi conveys a number of unobtrusive verbal and visual messages to his viewers. Briefly, Taghvāi and Ms Minoo Farshchi, the co-author of the film script, variously refer to the theory of eternal recurrence, as revived by e.g. Friedrich Nietzsche, with a strong emphasis on the importance of having a creative mind thereby to forge room for free will in at least an imaginative world.|$|E
