40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this study was to analyze the {{research}} literature on <b>three-tier</b> <b>models</b> of reading and behavior and to provide a descriptive analysis and meta-analytic review of these models. An in-depth review of 17 articles was conducted on the similarities and differences between and among <b>three-tier</b> <b>models</b> of reading (n = 5), models of behavior (n = 7), and inte-grated models (combining reading and behavior; n = 5). Descriptive analyses were conducted across three areas: student populations, intervention level, and setting. Finally, a meta-analytic review was completed of 11 of the 17 investigations. Scientific evidence shows that one or more levels of these <b>three-tier</b> <b>models</b> leads to improved reading or behavior performance; however, there is a paucity of research detailing the integration of three-tier reading and behavior models. Limitations and directions for future research are discussed...|$|R

2500|$|That is, {{material}} artifacts {{were the}} material residue of culture, but not culture itself. [...] Taylor's {{point was that}} the archaeological record could contribute to anthropological knowledge, but only if archaeologists reconceived their work not just as digging up artifacts and recording their location in time and space, but as inferring from material remains the behaviors through which they were produced and used, and inferring from these behaviors the mental activities of people. [...] Although many archaeologists agreed that their research was integral to anthropology, Taylor's program was never fully implemented. [...] One reason was that his <b>three-tier</b> <b>model</b> of inferences required too much fieldwork and laboratory analysis to be practical. [...] Moreover, his view that material remains were not themselves cultural, and in fact twice-removed from culture, in fact left archaeology marginal to cultural anthropology.|$|E
2500|$|By 1782, Catherine {{arranged}} another {{advisory commission}} {{to study the}} information gathered about the educational systems of many different countries. A system produced by a mathematician, Franz Aepinus, stood out in particular. He was strongly in favour of {{the adoption of the}} Austrian <b>three-tier</b> <b>model</b> of trivial, real, and normal schools at village, town, and provincial capital levels. In addition to the advisory commission, Catherine established a Commission of National Schools under Pyotr Zavadovsky. This commission was charged with organising a national school network, training the teachers, and providing the textbooks. On 5 August 1786, the Russian Statute of National Education was promulgated. The statute established a two-tier network of high schools and primary schools in guberniya capitals that were free of charge, open to all of the free classes (not serfs), and co-educational. It also regulated, in detail, the subjects to be taught at every age and the method of teaching. In addition to the textbooks translated by the commission, teachers were provided with the [...] "Guide to Teachers". This work, divided into four parts, dealt with teaching methods, the subjects taught, the behaviour of the teacher, and the running of a school.|$|E

We find support for the <b>three‐tier</b> agency <b>model.</b> The presence of significant shareholders on the compensation committee (i. e., those with share stakes in excess of 5 percent) is associated with lower CEO pay and higher CEO equity incentives. Firms with higher paid compensation committee members are associated with greater CEO compensation and lower incentives. The managerial power model receives little support.

5000|$|Traditional network {{architectures}} {{employ a}} <b>three-tier</b> <b>model.</b> This hierarchical model builds in redundancy {{at the core}} and aggregation layers. This model uses the Spanning Tree Protocol, which determines one path of transport on the network from one point to another. All other paths are closed off. This model is best suited for users inside the firewall accessing applications where network utilization of those applications is generally low. Server utilization is also generally low. This model best serves applications that have permanent homes on physical servers. The problems of a <b>three-tier</b> <b>model</b> include network redundancy, lag and data loss. This model is also inefficient for virtualized environments that require multiple non-blocked connections between servers.|$|E

Moreover, this functionality can move to the most appropriate network host, as needed, on demand. In this paper, we investigate the suitability of mobile agent technology for distributed computing applications.

40|$|We build a {{theoretical}} model {{to examine how}} supervision (auditing) can be utilized to enhance the efficiency of corporate governance and how collusive supervision (auditing) can be deterred. We introduce the outcomes of “Monotone Comparative Statics ” ala Topkis (1978) and Edlin and Shannon (1998), and Milgrom and Segal (2002) ’s generalized envelope theorem, and construct a <b>three-tier</b> agency <b>model</b> with a mathematically tractable structure. This should be an advantage in modeling {{in comparison with the}} collusion literature e. g., Kofman and Lawarree (1993) ’s auditing application of the <b>three-tier</b> agency <b>model</b> ala Tirole (1986, 1992). The basic trade-off involved in adding the auditor (supervisor) into the hierarchy is the benefit from the discrete reduction in information rent and the improvement of marginal incentives (outputs) versus the resource cost of the auditor (supervisor), and this bottom line is consistently preserved through the extension and generalization of the model. In addition to the theoretical (mainly technical) investigation, the paper also derives some clear and robust implication applicable to corporate governance reform...|$|R

30|$|Similar to all {{business}} models, one entity could play several business roles {{at the same}} time. For instance a VIP could also {{play the role of}} a SP (i.e. offering both virtual topologies and value added services to end users). This situation would result in a two-tier architecture, encompassing two hierarchical levels (i.e. the physical network level and one virtual network level). While such model involves less interactions, it lacks the flexibility, openness, and role specialization achieved by the <b>three-tier</b> architectural <b>model.</b> In fact, maintaining the VIP as a separate entity offers the level of abstraction and separation between PIPs and SPs required to build virtual networks that are customized for particular service and user requirements. Furthermore, using a VIP as intermediary role simplifies the negotiation and virtual resource allocation process, in cases involving multiple SPs and multiple PIPs [10]. This process becomes much more complex when those SPs are directly interacting with multiple PIPs, in a fully distributed fashion (i.e. forming a full mesh topology). For the rest of this paper, we assume that each role is played by a separate entity, and focus on the <b>three-tier</b> hierarchical <b>model</b> which is described below.|$|R
40|$|An {{innovative}} {{configuration of}} pocket-type rockfall protective cable-net structure, known as Long-span Pocket-type Rock-net (LPR), {{has been developed}} in Japan. The global performance of the proposed system was initially checked by the experimental (full-scale) modelling. Given the various limitations of the physical experiments, particularly for the parametric study to have a detailed understanding of the newly developed system, a reliable and simplified method of numerical modelling is felt necessary. Again, given the sophistication involved with the method of numerical simulation, a yet simplified modelling approach may prove more effective. On top of this background, this paper presents a <b>three-tier</b> <b>modelling</b> of a design of LPR. After physical modelling, which has revealed that the displacement response may be taken more vital for LPR performance, Finite Element based numerical modelling is presented. The programme LS-DYNA is used and the models are calibrated and verified with the element- and structure-level experiments. Finally, a simple analytical modelling consisting of the equivalently linear and elastic, lumped-mass, single-degree-of-freedom system, capable of predicting the global displacement response, is proposed based on {{the basic principles of}} conservation of linear momentum and energy. The model is back-calculated and modified from the analyses of the verified numerical model...|$|R
