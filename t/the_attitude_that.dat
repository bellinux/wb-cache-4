5|$|The scandal fuelled <b>the</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>that</b> male {{homosexuality}} was {{an aristocratic}} vice that corrupted lower-class youths. Such perceptions were still prevalent in 1895 when the Marquess of Queensberry accused Oscar Wilde {{of being an}} active homosexual.|$|E

25|$|Most {{policies}} and practices, including {{the construction of}} Antarctic organizations were created initially by men. Women were originally excluded from early exploration in Antarctica based on <b>the</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>that</b> women could not handle the extremes in temperature or crisis situations. Vivian Fuchs, {{who was in charge}} of the British Antarctic Survey in the 1960s believed that women couldn't carry heavy equipment and that Antarctic facilities were unsuitable for women. The United States believed for many years that the climate of Antarctic was too harsh for women.|$|E

Many of the new technological innovations {{in the modern world}} were either first invented in the United States and/or first widely adopted by Americans. Examples include: the lightbulb, the airplane, the transistor, nuclear power, the personal computer, video games and online shopping, as well as the development of the Internet.

Now animated shorts had sound which in turn brought a new enthusiasm and a need for talented animators. Paul Terry offered Bill a job right away. There he met animator Art Babbitt who became his close friend and roommate. Art eventually left to work for Walt Disney because of the challenging work and good working conditions. For two years Art tried to entice Bill {{to come out to}} Hollywood, but Bill did not want to leave his family and a well paying job during the Great Depression. Finally in 1934 Tytla flew to Hollywood. He was very impressed and accepted the job even at a lower salary than he was being paid at Terrytoons.|$|E
25|$|Othering is {{the process}} by which a person or a group is placed outside of the norm, into the margins. It is a system of {{discrimination}} whereby the characteristics of a group are used to distinguish them as separate from the norm. Othering plays a fundamental role in the history and continuance of racism and other forms of discrimination. For example, by objectifying culture as something different, exotic or underdeveloped is to generalise {{that it is not the}} same as 'normal' society. Europe's colonial attitude towards the Orient exemplifies through <b>the</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>that</b> the East was the opposite of the West; feminine where the West was masculine, weak where the West was strong and traditional where the West was progressive. By making these generalisations and othering the East, Europe was simultaneously defining herself as the norm, further entrenching the perceived gap. Much of the process of othering relies on imagined difference, or the expectation of difference. Spatial difference can be enough to conclude that 'we' are 'here' and the 'others' are over 'there', making 'here' normal and 'there' foreign. Imagined differences serve to categorise people into groups and assign them characteristics that suit the imaginer's expectations and desires.|$|E

500|$|Hunt {{approached}} the recording sessions differently than on his previous records. Rather than guiding personnel through replicating his demos for the album, he allowed {{members of his}} backing band to improvise their parts. For most songs, Hunt recorded with drummer Ruth Price, percussionist and engineer Melissa Mattey, and keyboardist and programmer Peter Dyer. Price and Dyer had auditioned {{for him at the}} Musicians Institute in Hollywood and had previously toured with Hunt. He rehearsed with Price for approximately two weeks before recording the final tracks in order to adjust to more rock-based dynamics, including a different set of tempos, chord changes, and faster time cadences, that he wanted for the songs. Price was adept in playing both loose and tight drumming styles for certain songs. Hunt and his band were inspired by recording artists Curtis Mayfield and Iggy Pop, who he said [...] "brought this kind of intelligence along with the rawness. It was really bold. They just didn't give a shit. I was like, that's <b>the</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>that</b> I'm feeling right now. I feel like I've finally shed the music that I grew up with." ...|$|E

500|$|The Confessions Tour {{received}} positive critical response. Steve Baltin of Rolling Stone wrote: [...] "Madonna {{had played}} many {{roles in the}} first night of her Confessions tour – but confessor was not one of them. Apparently, in all the pomp and circumstance, {{there was no room for}} warmth, or even <b>the</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>that</b> made her recent Coachella festival performance so memorable." [...] Don Chareunsy of The San Diego Union-Tribune commented that Madonna's previous tours, Drowned World Tour (2001) and Re-Invention World Tour (2004), [...] "were excellent concerts... but she stepped it up a few notches" [...] for the Confessions Tour. Ben Wener of The Orange County Register reported that [...] "No one – but no one – stages elaborate eye-candy productions like Madonna, whose highly impressive Confessions Tour opened Sunday night at a packed Forum so sweltering it seemed as though it were being prepped for the world's largest Bikram yoga session." [...] Lina Das from the Daily Mail complimented the show, saying that Madonna still had the ability to grab the headlines with her shock tactics. Thomas Inskeep from Stylus Magazine complimented the finale of the tour saying, [...] "There's not a better way the Confessions Tour could’ve closed." [...] Tom Young from the BBC called the show [...] "a big fat neon light of a pop-dance explosion. There's a party going on, and unless you were there in the first place, you’re not invited. Whistles and whoops rarely cease and applause ripples throughout building into regular raptures for a consistently first-class performer. It's almost enough to make those who weren’t there jealous. Almost." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1997, writer Ivan Velez, Jr., who had {{previously}} written for the adult underground Gay Comix, reintroduced Jennifer Kale with a closely cropped [...] "butch" [...] haircut {{in the pages of}} Ghost Rider, portrayed her as related to both Johnny Blaze and Daniel Ketch, and said that an issue of Howard the Duck had shown Jennifer and Doctor Strange as those who initially brought Howard to Earth-616 (no such issue of Howard the Duck exists, and Jennifer and Doctor Strange did not meet until Man-Thing (vol. 2) #4 (May 1980)), after Howard's series had concluded). In issue #92 (January 1998), he depicted Ketch having a vision of life without Ghost Rider in which Jennifer had been in a relationship with a woman, Marie, for three years. Jennifer's first boyfriend, Jaxon, was shown in Fear #13 (April 1973) and #18 (November 1973) and Man-Thing (vol. 2) #4 (May 1980), by which point they had broken up over Jennifer's sorcery. She was shown sharing a bed with a chubby boyfriend named Bernard Drabble in The Legion of Night (October 1991), which was written by her creator, Steve Gerber (later writer of the GLAAD Award-nominated Hard Time), who thought making her related to both Ghost Riders was bad writing, saying that Marvel should change its name to DC for [...] "Deliverance Comics" [...] for being so inbred (he did not read the issues in question, nor was he told of Jennifer's newfound lesbianism). In Witches, Brian Patrick Walsh presents her with <b>the</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>that</b> having slept with women makes her a [...] "bad girl" [...] as a direct character foil to Topaz as a [...] "good girl" [...] (which does not match earlier portrayals of Topaz), and Satana as [...] "the ugly." [...] In Marvel Zombies 4, Topaz teasingly calls Jennifer [...] "girlfriend" [...] to be ironic. Her entry in the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe now states that she is bisexual.|$|E

2500|$|Blasted was {{fiercely}} {{attacked in}} the British press. The Daily Mail drama critic Jack Tinker wrote a review headlined [...] "this disgusting feast of filth". This reaction was shared, if in slightly more muted terms, by most other critics. Blasted was, however, praised by fellow playwrights Martin Crimp, Harold Pinter (who became a friend), Caryl Churchill, who considered it [...] "rather a tender play". It was later {{seen to be}} making parallels between domestic violence {{and the war in}} Bosnia, and between emotional and physical violence. Kane said, [...] "The logical conclusion of <b>the</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>that</b> produces an isolated rape in England is the rape camps in Bosnia and the logical conclusion to the way society expects men to behave is war." ...|$|E
2500|$|One {{hypothesis}} on how {{attitudes are}} formed, first advanced by Abraham Tesser in 1983, is that strong {{likes and dislikes}} are rooted in our genetic make-up. [...] Tesser speculates that individuals are disposed to hold certain strong attitudes {{as a result of}} inborn physical, sensory, and cognitive skills, temperament, and personality traits. Whatever disposition nature elects to give us, our most treasured attitudes are often formed as a result of exposure to attitude objects; our history of rewards and punishments; <b>the</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>that</b> our parents, friends, and enemies express; the social and cultural context in which we live; and other types of experiences we have. Obviously, attitudes are formed through the basic process of learning. Numerous studies have shown that people can form strong positive and negative attitudes toward neutral objects that are in some way linked to emotionally charged stimuli.|$|E
2500|$|Remington Rand also hired {{very large}} numbers of private {{security}} forces to protect its property and attempt to re-open some facilities.

One company which provided private security forces, led by Pearl Bergoff, received $25,850. Remington Rand claimed it had to hire its own private police forces to protect its property and the strikebreakers.

40|$|The diploma thesis {{focuses on}} the topic of the current state of {{professional}} library organisations in the Czech republic and <b>the</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> beginning as well as experienced librarians have towards them. The thesis analyses the importance of professional organisations and further analyses each Czech organisation of this type, with emphasis on the current array of professional education opportunities they offer. The core of the thesis lies in a survey examining <b>the</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>that</b> librarians have towards this type of organisations. The survey consisted of three parts: it was carried out among students of librarianship and informations sciences, among current members of professional library organisations which have an option of an individual membership, and among potential members of these organisations from the ranks of experienced librarians. Based on the analyses of the individual professional organisations and the results of the survey, the thesis also presents several development concept proposals which touch upon areas these organisations should further develop in the future.
