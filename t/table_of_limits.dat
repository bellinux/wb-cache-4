FINDINGS The hearing threshold levels of sonar technicians were higher (worse) thin the International Standards Organization (ISO) norms, {{which are based on}} people with no history of noise exposure or otologic disease. The audiometric configuration was consistent with noise exposure. Nevertheless, the hearing levels of most sonar technicians are adequate to perform their job.

The statistical analysis is performed {{under the assumption that}} some variables are weakly exogenous with respect to the (multi-) cointegration parameters, a condition that corresponds to no integral and proportional feedback in the marginal system (NF). The specification of the deterministic components is chosen so as to allow for a linear trend in all possible directions. The asymptotic distribution is derived both under correct specification of the weak exogeneity assumptions and under mis-specification. <b>Tables</b> <b>of</b> <b>limit</b> distributions are obtained by simulation.

We analyzed performance of scaling relations between one of the frequently used early warning parameters, so-called characteristic period τC and moment magnitude MW in respect of (a) characteristics of datasets accumulated in various regions (earthquake depth, characteristics of network) and (b) variation of initial conditions applying for determination of the parameter τC (length of Pwave window, number of used stations). The used data contain strong-motion records from 110 earthquakes (moment magnitude range 4.4 – 7.6) occurred in Japan and Taiwan. We show that, although the standard error of regression τC = f (MW) in general becomes smaller {{with the increase of}} the length of P-wave window (PL) and the number (N) of averaged observations (stations), the uncertainty in estimation of MW given observed tC does not decrease further for PL > 3 – 4 seconds and N > 3 – 4 stations.

Design, setting, participants & measurements: The authors used special <b>tables</b> <b>of</b> reproducibility <b>limits</b> for each score level to study, by multislice computed tomography and biochemistries, the 2 -year changes in CAC in 41 transplant patients (age 48 +/- 13 yr, 25 men, dialysis vintage 4. 8 +/- 4. 3 yr, underwent transplant 6. 2 +/- 5. 5 yr prior). Thirty balanced dialysis patients served as controls. Results: In the study group, Agatston score was stable, and C-reactive protein decreased, whereas fetuin and osteoprotegerin increased. In the control group, Agatston score increased, parathyroid hormone and phosphate decreased, and inflammation markers were persistently {{twice as high as}} in the study group. With regard to individual changes, 12. 2 % transplant patients worsened, compared with 56. 6 % of patients in dialysis (P < 0. 0001.). Patients without calcification at entry showed slower progression in transplantation (8. 3 %) than in dialysis (44. 4 %; P < 0. 034), and the difference was similar to that observed in cases with CAC (17. 6 % versus 61. 9 %; P < 0. 007).

CPT INVARIANCE General principles of relativistic field theory require invariance under the combined transformation CPT. The simplest tests of CPT invariance are the equality of the masses and lifetimes of a particle and its antiparticle. The best test comes from the limit on the mass difference between K 0 and K 0 Any such difference contributes to the CP-violating parameter. Assuming CPT invariance, φ, the phase of should be very close to 44 ◦. (See the review “CP Violation in KL decay ” in this edition.) In contrast, if the entire source of CP violation in K 0 decays were a K 0 −K 0 mass difference, φ would be 44 ◦ + 90 ◦.
