40|$|Deciding when <b>to</b> return <b>to</b> <b>sport</b> after {{injury is}} complex and multifactorial-an {{exercise}} in risk management. Return <b>to</b> <b>sport</b> decisions are made every day by clinicians, athletes and coaches, ideally in a collaborative way. The purpose of this consensus statement was to present and synthesise current evidence to make recommendations for return <b>to</b> <b>sport</b> decision-making, clinical practice and future research directions related to returning athletes <b>to</b> <b>sport.</b> A half day meeting was held in Bern, Switzerland, after the First World Congress in Sports Physical Therapy. 17 expert clinicians participated. 4 main sections were initially agreed upon, then participants elected to join 1 of the 4 groups-each group focused on 1 section of the consensus statement. Participants in each group discussed and summarised the key issues for their section before the 17 -member group met again for discussion to reach consensus {{on the content of}} the 4 sections. Return <b>to</b> <b>sport</b> is not a decision taken in isolation {{at the end of the}} recovery and rehabilitation process. Instead, return <b>to</b> <b>sport</b> should be viewed as a continuum, paralleled with recovery and rehabilitation. Biopsychosocial models may help the clinician make sense of individual factors that may influence the athlete's return <b>to</b> <b>sport,</b> and the Strategic Assessment of Risk and Risk Tolerance framework may help decision-makers synthesise information to make an optimal return <b>to</b> <b>sport</b> decision. Research evidence to support return <b>to</b> <b>sport</b> decisions in clinical practice is scarce. Future research should focus on a standardised approach to defining, measuring and reporting return <b>to</b> <b>sport</b> outcomes, and identifying valuable prognostic factors for returning <b>to</b> <b>sport...</b>|$|R
40|$|Impairment-based {{evaluation}} has, until recently, {{been the}} mainstay of orthopaedic research in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. However, participation-based outcomes, in particular returning <b>to</b> <b>sport,</b> have lately garnered increased research attention. This is important because returning <b>to</b> <b>sport</b> is typically a main concern of injured athletes. Recent metaanalyses have demonstrated that the return <b>to</b> <b>sport</b> rate after ACL reconstruction is disappointingly low, and that a range of contextual factors including age, sex, sport participation level, and psychological factors may affect the return <b>to</b> <b>sport</b> rate. Moderate <b>to</b> large effect sizes have been demonstrated for greater psychological readiness <b>to</b> return <b>to</b> <b>sport,</b> and lower fear of reinjury favoring returning to the preinjury level sport after ACL reconstruction. Understanding the relationship between psychological factors and returning <b>to</b> <b>sport</b> is essential {{in light of the}} fact that most athletes recover good physical function after surgery, and many athletes with good knee function do not return <b>to</b> <b>sport.</b> Psychological factors are potentially modifiable with appropriate intervention, yet these factors are not systematically addressed in routine postoperative rehabilitation. This review summarizes the recent evidence for the relationship between psychological factors and ACL injury, including recovery from injury and returning <b>to</b> <b>sport.</b> Oper Tech Sports Med 24 : 77 - 83 Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Inc.

30|$|A {{review of}} return <b>to</b> <b>sport</b> rates that {{focussed}} on younger patients aged 6 to 19  years was recently conducted [7] and included 20 studies on 1156 patients. Ninety-two percent returned {{to some kind}} of <b>sport,</b> 79 % <b>to</b> pre-injury <b>sport</b> and 81 % <b>to</b> competitive <b>sport.</b> Return <b>to</b> <b>sport</b> rates are therefore notably higher for younger athletes and this has implications for reinjury which will be later discussed.|$|R
30|$|In conclusion, {{the rates}} of return <b>to</b> <b>sport</b> {{following}} ACL reconstruction are often less than might be expected and many factors influence a return to play. Younger athletes have high return <b>to</b> <b>sport</b> rates and higher rates of further ACL injury. There are currently no validated guidelines for knowing when {{it is safe to}} return. There is some utility in return <b>to</b> <b>sport</b> criteria, and they can be used to provide the patient with feedback with regard to their rehabilitation progress. However their overall application when it comes to clearing an athlete <b>to</b> return <b>to</b> <b>sport</b> in clinical practice is unclear due to a high level of uncertainly as to their validity regarding the risk for subsequent injury. Ultimately it must be recognised that any return <b>to</b> <b>sport</b> is associated with a risk of further injury and potentially the development of osteoarthritis.|$|R

5|$|A 2004 {{article in}} USA Today {{suggested}} that playing Magic might help improve {{the social and}} mental skills {{of some of the}} players. The article interviewed players' parents who believe that the game, similar <b>to</b> <b>sports,</b> teaches children how to more gracefully win and lose. Magic also contains a great amount of strategy and vocabulary that children may not be exposed to on a regular basis. Parents also claimed that playing Magic helped keep their children out of trouble, such as using illegal drugs or joining criminal gangs. On the other hand, the article also briefly mentions that Magic can be highly addictive, leading to parents worried about their children's Magic obsession. In addition, until 2007, some of the better players had opportunities to compete for a small number of scholarships.|$|E
5|$|A bicycle kick's {{successful}} performance generally requires great {{skill and}} athleticism. The performer needs to maintain good form when executing the move, and must simultaneously exhibit exceptional {{accuracy and precision}} when striking the ball. Sports historian Richard Witzig recommends that footballers attempt executing a bicycle kick with a focused and determined state of mind. Due to the action's complexity, a successfully executed bicycle kick is notable and, according <b>to</b> <b>sports</b> journalist Elliott Turner, prone to awe audiences. Brazilian forward Pelé, one of the sport's renowned players, also considers the manoeuvre difficult and recalled having scored from it {{only a few times}} out of his 1,283 career goals.|$|E

30|$|Whilst {{there is}} yet to be {{consensus}} on the preferred terminology, two papers have attempted to provide working definitions [3, 4]. Lynch et al. [3] initially defined return <b>to</b> <b>sport</b> as “one or two seasons in the sport of injury at the same level as prior to injury”. More recently a consensus statement described a return <b>to</b> <b>sport</b> continuum [4]. The continuum has three elements, the first being a return to participation, the second a return <b>to</b> <b>sport</b> and the third a return to performance. Return to participation may be a return to training or a level of sport that is lower that what the athlete desires. A return <b>to</b> <b>sport</b> is designated as the athlete having returned <b>to</b> their pre-injury <b>sport</b> of choice but not performing at the desired level, whereas a return to performance signifies that the athlete is now performing at or above the preinjury level in their chosen sport. Empirical application of this theoretical continuum has however not yet been validated for return <b>to</b> <b>sport</b> after ACL reconstruction.|$|R
5|$|A {{number of}} {{traditional}} pastimes {{have emerged in}} Madagascar. Moraingy, a type of hand-to-hand combat, is a popular spectator sport in coastal regions. It is traditionally practiced by men, but women have recently begun to participate. The wrestling of zebu cattle, which is named savika or tolon-omby, is also practiced in many regions. In addition <b>to</b> <b>sports,</b> {{a wide variety of}} games are played. Among the most emblematic is fanorona, a board game widespread throughout the Highland regions. According to folk legend, the succession of King Andrianjaka after his father Ralambo was partially due to the obsession that Andrianjaka's older brother may have had with playing fanorona to the detriment of his other responsibilities.|$|E

5|$|Rhodesia was an unrecognised {{state in}} {{southern}} Africa, {{run by a}} predominantly white minority government headed by Prime Minister Ian Smith. Taking exception to the UK's insistence on majority rule {{as a condition for}} independence, Smith's colonial administration had unilaterally declared independence in 1965 following a long dispute over the terms. International uproar and the first ever United Nations economic sanctions had ensued, making Rhodesia deeply isolated. This quarantine variously extended <b>to</b> <b>sports.</b> Rhodesian athletes, including the 1968, 1972 and 1976 Olympic squads (which were racially integrated), were barred from international competition on political grounds. Rhodesian cricket and rugby were not greatly affected as these sports largely operated in tandem with South Africa. The Rhodesia cricket team, for example, took part in the annual Currie Cup tournament against South African provincial sides.|$|E

The rivalry was also significant because it drew national attention to the faltering NBA. Prior to Johnson and Bird's arrival, the NBA had gone through a decade of declining interest and low TV ratings.

40|$|Objectives: The {{anterior}} cruciate ligament is the most commonly injured ligament in the knee, {{with an average of}} only 64 % of affected athletes returning to their pre-injury level of sport. Intrinsic factors associated with an increased likelihood of return <b>to</b> <b>sport</b> may be addressed during rehabilitation to improve the outcome of the reconstruction. The objectives of this review were to systematically appraise publications from six electronic databases describing intrinsic factors that may be associated with return <b>to</b> <b>sport</b> after {{anterior cruciate}} ligament reconstruction. Methods: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. Methodological quality appraisal was performed according to the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme for cohort studies. We performed a descriptive synthesis of the findings that associated intrinsic factors with return <b>to</b> <b>sport.</b> Results: Ten studies were included in the review. The findings show that fear of re-injury is a common reason for not returning <b>to</b> participation in <b>sport.</b> Younger patients may be more likely <b>to</b> return <b>to</b> <b>sport,</b> but findings regarding gender were equivocal, with male competitive athletes appearing to be more likely <b>to</b> return <b>to</b> <b>sport</b> than their female counterparts. Good knee function is not always associated with a higher likelihood <b>to</b> return <b>to</b> <b>sport.</b> Conclusion: Fear of re-injury and age should be considered in the management of sports participants after {{anterior cruciate ligament}} reconstruction. </p...|$|R

5|$|William Trotter Porter (December 24, 1809– July 19, 1858) was an American {{journalist}} and newspaper editor who founded an early American newspaper devoted <b>to</b> <b>sports.</b> After {{working at a}} number of small newspapers, Porter moved to New York City in the 1830s. After employment at a newspaper in the city, he founded the Spirit of the Times, a newspaper modeled on a London paper called Bell's Life in London. The Spirit, which went through a number of names and incarnations over the years, was devoted <b>to</b> <b>sports</b> and other recreational pursuits. One of Porter's main interests involved horse racing, and he was involved in attempts to create the first stud book in the United States, which did not bear fruit. He was also instrumental in the development of American literature, as the Spirit published a number of short stories by American tall tale writers, and Porter edited two collections of short stories by American writers. After publishing the Spirit through the 1830s, he sold it to another printer but continued as the editor into the 1850s. He left the original Spirit in 1855 and in 1856 was hired as editor for another sporting newspaper, Porter's Spirit of the Times, published by George Wilkes. Porter died in 1858.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} curriculum, {{there are no}} {{references}} <b>to</b> <b>sports</b> being played at Carre's before the 19th century. In 1835, the Marquis of Bristol allowed the school to use an acre of land, which probably functioned as a playground. Sports fields were not added to the grounds until 1908, but the earliest reports of the school participating in sporting events pre-date this by half a century. In the 1860s, the Sleaford Gazette reported on cricket matches with local schools, namely the rival academies run by Mr Boyer and Mr Dibben in Sleaford; by the 1890s, these matches were being organised with more distant schools, like the grammar school at Grantham. Athletics were practised at the school as early as 1871 when a sports day was held; the 100 yards and half a mile races, hurdles, the pole jump and throwing the cricket ball were activities in which forms competed. Football was played at the school as early as 1895. Glebe land was acquired in 1908 for sporting purposes and levelled in the early 1930s. A cycling club was formed in the 1940s and badminton was informally organised by pupils by the 1950s; between 1957 and 1960, a portion of land was converted into tennis courts for the school and rugby {{was introduced in the}} 1966–67 academic year.|$|E
