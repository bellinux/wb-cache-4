40|$|Anionic salts {{can have}} a {{beneficial}} effect on calcium homeostasis by inducing a mild metabolic acidosis. This causes a fall in urine pH {{which can be used}} to monitor the effects of the salts. In a pilot study, 20 cows in the last 3 weeks of gestation were matched according to parity and previous yield into anionic salt supplemented and control groups. Individual urine pHs fell within 2 days in the supplemented group but a consistent group response took approximately 7 days. In the main study, 38 cows were similarly matched but a 2 kg premix was used to incorporate the anionic salts instead of a <b>mixer</b> <b>wagon.</b> The larger variability of urinary pH in the main study compared with the pilot study was consistent with a greater variation in anionic salt intake in the main study, probably due to the use of a premix rather than a <b>mixer</b> <b>wagon</b> to administer the salts. The conclusions of the study highlighted important practical points concerning the feeding of anionic salts. Firstly, the salts need to be fed for at least 7 days for a consistent urinary pH response in a group. Secondly, the use of a <b>mixer</b> <b>wagon</b> to incorporate the salts into the ration reduces variability in anionic salt intake and consequently urinary pH variability...|$|R

40|$|Background and Aim: Avian {{influenza}} (AI) is a {{viral disease}} {{that caused the}} largest animal disease outbreak in the history of US agriculture. There are several disposal methods of AI infected poultry carcasses available in the US, which include on-site burial, landfill, incineration, rendering, and composting. Of these methods, composting is the most environmentally friendly and poses a low risk for biosecurity. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has developed a comprehensive plan for composting AI infected carcasses. The current protocols have the potential for areas of anaerobic pockets within the windrow due to inadequate mixing and the large carcass size of whole birds. This could lead to ineffective virus neutralization or prolonged composting times and higher resource costs. The purpose of this project was to determine if using a horizontal <b>mixer</b> (HM) <b>wagon</b> to mix composting ingredients or a vertical <b>mixer</b> (VM) <b>wagon</b> to mix and cut up the compositing ingredients is an economical and timely means to accelerate the tissue break-down and obtain optimal temperatures for poultry carcass composting during an AI outbreak. Materials and Methods: A replicated trial with three treatments, HM, conventional layering (CL) and VM, and three replications was initiated at the Compost Research and Education Center part of the University of Maine Forest and Agricultural Experimental Station called High Moor Farm. Daily temperatures and screened core sample weights (screen weights) on day 0, 16, and 30 were recorded for each of the compost piles. The time to build each replication was recorded and used to help calculate the cost of each method. Data on equipment, carbon material and labor costs were collected from private contractors from the 2014 to 2016 highly pathogenic AI (HPAI) outbreak and used to compare costs between methods. Results: All treatment methods reached USDA protocol temperatures to neutralize the HPAI virus. Screen weights for both the VM and HM treatments were lower than the CL treatment. Screen weights decreased significantly from day 0 to day 16 for the VM and HM treatments with no significant change from day 16 to day 30. When comparing costs, the <b>mixer</b> <b>wagon</b> methods were the more cost effective than the CL method when using high volume equipment. Conclusion: The data from this study support the use of a <b>mixer</b> <b>wagon</b> to reduce particle size and mix ingredients for more timely and effective composting of poultry carcasses...|$|R

40|$|Our {{objective}} {{was to determine if}} methods for preparing TMR [Keenan MechFiber (KMF) technology vs. vertical auger (VA) mixer] would alter physical form of the TMR and affect utilization of modified wet distillers grains with solubles (MWDGS). Holstein cows (n = 24 with 12 ruminally cannulated; 144 DIM ?? 31 d at start) were used in a split-plot design with mixer type as the whole plot and MWDGS concentrations as subplots in a 3 x 3 Latin square arrangement with 35 -d periods. Inclusion rates of MWDGS were 10, 20, and 30 % of dietary DM, primarily replacing corn, SBM, and whole cottonseed. Feed DMI was less for KMF (P = 0. 05), but was unaffected by MWDGS concentration (P = 0. 39). Milk production did not differ (P = 0. 75) by concentration of MWDGS or by interaction of MWDGS ?? mixer (P = 0. 18). Milk protein content tended (P = 0. 09) to decrease linearly with increasing MWDGS. Milk fat percentage declined with increasing MWDGS (P = 0. 003) but the interaction between <b>mixer</b> <b>wagon</b> and MWDGS (P = 0. 006) showed that decreases were larger with VA mixing. Cows fed the diet containing 30 % MWDGS mixed with KMF averaged 3. 45 % (1. 24 kg/d) milk fat; whereas, cows fed the same diet mixed with VA averaged 2. 81 % (1. 10 kg/d) fat. Concentrations of CLA trans- 10, cis- 12 in milk likely explain the differences in milk fat; the concentration of CLA t- 10, c- 12 increased as MWDGS was increased (P < 0. 0001) and the MWDGS ?? mixer interaction (P = 0. 03) showed that VA had greater concentrations. Greater mean particle size and variation with VA may partially explain differences in milk fat via increased sorting that allowed for an altered rumen environment and favored alternative biohydrogenation pathways. Feed conversion efficiency (FCE; energy-corrected milk/DMI) decreased linearly (P = 0. 007) as MWDGS increased, but FCE tended to be maintained when higher MWDGS diets were mixed using KMF rather than VA (mixer, P = 0. 12). Ruminal pH (P = 0. 05) and ammonia concentration (P < 0. 001) decreased linearly as MWDGS increased. Using the KMF <b>mixer</b> <b>wagon</b> resulted in better FCE when higher amounts of MWDGS were fed, primarily because milk fat content and yield were not as depressed and DMI was lower...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The agri-energetic chain project, {{financed by}} the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, {{concerns}} the realization of a pilot plant for energy recovering of vineyards pruning residues near an important wine viticulture company in Umbria (Cantine G. Lungarotti). The chain is divided in the following phases: grapes pruning harvesting and storage by a round-baler; chipping cylindrical bales to obtain a biochips whose size {{is consistent with the}} biomass boiler; chemical-physical characterization of the biochips; biomass energy conversion in the diathermic oil boiler. Grapes pruning round-baling reached an average productivity of 0, 70 tons/ha dry basis. Chipping of cylindrical bales, because of the huge dimensions of bales not compatible with mouth opening width of a common chipper, has been realised by means of a special <b>mixer</b> <b>wagon.</b> Energetic conversion phase will be executed by a diathermic oil boiler with useful thermal power 400 kW.

40|$|In {{constructing}} or rebuilding a dairy barn, it’s normally {{only the}} cost of investment for the building (climatic barrier, foundation, floor and installations) that is evaluated in the capital investment estimate. Indirect costs as labour, forage, maintenance or animal health that occur because of differences in the building function are not considered. A simple and cheap building may lead to higher operating costs. Low costs for mechanization may lead to high labour costs and that’s why it’s important to include all building related costs when comparing construction and installations alternatives. This report shows results from manual work time studies from 13 farms with dairy cows in loose housing, representing different herd sizes (80 to 450 cows) and levels of mechanization (Automatic milking system, AMS, fixed and rotary parlour and level of mechanisation of feed distribution). The farms were visited both afternoon and morning during season with no grazing. The farmers and the cattle employees answered a questionnaire about work routines and herd information. Following type of work procedures were investigated: dairy cows (milking cleaning of parlour, feeding, littering, and cleaning of cubicles and other work), heifers (feeding, littering, cleaning and other work) and calves (milk feeding, feeding, littering, cleaning and other work). All figures are given as minutes per milking cow and day. There were big time differences between equal milking systems. The AMS barns had the shortest work time for milking (0. 27 to 0. 80 min/cow and day). The various milking time in the AMS stables depended on the numbers of alarms and cows needed to be caught for milking. Work time in the milking parlours (1. 84 to 3. 96 min/cow and day) depended on use of automatic cow gate or herd dog that pushed the cows. For calves, work time varied from 0 min (suckling cows) to 0. 57 min/cow and day. Work time for the young stock varied considerable (0. 32 to 1. 05 min/cow and day). Five model farms were constructed to show the effect of number of cows {{and the level of}} mechanization on the working time. With AMS in a 140 head herd and {{with a high degree of}} mechanization, the work time became 2. 1 min/cow and day. The work time became three times higher (6. 28 min/cow and day) in a herd of the same size using 2 x 8 herringbone parlour and with a low tech mechanisation.

40|$|Mestrado em Engenharia Zootécnica - Produção Animal - Instituto Superior de Agronomia / Faculdade de Medicina VeterináriaThe feed {{management}} {{is very important}} in animal nutrition, specifically in farm animals. The diet supplements usually associated with high milk yield of cows is often used also by the ease of their management. This work studied the homogeneity of the TMR designed for Holstein dairy cows using an horizontal <b>mixer</b> <b>wagon,</b> by chemical composition (DM, CP, NDF, ADF and ADL) and particle size (sieve with 19, 8, 1 mm and bottom) to ensure that meets their nutritional needs. Also the nutritional parameters (DM, CP, NDF, ADF and ADL) were studied for the feed constituents in the diet: corn silage, alfalfa hay, tomato pomace and compound feed. For this study feed from 3 pens which contain the same diet consisting for 226 cows was analyzed. Samples of the diet were taken in for 4 days (not consecutive) in {{the beginning and end of}} each pen, while in the pen 2 and 3 were also sampled in the middle, after distribution of the morning diet. On the chemical composition of the diet, there are only significant variations in levels of DM and ADL, taking into account the day of trial, without these differences result in bad diets formulated or processed. These changes may be due to the quantity of tomato incorporated in the diet (high moisture). Compared to the previously formulated diet, the results indicate that the DM and CP are slightly lower; the values proposed by NRC (2001) for NDF are below the values obtained, while the percentage of ADF is in agreement with the expected. On the study of the ingredients of the diet, there are specific nutritional differences compared with reference values, but in a general rule, feeds in the diet for the parameters under study are within the specified limits. The results of the particle size of the diet showed significant differences in all size classes for the days of testing, including also the particles between 1 to 8 mm in view of the pens of the test. In D 1, the percentage of particles between 1 to 8 mm is higher than expected, with other classes within the size limits. The reduction of particles retained in sieve of 8 mm, and an increase in the sieve of 1 mm in D 2, can be explain by the mixing time practiced. Overall, the proportion of particles 8 - 19 mm were under and particles 1 - 8 mm were above the recommended values. In the last day of testing, the higher processing time of the forage may have led to reduction of particles with size > 19 mm, leading to only the particles < 1 mm were in appropriate proportions. The differences occurred between pens were small and could be a consequence of the distance between pens and the path irregular used by SRMDR. On average the size fractions ranging from 1 to 8 mm to 19 mm and 8 are not inagreement with the expected. The particles retained in sieve of 1 mm are at higher percentage, whereas fractions retained in the sieve with 8 mm are lower.

40|$|The {{mixing process}} greatly {{influence}} the mixing efficiency, {{as well as}} the quality and the price of the intermediate and/or the final product. Static mixer is used for premixing action before the main mixing process, for significant reduction of mixing time and energy consumption. This type of premixing action is not investigated in detail in the open literature. In this article, the novel numerical approach called Discrete Element Method is used for modelling of granular flow in multiple static mixer applications (1 - 3 Komax or Ross mixing elements were utilized), while the Computational Fluid Dynamic method was chosen for fluid flow modelling, using the Eulerian multiphase model. The main aim {{of this article is to}} predict the behaviour of granules being gravitationally <b>transported</b> in different <b>mixer</b> configuration and to choose the best configuration of the mixer taking into account the total particle path, the number of mixing elements and the quality of the obtained mixture.

40|$|AbstractA novel freeze-quench {{instrument}} with {{a characteristic}} «dead-time» of 137 ± 18 μs is reported. The prototype has several key features that {{distinguish it from}} conventional freeze-quench devices and provide a significant improvement in time resolution: (a) high operating pressures (up to 400 bar) result in a sample flow with high linear rates (up to 200 m s− 1); (b) tangential micro-mixer with an operating volume of ∼ 1 nl yields short mixing times (up to 20 μs); (c) fast <b>transport</b> between the <b>mixer</b> and the cryomedium results in short reaction times: the ageing solution exits the mixer as a free-flowing jet, and the chemical reaction occurs “in–flight” {{on the way to}} the cryomedium; (d) a small jet diameter (∼ 20 μm) and a high jet velocity (∼ 200 m s− 1) provide high sample-cooling rates, resulting in a short cryofixation time (up to 30 μs). The dynamic range of the freeze-quench device is between 130 μs and 15 ms. The novel tangential micro-mixer efficiently mixes viscous aqueous solutions, showing more than 95 % mixing at η≤ 4 (equivalent to protein concentrations up to 250 mg ml− 1), which makes it an excellent tool for the preparation of pre-steady state samples of concentrated protein solutions for spectroscopic structure analysis. The novel freeze-quench device is characterized using the reaction of binding of azide to metmyoglobin from horse heart. Reaction samples are analyzed using 77 K optical absorbance spectroscopy, and X–band EPR spectroscopy. A simple procedure of spectral analysis is reported that allows (a) to perform a quantitative analysis of the reaction kinetics and (b) to identify and characterize novel reaction intermediates. The reduction of dioxygen by the bo 3 -type quinol oxidase from Escherichia coli is assayed using the MHQ technique. In these pilot experiments, low-temperature optical absorbance measurements show the rapid oxidation of heme o 3 in the first 137 μs of the reaction, accompanied by the formation of an oxo-ferryl species. X-band EPR spectroscopy shows that a short-living radical intermediate is formed during the oxidation of heme o 3. The radical decays within ∼ 1 ms concomitant with the oxidation of heme b, and can be attributed to the PM reaction intermediate converting to the oxoferryl intermediate F.
