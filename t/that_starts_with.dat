5|$|Three {{californium}} isotopes {{with significant}} half-lives are produced, requiring {{a total of}} 15 neutron captures by uranium-238 without nuclear fission or alpha decay occurring during the process. Californium-253 {{is at the end}} of a production chain <b>that</b> <b>starts</b> <b>with</b> uranium-238, includes several isotopes of plutonium, americium, curium, berkelium, and the californium isotopes 249 to 253 (see diagram).|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} stable isotopes, {{which make up}} almost all lead that exists naturally, there are trace {{quantities}} of a few radioactive isotopes. One of them is lead-210; although it has a half-life of only 22.3 years, small quantities occur in nature because lead-210 is produced by a long decay series <b>that</b> <b>starts</b> <b>with</b> uranium-238 (which has been present for billions of years on Earth). Lead-211, -212, and -214 {{are present in the}} decay chains of uranium-235, thorium-232, and uranium-238, respectively, so traces of all three of these lead isotopes are found naturally. Minute traces of lead-209 arise from the very rare cluster decay of radium-223, one of the daughter products of natural uranium-235. Lead-210 is particularly useful for helping to identify the ages of samples by measuring its ratio to lead-206 (both isotopes are present in a single decay chain).|$|E

25|$|During each heartbeat, {{a healthy}} heart has an orderly {{progression}} of depolarization <b>that</b> <b>starts</b> <b>with</b> pacemaker {{cells in the}} sinoatrial node, spreads out through the atrium, passes through the atrioventricular node down into the bundle of His and into the Purkinje fibers, spreading down {{and to the left}} throughout the ventricles. This orderly pattern of depolarization gives rise to the characteristic ECG tracing. To the trained clinician, an ECG conveys a large amount of information about the structure of the heart and the function of its electrical conduction system. Among other things, an ECG can be used to measure the rate and rhythm of heartbeats, the size and position of the heart chambers, the presence of any damage to the heart's muscle cells or conduction system, the effects of cardiac drugs, and the function of implanted pacemakers.|$|E
25|$|Inside the ovary/ovaries are {{one or more}} ovules {{where the}} {{megagametophyte}} contains the egg cell. After double fertilization, these ovules will become seeds. The ovules are fertilized in a process <b>that</b> <b>starts</b> <b>with</b> pollination, which involves the movement of pollen from the stamens to the stigma of flowers. After pollination, a tube grows from the pollen through the stigma into the ovary to the ovule and two sperm are transferred from the pollen to the megagametophyte. Within the megagametophyte {{one of the two}} sperm unites with the egg, forming a zygote, and the second sperm enters the central cell forming the endosperm mother cell, which completes the double fertilization process. Later the zygote will give rise to the embryo of the seed, and the endosperm mother cell will give rise to endosperm, a nutritive tissue used by the embryo.|$|E

Milk is invited to, and attends, the christening of White's first child, and White asks for Milk's {{assistance}} in preventing {{a psychiatric hospital}} from opening in White's district, possibly in exchange for White's support of Milk's citywide gay rights ordinance. When Milk fails to support White because of the negative effect it will have on troubled youth, White feels betrayed, and ultimately becomes the sole vote against the gay rights ordinance. Milk also launches an effort to defeat Proposition 6, an initiative on the California state ballot in November 1978.

Kleinman concluded by noting that the episode helps The Simpsons stand apart from other animated and live action sitcoms by focusing more on the relationships between the characters than [...] "just a humorous weekly plotline".|$|E
500|$|Over the years, several {{theories}} {{emerged as}} to why the game was called Final Fantasy. In 2015, Sakaguchi stated that, from the beginning, the team had wished for a name that could be shortened to that way, the game's title could be abbreviated in the Latin script and pronounced in four syllables in the Japanese language. The original working title for Sakaguchi's RPG concept was Fighting Fantasy, but it was changed to avoid issues with a tabletop game of the same name that had already been released. The reason for choosing the word [...] "final" [...] to form the eventual title of Final Fantasy was explained as twofold by Uematsu: for one thing, it stemmed from Sakaguchi's personal situation, as he would have quit the game industry and gone back to university had the game not sold well, and for another, Square was under the threat of bankruptcy at the time, which meant the game could have been the company's last. Although Sakaguchi confirmed some of the theories, he later downplayed the rationale for choosing the word [...] "final", saying that [...] "it was definitely a back-to-the-wall type situation back then, but any word <b>that</b> <b>starts</b> <b>with</b> an 'F' would have been fine".|$|E

However, during the pre-production of Evanescence, the band quickened the tempo of the song, so when the group attempted to record the song, playing the harp's part was not feasible.
