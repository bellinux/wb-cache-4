40|$|In {{structural}} fire engineering, {{the importance of}} bolt assemblies is often overlooked. Connection design uses the temperature-dependent bolt strength-reduction factors prescribed in Eurocode 3, despite the existence of two distinct failure modes under tension; bolt breakage, and thread-stripping. This thesis investigates the factors which influence failure modes at ambient and elevated temperatures {{and a range of}} strain-rates through microstructural characterisation, tensile testing and finite element modelling. Microstructural characterisation carried out on M 20 galvanised bolt assemblies consisting of Grade 8. 8 bolts and Property Class 10 nuts from a range of manufacturers has highlighted that, despite a specified tempered-martensite microstructure, microstructural variations existed between different manufacturers and within a single batch. These microstructural variations not only affected the flow behaviour of the bolt material but determined the failure modes of bolt assemblies at ambient temperatures. Tensile testing of turned-down bolts allowed the temperature and strain-rate dependent flow behaviour of bolt material to be investigated, eliminating the effect of thread deformation. The flow curves obtained were input to a finite element model to represent true bolt material behaviour, which was validated against force-displacement curves obtained from uniaxial tensile testing of bolt assemblies from the same batch. Both experimental and finite element modelling work have highlighted the importance of using a tight <b>thread</b> <b>tolerance</b> class combination and a suitably tall nut to ensure ductile bolt breakage failures and avoid thread-stripping. ...|$|E

40|$|A key {{mechanism}} {{used in the}} on-orbit {{assembly of}} the International Space Station (ISS) pressurized elements is the Common Berthing Mechanism (CBM). The mechanism that effects the structural connection of the CBM halves is the Powered Bolt Assembly. There are sixteen Powered Bolt Assemblies per CBM. The CBM has a bolt which engages a self aligning Powered Bolt Nut (PBN) on the mating interface; see Figure 1. The Powered Bolt Assemblies are preloaded to approximately 19 kilo pounds (KIPs) prior to pressurization of the CBM. The PBNs mentioned below, manufactured in 2009, will be used on ISS future missions. An on orbit functional failure of this hardware would be unacceptable {{and in some instances}} catastrophic due to the failure of modules to mate and seal the atmosphere, risking loss of crew and ISS functions. The manufacturing processes which create the PBNs need to be strictly controlled. Functional (torque vs. tension) acceptance test failures will be the result of processes not being strictly followed. Without the proper knowledge of <b>thread</b> <b>tolerances,</b> fabrication techniques, and dry film lubricant application processes, PBNs will be, and have been manufactured improperly. The knowledge gained from acceptance test failures and the resolution of those failures, thread fabrication techniques and thread dry film lubrication processes can be applied to many aerospace mechanisms to enhance their performance. Test data and manufactured PBN thread geometry will be discussed for both failed and successfully accepted PBNs...|$|R
50|$|The Tera Computer Company was a {{manufacturer}} of high-performance computing software and hardware, founded in 1987 in Washington, D.C. and moved 1988 to Seattle, Washington by James Rottsolk and Burton Smith. The company's first supercomputer product, named MTA, featured interleaved multi-threading, i.e. a barrel processor. It also had no data cache, relying instead on switching between <b>threads</b> for latency <b>tolerance,</b> and used a deeply pipelined memory system to handle many simultaneous requests, with address randomization to avoid memory hot spots.|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} interest in implementing a multithreaded program execution and architecture model on a multiprocessor whose primary processors consist of today's off-the-shelf microprocessors. Unlike some custom-designed multithreaded processor architectures, which can interleave multiple threads concurrently, conventional processors can only execute one thread at a time. This presents {{a unique and}} challenging problem to the compiler: partition a program into threads so that it executes both correctly and in minimal time. We present a new heuristic algorithm based on an interesting extension of the classical list scheduling algorithm. Based on a cost model, our algorithm groups instructions into threads by considering the trade-offs among parallelism, latency <b>tolerance,</b> <b>thread</b> switching costs and sequential execution efficiency. The proposed algorithm has been implemented, and its performance measured through experiments {{on a variety of}} architecture parameters a [...] ...|$|R
50|$|However, {{this ideal}} {{condition}} would in practice only be approximated and would generally require wrench-assisted assembly, possibly causing the galling of the threads. For this reason, some allowance, or minimum difference, between the PDs {{of the internal}} and external threads has to generally be provided for, to eliminate the possibility of deviations from the ideal thread form causing interference and to expedite hand assembly up to the length of engagement. Such allowances, or fundamental deviations, as ISO standards call them, are provided for in various degrees in corresponding classes of fit for ranges of thread sizes. At one extreme, no allowance is provided by a class, but the maximum PD of the external thread is specified to be the same as the minimum PD of the internal <b>thread,</b> within specified <b>tolerances,</b> ensuring that the two can be assembled, with some looseness of fit still possible due to the margin of tolerance. A class called interference fit may even provide for negative allowances, where the PD of the screw is greater than the PD of the nut by at least the amount of the allowance.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Because of the {{importance}} of screw threads in machine elements, screw thread measurement and inspection has been debated extensively for more than 20 years. There are about 30 separate geometrical features and dimensional characteristics in the design and construction of screw threads. Therefore many methods have been developed for measuring and inspecting these features. Most of these methods are limited to measuring or inspecting a small number of features. In this paper, a novel system has been developed, using a Measurescope, personal computer and developed software, for measuring and inspecting most of the common types of screw thread. The system is capable of measuring the most common features of screw threads (16 features). Repeatability of measurements is also provided to obtain accurate measurements and useful statistical parameters. In addition, the system is capable of inspecting threads based on a reference <b>thread</b> and given <b>tolerances</b> for the measured features. The traceability process and the uncertainty budget of the developed system are presented. The developed software, named AutoMIST, is fully written in house using Microsoft Visual Cþþ 6. 0 and it is ready to run on any Windows 1 environment...|$|R
