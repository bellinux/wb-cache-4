40|$|We {{describe}} {{a case of}} an ASNIS III 5. 0 mm partially threaded cannulated screw unthreading itself as it was being inserted during fracture fixation of a humerus. The majority of complications associated with cannulated screws involve breaking of the screw, as opposed <b>to</b> <b>unthreading.</b> We believe that the self tapping design of the screw, {{in combination with the}} cannulated design, creates a potential area of weakness when used on hard bone...|$|R

5000|$|A {{water thief}} is a {{synthetic}} rubber fitting that attaches <b>to</b> an <b>unthreaded</b> faucet {{on one end}} and a common garden hose on the other. It is commonly used to fill fresh water tanks in recreational vehicles when a threaded hose bib is not available.|$|R
40|$|High {{pressure}} tube coupling connects <b>to</b> any straight, <b>unthreaded,</b> and unflared tubing end without deforming or damaging the tubing. The coupling grips the tube wall tightly between an external compression sleeve and an internal hollow mandrel. It is adaptable to standard screw fittings for test stand attachment...|$|R
25|$|Thread forming {{and thread}} rolling are {{processes}} for forming screw threads, {{with the former}} referring to creating internal threads and the latter external threads. In both of these processes threads are formed into a blank by pressing a shaped tool, commonly called a 'thread rolling die' against the blank, in a process similar to knurling. These processes are used for large production runs because typical production rates are around one piece per second. Forming and rolling produce no swarf and less material is required because the blank size starts smaller than a blank required for cutting threads; there is typically a 15 to 20% material savings in the blank, by weight. A rolled thread can be easily recognized on fasteners that were formed from an unstopped blank because the thread has a larger diameter than the blank rod from which it has been made; however, necks and undercuts can be cut or rolled onto blanks with threads that are not rolled, and some fasteners are made from blanks with a reduced shank {{in the region to}} be rolled to maintain a constant major diameter from thread <b>to</b> <b>unthreaded</b> shank. Unless faced off, the end threads of a rolled fastener have a cupped end, as the surplus material in the tapering down final threads collapses uniformly over the end of the blank.|$|R
40|$|Transcription {{machinery}} from {{a variety}} of organisms shows striking mechanistic similarity. Both multi- and single subunit RNA polymerases have evolved an 8 â€“ 10 -base pair RNA-DNA hybrid {{as a part of a}} stably transcribing elongation complex. Through characterization of halted complexes that can readily carry out homopolymeric slippage synthesis, this study reveals that T 7 RNA polymerase elongation complexes containing only a 4 -base pair hybrid can nevertheless be more stable than those with the normal 8 -base pair hybrid. We propose that a key feature of this stability is the topological threading of RNA through the complex and/or around the DNA template strand. The data are consistent with forward translocation as a mechanism <b>to</b> allow <b>unthreading</b> of the topological lock, as can occur during programmed termination of transcription...|$|R
40|$|DNA {{threading}} intercalation is a DNA binding mode, whereby {{a molecule}} must thread a bulky group through the DNA duplex {{to allow a}} planar central section to stack with the DNA base pairs. Molecules that bind to DNA via threading intercalation display incredibly slow association and dissociation kinetics. This {{is a result of}} the large duplex deformations required for the ligand <b>to</b> thread and <b>unthread</b> the DNA. While this binding mode has been investigated extensively, the specific molecular characteristics that affect the binding to DNA are still poorly understood...|$|R
40|$|Hydrophobic {{self-assembly}} {{has been}} used to direct the synthesis of conjugated [2] and [3]rotaxanes (20 and 21) in aqueous solution, by Glaser coupling a water-soluble alkyne 3 {{in the presence of a}} cyclophane 6. No rotaxanes were formed when cyclodextrins were used instead of the cyclophane. NMR and electrospray mass spectrometry were used to probe the binding properties of the stopper unit 3. NMR ring current shifts and NOEs show that the cyclophane 6 binds mainly to the terminal phenylene unit of 3. In solution cyclodextrins bind less strongly than the cyclophane, whereas in the gas-phase cyclodextrins bind more strongly. The water-soluble rotaxanes are fully characterised by electrospray mass spectrometry, NMR and UV-VIS emission/absorption. Both rotaxanes tend <b>to</b> fragment, by <b>unthreading</b> and by dumbbell-cleavage, during electrospray ionisation, particularly at high cone voltages. The insulation of the conjugated dumbbell inside the [3]rotaxane results in increased fluorescence efficiency. Time-resolved fluorescence measurements show that these rotaxanes decompose during photolysis to give products with longer fluorescence lifetimes; the rate of this photodecomposition is slower for the [3]rotaxane than for the naked dumbbell. The extension of this synthetic approach to larger polyrotaxanes was explored by coupling alkyne 3 and diethynylbenzene 2 in the presence of cyclophane 6; this gives some longer [2] and [3]rotaxanes but higher polyrotaxanes are not formed...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} {{conjugated}} polyrotaxane insulated molecular wires are synthesised by aqueous Suzuki polymerisation, using hydrophobic binding to promote threading of the cyclodextrin units. These polyrotaxanes have conjugated polymer cores based on poly(para-phenylene), polyfluorene, and poly(diphenylene-vinylene), threaded through 0. 9 - 1. 6 cyclodextrins per repeat unit. Bulky naphthalene- 3, 6 -disulfonate endgroups prevent the macrocycles from slipping off the conjugated polymer chains. Dialysis experiments {{show that the}} cyclodextrins become unthreaded only if smaller stoppers are used. MALDI TOF mass spectra detect oligomers with up to ten threaded cyclodextrins, and reveal the presence of some defects that result for oxidative homo-coupling of boronic acids. Weight-average molecular weights were determined by analytical ultracentrifugation, demonstrating that step-growth polymerisation is efficient enough to achieve degrees of polymerisation up to approximately 20 repeat units (84 para-phenylenes). The fluorescence spectra of these polyrotaxanes indicate {{that the presence of}} the threaded cyclodextrin macrocycles reduces the flexibility of the conjugated polymer pi-systems. Both the solution and the solid-state photoluminescence quantum yields are enhanced upon threading of the conjugated polyaromatic cores through alpha- or beta-cyclodextrins, and the emission spectra of the polyrotaxanes are blue-shifted compared <b>to</b> the corresponding <b>unthreaded</b> polymers. The greater weight of the 0 - 0 transition in the emission spectra, as well as the smaller Stokes shift, indicate that the polyrotaxanes are more rigid than the unthreaded polymers...|$|R
50|$|The {{order of}} {{installation}} of a typical headset follows. The steerer tube is cut to the appropriate length by the bicycle fork manufacturer and the top 1-2 inch cm of the steerer is threaded using a rolling process. This process assures that no material is lost and the steerer would not be weakened as with a die or lathe cutting. Threaded forks necessitate that the threads on the steerer only use the top 1-2 inches, therefore the forks are sold in varying lengths. If {{there is a need}} to use a fork that is too long, meaning the fork steerer is not threaded down far enough, a bicycle mechanic can use a die to extend the threads. This is not recommended if the threads need to be cut farther than an inch or so. As a side note, one should never try <b>to</b> thread an <b>unthreaded</b> steerer after manufacturing as this will weaken the steerer tube. The threads are normally of the ISO standard, 1 in by 24 tpi, but other standards exist. The headtube may be faced and then the cups are pressed into the headtube using a special press that ensures they are square and true. The fork crown may be faced and then the crown race is pressed on to the fork crown with a special press that also makes sure that it is square and true. Then the bearings are placed on top of the crown race, after which the steerer tube is inserted into the headtube. The upper bearings are placed in the upper cup, and the upper race is screwed onto the steerer. A washer, frequently a keyed washer, is placed on top of the upper race and a locknut is screwed on top of that.|$|R
