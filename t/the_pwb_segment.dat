40|$|Abstract: <b>The</b> Programmer's Workbench (<b>PWB)</b> is a {{specialized}} computing facility dedicated to satisfying {{the needs of}} developers of computer programs. <b>The</b> <b>PWB</b> might well be called a &quot;human-end &quot; computer; like &quot;front-end &quot; and &quot;back-end &quot; com-puters, it improves productivity by efficient specialization. It pro-vides a convenient working environment and a uniform set of programming tools to {{a diverse group of}} programming projects. These projects produce software for various &quot;target &quot; computers, including IBM System/ 370 and UNIVAC 1100 systems of much greater size than <b>the</b> <b>PWB</b> machines. <b>The</b> projects range in size from several people up to several hundred. <b>The</b> first <b>PWB</b> machine was installed in October, 1973; usage, acceptance, and interest have grown rapidly since that time. <b>The</b> <b>PWB</b> currently supports about 110 time-sharing terminals, utilizing a network of four DEC PDP- 11 computers, all running the UNIX Time-Sharing System. <b>The</b> <b>PWB</b> adds tools to UNIX to support large projects. This paper gives an overview of <b>the</b> <b>PWB</b> and its development; further details appear in the five following companion paper...|$|R
40|$|The paleotropical woody bamboos (PWB) {{are members}} of Bambuseae (tropical woody bamboos) in {{subfamily}} Bambusoideae of the grass family (Poaceae). Although <b>the</b> <b>PWB</b> are important in ecological and economic functions, the phylogenetic relationships of <b>the</b> <b>PWB</b> remain equivocal. All four currently recognized subtribes of <b>the</b> <b>PWB</b> have never been completely examined for their evolutionary relationships and no morphological synapomorphy of <b>the</b> <b>PWB</b> has ever been revealed in previously published work. Six chloroplast sequences with coding (ndhF 32 ̆ 7 and matK) and non-coding (rpl 16 intron, rps 16 intron, trnD-trnT spacer, and trnT-trnL spacer) regions and three low-copy nuclear sequences (GPA 1, Pabp 1, and PvCel 1) are analyzed to clarify the systematics and evolution of <b>the</b> <b>PWB</b> based on maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference. Forty morphological and anatomical characters are analyzed and mapped on the respective plastid and nuclear consensus trees. The objectives {{of this study are}} to: (1) test the monophyly of <b>the</b> <b>PWB</b> and all subtribes using chloroplast and low-copy nuclear sequences; (2) examine the phylogenetic relationships of all subtribes in <b>the</b> <b>PWB</b> clade based on molecular analyses; and (3) evaluate morphological evolution of <b>the</b> <b>PWB.</b> <b>The</b> <b>PWB</b> form a monophyletic group with six clades [Bambusinae, Madagascan Hickeliinae, Melocanninae, Racemobambosinae, CDMNPS (Cyrtochloa-Dinochloa-Mullerochloa-Neololeba-Parabambusa-Pinga-Sphaerobambos) + Greslania, and Temburongia] and are sister to the Neotropical woody bamboo (NWB) clade based on plastid and nuclear markers. The relationships among subtribes of <b>the</b> <b>PWB</b> are different between two molecular topologies. The plastid analysis supports the monophyly of Melocanninae and its position as sister to <b>the</b> remaining <b>PWB.</b> Within PWB and exclusive of Melocanninae, Madagascan Hickeliinae form a monophyletic group sister to the rest of <b>the</b> <b>PWB.</b> Non-Madagascan Nastus are clustered with Racemobambosinae to form a clade. The core Bambusinae basically consists of a polytomy and the CDMNPS + Greslania clade is removed from subtribe Bambusinae and resolved as sister to the Racemobambosinae. In the nuclear analysis, the six lineages of <b>the</b> <b>PWB</b> from a polytomy, and six diverse genomic components are representative of Bambusoideae: one genome for the herbaceous bamboos (H), two genomes each for the temperate woody bamboos (genomes A and B) and the NWB (genomes C and D), and three genomes for <b>the</b> <b>PWB</b> (genomes C, D, and E). However, some taxa of <b>the</b> <b>PWB</b> show variation of genomic components from one to three genomes. The incongruence between plastid and nuclear analyses is most strongly indicated at the tribal rank. The chloroplast analysis strongly supports the tropical woody bamboos as sister to the herbaceous bamboos, forming a tropical bamboo clade, with this clade sister to the temperate woody bamboos, whereas the low-copy nuclear analysis strongly supports the woody bamboo clade (tropical + temperate woody bamboos) as sister to the herbaceous bamboos. Morphological investigation suggests that the presence of six stamens is a potential synapomorphy of <b>the</b> <b>PWB.</b> Melocanninae exhibit a narrow and glabrous ovary with an elongated and hollow style. The presence of extravaginal or infravaginal branching with a dipping nodal line is a unique character combination of Hickeliinae. Climbing bamboos with a wrinkled and prominent girdle diagnose the CDMNPS clade. Racemobambosinae + non-Madagascan Nastus possess a cap on the top of ovary apex with short style, whereas the Temburongia clade exhibits a blunt ovary apex without cap and moderate style length...|$|R

When the stencil is in contact with <b>the</b> <b>PWB,</b> solder paste is applied over the top surface of the stencil using a squeegee.

The amount of solder paste which is released from the stencil apertures and transferred to <b>the</b> <b>PWB</b> pads, determines {{whether or not the}} print is good. Ideally, all volumes of solder paste should be equal to the volume of the corresponding stencil aperture. In reality however, this is never the case. Hence, a print is considered to be good if a certain fraction of the paste is released. One way of quantifying print performance is to calculate the Transfer Efficiency.

30|$|The Psychological Well-Being Scale (PWB) (Ryff [1989]) is an 84 item {{self-rating}} inventory {{that covers}} the 6 areas of psychological well-being: autonomy, environmental mastery, personal growth, positive relations with others, purpose in life and self-acceptance. Subjects respond with a 6 -point Likert scale ranging from “strongly disagree” to ”strongly agree“. Responses to negatively scored items are reversed in the final scoring procedure. <b>The</b> <b>PWB</b> has already been validated in an Italian population (Ruini et al.

50|$|Board {{is located}} by {{identify}} global fiducials on <b>the</b> <b>PWB.</b> Then <b>the</b> feeders {{pick up and}} center the components at a known distance from the component.

In the end, the component is placed at the correct X, Y and theta location with all leads ion the correct pads in contact with solder paste. <b>The</b> <b>PWBs</b> with all components correctly placed will then move to the reflow process.|$|R
50|$|The {{required}} accuracy in alignment {{can also be}} achieved by controlling the flow of solder on <b>the</b> <b>PWB</b> during reflow soldering. For this purpose, {{the space between the}} pads is often coated with a solder mask. The solder mask materials have no affinity to the molten solder and hence, no positive bonding is formed between them as the solder solidifies.

The mask protects <b>the</b> <b>PWB</b> against oxidation, and prevents unintended solder bridges from forming between closely spaced solder pads.|$|R

40|$|A {{simplified}} {{model is}} developed {{for analysis of}} interconnect stresses induced by changes in the curvature of printed wiring boards. The model utilizes the Rayleigh-Ritz variational approach {{and can be used}} for rapid assessment and is well-suited for parametric studies because it does not need any numerical meshing. This simplified model represents the component as an equivalent shell and the interconnects as deformable beams. As a simplification, any initial warpage of the component has been neglected in this study. Finite element models are used to verify the simplified model: a simplified FEA model that utilizes the same shell idealization as the proposed Rayleigh-Ritz model and a more detailed 3 D solid model. The proposed simplified model provides a faster, more versatile alternative to FEA and can be used to estimate the interconnect stresses caused by PWB warpage under a variety of thermomechanical, vibration, and shock/drop loading conditions. This thesis focuses on demonstrating the use of this simplified modeling approach for area array surface mount components (e. g. stud-grid array, land-grid array, column grid array, and ball grid array). In particular, the example problem addressed in this thesis is the pre-stress induced in surface mount area-array interconnects during the solder reflow process used for attaching surface mount packages to printed wiring boards (<b>PWBs).</b> <b>The</b> possibility exists for <b>the</b> <b>PWB</b> and component to warp during the reflow process and therefore exhibit some concave or convex curvature once the process has been completed. If <b>the</b> <b>PWB</b> is then straightened during the assembly process, the act of straightening <b>the</b> <b>PWB</b> can cause pre-stresses to develop in the interconnects between <b>the</b> <b>PWB</b> and <b>the</b> component package. It is important to understand these pre-stresses because unaccounted for interconnect pre-stresses can result in premature wear-out failures or unexpected overstress failures of the assembly...|$|R
30|$|In {{addition}} to gratitude, inspiration, fascination, and envy as mediators {{in a first}} step, the tested multiple-step multiple mediator model (Figure  1) included <b>the</b> six <b>PWB</b> dimensions as mediators in a second step, and life satisfaction as outcome variable. Mplus Version 6.1 was employed to run the analyses. I initially specified a model containing all possible paths from admiration and adoration to inspiration, fascination, gratitude, and envy, from these four emotions to <b>the</b> six <b>PWB</b> dimensions, and from <b>the</b> six <b>PWB</b> dimension to life satisfaction. Direct paths between admiration and adoration or the other four emotions and life satisfaction were not included, because I did not expect the emotions to have an additional effect on life satisfaction once <b>the</b> <b>PWB</b> dimensions were taken into account. Similarly, only two direct paths between admiration and adoration and <b>the</b> <b>PWB</b> dimensions were included based on theoretical considerations and the correlative evidence: the direct path between admiration and personal growth and the direct path between adoration and purpose in life. The decision to set direct paths to zero is supported by simulation studies which demonstrated that estimates of indirect effects are not affected by the magnitude of direct effects and, therefore, it is permissible to simplify the model in this way (MacKinnon, Lockwood, and Williams [2004]). The covariance between admiration and adoration and the residual covariances between the mediators were estimated {{as part of the}} model.

40|$|Electronic {{assemblies}} often experience multiaxial vibration {{environments in}} use and tall, heavy components {{are more vulnerable}} when exposed to multiaxial vibration than are shorter, lighter assemblies. The added vulnerability comes from higher stresses that {{are a result of}} nonlinear dynamic amplification which large components are susceptible to under simultaneous multiaxial excitation, termed multi degree of freedom (MDoF) excitation. However, it is still common practice to conduct vibration durability testing on electronic assemblies one axis at a time – in what is termed sequential single degree of freedom (SSDoF) testing. SSDoF testing has been shown to produce lower fatigue damage accumulation rates than simultaneous MDoF testing, in the leads of tall and heavy electronic components. This leads to overestimating the expected lifespan of the assembly. This paper investigates the geometric nonlinearities and the resulting cross-axis interactions that tall and heavy electronic components experience when subjected to vibration excitation along two orthogonal axes – one direction is in the plane of <b>the</b> <b>PWB</b> and <b>the</b> other is along the normal to <b>the</b> <b>PWB.</b> <b>The</b> direction normal to <b>the</b> <b>PWB</b> aligns with <b>the</b> axial direction of the leads, while the in-plane direction aligns with the primary bending direction of the leads.

40|$|Out-of-plane {{displacement}} (warpage) {{is one of}} {{the major}} thermomechanical reliability concerns for board-level electronic packaging. Printed wiring board (PWB) and component warpage results from CTE mismatch among the materials that make up <b>the</b> <b>PWB</b> assembly (PWBA). Warpage occurring during surface-mount assembly reflow processes and normal operations may cause serious reliability problems. In this research, a convective reflow and projection moire warpage measurement system was developed. The system is the first real-time, non-contact, and full-field measurement system capable of measuring PWB/PWBA/chip package warpage with the projection moire technique during different thermal reflow processes. In order to accurately simulate the reflow process and to achieve the ideal heating rate, a convective heating system was designed and integrated with the projection moire system. An advanced feedback controller was implemented to obtain the optimum heating responses. The developed system has the advantages of simulating different types of reflow processes, and reducing the temperature gradients through the PWBA thickness to ensure that the projection moire system can provide more accurate measurements. Automatic package detection and segmentation algorithms were developed for the projection moire system. The algorithms are used for automatic segmentation of <b>the</b> <b>PWB</b> and assembled packages so that the warpage of <b>the</b> <b>PWB</b> and chip packages can be determined individually. The effect of initial <b>PWB</b> warpage on <b>the</b> fatigue reliability of solder bumps on board assemblies was investigated using finite element modeling (FEM) and the projection moire system.
