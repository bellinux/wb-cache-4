Components of relevant Information and Communication Technology (ICT) functionality comprise of computing, connectivity, content and capacity. These functionalities are extended to include the <b>delivery</b> <b>mechanism.</b> The <b>delivery</b> <b>mechanism</b> is responsible for the actual {{delivery of}} digital content and services to communities or individual end users. The {{purpose of this study is}} describing a content <b>delivery</b> <b>mechanism</b> that provides access-technology agnostic delivery of digital content and services to resource-constrained communities. The proposed <b>delivery</b> <b>mechanism</b> adopts the conceptual service delivery architecture of the telecommunications service delivery platforms. It reuses the concepts of network abstraction and access agnostic delivery pattern to ensure equitable access to digital content and services. Such a <b>delivery</b> <b>mechanism</b> would be able to capitalize on available technological capabilities of resource-constrained communities.

40|$|Information and Communication Technology for Development (ICT 4 D) is an {{emerging}} research {{area that is}} concerned with the beneficial applications of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) to achieve developmental goals. ICT 4 D is thus concerned with designing and developing innovative technologies for resource-constrained environments for applications in key areas of social development such as health, agriculture and education. The ICT 4 D initiatives, therefore, are driving three main tasks, namely developing the required infrastructure (connectivity, electricity and computing devices) sustainably, building the required ICT human capacity, and providing access to digital content and services. Each of these three main thrusts necessitates innovation. This study addresses the evident lack of <b>delivery</b> <b>mechanisms</b> to facilitate access to digital content and services to end-users through the technologies that these end-users already possess. This lack of innovative <b>delivery</b> <b>mechanisms</b> is both an impediment to achieving equitable access to digital content and service and an opportunity to innovate. Therefore, drawing from the theoretical background of ICT 4 D, this study develops a set of technical and socio-technical requirements that the missing <b>delivery</b> <b>mechanisms</b> should satisfy. The study also explores the Service Delivery Platform (SDP) concept as a technically viable basis for the required <b>delivery</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> The study then develops a conceptual model of an Access-Technology-Agnostic <b>Delivery</b> <b>Mechanism</b> as a possible <b>delivery</b> <b>mechanism</b> that facilitates equitable access to digital content and services within an ICT 4 D context. The relevance of the conceptual model is established and, through a prototype implementation, the technical feasibility and utility of the conceptual model is demonstrated. The conceptual model is demonstrated through a proof of concept implementation using standards-based open source technologies. The proof of concept clearly demonstrates that the access-technology-agnostic delivery of digital content and services is achievable, thus making the same service accessible through different access technologies. In developing the Access-Technology-Agnostic <b>Delivery</b> <b>Mechanism,</b> this study contributes through innovation to providing access to digital content and services in an access-technology-agnostic manner...|$|R

The proposed mechanism, based on the identification of causal relations among information units of one or several streams, is designed to ensure that these causal relations, expressed at the user's level, are satisfied when delivering the streams. The conditional <b>delivery</b> <b>mechanism</b> is analyzed in depth and both informal and formal specifications of the mechanism are provided.

40|$|The {{emergence}} of the Internet has made many institutions involved {{in the delivery of}} distance education programs re-evaluate the course delivery framework. A variety of models and techniques co-exist in an often uneasy alliance at many such institutions. These range from the traditional distance learning model, which remains paper-based, to the purely online model. Recently, hybrid models have emerged which apparently attempt to forge elements taken from several models into a unified whole. Many of these hybrid models seek to eliminate paper-based materials from the tuition process. While many arguments are put forward about the efficacy of purely electronic <b>delivery</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> cost containment is often the driving motivation. This study explores student perceptions of the various <b>delivery</b> <b>mechanisms</b> for distance learning materials. In particular, it seeks to determine what value students place on paper-based <b>delivery</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> The study surveys a group of undergraduate students and a group of graduate students enrolled in the Faculty of Business at a large regional Australian university...|$|R
