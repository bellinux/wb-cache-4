40|$|Idiomatic {{expressions}} are linguistic expressions, grammatical forms, phrases {{or words}} that are used conventionally and possess a figurative meaning which cannot be predicted from the individual components or literal meanings of the constituent parts. These expressions {{play an important role}} in human communication, since their emotive and cultural connotations facilitate the expression of meaning at both linguistic and cultural levels. This linguistic phenomenon has attracted the attention of many researchers in Arabic and English. However, unlike previous studies which concentrated on Classical Arabic idioms in the Holy Qur’an and Hadith, this thesis focuses on a sample of Modern Standard Arabic idiomatic expressions taken from the Saudi-based newspaper Al-Riyadh in order to investigate their structure and grammatical relations, and to analyse a range of factors relating to context, namely co-text, situational context, and cultural context. The study also explores how these idioms are cohesive to their context. This study has two main objectives. The first is to explore idioms in the Saudi press from a structural perspective by examining structural patterns in the data sample and analysing both the internal and external grammatical relations which occur when idiomatic expressions are used within the text of Al-Riyadh. In addition, the possible variations within idiomatic expressions which were found in the newspaper discourse will also be examined in order to determine what they reveal about the limits of the textual flexibility of this linguistic phenomenon. The second objective is to textualise and contextualise idiomatic expressions in a sample of randomly selected texts to examine how idioms are cohesive with <b>their</b> <b>co-text</b> and assess the role of co-text in the interpretation of the meaning of idioms. On the level of context, the study examines the situational and cultural context for some selected idioms within the sample to determine the degree of correlation between idioms, context and culture. Adopting a text linguistics approach, a sample consisting of some 440 idioms that appeared in Al-Riyadh was analysed in the structural study, focusing on Arabic syntax and grammatical structures. The study also utilised fixedness and compositional/non-compositional approaches when investigating structural variations. Halliday and Hasan’s model of cohesiveness was applied to the analysis of this feature in the idiomatic expressions. Halliday and Hasan’s concepts of context of situation and context of culture proved useful when analysing the co-text, situational and cultural context of idiomatic expressions in the newspaper sample. The study found that nearly half of the overall structures analysed were verbal patterns. Moreover, idioms were found to display the same structural and grammatical relations as other linguistic units. Despite the shortage of structural variations in idiomatic expressions, some noticeable changes were observed within idiom structures which enable them to fit into their context. The study also found that idiomatic expressions are cohesive and are connected to <b>their</b> <b>co-text</b> by means of lexical and grammatical cohesive devices. Finally, the analysis demonstrated that internal context (co-text) and border context (situation and culture) played an important role in determining the meaning of idiomatic expressions. ...|$|E
40|$|As {{part of a}} {{study of}} lecture {{functions}} in general and highlighting devices in specific, this paper presents the findings of {{an investigation into the}} discourse functions of basic wh-cleft clauses in a corpus of lectures. These clauses, such as What our brains do is complicated information processing, are identifying constructions which background the information in the relative clause (What our brains do) and present the information foregrounded in the complement (complicated information processing) as newsworthy. Corpus-based studies of this construction to date have mainly described its function in writing (Collins 1991, Herriman 2003 & 2004) and spontaneous speech (Collins 1991 & 2006). From his examination of wh-clefts in speech and writing, Collins (1991 : 214) concludes that ‘the linear progression from explicitly represented non-news to news offers speakers an extended opportunity to formulate the message’, while Biber et al (1999 : 963) note that in conversation, speakers may use this construction with its typically low information content as ‘a springboard in starting an utterance’. With regard to academic speech, Rowley-Jolivet & Carter-Thomas (2003) found that basic wh-clefts are particularly effective in conference presentations to highlight the New and that their apparent ‘underlying presupposed question’ (p. 57) adds a dialogic dimension to monologic speech. All these features suggest that wh-clefts may be a useful in lectures, which are typically monologic and mainly concerned with imparting information. So far, however, studies on the function of these clefts in lectures have generally focussed on the function of part of the wh-clause as a lexical bundle (Biber 2006, Nesi & Basturkmen 2006) and mostly discussed its role as a discourse organising device. For the current investigation, a corpus of 12 lectures drawn from the British Academic Spoken English (BASE) Corpus were analysed. This yielded 132 basic wh-clefts, which were classified for their main discourse functions based on the presence of certain lexico-grammatical features, the functional relationship between the clefts and <b>their</b> <b>co-text</b> and an understanding of the purposes of and disciplinary variation within the lecture genre. Four main functional categories thus emerged: informing, evaluating, discourse organizing, evaluating and managing the class. These functions of wh-clefts and their relative frequency are discussed and related to lecture purposes; incidental findings on their co-occurrence with pauses and discourse markers are also touched upon. The study of this highlighting device in a lecture corpus thus aims to contribute to our understanding of what happens in authentic lectures and how this is reflected in the language.

30|$|The {{first issue}} is to {{determine}} whether to operate with individual words or with longer units (phrases/sentences) when annotating cases of appraisal. Appraisal analysis has {{to be connected to}} particular instances of language that are countable, otherwise there is a risk that the analysis relies on the general “feel” of the text instead of being grounded on concrete findings. This is also what Geoff Thompson (2014) is wary of and thus he puts much emphasis on the actual wording when categorising cases of appraisal. I agree with Thompson about tying the analysis to the level of wording, which {{does not mean that the}} annotations should be restricted to individual words or noun phrases. Prototypical examples of appraisal usually focus on depicting these isolated instances; however, more often than not an evaluation is carried by a longer unit within which it is not possible to identify only one evaluative lexical item but in which the whole sentence, for example, conveys an evaluative stance. My analysis thus deals with coherent units of meaning that connect cases of appraisal to <b>their</b> <b>co-texts.</b>|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} way in which {{cultural}} elements are rendered in subtitling by analyzing the translation of culture-specific references, such as proper names, with the case studies from three American and Thai films: Annie Hall (1977), Juno (2007), and The Iron Ladies (2000). The structure of this research is based on Toury (1995) ’s Descriptive Translation Studies framework. The methodology consists of 1) situating the preliminary norms of Audiovisual Translation in Thailand, which includes the overview of foreign film import and screen translation practice; 2) proceeding to analyse the cultural transfer strategies used in the subtitles in relations to <b>their</b> polysemiotic <b>co-texts</b> and contexts and present descriptive examples; and 3) from the analysis results, comparing the ways American and Thai culture is transferred/transformed to the target audience and explaining the significance. This research aims to take interdisciplinary approach into subtitling, in hope that it will bring more insights about Audiovisual Translation not only as a language transfer, but also as a complex socio-cultural activity, surrounded by norms and many influencing factors. Therefore, the study will combine text analysis and interviews with translation practitioners in order to present subtitling in the real world situation...|$|R
40|$|Corpora of spoken {{texts are}} {{commonly}} investigated by applying approaches {{borrowed from the}} investigation of corpora of written texts, {{partly due to the}} lack of adequate concordancing software tools. This common practice has somewhat limited the potential spoken texts bring to the study of oral discourse. Based on the theoretical and technical innovations which have taken place in the field of multimodal corpus linguistics (Baldry and Thibault, 2001; 2006 a; 2006 b; forthcoming), especially within the MCA project (Baldry, 2007 b; 2008 a; Baldry and Thibault, 2008), this thesis presents an alternative method for analysing spoken corpora for language functions and notions (van Ek and Trim, 1998 a; 1998 b; 2001). In particular, it applies the scalar-level approach developed within multimodal corpus linguistics to a corpus of 52 texts, carefully selected from the Padova Multimedia English Corpus (Ackerley and Coccetta, 2007 a; 2007 b), and demon-strates how this approach to text analysis facilitates the study of language functions and notions vis-à-vis <b>their</b> multimodal <b>co-text</b> (Baldry, 2008 a). To illustrate this, the online multimodal concordancer MCA (Multimodal Corpus Authoring System) (Baldry, 2005; Baldry and Beltrami, 2005) was used to create, annotate and concordance the corpus in terms of functions and notions, as well as non-verbal features including gestures, dynamics and gaze. The findings of this research have been applied to English language teaching and learning by creating interactive activities illustrating the way in which corpora of spoken texts and multimodal concordancing techniques can be used by language learners and teaching material developers alike. The activities have been included in the online English course Le@rning Links (Ackerley, 2004; Ackerley and Cloke, 2005; Ackerley, Cloke and Mazurelle, 2006; Ackerley and Cloke, 2006; Ackerley and Coccetta, in press) ...|$|R
