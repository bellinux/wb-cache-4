5|$|Howling Bells are {{notable for}} a doom-and-gloom, country-and-rock music style, {{and they have}} been {{labelled}} as melodic blues and country-goth. They are influenced by The Beatles and Jimi Hendrix, and <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>often</b> compared to Mazzy Star and The Velvet Underground. Their fourth album, Heartstrings, was released in June 2014.|$|E
5|$|Structural {{coloration}} is {{the production}} of colour by microscopically structured surfaces fine enough to interfere with visible light, sometimes in combination with pigments. For example, peacock tail feathers are pigmented brown, but their microscopic structure makes them also reflect blue, turquoise, and green light, and <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>often</b> iridescent.|$|E
5|$|The cisticolas {{and allies}} are family of about 110 small {{passerine}} birds found mainly in warmer southern {{regions of the}} Old World. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>often</b> included within the Old World warbler family Sylviidae. One species reaches Tasmania.|$|E
5000|$|<b>They</b> <b>were</b> {{once known}} as “stink birds”, because <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>often</b> chosen over quail by hunting dogs.|$|R
50|$|Gardes-de-cercle {{supported}} the European officer. Gardes-de-cercle were Africans used as auxiliary policemen to support local colonial administrators. Since <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>often</b> {{called upon to}} arrest people and to compel them to supply forced labor, the French usually recruited them from outside the cercle where they served. As a consequence, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>often</b> disliked and distrusted by the local inhabitants, even though <b>they</b> <b>were</b> Africans.|$|R
50|$|Fans of {{the show}} <b>were</b> <b>often</b> {{frustrated}} by the erratic scheduling {{of the show}}. Although blocks or series of the show <b>were</b> filmed together, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>often</b> not shown together, as with other series. Instead <b>they</b> <b>were</b> fitted into the schedule whenever there was a gap, meaning that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>often</b> not shown in consecutive weeks or on one set night of the week. Often months passed between episodes of the same series being shown.|$|R
5|$|The family Charadriidae {{includes}} the plovers, dotterels and lapwings. They are small- to medium-sized birds with compact bodies, short, thick necks and long, usually pointed, wings. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>often</b> found in open country worldwide, mostly in habitats near water. In Tasmania, ten {{species have been}} recorded, three of which are vagrants.|$|E
5|$|The {{intermittent}} Roman {{presence in}} Scotland {{coincided with the}} emergence of the Picts, a confederation of tribes who lived {{to the north of the}} Forth and Clyde from Roman times until the 10th century. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>often</b> assumed to have been the descendants of the Caledonians though the evidence for this connection is circumstantial and the name by which the Picts called themselves is unknown. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>often</b> said to have tattooed themselves, but evidence for this is limited. Naturalistic depictions of Pictish nobles, hunters and warriors, male and female, without obvious tattoos, are found on their monumental stones. The Gaels of Dalriada called the Picts Cruithne, and Irish poets portrayed their Pictish counterparts as very much like themselves.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} more {{mushroom}} species that are harvested from the wild for personal consumption or commercial sale. Milk mushrooms, morels, chanterelles, truffles, black trumpets, and porcini mushrooms (Boletus edulis) (also known as king boletes) demand a high price on the market. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>often</b> used in gourmet dishes.|$|E
50|$|Baked {{potatoes}} <b>are</b> <b>often</b> eaten on Guy Fawkes Night; traditionally <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>often</b> {{baked in}} the glowing embers of a bonfire.|$|R

50|$|When {{they served}} witches, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>often</b> thought to <b>be</b> malevolent, while when working for cunning folk <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>often</b> {{thought of as}} benevolent (although there was some {{ambiguity}} in both cases). The former <b>were</b> <b>often</b> categorised as demons, while the latter were more commonly thought of and described as fairies. The main purpose of familiars is to serve the witch or young witch, providing protection for them as they come into their new powers.|$|R
5|$|Amazon river dolphins, {{known by}} the natives as the boto or encantados, are very {{prevalent}} in the mythology of the native South Americans. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>often</b> characterized in their mythology as wielding superior musical ability, their seductiveness and love of sex, often resulting in illegitimate children, and their attraction to parties. Despite {{the fact that the}} Encante are said to come from a utopia full of wealth and without pain or death, the encantados crave the pleasures and hardships of human societies.|$|E
5|$|Apples are an {{important}} ingredient in many desserts, such as apple pie, apple crumble, apple crisp and apple cake. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>often</b> eaten baked or stewed, and {{they can also be}} dried and eaten or reconstituted (soaked in water, alcohol or some other liquid) for later use. When cooked, some apple cultivars easily form a puree known as apple sauce. Apples are also made into apple butter and apple jelly. They are also used (cooked) in meat dishes.|$|E
5|$|Because banded sea kraits {{spend much}} of their time on land, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>often</b> {{encountered}} by humans. They are frequently found in the water intake and exhaust pipes of boats. Banded sea kraits are also attracted to light and can be distracted by artificial sources of light, including hotels and other buildings, on coasts.|$|E
50|$|The violent street {{culture as}} {{necessary}} {{for them to}} gain respect within their own marginalized groups. Many of the drug dealers did, in fact, want to enter the legal workforce, however, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>often</b> subject to prejudice and with their lack of education and gap in employment history when <b>they</b> <b>were</b> selling drugs, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>often</b> rejected or could only get jobs at minimum wage. Many subsequently returned to the drug trade.|$|R
50|$|Paniyas {{were also}} {{historically}} reputed for their boldness and recklessness. For this reason, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>often</b> employed as thieves.|$|R

5|$|Bourekas are savory {{pastries}} {{brought to}} Israel by Jews from Turkey, the Balkans and Salonika. They {{are made of}} a flaky dough {{in a variety of}} shapes, frequently topped with sesame seeds, and are filled with meat, chickpeas, cheese, spinach, potatoes or mushrooms. Bourekas are sold at kiosks, supermarkets and cafes, and are served at functions and celebrations, as well as being prepared by home cooks. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>often</b> served as a light meal with hardboiled eggs and chopped vegetable salad.|$|E
5|$|Bridging the {{age when}} gods lived alone and {{the age when}} divine {{interference}} in human affairs was limited was a transitional age in which gods and mortals moved together. These were {{the early days of}} the world when the groups mingled more freely than they did later. Most of these tales were later told by Ovid's Metamorphoses and <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>often</b> divided into two thematic groups: tales of love, and tales of punishment.|$|E
5|$|Common {{over most}} of its range in woodland, the common {{blackbird}} has a preference for deciduous trees with dense undergrowth. However, gardens provide the best breeding habitat with up to 7.3 pairs per hectare (nearly three pairs per acre), with woodland typically holding about a tenth of that density, and open and very built-up habitats even less. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>often</b> replaced by the related ring ouzel in areas of higher altitude.. The common blackbird also lives in parks, gardens and hedgerows.|$|E

50|$|While churchyards {{can be any}} {{patch of}} land on church grounds, historically, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>often</b> used as graveyards (burial places).|$|R
5|$|Cultured mysids {{are thought}} to provide an ideal food source for many marine organisms. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>often</b> fed to cephalopods, fish larvae, and {{commercial}} farmed shrimp due to their small size and low cost. Their high protein and fat content also makes them a good alternative to live enriched Artemia when feeding juveniles (especially those {{that are difficult to}} maintain such as young seahorses) and other small fauna.|$|E
5|$|Edible {{mushrooms}} are well-known examples of fungi. Many are commercially raised, but others must be harvested from the wild. Agaricus bisporus, sold as button mushrooms when small or Portobello mushrooms when larger, is a commonly eaten species, used in salads, soups, {{and many other}} dishes. Many Asian fungi are commercially grown and have increased in popularity in the West. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>often</b> available fresh in grocery stores and markets, including straw mushrooms (Volvariella volvacea), oyster mushrooms (Pleurotus ostreatus), shiitakes (Lentinula edodes), and enokitake (Flammulina spp.).|$|E
5|$|Fourth Degree Knights may {{optionally}} {{purchase and}} wear the full regalia and join an assembly's Color Corps. The Color Corps {{is the most}} visible arm of the Knights, as <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>often</b> seen in parades and other local events wearing their colorful regalia. Official dress for the Color Corps is a black tuxedo, baldric, white gloves, cape, and naval chapeau. In warm climates and during warm months, a white dinner jacket may be worn, if done as a unit.|$|E
