50|$|The {{microwave}} radiometer made three scans of Venus in 35 minutes on December 14, 1962 starting at 18:59 UTC. The first scan {{was made on}} the dark side, the second was near the terminator, and the third was located on the light side. The scans with the 19 mm band revealed peak temperatures of 490 ± 11 K on the dark side, 595 ± 12 K near the terminator, and 511 ± 14 K on the light side.

5000|$|The {{realisation}} of {{the planned}} [...] "mainline replacement line" [...] between Roth and Fischbach through the Nuremberg Reichswald (imperial forest) would have relieved the Nuremberg-Roth line and thus made room for S-Bahn services on the existing double track line. After the adjacent municipalities and citizens groups expressed opposition to the Reichswald route, the Nuremberg BD examined the plans between 1980 and 1985 on behalf of Deutsche Bundesbahn. At the same time, the BD proposed {{the construction of a}} new line from Nuremberg to Ingolstadt as an alternative option, which was politically popular, except in Augsburg and the adjacent municipalities of Swabia. As a result, a further report was commissioned on this proposal, which delayed the S-Bahn plans again. Planning could only resume for S-Bahn line S 3 in June 1991, after the completion of this report, which supported a new line. <b>This</b> <b>also</b> <b>supported</b> a separate, double-track line, running parallel to the Nuremberg-Augsburg line, which would be modified to run as a single-track line.|$|E
50|$|Before {{coming to}} Belzec, Wirth became {{acquainted with the}} gas vans in {{operation}} in Chełmno and in the eastern occupied territories of the Soviet Union and learned their advantages and disadvantages. This experience in euthanasia, where permanent gas chambers had existed, and with the gas vans inspired his solution. He decided to combine in Belzec the permanent gas chamber with the internal combustion car engine as gas supplier. Wirth objected to the bottles of carbon monoxide gas {{that had been used}} in euthanasia institutions. The bottles, which were produced in private factories and which would be supplied to Belzec in large quantities, could arouse suspicion. In addition, the factories were located at great distances from Belzec and the steady supply of the bottles might cause a logistical problem. Wirth preferred to set up a self-contained extermination system, based on an ordinary car engine and easily available gasoline and not dependent on supply by outside factors...Wirth carried out experiments to determine the most efficient method of handling the transports of Jews from the time of their arrival at the camp until their murder and burial. He developed some basic concepts for the process of extermination and for camp structure. The basic structure of the camp and the various actions the victims were made to do as soon as they left the train were intended to ensure that they would not grasp {{the fact that they had}} been brought for extermination. The aim was to give the victims the impression that they had arrived at a labor camp or a transit camp from where they would be sent to a labor camp. The deportees were to believe this until they were closed into the gas chambers camouflaged as baths.The second principle of the extermination process was that everything should be carried out with the utmost speed. The victims should be rushed, made to run, so that they had no time to look round, to reflect, or to understand what was going on. <b>This</b> <b>also</b> <b>supported</b> the basic principle of deceiving the victims. They should be shocked, and their reactions paralyzed in order to prevent escape or resistance. The speed of the extermination process served yet an additional purpose: it increased the killing capacity of the camp. More transports could be brought and annihilated in one day.According to Wirth's annihilation scheme, the Jews themselves should carry out all physical work involved in the extermination process of a transport...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{the contributions of}} intestine and plasma to the presystemic bioconversion of vicagrel, and track its subsequent bioconversion to 2 -oxo-clopidogrel in vivo and in vitro to rationalize the design of vicagrel, an acetate analogue of clopidogrel. Methods: The concentration-time profiles of 2 -oxo-clopidogrel and active metabolite (AM) in presystem and circulation system was determined in the cannulated rats. Also, the rat intestinal S 9 and human intestinal microsomes were conducted to examine the formation of 2 -oxo-clopidogrel and AM. Meanwhile, the esterases in plasma and intestinal fractions responsible for the bioconversion of vicagrel to 2 -oxo-clopidogrel were screened by the esterase inhibition and recombinant esterases. Results: The intestine {{was responsible for the}} formation of 2 -oxo-clopidogrel and AM in vivo and in vitro, where carboxylesterases 2 (CE 2) contributed greatly to the vicagrel cleavage during absorption. Other related esterases in plasma were paraoxonases (PON), carboxylesterases 1 (CE 1) and butyrylcholine esterases (BChE). Conclusion: The findings rationalized the prodrug design hypothesis that vicagrel could overcome the extensive invalid hydrolysis of clopidogrel by the hepatic CE 1 but experience the extensive hydrolysis to 2 -oxo-clopidogrel and subsequent oxidation to AM in the intestine. <b>This</b> <b>also</b> <b>supported</b> the theory of improved pharmacological activity through facilitated formation of 2 -oxo-clopidogrel, thus warranting much needed future clinical pharmacokinetic studies of vicagrel...|$|E
40|$|We {{questioned}} the different interpretations of ecological sexual segregation from a novel perspective, i. e., by carrying out diverse {{temporal and spatial}} scale analyses within a long-term study (1984 – 2003). Thus we combined spatial (small/large) and temporal (small/large) scale analyses to identify the factors generating sexual segregation in fallow deer in San Rossore, Italy. The study site was divided into an eastern sector characterized by human disturbance (DS) and a western undisturbed sector (US). According to census data, human presence increased in DS from 1984, and while females gradually abandoned it, males remained—thus supporting the predation risk hypothesis (large spatial and temporal scale) —and actually increased their presence in DS, where they seemingly benefited from a lower female density. This supported the indirect competition hypothesis. The analysis of data on a large temporal and small spatial scale confirmed that intersexual competition, in particular for grass, was higher in a crowded pasture in US. Observations by means of radio-telemetry of 23 adult females and 25 adult males (1997 – 2001, reduced temporal and large spatial scale) showed that large scale segregation was relevant {{during the day and}} disappeared at night, when disturbance was absent and also the females reached DS. <b>This</b> <b>also</b> <b>supported</b> the predation risk hypothesis. Moreover, sexes showed different habitat choices inside DS at night, thus supporting the forage selection hypothesis (small spatial and temporal scale). In conclusion, failure to address the whole set of combinations of spatial and temporal scale analyses would have led to monocausal explanations of ecological sexual segregation...|$|E
40|$|A {{significant}} factor, {{where are}} the major elements e. g. Mg, Fe, Si, Al, Ca, P, Ni {{that make up the}} asteroid or comet after the impact, has been ignored since the proposal of the impact events. In a striking contrast, there are many remaining unanswered or poorly answered questions regarding the formation and nature of banded iron formation (BIF), iron stone, phosphorite, bedded manganese ore, dolomite and carbonaceous black shales. The appearance of Lake Superior type banded ion formation associated with dolomite, quartzite, and black shale, the deposition of manganese ore and the occurrence of large phosphate repository during the Plaeoproterozoic; the onset of BIF with phosphate deposition and sedimentary manganese deposits and cap dolomite during the Neoproterozoic; the penecontemporary formation of oolitic iron stone taking place of the BIF, bedded manganese deposit, phosphorite, dolomite, and black shale during the Phanerozoic, which suggest a genetic link among them from the perspective of chemical elements. Actually, during hypervelocity impact cratering events, {{the main part of the}} asteroid or comet and target material are vaporizing, which forms a mushroom cloud of vapor in the atmosphere. &#x 3000;The previous study shows that the calcite, magnetite, clay minerals and organic compounds condense from a solar gas at 10 &#x 2212; 4 atm with temperature less than 400 K, which provides an analog for the generation of the chemical sedimentary ore deposits. <b>This</b> <b>also</b> <b>supported</b> by table isotopes fractionation at small sacle (grain size, cm scale), all stable isotopes fractionation e. g. (Cr, Fe, S, Si, O,C) and mass-independent fractionation of sulphur isotopes following the rule of isotope fractionation during impacts: the earlier the condensed material, the more enriched in lighter isotopes. Thus, the impact of the asteroid or comet provides not only the elements source of chemical sedimentary ore deposits and the mechanism for their formation. The enrichment in iridium in BIFs and their associated impact spherule units are the other evidence to demonstrate that BIFs are the products of impacts. Impacts produce black shale, banded iron formation, limestone and dolomite. Based on the coeval sub-continental lithosphere mantle (SCLM) formation, juvenile crust generation, banded iron formations, mantle plumes and black shale, it seems that impacts maybe the driving force for Earth...|$|E

40|$|The {{population}} of northern Sweden {{has previously been}} shown to be well suited for the mapping of monogenic diseases. In this thesis we have tested the hypothesis that this population could also be used for efficient identification of risk genes for common diseases. In Paper I we have hypothesised that despite the admixture of Swedish, Finnish and Sami, the northern Swedish population consists of sub-populations geographically restricted by the main river valleys running through the region. This geographic isolation, in combination with founder effects and genetic drift, could represent a unique resource for genetic studies. On the other hand, it also underlines the importance of accounting for this e. g. in genetic association studies. To test this hypothesis, we studied the patterns of marriage within and between river valley regions and compared allelic frequencies of genetic markers between these regions. The tendency to find a spouse and live in the river valley where one was born is strong, and allelic frequencies of genetic markers vary significantly between adjacent regions. These data support our hypothesis that the river valleys are home to distinct sub-populations and that this is likely to affect mapping of genetic diseases in these populations. In Paper II, we tested the applicability of the population in mapping HSAN V, a monogenic disease. This disease was identified in only three consanguineous individuals suffering from a severe loss of deep pain perception and an impaired perception of heat. A genome-wide scan combined with sequencing of candidate genes resulted in the identification of a causative point mutation in the nerve growth factor beta (NGFB) gene. In Paper III, a large family with multiple members affected by familial forms of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T 1 DM) and autoimmune thyroiditis (AITD) was studied. This syndrome was mapped to the IDDM 12 region on 2 q 33, giving positive lodscores when conditioning on HLA haplotype. The linkage to HLA and to the IDDM 12 region thus confirmed previous reports of linkage and/or association of T 1 DM and AITD to these loci and provided evidence that the same genetic factors may be mediating these diseases. <b>This</b> <b>also</b> <b>supported</b> the feasibility of mapping complex diseases in northern Sweden by the use of familial forms of these diseases. In Paper IV, we applied the same approach to study type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM). A non-parametric genome-wide scan was carried out on a family material from northern Sweden, and linkage was found to the calpain- 10 locus, a previously described T 2 DM-susceptibility gene on 2 q 37. Together, these findings demonstrate that selecting for familial forms of even complex diseases, and choosing families from the same geographical region can efficiently reduce the genetic heterogeneity of the disease and facilitate the identification of risk genes for the disease...|$|E
40|$|Group IVA {{is a large}} magmatic {{group of}} iron meteorites. The mean DELTA O- 17 (= delta O- 17 - 0. 52 (raised dot) delta O- 18) of the silicates is approx. plus or minus 1. 2 %o, similar to the highest values in L chondrites and the lowest values in LL chondrites; delta O- 18 values {{are also in the}} L/LL range. This {{strongly}} suggests that IVA irons formed by melting L-LL parental material, but the mean Ni content of IVA irons (83 mg/g) is much lower than that of a presumed L-LL parent (approx. 170 mg/g) and the low-Ca pyroxene present in two IVA meteorites is Fs 13, much lower than the Fs 20 - 29 values in L and LL chondrites. Thus, formation from L-LL precursors requires extensive addition of metallic Fe, probably produced by reduction of FeS and FeO. Group IVA also has S/Ni, Ga/Ni, and Ge/Ni ratios that are much lower than those in L-LL chondrites or any chondrite group that preserves nebular compositions, implying loss of these volatile elements during asteroidal processing. We suggest that these reduction and loss processes occurred near the surface of the asteroid during impact heating, and resulted partly from reduction by C, and partly from the thermal dissociation of FeS and FeO with loss of O and S. The hot (approx. 1770 K) low-viscosity melt quickly moved through channels in the porous asteroid to form a core. Two members of the IVA group, Sao Joao Nepomuceno (hereafter, SJN) and Steinbach, contain moderate amounts of orthopyroxene and silica, and minor amounts of low-Ca clinopyroxene. Even though SJN formed after approx. 26 % crystallization and Steinbach formed after approx. 77 % Crystallization of the IVA core, both could have originated within several tens of meters of the core-mantle interface if 99 % of the crystallization occurred from the center outwards. Two other members of the group (Gibeon and Bishop Canyon) contain tabular tridymite, which we infer to have initially formed as veins deposited from a cooling SiO-rich vapor. The silicates were clearly introduced into IVA irons after the initial magma crystallized. Because the y-iron crystals in SJN are typically about 5 cm across, an order of magnitude smaller than in IVA irons that do not contain massive silicates, we infer that the metal was in the gamma-iron field when the silicates were injected. The SJN and Steinbach silicate compositions are near the low-Ca-pyroxene/silica eutectic compositions. We suggest that a tectonic event produced a eutectic-like liquid and injected it together with unmelted pyroxene grains into fissures in the solid metal core. Published estimates of IVA metallographic cooling rates range from 20 to 3000 K/Ma, leading to a hypothesized breakup of the core during a major impact followed by scrambling of the core and mantle debris [Haack, H., Scott, E. R. D., Love, S. G., Brearley, A. 1996. Thermal histories of IVA stony-iron and iron meteorites: evidence for asteroid fragmentation and reaccretion. Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta 60, 3103 - 3113]. This scrambling model is physically implausible and cannot explain the strong correlation of estimated cooling rates with metal composition. Previous workers concluded that the low-Ca clinopyroxene in SJN and Steinbach formed from protopyroxene by quenching at a cooling rate of 10 (sup 12) K/Ma, and suggested that <b>this</b> <b>also</b> <b>supported</b> an impact-scrambling model. This implausible spike in cooling rate by a factor of 10 (sup 10) can be avoided if the low-Ca clinopyroxene were formed by a late shock event that converted orthopyroxene to clinopyroxene followed by minimal growth in the clinopyroxene field, probably because melt was also produced. We suggest that metallographic cooling-rate estimates (e. g., based on island taenite) giving similar values throughout the metal compositional range are more plausible, and that the IVA parent asteroid can be modeled by monotonic cooling followed by a high-temperature impact event that introduced silicates into the metal and a low-temperature impact event that partially converted thopyroxene into low-Ca clinopyroxene...|$|E
