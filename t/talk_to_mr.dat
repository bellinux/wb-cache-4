The quartet's back-and-forth, which centered on Stern's recent public performance of a Mendelssohn piece, was heard on an episode first broadcast on February 16, 1947. The resulting laughter lasted some 18 seconds, after which Benny retorted, [...] "Mary, that's no way to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>Mr.</b> Stern." ...|$|E
60|$|JAMES. It's {{a matter}} of form; but I can't stand upon niceness over a thing like this--too serious. Just <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>Mr.</b> Cowley.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{think you}} should <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>Mr.</b> Allinson in that manner, Jim. He's a good deal older and more {{experienced}} than you are." ...|$|E
60|$|Corona <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>Mr.</b> Archibald. It was her custom always <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> the {{principal}} personage of a party.|$|R

6000|$|... "Nothing discouraging," [...] he replied. [...] "I don't {{think she}} minded at all. I have decided, {{if you give}} me permission, to go and <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>Mr.</b> Fentolin this evening." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{appear to}} have passed through a {{complete}} chapter of mishaps," [...] she remarked. [...] "Never mind! You must want your lunch very badly, {{or do you want}} to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>Mr.</b> Ducaine?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>Mr.</b> Stobell," [...] {{said his}} wife, grimly. [...] "Fancy, poor Mrs. Stobell {{says that she}} is sure he won’t let her come. I wish he was my husband, that’s all." ...|$|E
60|$|ELLIE. Quite, quite sure. Now {{you must}} go away and leave me <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>Mrs</b> Hushabye.|$|R
60|$|LORD ILLINGWORTH. I {{was merely}} <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Allonby about the leading {{articles}} in the London newspapers.|$|R

6000|$|... "Greek!" [...] scornfully ejaculated Miss Calthea, and, {{turning her}} steely glance from the couple on the lawn, {{she began to}} <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>Mr.</b> Petter about one of his cows which had broken its leg.|$|E
6000|$|... "He will <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>Mr.</b> Roberts by {{the hour}} together. So I hear that I am to congratulate you." [...] This {{she said in a}} tone which was clearly {{intended}} to signify both condemnation and ridicule.|$|E
6000|$|... "You're in no {{condition}} to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>Mr.</b> Parr, or to anyone else, except your wife, Walks," [...] Langmaid said. [...] "You'd better go home, {{and let me}} see Mr. Parr. I'm responsible for Mr. Hodder, anyway." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>Mr</b> Lightwood,' said Lizzie, {{turning to}} him with a smile. 'But it cannot have been Society that {{disturbed}} you.' ...|$|R
60|$|In {{the next}} room, meanwhile, Wilfrid was <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Thornbury with greater freedom {{now that his}} wife was not sitting there.|$|R
6000|$|She did {{not seem}} {{surprised}} or concerned at that. [...] "Imogene, I have been <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>Mr.</b> Colville about you and Mr. Morton." ...|$|R
60|$|At five the {{sun went}} under. I {{remember}} that Madame was lolling listless in the garden, daintily arrayed in fine linen, trying to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>Mr.</b> Mason, when a sound startled us. It {{was the sound of}} swift hoof beats on the soft drive.|$|E
60|$|The {{helpless}} Mr. Ketchmaid {{suffered in}} silence, with {{his eye on}} the clock, and almost danced with impatience at the tardiness of his departing guests. He accompanied the last man to the door, and then, crimson with rage, returned to the bar to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>Mr.</b> Wiggett.|$|E
6000|$|... "I see," [...] said Dick, with a {{smile at}} the fellow's candor. [...] "Well, I couldn't trust you with the cement again, but we're short of a man to superintend a peon gang and I'll <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>Mr.</b> Stuyvesant about it if you'll tell me your address." ...|$|E
60|$|Leslie, an elderly, brown-faced man, sat near Prescott; the Jernynghams, who {{had driven}} over to welcome his friends, were inside, <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Leslie.|$|R
6000|$|... "Where {{have you}} been?" [...] I asked, a strange misgiving {{stealing}} into my mind. [...] "Have you been <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>Mr.</b> Ansell like this?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "One {{could almost}} have fancied {{you were not}} pleased to see us, and would sooner have <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>Mr.</b> Torrance," [...] said Miss Schuyler.|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish {{he would}} come. We expect the second post to bring the news that Mr. Esdaile has {{accepted}} the Chiltern Hundreds. If he found it so, he meant to go and <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>Mr.</b> Bramshaw; for, though he is so dull, we must make him agent." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear Kitty, I {{will come}} and stay all night on purpose," [...] said Dorothea; [...] "but I {{want to be alone}} now, and in my own home. I wish to know the Farebrothers better, and to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>Mr.</b> Farebrother about what there is to be done in Middlemarch." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{said the}} other man, who was younger. [...] "There are one or two {{complaints}} not unusual in that country which appear to somewhat resemble it, but they are seldom so virulent.

6000|$|... "Mr. Vivian Grey," [...] said Mrs. Felix Lorraine, [...] "I cannot {{understand}} why you have been <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>Mr.</b> Toad so long. Will you waltz?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Fal de ral, de ral, de ral! That's {{all very}} fine, Mr. Commissioner; only you mistake your man; {{you think you}} are <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>Mr.</b> Neverbend.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{sorry to}} say that I've come on rather a disagreeable errand," [...] the agent's son began. [...] "I've been <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Foulton about it." ...|$|R
60|$|The boy glanced away. But {{the smith}} used {{to stand behind}} the counter and <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>Mr.</b> Pappleworth. His speech was dirty, {{with a kind of}} rottenness. Again he found the youth with his cool, {{critical}} gaze fixed on his face. The smith started round {{as if he had been}} stung.|$|E
6000|$|Matt {{looked at}} the card in his hand, and read: [...] "Mr. Putney: Please <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>Mr.</b> Hilary as you would to my sister or me." [...] Suzette's printed name served for signature. Matt put the card in his pocket-book, and then he said, [...] "What sort of man is Mr. Putney, doctor?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{was missing}} twice, once {{for over a}} week," [...] Mrs. Cunningham replied. [...] "There {{are all sorts of}} stories as to how he got back to the lines.

6000|$|... "You are <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>Mr.</b> Lessingham," [...] Philippa protested, [...] "as {{though he}} were an enemy, instead of the best friend you ever had in your life." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I was not," [...] she said. [...] "I {{knew you}} were on board a ship that had just arrived. Then I heard you <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>Mr.</b> Jefferson." ...|$|R
