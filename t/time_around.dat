On the last Sunday in July, pilgrims climb Ireland's holiest {{mountain}}, Croagh Patrick (764 metres) in County Mayo. It {{is held in}} honour of Saint Patrick who, in the year 441, spent 40 days fasting on the mountain. Masses are held at the summit, {{where there is a}} small chapel. Some climb the mountain barefoot, as an act of penance, and some carry out 'rounding rituals', which were formerly {{a key part of the}} pilgrimage. This involves praying while walking sunwise around features on the mountain. They walk seven <b>times</b> <b>around</b> the cairn of Leacht Benáin (Benan's grave), fifteen <b>times</b> <b>around</b> the circular perimeter of the summit, seven <b>times</b> <b>around</b> Leaba Phádraig (Patrick's bed), and then seven <b>times</b> <b>around</b> three ancient cairns known as Reilig Mhuire (Mary's cemetery).|$|R
