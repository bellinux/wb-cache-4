5|$|Maurício Gugelmin (born 20 April 1963 in Joinville) is {{a former}} racing driver from Brazil. He took part in both Formula One and <b>the</b> <b>Champ</b> Car World Series. He participated in 80 Formula One grands prix, debuting in 1988 for the March team. He {{achieved}} one top-three finish and scored a total of ten championship points in the series. He competed in <b>the</b> <b>Champ</b> Car series between 1993 and 2001, starting 147 races. He won one race, in 1997 in Vancouver, finishing fourth in the championship that year. His best result in the Indianapolis 500 was in 1995 where he started and finished in sixth position, leading 59 laps. For a period, he held the world speed record for a closed race track, set at California Speedway in 1997 at a speed of 240.942mph (387.759km/h). Gugelmin retired {{at the end of}} 2001 after a year that included the death of his son.|$|E
5|$|To satisfy {{military}} requirements, {{the network}} extended <b>the</b> <b>Champ</b> de Courses track to the Château du Madrillet, headquarters {{of an important}} BEF base. It also built a connection to transport the injured arriving by train at the Gare Saint-Sever to the main hospitals of Rouen. These installations, constructed in record time, disappeared when the war ended.|$|E
5|$|In March 1950 the {{municipality}} decided definitely {{to close the}} tramway, but its actual closure came somewhat later. It was not until Saturday, 28 February 1953 that the last tram ran on <b>the</b> <b>Champ</b> de Courses line, 76 years after the network's first service. But the Rouennaise did not forget the tram's services rendered, organising a first-class funeral: Just before the last scheduled run, a parade of honour made up of three trams ran from the Hôtel de ville to the Trianon depot, cheered by the crowds.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> Fucking <b>Champs</b> are a three-piece {{progressive}} {{rock band}} from San Francisco, California. They {{are known for}} their heavy metal appeal, based largely around shifting time signatures, guitar harmonies, and lots of rhythm. Most songs are instrumental. They are currently signed to Drag City. They have also collaborated with Trans Am and the two have recorded albums together as TransChamps and The Fucking Am. Founded in Santa Cruz in the early 1990s, the band was initially called <b>The</b> <b>Champs,</b> but added <b>the</b> [...] "Fucking" [...] to their name - following a brief stint as <b>The</b> <b>Champs</b> UK - because <b>The</b> <b>Champs</b> had been used by a band in the late 1950s.|$|R

5|$|Gugelmin {{signed with}} Dick Simon Racing {{to take part}} in the North American Champ Car racing series for the last three races of 1993. Although races at Mid Ohio and Nazareth {{resulted}} in non-finishes, Gugelmin finished 13th at Laguna Seca although this was not high enough to receive any points. Despite this, Gugelmin demonstrated promise. In 1994, Gugelmin signed with Chip Ganassi Racing to partner Michael Andretti who returned to the series after a season in Formula One. Andretti was more successful than Gugelmin, and took two wins, including Reynard's first win in Champ Car at Surfers Paradise. Gugelmin was hindered by a lack of cooperation between his and Andretti's crews, and his first full-time year in <b>the</b> <b>Champ</b> Car World Series resulted in seven points finishes and 16th in the points standings.|$|E
5|$|The 2010 Honda Indy Edmonton was an IndyCar motor race held on July 25, 2010 at the Edmonton City Centre Airport, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. It was the {{eleventh}} {{round of the}} 2010 IndyCar Series season, the third annual edition of the Edmonton Indy in the IndyCar Series, and the sixth anniversary running of the race (including three years on <b>the</b> <b>Champ</b> Car World Series (CCWS) schedule). The 95-lap race was won by Chip Ganassi Racing driver Scott Dixon, who started from the third position. Will Power finished second for Team Penske and Dixon's teammate Dario Franchitti came in third.|$|E
5|$|The Woods, {{which had}} been shelved for some 18 months, was {{released}} directly-to-video in October 2006. The film opened to favorable reviews and critics acclaimed the individual performances of the actors. Nichols had a small part in the drama film Resurrecting <b>the</b> <b>Champ</b> (2007), in which she played the assistant to a sportswriter (Josh Hartnett) who believes he has found a former boxing legend (Samuel L. Jackson) living homeless on the streets. Also that year, Nichols had a bit part in the fact-based political drama Charlie Wilson's War (2007) and was cast in a new science fiction drama television series Them, which was ultimately not picked up by Fox.|$|E

5000|$|The {{short-lived}} Youngstown Indians team succeeded other {{minor league}} clubs in Youngstown, Ohio, including the championship Youngstown Ohio Works and Youngstown <b>Champs.</b> <b>The</b> 1907 {{sale of the}} Ohio Works team to investors in Zanesville, Ohio, {{paved the way for}} the establishment of <b>the</b> <b>Champs.</b> Like <b>the</b> Ohio Works club, which won two consecutive league championships, <b>the</b> <b>Champs</b> were sponsored by local industrial leader Joseph A. McDonald and his brother, Thomas. <b>The</b> <b>Champs</b> won <b>the</b> 1907 championship of the Ohio-Pennsylvania League, but the following year, their season was cut short when the owners of the Youngstown franchise [...] "threw up the sponge in mid-season". In 1909, the newly established Youngstown Indians secured the backing of a stock company in New Castle, Pennsylvania, and were managed by W.R. Terry.|$|R
25|$|It was the first, {{and to this}} point, {{only time}} a Japanese driver has won a CART-sanctioned event. Those seven laps in front {{were the only ones}} Noda led all year.

25|$|Vanderbilt won its {{conference for}} the third {{straight}} year, tying with Washington & Lee for the Southern Conference championship. Most sportswriters listed the Commodores as the outright winner of the mythical Southern crown, resulting in their receiving <b>the</b> <b>Champ</b> Pickens Trophy as champions of the South. It is to date the last conference title for Vanderbilt football. The team suffered losses to the national champion Michigan Wolverines and the undefeated Texas Longhorns.|$|E
25|$|By 2003, Ganassi, Penske and Andretti Green all {{defected}} to the IRL permanently. CART went bankrupt {{later in the}} year, and its rights and infrastructure were purchased by remaining car owners, and it became <b>the</b> <b>Champ</b> Car World Series. The two series continued to operate separately through 2007. In early 2008, the two series were unified to create a single open wheel championship after a 12-year split being run under Indy Racing League/IMS controlknown as the IndyCar Series.|$|E
