Computational software for stability lobes and measurement devices are proposed but, in spite of widespread publicity, they remain relatively rarely used. Lastly, vibration sensors are often integrated into machining centers but they are used mainly for wear diagnosis of the tools or the spindle.New Generation Tool Holders and especially the Hydraulic Expansion Tool Holders minimise the undesirable effects of vibration to a large extent. First of all, the precise control of <b>total</b> <b>indicator</b> <b>reading</b> to less than 3 micrometres helps reduce vibrations due to balanced load on cutting edges and the little vibration created thereon is absorbed largely by the oil inside the chambers of the Hydraulic Expansion Tool Holder.|$|E
40|$|The Trends in Risk Level Project (RNNP) is {{conducted}} annually by the Norwegian Petroleum Safety Authority (PSA). The purpose of RNNP is to objectively present offshore risk levels and risk trends on the Norwegian continental shelf (NCS). Major accidents and even near-misses {{have been few}} or non-existent in the time period RNNP has been conducted, and the decline in incident reports has reduced the data basis for quantitative risk assessment (QRA) considerably. RNNP presents risk levels and risk trends by establishing a <b>total</b> <b>indicator</b> which is established by evaluating major accident precursor event (DFUs) statistics. The objective of this thesis has been to develop a New <b>Total</b> <b>Indicator</b> which is able to give a more holistic risk level and risk trend presentation than the current <b>total</b> <b>indicator.</b> After developing a New <b>Total</b> <b>Indicator,</b> a case study was executed to test the quality and applicability of the methodology. The development of the New <b>Total</b> <b>Indicator</b> is based on current and newly developed methodology, utilizing existing and newly established RNNP data. The concept behind the New <b>Total</b> <b>Indicator</b> is to represent a broader risk image than its predecessor. The New <b>Total</b> <b>Indicator</b> addresses uncertainty and survey results {{in addition to the}} traditional DFU and barrier performance data, which are already a part of the RNNP risk level presentation. The New <b>Total</b> <b>Indicator</b> consists of the contribution of four individual indicators; I) DFU Indicator II) Barrier Indicator III) Survey results Indicator IV) Uncertainty Indicator. I-III are individually established, expressed as relative values. IV is a corrective factor, individually established and incorporated in indicators I-III. The New <b>Total</b> <b>Indicator</b> is presented as two relative indicators; leading (The Barrier Indicator and Survey Results Indicator) and lagging (The DFU Indicator), where the relative uncertainty contributions are incorporated in both indicators. The case study established New <b>Total</b> <b>Indicator</b> Results for years 2008 - 2014 by evaluating RNNP data from fixed production installations only. The results are considered satisfactory from a case study perspective, indicating a positive (decreasing) risk level trend for the leading indicator in the chosen time period. The lagging indicator shows a variable trend with a negative (increase) trend in risk levels from 2012 - 2014. Compared with published <b>total</b> <b>indicator</b> results; the New <b>Total</b> <b>Indicator</b> results differ considerably. This is due to their differences in structure and design, but also due to a different data basis for establishing results. The case study demonstrates the ability of the developed New <b>Total</b> <b>Indicator</b> to produce satisfactory results. The numerous data and method assumptions in this thesis question the applicability of the New <b>Total</b> <b>Indicator</b> and the quality of results. The New <b>Total</b> <b>Indicator</b> is, in its present state, not considered recommendable for implementation in RNNP. The results are satisfactory from a case study perspective, but the methodology itself needs to be developed further to reduce method uncertainty and improve the method quality. Despite the method shortcomings, it is recommended to evaluate whether the developed DFU Indicator could replace the current <b>total</b> <b>indicator</b> in RNNP. The DFU Indicator is similarly established as the current <b>total</b> <b>indicator,</b> but includes DFU 12 (helicopter incidents). In light of the tragic helicopter accident at Turøy in April this year, the suggested DFU 12 weights may be a solution for incorporating helicopter risk in the RNNP <b>total</b> <b>indicator.</b> The developed New <b>Total</b> <b>Indicator</b> methodology is an exciting contribution to the discussion on the role of overall vs. individual indicators in risk level presentation. In conclusion this thesis contributes more to the discussion on the future risk level presentation of RNNP, rather than producing a methodology ready for embodiment in RNNP...|$|R

The objective {{of this study is}} to integrate the <b>indicators</b> of <b>reading,</b> analytical thinking, and writing ability with the indicators of assessment of mathematics studied by grade 9 students.

From the investigation of essential aspects and a survey of teachers, the study found that the {{integration of}} indicators comprised of three abilities and eleven <b>indicators.</b> The <b>reading</b> ability consisted of two indicators: the summarizing of the main idea of the text and the interpretation of the reading. The analytical thinking ability consisted of five indicators: analyzing reading, numerical analysis, problem solving, reasoning and creating. The writing ability consisted of four indicators: the discussion arising from reading a story, drawing a graph, writing associated with data analysis and data presentation.
