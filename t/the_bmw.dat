5|$|A general problem {{existed in}} powerplants. The He 111 was {{equipped}} with BMW VI glycol-cooled engines. The German aviation industry lacked powerplants that could produce more than 600 hp.

5|$|After {{working as}} Lavochkin's {{right-hand}} man during World War II, Semyon Alekseyev was appointed as Chief Designer of OKB-21 (design bureau) at Gor'kiy. The Council of the People's Commissars directed Alekseyev and other designers to develop jet fighters using more powerful engines than the captured German Jumo 004 and <b>the</b> <b>BMW</b> 003 and their Soviet-built copies. The result of Alekseyev's efforts was the I-21 (Russian: istrebitel (fighter)), which was {{planned to be}} produced in several variants.|$|E
5|$|Renault had {{introduced}} turbocharged engines to Formula One in 1977. Brabham had tested a BMW four-cylinder M12 turbocharged engine {{in the summer}} of 1981. For the 1982 season the team designed a new car, the BT50, around <b>the</b> <b>BMW</b> engine which, like the Repco engine 16 years before, was based on a road car engine block, <b>the</b> <b>BMW</b> M10. Brabham continued to run the Cosworth-powered BT49D {{in the early part of}} the season while reliability and driveability issues with <b>the</b> <b>BMW</b> units were resolved. The relationship came close to ending, with the German manufacturer insisting that Brabham use their engine. The turbo car took its first win at the Canadian Grand Prix. In the Constructors' Championship, the team finished fifth, the drivers Riccardo Patrese, who scored the last win of the Brabham-Ford combination in the Monaco Grand Prix, 10th and World Champion Piquet a mere 11th in the Drivers' Championship. In the 1983 season, Piquet took the championship lead from Renault's Alain Prost at the last race of the year, the South African Grand Prix to become the first driver to win the Formula One Drivers' World Championship with a turbo-powered car. The team did not win the Constructors' Championship in either 1981 or 1983, despite Piquet's success. Riccardo Patrese was the only driver other than Piquet to win a race for Brabham in this period—the drivers in the second car contributed only a fraction of the team's points in each of these championship seasons. Patrese finished ninth in the Drivers' Championship with 13 points, dropping the team behind Ferrari and Renault to third in the Constructors' Championship.|$|E

5000|$|During WWII, the U.S. Army asked Harley-Davidson {{to design}} a {{specification}} of a motorcycle much like <b>the</b> <b>BMWs</b> used by German forces, with shaft drive, a boxer engine, and several other features that made <b>the</b> <b>BMWs</b> exceptionally reliable and low-maintenance machines. Harley was already producing the WLA, based on its traditional 45-degree V-twin but the army specifically wanted the one feature that the WLA didn’t have: shaft drive. So the company produced the XA, whose engine and drivetrain were based on <b>the</b> flathead <b>BMW</b> R71 (1938-1941) [...] versus the overhead valve (OHV) BMW R75 (1941-1946). 1000 XAs were produced for evaluation. By the time production had begun, {{it was clear that}} the Jeep was the Army's general purpose vehicle of choice. No more XAs were ordered after the initial order of 1000. The less advanced but cheaper WLA was considered sufficient for its limited roles.|$|R

5|$|Prosecutors {{believed}} Nicole Bostic, 26 at the time, aided Lee Woods {{in hiding}} the guns found in <b>the</b> <b>BMW</b> that Timoshenko and Yan pulled over, dumping {{them in a}} nearby garage before police retrieved them; N.

She later accepted a plea bargain, pleading guilty to a misdemeanor count of hindering the prosecution in exchange for three years probation, thereby avoiding jail.|$|E
5|$|Several press {{accounts}} {{reported that}} Timoshenko {{was shot by}} an unlicensed gun that came from Virginia. Previous reports indicated that the gun dealer had previously been indicted for his illegal gun sales, and that all the weapons found in <b>the</b> <b>BMW</b> were illegally obtained. The gun shop in question is now closed, and the dealer has been stripped of his license. Because the gun was used by {{a person with a}} criminal history, and because the NYPD was denied requests to look up the seller of the gun, legislators sought {{to make it easier for}} law enforcement to carry out their investigative duties.|$|E
5|$|Timoshenko and his partner, Officer Herman Yan, {{had been}} driving in a marked 71st precinct police car on a routine patrol in Crown Heights, with Timoshenko riding as the {{passenger}} when they spotted a 2003 black BMW sports utility vehicle headed westbound on Lefferts Avenue at 2:30 am.

5|$|The {{race was}} {{restarted}} on lap 26, {{and on the}} approach to the hairpin later in the lap Robert Kubica hit the back of Jarno Trulli's Toyota.

After losing three wheels, the nose and suffering major damage to the sidepods in the initial impact, <b>the</b> <b>BMW</b> flipped back across the track and came to rest against the barrier in the run-off area on the other side of the track. Although initial reports said that he had broken his leg, Kubica only suffered a sprained ankle and concussion. The safety car was deployed again after this crash. The safety car was also deployed on lap 50, due to debris from a crash involving Christijan Albers on the previous lap, and on lap 55 due to Vitantonio Liuzzi crashing into the wall of champions once again.|$|E
50|$|Following <b>the</b> {{success of}} <b>BMW</b> at Le Mans, the team {{decided to return}} to North America to finish the American Le Mans Series season.
