25|$|It was in 1943, {{while on}} {{holidays}} in Glengariff, West Cork, that Lynch met his future wife, Máirín O'Connor, {{the daughter of}} a Dublin judge. Lynch was to be her first and only boyfriend, and the couple were married three years later on 10 August 1946. Although she was apprehensive about her husband's decision to become active in politics, to become a Minister and even to become Taoiseach, she stood by him <b>through</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> and helped him make the tough decisions that would affect Lynch's life and her own. One story exists where Lynch, in spite of tremendous pressure from Seán Lemass and the entire Fianna Fáil party to stand for the leadership, only accepted the nomination after Máirín had agreed. The fact that the couple didn't have any children allowed Lynch to embark on a political career, without having to worry about his commitment to the family. However, he remained totally devoted to Máirín throughout his, and she became just as easily recognisable as her husband.|$|E

500|$|The {{story was}} {{inspired}} partially by Foote's nephew, who struggled {{to succeed in}} the country music business. Foote was initially interested in writing a film based on his nephew's efforts to organize a band, which he saw as paralleling his own youthful attempts to find work as an actor. During his research, however, he met an experienced musician who had offered to help his nephew's band, and Foote found himself growing more interested in a story about him, rather than the band itself. Foote said, [...] "This older man had been <b>through</b> <b>it</b> <b>all.</b> As I thought about a storyline, I got very interested in that type of character." [...] The moment in the film where a woman asks, [...] "Were you really Mac Sledge?" [...] and he responds, [...] "Yes ma'am, I guess I was," [...] was based on an exchange that Foote overheard between a washed-up star and a fan. Foote said the entire film pivots on that statement, which he believed spoke volumes about Mac's personality and former status.|$|E

500|$|The Telegraphs Nigel Farndale {{praised the}} film's {{balanced}} {{view of the}} director: [...] "ven though he was portrayed in this exquisite drama as a manipulative, vindictive martinet, the portrait was not unsympathetic." [...] The Daily Mirrors Jane Simon echoed this view, praising Jones's Hitchcock and writing that the actor [...] "managed to give [...] touches of humanity, too. There are moments when you feel a real pang of sympathy for Hitchcock, although admittedly they don't last long". [...] "liding gracefully <b>through</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> (and with an impeccable American accent) Sienna Miller brings untouchable beauty and icy glamour, but also captures the extraordinary resilience Hedren must have had to withstand everything Hitchcock threw at her." [...] In The Telegraph, Clive James said [...] " [...] better choice [...] {{could not have been}} made than Sienna Miller, who is even lovelier than Hedren was...Toby Jones, quite believably looked stunned". John Doyle of Canada's The Globe and Mail was less impressed with the actors' performances. Of Miller (whom he described as [...] "good but not great") he wrote, [...] "She doesn't have the iciness that Hedren had in her youth and she struggles to convey Hedren's enormous strength of character as a woman unwilling to let Hitchcock have his way". Doyle was equally critical of Jones, describing him as someone who [...] "seems to be imitating Hitchcock rather than inhabiting the role".|$|E
500|$|There was a {{temporary}} {{lull in the}} Jay Treaty furor after Washington signed it on August 24. The following year, however, it flared up again, when the House of Representatives inserted itself into the debate. This time the fight was not only over {{the merits of the}} treaty, but also about whether the House had the power under the Constitution to refuse to appropriate the money necessary for a treaty already ratified by the Senate and signed by the president. Citing its constitutional fiscal authority (Article I, Section 7), the House requested that the president turn over all documents that related to the treaty, including his instructions to Jay, all correspondence, and all other documents relating to the treaty negotiations. He refused to do so, invoking what later became known as executive privilege, and insisted that the House did not have the Constitutional authority to block treaties. A contentious debate ensued, during which, Washington's most vehement opponents in the House {{went so far as to}} publicly call for his impeachment. <b>Through</b> <b>it</b> <b>all,</b> Washington responded to his critics by using his prestige, political skills, and the power of office in a sincere and straightforward fashion to broaden public support for his stance.

500|$|Davis' film {{career began}} with small {{supporting}} roles in two films that were released in 1949, The Doctor and the Girl with Glenn Ford and East Side, West Side starring Barbara Stanwyck. She played a child psychiatrist {{in the film}} noir Shadow on the Wall (1950) with Ann Sothern and Zachary Scott; her performance was called [...] "beautiful and convincing" [...] by New York Times critic A. H. Weiler. She co-starred in 1950's The Next Voice You Hear..., playing a pregnant housewife who hears the voice of God from her radio. Influential reviewer Bosley Crowther of The New York Times wrote that [...] "Nancy Davis [...] delightful as [...] gentle, plain, and understanding wife." [...] In 1951, Davis appeared in Night into Morning, her favorite screen role, a study of bereavement starring Ray Milland. Crowther said that Davis [...] "does nicely as the fiancée who is widowed herself and knows the loneliness of grief," [...] while another noted critic, The Washington Posts Richard L. Coe, said Davis [...] "is splendid as the understanding widow." [...] MGM released Davis from her contract in 1952; she sought {{a broader range of}} parts, but also married Reagan, keeping her professional name as Davis, and had her first child that year. She soon starred in the science fiction film Donovan's Brain (1953); Crowther said that Davis, playing the role of a possessed scientist's [...] "sadly baffled wife," [...] "walked <b>through</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> in stark confusion" [...] in an [...] "utterly silly" [...] film. In her next-to-last movie, Hellcats of the Navy (1957), she played nurse Lieutenant Helen Blair, and appeared in a film for the only time with her husband, playing what one critic called [...] "a housewife who came along for the ride." [...] Another reviewer, however, stated that Davis plays her part satisfactorily, and [...] "does well with what she has to work with." ...|$|E
