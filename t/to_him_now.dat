5|$|Cortex sends his loyal Lab Assistants to {{find the}} pieces of the map {{scattered}} throughout the big City and bring them <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> <b>Now</b> that the contestants know about the map, the Viscount decides to reveal his true intentions: the Super Big Power Crystal can grant a single wish who whoever obtains it, and the Viscount is willing to give a large sum of money to those who help him find it. Finding the Power Crystal is impossible without the Final Key, so the Viscount boards his plane to travel to the North Atlantic Ocean in search for the Final Key. But the plane is full, and only a select number of the contestants are able to board. Propelled to the skies by an explosive volcano, the contestants are able to board the Viscount's plane.|$|E
5|$|When Brian advises Stewie to “wait and see” {{whether or}} not he has cancer, Stewie says “Jim Henson had a wait and see attitude, and look what {{happened}} <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> <b>Now</b> we’ve got wrong-sounding Muppets,” a reference to Henson’s deadly Streptococcus pneumoniae infection that was discovered too late which led to his death in 1990. The scene then cuts to Kermit the Frog and the Swedish Chef in a dialogue sequence, with much different voice tones. The two would later appear {{at the end of the}} show, discussing the preceding events, when Fozzie Bear walks in, and says in a deep voice (supplied by actor Michael Clarke Duncan): “Wocka wocka. Who wants to hear a funny-ass joke?”.|$|E

500|$|He {{originally}} did {{not want}} to make sports his career. On the day that Magic Johnson announced his HIV-positive status in 1991, the 11-year-old Gasol, who had heard the news in school, decided {{that he wanted to be}} a doctor and find a cure for AIDS. He enrolled in medical school at the University of Barcelona, but left as his basketball career at FC Barcelona advanced. He remains strongly interested in medicine. Gasol regularly visits Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles, a standard stop for athletes making charitable visits in the L.A. area, but does not limit his business to visiting young patients. On one visit, he asked a group of doctors well-informed questions about their treatment of children with scoliosis. In April 2010, Gasol was scheduled to sit in on a spinal surgery, wearing surgical scrubs, with Dr. David Skaggs, the hospital's chief of orthopedic surgery. Skaggs has said, [...] "We talk <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>now</b> almost like he is a surgical colleague." ...|$|E
500|$|Jesus reveals He goes to Earth every 100 {{years or}} so {{to check on the}} world, and since His Father had become highly {{irritable}} after giving up smoking, He needed some time away. He and Peter become friends, and Peter invites Him to dinner, along with Brian. Brian asks Jesus for proof He is Jesus Christ, so Jesus proves He is, by turning everyone's dinner into sundaes and, on Peter's request, makes Lois' breasts enlarge to massive proportions. Peter convinces Him to make his second coming public. Jesus walks on water to retrieve a dollar bill that blew out of Peter's hand. Consequently, He becomes famous and makes celebrity appearances on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno and the MTV Movie Awards. He begins to neglect His friendship with Peter, due <b>to</b> <b>Him</b> <b>now</b> being popular. The next day, Peter watches the news, where Tom Tucker reports that Jesus was found in Mary-Kate Olsen's apartment that morning face down and unconscious. Tom reports that police have revived and arrested the disoriented Jesus, who quoted [...] "Jews are responsible for all the world's wars". Jesus is arrested for His illegal prank and is sent to jail. Peter is asked by Jesus to bail Him out. Now in disrepute, Jesus decides that maybe He was not mature enough to return to the world yet and bids farewell to the family. Before He leaves this world, Jesus gives Peter a present, another record of [...] "Surfin' Bird", and it ends with Stewie groaning in genuine rage when Peter begins annoying his family with the song again.|$|E

[...] In 1900, the grand duke began renting Keele Hall, a stately home in Staffordshire, {{a few miles}} from Newcastle-under-Lyme. During the ten years he lived there, he entered country society. Michael was very pleased when the town council of Newcastle-under-Lyme conferred on him the distinction of Lord High Steward of the borough.

His art belongs <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>now.</b> He has vacated influences and his palette is of a refined richness. Gleizes shows us {{the two sides of}} his great talent: invention and observation.

2500|$|Alcibiades {{thought at}} the time that Socrates really only wanted him sexually, and by letting Socrates have his way with him he would entice Socrates to teach him {{everything}} he knew (217a). Yet Socrates made no move, and Alcibiades began to pursue Socrates [...] "as if I were the lover and he my young prey!" [...] (217c). When Socrates continually rebuffed him, Alcibiades began to view Socrates as the only true and worthy lover he had ever had. So he told Socrates that it seemed <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>now</b> that nothing could be more important than becoming the best man he could be, and Socrates was best fit to help him reach that aim (218c-d). Socrates responded that if he did have this power, why would he exchange his true (inner) beauty for the image of beauty that Alcibiades would provide. Furthermore, Alcibiades might be wrong and Socrates may be of no use to him (218e-219a). Alcibiades spent the night sleeping beside Socrates yet, to the deep humiliation of Alcibiades, Socrates made no sexual attempt (219b-d).|$|E
2500|$|Chicken Little (1943) {{is similar}} to 5th Column Mouse in that it depicts how the Nazis tried to instill fear into their enemies. [...] The cartoon begins with a {{barnyard}} scene which introduces the main characters: [...] “Cocky Locky” is depicted as the leader of, “Henny Lenny” is the gossip queen, “Turkey Lurkey” is shown as the educated elite, and “Chicken Little", the dunce. [...] The animals are all seen as happy because of a large fence protecting them. [...] However, “Foxy Loxy” wants {{to get in and}} uses a book entitled [...] "Psychology" [...] to not just get one chicken, but “get them all” by aiming for least intelligent chicken in order to eventually influence the masses. [...] It also instructs that if telling a lie, it is best to make it a big one. [...] The fox then convinces Chicken Little that the sky is falling. [...] Chicken Little initially convinces the barnyard that the sky is falling, leading to panic. [...] Cocky Locky steps onto the scene to calm the situation explaining that Chicken Little was not hit on the head by a piece of the sky. [...] The crowd is dispersed with Chicken Little left crying and ashamed. [...] The fox then realizes that he must “undermine the faith of the masses in their leaders” according to the psychology book. [...] The fox then convinces Henny Lenny and her gossiping crowd that Cocky Locky may be wrong and if so, they will all be killed. [...] The fox then convinces Turkey Lurkey and his educated elite that Cocky Locky is displaying “totalitarian tendencies and is trying to dictate to us.” [...] The fox next reads, “By the use of flattery, insignificant people can be made to look at themselves as born leaders.” [...] Chicken Little is convinced by the fox that everyone will listen <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>now</b> and should save all the other animals and tell them what to do. [...] When the animals begin to fear for their lives and ask to know what to do, Chicken Little, who is a puppet of the fox, tells them to run to the cave. [...] When they all run inside the fox ties a napkin around his neck and announces, “dinner is served.” [...] The film quite unashamedly got across the message the dangers of creating panic and not using logic and reason in a time of crisis. [...] The book Foxy read early in the film was originally intended to be Mein Kampf, however the producers thought that this might come across as too strong to the audience.|$|E
