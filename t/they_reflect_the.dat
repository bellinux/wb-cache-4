25|$|The {{research}} {{topics of}} each centre are selected through a broad bottom-up process consisting of consultations with the Israeli academic community, {{in order to}} ensure that <b>they</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>the</b> genuine priorities and scientific interests of Israeli researchers.|$|E
25|$|Icelandic {{personal}} {{names are}} patronymic (and sometimes matronymic) in that <b>they</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>the</b> immediate father or {{mother of the}} child and not the historic family lineage. This system—which was formerly used throughout the Nordic area and beyond—differs from most Western family name systems.|$|E
25|$|The bridges {{played a}} {{prominent}} role in the design. Architect George L. Dunkelberger designed them all. <b>They</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>the</b> popularity of the Art Deco style, with touches of neo-classical and modern design.|$|R
50|$|There were 117 {{original}} woodcuts {{included in}} the 1534 edition issued by the Hans Lufft press in Wittenberg. <b>They</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>the</b> recent trend (since 1522) of including artwork to reinforce the textual message.|$|R
50|$|Rey Pastor’s {{scientific}} work involved research, textbooks, and articles for <b>the</b> general public. <b>They</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>the</b> changes that {{were taking place}} in mathematics.

25|$|André Masson's {{automatic}} drawings of 1923 {{are often used}} as {{the point of the}} acceptance of visual arts and the break from Dada, since <b>they</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>the</b> influence of the idea of the unconscious mind. Another example is Giacometti's 1925 Torso, which marked his movement to simplified forms and inspiration from preclassical sculpture.|$|E
25|$|Oakland {{expanded}} {{during the}} 1920s, as its population expanded with factory workers. Approximately 13,000 homes {{were built in}} the 3 years between 1921 and 1924, more than during the 13 years between 1907 and 1920. Many of the large downtown office buildings, apartment buildings, and single-family houses still standing in Oakland were built during the 1920s; <b>they</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>the</b> architectural styles of the time.|$|E
25|$|The film makes {{repeated}} use of distinctive cinematic techniques. One {{of these}} is dreams and how <b>they</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>the</b> fears and desires of the characters. Another {{is the use of}} music, in conjunction with dialogues and editing, both as background music and as performed on camera. The film starts with a monologue which ends up being sung to Dixieland jazz music being played by lone musicians, each in a different room in {{a different part of the}} city.|$|E

50|$|La señora de Cárdenas is a Venezuelan telenovela {{written by}} José Ignacio Cabrujas and {{produced}} by RCTV in 1977.

50|$|The {{period during}} which this {{research}} was done was during the peak of apartheid in South Africa. The gold mines were South Africa's biggest industry; with its workforce coming from all the ethnic tribes of <b>the</b> region and <b>they</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>the</b> problems that were plaguing South Africa during the apartheid regime.|$|R
25|$|The poem also captures some {{feelings}} in Coleridge's previous works, especially in analyzing a problematic childhood and {{an exploration of}} religion. Partly, these feelings were fueled by his inability to accept his opium addiction and other problems. The poems also contain Coleridge's desires for Hutchinson, but these were later removed from the printed edition of the works. The editions are so different that <b>they</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>the</b> conflict and division that Coleridge felt during 1802. The tone of the poems are different, as the original was passionate and emotional, and the printed version was organized and philosophical.|$|E
25|$|They {{supersede}} the Galilean {{transformation of}} Newtonian physics, which assumes an absolute {{space and time}} (see Galilean relativity). The Galilean transformation is a good approximation only at relative speeds {{much smaller than the}} speed of light. Lorentz transformations have a number of unintuitive features that do not appear in Galilean transformations. For example, <b>they</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>the</b> fact that observers moving at different velocities may measure different distances, elapsed times, and even different orderings of events, but always such that the speed of light is the same in all inertial reference frames. The invariance of light speed is one of the postulates of special relativity.|$|E
25|$|North Dakota did not {{allocate}} any delegates {{at their}} caucuses, {{but had a}} consultative straw poll that the NDGOP leadership was required {{to use as a}} basic for making a party recommended slate of delegates. The persons on this slate was elected delegates at the April 1 state convention. According to Santorum and Paul supporters the slate was not as required based on the straw poll, but gave Romney a large majority of the delegates. The elected delegates have stated that they will divide up in such a way <b>they</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>the</b> caucus result, even if that means to vote for a candidate other than the one they support.|$|E

25|$|The {{policies}} {{in the early years}} of Confederation were designed by Central Canadian interests, and <b>they</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>the</b> needs of that region. The unified Canadian market and the introduction of railroads created a relative weakness in the Maritime economies. Central to this concept, according to Acheson, was the lack of metropolises in the Maritimes.|$|R

25|$|An {{advantage}} of copy-on-write is that, when ZFS writes new data, the blocks containing the old {{data can be}} retained, allowing a snapshot version of the file system to be maintained. ZFS snapshots are consistent (<b>they</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>the</b> entire data as it existed at a single point in time), and can be created extremely quickly, since all the data composing the snapshot is already stored, with the entire storage pool often snapshotted several times per hour. They are also space efficient, since any unchanged data is shared among the file system and its snapshots. snapshots are inherently read-only, ensuring {{they will not be}} modified after creation, although they should not be relied on as a sole means of backup. Entire snapshots can be restored and also files and directories within snapshots.|$|E
500|$|The {{status of}} panlectal and polylectal grammars has {{been subject to}} debate amongst {{generative}} phonologists since the 1970s; {{one of the foremost}} areas of contention in regards to diaphonemes and diasystems is whether <b>they</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>the</b> actual linguistic competence of speakers. William Labov, although warm to the construction of a panlectal grammar, argued that it should be based in speakers' linguistic competence. [...] Peter Trudgill argues against the formation of diasystems that are not cognitively real and implies that polylectal grammars that are not part of native speakers' competence are illegitimate. [...] Similarly, [...] cautions that polylectal grammars are only appropriate when they [...] "result in claims about speaker-hearer's capabilities..." ...|$|E
500|$|Her early poems usually {{picture a}} man and a woman {{involved}} in the most poignant, ambiguous moment of their relationship, much imitated and later parodied by Nabokov and others. Critic Roberta Reeder notes that the early poems always attracted large numbers of admirers: [...] "For Akhmatova was able to capture and convey the vast range of evolving emotions experienced in a love affair, from the first thrill of meeting, to a deepening love contending with hatred, and eventually to violent destructive passion or total indifference. But [...] her poetry marks a radical break with the erudite, ornate style and the mystical representation of love so typical of poets like Alexander Blok and Andrey Bely. Her lyrics are composed of short fragments of simple speech that do not form a logical coherent pattern. Instead, <b>they</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>the</b> way we actually think, the links between the images are emotional, and simple everyday objects are charged with psychological associations. Like Alexander Pushkin, who was her model in many ways, Akhmatova was intent on conveying worlds of meaning through precise details." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{custom of}} merrymaking and feasting at Christmastide first {{appears in the}} {{historical}} record during the High Middle Ages (c 1100-1300). This almost certainly represented a continuation of pre-Christian midwinter celebrations in Britain of which—as the historian Ronald Hutton has pointed out—"we have no details at all." [...] Personifications came later, and when <b>they</b> did <b>they</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>the</b> existing custom.|$|R
50|$|Fiestas patronales are not {{national}} holidays, because <b>they</b> only <b>reflect</b> <b>the</b> {{celebration of}} one city or town and are religious celebrations.|$|R
50|$|Asin {{was also}} {{important}} in the local politics and although they did not {{set out to be}} a political band, <b>they</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>the</b> political message needed for the times. This should be seen against the backdrop of martial law during the time of President Ferdinand Marcos. Occasionally, their recordings were confiscated as subversive, yet, on the other hand they were invited to play at the Presidential Palace.|$|R
2500|$|South African median {{employee}} earning is R2800 a month (USD [...] ) and {{the average}} earning is around R8500. These figures are found in SA statistics.

2500|$|Colonialism left deep traces in {{the hearts}} and minds of the Indian people, {{influencing}} the way they understood and represented themselves. The influences of [...] "colonialist forms of knowledge" [...] can also be found in the works of Radhakrishnan. According to Hawley, Radhakrishnan's division between East and West, the East being spiritual and mystical, and the West being rationt and colonialist forms of knowledge constructed during the 18th and 19th centuries. Arguably, these characterizations are [...] "imagined" [...] in the sense that <b>they</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>the</b> philosophical and religious realities of neither [...] "East' nor West." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Gospels {{record that}} women were among Jesus' {{earliest}} followers. Jewish women disciples, including Mary Magdalene, Joanna, and Susanna, had accompanied Jesus during his ministry and supported him out of their private means. Although the details of these gospel stories may be questioned, in general <b>they</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>the</b> prominent historical roles women played in Jesus' ministry as disciples. There were women disciples {{at the foot of}} the cross. Women were reported to be the first witnesses to the resurrection, chief among them again Mary Magdalene. She was not only [...] "witness", but also called a [...] "messenger" [...] of the risen Christ.|$|E

These paintings from 18th and 19th centuries were popular in Spain {{and other parts of}} Europe. <b>They</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>the</b> Spaniards’ sense of racial superiority by illustrating an orderly hierarchical society where socio-economic status depended on skin color and limpieza de sangre (purity of blood).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a framework for}} critical reflection that teacher educators can employ to analyze prospective teachers’ reflection and support their transformative learning. The author argues that teacher educators should not only {{pay attention to the}} cognitive processes of prospective teachers (how <b>they</b> <b>reflect),</b> but also <b>the</b> content of their thinking (what <b>they</b> <b>reflect</b> on), <b>the</b> goals of their thinking (why <b>they</b> <b>reflect),</b> and how their thinking influences their teaching practice in the classroom (what transformative learning they experience). The paper provides implications for both teacher education and teacher research...|$|R
2500|$|Duchamp {{worked on}} his complex Futurism {{inspired}} piece The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even (The Large Glass) from 1915 to 1923, {{with the exception of}} periods in Buenos Aires and Paris in 1918–1920. He executed the work on two panes of glass with materials such as lead foil, fuse wire, and dust. It combines chance procedures, plotted perspective studies, and laborious craftsmanship. He published notes for the piece, The Green Box, intended to complement the visual experience. <b>They</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>the</b> creation of unique rules of physics, and a mythology which describes the work. He stated that his [...] "hilarious picture" [...] is intended to depict the erotic encounter between a bride and her nine bachelors.|$|E
2500|$|Van der Hamen's {{still lifes}} are painted {{in a style}} {{markedly}} Flemish but <b>they</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>the</b> strong influence of those painted {{at the beginning of}} the seventeenth century in Toledo by Juan Sánchez Cotán, in which fruits and vegetables are often shown suspended [...] from a window frame or arrange along a ledge. Van der Hamen adapted Sánchez Cotán compositional style to the conditions of cosmopolitan life in Madrid, using more elaborate objects and foods compositions and objects ranging elaborate confessions, imported Venetian crystals and ceramic vessels along a simple shelf. The objects are silhouetted against a dark background and caught in a powerful light. Their regular, zigzag arrangements and the strong shadows falling on the shelf result in a placid sense of space that is heightened by the impression given by the wafers extending beyond the edge of the shelf towards the viewer.|$|E
2500|$|An {{associate}} {{professor of sociology at}} the University of Texas at Austin (UT-Austin) who conducted research called [...] "New Family Structures Study" [...] that looked at children in stable, long-term two parent homes compared to those in less-stable homes. An internal audit by the journal that published Regnerus’ study found his conclusions to be flawed and the American Sociological Association have condemned its results. Regnerus himself has admitted that the study doesn’t address same-sex parenting. Signed onto an amicus brief with both Allen and Price urging the Supreme Court to uphold California’s Proposition 8. Regnerus testified on March 3, 2014 that it is too early for social scientists to make far-reaching conclusions about families headed by same-sex couples. [...] "We aren't anywhere near saying there's conclusive evidence" [...] that children with same-sex parents grow up with no differences when compared to kids with heterosexual parents, he said. [...] "Until we get more evidence, we should be skeptical. ...It's prudent for the state to retain its definition of marriage to one man, one woman," [...] testified Regnerus. Christine L. Williams, chair of the sociology department at the UT-Austin, released a statement following Regnerus' testimony stating that his views [...] "do not reflect the views of the Sociology Department of The University of Texas at Austin. Nor do <b>they</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>the</b> views of the American Sociological Association, which takes the position that the conclusions he draws from his study of gay parenting are fundamentally flawed on conceptual and methodological grounds and that findings from Dr. Regnerus' work have been cited inappropriately in efforts to diminish the civil rights and legitimacy of LBGTQ partners and their families. We encourage society as a whole to evaluate his claims." [...] The university's College of Liberal Arts had also distanced itself from Regnerus' views.|$|E
50|$|This {{room was}} used by the king as some kind of living room. He enjoyed sitting in the niche, {{sometimes}} reading there the whole night. Because Ludwig II used to sleep in the daytime and stay awake in the night, the mirrors created an unimaginable effect for him when <b>they</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>the</b> light of the candles a thousand times. The parallel placement of some mirrors evoke the illusion of a never ending avenue.|$|R
