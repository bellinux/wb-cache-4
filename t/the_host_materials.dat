40|$|Anionically {{conducting}} materials (ACMs) are {{of great}} importance for the fabrication of alkaline fuel cells. It {{has been suggested that}} conductivity in ACMs occurs via a number of different processes. The predominant conductivity processes are attributed to: (a) the migration of anions between coordination sites in <b>the</b> <b>host</b> <b>materials,</b> and (b) the increase of conductivity due to relaxation phenomena involving the dynamics of <b>the</b> <b>host</b> <b>materials.</b> Hopping of anions to new chemical environments can lead to successful charge migration only if anion-occupying domains relax via reorganizational processes, which in general are coupled with relaxation events associated with the host matrix.
