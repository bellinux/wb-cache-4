This campaign often went awry, {{as many of the}} men presented with the feathers were not in fact shirking from service. In 1916, hoping to save them further harassment, the Rhodesia Herald and other newspapers began publishing lists of men who had volunteered only <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>deemed</b> medically unfit by the army doctors.|$|E

5|$|As regards proportionality, the law {{states that}} a self-defense {{may not be}} manifestly disproportionate. It is evident, that for a self-defense to be successful, {{it has to be}} {{performed}} on a level exceeding the attack. Unlike in case of necessity, the consequence of necessary self-defense may be more serious than consequence of the attack. The defense may not be restricted to a passive one, it can also be active. It is not the outcome of the incident but the sequence of actions at its beginning which determines who is <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>deemed</b> the attacker, and who is the party attacked.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{exited the}} coast of Africa and moved westward across the Atlantic before entering the eastern Pacific on October8. Despite strong easterly wind shear, the system acquired enough organization <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>deemed</b> a tropical depression at 0000UTC on October15. Within a broad cyclonic gyre, the system moved erratically, first drifting south then east-northeast and eventually northwest. Early on October16, the system briefly intensified into a tropical storm as a convective band wrapped around the circulation, but continued strong shear caused associated convection to dissipate and the system weakened to a tropical depression by 1800UTC. After intensifying back to a tropical storm the following day, a brief reprieve in harsh upper-level winds allowed Kiko to reach its peak intensity with winds of 70mph (110km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 991mb (hPa; 29.27inHg). An increase in southerly shear and entrance into a more stable airmass caused the system to weaken to a tropical depression at 0000UTC on October23; the system degenerated into a remnant low 24 hours later. The remnant low tracked west before turning north and eventually dissipated early on October27.|$|E
5|$|Electronic Frontier Foundation {{attorney}} Corynne McSherry and Paul Levy of Public Citizen {{commented on}} the case to Ars Technica, calling Beck's trademark claim before the WIPO ridiculous. The Citizen Media Law Project agreed with this assessment. Levy noted that domain names, in and of themselves, {{could be seen as}} defamatory; however, the statement in the domain name would have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>deemed</b> both false and malicious. Levy and McSherry thought that the filing may have been to ascertain Eiland-Hall's identity, which was anonymous prior to the complaint. McSherry couldn't recall a prior case where an individual asserted a domain name was libelous. Jack Bremer of The First Post wrote that the attempt by Beck's lawyers arguing the domain name of the website was itself defamatory had likely never occurred before in the field of information technology law.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm Flossie yielded stormy {{weather to}} Hawaii in late July2013. The sixth {{tropical}} cyclone and named storm {{of the annual}} hurricane season, Flossie originated from a tropical wave that emerged off the western coast of Africa on July9. Tracking westward across the Atlantic with little development, it passed over Central America and into the eastern Pacific Ocean on July18, where favorable environmental conditions promoted steady organization. By 0600UTC on July25, the wave acquired enough organization <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>deemed</b> a tropical depression; it intensified into a tropical storm six hours later. Continuing westward, Flossie attained peak winds of 70mph (110km/h) on July27 before entering the central Pacific Ocean. There, unfavorable upper-level winds established a weakening trend; on July30, Flossie weakened to a tropical depression, and by 1200UTC that same day, the storm degenerated into a remnant low, northeast of Kauai.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the start}} of the Korean War, the Korean Peninsula was split by an American-backed {{government}} at the south and a Soviet-backed opposing government at the north. Divided by the 38th Parallel, both the United States and the Soviet Union agreed to maintain the division until a mutual decision was made {{about the future of the}} peninsula. On 25 June 1950, North Korean troops crossed the parallel and attacked several key South Korean targets. As the United States prepared military assistance with the South Koreans, the Soviet Union also helped the North Koreans by training pilots and providing MiG-15 aircraft. Jabara arrived in Korea on 13 December 1950 with the 334th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron of the 4th Fighter-Interceptor Wing. The squadron was the first F-86 Sabre unit deployed to the Fifth Air Force to counter the threat by the Soviet MiG-15s. By 2 January 1951, he had flown five combat missions in F-86s and had damaged one MiG-15 Korean jet fighter in air combat. Jabara achieved his first confirmed victory on 3 April 1951 when 12 F-86 Sabres took on 12 MiG-15s in MiG Alley, a region in northwestern North Korea. He was credited with another on 10 April, a third on 12 April, and a fourth on 22 April. Eager to get his fifth victory <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>deemed</b> a flying ace, Jabara voluntarily transferred to the 335th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron when the 334th was rotated back to the United States.|$|E
