40|$|Greenhouse gas {{emissions}} in China have been increasing {{in line with}} its energy consumption and economic growth. Major means for energy-related greenhouse gases mitigation {{in the foreseeable future}} are <b>transition</b> <b>to</b> <b>less</b> <b>carbon</b> intensive energy supplies and structural changes in energy consumption. In this paper, a bottom-up model is built to examine typical projected scenarios for energy supply and demand, with which trends of energy-related carbon dioxide emissions by 2050 can be analyzed. Results show that low-carbon technologies remain essential contributors to reducing emissions and altering emissions trends up to 2050. By pushing the limit of current practicality, emissions reduction can reach 20 to 28 percent and the advent of carbon peaking could shift from 2040 to 2030. In addition, the effect of electrification at end-use sectors is studied. Results show that electrifying transport could reduce emissions and bring the advent of carbon peaking forward, but the effect is less significant compared with low-carbon technologies. Moreover, it implies the importance of decarbonizing power supply before electrifying end-use sectors...|$|E
40|$|Technology {{development}} and transfer {{has been identified}} as a key element in the Bali Action Plan. In the negotiations on a global climate treaty the developing nations have put forth ideas and plans to ensure that intellectual property rights (IPRs) do not become a barrier to transfer of climate friendly technology. In this discussion paper, this question of technology transfer, intellectual property rights is addressed in the context of climate change. Patent statistics shows the dominance of developed countries in specific technologies. The analysis on specific technologies indicates that IPRs is an important issue in {{development and}} transfer of technology and it is a barrier. Data indicates that although developing countries have made some progress, the dominance of developed countries in terms of patents, royalty and licensing income and expenditure on Research and Development remains as before. The historical experience is that stronger IPRs do not always result in more technology transfer and technology absorption. Hence the argument that developing countries should provide stronger protection of IPRs to encourage technology transfer has to be challenged. The technology transfer under UNFCCC and Kyoto Protocol has been minimal and insufficient {{to meet the needs of}} developing countries. The harmonization of IPRs through TRIPS has limited the options of countries to use compulsory licensing and competition policy. TRIPS has not facilitated technology transfer, particularly to Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and the North-South divide on this issue has resulted in a stalemate. Under these circumstances it is futile to expect that TRIPS alone will result in more transfer of climate-friendly technologies. Using Common But Differentiated Responsibility principle in technology development and transfer is desirable. Many proposals and suggestions have been made to stimulate technology development and transfer. Montreal Protocol is a successful example that is relevant in the context of climate change. The proposals including the proposals made by developing countries deserve a serious consideration and innovative solutions have to be found. Humanity does not has the luxury of finding solutions over a century to solve problems created by global climate change. Developing countries need both development and access to technologies that will facilitate the <b>transition</b> <b>to</b> <b>less</b> <b>carbon</b> intensive economy within the next two or three decades. So it is essential that IP issues do not become a barrier in this transition. The challenge of climate change calls for out of the box thinking to find solutions that can make a difference. The IPR issues in technology transfer need to be tackled by a combination of policy measures, incentives and bringing in changes at the global IP regime under TRIPS.

40|$|Until late, {{the subject}} of energy and its {{importance}} for capitalism and the constitution and reconstitution of world order has been sorely overlooked in the international political economy (IPE) literature. Indeed, {{only two of the}} major textbooks in IPE have chapters on energy. This is also true of the literature known as classical political economy. With few exceptions, the main questions that animated the classics such as the origins of the wealth of nations and the distribution of wealth are somehow disconnected from the production and consumption of energy. Marginal exceptions granted, there is little acknowledgement that the last three centuries of uneven and combined “progress” and “development” {{have anything to do with}} the exploitation of coal, oil and natural gas. However, if recent scholarship is any indication, this appears to be changing both within IPE and within other academic fields such as geography, sociology and environmental studies. In this emergent literature, we can find an argument that energy should not be treated as auxiliary to our analysis of the global political economy but essential to understanding and interpreting its emergence, transformations and future trajectories. Since fossil fuels make up an overwhelming share of global energy production and consumption I will mainly concentrate of non-renewable fossil fuels and aim to provide a critical political economy approach to energy, capitalism and world order by using the capital as power perspective. This is certainly not the only approach that we could take, but it is the one I find most revealing and convincing. To make this argument, I have divided the article in the following way. First, I concisely survey why energy is important for our theorizations of the global political economy as well as for understanding the practices of everyday life. With this background information in place, I briefly review how mainstream and critical accounts have approached the question of energy and the global political economy and demonstrate how the capital as power approach is distinctive for its focus on capitalization and social reproduction. In the second section, I will consider the power of the oil and gas firms in shaping and reshaping social reproduction and how there are strong indicators to suggest that renewable forms of energy cannot presently [...] and likely never will [...] replace fossil fuels and perpetuate energy intensive modes of living centuries into the future. Moreover, because of the entrenched power of oil and gas firms and their connection with affluent social reproduction, <b>transitioning</b> <b>to</b> <b>less</b> <b>carbon</b> intensive modes of social reproduction are being stalled. I conclude the article by discussing the relationship between energy, violence and world order...|$|R
40|$|There is an {{increasing}} global interest in sustainable aviation technologies {{as a result of}} concerns associated with the carbon-intensive nature of the industry and the imminence of reaching peak oil. Available options such as biofuels, liquid hydrogen and electric propulsion will not only impact on the design and functionality of commercial airplanes, but also will affect the entire industry from supply through to operation and maintenance. However, on account of the global spread and international nature of aviation, in addition to the lock-in effect associated with existing fossil-fuel driven technology, the present aviation paradigm is not well equipped for a massive or rapid technological transition. This paper first provides an overview of selected available propulsion options, as well as their possible impact on the aviation infrastructure. It then sets out to identify the existing regime players in the aviation transition arena as a means to provide an overview of potential path trajectories, with a view to assessing how airport owners and other salient regime players can either facilitate or hinder the <b>transition</b> <b>to</b> alternative and <b>less</b> <b>carbon</b> intensive technologies...|$|R

40|$|New {{materials}} are being sought out to replace steel in conventional American vehicles {{as a way}} to increase fuel efficiency. Carbon fiber composites are lightweight materials that could replace steel without decreasing strength or safety of a vehicle. These new composites have the possibility of reducing carbon dioxide emissions and increasing overall efficiency of a vehicle throughout its lifetime. Carbon fiber production has the potential <b>to</b> be <b>less</b> <b>carbon</b> intensive than steel production, and it could increase the efficiency of a manufacturing plant due to its compactness and to new technology. Fuel efficiency can be improved by using many techniques to reduce the weight of the car and to improve aerodynamic properties. Increased efficiency leads <b>to</b> <b>less</b> <b>carbon</b> dioxide emissions during the use of the vehicles, which accounts for a huge portion of the carbon dioxide emissions in the United States. Current barriers to implementation of carbon fiber in passenger vehicles include safety and cost.

This paper analyzes the welfare effect of a carbon tax on fuel consisting of gasoline and biofuel {{in the presence of}} a labor tax, with and without a biofuel subsidy. The market impacts of a carbon tax are also compared with that of a subsidy. Findings show that if a carbon tax increases biofuel demand, the tax interaction effect due to higher fuel prices is exacerbated by higher food prices and greater erosion of the carbon tax base. Thus, the second-best optimal carbon tax for fuel is lower with biofuel in the fuel mix. The existence of a fixed biofuel subsidy further reduces the welfare gain from carbon taxation...|$|R

40|$|Not {{original}} title pageSummary Combustion {{of fossil fuels}} is the major energy source in todays society. While the use of fossil fuels is a necessity for our society to function, {{there has been an}} increasing concern on the emissions of CO 2 resulting from human activities. Emissions of CO 2 are considered to be the main cause for the global warming and climate changes we have experienced in recent years. To ght the climate changes, the emissions of CO 2 must be reduced in a timely fashion. Strategies to achieve this include switching <b>to</b> <b>less</b> <b>carbon</b> intensive fuels, renewable energy sources, nuclear energy and combustion with CO 2 capture. The use of oxy-fuel combustion is among the alternative post- and precombustion capture concepts, a strategy to achieve power production from fossil fuels with CO 2 capture.

40|$|The most {{effective}} {{solution to the}} growing e-waste problem is to recycle raw materials from end-of-life electronics. Most electronic devices contain a range of materials, including metals that can be recovered for future uses.

Objectives of our study were to understand the various issues of e-waste management in the hospital settings and ways of e- waste disposal. Discussion: The hospitals visited by us have not considered the environmental impact of electronic waste, let alone come to terms with how they will dispose of their electronic trash. All the hospitals in the city can have agreement with one organization to collect their e-waste which should pay these hospitals for the e-waste and process it by sorting without melting. Recycling reduces the amount of greenhouse gas emissions caused by the manufacturing of new products.

Given the small size of construction site and increasing housing demand in Hong Kong, precast concrete has been frequently adopted in not only public residential buildings, but also the private sector. This study compares the carbon emissions of precast and traditional cast-in-situ construction methods based on a case study of a private residential building in Hong Kong. Life cycle assessment (LCA) model is established to consider the system processes from cradle to end of construction. The comparison is conducted based on eight scenarios at four levels, i. e. cubic meter concrete, precast facade, group of façade elements, and an apartment. It is found that the carbon emission of the studied residential apartment is 669 kg carbon dioxide equivalent per one square meter floor area. Precasting can lead to 10 % carbon reduction for one cubic meter concrete. Steel formwork for precasting performs better than timber formwork used in cast-in-situ concrete.
