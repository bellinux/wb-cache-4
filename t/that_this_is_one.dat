5|$|On 26 December 2002, Brigitte Boisselier, a Raëlian Bishop and CEO of a {{biotechnology}} {{company called}} Clonaid, announced {{the birth of}} baby Eve, supposedly the first-ever human clone. The announcement ignited much media attention, ethical debate, doubt, criticism, and claims of a hoax. Spokespeople for the movement, including Claude Vorilhon, have suggested <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> of the first steps in achieving a more important agenda. They claim that through cloning they can combine an accelerated growth process with some form of mind transfer, and in such, may achieve eternal life. Raelians constitute the world's largest UFO religion.|$|E
5|$|After pushing Max away, Donna finally invites him to {{the club}} to see her perform. When he arrives she {{performs}} a set, speaking about how she is pregnant and planning to have an abortion. Max leaves, but {{on the day of}} Donna's abortion, he arrives at her home with flowers and asks if he can accompany her to her procedure. While at the clinic he tells her he supports her, and that when he said {{that he wanted to be}} a grandfather, he meant sometime far in the future. The two agree <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> of the nicest Valentine's Days they have ever had. After the abortion, Max takes Donna to his home where he makes her tea, and then they watch Gone with the Wind together.|$|E

25|$|Biographers {{disagree}} {{on whether or}} not Burton ever experienced homosexual sex (he never directly acknowledges it in his writing). Allegations began in his army days when Charles James Napier requested that Burton go undercover to investigate a male brothel reputed to be frequented by British soldiers. It has been suggested that Burton's detailed report on the workings of the brothel may have led some to believe he had been a customer. There is no documentary evidence that such a report was written or submitted, nor that Napier ordered such research by Burton, and it has been argued <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> of Burton's embellishments.|$|E
25|$|In an {{interview}} with the School for Communication and Journalism at the University of Southern California in 2010, Chao expressed his opinions about topics such as the effects of economic globalization on social inequality. He explained how he believes that the global market is causing social inequality, and how issues in education and immigration are connected to this. In this interview he expressed a worry that mafias are the greatest threat to democracy and that this is already evident in certain places, like Russia and Mexico. He stated <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> reason that he is for the legalization of drugs such as Marijuana - he explained that mafias are making capital off of the distribution of illegal drugs which gives them more economic power, thus making it easier for them to potentially overthrow governments.|$|E

25|$|In a 2015 study, BDSM {{relationships}} were suggested {{to have a}} higher level of connection, intimacy, trust and communication compared to individuals who do not practice BDSM. The study suggests that dominants and submissives exchange control for each other's pleasure and to satisfy a need. They mention that both parties enjoys pleasing their partner in any way they can. Submissive and Dominants who participated in their research, felt <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> of the best things about BDSM. It gives a submissive pleasure to do things in general for their dominant. Where Dominant enjoys making their encounters all about the submissive. They enjoy doing things that makes their submissive happy. Their findings suggest that submissives and dominants found BDSM play more pleasurable and fun. BDSM was also suggested to improve personal growth, romantic relationships, their sense of community, their sense of self, the dominants confidence, and help an individual cope with everyday things by giving them a psychological release.|$|E

500|$|On 4 August 1883, with {{approximately}} 200 houses completed, Noel Park was formally opened. Noel {{gave a speech}} at the opening ceremony in which he described the development as: [...] Lord Shaftesbury then laid the memorial stone, praising Noel Park as [...] "the furtherance of a plan which has proved to be most beneficial, and would, if carried out to its full extent, completely alter for the better the domiciliary habits {{of the people of the}} metropolis". Edward White Benson, Archbishop of Canterbury, sent a note which was read to the crowd in which he stated that [...] "no one who cares for our labouring population can doubt <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> of the first, perhaps the most, necessary of all steps for their good".|$|E
500|$|Davidson further theorizes that Þorgerðr's name {{may have}} {{originally}} been Gerðr, reasons that this form {{is what is}} found in early skaldic verse, and, further, <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> of the names given for the goddess Freyja. Davidson points out that Haakon may have later turned to the same goddess soon before he met his death, when he hid in the earth beneath a swine in Óláfs saga Tryggvasonar (collected in Heimskringla) chapter 48, and that this could symbolize a mound of Freyja, one of whose names means [...] "sow" [...] (Old Norse sýr). Davidson theorizes that the account of Olaf I of Norway dragging Þorgerðr's image out of its temple after Haakon's death, and burning it next to a depiction of Freyr (Freyja's male twin), further supports this view.|$|E
500|$|Dr. Handy's friend, Dr. George Goodfellow of Tombstone, {{was among}} the first to {{research}} the actual effects of Gila monster venom. Scientific American reported in 1890 that [...] "The breath is very fetid, and its odor can be detected at some little distance from the lizard. It is supposed <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> way in which the monster catches the insects and small animals which form a part of its food supply—the foul gas overcoming them." [...] Goodfellow offered to pay local residents $5.00 for Gila monster specimens. He bought several and collected more on his own. In 1891 he purposefully provoked one of his captive lizards into biting him on his finger. The bite made him ill and he spent the next five days in bed, but he completely recovered. When Scientific American ran another ill-founded report on the lizard's ability to kill people, he wrote in reply and described his own studies and personal experience. He wrote that he knew several people who had been bitten by Gila monsters but had not died from the bite.|$|E

50|$|Aristotle's Politics {{discusses}} {{various forms}} of government. One form Aristotle named politeia, which consisted of a mixture of the other forms. He argued <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> of the ideal forms of government. Polybius expanded on many of these ideas, again focusing {{on the idea of}} mixed government. The most important Roman work in <b>this</b> tradition <b>is</b> Cicero's De re publica.|$|R
500|$|Michael Berry in the San Francisco Chronicle {{called it}} Irving's [...] "most {{controlled}} novel since A Widow for One Year". Despite covering five decades and numerous settings, it still [...] "cohere into a satisfying tale {{of loss and}} redemption". He said [...] "It's an impressive feat of sustained narrative craftsmanship". Robert Wiersema wrote in the National Post <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> of Irving's [...] "most rewarding and satisfying novels". He said he performs [...] "the most death-defying of literary feats: negotiat the delicate line between familiarity and novelty in such impressive style as to create a work {{that is at once}} comfortable, vintage Irving yet wholly new and unique". Ron Charles in The Washington Post praised the opening section of the book and its [...] "vibrant" [...] Twisted River community, but was critical {{of the rest of the}} novel saying it is [...] "scrambled across many blurry cities and restaurants and different times in a way that deadens the novel's momentum". He said that as soon as Dominic and his son flee Twisted River, the story [...] "disintegrates in what must be the most disappointing wipeout of Irving's career". Charles was particularly critical of the fact that the book dwelt excessively on Danny's writing career, which mirrored Irving's, saying that it was [...] "shorthand for real storytelling, for creating colorful places full of well-developed characters".|$|E
500|$|Cognitive {{behavioral}} {{therapy is}} currently the most effective clinical treatment for psychostimulant addictions. Additionally, research on the neurobiological effects of physical exercise suggests that daily aerobic exercise, especially endurance exercise (e.g., marathon running), prevents the development of drug addiction and is an effective adjunct therapy (i.e., a supplemental treatment) for amphetamine addiction. Exercise leads to better treatment outcomes when used as an adjunct treatment, particularly for psychostimulant addictions.There is accelerating evidence that physical exercise is a useful treatment for preventing and reducing drug addiction... In some individuals, exercise has its own rewarding effects, and a behavioral economic interaction may occur, such that physical and social rewards of exercise can substitute for the rewarding effects of drug abuse.... The value of this form of treatment for drug addiction in laboratory animals and humans is that exercise, if it can substitute for the rewarding effects of drugs, could be self-maintained {{over an extended period}} of time. Work to date in [...] regarding exercise as a treatment for drug addiction supports this hypothesis.... Animal and human research on physical exercise as a treatment for stimulant addiction indicates <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> of the most promising treatments on the horizon.}} In particular, aerobic exercise decreases psychostimulant self-administration, reduces the reinstatement (i.e., relapse) of drug-seeking, and induces increased dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) density in the striatum. This is the opposite of pathological stimulant use, which induces decreased striatal DRD2 density. [...] One review noted that exercise may also prevent the development of a drug addiction by altering ΔFosB or [...] immunoreactivity in the striatum or other parts of the reward system.|$|E
500|$|Ritchson {{described}} Arthur Curry {{as someone}} who will [...] "do anything to save what he loves". The actor {{goes on to say}} that Arthur is [...] "passionate about nature, about the earth, and about the seas", and is not afraid to use his abilities to save those things that are dear to him. When comparing his character to Clark, Ritchson stated that Arthur is more confident in his abilities, and already knows what he can do and what his path is in life. Another big difference the actor pointed out is that unlike Clark, Arthur is willing to sacrifice people and things if it means preserving the greater good. When he first appears, one of Victor Stone's key characteristics is that both he and Clark can relate to the fact that they feel their abilities inhibit them from having a true relationship with the women they love. The writers tried to create parallels between the characters to emphasize this more, like Victor's fear of telling his girlfriend the truth about what LuthorCorp did to his body, and Clark's fear of Lana Lang discovering he is an alien. Writer Tracy Bellomo characterized Oliver as a guy that does not take himself very seriously, and enjoys making fun of people that try to take him that way. Bellomo believed <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> of the reasons that Oliver is attracted to Lois, with the other being that Lois provides a challenge for him. Oliver's relationship with Clark is designed to [...] "broaden Clark's rather limited horizons", and to teach Clark that a world exists beyond Smallville.|$|E
