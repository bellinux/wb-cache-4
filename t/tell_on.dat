5|$|Elephant Island, on {{the eastern}} limits of the South Shetland Islands, was remote from {{anywhere}} that the expedition had planned to go, and far beyond normal shipping routes. No relief ship would search for them there, {{and the likelihood of}} rescue from any other outside agency was equally negligible. The island was bleak and inhospitable, and its terrain devoid of vegetation, although it had fresh water, and a relative abundance of seals and penguins to provide food and fuel for immediate survival. The rigours of an Antarctic winter were fast approaching; the narrow shingle beach where they were camped was already being swept by almost continuous gales and blizzards, which destroyed one of the tents in their temporary camp, and knocked others flat. The pressures and hardships of the previous months were beginning to <b>tell</b> <b>on</b> the men, many of whom were in a run-down state both mentally and physically.|$|E

Nor is it possible using a dummy pit of U-238 and high-speed x-ray cameras, although such tests are helpful. For final determination, a test needs to be made with real fissile material. Consequently, starting in 1957, a year after Swan, both labs began one-point safety tests.|$|E

With the weather clearing, the Nationalists {{started a new}} advance on 17 January 1938. Two days later the Republican {{leadership}} finally gave up its scruples about the Battle of Teruel being an all Spanish operation, and ordered the International Brigades to join the struggle. Many of these units {{had been in the}} area but in reserve. Celebrities and politicians entertained and visited the units during this time. American pro-Communist singer Paul Robeson sang for them on Christmas Eve with a repertoire that included L'Internationale and ended with Ol' Man River. Future Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Clement Attlee, left-wing Labour politician Ellen Wilkinson and future Labour Government official and diplomat Philip Noel-Baker visited a British unit.|$|E

25|$|However, the {{following}} year the strain on his slight frame of bowling fast began to <b>tell</b> <b>on</b> Haigh, and though his 91 wickets at 18.75 placed him in the top twenty of the national averages, he was already noticed to be less formidable than Yorkshire's other bowlers on firm pitches, but quite unplayable after rain – as in the home games with Surrey and Derbyshire. Although he produced a skilful performance against Middlesex at Lord's on a hard pitch {{the following}} year, Haigh did comparatively little of note except on sticky wickets. On such sticky wickets his return of 14 for 43 beat Hampshire in a day's cricket. Haigh's batting developed and he averaged 26 in 1901, and saved Yorkshire from defeat at Worcestershire in 1900. That year, Haigh took 163 wickets for just over 14 each, and in 1902 he took 158 wickets in 799 overs.|$|E
500|$|We counted 116 {{pieces of}} cannon, heavy and light, {{but all of}} these pieces, with the {{exception}} of one heavy battery of 16 guns , are en barbette, and the crews of the guns are utterly unprotected from shell, canister, or rifle bullets. [...] As regards the heavy 16-gun casemated battery, the embrasures appear to be wrongly constructed, according to modern ideas on such subjects, the large aperture of the embrasure facing the enemy, and becoming an excellent target for riflemen, almost all of whose bullets must <b>tell</b> <b>on</b> the crew of the gun within.|$|E

500|$|Soon {{after the}} book's publication, Potter's ageing Mrs. Tiggy began {{showing signs of}} failing health. She wrote a friend on February 1, 1906, [...] "I am sorry to say I am upset about poor Mrs. Tiggy. She hasn't seemed well the last fortnight, and {{has begun to be}} sick, and she is so thin.

500|$|The series {{follows the}} adventures and endeavors {{of the title}} {{character}} and his various friends in the underwater city of Bikini Bottom. In this episode, SpongeBob reads a [...] "bad word" [...] off a dumpster behind the Krusty Krab, but {{does not know what}} it means. Patrick explains to him that it is a [...] "sentence enhancer" [...] which is used [...] "when you want to talk fancy." [...] The two start using it in every sentence they speak. However, when Mr. Krabs hears them, he warns the two never to use the word again or any of the 13 bad words. Later on, SpongeBob accidentally swears again. Patrick then runs to tell Mr. Krabs with SpongeBob trying to stop him. However, when Mr. Krabs accidentally injures his toe, he utters all the 13 bad words. The two cannot believe it and run to Mama Krabs to <b>tell</b> <b>on</b> him. Mama Krabs, who is appalled by their use of the words, makes the three paint her house as punishment.|$|E

On May 9, 2012, Barack and Michelle Obama came out publicly in favor of same-sex marriage. Prior to this, Michelle Obama had never stated her position on same-sex marriage publicly. Senior White House officials said that Michelle Obama and Senior Adviser Valerie Jarrett had been the two most consistent advocates for same-sex marriage in Barack Obama's life. Michelle {{went on to say}} that [...] "This is an important issue for millions of Americans, and for Barack and me, it really comes down to the values of fairness and equality we want to pass down to our girls. These are basic values that kids learn at a very young age and that we encourage them to apply in all areas of their lives. And in a country where we teach our children that everyone is equal under the law, discriminating against same-sex couples just isn't right. It's as simple as that." [...] At the 2012 DNC Michelle said, [...] "Barack knows the American Dream because he's lived it... and he wants everyone in this country to have that same opportunity, no matter who we are, or where we're from, or what we look like, or who we love." ...|$|E

500|$|Victory against West Ham United moved Arsenal 10 points {{clear of}} third-place Coventry City and {{significantly}} ahead of defending champions Liverpool. The team {{came from behind}} against Millwall to seal another win. Their performance up until the second half was insipid, and after the interval they did as their manager asked and [...] "upped their tempo" [...] {{in search of an}} equaliser. Marwood eventually scored and the midfielder had a part to play in Smith getting the winning goal. Arsenal dropped two points away to Queens Park Rangers and were beaten by Coventry City – Bould conceded a late second-half penalty which was converted by Brian Kilcline. John Sillett, the manager of Coventry City felt pressure on Arsenal was [...] "beginning to <b>tell</b> <b>on</b> them" [...] and wanted to exploit that. Smith and Perry Groves each scored in Arsenal's 2–0 win against Luton Town, but February ended with a goalless draw at home to Millwall. Doubts were raised over Arsenal's championship credentials as Millwall successfully nullified their opponents' attacking threat. The visitors' own attacking duo – Teddy Sheringham and Tony Cascarino got the better of a struggling Adams, who was fortunate not to have conceded a penalty in the first half. Though Arsenal remained in first place after 27 matches, the gap built {{at the start of the}} calendar year was diminishing.|$|E

2500|$|When {{diagnosing}} allochiria, it {{is important}} to consider the sensory and the motor aspects of the problem. [...] In absence of knowledge there are a number of ways in which the various symptoms may be overlooked or misinterpreted and as the condition goes frequently unrecognized. [...] One rare example in medicine that causes a wrong diagnosis of allochiria is due to the unawareness of a few simple facts than to any failure in judgment. [...] It is evident that the details of the sensory symptoms get overlooked when testing a patient's localizing capacity. The observer neglects to inquire expressly as to the side to which the sensation is referred. [...] This is evident when patients with allochiria show no fault in sensorial perception and localization. However, even if the patient mentions the wrong side, it is sometimes being just regarded as a slip of the tongue and matter may not be pursued any further. [...] Looking at the motor aspect of allochiria, the symptoms again are described in a misleading way because the symptoms are less obvious. [...] Unless motor manifestations are carefully analyzed, they may be interpreted as clumsiness or weakness. [...] Moreover, when patients complained of weakness and awkwardness of right side—examinations apparently confirmed that the truth of this statement and defect was marked as acts consciously performed and was present only in relation to such acts. [...] If a patient says that he cannot <b>tell</b> <b>on</b> which side the certain stimulus is applied—existence of allochiria is confirmed, provided that sensibility is intact.|$|E
2500|$|Hardinge {{continued}} to move ships {{to remain in}} Tyler's service, and both were present aboard [...] at the Naval Battle of Hyères Islands on 13 July 1794. The pair saw continued service off the Italian coast during the following months, and {{it was during this}} time that Hardinge {{came to the attention of}} Sir William Hamilton, the British envoy to the Kingdom of Naples. Hamilton introduced Hardinge to the study of history and the arts. [...] Hardinge returned to England for a brief period in 1798, but returned to sea aboard Tyler's new command, the 38-gun [...] The Aigle was wrecked off the African coast on 18 July, but Hardinge survived to be rescued, and duly came to the attention of Earl St Vincent. Hardinge's talent for impressing senior officials with his intellect led to St Vincent appointing him to the 74-gun , under the command of Captain Ralph Willett Miller. He was still aboard the Theseus when Miller was killed in an accidental explosion in May 1799, that left the ship severely damaged. Hardinge returned to Britain where he was transferred to the 80-gun [...] as a supernumerary lieutenant under Captain Edward Berry, and on returning to the Mediterranean he was involved in the battle which led to the capture of the 80-gun French ship Guillaume <b>Tell</b> <b>on</b> 30 March 1800. Hardinge remained in the Mediterranean after this, serving under Captain Sir Sidney Smith aboard the 80-gun [...] He was involved in the operations of the Egyptian Campaign, and was promoted to lieutenant on 15 October 1800, subsequently receiving the Turkish Gold Medal.|$|E
