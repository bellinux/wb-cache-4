40|$|A travel {{company offers}} a {{transportation}} service {{by picking up}} customers from certain places and sending them to the other places.

5|$|After the war, the Boy Scout Association bought {{adjoining}} land {{to increase the}} estate and protect it from rapidly approaching new developments.

This began an era of expanding camping facilities for Scouts which lasted until the early 1960s. Training and sleeping facilities were added through the early 1970s. The Boy Scout Association was renamed The Scout Association in 1967.|$|E

5|$|Beginning as a supporter, Greeley {{soon became}} disillusioned with President Johnson, whose Reconstruction {{policies}} allowed <b>the</b> <b>quick</b> formation of state governments without provision for suffrage for the freedman.

While Greeley generally supported the Radical Republicans, {{he did not like}} the harshness of Thaddeus Stevens. Greeley ran for Congress in 1866, but lost badly, and for Senate in the legislative election held in early 1867, to be defeated by Roscoe Conkling.|$|E
5|$|Due to <b>the</b> <b>quick</b> {{shooting}} schedule, {{the rain}} forced several exterior scenes to be re-written {{to be shot}} inside. Other scenes were shot with a large tarp draped over the actors. Due {{to the fact that}} the rainfall was audible in the background, Corman used the film's score and an assortment of sound effects to drown out the noise. The first scene shot was Beverly Garland and John Ireland's love scene in a tree. The tree was home to a colony of red ants, who crawled all over the actors and repeatedly bit them.|$|E
5|$|Early on August3, Arlene {{began to}} weaken {{as it turned}} towards the west once more.

Later that day, the system passed near the northern Leeward Islands; however, the depression was poorly organized. The former hurricane steadily tracked northwestward and began to regenerate on August7.|$|E
