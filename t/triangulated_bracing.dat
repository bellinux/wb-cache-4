50|$|In 1929, the Monospar Company Ltd {{was formed}} to pursue new {{techniques}} of designing cantilever wings, {{based on the work}} of Swiss engineer Helmuth J. Stieger, who headed the company. Helmuth John Stieger was born in Zurich in 1902 and educated at the Swiss Federal Polytechnic then the Imperial College of Science in London. While working as a designer for William Beardmore and Company, he formed his own ideas about wing design and evolved an improved method of building and stressing wings for which he was later granted a British Patent in December 1927. The principle behind this Patent No. 306,220 was that the wing needed only one spar with torsion loads resisted by an efficient system of strong compression struts with <b>triangulated</b> <b>bracing</b> in the form of thin wires. The design was revolutionary and very light for its strength.|$|E

The early English machines (as opposed to the American versions), such as Edwards, Kendrick, Brown, Boggs, and Ranalah, etc., had cast iron frames. These wheels, made during the 19th Century, had Babbitt metal plain bearings, making them difficult to push and pull the metal through when operated at high pressures. Later, when ball bearings came into use, the machines became more suitable for hard and thick material, such as 1/8‚Äù steel. Despite the advantages of cast iron, it has {{less than half the}} stiffness (Young's modulus) of steel and sometimes must be replaced by steel when a stiffer frame is needed. Steel frames made of solid flame-cut plate, or frames built-up of cut-and-welded plates, are common designs. Steel tubing, generally of square section, has been used for wheeling machine frames during the past 30 years, in the US particularly, where sheet metal shaping has become a hobby as well as a business. Tube-framed machines are reasonably-priced and are available either as kit-built machines or can be built easily from plans. The stiffest tubular frames have a fully <b>triangulated</b> external <b>bracing</b> truss. They are most effective on thinner or softer materials, such as 20 ga steel or [...]063" [...] aluminum. Cast frame machines, like the one pictured, are still available.|$|R
