40|$|Abstract—Australia {{does not}} have varroa mite. However, we {{investigated}} whether modified hive bottom boards used for varroa mite management in honey bee colonies had other benefits, for honey production. We compared a number of colony parameters between hives fitted with tube, mesh and conventional (solid) bottom boards in two locations in eastern Australian, Richmond NSW and Castlemaine Victoria. Colonies housed in hives with mesh and <b>tube</b> <b>bottom</b> boards were not significantly superior to those in hives with conventional bottom boards with regard to bee flight activity, nor did they produce more honey, brood or stored pollen, in either experimental site.

40|$|Electrochemical and photo-electrochemical {{behavior}} of self-organized TiO 2 nanotubes formed in organic solvents {{have been studied}} by {{taking into account the}} formation of new barrier layers beneath nanotubes either due to the anodic polarization in aqueous solutions or air exposure during high temperature annealing. It has been shown that before annealing, electrochemical and photoelectrochemical answers are dominantly controlled by the physicochemical properties of the anodic barrier layer. Annealing in air at sufficiently high temperatures changes the initial amorphous structure of as-prepared nanotubes and forms a new oxide layer below them due to thermal oxidation of underneath titanium. Affixing <b>tube</b> <b>bottoms</b> to the substrate during annealing, which forms a better electrical contact, can {{play an important role in}} collecting a higher photoresponse from annealed nanotubes.

40|$|A {{simplified}} box {{model of}} the cooling of a salt-stratified ocean is analyzed analytically and numerically. A large isothermal basin of salt water has a layer of fresh water at the surface. Beside {{this is a small}} basin, cooled from above and connected to the large basin by horizontal tubes at the top, middle and bottom. For small cooling rate, fresh water enters the small basin, is cooled and leaves through the middle tube. For greater cooling rate, the fresh water leaves the small basin through the middle and <b>bottom</b> <b>tube.</b> If the top tube is smaller than the deeper tubes and the fresh water layer is suciently shallow, flow in the middle tube reverses at a critical cooling rate. In this case, a mixture of salt and fresh water is cooled and leaves the <b>bottom</b> <b>tube.</b> Increased cooling produces much greater flow rate; consequentially temperature increases rather than decreases in the small basin. A relaxation heat flow condition results in multiple equilibria. One of the stable modes has fresh surface water descending in the small basin and flowing out through the middle and <b>bottom</b> <b>tube.</b> The other has a greater rate of flow of both fresh and salty water (through the middle tube) into the basin with the flow of mixed salty water out of the <b>bottom</b> <b>tube.</b> Implications for dee...|$|R

40|$|Short {{state-of-the-art}} on {{the enhancement}} of condensation heat transfer techniques by means of condensate drainage is presented in this paper. The electrohydrodynamic (EHD) technique is suitable for dielectric media used in refrigeration, organic Rankine cycles and heat pump devices.

The experimental investigations of these two configurations for condensation of refrigerant R- 123 have been accomplished.

The condensation enhancement depends both on the geometry of the electrode system and on the applied voltage...|$|E

This new procedure involves the slow centrifugation (at 33 g) of erythrocyte suspensions through 5 % Ficoll solutions.

After further gradient centrifugation of these parasitized cells, the concentration of mature forms is increased 15 - to 31 -fold and a mature form parasitaemia of 71 - 81 % is obtained in the final erythrocyte suspension. Furthermore, at least 75 % {{of the total number}} of the mature forms can be retrieved by this method. Parasitized cells that are not retained in the gradient are sedimented to the bottom of the <b>tube</b> (<b>bottom</b> fraction) and consist predominantly of ring forms. Parasites from both the top and bottom fractions are viable and have been used to initiate short-term synchronous cultures.

40|$|The {{overwhelming}} majority of bacteria live in slime embedded microbial communities termed biofilms, which are typically adherent to a surface. However, when several Staphylococcus epidermidis strains were cultivated in static liquid cultures, macroscopic aggregates were seen floating within the broth and also sedimented at the test <b>tube</b> <b>bottom.</b> Light- and electron microscopy revealed that early-stage aggregates consisted of bacteria and extracellular matrix, organized in sheetlike structures. Perpendicular under the sheets hung a network of periodically arranged, bacteria-associated strands. During the extended cultivation, the strands of a subpopulation of aggregates developed into cross-connected wall-like structures, in which aligned bacteria formed the walls. The resulting architecture had a compartmentalized appearance. In late-stage cultures, the wall-associated bacteria disintegrated so that, henceforth, the walls were made of the coalescing remnants of lysed bacteria, while the compartment-like organization remained intact. At the same time, the majority of strand containing aggregates with associated culturable bacteria continued to exist. These observations indicate that some strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis are able to build highly sophisticated structures, in which a subpopulation undergoes cell lysis, presumably to provide continued access to nutrients in a nutrient-limited environment, whilst maintaining structural integrity...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} flow {{dynamics}} on the discharge mode is studied {{in order to}} design a technical solution for thin film coating on large surfaces. The configuration consists in two atmospheric pressure helium plasma jets impacting a surface and confined in a tube. This system operates in open air. It has been studied by short exposure time pictures, current and voltage measurements, optical emission spectroscopy, schlieren flow visualization and computational fluid dynamics. Two discharge regimes directly connected to the gas flow dynamic have been pointed out. One is localized from the point electrodes to the surface; the other one entirely fills the confinement tube. A correlation between air intake inside the confinement tube and the discharge mode has been highlighted. Indeed, the discharge only develops in helium and the air intake confines the helium jets in volumes smaller than the confinement tube. The air intake {{is determined by the}} gas flow rate and the distance from the <b>tube</b> <b>bottom</b> to the substrate surface, parameters which have been linked to the change from laminar to turbulent flow. Finally, the understanding of flow dynamics and discharge plasma coupling allowed the design of a technical solution favoring plasma homogeneity for large surface treatment...|$|E
40|$|Hydrodynamic {{study of}} gas and solid flow in an {{internally}} circulating fluidized bed (ICFB) is made in this paper using a high-speed camera and pressure probes for the laboratory 0. 3 [*]m × 0. 27 [*]m column having an internal draft tube. Experiments were conducted using sand particles of Geldart B and Geldart B-D groups. At each run the standard pressure-flow curves for both the draft tube and annular region beds, and the moving wall particle velocity in the annular bed region were measured. The effects of superficial gas velocity, static bed height, and draft tube gap height on pressure drop profiles, solid circulation patterns, and gas bypassing dynamics for the ICFB were investigated extensively. Unlike the conventional CFB, the pressure drop in ICFB is further decreased with superficial gas velocity after the minimum spouting fluidization, followed by yielding a cross-over in the pressure drop of the annular bed compared to the draft tube. Pressure drop in the draft tube increases with an increase of static bed height and gap height between the draft <b>tube</b> <b>bottom</b> and the air distributor. The gas bypassing fraction increases {{with an increase in}} gap height and decreases with increased bed height and mean particle size.
