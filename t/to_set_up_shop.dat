25|$|The {{case has}} been {{called one of the}} most {{important}} of the late 20th century, since it freed nationally chartered banks to offer credit cards to anyone in the U.S. they deemed qualified, and more specifically because it allowed them to export credit card interest rates to states with stricter regulations, opening up a race between states in an effort to attract lending institutions <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>shop</b> in their states and offer a wider variety of consumer credit products. Over the next decade, the states accelerated a process that had already begun of repealing or loosening their anti-usury laws, allowing state-chartered banks to compete more equally with national ones. As a result, the use of credit cards has vastly increased, and since the mortgage industry soon followed suit, the issuance of subprime mortgages also increased drastically, facilitating the housing bubble that led to the 2008 housing crisis.|$|E

40|$|We apply a {{mechanism}} design {{approach to a}} trading post environment where the household type space (tastes over variety) is continuous and it is costly <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>shops</b> that trade differentiated goods. In this framework, we address Hotelling’s [3] venerable question about where shops will en-dogenously locate in variety space across environments with and without money. Money has a role in our environment due to anonymity. Our spe-cific question is whether monetary exchange leads to more product variety than an environment without money (i. e. a barter economy). We show that an efficient monetary mechanism does in fact lead to more product variety available to households provided the discount factor is sufficiently high, costs of operating shops are sufficiently low, and there is sufficient heterogeneity in tastes and abilities. We then show how this allocation can be implemented in a trading post economy with money. The paper {{is an attempt to}} integrate monetary theory and industrial organization. ...|$|R
