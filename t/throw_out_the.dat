5|$|McAleer's rift with Johnson, {{along with}} his sudden retirement, damaged his {{professional}} reputation, and he received little recognition for his contributions to baseball.

5|$|Johnson was {{selected}} by the Detroit Lions {{in the first round}} as the second pick overall in the 2007 NFL Draft. This is the highest a Georgia Tech Yellow Jacket has ever been drafted. The Lions were expected to trade Johnson, most likely to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, but the team announced that they were keeping him. The next day, the Detroit Tigers invited him to <b>throw</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> ceremonial first pitch.|$|E

5|$|On April 1, {{the defense}} {{asked for the}} new trial to be moved outside Brownsville, {{claiming}} their client had received unfair treatment {{in the media and}} there was no chance for her to have a fair trial and an unbiased jury. The request included large numbers of magazines and newspaper articles published since 1993. It did not cite any specific passages where the alleged media bias was demonstrated. The defense also filed a motion to <b>throw</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> new indictment {{on the grounds that it}} was double jeopardy. On April 27, the judge decided to postpone his decision about where to hold the trial. He also rejected the defense motion stating that the new indictment was a case of double jeopardy. The defense argued that the prosecution had illegally used Brownsville and Houston grand juries to work on the case, but the judge countered that claim saying only the Houston grand jury had handled the case. On May 4, the trial was moved from Brownsville to Houston, Texas, because of the earlier extensive media coverage.|$|E

25|$|Elliott {{also set}} an {{unprecedented}} NASCAR record of winning five consecutive pole qualifying sessions in that season; the June Pocono race, the Firecracker 400, the July races in Pocono and Talladega, and the August Michigan race. That {{did not include}} the June Michigan race where qualifying was rained out, and the July Pocono race pole was where he started second, but further investigation led NASCAR to <b>throw</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> winning pole time for illegal fuel additives, retroactively awarding Elliott the pole award, money, and credit towards the season-long award for most poles won.|$|E
25|$|Wilson was an {{automobile}} enthusiast and, while President, he took daily rides {{in his favorite}} car, a 1919 Pierce-Arrow. His enjoyment of motoring made him an advocate of funding for public highways. He was also an avid baseball fan, and in 1915 became the first sitting president to attend and <b>throw</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> first ball at a World Series game. Wilson had been a center fielder during his Davidson College days and was the Princeton team's assistant manager. Also, he cycled regularly, taking several cycling vacations in the English Lake District. Wilson later took up golf.|$|E

The game provided an historic first: When Dusty Baker and Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts exchanged line-up cards before the game, it became the first postseason game in the Major League Baseball history in which two African-American managers faced one another.|$|E

25|$|Though he {{has spent}} most of his life in Memphis, Lawler did spend a part of his {{childhood}} in Ohio after his father was transferred to a Ford Motor Company assembly plant in Lorain, Ohio. From the ages of 7 to 15 his family resided in the city of Amherst, Ohio, a suburb near Cleveland. Though this stay was brief, it would have an influence on Lawler throughout his life thereafter. He often cites Cleveland as his second-favorite city behind only Memphis and is a die-hard fan of both the Cleveland Indians and the Cleveland Browns. When WWE performs in Cleveland, Lawler will usually wear a Browns jersey or an Indians jersey (at SummerSlam 1996 he teased Browns fans by wearing a Baltimore Ravens jersey, because the original Browns moved to Baltimore and became the Ravens), and during baseball season, he will <b>throw</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> first pitch at an Indians game.|$|E
25|$|The {{philosophy}} of anarchism {{was also a}} point of contention during the trial. Gordon Simmons, an adjunct professor of philosophy at West Virginia State University and Marshall University, testified as Sierra's final witness. His testimony included explanations of the philosophy espoused by Sierra's proposed club, its impact on American social and political movements, {{and the notion that}} anarchists had historically been unjustly persecuted in American courts, citing such examples as the trials of the Haymarket affair and Sacco and Vanzetti. The lawyer for the school officials countered that anarchism had prominent ties to terrorism and assassination, and referred to Timothy McVeigh and Theodore Kaczynski as anarchists. On July 12, the court ruled that Sierra had been justly suspended and forbidden to wear the T-shirts, but had been improperly denied the right to start a club, and awarded her the $1 in damages she sought. Attorneys for both Kanawha County and Sierra asked that those parts of the verdict that went against their client, requesting that Kanawha Chief Circuit Judge James C. Stucky <b>throw</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> jury's verdict, finding it to be inconsistent, and that he rule himself instead.|$|E
25|$|On May 7, Henry’s German troops forced {{their way}} across the Ponte Milvio and entered Rome, but found it {{impossible}} to <b>throw</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> Angevin troops from around St Peters Basilica. As the Colonna family had possession of the area around the Basilica of St. John Lateran, Santa Maria Maggiore and the Colosseum, Henry was forced to perform his coronation on 29 June 1312 at the Lateran. The ceremony was performed by three Ghibelline cardinals who had joined Henry on his way through Italy. Robert of Naples, in the meantime, had made increasing demands upon Henry, including Henry making Robert’s son the Imperial vicar of Tuscany, and that Henry had to depart Rome within four days of his coronation. Henry, in his turn, declared that the imperial prerogative overrode papal authority, and that the entirety of Italy was subject to the emperor. He then refused to commit, as Pope Clement V had requested, to seek a truce with Robert of Naples, and he didn’t rule out attacking the southern kingdom. After Henry concluded a formal treaty signed with Robert's rival to the Sicilian throne, Frederick of Aragon, the chaos in the city of Rome forced Henry to leave, and, following the advice of Tuscan Ghibellines, he travelled north to Arezzo.|$|E

25|$|Retired {{pitcher and}} former National Liván Hernández {{had missed the}} chance to <b>throw</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> {{ceremonial}} first pitch in Game 1 when Hurricane Matthew {{made it impossible for}} him to fly from Florida to Washington for that game, but he threw out the first pitch for Game 5 instead. For some the game carried an historic weight that would either confirm or change the narrative of the Nationals, their achievements, and their prospects for the future after their collapse in the 2012 NLDS and the impotence of their offense in the 2014 NLDS. A Washington, D.C., MLB team had not won a postseason series since the Washington Senators won the 1924 World Series, the Montreal-Washington franchise had won only one playoff series in its history (in 1981, as the Montreal Expos), and the Nationals had never advanced beyond the NLDS in two previous tries. Two personal negative streaks also were on the line: Teams Dusty Baker managed had lost eight straight postseason elimination games in a row in which they had a chance to advance to the next round of the playoffs, and starting pitcher Max Scherzer had started three postseason elimination games in a row for his previous teams, all of them losses.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{critical}} and commercial success of Cinderella, writing for Sleeping Beauty began in early 1951. Partial story elements originated from discarded ideas for Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs including Maleficent's capture of Prince Philip and his dramatic escape from her fortress and Cinderella where a fantasy sequence featured the leading protagonists dancing on a cloud which was developed, but eventually {{dropped from the}} film. By the middle of 1953, director Wilfred Jackson had recorded the dialogue, assembled a story reel, and was to commence for preliminary animation work where Princess Aurora and Prince Phillip were {{to meet in the}} forest and dance, though Walt Disney decided to <b>throw</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> sequence delaying the film from its initial 1955 release date. For a number of months, Jackson, Ted Sears, and two story writers underwent a rewrite of the story, which received a lukewarm response from Disney. During the story rewriting process, the story writers felt the original fairy tale's second act felt bizarre and with the wake-up kiss serving as a climactic moment, they decided to concentrate on the first half finding strength in the romance. However, they felt little romance was developed between the strange prince and the princess that the storyboard artists worked out an elaborate sequence in which the king organized a treasure hunt. The idea was eventually dropped when it became too drawn out and drifted from the central storyline. Instead, it was written that Prince Phillip and Princess Aurora would meet in the forest by random chance while Princess Aurora renamed Briar Rose was conversing with the forest animals. Additionally, because the original Perrault tale had the curse last one hundred years, the writers decided to shorten it a few hours with the time spent for Prince Phillip to battle the goons, overcome several obstacles, and fight off against Maleficent transformed into a dragon.|$|E

[...] Shortly after the 2005 season began, the chronic arthritic condition in his shoulder that had begun in 2001 finally sidelined him, rendering him inactive for three-quarters of the season.

500|$|Frank Spotnitz was {{assigned}} writing duties for [...] "Nisei", which was {{originally intended to}} be a stand-alone mythology story and to air as the seventh episode of the third season. However, as Spotnitz developed his script, the episode hit several logistical snags. Most notably, Spotnitz's script featured several scenes filmed on trains: Chris Carter explained, [...] "We found {{that we were going to}} have some trouble shooting with trains." [...] Eventually, the sheer scope of the episode caused co-executive producer R. W. Goodwin so much trouble that he wanted to scrap the story. Spotnitz explained, [...] "Goodwin called Chris and said, 'This is unproducable. [...] you've got to <b>throw</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> script, basically.' I was devastated, and Chris [...] 'Let's make it a two-parter.'" [...] So, the episode was bumped back to number nine and was lengthened to a two parter, resulting in it being delayed several weeks.|$|E

Dean informed Colonel MacFarland, who pledged to support Sattar as long as Sattar continued to back the Government of Iraq. On 9 September, Sattar and former Anbar Governor Fasal al Gaood, along with 50 other sheikhs, announced the formation of the Anbar Awakening movement. Shortly after the meeting, Colonel MacFarland began hearing reports that off-duty Iraqi police operating as the military wing of the Awakening had formed a shadowy vigilante organization called [...] "Thuwar al-Anbar". Thuwar al-Anbar conducted terror attacks against known AQI operatives, while Colonel MacFarland and his soldiers turned a blind eye.|$|E
