5|$|MAR used {{separate}} transmitter and receivers, {{a necessity}} {{at the time}} due {{to the size of}} the individual transmit and receive units and the switching systems that would be required. Each transmitter antenna was fed by its own power amplifier using <b>travelling</b> <b>wave</b> tubes with switching diodes and striplines performing the delays. The broadcast signal had three parts in sequence and the receivers had three channels, one tuned to each part of the pulse chain. This allowed the receiver to send each part of the signal to different processing equipment, allowing search, track, and discrimination in a single pulse.|$|E
5|$|Groundbreaking on the MAR-I site {{started in}} March 1963 and {{construction}} proceeded rapidly. The radar was powered {{up for the}} first time in June 1964 and achieved its first successful tracking on 11 September 1964, repeatedly tracking and breaking lock on a balloon target over a 50-minute period. However, the system demonstrated very low reliability in the transmitter's <b>travelling</b> <b>wave</b> tube (TWT) amplifiers, which led to an extremely expensive re-design and re-installation. Once upgraded, MAR-I demonstrated the system would work as expected; it could generate multiple virtual radar beams, could simultaneously generate different types of beams for detection, tracking, and discrimination at the same time, and had the accuracy and speed needed to generate many tracks.|$|E
25|$|Another model {{based on}} {{cellular}} automata, {{taking into account}} a simpler replicating network of continuously mutating parasites and their interactions with one replicase species, was proposed by Takeuchi and Hogeweg and exhibited an emergent <b>travelling</b> <b>wave</b> pattern. Surprisingly, travelling waves not only proved to be stable against moderately strong parasites, if the parasites' mutation rate is not too high, but the emergent pattern itself was generated {{as a result of}} interactions between parasites and replicase species. The same technique was used to model systems that include formation of complexes. Finally, hypercycle simulation extending to three dimensions showed the emergence of the three-dimensional analogue of a spiral wave, namely, the scroll wave.|$|E

5000|$|Heterogeneity: spatial {{noise in}} {{parameter}} values can generate {{a series of}} bands of periodic <b>travelling</b> <b>waves.</b> This is important in applications to oscillatory chemical reactions, where impurities can cause target patterns or spiral waves, which are two-dimensional generalisations of periodic <b>travelling</b> <b>waves.</b> This process provided the motivation {{for much of the}} work on periodic <b>travelling</b> <b>waves</b> in the 1970s and early 1980s.

25|$|Coherent {{microwave}} amplifiers operating above 1,000 watts microwave output, like <b>travelling</b> <b>wave</b> {{tubes and}} klystrons, require liquid coolant. The electron beam must contain 5 to 10 times {{more power than}} the microwave output, which can produce enough heat to generate plasma. This plasma flows from the collector toward the cathode. The same magnetic focusing that guides the electron beam forces the plasma {{into the path of}} the electron beam but flowing in the opposite direction. This introduces FM modulation which degrades Doppler performance. To prevent this, liquid coolant with minimum pressure and flow rate is required, and deionized water is normally used in most high power surface radar systems that utilize Doppler processing.|$|E
25|$|Electronic {{components:}} {{one of the}} endeavours {{undertaken by}} the DRDO has been to create a substantial local design and development capability within India, both in {{the private and public}} sectors. This policy has led to several hard to obtain or otherwise denied items, being designed and manufactured in India. These include components such as radar subsystems (product specific <b>travelling</b> <b>wave</b> tubes) to components necessary for electronic warfare and other cutting edge projects. Today, there are a range of firms across India, which design and manufacture key components for DRDO, allowing it to source locally for quite a substantial chunk of its procurement. The DRDO has also endeavoured to use COTS (Commercial off the shelf) processors and technology, and follow Open Architecture standards, wherever possible, in order to pre-empt obsolescence issues and follow industry practise. One significant example is the development of an Open Architecture computer for the Light Combat Aircraft, based on the PowerPC architecture and VME64 standard. The earlier Mission computer utilising Intel 486 DX chips has already seen success, with variants being present on the Su-30 MKI, Jaguar and MiG-27 Upgrades for the Indian Air Force.|$|E
500|$|Because of its {{densely packed}} neural layers, {{of all the}} brain {{structures}} which generate the hippocampal theta rhythm, the hippocampus generates {{some of the largest}} EEG signals as theta waves [...] In some situations the EEG is dominated by regular waves at 3 to 10Hz, often continuing for many seconds.
