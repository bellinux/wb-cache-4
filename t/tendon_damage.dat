5|$|Prior to the 1987–88 season Vanbiesbrouck {{was hit by}} a puck {{under his}} mask in practice, which caused a non-displaced {{fracture}} of his lower jaw and a broken tooth. Fortunately for him the injury did not require his jaw to be wired shut, {{and he was able to}} return to practice the next day. He showed no ill effects from the injury, playing in 56 games, winning 27. On June 13, 1988 Vanbiesbrouck suffered nerve damage to his left wrist after a glass coffee table he was sitting on collapsed and broken glass lacerated his ulnar nerve and three tendons. He was sitting on the table assembling video equipment in anticipation of the birth of his first child. The glass broke beneath him, and as he braced for the fall, his wrist was cut by the glass. Vanbiesbrouck required five hours of microsurgery to remove glass from his wrist and repair the nerve and <b>tendon</b> <b>damage.</b> He was initially expected to miss 4–6 months, but he recovered in time to attend the Rangers pre-season training camp just 3 months later.

40|$|The {{healing process}} of {{ruptured}} tendons is suboptimal, taking months to achieve tissue with inferior properties to healthy tendon. Mechanical loading {{has been shown}} to positively influence tendon healing. However, High frequency low magnitude (HFLM) loads which have shown promise in maintaining healthy tendon properties,have not been studied with in vitro injury models. Here we present and validate an in vitroscratch tendon tissue injury model to investigate effects of HFLM loading on the properties ofinjured rat tail tendon fascicles (RTTFs). A longitudinal tendon tear was simulated using a needle aseptically to scratch a defined length along individual RTTFs. Tissue viability, biomechanical and biochemical parameters were investigated before and 7 days after culture. The effects of static, HFLM(20 Hz), low frequency(1 Hz) cyclic loading or no load were also investigated. Tendon viability was confirmed in damaged RTTFs after 7 days of culture and the effects of a 0. 77 ± 0. 06 cm scratch on the mechanical property(tangent modulus) and tissue metabolism in <b>damaged</b> <b>tendons</b> were consistent, showing significant damage severity compared with intact <b>tendons.</b> <b>Damaged</b> <b>tendon</b> fascicles receiving HFLM(20 Hz) loads displayed significantly higher mean tangent modulus than unloaded damaged tendons(212. 7 ± 14. 94 v 92. 7 ± 15. 59 MPa), and <b>damaged</b> <b>tendons</b> receiving static loading(117. 9 ± 10. 65 MPa). HFLM stimulation maintained metabolic activity in 7 day cultured <b>damaged</b> <b>tendons</b> at similar levels to fresh <b>tendons</b> immediately following <b>damage.</b> Only <b>damaged</b> <b>tendons</b> receiving HFLM loads showed significantly higher metabolism than unloaded damaged tendons(RFU- 7021 ± 635. 9 v 3745. 1 ± 641. 7).

2500|$|<b>Tendons</b> {{are easily}} <b>damaged</b> if placed under too much strain, which {{can result in}} a painful, and {{possibly}} career-ending, injury. Tendinitis is most commonly seen in high performance horses that gallop or jump.

As {{a result of}} repetitive microtrauma {{in the setting of}} a degenerative rotator cuff tendon, inflammatory mediators alter the local environment, and oxidative stress induces tenocyte apoptosis causing further rotator cuff tendon degeneration. A neural theory also exists that suggests neural overstimulation leads to the recruitment of inflammatory cells and may also contribute to tendon degeneration.|$|E

Here, we hypothesize that the AgNPs synthesized from Comfrey leaf extract could be used for protection against UVB-induced skin photoaging. To test this hypothesis, markers of skin photoaging, MMP- 1, IL- 6 and procollagen type 1, were analyzed using PCR with human keratinocyte cells (HaCaT).|$|R

2500|$|The Nationals {{took three}} out of four from the {{division}} rival Marlins at Nationals Park, capping the series win on August 10 with a diving catch down the left field line by rookie outfielder Andrew Stevenson to take away an RBI and extra bases from Miami second baseman Dee Gordon with two outs {{in the top of the}} ninth. The catch preserved a 3–2 ballgame as closer Sean Doolittle locked down the save. Also in the series, on August 9, first baseman Ryan Zimmerman turned in a two-homer effort as he overtook Tim Wallach as the RBI leader in Montreal–Washington franchise history. Wallach, who played for the Montreal Expos, was in the visitors' dugout for the series as the Marlins' bench coach. After an August 11 rainout and a lengthy rain delay on August 12, in the first inning of a late-night home game against the San Francisco Giants, Nationals right fielder Bryce Harper slipped on first base while running out a grounder, crashed to the ground, and had to be carried off the field. After the Nationals downed the Giants 3–1, with the game finishing early in the morning of August 13, manager Dusty Baker announced Harper had hyperextended his left knee. General manager Mike Rizzo said later in the day that tests showed Harper had [...] "significant" [...] bruising of the bones in his left knee but had avoided any ligament or <b>tendon</b> <b>damage,</b> meaning he was expected to be able to return later in the season.

40|$|Rheumatoid {{arthritis}} (RA) is {{a chronic}} inflammatory disease {{caused by a}} T cell-driven autoimmune process, which majorly involves the diarthrodial joints. It affects 1 % of the US population, and approximately 70 % of patients with RA develop pathologies of the hand, especially of the metacarpophalangeal joints (MCP). Furthermore, also the extensor and flexor tendons of the fingers are frequently involved. The first line of treatment should be conservative. Three general classes of drugs are currently available for RA: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, and disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Encouraging results have been obtained using DMARDs. However, when severe deformities occur or when patients are unresponsive to medical management and injections therapy, surgical intervention should be performed to relieve pain and restore function. Several surgical options have been described {{for the management of}} MCP joint deformities, including soft tissue procedures, arthrodesis, and prosthetic replacement.

The intricacies of this organi-sation, however, are not yet well defined.

This paper demonstrates a multimodal imaging approach for characteris-ing tendon tissue at multiple spatial scales; high field magnetic resonance imaging and microscopy both distinguish between normal and <b>damaged</b> <b>tendon,</b> at different spatial scales. A multiple cylindrical helix model, which accounts {{for a range of}} observed crimp architectures, is proposed for interpreting images of normal and <b>damaged</b> <b>tendon</b> mi-crostructure. Image-derived parameters, helix radius and pitch, are fitted to a mechanical helix model to predict changes in material property from tendon structure.

40|$|The static {{stability}} of a Tension Leg Platform (TLP) with an intact tendon system is principally provided by its tendons and hence {{quite different from}} those of a conventional ship or even a floating structure positioned by its mooring system. Because small deformations in tendons are capable of providing sufficient righting moment to a TLP, the contribution from the inclination of its hull is relatively insignificant, especially when its tendon system is intact. When the tendon system of a TLP is completely damaged, the {{static stability}} of a TLP behaves and is calculated in a similar manner as those of a conventional ship. In the case of a TLP with a partially <b>damaged</b> <b>tendon</b> system, the stability of a TLP may be provided by the deformation of its tendons and to a certain extent the inclination of its hull. Several hurricanes in recent years have raised concerns about the feasibility and the robustness of the TLP concept in the deep water Gulf of Mexico. To the best of our knowledge, existing publications on the research of static stability of TLPs are limited. This study investigates the static stability of different types of TLPs representing those deployed in the Gulf of Mexico, under three different scenarios. That is, a TLP with 1) an intact tendon system, 2) a partially <b>damaged</b> <b>tendon</b> system, and 3) a completely <b>damaged</b> <b>tendon</b> system. The four different types of TLP chosen for this study are 1) a conventional four-leg TLP, 2) three-leg mini TLP, 3) extended four-leg TLP and 4) mini four-leg TLP. To avoid buckling and yielding occurring in a tendon, we define that the maximum righting moment provided by an intact or partially <b>damaged</b> <b>tendon</b> system is reached when the tension in one or more tendons on the down tension leg becomes zero or when the tension in one or more tendons on the up tension leg starts to yield. This definition leads us to identify the most dangerous (or vulnerable) directions of met-ocean conditions to a TLP with an intact or partially <b>damaged</b> <b>tendon</b> system. Hence, our finding may also be used in the study on the pitch/roll dynamic stability of a TLP. The righting moments of each TLP in the three different scenarios are respectively computed and compared with related wind-induce static upsetting moment at certain velocities. By comparing their ratios, the static stability of a TLP and the redundancy of its tendon system may be revealed, which has important implication to the design of a TLP...|$|R
