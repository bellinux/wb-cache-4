He {{is said to}} have taken ill at Northampton, and <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> clothed in a monk's habit while on his deathbed. He was buried in the chapterhouse at Abingdon Abbey, which he left a bequest to. A copy of a charter from Archbishop Theobald of Bec, recorded in a cartulary, records most of Basset's manors. While most of the estates seem <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> held by Basset as a sub-tenant, four of the estates appear <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> held as a tenant-in-chief. These estates were not very valuable, and Basset can not be considered a baron, although his son Richard managed through marriage to {{become a member of the}} barons. He held lands in nine counties, perhaps centred in Berkshire.|$|E

5|$|Halotus is {{primarily}} remembered for his suspected {{involvement in the}} conspiracy and poisoning of Emperor Claudius on 13 October (times of death are in dispute; see below) 54 AD. It is possible that Claudius died of natural causes, and the actual manner of the poisoning, in regards to which poison may have been used, in which food {{it could have been}} hidden, etc., remains unclear. It is considered most likely, considering the writings of various ancient historians, that the poison was concealed in mushrooms (as Claudius was known <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> particularly fond of them), and Agrippina the Younger, Claudius' wife, is thought <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> the most likely to have instigated the murder or <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> the lead conspirator in the plot to overthrow Claudius.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION The {{system that}} <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> solved {{is of the}} form Ax=b, where A R nxn is symmetric, {{positive}} definite and diagonal dominant. In addition, A is very sparse. Less than 1 % of its elements are non-zero. For larger dimensions A becomes even more sparse. No assumptions can {{be made on the}} distribution of the non-zero elements. This special class of linear equation systems <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> solved in a subtask of an automatic placement program for VLSI design where total interconnection length between modules <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> minimized.
