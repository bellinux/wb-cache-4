5|$|On October 30, as {{permitted}} by territorial law, Ike Clanton filed murder {{charges against the}} Earps and Holliday.

5|$|Euell {{was taken}} to a {{hospital}} and died about an hour after the shooting. He was never able to formally identify Shay as the shooter. When Shay was arrested in his hotel room that night, police officers said that he appeared to be intoxicated. He refused to make any statements. He was held without bail and charged with second-degree murder. A conviction carried the possibility of life imprisonment. A few days after the shooting, American Association owners began to collect funds to assist in Shay's criminal defense. As the case was about <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>trial,</b> one of the attorneys became ill, so the proceedings were delayed for several weeks. The trial was reset for November 12, 1917.|$|E
5|$|Four {{days after}} the shootout, Ike Clanton filed murder charges against Doc Holliday and the Earps. Wyatt and Holliday were arrested and brought before Justice of the Peace, Wells Spicer. Morgan and Virgil were still {{recovering}} at home. Only Wyatt and Holliday were required to post $10,000 bail, which was paid by their attorney Thomas Fitch, local mine owner E.B. Gage, Wells Fargo undercover agent Fred Dodge, and other business owners appreciative of the Earps' efforts to maintain order. Virgil Earp was suspended as town marshal pending {{the outcome of the}} trial. Justice Spicer convened a preliminary hearing on October 31 to determine if there was enough evidence <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>trial.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Capote based the {{character}} of Idabel in Other Voices, Other Rooms on his Monroeville neighbor and best friend, Harper Lee. Capote once acknowledged this: [...] "Mr. and Mrs. Lee, Harper Lee's mother and father, lived very near. She was my best friend. Did you ever read her book, To Kill a Mockingbird? I'm a character in that book, which {{takes place in the}} same small town in Alabama where we lived. Her father was a lawyer, and she and I used <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>trials</b> all the time as children. We <b>went</b> <b>to</b> the <b>trials</b> instead of going to the movies." [...] After the Pulitzer Prize was awarded to Lee in 1961 and Capote published In Cold Blood in 1966, the authors became increasingly distant from each other.|$|R

25|$|In {{the last}} years of his life, Rhodes was stalked by Polish princess Catherine Radziwiłł, born Rzewuska, married into a noble Polish family called Radziwiłł. Radziwiłł falsely claimed that she was engaged to Rhodes, or that they were having an affair. She asked him to marry her, but Rhodes refused. In reaction, she accused him of loan fraud.

25|$|In April 2007 {{the defense}} {{asked for more}} time to prepare its case and {{presented}} the judge with four motions. In addition to the charges of premeditated murder, at the time Martinez was charged with one count each of wrongful possession of a privately owned firearm, unexploded ordnance, and alcohol.

Shockley's biographer Joel Shurkin, a science writer {{on the staff of}} Stanford University during those years, sums this up as saying that the statement was defamatory, but Shockley's reputation was not worth much by the time the trial reached a verdict.|$|E

50|$|Most {{states require}} that a {{defendant}} must plead not guilty and <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>trial</b> <b>to</b> maintain {{the right to}} have state appellate review of constitutional challenges he might make to arrest, admissibility of evidence, or the voluntariness of a confession.

25|$|A {{thorough}} {{investigation of the}} Luzhniki disaster corresponded with the new policies of Yuri Andropov, a former KGB head, who became {{the leader of the}} country just one month after the tragedy. He became known in the Soviet Union for his efforts to restore discipline {{at all levels of the}} society that had been loosened by the last years of Brezhnev's rule. On 17 December 1982, two months after the stampede, he even went as far as firing the interior minister Nikolai Shchelokov (Николай Щёлоков), the Soviet Union's top police officer, after learning of the corruption allegations against him. Shchelokov was later stripped of all state decorations, and committed suicide when he was about <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>trial.</b>|$|E
25|$|The law {{provides}} for investigative detention {{of up to}} two years for indicted persons awaiting or undergoing trial; the period may be extended for one year in limited situations. The slow pace of the justice system often resulted in lengthy detentions beyond the period stipulated by law. CELS reported that prisoners waited an average of three years to be tried, with some cases taking as long as six years <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>trial.</b> A convicted prisoner usually received credit for time already served. In 2008, in Buenos Aires Province, provisional statistics from CELS indicated that nearly 75 percent of detainees were in pretrial detention, while the Buenos Aires Provincial Memory Commission Committee Against Torture reported that 78 percent of the approximately 26,000 detainees in provincial prisons were awaiting trial.|$|E
25|$|Throughout his term, Netanyahu {{was opposed}} by the {{political}} left wing in Israel and lost support from the right because of his concessions to the Palestinians in Hebron and elsewhere, and due to his negotiations with Arafat generally. Netanyahu lost favor with the Israeli public after a long chain of scandals involving his marriage and corruption charges. In 1997, police recommended that Netanyahu be indicted on corruption charges for influence-peddling. He was accused of appointing an attorney general who would reduce the charges and prosecutors ruled that there was insufficient evidence <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>trial.</b> In 1999, Netanyahu faced another scandal when the Israel Police recommended that he be tried for corruption for $100,000 in free services from a government contractor; Israel's attorney general did not prosecute, citing difficulties with evidence.|$|E

There were scores of witnesses to identify J. B. McNamara as being present practically on the very day, and one at least, in the building.

Victor hired Paul Williams (Doug Davidson) and a range of attorneys to free Nick, who had <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>trial</b> for attempted murder. Nick was found guilty and sent to jail, where he spent Christmas of 1995. However, in February 1996 he was acquitted when Amy came forward as the actual shooter after Matt tried to rape her. Amy was in seclusion after recovering from mental trauma. Matt skipped town after he became in trouble for lying in court, claiming he remembered Nick shooting him. Nick and Sharon then married.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, {{there have}} been {{multiple}} lawsuits filed against Norwood, {{all of which were}} ultimately settled out of court by her attorney Ed McPherson. Aboudihaj's parents filed a $50 million wrongful death lawsuit against Norwood. Filed on January 30, 2007, the lawsuit was initially set <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>trial</b> in April 2009, but was eventually canceled as Norwood had settled out of court with Aboudihaj's parents. Aboudihaj's husband also filed a lawsuit against Norwood, suing her for an undisclosed amount of financial relief to cover medical and funeral expenses, as well as legal costs and other damages. He rejected his part of a $1.2 million settlement offer in February 2009, but did settle in November of that year. The couple's two children, who also filed a lawsuit against Norwood, received $300,000 each, according to court documents filed in L.A. County Superior Court on June 2, 2009. Two other drivers who were involved and injured in the accident also filed a lawsuit against Norwood. They settled with Norwood for undisclosed amounts.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, John Bachini {{started a}} claim against Celador, ITV, and five {{individuals}} {{who claimed that}} they had created Millionaire. Bachini claimed they had used ideas from his 1982 board game format, a two-page TV format concept known as Millionaire dating from 1990, and the telephone mechanics from another of his concepts, BT Lottery, also dating from 1990. Bachini submitted his documents to Paul Smith, from a sister company of Celador's, in March 1995 and again in January 1996, and to Claudia Rosencrantz of ITV in January 1996. Bachini claimed that they used 90% of his Millionaire format, which contained all of the same procedures as the actual British Millionaires pilot: twenty questions, three lifelines, two safe havens (£1,000 and £32,000), and even starting from £1.00. Bachini's lifelines were known by different names; he never claimed he coined the phrase phone-a-friend, but Bull and Tim Boone claimed they did. Celador claimed the franchise originated from a format known as The Cash Mountain, a five-page document created by either Briggs or his wife Jo Sandilands in October 1995. The defendants brought Bachini to a summary hearing, and lost. Bachini won the right <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>trial,</b> but could not continue at trial due to serious illness, so Celador reached an out-of-court settlement with Bachini.|$|E
