25|$|Cats {{have been}} venerated in the Near East since antiquity, a {{tradition}} adopted by Islam, albeit {{in a much}} modified form. According to many hadiths, Mohammad prohibited the persecution and killing of cats. Muhammad purportedly allowed a cat to give birth on his cloak, and cut off <b>the</b> <b>sleeve</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> prayer robe rather than wake his favourite cat, a female named Muezza, who was sleeping on it.|$|E
2500|$|... 23 March 1961 was {{the tenth}} {{day of a}} 15-day {{endurance}} experiment in a low pressure altitude chamber at the Institute of Biomedical Problems in Moscow. The chamber's atmosphere was at least 50% oxygen. Bondarenko, having completed work for the day, removed some monitoring biosensors from his body and washed his skin with an alcohol-soaked cotton ball, which he then carelessly threw away. The cotton ball landed on an electric hot plate which he was using to brew a cup of tea. The cotton ignited and Bondarenko tried to smother the flames with <b>the</b> <b>sleeve</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> woolen coveralls, which caught fire in the chamber's oxygen-rich atmosphere.|$|E
2500|$|Chapter 4 {{continues}} with the satire {{in the form}} of a debate between Inflammable Gass and Mrs. Sigtagatist. When Sigtagatist tells Gass that he should always attend church on Sundays, Gass declares, [...] "if I had not a place of profit that forces me to go to church I'd see the parsons all hang'd a parcel of lying." [...] Sigtigatist then proclaims [...] "O, if it were not for churches & chapels I should not have liv'd so long." [...] She then proudly recalls a figure from her youth, Minister Huffcap, who would [...] "kick the bottom of the Pulpit out, with Passion, would tear off <b>the</b> <b>sleeve</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> Gown, & set his wig on fire & throw it at the people he'd cry & stamp & kick & sweat and all for the good of their souls." ...|$|E

60|$|O'Grady {{was sitting}} up {{with his back to}} <b>the</b> wall; <b>the</b> <b>sleeves</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> jacket and shirt had been cut off, and a {{tourniquet}} was on his arm just above the elbow.|$|R
60|$|Bianca saw her father's fragile arms {{stretch out}} into the night through <b>the</b> <b>sleeves</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> white garment, as though expecting to be {{received}} at once into the Universal Brotherhood of the thin air.|$|R
2500|$|According to Islamic tradition, Muezza (or Muʿizza) (...) was the Islamic Prophet Muhammad's {{favorite}} cat. In legend, Muhammad awoke {{one day to}} {{the sounds}} of the Adhan, the Muslim daily call to prayer. Preparing to attend, he began to dress himself; however, he soon discovered his cat Muezza sleeping on <b>the</b> <b>sleeve</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> prayer robe. Rather than wake her, he used a pair of scissors to cut the sleeve off, leaving the cat undisturbed. Another story is, upon returning from the mosque, Muhammad received a bow from Muezza. He then smiled and gently stroked his beloved cat three times. While the folktale of Muezza is found in both Muslim and non-Muslim sources and many hadith reference cats in a positive manner, it {{does not appear to be}} attested before the 20th century. It may be based on a similar story told by the followers of the medieval Sufi sheikh Ahmed ar-Rifa'i, who is also said to have cut his sleeve because a cat was sleeping on it, then stitched it up later and said [...] "nothing changed".|$|E
2500|$|Oldfield is a {{motorcycle}} fan and has five bikes. [...] These include a BMW R1200GS, a Suzuki GSX-R750, a Suzuki GSX-R1000, and a Yamaha R1.

Since 1980, he has been a licensed pilot and has flown fixed wing aircraft (the first of which was a Beechcraft Sierra) and helicopters (including the Agusta Bell 47G, which featured on <b>the</b> <b>sleeve</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> cover version of the ABBA song [...] "Arrival" [...] as a parody of their album artwork).

He has endorsed the Mercedes-Benz S-Class in the Mercedes UK magazine. [...] Oldfield also considers himself to be a Trekkie (fan of the popular science fiction television series Star Trek). He noted in an interview in 2008 that he had two boats.|$|E

60|$|The {{operations}} that followed were singularly unpleasant, and Frank felt {{a good deal}} less enthusiastic about hunting when he washed <b>his</b> hands and <b>the</b> <b>sleeves</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> jacket in <b>the</b> creek after they were over.|$|R

60|$|Inga {{said nothing}} and {{appeared}} {{not to notice}} the King's failure. So now Rinkitink, with a serious look on his fat, red face, took off his purple robe and rolled up <b>the</b> <b>sleeves</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> tunic and tried again.|$|R
60|$|When Charnock stopped, a {{man without}} a coat and with <b>the</b> <b>sleeves</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> fine white shirt rolled up came out. He as rather an old man and his {{movements}} were slack; his face was hard, {{but on the whole}} expressionless.|$|R
60|$|Peter Blood, {{stripped}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> coat, <b>the</b> <b>sleeves</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> coarse shirt {{rolled to}} the elbow, and holding a bloody rag in his hand, stood at gaze a moment.

60|$|Newman Noggs was {{the sole}} actor.

60|$|Sometimes, of an evening, when Janet {{was helping}} Mrs. Maturin in her {{planting}} or weeding, Insall would join them, rolling up <b>the</b> <b>sleeves</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> flannel shirt and kneeling beside {{them in the}} garden paths.
