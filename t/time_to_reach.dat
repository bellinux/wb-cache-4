5|$|An initial demo of {{the game}} was made {{available}} in August 2007 for Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows. This demo included cutscenes to introduce the player to Rapture, the game's tutorial section, and its first levels; the demo also included weapons, plasmids, and tonics {{that would otherwise be}} introduced later in the full title, as to give the player more of the features that would be found in the published game.

5|$|VKORC1 polymorphisms explain 30% of {{the dose}} {{variation}} between patients: particular mutations make VKORC1 {{less susceptible to}} suppression by warfarin. There are two main haplotypes that explain 25% of variation: low-dose haplotype group (A) and a high-dose haplotype group (B). VKORC1 polymorphisms explain why African Americans are on average relatively resistant to warfarin (higher proportion of group B haplotypes), while Asian Americans are generally more sensitive (higher proportion of group A haplotypes). Group A VKORC1 polymorphisms {{lead to a more}} rapid achievement of a therapeutic INR, but also a shorter <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> an INR over 4, which is associated with bleeding.|$|E

5|$|After Navy forced North Texas {{to begin}} the second quarter with a punt, Midshipmen running back Eric Kettani fumbled {{the ball on the}} second play of the next drive and the Mean Green recovered. The next eight {{possessions}} – four from each team – resulted in touchdowns. Four of the drives took less than a minute of game <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> the end zone, and a fifth took barely over a minute. In the final two minutes of the half the Midshipmen forced the Mean Green to punt after three plays, and Navy quarterback Kaipo-Noa Kaheaku-Enhada threw a 47-yard pass to running back Reggie Campbell. The Midshipmen ran for another touchdown on the next play. North Texas got the ball back with seven seconds left in the half, but chose not to attempt to score again.

5|$|An {{invitation}} {{was sent}} to the Launceston Cricket Club in February with a view to playing that March. The invitation was accepted but the match was delayed when the acceptance letter was not posted in <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> the steamer transporting mail. The MCC repeated their invitation later in 1850. While the match was being arranged, legislation passed in the United Kingdom to separate the Port Phillip District, which was to be renamed as Victoria, from the colony of New South Wales. When news of this much anticipated decision reached the colony late in 1850, two weeks of celebrations were arranged in Melbourne to mark independence. The delayed cricket match, now scheduled for February 1851, became part of the general festivities, although formal independence did not come about until later in 1851. Furthermore, the fixture was to be the first Australian intercolonial match and was later considered the first first-class cricket match in Australia.|$|E
5|$|During the night, Pyrrhus {{was able}} to enter Argos. While Pausanias recounts that he did so by force, Plutarch asserts that Diamperes Gate had been left open for the Epiriotes by Aristeas. Hammond opines {{that it is more}} likely that Aristeas {{admitted}} Pyrrhus into the city. Although Pyrrhus' Gauls were able to occupy the Argive agora, the rest of the army was delayed due to the war elephants being too large to pass through the gate. In order for them to enter, the towers need to be taken off their backs and reattached once they were inside the city. Furthermore, Pyrrhus left the majority of his army outside the city walls under the command of his son Helenus. This delay gave the Argives enough <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> their citadel, the Aspis, and seek aid from Antigonus. The Macedonian king responded immediately, advancing towards the city walls and sending a relief force inside under the command of his son Halcyoneus.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} thermoelectric transport through Andreev interferometers.

A large average thermopower furthermore emerges whenever there is an asymmetry in the dwell <b>times</b> <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> the superconducting contacts. When this is the case, the thermopower is odd in ϕ. In contrast, when the average <b>times</b> <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> either superconducting contact are the same, the average thermopower is zero, however mesoscopic effects (analogous to universal conductance fluctuations) lead to a sample-dependent thermopower which is systematically even in ϕ...|$|R

It closed in theaters on December 7, 2006, with a $423.3 million haul. Thus, in North America, it is the seventeenth-highest-grossing film, although, adjusted for inflation, the film ranks forty-eight. It is also the highest-grossing 2006 film, the highest-grossing Pirates of the Caribbean film, and the seventh-highest-grossing Disney film.

After 46 days in theaters (July 2, 2011), it became the eighth film in cinema history and the fourth film released by Walt Disney Studios to cross the $1-billion-mark. It set a record for the fastest Disney-distributed film to reach the milestone (first surpassed by Marvel's The Avengers) and it is the fifth-fastest film overall to achieve this.|$|E
5|$|Since 1985 the {{government}} of Mobile has consisted of a mayor and a seven-member city council. The mayor is elected at-large, and the council members are elected {{from each of the}} seven city council single-member districts (SMDs). A supermajority of five votes is required to conduct council business. This form of city government was chosen by the voters after the previous form of government, which used three city commissioners who were elected at-large, was ruled to substantially dilute the minority vote and violate the Voting Rights Act in the 1975 case Bolden v. City of Mobile. Due to appeals, the case took <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> settlement and establishment of a new electoral system. Municipal elections are held every four years.|$|E

Mating activity among wood turtles peaks {{in the spring and}} again in the fall, although it is known to mate throughout the portion of the year they are active. However, it has been observed mating in December. In one rare instance, a female wood turtle hybridized with a male Blanding's turtle.|$|E
5|$|Before they sailed for England, Australia played three warm-up matches. The {{first two}} were two-day games against Tasmania in Hobart {{and at the}} Northern Tasmanian Cricket Association Ground, Launceston; the third was a three-day match against Western Australia in Perth. In Hobart, Australia scored 538/5 {{declared}} with centuries by Barnes, Hassett and Harvey in reply to 122. Using a mixture of pace and spin, they reduced Tasmania to 186/7 when time ran out. In Launceston, Australia won by an innings and 49 runs. Toshack took 5/24 as Tasmania fell for 123. Australia then scored 288 before five bowlers shared the wickets as Tasmania fell for just 116, Barnes taking 3/1. Four days later, on Saturday 13 March, the Australians were at the WACA Ground where they found a tougher test from Western Australia. Western Australia scored 348 as Wally Langdon made 112, while five bowlers took two wickets each. Australia replied with 442/7 declared, including 115 apiece by Morris and Bradman. Western Australia only had <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> 62/3 and the game was drawn. The match attracted a total crowd of 30,500.|$|E
5|$|England's {{opponents in}} the final were West Germany. It was England who {{dominated}} the final but it was Banks who was beaten first. A weak header from Ray Wilson handed a chance to Helmut Haller, who sent an accurate but relatively weak shot {{into the corner of}} the net; Banks had been unsighted by Jack Charlton, and he failed to adjust his position in <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> the ball. England equalised through a Geoff Hurst header within six minutes and went ahead late in the second half through Martin Peters. With seconds left in the game, Lothar Emmerich sent a free kick into the England penalty area, and the ball fell to Wolfgang Weber, who guided the ball over a lunging Ray Wilson and an outstretched Banks into the net to take the game into extra-time. In extra-time, the Germans sent shots in at the England goal which Banks managed to catch and control without any great danger. Hurst scored two goals to complete his hat-trick, and though many claimed his second goal never crossed the line Banks always maintained his belief that the officials called the decision correctly. Between these goals Banks had to deal with a fiery shot from Sigfried Held, and was later exposed only for Uwe Seeler to come just centimetres away from connecting with the ball.|$|E

5|$|For {{those who}} were not injured or killed {{outright}} by moving objects, there was little <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> safety, especially for the men who were manning the guns on the main deck or fetching ammunition and supplies in the hold. The companionways that connected the decks with one another would have become bottlenecks for fleeing men, something indicated by the positioning of many of the skeletons recovered from the wreck. What turned the sinking into a major tragedy in terms of lives lost was the anti-boarding netting that covered the upper decks in the waist (the midsection of the ship) and the sterncastle. With the exception of the men who were stationed in the tops in the masts, most of those who managed to get up from below deck were trapped under the netting; they would have been in view of the surface, and their colleagues above, but with little or no chance to break through, and were dragged down with the ship. Out of a crew of at least 400, fewer than 35 escaped, a catastrophic casualty rate of over 90%.|$|E
