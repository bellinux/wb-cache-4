Diesel engines were used in airships and were tried in aircraft in the late 1920s and 1930s, but never widely used. <b>Their</b> <b>main</b> <b>advantages</b> <b>are</b> their excellent specific fuel consumption and the somewhat higher density of their fuel, but these have been outweighed {{by a combination of}} inherent disadvantages compared to gasoline-fueled or turboprop engines.

One of <b>their</b> <b>main</b> <b>advantages</b> <b>is</b> that they offer {{a way to deal}} with the fact that the Sobolev space W1,1 is not a reflexive space; since W1,1 is not reflexive, it is not always true that a bounded sequence has a weakly convergent subsequence, which is a desideratum in many applications.|$|R

40|$|When {{microsatellites}} {{were introduced}} {{as a tool}} for parentage determination, they were considered to be the ideal markers for this purpose (Queller et al. 1993). <b>Their</b> <b>main</b> <b>advantages</b> <b>are</b> their large numbers in the genome, high levels of polymorphism, {{and the fact that they}} can be scored locus by locus with PCR. Analyses can thus be performed on tiny and even par-tially degraded DNA samples. Unfortunately microsa-tellites must be cloned separately for every studied spe-cies. Later studies using microsatellites for parentage de-termination have revealed new weaknesses.

The sensitivity of experiments applying this detector technique can be limited by the performance of the light channel and the presence of external backgrounds in the region of interest. In the framework of the CRESST-II experiment, we developed and successfully tested a novel detector design addressing both challenges. Using a large scale (≈[60]cm^ 2), beaker-shaped silicon light absorber, the signal height recorded in the light channel is improved by a factor 2. 5 compared to conventional CRESTT-II detector modules. In combination with a large carrier crystal, a true 4 π veto system is established which allows to tag external background sources. Comment: 7 pages, 5 fugures, submitted to EPJ-...|$|E

The research community has devoted a considerable amount of time to provide solutions for the localization problem. Several methodologies have been proposed the most common of which are based in the Bayes rule. Other methodologies include the Kalman filter and the Monte Carlo localization filter wich will be addressed in next sections.

40|$|International audienceSustainable slow-release {{fertilizers}} {{have been reported}} as environmentally friendly alternatives to highly soluble commercial products. <b>Their</b> <b>main</b> <b>advantages</b> <b>are</b> that they dissolve and release nutrients into soils {{in a way that}} assures bioavailability of nutrients to plants {{over a long period of}} growth. In addition, novel formulations can reduce or eliminate environmental problems caused by excess use of conventional fertilizers, such as eutrophication and atmospheric pollution. In this study, the solid-state mechanochemical activation method was used to prepare potential fertilizers by milling montmorillonite (MMT) or talc with K 2 HPO 4. Characterizations by several instrumental techniques evidenced phase transformations, while kinetic studies and modeling indicated promising release performance. Even though the potassium release behavior was similar for both systems, the kinetic studies showed that phosphorus release profiles were different. Since potassium struvite (K-struvite—MgKPO 4 · 6 H 2 O) was formed during the release experiments, talc based potential {{slow-release fertilizers}} displayed slower release behavior compared to MMT...|$|E

That is why the popularity of empirical methods has increased. <b>Their</b> <b>main</b> <b>advantages</b> <b>are</b> speed of calculations and low costs. Comparison of various empirical methods (pedotransfer functions) for the determination of saturated hydraulic conductivity coefficient was the purpose of this work.

Calculations were carried out for the soil samples of differential texture. The obtained results shows the methods used for the determination of permeability coefficient differ considerably. Mean values obtained by analysed methods fluctuated between 0. 0006 and 12. 0 m·day− 1. The results of calculations by the chosen methods were compared with the results of the laboratory method. The best compatibility with laboratory method was obtained by using the Terzaghi method...|$|E
