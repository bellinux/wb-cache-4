40|$|We study stripe {{orders of}} charge and spin density {{waves in the}} {{extended}} Hubbard model with the nearest-neighbor Coulomb repulsion V within the mean field approximation. We obtain V vs. <b>T(temperature)</b> phase diagram for the on-site Coulomb interaction U/t= 8. 0 and the filling n= 0. 8, here t is a nearest-neighbor transfer energy. Our result shows that the diagonal stripe spin density wave state (SDW) is stable for small V, but for large V the most stable state changes to a charge density wave-antiferromagnetic (CDW-AF) state. Especially we find at low temperature and for a certain range of value of V, a vertical stripe CDW-AF state becomes stable. Comment: LaTeX 9 pages, 17 figures, uses jpsj. st...|$|E
40|$|We microscopically {{study the}} effect of the {{magnetic}} field (Zeeman splitting) on the superconducting state in a model for quasi-one-dimensional organic superconductors (TMTSF) _ 2 X. We investigate the competition between spin singlet and spin triplet pairings and the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov(FFLO) state by random phase approximation. While we studied the competition by comparison with the eigenvalue of the gap equation at a fixed temperature in our previous study (Phys. Rev. Lett. 102 (2009) 016403), here we obtain both the T_c for each pairing state and a phase diagram in the <b>T(temperature)</b> -h_z(field) -V_y(strength of the charge fluctuation) space. The phase diagram shows that consecutive transitions from singlet pairing to the FFLO state and further to S_z= 1 triplet pairing can occur upon increasing the magnetic field when 2 k_F charge fluctuations coexist with 2 k_F spin fluctuations. In the FFLO state, the singlet d-wave and S_z= 0 triplet f-wave components are strongly mixed especially when the charge fluctuations are strong. Comment: 11 pages, 9 figure...|$|E
40|$|Fucoidan is {{a complex}} {{polysaccharide}} compounds found in brown algae. Fucoidan exhibits various biological properties for disease prevention. There are various methods used to extract fucoidan from brown algae, such as using ethanol, acetone, HCl and microwave. This research aims to extract and characterize fucoidan from Sargassum sp. using simple methods with the variables on extracting solutions, temperature and time of extraction. Extraction solution used were water and HCl. <b>Ttemperature</b> used was 50 °C, 70 °C and 100 °C using 1, 2 and 4 hours. The result showed that the highest extraction yield {{was obtained from the}} extraction by water with 100 °C and 4 hours of extraction. Fucoidan extracted by water has molecular weight of 57. 77 kDa and 2. 71 kDa, while fucoidan extracted by HCl has molecular weight of 46. 43 kDa and 3. 38 kDa. The proportion of high molecular weight fucoidan extracted by water was 52. 24 % compared with HCl was 44. 10 %...|$|E
40|$|The {{electron}} density distributions of ＄γ-Na_{x}CoO_{ 2 }＄ {{have been obtained}} by the maximum entropy method and the Rietveld analysis using synchrotron radiation X-ray diffracton data at 100 K, 200 K and 300 K. In the Rietveld refinement, the deviation of (008) and (108) peaks is very large relative {{to that of other}} reflections with increase of Na contant x. And same behavior showed by the change of <b>ttemperature.</b> Electron density distribution based on synchrotron radiation X-ray diffraction data showed the direct observation of the formation of the Co-O hybridization with increasing the Na content. This means increase of covalency between O 2 p and ＄Co t_{ 2 g}＄ in the ＄CoO_{ 2 }＄ layer. But not showed the change of {{electron density}} distribution between 100 K and 300 K. These facts indicate the essential difference for respective cause of the peak deviation. Key words:＄γ-Na_{x}CoO_{ 2 }＄, Synchrotron radiation X-ray diffraction, Maximum Entropy Method...|$|E
