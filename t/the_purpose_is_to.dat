25|$|On site {{processing}} {{is planned}} to work continuously, cleaning {{a small fraction}} of the salt every day and sending it back to the reactor. There is no need to make the fuel salt very clean; <b>the</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> keep the concentration of fission products and other impurities (e.g. oxygen) low enough. Especially the concentrations of some of the rare earth elements need to be kept low, as they have a large cross section for neutron capture.|$|E
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> study {{performance}} of analytical processing queries without stream processing. In the experiments {{performance of}} word count and sentiment analysis algorithms was tested.|$|R

50|$|The first dPCR {{paper was}} {{published}} by Dr Alec Morley and Pamela Sykes in 1992. <b>The</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> quantify PCR targets {{in an attempt to}} track and measure the absolute lowest number of leukemic cells in a patient with leukemia. <b>The</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> monitor residual disease in leukemia patients, and thereby treat the patients at the earliest possible moment of detection of disease recurrence. Further evolutions of the technology allowed for more widespread distribution of this technique, with small partitions created by emulsion droplets and/or microfluidics.|$|R
25|$|Despite these varying viewpoints, the Swedish-speaking {{population}} in Finland in general {{have their own}} identity distinct {{from that of the}} majority, and they wish to be recognized as such. In speaking Swedish, Swedish-speaking Finns predominantly use the Swedish word finländare (approximately translatable as Finlanders) when referring to all Finnish nationals. <b>The</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> use a term that includes both themselves and Finnish-speaking Finns because the Swedish word finnar, in Finland-Swedish usage, implies a Finnish-speaking Finn. In Sweden, this distinction between finländare and finnar is not widely understood and often not made.|$|E

Before a magician can join one of these clubs, they usually have to audition. <b>The</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> show to the membership they are a magician and not just someone off the street wanting to discover magic secrets.|$|E
25|$|In {{electric}} power distribution, capacitors {{are used for}} power factor correction. Such capacitors often come as three capacitors connected as a three phase load. Usually, the values of these capacitors are given not in farads {{but rather as a}} reactive power in volt-amperes reactive (var). <b>The</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> counteract inductive loading from devices like electric motors and transmission lines to make the load appear to be mostly resistive. Individual motor or lamp loads may have capacitors for power factor correction, or larger sets of capacitors (usually with automatic switching devices) may be installed at a load center within a building or in a large utility substation.|$|E

25|$|The Tanpopo {{mission is}} an orbital {{astrobiology}} experiment by Japan {{that is currently}} investigating the possible interplanetary transfer of life, organic compounds, and possible terrestrial particles in low Earth orbit. The Tanpopo experiment is taking place at the Exposed Facility located on the exterior of Kibo module of the International Space Station. The mission will collect cosmic dusts and other particles for three years by using an ultra-low density silica gel called aerogel. <b>The</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> assess the panspermia hypothesis {{and the possibility of}} natural interplanetary transport of life and its precursors. Some of these aerogels will be replaced every one or two years through 2018. Sample collection began in May 2015, and the first samples will be returned to Earth in mid-2016.|$|E
25|$|Sledging is a {{term used}} in cricket to {{describe}} the practice whereby some players seek to gain an advantage by insulting or verbally intimidating the opposing player. <b>The</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> try to weaken the opponent's concentration, thereby causing him/her to make mistakes or underperform. It can be effective because the batsman stands within hearing range of the bowler and certain close fielders; and vice versa. The insults may be direct or feature in conversations among fielders designed to be overheard. The term has also been used in other sports, as when the tennis player Nick Kyrgios insulted his opponent, Stan Wawrinka, by referring to a purported encounter between another player and the latter's girlfriend.|$|E

30|$|Before {{analyzing}} the stories, a clear differentiation had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> made {{between what is}} considered an environmental innovation and what is considered a social innovation. The delineation was made in accordance to what <b>the</b> primary <b>purpose</b> of <b>the</b> innovation <b>was.</b> If <b>the</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> benefit <b>the</b> environment then it was considered an environmental innovation. If <b>the</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> benefit society or people then it was considered a social innovation. This may seem self-explanatory but {{for a number of}} stories this clear and direct method of discerning the type of innovation was necessary as some cases included both.|$|R
