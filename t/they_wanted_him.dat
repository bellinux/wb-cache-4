By this point, Davis held every record for a jet pilot, {{including}} most victories in all types of aircraft, most MiGs destroyed and most victories over propeller-driven aircraft. Other pilots indicated <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> to stay in Korea, considering him to be an able and effective leader. However, the Air Force determined it had no capable replacement who could command Davis' squadron.|$|E
5|$|Pearse {{found that}} there was no {{possibility}} of improvement but that Michael Schiavo's decisions might have been influenced by the potential to inherit what remained of Terri Schiavo's estate as long as he remained married to her. Due to a lack of a living will and questions regarding Michael's credibility, Pearse recommended denying his petition to remove her feeding tube. Pearse reported that the issue of conflict of interest applied to the Schindlers as well since, had Michael divorced Terri as <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> to, they would have inherited the remainder of Mrs. Schiavo's estate upon her death.|$|E
5|$|The {{critical}} and commercial {{success of the}} film of David Copperfield led to an invitation to return to Hollywood in 1936. When he got there {{he found that the}} studio executives had no idea which films <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> to work on, and he had eight weeks of highly paid leisure, during which he wrote a short story and worked on a novel. He was eventually asked to write the scenario for Little Lord Fauntleroy, which he enjoyed doing. He spent most of his fees on paintings, forgetting to keep enough money to pay US tax on his earnings. He replenished his American funds with a lecture tour – his last – in late 1936.|$|E

5000|$|The novel ends on a {{somewhat}} elaborate joke. The Judean slaves attempt to send Falco {{on a quest}} to recover a missing artifact. At first, Falco is afraid that <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>him</b> to raid the treasures brought back after the conquest. However, they then tell Falco that <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>him</b> {{to look for a}} [...] "Lost Ark". Falco demurs, and says someone who is more of a daredevil than he would have to perform that particular quest, alluding to Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark.|$|R

5|$|The {{film was}} {{announced}} in October 2003 by producer Subhash Ghai, to commemorate the 25th anniversary of his production company Mukta Arts. The media reported that Akshay Kumar, Kareena Kapoor and Priyanka Chopra were cast in lead roles, making it the third film collaboration between Kumar and Chopra after the highly successful Andaaz (2003) and Mujhse Shaadi Karogi (2004). Kumar was cast as Raj, a working man accused of rape at his workplace; Kapoor portrayed his supportive wife, who goes to extremes to defend him. According to the directors, Kumar was cast against type; he generally played action heros, and <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> to underplay his character. Abbas–Mustan, known for stylish thrillers and intriguing antagonists, cast Chopra in her first negative role. She plays a woman, married to a business magnate more than twice her age (played by Amrish Puri), who falsely accuses her ex-lover (Kumar) of raping her to seek revenge. Chopra was initially apprehensive about such a bold character, due to the controversial theme of sexual harassment, but Abbas–Mastan and Subhash Ghai convinced her to accept the role. The director duo had previously offered her the lead role in their 2002 thriller Humraaz, which she could not do.|$|E

In 1996, Malik attended trials for the U-15 World Cup. He was selected in the squad for his bowling.|$|E

25|$|However, Krause {{also made}} many picks {{that did not}} help the team. In 1986, Krause planned on {{selecting}} a tall forward named Brad Sellers in the NBA Draft. Sellers, Krause reasoned, was too good a pick to pass up, as he handled the ball very well for a big man, and also had a solid outside jumper. Jordan, on the other hand, pushed management to take a two-way guard from Duke named Johnny Dawkins. It looked as though Krause would take Dawkins even {{as late as the}} morning of the draft; the coaches and players had made it clear that <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> and not Sellers, and Krause did not particularly have a problem with Dawkins' game. The Bulls' head coach at the time, Doug Collins, even told Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski the night before the draft that the team would pick Dawkins. However, Krause ignored everyone and picked Sellers anyway, and spent the summer trying to sell him to Jordan. Jordan went after Sellers mercilessly in practice, and Sellers was traded after three seasons. He played six total seasons in the NBA, averaging 6.3 points per game. Dawkins played for nine seasons in the NBA and averaged 11.1 points per game, though he did suffer from various injuries throughout his career.|$|E

500|$|Grace Lee Whitney was {{released}} {{during the filming}} of the first season. The official reason given for Whitney's departure from the show was that her character limited romantic possibilities for Captain Kirk. This idea was supported by Whitney, saying [...] "They didn't {{want to give the}} fans the idea [...] was in love with Janice Rand. That would limit him. <b>They</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> to go out and fool around. So, I was axed." ...|$|E

In the summer of 2009, between his sophomore and junior years, deGrom received an invitation to play collegiate summer baseball for the DeLand Suns of the Florida Collegiate Summer League, which he declined after discovering that <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> to play as a pitcher.|$|E

500|$|Eric Johnson {{auditioned for}} {{the roles of}} Lex and Clark, before finally being cast as Whitney Fordman. When the {{producers}} called him in for a third audition, Johnson informed them that if <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> then they would bring him in for a screen-test. After the screen-test, Johnson was cast and spent only one day filming his scenes for the pilot. The producers, along with Johnson, wanted to portray Whitney as {{more than just the}} [...] "stereotypical jock" [...] that he could have easily become, {{in an effort to make}} sure Lana did not look stupid for going out with him. Whitney was given multiple storylines in season one in an effort to get audiences to view the character in a more pleasant light, but Kristin Kreuk feels that it was all for naught, as the audience only sees him through Clark's eyes.|$|E
