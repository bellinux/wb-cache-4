5|$|The 20 {{amino acids}} that are encoded {{directly}} by the codons of the universal genetic code are called standard or canonical amino acids. A modified form of methionine (N-formylmethionine) is often incorporated in place of methionine as the initial amino acid of proteins in bacteria, mitochondria and chloroplasts. Other amino acids are called non-standard or non-canonical. Most of the non-standard amino acids are also non-proteinogenic (i.e. they cannot be incorporated into proteins during translation), but {{two of them are}} proteinogenic, as they can be incorporated <b>translationally</b> into proteins by exploiting information not encoded in the universal genetic code.|$|E
25|$|Firstly, a metric space must be <b>translationally</b> {{invariant}} {{with respect}} to some (finite-dimensional) real vector space. This means that the space itself is an affine space, that the space is flat, not curved, and points do not have different properties, and so any point can be translated to any other point.|$|E
25|$|Iron export {{occurs in}} a variety of cell types, {{including}} neurons, erythrocytes, macrophages and enterocytes. The latter two are especially important since systemic iron levels depend upon them. There is only one known iron exporter, ferroportin. It transports ferrous iron out of the cell, generally aided by ceruloplasmin and/or hephaestin (mostly in enterocytes), which oxidize iron to its ferric state so it can bind ferritin in the extracellular medium. Hepcidin causes the internalization of ferroportin, decreasing iron export. Besides, hepcidin seems to downregulate both TFR1 and DMT1 through an unknown mechanism. Another player assisting ferroportin in effecting cellular iron export is GAPDH. A specific post <b>translationally</b> modified isoform of GAPDH is recruited to the surface of iron loaded cells where it recruits apo-transferrin in close proximity to ferroportin so as to rapidly chelate the iron extruded.|$|E
25|$|The {{substrate}} {{on which}} the film deposition takes place is ultrasonically cleaned and fastened to the substrate holder. The substrate holder {{is attached to the}} manipulator shaft. The manipulator shaft moves <b>translationally</b> to adjust the distance between the ingot source and the substrate. The shaft also rotates the substrate at a particular speed so that the film is uniformly deposited on the substrate. A negative bias DC voltage of 200–400 V {{can be applied to the}} substrate. Often, focused high-energy electrons from one of the electron guns or infrared light from heater lamps is used to preheat the substrate. Heating of the substrate allows increased adatom–substrate and adatom–film diffusion by giving the adatoms sufficient energy to overcome kinetic barriers. If a rough film, such as metallic nanorods, is desired substrate cooling with water or liquid nitrogen may be employed to reduce diffusion lifetime, positively bolstering surface kinetic barriers. To further enhance film roughness, the substrate may be mounted at a steep angle with respect to the flux to achieve geometric shadowing, where incoming line of sight flux lands onto only higher parts of the developing film. This method is known as glancing-angle deposition (GLAD) or oblique-angle deposition (OAD).|$|E

2500|$|The biosynthetic genes {{responsible}} for rapamycin synthesis have been identified. As expected, three extremely large open reading frames (ORF's) designated as rapA, rapB, and rapC encode for three extremely large and complex multienzymes, RapA, RapB, and RapC, respectively. The gene rapL {{has been established}} to code for a NAD+-dependent lysine cycloamidase, which converts L-lysine to L-pipecolic acid (figure 4) for incorporation {{at the end of}} the polyketide. [...] The gene rapP, which is embedded between the PKS genes and <b>translationally</b> coupled to rapC, encodes for an additional enzyme, an NPRS {{responsible for}} incorporating L-pipecolic acid, chain termination and cyclization of prerapamycin. In addition, genes rapI, rapJ, rapM, rapN, rapO, and rapQ have been identified as coding for tailoring enzymes that modify the macrocyclic core to give rapamycin (figure 3). Finally, rapG and rapH have been identified to code for enzymes that have a positive regulatory role in the preparation of rapamycin through the control of rapamycin PKS gene expression.|$|E

The Mammalian <b>translationally</b> controlled tumour protein (TCTP) (or P23) is a protein which {{has been found to be}} preferentially synthesised in cells during the early growth phase of some types of tumour, but which is also expressed in normal cells.

In addition, TCTP has been shown to bind to tubulin in the cytoskeleton, has a high affinity for calcium, is the binding target for the antimalarial compound artemisinin, and is induced in vitamin D-dependent apoptosis. TCTP production is thought to be controlled at the translational as well as the transcriptional level.|$|E
