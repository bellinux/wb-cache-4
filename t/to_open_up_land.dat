25|$|It {{took many}} years to build a {{complete}} line to serve the Northland Region, with different sections being developed at different times. Eventually {{it became clear that}} a main line was required to link these isolated railways to improve transport for both passengers and freight to and from New Zealand's northernmost region, and <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>up</b> <b>land</b> for greater economic development. However, the construction was not without criticism. In 1910, the Minister of Railways himself criticised the project, arguing that the project of extending it would bring little benefit, as most traffic from north of Auckland was already covered by only going as far as Helensville, while country to the north was poor and {{would not be able to}} support the line.|$|E
500|$|Aside from coal, Barry {{exported}} {{timber and}} small quantities of pig iron, wood, pulp, silver sand, zinc and iron ore. A timber business {{was started in}} the town in 1888 by J.C. Meggitt of Wolverhampton, and in the 1890s gypsum, railway sleepers, flints and rice began to be exported. [...] The Barry Company made a considerable effort to attract firms to the dock area, but with limited success. Although J. Arthur Rank, a milling company which produced flour and animal stuffs, was established in 1906 on the dockside, {{an attempt by the}} Barry Company in 1910 and 1911 to make an agreement with Lord Ashby St. Ledger <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>up</b> <b>land</b> on the eastern dock area towards Sully to host steel manufacturers from the Midlands proved fruitless.|$|E
2500|$|The {{line was}} {{intended}} <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>up</b> <b>land</b> {{to the west}} of Lumsden and perhaps even reach Manapouri or Te Anau in Fiordland. Construction began in July 1879 and the line left the Kingston Branch just outside the north side of Lumsden at a location named Mararoa Junction that was simply a set of points. The only real obstacle was the Oreti River, which was crossed by the end of March 1880, though an 1880 Royal Commission into New Zealand's railways was so unimpressed by the line's prospects that it declared [...] "the railway bridge over the Oreti should be decked over and thrown open for dray traffic." [...] Nonetheless, construction progressed onwards towards Mossburn, albeit slowly due to the effects of the Long Depression of the 1880s. The first three kilometres opened to Castle Rock on 1 April 1881, but almost five years passed before the next section, six and a half kilometres to Murray Creek, was opened on 13 March 1886. The final six and a half kilometres were built much quicker and the line was opened all the way to Mossburn on 21 January 1887. No proposals to continue construction westwards ever had a serious chance of being realised.|$|E

MayoBallina Orbital Route ProjectThe {{objective}} of the Ballina Orbital Route Project is to provide an orbital link around the town connecting all existing and future National Primary and National Secondary Roads, all existing Regional Roads and all existing Local Roads radiating from the town. The consequent benefit will be a reduction in traffic congestion due to traffic having the opportunity of avoiding the town centre. It will also serve <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>up</b> <b>lands</b> {{on the periphery of}} Ballina for future development.Project webpage ...|$|R
5000|$|The first westward migrations {{occurred}} {{as representatives of}} the Thirteen Colonies sought <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>up</b> new <b>lands</b> for their respective colonies westward. Those whose original royal charters did not specify a western limit simply extended their lands directly and indefinitely westward.|$|R
50|$|The Kurow Branch (also {{known as}} the Hakataramea Branch) was part of New Zealand's {{national}} rail network. In the North Otago region of the South Island, {{it was built in}} the 1870s <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>up</b> the <b>land</b> behind Oamaru for development, and closed in 1983.|$|R
5000|$|The {{government}} expected {{these lines}} to not recover {{the cost in}} the short term, but <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>up</b> <b>land</b> for farming wheat to [...] "strengthen the backbone of South Australia".

5000|$|Opposing {{them were}} {{a group of}} parliamentarians {{representing}} mainly white, British constituencies in the Eastern Cape near the frontier. Close to the neighbouring Xhosa lands, these politicians represented their constituents' fears of the more numerous Xhosa. They tended to support more direct British imperial rule, stronger policies regarding border defence and imperial expansion into Africa <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>up</b> <b>lands</b> for white settlement. They resented the political dominance of the more [...] "liberal" [...] Westerners and saw the solution to be a separate white [...] "Eastern Cape Colony" [...] under direct British rule, with Port Elizabeth as its capital. For much of this time they were led by the representative of Port Elizabeth, John Paterson. They were known as the [...] "Easterners" [...] or the [...] "Separatist League".|$|R
50|$|In 1978 the {{community}} was without a canteen {{and most of the}} locals wanted it to stay that way but the Queensland government pushed for one. It coincided with the imposition of a local council <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>up</b> the <b>land</b> <b>to</b> mining hitherto opposed by {{the community}}. When social problems ensued the government used it as justification for intervention.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} nineteenth century, white Australians began <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>up</b> Arnhem <b>Land</b> for cattle grazing. A series of battles between Yolŋu and Balanda {{occurred}} at this time. Yolngu were arguably more warrior-like than other Indigenous Australians because they had had to defend their northern shoreline for many hundreds - if not thousands - of years.|$|R

50|$|Crystal Beach Amusement Park {{occupied}} waterfront land within Crystal Beach from 1888 {{until the}} park's closure in 1989. The property {{was once a}} health spa whose buildings were sited near and on a natural sand dune fifty feet high and 1,200 feet long parallel to the shore. Part of the dune was excavated <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>up</b> <b>land</b> for the spa.

5000|$|It has {{indirectly}} {{caused a}} great deal of deforestation in Brazil - where there are roads it is easier to transport timber. Satellite images demonstrate how roads increase deforestation. Access roads branch perpendicularly off BR-230 allowing deeper penetration into the surrounding jungle areas. Originally these roads were <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>up</b> <b>land</b> for agriculture by settlers, the government motto [...] "land without men for men without land" [...] was coined to describe the development of the Amazon. However, loggers have used these roadways to further deforest the surrounding jungle.|$|E
50|$|In 1885, {{with the}} Mackay Railway {{terminating}} at Mirani, {{the town was}} the limit of closer settlement. Throughout the 1890s the government received requests for the Pioneer Valley line to be extended <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>up</b> more <b>land</b> for cane, particularly the extensive area of land that lay between Mirani and the Eungella Ranges. The Pioneer River however, was a significant barrier.|$|R

50|$|Tividale {{moved to}} their current ground in Packwood Road in 1974, {{renaming}} it The Beeches. This name {{was chosen to}} honour a British Waterways official who had granted the site's lease to the club. The new ground was situated in a newly developed residential street on the Tividale Hall Estate on land which had previously been inaccessible to motor vehicles and which had required the demolition of four houses in order <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>up</b> the <b>land</b> for development.|$|R
50|$|A new cleaner firelog has {{now been}} {{developed}} using waste fibre from the oil palm fruit bunches of South East Asia. Unlike sawdust logs these burn with zero sulfur emissions. Also unlike sawdust logs, no trees need to be felled to produce these firelogs. While it is beneficial that the oil palm derived logs use waste fibre, the overall impact of palm oil plantations is problematic because vast areas of virgin tropical rain forest in Borneo and Sumatra are being clear cut <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>up</b> <b>land</b> for palm plantations. This activity directly threatens habitats of endangered species such as the orangutan.|$|E
50|$|When the British came, {{new laws}} {{about the ways}} <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>up</b> <b>land</b> were introduced. One of them {{involves}} paying a tax to the government before using it. This new law {{makes it difficult for}} everyone, especially poor farmers. To make things worse, the permission letters and passes from the government for opening up lands were also introduced. Despite the laws being introduced by the British, Haji Abdul Rahman Limbong fought to protect the livelihood and means of survival of farmers, claiming that land only belongs to Allah, and eventually to those who work on them.|$|E
5000|$|A week later, as {{predicted}} by Forest and Bird, the Government released the [...] "Schedule 4 stocktake" [...] proposal {{to open up}} 7058 hectares of protected conservation land for mining. Parts of the Coromandel Peninsula, Great Barrier Island, and parts of Paparoa National Park were proposed for removal from Schedule Four of the Crown Minerals Act 1991, which otherwise prevents mining. Journalist John Armstrong commented that [...] "Forest and Bird knocked the Government sideways with leaked information revealing the extent of National's plans <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>up</b> <b>land</b> currently off limits to mining companies" [...] and that the Government was suffering from hysteria if any one was.|$|E
50|$|Under the Discharged soldiers’ {{settlement}} Act, 1917 {{and associated}} legislation and regulations, every discharged {{member of the}} armed forces was entitled to apply for land and financial assistance. The important goals within this initiative were <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>up</b> new <b>land</b> for settlement as well as place willing and suitable settlers on this land. At the same time, it aimed to provide employment as well as the necessary support for the many discharged servicemen who had served their country.|$|R
50|$|Following the 1868 Crown Lands Alienation Act, {{the earlier}} {{pastoral}} {{runs on the}} Maroochy River were divided for closer settlement for agriculture. In November 1873, James Campbell applied for selection of approximately 180 acres of second class pastoral land surrounding Dunethin Rock. Campbell's application was cancelled because the government had decided not <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>up</b> the <b>land,</b> surveyed as Portion 28 Parish of Maroochy, for selection. However, some sections of this land parcel were excised for selection from the mid 1870s until 1900.|$|R

Selectors began to farm the fertile areas further west of Mirani within the vicinity of McGregor's Creek; however the unbridged Pioneer River was an impediment to further expansion.|$|R
5000|$|In order <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>up</b> <b>land</b> in the Coos Bay {{area for}} homesteading {{in the early}} 1860s, the U.S. Army {{forcibly}} marched the Coos and Lower Umpqua Indians 80 mi north over rugged terrain to the Alsea Sub-Agency reservation in Yachats where the peaceful Indians, treated by the Army {{as though they were}} prisoners of war, were incarcerated. [...] Amanda's Trail, named for a blind Indian woman who suffered greatly on the march, was dedicated on July 19, 2009. [...] The trail climbs 800 ft from downtown Yachats to the summit of Cape Perpetua where it links with the extensive trail system of the Siuslaw National Forest.|$|E

50|$|Seafield School was {{a school}} for boys aged between 8 and 13. It was located on Collington Lane West, one of three schools on the lane the others being Falconbury, also a boys' school and Effingham, for girls. These three schools were visited by Queen Elizabeth II in the 1960s. Seafield itself was used as {{quarters}} for a Canadian Anti Aircraft Battery that was serving in defence of Bexhill and Cooden Beach during the Second World War. Seafield and its two counterparts were closed in the early 1970s <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>up</b> <b>land</b> {{to be used for}} building new homes. However, their crests were preserved in a specially dedicated stained-glass window in the nearby St Mark's church of the parish of Bexhill. The installation and dedication of the Seafield School memorial window happened in June 1963 and was dedicated to Henry Granville Coghlan, the founder of the school, and his wife Amy and son Patrick.|$|E
50|$|Kampong Amber existed {{as early}} as the 20th century. It was a Malay fishing village (kampong) that used to exist in the area between East Coast Road and Amber Road. It was located right before the coastal area of Katong. The {{inhabitants}} were mainly Peranakans and Malay fishermen. Like any kampongs in Singapore, a kampong is normally named after the main road it is adjacent to, hence this was how Kampong Amber’s name came to be. Amber road was named after the family clan name of Joseph Aaron Elias, a prominent property owner in early-20th-century Singapore. During the industrialisation phase of Singapore in the 1970s and 1980s, Kampong Amber was not spared when kampongs were eradicated <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>up</b> <b>land</b> for economic developments. Kampong Amber occupants were subsequently relocated to newly built, government subsidised flats. High-rise flats and privatised developments were later constructed at the site. Sir Winston Churchill once famously remarked, “We shape our buildings; thereafter they shape us”. As the architecture and urban landscape (physical environment) morphed and developed drastically over the years, from Kampong Amber to the modern-day Amber road developments - the same level of change could be observed of the social activities it hosts, the occupants it invites and the genius loci of the place.|$|E

5|$|Following European settlement, {{the growth}} of the new colony of New South Wales led to an {{increasing}} demand for arable land. Governor Lachlan Macquarie supported expeditions <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>up</b> new <b>lands</b> <b>to</b> the south of the capital Sydney, including one to find an overland route to Jervis Bay, an area which would later be incorporated into the ACT as its only coastal possession. In 1818 Charles Throsby, Hamilton Hume, James Meehan and William Kearns set out to find the route, a task accomplished that same year by Throsby and Kearns.|$|R
