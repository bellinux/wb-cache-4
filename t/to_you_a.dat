5|$|At 12, Westenra {{entered a}} {{professional}} recording studio to record Walking in the Air, a demo album originally created {{for friends and}} family. At first, her parents paid for 70 copies; soon after, 1,000 more were cut for sale, hand-out, and publicity. After finishing her album, Westenra and her sister Sophie busked in Christchurch, giving away {{a few of the}} original 70 albums (at the behest of passersby) and selling some of the latter 1000. The pair drew large crowds, and one woman asked the girls if they had ever recorded anything. The woman, a journalist with Canterbury Television, asked Westenra to appear on air. Gray Bartlett, the director of a concert promotion company, saw the show and became interested in working with Westenra. Shortly after, she was offered a recording deal with Universal Records New Zealand. On that label, Westenra, who in the meantime was attending Burnside High School, released a self-titled album of show tunes and light classical songs, as well as My Gift <b>to</b> <b>You,</b> <b>a</b> CD of Christmas music. Following the success of her albums, she was offered and later received lessons from Dame Malvina Major.|$|E

Burton Folsom Jr. has noted, he sometimes gave {{tens of thousands of}} dollars to Christian groups, while, at the same time, he was trying to borrow over a million dollar to expand his business. His philosophy of giving was founded upon biblical principles. He truly believed in the biblical principle found in Luke 6:38, [...] "Give, and it will be given <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> <b>A</b> good measure, pressed down, shaken together and running over, will be poured into your lap.

500|$|The album {{received}} generally favorable reviews. Pete Johnson in the Los Angeles Times wrote, [...] "Dylan is a superbly eloquent {{writer of}} pop and folk songs with an unmatched ability to press complex ideas and iconoclastic philosophy into brief poetic lines and startling images." [...] The editor of Crawdaddy!, Paul Williams, reviewed Blonde on Blonde in July 1966: [...] "It is {{a cache of}} emotion, a well handled package of excellent music and better poetry, blended and meshed and ready {{to become part of}} your reality. Here is a man who will speak <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> <b>a</b> 1960s bard with electric lyre and color slides, but a truthful man with x-ray eyes you can look through if you want.

500|$|In 1957, Sinatra {{released}} Close <b>to</b> <b>You,</b> <b>A</b> Swingin' Affair! and Where Are You?—his {{first album}} in stereo, with Gordon Jenkins. Granata considers [...] "Close to You" [...] {{to have been}} thematically his closest concept album to perfection during the [...] "golden" [...] era, and Nelson Riddle's finest work, which was [...] "extremely progressive" [...] by the stands of the day. It is structured like a three-act play, each commencing with the songs [...] "With Every Breath I Take", [...] "Blame It On My Youth" [...] and [...] "It Could Happen to You". For Granata, Sinatra's A Swingin' Affair! and swing music predecessor Songs for Swingin' Lovers! solidified [...] "Sinatra's image as a 'swinger', from both a musical and visual standpoint". Buddy Collette considered the swing albums to have been heavily influenced by Sammy Davis, Jr., and noted that when he worked with Sinatra in the mid-1960s he approached a song much differently than he had done in the early 1950s. On June 9, 1957, he performed in a 62-minute concert conducted by Riddle at the Seattle Civic Auditorium, his first appearance in Seattle since 1945. The recording was first released as a bootleg, but in 1999 Artanis Entertainment Group officially released it as the Sinatra '57 in Concert live album, after Sinatra's death. In 1958 Sinatra released the album Come Fly with Me with Billy May. It reached the top spot on the Billboard album chart in its second week, remaining at the top for five weeks, and was nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year at the inaugural Grammy Awards. The title song, [...] "Come Fly With Me", written especially for him, {{would become one of}} his best known standards. On May 29 he recorded seven songs in a single session, more than double the usual yield of a recording session, and an eighth was planned, [...] "Lush Life", but Sinatra found it too technically demanding. In September, Sinatra released Frank Sinatra Sings for Only the Lonely, a stark collection of introspective saloon songs and blues-tinged ballads which proved a huge commercial success, spending 120 weeks on Billboards album chart and peaking at No.1. Cuts from this LP, such as [...] "Angel Eyes" [...] and [...] "One for My Baby (and One More for the Road)", would remain staples of the [...] "saloon song" [...] segments of Sinatra's concerts.|$|E

Quddús's role as the chief of the Letters of the Living was later confirmed by the Báb.|$|E
