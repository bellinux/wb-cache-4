500|$|Marvin Digs, which Bakshi {{conceived}} as a [...] "flower child picture", was not completed {{the way he had}} intended: It [...] "was going to have curse words and sex scenes, and a lot more than that. [...] Of course, they wouldn't let me do that." [...] He described the disappointing result as a [...] "typical 1967 limited-animation theatrical". Animation historian Michael Barrier called the film [...] "an offensively bad picture, the kind <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>people</b> who love animation get up and leave the theater in disgust". Production of Mighty Heroes ended when Bakshi left Terrytoons.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{examines}} the factors <b>that</b> <b>make</b> <b>people</b> used {{the street in}} Kuala Lumpur city centre. The study employed a mix-methodology method. The {{results suggest that the}} needs of users on the street depend on various factors, such as attractions; activities and reasons for using the streets; proximity, lack of congestion; and familiarity and length of engagement with the place public space, greenery, public amenities, maintenance and freedom of action. The findings show that, in general, the factors <b>that</b> <b>make</b> <b>people</b> use the street are mostly similar with previous theories. However, the attributes that contribute to the factors vary for each context...|$|R
500|$|... "Quinto Piso" [...] {{has been}} {{categorized}} as an analytic song—a prologue to the album holding autobiographical tendencies. [...] "Sin Ti... Sin Mi" [...] is about missing {{someone who has}} left, with analogical lyrics talking about absence of one's beloved person. [...] "El Del Espejo" [...] includes lyrics influenced by [...] "self-criticism" [...] <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>people</b> confront themselves, crafted inside a [...] "rhythmic sound". Lead single [...] "Como Duele" [...] was highly praised. Jason Birchmeier from Allmusic named it Arjona's [...] "biggest hit in years", {{as well as a}} standout track of the album alongside [...] "Sin Ti.. Sin Mi" [...] and [...] "El Del Espejo". El Mercurio Online stated that [...] "Como Duele" [...] is [...] "a ballad of merciless chords and lyrics plagued of contradictions made metaphors." [...] It was also compared to his past song [...] "Olvidarte", from Sin Daños a Terceros.|$|E
500|$|Professional wrestler Bret Hart guest {{starred in}} the episode as himself, {{and he was very}} insistent that he be shown wearing his pink wrestling outfit. He {{explained}} that [...] "It's so cool {{to be part of a}} show <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>people</b> laugh really, really hard." [...] The media, aware that the animated Hart would want to purchase Mr. Burns' home, mistakenly anticipated that [...] "Bret offers to wrestle him [...] for the place." [...] In a 2009 interview with the A.V. Club's Dave Hofer, Hart explained that the reason why his animated counterpart sounds nothing like him was that initially, he was brought in to voice a generic wrestler. When Mark Kirkland realised how famous Hart actually was, he told Hart that if the artwork had not been started yet, he would be drawn in as himself. Later, Hart moved on to do voice work on the animated television series Jacob Two-Two. The press noted that at that time Hart was [...] "no stranger to cartoon-land," [...] having been [...] "immortalized" [...] by [...] "The Old Man and the Lisa".|$|E
500|$|Feeley {{explains}} that Romantic poet John Keats's [...] "vision of enchantment and devastation following upon any dealings with faeries" [...] informs the novel, as the passing {{reference to the}} [...] "cold hillside" [...] makes clear. The magic in Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell {{has been described as}} [...] "wintry and sinister" [...] and [...] "a melancholy, macabre thing". There are [...] "flocks of black birds, a forest that grows up in the canals of Venice, a countryside of bleak moors that can only be entered through mirrors, a phantom bell <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>people</b> think of everything they have ever lost, a midnight darkness that follows an accursed man everywhere he goes". The setting reflects this tone, as [...] "dark, fog, mist and wet give the book much of its creepy, northern atmosphere." [...] According to Nisi Shawl in her review for The Seattle Times, the illustrations reinforce this tenor: [...] "Shadows fill the illustrations by Portia Rosenberg, as apt as Edward Gorey's for Dickens' 'Bleak House'." [...] Author John Clute disagrees, arguing that they are [...] "astonishingly inappropriate" [...] to the tone of the novel. Noting that Clarke refers to important nineteenth-century illustrators George Cruikshank and Thomas Rowlandson, whose works are [...] "line-dominated, intricate, scabrous, cartoon-like, savage and funny", he is disappointed with the [...] "soft and wooden" [...] illustrations provided by Rosenberg.|$|E

2500|$|Vilsack's was {{critical}} of President Bush's execution {{of the war in}} Iraq, but he hesitated to call for an immediate and complete pullout of U.S. forces: [...] "I don't think we're losing in Iraq. It appears to be a draw. People are upset by the fact that their kids are over there and there doesn't seem to be any end to this whole process. It's not pacifism <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>people</b> think this way. They're questioning the credibility and competence of the Commander-in-Chief." ...|$|E

2500|$|John Horgan, Chris Mooney, and {{researchers}} from the US and Canada have described Scientific Certainty Argumentation Methods (SCAMs), where an organization or think tank makes it their only goal to cast doubt on supported science because it conflicts with political agendas. Hank Campbell and microbiologist Alex Berezow have described [...] "feel-good fallacies" [...] used in politics, especially on the left, where politicians frame their positions in a way <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>people</b> feel good about supporting certain policies even when scientific evidence shows {{there is no need}} to worry or there is no need for dramatic change on current programs.|$|E

2500|$|Francis fears some clerics [...] "become {{wolves and}} not shepherds; ... careerism {{and the search}} for a {{promotion}} [...] come under the category of spiritual worldliness", deceitfully trying to appear holy. Francis became known for his snarky remarks. He said of clerical vanity: [...] "Look at the peacock; it's beautiful {{if you look at it}} from the front. But if you look at it from behind, you discover the truth. ...Whoever gives in to such self-absorbed vanity has huge misery hiding inside them". He admonished 138 newly-appointed bishops not to surround themselves with [...] "courtiers, climbers, and yes-men" [...] but to bring people the Gospel <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>people</b> free.|$|E
2500|$|The film's release sparked [...] {{controversy}} in some countries, including Britain, Australia and the United States, {{as to whether}} or not it promoted and romanticized drug use. US Senator Bob Dole accused it of moral depravity and glorifying drug use during the 1996 US presidential campaign, although he later admitted that he had not seen the film. Producer of the film Andrew Macdonald responded to these claims in a BBC interview stating [...] "we were determined to show why people took drugs ... you had to show that it was fun and that it was awful" [...] to which Boyle adds [...] "It's the music and humour <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>people</b> feel it's glamorising drugs.", (Accessed 16 February 2016). Despite the controversy, it was widely praised and received a nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay in that year's Academy Awards. Time magazine ranked Trainspotting as the third best film of 1996.|$|E

[...] The report stated that a subtle message of the film was director Alexander's critique of Scientology and his motivation to bring information about it to the public. [...] In an interview with Tampa Bay's 10, Alexander stated he was trying to expose a hoax, and give others insight into [...] "what it is <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>people</b> join cults." [...] Fox 13 News called the film's portrayal of the Church of Scientific Spirituality as [...] "oddly similar to the real world's Church of Scientology," [...] while reporting that Alexander asserted character L. Conrad Powers was actually a composite character, based on several [...] "alleged cult leaders." [...] Alexander stated in an interview with FOX 13 News, that he felt he could better inform others about cults through a fictional portrayal than he could have through a documentary.|$|E
