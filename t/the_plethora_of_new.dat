They will require the ability to restrict access to some class of protected information by the user position meaning, provided by some GNSS technology. Access control tokens using trusted GNSS receivers will provide the information security core for this kind of applications, including banking, enterprise and secure timestamps. In this paper a Time-Frequency (TF) signal validation algorithm is proposed as valuable tool both to define metrics to quantify the trustworthiness of the navigation signal and to provide countermeasure to the receiver functionalities. This algorithm can work as a subfunction of a signal conditioning stage placed between the Analog-to- Digital Converter and the acquisition block in an innovative secure GNSS receiver. The proposed method is based on a synthesis technique using the so called Orthogonal-Like Gabor Expansion in order to obtain an estimation of the interference to be subtracted to the input signal.

Quantum Electron. vol. 28, 2736 (1992) ]. Historic analyses of the two-colour optical propagation problem have routinely adopted models of the nonlinear-Schrödinger class that are inherently bound by the slowly-varying envelope approximation (SVEA) [De La Fuente & Barthelemy, Opt. Commun. vol. 88, 419 (1992) ]. While desirable in some respects (e. g., by considerable simplification of the governing equations), the SVEA can place some strong physical constraints on the validity of predictions made by Schrödinger-type systems in context of wave optics and the theory of nonlinear beams. Our approach avoids such limitations by dealing with the more general (i. e., un-approximated) Helmholtz-type governing equations. In this presentation, we will deliver a concise overview of our investigations into a model of two-colour light beams beyond <b>the</b> SVEA.

40|$|Globalization and the {{technological}} and economic advances that have accompanied {{it have been}} marked {{by a number of}} tendencies with mixed implications for the media. This paper examines the impact of these changes on the role played by the media in the democratization of societies. Privatization and liberalization carried the promise of more channels, but this has not resulted in a broader and more pluralistic media. The breakdown of state monopolies on broadcasting has had a positive impact in many developing countries, but in many others the state monopolies have merely been replaced by private ones with equally suspect aims. The decline of public broadcasting is a major concern even in the developed countries of Europe. Alternative or community media hold out great promise but are chronically under-resourced and otherwise marginalized. Consolidation of ownership and control, and the rise of massive global multimedia conglomerates with influence over practically all aspects of cultural and political life is another area of concern for its restrictive influence on pluralism and local content. Given these characteristics of the global media environment in the information society, the paper focuses on issues of media governance and regulation, including: the effects of growing concentration of commercial media ownership; the place of mainstream public media; how to foster and promote independent, alternative media initiatives; how to promote freedom of expression and communication through the media; and <b>the</b> <b>plethora</b> <b>of</b> issues surrounding <b>new</b> technologies and new communication platforms such as the Internet.
