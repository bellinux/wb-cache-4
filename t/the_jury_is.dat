Still, Zinc's former colleagues of Rogan Rothberg express their grudging respect for his spirited cross-examination, and even help Zinc get even with an obnoxious blogger who had been ceaselessly maligning Zinc and Zinc's wife. Moreover, Karros keeps her promise and agrees to drop all the frivolous lawsuit and legal malpractice proceedings against Finley & Figg. Varrick has no special grudge against this small firm, though they intend to settle accounts with their old foe Alisandros and extract from him big sums on a frivolous lawsuit.|$|E

5000|$|It {{is clear}} that Lord Steyn {{intended}} that a virtual or moral certainty test should necessarily lead to a finding of intention. But by phrasing the guidelines {{in terms of what}} <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>are</b> not entitled to do, the clarity of the direction is compromised. He may have felt that <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>are</b> entitled to indirectly infer but not directly find intention. It would have been better expressed as a positive; i.e. [...] "if <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>are</b> sure that <b>the</b> defendant foresaw death or grievous bodily harm as a virtual certainty this equals intention". Nevertheless, it seems that [...] "a result foreseen as virtually certain is an intended result",It is not clear that Lord Steyn intended the above meaning. Parliament required that <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> not <b>be</b> directed to find intention, and Lord Steyn cannot have intended to contravene Parliament's wishes. Where <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>are</b> sure that <b>the</b> defendant foresaw the required level of harm to be a virtual certainty this <b>is</b> evidence which <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> may consider in consideration of whether the defendant personally intended this harm.|$|R

The paper is undated; that he wrote it while in Vienna in 1689 was determined only in 1999, when the ongoing critical edition finally published Leibniz's philosophical writings for the period 1677–90. Couturat's reading {{of this paper was}} the launching point for much 20th-century thinking about Leibniz, especially among analytic philosophers. But after a meticulous study of all of Leibniz's philosophical writings up to 1688—a study the 1999 additions to the critical edition made possible—Mercer (2001) begged to differ with Couturat's reading; <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>is</b> still out.|$|E

500|$|... "Whosoever shall unlawfully and maliciously by {{any means}} {{whatsoever}} wound or cause any grievous bodily harm to any person... with intent... to do some... grievous bodily harm to any person, or with intent to resist or prevent the lawful apprehension or detainer of any person...". This creates four forms of the offence: unlawfully and maliciously wounding, with intent to either do grievous bodily harm (1) or resist arrest (2); and unlawfully and maliciously causing grievous bodily harm, with intent to either do grievous bodily harm (3) or resist arrest (4). Thus forms (1) and (3) differ from section 20 offences mainly in {{that there is a}} specific intention to cause serious harm rather than some harm, and they are therefore the more serious charges. On an indictment under section 18, <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>is</b> open to convict under section 20 or section 47 if properly directed.|$|E
500|$|It {{was this}} concept which {{intrigued}} Madonna, {{while she was}} developing her third studio album True Blue (1986). She said, [...] "I hate it when people do master mixes of my records. I don't want to hear my songs changed like that. I don't know that I like it, people screwing with my records. <b>The</b> <b>jury</b> <b>is</b> out on it for me. But the fans like it, and really, this one was for the fans, for {{the kids in the}} clubs who wanted to hear these songs in a fresh new way." [...] She went to Warner with the idea of releasing her songs by remixing them in a complete dance tune. From Warner's point of view, the rise of remix was a commercial boon, because it meant making more money out of the same piece of music. Instead of paying Madonna to go to studio and record different tracks, they found that allowing her to record the same tracks in different formats was much less costly. Hence they decided to release the album, but gave full freedom to Madonna to choose the producers with whom she wanted to develop the remixes.|$|E
500|$|Core intent {{would be}} where the {{defendant}} acted either to cause at least grievous bodily harm to the victim, or where the defendant acted to achieve some other aim, where the death caused was a necessary means to that other end. In general, <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>is</b> directed that [...] "intent" [...] is to be taken as meaning what it does in ordinary life, and that the judge should not attempt to define it in other terms. However, following R v Woollin, {{it is also possible}} for a jury to convict if they [...] "feel sure that death or serious injury was a virtual certainty (barring some unforeseen intervention) {{as a result of the}} defendant's actions and that the defendant appreciated that such was the case" [...] known as [...] "oblique intent". Despite appearing to present an alternative to the primary, core sense of intent, courts have generally seen Woollin as allowing the jury to infer core intent from the evidence of virtual certainty. The jury are entitled to convict in these circumstances, and they should not be directed that they, finding virtual certainty, must convict. However, if it is difficult to imagine circumstances where a jury would find virtual certainty but not convict, which would support this complicating factor. The exception for medical care is mentioned as a general principle for homicide.|$|E
