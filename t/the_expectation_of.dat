5|$|After her graduation, Simone {{spent the}} summer of 1950 at the Juilliard School, as a student of Carl Friedberg, {{preparing}} for an audition at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia. Her application, however, was denied. As her family had relocated to Philadelphia in <b>the</b> <b>expectation</b> <b>of</b> her entry to Curtis, the blow to her aspirations was particularly heavy, and she suspected that her application had been denied because of racial prejudice. Discouraged, she took private piano lessons with Vladimir Sokoloff, a professor at Curtis, but never re-applied to the institution. She {{took a job as}} a photographer's assistant, but also found work as an accompanist at Arlene Smith's vocal studio and taught piano from her home in Philadelphia.|$|E
5|$|All-weather {{lifeboats}} (ALBs) {{are large}} boats with enclosed wheelhouses and survivor spaces below deck, which are self-righting and {{can go out}} in all weather conditions. Some ALBs carry an inflatable Y-class lifeboat or Y-boat for inshore work, launched by mechanical arm. There are six classes of ALB motor life boats, with speeds ranging from 17 to 25 knots. The RNLI's aim {{is to provide a}} 25-knot lifeboat to every all-weather crew, and has begun construction of an All-weather Lifeboat Centre (ALC) in Poole which, when complete, will save £3million a year. The RNLI took over the ALC in 2015 with <b>the</b> <b>expectation</b> <b>of</b> becoming fully operational in 2019, when six Shannon-class lifeboats a year will be built.|$|E
5|$|Hextall {{arrived at}} the Philadelphia Flyers {{training}} camp in 1984 with <b>the</b> <b>expectation</b> <b>of</b> playing in the NHL. However, the Flyers subsequently sent him to their farm team in the International Hockey League (IHL), the Kalamazoo Wings. Although disappointed, Hextall was now playing {{at a higher level}} than at WHL and made his debut in professional hockey. He played 19games for Kalamazoo, recording six wins and a GAA of4.35. During the season, he moved to the Flyers' other farm team; Hershey Bears of the American Hockey League (AHL), where he played 11times, with four wins, and a GAA of3.68.|$|E

5|$|The Portuguese {{assault was}} {{thoroughly}} prepared. The plan was for six Portuguese squadrons under dom João da Silva {{to block the}} entrance to the bridge, isolating the redoubt from Fort San Crisóbal. The fort would in turn be attacked by Alfonso Futrado and Simon Correa da Silva. Maestre de Campo dom Diogo Gomes was given the task of cutting the communication lines along the Guadiana river and Pedro Almado of distracting several minor forts nearby. Some cavalry regiments were deployed in <b>the</b> <b>expectation</b> <b>of</b> a fierce Spanish resistance.|$|E
5|$|Their {{income was}} modest, with George's small per annum living; Cassandra brought <b>the</b> <b>expectation</b> <b>of</b> a small {{inheritance}} {{at the time}} of her mother's death to the marriage. They took up temporary residence at the nearby Deane rectory until Steventon, a 16th century house in disrepair, underwent necessary renovations. Cassandra gave birth to three children while living at Deane: James in 1765, George in 1766, and Edward in 1767. Her custom was to keep an infant at home for several months and then placed it with Elizabeth Littlewood, a woman living nearby to nurse and raise for twelve to eighteen months.|$|E
5|$|There were {{calls for}} Diefenbaker's retirement, {{especially}} from the Bay Street {{wing of the party}} as early as 1964. Diefenbaker initially beat back attempts to remove him without trouble. When Pearson called an election in 1965 in <b>the</b> <b>expectation</b> <b>of</b> receiving a majority, Diefenbaker ran an aggressive campaign. The Liberals fell two seats short of a majority, and the Tories improved their position slightly {{at the expense of the}} smaller parties. After the election, some Tories, led by party president Dalton Camp, began a quiet campaign to oust Diefenbaker.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, the James River Squadron {{had turned}} its {{attention}} to Minnesota, which had left Fort Monroe {{to join in the}} battle and had run aground. After Virginia had dealt with the surrender of Congress, she joined the James River Squadron despite her damage. Because of her deep draft and the falling tide, however, Virginia was unable to get close enough to be effective, and darkness prevented the rest of the squadron from aiming their guns to any effect. The attack was therefore suspended. Virginia left with <b>the</b> <b>expectation</b> <b>of</b> returning the next day and completing the task. She retreated into the safety of Confederate-controlled waters off Sewell's Point for the night, but had killed 400 enemy sailors and had lost two. The Union had lost two ships and three were aground.|$|E
5|$|This {{behaviour}} {{appears at}} first to be an evolutionary paradox, since helping others costs precious resources and decreases one's own fitness. Previously, many had interpreted this as an aspect of group selection: individuals are doing {{what is best for}} the survival of the population or species as a whole. British evolutionary biologist W. D. Hamilton used gene-frequency analysis in his inclusive fitness theory to show how hereditary altruistic traits can evolve if there is sufficient genetic similarity between actors and recipients of such altruism (including close relatives). Hamilton's inclusive fitness has since been successfully applied to a wide range of organisms, including humans. Similarly, Robert Trivers, thinking in terms of the gene-centred model, developed the theory of reciprocal altruism, whereby one organism provides a benefit to another in <b>the</b> <b>expectation</b> <b>of</b> future reciprocation. Dawkins popularised these ideas in The Selfish Gene, and developed them in his own work. In June 2012 Dawkins was highly critical of fellow biologist E.O. Wilson's 2012 book The Social Conquest of Earth as misunderstanding Hamilton's theory of kin selection. Dawkins has also been strongly critical of the Gaia hypothesis of the independent scientist James Lovelock.|$|E
5|$|The {{air raids}} on Singapore raised {{the morale of}} the island's {{civilian}} population. They were seen as heralding Singapore's liberation from Japan's oppressive rule, though civilians were generally careful to hide this belief from Japanese occupation personnel. The B-29s were widely believed to be invulnerable, and civilians were cheered by their apparent ability to attack the Japanese at will. In an attempt to counter this view, the occupation authorities exhibited wreckage from downed B-29s and surviving crew members as well as film footage of a Superfortress being shot down. This propaganda campaign was not successful. The Japanese also failed in their attempts to rouse Singapore's Muslim population against the raids by highlighting damage suffered by a mosque on 11January and 24February, the latter a raid which coincided with the celebration of Muhammad's birthday. Another factor which contributed to public support for the raids was that the policy of targeting military installations meant that {{only a limited number of}} civilians became casualties, and the American bombing came to be seen as highly accurate. <b>The</b> <b>expectation</b> <b>of</b> further attacks caused the prices of food and other commodities to rise, however, as people stockpiled necessities; Japanese attempts to stop this hoarding and profiteering were not successful.|$|E
