5|$|Basil II is {{considered}} among the most capable Byzantine emperors and his reign as <b>the</b> <b>apex</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> empire in the Middle Ages. By 1025, the date of Basil II's death, the Byzantine Empire stretched from Armenia in the east to Calabria in Southern Italy in the west. Many successes had been achieved, ranging from the conquest of Bulgaria to the annexation of parts of Georgia and Armenia, and the reconquest of Crete, Cyprus, and the important city of Antioch. These were not temporary tactical gains but long-term reconquests.|$|E
5|$|Marsh {{and then}} Hatcher {{assumed that the}} animal was aquatic, because of the {{position}} of its nasal openings at <b>the</b> <b>apex</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cranium. Similar aquatic behavior was commonly depicted for other large sauropods, such as Brachiosaurus and Apatosaurus. A 1951 study by Kenneth A. Kermack indicates that sauropods probably could not have breathed through their nostrils {{when the rest of the}} body was submerged, as the water pressure on the chest wall would be too great. Since the 1970s, general consensus has the sauropods as firmly terrestrial animals, browsing on trees, ferns, and bushes.|$|E
5|$|The Costa Rican bolete Leccinum neotropicalis is {{a closely}} allied species. It is {{distinguished}} from L.rugosiceps by its dark brown to dark reddish-brown color, and flesh {{that does not}} stain with injury. L.viscosum, found in Belize, features a similar cap and scaber pigmentation on the stipe, and similar color changes in response to injury in {{the flesh of the}} cap and <b>the</b> <b>apex</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stipe; unlike L.rugosiceps, however, it also stains at the stipe base, and the cap is sticky rather than dry.|$|E
50|$|Boron suboxide (chemical formula B6O) {{is a solid}} {{compound}} with {{a structure}} built <b>of</b> eight icosahedra at <b>the</b> <b>apexes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rhombohedral unit cell.

The King tried to limit access to higher offices to Catholics. Anti-Protestant riots took place in some cities. During the Sandomierz Rebellion of 1606 the Protestants supported the anti-King opposition in large numbers. Nevertheless, the massive wave of szlachta's return to Catholicism could not have been stopped.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} his reign, Neferhotep I {{shared the}} throne with his brother Sihathor, a coregency that lasted a few months to a year. Sihathor died shortly before Neferhotep, who {{probably}} then appointed another brother, Sobekhotep IV, as coregent. In any case, Sobekhotep IV succeeded Neferhotep I soon afterwards, and reigned over Egypt for almost a decade. The reigns of the two brothers mark <b>the</b> <b>apex</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 13th Dynasty.|$|E
5|$|Amenemhat IV {{first came}} to power as a junior coregent of his {{predecessor}} Amenemhat III, whose reign marks <b>the</b> <b>apex</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Middle Kingdom period. The coregency is well attested by numerous monuments and artefacts where {{the names of the}} two kings parallel each other. The length of this coregency is uncertain; it could have lasted from one to seven years, although most scholars believe it was only two years long. The Turin Canon, a king list redacted during the early Ramesside period, records Amenemhat IV on Column 6, Row 1, and credits him with a reign of 9 years, 3 months and 27 days. Amenemhat IV is also recorded on Entry 65 of the Abydos King List and Entry 38 of the Saqqara Tablet, both of which date to the New Kingdom.|$|E

Should an individual receive multiple awards of the Victoria Cross, additional bronze medal bars {{are added to the}} ribbon and further miniatures are placed evenly on the ribbon bar, reflecting the number of crosses the wearer has earned.|$|E
5|$|From {{around the}} 1860s to just before World War II {{passengers}} could ride to Kittanning Point station near the Curve. Two branch railroads {{connected to the}} main line at Horseshoe Curve in the early 20th century; the Kittanning Run Railroad and the railroad owned by the Glen White Coal and Lumber Company followed their respective creeks to nearby coal mines. The Pennsylvania Railroad delivered empty hopper cars to the Kittanning Point station which the two railroads returned loaded with coal. Across from the station, a spur track on the hillside supplied a coal trestle, where trains could take on fuel and water during the early 1900s. A reservoir was built at <b>the</b> <b>apex</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Horseshoe Curve in 1887 {{for the city of}} Altoona; a second reservoir, below the first, was finished in 1896. The third reservoir, Lake Altoona, was completed by 1913. A macadam road to the curve was opened in 1932 allowing access for visitors, and a gift shop was built in 1940.|$|E
5|$|Growth is slow, and the veligers {{are carried}} by the ocean {{currents}} for up to 14 weeks. As the veligers mature, they develop their first shell (the smooth protoconch) and turn into very small juvenile snails, at which point they sink to the ocean floor. As {{is the case in}} all shelled mollusks, the mantle is what secretes the shell; shell growth begins at what will later become <b>the</b> <b>apex</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shell, and typically rotates clockwise. As the animal gradually matures, the mantle continues to secrete shell material. Scotch bonnets complete maturation in one to six years. However, some have lived more than six years.|$|E

5|$|Historian Lowell H. Harrison called Stanley's {{administration}} <b>the</b> <b>apex</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Progressive Era in Kentucky. The {{most significant}} legislation passed during the 1916 legislative session were a state antitrust law and {{a ban on}} railroads offering free passes to public figures. A Corrupt Practices Act required candidates for office to file reports of their expenses, limited the amount of allowable expenses, and forbade public service corporations from contributing to any campaign. Other accomplishments included initiating the state's first budget program, enacting its first workman's compensation law, and instituting a convict labor law. The one progressive measure that did not pass, a bill granting women's suffrage, failed in the House by a single vote.|$|E
5|$|Ordinary {{soldiers}} were merely recruited or conscripted rural farmers, while surrendered bandits and mercenaries also joined the military. Soldiers were not awarded official status by Confucian scholars {{as belonging to}} one of the Four Occupations; the scholar-officials were wary of condoning or legitimizing those whose lives revolved around the uncivilized practices of wu (violence). Even though the military examinations, rankings, and posts were parallel to those of the civil order, scholar-officials and the gentry nonetheless viewed military pursuits as uncultivated. Despite this disdain and argument of moral high ground, scholar-officials often commanded troops and wielded military power. Yet scholar-officials were not at <b>the</b> <b>apex</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> military or even civilian order; at the pinnacle of society was the emperor. The emperor's use of violence was seen as a necessity to rein in rebellious elements of society and dominate violent and uncultivated Inner Asian tribes, who would then submit to the emperor and become transformed by China's superior wen (culture and civilization).|$|E
5|$|Since the {{original}} description, the systematic {{status of the}} tribe {{has been the focus}} of debate. Bolton (2003) was the first to suggest the taxonomic instability of Tatuidris within Myrmicinae and raised the genus to the level of a new subfamily, the Agroecomyrmecinae, suggesting that Agroecomyrmecinae might be the sister taxon to Myrmicinae. The subfamily rank was re-assessed by Baroni Urbani & de Andrade in 2007, this was the first attempt to include Tatuidris as a terminal taxon in a morphological cladistic analysis. In their study, Baroni Urbani & de Andrade identified morphological synapomorphies shared between Tatuidris and the dacetines, justifying the inclusion of the genus within Myrmicinae. In addition, two autapomorphies (a differently shaped petiolar tergum and sternum, and the eyes at or close to <b>the</b> <b>apex</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> antennal scrobe) separated Tatuidris from all other extant ant genera included in their study.|$|E
