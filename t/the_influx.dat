5|$|The Panic of 1893 {{caused the}} price of silver to crash; the gold price, however, {{remained}} fixed, as the United States was on the gold standard. <b>The</b> <b>influx</b> of silver miners into the gold mines caused a lowering of wages. Mine owners demanded longer hours for less pay.|$|E
40|$|Parmelia sulcata transplants {{were used}} in three {{different}} exposure systems, focused on three different influxes: free influx, horizontal influx and vertical <b>influx.</b> <b>The</b> total element deposition and the precipitation volumes {{were found to be}} positively correlated for Fe and Ni only. The element contents in lichen transplants and in total element deposition showed significant correlations for Ca, Fe and Mn in <b>the</b> free <b>influx</b> system and for Na, Ni and V in <b>the</b> horizontal <b>influx</b> system. No significant positive correlations were found for <b>the</b> vertical <b>influx.</b> <b>The</b> results indicate that, apart from response rates, the transplant positioning systems may have effects on element-specific net accumulation.

30|$|Many plasma-technological {{applications}} {{are based on}} plasma wall interaction, which can be characterised by calorimetric probes to measure <b>the</b> energy <b>influx</b> from <b>the</b> plasma to the substrate surface. Passive probes {{are based on the}} principle of recording the temperature course during heating and cooling of the probe for calculating <b>the</b> energy <b>influx.</b> <b>The</b> disadvantages of these probes are that <b>the</b> energy <b>influx</b> has to be interrupted by switching off the energy source or by using suitable apertures and by the necessity of knowing the exact heat capacity of the probe.|$|R
5|$|The {{revitalization}} of {{businesses in the}} former village was credited to <b>the</b> <b>influx</b> of artists. Prior to the 1980s, store owners in Rosendale Village had either retired or died, and their shops had become residential or simply abandoned. Newcomers purchased these properties, restored them, and returned them to commercial service.|$|E

5|$|In recent years, {{service and}} high-tech-oriented {{businesses}} have prospered in Bratislava. Many global companies, including IBM, Dell, Lenovo, AT, SAP, and Accenture, have built outsourcing and service centres here or {{plan to do}} so soon.

30|$|The {{coincidence}} of <b>the</b> refugee <b>influx</b> with <b>the</b> study was an unexpected and unpredictable event. As {{data was collected}} in different seasons, <b>the</b> before <b>influx</b> data from March could not be strictly compared to <b>the</b> post <b>influx</b> data collected in June and October. Nevertheless, some same season/survey comparisons {{could be made to}} gauge differences between non-grazing reserve (represented by new immigrants) and grazing reserve (represented by old settlers) settings.|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> energy <b>influx</b> at <b>the</b> probe can be {{measured}} with an accuracy of approximately 1 mW/cm 2, which has been confirmed by the fluctuations of the used prototype.

40|$|AbstractA {{digital imaging}} {{fluorescence}} microscope {{was used to}} study {{the effect of a}} protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine on the antigen-dependent calcium signals in an individual rat basophilic leukemia cell (RBL- 2 H 3). Although dose dependency of staurosporine was different from one cell to another, staurosporine inhibited, at low concentration, <b>the</b> calcium <b>influx</b> from <b>the</b> external medium into RBL- 2 H 3 cells. At high concentration, however, it inhibited both the removal of calcium ion from internal stores and <b>the</b> calcium <b>influx</b> from <b>the</b> external medium. These results indicated that staurosporine is necessary for the inhibition of <b>the</b> calcium <b>influx</b> from <b>the</b> external medium and that a protein kinase (possibly protein kinase C) is involved in <b>the</b> calcium <b>influx</b> from <b>the</b> external medium into the cytoplasm...|$|R
5|$|In the 1860s, the {{population}} of Berlin was growing rapidly with <b>the</b> <b>influx</b> of around 50,000 people a year, creating a large administrative burden. When construction began on the Rotes Rathaus, the city had around half a million inhabitants, but this grew to 800,000 {{by the time of}} its completion in 1869. By the 1880s, the city had offices in ten additional buildings near the Rotes Rathaus and since it could not be extended, it was clear that a second administration building was required.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, Hong Kong {{became the}} first of the Four Asian Tiger economies under rapid {{industrialisation}} driven by textile exports, manufacturing industries and re-exports of goods to China. As the population grew, with labour costs remaining low, living standards began to rise steadily. The construction of the Shek Kip Mei Estate in 1953 {{marked the beginning of the}} public housing estate programme to provide shelter for the less privileged and to cope with <b>the</b> <b>influx</b> of immigrants.|$|E
5|$|India's {{geography}} and geology are climatically pivotal: the Thar Desert {{in the northwest}} and the Himalayas in the north work in tandem to effect a culturally and economically important monsoonal regime. As Earth's highest and most massive mountain range, the Himalayas bar <b>the</b> <b>influx</b> of frigid katabatic winds from the icy Tibetan Plateau and northerly Central Asia. Most of North India is thus kept warm or is only mildly chilly or cold during winter; the same thermal dam keeps most regions in India hot in summer.|$|E

40|$|Glutamate and {{aspartate}} <b>influxes</b> across <b>the</b> brush {{border of}} rabbit intestine are saturable {{processes that are}} subject to competitive inhibition and are markedly influenced by the Na concentration in the mucosal solution. Lowering the Na concentration increases the amino acid concentration needed to elicit a half-maximal influx but does not significantly affect <b>the</b> maximal <b>influx.</b> <b>The</b> interaction between Na and anionic amino acid influx can be described by the same kinetic model that {{has been applied to}} <b>the</b> <b>influxes</b> of neutral amino acids and lysine. Comparison of the kinetic parameters for anionic, neutral, and cationic amino acids suggests that amino acid charge influences (a) the stability of the binary (amino acid-site) complex and (b) the affinity of this binary complex for the subsequent binding of Na.

5|$|Since {{opening its}} first store in 1998, the NBA has seen {{increasing}} business opportunities in foreign markets mainly due to <b>the</b> <b>influx</b> of new international players. The biggest {{growth has been}} in China, where players Yao Ming and Yi Jianlian, combined with the interest generated by the 2008 Summer Olympics, created enough demand to open two new stores. The NBA has also expanded into games like Second Life where it created a virtual NBA Store in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Some {{video game}} {{players have been}} able to make a viable {{business}} model out of playing video games as both a guide and for the entertainment of viewers.

50|$|Lodgings {{available}} {{to the general public}} at festivals ranged from crude huts or tents to elaborate inns reserved for the Greek and Roman elite.

40|$|<b>The</b> {{integral}} energy <b>influx</b> from <b>the</b> plasma to {{the substrate}} was determined for amorphous hydrogenated carbon (a-C:H) film deposition by magnetron sputtering {{and in an}} electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) discharge. The measurements, for which a thermal probe was designed, are based on time evolution of the substrate temperature during the deposition process. The different contributions to <b>the</b> integral energy <b>influx</b> were estimated by model calculations {{on the basis of}} assumptions for the kinetic energy of the charge carriers, their recombination, and film condensation. <b>The</b> energy <b>influx</b> during deposition in the CH 4 -ECR plasma, which is in the range of 0. 5 - 2 J s(- 1), is predominantly determined by ions and chemical reactions, while <b>the</b> energy <b>influx</b> in magnetron sputtering, being in the range of 0. 2 - 1. 2 J s(- 1), is mainly determined by fast neutrals and target radiation. e present results emphasise that <b>the</b> energy <b>influx</b> is a key parameter in thin film deposition and is important for comparison and scaling-up of different plasma process systems.
