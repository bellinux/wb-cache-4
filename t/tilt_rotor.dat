25|$|During this period, the US {{began to}} deploy Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey <b>tilt</b> <b>rotor</b> {{aircraft}} to Futenma in 2012, allowing the Marines (and the MV-22B Osprey aircraft) from Okinawa to train {{all along the}} length of Japan and around the entire Asia-Pacific region, with the Osprey's greatly increased speed, lift capabilities and range.|$|E
25|$|During 2000-06, {{studies of}} the {{aerodynamics}} and performance of a Quad <b>Tilt</b> <b>Rotor</b> were conducted at the University of Maryland, College Park. This effort was initially funded by NASA/AFDD and subsequently by Bell. An experimental investigation in helicopter mode with ground effect {{found that it was}} possible to reduce the download on the aircraft from 10% of the total thrust to an upload of 10% of the thrust. A parallel Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) study confirmed these findings.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to helicopter development, many approaches {{have been tried}} to develop practical aircraft with {{vertical take-off and landing}} capabilities including Henry Berliner's 1922–1925 experimental horizontal rotor fixed wing aircraft, and Nikola Tesla's 1928 patent and George Lehberger's 1930 patent for relatively impractical VTOL fixed wing airplanes with a tilting engines. In the late 1930s British aircraft designer Leslie Everett Baynes was issued a patent for the Baynes Heliplane, another <b>tilt</b> <b>rotor</b> aircraft. In 1941 German designer Heinrich Focke's began work on the Focke-Achgelis Fa 269, which had two rotors that tilted downward for vertical takeoff, but wartime bombing halted development.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1960s and early 1970s, NASA and other {{researchers}} worked extensively on theoretical and wind tunnel tests of various rotor pods. Two companies {{were involved in the}} research and proposing designs: Bell Helicopter and Boeing-Vertol. The focus was on tilt-rotor pods, integration of the <b>tilting</b> <b>rotors</b> with the wings and fuselage of the aircraft, and studying the airflow as the <b>rotors</b> <b>tilted.</b> <b>Tilt</b> <b>rotors</b> with fixed rotors and with folding rotors were investigated.|$|R

25|$|A {{tiltrotor}} is {{an aircraft}} {{which uses a}} pair or more of powered rotors (sometimes called proprotors) mounted on rotating shafts or nacelles {{at the end of}} a fixed wing for lift and propulsion, and combines the vertical lift capability of a helicopter with the speed and range of a conventional fixed-wing aircraft. In September 1930, George Lehberger devised the basic concept of <b>tilt</b> <b>rotor</b> aircraft, that is, a relatively low disc loading thruster (propeller) that can tilt its axis from the vertical (for vertical lift) to the horizontal (for propulsive thrust). On September 16, 1930, Lehberger was issued U.S. patent #1,775,861.|$|E
2500|$|MCAS Futenma is {{situated}} in Ginowan City (pop. 93,661). The base includes a [...] runway at 75 meters elevation, as well as extensive barracks, administrative and logistical facilities. The air station is tasked with operating a variety of fixed wing, rotary wing and <b>tilt</b> <b>rotor</b> aircraft {{in support of the}} III Marine Expeditionary Force, the Japan U.S. defense alliance and many allies and treaty partners in the region. The base is also used as a United Nations air distribution hub facility for response to disaster or other crisis requiring air supplies due to the length of the runway and elevation.|$|E
2500|$|In 2013 and 2014 the Navy {{conducted}} {{a review of}} various design alternatives for the LX(R), including: adopting the existing [...] design as-is, adopting a modified [...] version of the San Antonio-class design design with reduced capability and reduced cost, creating a brand new [...] "clean-sheet" [...] design, or adopting an existing foreign design. In early 2014, Huntington Ingalls Industries suggested {{a modified version of}} the San Antonio-class hull for the Navy's LX(R) amphibious warfare ship, which they designated as [...] "LPD Flight IIA". This design [...] modified the San Antonio-class by removing some of its higher-end capabilities, resulting in a design that had improved command and control features compared to the existing LSDs, half the medical spaces of the San Antonio-class, a smaller hangar for stowing two MV-22 <b>tilt</b> <b>rotor</b> aircraft, no composite masts, two main propulsion diesel engines instead of four, two spots for Landing Craft Air Cushion hovercraft or one Landing Craft Utility boat, and a reduced troop capacity.|$|E

A single <b>tilting</b> <b>rotor</b> multirotor helicopter is proposed that allows for decoupled lateral acceleration and attitude states. A dynamics model of the proposed multirotor helicopter is established to enable control system development. A control system architecture and daisy chaining-based control allocation scheme is developed and implemented. The control architecture facilitates the control of decoupled lateral accelerations and attitudes. Further, a computational and experimental analysis is undertaken and offers evidence that the proposed multirotor helicopter and control system architecture enables the multirotor helicopter to achieve lateral accelerations without requiring attitude actuation...|$|R
50|$|Around 2005-2010, Bell and Boeing {{teamed up}} again {{to perform a}} {{conceptual}} study of a larger Quad TiltRotor (QTR) for the US Army's Joint Heavy Lift (JHL) program.

25|$|Pitch {{control is}} {{achieved}} by <b>tilting</b> the <b>rotor</b> fore and aft; roll control by <b>tilting</b> the <b>rotor</b> laterally (side to side). Three designs to affect the <b>tilt</b> of the <b>rotor</b> are a <b>tilting</b> hub (Cierva), swashplate (Air & Space 18A), or servo-flaps. A rudder provides yaw control. On pusher configuration autogyros, the rudder is typically placed in the propeller slipstream to maximize yaw control at low airspeed (but not always, {{as seen in the}} McCulloch J-2, with twin rudders placed outboard of the propeller arc).|$|R
2500|$|The 80 by 120 Foot Wind Tunnel at NASA Ames Research Center is {{the largest}} wind tunnel test section in the world. This open circuit leg was added and a new fan drive system was {{installed}} in the 1980s. The 80 by 120 Foot Wind Tunnel is used to support an active research program in aerodynamics, dynamics, model noise, and full-scale aircraft and their components. The aerodynamic characteristics of new configurations are investigated, {{with an emphasis on}} estimating the accuracy of computational methods. Aeromechanical stability boundaries of advanced rotorcraft and rotor-fuselage interactions are explored. The acoustic characteristics of most of the full-scale vehicles are also determined, as well as acoustic research aimed at discovering and reducing aerodynamic sources of noise. In addition to the normal data gathering methods (e.g., balance system, pressure measuring transducers, and temperature sensing thermocouples), state-of-the-art non-intrusive instrumentation (e.g., laser velocimeters and shadowgraphs) are available to help determine flow direction and velocity in and around the lifting surfaces of models or aircraft undergoing investigation. Some of the test programs that have come through the 80 by 120 Foot include: F-18 High Angle of Attack Vehicle, DARPA/Lockheed Common Affordable Lightweight Fighter, XV-15 <b>Tilt</b> <b>Rotor,</b> and Advance Recovery System Parafoil.

2500|$|A control moment {{gyroscope}} (CMG) is {{an attitude}} control device generally used in spacecraft attitude control systems.

25|$|There {{are three}} primary flight controls: control stick, rudder pedals, and throttle. Typically, the control stick is termed the cyclic and <b>tilts</b> the <b>rotor</b> in the desired {{direction}} to provide {{pitch and roll}} control (some autogyros do not <b>tilt</b> the <b>rotor</b> relative to the airframe, or only do so in one dimension, and have conventional control surfaces to vary the remaining degrees of freedom). The rudder pedals provide yaw control, and the throttle controls engine power.|$|R
50|$|Tandem rotors are two {{horizontal}} {{main rotor}} assemblies mounted one behind the other. Tandem rotors achieve pitch attitude changes to accelerate and decelerate the helicopter {{through a process}} called cyclic pitch. To pitch forward and accelerate, both rotors increase the pitch at the rear and reduce the pitch at the front (cyclic)keeping torque the same on both rotors, flying sideways is achieved by increasing the pitch {{on one side and}} reducing pitch on the other. Yaw control develops through opposing cyclic pitch in each rotor. To pivot right, the front <b>rotor</b> <b>tilts</b> right and the rear <b>rotor</b> <b>tilts</b> left. To pivot left, the front <b>rotor</b> <b>tilts</b> left and the rear <b>rotor</b> <b>tilts</b> right. All <b>rotor</b> power contributes to lift, and it is simpler to handle changes in the center of gravity fore-aft. However, it requires the expense of two large rotors rather than the more common one large main rotor and a much smaller tail rotor. The Boeing CH-47 Chinook is the most common tandem rotor helicopter.|$|R
