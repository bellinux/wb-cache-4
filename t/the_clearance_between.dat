2500|$|The LA-8 {{is largely}} built from plastic foam and PVC filled glass fibre sandwich. Its wing {{is divided into}} {{watertight}} compartments. [...] The amphibian is a cantilever high-wing monoplane with straight tapered wings; most of the sweep is on the trailing edge. The prototype originally had downturned wing tips but these were replaced with extended upturned tips by 2006 and by early 2011 a later aircraft had winglets which extended both {{above and below the}} tips. [...] There is no dihedral. [...] Its twin engines are placed above and ahead of the wing leading edge, as close to the centre-line as <b>the</b> <b>clearance</b> <b>between</b> propeller and fuselage allows.

2500|$|The super-speed Transrapid maglev {{system has}} no wheels, no axles, no gear transmissions, no steel rails, and no {{overhead}} electrical pantographs.

30|$|As {{early as}} in 1997, China Academy of Railway Sciences (CARS) put forward the {{conception}} of a vehicle for track elasticity measurement [33]. This vehicle comprises a heavy car {{in the front and}} a light car in the rear.

Thus, the influence of different train axle loads on the measured results can be obtained. The light car weighs 40 Â kN and is used to eliminate <b>the</b> <b>clearances</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> rail and sleeper as well as between the sleeper and ballast bed.
