5|$|NHL 17, an {{ice hockey}} {{simulation}} video game, uses the Ignite engine, created by Electronic Arts. During a game, players maneuver around the ice with normal skating and deking {{and are able}} to seamlessly pass to teammates to create scoring chances. If a player scores a goal, they are able to celebrate <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> to; many new celebrations were added to the game. One newly added celebration was a mimicked version of baseball player José Bautista's iconic bat flip that occurred during the 2015 American League Division Series. Defensively, the player can skate their way to the puck carrier and have a chance to break up the play. The player has multiple ways of doing so; pushing the carrier off of the puck, delivering a body check, or pushing them towards the boards of the ice. If they wish, the player can enable the On-Ice Trainer, a system made to assist the player as they play. NHL 17 features game presentation {{in the style of the}} NHL on NBC, with commentary being provided by Mike Emrick (play-by-play), Eddie Olczyk (color) and Ray Ferraro (ice-side reporter), with the network's score bug appearing on-screen as well.|$|E

500|$|Upon its release, [...] "The Life" [...] was {{met with}} {{positive}} reviews from music critics. Joey Nolfi of Entertainment Weekly called the song a [...] "summer banger", noting its use of [...] "upbeat, danceable production, with a tropically-tinged drop building to a purely-pop chorus." [...] Madeline Roth of MTV, called the song, [...] "a summer anthem in the making", and noted the song's themes of [...] "self-care" [...] and [...] "the importance of living stress-free". Writing for Vulture, Dee Lockett thought [...] "The Life" [...] generates a feeling as if one is [...] "floating on a summer breeze." [...] Lockett continues his review by acknowledging the success of Fifth Harmony's life, saying it is their [...] "God-given right of any young girl group" [...] to live <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> to live. Lewis Corner and Amy Davidson from British entertainment website Digital Spy, listed the song at number one on their top 10 playlist songs, calling it an [...] "urban bop with an earworm refrain". They also labelled it a [...] "sunny pop number" [...] referring to the summer atmosphere the song has.|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Soldier" [...] is a {{continuation}} of the previous song on Destiny Fulfilled, [...] "Lose My Breath". As the singers feel that their man does not fulfill them in <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>want,</b> they tell him [...] "I need a soldier", further [...] "upping their standards". They request their man to be a [...] "", proclaiming their love for [...] "country boys"; their preference include a [...] "soldier" [...] who is [...] "street" [...] and [...] "hood". MacPherson further felt that the trio cruised the ghetto for suitable men with [...] "Soldier", an [...] "ode to gangsta love". Corey Moss of MTV felt that the song {{was one of the most}} personal moments on Destiny Fulfilled in the sense that Beyoncé's then-relatively secret relationship with rapper Jay-Z was acknowledged [...] "on record for the first time". Moss further elaborated, [...] "Albeit minor, her [...] verse (about falling for a guy from the BK, as in Jay's Brooklyn stomping grounds) offers a rare moment of commentary on the couple, which has thus far only been chronicled by tabloid photographers." [...] The song opens with T.I. rhyming lines and glorifying the profound love [...] "between a thug and a thugette". As the song progresses, each member of Destiny's Child describes their own favorite type of man, later harmonizing together for the chorus. Midway through the song, Lil Wayne's verse contains a reference to rapper B.G.. Williams is the last artist to sing her solo lines, which were described as [...] "the sexiest" [...] by Rashod Ollisong of The Baltimore Sun.|$|E

2500|$|In Echlin's {{article in}} The Guardian, six reasons for {{choosing}} polyamory are identified: a drive towards female independence and equality driven by feminism; disillusionment with monogamy; a yearning for community; honesty and realism {{in respect of}} relational nature of human beings; human nature; and individual non-matching of the traditional monogamous stereotype. Jim Fleckenstein, director of the Institute for 21st-Century Relationships, is quoted as stating that the polyamory movement has been driven not only by science fiction, but also by feminism: [...] "Increased financial independence means that women can build relationships <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> to." [...] The disillusionment with monogamy {{is said to be}} [...] "because of widespread cheating and divorce". The longing for community is associated with a felt need for the richness of [...] "complex and deep relationships through extended networks" [...] in response to the replacement and fragmentation of the extended family by nuclear families. [...] "For many", Echlin writes, [...] "it is a hankering for community... we have become increasingly alienated, partly because of the 20th century's replacement of the extended family with the nuclear family. As a result, many of us are striving to create complex and deep relationships through extended networks of multiple lovers and extended families... Polys agree that some people are monogamous by nature. But some of us are not, and more and more are refusing to be shoehorned into monogamy." ...|$|E

60|$|The Bishop {{has just}} spoken of a {{condition}} of things which {{none of us can}} deny, and which ought not to exist; that is, the lust of gain--a lust which does not stop short of the penitentiary or the jail to accomplish its ends. But we may be sure of one thing, and that is that this sort of thing is not universal. If it were, this country would not be. You may put this down as a fact: that out of every fifty men, forty-nine are clean. Then why is it, you may ask, that the forty-nine don't have things <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> them? I'll tell you why it is. A good deal has been said here to-night about what is to be accomplished by organization. That's just the thing.

That kind of shakes the starch out of the brotherly love and New Jerusalem business. You go through the mill, and you'll have a bigger grudge against every old shellback that dirties his plate in the three oceans than the Bank of California could settle up.
