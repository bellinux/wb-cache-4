5|$|The Daicon III {{film was}} {{reported}} on in Animec magazine {{which resulted in}} requests for the film to be released publicly. In order to pay off <b>the</b> <b>debts</b> from producing the film, {{the decision was made}} to sell 8mm reels of the film and videos. Additional original artwork and the storyboards were included in the release. The sale paid <b>the</b> <b>debts</b> and the profit would be used to produce Daicon IV.|$|E
5|$|After docking in Kiel, the {{men from}} Asar-i Tevfik were {{transferred}} to İzmir, but with no funds to buy coal, the men were stranded in Germany. Germaniawerft stripped down Asar-i Tevfik, but then halted work to await the first Ottoman payment. By mid-1901, the men had accumulated significant debt and the Ottoman government had {{made no effort to}} return them or pay the installments for the modernization program. Even Kaiser Wilhelm II became involved in an attempt to press the Ottoman government to settle <b>the</b> <b>debts</b> incurred by the sailors. Instead, the Ottomans demanded that Krupp, the owner of the Germaniawerft shipyard, make an advance of 6,000lira so that İzmir could be prepared for the voyage back to Constantinople. The Ottomans were at the time negotiating for a large armament contract with Krupp for the Army, and used this as leverage; by late 1901, Krupp conceded, rather than risk the lucrative contract. <b>The</b> <b>debts</b> in Kiel were paid and İzmir finally departed for home.|$|E
5|$|Balzac {{borrowed}} {{money from his}} family and friends, and tried to build a printing business, then a typefounder enterprise. His inexperience and lack of capital caused his ruin in these trades. He gave the businesses to a friend (who made them successful) but carried <b>the</b> <b>debts</b> for many years. As of April 1828 Balzac owed 50,000 francs to his mother.|$|E
50|$|In {{corporate}} finance, upon an uncured default, {{the holders}} of <b>the</b> <b>debt</b> will usually initiate proceedings (file a petition of involuntary bankruptcy) to foreclose on any collateral securing <b>the</b> <b>debt.</b> Even if <b>the</b> <b>debt</b> is not secured by collateral, debt holders may still sue for bankruptcy, {{to ensure that}} the corporation's assets are used to repay <b>the</b> <b>debt.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 2012, the Peterson Foundation {{launched}} its Fiscal Confidence Index, a monthly measure of public attitudes about <b>the</b> nation's long-term <b>debt</b> and <b>the</b> efforts elected leaders are making to address <b>the</b> <b>debt.</b> It is {{modeled after the}} Consumer Confidence Index and surveys public opinion {{on the level of}} concern about <b>the</b> <b>debt,</b> <b>the</b> importance of addressing <b>the</b> <b>debt</b> as a policy priority, and expectations about <b>the</b> <b>debt</b> over <b>the</b> next several years.|$|R
40|$|As {{budget deficits}} turned to {{surpluses}} and <b>the</b> federal <b>debt</b> began to shrink {{at the end}} of the 1990 s, the possibility that <b>the</b> federal <b>debt</b> could be eliminated arose. This paper provides historical analysis of <b>the</b> <b>debt</b> to help decide if the nation’s economy would be healthier without <b>the</b> federal <b>debt.</b> After presenting <b>the</b> history of <b>the</b> <b>debt,</b> <b>the</b> paper assesses the trends of the major components of <b>the</b> <b>debt</b> — <b>the</b> portions owned by the government, the Federal Reserve, and private investors, both domestic and foreign. That leads to a final consideration of the economic implications of eliminating <b>the</b> federal <b>debt...</b>|$|R
5|$|Many {{migrant workers}} have little education, little {{knowledge}} {{of the law and}} their rights, and leave home to support their families. They fall victim to agents (official and unofficial), unscrupulous officials and a lack of legal protection at home and in their host countries. <b>The</b> <b>debts</b> they incur to secure employment overseas may lock them in a cycle of abuse and exploitation.|$|E
5|$|Several {{years after}} Clark's death {{the state of}} Virginia granted his estate $30,000 ($ in 2009 chained dollars) as a partial payment on <b>the</b> <b>debts</b> it owed him. The {{government}} of Virginia continued to repay Clark for decades; the last payment to his estate was made in 1913.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{his time}} as Solicitor-General, Garran's work {{included}} the preparation of the Debt Conversion Agreement between the Government of Australia and the governments of the states, which involved the federal government taking over and managing <b>the</b> <b>debts</b> of the individual states, following the 1928 referendum.|$|E

40|$|The fate of <b>the</b> distressed <b>debt</b> {{issued by}} <b>the</b> 1836 - 1845 Republic of Texas has {{received}} surprisingly little attention. Annexation by the United States {{was almost certainly}} {{a necessary condition for}} <b>the</b> <b>debt</b> rising from <b>the</b> pennies-on-the-dollar values seen in the early 1840 s. But the largest gains awaited legislation in the early 1850 s that fixed the repayment terms on <b>the</b> <b>debt.</b> Statistical analysis confirms the link between <b>the</b> <b>debt</b> price and actual, or anticipated, congressional actions on <b>the</b> <b>debt</b> settlement after 1844...|$|R
5|$|Aside from Parliamentary and {{business}} commitments, {{he served as}} a Deputy Lieutenant for Lincolnshire and a Justice of the Peace. Boucherett was also an officer in the Yeoman volunteers, being a Captain the Market Raisin Yeomanry in 1798 and then a Lieutenant-Colonel in and Commandant of the North Lincolnshire Yeomanry from 1814 until his death. He died in a carriage accident on 15 September 1815. At his death, his assets barely covered <b>the</b> <b>debts</b> he had accrued in his lifetime. He was succeeded as the High Steward of Grimsby by the Hon. George Anderson Pelham, the second son of the first Lord Yarborough.|$|E
5|$|Debt service {{funds are}} used to account for money {{that will be used}} to pay the {{interest}} and principal of long-term debts. Bonds used by a government to finance major construction projects, to be paid by tax levies over a period of years, require a debt service fund to account for their repayment. <b>The</b> <b>debts</b> of permanent and proprietary funds are serviced within those funds, rather than by a separate debt service fund.|$|E
5|$|Despite <b>the</b> <b>debts</b> {{related to}} the costs for the {{construction}} of the building having been settled in the early-mid 19th century, and the church ceasing to exist 100 years later, the three acts of Parliament allowing trustees of the church to levy rates on properties in the parish for the purpose of settling those debts remained in force and untouched until the Law Commission proposed their repeal in July 2014, with a view to presenting recommendations to Parliament in 2015.|$|E
40|$|They say we {{have too}} much debt. We need better credit, more credit, less spending. They offer us credit repair, credit counseling, microcredit, {{personal}} financial planning.

5|$|Discovering {{that many}} of his satraps and {{military}} governors had misbehaved in his absence, Alexander executed several of them as examples on his way to Susa. As a gesture of thanks, he paid off <b>the</b> <b>debts</b> of his soldiers, and announced that he would send over-aged and disabled veterans back to Macedon, led by Craterus. His troops misunderstood his intention and mutinied at the town of Opis. They refused to be sent away and criticized his adoption of Persian customs and dress and the introduction of Persian officers and soldiers into Macedonian units.|$|E
5|$|In Mackay's account, the panicked tulip speculators {{sought help}} from the {{government}} of the Netherlands, which responded by declaring that anyone who had bought contracts to purchase bulbs in the future could void their contract by payment of a 10 percent fee. Attempts were made to resolve the situation to the satisfaction of all parties, but these were unsuccessful. The mania finally ended, Mackay says, with individuals stuck with the bulbs they held {{at the end of the}} crash—no court would enforce payment of a contract, since judges regarded <b>the</b> <b>debts</b> as contracted through gambling, and thus not enforceable by law.|$|E
5|$|Originally, the {{productions}} {{were intended}} to be shot in 16mm film, but both were shot in 8mm film instead and were completed only the morning before their debut. In order to pay off <b>the</b> <b>debts</b> of the productions, video copies of the animation were sold. Eng declares this as the first example of original video animation (OVA) predating Dallos. Kazutaka Miyatake of Studio Nue originally designed the mecha that appears in the Daicon III clip chasing the little girl for a Japanese edition of the military science fiction novel Starship Troopers novel in the early eighties.|$|E

30|$|Based on {{the above}} research, if want {{to prevent and}} control <b>the</b> <b>debt</b> risk of Chinese local government, an {{important}} step is to realize the relationship between <b>the</b> local <b>debt</b> power, responsibility, and interests. The core method is {{to make an effort}} to prevent social interests from the corruption of private benefit through debt responsibility. In particular, there are three aspects, which endow <b>the</b> <b>debt</b> power to <b>the</b> local government in real time, assuring <b>the</b> <b>debt</b> responsibility of <b>the</b> local government reasonably, truly transforming <b>the</b> <b>debt</b> interests of <b>the</b> local government.|$|R

5|$|Shortly {{before the}} wedding, Truman and Jacobson opened a {{haberdashery}} together at 104 West 12th Street in downtown Kansas City. After brief initial success, the store went bankrupt {{during the recession}} of 1921. Truman did not pay off the last of <b>the</b> <b>debts</b> from that venture until 1934, when he did so {{with the aid of}} a political supporter. Jacobson and Truman remained close friends, and Jacobson's advice to Truman on Zionism later played a role in the U.S. government's decision to recognize Israel.|$|E
5|$|The {{problem of}} the Prince of Wales's debts, which {{amounted}} to the extraordinary sum of £630,000 (equivalent to £ today) in 1795, was solved (at least temporarily) by Parliament. Being unwilling to make an outright grant to relieve these debts, it provided him an additional sum of £65,000 (equivalent to £ today) per annum. In 1803, a further £60,000 (equivalent to £ today) was added, and George's debts of 1795 were finally cleared in 1806, although <b>the</b> <b>debts</b> he had incurred since 1795 remained.|$|E
5|$|Tina later {{credited}} the Nichiren Buddhist {{faith and}} chanting Nam Myoho Renge Kyo with {{giving her the}} courage to strike out on her own. However, by walking out on Ike {{in the middle of}} a tour, she learned she was legally responsible to tour promoters for the canceled shows. After a year in court, their divorce was made final on March 29, 1978. In the divorce, she completely parted ways with him, retaining only her stage name and assuming responsibility for <b>the</b> <b>debts</b> incurred by the canceled tour as well as a significant Internal Revenue Service lien.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{system had}} <b>debt</b> {{problems}} in 1998. <b>The</b> <b>debt</b> servicing of SkyTrain was {{three and a}} half times the actual operating budget, whereas <b>the</b> <b>debt</b> servicing of buses was only one-seventh the operating budget. During construction of the Surrey extension, the Vancouver Regional Transit Commission, a division of BC Transit, was $30 million in <b>debt.</b> <b>The</b> provincial government agreed to cover <b>the</b> <b>debt</b> in 1991 for three years.|$|R
5000|$|A {{consumer}} {{may apply}} in person to a debt counsellor to be declared over-indebted (although {{this is not}} permitted if the credit provider has already taken steps to recover <b>the</b> <b>debt).</b> <b>The</b> consumer must apply by completing and submitting Form 16 to the Regulations.

5|$|After this, Surya {{promises}} to clear <b>the</b> <b>debts</b> of Dharavi locals {{so that their}} houses will not be repossessed. His men rob the original copies of the loan documents in the local branch of Bank of Maharashtra and destroy the bank records. Surya slowly becomes both popular and feared as an extortionist, while Dharavi locals praise him as their saviour. Surya is aware of Bhardwaj's intentions. To safeguard himself, he traps Bhardwaj's daughter Chitra, a keen painter, by posing as a NRI businessman interested in arts. They both fall in love. However, by the time Surya realises that he truly loves her, Bhardwaj has exposed Surya's real nature to Chitra which makes her hate him. Surya is immediately arrested.|$|E
5|$|Before the Bankruptcy Act of 1869, debtors in England were {{routinely}} imprisoned at {{the pleasure of}} their creditors. Around 10,000people in England and Wales were in prison for debt in 1641, often for small amounts. In the 18th century debtors comprised over half the prison population: 945 of London's 1,500 prisoners in 1779 were debtors. According to John Wade, writing in 1829, in London in 1826–1827, 753 people were imprisoned for debts under ₤5, for between 20 and 100 days. In Southwark that year <b>the</b> <b>debts</b> of 1,893 prisoners amounted collectively to ₤16,442 (over ₤1 million in 2014). Other European countries had legislation limiting imprisonment for debt to one year, but debtors in England were imprisoned until their creditors were satisfied. When the Fleet Prison closed in 1842, two debtors were found to have been there for 30years.|$|E
5|$|For three seasons, City {{finished}} in mid-table in Division Three {{and the new}} Division Two, when the leagues were renamed following {{the formation of the}} Premier League. In January 1994, Geoffrey Richmond took over as chairman. He cleared <b>the</b> <b>debts,</b> loaned the club £2.3million, and promised the fans he would take the club to the Premier League within five years. In his first season as chairman, the club {{finished in}} seventh place with Frank Stapleton as manager. Stapleton was sacked and was replaced by Lennie Lawrence. Lawrence could only finish 14th in his first season, before he left for Luton Town in November 1995 to be replaced by his assistant Chris Kamara.|$|E

40|$|The {{agricultural}} development has caused still {{bigger and more}} expensive farms in Denmark. <b>The</b> <b>debt</b> ratio therefore has increased {{and has become a}} severe problem for the farmer.
