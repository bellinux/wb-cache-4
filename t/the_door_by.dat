5|$|Ser Alliser Thorne convenes {{the other}} black {{brothers}} and takes responsibility for Jon's murder. Several black brothers accuse Thorne {{and the other}} officers of treason, but Thorne wins them over by citing Jon's actions and stating that Jon would have destroyed the Night's Watch by letting in the Wildlings. Alliser and the other mutineers then surround the store-room and promise Davos and Jon's friends amnesty if they surrender, but threaten to attack if they don't open <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>by</b> nightfall.|$|E
5|$|Another {{survivor}} was Katriel Katz, Israeli Ambassador to the Soviet Union. Katz {{had been}} {{expelled from the}} Soviet Union by Andrei Gromyko on 10 June 1967, {{the last day of}} the Six-Day War. During the evacuation from the aircraft, Katz was the only passenger to escape through the forward port door, despite the efforts of Hutchinson and Unwin to stop him using that door. The two flight crew were almost carried out through <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>by</b> Katz, who was a large man. Katz was seriously injured jumping from the doorway. He was taken to Hillingdon Hospital, where it was initially feared that he would become the sixth victim of Flight 712. Katz recovered after a few days. He died in 1988 aged 80.|$|E

25|$|Then one day {{he emerged}} from the fort {{with the help of}} villagers, who broke down <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> <b>By</b> this time most had {{expected}} him to have wasted away or to have gone insane in his solitary confinement. Instead, he emerged healthy, serene, and enlightened. Everyone was amazed that he had been through these trials and emerged spiritually rejuvenated. He was hailed as a hero and from this time forth the legend of Anthony began to spread and grow. Anthony went to Fayyum and confirmed the brethren there in the Christian faith before returning to his fort.|$|E
25|$|The group {{played a}} further two shows in Las Vegas {{at the end}} of 2001.

Due to his frustrations with touring, rhythm guitarist Paul Tobias left the band in 2002 and was {{replaced}} by Richard Fortus (formerly of The Psychedelic Furs and Love Spit Love). Fortus is good friends with and had previously collaborated with bassist Tommy Stinson, who recommended him for the position. Producer Roy Thomas Baker was fired in February 2002.

On 29 August 2016, the club agreed a deal with Tottenham to sign Belgian international Nacer Chadli for a club-record transfer fee of £13million. On transfer deadline day, Chadli was joined by the pacey Watford fullback Allan Nyom, who joined for an undisclosed fee believed to be £3million. The last player to join was the unattached Hal Robson-Kanu, who had an impressive Euro 2016 campaign with the Wales national team.|$|E

25|$|In May 1972, two loyalist gunmen {{called to}} the MacBride family's door and Nora MacBride, who was {{carrying}} a baby at the time, went to answer the door. The men duped Mrs. MacBride into opening <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>by</b> stating {{that they were looking}} for Frank, a building contractor, and were seeking work. When the door was opened the gunmen then saw Frank coming down the narrow hallway to see who was at the door. They opened fire shooting Frank in the shoulder, hand and thighs, then Antoine came out from a side room to protect his father and was shot in the leg. Frank MacBride was hit by 12 bullets and never recovered from the attack, dying 17 months later.|$|E
25|$|Hangars {{with open}} {{superstructures}} often attract birds to nest and roost in. Hangar doors are often left open to increase ventilation {{especially in the}} evenings. Birds in hangars are in proximity to the airfield and their droppings are both a health and damage concern. Netting is often deployed across the superstructure of a hangar denying access to the rafters where the birds roost and nest while still allowing the hangar doors to remain open for ventilation and aircraft movements. Strip curtains and door netting may also be used but are subject to improper use (e.g. tying the strips {{to the side of}} <b>the</b> <b>door)</b> <b>by</b> the personnel in the hangar concern (U.S. Air Force 2004, Commander, Naval Installations Command 2010).|$|E
25|$|Banks demanded more {{protection}} and safe makers responded by designing larger, heavier safes. Safes {{with a key}} lock were still vulnerable through the key hole, and bank robbers soon learned to blast off <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>by</b> pouring explosives in this opening. In 1861, inventor Linus Yale Jr. introduced the modern combination lock. Bankers quickly adopted Yale's lock for their safes, but bank robbers came up with several ways {{to get past the}} new invention. It was possible to use force to punch the combination lock through the door. Other experienced burglars learned to drill holes into the lock case and use mirrors to view the slots in the combination wheels inside the mechanism. A more direct approach was to simply kidnap the bank manager and force him to reveal the combination.|$|E

25|$|Bladder traps are {{exclusive}} to the genus Utricularia, or bladderworts. The bladders (vesicula) pump ions {{out of their}} interiors. Water follows by osmosis, generating a partial vacuum inside the bladder. The bladder has a small opening, sealed by a hinged door. In aquatic species, the door has a pair of long trigger hairs. Aquatic invertebrates such as Daphnia touch these hairs and deform <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>by</b> lever action, releasing the vacuum. The invertebrate is sucked into the bladder, where it is digested. Many species of Utricularia (such as U. sandersonii) are terrestrial, growing in waterlogged soil, and their trapping mechanism is triggered {{in a slightly different}} manner. Bladderworts lack roots, but terrestrial species have anchoring stems that resemble roots. Temperate aquatic bladderworts generally die back to a resting turion during the winter months, and U. macrorhiza appears to regulate the number of bladders it bears in response to the prevailing nutrient content of its habitat.|$|E
25|$|All of {{the gods}} were invited to Peleus and Thetis' wedding and brought many gifts, except Eris (the goddess of discord), who was stopped at <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>by</b> Hermes, on Zeus' order. Insulted, she threw from the door a gift of her own: a golden apple (το μήλον της έριδος) on which was inscribed the word καλλίστῃ Kallistēi ("To the fairest"). The apple was claimed by Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite. They quarreled bitterly over it, {{and none of the}} other gods would venture an opinion favoring one, for fear of earning the enmity of the other two. Eventually, Zeus ordered Hermes to lead the three goddesses to Paris, a prince of Troy, who, unaware of his ancestry, was being raised as a {{shepherd}} in Mount Ida, because of a prophecy that he would be the downfall of Troy. After bathing in the spring of Ida, the goddesses appeared to him naked, either for the sake of winning or at Paris' request. Paris was unable to decide between them, so the goddesses resorted to bribes. Athena offered Paris wisdom, skill in battle, and the abilities of the greatest warriors; Hera offered him political power and control of all of Asia; and Aphrodite offered him the love of {{the most beautiful woman in}} the world, Helen of Sparta. Paris awarded the apple to Aphrodite, and, after several adventures, returned to Troy, where he was recognized by his royal family.|$|E

I don't know him!" [...] He slams the door in Landis' face and then bursts {{out of the garage}} in a car. He pulls out onto the street to the strains of the William Tell Overture, gives a manic laugh exactly like D-Day's, and speeds off.|$|E

500|$|Family {{members of}} the {{deceased}} would then reunite in the family home where they would drink more rum and carry out a ritual of purification (faly ranom-bohangy). [...] Lemon or lime leaves and two other herbs were soaked {{in a bowl of}} water, and a family member whose parents were still living would be chosen to sprinkle it on the deceased's possessions, enabling them to be redistributed and reused. <b>The</b> <b>door</b> <b>by</b> which the corpse had been removed was then locked for eight days, during which time the family was required to fast. After completion of this fasting period, the family underwent a purification ritual (afana) and the second door was unlocked. Another feast was observed to formally end the period of community purification. The home of the deceased was then allowed to fall into ruin.|$|E
500|$|Also {{instrumental}} in exposing Eichmann's identity was Lothar Hermann, a half-Jewish German who had emigrated to Argentina in 1938. When in 1956 Hermann's daughter Sylvia began dating {{a man named}} Klaus Eichmann who boasted about his father's Nazi exploits, Hermann alerted Fritz Bauer, prosecutor-general {{of the state of}} Hesse in West Germany. Sylvia, sent on a fact-finding mission, was met at <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>by</b> Eichmann himself, who said he was Klaus's uncle. Informed that Klaus was not home, she sat down to wait. When Klaus returned, he addressed Eichmann as [...] "Father". In 1957 Bauer passed along the information in person to Mossad director Isser Harel, who assigned operatives to undertake surveillance, but no concrete evidence was initially found. On 1 March 1960 Harel dispatched to Buenos Aires the Shin Bet chief interrogator Zvi Aharoni, who over the course of weeks of investigation was able to confirm the identity of the fugitive. As Argentina had a history of turning down extradition requests for Nazi criminals, Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion made the decision that Eichmann should be captured rather than extradited, and brought to Israel for trial. Harel himself arrived in person in May 1960 to oversee the capture. Mossad operative Rafi Eitan was named leader of the eight-man team, most of whom were Shin Bet agents.|$|E
500|$|On 13 May, on {{the final}} day of the season, with QPR {{requiring}} at least a draw in their match away at Manchester City or for Bolton Wanderers to not win in order to guarantee Premier League safety, Barton was sent off in the 55th minute for violent misconduct after elbowing Carlos Tevez in the face. Immediately after being shown a red card, he kicked Sergio Agüero in the back of the knee and attempted to head-butt Vincent Kompany. Barton had to be dragged from the pitch by former teammate Micah Richards as he rowed with Manchester City players and staff and attempted to square-off with striker Mario Balotelli. QPR went on to concede two late goals and lose the match 3–2, but avoided relegation due to Bolton's draw at Stoke City. Barton commented after the match saying that he was trying to [...] "take [...] of their players with me." [...] The FA responded by issuing two charges of violent conduct against him, for the kick and the attempted head-butt, the initial foul already carrying with it a charge of violent conduct. Barton accepted the charge for kicking Agüero but denied the charge for attempting to head-butt Kompany. QPR also began an internal investigation into his behaviour, amid speculation that he would be stripped of the captaincy and fined and possibly shown <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>by</b> the club either by being sold, released on a free transfer or having his contract terminated for gross misconduct.|$|E
