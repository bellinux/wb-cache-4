Joel Schumacher once said of him in 2000, [...] "The bad news is that Philip won't be a $25-million star. <b>The</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> he'll work for the rest of his life". The Aiken Standard of South Carolina referred to him as an [...] "anti-star", whose real identity remained [...] "amorphous and unmoored". Hoffman was acutely aware that he was often too unorthodox for the Academy voters. He remarked, [...] "I'm sure that people in the big corporations that run Hollywood don't know quite what to do with someone like me, but that's OK.

Leia Calderon of Comic Book Resources (CBR) gave it four-out-of-five stars writing, [...] "Overall, Bendis and Coipel's Civil War II #0 serves {{the sole purpose}} of laying out the foundation for the series. Despite being driven almost entirely by dialogue, it's never once boring, and the only real issue is the question on everyone's minds: Where is Iron Man?" [...] Jesse Schedeen of IGN gave it an 8.3 out of 10 saying, [...] "Between the lackluster FCBD Special and Marvel's general track record with major crossovers, there's plenty of reason to worry about Civil War II. But <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> this prologue issue makes a strong case for the upcoming event. It clearly lays out the brewing conflict and makes a strong case for both viewpoints." [...] David Pepose of Newsarama gave it an 8 out of 10 and said, [...] "Minor flaws in the premise aside, Bendis and Coipel deliver some surprisingly charming work with Civil War II #0, which — at least thus far — doesn't feel like the shameless cash-in that you might expect from this summer event sequel." ...|$|E

[...] McAlpine concluded his review, writing, [...] "You can almost hear the paparazzi cameras going off as she's singing. [...] Of course, the only thing she has to worry about now is that having made this very public declaration, if she slips up for a second, we'll all be watching..." [...] Judy Coleman of The Boston Globe said that Lovato shows [...] "her Gen-Y stripes", and [...] "forcibly rhymes 'everything's the same' with 'the La-La land machine' – pronounced, of course,' ma-SHAYN'." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic noted it {{as one of the best}} tracks on Don't Forget. Ed Masley of The Arizona Republic included [...] "La La Land" [...] at number eight on his [...] "Top 10 from the Disney girls" [...] list, and wrote, [...] "Are Disney girls just naturally plagued by insecurity or is it all a plot to seem more real?

2500|$|The {{hydrologist}} Peter Gleick comments: [...] "Few rational observers {{deny the}} need for boundaries to freshwater use. More controversial is defining where those limits are or what steps to take to constrain ourselves within them. Another way to describe these boundaries {{is the concept of}} peak water. Three different ideas are useful. 'Peak renewable' water limits are the total renewable flows in a watershed. Many of the world’s major rivers are already approaching this threshold—when evaporation and consumption surpass natural replenishment from precipitation and other sources. 'Peak nonrenewable' limits apply where human use of water far exceeds natural recharge rates, such as in fossil groundwater basins of the Great Plains, Libya, India, northern China and parts of California’s Central Valley. 'Peak ecological' water is the idea that for any hydrological system, increasing withdrawals eventually reach the point where any additional economic benefit of taking the water is outweighed by the additional ecological destruction that causes. Although it is difficult to quantify this point accurately, we have clearly passed the point of peak ecological water in many basins around the world where huge damage has occurred [...] <b>The</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the potential for savings, without hurting human health or economic productivity, is vast. Improvements in water-use efficiency are possible in every sector. More food can be grown with less water (and less water contamination) by shifting from conventional flood irrigation to drip and precision sprinklers, along with more accurately monitoring and managing soil moisture. Conventional power plants can change from water cooling to dry cooling, and more energy can be generated by sources that use extremely little water, such as photovoltaics and wind." ...|$|E

40|$|Is {{it always}} wise to boast about <b>good</b> <b>news?</b> When {{messages}} <b>are</b> verifiable, the standard result from disclosure games <b>is</b> that <b>good</b> <b>news</b> should <b>be</b> disclosed or the receiver will infer that the sender has nothing favorable to report. We reconsider this conclusion when the receiver has private information about sender type. Because better senders expect {{the receiver to}} have more favorable private information about them, {{we find that the}} worst sender type with <b>good</b> <b>news</b> has <b>the</b> most incentive to disclose it. Therefore reporting <b>good</b> <b>news</b> can paradoxically make an unfavorable impression. If <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> <b>is</b> sufficiently rare a unique disclosure equilibrium exists in which <b>good</b> <b>news</b> <b>is</b> disclosed. But if <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> <b>is</b> attainable even by mediocre types then two understatement equilibria always exist: a nondisclosure equilibrium in which all types withhold <b>good</b> <b>news</b> and a countersignaling equilibrium in which mediocre types report <b>good</b> <b>news</b> but <b>the</b> best types withhold it. When such equilibria exist, the sender has a legitimate fear of looking overly eager to reveal <b>good</b> <b>news.</b> Having a third party disclose the news, or mandating that the sender disclose the news, eliminates this problem...|$|R
