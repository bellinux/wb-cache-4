5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the dynasty (c. 965) the two Zhe provinces (now Zhejiang and southern Jiangsu) presented (to the throne) two dragon ships each more than (60.00m/200ft) in length. The upper works included several decks with palatial cabins and saloons, containing thrones and couches all ready for imperial tours of inspection. After many years, their hulls decayed and needed repairs, but the work was impossible {{as long as they were}} afloat. So in the Xi-Ning reign period (1068 to 1077) a palace official Huang Huaixin suggested a plan. A large basin was excavated at the north end of the Jinming Lake capable of containing the dragon ships, and in it heavy crosswise beams were laid down upon a foundation of pillars. Then (a breach was made) so that the basin quickly filled with water, after which the ships were towed in above <b>the</b> <b>beams.</b> The (breach now being closed) the water was pumped out by wheels so that the ships rested quite in the air. When the repairs were complete, the water was let in again, so that the ships were afloat once more (and could leave the dock). Finally <b>the</b> <b>beams</b> and pillars were taken away, and the whole basin covered over with a great roof so as to form a hangar in which the ships could be protected from the elements and avoid the damage caused by undue exposure.|$|E
5|$|Pilots {{noted that}} in a crosswind, {{the nose of the}} plane would not point {{directly}} at the enemy, but could be, say, 20 degrees off, to compensate for the wind. Since making <b>the</b> <b>beams</b> bright enough at such a wide angle was impracticable, pilots were instructed to fly on the curving approach path which keeps the nose pointed towards the enemy at all times, rather than a straight-line path with the nose pointed upwind.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} the name of the pub is unclear, but one {{reported}} theory is that it was named after the 17th-century warship HMS Royal Oak, which was sunk at the nearby Raid on the Medway in 1664. Local people say that one of <b>the</b> <b>beams</b> in the pub comes from the ship, the remains of which may have been broken up at a nearby shipyard after the battle. Another theory is that it was named after the Royal Oak that Charles II of England hid in following the Battle of Worcester.|$|E
40|$|A {{method and}} {{apparatus}} are provided {{for determining the}} strain developed in a coated surface. A beam with a coating on a surface thereof is mounted as a cantilever and a {{force is applied to}} the free end of <b>the</b> <b>beam</b> to cause deflection of <b>the</b> <b>beam</b> until <b>the</b> coating on <b>the</b> <b>beam</b> fails. <b>The</b> strain in <b>the</b> <b>beam,</b> and hence in the coating at the point of failure, is determined based on the dimensions of <b>the</b> <b>beam,</b> <b>the</b> point along <b>the</b> <b>beam</b> where failure of the coating occurs and the amount of deflection of <b>the</b> <b>beam,</b> and this determination is made independently of the temperature of <b>the</b> <b>beam</b> and <b>the</b> material from which <b>the</b> <b>beam</b> is made. <b>The</b> determination is made based on the equation E= 1. 5 hdx/l(exp 3), where E is strain, h is <b>the</b> <b>beam</b> thickness, d is <b>the</b> <b>beam</b> deflection, x is the distance from the free end of <b>the</b> <b>beam</b> to <b>the</b> point where failure of the coating occurred, and l is the length of <b>the</b> <b>beam...</b>|$|R

5|$|VAT {{delivered}} {{its first}} mid-engined bus chassis to Ajokki Oy coach works in April 1958. It was {{powered by a}} horizontally mounted 164-hp AEC diesel engine. The end customer was bus operator Väinö Paunu Oy, which also participated in the development work. In 1960, VAT introduced the VLK500 chassis with air suspension and dual-circuit air brakes. VAT returned to building rear-engined buses in 1966–67, but sales did not reach {{the level of the}} mid- and front-engined models. The company conducted a number of experiments with the construction; one example was a bus with a frameless structure in which <b>the</b> <b>beams</b> were replaced by a lighter solution.|$|E
5|$|By February 26 city {{officials}} had determined One Meridian Plaza {{was not in}} danger of collapse. There was structural damage to horizontal steel beams and floor sections {{on most of the}} fire damaged floors. Under extreme fire exposure <b>the</b> <b>beams</b> and girders sagged and twisted and cracks appeared in the concrete floors. However, the overall structure was stable and able to support the weight of the building. Thermal expansion of the steel frame caused some of the granite panels to be dislodged from the building's facade. The streets and buildings around One Meridian Plaza were closed and cordoned off. The 20-story Morris Building and several three-story shops behind One Meridian Plaza on Chestnut Street were damaged by falling debris and sat unused for years until they were demolished in 2000. The neighboring Girard Trust Building, then called Two Mellon Plaza, experienced extensive water damage forcing the closure of the building. A bank in the building reopened a month later {{but the rest of the}} tower remained vacant for years. The roads around the building were closed for months after the fire, including a portion of two of Philadelphia's major streets, Broad and Market.|$|E
5|$|The first {{renovation}} in the 20thcentury {{occurred in}} 1922, when the Supreme Muslim Council under Amin al-Husayni (the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem) commissioned Turkish architect Ahmet Kemalettin Bey to restore al-Aqsa Mosque and the monuments in its precincts. The council also commissioned British architects, Egyptian engineering experts {{and local officials}} to contribute to and oversee the repairs and additions which were carried out in 1924–25 by Kemalettin. The renovations included reinforcing the mosque's ancient Umayyad foundations, rectifying the interior columns, replacing <b>the</b> <b>beams,</b> erecting a scaffolding, conserving the arches and drum of the main dome's interior, rebuilding the southern wall, and replacing timber in the central nave with a slab of concrete. The renovations also revealed Fatimid-era mosaics and inscriptions on the interior arches that had been covered with plasterwork. The arches were decorated with gold and green-tinted gypsum and their timber tie beams were replaced with brass. A quarter of the stained glass windows also were carefully renewed so as to preserve their original Abbasid and Fatimid designs. Severe damage {{was caused by the}} 1837 and 1927 earthquakes, but the mosque was repaired in 1938 and 1942.|$|E

5|$|There {{are many}} myths {{regarding}} {{the construction of}} the Faidherbe Bridge which are present even today and are depicted in some tourist guides. The construction of the bridge is attributed to Gustave Eiffel. In general it says that the metallic parts of the bridge represents a gift from the French government and that the parts were originally designed for the King Carol I Bridge over the Danube River in Romania. Other sources say that the metallic parts were intended for a bridge in Austria–Hungary over the Danube River in Vienna or Budapest. Finally another myth regarding <b>the</b> <b>beams</b> of the bridge says that the parts were intended for an unspecified site but the vessel transporting mysteriously sunk and the authorities in Senegal took advantage of this situation and built a local bridge.|$|E
5|$|To {{overcome}} these challenges, researchers have employed various solutions. Astronomical interferometry, first conceived by Hippolyte Fizeau in 1868, was the seminal concept that has enabled major improvements in modern telescopy {{and led to}} the creation of the Michelson interferometer in the 1880s, and the first successful measurement of Betelgeuse. Just as human depth perception increases when two eyes instead of one perceive an object, Fizeau proposed the observation of stars through two apertures instead of one to obtain interferences that would furnish information on the star's spatial intensity distribution. The science evolved quickly and multiple-aperture interferometers are now used to capture speckled images, which are synthesized using Fourier analysis to produce a portrait of high resolution. It was this methodology that identified the hotspots on Betelgeuse in the 1990s. Other technological breakthroughs include adaptive optics, space observatories like Hipparcos, Hubble and Spitzer, and the Astronomical Multi-BEam Recombiner (AMBER), which combines <b>the</b> <b>beams</b> of three telescopes simultaneously, allowing researchers to achieve milliarcsecond spatial resolution.|$|E
5|$|In New Jersey, Doria {{produced}} wind {{gusts of}} up to 54mph (87km/h) and storm tides 5.3feet (1.6m) above normal in Atlantic City. The outer bands of the storm spawned an F2 tornado near Cape May. It moved quickly northward through Cape May County, and caused about $250,000 in damage (1971USD, $ USD) in damage along its 29-mile (47km) path. The storm dropped heavy rainfall, peaking at 10.29inches (261mm) in Little Falls. Record 24-hour rainfall totals occurred in Newark with 7.84inches (199mm) and Trenton with 7.55inches (192mm). The rainfall led to record flooding on several small streams in the state. The Beden Brook crested at over 5feet (1.5m) above normal, which destroyed a bridge near Princeton. The Raritan River at Manville crested at 9.8feet (3m), a record that stood until the passage of Hurricane Floyd in 1999. The heavy rainfall overtopped the levee system in Zarephath, causing severe damage to the Alma White College and preventing it from opening {{in the fall of}} 1971. The rainfall also flooded two fire houses in Somerville with several feet of water, and the water treatment plant in Bridgewater Township with 18inches (457mm) of floodwaters in what was catalogued as a 50-year flood event. Following the flooding to the water treatment plant, officials raised <b>the</b> <b>beams</b> of the plant to withstand a 500-year flood event. Eleven houses experienced flooding damage in Montgomery Township. Doria killed three people and caused $138million in damage (1971USD) in the state.|$|E
50|$|A beam is a {{structural}} element that primarily resists loads applied laterally to <b>the</b> <b>beam's</b> axis. Its mode of deflection is primarily by bending.

40|$|Injections of nonrelativistic {{electron}} beams from {{a finite}} equipotential conductor into an ionospheric plasma have been simulated using a two-dimensional electrostatic particle code. The {{purpose of the}} study is to survey the simulation parameters for understanding <b>the</b> dependence of <b>beam</b> radius on physical variables. The conductor is charged to a high potential when the background plasma density is less than <b>the</b> <b>beam</b> density. Beam electrons attracted by the charged conductor are decelerated to zero velocity near the stagnation point, which is at a few Debye lengths from the conductor. The simulations suggest that <b>the</b> <b>beam</b> electrons at <b>the</b> stagnation point receive a large transverse kick and <b>the</b> <b>beam</b> expands radially thereafter. <b>The</b> buildup of <b>beam</b> electrons at <b>the</b> stagnation point produces a large electrostatic force responsible for the transverse kick. However, for the weak charging cases where the background plasma density is larger than <b>the</b> <b>beam</b> density, <b>the</b> radial expansion mechanism is different; <b>the</b> <b>beam</b> plasma instability is found to be responsible for the radial expansion. The simulations show that <b>the</b> electron <b>beam</b> radius for high spacecraft charging cases is of the order of <b>the</b> <b>beam</b> gyroradius, defined as <b>the</b> <b>beam</b> velocity divided by the gyrofrequency. In the weak charging cases, <b>the</b> <b>beam</b> radius is only a fraction of <b>the</b> <b>beam</b> gyroradius. <b>The</b> parameter survey indicates that <b>the</b> <b>beam</b> radius increases with beam density and decreases with magnetic field and <b>beam</b> velocity. <b>The</b> <b>beam</b> radius normalized by <b>the</b> <b>beam</b> gyroradius is found to scale according to the ratio of <b>the</b> <b>beam</b> electron Debye length to the ambient electron Debye length.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>beam</b> {{divergence}} of a {{laser beam}} is a measure for how fast <b>the</b> <b>beam</b> expands far from <b>the</b> <b>beam</b> waist. It is usually defined as the derivative of <b>the</b> <b>beam</b> radius {{with respect to the}} axial position in the far field, i.e., in a distance from <b>the</b> <b>beam</b> waist which is much larger than the Rayleigh length. This definition yields a divergence half-angle. (Sometimes, full angles are used in the literature; these are twice as large.) For a diffraction-limited Gaussian <b>beam,</b> <b>the</b> <b>beam</b> divergence is λ/(πw0), where λ is the wavelength (in the medium) and w0 <b>the</b> <b>beam</b> radius (radius with 1/e2 intensity) at <b>the</b> <b>beam</b> waist. A large beam divergence for a given beam radius corresponds to poor beam quality. A low beam divergence can be important for applications such as pointing or free-space optical communications. Beams with very small divergence, i.e., with approximately constant beam radius over significant propagation distances, are called collimated <b>beams.</b> For <b>the</b> measurement of <b>beam</b> divergence, one usually measures <b>the</b> <b>beam</b> radius at different positions, using e.g. a beam profiler. It is also possible to derive <b>the</b> <b>beam</b> divergence from <b>the</b> complex amplitude profile of <b>the</b> <b>beam</b> in a single plane: spatial Fourier transforms deliver the distribution of transverse spatial frequencies, which are directly related to propagation angles.
