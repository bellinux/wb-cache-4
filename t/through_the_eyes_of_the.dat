25|$|The “master” of period-dramas was {{undoubtedly}} Ernst Lubitsch. His most notable films of this genre were Madame DuBarry (1919) which portrayed the French revolution <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> King of France’s mistress, {{and the film}} Anna Boleyn (1920) on the tragic end of King Henry VIII’s second wife. In these films, Lubitsch presented prominent historic personalities who are caught up by their weaknesses and petty urges and thus, ironically, become responsible for huge historical events. Despite modest budgets, his films included extravagant scenes which were meant {{to appeal to a}} wide audience and insure a wide international distribution.|$|E
25|$|Many {{references}} to the event were made in later novels and films. Julian Rathbone describes the brutality of both British and Indian forces during the siege of Cawnpore in his novel The Mutiny. In the novel, the Indian nurse Lavanya rescues an English child, Stephen, during the Satichaura Ghat massacre. In Massacre at Cawnpore, V. A. Stuart describes the siege and the British defence <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> characters Sheridan, and his wife Emmy. George MacDonald Fraser's Flashman in the Great Game also contains lengthy scenes set in the entrenchment during the siege and also during the ensuing escape.|$|E
25|$|Carpentier's El reino de este mundo (1949) {{highlights}} the Haitian Revolution of the 18th century when the African slaves fought the French colonists for their freedom and basic human rights. The novel combines not only historical references {{of the event}} with aspects of African faith and rituals, most notably Haitian vodou; but also the connections between corporeal and spiritual self. The story is seen <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> protagonist Ti Noël, a black slave. Being a white, European/Cuban writer who published {{on the subject of}} the Haitian Revolution, it has been implied that Carpentier chose to write from Ti Noël's point of view so that he would avoid being criticized for any racial stereotyping. Carpentier incorporates symbolic architecture throughout the novel; representing the dictatorship of colonial rule with structures such as the Sans-Souci Palace and the fortress of La Ferrière.|$|E

25|$|Equivalent to France. It {{is located}} on the southeastern section of Derlavai. Its people are {{descendants}} of the ancient Kaunian Empire and as such are slim, blonde and blue-eyed and their dress is typically trousers and tunics. Valmiera was one of the states which declared war on Algarve {{in the first year of}} the war. The Algarvian offensive in the spring of the second year led to the defeat and occupation of the country. Activities of the Valmieran Resistance under the occupation, seen <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> character Skarnu, are closely equivalent to the French Resistance in World War II, while the collaboration of most nobles and the Valmieran police with the occupiers resembles the Vichy regime. Kuusaian and Lagoan victors give the Valmierans a share in the spoils after the war is over. Valmiera's capital is Priekule, describes as a center of high culture.|$|E
25|$|Empathy {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} aspects of humanistic therapy. This idea focuses on the therapist’s ability to see the world <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> client. Without this, therapists can be forced to apply an external frame of reference where the therapist is no longer understanding the actions and thoughts of the client as the client would, but strictly as a therapist which defeats the purpose of humanistic therapy. Included in empathizing, unconditional positive regard {{is one of the}} key elements of humanistic psychology. Unconditional positive regard refers to the care that the therapist needs to have for the client. This ensures that the therapist does not become the authority figure in the relationship allowing for a more open flow of information as well as a kinder relationship between the two. A therapist practicing humanistic therapy needs to show a willingness to listen and ensure the comfort of the patient where genuine feelings may be shared but are not forced upon someone. Marshall Rosenberg, one of Carl Rogers' students, emphasizes empathy in the relationship in his concept of Nonviolent Communication.|$|E
