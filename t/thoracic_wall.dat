25|$|The scapula is a wide, flat bone {{lying on}} the <b>thoracic</b> <b>wall</b> that {{provides}} an attachment for three different groups of muscles. The intrinsic muscles of the scapula include {{the muscles of the}} rotator cuff—the subscapularis, teres minor, supraspinatus, and infraspinatus. These muscles attach {{to the surface of the}} scapula and are responsible for the internal and external rotation of the shoulder joint, along with humeral abduction. The extrinsic muscles include the biceps, triceps, and deltoid muscles and attach to the coracoid process and supraglenoid tubercle of the scapula, infraglenoid tubercle of the scapula, and spine of the scapula. These muscles are responsible for several actions of the glenohumeral joint. The third group, which is mainly responsible for stabilization and rotation of the scapula, consists of the trapezius, serratus anterior, levator scapulae, and rhomboid muscles and attach to the medial, superior, and inferior borders of the scapula.|$|E
500|$|The {{muscles that}} control flight in insects {{can take up}} to 10% to 30% of the total body mass. The muscles that control flight vary with the two types of flight found in insects: {{indirect}} and direct. Insects that use first, indirect, have the muscles attach to the tergum instead of the wings, as the name suggests. As the muscles contract, the thoracic box becomes distorted, transferring the energy to the wing. There are two [...] "bundles" [...] of muscles, those that span parallel to the tergum, the dorsolongitudinals, and those that are attached to the tegum and extend to the sternum, the dorsoventrals. In direct muscle, the connection is directly from the pleuron (<b>thoracic</b> <b>wall)</b> to individual sclerites located {{at the base of the}} wing. The subalar and basalar muscles have ligament attachments to the subalar and basalar sclerites. Here resilin, a highly elastic material, forms the ligaments connecting flight muscles to the wing apparatus.|$|E

6000|$|Section 41. The {{mechanism}} of respiration will {{be understood by}} reference to Figure 3, Sheet 2. It will be noted, in dissecting that the lungs have shrunk away from {{the walls of the}} thorax; this collapse occurs directly an aperture is made in the thorax wall, and is in part due to their extreme elasticity. In life the cavity of the thorax forms an air-tight box, between which and the lungs is a slight space, the pleural cavity (pl.c.) lined by a moist membrane, which is also reflected, over the lungs. The thorax wall is muscular and bony, and resists the atmospheric pressure on its outer side, so that the lungs before this is cut through are kept distended {{to the size of the}} thoracic cavity by the pressure of the air within them. In inspiration (or breathing-in) the ribs are raised by the external intercostal (Anglice, between-ribs, e.i.c.m.) and other allied muscles, and the diaphragm (dia.) contracts and becomes flatter; the air is consequently sucked, in as the lungs follow the movement of the thorax wall. In expiration the intercostals and diaphragm relax and allow the elastic recoil of the lungs to come into play. The <b>thoracic</b> <b>wall</b> is simultaneously depressed by the muscles of the abdominal area, the diaphragm thrust forwards, as the result of the displacement and compression of the alimentary viscera thus brought about.

30|$|Ultrasound-guided serratus plane {{injection}} {{was performed}} {{at the level of}} the fourth rib on the mid-axillary line in nine adult Thiel-embalmed cadavers. In each cadaver, one side was injected with 20  ml of methylene blue dye and the contralateral side with 40  ml. Dissections of the <b>thoracic</b> <b>walls</b> were performed 20  min after the injection. The spread of the dye to intercostal nerves, lateral and medial pectoral nerves, long thoracic nerve, and thoracodorsal nerves was assessed. All T 2 –T 5 intercostal nerves in the 40 -ml group and all T 3 –T 4 nerves in the 20 -ml group were stained with the dye. A larger number of intercostal nerves was stained in the 40 -ml group than that in the 20 -ml group. Medial and lateral pectoral nerves were not frequently stained in either group.|$|R
40|$|AbstractMidline defects {{account for}} {{approximately}} 5 % of congenital abnormalities observed at birth. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying {{the formation of}} the ventral body wall are not well understood. Recent studies linked mutations in Porcupine—an O-acetyl transferase mediating Wnt ligand acylation—with defects in the <b>thoracic</b> body <b>wall.</b> We hypothesized that anomalous Wnt signaling is involved in the pathogenesis of defective closure of the <b>thoracic</b> body <b>wall.</b> We generated a mouse model wherein Wntless (Wls), which encodes a cargo receptor mediating secretion of Wnt ligands, was conditionally deleted from the developing mesenchyme using Dermo 1 Cre mice. Wlsf/f;Dermo 1 Cre/+ embryos died during mid-gestation. At E 13. 5, skeletal defects were observed in the forelimbs, jaw, and rib cage. At E 14. 5, midline defects in the <b>thoracic</b> body <b>wall</b> began to emerge: the sternum failed to fuse and the heart protruded through the body wall at the midline (ectopia cordis). To determine the molecular mechanism underlying the phenotype observed in Wlsf/f;Dermo 1 Cre/+ embryos, we tested whether Wnt/β-catenin signaling was operative in developing the embryonic ventral body wall using Axin 2 LacZ and BatGal reporter mice. While Wnt/β-catenin signaling activity was observed at the midline of the ventral body wall before sternal fusion, this pattern of activity was altered and scattered throughout the body wall after mesenchymal deletion of Wls. Mesenchymal cell migration was disrupted in Wlsf/f;Dermo 1 Cre/+ <b>thoracic</b> body <b>wall</b> partially due to anomalous β-catenin independent Wnt signaling as determined by in vitro assays. Deletion of Lrp 5 and Lrp 6 receptors, which mediate Wnt/β-catenin signaling in the mesenchyme, partially recapitulated the phenotype observed in the chest midline of Wlsf/f;Dermo 1 Cre/+ embryos supporting a role for Wnt/β-catenin signaling activity in the normal formation of the ventral body wall mesenchyme. We conclude that Wls-mediated secretion of Wnt ligands from the developing ventral body wall mesenchyme plays a critical role in fusion of the sternum and closure of the secondary body wall. Thus, impaired Wls activity in the ventral body wall mesenchyme is a mechanism underlying ectopia cordis and unfused sternum...|$|R

40|$|A 7 -month-old-intact male {{domestic}} shorthair cat {{was presented with}} fever, anterior uveitis in the right eye and respiratory distress when handled. These signs along with mild changes in serum protein levels and the exclusion of other potential causes were suggestive of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). As the disease progressed, more clinical signs consistent with FIP, including renal involvement and later pleural effusion, became evident. Non-pruritic cutaneous lesions, characterized by slightly raised intradermal papules over the dorsal neck and over both lateral <b>thoracic</b> <b>walls,</b> were recognized at the end stage of the disease. The identification of papules in well-haired skin was difficult, and clipping of the fur facilitated their detection.
