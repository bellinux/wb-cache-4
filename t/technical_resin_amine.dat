40|$|Introduction: Polymeric hydrogels {{are soft}} {{materials}} with a network structure that retain {{large amounts of}} water and have found widespread application in different technological areas. Amphiphilic hydrogels contain both hydrophilic and hydrophobic segments and are presently investigated for instance as devices for controlled release of pharmacological substances or biomaterials in tissue engineering. The development of amphiphilic hydrogels for a specific application requires the attainment of the most appropriate balance between hydrophobic and hydrophilic moieties, network cross-link density, and swelling degree. In the present work the versatility of epoxy resins chemistry was exploited to tune such parameters. Materials and methods: Several epoxy networks were synthesized by changing the hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity of the monomers (epoxy <b>resins</b> and <b>amines)</b> and/or their ratio in the reaction mixture. For all hydrogels the room temperature equilibrium swelling ratio in 0. 1 M NaCl was determined.

Recently, {{the advent of a}} new chain extender, diethyltolu-enediamine (DETDA), provided another class of commercially useful RIM elas-tomers. These materials are best classified as polyurethane/urea elastomers. We have been working on the next logical step in this evolution: amine-terminated polyether <b>resins</b> with <b>amine</b> chain extenders. These are best classi-fied as polyurea elastomers. Amine-terminated polyether resins, or polyether polyamines, can replace the polyol in a RIM formulation. These materials are much more reactive than pol-yols, and their composition can be varied more easily than conventional RIM polyols. Thus, these products can be tailored to meet the performance require-ments of a particular end use more easily than polyols. The use of amine-terminated polyether products in RIM applications brings a new dimension to the RIM process. Depending on the choice of amine termi-nated polyether amine, one can formulate systems covering a broad range of properties from elastomeric materials to rigid materials. Elastomeric materials are made by having a small amount of hard segment in a block-copolymer in conjunction with a polyether diamine.
