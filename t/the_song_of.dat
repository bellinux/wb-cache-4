5|$|In his History of Animals, Aristotle {{considered}} that the garden warbler eventually metamorphosed into a blackcap. The composer Olivier Messiaen used <b>the</b> <b>song</b> <b>of</b> the garden warbler {{as the basis}} for his 1971 solo piano piece La fauvette des jardins, the title being the French name of the species. His Turangalîla-Symphonie, a major work inspired by the legend of Tristan and Iseult, has a summer garden scene as its sixth movement. This features <b>the</b> <b>song</b> <b>of</b> the warbler, along with those of the nightingale and blackbird.|$|E

5|$|Males’ {{differential}} {{recognition of}} local and nonlocal songs has been studied in two populations: one in the northern United States (New Hampshire) {{and the other in}} the southern United States (North Carolina). An asymmetry of response has been found between the two populations. The northern black-throated blue warbler responds strongly to local songs but relatively weakly to <b>the</b> <b>song</b> <b>of</b> southern warblers. In contrast, a warbler from the south responds equally to songs from both the north and the south. A potential explanation of this asymmetry is the difference in female preference between the northern and southern black-throated blue warblers. Females from the north are less likely to mate with a “heterospecific” male from the south; therefore it is not necessary for a northern male to respond strongly to <b>the</b> <b>song</b> <b>of</b> a southern challenger. It is possible that a barrier to gene flow from south to north exists while a barrier to the reverse does not. Therefore, female choice of male songs is likely {{to play a role in}} gene flow and reproductive isolation, which may eventually lead to diversification.|$|E

5|$|Martin also {{directly}} and indirectly contributed to the main themes of three films in the James Bond series.

5|$|Related to {{this use}} of resonance, Messiaen also {{composed}} music in which the lowest, or fundamental, note is combined with higher notes or chords played much more quietly. These higher notes, far from being perceived as conventional harmony, function as harmonics that alter the timbre of the fundamental note like mixture stops on a pipe organ. An example is <b>the</b> <b>song</b> <b>of</b> the golden oriole in Le loriot of the Catalogue d'oiseaux for solo piano (Example 4).|$|E

5|$|The {{breeding}} season is {{during the summer}} rainy season (mainly June to August in India) but can vary.

5|$|According to the French Byzantinist Henri Grégoire, the Byzantine success {{against the}} Arabs that culminated with the Battle of Lalakaon {{inspired}} {{the creation of}} one of the oldest surviving acritic (heroic) poems: <b>the</b> <b>Song</b> <b>of</b> Armouris. Grégoire claimed that the eponymous protagonist, the young Byzantine warrior Armouris, was actually inspired by Emperor Michael III. A battle from the Byzantine heroic cycle around Digenis Akritas also strongly recalls the events of Lalakaon, as the eponymous hero surrounds an Arab army near Malakopeia. Strong influences can be found in episodes in the Arab, and later Turkish, epic cycles around Battal Ghazi, as well as an episode in the One Thousand and One Nights.|$|E
5|$|Accusing <b>the</b> <b>Song</b> <b>of</b> {{violating the}} {{agreement}} and realizing {{the weakness of}} the Song, the Jin generals launched a second punitive campaign, again dividing their troops into two armies. Wanyan Zonghan, who had withdrawn from Taiyuan after the Kaifeng agreement and left a small force in charge of the siege, came back with his western army. Overwhelmed, Taiyuan fell in September 1126, after 260 days of siege. When the Song court received news of the fall of Taiyuan, the officials who had advocated defending the empire militarily fell from favor again and were replaced by counselors who favored appeasement. In mid December the two Jurchen armies converged on Kaifeng for the second time that year.|$|E
