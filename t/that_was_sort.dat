500|$|In February 1999, Jimmy Eat World {{released}} {{their third}} studio album, Clarity, through Capitol Records. The label started to shelve the album {{until a few}} key radio stations started playing the song [...] "Lucky Denver Mint." [...] After Capitol Records decided not to release their next major-label album, the band left the label. At that time, Jimmy Eat World distributed their albums independently while on tour in Europe. Drummer Zach Lind recalled that the label [...] "really didn’t believe in us. But in a way, <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>sort</b> of a good thing, because it let us take control of what we needed to do. We learned {{we had to do}} it ourselves, because no one else would do it for us." ...|$|E
500|$|Gunn {{revealed}} that character introductions were the [...] "hardest scenes to crack", with Thanos' introduction {{being the most}} difficult. He felt that [...] "having Thanos be in that scene was more helpful to the [...] {{than it was to}} Guardians of the Galaxy," [...] yet he still wanted Thanos in the film, without [...] " [...] the actual antagonist of the film, which is Ronan." [...] To solve his dilemma, Gunn chose to have Ronan kill [...] "The Other", Thanos' vizier, saying, [...] "I thought that was interesting, because we’ve had the Other, who’s obviously very powerful even in comparison to Loki, and then we see Ronan wipe his ass with him. So that I liked, but even <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>sort</b> of difficult, because it played as funnier when I first wrote it, and the humor didn’t work so much." ...|$|E
500|$|Schwab has said, [...] "I don't want to {{be known}} or remembered as a {{positive}} band, but as a band <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>sort</b> of honest and had a quiet sense of hope." [...] He has sometimes used humor to convey his feelings. [...] "Salem's Suburbs" [...] and [...] "Your Heroes Are Dead" [...] examine how society blindly accepts opinions found on television and the internet. [...] "Caveman Jams" [...] was directed at critics who claimed their music was too aggressive. The song tells how a fan was inspired to leave a life of self-destruction. [...] "That song was written to be funny," [...] said Schwab, [...] " [...] was definitely written as a response to some experiences we've had as a band over the years, but {{in such a way that}} we're having fun with it. I tried to approach it comically." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{abandoning the}} soundtrack album, Bowie went on tour {{in support of}} Station to Station, commencing 2 February 1976 and {{completing}} on 18 May 1976. Kraftwerk's [...] "Radioactivity" [...] was employed as an overture to the shows, accompanying footage from Luis Buñuel's and Salvador Dalí's surrealist film Un Chien Andalou. The staging featured Bowie, dressed in the Duke's habitual black waistcoat and trousers, a pack of Gitanes placed ostentatiously in his pocket, moving stiffly among [...] "curtains of white light", an effect that spawned the nickname 'the White Light Tour'. In 1989 Bowie reflected, [...] "I {{wanted to go back}} to a kind of Expressionist German-film look... and the lighting of, say, Fritz Lang or Pabst. A black-and-white movies look, but with an intensity <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>sort</b> of aggressive. I think for me, personally, theatrically, that was the most successful tour I've ever done." [...] The Station to Station tour was the source of one of the artist's best-known bootlegs, culled from an FM radio broadcast of his 23 March 1976 concert at Nassau Coliseum. A live album was officially released years later.|$|E
500|$|... "The song {{has kind}} of an old school vibe to it, {{so we wanted to}} be really {{stripped}} down and really simple with the video. Every time we get the chance to work together I always try to do something a little different, you know. I hadn't seen her a do a real stripped down, really basic video. I got a taste of it when I did another video with her where she was a guest star, and I got her really stripped down in that but it was still in a Jamaican environment. I just wanted to put her in a really contemporary American environment and bring out the emotions in the song and the bittersweetness of it. Me and her were just vibing off that, and thought it would be really fun to do something just really simple. No visual effects, no gags. The whole strength of the video is on just the honesty of the piece, and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>sort</b> of what we set out to do. Sometimes it's an important visual effect, today it's an important emotion." ...|$|E
2500|$|One of the marvellous {{things about}} John Bonham which made things very easy [...] {{was the fact}} that he really knew how to tune his drums, and I tell you what, that was pretty rare in drummers in those days. He really knew how to make the {{instrument}} sing, and because of that, he could just get so much volume out of it by just playing with his wrists. It was just an astonishing technique <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>sort</b> of pretty holistic if you know what I mean.|$|E

2500|$|Gaskarth {{mentioned}} {{how they}} {{went from being}} one of the biggest groups on a label who had a small amount staff and could provide their complete attention, to a major label [...] "and we're definitely not the biggest fish in that pond. There's a lot going on, it takes a little bit longer to get things done and get things moving." [...] He added that the band thought they [...] "hit a ceiling" [...] with Hopeless Records since [...] "trying to tackle things like getting radio [...] and things like <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>sort</b> of becoming harder and harder {{based on the fact that}} the label hadn’t really done it before." [...] In December, the band began writing for their next album. The band demoed around 20 songs for inclusion on their next album before whittling the number down, with the aim of recording 15 or 16 of them. After touring in Australia as part of the Soundwave festival in February and March 2010, Gaskarth spent time writing new material in Los Angeles.|$|E
60|$|Pap was agoing on so {{he never}} noticed where his old limber legs was taking him to, {{so he went}} head over heels over the tub of salt pork and barked both shins, {{and the rest of}} his speech was all the hottest kind of language--mostly hove at the nigger and the govment, though he give the tub some, too, all along, here and there. He hopped around the cabin considerable, first on one leg and then on the other, holding first one shin and then the other one, and at last he let out with his left foot all of a sudden and fetched the tub a {{rattling}} kick. But it warn't good judgment, because that was the boot that had a couple of his toes leaking out of the front end of it; so now he raised a howl that fairly made a body's hair raise, and down he went in the dirt, and rolled there, and held his toes; and the cussing he done then laid over anything he had ever done previous. He said so his own self afterwards. He had heard old Sowberry Hagan in his best days, and he said it laid over him, too; but I reckon <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>sort</b> of piling it on, maybe.|$|E
