25|$|Bottas {{entered the}} pit lane on lap eleven with Vettel, Alonso and Ricciardo doing {{likewise}} {{on the next}} lap. After Kvyat made his stop, he rejoined behind Rosberg but overtook him shortly after. Hamilton made his pit stop from the lead on lap 14, and emerged back in first, narrowly ahead of Button. Rosberg was informed over the radio {{that he could not}} go beyond 6,500 revolutions per minute in first gear because his pit lane limiter was faulty. He drove slowly into the pit lane on lap 14 and purposely stalled his car as his tyres and steering wheel were changed. Mechanics switched his car off and Rosberg selected multiple buttons on his steering wheel in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>gear.</b> After being stationary for nearly two minutes, Rosberg's car was pushed back into his garage and retired. Massa overtook Pérez for sixth place on the 15th lap, and Vergne was handed a five-second stop-and-go penalty on the next lap after being judged to have exceeded track limits. Gutiérrez drove into his garage to retire with an engine electrical problem on lap 19. Chilton was forced into making an unscheduled pit stop two laps later after his front-right tyre was punctured because of a valve problem on the wheel.|$|E
60|$|We {{have all}} gone quiet again. So {{at last he}} climbs back and takes his seat with the driver once more. The road is still straight, {{swinging}} on through the moorland strip by the sea. And he leans to the silent, nerve-tense Mr. Rochester, pleading again. And at length Mr. Rochester edges aside, and lets him take the driving wheel. And so now {{we are all in}} the hands of our friend the bus-mate. He drives--not very well. It is evident he is learning. The bus can't quite keep in the grooves of this wild bare road. And he shuts off when we slip down a hill--and there is a great muddle on the upslope when he tries <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>gear.</b> But Mr. Rochester sits squeezed and silently attentive in his corner. He puts out his hand and swings the levers. There is no fear that he will let anything go wrong. I would trust him to drive me down the bottomless pit and up the other side. But still the beseeching mate holds the steering wheel. And on we rush, rather uncertainly and hesitatingly now. And thus we come to the bottom of a hill where the road gives a sudden curve. My heart rises an inch in my breast. I know he can't do it. And he can't, oh Lord--but the quiet hand of the freckled Rochester takes the wheel, we swerve on. And the bus-mate gives up, and the nerve-silent driver resumes control.|$|E
50|$|The second {{generation}} Fiesta ECOnetic was launched at the 2008 British International Motor Show. To encourage drivers to be efficient, a green indicator light signals the most economical time <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>gear,</b> later {{introduced to the}} Focus model.|$|E

5000|$|... 1996: A new Autostick {{shifting}} feature {{became available}} for the TSi trim. The car could be [...] "manually" [...] shifted by tilting the shift knob right or left <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>gears</b> up or down.|$|R
50|$|Fully synchronous, hydrau-pneumatic {{systems are}} {{designed}} <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>gears</b> based on engine performance and other velocity indicators, delivering torque to drive wheels. These transmissions have synchronizing mechanisms (called cone and collar synchronizers) {{that are designed}} to keep gear dog-teeth from being broken off.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the film}} The Dark Knight and its {{follow-up}} The Dark Knight Rises, a Shepard tone {{was used to}} create {{the sound of the}} Batpod, a motorcycle that the filmmakers didn't want <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>gear</b> and tone abruptly but to constantly accelerate.|$|E
50|$|Combo Racer is a Sidecar {{video game}} {{developed}} by Imagetic Design {{and published by}} Gremlin Graphics in 1990. The game uses an isometric view and the player has <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>gear</b> manually. It contains a training mode, a normal game mode and a track editor.|$|E
50|$|The brake levers {{are mounted}} on the side horns; the rider will hold these instead of the center bars when braking or {{maneuvering}} is required. Often the shifters for the derailleur gears are mounted at {{the tips of the}} aero bars allowing the athlete <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>gear</b> ratios without compromising their aerodynamic position.|$|E

50|$|It {{was able}} to reach up to 30 km/h. It seated four, the two rear seats could be covered by a {{convertible}} top. The car was steered by handlebars. Tilting of the handlebars forward and backward served <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>gears</b> (forward - lower gear). The wheels were wooden with gum tyre.|$|R
5000|$|In 1937, the {{derailleur}} {{system was}} introduced to the Tour de France, allowing riders <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>gears</b> without having <b>to</b> remove wheels. Previously, riders would have to dismount in order <b>to</b> <b>change</b> their wheel from downhill to uphill mode. [...] Derailleurs did not become common road racing equipment until 1938 when Simplex introduced a cable-shifted derailleur.|$|R
50|$|The {{motorcycle}} sequential gearchange is retained {{and operated}} via a gear shift inside {{the cockpit and}} requires a forward or backward movement <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>gear.</b> The brake, accelerator and clutch operate as per a car and are adjustable for reach to accommodate drivers of different size. The seat and steering wheel are fixed in position.|$|E
50|$|It was a {{good idea}} but it created {{problems}} in practice. If the mechanical stock was at the back, the driver might forget <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>gear,</b> and this could lead to gearbox damage. In 1969 (after a serious accident in 1968) the Class 127s were re-labelled with the (then disused) Red Triangle coupling code, and mixed running was discontinued.|$|E
50|$|Formula Junior version {{utilized}} the Renault 4 speed transaxle, {{and both of}} the Lotus transaxle and this Renault box had the gear shifter lever {{on the left side}} of the driver. An optional gearbox was the VW gearbox with Hewland 4 speed gears. This last gearbox has the added advantage of being able <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>gear</b> ratios from behind the gearbox without removing the gearbox from the car.|$|E
50|$|A {{transmission}} control unit or TCU is a device that controls modern electronic automatic transmissions. A TCU generally uses sensors from the vehicle as well as data provided by the engine control unit (ECU) to calculate how and when <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>gears</b> in the vehicle for optimum performance, fuel economy and shift quality.|$|R
5000|$|The terms suicide clutch, {{and suicide}} shifter or jockey shifter {{refer to a}} motorcycle's {{foot-operated}} clutch and hand-shifter <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>gears,</b> [...] Foot clutches (rocker clutches) and hand shifters (tank shifts) were found on early motorcycle designs from {{around the turn of}} the 20th Century to the 1940s or 50s, and reappearing on modern retro styled custom motorcycles and choppers. Modern motorcycles do not require removing a hand from the handlebars to shift gears, using only the fingers for the clutch and the toes of one foot to select gears. [...] In contrast, the fanciful slang [...] "suicide" [...] was applied to designs where the rider removes one hand <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>gears,</b> or cannot put both feet on the ground while using a foot clutch to disengage the transmission. Sometimes the shifter is referred to as a [...] "jockey shifter" [...] while the foot clutch is called a [...] "suicide clutch".|$|R
5000|$|A crash gearbox, {{also known}} as a crash box, is a {{transmission}} type used in old cars, trucks, and other automotive vehicles. It is more properly called a [...] "sliding mesh" [...] gearbox and has the nickname [...] "crash" [...] because it is difficult <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>gears,</b> so <b>gear</b> <b>changes</b> are often accompanied by loud noises. The etymology of [...] "crash" [...] is probably [...] "clash".|$|R
50|$|In 1974 Foden {{commissioned}} a Rover V8-engined Marina {{to compete in}} the UDT London-Sahara-Sydney Marathon rally. Driven by Major John Hemsley and Major John Skinner, the car stormed through several stages before suffering rear-axle failure in the desert. John Hemsley started the rally with his left arm in acst having broken his wrist, leaving John Skinner <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>gear</b> for him during the special stages. The rear axle had been the only part obtained from a non-BL source.|$|E
50|$|Patents for {{built-in}} systems <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>gear</b> ratios {{appeared as}} early as 1890. Adler offered a three-speed gearbox bicycle in the 1930s. Several attempts to develop gearbox bicycles during the 2000s for downhill racing, such as the Honda RN-01 G-cross, incorporated complete derailleur gear drive trains in an enclosure. Around the same time Schlumpf Innovations and Hammerschmidt offered cranksets with two different gear ratios and just one chainring. Pinion launched their spur-gear system in the 2010s.|$|E
50|$|The {{sprockets}} in {{a cassette}} are usually {{held together by}} three small bolts or rivets for ease of installation. These keep the sprockets and spacers in the correct order and position when they are removed from the freehub body. When the sprockets {{need to be replaced}} due to wear or the user wishes <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>gear</b> ratios available, only the sprockets are replaced, not the ratchet mechanism. Cassettes also allow the use of sprockets with fewer teeth, as in micro drive systems.|$|E
5000|$|Modern [...] "Semi-{{automatic}} transmissions" [...] {{usually have}} a fully automatic mode, where the driver does not need <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>gears</b> at all, operating {{in the same manner}} as a conventional type of automatic transmission by allowing the transmission's computer <b>to</b> automatically <b>change</b> <b>gear</b> if, for example, the driver were redlining the engine. The semi-automatic transmission can be engaged in manual mode wherein one can up-shift or down-shift using the console-mounted shifter selecter or the paddle shifters just behind the steering wheel, without the need of a clutch pedal. The ability to shift gears manually, often via paddle shifters, can also be found on certain automatic transmissions (manumatics such as Tiptronic) and continuous variable transmissions (CVTs) (such as Lineartronic).|$|R
50|$|The Tiptronic S is {{an upgrade}} to the {{original}} Tiptronic, {{with the ability to}} adapt to driver's behaviour, and also allows driver <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>gears</b> without entering manual mode. In manual mode, if there is no driver input for a period of eight seconds, the system reverts to automatic mode. It was used as early as 2000 in the Porsche Boxster.|$|R
50|$|The {{mechanism}} {{was invented}} in 1927 by Tullio Campagnolo, an Italian bicycle racer. He was frustrated when he attempted <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>gears</b> during a race. At the time there was but one cog {{on each side of}} the rear hub, so <b>gear</b> <b>changes</b> necessitated stopping, removing the rear wheel, rotating it horizontally so that the opposite cog is engaged by the chain, and finally reinstalling the wheel. The weather had turned cold, and his hands were numb, so he could not operate the wingnuts which retained the wheel. He had been well-placed prior <b>to</b> the <b>gear</b> <b>change,</b> but lost valuable time. This prompted him to develop the quick release.|$|R
50|$|Hill {{surrendered}} {{the lead}} to Clark when his clutch froze and he was briefly unable <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>gear.</b> As Clark pulled ahead, Amon caught Hill on lap 65. While the Englishman struggled to find a gear, the Ferrari went through for second place. Amon, however, suddenly saw his oil pressure drop on lap 76, and Hill regained second place. After eight laps, when Hill's Lotus again was unable to select a gear, Amon moved back into second until lap 96, when, after a scintillating drive, his engine finally ran out of oil entirely.|$|E
50|$|The {{other major}} {{features}} {{in which the}} Volvo 66 differs from the DAF 66 are also mostly safety related. It has different seats featuring headrests, a safety steering wheel, steel side-impact bars in the doors, a declutching servo which enabled the driver <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>gear</b> with the choke engaged (In the older DAF models this was not possible, because the increased idle caused the centrifugal clutch to engage). The Volvo 66 also has a 'park' mode in the CVT, which locks the driveline. From 1977 the estate version featured a window wiper on the bootlid.|$|E
50|$|A {{gear stick}} (rarely spelled gearstick), gear lever (both UK English), {{gearshift}} or shifter (US English) is a metal lever {{attached to the}} shift assembly in a manual transmission-equipped automobile and is used to change gears. In an automatic transmission-equipped vehicle, a similar device {{is known as a}} gear selector. A gear stick will normally be used <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>gear</b> whilst depressing the clutch pedal with the left foot to disengage the engine from the drivetrain and wheels. Automatic transmission vehicles, semi-automatic transmissions, and those with continuously variable transmission gearboxes do not require a clutch pedal.|$|E
40|$|When {{you go to}} a {{show called}} Private Dancer what exactly might you expect? Dancer, {{performance}} artist, satirist and hostess, Wendy McPhee makes it very clear when she appears dressed only in a studded choker. After being captivated by the vivacious Micheline Van Houtem and her band Mich en Scene, the Cabaret Festival has <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>gears</b> for Paris Combo’s more eclectically cool style...|$|R
50|$|Modern {{electronic}} {{automatic transmissions}} have electrical solenoids which are activated <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>gears.</b> Simple electronic-control designs (such as Ford's AOD-E, AXOD-E and E4OD) use the solenoids {{to modify the}} shift points in an existing valve body, while more advanced designs (such as the Chrysler Ultradrive and its follow-ons) use the solenoids to control the clutches indirectly, {{by way of a}} greatly simplified valve body.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} {{the specific}} {{wording of the}} law {{may or may not}} prohibit the use of a [...] "mid-drive" [...] or [...] "crank-drive" [...] motor set-up where the motor drives the rear wheel of the bicycle through the existing chain drive of a bicycle that has multiple gears depending on several points of interpretation of the law. Specifically the interpretation of the wording, [...] "does not require clutching or shifting by the operator after the drive system is engaged". A [...] "mid-drive" [...] or [...] "crank-drive" [...] motor set-up on an electric bicycle does indeed allow the operator <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>gears</b> in the power drive system between the motor and the rear wheel of the bicycle. Whether or not such a mechanism which allows the operator <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>gears</b> satisfies the wording that requires the operator <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>gears</b> is a matter of legal interpretation by the courts. Just as [...] "shall issue" [...] and [...] "may issue" [...] (as in laws governing the issuing licenses) in application of the law have two different meanings (in the first case if you meet the requirements they have to give you the license and in the second they don't have to if they decide not to even if you meet the requirements for the license) whether or not [...] "does not require shifting" [...] outlaws electric bicycles where shifting is possible but is not necessarily required is a matter of interpretation. Thus the legality of electric bicycles equipped with a [...] "mid-drive" [...] or [...] "crank-drive" [...] motor set-up in the U.S. state of Montana is not clearly defined.|$|R
5000|$|Dingle cog: A {{two-speed}} track cog for {{fixed gear}} bicycles. It {{was released in}} early 2007. It is a multi-speed fixed-gear cog that is compatible with standard track hubs and lockrings. Three gear combinations are available, 17t and 19t, 17t and 20t, as well as 17t and 21t. When used with two appropriately sized chainrings, the rear axle's position in the dropouts can remain almost the same and still allow a relatively large difference in gear ratio between the two combinations. Bicycle Fixation's Harold Ikerd wrote, [...] "The ability <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>gear</b> ratios while on the trail, road, or lost is heavenly!" ...|$|E
50|$|The clutch {{is located}} between {{the engine and}} the gearbox, as {{disengaging}} it is usually required <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>gear.</b> Although the gearbox does not stop rotating during a gear change, there is no torque transmitted through it, thus less friction between gears and their engagement dogs. The output shaft of the gearbox is permanently connected to the final drive, then the wheels, and so both always rotate together, at a fixed speed ratio. With the clutch disengaged, the gearbox input shaft is free to change its speed as the internal ratio is changed. Any resulting difference in speed between the engine and gearbox is evened out as the clutch slips slightly during re-engagement.|$|E
5000|$|In the front, buyers {{could choose}} between two single seats and the {{optional}} full width bench seat, {{with the front}} corner of the seat squab contoured so as to accommodate the gear lever and allow seating for three. The rear seat had a fold down centre armrest and leather covers were used. A heater was fitted as standard. The car was available in black, maroon, green, blue or grey finish. The gear lever was floor mounted by the driver's door, so drivers in right hand drive markets had <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>gear</b> with their right hand. [...] The handbrake was operated by a lever under the dashboard in both bench and individual front seat versions.|$|E
2500|$|The Enzo has a {{semi-automatic}} transmission (also {{known as the}} F1 gearbox) using paddles to control an automated shifting and clutch mechanism, with LED lights {{on the steering wheel}} telling the driver when <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>gears.</b> [...] The gearbox has a shift time of just 150milliseconds. [...] The transmission was a first generation [...] "clutchless" [...] design from the late 1990s, and there have been complaints about its abrupt shifting.|$|R
50|$|By its nature, a {{freewheel}} mechanism acts as {{an automatic}} clutch, making it possible <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>gears</b> in a manual gearbox, either up- or downshifting, without depressing the clutch pedal, limiting {{the use of the}} manual clutch to starting from standstill or stopping. The Saab freewheel can be engaged or disengaged by the driver by respectively pushing or pulling a lever. This will lock or unlock the main shaft with the freewheel hub.|$|R
25|$|Many modern {{bicycles}} have removable chainrings, {{to allow}} for replacement when worn, or <b>to</b> <b>change</b> the <b>gear</b> ratio provided (although the change is limited).|$|R
