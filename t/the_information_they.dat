5|$|Carroon, gravely ill, is {{cared for}} by the Rocket Group's doctor, Briscoe (John Glen), who has been having a secret affair with Carroon's wife, Judith (Isabel Dean). It is not just Quatermass who is {{interested}} in what happened to Carroon and his crewmates; journalists such as James Fullalove (Paul Whitsun-Jones) and Scotland Yard's Inspector Lomax (Ian Colin) are also keen to hear his story. Carroon is abducted {{by a group of}} foreign agents whose government wants <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>they</b> believe he has obtained about travelling in space. It is clear that there is something critically wrong: he appears to have absorbed the consciousness of the other two crew members, and is slowly mutating into a plant-like alien organism.|$|E
5|$|Compared to {{neighbouring}} Ireland and Anglo-Saxon England, few {{records of}} 9th- and 10th-century events in Scotland survive. The main local source {{from the period}} is the Chronicle of the Kings of Alba, a list of kings from Kenneth MacAlpin (died 858) to KennethII (Cináed mac Maíl Coluim, died 995). The list survives in the Poppleton Manuscript, a 13th-century compilation. Originally simply a list of kings with reign lengths, the other details contained in the Poppleton Manuscript version were added in the 10th and 12th centuries. In addition to this, later king lists survive. The earliest genealogical records of the descendants of Kenneth MacAlpin may date {{from the end of}} the 10th century, but their value lies more in their context, and <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>they</b> provide about the interests of those for whom they were compiled, than in the unreliable claims they contain.|$|E
5|$|In March 2016, the ICAO adopted several {{amendments}} to the Chicago Convention to address issues raised by Flight 370's disappearance. For aircraft manufactured after 2020, cockpit voice recorders {{will be required to}} record at least 25 hours of data, so that they record all phases of a flight. Aircraft designs approved after 2020 will need to have a means to recover the flight recorders, or <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>they</b> contain, before the recorders sink below water. This provision is performance-based {{so that it can be}} accomplished by different techniques, such as streaming flight recorder data from aircraft in distress or using flight recorders which eject from aircraft and float on the water's surface. The new regulations will not require modifications to existing aircraft.|$|E

5|$|Increased fire {{monitoring}} through {{ground based}} and aerial reconnaissance has been implemented to quickly determine how a particular fire will be managed. Fire monitors first {{determine whether a}} fire is human-caused or natural. All human-caused fires are suppressed since they are unnatural, while natural fires are monitored. Fire monitors map the fire perimeter, record local weather, and examine the types of fuels burning {{and the amount of}} fuel available. Additionally, they investigate the rate of spread, flame lengths, fuel moisture content, and other characteristics of each fire. Monitors relay <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>they</b> gather to fire managers who then make determinations on future actions.|$|E
5|$|There is {{an ethical}} {{component}} {{that must be}} considered. The capability to uncover information about victims of war crimes or homicide may present a conflict in cases that involve competing interests. Forensic archaeologists are often contracted {{to assist with the}} processing of mass graves by larger organisations that have motives related to exposure and prosecution rather than providing peace of mind to families and communities. These projects are at times opposed by smaller, human rights groups who wish to avoid overshadowing memories of the individuals with their violent manner(s) of death. In cases like these, forensic archaeologists must practice caution and recognize the implications behind their work and <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>they</b> uncover.|$|E
5|$|Cayce {{flies to}} Moscow to meet Stella {{in person and}} watch Nora work. Nora is brain damaged from an {{assassination}} attempt and can only express herself through film. At her hotel, Cayce is intercepted and drugged by Dorotea and wakes up in a mysterious prison facility. Cayce escapes; exhausted, disoriented and lost, she nearly collapses as Parkaboy, who upon Cayce's request was flown to Moscow, retrieves her and brings her to the prison where the film is processed. There Hubertus, Stella and Nora's uncle Andrei, and the latter's security employees are waiting for her. Over dinner with Cayce, the Russians reveal {{that they have been}} spying on her since she posted to a discussion forum speculating that the clips may be controlled by the Russian Mafia. They had let her track the clips to expose any security breaches in their distribution network. The Russians surrender all <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>they</b> had collected on her father's disappearance and the book ends with Cayce coming to terms with his absence while in Paris with Parkaboy, whose real name is Peter Gilbert.|$|E

5|$|The Propaganda Ministry {{took over}} the {{broadcasting}} facilities of conquered countries immediately after surrender, and began broadcasting prepared material using the existing announcers {{as a way to}} gain the trust of the citizens. Most aspects of the media, both domestically and in the conquered countries, were controlled by Goebbels and his department. The German Home Service, the Armed Forces Programme, and the German European Service were all rigorously controlled in everything from <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>they</b> were permitted to disseminate to the music they were allowed to play. Party rallies, speeches, and demonstrations continued; speeches were broadcast on the radio and short propaganda films were exhibited using 1,500 mobile film vans. Hitler made fewer public appearances and broadcasts as the war progressed, so Goebbels increasingly became the voice of the Nazi regime for the German people. From May 1940 he wrote frequent editorials that were published in Das Reich which were later read aloud over the radio. He found films to be his most effective propaganda medium, after radio. At his insistence, initially half the films made in wartime Germany were propaganda films (particularly on antisemitism) and war propaganda films (recounting both historical wars and current exploits of the Wehrmacht).|$|E
5|$|With {{the loss}} of all 239 people on board, Flight 370 is the second deadliest {{incident}} involving a Boeing 777 and the second deadliest incident in Malaysia Airlines' history, behind Flight 17 in both categories. Malaysia Airlines was struggling financially, a problem that was exacerbated by a decline in ticket sales after the disappearance of Flight 370 and the downing of Flight 17; the airline was re-nationalised {{by the end of}} 2014. The Malaysian government received significant criticism, especially from China, for failing to disclose information promptly during the early weeks of the search. Flight 370's disappearance brought to public attention the limits of aircraft tracking and flight recorders, including several issues raised four years earlier—but never mandated—following {{the loss of}} Air France Flight 447. In response to Flight 370's disappearance, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) adopted new standards for aircraft position reporting over open ocean, extended recording time for cockpit voice recorders, and, from 2020, will require new aircraft designs to have a means to recover the flight recorders, or <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>they</b> contain, before the recorders sink below water.|$|E
