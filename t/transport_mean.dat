40|$|The article {{presents}} a determination method of <b>transport</b> <b>means</b> serviceability {{in a real}} city transport system. The considerations have been demonstrated {{on the basis of}} a real city bus transport system in a chosen agglomeration. The executive subsystem consisting of elementary subsystems of the type human – technical object (operator – <b>transport</b> <b>means)</b> whose serviceability and reliability have a direct influence on capability to perform the transport task is directly responsible for accomplishment of the city transport system tasks. In order to develop a model of <b>means</b> of <b>transport</b> serviceability there were determined significant states of the operational use process and there was made a division and reduction of the number of states in terms of the availability criterion. On this basis, an event model of the process of <b>transport</b> <b>means</b> operational use, and then a mathematical model of this process, were built with the assumption that its model is a homogenous Markov’s process X(t). Next, boundary values of availability coefficient for the distinguished availability levels of <b>transport</b> <b>means</b> used in the city transport system were determined for operational data obtained from a real city bus transport system.

5000|$|Using {{the second}} {{assumption}} of diffusion theory, {{we note that}} the fractional change in current density [...] over one <b>transport</b> <b>mean</b> free path is negligible. The vector representation of the diffusion theory RTE reduces to Fick's law , which defines current density {{in terms of the}} gradient of fluence rate. Substituting Fick's law into the scalar representation of the RTE gives the diffusion equation: is the diffusion coefficient and μ'sμs is the reduced scattering coefficient.Notably, there is no explicit dependence on the scattering coefficient in the diffusion equation. Instead, only the reduced scattering coefficient appears in the expression for [...] This leads to an important relationship; diffusion is unaffected if the anisotropy of the scattering medium is changed while the reduced scattering coefficient stays constant.|$|E
50|$|Monte Carlo {{simulations}} of photon transport, though time consuming, will accurately predict photon {{behavior in a}} scattering medium. The assumptions involved in characterizing photon behavior with the diffusion equation generate inaccuracies. Generally, the diffusion approximation is less accurate as the absorption coefficient μa increases and the scattering coefficient μs decreases.For a photon beam incident on a medium of limited depth, error due to the diffusion approximation is most prominent within one <b>transport</b> <b>mean</b> free path of the location of photon incidence (where radiance is not yet isotropic) (Figure 3).Among the steps in describing a pencil beam incident on a semi-infinite medium with the diffusion equation, converting the medium from anisotropic to isotropic (step 1) (Figure 4) and converting the beam to a source (step 2) (Figure 5) generate more error than converting from a single source {{to a pair of}} image sources (step 3) (Figure 6). Step 2 generates the most significant error.|$|E

The tensions between the different factions in Uruguay, combined with the links between Uruguay and those territories absorbed into Brazil in 1828, meant that renewed military conflict remained a real possibility. When Brazil intervened to support its own clients, the Colorado faction, López declared war on Brazil. López then invaded Argentina {{in order to move}} forces quickly against Brazil, leading to Argentina joining the war on Brazil's side. The triple alliance - Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay - were outnumbered {{at the start of the}} conflict on land, but held a clear advantage at sea, thanks to Brazil's naval Armada. Initially, Paraguayan forces had the advantage and advanced rapidly. The alliance responded at the naval battle of Riachuelo in 1865, where the Brazilian fleet commanded by Francisco Manoel Barroso da Silva won, destroying the Paraguayan navy. The battle decided the outcome of the war in favour of the Triple Alliance, as the limitations on road <b>transport</b> <b>mean</b> that rivers were critical to military maneuver. By the end of 1865, the Triple Alliance was on the offensive on land and were prepared to invade Paraguay. The invasion itself ground on, marked by high rates of disease and attrition. It was not until 1869 that Asunción was finally occupied, and the conflict then turned into a drawn-out guerrilla war that lasted until López was killed in 1870. The result was disastrous for Paraguay - some estimates place total Paraguayan losses [...] - [...] through both war and disease [...] - [...] as high as 1.2 million people, or 90% of its pre-war population.
