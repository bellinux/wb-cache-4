5|$|La <b>Tante</b> DC10 Restaurant, {{known locally}} as The Green Plane, is a public private {{partnership}} restaurant established in Accra. This operates from the defunct Ghana Airways McDonnell Douglas DC-10, which had been in operation as a passenger jet between 1983 and 2005. The restaurant serves staple Ghanaian dishes. The restaurant has been well received locally.|$|E
5|$|La <b>Tante</b> DC10 Restaurant is a {{restaurant}} located inside a converted McDonnell Douglas DC-10 formerly {{used by the}} defunct Ghana Airways. Formerly flying 380 passengers, it has {{been converted into a}} 118-seat restaurant with large numbers of the seats removed in order to provide adequate space for patrons and for the installation of dining tables. An annex was attached to {{the right side of the}} fuselage to accommodate the kitchen.|$|E
5|$|The Restaurant {{was later}} {{seen as the}} start of a {{movement}} in London wherein high-end restaurants were moved into hotels. This was followed in 1999 by Koffman moving La <b>Tante</b> Claire from its Royal Hospital Road location into The Berkeley hotel. The Restaurant's location in a hotel was thought at the time to have changed the mantra of not eating in a hotel-based restaurant to one where it was more openly acceptable.|$|E
5|$|The chefs were {{initially}} {{surprised at how}} busy they were at lunchtimes; Harveys had been based next to Wandsworth Common and so the typically slow lunch service was used to give the chefs a break. Now based near Hyde Park, they had {{four or five times}} the number of covers for a lunch service than before. White remained determined to gain his third Michelin star, and to achieve this, he sought to emulate and surpass the food and service at Pierre Koffman's three Michelin star restaurant La <b>Tante</b> Claire. White worked 14/15 hour days for six days a week, expecting similar hours from those chefs under him, with the restaurant only closed on Sundays.|$|E
5|$|The Restaurant Marco Pierre White, {{also known}} as The Restaurant, Restaurant Marco Pierre White and later Oak Room Marco Pierre White, was a {{restaurant}} run by chef proprietor Marco Pierre White. The restaurant was opened at the Hyde Park Hotel, London, on 14 September 1993, having previously wished to find a larger premises than his restaurant Harveys to seek a third Michelin star. In moving, the kitchen staff was {{more than doubled in}} number, and White used Pierre Koffman's La <b>Tante</b> Claire as a template to pursue his third star. This was awarded in the 1995 Michelin guide. White then moved the restaurant to the Le Méridien Piccadilly Hotel, London, in 1997, taking on the listed Oak Room as the main dining room. He sought a further rating of five red knives and forks in the guide, to gain the highest possible rating for the restaurant. It gained this award in the following guide.|$|E
5|$|The {{restaurant}} was {{moved into the}} Berkeley Hotel in 2003 where it replaced Pierre Koffmann's La <b>Tante</b> Claire, {{in the same year}} that Wareing became Chef Patron of the Grill Room at the Savoy Hotel, and he was named Chef of the Year by Caterer and Hotelkeepers Catey Awards. The return to the Savoy meant that he was competing against Anton Edelmann, his former boss from the River Room at the hotel. Rather than serve a menu similar to the French driven Pétrus, Wareing chose to continue to serve the British cuisine that the Grill Room was known for, including his take on previous menu items such as steak and kidney pudding and potted shrimps. Pétrus went on to be awarded two Michelin stars and five AA Rosettes, while the Savoy Grill achieved its first Michelin star in the hotel's history in 2004.|$|E
25|$|The {{remains of}} a ship {{excavated}} at <b>Tante,</b> near Yangon {{is thought to have}} belonged to Kalingan traders.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tante</b> Leen was {{a strong}} {{supporter}} of association football club AFC Ajax, releasing several records dedicated to the club, such as Ajax Hup Hup Hup, Ajax and Ajax is niet dood! a duet with Johnny Jordaan.|$|E
25|$|Staff and pupils {{were on a}} first-name basis; Anna Essinger was {{generally}} called <b>Tante</b> (Aunt) Anna, or TA for short. She was a strict disciplinarian with both staff and pupils, but the environment at the school was loving and supportive. Corporal punishment was taboo.|$|E
25|$|Woking {{used to be}} home to the Oriental Institute until 1899. The Surrey {{campus of}} the International School of London is located in Woking. Woking {{is also home to}} the <b>Tante</b> Marie cookery school, the UK's oldest {{established}} professional cookery school. According to the Woking News and Mail, it has now been bought by famous chef Gordon Ramsay who intends to set up his own catering college.|$|E
25|$|In 1960 <b>Tante</b> Leen {{opened a}} café with {{her second husband}} (her first husband died in World War II during a bombardment) at Nieuwendijk 103, where she would perform every night. In 1947 {{she gave birth to}} their Son Freddie. Her song 'Ook kleine kinderen worden groot' (English: Small {{children}} do grow up) is dedicated to him. In 1968 she was selected to represent the Netherlands the annual Eurovision Song Contest but she declined the invitation. She ended her singing career in 1975 and spent the remainder of her life in a senior home.|$|E
25|$|The household, {{dominated}} by the uncle (whom Ernst nicknamed O Weh—"Oh dear!"—in a play on his initials), was pietistic and uncongenial. Hoffmann was to regret his estrangement from his father. Nevertheless, he remembered his aunts with great affection, especially the younger, Charlotte, whom he nicknamed <b>Tante</b> Füßchen ("Aunt Littlefeet"). Although she {{died when he was}} only three years old, he treasured her memory (e.g. see Kater Murr) and embroidered stories about her {{to such an extent that}} later biographers sometimes assumed her to be imaginary, until proof of her existence was found after World War II.|$|E
500|$|The {{restaurant}} serves Ghanaian cuisine. These include staples such as spiced tilapia, {{served with}} banku, {{a type of}} maize-based porridge. Other dishes include Jollof rice with chicken, and [...] "red red" [...] black-eyed pea stew with fish. While the prices at La <b>Tante</b> DC10 Restaurant are higher than those normally seen in the local area, the restaurant prices itself lower than the upmarket restaurants elsewhere in Accra.|$|E
500|$|After White won {{his third}} Michelin star in 1995, {{he found a}} new obsession. While 54 {{restaurants}} across Europe had three stars at the time, there was a further rating system used by Michelin called the knives and forks. They were awarded for elements such as ambience and aesthetics, and came in two colours – the basic black awards and the superior red awards. White wanted his restaurant to be the undisputed best restaurant in the UK, since La <b>Tante</b> Claire, the Waterside Inn and Le Gavroche had each only gained four. With these in mind, White moved the restaurant from the Hyde Park Hotel to the Le Méridien Piccadilly Hotel, closing at the initial location on 16 August 1997. White took the [...] listed Oak Room as the main {{dining room of the}} restaurant, opening there two weeks later. This had become available after Granada plc bought the hotel group, and White was suddenly contracted to a company with a wider range of hotels.|$|E
500|$|A Parisian critic, {{after seeing}} La grand' <b>tante,</b> {{declared}} that Massenet was a symphonist {{rather than a}} theatre composer. At {{the time of the}} British premiere of Manon in 1885, the critic in The Manchester Guardian, reviewing the work enthusiastically, nevertheless echoed his French confrère's view that the composer was really a symphonist, whose music was at its best when purely orchestral. [...] Massenet took a wholly opposite view of his talents. He was temperamentally unsuited to writing symphonically: the constraints of sonata form bored him. He wrote, in the early 1870s, [...] "What I have to say, musically, I have to say rapidly, forcefully, concisely; my discourse is tight and nervous, and if I wanted to express myself otherwise I would not be myself." [...] His efforts in the concertante field made little mark, but his orchestral suites, colourful and picturesque according to Grove, have survived on the fringes of the repertoire. [...] Other works for orchestra are a symphonic poem, Visions (1891), an Ouverture de Concert (1863) and Ouverture de Phèdre (1873). After early attempts at chamber music as a student, he wrote little more in the genre. Most of his early chamber pieces are now lost; three pieces for cello and piano survive.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Tante</b> Leen {{frequently}} performed {{together with}} Johnny Jordaan and was {{often accompanied by}} famed accordion player Jan Schallig. Several of her song lyrics were written by song writer Jaap Valkhoff. Her biggest hit was the single [...] "Oh, Johnny", directed towards Johnny Jordaan. He then replied to the recording by releasing the song [...] "Tante Leen, <b>Tante</b> Leen, ik ga een liedje over je zingen" [...] (English: Auntie Leen, Auntie Leen, I will sing a song about you) by Harry de Groot.|$|E
2500|$|Similar to the Waage are {{the smaller}} {{carriages}} (Chaise / Schäse) with only 2–4 people giving away treats. Most {{of the people}} in the carriages, generally less rude than the Waggis, are dressed as old ladies and referred to as the Alti <b>Tante</b> (meaning [...] "old aunt"), giving them a near-royal feeling.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Tante</b> Leen (English: Auntie Leen, January 28, 1912 — August 5, 1992), {{real name}} Helena Kok-Polder, later Helena Jansen-Polder, was a Dutch folk singer from Amsterdam, Netherlands. Together with her partner Johnny Jordaan, the two {{together}} hold the title of [...] "de Beste Stem van de Jordaan" [...] (English: The best voice of the Jordaan).|$|E
2500|$|Born 28 January 1912 in Amsterdam, <b>Tante</b> Leen didn't perform live {{until she}} was 43-years of age. Before that point she earned a living as {{cleaning}} and shrimp pelster. Regular custodians of the café in which she worked signed her up for a talent search one day which was being initiated by record label Bovema {{in order to find}} the best voice of the Jordaan. She finished in second place behind Johnny Jordaan. Since then she became known as the [...] "Nightingale of Willemsstraat'.|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{his return}} to London in 1993, Ramsay was offered the {{position}} of head chef (under chef-patron Pierre Koffmann) at the Three Michelin starred La <b>Tante</b> Claire in Chelsea. Shortly thereafter, Marco Pierre White re-entered his life, offering to set him up with a head chef position and 10% share in the Rossmore, owned by White's business partners. The restaurant was renamed Aubergine {{and went on to}} win its first Michelin star fourteen months later. In 1997, Aubergine won its second Michelin star. [...] Despite the restaurant's success, a dispute with Ramsay's business owners as they wanted to turn Aubergines into a chain and Ramsay's dream of running his own restaurant led to his leaving the partnership in 1997.|$|E
2500|$|Amsterdam's musical culture {{includes}} a large collection of songs which treat the city nostalgically and lovingly. The 1949 song [...] "Aan de Amsterdamse grachten" [...] ("On the canals of Amsterdam") was performed and recorded by many artists, including John Kraaijkamp sr.; the best-known version is probably that by Wim Sonneveld (1962). In the 1950s Johnny Jordaan rose to fame with [...] "Geef mij maar Amsterdam" [...] ("I prefer Amsterdam"), which praises the city {{above all others}} (explicitly Paris); Jordaan sang especially about his own neighbourhood, the Jordaan ("Bij ons in de Jordaan"). Colleagues and contemporaries of Johnny include <b>Tante</b> Leen, Zwarte Riek, and Manke Nelis. Other notable Amsterdam songs are [...] "Amsterdam" [...] by Jacques Brel (1964) and [...] "Deze Stad" [...] by De Dijk (1989). A 2011 poll by Amsterdam paper Het Parool found, somewhat surprisingly, that Trio Bier's [...] "Oude Wolf" [...] was voted [...] "Amsterdams lijflied". Notable Amsterdam bands from the modern era include the Osdorp Posse and The Ex.|$|E
2500|$|In 1945 Mowinckel helped Jens Bolling with {{preparations}} for Studioteatret's first production, {{an adaptation of}} Wilder's play The Long Christmas Dinner, {{but she did not}} want to be credited. The play premiered in Oslo on 15 June 1945, attracting critical praise. In October 1945 she produced Ibsen's Fru Inger til Østeraad for Trøndelag Teater, the theatre's first production after the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany. The opening performance was held on 2 October, and Mowinckel also played the character [...] "Inger Gyldenløve". On 6 October a memorial performance was held in memory of Henry Gleditsch, with the presence of the Crown Prince, the Crown Princess and family members of victims from the extrajudicial executions in 1942. Mowinckel contributed by reading Grieg's poem [...] "Årsdagen". In February 1946 she directed Wilder's play Our Town for Studioteatret, garnering plaudits both from the critics and the public. During the summer 1946 the theatre toured Northern Troms and Finnmark, which had been severely damaged during the war, and they played Our Town at 26 different sites. In May 1947 Mowinckel staged Sartre's play The Respectful Prostitute for Studioteatret, with Merete Skavlan as a successful prostitute [...] "Lizzie". She played the character [...] "Bernanda" [...] in an adaptation of Lorca's La casa de Bernarda Alba in 1947, staged by Gerda Ring. In December 1948 she staged Abell's play Dager på en sky at Nationaltheatret, and also played the character [...] "Hera". In January 1949 she directed Strindberg's Dødsdansen at Det Norske Teatret. When she was in her 75th year she played the character [...] "Thalia" [...] in Abell's Dronning går igjen at Nationaltheatret, a play written specifically for her. A gala performance was held for her on 1 December, as a late celebration of her 50th anniversary as actress. In May 1950 she staged Ibsen's Kongsemnerne for Oslo's millennium celebration. She staged Eliot's play Cocktail Party at Nationaltheatret in April 1951, and Shaw's play Caesar and Cleopatra in November 1951. She directed the opening performance at Folketeatret in 1952, Heiberg's play <b>Tante</b> Ulrikke. In May 1953 she staged Schiller's Maria Stuart at Nationaltheatret, at a gala performance for the official visit by Queen Juliana of the Netherlands. She staged the first production of Stenersen's Eva og Johannes at Nationaltheatret in November 1953. In September 1954 she staged Ibsen's En Folkefiende at Trøndelag Teater. In January 1955 Havrevold's new play Uretten was staged by Mowinckel at Nationaltheatret, and the play resulted in a fierce debate on women's rights. In May 1956 she produced Ibsen's play Lille Eyolf. Her last stage appearance was in 1963, when she performed as the aging [...] "Camilla Collett" [...] at Oslo Nye Teater.|$|E
