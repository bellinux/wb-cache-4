25|$|Academic Abdullahi El-Tom, in his {{critique}} of the book, states that the latter half {{is not nearly as}} well-argued as the heavily statistical beginning, making points that are then not substantiated and sometimes falling into polemical statements. For example, the Black Book states that the equipment that was to be used for the Western Highway Project was diverted to the Northern Highway Project, which is both widely rumored and believed, but no evidence is provided <b>to</b> <b>back</b> <b>it</b> up. El-Tom further makes the following observations: it has an implicit view of Sudan as Islamic; it emphasizes the grievances of Western Sudan (i.e. Darfur and Kordofan) over the other marginalized regions; and it has an unforgiving stance towards all the north, rather than just the three clans identified as controlling the government (i.e. the Shaigiya, the Jaaliyeen and the Danagla).|$|E

25|$|However, these {{advantages}} held {{within them}} disadvantages. First, since a note has no intrinsic value, {{there was nothing}} to stop issuing authorities from printing more of it than they had specie <b>to</b> <b>back</b> <b>it</b> with. Second, because it increased the money supply, it increased inflationary pressures, a fact observed by David Hume in the 18th century. The result is that paper money would often lead to an inflationary bubble, which could collapse if people began demanding hard money, causing the demand for paper notes to fall to zero. The printing of paper money was also associated with wars, and financing of wars, and therefore regarded as part of maintaining a standing army. For these reasons, paper currency was held in suspicion and hostility in Europe and America. It was also addictive, since the speculative profits of trade and capital creation were quite large. Major nations established mints to print money and mint coins, and branches of their treasury to collect taxes and hold gold and silver stock.|$|E

[...] Writers for the series wrote into Animaniacs stories that happened to them; the episodes [...] "Ups and Downs," [...] "Survey Ladies," [...] and [...] "I Got Yer Can" [...] were episodes based on true stories that happened to Rugg, Deanna Oliver, and Stoner, respectively.

Baryonyx had many finely serrated, conical teeth, with the largest teeth in front.

500|$|The Tribune's demise hastened a {{settlement}} of the strike. Discontinued as a morning paper, the Tribune name {{was added to the}} afternoon publication and on September 12, 1966, the new World Journal Tribune published its first issue. [...] "It was not a bad paper," [...] according to Tribune historian Richard Kluger, and featured many Tribune writers, including Wolfe, Breslin, Kerr and columnist Dick Schaap, and incorporated New York as its Sunday magazine. The first weeks' editions were dominated by the input of the Hearst and Scripps papers, but after a time, the [...] "Widget" [...] (as the merged publication was nicknamed) took on the appearance and style of the late-era Tribune. The World Journal Tribune reached a circulation near 700,000—fourth-largest for American evening newspapers at the time—but had high overhead costs and relatively little advertising. Whitney eventually withdrew support for the newspaper, but Scripps and Hearst continued <b>to</b> <b>back</b> <b>it</b> until the paper folded on May 5, 1967.|$|E

He summarized the game as [...] "an enjoyable challenge with a unique game-playing engine <b>to</b> <b>back</b> <b>it</b> up." [...] Scorpia was also positive, stating that despite flaws [...] "Ultima Underworld is an impressive first product. The meticulous construction of a real-world dungeon environment is outstanding. [...] may be a dungeon trek, {{but it is certainly}} the dungeon trek of the future". In 1993 she praised the [...] "superb graphics" [...] of [...] "a definite must for game players". [...] The magazine later awarded the game [...] "Role-Playing Game of the Year". Computer Shopper enjoyed its storyline and characters, and believed that the game [...] "makes you feel as if you've entered a virtual reality". Despite describing its interface as [...] "not truly intuitive", the reviewer finished by calling the game [...] "addictive" [...] and [...] "a fine value". The Chicago Tribune awarded it Best Game of the Year, and called it [...] "an amazing triumph of the imagination" [...] and [...] "the creme de la creme of dungeon epics".|$|E

500|$|Rolling Stone {{credited}} West with transforming hip hop's mainstream, [...] "establishing a {{style of}} introspective yet glossy rap [...] ", and called him [...] "as interesting and complicated a pop star as the 2000s produced—a rapper who mastered, upped and moved beyond the hip-hop game, a producer who created a signature sound and then abandoned it to his imitators, a flashy, free-spending sybarite with insightful {{things to say about}} college, culture and economics, an egomaniac with more than enough artistic firepower <b>to</b> <b>back</b> <b>it</b> up." [...] West's middle-class background, flamboyant fashion sense and outspokenness have set him apart from other rappers. Early in his career, he was among the first rappers to publicly criticize the preponderance of homophobia in hip hop. The sales competition between rapper 50 Cent's Curtis and West's Graduation altered the direction of hip hop and helped pave the way for new rappers who did not follow the hardcore-gangster mold. Rosie Swash of The Guardian viewed the sales competition as a historical moment in hip-hop, because it [...] "highlighted the diverging facets of hip-hop in the last decade; the former was gangsta rap for the noughties, while West was the thinking man's alternative." [...] West's 2008 album 808s & Heartbreak polarized listeners upon its release, but was commercially successful and impacted hip hop and pop stylistically, as it laid the groundwork for a new wave of artists who generally eschewed typical rap braggadocio for intimate subject matter and introspection, including Frank Ocean, The Weeknd, Drake, Future, Kid Cudi, Childish Gambino, Lil Durk, Chief Keef, and Soulja Boy. According to Ben Detrick of XXL magazine, West effectively led a new wave of artists, including Kid Cudi, Wale, Lupe Fiasco, Kidz in the Hall, and Drake, who lacked the interest or ability to rap about gunplay or drug-dealing. In 2013, Julianne Escobedo Shepherd of Spin described West as fronting a [...] "new art-pop era" [...] in contemporary music, in which musicians draw widely on the visual arts as a signifier of both creative exploration and extravagant wealth.|$|E
500|$|Upon its release, {{the album}} {{garnered}} general acclaim from critics. Rolling Stones Rob Hoerburger {{commented that the}} [...] "sharp-tongued" [...] Janet Jackson is [...] "more concerned with identity than with playlists", as Control declares {{she is no longer}} the Jacksons' baby sister. Hoerburger expressed the view that tracks such as [...] "Nasty" [...] and [...] "What Have You Done for Me Lately" [...] erased the former [...] "pop-ingénue image" [...] of Jackson's first two albums, and that [...] "Control is a better album than Diana Ross has made in five years and puts Janet in a position similar to the young Donna Summer's—unwilling to accept novelty status and taking her own steps to rise above it." [...] Steven Ivory of Billboard expressed [...] "ocally, Jackson is more aggressive than ever. Indeed, her exhibition of sass and funkiness is certainly more provocative" [...] in comparison to her previous work. NME wrote: [...] "Jackson has gone a long way in shaking off the experience of being a shadow Jackson child. She is an artist in her own right." [...] Newsweek stated [...] "n an era of big-voiced pop-soul divas... her current hit album, is taut, funky, hard as nails, an alternative to the sentimental balladry and opulent arrangements of Patti LaBelle and Whitney Houston." [...] Robert Christgau [...] "scoffed at Janet's claims of autonomy", but gave the album a B rating based on [...] "its entertainment value". Los Angeles Times critic Connie Johnson wrote: [...] "Though still a teen-ager, this singer's stance is remarkably nervy and mature. She has a snotty sort of assurance that permeates several cuts, plus the musical muscle <b>to</b> <b>back</b> <b>it</b> up." [...] Jon Pareles of The New York Times notes Control takes obvious influence from Prince, describing [...] "he album's pacing, its clipped vocal lines—even the spoken introduction that starts things off" [...] as pure Minneapolis sound; he adds [...] "ut where the Prince style is usually connected with heavy-breathing come-ons, Miss Jackson is cheerfully standoffish." ...|$|E
500|$|The revamped concerts {{were also}} met with {{critical}} acclaim. Mark Savage from BBC Online reviewed {{the first of the}} revised performances in the United Kingdom. Savage described the concert as a hugely ambitious, terrifyingly loud show, [...] "spread over four acts and held together by a flimsy 'narrative' about Gaga and her dancer friends trying to get to a party." [...] He was also impressed that the entire spectacle was put together in just four weeks. MTV's James Montogomery reviewed the first North American performance of the tour in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. He said that the tour was [...] "packed with more wattage than an overheated power plant and more costume changes than a thousand Vegas reviews, it's the kind of show that leaves you with wide eyes, ringing ears, aching limbs and absolutely zero chance of making it to work in the morning." [...] New York Daily News writer Jim Farber expected that the theatricality of the show might have obscured the songs, but instead felt that Gaga's voice was perfect and the concert actually [...] "pushed Gaga a long way towards her obvious goal – to be the queen of this pop moment." [...] Glenn Gamboa from Newsday said that Gaga [...] "built her monster-sized fame on knowing how to create a spectacle and then having the substance <b>to</b> <b>back</b> <b>it</b> up. For every coat made of Kermit the Frog dolls or headdresses that covered her face in red lace, there was a stomping disco anthem or tender piano ballad to match. That back and forth is the centerpiece of her Monster Ball Tour." [...] Dan Aquilante from the New York Post was critical of the show, calling it [...] "scripted, silly, and tired, right down to Gaga's patter." [...] He added that the 15 costumes Gaga wore during the two-hour plus gig were [...] "more successful helping her cement the notion of an erotic and exotic otherworld." [...] Writing in the Telegram & Gazette, Craig S. Semon was appreciative of the show, calling it [...] "an out-of-this-world blast and end-of-the-world blow-out that must be seen to be believed." ...|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reception}} to {{the episode}} was moderately positive. Zack Handlen from The A.V. Club gave the episode a B+ and wrote positively of Scully's portrayal, noting [...] "Really, this works best as a Scully episode. I prefer Darin Morgan's {{version of the}} character , but I doubt that version could support a full episode about God {{in the same way}} that this more searching, and lost, Scully does." [...] However, Handlen was critical of some of the religious aspects of the episode, noting that [...] "If there's a Christian God in the X-Files universe, doesn't that trump just about everything else that Mulder and Scully have spent their time on?... There are too many implications here for the show to support, and while it doesn't destroy the episode, it does make it difficult for me <b>to</b> <b>back</b> <b>it</b> as fully as I'd like to." [...] John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode a 7 out of 10 rating, noting [...] "Overall, this episode highlights Scully and her faith, and in the process, manages to presage many of the future plot developments for the series and her character. The spiritual war at the foundation of the series mythology is reflected in a situation that speaks directly to Scully and her upbringing, and though some of the religious metaphors are heavy-handed, it works well enough." [...] Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a B+ and wrote positively of the episode's [...] "inventiveness," [...] which [...] "derives from its choice of the most mainstream paranormality of all—Christianity." [...] The review also wrote positively of the Mulder-Scully role reversal, calling the change [...] "always welcome". Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a moderately positive review and awarded it two-and-a-half stars out of four. She noted that [...] "Scully's search to reconcile her religious beliefs and her scientific training makes for powerful drama, and Gillian Anderson is up to the challenge." [...] Vitaris, however, criticized elements of the plot, most notably the [...] "un-saintly" [...] quality of Kevin and Kevin's lack of emotion after his mother is killed. Furthermore, she called the ending [...] "a real mess". Not all reviews were positive. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode two stars out of five, and called it a [...] "peculiarly bloodless episode". The two wrote that many of the traits possessed by Kevin were only helpful in certain isolated scenes, such as the ability to bilocate. Shearman and Pearson concluded that the show should [...] "take a serious subject by all means, but then take the subject seriously." ...|$|E
