5|$|Carpenter was not {{the first}} person asked to oversee the comic; Mark Verheiden, who co-wrote the one-off comic, was {{originally}} intended {{to be in charge of}} the bimonthly series. Verheiden's commitment to the TV series kept him from working on the comic books, so he asked Carpenter if he would <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>on.</b> Although the comic-book series was intended to expand on the TV series, there was an occasional continuity overlap because of differences in production schedule between the comic and the series. In one instance, the comic book showed Clark robbing an ATM and the season-three premiere showed him robbing multiple ATMs. The comic-book series tied into the TV series, the Chloe Chronicles webisodes and Smallville-related webpages, with cast and crew interviews and information on the episodes' production. The comic-book series ended in January 2005, with no comics published until the Season Eleven series debut.|$|E

25|$|Real Madrid {{use this}} style of play {{extremely}} well because they have very quick players in the likes of Ronaldo, Bale and Benzema of whom can speed in behind the defence and <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> when on the break at a quick pace. They also have passing masters in Kroos and Modric of whom can play the killer through ball in the spaces created. And for effect, they have a solid defence in Ramos and Varane to defend leads. Marcelo and Carvajal are also very quick full backs and so can get forward on the break too and put crosses in the box during attack, while being able to track back quick enough.|$|E

500|$|On May 26, 1989, Joan [...] "Jo" [...] Rogers, 36, and her daughtersMichelle, 17, and Christe, 14 {{left their}} family dairy farm in Willshire, Ohio, for a {{vacation}} in Florida. They had never before left their home state. Authorities believe that the women became lost on June 1, during the return drive from Orlando to Willshire, and had decided to take an extra vacation day in Tampa. While looking for their hotel they encountered Chandler, who gave them directions, and offered to meet them again later to <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> a sunset cruise of Tampa Bay. The Rogers women had left Orlando around 9:00a.m. and checked into the Days Inn on Route 60 at 12:30p.m. Photographs, developed from a roll of film in a camera found in Rogers' hotel room, showed Michelle sitting on the floor; the last photo was a shot taken from the hotel balcony showing the sunset beginning over Tampa Bay, confirming the women were alive, and had not left their hotel room as the sunset began. They were last seen alive at the hotel restaurant around 7:30p.m. It is believed they boarded Chandler's boat by the dock on the Courtney Campbell Causeway (part of Route 60) between 8:30p.m. and 9:00p.m., {{and that they were}} dead by 3a.m. Chandler may have used {{the fact that he was}} born in Ohio to lure them into feeling a connection to him. Chandler knew the women were not from Florida because he saw the Ohio license plates on their car.|$|E

2500|$|Gordon's {{task was}} made easier by {{innovative}} military ideas Ward had {{implemented in the}} Ever Victorious Army. Gordon was quite critical of the way Chinese generals fought the war, observing that the Chinese were willing to inflict and accept gargantuan losses in battle, an approach Gordon disapproved of. Gordon wrote: [...] "The great thing...is to cut off their retreat, and the chances are they will go without trouble; but attack them in the front, and leave their rear open, and they fight most desperately". Gordon always preferred to outflank the Taiping lines rather to <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> frontally, an approach that caused much tension with his counterparts in the Chinese Imperial Army who did not share Gordon's horror at the huge numbers of dead caused by frontal assaults.|$|E

Once there, Puyi planned to take a plane to escape, taking with him his brother Pujie, his servant Big Li, Yoshioka, and his doctor while leaving Wanrong, his concubine Li Yuqin, Lady Hiro Saga and Lady Saga's two children behind. The decision to leave behind {{the women and children}} was made by the misogynistic Yoshioka who saw the lives of women and children as worthless compared to the lives of men, and vetoed Puyi's attempts to <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> the plane to Japan.

2500|$|The band's final album (recorded after in-fighting and {{uncertainty}} over {{the quality of}} the music the band was recording had brought about a hiatus), Dust was released in 1996. The album spawned several singles, including [...] "All I Know", and [...] "Dying Days" [...] and peaked at number 134 on the Billboard 200 and number 39 on the Canadian album chart which was the first Screaming Trees album to chart outside the United States. Despite consistently favorable reviews, the album did not match the commercial success of Sweet Oblivion. Following the Dust tour in the United States, Screaming Trees took another hiatus for Lanegan to begin his work on his third solo album, Scraps at Midnight. The band headed back into the studio in 1999 and recorded several demos and shopped them around to labels, but no label was willing to <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>on.</b> The band played a few surprise shows in early 2000 and following a concert to celebrate the opening of Seattle's Experience Music Project, the band surprisingly announced their official breakup.|$|E

2500|$|I Have Been to Hiroshima Mon Amour (2009) was {{produced}} at the Voice & Vision Theater at {{part of the}} Hiroshima Project at Ohio Theatre. Written {{as a response to}} the famous 1959 film Hiroshima mon amour, the play follows three stories taking place at different points in time. The first follows a French actor who falls in love with a man in Hiroshima, the second is about a man’s fiancée who becomes a victim of the bomb, and the third revolves around three students in New york City who watch the 1959 film and argue about it. Miyagawa said she wrote this film because, “I was annoyed by the appropriation of the city’s tragedy by the French female protagonist. How could one person’s loss possibly be thought of as a metaphor for the deaths of one hundred thousand people?”. Martin Harries, a NYU English professor, praises the play, “There are many plays that look like they want to be movies. There are too few that <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> in meaningful, craft, theatrical ways. Here is one.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Australia was {{scheduled}} to tour the West Indies in 1984. The players selected for the tour were presented with official contracts by the Australian Cricket Board.

To the dismay of the Board, Hughes stood by his team and with his lawyer drafted a compromise agreement that gave the players some financial security. The West Indies was commonly regarded at that times as {{the best team in the}} world and Hughes' new-look Australian team now had to <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> without the recently retired Marsh, Lillee and Chappell. Bob Simpson commented, [...] "The saddest and hardest lot for any captain is taking over the remnants of a once-great team. I wouldn't be in Hughes' shoes for quids." [...] In addition, the Australian team was badly affected by injury; Yallop withdrew with a knee injury and Kepler Wessels, Graeme Wood, Steve Smith, Rodney Hogg and Carl Rackemann all were unfit to play at times during the tour.|$|E
