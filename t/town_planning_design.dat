Again, of {{importance}} here were opposing views from abroad, namely the picturesque theories of town planning proposed by Viennese city planner Camillo Sitte, as put forward in his influential book City Planning According to Artistic Principles (1889) and the opposing classical-rational urbanism point of view also proposed in Vienna by Otto Wagner, heavily influenced by the Parisian model - under the directorship of Baron Haussmann from 1858 to 1870 - of driving wide boulevards through the old labyrinthine city with the intent of modernising traffic and waste management, as well as enabling the greater social control of the population. This debate came to a head in Finland in the first ever <b>town</b> <b>planning</b> <b>design</b> competition in 1898-1900 for the Töölö district of Helsinki. Three entries were lifted out for recognition; first prize to Gustaf Nyström (together with engineer Herman Norrmén), second prize to Lars Sonck, and third prize to a joint entry by Sonck, Bertil Jung and Valter Thomé. Nyström's scheme represented classicism with wide main streets and imposing public buildings arranged in symmetrical axial compositions, and the other two in the Sittesque style, with the street network adapted to the rocky terrain and with picturesque compositions. A fantastic sketch accompanying Sonck's competition entry gives an indication of the imagery he was aiming for, inspired by his travels in Germany. Historian Pekka Korvenmaa makes the point that leading theme was the creation of the atmosphere of medieval urban environments - and Sonck later designed a similar proposal in 1904 to rearrange the immediate surroundings of St.Michael's Church in Helsinki, with numerous [...] "fantastic" [...] spired buildings. In the Töölö competition, undecided what course of action to take, however, the City Council asked the prize-winners to submit new proposals. When this led to further stalemate Nyström and Sonck were commissioned to work together on the final plan combining Nyström's spacious street network and elements of Sonck's Sittesque details. The final plan (1916) under the direction of Jung, made the scheme more uniform, while the architecture is seen as typical of the Nordic Classicism style. A typical street in the plan is that of Museokatu, with tall lines of buildings in a classical style along a curving street line. A still wider (24 metres) new tree-lined boulevard was that of Helsinginkatu, driven through the working-class district of Kallio, first outlined in 1887 by Sonck, but with further input from Nyström, and completed in around 1923.|$|E

The overlapping concepts of military design (on different scale levels between product design and <b>town</b> <b>planning),</b> <b>design</b> thinking (design methodology) and military thinking (evolution of military doctrine) can be combined into the concept of ‘military design thinking’. Military design thinking relies on a “scientized” approach towards (architectural) design.

The transformation of reinforced concrete from a primitive to a modern material on the battlefields of World War I is taken as a case study. The conflict marks {{a turning point in the}} typological evolution from geometrically inspired fortification methods towards the condensed architectural object of the monolithic bunker. Moreover, some late World War I examples display a variety of new and semi-industrialized construction methods (such as precast concrete, advanced concrete plants and scientifically managed construction sites). In conclusion, military design thinking is instrumental both in the dissemination of reinforced concrete on an unprecedented scale, as well as in its transformation to a modern material...|$|E
40|$|AbstractUnder {{the climate}} change and the {{unfettered}} expansion of urbanization, problems associated with urban waterlogging, water resources, and the aquatic environment are becoming serious. In 2014, the Chinese government began to implement a plan to construct sponge cities {{in an effort to}} combat these problems. The construction of a sponge city is a complex task of systems engineering and requires the support of a high volume of data about the city's natural geography, social economy, water resources, and eco-environment. These data have multiple sources and are highly complex. Based on the problem existing of the currently urban data information monitoring, collecting and application, this paper puts forward a sponge urban data integration plan according to the integration of urban planning data, underground pipe network information, digital elevation information, hydrological station network information and based on the low impact development technology, urban waterlogging drainage, urban non-point source pollution prevention & control technologies integrated. The plan is designed for use in sponge city <b>town</b> <b>planning,</b> <b>design,</b> and construction, and as a theoretical framework for operations that rely on data and integrated technologies.

The town was destroyed during the Great Northern War in 1712.As the important foreign trade town of Vyborg was surrendered to Russia in 1721, this town (newly renamed in honour of the King Frederick I of Sweden in 1723) was intended to replace it. The town, hitherto a small domestic trade port with restricted trade, was granted extensive privileges, including foreign trade. Finnish people soon shortened the name to Hamina. The rebuilding of the town took place in 1722-1724.
