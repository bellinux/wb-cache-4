5|$|The {{writers of}} The Simpsons {{went on strike}} {{together}} with the Writers Guild of America {{at the end of}} 2007. The broadcasting of The Simpsons was not affected by the strike. Since {{it takes a long time}} to produce an episode of an animated show, the episodes are written up to a year in advance. So the strike would have had <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> a while for the show to have run out of new episodes. Production of season 20 was further delayed because of contract negotiations with the six main voice actors. The dispute was resolved, and the actors' salary was raised to $400,000 per episode. The delay in production has caused the planned 22 episodes to be shortened to 20.|$|E

According to the BBC the contract was worth £6billion with 5,000 people directly employed {{in the manufacture of}} the Eurofighter, while other reports put the value at £10billion with 50,000 jobs at stake.|$|E

It would not be until the Industrial Revolution that the same level of expansion of urban population would be reached again, although the number of newly created settlements would remain much lower than in the 12th and 13th centuries.|$|E

Joe Dillon, a water worker from South Boston, Massachusetts, and a devoted Celtics fan, screamed [...] "We love ya, Cooz", breaking the tension and the crowd went into cheers.

[...] She faced {{criticism}} {{from her parents}} over her decision to marry and start a large family so young. [...] She also felt snubbed by her peers, {{at a time when}} the feminist movement was blooming and educated women were establishing careers. [...] She later said, [...] "My parents were questioning my choices, my peers were. But [...] I was pretty resolute, pretty confident in what I was doing." [...] She taught early morning seminary to them and other children while her husband worked, first in business, then in politics. [...] She wanted <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> a master's degree, perhaps in art history, but first taking care of her children, and later her health issues, forestalled that. [...] She was active in the local PTA and with the League of Women Voters. [...] With a friend, she held local cooking classes for a brief period. [...] Naturally athletic, she began playing tennis and became one of the best players around the local country clubs.|$|E
500|$|The Giro's eighteenth {{stage was}} a [...] {{individual}} time trial that stretched from Chiavari {{to the summit}} finish on the Passo del Bocco. The race leader Evgeni Berzin won the stage by twenty seconds over Miguel Indurain. Stage 19 saw the day of racing {{come down to a}} sprint finish that was won by Massimo Ghirotto. The twentieth stage saw the Giro race through the Alps and up to the summit of Les Deux Alpes for the stage finish. The lead group up Les Deux Alpes contained the likes of Evgeni Berzin, Marco Pantani, and Miguel Indurain who had attacked each other multiple times but to no avail. The trio was later joined by Vladimir Poulnikov and Nelson Rodriguez who both eventually left them <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> the stage win. Poulkinov edged out Rodriguez to the stage win atop the mountain. The penultimate stage of the Giro saw a summit finish atop the Sestriere. The stage saw snow and chilling temperatures which led to the general classification contenders sticking together, while Pascal Richard {{went on to win the}} summit finish and solidify his lead atop the mountains classification. The Giro's final stage came down to a sprint finish that was won by Stefano Zanini as Evgeni Berzin won the Giro d'Italia.|$|E

2500|$|George Gunn (13 June 1879 in Hucknall, Nottinghamshire – 29 June 1958 in Cuckfield, Sussex) was an English cricketer {{who played}} in 15 Tests from 1907 to 1930. Along with other notable batsmen such as Jack Hobbs, Frank Woolley and Phil Mead, {{he was one of}} a group who, {{beginning}} their first-class careers in the Edwardian Era, seemed <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> ever. In Gunn's case, it was from 1902 to 1932, in the course of which he made more runs for Nottinghamshire than anyone else, before or since: 31,592 at 35.70. Christopher Martin-Jenkins wrote of him: [...] "A whimsical artist, George Gunn was capable of making runs against any attack, orthodox or unorthodox, as the mood took him. His record in a long career is outstanding, but all who saw him play regularly seem agreed that he should have scored even more runs than he did." ...|$|E
2500|$|The fight itself {{left many}} fans disappointed. Forbes.com {{contributor}} Brian Goff called it [...] "arguably, the least entertaining 'mega fight' in memory", attributing the disappointment to Mayweather's defense-oriented strategy, which is atypical of top boxers. [...] The New York Times {{felt that the}} bout was [...] "far from electrifying and had some fans grumbling about Mayweather’s methodical defensive style". Los Angeles Times columnist Bill Dwyre felt that the fight was [...] "as compelling as the 405 freeway at 8 a.m.". Regarding Pacquiao's undisclosed shoulder injury, he called the entire situation very damaging to boxing, accusing the fight's promoters of allowing the fight <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> monetary reasons, and potentially alienating fans. Dwyre {{went on to say}} that [...] "This was billed the Fight of the Century. As the Wall Street Journal so aptly put it, it's good that we have 85 years left to top it." [...] Former heavyweight champ Evander Holyfield, who thought that Pacquiao should have been awarded the decision, questioned the judging of not just this fight but recent prize fights in general in an essay in The Players Tribune.|$|E
2500|$|Frank was {{the first}} son of Canon William Buckland, a noted {{geologist}} and palaeontologist, and Mary, a fossil collector, palaeontologist and illustrator. Frank was born and brought up in Oxford, where {{his father was a}} Canon and the Dean of Christ Church. His godfather was the sculptor Sir Francis Chantrey. Educated at home by his mother, he went, at eight and a half, to a boarding school in Cotterstock, Northamptonshire staying with his uncle John Buckland. From 1837–39, he went to a preparatory school in Laleham, Surrey, run by his uncle, John Buckland, a brutal headmaster who flogged his pupils quite excessively. Relief came with a scholarship to Winchester College, a school with an unbroken history of six hundred years. Here he was taught by the Second Master, Charles Wordsworth, who sent letters of praise to his father. Winchester had a harsh regime, but was much preferable to his previous school. While at Winchester he continued to take an interest in animals, trapping rats and mice, dissecting and sometimes eating them. Students complained of a foul smell emanating from the remains of a cat under his bed. Towards the end of his schooling he was dissecting human parts that he obtained from the hospital on the sly. He was known for his exploits with a lancet. One student with a dolichocephalous head heard Frank muttering [...] "what wouldn't I give for that fellow's skull!" [...] He was not a first-rate scholar, but managed to gain entrance to Christ Church, Oxford in October 1844, after failing to get a scholarship to the smaller Corpus Christi. He joined a debating club and the first essay he read was on [...] "whether Rooks are beneficial to the farmer or not". He became a friend of the curator at Surrey Zoo and when he heard that a panther had died, he had it dug up and declared that the meat [...] "was not very good". When the British Association met in 1847 at Oxford, Frank took along his pet bear Tigleth Pileser dressed in student attire of a cap and gown to the party. Charles Lyell wrote that Buckland introduced the bear formally to him and other zoologists present. This was not <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> long as the Dean finally informed him that [...] "either you or your bear must go". In 1845 Frank went to Giessen for three months to study chemistry under Justus von Liebig. In September 1846 he made a trip around Switzerland. Frank also attended some of the lectures of his father.|$|E
