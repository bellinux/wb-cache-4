5|$|Regarding incidence, cohort {{longitudinal}} studies (studies where a disease-free population is followed over the years) provide rates between 10 and 15 per thousand person–years for all dementias and 5–8 for AD, {{which means that}} half of new dementia cases each year are AD.

There are also sex differences in the incidence rates, women having a higher risk of developing AD particularly in the population older than 85.

40|$|The {{effect of}} gene flow on <b>Hispanic</b> <b>populations</b> from {{different}} geographic {{regions of the}} United States was analyzed using six autosomal DNA markers (LDLR, GYPA, HBGG, D 7 S 8, GC, and HLA-DQA). By region of sampling, <b>the</b> <b>Hispanic</b> <b>populations</b> showed different ancestry contributions, from a trihybrid structure with European, Native American, and African contributions (California, Nevada, Florida, New Jersey, and Virginia) to a dihybrid structure with European and American contributions (Southwest population) or European and African contributions (Pennsylvania and Southeast population). These findings allowed us to define two regional groups, the West and the East. In the former, Native American contributions ranged from 35. 58 % to 57. 87 %; in the East region the values ranged from 0 % to 21. 27 %. An African influence was similar in both regions, ranging from 0 % to 17. 11 %, with a tendency of increasing in the East region.
