40|$|Long term forest {{research}} {{sites in}} India, going by different names including Linear <b>Tree</b> <b>Increment</b> <b>Plots,</b> Linear <b>Increment</b> <b>Plots,</b> Linear Sample Plots and Permanent Preservation Plots, cover diverse plant communities and environmental conditions. Presently, {{some of these}} long-term observational studies are functional, some are disturbed and others have almost been lost. The accumulated data will become increasingly important {{in the context of}} environmental modelling and climate change, especially if the plots and data can be maintained and/or revived. This contribution presents the history and current state of forest research plots in India, including details of locations and re-measurements. We provide a brief introduction of the National Forest Inventory (NFI), Preservation Plots in natural forests, the 50 -ha Mudumalai Forest Dynamics Plot as part of the Centre for Tropical Forest Science and Smithsonian Institution Global Earth Observatories network (CTFS-SIGEO), and research plots established in plantations for tree growth studies and modelling. We also present some methodological details including assessment and analysis for two types of observational studies, the Tree Count Plots (TCP) and Tree Re-measurement Plots (TRP). Arguments are presented in favour of enumeration and analysis methods which are consistent with current approaches in forest ecological research. (c) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Errors in {{estimating}} volume <b>increments</b> {{of forest}} <b>trees.</b> Periodic <b>tree</b> and stand <b>increments</b> are often estimated retrospectively from measurements of diameter and height growth of standing trees, {{through the application}} of various simplifications of the general formula for volume increment rates. In particular, the Hellrigl method and its various formulations have been often suggested in Italy. Like other retrospective approaches, the Hellrigl method is affected by a systematic error, resulting from the assumption as a reference term of conditions at one of the extremes of the period considered. The magnitude of the error introduced by different formulations has been assessed in the present study through their application to mensurational and increment measurements from the detailed growth analysis of 107 Picea abies trees. Results are compared with those obtained with a new equation, which makes reference to the interval mid-point.

40|$|Second-growth {{tropical}} forests {{are an important}} global carbon sink. As current knowledge on biomass accumulation during secondary succession is heavily based on chronosequence studies, direct estimates of annual rates of biomass accumulation in monitored stands are largely unavailable. We evaluated the contributions of <b>tree</b> diameter <b>increment,</b> recruitment, and mortality to annual tree biomass change during succession for three groups of tree species: Second-growth (SG) specialists, generalists, and old-growth (OG) specialists. We monitored six second-growth {{tropical forests}} that varied in stand age and two old-growth forests in northeastern Costa Rica. We monitored these {{over a period of}} 8 to 16 years. To assess rates of biomass change during secondary succession, we compared standing biomass and biomass dynamics between second-growth forest stages and old-growth forest, and evaluated the effect of stand age on standing biomass and biomass dynamics in secondgrowth forests. Standing tree biomass increased with stand age during succession, whereas the rate of biomass change decreased. Biomass change was largely driven by <b>tree</b> diameter <b>increment</b> and mortality, with a minor contribution from recruitment. The relative importance of these demographic drivers shifted over succession. Biomass gain due to <b>tree</b> diameter <b>increment</b> decreased with stand age, whereas biomass loss due to mortality increased. In the age range of our second-growth forests, 10 - 41 years, SG specialists dominated tree biomass in secondgrowth forests. SG specialists, {{and to a lesser extent}} generalists, also dominated stand-level biomass increase due to <b>tree</b> diameter <b>increment,</b> whereas SG specialists largely accounted for decreases in biomass due to mortality. Our results indicate that tree growth is largely driving biomass dynamics early in succession, whereas both growth and mortality are important later in succession. Biomass dynamics are largely accounted for by a few SG specialists and one generalist species, Pentaclethra macroloba. To assess the generality of our results, similar long-term studies should be compared across tropical forest landscapes. © 2015 by the Ecological Society of America...|$|R

40|$|Diameter {{and volume}} {{increment}} {{as well as}} change in stem form of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) were analysed to predict <b>tree</b> <b>increment</b> variables. A stem curve set model is presented, based on prediction of the diameters at fixed angles in a polar coordinate system. This model consists of three elementary stem curves: 1) with bark, 2) without bark and 3) without bark five years earlier. The differences between the elementary stem curves are the bark curve and the increment curve. The error variances at each fixed angles and covariances between the fixed angles are divided into between-stand and within-stand components. Using principal components the between-stand and within-stand covariance matrices are condensed separately for stem curve with bark, bark curve and increment curve. The two first principal components of the bark curve describe the vertical change in Scots pine bark type and the first principal component of the increment curve describes the increment rate. The elementary stem curves, bark curve and increment curve {{as well as the}} corresponding stem volumes, bark volume and volume increment can be predicted for all trees in the stand with free choice of sample tree measurements. When only a few sample trees are measured, the stem curve set model gives significantly more accurate predictions of bark volume and volume <b>increment</b> for tally <b>trees</b> than does the volume method, which is based on the differences between two independent predictions of volume.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to test the {{protection}} of the clone Populus deltoides cl. S- 6 - 36, with several fungicides, against the loss of height and diameter increment. The idea was to protect the leaf immediately from the beginning of vegetation growth against the attack pathogens. By the planed treatments, the foliage would be protected against the fungal attack during the first two to three months of vegetation growth, which would presumably contribute to avoid the significant decrease of height and diameter increments. The most efficient fungicide during the two-year research, both in the control of the fungus Marssonina brunnea, and in the control of Melampsora spp., was Bakarni kreč 50 (cupric oxychloride). This was concluded based on the lowest average number of formed acervuli, i. e. uredosori per cm 2 of leaf area. A significant decrease of poplar <b>tree</b> <b>increment</b> occurs if the intensity of parasite attack on the foliage is high and if the attacks are repeated several years successively.

As such, we compared relative abundances be-tween fall and spring catches of sympatric juvenile bluegill Lepomis macrochirus Rafinesque and yellow perch Perca flavescens (Mitchill) to evaluate the magnitude of overwinter mortality across locations (five lakes for two years) and through time (one lake for six years). In addition, we compared both quantile-quantile and <b>increment</b> <b>plots,</b> based on length-frequency histograms from fall- and spring-caught cohorts from 2004 to 2010, to determine if mortality was size-selective while accounting for over winter growth. Bluegill relative abundances (as indexed by catch-per-unit-effort) sig-nificantly decreased from fall to spring, although size-selective mortality was not detected in 10 instances. Yellow perch relative abundances were similar from fall to spring in five Nebraska Sandhill lakes; however, size-selective mortality was detected, with size-selective over winter mortality of smaller individuals occurring in one of eight instances, whereas greater mortality in larger individuals occurred in two instances. Positive growth occurred in both species but was variable among lakes and appeared to be system-specific. In Nebraska Sandhill lakes, over winter mortality likely differs between these two species in its severity, size-selective effect, and scale (i. e., lake-specific vs. large-scale processes), and is likel...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2006 Quantifying and {{modeling}} {{processes involved in}} the global carbon cycle is important to evaluate the temporal and spatial variability of these processes and understand {{the effect of this}} variability on future response to changing climate and land use patterns. Biomass accumulation and Net Primary Productivity (NPP) are large components of ecosystem carbon exchange with the atmosphere and thus are the focus of many modeling efforts. When scaling estimates of NPP temporally from days to years and spatially from square meters to landscapes and regions the spatial coherence of these processes through time must be taken into account. Spatial coherence {{is the degree to which}} pairs of sites across space are synchronous (i. e., correlated) through time with respect to a given process or variable. In this thesis I determined the spatial coherence of a major component of NPP, tree bole productivity (NPP[subscript B]), and examine how it influences scaling and our ability to predict NPP and forecast change of this flux. In Chapter 2 I developed and tested a method modeling radial <b>tree</b> <b>increment</b> growth from sub-sampled trees and estimating annual site-level biomass accumulation that allows quantification of the uncertainty in these estimates.

Individual tree response depended on tree diameter, with smallest trees exhibiting highest relative volume increment to thinning intensity.

The African tree species, Terminalia superba Engl. & Diels has a large distribution area and potentially incorporates these variations in its tree rings. Tree ring analysis was performed on 60 plantation <b>trees</b> (<b>increment</b> cores) and 41 natural trees (stem disks) from Ivory Coast and the Congolese Mayombe Forest. Natural forests and old plantations (50 - 55 years) showed similar growth patterns. Regional chronologies were developed for the two sample regions and showed a long-distance relationship for the period 1959 - 2008. Growth in the Mayombe was associated with early rainy season precipitation, but no relation was found between tree growth and precipitation in Ivory Coast. Congolese trees possibly show a higher climate-sensitivity than Ivorian trees, because precipitation in the Mayombe is more limiting, and Congolese T. superba trees are found closer to the margins of their distribution. Likewise, tree growth in the Mayombe was also influenced by the SSTs of the Gulf of Guinea and the South Atlantic Ocean during the early rainy season. However, tree growth was influenced by ENSO in both regions. In the Mayombe, La Nia years were associated with stronger tree growth whereas in Ivory Coast, El Nio years corresponded with stronger tree growth.

Even with the rather crude estimates of weather, climate, soil and nutrient deposition that were used, the strict shape of the growth curve, and the exclusion of the known good predictors age, latitude and altitude, we were able to explain between 10 % and 53 % of the variation in diameter growth of individual trees of the main European tree species and species groups. This level of explained variation is in line with the values reported by other studies based on country-scale forest inventory datasets (e.g. Andreassen and Tomter 2003; Laubhann et al. 2009; Cienciala et al. 2016; Charru et al. 2017).

These changes reveal recent climate warming footprint and are structured by species' temperature (-) and precipitation (+) growing conditions. Context Unprecedented climate warming impacts forests extensively, questioning the respective roles of climatic habitats and tree species in forest growth responses. National forest inventories ensure a repeated and spatially systematic {{monitoring of forests}} and form a unique contributing data source. Aims A primary aim {{of this paper was}} to estimate recent growth changes in eight major European tree species, in natural contexts ranging from mountain to Mediterranean. A second aimwas to explore their association with species' climatic habitat and contemporary climate change. Methods Using > 315, 000 <b>tree</b> <b>increments</b> measured in > 25, 000 NFI plots, temporal changes in stand basal area increment (BAI) were modelled. Indicators of climate normals and of recent climatic change were correlated to species BAI changes. Results BAI changes spanned from - 17 to + 42 % over 1980 - 2007 across species. BAI strongly increased for mountain species, showed moderate/ no increase for generalist and temperate lowland species and declined for Mediterranean species. BAI changes were greater in colder/ wetter contexts than in warmer/drier ones where declines were observed. This suggested a role for climate warming, further found more intense in colder contexts and strongly correlated with species BAI changes. &Conclusion The predominant role of climate warming and species climatic habitat in recent growth changes is highlighted in Western Europe. Concern is raised for Mediterranean species, showing growth decreases in a warmer climate with stable precipitation...|$|R
40|$|A {{method is}} {{outlined}} in which woods produced by deciduous and evergreen coniferopsids may {{be distinguished from}} one another {{on the basis of}} a quantitative analysis of growth ring anatomy. In this method the diameter of successive tracheid cells was measured across growth rings in modern coniferopsid woods, viewed using standard transverse anatomical sections. The cumulative algebraic sum of each cell's deviation from the mean was then calculated for each growth ring <b>increment</b> and <b>plotted</b> as a zero-trending curve (CSDM curve). Deciduous conifer and ginkgo species dominantly possess symmetrical or left-skewed CSDM curves whilst evergreen conifer species dominantly possess right-skewed CSDM curves. These data suggest that in most cases it may be possible to distinguish between evergreen and deciduous fossil coniferopsid species using wood anatomical characteristics, thus providing important insight into coniferopsid palaeoecology. key words: growth rings, conifer wood, palaeoclimate, evergreen, deciduous...|$|R
40|$|As part of {{an ongoing}} study on the {{mechanical}} characteristics of the damaged rock zone (DRZ) around a tunnel boundary and its influence on the overall behaviour of the near-field host rock, a numerical study was conducted to investigate the dominant rock mass failure mechanisms around shallow tunnels located in a body of brittle rock mass. Preliminary studies have clearly indicated that, the rock mass behaviour was largely dictated by the different yield mechanisms involved. These mechanisms appear to be multifarious due to the complex state of the induced stresses around the tunnel boundary at shallow depth. Some of these yield mechanisms are often difficult to capture using the traditional yield criterion such as the Mohr-Coulomb. In the study reported in this paper a series of computer simulations were performed using typical in-situ stresses and rock mass conditions generally encountered in shallow tunnelling projects in Sweden. The presence of a disturbed/damaged rock zone with finite thickness was also added into the models. Due {{to the nature of the}} simulations the FLAC 2 D code was selected and used. The values for the input parameters were estimated using a systematic procedure. To prevent premature tensile yielding due to transient loading traction was applied during tunnel excavation. The results show that, the dominant yield mechanism occurring around the shallow tunnel in brittle rock is the one of tensile nature. Compressive mechanisms do occur but seems to be less critical to overall performance of the tunnel. However, they do influence the overall behaviour of the rock mass response. The results further indicated that, the ‘true' locality of instability could be predicted from elastic analyses, by observing if all the major principle stresses are in tension in that locality. The shear strain <b>increment</b> <b>plots</b> of the model in plastic mode further supported this observation.
