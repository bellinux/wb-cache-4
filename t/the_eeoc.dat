25|$|In 2012, <b>the</b> <b>EEOC</b> {{ruled that}} {{employment}} {{discrimination on the}} basis of gender identity or transgender status is prohibited under Title VII. The decision held that {{discrimination on the basis}} of gender identity qualified as {{discrimination on the basis of}} sex whether the discrimination was due to sex stereotyping, discomfort with the fact of an individual's transition, or discrimination due to a perceived change in the individual's sex. In 2014, <b>the</b> <b>EEOC</b> initiated two lawsuits against private companies for discrimination on the basis of gender identity, with additional litigation under consideration. As of November 2014, Commissioner Chai Feldblum is making an active effort to increase awareness of Title VII remedies for individuals discriminated on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, <b>the</b> <b>EEOC</b> and some federal courts began holding that sexual {{harassment}} is also prohibited under the Act. In 1986, the Supreme Court held in Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson, , that {{sexual harassment is}} sex discrimination and is prohibited by Title VII. Same-sex sexual harassment has also been held in a unanimous decision written by Justice Scalia to be prohibited by Title VII (Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc., , 118 S.Ct. 998).|$|E

40|$|This {{symposium}} Essay {{responds to}} <b>the</b> <b>EEOC’s</b> new decision to interpret federal employment discrimination law’s {{ban on discrimination}} on the basis of sex to include a ban on {{discrimination on the basis}} of sexual orientation. It argues that although <b>the</b> <b>EEOC’s</b> decision does provide cause to celebrate, ongoing heteronormativity in federal employment discrimination law will continue to stand as a barrier to equal employment opportunity for gay workers. First, Title VII provides an exception to the sex discrimination ban in the context of intimate spaces, allowing, for example, only women to be hired to serve as labor and delivery nurses. This exception proceeds on the assumption that same-sex spaces are no-sex spaces, furthering the presumption that all employees are heterosexual. Second, Title VII provides an exception to the ban on sex discrimination in the context of role-modeling for children, allowing, for example, only women to be hired as counselors to serve as role models for female clients. This exception assumes that sex dictates the ability to fulfill particular parenting roles, furthering the notion that heterosexual couples have a parenting advantage over same-sex couples. Finally, Title VII’s ban on sexual harassment generally treats male-on-female harassment as sex discrimination by assuming that harassers are heterosexual, reinforcing heteronormative assumptions with every such case. So while <b>the</b> <b>EEOC’s</b> decision will provide some protection for gay workers, a more searching inquiry of the law to root out bias on the basis of sexual orientation will be necessary for employment discrimination law to achieve its promise of equal employment opportunity for these workers...|$|R
25|$|August 24, 2009, the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) filed a {{discrimination}} {{lawsuit against}} Target Corporation for unlawfully denying reasonable accommodation to an employee with multiple disability-based impairments and substantially reducing his work hours {{due to the}} medical conditions.

25|$|Toward {{the end of}} {{the early}} hearings, NPR's Supreme Court {{correspondent}} Nina Totenberg received a leaked Judiciary Committee/FBI report that a former colleague of Thomas, University of Oklahoma law school professor Anita Hill, accused him of making unwelcome sexual comments to her when the two worked together at the Department of Education (DOE) and EEOC. In the same FBI report, Thomas testified that he had once promoted Allyson Duncan over Hill as his chief of staff at <b>the</b> <b>EEOC.</b>|$|E
25|$|Green {{subsequently}} filed {{a complaint}} with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), alleging that he had been treated unfairly because of his activity in the Civil Rights Movement, but not alleging any outright racial bias. He then sued in U.S. District Court on both of those grounds, though <b>the</b> <b>EEOC</b> had not made a finding on the latter, and later appealed the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit before the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case.|$|E

50|$|Kronos, {{which was}} not {{a party to the}} litigation, objected to <b>the</b> <b>EEOC’s</b> {{subpoena}} on <b>the</b> basis that the information requested was irrelevant, and production would require Kronos to disclose protected trade secret information. While the District Court sustained nearly all of these objections, the Third Circuit found that the District Court had abused its discretion in limiting the scope of the subpoena to documents pertaining to certain of the assessment tests.|$|R
25|$|Wright, {{who was one}} of Thomas' {{subordinates}} at <b>the</b> <b>EEOC</b> {{until he}} fired her, told Senate Judiciary Committee staff that Thomas had repeatedly made comments to her much like those he allegedly made to Hill, including pressuring her for dates, asking her the size of her breasts, and frequently commenting on the anatomy of other women. Wright said that after she turned down Thomas for a date, Thomas began to express discontent with her work and eventually fired her. Thomas said that he fired Wright for poor performance and for using a homophobic epithet.|$|E
25|$|In 1990, President George H. W. Bush {{nominated}} Thomas {{for a seat}} on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. He {{served in}} that role for 16 months and on July 1, 1991, was nominated by Bush to fill Marshall's seat on the United States Supreme Court. Thomas's confirmation hearings were bitter and intensely fought, centering on an accusation that he had sexually harassed attorney Anita Hill, a subordinate at the Department of Education and subsequently at <b>the</b> <b>EEOC.</b> The U.S. Senate ultimately confirmed Thomas by a vote of 52–48.|$|E
25|$|A {{few days}} later, White and her {{immediate}} supervisor, Percy Sharkey, disagreed about which truck should transport White from one location to another. Some {{aspects of this}} conversation are disputed, however later that day Sharkey told Brown that White had been insubordinate. Brown immediately suspended White without pay. White invoked internal grievance procedures. Those procedures led Burlington to conclude that White had not been insubordinate. Burlington reinstated White to her position and awarded her back pay for the 37 days she was suspended. White filed an additional retaliation charge with <b>the</b> <b>EEOC</b> based on the suspension.|$|E
5000|$|As EEOC Chairman, Casellas led broad {{changes in}} the way the Commission does business, {{including}} streamlining its case-handling system, expanding the use of alternative dispute resolution, forging a new and productive partnership with nearly 100 state and local fair employment practices agencies, and developing practical policy guidelines on applying the EEO laws to the workplace. [...] For his personal intervention in successfully resolving <b>the</b> <b>EEOC's</b> historically acrimonious internal labor-management disputes and in transforming the agency into a model of labor-management partnership, the agency received a [...] "Hammer of Reinvention" [...] from Vice President Al Gore.|$|R
5000|$|Second, the law {{provides}} that {{the definition of}} disability “shall be construed in favor of broad coverage of individuals under this Act, to the maximum extent permitted {{by the terms of}} this Act.” It retains the terms “substantially limits” and [...] "major life activities" [...] from the original ADA definition of [...] "disability," [...] but makes clear that Congress intended the terms to impose less- demanding standards than those enunciated by the Supreme Court in the Toyota case. It also states that <b>the</b> <b>EEOC's</b> regulatory definition of [...] "substantially limits" [...] was overly strict.|$|R
30|$|The {{baseline}} specification defines morbidly obese {{individuals as}} {{anyone with a}} BMI of 40 or greater (instead of 35 or greater) for two reasons. First, <b>the</b> <b>EEOC’s</b> definition of severe obesity (which the agency asserts is a disability {{for the purposes of}} the ADA) is double normal body weight, and a BMI of 35 is less than double normal body weight. Second, physicians classify all individuals with a BMI of 40 or greater as morbidly obese; physicians only classify individuals with a BMI between 35 and 40 as morbidly obese if they have significant comorbidities associated with their weight.|$|R
25|$|While {{training}} at the Milwaukee Police Academy, Bembenek met and became close with another female trainee, Judy Zess. At a rock concert in May 1980, Zess was arrested for smoking marijuana. Bembenek's subsequent dismissal from the police department on August 25 stemmed from her involvement in filing a false report on Zess' arrest. After being fired, Bembenek discovered photos of Milwaukee police officers dancing nude and semi nude at a party sponsored by a local bar. She took the photos to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission arguing that while she was fired for a minor infraction, the photos proved that other police officers committing more serious violations were not punished. <b>The</b> <b>EEOC</b> encouraged Bembenek to file a discrimination report with the Milwaukee Police Department internal affairs division. In the months following her firing, Bembenek briefly worked as a waitress at the Playboy Club in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin.|$|E
500|$|Attorney General Griffin Bell, after {{speaking}} with President Jimmy Carter, stated, [...] "my general {{view is that}} affirmative action has been enhanced", and that such programs {{in the federal government}} would continue as planned. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Chair Eleanor Holmes Norton told the media [...] "that the Bakke case has not left me with any duty to instruct <b>the</b> <b>EEOC</b> staff to do anything different".|$|E
2500|$|Between 1965 and 1972, Title VII lacked any strong {{enforcement}} provisions. Instead, the Equal Employment Opportunity [...] Commission {{was authorized}} only to investigate external claims of discrimination. <b>The</b> <b>EEOC</b> could then refer cases to the Justice Department for litigation if reasonable cause was found. <b>The</b> <b>EEOC</b> documented {{the nature and}} magnitude of discriminatory employment practices, the first study of this kind done.|$|E
50|$|Judge Eagan’s 71-page {{decision}} followed two earlier {{trials and}} prior “Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law” issued in August 2004. <b>The</b> <b>EEOC’s</b> lawsuit was joined with a related civil action {{which had been}} filed by the workers on their own behalf alleging false imprisonment, minimum wage violations under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), deceit, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. (Chellen et al. and EEOC v. John Pickle Company, Inc., Case No. 02-CV-0085-CVE-FHM File and 02-CV-0979-CVE-FHM Consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma). The total damages awarded by the Court addressed the claims in both the government’s suit and the private action.|$|R
5000|$|Second, [...] "a 1980 {{state law}} that tied public safety officers' {{disability}} benefits to {{the age at which}} they were hired" [...] caused an age discrimination complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) in 1992 which eventually led to a 1995 class action lawsuit against CalPERS and other state and local agencies. In January 2003, CalPERS settled the suit by agreeing to pay $50 million in retroactive benefits and $200 million in future benefits to 1,700 officers; the settlement [...] "was by far the largest in <b>the</b> <b>EEOC's</b> history". Furthermore, CalPERS agreed to not use an age-based formula in the future, which [...] "basically nullified" [...] the 1980 state law.|$|R
5000|$|In September 2010, {{the case}} of Miniter v. Moon et al. and <b>the</b> related <b>EEOC</b> {{complaint}} was settled. Miniter refused to disclose the terms, but said [...] "I am very, {{very happy with the}} equitable and just result." ...|$|R
2500|$|On May 26, 2004, Pyett, O’ Connell and Phillips each filed age {{discrimination}} charges with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. [...] After reviewing the evidence, <b>the</b> <b>EEOC</b> dismissed {{each of the}} men’s complaints. [...] Per the agency’s practice when its investigation does not substantiate a charge that has been made, <b>the</b> <b>EEOC</b> issued each man a letter of Dismissal and Notice of Rights. [...] The letters notified the men {{of their right to}} file a lawsuit in court.|$|E
2500|$|Note: a {{workplace}} harassment complainant must file with <b>the</b> <b>EEOC</b> {{and receive a}} [...] "right to sue" [...] clearance, before they can file a lawsuit against a company in federal court.|$|E
2500|$|The ADA {{defines a}} covered {{disability}} {{as a physical}} or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, a history of having such an impairment, or being regarded as having such an impairment. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) was charged with interpreting the 1990 law with regard to discrimination in employment. <b>The</b> <b>EEOC</b> developed regulations limiting an individual’s impairment to one that [...] "severely or significantly restricts" [...] a major life activity. The ADAAA directed <b>the</b> <b>EEOC</b> to amend its regulations and replace [...] "severely or significantly" [...] with [...] "substantially limits", a more lenient standard.|$|E
5000|$|National Association of State Workforce Agencies (NASWA) in {{collaboration}} with DOL partners, including ODEP’s America’s Heroes at Work project, JAN provided training at <b>the</b> DOL <b>EEOC</b> Forum {{as well as at}} the national NASWA Conference. JAN also gave a teleconference presentation on [...] "ADA Update" [...] for the Equal Opportunity Committee meeting of NASWA.|$|R
30|$|In {{expanding}} {{the coverage of}} the ADA in 2008, Congress did not specifically identify obesity or any other medical condition as a covered disability. 3 Nonetheless, Congress’s broad command has led the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) to revise its official ADA guidance substantially. With respect to obesity, the prior guidance stated that obesity would only be a covered disability under the ADA in “rare circumstances,” but the current guidance now states that “severe obesity, which has been defined as body weight more than 100  % over the norm…is clearly an impairment” (<b>EEOC</b> 2009). <b>The</b> <b>EEOC’s</b> definition of severe obesity roughly equates to the medical definition of morbid obesity, which is a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or more (the BMI of a normal-weight person ranges from 18.5 to less than 25). Congress’s broad command also appears to have convinced federal courts to view the claims of morbidly obese individuals seeking the ADA’s protections more favorably.|$|R
30|$|Since <b>the</b> first <b>EEOC</b> lawsuit came in late 2010, and BRFSS {{observations}} are taken throughout the year, any effects of EEOC enforcement {{should be seen}} most clearly in the data during the post- 2010 period, not the post- 2009 period. A robustness check in Table  4 utilizes the recorded month of the BRFSS interview for each respondent and tests the post-September 2010 effect (instead of the post- 2010 effect) and finds very similar results.|$|R
