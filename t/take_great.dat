5|$|A prophecy {{says that}} Troy will not fall if Troilus lives into adulthood. So the goddess Athena {{encourages}} the Greek warrior Achilles to seek him out {{early in the}} Trojan War. The youth is known to <b>take</b> <b>great</b> delight in his horses. Achilles ambushes him and his sister Polyxena when he has ridden with her for water from a well in the Thymbra – an area outside Troy {{where there is a}} temple of Apollo.|$|E
5|$|Elves {{have few}} children, {{as a rule}} (Fëanor and Nerdanel were an exception, conceiving seven sons), and there are {{relatively}} sizeable intervals between each child (but see below for notes on Elvish birth rates in Middle-earth versus in Aman). They are soon preoccupied with other pleasures; their libido wanes and they focus their interests elsewhere, like the arts. Nonetheless, they <b>take</b> <b>great</b> delight in the union of love, and they cherish the days of bearing and raising children as the happiest days of their lives.|$|E

5|$|Johnson's {{publications}} {{were rarely}} luxury goods: he priced his merchandise competitively, but always within {{the reach of}} the middle class, the audience he most wanted to serve. One way that he reduced costs was by printing texts in the provinces and then importing them to London; many of Priestley's works, for example, were printed locally in Birmingham. Johnson did not <b>take</b> <b>great</b> care with the printing of many of his books; they are full of errors and poorly bound. But as they were often printed extremely quickly to respond to a particular event, this was expected by his contemporaries.|$|E
5|$|Hundreds of men {{volunteered for}} smoke jumping, showing their {{willingness}} to <b>take</b> <b>great</b> personal risks. When fire was detected by a lookout, smoke jumpers were flown directly to the site and dropped by parachute to quickly contain and extinguish the fire. From base camps scattered through the forests of Montana, Idaho and Oregon, the men were flown as many as 200 miles to fire sites, carrying firefighting tools and a two-day supply of K-rations. For larger fires, additional men, supplies and food were airdropped to expand the effort. Up to 240 CPS men served in this specialized program. One of the smokejumping schools was at Camp Paxson in Montana.|$|E
5|$|With the {{strength}} of the Crusaders now heavily reduced since Hattin, Saladin launches the Siege of Jerusalem to free it from Crusader control. However, the Saracens must <b>take</b> <b>great</b> care not to destroy the Monasteries within the holy city, and must also deal with Templar and Hospitaller encampments that flank the city. The Siege is successful, the Holy Land now once again in Saracen control, spare the Crusader states of Tiberias, Tyre and Ascalon, but are subsequently captured by Saladin. When the Pope is informed of the Crusader defeat in the Middle East, the Third Crusade is launched, threatening to undo Saladin's conquest. The final missions tasks the player with defending a heavily fortified Citadel from constant Crusader attacks, most notably King Richard of England, as well as constructing the Great Mosque of Samarra, the unique Wonder building available to the Saracens in game.|$|E

25|$|Tagalog profanity {{can refer}} {{to a wide range}} of offensive, blasphemous, and taboo words or {{expressions}} in the Tagalog language of the Philippines. Due to Filipino culture, expressions which may sound benign when translated back to English can cause great offense; while some expressions English speakers might <b>take</b> <b>great</b> offense to can sound benign to a Tagalog speaker. Filipino, the national language of the Philippines, is the standard register of Tagalog, so as such the terms Filipino profanity and Filipino swear words are sometimes also employed.|$|E
25|$|Upon its inception, the Indian Army {{inherited}} the British Army's organisational structure, {{which is still}} maintained today. Therefore, like its predecessor, an Indian infantry regiment's responsibility is not to undertake field operations but to provide battalions and well trained personnel to the field formations. As such {{it is common to}} find battalions of the same regiment spread across several brigades, divisions, corps, commands, and even theatres. Like its British and Commonwealth counterparts, troops enlisted within the regiment are immensely loyal, <b>take</b> <b>great</b> pride in the regiment to which they are assigned, and generally spend their entire career within the regiment.|$|E

25|$|Icelanders {{are proud}} of their Viking {{heritage}} and Icelandic language and <b>take</b> <b>great</b> care to preserve their traditions. Modern Icelandic remains close to the Old Norse spoken in the Viking Age. For example, the word for computer (an introduced object) is tölva which combines the ancient terms for number and seer. Until the Christianisation of Iceland, many traditional Viking beliefs were strongly held, remnants of which remain today. According to a 2005 New York Times article, the majority of Icelanders either believe in elves or are unwilling to rule out their existence. There are a number of accounts of roads that have been re-routed and building plans redesigned or abandoned to avoid disturbing rocks where elves are said to live.|$|E
25|$|If {{the weights}} have {{a method of}} quick release, they can provide a useful rescue mechanism: they can be dropped in an {{emergency}} to provide an instant increase in buoyancy which should return the diver to the surface. Dropping weights {{increases the risk of}} barotrauma and decompression sickness due to the possibility of an uncontrollable ascent to the surface. This risk can only be justified when the emergency is life-threatening or the risk of decompression sickness is small, {{as is the case in}} free diving and scuba diving when the dive is well short of the no-decompression limit for the depth. Often divers <b>take</b> <b>great</b> care to ensure the weights are not dropped accidentally, and heavily weighted divers may arrange their weights so subsets of the total weight can be dropped individually, allowing for a somewhat more controlled emergency ascent.|$|E
