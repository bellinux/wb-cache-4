In order to constrain peptides into well-defined structures, nature often relies on the formation of disulfides between cysteine residues. Chemists have leveraged alternative chemoselective reactions to constrain peptides into defined folded conformations. <b>Chemoselective</b> <b>cyclization</b> strategies typically require extensive synthetic manipulation or the use of conditions which are incompatible with biological systems. This work encompasses the development of alternative peptide cyclization strategies that can be utilized under conditions compatible with biological systems. The strategies we have focused on offer the possibility of implementing cross-linking in a dynamic and reversible manner in aqueous solutions. We have chosen {{to take advantage of the}} bioorthogonal and reversible nature of Schiff base formation in the development of bioorthogonal and dynamic side chain cross-linking. We have demonstrated that an oxime formed by a cyclization reaction between aminooxy- and aldehyde-functionalized side chains in peptide sequences proceeds rapidly and in high yield. These cross-links have been shown to affect peptide folding and are capable of dynamic covalent exchange. Oxime cross-links have been shown to stabilize a model protein-protein interaction, with a dependence upon the sequence context and structure of the cross-link formed. Analysis of a high-resolution structure of the cross-linked oligomer demonstrates that the oxime side chain cross-link is well accommodated into an α-helical fold. We have also demonstrated that the product distribution of a cross-linking reaction in which multiple cross-linked regioisomers can be generated is dependent upon the folded state of the peptide at the time of cross-link formation. An alternative strategy which employs the use of an intermolecular cyclization between a bifunctionalized peptide and dialdehyde functionalized small molecules has also been explored. The intermolecular cyclization strategy has been shown to affect peptide folded structure and be capable of dynamic covalent exchange. Intermolecular cyclization offers a generally applicable and convergent manner to synthesize multiple cross-linked species in a combinatorial manner. This strategy has then been employed to template formation of different cross-linked structures based on the presence of an expressed protein receptor. ...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this course}} of {{research}} was to further {{our knowledge of the}} mechanism of catalysts at the molecular level – thence, to form predictions and suggestions toward rational catalyst design. The first part of this work deals with catalysis on silver. Although well-known in selective oxidation, the potential of silver for chemoselective hydrogenation was only recently realised. Here, the hydrogenation of acrolein and crotonaldehyde was studied in ultra-high vacuum on the Ag(111) model catalyst. The delicate hydrogenation of both aldehydes to the desired unsaturated alcohol was demonstrated for the first time by temperature programmed reaction (TPR). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and near edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) showed unambiguously that the orientation of the C=C and C=O bonds with respect to the surface critically influences the outcome of the hydrogenation reaction. Using a similar approach, the hydrogenation chemistry of crotonaldehyde was studied on sulphur-modified Cu(111), to rationalise why sulphur enhances the selectivity of practical copper catalysts in the hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde to crotyl alcohol. The presence of sulphur (normally a poison) transformed the otherwise inert Cu(111) surface into an excellent catalyst for crotyl alcohol formation. A combination of TPR, XPS and NEXAFS showed that once again, the geometry of the adsorbed aldehyde was crucial in determining selectivity. In <b>this</b> case, the <b>chemoselective</b> reaction itself was observed not just by TPR, but also in situ by XPS and NEXAFS.

Catalysis with pyridinium salts, as well as with DBU or DABCO are discussed, as is the thermal reaction of imidazole carbamates with carboxylic acids to provide esters. The application of a protic solvent-mediated cycloisomerization approach to two isomers of benzindolizinone - a relatively unstudied heterocyclic system - and the syntheses of two Erythrina alkaloids are also discussed. Chapter 1 provides an overview of the fundamental importance of the carbonyl group in the chemistry of life, as well as in the service of man. Key processes through which these versatile groups react are illustrated with an emphasis on the chemistry of esters. The chapter concludes with a survey of the application of carbonylimidazoles as acyl donors from their first development by Staab to the present. Through another line of inquiry, it was discovered that imidazole carbamates and ureas are chemoselective esterification and amidation reagents. The optimization, substrate scope, and mechanism of esterification and amidation of carboxylic acids mediated by imidazole-based reagents are discussed in Chapter 2. The innate reactivity of carbonyl imidazole reagents with a range of nucleophiles is also explored. Following this initial discovery, it was found that pyridinium salts greatly enhance the reactivity of carbonylimidazole derivatives as acylation reargents for esterification and amidation. Chapter 3 details the development of this mode of catalysis and outlines a mechanistic proposal in which pyridinium salts act as both Brønsted acid and nucleophilic catalysts. Finally, the scope of this technology in the synthesis of difficult to access oxazolidinones, as well as esters and amides, is discussed. This work was executed in partnership with Tingting Fu. Drawing on the possibility that carbonylazole acyl donors could be potentiated through nucleophilic catalysis, a DBU-catalyzed N-acylation of indoles and oxazolidinones was devised.

40|$|Allylic {{alcohols}} and functionalized anilines are industrially valuable flavouring and fragrance {{compounds and}} important intermediates for pharmaceuticals, polymers and other fine chemicals. These compounds can be synthesised via chemoselective reduction of unsaturated aldehydes and nitro compounds. Reduction of the olefinic group yields saturated aldehydes and nitro compounds, whereas hydrogenation of the carbonyl and nitro group produce allylic alcohols and unsaturated amines. Typically, this reduction is performed under high hydrogen pressure conditions with supported metal catalysts, alternatively transfer hydrogenation with an alcohol as hydride donor and a Lewis acid catalyst can be employed. The former process is most widely applicable, {{but is not}} straightforward since olefins are often preferentially reduced, due to thermodynamic and kinetic reasons. To direct selectivity towards the desired products there is thus a strong motivation to develop chemoselective supported metal reduction catalysts. Platinum group metals (Pt, Pd, Ir, Rh, Os and Ru; PGMs) are typically used, but often require complex doping schemes. Silver on the contrary, has a very high intrinsic chemoselectivity towards unsaturated products in reductions of polyfunctional molecules and will thus be explored in <b>this</b> work as <b>chemoselective</b> reduction catalyst. Metal nanoparticle catalysts used for the chemoselective reduction are typically supported on porous materials like silica, alumina and carbon. These supports stabilise the metal nanoparticles preventing their aggregation and hence loss in activity and/or selectivity. Though more interestingly the pores of these support {{can also be used}} to control the size of nanoparticles via pore confined synthesis strategies. In <b>this</b> work, <b>chemoselective</b> hydrogenation with a commonly used silver on silica catalyst is investigated first, whereafter the development of a new chemoselective silver catalyst on an innovative material is described and the remarkable transfer hydrogenation catalysing power of this support. In the first experimental chapter (Chapter 2), the chemoselective reduction of 4 -nitrostyrene using a silver on silica catalyst, prepared via the standard incipient wetness (IWI) procedure, is explored in detail. In IWI a porous support is filled with a metal precursor solution that equals the pore volume of the support. After drying and calcination, the final supported metal nanoparticle catalyst is obtained. In contrast to the typically used bulk averaging or spatially resolving characterisation techniques, in this work optical microscopy is used as the most important characterisation technique. Optical microscopy proved to be a convenient tool to directly interlink structural and compositional information and hydrogenation performance of individual support particles. This novel correlative imaging approach revealed for the first time how incipient wetness impregnation led to 10 -fold variations in silver loading between individual submillimetre-sized silica support granules. Furthermore, this heterogeneity had a profound impact on the catalytic performance: 100 -fold interparticle variations in normalized catalytic performance were discovered for the chemoselective 4 -nitrostyrene reduction between granules of the same batch. This detailed study revealed the optimal silver loading and based on this information the normalized yield was increased by 38 %. To unravel the origin of this interparticle heterogeneity the impregnation process was dissected into the individual synthesis steps (impregnation, drying & calcination) and the pre-impregnated support, and investigated in detail using optical microscopy (Chapter 3). Examination of the influence of each elementary step on the resulting silver distribution pointed out that every step introduces a minimal degree of interparticle heterogeneity, but the optimised drying procedure has the largest impact on the heterogeneity. More specifically, the position of a support granule in the stagnant drying bed has a large influence on the resulting colour and thus silver distribution. Moving from a static to a fluidized bed drying resulted in an improved homogeneity in silver loading on the different support granules. This optimised drying procedure is easy to implement in the lab and on even larger scales. The importance of generating well-defined and stable silver nanoparticles was an incentive to look into pore confinement in metal organic frameworks (MOFs). These results are described in Chapter 4. Silver nanoparticles were successfully synthesized by pore confinement in UiO- 66, a widely used zirconium-based metal-organic framework. A recyclable 10 wt% Ag/UiO- 66 catalyst reached complete conversion of cinnamaldehyde after 6 h and 50 bar of H 2 with 66 % selectivity for cinnamyl alcohol in the inert solvent N,N-dimethylacetamide (140 °C, 25 mg catalyst, 2 mol% Ag). Surprisingly, pure UiO- 66 without silver reached complete conversion with > 90 % selectivity after 24 h at 120 °C (25 mg catalyst, 8 mol% Zr) in isopropyl alcohol solvent, even in absence of H 2. The Lewis acid sites of the Zr-support catalyse transfer hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde with isopropyl alcohol, a procedure called Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. The substrate scope of this MPV reduction was successfully extended to citral and carvone, two α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds that are harder to reduce selectively. Further catalyst optimisation was possible via the introduction of a NO 2 -functional group into the UiO- 66 linker, increasing the Lewis acidity. Based on the high activity and chemoselectivity in the reduction of unsaturated carbonyl compounds using the Lewis acid Zr-sites in UiO- 66, a large pore Zr-based MOF, MOF- 808 -P, was explored as MPV reduction catalyst with isopropyl alcohol as solvent and hydride donor. These large pores of MOF- 808 -P facilitate the formation of the six-membered ring transition state and more importantly, the Zr-atom in the MOF-cluster is undercoordinated which should lead to an increased number and strength of the Lewis acid sites compared to UiO- 66. MOF- 808 -P catalysed MPV reduction obtained already 99 % cinnamyl alcohol yield after only 2 h (120 °C, 20 mg catalyst, 8 mol% Zr) (Chapter 5). The highly active MOF- 808 -P was furthermore a good catalyst for the selective reduction of more challenging substrates such as carvone and β-ionone. The activity for the former was 20 -fold increased with respect to UiO- 66. Two strategies were successfully used to shift the equilibrium reaction towards the desired allylic alcohol products: 1) evaporation of formed acetone when using isopropyl alcohol and 2) the use of the more strongly reducing 1 -indanol. Via these approaches the carveol yield was increased to > 70 %. Preface	I Abstract	III Samenvatting	VII List of Abbreviations	X Table of Contents	XI 1.

40|$|The thesis {{entitled}} “Design and Development of Synthetic Methods using Metal-mediated and Metal-free Redox Reactions: Novel C-H Activations, Reductions and Oxidative Transformations” {{is presented}} in 4 chapters Chapter 1; Iodine catalyzed amination of benzoxazoles: efficient metal free route to 2 -aminobenzoxazoles under mild conditions. The Chapter 1 of this thesis describes iodine catalyzed C-H activation of benzoxazole with primary and secondary amines to form oxidative aminated products. Selective C-H oxidation is a frontline area of modern chemical research as it offers the opportunities to new avenues and more direct synthetic strategies for the synthesis of complex organic molecules. 1 In this context, transition metals such as palladium copper, nickel etc, are used extensively for the functional group directed C-H activation, and thus provides new, rapid, low-cost, and environmentally benign protocols {{for the construction of}} new chemical bonds. 2 During the past two decades iodine and hypervalent iodine have been focus of great attention as they provide mild, chemoselective and environmentally benign strategies in contrast to toxic metal oxidants. 3 In this chapter, a facile metal-free route of oxidative amination of benzoxazole with secondary or primary amines in the presence of catalytic amount of iodine (5 mol%) in aq tert-butyl hydroperoxide (1 equiv) and AcOH (1. 1 equiv) at ambient temperature, under the solvent-free reaction condition is presented. This user-friendly method to form C-N bonds produces tert-butanol and water as the by-products, which are environmentally benign. A wide range of benzoxazole derivatives containing electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups were coupled with both primary and secondary amines (Scheme 1). Application of this methodology is demonstrated by synthesizing therapeutically active benzoxazoles by reacting 5 -chloro- 7 -methylbenzoxazole with N-methylpiperazine and N-ethylhomopiperazine to obtain corresponding N-aminatedbenzaxozoles, which exhibit antidiarrhetic activity (Scheme 2). 4 Scheme 2 Chapter 2 : NIS catalyzed reactions. amidation of acetophenones and oxidative amination of propiophenones Chapter 2 is divided in to 2 parts. Part 1 describes the synthesis of α-ketoamides by using acetophenone and secondary amine in the presence of N-iodosuccinamide and TBHP in acetonitrile at room temperature, whereas Part 2 reveals the synthesis of 2 -aminoketones by reacting aryl alkyl ketones and suitable secondary amine in the presence of NIS and TBHP. Part 1 : Oxidative amidation, synthesis of α-ketoamide: Alpha α-ketoamides are important intermediates in organic synthesis that are present in a variety of natural products, and pharmaceutically active compounds. Herein, a mild and efficient conversion of acetophenones to α-ketoamide is documented by using aq. TBHP and N-iodosuccinamide (NIS) as a catalyst, at ambient temperature. This amidation reaction was found to be versatile as several aetophenone derivitives containing electron-withdrawing and electron-donating substituents underwent a facile amidation. It was also found that acetyl derivatives of heterocylic compounds could be easily converted to their corresponding ketoamides (few examples are shown in Scheme 3). 5 Scheme 3 Part 2 of Chapter 2 narrates a novel amination of propiophenone and its derivatives catalysed by NIS in the presence of TBHP to furnish their corresponding 2 -aminoketone derivatives (Scheme 4). These derivatives are ubiquitous scaffolds that are present {{in a wide variety of}} therapeutic agents. Some of these compounds are used in the treatment of depression, smoking cessation, as monoamine uptake inhibitors, rugs for cancer. They are photoinitiators, precursors to β-aminoalcohols, such as pseudoephedrine analogues. 2 -Aminoacetophenone analogues are also important intermediates for the formation of several heterocyclic compounds and are active moieties in several important drugs such as ifenprodil, Scheme 4. Chapter 3 : Efficient oxidation of primary azides to nitriles This Chapter is divided in to 2 parts, which presents the oxidation of primary azides to their corresponding nitriles. Part 1 : An Efficient oxidation of primary azides catalyzed by copper iodide: a convenient method for the synthesis of nitriles In Part 1, an efficient oxidation of primary azides catalyzed by copper iodide to their corresponding nitriles is reported. Herein, the oxidation of primary azide to nitrile is performed using catalytic amount of copper iodide, and aq TBHP in water at 100 ° C. This methodology is compatible with a wide range of primary benzylic azides that contain electron-donating and electron-withdrawing functional groups. The oxidation was found to be selective and a number of oxidizable functional groups were well-tolerated during the reaction conditions (few examples are shown in Scheme 5). 6 Scheme 6 Furthermore, oxidation of secondary azides furnished the corresponding ketones in excellent yields (Scheme 6). 6 In the Part 2 of Chapter 3, a non-metal catalysed oxidation of primary azides to nitriles at ambient temperature is reported. This part reveals the oxidation of primary azides to nitriles by employing catalytic amounts of KI (25 mol%), DABCO (25 mol%) and aq. TBHP (3 equiv., 70 % solution in water). This reaction provides a good selectivity, as double and triple bonds were not oxidized under the reaction conditions. Additionally, chemoselective oxidation of benzylicazides against aliphatic azides increases the potential application of the present method (Scheme 7). 7 Chapter 4 : Chemoeselective reduction of olefins Part 1 : Iron chloride catalysed aerobic reduction of olefins using aqueous hydrazine at ambient temperature Chapter 4 describes the reduction olefins and acetylenes, which {{is presented in}} two Parts. Part 1 documents utility of hydrazine (1. 5 equiv) for the chemoselective reduction of nonpolarised carbon-carbon bond using iron catalysts. In <b>this</b> part, a <b>chemoselective</b> reduction of alkenes and alkynes in the presence of a variety of reducible functional groups is demonstrated (Scheme 8). The highlight of the present method is that the reduction proceeds well at room temperature and requires only 1. 5 equiv of hydrazine hydrate. The olefin reduction by hydrazine depends upon the controlled release of diimide during the reduction. Generally, metal catalyzed reduction of olefins employ a large excess of hydrazine (10 - 20 equiv), which might be attributed to uncontrolled release of diimide during the reduction. 8 Scheme 8 Part 2 : Guanidine catalyzed aerobic reduction: a selective aerobic hydrogenation of olefins using aqueous hydrazine In Chapter 4, part 2, organocatalytic generation of diimide and its utility to reduce the double bonds is presented. Generation of diimide in situ by using organo catalysts and its use for the reduction of carbon-carbon double bond is one of the interesting topics in organic chemistry. It has been shown in this part of the thesis that the reduction of olefin at room temperature can be efficiently performed by using 10 mol% of guanidine nitrate, 2 equiv of aqueous hydrazine in oxygen atmosphere. This method tolerates a variety of reducible functional groups such as nitro, azido, and bromo and protective groups such as methyl ethers, benzyl ethers, and Cbz groups. It is also shown that terminal olefin can be selectively reduced in the presence of internal olefin (Scheme 9). Unlike other methods that employ diimide strategy, the present method is shown to be efficient in reducing substrates those contain internal double bonds such as cinnamyl alcohol and its derivative...|$|R
