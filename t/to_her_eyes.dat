5|$|Krug {{was born}} Judith Fingeret in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on March 15, 1940. Her {{interest}} in {{freedom of speech}} was fostered from an early age. She recalled reading a book about sex education under the covers in her bedroom with a flashlight {{at the age of}} 12. Her mother found her and asked what she was doing. When she held up the book, her mother allowed her to continue reading and told her to turn on the bedroom light so she could read properly and avoid damage <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E
5|$|The woman's {{left ear}} is set, {{according}} to art historian Norbert Schneider, unnaturally high and far back, parallel <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> {{rather than to}} her nose; this position is probably an artistic device used to continue {{the flow of the}} diagonal line of the veil's inner-right wing. In the 15th century, veils were normally worn for modesty, to hide the sensuality of the flesh. In this work the veil has the opposite effect; the woman's face is framed by the headdress to draw attention to her beauty.|$|E
25|$|In 1956, Baez {{first heard}} Martin Luther King, Jr. speak about nonviolence, {{civil rights and}} social change which brought tears <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> Several years later, the two became friends, with Baez {{participating}} {{in many of the}} Civil Rights Movement demonstrations that Dr. King helped organize.|$|E

60|$|Rosemary put her {{arm around}} the thin little form and drew the child close <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> <b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> were very beautiful--her touch so tender that Una found courage.|$|R
500|$|Midorikawa {{attributed}} {{the success of}} Hotarubi no Mori e {{to the quality of}} the story, noting even those readers of the original manga who were critical of her artwork were drawn to read the story from start to finish. [...] She speculated that hiding Gin's face behind a mask had helped mitigate some of the artistic issues for which her earlier work had been criticized. The intense pressure experienced by Midorikawa early in her manga writing career was relieved as a result of the positive feedback she received upon her success with Hotarubi no Mori e. [...] In 2011, she expressed excitement for the new anime film and having the manga reprinted in a new short story collection, remarking that her attempts to write about her feelings and recent experiences in relation to Hotarubi no Mori e brought tears <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> [...] She described the story as a [...] "precious work" [...] that had help her build social connections.|$|E
500|$|Rowland has {{acknowledged}} {{on several occasions}} that although she loved dance music, it was not really the type of music she would record. While in Europe in 2008, she met Guetta {{at one of his}} DJ shows in Southern France and commented that [...] "Listening to him was just crazy." [...] Guetta was playing the instrumental version of [...] "When Love Takes Over". Recalling that it brought tears <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> Rowland remarked, [...] "I felt so much emotion from the track; something happened the first time I heard it, and it was just beautiful. And I remember thinking 'Why is this touching me like this?' You know, it was like there was a kinda soul-tie to it!" [...] Upon meeting Guetta, she asked him for the song so she could write its lyrics. [...] "So I met David and asked him for the track... He gave it to me, and I brought it back here to London, UK and wrote the actual song". At a writing session in a London hotel room, Rowland and songwriting duo Nervo wrote the lyrics and melody over Guetta's backing track. Rowland later joined Guetta and Julie Terry Lefèvre-Han in the recording studio to finish off the song.|$|E
2500|$|In 1972, she {{was still}} performing. Honolulu Star-Bulletin {{columnist}} Ben Wood recalled playing recordings for her featuring Gabby Pahinui, Sonny Chillingworth, Atta Isaacs and Eddie Kamae. [...] He later wrote: [...] "When the music started, Iolani fell silent and a distant look came <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> Then she sprang up and started dancing to the music. I was in awe." ...|$|E
5000|$|Two {{girls in}} San Biagio di Callalta were injured when they handled a booby-trapped marking pen. One nine-year-old lost three fingers and {{suffered}} injuries <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Escape!" [...] exclaimed the lady, as {{she raised}} herself hastily in her chair, while light {{returned}} <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> and life <b>to</b> <b>her</b> cheek; [...] "but ah! Janet, it comes too late." ...|$|R
25|$|Zeus {{then gave}} <b>her</b> the ability <b>to</b> remove <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> The {{purpose of this}} ability is unclear in Diodorus, but other {{versions}} state Lamia's ability <b>to</b> remove <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> came with the gift of prophecy. Zeus did this to appease Lamia in her grief {{over the loss of}} <b>her</b> children and <b>to</b> let <b>her</b> rest since she could not close <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Prosperous now, but deeply {{dissatisfied}} {{with a life}} of material comfort, her marriage in ruins, de Hueck began to feel the promptings of a deeper call through a passage that leaped <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> every time she opened the Bible: [...] "Arise — go... sell all you possess... take up your cross and follow Me." [...] Consulting with various priests and the bishop of the diocese, she began her lay apostolate among the poor.|$|E
2500|$|In Fumi Yomu Onna ( [...] , [...] "Woman {{reading a}} letter"), a woman reads what is almost {{certainly}} a love letter, per the expectations in ukiyo-e. [...] Expectations would also predict the recipient to be a courtesan or young girl, but the woman's shaven eyebrows and teeth blackened with ohaguro show that she is married. [...] She holds the letter close <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> and probably reads it secretly and in low light. [...] The arch in her posture and her squeezing grip on the letter suggest a conflicted emotional state brought on by a likely tangled relationship.|$|E
2500|$|Stella's {{replacement}} Lunafreya {{was conceived}} by Tabata; {{he wanted a}} heroine who would properly portray the darker and more somber elements of the rewritten story of Final Fantasy XV. Lunafreya was described as the [...] "keystone" [...] linking the narratives of Final Fantasy XV, Kingsglaive and Brotherhood. While {{she did not have}} an active role in Kingsglaive, her character strength was conveyed through a single-minded determination. During the design process, it was decided that Lunafreya would assume and accept responsibility from a young age, putting her in direct contrast with Noctis; this required Lunafreya to be older than Noctis, which influenced elements of her character design. According to Tabata, the relationship between Noctis and Lunafreya was not a typical love story despite their being engaged. He also defined Lunafreya's personality as being stronger than either Stella or Noctis. Lunafreya was designed by Naora. Her appearance was defined by Tabata as [...] "strong and heroic", which would be conveyed by her expressions and actions. Lunafreya was designed to give off the look of a strong-willed woman. To achieve this, the designers focused on the shape of her eyes and mouth, blending her appearance in Final Fantasy XV with that in Kingsglaive so she could project an air of grace and strength even when standing still. Her expressions reflected a notably wide range of emotions born from her goals, which resulted in her expression being [...] "serious and somewhat sad". To convey Lunafreya's strong will and her high-born status through her appearance, Naora consulted a professional hairstylist and makeup artist; the way makeup was applied <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> and mouth was changed accordingly, and her hairstyle was done to resemble [...] "something that would require the assistance of a handmaiden". Care was taken not to make her too prim, so that players could relate more to her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Filling up the dean's place," [...] said Mrs. Proudie. As she spoke, a {{spark of}} the wonted fire {{returned}} <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye,</b> and the bishop felt {{himself to be a}} little less comfortable than before.|$|R

60|$|Maud {{took the}} glass, though with an {{unsteady}} hand, {{and she looked}} a moment at the savages. The {{manner in which the}} instrument brought these wild beings nearer <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye,</b> caused <b>her</b> <b>to</b> shudder, and she was soon satisfied.|$|R

60|$|She raised <b>her</b> hand <b>to</b> <b>her</b> temples. <b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> {{were full}} of an {{undefined}} fear. The words came from her lips in a broken stream.|$|R
60|$|She {{looked up}} at her son, as he stood, keen and soldierly, near <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> <b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> were most wonderfully blue, bluer than forget-me-nots. She seemed to have a certain {{confidence}} in Gerald, and to feel a certain motherly mistrust of him.|$|R
