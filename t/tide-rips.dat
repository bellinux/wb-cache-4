60|$|Indeed my own looking-glass {{told me how}} wan and languishing a Miss M. was pining {{for change}} of scene and air. She rejoiced that Fanny was enjoying herself, rejoiced {{that she was going}} to enjoy herself too. I searched Mrs Bowater's library for views of the sea, but without much reward. So I read over Mr Bowater's Captain Maury--on the winds and monsoons and <b>tide-rips</b> and hurricanes, freshened up my Robinson Crusoe, and dreamed of the Angels with the Vials. In the midst of my packing (and I spread it out for sheer amusement's sake), Mr Crimble called again. He looked nervous, gloomy, and hollow-eyed.|$|E

60|$|Light {{she rode}} in the rude <b>tide-rip,</b> to {{left and right}} she rolled, And the skipper sat on the scuttle-butt and stared at an empty hold.|$|R
60|$|We {{were now}} {{at the mouth of}} the Straits, in a bad stretch of water. Here the Vallejo Straits and the Carquinez Straits rushed {{directly}} at each other. Through the first flowed all the water of Napa River and the great tide-lands; through the second flowed all the water of Suisun Bay and the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers. And where such immense bodies of water, flowing swiftly, clashed together, a terrible <b>tide-rip</b> was produced. To make it worse, the wind howled up San Pablo Bay for fifteen miles and drove in a tremendous sea upon the <b>tide-rip.</b>|$|R
60|$|Daylight, after I {{had been}} four {{hours in the}} water, found me in a parlous {{condition}} in the <b>tide-rips</b> off Mare Island light, where the swift ebbs from Vallejo Straits and Carquinez Straits were fighting with each other, and where, at that particular moment, they were fighting the flood tide setting up against them from San Pablo Bay. A stiff breeze had sprung up, and the crisp little waves were persistently lapping into my mouth, and I was beginning to swallow salt water. With my swimmer's knowledge, I knew the end was near. And then the boat came--a Greek fisherman running in for Vallejo; and again I had been saved from John Barleycorn by my constitution and physical vigour.|$|E
60|$|Next I {{discovered}} that I was very weary and very cold, and quite sober, and that I didn't {{in the least}} want to be drowned. I {{could make out the}} Selby Smelter on the Contra Costa shore and the Mare Island lighthouse. I started to swim for the Solano shore, but was too weak and chilled, and made so little headway, and at the cost of such painful effort, that I gave it up and contented myself with floating, now and then giving a stroke to keep my balance in the <b>tide-rips</b> which were increasing their commotion {{on the surface of the}} water. And I knew fear. I was sober now, and I didn't want to die. I discovered scores of reasons for living. And the more reasons I discovered, the more liable it seemed that I was going to drown anyway.|$|E
60|$|Persuading {{his father}} to advance the capital, he went into {{business}} and keen and successful business he made of it, devoting his afternoons whole-souled to it, while his partner devoted the mornings. The early evenings he spent socially, but, as the hour grew to nine or ten, an irresistible restlessness overcame him and he disappeared from the haunts of men until the next afternoon. Friends and acquaintances thought that {{he spent much of}} his time in sport. And they were right, though they never would have dreamed {{of the nature of the}} sport, even if they had seen him running coyotes in night-chases over the hills of Mill Valley. Neither were the schooner captains believed when they reported seeing, on cold winter mornings, a man swimming in the <b>tide-rips</b> of Raccoon Straits or in the swift currents between Goat island and Angel Island miles from shore.|$|E
6000|$|His aunt looked doubtful. [...] "You {{have never}} been so far with the sloop unless Jake was with you; and isn't there a nasty <b>tide-rip</b> somewhere? Still, I don't know what I shall do unless I get the flour." ...|$|R
60|$|The acute policy dictating these {{movements}} was sufficiently vindicated at daybreak, {{by the sight}} of a long sleek on the sea directly and lengthwise ahead, smooth as oil, and resembling in the pleated watery wrinkles bordering it, the polished metallic-like marks of some swift <b>tide-rip,</b> at the mouth of a deep, rapid stream.|$|R
6000|$|... "Qat! Marawa! {{look down}} upon us; smooth the sea for us two, that I may go safely on the sea. Beat down {{for me the}} crests of the tide-rip; let the <b>tide-rip</b> settle down away from me; beat it down level that it may sink and roll away, and I may come to a quiet landing-place." ...|$|R
60|$|Fallible and frail, {{a bit of}} pulsating, jelly-like life--it is all I am. About me are {{the great}} natural forces--colossal menaces, Titans of destruction, unsentimental monsters that have less concern for me than I have for the grain of sand I crush under my foot. They have no concern at all for me. They do not know me. They are unconscious, unmerciful, and unmoral. They are the {{cyclones}} and tornadoes, lightning flashes and cloud-bursts, <b>tide-rips</b> and tidal waves, undertows and waterspouts, great whirls and sucks and eddies, earthquakes and volcanoes, surfs that thunder on rock-ribbed coasts and seas that leap aboard the largest crafts that float, crushing humans to pulp or licking them off into the sea and to death--and these insensate monsters {{do not know that}} tiny sensitive creature, all nerves and weaknesses, whom men call Jack London, and who himself thinks he is all right and quite a superior being.|$|E
60|$|I {{was beaten}} and buffeted, smashed under {{by the great}} San Pablo whitecaps, and strangled by the hollow <b>tide-rip</b> waves which flung {{themselves}} into my eyes, nose, and mouth. Then the strange sucks would grip my legs and drag me under, to spout me up in some fierce boiling, where, even as I tried to catch my breath, a great whitecap would crash down upon my head.|$|R
6000|$|Still, {{from his}} {{knowledge}} of those latitudes, cherishing hopes of a breeze, and a fair and fresh one, at any moment, Captain Delano, despite present prospects, buoyantly counted upon bringing the San Dominick safely to anchor ere night. The distance swept over was nothing; since, with a good wind, ten minutes' sailing would retrace more than sixty minutes, drifting. Meantime, one moment turning to mark [...] "Rover" [...] fighting the <b>tide-rip,</b> and the next to see Don Benito approaching, he continued walking the poop.|$|R
6000|$|Our {{good deed}} had cost us dear. A wet scirocco had {{replaced}} the bright norther and saddened all the view. Passing the <b>tide-rip</b> Charybdis, a meeting of currents, which called only for another hand at the wheel; and the castled crag of naughty Scylla, whose town has grown prodigiously, we bade adieu to the 'tower of Pelorus.' Then we shaped our course for the Islands of Æolus, or the Winds, and the Lipari archipelago, all volcanic cones whose outlines were misty as Ossian's spectres. And we plodded through the dreary dull-grey scene of drizzling scirocco-- ...|$|R
60|$|Straight {{out they}} swam, their heads growing smaller and smaller. There was a slight, restless heave to the sea, {{and soon the}} three heads were disappearing behind it with greater frequency. He {{strained}} his eyes {{to keep them in}} sight, and finally fetched the telescope on to the veranda. A squall was making over from the direction of Florida; but then, she and her men laughed at squalls and the white choppy sea at such times. She certainly could swim, he had long since concluded. That came of her training in Hawaii. But sharks were sharks, and he had known of more than one good swimmer drowned in a <b>tide-rip.</b>|$|R
60|$|There now, do you mark that? again thought Captain Delano, {{walking the}} poop. What a donkey I was. This kind gentleman who here sends me his kind compliments, he, but ten minutes ago, dark-lantern in had, was dodging round some old grind-stone in the hold, {{sharpening}} a hatchet for me, I thought. Well, well; these long calms have a morbid {{effect on the}} mind, I've often heard, though I never believed it before. Ha! glancing towards the boat; there's Rover; good dog; a white bone in her mouth. A pretty big bone though, seems to me.--What? Yes, she has fallen afoul of the bubbling <b>tide-rip</b> there. It sets her the other way, too, for the time. Patience.|$|R
6000|$|The salmon tore up-stream, {{the tense}} line cutting {{the water like}} a <b>tide-rip</b> behind him, and the light bamboo bowed to breaking. What {{happened}} thereafter I cannot tell. California swore and prayed, and Portland shouted advice, and I did all three for {{what appeared to be}} half a day, but was in reality a little over a quarter of an hour, and sullenly our fish came home with spurts of temper, dashes head on and sarabands in the air, but home to the bank came he, and the remorseless reel gathered up the thread of his life inch by inch. We landed him in a little bay, and the spring weight in his gorgeous gills checked at eleven and one half pounds. Eleven and one half pounds of fighting salmon! We danced a war-dance on the pebbles, and California caught me round the waist in a hug that went near to breaking my ribs, while he shouted:--"Partner! Partner! This is glory! Now you catch your fish! Twenty-four years I've waited for this!" ...|$|R
60|$|The Aorai swung out a boat smartly, {{into which}} sprang {{half a dozen}} brown-skinned sailors clad only in scarlet loincloths. They took the oars, while in the stern sheets, at the {{steering}} sweep, stood a young man garbed in the tropic white that marks the European. The golden strain of Polynesia betrayed itself in the sun-gilt of his fair skin and cast up golden sheens and lights through the glimmering blue of his eyes. Raoul he was, Alexandre Raoul, youngest son of Marie Raoul, the wealthy quarter-caste, who owned and managed half a dozen trading schooners similar to the Aorai. Across an eddy just outside the entrance, and in and through and over a boiling <b>tide-rip,</b> the boat fought {{its way to the}} mirrored calm of the lagoon. Young Raoul leaped out upon the white sand and shook hands with a tall native. The man's chest and shoulders were magnificent, but the stump of a right arm, beyond the flesh of which the age-whitened bone projected several inches, attested the encounter with a shark that had put an end to his diving days and made him a fawner and an intriguer for small favors.|$|R
60|$|Fortunately, or rather, I should say, providentially, {{the current}} and <b>tide-rip</b> carried me {{to the mouth of}} a river, and, with a great effort, I got into the shoal-water, and finally {{staggered}} out on shore. There was a wood hard by, and thither I dragged myself. The sun was in mid heavens and very warm, and I managed to dry my clothes. I am always most particular to wear the dress of my calling, observing that it has a peculiar and gratifying effect on the minds of the natives. I soon dried my tall hat, which, during the storm, I had attached to my button-hole by a string, and, though it was a good deal battered, I was not without hopes of partially restoring its gloss and air of British respectability. As will be seen, this precaution was, curiously enough, the human means of preserving my life. My hat, my black clothes, my white neck-tie, and the hymn-book I carry would, I was convinced, secure for me a favourable reception among the natives (if of the gentle brown Polynesian type), whom I expected to find on the island.|$|R
60|$|Five thirty! It seemed {{around the}} end of the world for me. We had drifted into a <b>tide-rip</b> about five miles east of Avalon, and in this rough water I had a terrible time trying to hold my fish. When I {{discovered}} that I could hold him--and therefore that he was playing out--then there burst upon me the dazzling hope of actually bringing him to gaff. It is something to fight a fish for more than five hours without one single hope of his capture. I had done that. And now, suddenly, to be fired with hope gave me new strength and spirit to work. The pain in my hands was excruciating. I was burning all over; wet and slippery, and aching in every muscle. These next few minutes seemed longer than all the hours. I found that to put the old strain on the rod made me blind with pain. There was no fun, no excitement, no thrill now. As I labored I could not help marveling at the strange, imbecile pursuits of mankind. Here I was in an agony, absolutely useless. Why did I keep it up? I could not give up, and I concluded I was crazy.|$|R
2500|$|It {{is evident}} that by and large Creelman stands strong in his {{justification}} for the Porfiriato and cannot imagine a more appropriate character than Díaz to have ruled Mexico. Creelman sees Díaz as the epitome of a Mexican: “There is no more heroic, no more picturesque, no more commanding and appealing figure {{in the world than}} Porfirio Díaz, in whose veins leaps the <b>tide-rip</b> of two races and two civilizations.” Even as Díaz had revealed his plans to retire from office three years earlier and then decided to go against his own word, Díaz, according to Creelman’s interpretation, saw himself as a self-sacrificing patriot who thought no one else could rule Mexico better than himself. Díaz believed that the Mexican people demanded he remain in office because they knew no other president would keep the status quo. This begs the question: who were the Mexican people? Did these include Indians? And if most Indians did not participate in politics, how did Díaz conclude that he was loved by them? His logic ran thusly: Indians are naturally lazy and have an indifference for politics, which causes them to either believe that “things are bound to go on well under [...] direction...or that it would be worse than useless to attempt to oppose anything he favored.” Likely, this was part of Creelman’s embellishments to Díaz’s story.|$|R
60|$|Beyond this point, at a {{bend of the}} bight, we anchor a {{few hundred}} feet from the shore, and we command a front view of {{roadstead}} and 'city.' St. George's Bay, the older 'Baie de France,' would be impossible but for the Middle Ground, the Scarcies Bank, and other huge shoals of sand pinned down by rocks which defend the roadstead from the heavy send of the sea. It is supplied with a <b>tide-rip</b> by the Tagrin, Mitomba, Rokel, or Rokelle, the Sá Leone River, which Barbot makes the ancients term Nia (Nia), and which the Timni tribe call Robung Dakell, or Stream of Scales. Hence some identify it with Pliny's 'flumen Bambotum crocodilis et hippopotamis refertum.' Its northern bank is the low Bullom shore, a long flat line of mud and mangrove, on which all the fevers, Tertiana, Quartana, and Co., hold their court. The sea-facing dot is Leopard, anciently Leopold, Island, where it is said a leopard was once seen: it is, however, a headland connected by a sandspit with the leeward-most point of the coast. The Bullom country takes a name after its tribe. A score of years ago I was told they were wild as wild can be: now the chief, Alimami (El-Imám) Sanúsi, hospitably receives white faces at his capital, Callamondia. Moreover, a weekly post passes through Natunu to Kaikonki via Yongro, Proboh, and Bolloh.|$|R
6000|$|Portland had no rod. He {{held the}} gaff and the whisky. California sniffed {{upstream}} and downstream across the racing water, chose his ground, and let the gaudy spoon drop in {{the tail of a}} riffle. I was getting my rod together when I heard the joyous shriek of the reel and the yells of California, and three feet of living silver leaped into the air far across the water. The forces were engaged. The salmon tore up stream, the tense line cutting the water like a <b>tide-rip</b> behind him, and the light bamboo bowed to breaking. What happened after I cannot tell. California swore and prayed, and Portland shouted advice, and I did all three for what appeared to be half a day, but was in reality a little over a quarter of an hour, and sullenly our fish came home with spurts of temper, dashes head-on, and sarabands in the air; but home to the bank came he, and the remorseless reel gathered up the thread of his life inch by inch.

6000|$|I {{remember}} with lively pleasure {{my first}} {{glance at the}} classic stream of the [...] "Portingal Captains" [...] and the [...] "Zeeland interlopers." [...] The ten-mile breadth of the noble Gaboon estuary somewhat dwarfed the features of either shore as we rattled past Cape Santa Clara, a venerable name, [...] "'verted" [...] to Joinville. The bold northern head, though not [...] "very high land," [...] makes some display, because we see it in a better light; and its environs are set off by a line of scattered villages. The vis-a-vis of Louis Philippe Peninsula on the starboard bow (Zuidhoeck), [...] "Sandy Point" [...] or Sandhoeck, by the natives called Pongára, and by the French Péninsule de Marie- Amélie, shows a mere fringe of dark bristle, which is tree, based upon a broad red-yellow streak, which is land. As we pass through the slightly overhung mouth, we can hardly complain with a late traveller of the Gaboon's [...] "sluggish waters;" [...] during the ebb they run like a mild mill-race, and when the current, setting to the north-west, meets a strong sea-breeze from the west, there is a criss-cross, a <b>tide-rip,</b> contemptible enough to a cruizer, but quite capable of filling cock-boats. And, {{nearing the end of}} our voyage, we rejoice to see that the dull down-pourings and the sharp storms of Fernando Po have apparently not yet migrated so far south. Dancing blue wavelets, under the soft azure sky, plash and cream upon the pure clean sand that projects here and there black lines of porous ironstone waiting to become piers; and the water-line is backed by swelling ridges, here open and green- grassed, there spotted with islets of close and shady trees. Mangrove, that horror of the African voyager, shines by its absence; and the soil is not mud, but humus based on gravels or on ruddy clays, stiff and retentive. The formation, in fact, is everywhere that of Eyo or Yoruba, the goodly region lying west of the lower Niger, and its fertility must result from the abundant water supply of the equatorial belt.|$|R
6000|$|... . At {{the close}} of a winter day, [...] Their anchors down, by London town, the Three Great Captains lay; [...] And one was Admiral of the North from Solway Firth to Skye, [...] And one was Lord of the Wessex coast and all the lands thereby, [...] And one was Master of the Thames from Limehouse to Blackwall, [...] And he was Captain of the Fleet -- the bravest of them all. [...] Their good guns guarded their great gray sides [...] that were thirty foot in the sheer, [...] When there came a certain trading-brig with news of a privateer. [...] Her rigging was rough with the clotted drift that drives in a Northern breeze, [...] Her sides were clogged with the lazy weed that spawns in the Eastern seas. [...] Light she rode in the rude <b>tide-rip,</b> to left and right she rolled, [...] And the skipper sat on the scuttle-butt and stared at an empty hold. [...] "I ha' paid Port dues for your Law," [...] quoth he, [...] "and where is the Law ye boast [...] If I sail unscathed from a heathen port to be robbed on a Christian coast? [...] Ye have smoked the hives of the Laccadives as we burn the lice in a bunk, [...] We tack not now to a Gallang prow or a {{plunging}} Pei-ho junk; [...] I had no fear but the seas were clear {{as far as a}} sail might fare [...] Till I met with a lime-washed Yankee brig that rode off Finisterre. [...] There were canvas blinds to his bow-gun ports to screen the weight he bore, [...] And the signals ran for a merchantman from Sandy Hook to the Nore. [...] He would not fly the Rovers' flag -- the bloody or the black, [...] But now he floated the Gridiron and now he flaunted the Jack. [...] He spoke of the Law as he crimped my crew -- he swore it was only a loan; [...] But when I would ask for my own again, he swore it was none of my own. [...] He has taken my little parrakeets that nest beneath the Line, [...] He has stripped my rails of the shaddock-frails and the green unripened pine; [...] He has taken my bale of dammer and spice I won beyond the seas, [...] He has taken my grinning heathen gods -- and what should he want o' these? [...] My foremast would not mend his boom, my deckhouse patch his boats; [...] He has whittled the two, this Yank Yahoo, to peddle for shoe-peg oats. [...] I could not fight for the failing light and a rough beam-sea beside, [...] But I hulled him once for a clumsy crimp and twice because he lied. [...] Had I had guns (as I had goods) to work my Christian harm, [...] I had run him up from his quarter-deck to trade with his own yard-arm; [...] I had nailed his ears to my capstan-head, and ripped them off with a saw, [...] And soused them in the bilgewater, and served them to him raw; [...] I had flung him blind in a rudderless boat to rot in the rocking dark, [...] I had towed him aft of his own craft, a bait for his brother shark; [...] I had lapped him round with cocoa husk, and drenched him with the oil, [...] And lashed him fast to his own mast to blaze above my spoil; [...] I had stripped his hide for my hammock-side, [...] and tasselled his beard i' the mesh, [...] And spitted his crew on the live bamboo [...] that grows through the gangrened flesh; [...] I had hove him down by the mangroves brown, [...] where the mud-reef sucks and draws, [...] Moored by the heel to his own keel to wait for the land-crab's claws! [...] He is lazar within and lime without, ye can nose him far enow, [...] For he carries the taint of a musky ship -- the reek of the slaver's dhow!" [...] The skipper looked at the tiering guns and the bulwarks tall and cold, [...] And the Captains Three full courteously peered down at the gutted hold, [...] And the Captains Three called courteously from deck to scuttle-butt: -- [...] "Good Sir, we ha' dealt with that merchantman or ever your teeth were cut. [...] Your words be words of a lawless race, and the Law it standeth thus: [...] He comes of a race that have never a Law, and he never has boarded us. [...] We ha' sold him canvas and rope and spar -- we know that his price is fair, [...] And we know that he weeps for the lack of a Law as he rides off Finisterre. [...] And since he is damned for a gallows-thief by you and better than you, [...] We hold it meet that the English fleet should know that we hold him true." [...] The skipper called to the tall taffrail: -- [...] "And what is that to me? [...] Did ever you hear of a Yankee brig that rifled a Seventy-three? [...] Do I loom so large from your quarter-deck that I lift like a ship o' the Line? [...] He has learned to run from a shotted gun and harry such craft as mine. [...] There is never a Law on the Cocos Keys to hold a white man in, [...] But we do not steal the niggers' meal, for that is a nigger's sin. [...] Must he have his Law as a quid to chaw, or laid in brass on his wheel? [...] Does he steal with tears when he buccaneers? [...] 'Fore Gad, then, why does he steal?" [...] The skipper bit on a deep-sea word, and the word it was not sweet, [...] For he could see the Captains Three had signalled to the Fleet. [...] But three and two, in white and blue, the whimpering flags began: -- [...] "We have heard a tale of a -- foreign sail, but he is a merchantman." [...] The skipper peered beneath his palm and swore by the Great Horn Spoon: -- [...] "'Fore Gad, the Chaplain of the Fleet would bless my picaroon!" [...] By two and three the flags blew free to lash the laughing air: -- [...] "We have sold our spars to the merchantman -- we know that his price is fair." [...] The skipper winked his Western eye, and swore by a China storm: -- [...] "They ha' rigged him a Joseph's jury-coat to keep his honour warm." [...] The halliards twanged against the tops, the bunting bellied broad, [...] The skipper spat in the empty hold and mourned for a wasted cord. [...] Masthead -- masthead, the signal sped by the line o' the British craft; [...] The skipper called to his Lascar crew, and put her about and laughed: -- [...] "It's mainsail haul, my bully boys all -- we'll out to the seas again -- [...] Ere they set us to paint their pirate saint, or scrub at his grapnel-chain.
