In contrast with some trans-splicingmetazoangroups (e. g. nematodes), flatwormspliced leaders are variable in both sequence and length in different flatworm taxa. However, an absolutely conserved and unique feature of all flat-worm spliced leaders is the presence of a 3 -terminal AUG. We pre-viously suggested that the Schistosomamansoni spliced leaderAUG might contribute a required <b>translation</b> <b>initiator</b> methionine to recipient mRNAs. Here we identified and examined trans-spliced cDNAs from a large set of newly available schistosome cDNAs. 28 % of the trans-spliced cDNAs have the SL AUG in-frame with the major open reading frame of the mRNA.

Although NMD-induced loss-of-function {{has been}} shown to contribute to the genesis of particular cancers, its global functional consequence in tumours has not been characterized.

We identify more than 73 [*]K mutations that are predicted to elicit NMD (NMD-elicit). NMD-elicit mutations in tumour suppressor genes (TSGs) are associated with significant reduction in gene expression. We discover cancer-specific NMD-elicit signatures in TSGs and cancer-associated genes. Our analysis reveals a previously unrecognized dependence of hypermutated tumours on hypofunction of genes that are involved in chromatin remodelling and translation.

40|$|SummaryDuring {{eukaryotic}} <b>translation</b> initiation, <b>initiator</b> tRNA {{does not}} insert fully into the P decoding {{site on the}} 40 S ribosomal subunit. This conformation (POUT) is compatible with scanning mRNA for the AUG start codon. Base pairing with AUG is thought to promote isomerization to a more stable conformation (PIN) that arrests scanning and promotes dissociation of eIF 1 from the 40 S subunit. Here, we present a cryoEM reconstruction of a yeast preinitiation complex at 4. 0  Å resolution with initiator tRNA in the PIN state, prior to eIF 1 release. The structure reveals stabilization of the codon-anticodon duplex by the N-terminal tail of eIF 1 A, changes {{in the structure of}} eIF 1 likely instrumental in its subsequent release, and changes in the conformation of eIF 2. The mRNA traverses the entire mRNA cleft and makes connections to the regulatory domain of eIF 2 α, eIF 1 A, and ribosomal elements that allow recognition of context nucleotides surrounding the AUG codon...|$|R
40|$|<b>Translation</b> <b>Initiator</b> of Short 5 ′ UTR (TISU) is {{a unique}} {{regulatory}} element of both transcription and translation initiation. It is present in a sizable number of genes with basic cellular functions and a very short untranslated region (5 ′ UTR). Here, we investigated translation initiation from short 5 ′ UTR mRNAs with AUG in various contexts. Reducing 5 ′ UTR length to the minimal functional size increases leaky scanning from weak and strong initiators but hardly affects translation initiation and ribosomal binding directed by TISU. Ribosome interaction with TISU mRNA is cap dependent and involves AUG downstream nucleotides that compensate for the absent 5 ′ UTR contacts. Interestingly, eIF 1 inhibits cap-proximal AUG selection within weak or strong contexts but not within TISU. Furthermore, TISU-directed translation is unaffected by inhibition of the RNA helicase eIF 4 A. Thus, TISU directs efficient cap-dependent translation initiation without scanning, a mechanism that would be advantageous when intracellular levels of eIF 1 and eIF 4 A fluctuate...|$|E

This translation is directed most efficiently by those plasmids in which the lac sequences abut the t gene such that a hybrid ribosome binding is encoded. In this case, the Shine-Dalgarno sequence is of lac origin but the ATG derives from the t gene. <b>translation</b> from this <b>initiator</b> codon is greatly decreased if the lac sequences are separated from the ATG by 17 base pairs and is abolished if the AT of this triplet is deleted.

This protein has an isoelectric point(s) indistinguishable from that of t antigen isolated from simian virus 40 -transformed cells. Moreover, a partial sequence of the amino-terminal region of the bacterial product is that predicted for authentic t antigen. We conclude that these bacteria are for authentic t antigen.

40|$|Revieware three tRNA-binding {{sites on}} the ribosome, {{designated}} as the aminoacyl-site (A-site), the peptidyl- site (P-site) and the exit-site (E-site) (Figure 1). In canonical <b>translation</b> initiation, the <b>initiator</b> tRNA is in the P-site and addition of a tRNA to the A-site leads to peptide-bond formation and translocation. Overall, {{it is important to}} remember that the canonical pathway of translation initiation begins when the 50 cap is recognized. Although the canonical cap- and scanning-dependent mechanism accounts for protein synthesis on the majority of eukaryotic mRNAs, it cannot account for translation initiation on all messages, including certain viral RNAs. For example, poliovirus (PV) is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus with no 50 -cap but with a genome-linked lation is RNA-driven, the structure of the IRES RNA is a primary focus of these studies. The picture that has emerged is one of structural and mechanistic diversity; as a result, viral IRESs are placed currently into one of four groups (Box 1). Of these groups, two include IRESs that can bind directly to the ribosome in the absence of any other co-factors, such as host-cell initiation factors and this pre-sents an interesting question: what are the structures that confer this ability and how do they work? In fact, although a variety of probing, biochemical and biophysical methods have been applied to IRESs from all groups, the only IRESs for which structures have been solved are those that bind directly to the ribosome.

40|$|Based on the {{definition}} and assessment methods proposed in Chapter 2, {{an analysis of}} accuracy at the phonetic, spelling, lexical, syntactic, semantic, and textual levels is given, together with {{an examination of the}} impact of extra-linguistic factors, such as the time and place of <b>translation,</b> <b>initiator's</b> policy, and translators. The last section defines the texts for the present study. Chapter 1 is {{a review of the literature}} on translation quality assessment in China and in the West. Chapter 2 reviews the study of accuracy in scientific and technical translation, including an introduction to accuracy, research on accuracy, and definition of accuracy, which involves completeness in information transfer, consistency in terminology, grammaticality in the encoding of the target text, and methods of assessing linguistic accuracy. Chapter 3 proposes a new theoretical framework and presents texts for the study of accuracy. Apart from complete transfer of information, consistency in terminology, and grammaticality in the encoding of the target text, accuracy should also be assessed by the function of the target text and the impact of extra-linguistic factors. Chapter 4 is a contrastive analysis of the source and target texts on the basis of the above theoretical framework. This analysis includes features of the source and target texts, methods in translating terms in traditional Chinese medicine, methods in assessing semantic accuracy, types of Chinese medicine formulas and their methods of translation, types of errors in the target texts, and the impact of extra-linguistic factors on translation. Chapter 5 discusses methods of assessing accuracy with the use of computer-aided tools, illustrating them with examples and offering explanations on the terms and statistics. The software used are Wordsmith 3. 0 (Scott, 1998) and MonoConc Pro 2. 0 (Barlow, 2000). Chapter 6 examines computer-aided assessment of the translation of The Pharmacopoeia with a more comprehensive error analysis of the target texts. It is shown that compared with human analysis, computer analysis has a higher speed in search, a broader range of texts, a faster production of wordlists, and a faster and better calculation of errors. This is a more comprehensive assessment of translation accuracy. It concludes with an analysis of the possible impact of the extra-linguistic factors on linguistic encoding. Chapter 7 proposes methods to improve accuracy through the construction of the bilingual term bank, and offers suggestions to improve the translation by the construction of a translation memory with the computer-aided tools provided by Trados. A comparison of the new translations with the old ones shows marked improvements in the former. Chapter 8 concludes with the major findings in this thesis. Firstly, computer-aided assessment of accuracy in scientific and technical translation is faster and broader than human assessment. Secondly, methods for assessing accuracy with computer-aided tools are important in filling up gaps in human assessment. Lastly, computer-aided accuracy assessment has a great impact on other relevant areas. In scientific and technical translation, accuracy is most important. However, the operative aspect of accuracy assessment still eludes us. This is a thorny issue in translation studies and practice. The purpose of the present study is to use computer tools, such as Wordsmith 3. 0 (Scott, 1998) and MonoConc Pro 2. 0 (Barlow, 2000), to help to assess accuracy in the English translation of Chinese pharmacological writings, a specific area of scientific and technical translation. The texts used for this study have been selected from the bilingual versions of The Pharmacopoeia of the People's Republic of China (Beijing: Chemical Industry Press, 2000; The Pharmacopoeia hereafter). The theoretical framework adopted in this thesis is the translation quality assessment model proposed by Reiss (1971 / 2000) and Vermeer (1996). The emphasis is on {{the definition}} and assessment of "accuracy" so as to provide an operative method to assess accuracy in translation, which is supplemented by a computer-aided approach to accuracy. This is done in the following ways: (1) The creation of a bilingual term bank of 1, 500 entries and a translation corpus based on the source texts, target texts and 8 Chinese-English dictionaries of medicine. (2) The categorization of the formula names and linguistic items in the source texts and the definition of accuracy and its assessment methods based on research findings in scientific and technical translation. (3) The quantitative and qualitative analysis of translation errors based on the above definition and methods. (4) The comparison of new translations, produced with the aid of computer tools, with the old ones to demonstrate the validity and applicability of the new approach to accuracy assessment.

40|$|SummaryProtein {{synthesis}} {{is a major}} energy-consuming process, {{which is}} rapidly repressed upon energy stress by AMPK. How energy deficiency affects translation of mRNAs that cope with the stress response is poorly understood. We found that mitochondrial genes remain translationally active upon energy deprivation. Surprisingly, inhibition of translation is partially retained in AMPKα 1 /AMPKα 2 knockout cells. Mitochondrial mRNAs are enriched with TISU, a <b>translation</b> <b>initiator</b> of short 5 ′ UTR, which confers resistance specifically to energy stress. Purified 48 S preinitiation complex is sufficient for initiation via TISU AUG, when preceded by a short 5 ′ UTR. eIF 1  stimulates TISU but inhibits non-TISU-directed initiation. Remarkably, eIF 4 GI shares this activity and also interacts with eIF 1. Furthermore, eIF 4 F is released upon 48 S formation on TISU. These findings describe a specialized translation tolerance mechanism enabling continuous translation of TISU genes under energy stress and reveal that a key step in start codon selection of short 5 ′ UTR is eIF 4 F release...|$|E

Here, we present the crystal structures of an N-terminal-truncated Pdcd 4 in free form and in complex with eIF 4 A. Upon binding to eIF 4 A, Pdcd 4 undergoes a marked conformational change to form a heterotrimeric complex with eIF 4 A, with one Pdcd 4 binding to two eIF 4 A molecules in two different modes. The binding of Pdcd 4 to eIF 4 A is required to inhibit the enzymatic activity of eIF 4 A, translation initiation, and AP- 1 -dependent transcription. Both MA 3 domains are required to efficiently compete with the C-terminal domain of eIF 4 G (eIF 4 Gc) for binding to eIF 4 A whereas a single MA 3 is sufficient to inhibit translation.

40|$|The {{structural}} {{organization of}} the Drosophila melanogaster gene encoding mitochondrial single-stranded DNA-binding protein (mtSSB) has been determined and its pattern of expression evaluated during Drosophila development. The D. melanogaster mtSSB gene contains four exons and three small introns. The transcriptional initiation site is located 22 nucleotides upstream from the <b>initiator</b> <b>translation</b> codon in adults, whereas several initiation sites are found in embryos. No consensus TATA or CAAT sequences are located at canonical positions, although an AT-rich sequence was identified flanking the major transcriptional initiation site. Northern analyses indicated that the mtSSB transcript is present at variable levels throughout development. In situ hybridization analysis shows that maternally deposited mtSSB mRNA is distributed homogeneously in the early embryo, whereas de novo transcript is produced specifically at an elevated level in the developing midgut. Transfection assays in cultured Schneider cells with promoter region deletion constructs revealed that the proximal 230 nucleotides contain cis-acting elements required for efficient gene expression. Putative transcription factor binding sites clustered within this region include two Drosophila DNA replication-related elements (DRE) and a single putative E 2 F binding site. Deletion and base substitution mutagenesis of the DRE sites demonstrated that they are required for efficient promoter activity, and gel electrophoretic mobility shift analyses showed that DRE binding factor (DREF) binds to these sites. Our data suggest strongly that the Drosophila mtSSB gene is regulated by the DRE/DREF system. This finding represents a first link between nuclear and mitochondrial DNA replication.

40|$|CSIRTranslation {{initiation}} is a {{rate limiting}} step during protein biosynthesis. Initiation occurs by formation of an initiation complex comprising 30 S subunit of ribosome, mRNA, initiator tRNA, and initiation factors. The initiator tRNA has a specialized function of binding to ribosomal P site whereas all the other tRNAs are selected in the ribosomal A site. The presence of a highly conserved 3 consecutive G-C base pairs in the anticodon stem of the initiator tRNA {{has been shown to}} be responsible for its P-site targeting. The exact molecular mechanism involved in the P-site targeting of the initiator tRNA is still unclear and focus of our study. Using genetic methods, we obtained mutant E. coli strains where initiator tRNA mutants lacking the characteristic 3 -GC base pairs can also initiate translation. One such mutant strain, A 30, was selected for this study. Using standard molecular genetic tools, the mutation was mapped and identified to be a mutation in a transcription remodeling factor, RapA (A 511 V). RapA is a transcription recycling factor and it displaces S 1 when it performs its transcription recycling activity. We found this mutation to cause an increase in the S 1 -depleted ribosomes leading to decreased fidelity of translation initiation as the mutant RapA inefficiently displaces S 1 from RNA polymerase complex. The mutation in the RapA was also found to cause changes in the transcriptome which leads to downregulation of major genes important for methionine and purine metabolism. Using mass spectrometric analysis, we identified deficiencies of methionine and adenine in the strain carrying mutant RapA. Our lab had previously reported that methionine and S-adenosyl methionine deficiency cause deficiency of methylations in ribosome which in turn decreases the fidelity of protein synthesis initiation. We used strains deleted for two newly identified methyltransferases, namely RlmH and RlmI, for our study and these strains also showed decreased fidelity of initiation. RlmH and RlmI methylate 1915 and 1962 positions of 23 S rRNA respectively. We found that deletion of these methyltransferases also caused defects in ribosome biogenesis and compromised activity of ribosome recycling factor. We constructed phylogenetic trees of the initiator tRNA from 158 species which distinctly assembled into three domains of life. We also constructed trees using the minihelix or the whole sequence of species specific tRNAs, and iterated our analysis on 50 eubacterial species. We identified tRNAPro, tRNAGlu, or tRNAThr (but surprisingly not elongator tRNAMet) as probable ancestors of tRNAi. We then determined the factors imposing selection of methionine as the initiating amino acid. Overall frequency of occurrence of methionine, whose metabolic cost of synthesis is the highest among all amino acids, remains almost unchanged across the three domains of life. Our results indicate that methionine selection, as the initiating amino acid was possibly a consequence of the evolution of one-carbon metabolism, which plays an important role in regulating translation initiation. In conclusion, the current study reveals the importance of methylations in ribosome biogenesis and fidelity of translation initiation. It also strongly suggests a co-evolution of the metabolism and translation apparatus giving adaptive advantage to the cells where presence of methionine in the environment can be a signal to initiate <b>translation</b> with methionine <b>initiator</b> tRNA...|$|R
40|$|The studies {{reported}} in this thesis describe the work done {{in the area of}} translation initiation where a previously unknown role of multiple copies of initiator tRNA in E. coli has been reported. Also the role of SsrA resume codon in resumption of translation, until not clearly known has been reported here. Chapter - 1 discusses the relevant literature in understanding <b>translation</b> and <b>initiator</b> tRNA selection on the ribosome during initiation. It also discusses the literature pertaining to the aspect of release of stalled ribosomal complexes by SsrA. This is followed by the next chapter (chapter- 2) which discusses the materials and methods used throughout the study. Chapter- 3 describes the studies leading to the role of multiple copies of initiator tRNA in E. coli in governing the fidelity of initiator tRNA selection on the P site of the ribosome. This is followed by Chapter- 4 which describes the role of the resume codon of the SsrA in governing the efficiency of trans-translation in releasing the stalled ribosomal complexes. The summaries of the chapters 3 and chapter 4 are briefly described below. 	i) Role of conserved 3 GC base pairs of initiator tRNA in the initiator-elongator tRNA discrimination. Translation initiation {{is the first step in}} the very important and highly conserved biological process of protein biosynthesis. The process involves many steps, a wide array of protein factors at each specialized step and a large ribonucleoprotein particle; the ribosome to decode the information of the mRNA template into biologically active proteins. The process of initiation is still unclear largely due to fewer reports of available structural data. One of the very interesting questions that people have been trying to address is how the initiator tRNA is selected on the P- site of the ribosome and what is the importance of the conserved three GC base pairs in the anticodon stem of the initiator tRNA. Here in this study, I have studied this question by using the classical genetic technique of generating and characterizing the mutant initiator tRNA defective at the step of initiation. I have identified and analyzed the suppressors which are capable of rescuing this defect in initiation. The study involves two such E. coli suppressor strains (named D 4 and D 27). These suppressors can initiate translation from a reporter CAT mRNA with amber codon, independent of the presence of the three consecutive GC base pairs in the anticodon stem of initiator tRNAs. Mapping of the mutations revealed that the mutants are defective in expression of the tRNA 1 fMet (metZVW) gene locus which encodes the initiator tRNA. Both the suppressors (D 4 and D 27) also allow initiation with elongator tRNA species in E. coli. Taken together, the results show that E. coli when deficient in the initiator tRNA concentration can lead to initiation with elongator tRNA species. 	ii) The Role of SsrA/tmRNA in ribosome recycling and rescue. Occasionally during the process of translation, the ribosomes stall on the mRNA before the polypeptide synthesis is complete. This situation is detrimental to the organism because of the sequestration of the tRNAs as ‘peptidyl tRNAs’ and the ribosomes. In E. coli one of the pathways to rescue stalled ribosomes involves disassembly of these stalled complexes to release peptidyl tRNAs which are then recycled by peptidyl tRNA hydrolase (Pth), an essiential enzyme in E. coli. The other pathway which is not essential in E. coli but is conserved in all prokaryotes involves SsrA or tmRNA (transfer messenger RNA). The tmRNA is charged with alanine and recognizes the stalled ribosomal complexes and acts as tRNA to bind the A-site. It also functions as mRNA by adding a undecapeptide (which is actually a tag for degradation by cellular proteases) to the existing polypeptide and there is normal resumption of the translation. In most sequences of SsrA ORF, the first codon of the ORF, called as resume codon, is conserved. I wanted to understand the importance of the conservation of the resume codon. Towards this end I randomly mutated the resume codon and studied the effect of the altered resume codon in the rescue of stalled ribosomal complexes. The effect of over-expression of these mutants was investigated in the rescue of the Pthts defect since it is known that the overexpression of SsrA rescues the temperature sensitive phenotype of the Pthts strain and so causes less accumulation of peptidyl–tRNA in E. coli. The effect for these mutants has also been studied by the growth of hybrid λimmP 22 phages. I also used AGA minigene system to study the effect of various mutants which has been shown to sequester tRNAArg (UCU) in the ribosomal P-site, translation of this minigene causes toxicity to E. coli. I have tried to study the effect of the SsrA mutants in rescue of toxicity caused by the minigene. Overall, the observations indicate that the conservation of the resume codon is important in E. coli and having mutated resume codon probably leads to deficient trans-translation during one or the other growth conditions...|$|R

Bag 3 chaperone complex suppresses mutated huntingtin aggregation via autophagy. Classically, HspB proteins are thought to act as ATP-independent molecular chaperones that can bind unfolded proteins and facilitate their processing via the help of ATP-dependent chaperones such as the Hsp 70 machine, in which Bag 3 may act as a molecular link between HspB, Hsp 70, and the ubiquitin ligases.

PvuII were purified to apparent homogeneity by a two-column chromatography procedure. The yield of purified protein was approximately 1. 8 mg/g bacterial paste. Mass spectrometry analysis of selenomethionyl M. PvuII revealed three major forms that probably differ {{in the degree of}} selenomethionine incorporation and the extent of selenomethionine oxidation. Amino acid sequencing and mass spectrometry analysis of selenomethionine-containing peptides suggests that Met 30, Met 51, and Met 261 were only partially replaced by selenomethionine. Furthermore, amino acid 261 may be preferentially oxidized in both native and selenomethionyl form. Selenomethionyl and native M. PvuII were crystallized separately as binary complexes of the methyl donor S-adenosyl-L-methionine in the monoclinic space group P 2 (1). Two complexes were present per asymmetric unit.

40|$|The {{removal of}} N-terminal <b>translation</b> <b>initiator</b> Met by {{methionine}} aminopeptidase (MetAP) is often {{crucial for the}} function and stability of proteins. On the basis of crystal structure and sequence alignment of MetAPs, we have engineered Escherichia coli MetAP by the mutation of three residues, Y 168 G, M 206 T, Q 233 G, in the substrate-binding pocket. Our engineered MetAPs are able to remove the Met from bulky or acidic penultimate residues, such as Met, His, Asp, Asn, Glu, Gln, Leu, Ile, Tyr, and Trp, {{as well as from}} small residues. The penultimate residue, the second residue after Met, was further removed if the antepenultimate residue, the third residue after Met, was small. By the coexpression of engineered MetAP in E. coli through the same or a separate vector, we have successfully produced recombinant proteins possessing an innate N terminus, such as onconase, an antitumor ribonuclease from the frog Rana pipiens. The N-terminal pyroglutamate of recombinant onconase is critical for its structural integrity, catalytic activity, and cyto-toxicity. On the basis of N-terminal sequence information in the protein database, 85 %– 90 % of recombinant proteins should be produced in authentic form by our engineered MetAPs...|$|E
40|$|The {{molecular}} {{basis of the}} uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase defect in eleven yeast 'uroporphyric' mutants was investigated. Uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase, an enzyme of the haem-biosynthetic pathway, catalyses the decarboxylation of uroporphyrinogen to coproporphyrinogen and is encoded by the HEM 12 gene in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The mutations were identified by sequencing the mutant hem 12 alleles amplified in vitro from genomic DNA extracted from the mutant strains. Four mutations leading {{to the absence of}} enzyme protein were found: one mutation caused the substitution of the <b>translation</b> <b>initiator</b> Met to Ile, a two-base deletion created a frameshift at codon 247 and two nonsense mutations were found at codons 50 and 263. Four different point mutations were identified in seven 'leaky' mutants with residual modified uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase activity; each of three mutations was found in two independently isolated mutants. The nucleotide transitions resulted in the amino acid substitutions Ser- 59 to Phe, Thr- 62 to Ile, Leu- 107 to Ser, or Ser- 215 to Asn, all located in or near highly conserved regions. The results suggest that there is a single active centre in uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase, the geometry of which is affected in the mutant enzymes...|$|E
40|$|Previous studies {{indicated}} that bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) from patients with {{systemic lupus erythematosus}} (SLE) exhibited the phenomenon of apoptosis. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether apoptosis of BM-MSCs from SLE patients were dysregulated. In this paper, endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) was evidenced by increased expression of phosphorylated protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK) and inositol-requiring protein- 1 (IRE- 1). We also found the activation of downstream target eukaryotic <b>translation</b> <b>initiator</b> factor 2 α (eIF 2 α) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein- (C/EBP-) homologous protein (CHOP) in BM-MSCs from SLE patients. Interestingly, we discovered that 4 -phenylbutyric acid (4 -PBA), a selective inhibitor of ERS, blocked the apoptosis of BM-MSCs from SLE patients and alleviated the level of Jun N-terminal kinase 1 / 2 (JNK 1 / 2) and CHOP. Furthermore, blockage of PERK signaling expression by siRNA not only significantly reduced the expression of CHOP, but also activated the anti-apoptotic regulator B-cell lymphoma- 2 (Bcl- 2). Blockage of IRE- 1 or JNK 1 / 2 by siRNA resulted in the decreased expression of JNK 1 / 2 and proapoptosis protein Bcl- 2 associated protein X (BAX). These results implicated that ERS-mediated apoptosis was a critical determinant of BM-MSCs from SLE patients...|$|E

Here {{we describe the}} isolation and characterization of genomic clones encoding the human PTF yl SNAP 43 gene. The gene spans approximately 29 kilobases, and is composed of 9 exons and 8 introns. A major transcription initiation site was identified at the position 58 base pairs upstream of the AUG <b>translation</b> <b>initiator</b> codon on primer extension analysis with HeLa mKNA. The 5 ' flanking region lacks a typical TATA box but contains many putative binding sites for various transcription factors, such as Spl, Octl, NF 1, API, E 2 F, and USF. Immediately downstream of the transcription start site, we found a VNTR of a 17 -bp sequence rich in (G+C). Four different alleles with two to five copies of the tandem repeat were identified in 10 individuals examined, indicating {{a high degree of}} variation at the PTF 7 /SNAP 43 locus. In addition, the PTF 7 /SNAP 43 gene was mapped to human chromo-some 14 q 22 by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Key words: fluorescence in situ hybridization, gene organization, PTF/SNAPc, VNTR.

40|$|Transcription is {{controlled}} by cis regulatory elements, which if localized downstream to the transcriptional start site (TSS), in the 5 ′UTR, could influence translation as well. However presently {{there is little evidence}} for such composite regulatory elements. We have identified by computational analysis an abundant element located downstream to the TSS up to position + 30, which controls both transcription and translation. This element has an invariable ATG sequence, which serves as the translation initiation codon in 64 % of the genes bearing it. In these genes the initiating AUG is preceded by an extremely short 5 ′UTR. We show that translation in vitro and in vivo is initiated exclusively from the AUG of this motif, and that the AUG flanking sequences create a strong translation initiation context. This motif is distinguished from the well-known Kozak in its unique ability to direct efficient and accurate translation initiation from mRNAs with a very short 5 ′UTR. We therefore named it TISU for <b>Translation</b> <b>Initiator</b> of Short 5 ′UTR. Interestingly, this translation initiation element is also an essential transcription regulatory element of Yin Yang 1. Our characterization of a common transcription and translation element points to a link between mammalian transcription and translation initiation...|$|E
40|$|The 5 ' coding and {{promoter}} {{regions of the}} four coordinately regulated tubulin genes of Chlamydomonas reinhardi have been mapped and sequenced. DNA sequencing data shows that the predicted N-terminal amino acid sequences of Chlamydomonas alpha- and beta-tubulins closely match that of tubulins of other eucaryotes. Within the alpha 1 - and alpha 2 -tubulin gene set and the beta 1 - and beta 2 -tubulin gene set, both nucleotide sequence and intron placement are highly conserved. Transcription initiation sites have been located by primer extension analysis at 140, 141, 159, and 132 base pairs upstream of the <b>translation</b> <b>initiator</b> codon for the alpha 1 -, alpha 2 -, beta 1 -, and beta 2 -tubulin genes, respectively. Among the structures with potential regulatory significance, the most striking is a 16 -base-pair consensus sequence [GCTC(G/C) AAGGC(G/T) (G/C) [...] (C/A) (C/A) G] which is found in multiple copies immediately upstream of the TATA box {{in each of the}} four genes. An unexpected discovery is the presence of pseudo{{promoter regions}} in two of the transcribed tubulin genes. One pseudopromoter region is located 400 base pairs upstream of the authentic alpha 2 -tubulin gene promoter, whereas the other is located within the transcribed 5 ' noncoding region of the beta 1 -tubulin gene...|$|E
40|$|Mature a-amylase of Bacillus subtilis {{is known}} to be formed from its {{precursor}} by the removal of the NH 2 -terminal 41 amino acid sequence (41 amino acid leader sequence). DNA fragments coding for short sequences consisting of 28 (Pro as the COOH terminus), 29 (Ala), 31 (Ala), and 33 (Ala) amino acids from the <b>translation</b> <b>initiator,</b> Met, in the leader sequence were prepared and fused in frame to the DNA encoding the mature a-amylase. The secretion activity of the 33 amino acid sequence was nearly twice as high as that of the parental 41 amino acid sequence, whereas the activity of the 31 amino acid sequence was 75 % of that of the parent. In contrast, almost no secretion activity was observed with the 28 and 29 amino acid sequences. The signal peptide cleavage site of the precursor expressed from the plasmid encoding the 33 amino acid sequence was located between Ala and Leu at positions 33 and 34 and that from the 31 amino acid sequence between Thr and Ala at positions 33 and 34. The NH 2 -terminal amino acid from the latter corresponded to the 3 rd amino acid of the mature enzyme. These results indicated that the functional signal peptide of the B. subtilis / 9 -amylase consists of the first 33 amino acids from the initiator, Met. a-Amylase is a representative extracellular enzyme o...|$|E
40|$|At {{least six}} mRNAs {{are made from}} the Drosophila melanogaster act 5 C gene. We {{investigated}} the structures of these RNAs in detail and determined that they are heterogeneous at both their 5 ' and 3 ' ends. At the 5 ' end there were two nonhomologous leader exons which were alternately spliced to {{the remainder of the}} gene. These leader exons mapped to 1. 7 and 0. 7 kilobases, respectively, upstream of a common splice acceptor site which was eight base pairs 5 ' to the <b>translation</b> <b>initiator</b> AUG. Exon 1 is 147 bases in length, while exon 2 is 111 bases. A consensus TATA sequence was found roughly 30 base pairs upstream from exon 1, but none was found in the analogous position upstream of exon 2. The transcript length diversity arose principally from the use of three polyadenylation sites. This gave rise to RNA molecules with 3 '-untranslated regions of roughly 375, 655, and 945 base pairs. With two start sites and three termination sites, this gene has the potential to produce six different transcripts. All six possible transcripts were present in whole fly mRNA. Transcripts containing the two different leader exons were found in roughly the same relative quantities through development. In contrast, the various 3 ' ends were differentially represented through development...|$|E
40|$|Diurnal {{oscillations}} of {{gene expression}} are {{a hallmark of}} rhythmic physiology across most living organisms. Such oscillations are controlled by the interplay between the circadian clock and feeding rhythms. Although rhythmic mRNA accumulation has been extensively studied, comparatively less is known about their transcription and translation. Here, we quantified simultaneously temporal transcription, accumulation, and translation of mouse liver mRNAs under physiological light-dark conditions and ad libitum or night-restricted feeding in WT and brain and muscle Arnt-like 1 (Bmal 1) -deficient animals. We found that rhythmic transcription predominantly drives rhythmic mRNA accumulation and translation {{for a majority of}} genes. Comparison of wild-type and Bmal 1 KO mice shows that circadian clock and feeding rhythms have broad impact on rhythmic gene expression, Bmal 1 deletion affecting surprisingly both transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. Translation efficiency is differentially regulated during the diurnal cycle for genes with 5 '-Terminal Oligo Pyrimidine tract (5 '-TOP) sequences and for genes involved in mitochondrial activity, many harboring a <b>Translation</b> <b>Initiator</b> of Short 5 '-UTR (TISU) motif. The increased translation efficiency of 5 '-TOP and TISU genes is mainly driven by feeding rhythms but Bmal 1 deletion also affects amplitude and phase of translation, including TISU genes. Together this study emphasizes the complex interconnections between circadian and feeding rhythms at several steps ultimately determining rhythmic gene expression and translation...|$|E

Urine organic acids showed Krebs cycle metabolites and mildly elevated methylmalonate and methylcitrate. The acylcarnitine profile showed elevated propionylcarnitine and succinylcarnitine. Amino acids showed elevated glutamic acid, glutamine, proline, and alanine. From the age 2 of mo on, she had elevated transaminases and intermittent episodes of liver failure. Liver biopsy showed steatosis and a decrease of mitochondrial DNA to 50 % of control. She had bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. Over the course of the first 2 y of life, she developed a progressively severe myopathy with pronounced muscle weakness eventually leading to respiratory failure, Leigh disease, and recurrent hepatic failure. The hepatic symptoms and the metabolic parameters temporarily improved on treatment with aspartate, but neither muscle symptoms nor brain lesions improved. Laboratory testing revealed a deficiency of succinyl-CoA ligase enzyme activity and protein in fibroblasts because of a novel homozygous mutation in the SUCLG 1 gene: c. 40 A>T (p. M 14 L). Functional analysis suggests that this methionine is more likely to function as the <b>translation</b> <b>initiator</b> methionine, explaining the pathogenic nature of the mutation.

We have isolated a mouse CD 44 cDNA by {{polymerase chain reaction}} amplification of cDNA synthesized from total cellular RNA isolated from 38 C- 13, a B-lymphocyte cell line. The oligonucleotide sequences were based at the 5 ' end on the baboon CD 44 sequence upstream of and including the <b>translation</b> <b>initiator</b> ATG and at the 3 ' end on a mouse CD 44 sequence that was determined from a rare, incomplete cDNA clone. The mouse CD 44 DNA sequence {{is similar to the}} baboon CD 44 sequence but has structural features that are distinct.

In addition, just upstream from the predicted cleavage site of the leader peptide, nucleotide insertions result in the addition of two or four amino acids, depending upon the mouse strain. An amino acid replacement between two strains carrying different CD 44 (also called Pgp- 1) allotypes is likely responsible for the Pgp- 1 polymorphism.

40|$|Glucose {{restriction}} (GR) impairs {{muscle cell}} differentiation and evokes myotube atrophy. Resveratrol treatment in skeletal muscle cells improves inflammatory-induced reductions in skeletal muscle cell differentiation. We therefore hypothesised that resveratrol treatment would improve muscle cell differentiation and myotube hypertrophy in differentiating C 2 C 12 myoblasts and mature myotubes during GR. Glucose restriction at 0. 6  g/L (3. 3  mM) blocked differentiation and myotube hypertrophy versus high-glucose (4. 5  g/L or 25  mM) differentiation media (DM) conditions universally used for myoblast culture. Resveratrol (10  µM) treatment increased SIRT 1 phosphorylation in DM conditions, yet {{did not improve}} differentiation when administered to differentiating myoblasts in GR conditions. Resveratrol did evoke increases in hypertrophy of mature myotubes under DM conditions with corresponding elevated Igf-I and Myhc 7 gene expression, coding for the ‘slow’ type I MYHC protein isoform. Inhibition of SIRT 1 via EX- 527 administration (100  nM) also reduced myotube diameter and area in DM conditions and resulted in lower gene expression of Myhc 1, 2 and 4 coding for ‘intermediate’ and ‘faster’ IIx, IIa and IIb protein isoforms, respectively. Resveratrol treatment {{did not appear to}} modulate phosphorylation of energy-sensing protein AMPK or protein <b>translation</b> <b>initiator</b> P 70 S 6 K. Importantly, in mature myotubes, resveratrol treatment was able to ameliorate reduced myotube growth in GR conditions over an acute 24 -h period, but not over 48 – 72  h. Overall, resveratrol evoked myotube hypertrophy in DM conditions while favouring ‘slower’ Myhc gene expression and acutely ameliorated impaired myotube growth observed during glucose restriction...|$|E
40|$|Tertiary or higher-order RNA motifs that {{regulate}} replication of positive-strand RNA viruses are as yet poorly understood. Using Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), we now {{show that a}} key element in JEV RNA replication is a complex RNA motif that includes a string of three discontinuous complementary sequences (TDCS). The TDCS consists of three 5 -nt-long strands, the left (L) strand upstream of the <b>translation</b> <b>initiator</b> AUG adjacent to the 5 ′-end of the genome, and the middle (M) and right (R) strands corresponding {{to the base of the}} Flavivirus-conserved 3 ′ stem–loop structure near the 3 ′-end of the RNA. The three strands are arranged in an antiparallel configuration, with two sets of base-pairing interactions creating L-M and M-R duplexes. Disrupting either or both of these duplex regions of TDCS completely abolished RNA replication, whereas reconstructing both duplex regions, albeit with mutated sequences, fully restored RNA replication. Modeling of replication-competent genomes recovered from a large pool of pseudorevertants originating from six replication-incompetent TDCS mutants suggests that both duplex base-pairing potentials of TDCS are required for RNA replication. In all cases, acquisition of novel sequences within the 3 ′M-R duplex facilitated a long-range RNA–RNA interaction of its 3 ′M strand with either the authentic 5 ′L strand or its alternative (invariably located upstream of the 5 ′ initiator), thereby restoring replicability. We also found that a TDCS homolog is conserved in other flaviviruses. These data suggest that two duplex base-pairings defined by the TDCS play an essential regulatory role in a key step(s) of Flavivirus RNA replication...|$|E

Recent studies have shown the transcriptional regulation of XDH/XO by cytokines (Dupont et al., 1992, J. Clin. Invest. 89, 197 - 202). In the present study, the 5 ' structure of the XDH/XO gene and characterization of its promoter are undertaken providing an initial step to further elucidate the regulatory mechanism(s) of this enzyme. XDH/XO cDNA from rat bone marrow macrophage has been isolated and used to screen a rat genomic library in order to identify and characterize the promoter of the XDH/XO gene. By Southern analysis, XDH/XO was found to be a single copy gene in the rat genome. Primer extension, RNase protection, and anchor-PCR studies indicate the presence of multiple start sites within a 65 bp window located some 20 - 85 bp upstream of the <b>translation</b> <b>initiator</b> (ATG). Functional studies of the sequences up to 116 nt upstream of the translational start site, which encompasses the several transcriptional start sites, indicate that this region is sufficient to drive the expression of a luciferase reporter gene and is presumed to represent the promoter. Neither a TATA box nor a GC-rich region are present in close proximity to any of the transcriptional start sites; however, sequences with homology to known initiator elements are found within this 116 bp fragment. Several possible regulatory elements, including a NF-IL 6 motif, are also located upstream of the transcriptional start site.

40|$|Cachexia {{inducing}} tumours {{are known}} to produce a glycoprotein called proteolysis inducing factor (PIF), which induces skeletal muscle atrophy via increased protein degradation and decreased protein synthesis. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the signalling pathway by which PIF reduces protein synthesis in skeletal muscle and to determine the link, if any, to the ability to induce protein degradation. In murine myotubes PIF induced an increase in expression of the active form of the dsNRA dependent protein kinase (PKR), as well as the phosphorylated form of the <b>translation</b> <b>initiator</b> elF 2 a, possibly through the release of calcium, at the same concentration as that inhibiting protein synthesis. Inhibition of PKR reversed the inhibition of protein synthesis by PIF and also the induction of protein degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway by a reduction in the nuclear migration of NK-?B. The expression of phosphorylated forms of PKR and elF 2 a was also increased in the muscle of cancer patients experiencing weight loss, and in gastrocnemius muscle of mice bearing the cachexia inducing MAC 16 tumour, as well as in the tumour itself. Treatment of mice bearing the MAC 16 tumour with a PKR inhibitor attenuated muscle atrophy and inhibited tumour growth, through the inactivation of PKR and the consequent reduction of nuclear accumulation of NF-?B. A decreased translational efficiency of the elF- 4 F complex of initiation factors through dephosphorylation of 4 E-BP 1 and an increase eEF 2 phosphorylation was seen in response to PIF in vitro. The same pattern of events also occurred in gastrocnemius muscle of mice bearing the MAC 16 tumour demonstrating weight loss, where a depression of mTOR and p 70 S 6 K activation was also observed as weight loss increased.
