60|$|There was immensity in {{the dome}} of the unbroken, seamless, gray <b>threatening</b> <b>sky.</b> There was majesty in the dim plain, across which the morning light slowly fell. The plain, with its dark blue groves, from which thin lines of smoke rose and hastened away, and majesty in the wind that came from the illimitable and desolate north. But the lonely huskers had no time to feel, much less to think, upon these things.|$|E

However, Jones swept to the outside from 6th {{starting}} position, and passed four cars in turn one. Exiting turn two, he dove below Andretti and took the lead down the backstretch. Jones ran the first lap at a record 154 mph, and started pulling out to a sizable lead.|$|R

Jelland stood leaning against the tiller, and he looked at the <b>threatening</b> <b>sky,</b> the limp sails, and the {{approaching}} boat.|$|E
60|$|For nearly {{quarter of}} an hour the party in the boat watched in silence. It was evident that Long Orrick was {{becoming}} impatient from the way in which he turned, now to windward, to scan the <b>threatening</b> <b>sky,</b> and then to land-ward, to look for the expected signal. He felt, on the one hand, that if the gale continued to increase, it would be necessary to run for the nearest place of safety; and he felt, on the other hand, that if he did not succeed in landing the goods at Fiddler's Cave, there would be small chance of his getting them ashore at all.|$|E
60|$|The {{surroundings}} were depressing when, one evening, Steel and I rode {{home for}} the last time to Gaspard's Trail. The still, clear weather, with white frost in the mornings and mellow sunshine all day long, which follows the harvest, had gone, and the prairie lay bleak and gray under a <b>threatening</b> <b>sky</b> waiting for the snow. Crescents and wedges of wild fowl streaked the lowering heavens overhead as they fled southward in endless processions before the frost. The air throbbed with the beat of their pinions which, at that season, emphasizes the human shrinking from the winter, while the cold wind that shook the grasses sighed most mournfully.|$|E

5000|$|There were <b>threatening</b> <b>skies</b> {{from the}} green flag; causing most of the race to be done under the yellow flag. No {{attempt was made to}} {{postpone}} the race or to call it [...] "official." [...] A record amount of 86 laps were done under caution until the skies became blue again. Besides the weather, a red flag also held up the race for 70 minutes as Price and Bill Champion {{had to go to the}} hospital for their respective injuries.|$|R
5000|$|Sunday {{produced}} <b>threatening</b> <b>skies,</b> but no rain. On {{the last}} lap {{of the morning}} warm-up, the rear stub axle on Andretti's Lotus broke in the left-hander entering The Anvil (nicknamed [...] "Ickx's Corner" [...] after a crash the Belgian had there in 1976). The car spun several times and then hit the barrier, knocking off a rear wheel. Faulty material in the part was blamed, and, with no time to test the spare car, Andretti used his teammate Jean-Pierre Jarier's car for the race.|$|R
60|$|None of them volunteered, {{but when}} Lane gave Walthew a sharp order Blake and Harding joined {{them and the}} latter {{afterwards}} held the fur coat. Blake noticed that he folded and arranged it on his arm with what seemed needless care, though he first turned his back upon the others. Lane was now engaged in examining {{the body and the}} others stood watching him, impressed by the scene. All round the narrow opening the spruces rose darkly against the <b>threatening</b> <b>sky,</b> and in its midst the Sergeant bent over the still form. It made a dark blot on the pale glimmer of the snow and the white patch of the face was faintly distinguishable in the fading light. The spruce tops stirred, shaking down loose snow, which fell with a soft patter, and the wind blew trails of it about.|$|E

50|$|El Greco {{places the}} {{classical}} subject against a gloomy view of Toledo. El Greco’s use of Toledo as {{the backdrop for}} his depiction of Laocoön’s death may be based on local folklore {{that the people of}} Toledo descended from the Trojans. In the painting, the Trojan horse moves towards the city, a reminder of Laocoön’s failed attempt to convince his countrymen of the trap. El Greco portrays the city Toledo as a world of suffering, using color {{to create a sense of}} doom. The high horizon line and the standing figures at the ends of the painting create a vertical composition. Dominated by turbulent shades of grey and swirling clouds, the <b>threatening</b> <b>sky</b> looms over Toledo and creates an eerie background that adds to the suffering of the foreground.|$|E

Bob Caruthers made his third {{pitching}} start for St. Louis, with John Clarkson returning to the mound for a fourth time for Chicago. Under <b>threatening</b> <b>skies</b> the White Stockings took a 2–0 lead into the fourth inning, when a brief rain shower prompted fans to leave the grandstand and run onto the field, demanding that the umpire call the game, thereby nullifying the result, because of inclement weather. Order was restored only with the assistance of a legion of police.|$|R

5000|$|On a blustery day, Van Gogh {{set up his}} easel {{and painted}} [...] "plein-air" [...] (in the open air) at a beach resort, Scheveningen, near The Hague to paint View of the Sea at Scheveningen (F4). While Impressionists are often given credit for {{painting}} outdoors, {{they were not the}} first to do so. Most, however, made sketches on the spot and worked on the painting in a studio. In this case, Van Gogh struggled with the strong wind which sent grains of sand into his thickly applied paint. Although most of the sand was scraped off, there are still a few grains of sand enmeshed in the layers of paint. [...] The tumultuous weather is well depicted with white-capped seas, <b>threatening</b> <b>sky</b> and wind-blown flags. This painting was stolen from the Van Gogh Museum in December 2002 and discovered in Naples, Italy in September 2016.|$|E

Series rookie Dario Franchitti dropped out while leading with a broken transmission, putting Patrick Carpentier into the lead on lap 210 (of 236). Carpentier attempted to stretch his fuel over the final 60 laps, and win his first career race, and the first win for car owner Tony Bettenhausen. But in the final ten laps, Carpentier had to slow down to conserve fuel. Paul Tracy began charging to the front, passing Alex Zanardi for second with four laps to go, and set his sights on the leader. Coming out of turn four on lap 234, Tracy made a slingshot pass to take the lead with two laps to and went on to win.|$|R

5000|$|The {{following}} day the second qualifying session {{opened with a}} dry track but <b>threatening</b> <b>skies.</b> Several LMP2 and LMGTE teams were able to improve their qualifying times in the opening {{half an hour of}} the session before rainfall started.

[...] Pegasus Racing led the few improved times in the LMP2 category to earn the fifteenth position. Porsche No. 1 was the fastest in the session but its lap time was over three seconds off the provisional pole position. The second session ended without the track drying again and no times were improved in any category. All four Aston Martins chose to not set lap times in the session as they changed their engines. [...] The third qualifying session began an hour later under a light rain but soon turned to deluge within ten minutes, prompting race officials to stop qualifying for nearly an hour as several cars aquaplaned. When the rain tapered off and qualifying resumed, many teams chose not to participate or set a large number of lap times as no improvements could be made to qualifying lap times.|$|R

5000|$|In June-August 2008 {{the fleet}} of KrasAir, a Krasnoyarsk-based airline with a {{controlling}} state interest, was grounded by the fuel suppliers' refusal to extend {{credit to the}} company that defaulted on payments. Other members of AiRUnion consortium, notably Dalavia, also folded in August. Thousands of passengers were stranded in airports; flight delays and cancellations became a national agenda. Government action focused on setting the cap on jet fuel prices and restructuring its assets into a new company managed by Rostechnologii, a newly formed state conglomerate. Ministry of Transportation distributed the licenses to fly former KrasAir routes to other companies. KrasAir also defaulted on payments to its staff, and on 27 October a strike action, coupled with fuel suppliers' denial of service, finally ruined the airline. Dalavia lost its license earlier in October. The collapse of KrasAir also <b>threatened</b> <b>Sky</b> Express, Russia's first low cost carrier co-owned by the EBRD and former manager of KrasAir. 22 October the assets of bankrupt KrasAir, Domodedovo Airlines, Samara Airlines and Atlant-Soyuz Airlines were consolidated in a new company, Rosavia, co-financed by the City of Moscow and Rostekhnologii. Rossiya, Orenair, Kavminvodyavia, Vladivostok Air, Dalavia and Saravia were originally planned to join this proposed airline holding company, too, which would have made Rosavia the largest Russian airline by fleet size. Following a 20 percent drop of domestic passenger numbers in Russia per month, the federal government scrapped all plans concerning the new airline on 5 March 2009 ...|$|R
50|$|Terrile's angels {{are common}} men and women, alone, in couples or in groups. They can be {{surrounded}} by a <b>threatening,</b> dark <b>sky</b> or placed in a relaxed garden-like atmosphere.

(As a matter of fact, Terrile's angels look at first sight as carefully contrived photomontage.)
