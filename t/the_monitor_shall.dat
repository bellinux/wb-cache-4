40|$|Software is {{the crux}} of many commercial, {{industrial}} and military systems. The software systems {{need to be very}} reliable especially in case of safety critical systems. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and manned aircraft are safety critical systems and hence failures related to software or software-hardware interaction leads to huge problems. The software systems need to be certified before they are deployed. Even after being certified several accidents and incidents have occurred and are occurring. The software errors can occur during any phase of software development. The reliability of the software is enhanced using the verification process. Runtime monitoring has various advantages over testing and model checking. Hence this thesis work explores runtime <b>monitoring</b> of UAV. <b>The</b> runtime <b>monitoring</b> <b>shall</b> verify <b>the</b> run of the current system state. <b>The</b> runtime <b>monitoring</b> <b>shall</b> <b>monitor</b> <b>the</b> health of the UAV and shall report to the operator about its status. The software faults and errors if not prevented shall lead to software failure. UAV lacks the situational awareness due to absence of pilot onboard. This motivated to use runtime <b>monitor</b> to enhance <b>the</b> situation awareness. <b>The</b> runtime <b>monitor</b> <b>shall</b> detect <b>the</b> software errors and avoid failures. This <b>monitor</b> <b>shall</b> also enhance <b>the</b> situational awareness of the remote operator. <b>The</b> runtime <b>monitor</b> that enhance situation awareness shall not only be applicable to specific UAV but this shall be applicable to all the UAV’s. Hence this work provides an independent Generic Runtime Monitor (GRM) to enhance the situation awareness. <b>The</b> runtime <b>monitor</b> has various methods but using formal specifications in specific using Linear Temporal Logic(LTL) to generate monitor is considered in this work. Runtime monitoring makes UAV more safe {{and at the same time}} reduces the costs as it verifies only the current run of the system state by providing a detection of critical errors. The situation awareness includes functional and environmental states that remote pilot shall not be aware of. The architecture plays vital role for the system design. GRM architecture is one such architecture which chalks out the overall independent system design for <b>the</b> runtime <b>monitoring</b> of <b>the</b> UAV system. This architecture is an extensible one. The generic requirements were elicited from different sources such as Aircraft Incidents and Accidents, Boeing Aero Magazine, Autonomous Rotorcraft Testbed for Intelligent Systems (ARTIS) requirements, generic Autonomy Levels for Unmanned Rotorcraft Systems (ALFURS) framework etc. The situation awareness can be categorized into three levels namely perception, comprehension and projection. The requirements were elicited for all the three levels of situation awareness. These requirements further formalized using temporal logics. The formalized requirements further translated into state automaton automatically...|$|R

40|$|As {{directed}} by the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE), Richland Operations Office (DOE-RL), Fluor Hanford, Inc. will implement the requirements of DOE Order 435. 1, Radioactive Waste Management, as the requirements relate to the continued operation of the low-level waste disposal facilities on the Hanford Site. DOE Order 435. 1 requires a disposal authorization statement authorizing operation (or continued operation) of a low-level waste disposal facility. The objective of this Order {{is to ensure that}} all DOE radioactive waste is managed in a manner that protects the environment and personnel and public health and safety. The manual (DOE Order 435. 1 Manual) implementing the Order states that a disposal authorization statement shall be issued based on a review of the facility's performance assessment and composite analysis or appropriate Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) of 1980 documentation. The disposal authorization shall specify the limits and conditions on construction, design, operations, and closure of the low-level waste facility. Failure to obtain a disposal authorization statement shall result in shutdown of an operational disposal facility. In fulfillment of the requirements of DOE Order 435. 1, a disposal authorization statement was issued on October 25, 1999, authorizing the Hanford Site to transfer, receive, possess, and dispose of low-level radioactive waste at the 200 East Area and the 200 West Area Low-Level Burial Grounds. The disposal authorization statement constitutes approval of the performance assessment and composite analysis, authorizes operation of the facility, and includes conditions that the disposal facility must meet. One of the conditions is that <b>monitoring</b> plans for <b>the</b> 200 East Area and 200 West Area Low-Level Burial Grounds be written and approved by <b>the</b> DOE-RL. <b>The</b> <b>monitoring</b> plan is to be updated and implemented within 1 year following issuance of the disposal authorization statement to incorporate and implement conditions specified in the statement.

40|$|In {{the field}} of {{environment}} protection, a series of European Directives with special emphasis on the water bodies has been approved as a cascade after the milestone Water Framework Directive (WFD) of the year 2000. The most recent piece of legislation, Directive 2009 / 90 /EC, points out the necessity of ensuring {{the quality of the}} analytical data and prescribes that the laboratories appointed by the Member States as responsible for <b>the</b> chemical water <b>monitoring</b> <b>shall</b> ‘‘demonstrate their competences [...] . by [...] . analysis of available reference materials [...] . ’’. Certified Reference Materials (CRMs) are the anchor points for comparability of measurement results, in both space and time, ensuring their traceability to a common reference. In this article, we present a critical overview of existing matrix CRMs, related to WFD monitoring needs. Our survey concerns available water, biota and sediment matrix CRMs for the 33 Priority Substances (PSs) (and the eight ‘‘other certain pollutants’’) listed in the WFD, together with a reference to discontinued CRMs. Tables providing a more synoptic view are available on-line as supplementary information. For the four priority metals (Cd, Pb, Hg and Ni), there are sufficient CRMs for all matrices considered to cover the needs of <b>the</b> <b>monitoring</b> laboratories, but there is a serious lack of matrix CRMs for most of the organic PSs. Also, for the matrix water, there are no materials available for organic pollutants that could be classified as CRMs as commonly understood. We also briefly discuss pure compounds and solution CRMs for calibration purposes. In the final section, we show how a CRM could be used in the estimation of measurement uncertainty for checking compliance at the Environmental Quality Standard level, according to the technical specifications given in Directive 2009 / 90 /EC.

40|$|Part I Introduction and {{justification}} of <b>the</b> <b>Monitor</b> Building with Nature This report describes <b>the</b> <b>Monitor</b> Building with Nature in the IJsselmeer region. When {{it comes to}} implementing the concept of building with nature the main issue is not how it is technically possible, but whether stakeholders consider it possible and desirable. <b>The</b> <b>monitor</b> gives insight into perceptions of stakeholders and provides possibilities for improvements in decision making and in generating societal support for Building with Nature projects. The project that developed this monitor {{is part of the}} Building with Nature research and innovations programme. <b>The</b> <b>monitor</b> has <b>the</b> following goals: Describe the (changes in) perceptions and actions related to ‘building with nature’ in hydraulic engineering projects. Among which: 1. Describe the situation of the project at the start of <b>the</b> <b>monitoring,</b> include <b>the</b> history of the project, the broad context, the assignment of the project, and the (formal) involvement of stakeholders. 2. Make an inventory of the (developments in) observed threats and opportunities at project level (design, project management, process). 3. Make an inventory of the (developments in) observed threats and opportunities for building with nature within the external field of force. 4. Make an inventory of perceptions related to improvements and the involvement of the different stakeholders. The focus of <b>the</b> <b>monitor</b> is on perceptions of people who are involved in hydraulic engineering projects. For the development of <b>the</b> <b>monitor,</b> existing monitor approaches are used. The focus of <b>the</b> <b>monitor</b> is gathering of information and has characteristics of constructivist <b>monitoring.</b> However, <b>the</b> <b>monitor</b> aims to show the diversity of the available perceptions and actions. The focus of <b>the</b> <b>monitor</b> is not merely on ‘learning’, although when <b>the</b> <b>monitor</b> is used in meetings or workshops, it can contribute to learning about building with nature. <b>The</b> <b>monitor</b> is qualitative of nature, with implicit use of indicators. <b>The</b> <b>monitor</b> is one of <b>the</b> initiatives of <b>monitoring</b> within <b>the</b> Research programme Building with Nature. One other initiative is for example <b>the</b> <b>monitoring</b> of <b>the</b> Community of Practice in the IJsselmeer region. Part II <b>The</b> <b>Monitor</b> – Questionnaire In preparing for the use of <b>the</b> <b>monitor,</b> three main questions are to be asked. The first question is: what is the focus in the project? The second question is: who are the respondents and why? There are no universal criteria, nor are these desirable. And the third question is: how do we use the questionnaire? Are we interested in doing face to face interviews, or interviews by phone? How the questionnaire is used depends largely on the goal of <b>the</b> <b>monitor</b> and <b>the</b> resources (i. e. time, money, people) availableThe questionnaire consists of four different parts. Part A discusses issues related to building with nature within the project and deals with stakeholders’ perceptions of the concept. Part B discusses factors influencing the feasibility of building with nature. Part C is about placing issues on the agenda and possibilities for improvements. Part D rounds up the questionnaire. For analysing the results of <b>the</b> <b>monitor</b> <b>the</b> following elements compromise the framework of analysis: 1. Aspects perceived as characteristic for building with nature 2. Aspects of building with nature in the project 3. Best practices of building with nature according to respondents 4. Perceptions of factors and conditions which stimulate or obstruct building with nature. 5. Perceptions of the future and future possibilities for realizing building with nature 6. Perceptions of action perspectives to realize building with nature on large scale in multiple 7. projects in the IJsselmeer region. Part III <b>The</b> <b>Monitor</b> tested To test <b>the</b> <b>monitor</b> two projects were selected as pilots: the dike strengthening project Edam- Amsterdam and the silt catch pit. Applying <b>the</b> <b>monitor</b> in these projects has lead to an improved version of <b>the</b> <b>monitor</b> and lessons learned on how to apply <b>the</b> <b>monitor.</b> It was not possible to apply <b>the</b> <b>monitor</b> itself in <b>the</b> dike strengthening project, although the process was very useful. We found that interesting projects to apply <b>the</b> <b>monitor</b> also are subject to sensitive issues. Great concern is necessary to deal with these issues. Therefore, sensitive issues require more preparation time. In the project ‘silt catch pit’ we were able to apply <b>the</b> <b>monitor</b> and make a case description of the project. Applying the questionnaire and developing the case description lead to improvements of <b>the</b> <b>monitor</b> and recommendations on its use. On the development of <b>the</b> <b>monitor,</b> <b>the</b> following is concluded: •Applying <b>the</b> <b>monitor</b> results in a broad insight into the feasibility of the building with nature concept, factors which are of influence and insight into the decision making in building with nature projects. •It is recommended to have an exploratory interview before using the questionnaire. This is necessary to gain enough information relevant for the case description, gain permission to apply <b>the</b> <b>monitor</b> and get in contact with the relevant stakeholders. •Applying <b>the</b> <b>monitor</b> in <b>the</b> silt catch pit showed that it is very suitable to find factors influencing the feasibility of building with nature in projects. Because it was only possible to develop one pilot, we recommend to again reflect critically on <b>the</b> <b>monitor</b> when applied. •Sensitive issues may make a project an (more) interesting one for applying <b>the</b> <b>monitor.</b> However, it may be more difficult to acquire permission for application and it may require more time. During application of <b>the</b> <b>monitor</b> one {{should be aware of the}} issues. Demarcation of concepts is important for the sake of comparing results, as the questionnaires are used for different persons and in different moments in time •The questionnaire can be combined with workshops or meetings to stimulate the realization of the building with nature concept. •The case description is based on a monitor that is incomplete and is part of developing <b>the</b> <b>monitor.</b> Therefore <b>the</b> case description should not be used as a complete example and should be considered together with the conclusions and recommendations made...|$|R
