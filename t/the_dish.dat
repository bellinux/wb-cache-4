5|$|Carrot soup can be {{prepared}} as a cream-style soup and as a broth-style soup. Vegetable stock or chicken stock {{can be used as}} ingredients in both styles of soup. Other vegetables may be used in <b>the</b> <b>dish,</b> including root vegetables, the latter of which may include garlic onion, shallot, potato, turnip and others. Carrot juice and orange juice can be used in its preparation, and some versions are prepared using puréed carrot. After cooking, <b>the</b> <b>dish</b> can be run through a sieve to strain it. The carrots used can be peeled or unpeeled, and the use of peeled carrots can lend to increased smoothness in puréed versions of <b>the</b> <b>dish.</b> Those prepared with puréed carrot may have a thick consistency while also being smooth in texture. The soup's color can vary based upon the coloration of the carrots used. Young carrots tend to make the soup sweeter and imbue it with a bright orange coloration, while older, larger carrots provide less sweetness and may imbue a yellow coloration. The use of old, cracked carrots that have a woody texture in their interior can produce a soup of inferior quality.|$|E
