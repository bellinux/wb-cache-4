5|$|In {{overhauling}} {{the structure}} of the premises, the National Trust restored its medieval character by recreating on the ground floor the appearance of arcaded stalls opening onto the street, and the sixteenth-century decoration of <b>the</b> <b>upstairs</b> windows, although this caused a dilemma as it required the removal of fine 18th-century windows.|$|E
5|$|Inscribed on {{the front}} of the dome, above the main entrance, are two poetic lines, written by Welsh poet Gwyneth Lewis in the Welsh and English languages. The {{lettering}} is formed by windows in <b>the</b> <b>upstairs</b> bar areas and is internally illuminated at night.|$|E
5|$|On 6 March 1928, Schindler married Emilie Pelzl (1907–2001), {{daughter}} of a prosperous Sudeten German farmer from Maletein. The young couple moved in with Oskar's parents and occupied <b>the</b> <b>upstairs</b> rooms, where they lived {{for the next seven}} years.|$|E

5|$|The second-floor {{served as}} the main {{sleeping}} quarters. It consists of a few simple bedrooms, all historically without closets. <b>The</b> <b>upstairs</b> hall contains a door which once accessed a staircase to the widow's walk, {{what remains of the}} space {{has been used as a}} closet for over a century.|$|E
5|$|A larger crowd {{attended}} on {{the second}} day, including more men. Amelia Bloomer arrived late and took a seat in <b>the</b> <b>upstairs</b> gallery, there being none left in the main seating area. Quaker James Mott was well enough to attend, and he chaired the morning meeting; it was still too radical a concept that a woman serve as {{chair in front of}} both men and women.|$|E
5|$|A Miss Williams {{from nearby}} Borley Lodge said {{she saw the}} figure of the ghostly nun in <b>the</b> <b>upstairs</b> window and, {{according}} to Harry Price, demanded a fee of one guinea for her story. In August 1943, Price conducted a brief dig in the cellars of the ruined house and discovered two bones thought to be of a young woman. The bones were given a Christian burial in Liston churchyard, after the parish of Borley refused to allow the ceremony to take place on account of the local opinion that the bones found were those of a pig.|$|E

5|$|In {{its first}} {{operating}} year, a stable {{was built for}} the lodge, at the lodge's south driveway about 100 yards from Scarborough Road. In 1909 an addition was built (of 62 by 126 feet) and the entire structure became used for an automobile garage. The interior of the old stable was replaced. The east end held a commercial kitchen, dining room, and a billiard and smoking room. The west end held a repair shop. The {{front of the building}} held supply rooms, closets, and an office. <b>The</b> <b>upstairs</b> held bedrooms and bathrooms for the chauffeurs.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1902, Potter sketched the {{interior}} of the third Lakefield Cottage belonging to a Mrs. Lord. These drawings included a watercolour and pen-and-ink sketches of the living-room, pen-and-ink sketches of the pots of geraniums on the living-room window sill, the entrance passage, the pantry, the stairs, some of <b>the</b> <b>upstairs</b> rooms, and details of the carved oak furniture. In some of the sketches Potter roughly outlined a cat. She also sketched the village including the sloping path down to the Lakefield Cottages and the post office door. These became the backgrounds for The Pie and The Patty-Pan.|$|E
5|$|Norris had {{similarly}} scouted {{settings for}} his novel and chose <b>the</b> <b>upstairs</b> {{of a building}} {{on the corner of}} Polk and California street as McTeague's dentist office, as well as many of the saloons and lunch counters in the area. Stroheim discovered that many of the locations that Norris had described, such as Polk Street, had been destroyed in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, but he was able to find suitable period locations on Hayes and Laguna streets. For authenticity, Stroheim had no sets built in San Francisco and only redecorated existing locations, such as saloons, butcher shops, and wooden shacks, thus saving on construction costs.|$|E

5|$|On the {{hillside}} of the Colhugh Valley {{there are a}} row of houses situated at Hillhead in Llantwit Major. The houses {{were built in the}} early years of the 19th century for the poor of the parish. With the introduction of the Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834, a workhouse was opened in Bridgend. The houses became surplus to requirements and were then sold as private residences. Llantwit Major came under the Bridgend and Cowbridge Poor Law Union. Each unit was originally divided into two separate upper and lower accommodation, <b>the</b> <b>upstairs</b> entrance was from the west and the entrance to the lower accommodation came from the east.|$|E
5|$|The John Deere House {{was built}} in 1836 when Deere arrived in Grand Detour and the {{building}} was added onto as his family grew. It is furnished with period furniture and household objects {{that would have been}} common around the time the Deere family occupied the home. The house has two levels with four rooms on the main level and two rooms upstairs. Each of <b>the</b> <b>upstairs</b> rooms is accessible via a private staircase and it is believed one of the rooms was used by Deere's apprentices while the other was used as a children's bedroom.|$|E
5|$|The central {{chimney stack}} exists, but the {{back-to-back}} fireplaces have been blocked. The staircase may have originally been located {{to one side}} of the back-to-back fireplaces, but no evidence of this remains. There are two rooms on <b>the</b> <b>upstairs</b> floor, the southern one having been partitioned, plus an additional two rooms in the attic complete with modern fittings. The first floor and attic was used as a flat, with a kitchen, living room and office on the first floor, and two bedrooms in the attic. The roof is thought to be from around 1800 but has subsequently been strengthened.|$|E

5|$|The front entry {{leads into}} the living room where {{polished}} wood is found throughout as well as 19th century furnishings. The front room is part of the original building which consisted of one room. The room acted as the Deere's kitchen, living room, bedrooms, essentially everything. Deere eventually added onto the house, including a bedroom and an upstairs loft. The first floor bedroom would have been used for John and his wife, and possibly a couple of the children while <b>the</b> <b>upstairs</b> room would was used {{for the rest of the}} children. The Deeres left the home in 1847 when they moved to Moline, Illinois.|$|E
5|$|Next to {{the church}} is the Church House, which {{is also known as}} the Old School Room. <b>The</b> <b>upstairs</b> room was the local school from the mid or early 15th century, with the village poorhouse below. This has been a venue for social {{activity}} in the village and in 1971 underwent major renovation. It is a Grade II* listed building. Also close {{to the church}} is Chew Court, which was originally a bishop's palace. It was largely rebuilt in 1656, from which a little survives as the Chew Court of today including an Elizabethan doorway with Doric pilasters. The room over the gatehouse {{is said to have been}} used as a court-room, with the turrets used for holding prisoners. Chew Court is a Grade II* listed building.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} for {{the pilot}} took place in Los Angeles, though subsequent episodes of the series are filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia to save money. The bridge sequences were shot at Lake Piru, near a War of the Worlds filming location, and the library and phone booth scenes were filmed at an elementary school. Triplet babies portrayed Sam in the episode's teaser, and production {{found it difficult to}} get them to cry on cue. Though a real house served as the first-story level in the teaser, <b>the</b> <b>upstairs</b> was constructed on a sound stage because of the special effects required for Mary's fiery death. Script rewrites for the opening sequence—a better introduction for Sam was needed—required reshoots on the set of The O.C. two months after principal photography.|$|E

5|$|The {{interior}} of the crashed plane, in which Hank discovers a dead pilot and the $4.4 million in cash, was filmed on a soundstage. A second plane, designed to have frosted windows, was attached to a gimbal, about five feet off the ground. To match the interior with footage shot in Wisconsin, the art department built a set with real trees and a painted backdrop. To depict Hank being attacked by a flock of crows inside the plane, puppets were used to attack Paxton as he appeared on screen, while two live crows were used to attack an animatronic replica of the actor. A separate soundstage was used to create two sets depicting the interiors of the Mitchell home, where Hank and his wife Sarah (Fonda) reside. The first set was the main floor an exterior entrance way, and the second was created for <b>the</b> <b>upstairs</b> bedrooms. Principal photography concluded on March 13, 1998, after 55 days of filming.|$|E
5|$|The register's {{nomination}} gives {{details of}} the paneling and molding throughout the house. Entering through {{the front of the}} house leads to the central hall with a paneled wainscot below the chair rail, forward of the rising stairwell on the left. There is cornice molding and a molded chair rail with runners for the inside shutters. The woodwork in the west front room has a paneled fireplace and is wainscoted below the chair rail. The east rear room is divided in two, with one of the divisions being a bathroom. <b>The</b> <b>upstairs</b> rooms have molded chair rails and cased flair posts. However, the east front room lacks a fireplace while the western one is paneled as the first floor's front west room. The roof of the house is framed by sawn collar beams that were pegged to rafters which were hewn. The chimney stacks are angled so that they emerge symmetrically from the roof.|$|E
5|$|Everyone sits in silence, {{waiting for}} Parsons's manager to arrive. Jan {{suggests}} that Graham blow up another balloon for Tamsin. Sally, Si and Graham realise that, {{with the camera}} footage they have, they can blow up all the purple balloons and sell them to multiple bidders. Jan screams when she sees movement in Tamsin's bedroom, and it is realised that Frankie is still alive. Jan takes Tamsin {{out of the room}} and the remaining three agree, after panicked discussion, that they should kill Frankie. Si loses a coin toss and smothers Frankie with a cushion. Later, out on the street, Frankie's body is put into an ambulance. Si says to Sally and Graham that he will be in touch and leaves. Sally and Graham discuss selling the camcorder footage, and Jan runs inside to see that Tamsin is not in her chair or room. Upstairs, Tamsin crawls onto the bed containing the balloon, carrying a heart-shaped helium balloon. On the street, Sally, Graham and Jan see Tamsin opening <b>the</b> <b>upstairs</b> window. She releases the helium balloon with the balloon containing Frankie's breath attached. The two float skyward as Graham films.|$|E
