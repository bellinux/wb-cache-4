25|$|Although the Child Marriages Restraint Act {{makes it}} illegal for girls {{under the age}} of 16 to be married, {{instances}} of child marriages are commonly found in rural areas. Vani is a child marriage custom followed in tribal areas and the Punjab province. <b>The</b> <b>young</b> <b>girls</b> are forcibly married off in order to resolve the feuds between different clans; the Vani can be avoided if the clan of the girl agrees to pay money, called Deet, to other clans. Swara, Pait likkhi and Addo Baddo are similar tribal and rural customs that often promote marriage of girls in their early teenage years. In one extreme case in 2012, a local Jirga in Ashari village, Swat ordered that Roza Bibi, a girl of six, must be married off into a rival family to settle a dispute between her family and the rival family.|$|E

Appalled, the gardener lets <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>girl</b> and her son escape instead, handing her a bag of magic seeds. <b>The</b> <b>young</b> <b>girl</b> follows <b>the</b> river to its source, where the goddess tells her of an abandoned house where they can live. <b>The</b> <b>young</b> <b>girl</b> and her son prosper in the house, living off the food grown from the seeds.

Several fake Jonas Brothers songs, with lyrics about the band members' physical attractiveness, were written for [...] "The Ring". Some songs also emphasize the band's belief in sexual abstinence, with lyrics like, [...] "Who needs sex and drugs and partying when we can cook a meal and sit around and watch Netflix?" [...] The strongly erotic reactions of <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>girls</b> at their concert parody the frenzied female fan reactions the Jonas Brothers tend to elicit, even though their image projects wholesomeness and chastity.

[...] Maya Hathoray from The Miami Herald said that [...] "We know [...] sexy, exotically beautiful and her funk/pop songs make us want to dance, but on stage, she is extremely tame compared to her raw persona in her music videos. She is like daddy's little girl." [...] Mary Edgar Smith from The Atlanta Journal-Constitution observed that [...] "It was obvious from the apparel of <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>girls</b> at last week's Virgin Tour concerts in Tampa and Orlando, Fla., that the 26-year-old singer [...] had more {{to give to the}} music world than what others suggest. She will be {{a force to be reckoned}} with." [...] Stephen Holden from The New York Times commented, [...] "While her pubescent lookalike fans cheer approvingly, the star's manipulation of such symbols as a wedding gown, a cross, furs and jewels becomes a lighthearted communal psychodrama. Madonna has brought traditional little girl's games of dress-up and playing with dolls (using oneself as model) into the television age by turning them into a public spectacle." [...] A review in Variety by John Gleeson said that [...] "Madonna's singing was like a soundtrack to a more visceral display of herself, her persona, her nonstop dancing and her surprisingly explicit sexual dare, which included a visual climax—so to speak—to every other song." [...] Paul Grein from Billboard said that [...] "Madonna's show was stylish, well-paced and consistently entertaining." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1901, {{workers in}} Pennsylvania's silk mills went on strike. Many {{of them were}} young female workers {{demanding}} to be paid adult wages.

2500|$|A {{wide range}} of tools needed for agriculture, from {{ploughing}} to harvesting, were manufactured. The basic tool was a plough also known as meli, nanchil and kalappai. It consists of a wooden plank to tie the oxen and an iron bar attached to the plank, that tilled the land. This tool helped to bring the low-lying soil to the upper layer and send the top layer to the bottom, thereby aerating the land. For digging earth, a spade with wooden handle and a sharp terminal was used. A wooden leveler known as palli or maram was used to level the ploughed land. Palliyadutal refers {{to the process of}} removing weeds by means of a toothed implement attached to a plank and drawn by oxen. Farmers used a bullock-propelled contrivance called Kapilai for bailing out water from deep wells and a manual setup called Erram, for shallow wells. Water bales were also known as ampi and kilar. [...] Protecting the standing crops from stray animals and birds was an important activity and was carried out by young girls and lower-class peasants. While <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>girls</b> used rattles to scare birds away, the Kuravan and Kurathi used a stone-sling device called Kavan to drive away elephants and birds. It is said that an accurate shot from the sling could even kill an animal. Bugles and burning torches were other mechanisms used to keep wild animals away from the fields. Sickles were used for harvesting fully grown paddy and reaping the ripe ears of corn. The paddy grain was separated by thrashing the sheaths on the ground. Ears of millets were stamped on by farm workers and that of black gram were beaten by a stick.|$|E
