25|$|Following the siting {{guidelines}} and maps {{provided by the}} NCMC, the DVLMF looked at more than 50 potential memorial sites throughout the National Capital Area. Foundation leaders worked closely with D.C. government officials to identify a site. Ten sites were short-listed by the city and foundation, although the DVLMF only seriously considered six of these. The District pushed for the memorial to be located in an existing park-like triangle of land bounded by Washington Avenue SW, C Street SW, and 2nd Street SW. The site was southwest and {{across the street from}} the United States Botanic Garden's Bartholdi Fountain Park, and less than two blocks from the United States Capitol. The site was man-made, built using air rights when the tunnel carrying Interstate-395 was constructed from 1965 to 1973. The lot was city-owned, but the city was willing to transfer it to the National Park Service. Robert Hansen, the foundation's chief operating officer, praised D.C. officials for their assistance. Lois Pope personally agreed to the site selection. Key considerations for the DVLMF were the site's proximity <b>to</b> <b>Capitol</b> <b>Hill,</b> the museums of the Smithsonian Institution, and Washington Metro subway stations.
