5|$|Donald became King of Scotland. It is {{not certain}} what {{happened}} next, but an insertion in the Chronicle of Melrose states that Donald forced his three nephews into exile, although he was allied with another of his nephews, Edmund. John of Fordun wrote, centuries later, that an escort into England was arranged for <b>them</b> <b>by</b> <b>their</b> maternal uncle Edgar Ætheling.|$|E
5|$|After inheriting Osborne, the King had his mother's {{personal}} {{photographs and}} belongings removed {{and some of}} them destroyed, especially material relating to John Brown, whom he detested. Queen Victoria had intended the house to be a private, secluded residence for her descendants, away from the pomp and ceremony of mainland life. However, the new King had no need for the house and consulted his lawyers about disposing of it, transforming the main wing into a convalescent home, opening the state apartments to the public, and constructing a Naval College on the grounds. His plans met with strong disapproval from Beatrice and Louise. Queen Victoria had bequeathed them houses on the estate, and the privacy promised to <b>them</b> <b>by</b> <b>their</b> mother was threatened. When Edward discussed the fate of the house with them, Beatrice argued against allowing the house to leave the family, citing its importance to their parents.|$|E
5|$|In modern times, a {{wide variety}} of causes have contributed to the condor's decline. Its low clutch size (one young per nest), {{combined}} with a late age of sexual maturity, make the bird vulnerable to artificial population decline. Significant past damage to the condor population has also been attributed to poaching, especially for museum specimens, lead poisoning (from eating animals containing lead shot), DDT poisoning, electric power lines, egg collecting, and habitat destruction. During the California Gold Rush, some condors were even kept as pets. The leading cause of mortality in nestling condors is the ingestion of trash that is fed to <b>them</b> <b>by</b> <b>their</b> parents.|$|E

5|$|On February 5, 2001, a {{group of}} Wilkinson's {{creditors}} filed suit to have his companies seized. During the ensuing bankruptcy proceedings, Wilkinson admitted that his liabilities exceeded his assets by $300 million. During the proceedings, {{it was revealed that}} Wilkinson had been financially insolvent since 1992 and was operating a Ponzi scheme, paying his creditors with money borrowed from others rather than his own profits. He had paid no federal income taxes since 1991. At his deposition in June 2001, Wilkinson invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination over 140 times. Wallace's Bookstore was liquidated for just over $31 million, and ecampus.com was sold for $2.5 million. Wilkinson's wife, Martha, also filed for bankruptcy; his sons were forced to sell their homes to repay loans made to <b>them</b> <b>by</b> <b>their</b> father. During the bankruptcy proceedings, the Wilkinsons moved from Lexington to Naples, Florida.|$|E
5|$|In the club's {{formative}} years, West Bromwich Albion {{were run}} by a seven-man playing committee, and funded by each member contributing a weekly subscription of 6d (six pence) (2½p). Albion's first chairman was Henry Jackson, appointed in 1885, with the club becoming a limited company in June 1891. Other early chairmen of Albion included Jem Bayliss and Billy Bassett, both of whom had earlier played for the club. Indeed, from 1878 to 1986 there was always an Albion player or ex-player on the club's committee or board of directors. Bassett became an Albion director in 1905, following {{the resignation of the}} previous board in its entirety. The club was in deep financial trouble and had had a writ served upon <b>them</b> <b>by</b> <b>their</b> bank, but Bassett and returning chairman Harry Keys rescued the club, aided by local fund-raising activities. Bassett became chairman in 1908, and helped the club to avoid bankruptcy once more in 1910 by paying the players' summer wages from his own pocket. He remains Albion's longest-serving chairman, having held the position until his death in 1937. The club's longest-serving director was Major H. Wilson Keys, during the period 1930–1965, including 15 years as chairman. He became the FA's vice-president in 1969.|$|E
5|$|Rancho Grande {{was located}} at a {{mountain}} pass in {{a branch of}} the Andes known as the Venezuelan Coastal Range, which was an important migration route for butterflies, and the station proved very lucrative in the study of insects. During his work at Rancho Grande, Beebe broke his leg in a fall from a ladder, and the forced immobility which resulted from having his leg in a cast presented him with a new opportunity for observing the area's wildlife. At his request, he and his chair were transported into the nearby jungle, and as he sat motionless the wild animals around him soon began to go about their business without noticing his presence. His immobility also presented him with the opportunity to spend hours at a time observing a pair of bat falcons through binoculars, documenting the behavior of their two chicks and every prey item fed to <b>them</b> <b>by</b> <b>their</b> parents. His observations documented several behaviors which were new to science, including the first documented example of play in birds.|$|E

25|$|Depictions of East Asians began {{during the}} California Gold Rush when minstrels {{encountered}} Chinese out West.

Parodies of Japanese became popular when a Japanese acrobat troupe toured the U.S. beginning in 1865. A run of Gilbert and Sullivan's The Mikado in the mid-1880s inspired another wave of Asian characterizations.|$|E
25|$|Linguistic {{typology}} compares languages {{to classify}} <b>them</b> <b>by</b> <b>their</b> features.

Typological similarity does not imply a historical relationship. However, typological arguments can be used in comparative linguistics: one reconstruction may be preferred to another as typologically more plausible.|$|E

25|$|The Roman {{military}} readily adopted {{types of}} arms and armour that were effectively used against <b>them</b> <b>by</b> <b>their</b> enemies. Initially Roman troops were armed after Greek and Etruscan models, using large oval shields and long pikes. On encountering the Celts they adopted much Celtic equipment and again later adopted items such as the gladius from Iberian peoples. Later in Rome's history, it adopted practices such as arming its cavalry with bows in the Parthian style, and even experimented briefly with niche weaponry such as elephants and camel-troops.|$|E
25|$|From its {{induction}} {{into the}} Confederate Army, the Third Arkansas {{would go on}} {{to become one of the}} most distinguished and well respected Confederate regiments of the war. However, prior to their first battle actions, the first impressions of <b>them</b> <b>by</b> <b>their</b> fellow Confederates were, by written accounts since, not good. In several accounts, relayed by author and historian Mauriel P. Joslyn, the regiment was first seen as a poorly dressed and poorly equipped lot of ignorant country boys. Once proven in combat, however, those opinions of them would change dramatically.|$|E
25|$|In Paris, 'pedalling machines' proliferated, characterised by {{wheels of}} 1m or 1m 10 {{in front and}} 80cm at the back.
