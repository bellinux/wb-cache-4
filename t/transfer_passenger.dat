Vistara initially operated from level 4 of the terminal, which is being used by international passengers. In July 2015, they shifted to level 3, which will be used exclusively for domestic operations. Air India shifted all its domestic operations from Terminal 1B to T2 on 1 October 2015 making it the second airline to operate domestic flights from the T2 Terminal, to ease their International and Domestic <b>Transfer</b> <b>Passenger.</b> Jet airways shifted its domestic operations to T2 on 15 March 2016, facilitating a seamless transfer experience for its passengers.

40|$|Passenger flow is {{increasing}} dramatically with accomplishment of subway network system {{in big cities}} of China. As convergence nodes of subway lines, transfer stations need to assume more passengers due to amount transfer demand among different lines. Then, transfer facilities have to face great pressure such as pedestrian congestion or other abnormal situations. In order to avoid pedestrian congestion or warn the management before it occurs, it is very necessary to predict the <b>transfer</b> <b>passenger</b> flow to forecast pedestrian congestions. Thus, based on nonparametric regression theory, a <b>transfer</b> <b>passenger</b> flow prediction model was proposed. In order to test and illustrate the prediction model, data of <b>transfer</b> <b>passenger</b> flow for one month in XIDAN transfer station were used to calibrate and validate the model.

40|$|A {{framework}} is developed to calculate reliability from the passengers perspective in a multilevel public transit network. The major variables that impact reliability for <b>transfers</b> <b>passengers</b> are identified as: scheduled transfer time, headways of connecting lines, variation of vehicle operations, transfer walking time and proportion of <b>transferring</b> <b>passengers.</b> These variables are {{examined in the}} context of changing the scheduled transfer time in a hypothetical network and in the case that a holding strategy is added at the transfer point. It is shown that a trade-off exists between scheduled transfer time and reliability. Holding at a transfer point can be beneficial to <b>passengers</b> <b>transferring</b> to the held line, depending on the scheduled transfer time. The calculation method is applied to a cost-benefit analysis to a small example using data from the tram network in The Hague, Netherlands. Benefits to passengers are quantified from changes to the magnitude of a passenger’s travel time, including scheduled travel time and additional travel time, as well as the width of the travel time distribution using the reliability ratio as a value for reliability. Although it is difficult to set a schedule that benefits different groups of <b>transferring</b> <b>passengers,</b> it is possible to realize travel time and reliability benefits through scheduling.

40|$|Schiphol {{is a very}} {{important}} transfer hub for KLM and therefore short connection times are important to be competitive with other hubs. KLM sells flights with a minimal connection time of 40 minutes between European flights and 50 to, from, and between intercontinental flights. However passport control and security checks for transfer passengers can take much time resulting in missed (or delayed) flights. The passenger terminal at Schiphol is divided into a part for flights to and from Schengen countries which do not have border control between them (including most European countries) and a part for Non-Schengen countries. Transfer passengers crossing the Schengen border must pass passport control. Transfer passengers into the Schengen area also pass a security check (the transfer passengers to Non-Schengen countries have this check decentralised at the gate). Often congestion occurs at the border control and security check causing passengers to miss or delay flights. Therefore KLM would like to gain more insight into the performance and influence of border filters at the Non-Schengen/Schengen filter in the terminal on the <b>transfer</b> <b>passenger</b> process for flights of KLM. The main question is therefore formulated as follows: Which, when and why do problems occur in the <b>transfer</b> <b>passenger</b> process at Schiphol and how can this situation be improved for KLM?TILTransport, Infrastructure and LogisticsDelft University of Technolog...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. According to {{characteristics}} of passenger flow distribution in urban railway network, proportion factors were defined to present statistic {{characteristics of}} passenger distribution at stations. An agent-based simulation model {{was presented to}} describe interactive effect among passengers, stations and trains. Two series of scenario experiments were designed, considering passenger distribution at stations and trains frequency. Station factor experiments show that increase of <b>transfer</b> <b>passenger</b> proportion of major transfer direction has different effects on passenger numbers at stations with different locations. Train headway experiments show that adjustment of train service frequency in circle line, compared with radial line, has an obvious effect on passenger flow in network.

30|$|Walking time {{prediction}} aims {{to deduce}} waiting time and travel time for passengers {{and provide a}} quantitative basis for the subway schedule management. This model is founded based on <b>transfer</b> <b>passenger</b> flow and type of pedestrian facilities. Chaoyangmen station in Beijing was taken as the learning set to obtain the relationship between transfer walking speed and passenger volume. The sectional passenger volume of different facilities was calculated related to the transfer passage classification. Model parameters were computed by curve fitting with respect to various pedestrian facilities. The testing set contained four transfer stations with large passenger volume. It is validated that the established model is effective and practical. The proposed model offers a real-time prediction method with good applicability. It can provide transfer scheme reference for passengers, meanwhile, improve the scheduling {{and management of the}} subway operation.|$|E

40|$|The {{coexistence}} of high-speed rail (HSR) and airline in a busy transportation corridor generates {{competition between the}} two transportation modes. An unfair competition between HSR and airline not only reduces both revenues, but also triggers a series of social problems. Based on generalized costs, this paper proposes combining an improved gray prediction model, modified gravity model, and Logit model to predict the average passenger flow, induced passenger flow, and <b>transfer</b> <b>passenger</b> flow. According to the predicted results, we establish a game model that considers different stages of the HSR development. For demonstrative purposes, the approach is applied to an empirical study in China, that is, the competition between Beijing-Shenyang HSR and airline. Malignant fare war will make both parties lose out. Either mode that improves service quality will generate more revenue. If both parties improve the level of service, all incomes of the HSR, airline, and community increase. Results show the HSR contribution {{is greater than the}} airline in the case study...|$|E
40|$|Transfer {{passengers}} {{have quite}} different needs {{than those of}} originating and terminating passengers. For example, they do not make use of airport access roads. Other facilities {{may or may not}} be used depending on the type of transfers, the airport’s operational configuration and the airline services. Despite the increasing importance of transfer passengers for airport operations, little research has been done to determine their needs. This study analyses transfer passengers’ views on the quality of services at the terminal building, using data collected at Bandaranaike International Airport in Sri Lanka, which aspires along with the airline 'Sri Lankan' to be a major hub for South Asia. Regression analysis was used to identify the <b>transfer</b> <b>passenger</b> facilities and services with the strongest effect on the overall perception of level of service. The application of regression analysis to the data collected at Bandaranaike International Airport shows that the courtesy of the security check staff and the quality of the Flight Information Display are among the most valued by transfer passengers at that airport...|$|E

40|$|A {{flight is}} said to be delayed when an airline flight takes off and/or lands later than its {{scheduled}} time. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) considers a flight to be delayed when it is 15 minutes later than its scheduled time. Punctuality {{is one of the key}} performance indicators in the airline industry and an important service differentiator especially for valuable high-yield customers. In addition, improved on-time performance can help achieve significant cost savings. This is a critical issue in the air transportation industry since it generates lot of problems to the operation and the inconvenience for the passengers. Once a delay is occurred it is totally affected to the entire airline network and it will totally effect to the passengers. Flight delays are an inconvenience to passengers. A delayed flight can be costly to passengers by making them late to their personal scheduled events. A passenger who is delayed on a multi-plane trip could miss a connecting flight. Anger and frustration can occur in delayed passengers. This publishes a postgraduate thesis carried out under the topic “Identification of possible reasons that affect departure flight punctuality” and this is carried out as a case study on the National Carrier of Sri Lanka. This mainly focuses on identification of departure flight delays, identifying critical delay types and finding their reasons and finally identifying areas to develop policies and regulations which can be optimize the departure flight punctuality. The findings of the preliminary analysis represents that out of average total departures per day there are 6 % of Technical delays, 9 % of Unavoidable delays, and 8 % of Airport delays and 5 % of Air Traffic Control delays. The average delay times per departure flight are 1. 22 hrs if Technical delays, 0. 34 hrs if Unavoidable delays, 0. 16 hrs if Airport delays and 0. 10 hrs if Air Traffic Control delays. During the secondary data analysis, some areas were identified as the areas that can be regularized using new policy and regulations or change and develop existing policy and regulations to increase the departure flight punctuality. Some of them are new policy or policy development on A/C rotation, regular and periodic maintenance that can reduce technical errors and failures, scheduled maintenance that will help to manage operation time. Further it is identified that unscheduled maintenance will increase the delay, internal QC and QA on safety and security is a must, policy on recruit maintenance professionals will help to manage emergencies, additional maintenance will reduce engine start up time delays, increasing maintenance will avoid equipment failures, new policy or policy development on intoxicated passengers will reduces delays, new policy on intoxicated passengers will reduces delays, internal organizational policy and regulations can mitigate late reporting and new policy for <b>transfer</b> <b>passenger</b> and baggage timings. Under this study, only the delay data were considered to identify the areas that reduces the departure flight punctuality and any culture, society and the environment of the country were not taken into account. But the factors such as economic, social, environmental and political situation of the country, management changes, joint agreements, code share agreements, aircraft fleet changes, and new governmental policy and regulations also should be considered for the development and the implementation of new policy statements regarding the flight departure delays...|$|E
