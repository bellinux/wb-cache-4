40|$|Summary: Biceps <b>tenodesis</b> is {{indicated}} for partial biceps tendon tears or biceps tendon subluxation. We present our technique for arthroscopic biceps <b>tenodesis.</b> Key Words: Arthroscopic biceps <b>tenodesis.</b> Biceps tendinitis and partial tears are occasionallyisolated causes of significant shoulder pain but are more {{commonly found in}} conjunction with subacro-mial impingement and rotator cuff tears. 1 - 6 Although much has been described about arthroscopic subacro-mial decompression and rotator cuff repair, arthro-scopic biceps <b>tenodesis</b> is rarely mentioned. Our most common indication for <b>tenodesis</b> is a partial-thickness tear greater than 50 % diameter and the next most common indication is medial subluxation of the ten-don in association with a rotator cuff tear.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this retrospective multicenter {{study was to determine}} whether anatomic reconstruction or <b>tenodesis</b> produces better results in athletic patients with lateral ankle instability. Forty-one patients who underwent anatomic reconstruction and 36 patients who underwent <b>tenodesis</b> were followed up. The median preinjury Tegner score for both groups was 9 (range, 7 to 10). At follow-up, 2 to 10 years after surgical treatment, the median Tegner score for both groups was 8 (range, 4 to 10). In the <b>tenodesis</b> group, 17 patients had a lower Tegner score than before the operation, but in the anatomic reconstruction group only 4 patients had lower scores. Significantly more patients in the <b>tenodesis</b> group (15) had limited ankle dorsiflexion than in the anatomic reconstruction group (3). Plain radiographs revealed that 11 patients in the <b>tenodesis</b> group had medially located osteophytes, compared with only 2 patients in the anatomic reconstruction group. Stress radiographs revealed that more patients in the anatomic reconstruction group had normal laxity values than in the <b>tenodesis</b> group (38 and 28, respectively). According to the rating system developed by Good et al., 36 patients in the anatomic reconstruction group had a good or excellent result, versus 21 patients in the <b>tenodesis</b> group.

40|$|This study {{compared}} arthroscopic biceps <b>tenodesis</b> with biceps repair for isolated type II superior labrum anterior and posterior (SLAP) lesions {{in patients}} older than 35 years. The authors identified isolated type II SLAP lesions that were surgically managed over a 5 -year period. Minimum 2 -year follow-up data {{were available for}} 22 patients who underwent biceps repair (repair group) and for 15 patients who underwent a primary biceps <b>tenodesis</b> (<b>tenodesis</b> group). Mean age at surgery was 45. 2 ± 5. 5 years in the repair group and 52. 0 ± 8. 0 years in the <b>tenodesis</b> group. In the repair group, functional outcome improved from baseline to final follow-up using the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) (47. 5 to 87. 4, respectively; P<. 0001) and University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) scores (18. 5 to 31. 2, respectively; P<. 0001). In the <b>tenodesis</b> group, {{similar findings were observed}} for the ASES (43. 4 to 89. 9, respectively; P<. 0001) and UCLA scores (19. 0 to 32. 7, respectively; P<. 0001). No difference was found in functional outcome between the groups. Full range of motion recovery was delayed by approximately 3 months in the repair group compared with the <b>tenodesis</b> group (P=. 0631). Two patients in the repair group required a secondary capsular release. Seventy-seven percent of patients in the repair group and 100 % of patients in the <b>tenodesis</b> group were satisfied and returned to normal activity (P=. 0673). In the current study, individuals older than 35 years with an isolated type II SLAP lesion had a shorter postoperative recovery, a more predictable functional outcome, and a higher rate of satisfaction and return to activity with a biceps <b>tenodesis</b> compared with a biceps repair. Based on these observations, biceps <b>tenodesis</b> is preferable to biceps repair for isolated type II SLAP lesions in nonoverhead athletes older than 35 years...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To (1) better {{define the}} anatomy of the {{proximal}} shoulder {{in relation to the}} long head of the biceps tendon, (2) compare the length-tension relationship of the biceps tendon in the native shoulder with that after arthroscopic and open <b>tenodesis</b> tech-niques using interference screws, and (3) provide surgical recommendations for both procedures based on study findings. Study Design: Descriptive laboratory study. Methods: Twenty fresh-frozen cadaveric shoulders were dissected for analysis. Initial anatomic measurements involving the prox-imal long head of the biceps tendon (BT) were made, which included: the labral origin to the superior bicipital groove (LO-SBG), the total tendon length (TTL), the musculotendinous junction (MTJ) to the inferior pectoralis major tendon border, the MTJ to the super-ior pectoralis major tendon border, and the biceps tendon diameter (BTD) at 2 different <b>tenodesis</b> locations. These same measure-ments were made again after completing a simulated suprapectoral arthroscopic and open subpectoral <b>tenodesis,</b> both with interference screw fixation. Statistical comparisons were then made between the native anatomy and that after <b>tenodesis,</b> with the goal of assessing the accuracy of re-establishing the normal length-tension relationship of the long head of the BT after simulated arthroscopic suprapectoral and open subpectoral <b>tenodesis</b> with <b>tenodesis</b> screws. Results: For all cadavers, themean TTL was 104. 1 mm.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{meta-analysis}} was to assess whether there were differences in the outcomes between tenotomy and <b>tenodesis</b> in treating LHBT lesions combined with rotator cuff repairs. Using Medline, Embase, and Cochrane, we searched for articles comparing tenotomy and <b>tenodesis</b> combined with rotator cuff repair which were published before April 2016 with the terms "biceps", "tenotomy", "tenodesis", and "rotator cuff". The controlled clinical studies that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were assessed for quality of methodology by utilizing the Coleman score. On {{the basis of the}} inclusion and exclusion criteria, ten articles (903 patients) were included in this meta-analysis. The Coleman score ranged between 40 and 89 in the included studies. The results showed that the incidence of the popeye sign (OR, 2. 777, P = 0. 000) were higher in tenotomy group compared with <b>tenodesis</b> group when concomitant rotator cuff repair. Statistically significant difference in favor of <b>tenodesis</b> was observed for Constant score (SMD, - 0. 230, P = 0. 025).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to assess the {{association}} of concomitant biceps <b>tenodesis</b> in total shoulder arthroplasty with treatment success 1 year after total shoulder arthroplasty. Of 136 consecutive shoulders (124 patients) undergoing primary total shoulder arthroplasty between 2003 and 2006, 54 (39. 7 %) underwent biceps <b>tenodesis.</b> For each patient, we obtained potential preoperative confounding data, such as age; gender; presence of rheumatoid arthritis; Short Form 36; number of previous shoulder operations; Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand score; Shoulder Pain and Disability Index score; and insurance status. At the 1 -year follow-up, we calculated the Constant score of all patients (ranging from 0 [worst] to 100 [best]). We first determined the crude association of concomitant biceps <b>tenodesis</b> with 1 -year treatment success (Constant score > or = 80) and then fitted a multivariate model correcting for potential confounders to assess the adjusted association of the biceps <b>tenodesis</b> on treatment success. The total number of treatment successes was 46 of 136 shoulders (33. 8 % of all prosthesis implantations). The crude association (odds ratio) of a concomitant biceps <b>tenodesis</b> with treatment success was 2. 38 (95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 15 to 4. 93; P =. 02).

40|$|Abstract Background Bioabsorbable {{interference}} {{screw fixation}} has superior biomechanical properties compared to suture anchor fixation for biceps <b>tenodesis.</b> However, {{it is unknown}} whether fixation technique influences clinical results. Hypothesis We hypothesize that subpectoral interference screw fixation offers relevant clinical advantages over suture anchor fixation for biceps <b>tenodesis.</b> Study Design Case Series. Methods We performed a retrospective review of a consecutive series of 88 patients receiving open subpectoral biceps <b>tenodesis</b> with either interference screw fixation (34 patients) or suture anchor fixation (54 patients). Average follow up was 13 months. Outcomes included Visual Analogue Pain Scale (0 – 10), ASES score, modified Constant score, pain at the <b>tenodesis</b> site, failure of fixation, cosmesis, deformity (popeye) and complications. Results There were no failures of fixation in this study. All patients showed significant improvement between their preoperative and postoperative status with regard to pain, ASES score, and abbreviated modified Constant scores. When comparing IF screw versus anchor outcomes, there was no statistical significance difference for VAS (p = 0. 4), ASES score (p = 0. 2), and modified Constant score (P = 0. 09). One patient (3 %) treated with IF screw complained of persistent bicipital groove tenderness, versus four patients (7 %) in the SA group (nonsignificant). Conclusion Subpectoral biceps <b>tenodesis</b> reliably relieves pain and improves function. There was {{no statistically significant difference}} in the outcomes studied between the two fixation techniques. Residual pain at the site of <b>tenodesis</b> may be an issue when suture anchors are used in the subpectoral location. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background: Pathology of {{the long}} head of the biceps (LHB) is a well-recognized cause of {{shoulder}} pain in the adult population and can be managed surgically with tenotomy or <b>tenodesis.</b> Purpose: To compare the biomechanical strength of an all-arthroscopic biceps <b>tenodesis</b> technique that places the LHB distal to the bicipital groove in the suprapectoral region with a more traditional mini-open subpectoral <b>tenodesis.</b> This study also evaluates the clinical outcomes of patients who underwent biceps <b>tenodesis</b> using the all-arthroscopic technique. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study and case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: For the biomechanical evaluation of the all-arthroscopic biceps <b>tenodesis</b> technique, in which the biceps tendon is secured to the suprapectoral region distal to the bicipital groove with an interference screw, 14 fresh-frozen human cadaveric shoulders (7 matched pairs) were used to compare load to failure and displacement at peak load with a traditional open sub-pectoral location. For the clinical evaluation, 49 consecutive patients (51 shoulders) with a mean follow-up of 2. 4 years who underwent an all-arthroscopic biceps <b>tenodesis</b> were evaluated using the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score preoperatively and at last follow-up, {{as well as the}} University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Shoulder Score at last follow-up.

40|$|Background: Proximal biceps {{pathology}} is {{a significant}} factor in shoulder pain. Surgical treatment options include biceps tenotomy and subpectoral biceps <b>tenodesis.</b> Tenotomy is a simple procedure, but it may produce visible deformity, subjective cramping, or loss of supination strength. <b>Tenodesis</b> is a comparatively technical procedure involving a longer recovery, but it has been hypothesized to achieve better outcomes in younger active patients (< 55 years). Hypothesis: This study investigated the outcomes of younger patients who underwent either a biceps tenotomy or <b>tenodesis</b> as part of treatment for shoulder pain. The hypothesis was that, apart from cosmetic deformity, there will be no difference in outcome between the 2 treatment options. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: Isometric strength and endurance testing of operative and nonoperative shoulders for forearm supination (FS) and elbow flexion (EF) were tested utilizing an isometric dynamometer. Objective physical assessment was also performed. Subjective outcomes using the modified American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score (ASES); Disability of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH); visual analog scale (VAS); and perceived biceps symptoms were collected. Results: A total of 42 patients (22 tenotomy, 20 <b>tenodesis)</b> with an average follow-up of 3. 3 years were studied. The average age at follow-up was 49. 9 years. Thirty-five percent (7 / 20) of tenotomy patients exhibited a ‘‘Popeye’ ’ deformity, compared with 18. 2 % (4 / 22) of <b>tenodesis</b> patients.

40|$|Background: Irreparable peroneus brevis tendon {{tears are}} uncommon, {{and there is}} scant {{evidence}} {{on which to base}} operative treatment. Options include tendon transfer, segmental resection with <b>tenodesis</b> to the peroneus longus tendon, and allograft reconstruction. However, the relative effectiveness of the latter 2 procedures in restoring peroneus brevis function has not been established. Methods: Custom-made strain gage-based tension transducers were implanted into the peroneus longus and brevis tendons near their distal insertions in 10 fresh-frozen cadaver feet. Axial load was applied to the foot, and the peroneal tendons and antagonistic tibialis anterior and posterior tendons were tensioned to 50 % and 100 % of physiologic load. Distal tendon tension was recorded in this normal condition and after sequential peroneus brevis-to-longus <b>tenodesis</b> and peroneus brevis allograft reconstruction. Measurements were made in 5 foot inversion/eversion and plantarflexion/dorsiflexion positions. Results: Distal peroneus brevis tendon tension after allograft reconstruction significantly exceeded that measured after <b>tenodesis</b> in all tested loading conditions (P 0. 022). With 50 % of physiologic load applied, peroneus brevis tension was 1 % to 28 % of normal (depending on foot position) after <b>tenodesis</b> and 73 % to 101 % of normal after allograft reconstruction. Under the 100 % loading condition, peroneus brevis tension was 6 % to 43 % of normal after <b>tenodesis</b> and 88 % to 99 % of normal after reconstruction with allograft. Distal peroneus longus tension remained within 20 % of normal under all operative and loading conditions. Conclusion: Allograft reconstruction of a peroneus brevis tendon tear in this model substantially restored distal tension when the peroneal tendons and their antagonists were loaded to 50 % and 100 % of physiologic load. <b>Tenodesis</b> to the peroneus longus tendon did not effectively restore peroneus brevis tension under the tested conditions.

30|$|Creation of {{improved}} rotational stability with lateral extra-articular reconstruction or <b>tenodesis</b> {{is a reasonable}} strategy to improve knee biomechanical properties of internal tibial rotation after failed ACL reconstructions. A few studies {{have looked at the}} impact of supplemental lateral <b>tenodesis</b> on the outcome after ACL revision reconstruction. One multicentre study demonstrated a reduced incidence of a positive pivot shift, but overall International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC)-evaluated knee stability did not improve as a result of lateral <b>tenodesis</b> in combination with ACL reconstruction [96]. A biomechanical study using intraoperative navigation during revision ACL reconstruction demonstrated that addition of a lateral <b>tenodesis</b> resulted in improved tibial rotational stability at high flexion, but had no influence on sagittal stability [17]. In patients with ACL graft failure, an ALL reconstruction or lateral <b>tenodesis</b> could be considered in cases of high grade pivot shift, hyperlaxity and the desire to return to rotational sport activities. The improved biomechanical control of rotation by the lateral reconstruction could protect the new ACL graft during risk activities and return to sports. So far, no clinical studies have demonstrated that ALL reconstruction can reduce failure rates after ACL revision nor improve subjective outcomes or function. Despite this, one randomized controlled study for ACL revision patients with 100 patients randomized to ACL revision with or without ALL reconstruction using allograft tendon tissue is ongoing at the time of writing (NCT 02680821).|$|E

From 1999 to 2001, 22 patients had an arthroscopic rotator cuff repair and associated biceps tendon lesions that were repaired with two new arthroscopic techniques of <b>tenodesis</b> incorporating the biceps tendon in the rotator cuff suture. Patients were randomised into one of two groups: <b>tenodesis</b> without tenotomy (group 1) and <b>tenodesis</b> with tenotomy (group 2). Preoperative and postoperative functions were assessed by means of a modified UCLA rating scale and shoulder ROM. The mean follow-up period was 47. 2  months (range 36 – 59). In group 1 (<b>tenodesis</b> without tenotomy), eight patients had an excellent postoperative score and three a good postoperative score. The UCLA rating system used for evaluation showed a statistically significant improvement from the preoperative average rating of 10. 5 (5 – 15) to the postoperative average score of 33 (29 – 35) (P< 0. 05). In group 2 (<b>tenodesis</b> with tenotomy), the UCLA rating system used for evaluation showed a statistically significant improvement from the preoperative rating of 11. 1 to the postoperative score of 32. 9 (P< 0. 05). No statistically significant difference in the total UCLA scores was found when comparing the repairs performed with or without tenotomy. Follow-up results with regard to ROM were not different between the two groups, and the range of motion was improved in all measured directions.

Conclusion: This study showed that the difference in UCLA scores was statistically significant. The group with tenotomy and <b>tenodesis</b> of the long head of the biceps presented better functional results...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: simple tenotomy in the {{treatment}} of long head biceps (LHB) lesion offers good results, as well as tenotomy/ <b>tenodesis.</b> Materials and methods: we prospectively evaluated 252 patients, divided into 3 groups, treated with rotator cuff repair associated with LHB tenotomy or 2 different types of <b>tenodesis</b> in cases where there had been a partial lesion of the LHB or instability of the bicipital groove. We ascertained whether there was residual pain and the presence of the “Popeye sign” in the post-operative stage. Results: patients who underwent tenotomy alone achieved an improvement on the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), Simple Shoulder Test (SST) and modified UCLA shoulder rating compared to patients who underwent LHB <b>tenodesis.</b> A positive Popeye sign is poorly perceived by patients. Conclusion: we considered the LHB tenotomy as treatment of choice for the rotator cuff surgical repair when there was an evident LHB lesio...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Injury to {{the long}} head of the biceps (LHB) is a common source of pain in the shoulder, {{typically}} presenting with rotator cuff involvement. In the case of trauma to the LHB, patients may be indicated for a biceps tenotomy versus <b>tenodesis,</b> with the latter recommended for younger patients. The following case study will present a 22 -year-old Division III collegiate softball pitcher who sustained a traumatic, isolated proximal biceps rupture without rotator cuff damage. He was subsequently managed with biceps <b>tenodesis</b> and physical therapy, {{and was able to}} make a successful return to fast underhand softball pitching. Keywords: long head biceps tendon, <b>tenodesis,</b> arthroscopy, shoulder, pitcherT he long head of the biceps tendon (LHB) is an intra-articular structure of the shoul-der, running within the bicipital groove and exiting the intra-articular space. 24 Its exact role in glenohumeral mechanics is not definitive-ly understood, yet damage to the LHB tendon is a frequent source of pain in the shoulder. LHB pathology is divided into three types: instability...|$|E
40|$|BackgroundWrist {{stabilization}} {{for patient}} with spastic hand {{is an important}} issue with consequences on hygiene cares and pain but also on functional improvement of the handgrip. The {{purpose of this study was}} the comparison of two wrist stabilization methods. MethodsWe included 43 adults, 14 women and 29 men, with a mean age of 50. 4 years (14 – 68 years), with a severely spastic hand who underwent wrist stabilization, by <b>tenodesis</b> arthrodesis in 23 cases and shortening wrist arthrodesis in 20 cases, with an averaged follow-up of 67 months. The assessment criteria were: correction of wrist and fingers deformities, hygiene and pain improvement, the Fugl Meyer (FM) score and the House grasp score. ResultsThe results showed a good correction of the wrist deformity, 96 ° for arthrodesis and 75 ° for <b>tenodesis</b> (P= 0. 07), a good correction of fingers deformity with a correction of the palmar digital angle of 101, 3 ° for <b>tenodesis</b> and 93. 2 ° for arthrodesis (P= 0. 11). If both techniques are so similar in terms of hygiene (VAS= 8. 8) and post-operative pain (VAS= 0. 3 for <b>tenodesis,</b> 1. 5 for arthrodesis, P= 0. 12), there is however a difference in favour of wrist arthrodesis for the FM score both proximal subscore (1. 9 vs 0. 5, P= 0. 04) and distal subscore (1. 3 vs 0. 3, P= 0. 04) and the House grasp score (1. 4 vs 0. 8, P= 0. 19). ConclusionsThe results of arthrodesis did change our wrist stabilization technique because it presents several advantages: no conflict with the extensor tendons, no need to remove hardware when using dorsal plates, a systematic wrist correction with extension of 20 °, no loss of correction by <b>tenodesis</b> dropping, a better functional gain for grasping and proximal and distal function...|$|E
30|$|Due to biceps tendon {{pathology}} (instability, tendinitis, degeneration) in both study groups, biceps tenotomy or <b>tenodesis</b> {{was always}} performed (group  1 : 16 tenotomies, 4 tenodesis; group  2 : 20 tenotomies).|$|E
40|$|Background/Purpose: Superior labrum {{anterior}} and posterior (SLAP) lesion repair poses {{a significant}} discussion {{due to its}} high failure rate. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine in which indications it is better to perform a <b>tenodesis</b> than a straight anatomical repair. The hypothesis was that in middle-aged patients and in those who did not suffer from a traumatic lesion, it is better to perform a long biceps tendon (LBT) <b>tenodesis</b> than a straight anatomical repair. Methods: A total of 22 patients between the ages of 19  years and 55  years who underwent SLAP lesion repair between 2007 and 2011 were reviewed. The cases were divided into the following two groups: those with an isolated SLAP lesion (15 patients) and those with both a SLAP and a Bankart lesion (7 patients). This was a level IV longitudinal and retrospective study. Results: Eight patients had persistent postoperative pain, which required to be revised from an anatomical repair to an LBT <b>tenodesis.</b> All of these patients were in the isolated SLAP lesion group. The average time between primary surgery and revision was 21. 6  months. Patients over the age of 45  years had significantly poorer results after the repair. Conclusion: Biceps <b>tenodesis</b> is a feasible therapeutic alternative to anatomical repair for the treatment of SLAP lesions in middle-aged patients; the reinsertion failure rates for this type of lesion are rather discouraging due to the high percentage of revision surgeries that must be carried out after the primary intervention...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: This study {{reports the}} {{clinical}} {{results of the}} <b>tenodesis</b> of long head of the Biceps brachii tendon with bioabsorbable interference screw by minimal open procedure. Materials and Methods: Ten cases of 10 patients (7 male, 3 female) were included in this study. The average age was 45. 8 years old and the average period from the symptom onset to operation was 13. 7 months. Average preopera-tive ASES score was 38. 5. The causes of injury was; sports activities in 4 patients, unknown in 4 patients, industrial accident in 1 patient and traffic accident in 1 patient. The average follow up period was 12. 1 months. <b>Tenodesis</b> with bioabsorbable interference screw by minimal open precedure was performed in all cases. Results: The ASES score improved to 87. 5 at last follow up period and 6 cases had full range of motion of the shoulder. 4 cases had mild limited range of motion of the shoulder without any problem in normal daily activity.

40|$|Three {{methods of}} {{stabilizing}} the IP {{of the big}} toe were compared. In group A, 10 patients underwent <b>tenodesis</b> of the extensor hallucis longus to the extensor digitorum brevis tendon. All of them developed a toe-drop; two patients had significant symptoms that required IP fusion. In group B, 19 patients underwent IP fusion using smooth or threaded intramedullary Kirschner wire fixation. There were nine nonunions, three requiring refusion. In group C, 32 patients underwent IP fusion using intramedullary screw fixation. There was one nonunion with screw failure that required revision.

40|$|Arthroscopic {{rotator cuff}} tendon repair {{is a common}} {{elective}} procedure performed by trained orthopaedic surgeons with a relatively low complication rate. Specifically, isolated neuropraxia of the anterior interosseous nerve (AIN) is a very rare complication of shoulder arthroscopy. An analysis of peer-reviewed published literature revealed only three articles reporting a total of seven cases that describe this specific complication following standard shoulder arthroscopic procedures. This article reports on three patients diagnosed with AIN neuropraxia following routine shoulder arthroscopy done by a single surgeon within a three-year period. All three patients also underwent open biceps <b>tenodesis</b> immediately following completion of the arthroscopic procedures. The exact causal mechanism of AIN neuropraxia following shoulder arthroscopy with biceps <b>tenodesis</b> is not known. This case report reviews possible mechanisms with emphasis on specific factors that make a traction injury the most likely etiology in these cases. We critically analyze our operating room setup and patient positioning practices {{in light of the}} existing biomechanical and cadaveric research to propose changes to our standard practices that may help to reduce the incidence of this specific postoperative complication in patients undergoing elective shoulder arthroscopy with biceps <b>tenodesis...</b>|$|E
