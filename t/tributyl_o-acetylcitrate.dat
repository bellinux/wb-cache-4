40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{improvement}} of a bitterness sensor based on a lipid polymer membrane consisting of phosphoric acid di-n-decyl ester (PADE) as a lipid and bis(1 -butylpentyl) adipate (BBPA) and <b>tributyl</b> <b>o-acetylcitrate</b> (TBAC) as plasticizers. Although the commercialized bitterness sensor (BT 0) has high sensitivity and selectivity to the bitterness of medicines, the sensor response gradually decreases to almost zero after two years at room temperature and humidity in a laboratory. To reveal {{the reason for the}} deterioration of the response, we investigated sensor membranes by measuring the membrane potential, contact angle, and adsorption amount, as well as by performing gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). We found that the change in the surface charge density caused by the hydrolysis of TBAC led to the deterioration of the response. The acidic environment generated by PADE promoted TBAC hydrolysis. Finally, we succeeded in fabricating a new membrane for sensing the bitterness of medicines with higher durability and sensitivity by adjusting the proportions of the lipid and plasticizers...|$|E
40|$|Polylactide (PLA) is an {{attractive}} candidate for replacing petrochemical polymers because it is biodegradable and produced from annually renewable resources. Characterized by high tensile strength, unfortunately the brittleness and rigidity of PLA limit its applicability. For {{a great number of}} applications such as packaging, fibers, films, etc., it is of high interest to formulate new grades with improved flexibility and better impact properties. In this objective, a specific PLA grade (L/D isomer ratio of 96 : 4, high molecular weight) was melt-mixed with selected plasticizers: bis(2 -ethylhexyl) adipate (DOA), glyceryl triacetate (GTA), and <b>tributyl</b> <b>O-acetylcitrate</b> (TBAC). Their effect on the molecular, thermal, and mechanical properties of PLA was investigated for content up to 20 wt% plasticizer and the results were correlated with a particular attention to the relationship between property and application. Using the solubility and interaction parameters, a tentative evaluation of the product that could act as the most effective plasticizer for PLA has been performed and the obtained results have been corroborated with the materials physical properties. Excellent mechanical performances were obtained using the plasticizer having the lowest molecular mass (GTA) and the best interaction parameter. In relation to plasticizer amount/nature, the glass transition temperature of PLA (62 -C) is decreased by plasticizing by more than 30 -C, whereas better impact properties and lower stiffness are measured. The optimal formulations targeted to the final applications are clearly characterized by specific end-use properties: improved crystallization rates (PLA-DOA); high elongation at break and tensile strength (PLA-GTA, PLA-TBAC), medium to high impact properties (PLA-DOA, PLA-GTA) compositions.
