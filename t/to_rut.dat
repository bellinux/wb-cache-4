However, the drawbacks of Nicolson pavement include slippery surfaces when wet or icy, and the tendency of the blocks <b>to</b> <b>rut,</b> decay, and heave due to moisture seeping between the blocks.

50|$|To {{those living}} in {{temperate}} latitudes, Père David's deer has similar reproductive physiological mechanisms. These mechanisms aid in the adaptation to a high latitude environment. The reproductive behavior in stags differs from hinds. In stags rutting behavior includes urine sniffing, anogenital sniffing, wallowing, and antler adorning. Mating behavior includes mounting and copulating. Communication behavior includes the spraying of urine and preorbital gland marking. The stags generally begin <b>to</b> <b>rut</b> prior to any signs of female sexual behavior. The reason to this {{is to establish a}} social rank among the stags. For Père David's deer the stag initiates the breeding season with the rutting.In hinds, estrous behavior includes urinating frequently, receptivity, and allowing the stags to mount. Parental behavior involves sniffing the calf, calling, and rubbing the face of the calf. The hind has a typical behavior of being solitary.|$|E

40|$|SummaryGiven {{the role}} that sleep plays in {{modulating}} plasticity, we hypothesized that increasing sleep would restore memory to canonical memory mutants without specifically rescuing the causal molecular lesion. Sleep was increased using three independent strategies: activating the dorsal fan-shaped body, increasing the expression of Fatty acid binding protein (dFabp), or by administering the GABA-A agonist 4, 5, 6, 7 -tetrahydroisoxazolo-[5, 4 -c]pyridine- 3 -ol (THIP). Short-term memory (STM) or long-term memory (LTM) was evaluated in rutabaga (rut) and dunce (dnc) mutants using aversive phototaxic suppression and courtship conditioning. Each of the three independent strategies increased sleep and restored memory <b>to</b> <b>rut</b> and dnc mutants. Importantly, inducing sleep also reverses memory defects in a Drosophila model of Alzheimer’s disease. Together, these data demonstrate that sleep plays a more fundamental role in modulating behavioral plasticity than previously appreciated and suggest that increasing sleep may benefit patients with certain neurological disorders...|$|E
40|$|SummaryMushroom body (MB) -dependent {{olfactory}} {{learning in}} Drosophila provides a powerful model to investigate memory mechanisms. MBs integrate olfactory conditioned stimulus (CS) inputs with neuromodulatory reinforcement (unconditioned stimuli, US) [1, 2], which for aversive learning {{is thought to}} rely on dopaminergic (DA) signaling [3 – 6] to DopR, a D 1 -like dopamine receptor expressed in MBs [7, 8]. A wealth of evidence suggests the conclusion that parallel and independent signaling occurs downstream of DopR within two MB neuron cell types, with each supporting half of memory performance. For instance, expression of the Rutabaga (Rut) adenylyl cyclase in γ neurons is sufficient to restore normal learning <b>to</b> <b>rut</b> mutants [9], whereas expression of Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF 1) in α/β neurons is sufficient to rescue NF 1 mutants [10, 11]. DopR mutations are the only case where memory performance is fully eliminated [7], consistent with the hypothesis that DopR receives the US inputs for both γ and α/β lobe traces. We demonstrate, however, that DopR expression in γ neurons is sufficient to fully support short- and long-term memory. We argue that DA-mediated CS-US association is formed in γ neurons followed by communication between γ and α/β neurons to drive consolidation...|$|E

However, despite the anecdotal imperative to investors to diversify their portfolios, the empirical reality is that diversification rarely takes place as recommended by portfolio theory. In this paper, I demonstrate that psychological influences and well-known cognitive biases from the behavioral decision-making literature could cause investors to make portfolio decisions differently than suggested by normative models. Investors are shown to be modeled more accurately by prospect theory. At the same time, under practical constraints on the environment facing most investors, their heuristics allow them to achieve performance comparable with normatively-allocated portfolios. Thus, advice given to investors should focus on the consistent and careful application of simpler heuristic approaches, rather than on more complex normative portfolio-selection models. †Thanks go to my committee members, Paul Fischbeck, John Miller, and Baruch Fischhoff, for their help with this project and to Carter Butts, Andy Parker, Michele DiPietro, George Loewenstein, and Steven Klepper for many thoughtful discussions.

40|$|Sexual size {{dimorphism}} may evolve as {{a result}} of both natural and sexual selection. In polygynous mammals, the main factor resulting in the evolution of large body size in males is the advantage conferred during competition for mates. In this study, we examined whether sexual selection acts on body size in mature fallow bucks (Dama dama) by examining how the following traits are inter-related: age, body (skeletal) size, body mass, prerut dominance rank, rut dominance rank and mating success. This is the first study to examine how all these factors are together related to the mating success of a large sexually dimorphic and polygynous mammal. We found that male mating success was directly related to body size, but not to body mass. However body mass was related to prerut dominance rank which was in turn strongly related <b>to</b> <b>rut</b> dominance rank, and thus there was an indirect relationship between mating success and body mass. Rut dominance rank was the variable most strongly related to mating success. Mating success among mature males was unrelated to age. We conclude that larger mature fallow bucks have advantages over other males when competing for matings, and sexual selection therefore continues to act on sexual size dimorphism in this species. Heavier fallow bucks also have advantages, but these are mediated through the dominance ranks attained by males before the rut...|$|E

In this paper, a 13 -point-based laser sensor detection technology, commonly accepted in China for rut depth measurements, was used to obtain a database of 85, 000 field transverse profiles having three representative rutting shapes with small, medium and high severity rut levels. Based on the reconstruction of real transverse profiles, the consequences from two different algorithms were compared. Results showed that there is a combined effect of rut depth and profile shape on the rut depth computation accuracy. As expected, the difference between the results obtained with the two computation methods increases with deeper rutting sections: when the distress is above 15  mm (severe level), the average difference between the two computation methods is above 1. 5  mm, normally, the wire line method provides larger results. The computation suggests that the rutting shapes have a minimal influence on the results.

40|$|ABSTRACT Introduction: Helicobacter pylori is a {{bacterium}} found in human epithelial {{cells of the}} gastrointestinal tract. Its infection is related to different diseases, such as chronic gastritis, peptic ulcers, gastric lymphoma and adenocarcinoma. The infection by H. pylori is present {{in more than a}} half of the world population. Objectives: To detect H. pylori and to compare the diagnostic methods of the rapid urease test (RUT) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Materials and methods: The study was conducted between April and July, 2015. For such, three biopsies were collected from each patient. Two were used for PCR and one for RUT. Results: A total of 85 samples were collected from patients undergoing endoscopy, with 56 (65. 88 %) females and 29 (34. 11 %) males. From the total samples subjected <b>to</b> <b>RUT,</b> 15 (17. 64 %) were positive and 70 (82. 35 %), negative. In PCR for detection of gene 16 S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) of H. pylori, 66 (77. 64 %) presented positive results and 19 (22. 35 %), negative results. For the analysis of the presence of UreA gene in all samples, positive results were found in 70 (82. 35 %), and negative in 15 (17. 64 %). According to the results, RUT and the molecular test presented statistical difference. Conclusion: PCR is a useful method in the laboratorial routine to detect the presence of H. pylori in the stomach tissue, due to high sensitivity and specificity, but it requires a more careful analysis and standardization...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} a study was {{conducted}} on the contributions of pavement structural layers <b>to</b> <b>rutting</b> of flexible pavements. Based on extensive literature review and analysis, computer simulations using the finite element method (FEM) were conducted <b>to</b> predict <b>rutting</b> failures. Rutting in hot mix asphalt (HMA) surface mixtures, base courses, and subgrades were simulated. Transverse surface profile characteristics indicative of failure within specific structural layers were determined in the form of simple distortion parameters. Specific criteria were developed for these distortion parameters and compared with full-scale accelerated pavement test (APT) data obtained from several sources. The findings of the initial study suggested that the relative contributions of the layers <b>to</b> <b>rutting</b> in a flexible pavement could be determined from an analysis of its transverse surface profile. ^ A series of finite element analyses were conducted to refine the initial criteria. A matrix of typical pavement sections covering a wide range of structural sections was carefully selected so that the applicability of the refined criteria was maximized. Several issues concerning practical uses of the criteria, such as lateral support (shoulder width and type), wheel wander distribution, and heavy load/high tire pressure, were all investigated and resolved. A PC-based software called Profile Analysis Assistant Program (PAAP) was developed to facilitate FEM analyses and extracting distortion parameters from transverse surface profiles. To ease the use of the criteria an input table called Failure Identification Table (FIT) was developed using the Spreadsheet software. The appropriateness of the refined criteria was validated using trench data collected from various in-service pavements in different States. Good agreement was found between the predicted failure modes (location in the structural layer) and field-observed pavement failures. A method to estimate the contributions of individual pavement layer <b>to</b> total <b>rutting</b> was then developed {{in the form of a}} recommended draft AASHTO practice based on the study findings. ...|$|R

Azoxymethane-treated male F 344 rats were fed either a control diet or a diet containing 10 % wheat bran (WB), 0. 2 % curcumin (CUR), 4 % rutin (RUT) or 0. 04 % benzyl isothiocyanate (BIT) for 8 months. ACF were counted after 7, 15 and 26 weeks. Tumours were scored after 26 weeks and 8 months. We found that the WB and CUR diets inhibited the development of colorectal tumours. In contrast, the RUT and BIT diets rather enhanced (although not statistically significantly) colorectal carcinogenesis. In addition, the various compounds caused different effects on the development of ACF. In most cases the number or size of ACF was not predictive for the ultimate tumour yield. The expression of some tumour-related genes was significantly different in tumours from the control group as compared to tumours from the treated groups. It was concluded that WB and CUR, as opposed <b>to</b> <b>RUT</b> and BIT, protects against colorectal cancer and that ACF are unsuitable as biomarker for colorectal cancer.

40|$|Purpose: Helicobacter pylori {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{prevalent}} infectious agents in the world which causes a variety of gastrointestinal diseases including gastritis, peptic ulcer and gastric carcinoma. The objective of this study was to comparatively evaluate invasive (rapid urease test and polymerase chain reaction) and non-invasive (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) tests in diagnosis of infection with cytotoxigenic H. pylori. Methods: Biopsy specimens and sera were collected from 105 patients with gastric disorders. The presence of H. pylori infection in gastric biopsies was evaluated by RUT and PCR methods using chemotaxis signal transduction protein gene (CSTP), Urea C and HP- 16 srRNA primers. Serum samples were used for the ELISA test. Detection of infection with cag A-positive strains was performed by PCR and cag A-IgG ELISA kit. Results: Patients with at least two out of three positive results were regarded as infected. The sensitivity, specificity, predictive value and accuracy of the three different methods were evaluated. Of the 105 gastric biopsies, H. pylori were positive in 51 patients (48. 57 %). The best sensitivity (92. 16 %) belonged <b>to</b> <b>RUT.</b> The sensitivities of other tests including PCR and ELISA test were 88. 24 % and 90. 20 %, respectively. PCR showed the best specificity (94. 44 %), and the specificities of the other tests including RUT and ELISA test, were 90. 74 % and 61. 11 %, respectively. Furthermore, results of PCR and cag A-IgG ELISA showed high prevalence of cag A-positive strain in the study population. Conclusion: Based on our findings, serum ELISA is a rapid noninvasive test for screening of H. pylori infection in the absence of endoscopy indication. In addition, considering the high prevalence of cytotoxigenic H. pylori strains, cag A is suggested as a promising target for PCR and non- invasive ELISA tests for detection of infection with toxigenic strains...|$|E

Long-term use of chemotherapeutic agents to treat breast cancer patients results in cognitive complications with a negative impact on survivors’ quality of life. The study objective was to evaluate rutin (RUT) for its neuroprotective effect against DOX in human neuroblastoma (IMR 32) cells in vitro and study its potential to ameliorate DOX-induced cognitive dysfunction in Wistar rats. Cell viability assay (3 -[4, 5 dimethyl thiazol- 2 -yl]- 2, 5 -diphenyl tetrazolium bromide), neurite growth assay, detection of apoptosis by (acridine orange/ethidium bromide) staining, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) assay, and flowcytometric analysis were carried out to assess neuroprotective potential against DOX. An in vivo study was conducted for assessing protective effect of RUT against memory deficit associated with DOX-induced chemobrain using object recognition task (ORT). Locomotion was assessed using open field test. Serum biochemistry, acetylcholinesterase, oxidative stress markers in hippocampus, and frontal cortex were assessed. Histopathological analysis of major organ systems was also carried out. Prior exposure <b>to</b> <b>RUT</b> at 100 µM protected IMR 32 cells from DOX (1 µM) neurotoxicity. DOX exposure resulted in increased cellular death, apoptosis, and intracellular ROS generation with inhibition of neurite growth in differentiated IMR 32 cells, which was significantly ameliorated by RUT. Cognitive dysfunction was induced in Wistar rats by administering ten cycles of DOX (2. 5 mg/kg, intraperitoneal, once in 5 days), as we observed significant impairment of episodic memory in ORT. Coadministration with RUT (50 mg/kg, per os) significantly prevented memory deficits in vivo without any confounding influence on locomotor activity. RUT also offered protection against DOX-induced myelosuppression, cardiotoxicity, and nephrotoxicity. In conclusion, RUT may be a possible adjuvant therapeutic intervention to alleviate cognitive and other complications associated with DOX chemotherapy.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The Road {{authority}} {{specifications for}} unbound granular materials (UGMs) do not typically include a direct measure of resistance <b>to</b> <b>rutting</b> caused by repeated loading yet. These specifications can preclude {{the use of}} locally available aggregates or recycled materials that may provide adequate performance (resistance <b>to</b> <b>rutting).</b> As an alternative or compliment to current UGM assessment methods via specifications, a serviceability design method is proposed that utilises results from tests in the repeated load tri-axial (RLT) apparatus. Permanent strain behaviour at a range of stress conditions of four unbound granular materials (UGM) were assessed in the RLT apparatus. Behaviour was categorised into 3 possible ranges A, B or C, where A is a stable response and C is incremental collapse while B is intermediate. From this data, test stresses near or at the boundary of range A and B were determined to define a serviceability limit line stress boundary in p (mean normal stress) – q (principle stress difference) stress space.

The addition of hydrated lime to asphalt has shown to be beneficial with an improvement in the Theological properties of the binder, as well as resistance <b>to</b> permanent deformation (<b>rutting)</b> and fatigue cracking of asphalt concrete mixtures. The addition of hydrated lime produces a filler effect where the result is a stiffening of the asphalt mixture, thus improving the resistance to permanent deformation. The fatigue characteristics of the asphalt mixtures did not worsen from this stiffening effect, but were either improved or similar. The Superpave Performance Grade was not significantly indicative of the filler effects induced by the hydrated lime. However, evaluation of the physical properties, G*/sin 5 and G*sin 5 were indicative of significant filler effects induced by the hydrated lime. Creep properties, stiffness and m-value showed no substantial change with the addition of lime. The use of 10 to 20 % mass concentration of hydrated lime can effectively improve the rutting resistance of the unaged and aged binder with little practical effect on the low temperature and fatigue properties. The filler effects produced through the addition of hydrated lime to the asphalt yielded asphalt mixtures less susceptible <b>to</b> <b>rutting.</b> In most cases, the fatigue life of the asphalt mixtures improved as well. The reference modulus and creep compliance of the asphalt mixtures with lime had shown to have greater fatigue life. In most cases, Stone Matrix Asphalt (SMA) mixtures with lime showed greater resistance <b>to</b> <b>rutting,</b> as well as greater fatigue life. The filler effects from the hydrated lime, as well as the stone-on-stone contact and stiffening from the mastic (two characteristics of SMA mixtures) improved these properties. The addition of hydrated lime to asphalt improved the G*/sin 5 and G*sin 8 of the asphalt binders. The use of these asphalt binders in asphalt concrete mixtures increased the resistance <b>to</b> <b>rutting</b> and fatigue life. It is apparent that a correlation exists between the asphalt binder and mixture test results...|$|R
