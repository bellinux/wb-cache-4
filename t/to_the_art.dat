5|$|By the mid-1980s, the {{flexible}} fiberoptic bronchoscope {{had become an}} indispensable instrument within the pulmonology and anesthesia communities. The digital revolution of the 21st century has brought newer technology <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>art</b> and science of tracheal intubation. Several manufacturers have developed video laryngoscopes which employ digital technology such as the CMOS active pixel sensor (CMOS APS) to generate {{a view of the}} glottis so that the trachea may be intubated.|$|E

5|$|Elements of {{the canvas}} refer to Grünewald's c. 1512–16 Isenheim Altarpiece and Peter Paul Rubens's c. 1612–14 Descent from the Cross. According <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>art</b> critic Hugh Davies, the open mouth of the victim and the {{predator}} leaning over the cross link the painting to Rubens' Descent. The mouth in Rubens' painting is loosely opened, but in Bacon's it is taut. The main figure's legs are folded out of view and the figure's left arm is passive in Rubens' painting, but in the Bacon's painting the chimera's legs and arms are in violent motion, seemingly wildly flailing up and down.|$|E

5|$|Hergé took up {{painting}} as a hobby, producing abstract art works which {{were influenced by}} the styles of Joan Miró and Serge Poliakoff. He showed his work <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>art</b> historian Léo Van Puyvelde, who was the chief conservator of the Musées des Beaux-Arts, who believed that they showed promise but that Hergé's real talent lay with cartoon drawing. Hergé abandoned painting shortly after, having produced 37 paintings in all.|$|E
5|$|In February 2011 the Smithsonian Institution {{announced}} it would be holding an exhibit dedicated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>art</b> of video games. Several games were chosen initially and the public could vote for which games they felt deserved to be displayed via a poll on the exhibit's website. BioShock was considered a front runner to be displayed because of {{its status as a}} game that demonstrated how artistic the medium can be.|$|E
5|$|Preliminary {{designs for}} the Prophets, {{including}} the Hierarchs, were done by artist Shi Kai Wang. According <b>to</b> <b>The</b> <b>Art</b> of Halo, the Prophets were designed to look feeble, yet sinister. Originally, the Prophets appeared to be fused to the special hovering thrones they use for transport; even in the final designs, the Prophets are made {{to be dependent on}} their technology. Special headdresses, stylized differently for each of the Hierarchs, adds personality to the aliens and a regal presence.|$|E

5|$|Sun Tzu's Art of War has {{influenced}} many notable figures. Sima Qian recounted that China's first historical emperor, Qin's Shi Huangdi, considered the book invaluable in ending {{the time of}} the Warring States. In the 20th century, the Chinese Communist leader Mao Zedong partially credited his 1949 victory over Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang <b>to</b> <b>The</b> <b>Art</b> of War. The work strongly influenced Mao's writings about guerrilla warfare, which further influenced communist insurgencies around the world.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} {{has been}} linked both thematically and in its formal construction to Bacon's 1956 work Owls, and to preparatory sketches only brought <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>art</b> market in the late 1990s.

5|$|Williamson's {{work during}} this decade was his most {{prolific}} {{in terms of}} comic book work and has garnered considerable praise for its high quality. He has been noted for his perfectionism and love for the medium. Despite its high reputation, S.C. Ringgenberg felt that Williamson's artwork from this period could at times be uneven and uninspired. Williamson was single during this period and, according <b>to</b> <b>The</b> <b>Art</b> of Al Williamson, had a bohemian and undisciplined lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|With the {{prospect}} of losing its home, the Arts Club opted to sell {{one of the most}} valuable items in its collection to finance the purchase of new land.

To finance the purchase, the Art Institute sold several second tier works from its famous Impressionist collection at Sotheby's in guaranteed lots which was a new concept in the auction world in 1990. While without permanent home, the club continued to meet regularly in space loaned by the Casino, another famous Near North Side club.|$|E
5|$|Chasing Vermeer is a 2004 children's art mystery novel {{written by}} Blue Balliett and {{illustrated}} by Brett Helquist. Set in Hyde Park, Chicago near the University of Chicago, the novel follows two children, Calder Pillay and Petra Andalee. After a famous Johannes Vermeer painting, A Lady In Writing, is stolen on route <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Art</b> Institute of Chicago, Calder and Petra work together to try to recover it. The thief publishes many advertisements in the newspaper, explaining that he will give the painting back if the community can discover which paintings under Vermeer's name were really painted by him. This causes Petra, Calder, {{and the rest of}} Hyde Park to examine art more closely. Themes of art, chance, coincidence, deception, and problem-solving are apparent.|$|E

5|$|Contrasting against Caravaggio's sensual {{baskets of}} fruit, Chardin's plush peaches, or Cézanne's vibrant {{arrangements}} of apples, the mundane Campbell's Soup Cans gave {{the art world}} a chill. Furthermore, the idea of isolating eminently recognizable pop culture items was ridiculous enough <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>art</b> world that both the merits and ethics of the work were perfectly reasonable debate topics {{for those who had}} not even seen the piece. Warhol's pop art {{can be seen as a}} relation to Minimal art in the sense that it attempts to portray objects in their most simple, immediately recognizable form. Pop art eliminates overtones and undertones that would otherwise be associated with representations.|$|E
5|$|For {{his work}} in films, Olivier {{received}} four Academy Awards: an honorary award for Henry V (1947), a Best Actor award and one as producer for Hamlet (1948), and a second honorary award in 1979 to recognise his lifetime of contribution <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>art</b> of film. He was nominated for nine other acting Oscars and one each for production and direction. He also won two British Academy Film Awards out of ten nominations, five Emmy Awards out of nine nominations, and three Golden Globe Awards out of six nominations. He was nominated once for a Tony Award (for best actor, as Archie Rice) but did not win.|$|E
5|$|From the 1930s {{until the}} 1950s, the John Herron Art Institute placed an {{emphasis}} on professionalism and growth in collections. Wilbur Peat, director of the museum from 1929 until 1965, acquired significant portions of the collection. Peat also made connections with benefactors such as Dr. George H. A. Clowes, Booth Tarkington, and Eli Lilly. Caroline Marmon Fesler, president of the Art Association of Indianapolis, gave a number of artworks in the 1940s, including 20th-century modern artworks and Post-Impressionist works by Cézanne, Van Gogh, and Seurat. After years of debate surrounding expansion and relocation of the museum and school, the great grandchildren of Eli Lilly, J.K. Lilly III and Ruth Lilly, donated the family estate, Oldfields, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Art</b> Association of Indianapolis in 1966. One year later {{it was decided that}} the school would become a part of Indiana University's Indianapolis campus in an effort to assist with accreditation. That same year it was confirmed that the museum would relocate to Oldfields, with the new Krannert Pavilion opening to the public in October 1970. In 1969, prior to moving to the new site, the Art Association of Indianapolis officially changed its name to the Indianapolis Museum of Art.|$|E
