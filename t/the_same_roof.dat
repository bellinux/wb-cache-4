5|$|Cave 19 is a cell {{without a}} front wall and a bench {{runs along the}} left wall. The ceiling shows signs of a dressed stone or wooden screen from the right wall {{to the end of}} the bench. To the right is a small cell in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>roof,</b> {{probably}} connected with cave 19. The small cell has a bench along its right wall and the grooved doorway. The cave has two cisterns.|$|E
5|$|The {{lighthouse}} {{was finally}} built in 1862 and first lit officially on 1 May 1862. It {{was designed by}} Alexander Dawson, the New South Wales Government Architect at that time, with a flared base and an external stairwell, an unusual feature for lighthouses in the time and area. The lighthouse keepers' cottages were also unique, built in Victorian Gothic style, with both the principal keeper and the two assistants sharing <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>roof</b> and a combined terrace.|$|E

60|$|I obeyed, passing {{between the}} thick {{curtains}} which she fastened {{in some way}} behind me, and found myself in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>roofed</b> and sculptured room that I have already described. Only now there were no lamps, such light as penetrated it coming from an opening above that I could not see, and falling upon the dais at its head, also on her who sat upon the dais.|$|R
5|$|Built in 2000, {{the main}} Trinity Road Stand {{is the most}} {{recently}} completed at Villa Park and houses the dressing rooms, club offices and director's boxes. The stand is composed of three tiers with a row of executive boxes between {{the second and third}} tiers. Although much larger than the other stands, the stand has roughly <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>roof</b> level as the other three sides. The players' tunnel and the technical area where the managers and substitutes sit during the match {{are in the middle of}} the stand at pitch level. The press and the directors' VIP area are situated in the centre of the middle tier. The upper tiers of the stand extend over Trinity Road, the street that cuts behind the ground. Trinity Road passes through a tunnel formed by the Trinity Road Stand.|$|E
5|$|The terrace {{comprises}} three {{one story}} cottages, a six room cottage for the principal keeper and two three room cottages for the assistants, all sharing <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>roof.</b> Each of the cottages had a kitchen, a storeroom and a privy. The building was constructed {{of the same}} imported sandstone as the lighthouse, dressed outside and plastered inside. The roof was originally made of slate, replaced in 1901 with terracotta, with five chimneys along the ridge and a bay window and gables along the front. A low terrace was built at the rear from random stone. Photographs from the 1950s also show a rear addition with a skillion roof infilling part of the verandah.|$|E

50|$|The name of {{the temple}} was {{inherited}} from a Muslim woman named Khudni who found the Lingam at this location and became a devotee of Lord Shiva. Her mortal remains were buried one yard south beside the Lingam under <b>the</b> <b>same</b> temple <b>roof.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The organisers of Hevy Music Festival {{decided in}} light of [...] "temperamental" [...] weather {{leading up to the}} festival they put roofs over the stages. This {{involved}} the Rock Sound Stage and the Punktastic Stage merge to have alternating bands meaning there is no time clashes between the two stages. They also merged the Punktastic Stage into <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>roofed</b> area with <b>the</b> two stages alternating as the [...] "Main" [...] Stage, while putting the Red Bull Bedroom Jam stage in its own distinct tent. Will Haven dropped out of the festival on Thursday 2 August and were not replaced. Instead all other bands had their sets adjusted to accommodate the space left by the group.|$|R
50|$|Fr. Buela {{founded the}} contemplative {{branch of the}} Institute of the Incarnate Word in December 1988. Ever since, the monks of the Institute have {{dedicated}} themselves to prayer, living in community under <b>the</b> <b>same</b> monastery <b>roof</b> as true brothers and subjecting themselves to a rule and an abbot.|$|R
25|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} there are 248 parts in a human body, and {{each one of these}} parts can render impure by contact, carrying, or being under <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>roof</b> when they have upon them flesh {{sufficient}} that they could heal if still connected to a living person. But if they do not have sufficient flesh upon them, these individual parts can render impure only by contact and carrying but cannot render impure by being under <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>roof</b> (although a mostly intact corpse does).|$|E

25|$|The cathedral {{contains}} two naves, {{one of which}} belonged to the bishop, {{and the other to}} the local parish, side by side under <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>roof,</b> separated by arches. This arrangement was not unique in Provence; it is also found in Aix Cathedral and Apt Cathedral.|$|E

50|$|A square chancel {{measuring}} about 22 ft on {{all sides}} and with a height shorter {{than that of the}} main nave is adjoined {{to the rear of the}} nave and topped with <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>roofing</b> material. <b>The</b> apexes of both roofs feature matching stone crosses. The rear wall of the chancel features a triplet of pointed arch stained glass windows, and the exterior is flanked with two corner buttresses. A small addition to the eastern side of the chancel was originally used as a Sunday School room and is built in a similar fashion as the chancel itself. The chancel was one of the first parts of the building to be completed, being ready for service in early 1853, several months before the nave was completed later that year. Carpeting was added to the chancel in 1866 and electric lighting in the 1930s.|$|R
50|$|A {{mono-pitched roof}} {{can also be}} a smaller {{addition}} to an existing roof, where keeping to <b>the</b> <b>same</b> slope (<b>roof</b> pitch) puts the mono-pitched roof lower than the ceiling height of the main structure. In this case even though the main roof has a flat ceiling, the mono-pitched part will have a sloping, or raked, ceiling line to maximise the ceiling height. The name lean-to roof comes from this form of addition.|$|R
25|$|The nazirite (except for a Samson-like nazirite {{as stated}} above) may not become ritually impure by {{proximity}} {{to a dead}} body. Causes include being under <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>roof</b> as a corpse. However a nazirite can contract other kinds of ritual impurity. A nazirite that finds an unburied corpse is obligated to bury it, even though he will become defiled in the process.|$|E
25|$|Alice Jane Chandler Webster {{was born}} in Fredonia, New York. She was the eldest child of Annie Moffet Webster and Charles Luther Webster. She lived her early {{childhood}} in a strongly matriarchal and activist setting, with her great-grandmother, grandmother and mother all living under <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>roof.</b> Her great-grandmother worked on temperance issues and her grandmother on racial equality and women's suffrage.|$|E
25|$|In {{the visual}} novel their roles are as {{principal}} romancable characters for the protagonist {{while in the}} anime they, along with their maid, Mea, take on {{the roles of the}} protagonist. The three sisters, Ai, Mai and Mii, all have supernatural powers that differ based loosely on their personality type. All three live together under <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>roof</b> of a Western-style mansion with a maid helping take care of their needs.|$|E
50|$|Father Antonio Vicente {{became the}} first vicar of the {{resettlement}} when Sabtang was re-established in 1844 and he began {{the construction of a}} church made of lime and stone together with the attached convent in that same year. Between 1869 and 1876, many constructions took place not only in the church but also in its immediate surroundings. Under Father Rafael Cano, the side altar of Our Lady of the Rosary was created, a guest room was added inside the convent, a school house for children was constructed, and a seawall fronting the seaport was made. In October 1956, the belfry, described as “curvaceous” and “original”, was blown down by a hurricane. A new one was later put in place under Fr. Gumersindo Hernandez in that same year. In 1983 to 1984, the cogon roofing of the church was replaced by galvanized iron sheets by Father Rafael Carpintero, OP. <b>The</b> <b>same</b> <b>roofing</b> modification was applied to the convent the following year. The following year, red brick tiles forming the flooring of the sanctuary was replaced by cement.|$|R
50|$|Another notable {{social housing}} estate in Holbrooks {{is the area}} of Everdon Road. Built after the Second World War, and {{accessed}} from either Beake Avenue or Holbrook Lane, {{this is a more}} spacious well-designed housing estate with mostly three- and four-bedroom houses with large rooms and tall roofs. Also several one-bedroom bungalows with <b>the</b> <b>same</b> tall <b>roof</b> design.Due to the spacious layout of the estate, more bungalows were recently built as 'infill' and in the future more development is likely.|$|R
5|$|Also {{constructed}} were a small fuel store, workshop, paint {{store and}} earth closet near the keeper's cottage, and two fuel stores with earth closet and sink for the assistant cottages. All were constructed in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> form, from unpainted concrete blocked and <b>the</b> <b>same</b> terracotta tile <b>roofs.</b> All still {{remain in the}} complex, pretty much intact.|$|R
25|$|The Juan Ruiz de Alarcón Theater and Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz Forum {{were both}} inaugurated in 1979 as space for {{cultural}} events under <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>roof.</b> They have {{a capacity of}} 430 and 120 spectators respectively. The Forum does not define stage and audience space so that the facility {{can be adapted to}} a number of different arrangements. The stage of the Theatre, with its 12-meter walls, can be disassembled partially or fully.|$|E
25|$|Saint Louis University School of Law {{was founded}} in 1843 and is the oldest law school west of the Mississippi River. The {{students}} attend classes in Scott Hall, which is in downtown St. Louis. The Hall was previously renovated {{and for the first}} time, the Saint Louis University Law Library and Legal Clinics are housed under <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>roof</b> as the School. The current dean for the School of Law is Michael Wolff.|$|E
25|$|Many leading European {{professional}} ballet {{companies that}} survive today were established at new theatres in Europe's capital cities during the mid- to late- 19th century, including the Kiev Ballet, the Hungarian National Ballet, the National Theatre Ballet (Prague) and the Vienna State Ballet (formerly the Vienna State Opera Ballet). These theatres usually combined large opera, drama and ballet companies under <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>roof.</b> Composers, dramatists, and choreographers were then {{able to create}} works that {{took advantage of the}} ability to collaborate among these performance troupes.|$|E
5000|$|The depot {{has been}} {{restored}}, and painted in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> colors, and with <b>the</b> <b>same</b> style metal <b>roof</b> shingles, used in 1910.

[...] The station is located along the Gainesville-Hawthorne Trail State Park.|$|R
50|$|The {{historic}} {{restoration of}} the TWA headquarters building led to the fabrication of a brand new Moonliner II replica begun in March 2006 by the Kansas City office of the Bratton Corporation. The completed replica was installed on September 29 of that year at <b>the</b> <b>same</b> southwest corner <b>roof</b> location as the original.|$|R

25|$|President Woodrow Wilson did {{not oppose}} {{segregation}} practices by autonomous department {{heads of the}} federal Civil Service, according to Brian J. Cook in his work, Democracy And Administration: Woodrow Wilson's Ideas And The Challenges Of Public Management. White and black people would sometimes be required to eat separately, go to separate schools, use separate public toilets, park benches, train, buses, and water fountains, etc. In some locales, in addition to segregated seating, it could be forbidden for stores or restaurants to serve different races under <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>roof.</b>|$|E
25|$|During {{the colonial}} period, a European-style Christianity {{was at first}} {{promoted}} by the authorities. Native Congolese generally attended different churches or services from whites. If they worshiped under <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>roof,</b> the native Congolese sat on benches at the back, while the whites sat in chairs at the front. Towards {{the end of the}} colonial era, more African elements were incorporated into Christianity, including songs and dances which were formerly condemned as pagan. Eventually, even native fables and myths were appropriated and merged into Congolese Christianity, in a similar process to that which occurred with Christianity in Europe.|$|E
25|$|Aurora {{was born}} on February 19, 1888 to Pedro Aragón and Zenaida Molina, {{in the town of}} Baler in Tayabas province. During the Philippine Revolution, her father was imprisoned by the colonial {{authorities}} for being suspected as {{being a member of the}} Katipunan; he would die in captivity. Among her tutors during her youth was her mother's sister, María Dolores Molina, who was the mother of her first cousin and future husband Manuel Luis Quezón. After her father's imprisonment, she was taken in by her aunt María Dolores and uncle Lucio, and she lived for a time under <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>roof</b> as her future spouse. After Manuel's own parents had died, he would stay with the Aragón family whenever he was in Baler.|$|E
5000|$|The {{walls of}} the present {{building}} are of sandstone rubble and ashlar with dressings of <b>the</b> <b>same</b> material <b>the</b> <b>roofs</b> are slate-covered. The interior is light and airy, with no chancel arch and a high canted ceiling with stucco panelling, spanning both nave and chancel. at the west end is a wooden-panelled gallery and underneath it a slim font.|$|R
5000|$|However, the {{introduction}} of eight years of compulsory education in 1997 has seen a sudden decline in the popularity of Imam Hatip schools. In 1999, the reclassification of Imam Hatip schools as [...] "vocationalschools" [...] meant that, although more options had been made available to graduates, attaining places at prestigious university courses became more difficult. By requiring that all eight compulsory years of schooling be spent under <b>the</b> <b>same</b> primary-school <b>roof,</b> middle schools were abolished. Children could not enter vocational schools (one of them the Imam Hatip school) until the ninth grade (rather than the sixth, as before).|$|R
25|$|Inside, {{the lack}} of a chancel arch creates a large single space, {{enhanced}} by the nave and aisles having <b>the</b> <b>same</b> roofline. <b>The</b> <b>roof</b> is timber-framed with king posts, tie-beams and double trusses (in the absence of a chancel arch, these form the only demarcation between the nave and chancel). There is also a smaller timber-framed roof in the separate south chapel.|$|R
