5|$|After an apoplexy, the {{pressure}} inside the sella turcica rises, and surrounding {{structures such as}} the optic nerve and <b>the</b> <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cavernous sinus are compressed. The raised pressure further impairs the blood supply to the pituitary hormone-producing tissue, leading to tissue death due to insufficient blood supply.|$|E
5|$|Lindow Man's {{last meal}} was {{preserved}} {{in his stomach}} and intestines and was analysed in some detail. It was hoped that investigations into <b>the</b> <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stomach would {{shed light on the}} contemporary diet, {{as was the case with}} Grauballe Man and Tollund Man in the 1950s. The analysis of <b>the</b> <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> digestive system of bog bodies had become one of the principal endeavours of investigating such remains. Analysis of the grains present revealed his diet to be mostly of cereals. He probably ate slightly charred bread, although the burning may have had ritual significance rather than being an accident. Some mistletoe pollen was also found in the stomach, indicating that Lindow Man died in March or April.|$|E

40|$|In “How Facts Make Law” (Greenberg 2004), I {{argue that}} non-normative {{contingent}} facts {{are not sufficient}} to determine <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> law. In the present paper, I take up a challenge raised by Enrique Villanueva (2005). He suggests that, to put it very briefly, descriptive facts can be reasons. Therefore, even if <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> law depends on reasons, {{it does not follow}} that law practices cannot themselves determine <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> law. Villanueva proposes a value-neutral criterion – textualism. In other words, he suggests that the descriptive facts about <b>the</b> meaning <b>of</b> legal texts are themselves reasons that determine <b>the</b> contribution <b>of</b> law practices to <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> law. This suggestion depends on too shallow a conception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> requirement <b>of</b> reasons. For <b>the</b> law to be rationally determined, it is not enough that there be some value-neutral criterion that specifies that law practices have certain consequences for <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> law. There have to be reasons that explain why that criterion, as opposed to all others, is the legally correct one – the one that, in the relevant legal system, determines <b>the</b> contribution <b>of</b> law practices to <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> law. Normative facts are the best candidates for such reasons. And, in fact, Villanueva’s textualist criterion derives its appeal from normative facts. Reasons {{play a central role in}} <b>the</b> ontology <b>of</b> law. <b>The</b> determinants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> law, which include law-determining practices such as statutes and judicial decisions, influence <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> law in a systematic way. But their influence on <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> law cannot be brute: there have to be reasons that explain why the determinants have the particular significance that they have. These reasons are part <b>of</b> what makes <b>the</b> determinants have that significance. Hence, the reasons are part <b>of</b> what makes <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> law what it is. Descriptive facts cannot themselves provide the necessary reasons: given any descriptive fact that is a candidate reason, its significance itself depends on reasons – and, unlike normative facts, descriptive facts cannot determine their own significance. Descriptive facts therefore cannot alone determine <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> law...|$|R

40|$|I offer a new {{argument}} against the legal positivist view that non-normative social facts can themselves determine <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> law. I argue that <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> determination relation in law is rational determination: <b>the</b> contribution <b>of</b> law-determining practices to <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> law {{must be based on}} reasons. That is why it must be possible in principle to explain what makes the law have <b>the</b> <b>content</b> that it does. It follows, I argue, that non-normative facts about statutes, judicial decisions, and other practices cannot themselves determine <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> law. A full account must appeal to considerations independent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> practices that determine <b>the</b> relevance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> practices to <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> law.

5|$|A {{document}} that purports to be a subversive document {{is presumed to}} be one until the contrary has been proved, {{and if it is}} proved that a person was carrying or had in his or her possession or under his or her control a subversive document, he or she is deemed to have known <b>the</b> <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> document and their nature. Nevertheless, a person may defend himself or herself by proving that he or she was unaware of the contents and the nature of <b>the</b> <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> document, and that he or she did not have reasonable cause to believe or suspect that the document was subversive. The ISA places a duty on any person, any office-bearer of an association, or any responsible member or agent of an organization who receives a subversive document to deliver it to a police officer without delay. Failure to do so without police authorization, or communicating the contents of such a document to others or publishing them is an offence.|$|E
