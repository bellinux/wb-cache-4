5|$|Phoenix Wright, a newly-hired defense {{attorney}} at the Fey and Co. law firm, agrees to represent {{his best friend}} Larry Butz, who {{has been charged with}} the murder of his girlfriend, Cindy Stone. With the help of his boss and mentor, Mia Fey, he proves that Frank Sahwit, the prosecution's star witness, is the real murderer. Shortly thereafter, Mia is killed in her office, and her younger sister Maya is arrested after the police find her name on a note left by Mia. Phoenix takes her case, facing off against Miles Edgeworth, an equally-talented prosecutor. Phoenix manages to identify Redd White, a professional blackmailer, as the real killer, only to find himself charged with the killing instead. Representing himself, he exposes White in court and gets justice for Mia. His reputation established, Phoenix takes on another case, this time defending Will Powers, the lead actor in a children's TV show, against accusations that he killed his co-star, Jack Hammer. In a bizarre <b>twist,</b> <b>it</b> is revealed that Dee Vasquez, the show's producer, committed the murder in self-defense after Hammer tried to kill her and frame Powers for her death.|$|E

25|$|In a {{somewhat}} ironic <b>twist</b> <b>it</b> is the analogue-based Roland machines that have endured {{over time as}} the Linn sound became somewhat overused and dated {{by the end of}} the decade. The TR-808 and TR-909's beats have since been widely featured in pop music, and can be heard on countless recordings up to the present day. Because of its bass and long decay, the kick drum from the TR-808 has also featured as a bass line in various genres such as hip hop and drum and bass. Since the mid-1980s, the TR-808 and TR-909 have been used on more hit records than any other drum machine, and has thus attained an iconic status within the music industry.|$|E

500|$|Jon Pareles of The New York Times {{considered}} that [...] "despite its platitudinous message, [...] has stark edges and angles". Sputnikmusic's Zachary Powell commented that [...] "'State of the World' keeps the upbeat motion that Rhythm Nation begins, {{but with more}} of a socially conscious <b>twist.</b> <b>It</b> shares with the preceding track a groovy beat and danceability, but takes it to another direction lyrically and shows the caring side of Janet Jackson". Dennis Hunt of Los Angeles Times commented positively saying that the move to social commentary was a rocky decision. However, he felt that [...] "State of the World" [...] was not interesting enough musically to carry the messages.|$|E
500|$|However, other reviewers {{received}} the episode more positively. Zack Handlen gave the episode {{a rating of}} a [...] "B+" [...] in his 2011 review for The A.V. Club. He called the Ferengi [...] "as awful as ever", but otherwise praised the episode. He said that Janssen {{was one of the}} reasons why it worked, with the evolution of Kamala through [...] "The Perfect Mate" [...] showing [...] "a sense of someone coming into their own as a sexually aware, potentially powerful individual." [...] Handlen compared the situation to the [...] "Elaan of Troyius", and found the imprinting of Kamala on Picard an unexpected <b>twist.</b> <b>It</b> was ranked in 47th place out of the top 100 of the entire franchise in Charlie Jane Anders' list for io9, In the Toronto Suns list of the 50 top moments of the franchise, Janssen's appearance as Kamala was placed 13th.|$|E
500|$|Stylistically, {{the album}} has been {{described}} by Allrovi's Jason Lymangrover as ranging [...] "from Frank Sinatra pop to psychedelic garage rock"; while The Boston Globe James Reed has noted the [...] "spare" [...] sound of [...] "Scalinatella" [...] and the [...] "furious and rocking" [...] pace of [...] "Urlo Negro". Although wanting to remain faithful to the original versions of the songs covered, Patton wished to avoid simply mimicking the original recordings, stating [...] "this is a record of covers, and I believe firmly that you have to make them your own. There is a very fine line to tread. You have to treat a song with respect, yet <b>twist</b> <b>it</b> up, fuck it up and somehow make it a part of your own voice". When assembling the cut for [...] "Deep Down", Patton was able {{to get in touch with}} the original vocalist, a woman named Christy, though mutual friend Daniele Luppi. However, she declined to take part in the project.|$|E

500|$|... "Single Ladies" [...] gained {{widespread}} popularity for its catchy {{hook and}} theme of female empowerment. Critics have compared the song to Aretha Franklin's [...] "Respect" [...] and Gloria Gaynor's [...] "I Will Survive", prompted by their lyrics, which all promote female empowerment. The music video achieved fame for its intricate choreography and its deployment of jazz {{hands with a}} wrist <b>twist.</b> <b>It</b> has been credited with starting the [...] "first major dance craze of both the new millennium and the Internet", triggering a number of parodies of the dance choreography. Billy Johnson of Yahoo! Music wrote that the video of [...] "Single Ladies" [...] was the top music-related viral hit of 2009. MTV News' James Montgomery wrote that [...] "it appears like [...] was custom-made for the YouTube generation, which probably explains why making homages became a worldwide phenomenon." [...] The video generated interest in J-Setting, the dance form that choreographer JaQuel Knight highlights in the video, and Beyoncé is credited with bringing the dance style to the mainstream.|$|E
500|$|The {{violence}} {{that was much}} criticized in 1969 remains controversial. Peckinpah noted it was allegoric of the American war in Vietnam, the violence of which was nightly televised to American homes at supper time. He tried showing the gun violence commonplace to the historic western frontier period, rebelling against sanitized, bloodless television Westerns and films glamorizing gunfights and murder: [...] "The point {{of the film is}} to take this façade of movie violence and open it up, get people involved in it so that they are starting to go in the Hollywood television predictable reaction syndrome, and then <b>twist</b> <b>it</b> so that it's not fun anymore, just a wave of sickness in the gut ... it's ugly, brutalizing, and bloody awful; it's not fun and games and cowboys and Indians. It's a terrible, ugly thing, and yet there's a certain response that you get from it, an excitement, because we're all violent people." [...] Peckinpah used violence as a catharsis, believing his audience would be purged of violence by witnessing it explicitly on screen. He later admitted to being mistaken, that the audience came to enjoy rather than be horrified by his films' violence, something that troubled him.|$|E
500|$|Starting {{to appear}} more frequently, Dotty became a {{recurring}} character. Santer told Digital Spy in May 2009 that Dotty's storyline would go [...] "to a very, very dark place!" [...] He {{questioned whether the}} character was born bad or if her father had made her that way, and if she could be more dangerous than Nick. As the storyline between Dot, Dotty and Nick progressed, Nick's true agenda was revealed when he blackmailed his mother into giving him money for custody of Dotty. A BBC source told The Sun, [...] " [...] horrified when Nick tells her Dotty is for sale. He shows no emotion and his evil grin sends shivers down her spine. She always knew Nick would sell his soul {{for the price of}} some pick ’n mix but she had no idea he’d sell his own daughter." [...] In a further plot <b>twist,</b> <b>it</b> was revealed to the audience in 2009, that Dotty was colluding with her father all along. The plot climaxed in June 2009 and marked Altman's departure from the show for the fourth time. Dotty later left on 23 February 2010.|$|E

500|$|Following a {{championship}} win by Matt Serra over Georges St-Pierre at UFC 69, UFC President Dana White announced that Hughes would {{fight for the}} World Welterweight title in November 2007 against Serra. This fight was later changed to December 29, 2007, in Las Vegas, at [...] On November 23, however, Serra sustained a herniated disc in his lower back and informed UFC {{that he would not}} be able to compete for an indeterminate time. As a replacement for the title match, the UFC quickly signed a rubber match between Hughes and St-Pierre that would also be for the Interim UFC Welterweight Championship. Despite his best efforts, Hughes was unable to mount a serious offense on St-Pierre, who easily avoided Hughes' takedown attempts, while taking Hughes down at will and using Hughes' own ground-and-pound style against him. Near the end of the second round, St-Pierre attempted a kimura on Hughes' right arm that he escaped, but in a reversal of their first fight, St-Pierre was able to <b>twist</b> <b>it</b> into a straight armbar with fifteen seconds remaining in the round. Hughes fought the extension, but with his left hand trapped between the mat and St-Pierre's legs, was forced to verbally submit at 4:54 of the second round. In the post-fight interview, Hughes praised St-Pierre as the better fighter: ...|$|E
500|$|Janet Di Lauro of Soap Opera Weekly commended Maria Arena Bell's {{change to}} Cane's backstory, saying: [...] "This story also {{breathes}} {{new life into}} Cane, who was becoming increasingly dull as a whitewashed, pompous do-gooder. Suddenly, he has his edge back." [...] Soap Opera Digest gave the storyline a thumbs up and a thumbs down because, though it was an exciting <b>twist,</b> <b>it</b> happened too closely to the other Chancellor family rewrite undoing the mother and daughter relationship between Jill and Katherine. The magazine later named the storyline the [...] "Most Preposterous Plot Twist" [...] of 2009 because the rewrite [...] "was way {{out of sync with}} Ys usual authentic approach to storytelling". In 2011, Tommy Garrett of Canyon News said that Goddard is [...] "forever second guessing his character when asked about Cane by the media", also stating that, [...] "To keep an edgy Cane, never to make him boring and lifeless. That’s why Cane is forever keeping secrets from his wife Lily and step mom Jill." [...] Garrett added that he was [...] "interested to see what Maria Bell's plan is" [...] to keep the character edgy, and that Goddard's performance is [...] "always dependable, on fire and exciting". In 2013, another writer from Canyon News, LaDale Anderson, commented that it was difficult for Lily to resist attraction to Tyler Michaelson (Redaric Williams), saying that [...] "trouble in paradise is brewing".|$|E
500|$|Doctor 'Doc' Doccerson (instead of Reubens in the PSP version), is infuriated {{that all}} of his inventions failed, but today he 'shall surpass them all' with his latest invention, C.R.U.S.H. He uses a tape {{recorder}} for his scientific narrative on the experiment. With {{the help of his}} best friend and protégé, Danny (a running gag consists of him correcting Doc throughout the game), he enters his mind as his subject to C.R.U.S.H., but after a few tests, Danny is trapped inside C.R.U.S.H., where he can collect his lost marbles (which will unlock new dressing gowns/robe designs) and facing his fears in the form of monsters (i.e. cockroaches, slugs). At one point, Doc tells Danny that C.R.U.S.H. will not let Danny out due to [...] "unresolved feelings." [...] The two question that reasoning as they progress. Towards the end, C.R.U.S.H. interrupts contact between Danny and Doc, overly infatuated with Danny. Danny slowly admits to C.R.U.S.H. that she is simply a machine and compares it to [...] "flirting with a parking meter." [...] C.R.U.S.H., infuriated, sends Danny back to his childhood as a result. When Doc comes back into contact with Danny, Danny lashes out at Doc for building a machine [...] "with the heart of a teenage girl" [...] who [...] "LOLd" [...] at him. Doc, calming Danny down, explains how this [...] "subconscious" [...] is not really his, but old data, and suddenly Danny becomes shocked when he realizes he took the place of someone who underwent treatment with C.R.U.S.H. (being the PSP Danny), but [...] "she knows [...] not the same." [...] C.R.U.S.H. really wanted Danny to clear her head. In the ending, Danny finally escapes and is free out of C.R.U.S.H's mind. He and Doc discuss C.R.U.S.H's future, while Doc says that he'll fix her. In a sudden plot <b>twist,</b> <b>it</b> turns out that they were not in the real world at all, but all the levels throughout the game are outside Doc's lab. C.R.U.S.H. smiles and laughs into the camera, she winks and the screen cuts to black.|$|E

2500|$|Silveira {{opened their}} second match taking Sakuraba's back, which the Japanese wrestler {{answered}} {{by attempting to}} apply a Kimura lock. After freeing his arm, Silveira capitalized on another Kimura attempt by Saku to try to <b>twist</b> <b>it</b> into an armbar from his guard, only for the Japanese to escape to his knees. Silveira then tried his own Kimura, {{but at that moment}} Sakuraba reversed it in the same way and locked the armbar, making the Brazilian submit. Afterwards, Sakuraba famously stated, [...] "In fact, professional wrestling is strong". With the victory Sakuraba remains one of the last UFC tournament champions to date.|$|E
2500|$|In {{yet another}} unusual <b>twist,</b> <b>it</b> was {{reported}} by NBCNews.com in March 2012 that shortly after Clark moved to a hospital, a valuable pastel, Danseuse Faisant des Pointes (Dancer Making Pointes), by Edgar Degas, was taken from her Fifth Avenue apartment. The painting was sold to Peter Findlay Gallery and later acquired in 1993 by H Block co-founder and art collector Henry W. Bloch. The Peter Findlay Gallery indicated that it acquired the piece from a [...] "European gentleman, seemingly from a good family, who visited New York from time to time" [...] and {{who claimed to have}} inherited the work. It was not until 2005 that the FBI made Bloch aware that it was investigating the painting, and in 2007, it told Bloch that the painting had been reported stolen from Clark.|$|E
2500|$|Animal welfare {{groups have}} {{documented}} {{many cases of}} animal cruelty in the training of performing circus animals. The animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) contends that animals in circuses are frequently beaten into submission and that physical abuse {{has always been the}} method for training circus animals. According to PETA, although the US Animal Welfare Act does not permit the use of electric shock prods, whips, hooks, or similar instruments by trainers, these are still used today. According to PETA, during an undercover investigation of Carson & Barnes Circus, video footage was captured showing animal care director Tim Frisco training endangered Asian elephants with electrical shock prods and instructing other trainers to [...] "beat the elephants with a bullhook as hard as they could and to sink the sharp metal bullhook into the animals' flesh and <b>twist</b> <b>it</b> until they screamed in pain." ...|$|E

He plays along, hoping to find Jim's location and free him; in a surprising plot <b>twist,</b> <b>it</b> is revealed that the expected nephew is, in fact, Tom Sawyer. When Huck intercepts the real Tom Sawyer on the road and tells him everything, Tom decides to join Huck's scheme, pretending to be his own younger half-brother, Sid, while Huck continues pretending to be Tom.

2500|$|The two {{worked closely}} {{together}} on many projects while Cruikshank would provide illustrations for other authors, including Dickens, for whom Cruikshank illustrated two works, Sketches by Boz and Oliver <b>Twist.</b> <b>It</b> was Ainsworth who introduced Cruikshank to Dickens, and Cruikshank began providing illustrations for both Oliver Twist and Ainsworth's Jack Sheppard, which ran in serial {{during the same}} time in 1839. Immediately following the serial publications of Oliver Twist and Jack Sheppard, there were unlicensed theatre productions of the works. Of these, Ainsworth and Cruikshank, with Cruikshank {{going so far as to}} advise one of the set designers, was in favour of while Dickens was not. In an 8 October 1839 letter to G. B.

2500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the violence, JFF was tasked to document the rapes. After JFF reported that the violence had been organized, [...] General Wiranto publicly apologized for the army's failure to prevent the violence and acknowledged that elements in the military were involved. [...] In addition to government-mandated JFF, a special rapporteur was established by the United Nations to validate JFF findings and interview some of the victims. Both have officially reported that the sexual abuse on May 1998 did occur. The rapporteur noted that the difficulty of interviewing rape victims and lack of testimonials have been used to discredit the fact-finding effort and in one instance to <b>twist</b> <b>it</b> to portray that the incident was fabricated to raise resentment against Indonesian Muslims. In 2008 National Women Commission working together with the UN rapporteur issued recommendations to the government to adopt violence elimination, victim protection and recovery, gender awareness measures. These measures have been accepted and implemented into policies. However general public still refuses to acknowledge the rapes and legal proceeding against the perpetrators has stalled.|$|E
