40|$|Sawing and {{polishing}} of the ornamental stones always generate {{large amount of}} solid and wet hazardous wastes, which pollute the environment. In Shak Al-Thoaban area, East Cairo, Egypt, huge amounts of these wastes were accumulated, during the last years, as rejects “Solid” and wet “Sahala” wastes, representing {{one of the main}} sources of environmental pollution. The aim of this work is to characterize and evaluate these wastes for recycling in quicklime production. Hence, samples of both wastes were investigated for their chemical and mineral composition applying XRF, XRD, DTA and TGA methods. Free lime content and reactivity (RDIN) of both samples were also determined after calcination for differnt <b>soaking</b> <b>times</b> (0. 25 - 2. 0 hrs) at 1000 ℃. The results were interpreted in relation to composition and microstructure of the fired samples as revealed by TLM and SEM methods. The RDIN reactivity of the resulted lime is changeable along <b>soaking</b> <b>time</b> at 1000 ℃because of the microfabric of its crystallites. The lime of the “Solid” sample is preserving the original limestone microstructure that contributes in its higher RDIN reactivity values at all <b>soaking</b> <b>times.</b> The relatively higher degree of grain growth of lime crystallites in the “Sahala” sample leads to its lower reactivity.

40|$|Master's thesis in Industrial economicsThe {{purpose of}} the thesis was to examine if the {{material}} properties and/or the morphology of a martensitic ferritic stainless steel were altered if exposed to varying <b>soaking</b> <b>times</b> at two distinct hardening temperatures. The background for the thesis was the need to analyze and verify the optimality of the hardening processes currently performed at NOMAC – Norwegian Material Center of Expertise AS. The analyzed steel was hot-forged S 165 M (W. nr. 1. 4418, X 4 CrNiMo 16 - 5 - 1). The two hardening temperatures were 1000 °C and 1030 °C. The <b>soaking</b> <b>times</b> analyzed were 1, 2, 5, 10 and 20 hours, for both temperatures. Both as-quenched and tempered samples were examined. Standardized mechanical testing was performed, and included tensile stress testing, hardness Vickers testing and Charpy-V impact testing. The mechanical properties remained statistically consistent. Neither the as-quenched nor the tempered samples showed any indication that the <b>soaking</b> <b>times</b> directly altered said properties. The two different temperatures produced statistically equivalent results. The majority of the observed differences in properties between as-quenched and tempered samples were as expected. The gathered impact energy values did not differentiate between as-quenched/tempered samples, leading to a debate regarding their validity. The general conclusion is that the mechanical properties are not correlated with longer/shorter <b>soaking</b> <b>times.</b> The material morphology was analyzed using optical light microscopy, and SEM (including EDS and EBSD analysis). The use of different temperatures had little to {{no effect on the}} final microstructure. Morphologically, the material experienced substantial changes when exposed to longer <b>soaking</b> <b>times.</b> Longer <b>soaking</b> <b>times</b> introduced the growth of the average martensitic (i. e. prior austenitic) grain diameters, where the growth exceeded 80 % after a <b>soaking</b> <b>time</b> of 20 hours. The longer <b>soaking</b> <b>times</b> also caused a reduced ferrite fraction for samples hardened at 1000 °C (the fraction of ferrite was 0. 19 in sample soaked for 1 hour, 0. 11 in samples soaked for 20 hours). This caused a subsequent increase in the martensite fraction. The general ferritic grain shapes were also affected with longer <b>soaking</b> <b>times,</b> transforming from lacy/vermicular grain shapes into globular grains. With regards to material properties, several of these changes counteract each other. It is therefore believed that the combination of the martensitic grain growth and the reduction of ferrite content yields approximately constant mechanical properties. How these morphological changes alter the mechanical properties when occurring individually is not examined. The results of the thesis indicate that S 165 M is a remarkably resistant alloy, producing consistent qualities regardless of the <b>soaking</b> <b>time</b> and/or the hardening temperature...|$|R

A review of the BRUVS literature found that most adopted sampling designs from other studies were rarely designed from pilot studies.

For the steels investigated, the final grain size decreases with increasing heating rate and increases with increasing <b>soaking</b> <b>time.</b> The effects of dislocation density, varied by means of non-temper rolling reduction and a temper rolling reduction of 1 % on the Bake-hardening properties were investigated within an aging temperature of 170 ℃ for 20 min...|$|R
40|$|Fish oil was {{extracted}} from the viscera of African Catfish using supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO 2). A Central Composite Design of Response Surface methodology (RSM) was employed to optimize the SC-CO 2 extraction parameters. The oil yield (Y) as response variable was executed against the four independent variables, namely pressure, temperature, flow rate and <b>soaking</b> <b>time.</b> The oil yield varied with the linear, quadratic and interaction of pressure, temperature, flow rate and <b>soaking</b> <b>time.</b> Optimum points were observed within the variables of temperature from 35 °C to 80 °C, pressure from 10 MPa to 40 MPa, flow rate from 1 mL/min to 3 mL/min and <b>soaking</b> <b>time</b> from 1 h to 4 h. However, the extraction parameters {{were found to be}} optimized at temperature 57. 5 °C, pressure 40 MPa, flow rate 2. 0 mL/min and <b>soaking</b> <b>time</b> 2. 5 h. At this optimized condition, the highest oil yields were found to be 67. 0 % (g oil/ 100 g sample on dry basis) in the viscera of catfish which was reasonable to the yields of 78. 0 % extracted using the Soxhlet method...|$|R
40|$|Effect of Ascorbic Acid Concentration and <b>Soaking</b> <b>Time</b> on Water Content And Peroxide Numbers of Copra Oil)   ABSTRACT. Copra oil is {{a product}} {{produced}} from the dried coconut through several stages of drying until the moisture content reaches 5 - 6 %. Copra oil susceptible to oxidation due to containing high fat content. This causes the oil susceptible to rancidity, discoloration and odor. One of the efforts to prevent the oxidation of foods high in fat {{can be done with}} the giving ascorbic acid as an antioxidant. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the ascorbic acid concentration and coconut meat <b>soaking</b> <b>time</b> in the solution as well as to determine the effect of ascorbic acid on the water content and peroxide numbers of copra oil. This study used a Complete Randomized Design (CRD) with 2 factorial and three levels: (1) ascorbic acid concentration (0. 5 %, 1 % and 1. 55 %) and (2) <b>soaking</b> <b>time</b> (10 minutes, 20 minutes and 30 minutes). The results showed that ascorbic acid concentration has significant effect (P≤ 0, 01) on peroxide number.

40|$|This study aims to (1) {{determine}} {{the concentration of}} leaf extract weeds siam against {{the brightness of the}} color, texture and freshness on red pepper, (2) {{determine the}} length of immersion extract of leaves of weeds siam against the brightness of the color, texture and freshness on red pepper, (3) know the siam weed leaf extract concentration and <b>soaking</b> <b>time</b> on levels of vitamin C in red Chili. The method used is an experimental method by using a randomized block design pattern (RAK) factorial consisting of 25 treatment combinations each with four replications. There are two factors studied were the first factor leaf extract concentration weed siam consists of 5 levels: P 0 (control), P 1 (125, 000 ppm extract), P 2 (250, 000 ppm extract), P 3 (375, 000 ppm extract), P 4 (500, 000 ppm extract) and the second factor soaking period consists of 5 levels: L 0 (0 min), L 1 (15 min), L 2 (30 minutes), L 3 (45 minutes) L 4 (60 minutes). Data were analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Least Significant Difference test (BNT 0, 05). The results showed that the concentration of water extract of siam weed leaves no significant effect (P < 0. 05) to the brightness and freshness of red chilli to 24 HSP, but otherwise significantly affect the texture of red Chili with extract concentrations of 125, 000 ppm, 250, 000 ppm and 375, 000 up to 16 ppm HSP. 0 minutes <b>soaking</b> <b>time</b> was highly significant (P < 0. 05) to the brightness and freshness of red chilli to 16 HSP and the texture of red Chili with a <b>soaking</b> <b>time</b> 45 minutes to 20 HSP. The highest concentration of vitamin C contained in the extract concentration of 375, 000 ppm with a <b>soaking</b> <b>time</b> of 60 minutes. The conclusions of this study are siam weed leaf extract and <b>soaking</b> <b>time</b> effect on the brightness of the color red chilli at a concentration of 125, 000 ppm with 30 minutes <b>soaking</b> <b>time</b> while the texture of red Chili peppers at a concentration of 375, 000 ppm with <b>soaking</b> <b>time</b> 0 minutes.
