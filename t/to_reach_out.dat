The elephant has, Paley argues, a short neck because its head is so heavy, but in compensation it has a long trunk, enabling it <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>out.</b> Similarly the spider has no wings to enable it to chase its flying prey, but has a web, and organs adapted to produce it, which compensates for the lack.|$|E
5|$|Following defeat on Honshū, Enomoto Takeaki fled to Hokkaidō {{with the}} {{remnants}} of the navy and his handful of French advisers. Together they organized a government, with the objective of establishing an independent island nation dedicated to the development of Hokkaidō. They formally established the Republic of Ezo on the American model, Japan's only ever republic, and Enomoto was elected as President, with a large majority. The republic tried <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>out</b> to foreign legations present in Hakodate, such as the Americans, French, and Russians, but was not able to garner any international recognition or support. Enomoto offered to confer the territory to the Tokugawa Shogun under Imperial rule, but his proposal was declined by the Imperial Governing Council.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to this, the ACWF {{played an important}} role internationally for the CPC. As a communist country in the Cold War, China had difficulty establishing diplomatic connections. ACWF was able <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>out</b> to women’s movements abroad, and even hosted 23 delegations {{from other parts of the}} world for the Asia Women’s Representative Conference in December 1949. This enabled the PRC to go around the diplomatic blockade and forge connections with other countries. However, soon the Cultural Revolution would begin in China, which forced the ACWF to discontinue many of its policies.|$|E

5|$|The {{developers}} attempted <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>out</b> to new audiences by distancing Lords of Shadow {{from previous}} Castlevania games, but kept some elements intact to not alienate franchise fans. For example, vampires and werewolves are recurring {{enemies in the}} game, but other existing enemies include trolls, giant spiders and goblin-like creatures. The enemies can be defeated for experience points, {{which can be used}} to purchase combos or to augment the player's abilities further. Lords of Shadow has large-scale bosses known as titans. The Combat Cross can be used to grapple onto their bodies and navigate them, and break the runes that animate the titan.|$|E

5|$|The {{injuries}} that had plagued USC {{throughout the season}} continued as All-American tackle Sam Baker left the game because of a hamstring strain and freshman guard Zack Heberer, already substituting for an injured Chilo Rachal, suffered a shoulder bruise. On the defense, linebacker Rey Maualuga suffered a hip injury and safety Kevin Ellison broke his nose. An uncommon number of injuries, especially along the offensive line, depleted reserve players and forced Trojans <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>out</b> to the general student population {{in order to find}} students with previous lineman experience to help on the scout team's offensive line; however, none were officially added to the roster.|$|E
5|$|The {{party was}} {{according}} to political scientist Cas Mudde only very rarely accused of anti-Semitism – and even then, it was strongly condemned {{by the party}} leadership. When Roeland Raes {{cast doubt on the}} scale of the Holocaust in a television interview in 2001 for instance, the party leadership immediately called an emergency meeting, distanced itself from him and forced him to resign. The party also took screening measures against its local candidates to reveal any possible extremist connections, and rather wanted to risk not being able to fill its lists, rather than filling them with extremists. Particularly, the party wanted to distance itself from Holocaust denial, as it actively sought <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>out</b> to Jewish voters in Antwerp.|$|E
5|$|En {{route to}} a weekend getaway, {{surgeons}} Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw) and Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez) {{are involved in a}} vehicular collision, moments after Robbins proposes marriage. Torres suffers severe injuries, which endanger both her life and the life of her unborn child. She and Robbins are taken to Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital, the institute at which they both work. Their colleagues attempt to save Torres, while Robbins and Mark Sloan (Eric Dane), the father of Torres's baby, stand by. Torres's many injuries include neurological trauma. While barely conscious, she hallucinates an uninjured version of herself standing beside her. The hallucinatory Torres begins to sing, and is gradually joined by the doctors treating her. This singing continues throughout the episode, as Torres's projection of herself attempts <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>out</b> to Robbins.|$|E

5|$|In April 1985, Wilkinson {{formed a}} {{campaign}} committee {{in advance of}} the 1987 gubernatorial election. Relatively unknown statewide, Wilkinson was the first candidate to enter the race. The Democratic primary field eventually grew to include two previous Kentucky governors, John Y. Brown, Jr. and Julian Carroll; sitting Lieutenant Governor Steve Beshear, who would later win two terms as governor in 2007 and 2011; and Grady Stumbo, cabinet secretary for Governor Martha Layne Collins. Early in the race, Brown was the clear-cut favorite, while Wilkinson was picked to finish fifth. Wilkinson financed his own campaign and campaign manager Danny Briscoe suggested that he hire a campaign consultant <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>out</b> to the state's large concentration of undecided voters. After a few interviews, Wilkinson hired a then-unknown political consultant named James Carville; Carville later went on to chair Bill Clinton's successful presidential campaign in 1992.|$|E
5|$|Just Be Free is a demo album {{released}} by Warlock Records featuring music recorded by American recording artist Christina Aguilera. After finishing her run on The New Mickey Mouse Club, a then fifteen-year-old Aguilera began recording the album with New Jersey-based producers Roberts Alleca and Michael Brown. The pair gave Aguilera {{the opportunity to}} use a recording studio and presented her with demo music {{with the understanding that}} they could use the material for their own purpose, but also claiming they would not commercially release the recordings. Musically, the album consisted of dance style tracks as well as ballads, and saw Aguilera performing in Spanish language songs. The record was conceived to showcase Aguilera's vocals in an effort <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>out</b> to record labels, a venture which actually backfired after the recordings were not very well received among critics. Six years after the completion of the album and Aguilera had achieved mainstream success, Brown and Allecca released the record and Just Be Free has sold over 128,000 copies in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Not {{knowing that}} Henry VIII had already {{secretly}} married the pregnant Anne Boleyn, Clement VII decided <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>out</b> to the monarch by appointing Thomas Cranmer, an outspoken proponent of Henry VIII's annulment, as archbishop of Canterbury. A threatened excommunication was handed down when Cranmer pronounced Henry VIII's marriage null and void; Henry VIII responded by telling Campeggio's vicar general for Salisbury {{to stop all}} revenues from his bishopric until further notice. Henry VIII then claimed the authority to act on behalf of Campeggio in making various ecclesiastical appointments. The fifth session of the Reformation Parliament deprived Campeggio and Girolamo Ghinucci of their English sees (unless they swore loyalty to the king). Unaware of this statute, two days later on 23 March 1534 Campeggio entered Consistory for the final ruling against annulment.|$|E

5|$|Capcom's design {{philosophy}} for Marvel vs. Capcom 3 was {{to maximize}} gameplay depth and minimize complexity. According to Niitsuma, the development team sought {{to create a}} game that would reach out to longtime fans of the series, while simultaneously expanding their user base to those familiar with the characters, but perhaps not with fighting games in general. The urge <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>out</b> to new players also stemmed from Marvel's recent success in the Hollywood film industry. Capcom's global head of production, Keiji Inafune, expressed interest in appealing to a worldwide audience. These ideas drove the decision to retool the fighting system, which was criticized in past iterations for being too complicated for casual players. These changes include {{the implementation of the}} three-button attack system from Tatsunoko vs. Capcom and the addition of Simple Mode. Unlike previous titles in the series, Capcom had no plans for an arcade release, and focused only on console versions for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. When asked if Capcom was planning to release the game on other consoles, Niitsuma did not dismiss the possibility for a Nintendo Wii version; however, this ultimately did not come to fruition.|$|E
5|$|The Southeastern Federation of Colored Women’s Clubs (eventually renamed as the Southeastern Association of Colored Women’s Clubs) elected Bethune as {{president}} after its first conference in 1920 at the Tuskegee Institute. They intended <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>out</b> to Southern Women (specifically white women) for support and unity in gaining rights for black women. The women met in Memphis, Tennessee to discuss interracial problems. In many respects, {{all of the}} women agreed about what needed to be changed, until they came to the topic of suffrage. The white women at the conference tried to strike down a resolution on black suffrage. The SACWC responded by issuing a pamphlet entitled Southern Negro Women and Race Co-Operation; it delineated their demands regarding conditions in domestic service, child welfare, conditions of travel, education, lynching, the public press, and voting rights. The group went on to help register black women to vote after they were granted suffrage a few months later after passage of the constitutional amendment. Within the state, however, and in other southern states, black men and women were largely disenfranchised by discriminatory application of literacy and comprehension tests, as well as requirements to pay poll taxes, lengthy residency requirements, and the need to keep and display records.|$|E
