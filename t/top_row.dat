5|$|The cursive {{form of the}} Deseret {{alphabet}} {{was mainly}} used by two people: George D. Watt, and James Henry Martineau. Watt, a stenographer, recorded several bishops meetings and wrote other personal documents in this cursive style. A chart of the cursive form appears below. The blue glyphs represent how to write each character, while the <b>top</b> <b>row</b> of printed glyphs shows the corresponding Unicode reference glyph.|$|E
5|$|In the Case 1 diagram, B1 cells show {{canonical}} values, {{which are}} color-coded {{to show their}} row-wise distribution in B2 triplets. Colors reflect distribution but not location or values. For this case: the B2 <b>top</b> <b>row</b> triplet (r21) has 1 value from B1 middle triplet, the other colorings can now be deduced. E.g. the B2 bottom row triplet (r23) coloring is forced by r21: the other 2 B1 middle values must go to bottom, etc. Fill {{in the number of}} B2 options for each color, 3..1, beginning top left. The B3 color-coding is omitted since the B3 choices are row-wise determined by B1, B2. B3 always contributes 3! permutations per row triplet, or 63 for the block.|$|E

5|$|The {{permutations}} of B1 are {{the number}} of ways to relabel the 9 digits, 9! = 362880. Counting the permutations for B2 is more complicated, because the choices for B2 depend on the values in B1. (This is a visual representation of the expression given above.) The conditional calculation needs a branch (sub-calculation) for each alternative. Fortunately, there are just 4 cases for the top B2 triplet (r21): it contains either 0, 1, 2, or 3 of the digits from the B1 middle row triplet(r12). Once this B2 <b>top</b> <b>row</b> choice is made, {{the rest of the}} B2 combinations are fixed. The Band1 row triplet labels are shown on the right.|$|E
5|$|The player {{does not}} receive any {{explicit}} guidance {{on how to}} play and is left to decipher the game's objectives through trial and error. Sabre Wulf graphics fill the screen with a minimal user interface consisting of the current game score, number of lives left and a high score meter on the <b>top</b> <b>row.</b> Sabreman can eat orchid power-ups, which bloom {{for only a few}} seconds, to turn the colour of the orchid and receive a temporary character effect. Some effects empower (e.g. invulnerability, increased speed) while others impair (e.g. reversing the player's controls). Sabreman can also collect treasure and extra lives scattered throughout the maze. The Spectrum and Commodore 64 releases include a two-player mode in which players take turns controlling their own Sabreman.|$|E
25|$|QWERTY is {{the most}} used modern-day {{keyboard}} layout on English-language computer and typewriter keyboards. It {{takes its name from}} the first six characters seen in the far left of the keyboard's <b>top</b> <b>row</b> of letters. The QWERTY design was invented and patented by Christopher Sholes in 1874.|$|E

25|$|For example, the <b>top</b> <b>row</b> {{would first}} trace lead I, then switch to lead aVR, then switch to V1, and then switch to V4 and so {{none of these}} four tracings of the leads are from {{the same time period}} as they are traced in {{sequence}} through time.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{position}} is centered above ribbons or medals {{with the lower}} edge of the device 1/4inch above the <b>top</b> <b>row</b> of ribbons or medals. When no ribbons or medals are worn, it is centered above the left pocket with the lower edge of the device 1/4inch above {{the top of the}} pocket.|$|E
25|$|Note {{that the}} <b>top</b> <b>row</b> is the {{identity}} and the two 3-cycles, and are orientation-preserving, forming a subgroup in PSL(2, Z), while the bottom row is the three 2-cycles, and are in PGL(2, Z) and PSL(2, Z), but not in PSL(2, Z), hence realized either as matrices with determinant −1 and integer coefficients, or as matrices with determinant 1 and Gaussian integer coefficients.|$|E

Malvern consistently sends rowers to the <b>top</b> <b>rowing</b> schools like Yale University, Princeton University, University of California Berkeley, Georgetown University, University of Pennsylvania, Cornell University, Columbia University, and amongst others.|$|R
50|$|The last {{races of}} the Regatta are {{generally}} the most prestigious: Championship 4s, and Championship 8s (both men and women). Championship sculling events (1x/single and 2x/double) race on Saturday afternoon. The Championship events usually include U.S. National Team athletes, {{as well as}} national team athletes from other <b>top</b> <b>rowing</b> nations.|$|R
25|$|Using the Hebrew {{keyboard}} layout in Mac OS X, the typist can enter niqqud by pressing the Option key {{together with a}} number on the <b>top</b> <b>row</b> of the keyboard. Other combinations such as sofit and hataf can also be entered by pressing either the Shift key and a number, or by pressing the Shift key, Option key, and a number at the same time.|$|E
25|$|Each cell in {{the above}} table shows a sign (upper left), its Dunand code number (lower left), its {{frequency}} (lower right), and indicates (upper right) whether it was used on tablets (T), spatulas (S), or monuments (M). Signs in different cells may actually be writing variants of a single sign; for example, in the <b>top</b> <b>row</b> the signs H6, G17, and E12 are probably the same sign.|$|E
25|$|Because contractions that occupy {{only the}} lower half of the braille cell mostly double as basic {{punctuation}} marks, legibility requires that, with few exceptions, they may not come in contact with actual punctuation marks; if they would, they should instead be spelled out. That is, any cell which follows without an intervening space should contain a dot in its <b>top</b> <b>row.</b> Most of the difficulties of when to use contractions are due to this complication.|$|E

25|$|The scenes on {{the front}} are: in the <b>top</b> <b>row,</b> Sacrifice of Isaac, Judgement or Arrest of Peter, Enthroned Christ with Peter and Paul (Traditio Legis), and a double scene of the Trial of Jesus before Pontius Pilate, who in the last niche is about to wash his hands. In the bottom row: Job on the dunghill, Adam and Eve, Christ's entry into Jerusalem, Daniel in the lion's den (heads restored), Arrest or leading to {{execution}} of Paul.|$|E
25|$|The Workman layout {{employs a}} {{hypothesis}} about the preferential movement of each finger rather than categorically considering the lowest letter row to be least accessible. Specifically, {{the index finger}} prefers to curl inwards rather than stretch outwards. So for the index finger, the position of second preference goes to the bottom row rather than the <b>top</b> <b>row.</b> Contrarily, the middle and ring fingers are relatively long and prefer to stretch out rather than curl in. Based on this, weighting is allotted to each key specifically rather than each row generically.|$|E
25|$|This {{relationship}} {{means that}} certain key features {{can be observed}} in both drum membrane modes and atomic orbitals. For example, in all of the modes analogous to sorbitals (the <b>top</b> <b>row</b> in the animated illustration below), {{it can be seen that}} the very center of the drum membrane vibrates most strongly, corresponding to the antinode in all sorbitals in an atom. This antinode means the electron is most likely to be at the physical position of the nucleus (which it passes straight through without scattering or striking it), since it is moving (on average) most rapidly at that point, giving it maximal momentum.|$|E
50|$|The Bosphorus, Dolmabahçe Palace, Dolmabahçe Clock Tower, Dolmabahçe Mosque, and Maiden's Tower are all {{viewable}} {{from the}} <b>top</b> <b>rows</b> of the Yeni Açık stand of the stadium, {{which makes it}} the only stadium in the world from which a football fan can view two continents, Europe and Asia, which are separated by the Bosphorus strait.|$|R

25|$|Negative-feedback {{amplifiers}} of {{any type}} can be implemented using combinations of two-port networks. There are four types of two-port network, {{and the type of}} amplifier desired dictates the choice of two-ports and the selection of one of the four different connection topologies shown in the diagram. These connections are usually referred to as series or shunt (parallel) connections. In the diagram, the left column shows shunt inputs; the right column shows series inputs. The <b>top</b> <b>row</b> shows series outputs; the bottom row shows shunt outputs. The various combinations of connections and two-ports are listed in the table below.|$|E
25|$|Memorial Stadium {{was funded}} from public contributions, as a {{memorial}} to Californians {{who lost their lives}} in World War I (1917–18). The chair of the architectural committee was John Galen Howard, the university's chief architect, and his influence is evident in the stadium's neoclassical motif. In addition to its unique architecture, the stadium's position {{at the foot of the}} Berkeley hills provides <b>top</b> <b>row</b> spectators with panoramic views of San Francisco Bay and west side viewers with views of the Berkeley Hills and Strawberry Canyon. This has earned it a reputation as one of the most scenic venues in college football.|$|E
25|$|Service stars may be worn {{above the}} pocket or <b>top</b> <b>row</b> of square knots. These are star shaped pins with an {{enameled}} number representing tenure in each Scouting division. Circular plastic backings represent each membership division: gold {{is used for}} Cub Scouting, green is used for Boy Scouting, brown used is for Varsity Scouting, red is used for Venturing and blue indicates adult service. Scouts and leaders with tenure as Tiger Cubs prior to 2000 may wear a service star with an orange backing. Those who served in Exploring prior to 1998 may wear a service star with red backing.|$|E
2500|$|Eton's best-known holiday {{takes place}} on the {{so-called}} [...] "Fourth of June", {{a celebration of the}} birthday of King George III, Eton's greatest patron.
