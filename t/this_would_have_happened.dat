25|$|Had the 1984 ALCS {{between the}} Detroit Tigers and Kansas City Royals gone the full five games (the {{last year that}} the League Championship Series was a best-of-five series), Game 5 on Sunday October 7, {{would have been a}} 1 p.m. ET time start instead of being in prime time. <b>This</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> because one of the presidential debates between Ronald Reagan and Walter Mondale was {{scheduled}} for that night.

Most {{local authorities}} provide free advice on energy conservation and some also provide home visits, often targeting those in social housing and the fuel poor. Some also demand minimum levels of energy efficiency in newly constructed buildings. It was expected that the Act would result in a 30% cut in energy usage between 1996 and 2010. An overall cumulative improvement of 14.7% was reported to DEFRA for the year ending March 2004, but a large part of <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> without HECA.|$|E

25|$|Archaeological dissent {{from this}} view {{began with the}} work of Carlo Maria Rosini in 1797, to be {{followed}} by a succession of archaeologists putting forward evidence to the contrary, though mainstream scholarly opinion has long been in favour of August 24. Discussion on the subject has increased somewhat in recent years. Some of the archaeological evidence from Pompeii does suggest that the town may likely have been buried about two or three months later. For example, people interred in the ashes appear to be wearing warmer clothing than the light summer clothes that would be expected in August. The fresh fruit, olives, and vegetables in the shops are typical of October, and conversely the summer fruit that would have been typical of August was already being sold in dried, or conserved form. Wine fermenting jars had been sealed over, and <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> around the end of October. The coins found in the purse of a woman buried in the ash include a commemorative coin that should have been minted at the end of September.|$|E
25|$|Ted Dexter was {{restored}} to the captaincy {{but it is not}} known if <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> anyway or if it was because Colin Cowdrey was unfit and could not play. Whichever, Dexter now held the England captaincy {{for the next two years}} until the end of the 1964 season. England having won the series, the selectors decided to make changes to help them decide who should go on the winter tour. Geoff Pullar, fit again, was recalled and his opening partner was the third tour captaincy candidate David Sheppard, who had recently revived his cricket career at Sussex. They replaced Cowdrey and Stewart. Tony Lock was brought back in place of Allen and all-rounder Barry Knight came in as an extra bowler, replacing the out-of-form Kenny Barrington. Pakistan's dire injury troubles necessitated changes in their lineup. They had flown their old master bowler Fazal Mahmood out as a reinforcement. Imtiaz was fit again, Intikhab was recalled and Shahid Mahmood was introduced, making his Test debut as opening batsman. They replaced Mahmood, Farooq, Butt and Akhtar.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after the}} Yankees {{returned}} to New York, Stengel was {{informed by the}} team owners {{that he would not}} be given a new contract. His request, that the termination be announced at a press conference, was granted and on October 18, 1960, Topping and Stengel appeared before the microphones. After Topping evaded questions from the press about whether Stengel had been fired, Stengel took the microphone, and when asked [...] if he had been fired, stated, [...] "Quit, fired, whatever you please, I don't care". Topping stated that Stengel was being terminated because of his age, 70, and alleged that <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> even had the Yankees won the World Series.|$|E

50|$|Cleopatra is {{kidnapped by}} Ptolemee’s ruffians and he intends {{force her to}} marry to another man. During Cleopatra's captivity, Ptolemee tries to break her {{allegiance}} to Alexander, but is unsuccessful. Alexander rushes off to war, while Jonathan stays behind, fearing the worst and doubting the power of Alexander's Syrian gods. Jonathan's intuition is confirmed when a messenger delivers the news that although they won three battles, Alexander and Ptolemy have been killed. Cleopatra commends herself to the goddess, Isis, and retires to ‘some peaceful shore’.

500|$|Attention also {{focused on}} Jaguar's {{improved}} pace during the event. Prior to the race, {{the team had}} been criticised by the media {{for their ability to}} perform well in the series with some publications criticising their move of signing Evans and Carroll to drive their cars. Evans said his improved performance encouraged everyone working for the team and it gave Jaguar more confidence: [...] "If you look at the bigger picture, I’ve got to be satisfied with today. Qualifying was great, to be honest, I topped the group. If you ask me or the whole team if <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> after Marrakesh, we would have taken it with both hands." [...] Carroll hoped he would have a strong performance in the event and be faster than he could be but it was an issue that could be improved on. Jaguar team principal James Barclay stated the improvement was [...] "a little bit of a positive surprise" [...] but was unsure if Carroll's problem {{at the start of the}} race was caused by driver error or an electrical issue but admitted his team had to improve their understanding of full course yellow in future races.|$|E

[...] She described the relationship as [...] "a really wonderful friendship" [...] where they would dance and [...] "talk on the phone all the time." [...] She recalled that he found it funny that she could drive at 12 and he couldn't. And that one time they had a [...] "jam session" [...] at her house where he played the drums and her brother played guitar. She said the relationship ended when she was 12, after {{he asked her to}} go to the premiere of The Wiz with him, but her agent disapproved, [...] "maybe because they thought he wasn't a big enough star yet", and she did what she was told because she was a child. [...] While she claimed they never spoke after that, they were actually shown to be together a number of times after <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened.</b>|$|E

2500|$|As in education, the UMNO government's unspoken {{agenda in}} the field of {{economic}} development aimed to shift economic power away from the Chinese and towards the Malays. The two Malayan Plans and the First Malaysian Plan (1966–1970) directed resources heavily into developments which would benefit the rural Malay community, such as village schools, rural roads, clinics, and irrigation projects. Several agencies were set up to enable Malay smallholders to upgrade their production and to increase their incomes. The Federal Land Development Authority (FELDA) helped many Malays to buy farms or to upgrade ones they already owned. The state also provided a range of incentives and low-interest loans to help Malays start businesses, and government tendering systematically favoured Malay companies, leading many Chinese-owned businesses to [...] "Malayanise" [...] their management. All this certainly tended to reduce to gap between Chinese and Malay standards of living, although some argued that <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> anyway as Malaysia's trade and general prosperity increased.|$|E
2500|$|A cookery {{book from}} {{northern}} Europe may have originated in Provence. Known from its incipit as Libellus de arte coquinaria, {{it is the}} Codex K version of the Harpestraeng Cookbook, {{which is part of}} a collection of medical papers written by, or belonging to, Dr. Henrik Harpestraeng. [...] It is currently housed in the Royal Library of Copenhagen (Ny samling Nr. 66, 8 vo.). Food historian Dr. Rudolf Grewe proposed a NW Mediterranean origin for this book based on the recipes and their ingredients, such as saffron. [...] Since Harpestraeng studied medicine in Provence, probably at Montpellier, he may have obtained the book during that time. Harpestraeng may have brought the book to Denmark, where he was the physician to King Valdemar II. Codex K {{is believed to have been}} copied into Danish from an earlier Low German original, or copy. <b>This</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> before 1244, the year Harpestraeng died. If so, Libellus de arte coquinaria is the earliest Western European cookery book, since Apicius' De re coquinaria.|$|E
2500|$|So I grew up (in Ottawa), in this capital city. My parents used to {{work for}} the government, and I went to {{elementary}} school, high school, and the university in the city. And there was a place on Sussex Drive (Sussex Drive is where the Prime Minister's house is, right below Parliament Hill), and there was a little club there called Le Hibou, which in French means 'the owl.' And it was run by a gentleman named Harvey Glatt, and he brought every, and I mean every blues star that you or I would ever have wanted to have seen through Ottawa in the late 50s, well I guess more late 60s sort of, in around the Newport jazz rediscovery. I was going to Le Hibou and hearing James Cotton, Otis Spann, Pinetop Perkins, and Muddy Waters. I actually jammed behind Muddy Waters. S. P. Leary left the drum kit one night, and Muddy said 'anybody out there play drums? I don't have a drummer.' And I walked on stage and we started, I don't know, Little Red Rooster, something. He said 'keep that beat going, you make Muddy feel good.' And I heard Howlin' Wolf (Chester Burnett). Many, many times I saw Howlin' Wolf. And of course Buddy Guy, Buddy Guy and Junior Wells, Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee. So I was exposed to all of these players, playing there as part of this scene to service the academic community in Ottawa, a very well-educated community. Had I lived in a different town I don't think that <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened,</b> because it was just the confluence of educated government workers, and then also all the colleges in the area, Ottawa University, Carleton, and all the schools—these people were interested in blues culture.|$|E

2500|$|It {{is likely}} {{that he was not}} Merneptah's {{intended}} heir. Some scholars such as Kenneth Kitchen and Jürgen von Beckerath believe that Amenmesse usurped the throne from Seti-Merneptah, Merneptah's son and crown prince who should have been next in line to the royal succession. It is unclear how <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened.</b> Kitchen has written that Amenmesse may have taken advantage of a momentary weakness of Seti-Merneptah or seized power while the crown prince was away in Asia. Seti-Merneptah was most likely the same man as king Seti II, whose reign was traditionally thought to have followed upon Amenmesse's reign. The cartouches of Seti II's tomb in Upper Egypt were deliberately erased and then repainted, suggesting that Seti's rule in Upper Egypt was temporarily interrupted by agents of his half-brother. Confusion generally clouds Amenmesse's reign and location within the Egyptian 19th Dynasty. However, an increasing number of Egyptologists today such as Rolf Krauss and Aidan Dodson maintain that Seti II was in fact the immediate successor of Merneptah [...] "without any intervening rule by Amenmesse." [...] Under this scenario, Amenmesse did not succeed Merneptah on the throne of Egypt and was rather a rival king who usurped power sometime during Years 2 to 4 of Seti II's reign in Upper Egypt and Nubia where his authority is monumentally attested. Amenmesse was documented in power at Thebes during his third and fourth year (and perhaps earlier in Nubia) where Seti II's Year 3 and Year 4 are noticeably unaccounted for. The treatment of Amenmesse as a rival king also best explains the pattern of destruction to Seti II's tomb which was initially ransacked and later restored again by Seti II's officials. This implies that the respective reigns of Amenmesse and Seti II were parallel to one another; Seti II must have initially controlled Thebes in his first and second years during which time his tomb was excavated and partly decorated. Then Seti was ousted from power in Upper Egypt by Amenmesse whose agents desecrated Seti II's tomb. Seti would finally defeat his rival Amenmesse and return to Thebes in triumph whereupon he ordered the restoration of his damaged tomb.|$|E

By this fall of cloth, or, what is the same thing, this rise of linen, the demand of Germany for cloth will increase, and the demand of England for linen will diminish, till the rate of interchange has so adjusted itself that the cloth and the linen will exactly pay for one another; and, when once this point is attained, values will remain without further alteration.” ...|$|E
