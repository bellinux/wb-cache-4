50|$|Engine {{timing was}} {{controlled}} by the all-steel, silent Morse <b>timing</b> <b>chain</b> (some early production engines had double-row roller timing sets), which was located beneath the aluminum timing cover {{at the front of}} the engine block. The <b>timing</b> <b>chain</b> <b>sprockets,</b> one each for the camshaft and crankshaft, were all-steel; for the last few years the LA engine came with nylon teeth on the sprockets. At the rear of the camshaft was cut a set of helical gear teeth, these being used to spin the distributor. Mounted to the front of the timing cover was a new-design counter-clockwise-rotation water pump, with much improved flow. Externally, the accessory drive belt was changed to a serpentine system; coupled with an automatic belt tensioner this increased belt life, reduced maintenance and contributed to lower noise and vibration levels.|$|R
50|$|The Lancia Flavia was {{developed}} by Professor Antonio Fessia in the late 1950s, and introduced {{for sale in the}} UK in 1961. Initially available only as a four-door saloon, it featured a 1.5 L aluminium boxer engine, Dunlop disc brakes on all four wheels, front-wheel drive and front suspension by unequal-length wishbones. This model was soon joined by a two-door coupé, designed by Pininfarina on a shortened platform. Vignale built 1,601 two-door convertibles, while Zagato designed an outlandish-looking light weight two-door sport version. The sport version has twin carburetors for extra power (just over 100 hp/75 kW); however, this version of the engine was notoriously difficult to keep in tune. Even the single-carburettor engine suffered from the problem of <b>timing</b> <b>chain</b> stretch. <b>Sprockets</b> with vernier adjusters were fitted to allow for chain wear, and the cam timing was supposed to be checked every 6000 miles. Early cars also suffered from corrosion of the cylinder heads caused by using copper gaskets on aluminium heads; nevertheless, the car was quite lively for its day, considering the cubic capacity. When leaving the factory Flavias originally fitted either Pirelli Cinturato 165HR14 tyres (CA67) or Pirelli Cinturato 155HR15 tyres (CA67).|$|R

The <b>timing</b> <b>chain</b> rode on one pivoting chain guide resting on the ratchet tensioner and one fixed guide attached to the engine block and cylinder head. The 1991 to 1998 DOHC engine had an upper <b>timing</b> <b>chain</b> guide in between the camshaft <b>sprockets.</b> The <b>timing</b> <b>chain</b> was lubricated via cast-off {{from the top of}} the cylinder head and one 'squirter' on the oil pump housing.

40|$|An {{innovative}} {{integrated approach}} to the testing and comparison of motorcycle drive chain lubricants is presented. This is a novel way of testing the lubrication by using loaded operating <b>chains</b> and <b>sprockets.</b> A test rig {{has been designed to}} operate <b>chains</b> and <b>sprockets</b> in a clean environment and allow direct comparison between different lubricants. The advantage of this method over previous techniques is that it allows the differentiation of lubricants in a more controlled operating environment and evaluates the overall lubricant performance as opposed to individual properties. The lubricants tested were a wax spray, PTFE spray and drip fed light oil. The test rig allowed measurement of the power saved by the lubricant in running the <b>chains</b> and <b>sprockets.</b> <b>Chain</b> length and component masses were also taken before and after running the <b>chains</b> and <b>sprockets</b> under load on the test rig. The results clearly show that any lubricant is preferable to none. The drip fed oil provided the greatest power saving and wear protection between the chain rollers and pins and the spray lubricants provided the highest level of protection between rollers and sprockets...|$|R

50|$|A <b>timing</b> <b>chain,</b> {{also called}} a sync chain, {{is used on}} tandem bicycles, to {{synchronize}} crank movement between the captain (front rider) and stoker (rear rider). As with auto engines, proper tension of the <b>timing</b> <b>chain</b> is necessary to prevent premature wear of the drivetrain components. Tension is adjusted {{by means of an}} eccentric bottom bracket.|$|R
50|$|To {{maintain}} the necessary {{tension on the}} <b>timing</b> <b>chain,</b> many tandems use an eccentric that {{is placed in the}} front rider's bottom bracket shell. An alternate solution is to implement a pulley, or idler, {{on the bottom of the}} <b>timing</b> <b>chain</b> to take up slack. Idlers add friction and a potential point of failure to the drive train.|$|R

5000|$|In October 1914 Motor Cycle {{magazine}} {{reported on}} a Carden Monocar they had on trial. This vehicle (registration MXY1) was powered by an air-cooled 5HP V-twin JAP engine, and had only a single gear, though gears were available on 'other models'. The engine was mounted behind the rear axle and drove it via chain, there being no differential.

50|$|Other {{changes to}} the engine were related to ease of {{manufacture}} and improved reliability. This led to elimination of coolant flowing through the intake manifold to prevent unnecessary heat transfer. To perform this change, {{the front of the}} engine block was extended to include provisions for the coolant to flow through a cross over in the block. This extension also acted as an integrated <b>timing</b> <b>chain</b> housing. The <b>timing</b> <b>chain</b> housing was covered with flat steel that was easier to seal than the typical large <b>timing</b> <b>chain</b> cover used on other Ford V8s. These changes resulted in a bigger and heavier engine block than the Windsor V8s. The 351 Cleveland was not an all-new design, but a development of the 351W into a higher-performance variation.|$|R
