40|$|Although C. G. Jung’s {{interest}} in normality wavered throughout his career, {{it was one}} of the areas he identified in later life as worthy of further research. He began his career using a definition of normality which would have been the <b>target</b> <b>of</b> <b>Foucault’s</b> criticism, had Foucault chosen to review Jung’s work. However, Jung then evolved his thinking to a standpoint that was more aligned to Foucault’s own. Thereafter, the post Jungian concept of normality has remained relatively undeveloped by comparison with psychoanalysis and mainstream psychology. Jung’s disjecta membra on the subject suggest that, in contemporary analytical psychology, too much focus is placed on the process of individuation to the neglect of applications that consider collective processes. Also, there is potential for useful research and development into the nature of conflict between individuals and societies, and how normal people typically develop in relation to the spectrum between individuation and collectivity...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIt is well {{established}} that sensitivity is not necessarily equivalent at isoeccentric locations across the visual field. The focus {{of this study was}} a psychophysical examination of the spatial sensitivity differences between the upper and lower visual hemifields under conditions biased toward the presumed magnocellular or parvocellular visual pathway. Experiment 1 showed higher contrast sensitivity in the lower visual field when visual sensitivity was biased toward the parvocellular pathway; no visual field anisotropy was found when sensitivity was biased toward the magnocellular pathway. Experiment 2 showed that the magnitude of the contrast sensitivity anisotropy within the presumed parvocellular pathway increased when <b>test</b> <b>targets</b> <b>of</b> higher spatial frequency were used.

40|$|Testing analog and mixed-signal {{circuits}} is {{a costly}} task {{due to the}} required <b>test</b> time <b>targets</b> and high end technical resources. Indirect testing methods partially address these issues providing an efficient solution using easy to measure CUT information that correlates with circuit performances. In this work, a multiple specification band guarding technique is proposed as a method to achieve a <b>test</b> <b>target</b> <b>of</b> misclassified circuits. The acceptance/rejection test regions are encoded using octrees in the measurement space, where the band guarding factors precisely tune the test decision boundary according to the required <b>test</b> yield <b>targets.</b> The generated octree data structure serves to cluster the forthcoming circuits in the production testing phase by solely relying on indirect measurements. The combined use of octree based encoding and multiple specification band guarding makes the testing procedure fast, efficient and highly tunable. The proposed band guarding methodology {{has been applied to}} test a band-pass Butterworth filter under parametric variations. Promising simulation results are reported showing remarkable improvements when the multiple specification band guarding criterion is used. Peer ReviewedPostprint (author's final draft...|$|R

40|$|The {{accuracy}} of color image-acquisition systems {{is most often}} evaluated using <b>test</b> <b>targets</b> <b>of</b> uniform color patches imaged under optimal conditions. In artwork imaging, system performance is judged visually, comparing the art with images rendered for display or print. Because the surface properties of the art may not be uniform, the spectral properties of the pigments may be different than the <b>test</b> <b>targets,</b> the sizes may be different, renderings are often metameric to the art, taking and viewing lighting geometries may be different, and the museum observers are more experienced than scientists in judging color accuracy visually, color accuracy as determined on a visual basis may be quite different than target performance. Therefore, an experiment was performed where a spectral-imaging system, designed for scientific purposes under laboratory conditions, {{was taken to a}} museum and tested in its photographic and conservation departments. The work of art evaluated was Henri Matisse’s Pot of Geraniums. Spectral and colorimetric comparisons were made between in situ small aperture spectrophotometry and imaging. The average performance was 3. 7 ∆E 00 and 3. 1 % spectral RMS; this was similar to an independent verification <b>target</b> <b>of</b> typical artist pigments applied to a canvas board. Viewed in close up, this level of accuracy yielded reasonable color matching for images rendered for display and print.

40|$|A {{comparative}} study {{was made of}} random dot printing and conventional halftone printing with respect to color characteristics. Random dot printing is similar to continuous tone printing or very high frequency screen ruling and is capable of overcoming the limitatio of halftone printing. The randomly selected dots are achieved by the grain structure of the pre- sensitized printing plates. The advantages and the disadvantages of this process over conventional halftone printing process are discussed. The images and the <b>test</b> <b>targets</b> <b>of</b> both the processes were exposed to, and printed from a single plate for each process color so as to eliminate the ink and press variables.

Further, the attributes of colors, such as lightness or brightness, saturation and dominant wavelength (hue) were compared by plotting the chromaticity diagram (eIE 1931). The chromaticity diagrams were plotted for two different standard light sources and the results were discussed. For a better representation of the data an enlarged chromaticity diagram was used.

40|$|Endogenously tagging {{proteins}} {{with green}} fluorescent protein (GFP) enables the visualization of the tagged protein using live cell microscopy. GFP-tagging is widely utilized to study biological processes in model experimental organisms including filamentous fungi such as Aspergillus nidulans. Many strains of A. nidulans have therefore been generated with different proteins endogenously tagged with GFP. To further enhance experimental approaches based upon GFP-tagging, we have adapted the GFP Binding Protein (GBP) system for A. nidulans. GBP is a genetically encoded Llama single chain antibody against GFP which binds GFP with high affinity. Using gene replacement approaches, it is therefore possible to link GBP to anchor proteins, which will then retarget GFP-tagged proteins away from their normal location {{to the location of}} the anchor-GBP protein. To facilitate this approach in A. nidulans, we made four base plasmid cassettes {{that can be used to}} generate gene replacement GBP-tagging constructs by utilizing fusion PCR. Using these base cassettes, fusion PCR, and gene targeting approaches, we generated strains with SPA 10 -GBP and Tom 20 -GBP gene replacements. These strains enabled <b>test</b> <b>targeting</b> <b>of</b> GFP-tagged proteins to septa or to the surface of mitochondria respectively. SPA 10 -GBP is shown to effectively target GFP-tagged proteins to both forming and mature septa. Tom 20 -GBP has a higher capacity to retarget GFP-tagged proteins being able to relocate all Nup 49 -GFP from its location within nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) to the cytoplasm in association with mitochondria. Notably, removal of Nup 49 -GFP from NPCs causes cold sensitivity as does deletion of the nup 49 gene.
