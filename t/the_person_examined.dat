40|$|This study {{investigated}} a new procedure to assess memory using routine neuropsychological tests of other functions (i. e. ability) {{in order to}} increase time efficiency, and lessen the hardship by combining procedure. A sample of 'healthy' older age adult participants and participants presumed to experience dementia related mild cognitive impairment were recruited through a memory clinic tested using the new procedures to determine: a) whether the registration and retention of such material is adequate for testing of recall and recognition, b) How dependent are the results of these procedures on the abilitylevel of <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>examined.</b> This study has emerged from levels of processing theory (Craick & Lockhart, 1972), which might aid in understanding the workings of the procedure. Levels of processing theory suggest that the successful remembering will depend on the level of processing that takes place. Findings suggest that ability tests that demand 'deeper' elaboration integration are good candidates for adaptations for memory assessment and they address memory in a more naturalistic way. Memory performance was not dependent on corresponding ability test attainments. The procedure as whole appears to be able to highlight individual strengths and weaknesses profiles, though further adjustments are needed to the procedure.

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of goiter and the median urinary iodine concentration {{are the most}} important indicators for assessing iodine deficiency disorders (IDD) and for defining criteria of the severity of any associated public health problem (1). For years, palpation has been the single method available for defining thyroid volume. A slight modification (2) of the method of Perez et al. (3) has been most commonly used: by definition, ‘a thyroid gland whose lateral lobes have a volume greater than the terminal phalanges of the thumbs of <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>examined</b> will be considered as goitrous’. When this criterion is met, overall thyroid volume is at least four to five times greater than normal (3). However, as technology progressed, ultrasonography became to be considered the most reliable method for the estimation of thyroid volume (4 – 7). School-age children are the most useful target group for IDD surveillance (1); consequently, normative values for thyroid volume measured by ultrasonography in iodine-replete schoolchildren were needed. After a few pre-liminary studies (Table 1), the normative values proposed by Gutekunst & Martin-Teichert (8) were those most commonly used. A major change as compared with palpation was that the criterion for goiter was now a thyroid volume above the 97 percentile of the reference population. The criteria of Gutekunst & Martin-Teichert (8) were also used during the early phase of a collaborative study on thyroid volume and urinary iodine conducted by Delange et al. (9) at 57 locations in 12 European countries and including 7599 schoolchildren aged 6 – 17 years. In this population as a whole there was, as could be expected, a highly significant inverse correla-tion between urinary iodine and the {{prevalence of}} goiter. However, an unexpected observation was that, when these criteria were used, the prevalence of goiter was systematically largely above the cut-off point of 5 % considered as the upper limit of normal (1) at all the locations of investigation, even when the median urinary iodine concentration was above the cut-off point of 100 mg/l. Therefore, the suitability of the criteria of Gutekunst & Martin-Teichert (8) was questioned, and updated normative values were derived from a cluster made of 3265 European schoolchildren from 23 differen...|$|E

Benchmarks were followed {{in relation to the}} gender of <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>examined.</b> The origin of the superior mesenteric artery relative to the spine we found it in a range between T 12 vertebra and L 1 -L 2 intervertebral disc. The T 12 vertebra origin was localized in 2 cases (4. 35 % of cases), both in women. Superior mesenteric artery originated at the level of L 1 in 78. 26 % (90. 91 % of male cases and in 66. 67 % of women cases). In 8 cases (17. 39 % of cases) the origin of the superior mesenteric artery was located at the L 1 -L 2 intervertebral disc. Endolumenal vertical diameter of the superior mesenteric artery orifice we found it in the range of 5. 6 to 10. 9 mm (6. 9 to 10. 9 mm in men, and 5. 6 to 8. 6 mm in women). Horizontal diameter sizes ranged from 4. 9 to 9. 7 mm, having 6. 4 to 9. 7 mm in men and 4. 9 to 8. 3 mm in women. Vertical diameter in males was higher in 59. 09 % of cases, with differences between 0. 1 to 2. 4 mm, and in 40. 91 % of cases the horizontal diameter was larger with differences between 0, 1 - 2. 1 mm. Vertical diameter in women was higher in 50 % of cases, with differences of 0. 1 - 2. 0 mm and the other 50 % the horizontal diameter was larger, with differences ranging from 0. 1 to 2. 2 mm. The angle that the superior mesenteric artery makes it with the aortic wall we found between 16, 60 - 120, 8 o, males having values between 24, 8 - 120, 8 o, and in women 16, 7 - 120, 8 o. The distance between the origin of the superior mesenteric artery and celiac trunk we found it between 5. 0 and 16. 5 mm, males having 5. 0 to 12. 1 mm and women 6. 9 - 16. 5 mm. The distance between the origin of the superior mesenteric artery and right renal artery was ranging between 6. 2 to 23. 5 mm, in males being 6. 5 to 19. 1 mm and in women from 6. 2 to 23 5 mm. The distance between the origin of the superior mesenteric artery and left renal artery we found between 5. 7 to 23. 5 mm, in males being 5. 7 to 21. 2 mm, and in women from 6. 2 to 23 5 mm. The distance between the aortic origin of the superior and inferior mesenteric arteries was ranging between 50. 6 to 91. 2 mm, in males being 50. 6 to 91. 2 mm and in women from 58. 2 to 88. 4 mm...|$|E

By studying persons who were diagnosed as having tuberculosis, investigations were performed on the following subjects : 00 The trend of transition of the disease from year to year; (2) The relationship of the acquisition of sensitivity to tuberculin and the onset of the disease, with special reference to the onset of <b>the</b> disease in <b>persons</b> who had positive tuberculin tests at the time of initial examinations; and (3) The course of the disease, especially of those who had not received any treatment during the period of observations. The results of the investigations are summarized as follows; (1) The ratio of <b>the</b> <b>persons</b> <b>examined</b> to <b>the</b> whole population ranged from 27. 6 per cent to 64. 8 per cent. The ratio of <b>the</b> <b>persons</b> having positive tuberculin tests to all <b>the</b> <b>persons</b> <b>examined</b> was 42. 0 per cent {{in the first year of}} examinations, while it was 73. 2 per cent in <b>the</b> last year. <b>Persons</b> inoculated with BCG vaccine because of having negative or doubtful positive tuberculin tests represented on an average 83. 6 per cent of those who were examined every year. (2) The presence of tuberculosis was determined in 2. 9 per cent of persons having examinations in the first year and in 5. 6 per cent in the last year. A follow-up study of patients with tuberculosis showed that those with primary tuberculosis and infiltrative tuberculosis tended to decrease in number, while those with indurative tuberculosis tended to increase in number. (3) <b>The</b> <b>persons</b> who were diagnosed as having tuberculosis during the whole period of examinations were 631 in number, representing 5. 8 per cent of a total of 10, 764 <b>persons</b> <b>examined</b> during that period. Of these 621 persons, 213 persons (2. 0 per cent) had active tuberculosis. There were larger percentages of persons with both active and arrested tuberculosis in middleaged and aged groups than in any other groups. (4) Observations had been made of <b>the</b> <b>persons</b> with tuberculosis for from 1 to 9 years who had received no treatment during that period. It was revealed that in patients with primary tuberculosis, about 80 per cent manifested improvement; in patients with infiltrative and mixed type tuberculosis, about 30 per cent and 60 per cent, respectively, showed exacerbation; and in patients with productive-fibrotic tuberculosis, about 95 per cent remained unchanged. (5) Of 1, 673 persons who had positive tuberculin tests at the time of initial examinations and who had been followed up for relatively long period, i. e. for from 5 to 9 years, 321 persons had tuberculosis. Retroactive examinations of screen photographs (35 mm films) of 220 persons whose diseases were detected after the second year of examination showed that 218 persons had had tuberculosis at the time of initial examinations and that only 2 persons (0. 12 per cent) had been free from tuberculosis at the time of initial examinations and might, therefore, have developed it after the second year of examinations.

40|$|In this paper, I will {{assert that}} {{reflective}} performance produces {{something that is}} epistemically valuable. My argument depends on us stepping back from the scenario in which the dispute about internalism and externalism about knowledge and justification have developed over recent decades, in order to begin to consider certain, so far little explored, skeptical dialectic challenges. These are skeptical challenges in which individuals are challenged to evaluate and judge {{whether or not their}} beliefs are justified. As a rule, a person is presented with reasons to suspect the limitations of their subjective perspective about the evidence and reasons that dispose them to believe. In dialectical challenges between epistemic peers, both recognize that they are not in a better position than their interlocutor to believe. In this context, to continue the dialogue requires a critical reflective examination of their initial beliefs (with their evidence and reasons) and, in the end, the achievement of epistemic change: <b>the</b> <b>person</b> must improve, expand, deepen, better understand, guarantee, confirm, renounce, or suspend their judgment etc. In this sense, reflection is understood as a performance, an activity in which <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>examines</b> <b>the</b> evidence, content and reliability of their own beliefs. This performance may lead to different results, but if someone is capable of critically reflecting on their own beliefs in skeptical-dialectic contexts, this is a positive thing, whatever the result – contrary to people who, in the face of skeptical challenges, simply decide to remain intellectually immobile, maintaining a cowardly, arrogant or dogmatic position...|$|R
