40|$|We use firm-level {{data from}} the Bureau of Economic Analysis to {{document}} {{a new set of}} facts regarding the behavior of U. S. multinational firms. First, we find that intra-firm trade is concentrated among a small number of large affiliates: The median affiliate reports no shipments to the parent, and directs the bulk of its sales <b>to</b> <b>unrelated</b> <b>parties</b> in its country of operation. In this sense, “horizontal ” rather than “vertical ” FDI seems to better capture the role of most U. S. affiliates abroad. Second, we find that multinational firms often own affiliates that operate in upstream or downstream industries, as defined by their industries ’ input-output coefficients. These input-output links, however, are not associated with intra-firm flows of physical goods. We conjecture that the comparative advantage of multinational companies lies in their ability to transfer intangible—rather than physical—inputs among production units...|$|E

Using a detailed 2006 - 2008 data set for Spanish manufacturing firms, we then establish a number of stylized facts about firm-level heterogeneity in sourcing strategies that have largely gone unnoticed in existing literature on input sourcing. Finally, we explore this heterogeneity through econometric estimation of productivity premia associated with different sourcing strategies. We find a robustly significant premium on a strategy that features offshore production of intermediate inputs through a related party (vertical integration). Lower productivity premia are found for strategies that rely on outsourcing <b>to</b> <b>unrelated</b> <b>parties</b> abroad or on vertical integration within the home economy. Across all specifications employed, estimated mean productivity is lowest for domestic-outsourcing firms. ...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} the optimal choice of transfer pricing regulations from a normative point of view. In this context we put {{special emphasis on}} the treatment of business relocations. Two inefficiencies may arise: First, firms may structure a transaction as multinational enterprise (MNE) for tax reasons even though it would be welfare enhancing {{to carry out the}} transaction between unrelated parties due to the differences in transaction costs. Second, firms may not undertake a transaction, because under given regulations, it may not pay off even though such a transaction would be welfare enhancing. We show that the simple rule "related parties have to use the market price of unrelated parties as the intercompany transfer price as long as no party is worse off " implements the first best solution. Surprisingly, this shows that one does not have to account for efficiency differences of a MNE compared <b>to</b> <b>unrelated</b> <b>parties...</b>|$|E
40|$|This note {{discusses}} the difficulties currently being experienced in implementing Ecological Sustainable Development (ESD) from a development perspective. It looks at what motivates developers and examines what is needed, either through mandatory measures or incentives {{to change the}} development culture in Australia. The note draws on experience {{from a number of}} current and recently completed projects and incorporates input from developers. It also includes discussion on the evolving outcomes of current industry initiatives aimed specifically at changing development processes and culture in Australia. The note focuses on new buildings. The way in which new buildings are financed and delivered generally differs significantly from retrofit projects being undertaken by building owners. Building owners can more easily factor long term operational costs of their buildings into their retrofit project financing. Typically, building developers are not the long-term owners, operators or tenants of the buildings that they deliver. Their projects are normally sold before or soon after completion <b>to</b> <b>unrelated</b> <b>parties</b> such as property trusts, superannuation funds, and other investors. It is this discontinuity in development and ownership of new buildings that creates perhaps the single biggest challenge to the uptake of ESD for the property industry...|$|E
50|$|Production Tax Credits (PTC) {{were a part}} of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (102nd Congress H.R.776.ENR, {{abbreviated}} as EPACT92) and {{are intended}} for wind and bioenergy resources. The purpose of the Production Tax Credit is to support renewable energy based upon the environmental, economic, and energy security benefits that renewable energy resources can provide. Besides wind energy, the PTC also covers closed loop biomass, geothermal power, and half the rate for open loop biomass, hydropower, landfill gas, and municipal solid waste. The PTC provides a 2.2 cent per kilowatt-hour benefit for the first ten years of a renewable energy facility's operation.

City of Auburn, New York, {{a single}} mother named Diane Pilchen was living as a rental tenant in a foreclosed house, in which the owner (landlord) of the house had failed to pay the water bill for some time.

The city condemned the home and forced Pilchen and her child to move out. Pilchen was represented by the Public Utility Law Project of New York (PULP) in the lawsuit. The City of Auburn attempted unsuccessfully to argue that water is not a constitutional right because bottled water could be used instead, an argument that was contested by PULP as absurd.

40|$|In Altera Corp. v. Commissioner, the United States Tax Court invalidated a 2003 Treasury Regulation {{for failing}} to meet State Farm’s {{reasoned}} decisionmaking standard under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). Invalidating this specific regulation eliminates one of the federal government’s latest attempts to limit income tax avoidance {{by some of the}} world’s largest and wealthiest corporations in the murky world of transfer pricing. This Note demonstrates that the Tax Court’s ruling must be limited to its specific APA holding and argues that Treasury may enact a similar regulation under the existing statutory and regulatory framework of the arm’s length standard. Under the APA, Treasury must respond to all significant comments and provide a reasonable statement of basis and purpose for a new regulation. This Note offers viable responses to the public comments Treasury (apparently) inadequately addressed and proposes a framework for a statement of basis and purpose that would satisfy State Farm’s reasoned decisionmaking standard under the APA. These responses demonstrate that sharing employee compensation expenses indexed to a corporation’s stock price is not comparable between related and <b>unrelated</b> <b>parties</b> because they have inherently different risks. Therefore, while Treasury failed to respond to comments that provided evidence that <b>unrelated</b> <b>parties</b> do not share stock-based compensation, a finding that determined the outcome in Altera, it does not follow that requiring <b>unrelated</b> <b>parties</b> <b>to</b> share stock-based compensation violates the overarching arm’s length standard. Finally, this Note proposes that if Treasury can provide evidence that related companies share a smaller percentage of total employee compensation relative <b>to</b> <b>unrelated</b> companies in similar arrangements, such a regulation is consistent with the arm’s length standard. This regulation would be consistent with the standard because it creates transaction results that are “consistent with the results that would have been realized if uncontrolled taxpayers had engaged in the same transaction,” and achieves the purpose of Internal Revenue Code § 482...|$|R
50|$|The {{comparable}} uncontrolled price (CUP) {{method is}} a transactional method that determines the arm's-length price using the prices charged in comparable transactions between <b>unrelated</b> <b>parties.</b> In principle, the OECD and most countries that follow the OECD guidelines consider the CUP method {{to be the}} most direct method, provided that any differences between the controlled and uncontrolled transactions have no material effect on price or their effects can be estimated and corresponding price adjustments can be made.

F(1) spleen cells from mice immunized with F(1) GAT-Mφ or GAT-MBSA developed secondary responses to responder and nonresponder parental and F(1) GAT- Mφ, but not <b>to</b> <b>unrelated</b> third <b>party</b> GAT-Mφ. Spleen cells from F(1) mice immunized with either parental GAT-Mφ developed secondary responses to F(1) GAT-Mφ {{and only the}} parental GAT-Mφ used for immunization in vivo. Soluble GAT-primed F(1) spleen cells responded to F(1) and responder parental, but not nonresponder parental, GAT-Mφ. Simultaneous immunization in vivo with the various GAT-Mφ or GAT-MBSA plus soluble GAT modulated the response pattern of these F(1) spleen cells such that they developed secondary responses only to F(1) and parental responder GAT-Mφ regardless of the response pattern observed after immunization with the various GAT-Mφ or GAT-MBSA alone. These observations demonstrate the critical importance of the physical state of the GAT used for immunization in determining the subsequent response pattern of immune F(1) spleen cells to the parental and F(1) GAT-Mφ. Further, suppressor T cells, capable of inhibiting primary responses to GAT by virgin F(1) spleen cells stimulated by nonresponder parental GAT-Mφ, were demonstrated in spleens of F(1) mice immunized with soluble GAT, but not those primed with F(1) GAT-Mφ. Because responder parental mice develop both helper and suppressor T cells after immunization with GAT-Mφ, and soluble GAT preferentially stimulates suppressor T cells whereas GAT-Mφ stimulate helper T cells in nonresponder parental mice, these observations suggest that distinct subsets of T cells exist in F(1) mice which behave phenotypically as responder and nonresponder parental T cells after immunization with soluble GAT and GAT- Mφ...|$|R
