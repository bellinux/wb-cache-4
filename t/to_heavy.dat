40|$|Our present {{studies has}} shown that the mass {{dependence}} of EVF show mass asymmetry independent behaviour. This is due the fact that with increase in asymmetry, the number of nucleon-nucleon collisions and repulsive Coulomb interactions decreases, therefore EVF increases. The increase in EVF with asymmetry is more for lighter nuclei as compared <b>to</b> <b>heavier</b> nuclei due <b>to</b> the further less magnitude of Coulomb repulsions in lighter nuclei as compared <b>to</b> <b>heavier</b> ones.
