40|$|Measurement of {{residual}} stresses in thin films or <b>textured</b> <b>materials</b> by X-ray diffraction {{is always a}} challenge task. The limited diffraction volume in thin films or the directions with low pole density in sharply <b>textured</b> <b>materials</b> results in a weak diffraction signals. The sharp stress gradient, anisotropic grain shape and inhomogeneous phase and microstructure distribution also add difficulties in stress analysis with the conventional X-ray diffraction method. The nonlinear εψφ- sin 2 ψ behavior, commonly associated with thin films and <b>textured</b> <b>materials,</b> produces poor results. This paper introduces a method using diffraction rings from multiple (hkl) crystalline planes collected with area detectors to analyze residual stresses. FUNDAMENTALS The stress measurement with an area detector {{is based on a}} direct relationship between the stress tensor and the diffraction cone distortion. The fundamental equation for stress measurement is developed with the matrix transformation defined for the twodimensional diffraction. Stresses in a sample distort the diffraction cone shape so that 2 θ becomes a function of γ, 2 θ = 2 θ(γ), this function is uniquely determined by the stress tensor and the sample orientation. The fundamental equation for stress measurement using 2 D detector is given [1] as ⎛ sin...|$|R

40|$|Some {{inaccuracies}} {{are possible}} during the near-surface residual stress measurement of <b>textured</b> <b>material</b> by X-ray diffraction using the standard multiexposure technique. Diffraction intensities depend on factors like inclination of the sample, {{the rotation of}} the beam, and the position of detectors. Low intensity due to texture can result in increased percentage error observed stress values. Anisotropy of elastic constants in textured materials can further increase the errors in measured stress. In the present study, the effect of texture on residual stress has been studied for seamless Ti- 3 wt%Al- 2 Vwt% tubes, in pilgered and annealed conditions, by superimposing the residual stress measurements on the pole figure obtained by texture measurement. A general approach has been developed for accurate determination of the stress tensor in <b>textured</b> <b>material.</b> This consists of the selection of inclinations giving rise to high intensity peak, the selection of rotation angles symmetric to the pole figure to get similar intensity from both the detectors (where this is not possible one detector with low intensity is shut off), and the calculation of the bulk X-ray elastic constants using the single crystal elastic data and texture. Cold worked Ti- 3 wt%Al- 2 Vwt% tubes had the highest stress along the rolling direction and that is compressive in nature. The principal residual stresses in the pilgered tubes were along the rolling and transverse directions, and annealing leads to reduction and reorientation of the stresses...|$|E

40|$|A coated {{conductor}} {{is generally}} fabricated by depositing a high Tc superconducting layer onto a flexible metallic substrate, using intermediate buffer layers to prevent chemical interaction. In {{order for the}} superconductor {{to be capable of}} carrying a high current density, its grains must have good crystallographic alignment {{in order to avoid the}} presence of high angle grain boundaries. This can be ensured by transferring the texture from the substrate through epitaxial film growth. The main substrate considered in this thesis is a Ni-Fe alloy. When cold-rolled, NiFe develops a preferential orientation and upon annealing at an elevated temperature, undergoes primary recrystallisation to form grains with the cube texture { 100 }. The recrystallisation process and the texture of the tapes has been examined and various buffer layers have been fabricated. As silver does not react adversely with high temperature superconductors, it has been deposited onto Pd-buffered NiFe by DC sputtering and very sharp cube texture is obtained. Ceramic buffer layers, CeO 2 and YSZ, have been deposited by RF sputtering, though an undesirable (111) oriented component accompanies the cube <b>textured</b> <b>material.</b> Also a technique has been developed to produce a suitably oriented native oxide of NiFe by a simple oxidation technique. Preliminary attempts to deposit YBCO films onto these buffer layers have shown that the quality of the metallic buffers is degraded by rapid inter-diffusion at elevated temperatures, but that cube <b>textured</b> <b>material</b> can be deposited on the oxide buffer layers. The percolative nature of current flow in such coated conductors has been considered through the development of a grain network model. As the texture of the superconducting layer is directly influenced by the underlying layers, measurements from the substrate and buffer layers are applied in order to model the orientations of the grains in a superconducting overlayer. The model calculates the critical current of coated conductors as a function of parameters such as length, width, grain size and texture, as well as examining factors such as cracks and highly misoriented grains.
