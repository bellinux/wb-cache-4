40|$|This article {{argues for}} the {{rigorous}} academic scrutiny of Zimbabwean African Instituted Church (AIC) texts, such as African Apostolic Church (AAC) founder Paul Mwazhaâ€™s The Divine Commission of Paul Mwazha of Africa. Using Mwazhaâ€™s case as an example, the article discusses relevant aspects of Zimbabweâ€™s socio-cultural history as constituting {{the context in}} which the AIC founder has developed a particular discursive practice, including a founding <b>text,</b> <b>to</b> <b>insert</b> himself as a â€˜world-historical figureâ€™ into the national history and that history into his own identity and that of the church he formed. The article concludes that the novelty of AICs resides in the fact that texts such as Mwazhaâ€™s show that colonised Africans challenged the hegemonic order established by their European masters by insisting on their basic rights, such as human dignity and self-determination, leading to the formation of their own churches. Academic scrutiny of AIC texts will therefore reveal strategies used to attain this hegemonic goal and how this has shaped past and contemporary African identities...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{detailed}} production traceability {{information is}} a fundamental element in successful introduction and revitalization of traceability system. In this paper, we propose a production traceability information gathering system {{which is based on}} handwritten data digitalization technology in agro-livestock products. By the proposed system, we can effectively gather the detailed production traceability information with digital pen and the management ledger of paper document type by only writing the ledger. The server of the system generates the same digital image as the ledger and converts the handwritten data into digital <b>text</b> <b>to</b> <b>insert</b> the data into the database. Because the system is superior to data gathering system based on PC, PDA and touch screen in mobility, usability, data input speed, suitability in agro-livestock environment, it is possible to effectively gather traceability information of high quality by users even if they have low information ability and insufficient time to input data. We expect that the handwritten data digitalization technology is used to gather document based information in stage of manufacturing, distribution and marketing. In addition, this technology is applied t...|$|E

In this work we propose 'CloSe', the evolution, in cloud technology, of a monolithic system for document processing, based on semantic methodologies, that we have developed in the past years for offering editing/composing aiding services. The proposed system will help users in writing documents, exploiting information and data collected from heterogeneous sources in order <b>to</b> suggest proper <b>text</b> sections <b>to</b> <b>insert</b> into documents. We have produced a system prototype that realises semantic retrieval features, in order to assist skilled and generic users in document composition. Moreover, we have reported some experimental results for evaluating {{the effectiveness of the}} system in composing documents by suggesting proper document segments.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss natural {{language}} watermarking, which uses {{the structure of the}} sentence constituents in natural language <b>text</b> in order <b>to</b> <b>insert</b> a watermark. This approach is different from techniques, collectively referred to as “text watermarking, ” which embed information by modifying the appearance of text elements, such as lines, words, or characters. We provide a survey of {{the current state of the}} art in natural language watermarking and introduce terminology, techniques, and tools for text processing. We also examine the parallels and differences of the two watermarking domains and outline how techniques from the image watermarking domain may be applicable to the natural language watermarking domain...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{gives an}} {{overview}} of the research and implementation challenges we encountered in building an endto-end natural language processing based watermarking system. With natural language watermarking, we mean embedding the watermark into a text document, using the natural language components as the carrier, {{in such a way that}} the modifications are imperceptible to the readers and the embedded information is robust against possible attacks. Of particular interest is using the structure of the sentences in natural language <b>text</b> in order <b>to</b> <b>insert</b> the watermark. We evaluated the quality of the watermarked text using an objective evaluation metric, the BLEU score. BLEU scoring is commonly used in the statistical machine translation community.

The Hours of the Cross contain fourteen miniatures arranged in pairs which depict the Passion of Christ from the entrance into Jerusalem to the holy burial. The Hours of the Virgin contain eight pairs of miniatures, most of which feature an episode from Our Lady’s life from the Annunciation to the Crowning, together with the occasional related episode from the Old Testament. The manuscript’s finest miniatures {{are to be found}} in these two cycles, in which the artist reduces the <b>text</b> <b>inserts</b> <b>to</b> a minimum, sometimes just two lines, to leave as much room as possible for the illumination. The uniform style of the margins helps give these insertions a seamless, visual continuity.|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} years, the {{adoption}} of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) have been widely promoted, with the final aim of improving care quality and patient safety. Yet, sharing patient data in a large distributed and heterogeneous context, such as the healthcare domain, has inherently introduced security and privacy risks, due to the great sensitivity and confidentiality of the patient data and the need of accessing such data by {{a large number of}} health care workers with various roles for the patient care. Even though various techniques have been developed to effectively implement fine-grained access control, which allows flexibility in specifying differential access rights of individual users, some unsolved problems can be pointed out with respect to the specification of complex policies over EHRs: (i) the difficulty of forcing narrative <b>text</b> <b>to</b> assume a semi-structured coded form into EHRs in order to build access control policies also working at a section-level; (ii) an overly high-level of theoretical ability required to practically use access control models and policy languages as a whole, due to a scarce integration among them; and (iii) the lack of tools for easily editing and upgrading access control policies over EHRs. In order to face all these open issues, this paper proposes a hybrid framework aimed at enabling and supporting the definition of fine-grained access control policies working on semi-structured EHRs. The key issues of the framework are: (i) a semantic-based method that hybridizes linguistic and statistical techniques in order to give a semi-structured form <b>to</b> a narrative <b>text</b> <b>to</b> be <b>inserted</b> into EHRs, by identifying its specific sections; (ii) a formal role-based authorization model, encoded as a couple of ontologies, to regulate the access to these semi-structured EHRs with respect to their sections; and (iii) a procedural policy language and a set of patterns to simply encode and update access control restrictions in the form of "if-then rules" built {{on the top of the}} ontological model formalized. A prototype implementation of this framework is realized in the form of a system offering simple and intuitive interfaces to the security administrators. Finally, an experimental evaluation over real documents contained into EHRs, i. e. discharge summaries, is described, showing the feasibility of the proposed framework and suggesting that its application could simply and proficiently secure the access to healthcare information contained into semi-structured EHRs and, thus, face security and privacy risks in real healthcare scenarios. © 2015 Elsevier B.
