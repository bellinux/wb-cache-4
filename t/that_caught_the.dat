He was Cristian Nemescu's preferred choice from the beginning, however a rigorous casting still took place. Apparently attracted to Mădălina Ghiţescu, Huian showed a different attitude than that of other candidates, which only convinced the director further.|$|E
5|$|The oldest form of hare {{coursing}} simply involved two dogs chasing a hare, the winner being the dog <b>that</b> <b>caught</b> <b>the</b> hare; {{this could be}} for sport, food or pest control. In order to indulge in the informal practice, or hunting, various cross breeds (under the generic British term lurchers) have been created; such animals may be specifically bred for coursing, such as the staghounds used to hunt coyote in the United States. Informal coursing has long been closely associated with pheasant hunting or poaching, lacking the landowner's permission, and is often seen as a problem by the local public, landowners and the police. Clubs affiliated to the Association of Lurcher Clubs organised informal coursing with the landowner's permission, sometimes using a single lurcher rather than a pair to chase a hare.|$|E

With the help of goaltending coach Phil Myre, Tugnutt worked on the fundamentals, gained some confidence and improved his game each season.

25|$|The game is {{won only}} after the snitch has been caught cleanly, and the team <b>that</b> <b>caught</b> <b>the</b> snitch is awarded 30 points. The winner is {{determined}} not by the snitch catch but {{by the number of}} points earned; thus it is not unknown for teams that are losing by a wide margin to try delaying a snitch catch so that they can narrow the opponents' lead, along with the reverse, with the winning team trying to extend their lead.|$|E

25|$|The game ends {{after the}} snitch {{has been caught}} through what is called by a clean catch. The catch is {{determined}} by the Snitch Referee, The Head Referee, and the Snitch Runner. The team <b>that</b> <b>caught</b> <b>the</b> snitch is awarded 30 points, regardless if they are winning or losing the game. The winner is determined not by the snitch catch but by the number of points earned throughout the entirety of the game play. Depending on the score teams will delay the snitch catch in order to better their chances of winning. Teams that are losing will defend the snitch by placing themselves between the Snitch Runner and the opposing seeker.|$|E
25|$|During {{the second}} summer {{session at the}} University, both Moore and Sharpe began to work with players on the {{offensive}} change, and in August Royal and Bellard traveled to Tuscaloosa and led a coaching clinic for the Alabama staff on the wishbone. In {{order to keep the}} change a secret, Bryant closed all of the Crimson Tide's practices closed from the public, screened the practice field from view with a canvas and hired security to keep people away. The change to the wishbone was kept under such secrecy that when the media would visit practice, Bryant had the team practice the pro-style system that was phased out. Alabama later opened the season with an upset victory over USC that was credited to the surprise switch to the wishbone <b>that</b> <b>caught</b> <b>the</b> Trojans off-guard.|$|E

25|$|A team {{consists}} of minimum seven (maximum 21) players, of which six {{are always on}} the pitch, those being the three chasers, one keeper, and two beaters. Besides the seeker who is off-pitch, the six players are required {{to abide by the}} gender rule, which states that a team may have a maximum of four players who identify as the same gender, excluding the seeker, making quidditch one of the few sports that not only offers a co-ed environment but an open community to those who do not identify with the gender binary. Matches or games often run about 30 to 40 minutes but tend to be subject to varying lengths of time due to the unpredictable nature of the snitch catch. If the score {{at the end of the}} match including the 30 point snitch catch is tied (such that the team <b>that</b> <b>caught</b> <b>the</b> snitch was 30 points behind the other), the game moves to overtime where the snitch is constrained to the pitch's dimensions and the game ends after five minutes or when the snitch is legally caught.|$|E

In a Shōnen Club Premium interview on May 7, 2009, he revealed {{that it was the}} Japanese drama Kisarazu Cat's Eye <b>that</b> <b>caught</b> <b>the</b> attention of viewers and directors, and made them aware of his acting ability. The success of the drama led to the making of two movie sequels, Kisarazu Cat's Eye: Nihon Series and Kisarazu Cat's Eye: World Series. His other notable dramas include Tiger & Dragon, a comedy drama about rakugo, a form of Japanese comedy acted only by one person telling that story. and SP (also known as Security Police), an action suspense drama about a team of security police bodyguards in charge of protecting important people in the government.

25|$|In Greek mythology, {{the myths}} {{associated}} with Scorpio almost invariably also contain {{a reference to}} Orion. According {{to one of these}} myths it is written that Orion boasted to goddess Artemis and her mother, Leto, that he would kill every animal on the Earth. Although Artemis was known to be a hunter herself she offered protection to all creatures. Artemis and her mother Leto sent a scorpion to deal with Orion. The pair battled and the scorpion killed Orion. However, the contest was apparently a lively one <b>that</b> <b>caught</b> <b>the</b> attention of the king of the gods Zeus, who later raised the scorpion to heaven and afterwards, at the request of Artemis, did the same for Orion to serve as a reminder for mortals to curb their excessive pride. There is also a version that Orion was better than the goddess Artemis but said that Artemis was better than he and so Artemis took a liking to Orion. The god Apollo, Artemis's twin brother, grew angry and sent a scorpion to attack Orion. After Orion was killed, Artemis asked Zeus to put Orion up in the sky. So every winter Orion hunts in the sky, but every summer he flees as the constellation of the scorpion comes.|$|E

25|$|A body of {{research}} <b>that</b> <b>caught</b> <b>the</b> public interest to a great extent, was Coren's work on left-handedness. With his co-researchers, Diane F. Halpern, Clare Porac, and Alan Searleman he studied the causes and consequences of left-handedness. Specifically his research led him to believe that left-handedness could be a marker for various psychological and physical problems. The media became interested in this work when findings began to emerge indicating that left-handedness was often associated with difficult or stressful births. Research showing that left-handers were much more susceptible to accident-related injuries because the constructed world and most machinery and tools are designed for the safety and convenience of right-handers evoked {{a great deal of}} interest and press coverage. However the work that caused the largest stir and the most controversy was a series of studies in collaboration with Diane F. Halpern which showed that left-handers have shorter life spans, often dying younger because of accidents or problems associated with a compromised immune system (possibly a long-term consequence of birth stress related trauma). Although originally the source of much controversy, with confirming data coming from a number of other laboratories, these conclusions have become well enough accepted to appear in basic psychological textbooks. The discovery of a possible genetic basis of left-handedness suggests that there may be two types of left-handers, natural left-handers and a separate group who arrive at their left-handedness because of birth stress and are more susceptible to immune system related problems.|$|E
