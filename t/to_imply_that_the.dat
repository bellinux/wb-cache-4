The good ending can only be {{achieved}} by completing secret minigames, in which various animatronic characters bring a cake to {{what seems to be}} a sorrowful child's soul. This ending is thought <b>to</b> <b>imply</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> souls of the murdered children have been set free, although connoted meanings are disputed.|$|E
25|$|The President {{receives}} {{all foreign}} Ambassadors. This {{clause of the}} Constitution, known as the Reception Clause, has been interpreted <b>to</b> <b>imply</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> President possesses broad power over matters of foreign policy, and to provide support for the President's exclusive authority to grant recognition to a foreign government.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, it was {{reported}} that the Russian Air Force had tactical and technical requirements {{for a new generation of}} strategic bombers. According to some early reports, the PAK DA would be heavily based on the supersonic Tu-160 bomber. Later references to the new bomber, including a televised address from then-Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, seemed <b>to</b> <b>imply</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> aircraft would be an entirely new design.|$|E

25|$|Relative clauses {{are marked}} with final determiners. If the {{definite}} referent {{of the relative}} clause has already been accounted in the discourse or is otherwise obvious, the relative clause is marked with the definite /-sh/. Relative clauses can also be marked with the indefinite determiner marker /-m/; generally this is used <b>to</b> <b>imply</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> referent is being introduced into the discourse for the first time. However, the nominal head is almost always marked by the indefinite determiner /-m/.|$|E
25|$|In the {{planning}} of Goodwood, Montgomery appeared to promise that the attack would be a breakthrough and that when the VIII Corps failed to break-out, by some accounts the Supreme Commander, US General Dwight D. Eisenhower felt he had been misled. While his intermittent communications to Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF) appeared to promise a breakthrough, Montgomery was writing orders to his subordinates for a limited attack. Copies of orders forwarded to SHAEF, called for an armoured division to take Falaise, a town far in the German rear. Three days prior to the attack, Montgomery revised the orders, eliminating Falaise as an objective but neglected to forward copies of the revision; Eisenhower was later furious at the result, which dogged Montgomery, as it allowed his detractors, especially Air Marshal Arthur Tedder, <b>to</b> <b>imply</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> operation was a failure.|$|E
25|$|Pointed foot spades: This type {{has pointed}} feet, and a square crutch; the {{shoulders}} can be pointing upwards or straight. They are a clear {{descendant of the}} pointed shoulder hollow handled spade. The weight {{and size of the}} larger specimens is compatible with the one jin unit of the arched foot flat handled spades; smaller specimens sometimes specify the unit as one jin or more often as a half jin, but frequently do not specify a unit. This seems <b>to</b> <b>imply</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> half jin unit became the norm. They are associated with the State of Zhao, and their find spots are usually in Shanxi or Hebei provinces. They frequently have numerals on their reverses. The two character mint names mean that the cities that cast these coins can be identified with more certainty than those of earlier series.|$|E
40|$|The {{conditions}} for a scaling behaviour from the fragmentation process leading to slow protons are discussed- <b>The</b> scaling referred <b>to</b> <b>implies</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> fragmentation functions depend on the light-cone momentum fraction only. It is shown <b>that</b> differences in <b>the</b> fragmentation functions for valence- and sea-quark knock out give rise to scaling violations. It is proposed that these scaling violations are measured experimentally to put constraints on the four-quark fragmentation functions. Estimates suggest that with reasonable assumptions for the fragmentation functions large effects are to be expected...|$|R

25|$|In 2003, {{southern}} California witnessed powerful chaparral wildfires. Hundreds {{of homes}} {{and hundreds of thousands}} of acres of land went up in flames. Extreme fire weather (low humidity, low fuel moisture and high winds) and the accumulation of dead plant material from 8 years of drought, contributed to a catastrophic outcome. Although some have maintained that fire suppression contributed to an unnatural buildup of fuel loads, a detailed analysis of historical fire data has showed that this may not have been the case. Fire suppression activities had failed to exclude fire from the southern California chaparral. Research showing differences in fire size and frequency between southern California and Baja has been used <b>to</b> <b>imply</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> larger fires north of the border are the result of fire suppression, but this opinion has been challenged by numerous investigators and is no longer supported by the majority of fire ecologists.|$|E
25|$|The phrase {{refers to}} the idea that a butterfly's wings might create tiny changes in the {{atmosphere}} that may ultimately alter the path of a tornado or delay, accelerate or even prevent the occurrence of a tornado in another location. The butterfly does not power or directly create the tornado, but the term is intended <b>to</b> <b>imply</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> flap of the butterfly's wings can cause the tornado: {{in the sense that the}} flap of the wings is a part of the initial conditions; one set of conditions leads to a tornado while the other set of conditions doesn't. The flapping wing represents a small change in the initial condition of the system, which cascades to large-scale alterations of events (compare: domino effect). Had the butterfly not flapped its wings, the trajectory of the system might have been vastly different—but it's also equally possible that the set of conditions without the butterfly flapping its wings is the set that leads to a tornado.|$|E
25|$|The {{notion that}} Rognvald could {{hand over his}} Northern Isles estates to his brother has been {{interpreted}} in various ways. For example, {{it may be that}} he was aware of ongoing Viking raiding in the area and considered the gift from the king as a mixed blessing. This is also {{one of a number of}} instances in which the writer of the Orkneyinga saga attempts to reconcile the conflicting themes of independence from Norway (Rognvald gifts the islands to Sigurd) and dependence on royal authority (Harald formalises the process by confirming Sigurd as earl). Beuermann (2011) speculates that Rognvald's transfer of power to his brother may have been an attempt by the saga writers <b>to</b> <b>imply</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Orkney earldom had more independence from Norway than that of Møre and that Rognvald's holdings in Caithness may have allowed for an even greater degree of freedom of action. Such implications are more likely to be rooted in the writer's interest in emphasising Orcadian independence at the time of writing rather than the 9th/10th century events they purport to describe.|$|E

25|$|Following the {{dismissal}} of Robertson in February 1918, Maurice became convinced that troops were being withheld from the Western Front in order to undermine the position of Douglas Haig. When David Lloyd George announced in the House of Commons that British troop levels on the Western Front were at all-time highs, Maurice believed that he was deceiving both Parliament and the British public. In his capacity as Director of Military Operations, Maurice knew that the troop statistics available to his office did not bear out Lloyd George's claims, and he wrote to Robertson's successor, Henry Wilson, to outline his position. After Wilson failed to respond, Maurice {{wrote a letter to}} The Times, criticizing Lloyd George for misleading the public {{about the state of the}} British Expeditionary Force during the German Spring Offensive. The publication of this letter on 7 May caused a political storm, and members of the Liberal opposition, including former Prime Minister H. H. Asquith, called for a debate. This subsequently occurred on 9 May, and Lloyd George was able <b>to</b> <b>imply</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> source of confusion was, in fact, Maurice's office, rather than the Prime Minister's. Maurice was initially suspended, and ultimately forced to retire; he was also denied a court martial.|$|E

500|$|Swedish {{cultural}} {{influence has}} been detected at Sutton Hoo: {{there are strong}} similarities in both the armour and the burial with Vendel-age finds from Sweden. Bruce-Mitford suggested that the connection is close enough <b>to</b> <b>imply</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Wuffing dynasty came from that part of Scandinavia. [...] There are also significant differences, and exact parallels with the workmanship and style of the Sutton Hoo artefacts cannot be found elsewhere; {{as a result the}} connection is generally regarded as unproven.|$|E
500|$|After non-avian dinosaurs were discovered, paleontologists first {{posited that}} they were ectothermic. This {{supposed}} [...] "cold-bloodedness" [...] was used <b>to</b> <b>imply</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ancient dinosaurs were relatively slow, sluggish organisms, even though many modern reptiles are fast and light-footed despite relying on external sources of heat to regulate their body temperature. The idea of dinosaurs as ectothermic and sluggish remained a prevalent view until Robert T. [...] "Bob" [...] Bakker, an early proponent of dinosaur endothermy, published an influential paper on the topic in 1968.|$|E
500|$|On 12 November 1975, the First Fraser Ministry {{was sworn}} in by Kerr.

[...] According to those accounts, Senator Margaret Guilfoyle laughed and said to a colleague, [...] "That's all he knows." [...] Guilfoyle later stated that, if she did make such a remark, it was not meant <b>to</b> <b>imply</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Coalition senators would have broken. However, Kelly lists four Coalition senators who stated, in subsequent years, {{that they would have}} crossed the floor and voted for the appropriation bills.|$|E

500|$|Balzac {{was known}} for his use of realism, {{including}} exquisite detail when describing people and locations. His fanaticism about the name Z. Marcas is cited {{as an example of the}} author's [...] "zeal" [...] for [...] "close local color". Balzac's belief in the connection between one's name and one's destiny is brought to the fore; the pattern demonstrated in Z. Marcas reflects many in the larger collection of Balzac's work. As critic Charles Affron puts it: [...] "The creator of a universe so tied up with inner rhythms and resounding with so many echoes does not hesitate <b>to</b> <b>imply</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> germs of a character's failure can be found in the physical qualities of his name." [...] This idea came to Balzac from Laurence Sterne, as he acknowledged in his 1841 story Ursule Mirouët: [...] ("Should we not agree with Sterne in recognizing the occult power in names, which sometimes mock and sometimes define the characters of their possessors?") ...|$|E
500|$|Freelance {{journalist}} S.I. Rosenbaum, {{writing for}} the Washington Post, criticized Oliver's [...] "Donald Drumpf" [...] appellation as derisive of German Americans and other immigrant groups who anglicized their names upon immigration. Rosenbaum wrote that the phrase was reminiscent of Trump's own xenophobic statements {{in that it was}} part of a long-running trend of [...] "bestowing foreign-sounding names <b>to</b> <b>imply</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> target isn't really an American". Oliver later said that the joke [...] "got out of hand" [...] and never used it on the show again. In an interview with Rolling Stone magazine, he said, [...] "That joke became old for us very quickly. There's a reason we didn't use it again. It really is the song I skip past. It's 'Creep.' It's a good song, Thom Yorke! It was a good song when he wrote it." [...] Alluding to the fact that the segment aired on the same night as the Oscars, the comedian also stated, [...] "We were not doing [...] with the sense that it would become bigger than our show normally is," [...] but the [...] "Drumpf" [...] appellation's later popularity [...] "kind of slightly ruins the memory".|$|E
500|$|Televised {{presidential debates}} were reintroduced {{for the first}} time since the 1960 election. As such, Ford became the first {{incumbent}} president to participate in one. Carter later attributed his victory in the election to the debates, saying they [...] "gave the viewers reason to think that Jimmy Carter had something to offer". The turning point came in the second debate when Ford blundered by stating, [...] "There is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe and there never will be under a Ford Administration." [...] Ford also said that he did not [...] "believe that the Poles consider themselves dominated by the Soviet Union". In an interview years later, Ford said he had intended <b>to</b> <b>imply</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Soviets would never crush the spirits of eastern Europeans seeking independence. However, the phrasing was so awkward that questioner Max Frankel was visibly incredulous at the response. As a result of this blunder, and Carter's promise of a full presidential pardon for political refugees from the Vietnam era during the presidential debates, Ford's surge stalled and Carter was able to maintain a slight lead in the polls.|$|E
