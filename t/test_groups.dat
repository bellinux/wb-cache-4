25|$|What {{made this}} trial novel {{was that the}} {{subjects}} were randomly allocated to their <b>test</b> <b>groups.</b> The up-to-that-time practice was to allocate subjects alternately to each group, based on {{the order in which}} they presented for treatment. This practice could be biased, because those admitting each patient knew to which group that patient would be allocated (and so the decision to admit or not admit a specific patient might be influenced by the experimenter's knowledge of the nature of their illness, and their knowledge of the group to which they would occupy).|$|E
25|$|They asked Jellinek, then at Yale, to {{test whether}} the absence of that {{particular}} chemical would affect the drug’s efficacy in any way. Jellinek set up a complex trial – with 199 subjects, divided randomly into four <b>test</b> <b>groups</b> – involving various permutations of the three drug constituents, with a placebo as a scientific control. Each group took a test remedy for two weeks. The trial lasted eight weeks, {{by the end of}} which each group had taken each test drugs, albeit in a different sequence. Over the entire population of 199 subjects, 120 of the subjects responded to the placebo, and 79 did not. The trial demonstrated that the chemical in question significantly contributed to the remedy's efficacy.|$|E

McGrath said,"They wrote a whole show and taped it, {{and it was just}} devastating for <b>test</b> <b>groups</b> of kids. So they just threw the whole thing in the garbage and never tried it again. It was just too difficult a concept for a 3-year-old". CTW Research director Valeria Lovelace recommended scrapping the episode and going [...] "back to the drawing board", and the idea was abandoned, at least for the season. Producer Michael Loman recalled, [...] "We ate the cost and never aired it. We feel there are a range of issues that we can deal with in the family that do not go to the extreme of divorce". According to Sesame Street researcher Susan Scheiner, {{it was the first time}} the CTW had produced an episode, and after making a large investment, found after tests that the episode did not work. Rosemarie T. Truglio and her colleagues at the CTW cited the episode as an example of the CTW's practice of [...] "listening to the voices of children and by putting their needs first".|$|E

40|$|Background: The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} and compare the clinical and microbiological effectiveness of Periochip TM as an adjunct to scaling and root planing (SRP) with SRP alone in patients with chronic periodontitis. Materials and Methods: This randomized, split mouth, 3 -month clinical and microbiological trial included 30 sites in 15 patients aged 30 - 50 years diagnosed with chronic periodontitis. In each patient, two bilateral pockets probing 5 - 7 mm were randomly assigned to <b>test</b> and control <b>groups.</b> The <b>test</b> <b>group</b> received SRP plus Periochip TM, whereas the control group received SRP alone. Clinical indices and anaerobic culture analysis was done at baseline, 1 month, and 3 months interval. Total bacterial count and analysis of four major periodontopathogenic bacteria Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), Prevotella intermedia (Pi), Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (Aa), and Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn) was done. Results: Significant improvement was obtained in all clinical variables in the <b>test</b> <b>group</b> as compared to the control group over the study period. Total colony counts were significantly reduced in the <b>test</b> <b>group</b> as compared to control over the period of time. At baseline Aa was recovered from 4 <b>test</b> <b>group</b> sites and 5 control group sites, Pg from 15 <b>test</b> <b>group</b> and 14 control group sites, Pi from 5 <b>test</b> <b>group</b> and 2 control group sites, Fn from 7 test and 7 control group sites. At 3 months, Aa was recovered from 1 <b>test</b> <b>group</b> and 4 control group sites, Pg from 4 <b>test</b> <b>group</b> and 8 control group sites, Pi from 1 <b>test</b> <b>group</b> and 1 control group site, Fn from 3 test and 4 control group sites. Conclusion: Periochip TM placement as an adjunct to SRP, showed promising results, when compared to SRP alone. Healthy microflora can be maintained for a longer period of time and delay in the repopulation by periodontopathic microorganisms was observed...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{studies on}} {{traumatic}} damages to skull, the incidences of post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE) are unknown, {{and there is}} still controversy about medicine therapy and seizure control of these patients. In our study we compared medicine therapy in idiopathic epilepsy and war induced PTE. The <b>test</b> <b>group</b> was consisted of 50 war-disabled persons, and the control group consisted of 50 adult men who had idiopathic epilepsy. Our questionnaires were analyzed by statistical methods. Occupation rate in control group was 60 % and in <b>test</b> <b>group</b> was 44 %. In 94 % of the control group and in 80 % of the <b>test</b> <b>group,</b> medicine therapy was started with a single drug. Convulsion occurred by drug dosage decreasing in 36. 4 % of the control and in 60 % of the <b>test</b> <b>group</b> and by stopping the drug it occurred in 50 % of the control. We conclude that drug monitoring in <b>test</b> <b>group</b> in Chaharmahal province is relatively acceptable. It is possible that lower rate of epileptic attacks in <b>test</b> <b>group</b> is due to more attention of physicians to them.

Assessments were carried out pre-treatment, 2 and 8 weeks after finishing the treatment. Results: A statistically significant difference (p < 0. 05) was detected for both groups with respect to pain reduction at rest and with mastication, but the DDN <b>test</b> <b>group</b> had significantly better levels of pain reduction. Moreover, statistically significant differences (p < 0. 05) up to day 70 in the <b>test</b> <b>group</b> were seen with respect to maximum mouth opening, laterality and protrusion movements compared with pre-treatment values.

40|$|Objectives: Advancements in women’s {{reproductive}} {{technology have}} resulted in women having to face the decision whether to undergo prenatal testing (PNT). This study explored the factors involved in women’s decisions around PNT and assessed {{the extent to which}} the decision making process differed between women that chose not to have PNT and those that chose to have PNT. The Self-Determination Theory (Deci & Ryan, 1985) was used as the theoretical framework. Study Methods: 30 pregnant or recently pregnant women over the age of 35 participated in semi-structured interviews and completed a brief survey. Content analyses were completed on the interview transcripts, and correlational analyses were performed on the survey data. Results: Women’s personal values, feelings of social support, and perceived competence played major roles in the decision process. Some women in this study indicated the PNT choice gave them a feeling of control and offered feelings of reassurance, while some said having to make the choice was a burden that they found difficult to bear. Women in the <b>testing</b> <b>group</b> appeared to place a great importance on the need for information, while women in the no <b>testing</b> <b>group</b> placed greater importance on the need for social support. Each <b>testing</b> <b>group</b> also appeared to differ in facets of their personal values, such as religiosity (only women in the no <b>testing</b> <b>group</b> discussed this issue) and need for a sense of control (only women in the <b>testing</b> <b>group</b> discussed this issue). The women in the no <b>testing</b> <b>group</b> showed higher levels of uncertainty and decisional conflict, and lower levels of decisional self-efficacy than women in the <b>testing</b> <b>group.</b> Conclusions: Each <b>testing</b> <b>group</b> appears to be individual in their needs during PNT decision making. The study findings suggest women should be counseled differently depending on their supports, values, and need for knowledge regarding testing. The findings suggest that women opting against PNT experience elevated decisional distress, and perceive themselves to be less competent and more conflicted over the decision than women choosing PNT. Special attention to these women during the PNT decision may improve their feelings of being socially supported during the decision...|$|R
