40|$|The {{impact of}} the {{international}} forests regime (IFR) in shaping national forest-related policies (FRPs) is often considered {{as one of the}} key indicators of its effectiveness. This study is based on a comparison of the evolution {{over the past three decades}} of FRPs and <b>the</b> <b>IFR’s</b> impact in Brazil and Indonesia – the two top-ranking countries in deforestation fi gures – and draws two conclusions. First, far from acting as a mere source of resistance to <b>the</b> <b>IFR,</b> <b>the</b> domestic policy context determines both the extent and type of impact of <b>the</b> <b>IFR</b> on FRPs. Secondly, FRPs also infl uence <b>the</b> <b>IFR,</b> which contradicts <b>the</b> top-down vision put forward by attempts to evaluate <b>the</b> <b>IFR’s</b> effectiveness.
