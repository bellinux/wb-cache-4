40|$|Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) is an autosomal, dominantly {{inherited}} neurodegenerative disorder <b>of</b> adult onset. <b>The</b> prevalence <b>of</b> MJD {{reaches its}} highest values in <b>the</b> islands <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Azores. A research program was undertaken {{to study the}} origin and spread <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mutant gene in the Azorean populations. Here, we present <b>the</b> first results <b>of</b> such a study. The Azorean MJD patients are grouped in 34 families and are distributed on 4 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 9 Azore islands. Values of prevalence, carrier rate, and number of individuals at risk are reported. <b>The</b> genealogies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> patients were reconstructed to identify the founders. An analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> geographic distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>birthplaces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> patients compared with <b>the</b> <b>birthplaces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> founders revealed <b>the</b> existence <b>of</b> areas that are clusters for both, thus defining crucial sites for <b>the</b> origin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disease. Preliminary results on <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> links between <b>the</b> affected families show that 64. 7 % of them {{have at least one}} link with another MJD family.

The bar has been restored to its original appearance, with rich wood panelling and leather upholstery and has 25 original photographs on the walls taken by the author of places and people that inspired him.|$|E
