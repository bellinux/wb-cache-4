5|$|As he {{indicated}} in the title, Kepler thought he had revealed God's geometrical plan for the universe. Much of Kepler's enthusiasm for the Copernican system stemmed from his theological convictions about {{the connection between the}} physical and the spiritual; the universe itself was an image of God, with the Sun corresponding to the Father, the stellar sphere <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Son,</b> and the intervening space between to the Holy Spirit. His first manuscript of Mysterium contained an extensive chapter reconciling heliocentrism with biblical passages that seemed to support geocentrism.|$|E

5|$|While it {{was officially}} Drusus {{who was the}} heir to Tiberius, in practice, it was the Praetorian prefect Sejanus who was the second man in the empire. As early as AD 20, Sejanus had sought to {{strengthen}} his ties to the imperial family by betrothing his daughter Junilla <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>son</b> of Claudius, Claudius Drusus. At the time the girl was only 4 years old but the marriage was prevented when the boy accidentally died {{a few days later}} of asphyxiation.

To achieve this goal without the knowledge of Gundamma, he spoils every marriage proposal Saroja receives. Saroja's arrogance and Lakshmi's courteous attitude indirectly help Ghantaiah. Gundamma decides to marry off Lakshmi to a vagabond and Saroja <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>son</b> of Ramabhadraiah, a wealthy man living in a faraway town.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{accession}} of Tiberius, Drusus {{had been}} systematically groomed as the successor of his father, successfully commanding legions in Illyricum in AD 18, and sharing the consulship with Tiberius in AD 21. In practice {{it was still}} Sejanus who was the second man in the empire and he was ambitious to further expand his power. As early as AD 20, Sejanus had sought to solidify his connection with the imperial family, by betrothing his daughter Junilla <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>son</b> of Claudius, Claudius Drusus.

5|$|The dating of Bogdan's {{departure}} from Maramureș is uncertain. His estates there were confiscated and granted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>son</b> of Sas, Balc, {{according to a}} royal diploma, issued on 2 February 1365. Consequently, Bogdan must have come to Moldavia before that date. Historian Pál Engel dates Bogdan's arrival as 1359, {{taking advantage of the}} power vacuum that followed the death of Berdi Beg, Khan of the Golden Horde. According to Carciumaru, a lasting conflict between King Louis I of Hungary and Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor and the Lithuanians' victory over the Tatars in the Battle of Blue Waters in the early 1360s, enabled Bogdan to come to Moldavia and expel Balc in 1363. Sălăgean says that it was only in 1365 that Bogdan seized power in Moldavia with the assistance of local Vlachs.|$|E
