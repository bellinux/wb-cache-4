5|$|Gray was {{a leading}} {{opponent}} of the Scientific Lazzaroni, a group of mostly physical scientists who wanted American academia to mimic the autocratic academic structures of European universities. A {{large percentage of the}} original 50 members of the National Academy of Sciences were Lazzaroni members. The American Academy of Arts and Sciences was opposed to the National Academy and collectively elected Gray and his friend, colleague, and fellow Charles Darwin supporter William Barton Rogers to the National Academy. Rogers founded the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. This is one of the areas where Gray and his friend and colleague, Louis Agassiz, were in disagreement; Agassiz {{was a member of the}} Lazzaroni group. Agassiz had come to lecture at the Lowell Institute in 1846 and got hired by Harvard in 1847. Gray befriended him <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been befriended during his trip to Europe.|$|E
5|$|Minton did {{not realize}} that Frank was also {{president}} of the University of Wisconsin, and soon suffered retaliation for <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> treated Frank. Frank went on NBC radio stations around the country and lambasted Minton for his rudeness. He made lengthy arguments accusing Minton of attempting to violate the Bill of Rights. Minton was outraged, but the arguments had an effect among voters in Indiana. In 1938, he sought funding to launch a massive nationwide investigation of media conglomerates for proof of Republican interference in the press. Democratic Senator Edward R. Burke led an effort to defeat the measure and privately accused Minton of damaging the Democrats' cause, which led Minton to leave the Lobby Investigation Committee.|$|E
5|$|Rousseau was {{enthusiastic}} and sent his cycling editor, Victor Breyer, {{to find a}} route. Breyer travelled to Amiens in a Panhard driven by his colleague, Paul Meyan. The following morning Breyer— later deputy organiser of the Tour de France and a leading official of the Union Cycliste Internationale - continued by bike. The wind blew, the rain fell and the temperature dropped. Breyer reached Roubaix filthy and exhausted {{after a day of}} riding on cobbles (setts). He swore he would send a telegram to Minart urging him to drop the idea, saying it was dangerous to send a race <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> just ridden. But that evening a meal and drinks with the team from Roubaix changed his mind.|$|E

5|$|Sagan {{revealed}} {{that he had been}} told on the radio that he had to ride hard {{to stay away from the}} chasing group, but that he had no power left in the final part of the race as he had done the majority of the work in the breakaway. Nevertheless, he said that he was happy with the race. Cancellara, meanwhile, said that, although he was disappointed with the result in itself, he had pride in <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> performed in coming back from his mechanical failure. After his long pursuit, with the help of several teammates in different groups, he had barely been able to follow the other riders in the group on the Tiegemberg.|$|E
5|$|When {{the camp}} opened, Butlin {{realised}} that his guests were not engaging with activities in <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> envisioned, as most kept to themselves, and others looked bored. He asked Norman Bradford (who was engaged {{as an engineer}} constructing the camp) {{to take on the}} duty of entertaining the guests which he did with a series of ice breakers and jokes. By {{the end of the night}} the camp was buzzing and the Butlin's atmosphere was born. From that point on, entertainment was at the very heart of Butlin's and Bradford became the first of the Butlin's Redcoats. That night Butlin decided that for his camp to work he would require an army of people to carry out the same job as Bradford, and the role of Redcoat was formed.|$|E
5|$|He {{opened his}} first Butlin's camp at Ingoldmells, near Skegness, on 11 April 1936 (Easter eve). It was officially opened by Amy Johnson, {{the first woman}} to fly solo from England to Australia. An {{advertisement}} costing £500 (2011:£) was placed in the Daily Express, announced the opening of the camp, inviting the public to book for a week's holiday. The advertisement offered holidays with three meals a day and free entertainment with a week's full board cost anything from 35 shillings to £3 (2011:£), according to the time of year.

The same night Butlin decided that for his camp to work he would require many more people to carry out the same job as Bradford, and the role of Redcoat was conceived.|$|E

5|$|It {{was normal}} in fleet {{actions of the}} 18th century for the two lines of battle to pass one another sedately, exchanging fire at long ranges and then wearing away, often without either side losing a ship or taking an enemy. In contrast, Howe was {{counting}} on the professionalism of his captains and crews combined with {{the advantage of the}} weather gage to attack the French directly, driving through their line. However, this time he did not plan to manoeuvre in <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> during the two previous encounters; each ship following in the wake of that in front to create a new line arrowing through his opponent's force (as Rodney had done at the Battle of the Saintes 12years earlier). Instead, Howe ordered each of his ships to turn individually towards the French line, intending to breach it at every point and rake the French ships at both bow and stern. The British captains would then pull up on the leeward side of their opposite numbers, cutting them off from their retreat downwind, and engage them directly, hopefully forcing each to surrender and consequently destroying the French Atlantic Fleet.|$|E

25|$|In 2001, Selleck {{played the}} lead role of Murray in a Broadway revival of Herb Gardner's comedic play A Thousand Clowns. It ran for only two months. Critics, though far from uniformly {{negative}} about Selleck's performance, generally compared it unfavorably to that of Jason Robards, Jr., who won awards in the 1960s for playing the character {{on the stage and}} in a movie version. (It remains the role with which Robards is most identified.) Playwright Gardner, however, actually preferred Selleck to Robards in the part, and even said that Selleck was <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> always envisioned Murray.|$|E
25|$|In February 1936, {{when the}} first Hall of Fame {{election}} results were announced, Cobb had been named on 222 of 226 ballots, outdistancing Babe Ruth, Honus Wagner, Christy Mathewson and Walter Johnson, the only others to earn the necessary 75% of votes to be elected that first year. His 98.2 percentage stood as the record until Tom Seaver received 98.8% {{of the vote in}} 1992. Those incredible results show that although many people disliked him personally, they respected <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> played and what he had accomplished.

25|$|Following {{his defeat}} at Atlanta, General Hood regrouped his army at Lovejoy's Station, {{following}} which {{they moved to}} Palmetto, Georgia. Here they were reviewed by Confederate President Jefferson Davis, {{who had come to}} speak with Hood about his next move. Even after the disaster at Atlanta, Hood still retained a formidable force of 39,000 men, and though Davis expressed disappointment in <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> fought in Georgia and spoke of relieving him from command, he ultimately decided that Hood would keep his job. Davis did order Lieutenant General Hardee, the 33rd's longtime corps commander, to a new assignment, replacing him with Frank Cheatham. Hoping to draw Sherman away from Atlanta, Hood and Davis decided that the Army of Tennessee would move north toward Chattanooga, seeking to damage Federal supply lines and force Sherman to do battle on terrain favorable to the Confederates.|$|E
25|$|The 2013 home Ashes series marked Cook's first Ashes series as captain. England {{went into}} the series as strong favourites, with Australia {{recently}} having parted company with their coach. England won the first Test, with Cook making 50 in England's second innings to help them set Australia a competitive target to win the game. They were bowled out for 296, meaning England won the match by 14 runs. Although Cook only managed 20 runs in the next match, England cruised to victory, winning by 347 runs. The third match ended in a draw, with Cook scoring 62 in the first innings, but being dismissed for a duck in the second. The fourth Test saw England win the series after winning the match and taking a 3–0 series lead. The final match ended in a draw, with Cook failing to pass fifty in either of his innings. Despite this, Cook was generally praised for <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> led the side. In the ODI series, Cook and Flower decided to rest several of England's Test players to ensure they were fit for the series in Australia. Cook himself played no part in the series, being replaced in the side by Michael Carberry.|$|E
