He advocates generalisation over specialisation, and insists that the notion of being literate must encompass knowledge of both arts and sciences. Steiner believes that nationalism is too inherently violent to satisfy the moral prerogative of Judaism, saying [...] "that because of what we are, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> can't do." ...|$|E

[...] Poet Carl Sandburg wrote, [...] "We have learned {{to be a little}} sad and a little lonesome without being sickly about it.

She, too, had passed the night wakefuly, no doubt; but neither asked the other how the hours had been spent. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> divine without speaking, and know though they happen out of our sight.

It seems {{right to}} me {{sometimes}} that we should follow our strongest feeling; but then, such feelings continually come across the ties that all our former life has made for us,--the ties that have made others dependent on us,--and would cut them in two. If life were quite easy and simple, {{as it might have}} been in Paradise, and we could always see that one being first toward whom--I mean, if life did not make duties for us before love comes, love would be a sign that two people ought to belong to each other. But I see--I feel it is not so now; <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> must renounce in life; some of us must resign love. Many things are difficult and dark to me; but I see one thing quite clearly,--that I must not, cannot, seek my own happiness by sacrificing others. Love is natural; but surely pity and faithfulness and memory are natural too. And they would live in me still, and punish me if I did not obey them. I should be haunted by the suffering I had caused. Our love would be poisoned. Don't urge me; help me,--help me, because I love you." ...|$|E
60|$|We {{must pass}} over {{a part of}} Mrs. Rebecca Crawley's {{biography}} with that lightness and delicacy which the world demands--the moral world, that has, perhaps, no particular objection to vice, but an insuperable repugnance to hearing vice called by its proper name. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> do and know perfectly well in Vanity Fair, though we never speak of them: as the Ahrimanians worship the devil, but don't mention him: and a polite public will no more bear to read an authentic description of vice than a truly refined English or American female will permit the word breeches to be pronounced in her chaste hearing. And yet, madam, both are walking the world before our faces every day, without much shocking us. If you were to blush every time they went by, what complexions you would have! It is only when their naughty names are called out that your modesty has any occasion to show alarm or sense of outrage, {{and it has been}} the wish of the present writer, all through this story, deferentially to submit to the fashion at present prevailing, and only to hint at the existence of wickedness in a light, easy, and agreeable manner, so that nobody's fine feelings may be offended. I defy any one to say that our Becky, who has certainly some vices, has not been presented to the public in a perfectly genteel and inoffensive manner. In describing this Siren, singing and smiling, coaxing and cajoling, the author, with modest pride, asks his readers all round, has he once forgotten the laws of politeness, and showed the monster's hideous tail above water? No! Those who like may peep down under waves that are pretty transparent and see it writhing and twirling, diabolically hideous and slimy, flapping amongst bones, or curling round corpses; but above the waterline, I ask, has not everything been proper, agreeable, and decorous, and has any the most squeamish immoralist in Vanity Fair a right to cry fie? When, however, the Siren disappears and dives below, down among the dead men, the water of course grows turbid over her, and it is labour lost to look into it ever so curiously. They look pretty enough when they sit upon a rock, twanging their harps and combing their hair, and sing, and beckon to you to come and hold the looking-glass; but when they sink into their native element, depend on it, those mermaids are about no good, and we had best not examine the fiendish marine cannibals, revelling and feasting on their wretched pickled victims. And so, when Becky is out of the way, be sure that she is not particularly well employed, and that the less that is said about her doings is in fact the better.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Brook showed {{for this}} not perhaps an irritation, but {{a flicker of}} austerity. [...] "You must {{remember}} we've a great many things to think about. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> must take for granted in each other--we must all help in our way to pull the coach. That's what I mean by worry, and if you don't have any {{so much the better}} for you. For me it's in the day's work. Your father and I have most to think about always at this time, as you perfectly know--when we have to turn things round and manage somehow or other to get out of town, have to provide and pinch, to meet all the necessities, with money, money, money at every turn running away like water. The children this year seem to fit into nothing, into nowhere, and Harold's more dreadful than he has ever been, doing nothing at all for himself and requiring everything to be done for him. He talks about his American girl, with millions, who's so awfully taken with him, but I can't find out anything about her: the only one, just now, that people seem to have heard of is the one Booby Manger's engaged to. The Mangers literally snap up everything," [...] Mrs. Brook quite wailingly now continued: [...] "the Jew man, so gigantically rich--who is he? Baron Schack or Schmack--who has just taken Cumberland House and who has the awful stammer--or what is it? no roof to his mouth--is to give that horrid little Algie, to do his conversation for him, four hundred a year, which Harold pretended to me that, of all the rush of young men--dozens!--HE was most in the running for. Your father's settled gloom is terrible, and I bear all the brunt of it; we get literally nothing this year for the Hovel, yet have to spend on it heaven knows what; and everybody, for the next three months, in Scotland and everywhere, has asked us for the wrong time and nobody for the right: so that I assure you I don't know where to turn--which doesn't however in the least prevent every one coming to me with their own selfish troubles." [...] It was as if Mrs. Brook had found the cup of her secret sorrows suddenly jostled by some touch of which the perversity, though not completely noted at the moment, proved, as she a little let herself go, sufficient to make it flow over; but she drew, the next thing, from her daughter's stillness a reflexion of the vanity of such heat and speedily recovered herself as if in order with more dignity to point the moral. [...] "I can carry my burden and shall do so to the end; but we must each remember that we shall fall to pieces if we don't manage to keep hold of some little idea of responsibility. I positively can't arrange without knowing when it is you go to him." ...|$|E

5000|$|While Burke {{struggles with}} {{using the word}} {{inventor}} for he feels that language has invented man, {{he points out that}} negatives do not exist in nature.

He further refers to morality as being particularly human and based largely on the idea of negatives; that is, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> should not do. [...] Intrinsic to this portion of Burke's Definition is the idea of paradox. Burke explains that the idea of negation is, by its nature, paradoxical. He explains that conditioning a statement with a negative draws a positive image of that very statement. This, he argues, defeats the purpose of negation, yet is an inescapable situation.|$|E

THE ORGAN BROKER, a novel about a black market organ broker, will be released by the Arcade Imprint of Skyhorse Publishing in May 2015. While {{the book is a}} novel, the author has developed a secondary agenda of advocating for those in need of organ donations. In the Salon.com article, published in march of 2013, he said, “The tragic aspect of this particular shortage is that there are plenty of organs and <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> can do."
