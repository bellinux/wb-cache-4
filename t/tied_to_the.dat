40|$|In many {{countries}} governments not only regulate business activities, but also {{become involved in}} the corporate governance of individual firms through ownership and board ties. While existing studies usually focus either on benefits of political connections or on costs of government influence, a political embeddedness perspective helps us consider both advantages and constraints associated with <b>ties</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> government. In particular, firms with direct <b>ties</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> government will experience significant costs associated with government officials' involvement in the corporate governance process. In contrast, firms with <b>ties</b> <b>to</b> state-owned enterprises (SOEs) are connected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> government indirectly and thus, while getting access to state-owned resources, avoid costs associated with the government's interventions. This study compares the performance consequences of board and ownership <b>ties</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> government with the consequences of board and ownership <b>ties</b> <b>to</b> SOEs. I find that <b>ties</b> <b>to</b> SOEs are associated with higher profitability, while no significant differences are discovered for firms with direct <b>ties</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> government.
