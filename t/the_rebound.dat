5|$|Considerable debate exists {{about the}} size of <b>the</b> <b>rebound</b> in energy {{efficiency}} and the relevance of the Jevons paradox to energy conservation. Some dismiss the paradox, while others worry that it may be self-defeating to pursue sustainability by increasing energy efficiency. Environmental economists have proposed that efficiency gains be coupled with conservation policies that keep the cost of use the same (or higher) to avoid the Jevons paradox. Conservation policies (such as cap and trade) do not display the paradox, and can be used to control <b>the</b> <b>rebound</b> effect.|$|E

Barcelona goalkeeper Marc-André ter Stegen blocked the shot from Tevez, but Álvaro Morata equalised by putting <b>the</b> <b>rebound</b> into the net. In the 67th minute, Juventus appealed for a penalty when Paul Pogba {{went down in the}} area when challenged by Dani Alves, but the referee did not give it. Two minutes later, Barcelona got back into the lead when Lionel Messi shot {{from the edge of the}} area, Gianluigi Buffon blocked it and Suárez put in <b>the</b> <b>rebound.</b> Soon after, Neymar put the ball into the net from Alba's cross, but it was disallowed as the referee deemed that Neymar had headed it into his own hand.|$|E
5|$|Economists have {{observed}} that consumers tend to travel more when their cars are more fuel efficient, causing a 'rebound' in the demand for fuel. An increase in the efficiency with which a resource (e.g. fuel) is used, causes {{a decrease in the}} cost of using that resource when measured in terms of what it can achieve (e.g. travel). Generally speaking, a decrease in the cost (or price) of a good or service will increase the quantity demanded (the law of demand). With a lower cost for travel, consumers will travel more, increasing the demand for fuel. This increase in demand is known as <b>the</b> <b>rebound</b> effect, and {{it may or may not}} be large enough to offset the original drop in demand from the increased efficiency. The Jevons paradox occurs when <b>the</b> <b>rebound</b> effect is greater than 100%, exceeding the original efficiency gains.|$|E
5|$|The Tar Heels' {{began to}} strain Kansas' defense with several players making {{perimeter}} shots, and {{when combined with}} Kansas' inability to convert from the field, this allowed the Tar Heels to jump out to a 114 lead. This led to Harp changing Kansas' defensive formation to a 23 zone, with Chamberlain under the basket. Rosenbluth — who was now relatively unguarded when compared to Kansas' previous formation — made a contested seventeen foot jumper. Kansas retaliated by giving the ball to Chamberlain who was subsequently fouled as he went up for a shot. He went to the free throw line and made one of two. As Kansas went up the floor coach Harp ordered his squad to revert to their original boxandone. Carolina's Kearns made a jumper from the floor after pump faking to lose a defender, which brought the score to 157 in favor of Carolina. Kansas came up the floor and missed their shot, but Chamberlain grabbed <b>the</b> <b>rebound</b> and was then fouled in air. He went to the line for a one–and–one and missed the first shot, while Rosenbluth caught <b>the</b> <b>rebound.</b>|$|E

5|$|The size of <b>the</b> <b>rebound</b> {{effect is}} {{determined}} by the price elasticity of demand for the good. In a perfectly competitive market where fuel is the sole input used, if the price of fuel remains constant but efficiency is doubled, the effective price of travel would be halved (twice as much travel can be purchased). If in response, the amount of travel purchased more than doubles (i.e. demand is price elastic), then fuel consumption would increase, and the Jevons paradox would occur. If demand is price inelastic, the amount of travel purchased would less than double, and fuel consumption would decrease. However, goods and services generally use more than one type of input (e.g. fuel, labour, machinery), and other factors besides input cost may also affect price. These factors tend to reduce <b>the</b> <b>rebound</b> effect, making the Jevons paradox less likely to occur.|$|E
5|$|A {{minute after}} this, Liverpool scored through captain Gerrard, who {{connected}} with Riise's cross and lofted a header past Dida. Soon afterwards, Liverpool scored again as Šmicer beat Dida with a long-range {{shot into the}} bottom left-hand corner to leave Liverpool a goal behind. Three minutes after Šmicer's goal, Liverpool were awarded a penalty, after Gerrard made a run into the Milan box for Baros' lay-off and was brought down by Gennaro Gattuso. Xabi Alonso's penalty was saved, but he scored from <b>the</b> <b>rebound</b> to equalise for Liverpool.

5|$|North Carolina's first {{possession}} of the second overtime period ended with a turnover, while Kansas missed a long jump shot in theirs. North Carolina's Brennan boxed out Chamberlain who went over Brennan to collect <b>the</b> <b>rebound</b> and was called for over the back. Joe Quigg turned the ball over after traveling, while Chamberlain threw {{the ball out of}} bounds on the subsequent possession. Carolina failed to capitalize on Chamberlain's error when Kearns missed the front end of a one–and–one. Kansas came down the court and passed the ball to Chamberlain who was then fouled hard by Cunningham. This sparked an altercation between the two teams, which resulted in Chamberlain being hit in the stomach with a megaphone and his knee being scarred by a Carolina cheerleader. The referees stopped the commotion and Chamberlain was sent to the line, where he missed his shots, and Carolina got <b>the</b> <b>rebound.</b> The Tar Heels aimed to hold the ball for a final shot but they turned the ball over to Kansas with ten seconds to go and the Jayhawks called a timeout with six seconds left. The ball went to Kansas' Loneski who missed a shot and the game remained tied at 48.|$|E

However, North Carolina was unable to stop Kansas during the ensuing drive as Chamberlain scored a basket to bring the score to 4848. After Kansas score the tying basket, North Carolina {{proceeded}} to hold the ball for one final shot before time ran out. Carolina's Kearns drove and put up a shot that was blocked by Chamberlain as time ran out.|$|E

5|$|As {{the players}} took {{the field for}} the second half, D.C. coach Tom Soehn decided to replace Fred, who had been a non-factor in the first half, with Santino Quaranta. In the 60th minute, Gomez, Pontius and Luciano Emilio {{combined}} inside Seattle's 18-yard box for a United opportunity, but Pontius mishit the shot, which resulted in an easy save for Seattle's goalkeeper, Kasey Keller. Seven minutes later, another failed D.C. United opportunity resulted in a Sounders FC counterattack, where Freddie Ljungberg's shot was saved by Wicks. <b>The</b> <b>rebound</b> rolled in front of Fredy Montero, who dove feet first and kicked the ball into the goal, giving Sounders FC a 1–0 lead. Following the goal, frustrated D.C. United goalkeeper Josh Wicks stomped on Montero's leg while he was still on the ground. After consulting with the fourth official, referee Alex Prus showed Wicks a red card for his behavior, dismissing him from the match. United's backup goalkeeper, Milos Kocic, was substituted for Christian Gomez after the incident, and D.C. played with 10 men {{for the remainder of the}} match.|$|E
5|$|Both teams {{started with}} attacking play, with Brazilian Marcelo's shot going wide {{in the third}} minute and German Sami Khedira's shot in the seventh minute being {{inadvertently}} blocked by his teammate Toni Kroos.

Thomas Müller escaped his marker, David Luiz, in the penalty box, and Toni Kroos's delivery found him wide open for a side-footed shot into the net. In the following minutes Brazil tried to respond but their attacks came to nothing; although Philipp Lahm needed to deliver a brilliant tackle to keep Marcelo from setting up a chance in the penalty box. Instead, in the 23rd minute, Germany scored again after Kroos and Müller combined to set up Miroslav Klose, who scored on <b>the</b> <b>rebound</b> after his initial shot was saved by goalkeeper Júlio César.

500|$|In basketball, a <b>rebound</b> is <b>the</b> act {{of gaining}} {{possession}} of the ball after a missed field goal or free throw. An offensive rebound occurs when a player recovers the ball after their own or a teammate's missed shot attempt, while a defensive rebound occurs when a player recovers the ball after an opponent's missed shot attempt. The National Basketball Association's (NBA) rebounding title is awarded to the player with <b>the</b> highest <b>rebounds</b> per game average in a given season. It was first recognized in the 1950–51 season, which was the second season after the league was created in 1949 by merger of the 3-year-old BAA and 12-year-old NBL. Players who earned <b>rebounding</b> titles before <b>the</b> 1973–74 season did not record any offensive or defensive rebounds because statistics on them were not recorded before that season.
