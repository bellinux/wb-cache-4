5|$|In modern history, orators such as Henry Clay would mimic Demosthenes's technique. His {{ideas and}} {{principles}} survived, influencing prominent politicians and movements of our times.

French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau was among those who idealised Demosthenes and wrote a book about him.

5|$|The {{church is}} built in red {{sandstone}} with a lead roof. The tower {{is within the}} body of the church with arches leading into the nave and the side aisles. These arches, together with the thin lancet windows and the flat buttresses, date from the 13thcentury. <b>The</b> <b>authors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Buildings of England series state that this early date is rare for towers in Cheshire. The upper parts of the tower, built after the collapse of 1757, are by William Baker in early Gothic Revival style. The nave has four bays, with north and south aisles of six bays. The chancel has three bays with a vestry on its north side. The piers of the arcade date from the 13thcentury while the capitals are from the 19th-century restoration. <b>The</b> <b>authors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Buildings of England series state that {{the body of the}} church is mostly Perpendicular in style. At the east end of the north aisle is the Mainwaring chapel, which was originally a Lady Chapel; at {{the north side of the}} tower is the Dorfold chantry.

5|$|The {{extremely}} nested pseudonymity of {{this work}} adds a problem of interpretation. A and B are <b>the</b> <b>authors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> work, Eremita is the editor. Kierkegaard's role in all {{this appears to be}} that he deliberately sought to disconnect himself from the points of view expressed in his works, although the absurdity of his pseudonyms' bizarre Latin names proves that he did not hope to thoroughly conceal his identity from the reader. Kierkegaard's Papers first edition VIII(2), B 81 - 89 explain this method in writing. On interpretation there is also much to be found in The Point of View of My Work as an Author.|$|E
