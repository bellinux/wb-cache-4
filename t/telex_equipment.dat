Booklets were printed and dispatched to all Atoll and Island Offices, as well as schools and merchant liners. This was seen by many as the demise of the Thaana script.|$|E
5000|$|The {{telex network}} is a {{switched}} network of teleprinters {{similar to a}} telephone network, {{for the purposes of}} sending text-based messages. The term refers to the network, not the teleprinters; point-to-point teleprinter systems had been in use long before telex exchanges were formed starting in the 1930s. Teleprinters evolved from telegraph systems, and, like the telegraph, they used {{the presence or absence of}} a pre-defined level of current to represent the mark or space symbols. This is as opposed to the analog telephone system, which used differing voltages to encode frequency information. For this reason, telex exchanges were entirely separate from the telephone system, with their own signalling standards, exchanges and system of [...] "telex numbers" [...] (the counterpart of a telephone number). When telephone and <b>telex</b> exchange <b>equipment</b> was co-located, which was not uncommon, the different signalling systems would sometimes cause interference.|$|R
5000|$|Teletype Corporation, of Skokie, Illinois, made page {{printers}} for text, notably {{for news}} wire services and telegrams, but these used standards {{different from those}} for deaf communication, and although in quite widespread use, were technically incompatible. Furthermore, these were sometimes referred to by the [...] "TTY" [...] initialism, short for [...] "Teletype". When computers had keyboard input mechanisms and page printer output, before CRT terminals came into use, Teletypes were {{the most widely used}} devices. They were called [...] "console typewriters". (<b>Telex</b> used similar <b>equipment,</b> but was a separate international communication network.) ...|$|R
50|$|Telex {{provided}} the first common medium for international record communications using standard signalling techniques and operating criteria as {{specified by the}} International Telecommunication Union. Customers on any telex exchange could deliver messages to any other, around the world. To lower line usage, telex messages were normally first encoded onto paper tape and then read into the line as quickly as possible. The system normally delivered information at 50 baud or approximately 66 words per minute encoded using the International Telegraph Alphabet No. 2. In the late days of the <b>telex</b> networks, end-user <b>equipment</b> was often replaced by modems and phone lines as well, reducing the telex network to what was effectively a directory service running on the phone network.|$|R
50|$|Tāna nearly {{disappeared}} {{for a brief}} period in recent history. Towards the mid-1970s, during President Ibrahim Nasir's tenure, Telex machines were introduced by the Maldivian Government in the local administration. The new <b>telex</b> <b>equipment</b> was viewed as a great progress, but Tāna was deemed to be an obstacle because messages on the telex machines could only be written in the Latin script. Following this, a rough Latin transliteration for Maldivian was officially approved by the Maldivian government in 1976 and was quickly implemented by the administration. Booklets were printed and dispatched to all Atoll and Island Offices, as well as schools and merchant liners. This was seen by many as the demise of the Tāna script.|$|E
