25|$|Through-tool coolant systems, {{also known}} as through-spindle coolant systems, are systems plumbed to deliver coolant through {{passages}} inside the spindle and through the tool, directly to the cutting interface. Many of these are also high-pressure coolant systems, in which <b>the</b> <b>operating</b> <b>pressure</b> can be hundreds to several thousand psi (1to30MPa)—pressures comparable to those used in hydraulic circuits. High-pressure through-spindle coolant systems require rotary unions that can withstand these pressures. Drill bits and endmills tailored for this use have small holes at the lips where the coolant shoots out. Various types of gun drills also use similar arrangements.|$|E

Therefore, {{to reduce the risk of}} failure and the cumulative effects of load, the vessels were maintained at 80 percent of <b>the</b> <b>operating</b> <b>pressure</b> as late in the launch countdown as possible, and the launch pad was cleared of all but essential personnel when pressure was increased to 100 percent. The new launch procedure was employed during some the remaining launches of Atlantis, but was resolved when the two COPVs deemed to have the highest risk of failure were replaced.|$|E

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to deal with the {{analysis}} of the performance of twin thermoacoustic prime mover (TAPM) which are measured in terms of frequency and pressure amplitude by varying the parameters such as temperature gradient along the length of stack and <b>the</b> <b>operating</b> <b>pressures</b> of fluid medium argon using CFD simulation. With the help of CFD researchers and engineers can evaluate the performance of a wide range of thermoacoustic systems on the computer without the time, expense, and disruption required to make actual changes onsite (stack) which is tedious to fabricate. Design/methodology/approach - For the present simulation, <b>the</b> <b>operating</b> <b>pressures</b> of argon such as 1, 3, and 5 bar, and the temperature gradient is varied from 600 to 1, 400 K with the regular intervals of each 200 K. The geometry of twin TAPM is created using GAMBIT processor, and the simulation is carried out using FLUENT. The geometrical parameters of twin TAPM are kept constant throughout the simulation. The results for frequency and pressure amplitude obtained from the CFD simulation of twin TAPM for various temperature gradient and <b>operating</b> <b>pressures</b> are analyzed and reported. Findings - The computational results of twin TAPM shows an increase in pressure amplitude with an increase in the temperature gradient and also it increases with an increase in <b>operating</b> <b>pressures</b> of <b>the</b> fluid medium. <b>The</b> parameter <b>operating</b> <b>pressures</b> of <b>the</b> working fluid medium and the stack hot end temperature has no significant effect on the output, frequency. Originality/value - Though several experimental works had been published based on the twin TAPM, an attempt has been made in the present investigation for the first time to estimate the performance of twin TAPM using CFD package (ANSYS-FLUENT) by varying temperature gradient. The temperature gradient and <b>operating</b> <b>pressures</b> were varied and the performance of twin TAPM was measured in terms of frequency and pressure amplitude...|$|R

Research {{results show that}} water application uniformity either increases or slightly decreases as <b>operating</b> <b>pressure</b> head increases in a range when the emission exponent x {{less than or equal}} to 0. 5 in most cases. The water application uniformity decreases as <b>operating</b> <b>pressure</b> head increases in a range when the emission exponent x > 0. 5. <b>The</b> relationship between <b>operating</b> <b>pressure</b> head and average emitter discharge in submain units can be considered as approximately linear for <b>operating</b> <b>pressure</b> heads in a small range (usually between the allowable minimum and maximum <b>operating</b> <b>pressures</b> of <b>the</b> submain units). These results help to estimate the average emitter discharge rate easily in a submain unit for an increased or decreased <b>operating</b> <b>pressure</b> head when one is attempting to manage emitter discharge dynamically according to the requirements of crop root growth for different periods. Generally, a microirrigation system designed to meet the desired uniformity of water application according to <b>the</b> allowable minimum <b>operating</b> <b>pressure</b> head would be better when x {{less than or equal to}} 0. 5 because water application uniformity increases as <b>operating</b> <b>pressure</b> increases if emitter discharges are being managed dynamically. However, a microirrigation system designed to meet the required water application uniformity according to <b>the</b> allowable maximum <b>operating</b> <b>pressure</b> head would be better when x > 0. 5 because, in general, water application uniformity increases as <b>operating</b> <b>pressure</b> decreases...|$|R
