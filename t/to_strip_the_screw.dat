50|$|Screws: Introduced for season 3, {{these devices}} were a {{modification}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> static spike <b>strips.</b> <b>The</b> <b>screws</b> were continually rotating augers placed horizontally {{along the edges}} of the arena floor. <b>The</b> <b>Screws</b> were intended to scrape up a bot, and possibly drag it closer to the Pulverizers due to the corkscrew design. Much like <b>the</b> Spinners, <b>the</b> <b>Screws</b> had a greater effect on the lighter weight classes—although their impact on all weight classes was small. For Season 5, <b>the</b> <b>screws</b> were upgraded with biting 'teeth' to better catch onto robots. Their rotation was also modified so that instead of 'pushing' in one direction, they converged in a corner from opposite directions and created a 'V' that could damage or turn over robots.|$|R

50|$|Security Locks - Peepholes and {{security}} locks {{have to be}} installed. For Tex, it is another delay, as he needs to install a brand-new door after Joe had ripped out the hinges in an earlier group challenge. Dez and Joe have also removed their door in previous challenges. Charmaine and Dez both fail from <b>stripping</b> <b>the</b> <b>screws</b> <b>to</b> their locks, but Charmaine fails while Dez passes their latch. Casey and Joe also pass their latches. As for the peephole, Dez and Tex pass, but the others fail due to damaging the peephole lens with mallets (for Joe and Charmaine) or sledgehammers (in Casey's case). Finally, Tex fails to install his door (and thus does not install his latch at all) after splitting the doorjambs twice while assembling it.|$|R
