5|$|Histamines are {{proteins}} {{associated with}} many allergic reactions. When the UV radiation or light {{comes in contact}} with a person with solar urticaria, histamine is released from mast cells. When this occurs, the permeability of vessels near the area of histamine release is increased. This allows blood fluid to enter the vessels and cause inflammation. Antihistamines suppress <b>the</b> <b>activity</b> of the histamine.|$|E

40|$|The {{effective}} {{learning strategies}} for mathematics topics may {{vary according to}} the topic. For geometry, <b>the</b> <b>activities</b> that are suggested to be implemented are carried out using Van Hieleâs phases of learning geometry. The phases include Information, Guided Orientation, Explicitation, Free Orientation and Integration. The implementation of these phased-based activities is easier and more effective with the presence of dynamic geometry software, especially the Geometerâs Sketchpad (GSP). Therefore, {{the purpose of this article}} is to discuss <b>the</b> <b>activities</b> based on Van Hieleâs phases of learning geometry, using the GSP computer software as a tool. <b>The</b> developed <b>activities</b> were given to eight experts to get their views on <b>the</b> <b>activities.</b> Besides that, 24 pre-services teachers were also given <b>the</b> <b>activities</b> for <b>the</b> purpose of investigation of paedagogical usability of <b>the</b> developed <b>activities.</b> <b>The</b> results showed that <b>the</b> developed <b>activities</b> were well-arranged based on Van Hieleâs phases of learning geometry with the assistance of GSP. The results also showed that <b>the</b> developed <b>activities</b> met <b>the</b> requirements of the pedagogical usability criteria. Since these phase-based activities obtained positive views from experts and pre-services teachers, <b>the</b> <b>activities</b> can be carried out in teaching and learning geometry...|$|R

5|$|Physiological enzyme {{inhibition}} {{can also be}} produced by specific protein inhibitors. This mechanism occurs in the pancreas, which synthesises many digestive precursor enzymes known as zymogens. Many of these are activated by the trypsin protease, so {{it is important to}} inhibit <b>the</b> <b>activity</b> of trypsin in the pancreas to prevent the organ from digesting itself. One way in which <b>the</b> <b>activity</b> of trypsin is controlled is the production of a specific and potent trypsin inhibitor protein in the pancreas. This inhibitor binds tightly to trypsin, preventing the trypsin activity that would otherwise be detrimental to the organ. Although the trypsin inhibitor is a protein, it avoids being hydrolysed as a substrate by the protease by excluding water from trypsin's active site and destabilising the transition state. Other examples of physiological enzyme inhibitor proteins include the barstar inhibitor of the bacterial ribonuclease barnase and the inhibitors of protein phosphatases.|$|E
