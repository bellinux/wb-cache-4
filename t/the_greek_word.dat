5|$|Stichometry {{refers to}} the {{practice}} of counting lines in texts: Ancient Greeks and Romans measured the length of their books in lines, just as modern books are measured in pages. This practice was rediscovered by German and French scholars in the 19th century. Stichos is <b>the</b> <b>Greek</b> <b>word</b> for a 'line' of prose or poetry and the suffix '-metry' is derived from <b>the</b> <b>Greek</b> <b>word</b> for measurement.|$|E

5|$|Early on the {{community}} tried several names, rejecting Albion, All Saints, Lowell, Brooklyn, Addiseville and Winona. The twenty four small lakes that are now within the city limits led Charles Hoag, Minneapolis's first schoolmaster, to suggest Minnehapolis, derived from Minnehaha and mni, the Dakota word for water, and polis, <b>the</b> <b>Greek</b> <b>word</b> for city.|$|E

5|$|Paleontologists Jose Bonaparte and Fernando Novas {{coined the}} name Abelisauridae in 1985 when they {{described}} the eponymous Abelisaurus.

The very common suffix -idae is usually applied to zoological family names and is derived from the Greek suffix -ιδαι/-idai, which indicates a plural noun.|$|E
5|$|Telescopium {{is a minor}} {{constellation}} in {{the southern}} celestial hemisphere, one of twelve named in the 18th century by French astronomer Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille and one of several depicting scientific instruments.

5|$|The {{specific}} epithet, tigris, {{as well as}} {{the common}} name, tiger, come from the Middle English tigre and the Old English tigras (a plural word), both used for the animal. These derive from the Old French tigre, itself a derivative of the Latin word tigris and <b>the</b> <b>Greek</b> <b>word</b> tigris. The original source may have been the Persian tigra meaning pointed or sharp and the Avestan tigrhi meaning an arrow, perhaps referring to the speed with which a tiger launches itself at its prey. It is worth mentioning that Mesopotamia, where the Caspian tiger had occurred, has a river called 'Tigris'.|$|E

5|$|The first {{evidence}} of helium was observed on August 18, 1868, as {{a bright yellow}} line with a wavelength of 587.49 nanometers in the spectrum of the chromosphere of the Sun. The line was detected by French astronomer Jules Janssen during a total solar eclipse in Guntur, India. This line was initially assumed to be sodium. On October 20 of the same year, English astronomer Norman Lockyer observed a yellow line in the solar spectrum, which he named the D3 Fraunhofer line because it was near the known D1 and D2 lines of sodium. He concluded that it was caused by an element in the Sun unknown on Earth. Lockyer and English chemist Edward Frankland named the element with <b>the</b> <b>Greek</b> <b>word</b> for the Sun, ἥλιος (helios).|$|E
5|$|There was a {{movement}} {{in the late nineteenth}} century to interpret all the Boeotian heroes as merely personifications of the constellations; there has since come to be wide agreement that the myth of Orion existed before there was a constellation named for him. Homer, for example, mentions Orion, the Hunter, and Orion, the constellation, but never confuses the two. Once Orion was recognized as a constellation, astronomy in turn affected the myth. The story of Side may well be a piece of astronomical mythology. <b>The</b> <b>Greek</b> <b>word</b> side means pomegranate, which bears fruit while Orion, the constellation, can be seen in the night sky. Rose suggests she is connected with Sidae in Boeotia, and that the pomegranate, as a sign of the Underworld, is connected with her descent there.|$|E
5|$|From <b>the</b> <b>Greek</b> <b>word</b> for pan pipes, σύριγξ, it is {{the vocal}} organ of birds. Located {{at the base of}} a bird's trachea, it {{produces}} sounds without the vocal folds of mammals. The sound is produced by vibrations of some or all of the membrana tympaniformis (the walls of the syrinx) and the pessulus, caused by air flowing through the syrinx. This sets up a self-oscillating system that modulates the airflow creating the sound. The muscles modulate the sound shape by changing the tension of the membranes and the bronchial openings. The syrinx enables some species of birds (such as parrots, crows, and mynas) to mimic human speech. Unlike the larynx of mammals, the syrinx is located where the trachea forks into the lungs. Thus, lateralization of bird song is possible and some songbirds can produce more than one sound at a time.|$|E

25|$|The placing of {{the nails}} in the hands, or the wrists is also uncertain. Some {{theories}} suggest that <b>the</b> <b>Greek</b> <b>word</b> cheir (χειρ) for hand includes {{the wrist and}} that the Romans were generally trained to place nails through Destot's space (between the capitate and lunate bones) without fracturing any bones. Another theory suggests that <b>the</b> <b>Greek</b> <b>word</b> for hand also includes the forearm and that the nails were placed near the radius and ulna of the forearm. Ropes may have also been used to fasten the hands {{in addition to the}} use of nails.|$|E
25|$|The term hybodont {{comes from}} <b>the</b> <b>Greek</b> <b>word</b> ὕβος or ὑβός meaning hump or hump-backed and ὀδούς, ὀδοντ meaning tooth. This name was given {{based on their}} conical {{compressed}} teeth.|$|E
