50|$|The Montana flume omits the <b>throat</b> and {{discharge}} <b>sections</b> of the Parshall.

40|$|Rocket {{thrusters}} for Rocket Based Combined Cycle (RBCC) engines typically {{operate with}} hydrogen/oxygen propellants {{in a very}} compact space. Packaging considerations lead to designs with either axisymmetric or two-dimensional <b>throat</b> <b>sections.</b> Nozzles tend to be either two- or three-dimensional. Heat transfer characteristics, particularly in the throat, where the peak heat flux occurs, are not well understood. Heat transfer predictions for these small thrusters have been made with one-dimensional analysis such as the Bartz equation or scaling of test data from much larger thrusters. The current work addresses this issue with an experimental program that examines the heat transfer characteristics of a gaseous oxygen (GO 2) /gaseous hydrogen (GH 2) two-dimensional compact rocket thruster. The experiments involved measuring the axial wall temperature profile in the nozzle region of a water-cooled gaseous oxygen/gaseous hydrogen rocket thruster at a pressure of 3. 45 MPa.

40|$|A {{study of}} heat {{transfer}} {{in the art}} chamber and converging section of the nozzle of a "hotshot" wind tunnel was conducted {{to determine the effects}} of heat transfer on the performance of this type of wind tunnel at initial are- chamber pressures from 100 to 6800 atm and temperatures from 4000 to 14, 000 deg K. Radiation from the hot gas was found to be governed by black-body emission laws for pressures above 100 atm at the temperatures considered. Convection to the throat was evaluated, and it was found that a method developed by Sibulkin for turbulent heat transfer at nozzle-throats gives the best estimate of convective heat transfer. Tungsten, copper, and beryllium <b>throat</b> <b>sections</b> were considered. Preliminary evaluations of these materials indicated that tungsten would be the most durable, followed by copper and beryllium in order of relative durability. The thermal response of tungsten throats with diameters of 0. 02, 0. 10, and 0. 30 inch was evaluated, assuming steady flow at the throat for the entire range of are-chamber conditions. The time for a 10 % loss of are-chamber enthalpy was estimated using approximate integrals of the mass-balance and energybalance equations for the are chamber. The results of this investigation show that the time available for steady testsection flow in the "hotshot" wind tunnel is governed by melting of the nozzle throat at initial are-chamber pressures approaching 6800 atin. At pressures near 100 atm, radiation to the are- chamber walls limits the time for steady test-section flow. Transpiration cooling of the tbroat was found to increase the time to melt the throat. Cooling by injection through slots has a smaller effect than distributed transpiration, but is probably not limited by the empirical stability criterion. However, the possible benefits attainable by slot cooling are cancelled by the effects of radiation to the are-chamber walls. The maxirnum time to melt the nozzle throat was found to be limited by gaseous radiation. At pressures approaching 100 atm it was found that the time for steady flow in the test section is governed by radiation to the walls of the are chamber. Film cooling was found to be of negligible benefit as a means of reducing radiative heat transfer. (auth...|$|R

40|$|AbstractNozzle {{effects on}} thrust and inlet {{pressure}} of a multi-cycle air-breathing pulse detonation engine (APDE) are investigated experimentally. An APDE with 68 mm {{in diameter and}} 2 050 mm in length is operated using gasoline/air mixture. Straight nozzle, converging nozzle, converging-diverging nozzle and diverging nozzle are tested. The results show that thrust augmentation of converging-diverging nozzle, diverging nozzle or straight nozzle is better than that of converging nozzle on the whole. Thrust augmentation of straight nozzle is worse than those of converging-diverging nozzle and diverging nozzle. Thrust augmentations of diverging nozzle with larger expansion ratio and converging-diverging nozzle with larger throat area range from 20 % to 40 % on tested frequencies and are better than those of congeneric other nozzles respectively. Nozzle effects on inlet pressure are also researched. At each frequency it is indicated that filling pressures and average peak pressures of inlet with diverging nozzle and converging-diverging nozzle with large <b>throat</b> cross <b>section</b> area are higher than those with straight nozzle and converging nozzle.

Pore scale microstructure in this model is captured through simple power functions of Beti's influence lines that fix both the location and the size of <b>throat</b> (the narrowest <b>section</b> of bond) by relating the important elements of microstructure such as coordination number, porebody sizes and pore wall curvature. The new element in pore-network architecture is thus, the location of throat, which is important for smooth hydraulic transitions during steady state flow conditions. Despite the reduced number of parameters in comparison with other pore-network models, the morphological characteristics of HYPON compare well to those of the process-based predictive models in literature, and these characteristics are sensitise to the variance of porebody sizes rather than to the used type of the porebody size distributions. Processes such as diagenesis and dissolution are captured implicitly through the pore wall curvature parameter. Different combinations of porosity and permeability relations are obtained if the bond curvature and porebody sizes are varied. These relations reveal that effects of diagenesis and dissolution on the permeability may be ignored as they are secondary to effects on porosity. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

In the last decades many of researches have been focused to eliminate and minimize the cavitation occurrence in hydraulic machines.

50|$|At {{the other}} extreme, some high bypass ratio civil turbofans control the fan working line {{by using a}} convergent-divergent nozzle with an {{extremely}} low (less than 1.01) area ratio on the bypass (or mixed exhaust) stream. At low airspeeds, such a setup causes the nozzle {{to act as if}} it had variable geometry by preventing it from choking and allowing it to accelerate and decelerate exhaust gas approaching the <b>throat</b> and divergent <b>section,</b> respectively. Consequently, the nozzle exit area controls the fan match, which, being larger than the throat, pulls the fan working line slightly away from surge. At higher flight speeds, the ram rise in the intake chokes the throat and causes the nozzle's area to dictate the fan match; the nozzle, being smaller than the exit, causes the throat to push the fan working line slightly toward surge. This is not a problem, however, for a fan's surge margin is much greater at high flight speeds.|$|R
50|$|Submerged Flow - {{when the}} water surface {{downstream}} of the flume is high enough to restrict flow through a flume, the flume is deemed to be submerged. Lacking the extended <b>throat</b> and discharge <b>sections</b> of the Parshall flume, the Montana flume has little resistance {{to the effects of}} submergence and as such it should be avoided. Where submerged flow is or may become present, there are several methods of correcting the situation: the flume may be raised above the channel floor, the downstream channel may be modified, or a different flume type may be used (typically a Parshall flume). Although commonly thought of as occurring at higher flow rates, It should be noted that submerged flow can exist at any flow level as it is a function of downstream conditions. In natural stream applications, submerged flow is frequently the result of vegetative growth on the downstream channel banks, sedimentation, or subsidence of the flume.|$|R
