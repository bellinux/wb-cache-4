40|$|The {{physical}} properties of <b>the</b> Polish <b>variety</b> of lentil seed, Tina and <b>the</b> Canadian <b>variety,</b> Laird Lentil (<b>the</b> most popular <b>variety</b> imported into Poland) were compared. The parameters of individual seeds (size distribution, mass per 1000 seeds) and {{the parameters of}} bulk seed (the bulk density, the porosity, the angle of internal friction, the wall friction coefficient and the pressure ratio) of both varieties were compared for the moisture content of the seed within the range 9 to 21 %. The seeds of <b>the</b> Canadian <b>variety</b> {{were found to be}} shapelier than the seeds of <b>the</b> Polish <b>variety.</b> <b>The</b> different swelling characteristics observed between <b>the</b> two <b>varieties</b> {{can be attributed to the}} different anatomical structures of the seed coating /husk/ in <b>the</b> two <b>varieties.</b> <b>The</b> seed coating of <b>the</b> Polish <b>variety</b> is rougher than that of <b>the</b> Canadian <b>variety.</b> Microscope photos of cross-sections of the seeds indicated that the seed coat of <b>the</b> Canadian <b>variety</b> is approximately twice as thin as <b>the</b> Polish <b>variety.</b> <b>The</b> concentration of papillary cells on the surface of the seed coat is higher in the case of <b>the</b> Canadian <b>variety</b> which produces a smoother surface than does <b>the</b> Polish <b>variety.</b> <b>The</b> mechanical properties of bulk seed were similar for both varieties...|$|R
