5|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>force</b> was {{commanded}} by its commissioner, {{there was also}} an influential senior post of comptroller, created in 1880 in response to Macleod's financial mismanagement of <b>the</b> <b>force.</b> For most of the force's history the role was occupied by Frederick White, until replaced by A. A. Mclean in 1913. The comptroller was responsible for keeping account of expenditure, auditing and managing procurement, and effectively removed most of the non-operational functions from the commissioner's responsibility. White was a political client of Prime Minister John Macdonald, who took a close interest in the management of <b>the</b> <b>force,</b> and the post became critical for garnering support from Ottawa for investment in the police.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} the initial value problem for <b>the</b> <b>forced</b> one dimensional nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLS), where <b>the</b> <b>forcing</b> {{is assumed to}} be fast compared to the evolution of the unforced equation. This suggests the introduction of two time scales. Solutions to <b>the</b> <b>forced</b> NLS are sought by expressing the dependent variable in modulus-phase form and expanding in powers of a small parameter, which is inversely related to <b>the</b> <b>forcing</b> time scale. This system is similar to a forced eikonal-transport system arising in nonlinear geometrical optics. We focus on the effect that <b>the</b> <b>forcing</b> has on <b>the</b> NLS standing solitary wave. Solutions to second order in the expansion are computed analytically for some specific choices of <b>the</b> <b>forcing</b> function. A general conclusion of this work is that the effect of <b>the</b> <b>forcing</b> on <b>the</b> phase variable is quite important in determining the overall structure of <b>the</b> <b>forced</b> solitary wave. © 1995 American Institute of Physics...|$|R
5|$|Congolese {{soldiers}} of <b>the</b> <b>Force</b> Publique {{were involved in}} fighting with Italian forces during the East African Campaign and were instrumental to forcing Italian forces out of Abyssinia, suffering 500 casualties. 13,000 Congolese troops served under British command in Nigeria. Detachments of Congolese soldiers also served in the Middle East and Burma. In total, <b>the</b> <b>Force</b> Publique comprised approximately 40,000 men and was racially segregated meaning that blacks could not become officers. Throughout the war, therefore, it was commanded by white officers.|$|E

The popularity of these films finally waned in the 1970s, although this image of <b>the</b> <b>force</b> continued to influence late-20th century television portrayals of the modern Royal Canadian Mounted Police, such as the series Due South which centred on a mounted police constable from the Yukon.|$|E

5|$|Enforcing the {{prohibition}} on liquor began to cause <b>the</b> <b>force</b> increasing problems. The liquor laws {{had been designed}} to prevent the First Nations from drinking alcohol, but their terms also applied to the increasing numbers of white settlers in the late 1880s. Although some temperance groups applauded the measures, most settlers opposed them. Special permits to import alcohol for personal consumption could be granted, but these were not issued impartially, adding to the general resentment. Many members of <b>the</b> <b>force</b> drank alcohol themselves, including liquor confiscated from smugglers, and police beer canteens were established to provide members of <b>the</b> <b>force</b> a legal alternative. Settlers also began to routinely evade the laws in the larger towns, despite mounted police searches, the deployment of undercover officers, and large fines being imposed by the courts. Public hostility towards <b>the</b> <b>force</b> grew and the police soon found themselves almost entirely occupied in attempting to enforce the unpopular laws. Legal changes were pushed through in 1892, removing prohibition and allowing the licensing of public bars; the new law was enforced by local town inspectors, removing most of the force's responsibility for the problem.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Commissioner Perry had {{put forward}} three {{options for the}} future of the mounted police: <b>the</b> <b>force</b> could be absorbed into the Canadian military; the remit of <b>the</b> <b>force</b> could be reduced to simply {{policing}} the far north; or <b>the</b> <b>force</b> could be assigned a much wider role in public and secret policing across the whole of Canada. Perry promoted the third option and Arthur Meighen, the acting Minister for Justice, therefore proposed merging the mounted police and the Dominion Police, placing them under Perry's command. This idea was turned down by Borden, who believed, incorrectly, that the merger would be unacceptable to Perry, whom he thought still wanted a military future for <b>the</b> <b>force.</b>|$|E

5|$|Nonetheless, the force's {{reputation}} {{suffered from}} the controversy and complaints persisted that <b>the</b> <b>force</b> was oversized, excessively funded and staffed by political appointees. By the 1890s, a political consensus had emerged in Ottawa that the western provinces should become autonomous and take up {{responsibility for their own}} policing; it was therefore time to plan for the closure of <b>the</b> <b>force,</b> which originally had only been intended to be a temporary organisation. <b>The</b> <b>force</b> was reduced to 850 men in 1893, and to 750 by 1898. The Conservative government stood for reelection in 1896 with plans to further reduce the size of <b>the</b> <b>force,</b> reportedly to 500 men, but lost to the Liberal party, led by Wilfrid Laurier. The new Prime Minister had stood for election on a platform of increasing the rights of the provinces to carry out law enforcement.
