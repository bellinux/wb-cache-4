5|$|While most LARPs {{maintain}} {{a clear distinction}} between <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>world</b> <b>and</b> the fictional setting, pervasive LARPs mingle fiction with modern reality in a fashion similar to alternate reality games. Bystanders who are unaware that a game is taking place may be treated as part of the fictional setting, and in-character materials may be incorporated into the real world.|$|E
5|$|Battle Network {{was created}} amidst {{the success of}} Nintendo's {{portable}} RPG franchise Pokémon. According to producer Keiji Inafune, the development team wanted Battle Network to identify specifically with younger gamers by creating a setting resembling <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>world</b> <b>and</b> a gameplay model that mixes traditional action and RPG elements. Battle Network received positive reviews from critics. Its unconventional combat system was given significant praise and its presentation was well-regarded. However, its storyline was met with mixed opinions. The game {{was followed by a}} number of sequels and spin-off titles, as well as other media.|$|E
5|$|During a LARP, player {{actions in}} the real world {{represent}} character actions in an imaginary setting. Game rules, physical symbols and theatrical improvisation are used to bridge differences between <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>world</b> <b>and</b> the setting. For example, a rope could signify an imaginary wall. Realistic-looking weapon props and risky physical activity are sometimes discouraged or forbidden for safety reasons. While the fictional timeline in a tabletop RPG often progresses in game-time, which may be much faster or slower than the time passing for players, LARPs are different in that they usually run in real-time, with game-time only being used in special circumstances.|$|E

5|$|The three wake {{up again}} on the TARDIS, no longer in any danger. The Doctor realises both realities were false since the Dream Lord had no power over <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>world</b> <b>and</b> was a manifestation of his darker side. The three were {{influenced}} by psychic pollen that had fallen in the TARDIS time rotor and heated up, creating the Dream Lord and the false realities. Rory comes to realise that Amy killed herself in the Leadworth reality out of love for him, and the two confess their love for each other. The Doctor sees the Dream Lord smile at him through his reflection.|$|E
5|$|Von Neumann {{was asked}} to write an essay for the layman {{describing}} what mathematics is, and produced a beautiful analysis. He explained that mathematics straddles the world between the empirical and logical, arguing that geometry was originally empirical, but Euclid constructed a logical, deductive theory. However, he argued, that {{there is always the}} danger of straying too far from <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>world</b> <b>and</b> becoming irrelevant sophistry.|$|E
5|$|The party's {{activities}} {{alternate between}} events in <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>world</b> <b>and</b> exploration through dungeons in the Idolospheres, each designed around a specific theme. Unlocked by progressing through the story, the party navigates through multiple floors, activating switches and devices to solve puzzles and advance while avoiding traps and encountering or avoiding enemies represented by sprites on the field. The dungeon map is {{displayed on the}} GamePad. Once cleared, dungeons can be replayed at any time. Friendly NPC mirages also act as merchants within dungeons. Battles are triggered when an enemy touches the party touched. The player can attack a Mirage on the field to stun it, allowing them to perform a pre-emptive attack or avoid battle.|$|E

The group find an item called a Dragonstone, which restores some of Tiki's memories. She reveals that she and the other friendly Mirages unsuccessfully attempted to stop the dark mage Gharnef summoning the Shadow Dragon Medeus into their native realm with a ceremony called the Opera of Shadows. Tiki was banished into the Idolasphere, which acted as an intermediate dimension between <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>world</b> <b>and</b> her world, and she was instrumental in preventing Gharnef from performing the Opera of Shadows a second time to enter the real world as his native realm had become drained of artistic energy. His attempt sparked the mass disappearance of five years before, and Tiki shielded both Tsubasa and Yashiro at the cost of her memories.|$|E

Believing that the woman has left without paying the bill, she angrily crumples and throws the woman's comic book into a bin. This makes the hero's two opposing racers reappear, armed with a large pipe wrench. The racers smash the looking glass with the pipe wrench, trapping {{the woman in the}} comic book.

It's then shown that Ashlynn is in the castle, taking care of the newly hatched Zenithian Dragon.|$|E
5|$|The {{environment}} Rowling created {{is intimately}} connected to reality. The British magical {{community of the}} Harry Potter books is inspired by 1990s British culture, European folklore, classical mythology and alchemy, incorporating objects and wildlife such as magic wands, magic plants, potions, spells, flying broomsticks, centaurs, and other magical creatures, the Deathly Hallows, and the Philosopher's Stone, beside others invented by Rowling. While the fantasy land of Narnia is an alternate universe and the Lord of the Rings Middle-earth a mythic past, the wizarding world of Harry Potter exists in parallel within <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>world</b> <b>and</b> contains magical versions of the ordinary elements of everyday life, with the action mostly set in Scotland (Hogwarts), the West Country, Devon, London and Surrey in southeast England. The world only accessible to wizards and magical beings comprises a fragmented collection of overlooked hidden streets, ancient pubs, lonely country manors and secluded castles invisible to the Muggle population.|$|E
