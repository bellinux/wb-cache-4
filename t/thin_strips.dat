5|$|In India carrots {{are used}} {{in a variety of}} ways, as salads or as {{vegetables}} added to spicy rice or dal dishes. A popular variation in north India is the Gajar Ka Halwa carrot dessert, which has carrots grated and cooked in milk until the whole mixture is solid, after which nuts and butter are added. Carrot salads are usually made with grated carrots with a seasoning of mustard seeds and green chillies popped in hot oil. Carrots can also be cut in <b>thin</b> <b>strips</b> and added to rice, can form part of a dish of mixed roast vegetables or can be blended with tamarind to make chutney.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} of the Delos mosaics and pavements include simple pebble constructions, chip-pavement made of white marble, ceramic fragments, and pieces of tesserae. The latter falls into two categories: the simpler, tessellated opus tessellatum using large pieces of tesserae, on average eight millimeters square, and the finer opus vermiculatum using pieces of tesserae smaller than four millimeters square. Many Delian mosaics use a mixture of these materials, while chip pavement is the most common. The latter is found in fifty-five homes and usually reserved for the ground floor. The majority of Delian mosaics comprise broken pieces of marble set into cement floors; other flooring bases are composed of either rammed earth or gneiss flagstones. Pavements in kitchens and latrines were built with pottery, brick, and tile fragments {{for the purpose of}} waterproofing. <b>Thin</b> <b>strips</b> of lead set into the cement are often used to distinguish the contours of geometric-patterned mosaics, but are absent in the more complex tessellated, figured mosaics.|$|E

40|$|Asymmetric rolling of <b>thin</b> <b>strip</b> {{has become}} {{important}} {{due to a}} significant decrease of rolling force, which contributes to obtain the extremely <b>thin</b> <b>strip,</b> to reduce the rolling passes, and to save the energy by a decrease of anneal treatment. In asymmetric rolling of <b>thin</b> <b>strip,</b> edges of work rolls may contact and deform when no or small work roll bending force is applied.

25|$|After pairing, {{both will}} {{search for a}} {{suitable}} breeding site. The female has the final say on nest location. Some males {{have been known to}} feed their paired females for up to 2–3 weeks before and during the selection of the nest site and building of the nest. Their breeding sites are mainly in rainforest regions or sheltered, humid gulies with an abundance of dense cover such as trees, saplings, shrubs and vines. The nest, will usually be built at the fork between two nearly horizontal tree branches in proximity to a water source, such as a stream. The structure of the nest is often compared to a wine glass with a broken bottom stand. The nest is built, usually in November, December and January, using <b>thin</b> <b>strips</b> of tree bark, grass, moss rootlets and decayed wood.|$|E

The two waterways remain close as they flow northwards between New Whittington and Brimington, where the River Drone joins from the west.

25|$|The weir by Station Lane, Oughtibridge {{served the}} Upper Middlewood forge, {{described}} as a tilt in the sources, as it had a tilt hammer which was raised up and allowed to drop to shape the metal. The weir is in good order, {{although much of the}} original structure has been replaced by concrete steps. Next came Middlewood Works, which was a rolling mill and slitting mill, splitting bars of iron into <b>thin</b> <b>strips</b> for the manufacture of nails. Four water wheels were recorded in the 1820s, and water power was still being uses in 1900. The site was cleared after 1985, but the stone weir, with its nine bays, remains. Beeley Wood or Nova Scotia Tilts was a sizeable operation, with eight water wheels operating in the 1830s, four wheels driving two forges, another two driving the bellows for the forges, and the final two driving two tilt hammers. The works was recorded as derelict by 1895. In February 2016 the Environment Agency removed the middle two-thirds of Beeley Wood Lower Weir as part of a scheme to allow the free migration of fish and let the river return to a more natural form. The next works was Hawksley or Clay Wheels which employed 54 men in 1794, and was still using water power in 1895. The site was used to make scythes until after 1941, when a film, which can be seen at the Kelham Island Museum, was made of its activity. The weir has five bays, but is deteriorating.|$|E
500|$|This rockfowl builds its nest {{onto the}} sides of rocks, {{normally}} in caves, where nests are built both by the entrance and deep within, or on nearly vertical cliff faces, which can be either bare or have some vegetation, though never woody branches, near the nest. Nests need to be built under an overhang {{to protect it from}} water, and the rock surface normally slopes forward slightly. The nests are almost always found near water, which can be in the form of either streams or forest pools. These streams, particularly those located {{at the base of a}} nesting cliff, help keep predators away from the nests. Nests on rock surfaces are normally built [...] above the ground. In addition to the rock face nests, there is a record of a nest being constructed on the buttress root of a Piptadeniastrum tree above a small stream. Two nests were even built onto a concrete bridge in Gabon's Lopé National Park. The male and female rockfowl work equally on the nest's construction, and it can take two to three months to build one, though in some extreme cases it takes more than a year. The nest itself is a half-cup constructed of dry mud with grass fibres and dead leaves mixed in, often with the plant matter sticking out of the nest's walls. It is either built onto the rock surface or, in some cases, is built more like a retaining wall across the opening of a small rock fissure. Nests are built at least away [...] from each other, and in some cases up to [...] The nest is normally [...] thick, though the nest is uneven in its construction and one nest was [...] thick.
