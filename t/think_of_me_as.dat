500|$|In 1990, Madonna {{starred in}} the film Dick Tracy as Breathless Mahoney—a new role {{introduced}} for her—with Warren Beatty, her boyfriend at the time, playing the titular character. After the shooting for Dick Tracy was over, Madonna started working on the soundtrack. She had begun recording three songs by Stephen Sondheim for the film—"Sooner or Later", [...] "More" [...] and [...] "What Can You Lose"—which {{would be part of}} the album, but also had to write and develop new songs comparable in style to her previous releases. She produced the entire album, including the Sondheim songs. [...] "I want people to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> a musical comedy actress. That's what this album is about for me. It's a stretch. Not just pop music, but songs that have a different feel to them, a theatrical feel", she said at the time.|$|E

500|$|By the 1980s {{record labels}} started to release albums that were closely {{associated}} with a film, thereby gaining double promotion.

500|$|Beatty had {{realized}} several {{positive aspects of}} hiring Madonna as an actress for the film. She would be inclined to develop the soundtrack for Dick Tracy and the film studio would {{see this as a}} promotional opportunity before the release of their product, since Madonna was popular as a recording artist. This would also benefit Warner Bros. Records, who would get a reason to release a new Madonna record. According to J. Randy Taraborrelli, author of , by the 1980s record labels started to release albums which were closely associated with a film, thereby gaining double promotion.

500|$|The {{original}} {{score was}} composed by Carter Burwell, {{a veteran of}} all the Coen Brothers' films. While the Coens were writing the screenplay they had Kenny Rogers' [...] "Just Dropped In (to See What Condition My Condition Was in)", the Gipsy Kings' cover of [...] "Hotel California", and several Creedence Clearwater Revival songs in mind. They asked T-Bone Burnett (who would later work with the Coens on O Brother, Where Art Thou? and Inside Llewyn Davis) to pick songs for the soundtrack of the film. They knew that they wanted different genres of music from different times but, as Joel remembers, [...] "T-Bone even came up with some far-out Henry Mancini and Yma Sumac." [...] Burnett was able to secure songs by Kenny Rogers and the Gipsy Kings and also added tracks by Captain Beefheart, Moondog and Bob Dylan's [...] "The Man in Me" [...] (from New Morning). However, he {{had a tough time}} securing the rights to Townes Van Zandt's cover of the Rolling Stones' [...] "Dead Flowers", which plays over the film's closing credits. Former Stones manager Allen Klein owned the rights to the song and wanted $150,000 for it. Burnett convinced Klein to watch an early cut of the film and remembers, [...] "It got to the part where the Dude says, 'I hate the fuckin' Eagles, man!' Klein stands up and says, 'That's it, you can have the song!' That was beautiful." [...] Burnett was going to be credited on the film as [...] "Music Supervisor", but asked his credit to be [...] "Music Archivist" [...] because he [...] "hated the notion of being a supervisor; I wouldn't want anyone to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> management".|$|E

[...] Several of his pieces were broadcast during his lifetime on BBC Radio. His Symphony No. 3 in C was premiered by the University of Iowa orchestra in Iowa City in 1975. Burgess described his Sinfoni Melayu {{as an attempt to}} [...] "combine the musical elements of the country into a synthetic language which called on native drums and xylophones." [...] The structure of [...] (1974) was modelled on Beethoven's Eroica symphony, while Mozart and the Wolf Gang (1991) mirrors the sound and rhythm of Mozartian composition, among other things attempting a fictional representation of Symphony No.40. Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 features prominently in A Clockwork Orange (and in Stanley Kubrick's film version of the novel). Many of his unpublished compositions are listed in This Man and Music. [...] He wrote a good deal of music for recorder as his son played the instrument. [...] Several of his pieces for recorder and piano including the Sonata No. 1, Sonatina and [...] "Tre Pezzetti" [...] have been included on a major CD release from recorder player John Turner and pianist Harvey Davies; the double album also includes related music from 15 other composers and is titled Anthony Burgess – The Man and his Music (Metier records, release September 2013).|$|E
