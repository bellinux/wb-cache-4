5|$|The American generals leading their {{shipbuilding}} effort {{encountered a}} variety of challenges. Shipwright was not a common occupation in the relative wilderness of upstate New York, and the Continental Navy had to pay extremely high wages to lure skilled craftsmen away from the coast. <b>The</b> <b>carpenters</b> hired to build boats on Lake Champlain were the best-paid employees of the navy, excepting only the Navy's Commodore, Esek Hopkins. By the end of July {{there were more than}} 200shipwrights at Skenesborough. In addition to skilled help, materials and supplies specific to maritime use needed to be brought to Skenesborough, where the ships were constructed, or Fort Ticonderoga, where they were fitted out for use.|$|E
5|$|The new candle was {{designed}} by the Allentown firm Alvin Butz Co., the Allentown firm Barry Isett & Associates, and Bethlehem Steel Corp. Supplies were provided by Dugan & Marcon Inc., Eisenhardt Mills, Ingersoll-Rand Co. and Dectis Painting, and the construction done by <b>the</b> <b>Carpenters</b> Union Local 600, Electricians Union Local 367 and the Northampton County Labor Council. It looked {{almost exactly the same}} as the old previous candle, with eight flood lights installed to illuminate the white shaft. The candle cost $35,000 to build, but Panto said without the help from volunteers, it would have cost around $150,000, not including labor. In order to cover the $15,000 shortfall in funds raised, the city sold Christmas cards, posters, ornaments and $10 Peace Candle ownership shares. The first lighting ceremony for the new candle was held November 23, 1990.|$|E
5|$|With {{water levels}} above the {{structure}} remaining fairly constant, £400,000 {{was spent on}} refurbishing City Mills Lock. Although some work had been carried out in 2006, including the fitting of new metal gates, it was not operational, and had not been used for around 40 years. The second phase of restoration included fitting the equipment to automate its operation. The first public use of the lock occurred on 31 July 2010. British Waterways hoped to restore <b>the</b> <b>Carpenters</b> Road Lock soon afterwards, but the project was postponed until {{after the completion of}} the Olympic games, as temporary 'Land Bridges' were erected over the site of the lock to enable pedestrians to reach the stadium, some of which will be removed after the event. Following the Olympic games, it is hoped the waterways will continue to be used by both commercial and leisure craft.|$|E

Pooler also introduced Richard to fellow undergraduate and future song-writing collaborator John Bettis. Another undergraduate, Wesley Jacobs, would join <b>the</b> <b>Carpenters</b> as a musical instrumentalist. <b>The</b> <b>Carpenters</b> sold over 100 million records, won three Grammy Awards out of eighteen nominations, and created numerous gold and platinum albums. One of Pooler's personal poems formed the basis for Merry Christmas Darling, which went to No. 1 on the Billboard charts for three years. Bettis, who later would win an Primetime Emmy Award himself, also successfully collaborated on songs with other artists, such as Human Nature performed by Michael Jackson, Crazy for You performed by Madonna, and One Moment in Time performed by Whitney Houston.|$|E
25|$|While <b>the</b> <b>Carpenters</b> disdained {{industrial}} unionism, {{they were}} willing to accept mass production workers into their own union, albeit as second-class members. <b>The</b> <b>Carpenters</b> had fought with the Wood Workers union chartered by the AFL for decades, claiming that any workers who planed wood products that were subsequently used in construction, such as doors, sashes, mouldings and the like, were performing carpenters' work and must be brought within its union. While <b>the</b> <b>Carpenters</b> had never made similar claims on work performed by sawmill workers, much less tried to organize them, the union successfully insisted that the AFL assign the newly created Sawmill and Timber Workers’ Union to it in 1935. That forced marriage was not successful, as most of these workers soon bolted to form the International Woodworkers of America and to join the CIO several years later after a recognition strike.|$|E

25|$|McGuire's successors {{took a more}} {{aggressive}} stance toward other unions whose members were performing work that <b>the</b> <b>Carpenters</b> union either considered its own members' right to perform or saw {{as a threat to}} their craft traditions. The union waged jurisdictional strikes to claim work that other unions, such as the Machinists, Sheet Metal Workers and Electrical Workers claimed as theirs. <b>The</b> <b>Carpenters</b> used its size to win many of these disputes. After the death of president James Kirby in 1915, it frequently disaffiliated from the AFL's Building Trades Department to protest those decisions it lost.|$|E
25|$|Even {{after it}} left the federation, however, <b>the</b> <b>Carpenters</b> formed a {{temporary}} alliance, the New Unity Partnership in 2003 and the Change to Win Coalition with other unions — including SEIU, UNITE HERE, and the Laborers — to force the AFL-CIO to consider basic structural changes {{in order to facilitate}} organizing. In the summer of 2009, the United Brotherhood of Carpenters disaffiliated from Change to Win after the other affiliates in the Change to Win Coalition demanded <b>the</b> <b>Carpenters</b> cease raiding other Union's membership and allow Carpenter members basic democratic rights.|$|E

50|$|Nicholas, a young student, seduces Alison, {{the wife}} of a carpenter. In order to decieve <b>the</b> <b>carpenter,</b> Nicholas convinces him that a massive flood is about to occur, and claims that he, <b>the</b> <b>carpenter,</b> and Allison should all three wait in buckets tied to the ceiling rafters to escape drowning. While <b>the</b> <b>carpenter</b> waits in his bucket, Nicholas and Allison sneak away to have sex. Meanwhile, a youth named Absolon who has been flirting with Alison arrives asking for a kiss. Allison answers him by {{inviting}} him to climb up to her window and then farting in his face. Absolon runs to a blacksmith's shop where he borrows a hot poker, then returns to <b>the</b> <b>carpenter's</b> house and asks for another kiss. On this occasion, Nicholas goes to the window instead of Alison, and has his buttocks scalded. Nicholas then cries out for water, leading <b>the</b> <b>carpenter</b> to believe that the flood has arrived. <b>The</b> <b>carpenter</b> then cuts <b>the</b> rope holding his bucket in the air, and violently falls to the ground.|$|R

When the Iron Workers refused to relinquish this work the AFL suspended it from membership in 1917. Other unions, such as the Lathers, then claimed that work that had historically been done by iron workers belonged to them instead.
