5|$|On {{his second}} sortie, he scored another victory, {{and by the}} 15 September 1940, had claimed his fourth victory. Marseille became an ace on 18 September after {{claiming}} a fifth aircraft shot down. While returning from a bomber-escort mission on 23 September 1940 flying Werk Nummer (W.Nr) 5094, his engine failed 10 miles off Cap Gris Nez after combat damage sustained over Dover. Pilot Officer George Bennions from 41 Squadron may have shot Marseille down. According to another source, W.Nr 5094 was destroyed in this engagement by Robert Stanford Tuck, who had pursued a Bf 109 to <b>that</b> <b>location</b> and whose pilot was rescued by a He 59 naval aircraft. Marseille is the only German airman {{known to have been}} rescued by a He 59 on that day and in <b>that</b> <b>location.</b> Tuck's official claim was for a Bf 109 destroyed off Cap Gris Nez at 09:45—the only pilot to submit a claim in <b>that</b> <b>location.</b>|$|E

In the first legend it is said <b>that</b> <b>location</b> of the present Monastery was selected by a horse which belonged to Merag Lama Lodre Gyatso who was on a mission assigned to him by the 5th Dalai Lama to establish a Monastery.

When {{he came out of the}} cave, he found his horse missing. He then went in search of the horse and finally found it grazing at the top of a mountain called Tana Mandekhang, which in the past was the palace of King Kala Wangpo.
