Diệm bureaucrats claimed Chương's last telegram had been so critical of the regime that it {{was determined to be}} [...] "inadmissible in form and substance" [...] and that after years of privately complaining about his ambassador, Diệm dismissed him.

[...] As he devises the concept for his cartoon, he eliminates anything he believes to be malicious or insensitive. [...] At the Fourth Asian Cartoon Exhibition in Tokyo, Lat revealed that when it came to making religious comments in his work, he only did so on his own religion (Islam). [...] In such cases, Lat uses his art to help educate the young about his faith. [...] Lat trusts his editors <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>their</b> <b>jobs</b> and cull what is socially unacceptable for print. [...] In an interview, he revealed his discomfort with the concept of self-publishing, believing that unadulterated or unsupervised cartoon drawing could lead to [...] "rubbish". [...] He prefers to be assertive in areas with which he is comfortable or competent. [...] Lat is adamant on not changing what he has already drawn; several pieces of his cartoons remain unpublished because editors refused to print them unchanged. [...] When that happens, the editors spike (blank) the space for his regular cartoon in the newspaper. [...] Lat admitted of his unprinted works: [...] "Okay, maybe I've pushed the line a little bit, but I've never got into trouble and, frankly, only a handful of my cartoons were ever spiked." ...|$|E

Taylor was {{the best}} known pioneer {{in the field of}} {{scientific}} management in the late 19th century, carefully timing and plotting the functions of various workers and then devising new, more efficient ways for them <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>their</b> <b>jobs.</b> [...] Ford Motor Co. used techniques of scientific management although Henry Ford claimed not to know of the Taylor's system. Ford Motor used every practical means to reduce the effort and movement of workers {{in order to reduce the}} time involved in making parts, moving parts and assembling parts into automobiles. Ford used electric powered factories and in 1913 Ford introduced the assembly line, a step in the process that became known as mass-production.

2500|$|With {{the passage}} of time, studies of human rights {{violations}} in Peru have discovered a close relationship between Garcia and the forces within Peru who promote impunity for human rights violators. [...] Garcia was involved in colonizing the bench by placing inside the judiciary judges who would be sympathetic to perpetrators of human rights violations. [...] Additionally, Garcia was supportive of efforts to punish judges who handed down indictments of perpetrators. [...] Garcia himself was in the presidency during many gross {{violations of human rights}} and he has been quite hostile to human rights organizations and to judicial actors who seek justice for victims of human rights violations. [...] During his presidency Garcia sought to tilt the legal playing field in favor of the military and against victims. [...] He also tried to make life difficult for NGOs seeking to help victims. [...] For example, he offered extensive resources to defendants and military officers while creating new laws that would make it difficult for human rights NGOs <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>their</b> <b>jobs,</b> receive necessary resources, and pursue the advance of judicial action that attempted to bring human rights justice.|$|E

Lucas convinced her to abscond and they lived on the road, eventually traveling to California, where an employer's wife asked them to work for her infirm mother, 82-year-old Kate Rich, of Ringgold, Texas. Rich's family turned Lucas and Powell out, accusing them of failing <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>their</b> <b>jobs</b> and writing checks on her account. While hitchhiking they were {{picked up by the}} [...] minister of a Stoneburg, Texas religious commune called [...] "The House of Prayer". Believing Lucas and the 15-year-old Powell were a married couple, he found Lucas a job as a roofer while allowing the couple to stay in a small apartment on the commune. Powell had become argumentative and homesick for Florida, and Lucas said she left at a Bowie, Texas truck stop. According to some of his later accounts Lucas murdered Powell and then Rich. In addition to confessing, Lucas led the police to remains said to be Powell and Rich, although forensic evidence alone was inconclusive and the coroner stopped short of positively identifying either remains. As with most of his alleged crimes, Lucas later denied involvement, but the consensus is he did murder Powell and Rich.|$|E
