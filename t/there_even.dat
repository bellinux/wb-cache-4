5|$|Dhumavati is {{described}} as a giver of siddhis (supernatural powers), a rescuer from all troubles, and a granter of all desires and rewards, including ultimate knowledge and moksha (salvation). Her worship is also prescribed for those who wish to defeat their foes. Dhumavati's worship is considered ideal for unpaired members of society, such as bachelors, widows, and world renouncers as well as Tantrikas. In her Varanasi temple, however, she transcends her inauspiciousness and acquires the status of a local protective deity. <b>There,</b> <b>even</b> married couples worship her. Although she has very few dedicated temples, her worship by Tantric ritual continues in private in secluded places like cremation grounds and forests.|$|E
5|$|During {{its history}} Maribor {{has played a}} total of 57 seasons. In that time the club has spent 31 seasons {{as a member of}} a top {{division}}, 17 in the second division and 9 in the third. To date, the club has won a total of 27 domestic trophies. The team plays at the Ljudski vrt stadium since 1961 and played <b>there</b> <b>even</b> during the stadium's construction. This list details the club's achievements in senior league and cup competitions, and the top scorers for each season.|$|E

5|$|Governor Frederick Walker Pitkin {{had ordered}} all {{settlers}} to stay {{to the east}} of the Divide, as the state and federal governments had not made peace with the Utes. Nevertheless, some defied the order, drawn by the prospect of mining fortunes. Settlers sometimes used Hunter Pass to get to Ashcroft, an early camp on Castle Creek above the Roaring Fork. However, they preferred to take the southern route over the slightly higher Cottonwood Pass through Taylor Park and then back over Taylor Pass to get <b>there,</b> <b>even</b> though this made for a 100-mile (160km) journey, 40 miles (64km) more than the direct route offered by Hunter Pass.|$|E
5|$|In September 1928 Britten went as a boarder to Gresham's School, in Holt, Norfolk. At {{the time}} he felt unhappy <b>there,</b> <b>even</b> writing in his diary of contemplating suicide or running away: he hated being {{separated}} from his family, most particularly from his mother; he despised the music master; and he was shocked at the prevalence of bullying, though {{he was not the}} target of it. He remained there for two years and in 1930, he won a composition scholarship at the Royal College of Music (RCM) in London; his examiners were the composers John Ireland and Ralph Vaughan Williams and the college's harmony and counterpoint teacher, S P Waddington.|$|E
5|$|The Sainte-Laguë {{method is}} used for allocating {{parliamentary}} seats to parties. As a result, the percentage of representatives is roughly equal to the nationwide percentage of votes. Still, a party with {{a high number of}} votes in only one constituency can win a seat <b>there</b> <b>even</b> if the nationwide percentage is low. This has happened several times in Norwegian history. Conversely, if a party's initial representation in Parliament is proportionally less than its share of votes, the party may seat more representatives through leveling seats, provided that the nationwide percentage is above the election threshold, at 4 percent. In 2005, nineteen seats were allocated via the leveling system.|$|E

5|$|The ship crosses an ice {{barrier and}} arrives in open sea, {{close to the}} South Pole, albeit with a mild climate. Here the Jane Guy comes upon a mysterious island called Tsalal, {{inhabited}} by a tribe of black, apparently friendly natives led by a chief named Too-Wit. The color white is alien to the island's inhabitants and unnerves them, because nothing that color exists <b>there.</b> <b>Even</b> the natives' teeth are black. The island {{is also home to}} many undiscovered species of flora and fauna. Even its water is different from water elsewhere, being strangely thick and exhibiting multicolored veins.|$|E
5|$|Upon their arrival, {{many were}} in disbelief that the Rockets could thrive in Houston. They {{were coming to}} a city {{that did not have}} a {{suitable}} arena, and had not shown much interest in professional basketball. Houston was previously home to the Houston Mavericks of the American Basketball Association for only two seasons between 1967 and 1969, where the average attendance was only 200. The city's largest indoor arena was 34-year-old Sam Houston Coliseum, but the Rockets quickly ruled out playing <b>there</b> <b>even</b> on a temporary basis. As the team owners planned out on building a proper arena, the Rockets were forced to play most of their games at the University of Houston's Hofheinz Pavilion, while playing occasional games at the Astrodome and San Antonio's HemisFair Arena.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert {{built the}} Garrick Theatre in 1889. The Gilberts moved to Grim's Dyke in Harrow in 1890, which he {{purchased}} from Robert Heriot, {{to whom the}} artist Frederick Goodall had sold the property in 1880. In 1891, Gilbert was appointed Justice of the Peace for Middlesex. After casting Nancy McIntosh in Utopia, Limited, {{he and his wife}} developed an affection for her, and she eventually gained the status of an unofficially adopted daughter, moving to Grim's Dyke to live with them. She continued living <b>there,</b> <b>even</b> after Gilbert died, until Lady Gilbert's death in 1936. A statue of Charles II, carved by Danish sculptor Caius Gabriel Cibber in 1681, was moved in 1875 from Soho Square to an island in the lake at Grim's Dyke, where it remained when Gilbert purchased the property. On Lady Gilbert's direction, it was restored to Soho Square in 1938.|$|E

25|$|By now, McTell {{had begun}} {{travelling}} abroad, busking around Europe with his guitar. He {{spent time in}} France and visited Belgium and Germany. Other trips took him to Italy and through Yugoslavia ("I felt a madness <b>there,</b> <b>even</b> then") to Greece.|$|E
25|$|The opening Test at Brisbane has {{a history}} of having {{important}} psychological effects on the teams. The four England teams before ours had all lost <b>there.</b> <b>Even</b> Len Hutton's eventually victorious side went down there by an innings. We drew the match and I believe this was the turning point of our tour. Nobody expected us to come out of it with our pride intact.|$|E
25|$|When the Turkic peoples {{began their}} late medieval conquest of Asia Minor, Byzantine Greek {{citizens}} were {{the largest group}} of indigenous peoples living <b>there.</b> <b>Even</b> after the Turkic conquests of the interior, the mountainous Black Sea coast of Asia Minor remained the heart of a Greek state, the Empire of Trebizond, until its eventual conquest by the Ottoman Turks in 1461, nearly a decade {{after the fall of the}} European territory of the Greeks to the Ottomans.|$|E

25|$|Carter {{reaches the}} city of Thran and buys passage on a galleon to Celephaïs. While en route, Carter asks the sailors about the men who trade in Celephaïsthe ones he {{believes}} to be kin to the gods. He learns that they are from the cold, dark land of Inquanok or Inganok and that few people dare to travel <b>there.</b> <b>Even</b> more ominous, there are no cats there. The plateau of Leng with its inhuman treacheries is too near.|$|E
25|$|A {{certain number}} of {{practical}} and technical lessons has to be completed again {{depending on the type}} of vehicle. Obligatory lessons include a minimum number of lessons each driving on: the motorway Autobahn; rural areas, and in the dark. The actual number of lessons a student completes varies with individual skill. As the most difficult part of the driving test is usually urban driving, most lessons actually take place <b>there,</b> <b>even</b> though there is no mandated minimum for that.|$|E
25|$|Ion Luca Caragiale also {{associated}} with Junimeas mouthpiece, Convorbiri Literare, and continued to contribute <b>there</b> <b>even</b> after 1885, when the society began to decline in importance. It was here that all his major comedies were first presented to the public. He did not, however, join Petre P. Carp's movement, which aimed to consolidate Junimea as a third force in Romanian politics, and remained a staunch independent over the following years. Caragiale was nevertheless associated with the Junimist journal Constituţionalul.|$|E
5000|$|In the track-by-track {{review by}} Billboard, {{the song is}} given a {{positive}} response and explained as, [...] "Synths and palm-muted guitars carry the mid-tempo verses into a head-nodding hard rock chorus.

5000|$|This is {{the last}} studio album from the band before taking a 9 years hiatus, {{combining}} the best of old with experimentation.

25|$|In its {{essentials}} {{simply an}} enlarged version of BOAR, {{which it was}} intended to replace in service, Hopi was designed as a medium-range weapon capable of being carried by a wide variety of carrier-based fighter and attack aircraft. The rocket-powered missile was capable of being fitted with a W50 nuclear warhead capable of producing a yield between 60 and 400 kilotons; however, no details of the planned guidance system for the missile, or if <b>there</b> <b>even</b> was intended to be guidance at all, have survived.|$|E
25|$|After {{a loss to}} the Chicago Bulls on Christmas Day, the Nets {{dropped to}} a disappointing 9–19 record. Many critics started to {{question}} Kidd's ability to manage a group of veterans that included Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce and Joe Johnson and <b>there</b> <b>even</b> appeared rumours that Kidd might {{be on his way}} out {{before the end of the}} season. However, the Nets were able to turn things around at the beginning of 2014 and finished the season with a 44-38 record, while Kidd began to get recognition for his coaching skills.|$|E
25|$|At the Deir el-Bahari temple, Hatshepsut's {{numerous}} statues {{were torn}} down {{and in many}} cases, smashed or disfigured before being buried in a pit. At Karnak, <b>there</b> <b>even</b> {{was an attempt to}} wall up her obelisks. While it is clear that much of this rewriting of Hatshepsut's history occurred only during the close of Thutmose III's reign, it is not clear why it happened, other than the typical pattern of self-promotion that existed among the pharaohs and their administrators, or perhaps saving money by not building new monuments for the burial of Thutmose III and instead, using the grand structures built by Hatshepsut.|$|E
50|$|And the {{stand-out}} moment, Soul Survivor, {{is built}} {{to resemble the}} Big Song from an 80s movie (so much that it even has big chunky synths {{and the presence of}} the great Chaka Khan) before working its way through most genres of soul (<b>there’s</b> <b>even</b> a great Fauxtown bridge).|$|R
