25|$|For {{stays in}} the Schengen Area as a whole which exceed 90 days, a <b>third-country</b> <b>national</b> will need to hold either a long-stay visa for a period no longer than a year, or a {{residence}} permit for longer periods. A long-stay visa is a national visa but is issued in accordance with a uniform format. It entitles the holder to enter the Schengen Area and remain in the issuing state for a period longer than 90 days {{but no more than}} one year. If a Schengen state wishes to allow the holder of a long-stay visa to remain there for longer than a year, the state must issue him or her with a residence permit.|$|E
25|$|The {{additional}} obligations imposed by European law on national border authorities {{when it comes}} to processing travellers who are third-country nationals (e.g. the obligation to stamp their travel documents) should not prevent the development of automated border control systems which are made available to such travellers. As shown by the examples listed above of automated border control systems which have been developed at external border crossing points of the Schengen Area, national border authorities have been able to adapt the design of their automated border control systems to allow third-country nationals to make use of them. One solution is to have a border guard physically positioned next to the automated border gates who can stamp travel documents where required: this approach has been adopted by the Finnish Border Guard at the automated border gates in Helsinki Airport, where eligible users (who are required to receive a passport stamp) include holders of Australian, Canadian, Japanese, New Zealand, South Korean and United States biometric passports, {{as well as by the}} Portuguese Serviço de Estrangeiros e Fronteiras at the automated border gates in Lisbon Airport where eligible users (who are required to receive a passport stamp) include holders of Angolan and Brazilian passports and holders of diplomatic/service passports. A similar but slightly different solution has been adopted by the Dutch Royal Marechaussee at the Privium iris recognition automated border gates at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport (where eligible users include registered EU/EEA/Swiss citizens, US citizens who are Global Entry members, and all nationals who are holders of diplomatic passports), as well as by the German Federal Police at the ABG Plus iris recognition automated border gates at Frankfurt Airport (where eligible users include registered EU/EEA/Swiss citizens and US citizens who are Global Entry members): when eligible third-country nationals use Privium/ABG Plus, after their iris is scanned and verified, a different gate opens to that for EU/EEA/Swiss citizens and the <b>third-country</b> <b>national</b> is directed to a lane which leads them to the front of the queue for manual passport checks at immigration desks, where the border officer stamps the user's passport. Another possible solution would be to design the automated border gates to print a paper slip with an entry or exit stamp on it, as well as the traveller's name and travel document number, whenever the user is a traveller who is subject to the requirement to have his or her travel document stamped. At the Port of Helsinki, the Finnish Border Guard has adapted the design of the automated border gates there to widen eligibility to include Russian citizens (who, as Annex I nationals, are required to have a visa) by requiring them to scan both the biodata page and the visa inside their passport, then to step into the gate for a facial image and fingerprint recognition, and after the gate opens to approach a border officer to have their passport stamped.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is a {{comprehensive}} overview of <b>third-country</b> <b>nationals</b> on the labour market in South Bohemian region. It is primarily focused on {{a comparison of the}} number of foreigners in the labour market in the period 2007 - 2011 according to various districts of the region. This work is also focused on identifying major employers of <b>third-country</b> <b>nationals</b> in South Bohemia and theirs experience with workers from third countries. Besides literature review dealing with the labour migration topic, the trend analysis of the <b>third-country</b> <b>nationals</b> number in the districts of South Bohemian region in the period 2007 ? 2011 was based on data from the Czech Statistical Office and the Regional Labour Office in České Budějovice. Then the set of five major South Bohemian region employers of third country workers was identified. It includes both manufacturing and services providing enterprises. The surveyed companies were selected based on the criteria of number of employed third country workers and the business sector too, so the research includes respondents from different areas of business (production of interiors for the automotive industry, metal finishing, processing industry, restaurants and transport). The structure of the interview with human resource managers or owners of these five companies about employment of <b>third-country</b> <b>nationals</b> was designed to detect reasons leading firms to employ third-country workers, the level of satisfaction with their performance, methods of recruitment foreign workers, as well as respondents' views on current legislative conditions associated with employment of <b>third-country</b> <b>nationals.</b> The obtained information was subsequently processed into five case studies, each of which deals with the description of the current situation in the employment of <b>third-country</b> <b>nationals</b> in a particular company. Based on the analysis of labor migration in South Bohemia, we can say that in the 2007 ? 2011 period, the number of <b>third-country</b> <b>nationals</b> in the labor market in South Bohemian region ranged from about 6 000 to 7 500 workers. The largest increase in the third-county workers quantity in the labour market was reported in 2008. In the following years there was a {{decline in the number of}} foreigners in the region, mainly due to rising unemployment, which was affected by the global economic crisis. In terms of ethnic composition of the of third-country workers group in the South Bohemian region, there prevail citizens of Ukraine. Other main nationalities in region are represented by Vietnamese, Russians and Moldovans. In most districts foreigners are most often represented by Ukrainians. The only exception are districts of Prachatice and Jindřichův Hradec where the Vietnamese are dominate. Five case studies with representatives of employers show that these companies where foreigners are employed mostly on blue-collar workers, are satisfied with this category of workers. Employers are especially pleased with third-country workers approach to work, willing and very satisfactory performance in their jobs. The admission of <b>third-country</b> <b>nationals</b> leading employers largely disregard Czech workers about the position, which are regarded as menial and poorly evaluated financially. The current legislative conditions associated with third country workers employment in a third country is evaluated as legitimate. However, respondents agree, that those provisions have negative impact on the continuity of the recruitment <b>third-country</b> <b>nationals</b> process...|$|R

40|$|This study, {{compiled}} {{according to}} commonly agreed specifications, {{provides an overview}} of the key issues and challenges that are apparent in relation to the intra-EU mobility of third-country nationals to and from Ireland. The intra-EU mobility of <b>third-country</b> <b>national</b> workers is an area that has received little policy attention in Ireland. The Irish immigration system does not actively facilitate the intra-EU mobility of third-country nationals, nor are there measures introduced specifically to restrict such mobility. Intra-EU mobility rights are provided for certain categories of third-country nationals within the EU acquis subject to the necessary conditions being met. However, Ireland has not exercised its opt-in to several EU Directives that are relevant in this regard: the Long-term Residents Directive, the Blue Card Directive and the Students Directive. A <b>third-country</b> <b>national,</b> who is resident in another Member State under the terms of one of these Directives, holds no advantage over a <b>third-country</b> <b>national</b> travelling to Ireland from outside the EU: each must meet the same immigration requirements. Most relevant data sources in Ireland are not designed to record the intra-EU mobility of third country nationals: detailed figures on visa applications by current location of applicant are not readily available; the employment permits administrative system has the potential to capture information on the place of residence of the applicant, but this field is not consistently filled. Furthermore due to measurement issues associated with sub-populations in sample surveys, data on migration flows by origin/destination, broken down by nationality, are not published by the Central Statistics Office. Sufficient data exist to indicate that intra-EU mobility to and from Ireland is low...|$|E
