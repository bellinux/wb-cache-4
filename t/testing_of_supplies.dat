The {{objective of this}} thesis {{is to examine the}} effects <b>of</b> source <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> and carrier on shipping times of high-priority requisitions to primary destinations of Navy units in the Pacific Theater and Persian Gulf. Our focus was primarily on determining whether source <b>of</b> <b>supply,</b> carrier, and the interaction of these two factors, have an effect on shipping times of highpriority requisitions. "Source of supply" refers to Department <b>of</b> Defense <b>supply</b> depots and "carrier" refers to shippers, such as Federal ExpressÊ¼ and DHL Worldwide ExpressÊ¼. This study uses ordinary least square (OLS) linear models, generalized linear models (GLM's) and nonparametric methods to explore the structure of the historical requisition datasets. OLS linear models were found to be inadequate, but both the GLM's and nonparametric tests proved to be valid and yielded results from which inferences could be made.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine the possibilities for the downward plane jet to separate two zones with different pollution concentration. This project work is based on technique called protected zone ventilation (PZV) which using plane jet, namely air curtain. The aim of the downward jet is to prevent transmission of indoor pollutions from target zone to protected zone and reduce exposure of occupant to infection risk. The measurements were carried out to <b>test</b> the performance <b>of</b> the protected zone ventilation for reception space under difference configuration <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> and exhaust airflow rate and supply and exhaust air velocity. In this study used the tracer gas, namely CO 2 to simulate the reside of occupant and their breathing functions during which spreads the bacteria and virus of infectious diseases. During the measurement of CO 2 concentration found that the plane jet is able to divide internal open space to subzones even when the internal velocity will be decrease to about 2. 47 m/s (= 78 m 3 /h) and the volume of exhaust air will be equal to 310 m 3 /h. However, the smoke <b>test</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> air distribution shows that the downward plane jet with pollutants will be removed by exhaust system without mixing with ambient air if the exhaust airflow rate was increased to 1065 m 3 /h. The results shows that this performance of PZV may be used to reduce the exposure of an occupant to exhaled air from other occupants, nevertheless this kind of study should be still continue to get a better understanding of the performance of the PZV in dependence of conditions and place of applications.
