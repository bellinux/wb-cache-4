40|$|Abstract. Models of {{wildland}} fire-induced stem {{heating and}} tissue necrosis require accurate estimates of inward heat flux at the bark surface. <b>Thermocouple</b> <b>probes</b> or heat flux sensors placed at a stem surface do not mimic the thermal response of tree bark to flames. We show that data from thin <b>thermocouple</b> <b>probes</b> inserted {{just below the}} bark can be used, {{by means of a}} one-dimensional inverse heat conduction method, to estimate net heat flux (inward minus outward heat flow) and temperature at the bark surface. Further, we estimate outward heat flux from emitted water vapor and bark surface re-radiation. Estimates of surface heat flux and temperature made by the inverse method confirm that surface-mounted heat flux sensors and <b>thermocouple</b> <b>probes</b> overestimate surface heat flux and temperature. As a demonstration of the utility of the method, we characterized uneven stem heating, due to leeward, flame-driven vortices, in a prescribed surface fire. Advantages of using an inverse method include lower cost, ease of multipoint measurements and negligible effects on the target stem. Drawbacks of the simple inverse model described herein include inability to estimate heat flux in very moist bark and uncertainty in estimates when extensive charring occurs...|$|R

40|$|A <b>thermocouple</b> <b>probe</b> with {{a heated}} shield {{has been used}} to measure {{stagnation}} temperature at the nozzle exit of the University of Southern Queensland hypersonic wind tunnel. The <b>thermocouple</b> <b>probe</b> consisted of a welded junction T-type thermocouple mounted within a heated tube with a vent hole downstream of the junction. Pressure transducers within the barrel of the wind tunnel have also been used to obtain the pressure history during the free piston compression process. The pressure measurements have been used to provide a theoretical value for the flow stagnation temperature for direct comparison with the thermocouple measurements. Assuming isentropic compression of the test gas, the flow stagnation temperature would be about 571 K for the current operating condition. After applying a response-time correction for the thermocouple signals, a stagnation temperature value of about 495 K was obtained from the measurements.

40|$|For {{adequate}} hyperthermia treatments, reliable temperature information during {{treatment is}} essential. During regional hyperthermia, temperature information is preferably obtained non-invasively from intracavitary or intraluminal measurements to avoid implant risks for the patient. However, for intracavitary or intraluminal thermometry optimal tissue contact is less natural as for invasive thermometry. In this study, {{the reliability of}} intraluminal/intracavitary measurements was examined in phantom experiments and in a numerical model for various extents of thermal contact between thermometry and the surroundings. Both thermocouple probes and fibre optic probes were investigated. Temperature rises after a 30 s power pulse of the 70 MHz AMC- 4 hyperthermia system were measured in a tissue-equivalent phantom using a multisensor <b>thermocouple</b> <b>probe</b> placed centrally in a hollow tube. The tube was filled with (1) air, (2) distilled water or (3) saline solution that mimics the properties of tissue, simulating situations with (1) bad thermal contact and no power dissipation in the tube, (2) good thermal contact but no power dissipation or (3) good thermal contact and tissue representative power dissipation. For numerical simulations, a cylindrical symmetric model of a <b>thermocouple</b> <b>probe</b> or a fibre optic probe in a cavity was developed. The cavity was modelled as air, distilled water or saline solution. A generalised E-Field distribution was assumed, resulting in a power deposition. With this power deposition, the temperature rise after a 30 s power pulse was calculated. When thermal contact was bad (1), both phantom measurements and simulations with a <b>thermocouple</b> <b>probe</b> showed very high temperature rises (> 0. 5 degrees C), which are artefacts due to self-heating of the <b>thermocouple</b> <b>probe,</b> since no power is dissipated in air. Simulations with a fibre optic probe showed almost no temperature rise when the cavity was filled with air. When thermal contact was good, but no power was dissipated in the tube (2), artefacts due to self-heating were not significant and the observed temperature rises were very low (approximately 0 - 0. 1 degrees C). For the situation, with tissue representative power dissipation (3), a temperature rise of approximately 0. 23 degrees C was observed for both measurements and simulations. A clinical example of a regional hyperthermia treatment of a patient with a cervix uteri carcinoma showed that the artefacts observed {{in the case of}} bad thermal contact also affect the steady-state temperature measurements.

The maximum rms temperature approaches 250 °C and occurs off-axis, just downstream of the recirculation zone. The heat flux on the centerline is negative and becomes more negative with downstream distance. Correspondingly, the temperature time series and the probability density function of the fluctuating temperature indicate that neither is cool dilution air present near the centerline nor are hot fluid particles present near the wall. This is attributed to the preferential transport of hot, low velocity fluid particles towards the centerline and cool dense gas, towards the wall by the swirl. © 1985 Combustion Institute...|$|E
