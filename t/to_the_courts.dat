5|$|In {{addition}} to his Supreme Court appointments, Harrison appointed ten judges <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> of appeals, two judges to the circuit courts, and 26 judges to the district courts.|$|E
5|$|Although {{sections}} 8 and 10 of the ISA concern {{matters of}} national security, the Court held that this concern {{does not preclude}} the objective review of executive discretion. Following the case of Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service (1983), the Court of Appeal decided that it is up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> {{to determine whether a}} decision is in fact based on grounds of national security. Similarly, it should also be within the court's purview to determine whether the matters relied upon in exercising powers under the ISA fall within the scope of purposes specified by sections8 and 10.|$|E
5|$|During {{subsequent}} {{discussions with}} a US consular official, Terrazas gave conflicting answers {{as to whether}} or not he had truly intended to abandon his rights as a US citizen when he applied for his certificate of Mexican nationality. The State Department eventually concluded that he had lost his US citizenship, a decision which Terrazas appealed, first before the State Department's board of appellate review, and subsequently <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>courts.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1571 Schissler {{travelled}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> of Augustus of Saxony in Dresden and in 1583, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> of Rudolf II in Prague.|$|R
50|$|After graduating, Joost Berman {{worked as}} an {{attorney}} in Zierikzee. Subsequently he was employed by <b>the</b> local <b>court,</b> serving as Assistant Clerk <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Court,</b> Clerk <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Court,</b> Judge of Peace, and from 1838 as Canton Judge. In 1843 Jacobus Boeije succeeded Berman as Canton Judge and Berman served again as Clerk <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> until 1851.|$|R
25|$|As governor, Kaine made {{a number}} of {{appointments}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Virginia state <b>courts.</b> Kaine made two appointments <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Supreme <b>Court</b> of Virginia, naming Chesapeake Circuit Judge S. Bernard Goodwyn <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> in 2007 and Virginia Court of Appeals Judge LeRoy F. Millette, Jr. <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> in 2008.|$|R
5|$|Finally, Universal's conduct {{amounted}} to {{an abuse of}} judicial process, {{and in that sense}} caused a longer harm to the public as a whole. Depending on the commercial results, Universal alternatively argued <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>courts,</b> first, that King Kong {{was a part of the}} public domain, and then second, that King Kong was not part of the public domain, and that Universal possessed exclusive trademark rights in it. Universal's assertions in court were based not on any good faith belief in their truth, but on the mistaken belief that it could use the courts to turn a profit.|$|E
5|$|Forced {{to choose}} between {{accepting}} depreciated money in payment for outstanding debts or waiting long times to collect debts, creditors turned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> for relief. In 1822, Bourbon County circuit court judge James Clark ruled {{in the case of}} Williams v. Blair that the replevin law violated the state and federal constitutions. This ruling was so unpopular with the Relief Party that they attempted to remove him from office, but the 5935 vote fell just short of the needed two-thirds majority. Fayette County circuit court judge Francis P. Blair issued a similar ruling in the case of Lapsley v. Brashear.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{enactment}} of Article 100, Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong noted during the Second Reading of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment No. 2) Bill that the Singapore Constitution had no provisions for referring questions of constitutional interpretation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> for an advisory ruling, especially those relating to new and complex provisions of the Constitution. Article 100 was intended to address this perceived lacuna in the Constitution.|$|E
50|$|The Honourable Justice Sir Mark O'Regan of <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> of Appeal {{served as}} partner at Chapman Tripp from 1984. He was {{appointed}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> High <b>Court</b> in 2001, and was elevated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> of Appeal in 2004 {{where he served}} as President of <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> of Appeal, until his elevation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Supreme <b>Court</b> in September 2014. Justice Miller was a partner at Chapman Tripp from 1987, until appointment <b>to</b> <b>the</b> High <b>Court</b> in 2004, and then <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> of Appeal in June 2013.|$|R
50|$|On 26 September 2015, al-Mahdi was {{surrendered}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> by <b>the</b> {{government of}} Niger and transferred <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>court's</b> detention center in The Hague, Netherlands.|$|R
50|$|He was {{appointed}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> High <b>Court</b> in 2001 and <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> of Appeal in January 2004. He was elevated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Supreme <b>Court</b> in 2014.|$|R
5|$|Upon {{his arrival}} in Victoria, Crease was {{admitted}} as a barrister <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> of Vancouver Island and British Columbia, becoming the first lawyer qualified to practice in both jurisdictions. Crease opened a practice in Victoria, sent for his family, and soon found himself travelling with Supreme Court Judge Matthew Baillie Begbie on his first circuit, dealing out justice on the frontier as a Crown prosecutor {{in the midst of}} the Gold Rush.|$|E
5|$|By 1990, 52,000 black {{families}} had been settled on 6.5 million acres. This was insufficient {{to deal with}} the country's overcrowding problem, which was being exacerbated by the growth in the black population. That year, Zimbabwe's parliament passed an amendment allowing the government to expropriate land at a fixed price while denying land-owners the right of appeal <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>courts.</b> The government hoped that by doing so it could settle 110,000 {{black families}} on 13 million acres, which would require the expropriation of approximately half of all white-owned land. Zimbabwe's Commercial Farmers Union argued that the proposed measures would wreck the country's economy, urging the government to instead settle landless blacks on the half-a-million acres of land that was either unproductive or state-owned.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland {{nominated}} 41 lower {{federal court}} judges {{in addition to}} his four Supreme Court justices. These included two judges to the United States circuit courts, nine judges to the United States Courts of Appeals, and 30 judges to the United States district courts. Because Cleveland served terms both before and after Congress eliminated the circuit courts in favor of the Courts of Appeals, he is one of only two presidents to have appointed judges to both bodies. The other, Benjamin Harrison, was in office {{at the time that the}} change was made. Thus, all of Cleveland's appointments to the circuit courts were made in his first term, and all of his appointments <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Courts</b> of Appeals were made in his second.|$|E

5000|$|On December 31, 2003, Radack {{requested}} <b>the</b> <b>court</b> {{appoint a}} special prosecutor <b>to</b> probe <b>the</b> alleged suppression of the emails. The government responded that it had supplied <b>the</b> emails <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> in its initial response <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> order seeking them, i.e., on March 1, 2002. The description of the 24 documents (probably including duplicates) provided <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> at that time matches Radack's emails, including the one that states interviewing Lindh is not authorized by law. DePue, {{the recipient of the}} emails, also had copies and states that they were submitted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>court.</b> <b>The</b> judge rejected Radack's request as [...] "impertinent".|$|R
50|$|Mr Wildenstein objected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> taking jurisdiction, and {{successfully}} applied for <b>the</b> writ <b>to</b> be set aside. The Maharanee appealed against that decision <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> of Appeal.|$|R
5|$|From {{the reign}} of King James I, the {{beginnings}} of a legal profession began to develop and the administration of criminal and civil justice was centralised. The growing activity of the parliament and the centralisation of administration in Scotland called for the better dissemination of Acts of the parliament <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> and other enforcers of the law. Throughout the late fifteenth century, unsuccessful attempts were made to form commissions of experts to codify, update or define Scots law. The legal uncertainty that this situation created prompted increased reliance on the common law found in Canon law, {{and there are a number}} of examples of statutes from this period that clearly drew from Roman law. The general practice during this period, as evidenced from records of cases, seems to have been to defer to specific Scottish laws on a matter when available and to fill in any gaps with provisions from the common law embodied in Civil and Canon law, which had the advantage of being written.|$|E
5|$|In August 1994, Parliament {{intended}} to amend Article 22H {{to restrict the}} President's powers thereunder to only non-constitutional bills which provided for the circumvention or curtailment of the President's discretionary powers conferred upon him by the Constitution. Because Article 5(2A) was not in force, a question arose {{as to whether the}} President had the power under Article 22H(1) to withhold his assent to any bill seeking to amend any of the provisions referred to in Article 5(2A), and specifically to any bill seeking to amend Article 22H. President Ong Teng Cheong stated that in the interest of testing out the system, he wished to have this question referred <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> for a ruling, and that he would accept as correct whatever interpretation of Article 22H was given by the court. In response to his request, Article 100 was inserted into the Constitution by Parliament for that purpose.|$|E
5|$|King's College London {{was founded}} in 1828. The Strand Campus, based next to the church of St Mary-le-Strand, was {{designed}} by Robert Smirke and constructed in 1829–31. King's College Hospital opened as {{a branch of the}} college in 1840, and became a constituent part of the University of London in 1908. The current campus building was constructed in 1966. In 2015, the college acquired Strand House, Bush House and other buildings in the Aldwych Quarter. The Royal Courts of Justice, at the eastern end of the Strand, was designed in the mid-1860s by G.E. Street as a replacement for the older courts at Westminster Hall, though construction was so delayed that he died shortly before Queen Victoria opened the courts in 1882. The West Green extension <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> opened in 1911, while the Queen's Building opened in 1968.|$|E
50|$|A {{stakeholder}} {{may make}} an application <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> for a direction as <b>to</b> whom <b>the</b> stakeholder should pay a debt or money; or give any goods or chattels. The application {{must be made}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> in which an existing claim is pending against the stakeholder, or, if no claim is pending, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> in which <b>the</b> stakeholder might be sued.|$|R
50|$|While it {{was open}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>to</b> read in a notice requirement, <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> found {{that it would be}} {{inappropriate}} in this case due to other concerns about <b>the</b> legislation expressed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> that <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> chose not <b>to</b> rule on.|$|R
50|$|Andreotti was {{completely}} acquitted at first instance, again on appeal <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> of Appeals, and finally on appeal <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> of Cassation in 2004. None of the accusations held up.|$|R
5|$|The Alversund Bridge was a toll bridge {{which was}} {{paying for the}} debt {{accumulated}} in its construction. By 1968, the debt would be paid off, but the Norwegian Public Roads Administration launched a plan whereby the tolls {{would continue to be}} collected and used to finance a bridge across Salhusfjorden. This was opposed by a group of locals, who brought the issue <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>courts,</b> claiming it to be illegal, as a bridge would never be built. Both Oslo District Court and Eidsivating Court of Appeal concluded that the tolls were legal, and the issue was rejected by the Supreme Court. Protests were also raised against the use of a pontoon bridge, as it would limit the vessel size and thus the commercial development in the inner parts of the fjord.|$|E
5|$|The {{powers of}} the President {{in the conduct of}} foreign {{relations}} included the power, without consent of the Senate, to determine the public policy of the United States with respect to the Russian nationalization decrees. What government is to be regarded here as representative of a foreign sovereign state is a political rather than a judicial question, and is to be determined by the political department of the government. That authority is not limited to a determination of the government to be recognized. It includes the power to determine the policy which is to govern the question of recognition. Objections to the underlying policy as well as objections to recognition are to be addressed to the political department and not <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>courts.</b>|$|E
5|$|The rest of Greece {{joined the}} war when Bishop Germanos of Patras {{declared}} Greece in rebellion on March 25. At Kalamata, the Greeks established the Messenian Senate which governed {{affairs in the}} southern Peloponnese. Kolokotronis wanted to attack Tripoli but Petros Mavromichalis convinced him to attack the smaller towns first. Petrobey also sent letters <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> of Europe telling them of the Greeks' plan. Petrobey finished off the letters by signing it with Petrobey Mavromichalis, Prince and Commander-in-Chief. On April 28, the Maniot army joined Kolokotronis forces at Karytainia. From there they went to Tripoli and started to besiege the city. The city eventually fell on September 23, 1821 and was sacked by the Greeks.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Court</b> of Appeal (Civil) Rules 2005 {{set out the}} {{procedural}} requirements for pursuing civil appeals. <b>The</b> <b>Court</b> of Appeal has jurisdiction {{to hear and determine}} appeals from any judgment, decree or order of <b>the</b> High <b>Court.</b> Where <b>the</b> appeal <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> of Appeal is itself an appeal from another <b>court</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> High <b>Court,</b> a further appeal <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> of Appeal is available only if leave to appeal is given by <b>the</b> High <b>Court</b> or, where leave is refused by <b>the</b> High <b>Court,</b> by <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> of Appeal. Appeals on questions of law from <b>the</b> Employment <b>Court</b> can, with <b>the</b> leave of <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> of Appeal, be brought <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> of Appeal.|$|R
5000|$|This {{case was}} then argued before <b>the</b> United States <b>Court</b> of Appeals for the Federal Circuit before circuit Judges Haldane Robert Mayer, Alan David Lourie and Randall R. Rader. Mayer was {{appointed}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> in 1997 and was Chief Judge from 1997 to 2004. [...] Lourie was appointed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> in 1990.

5|$|With the {{disintegration}} of the Vijayanagara Empire in the late 16th and early 17th centuries, the centres of Kannada literature moved <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> of the emerging independent kingdoms, the Kingdom of Mysore and the Keladi Nayakas. Writers in these courts, many of whom were Veerashaiva by faith, were not only adept in Kannada but often also in Sanskrit and/or Telugu. Two such writers were Kalale Nanjaraja and Kempe Gowda, the founder of Bangalore. This multi-linguality was perhaps a lingering legacy of the cosmopolitan Vijayanagara literary culture and the emerging social responsibilities of the Veerashaiva monastic order which no longer confined itself to a Kannada only audience, but rather sought to spread its influence across southern India.|$|E
5|$|Italian, {{and to some}} extant Latin, {{was used}} as the main {{functioning}} language of the courts throughout the periods of the knights, French occupation, British protectorate, until at least 1879 when the courts had already moved out of the building. The French language was established as the sole official language, however an exception was given <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> as Italian prevailed for legal jargon. Efforts by the British to use English during the protectorate and the early colonisation of Malta failed, mostly due to the resistance by the nobility. The supreme court proceeding were suggested to take place with the use of English, to encourage the study and use of English by judges and lawyers, but the efforts were futile. Both during the French occupation and English period, the supreme court decisions were published in Italian and the other preferred language of the government; French during the French period and English during the British periods. The Maltese language was never discussed to be used at the courts when housed in the Castellania. The language question was not solved until the 20th century, when the building had for long changed purpose.|$|E
25|$|The task of {{interpreting}} and enforcing the Charter falls <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>courts,</b> with the Supreme Court of Canada being the ultimate {{authority on the}} matter.|$|E
25|$|Where {{criminal}} matters are concerned, <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> only hears appeals from cases originating in <b>the</b> High <b>Court.</b> Matters heard by <b>the</b> High <b>Court</b> on appeal from <b>the</b> Subordinate <b>Courts</b> cannot be further appealed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> of Appeal, though questions of law may be submitted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> for determination.
