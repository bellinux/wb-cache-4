25|$|After {{the intense}} touring {{that had been}} taking place through the first two albums, working almost 24 hours a day, basically, we managed to stop and have a proper break, {{a couple of months}} as opposed to a couple of weeks. We decided <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>off</b> <b>and</b> rent a cottage to provide a {{contrast}} to motel rooms. Obviously, it had quite an effect on the material that was written... It was the tranquility of the place that set the tone of the album. Obviously, we weren't crashing away at 100 watt Marshall stacks. Having played acoustic and being interested in classical guitar, anyway, being in a cottage without electricity, it was acoustic guitar time... After all the heavy, intense vibe of touring which is reflected in the raw energy of the second album, it was just a totally different feeling.|$|E
500|$|The plan failed. Lee {{began his}} mission with only twenty minutes of air, {{not to mention}} the {{complications}} of operating the craft. The darkness, the speed of the currents, and the added complexities all combined to thwart Lee’s plan. Once surfaced, Lee lit the fuse on the explosive and tried multiple times to stab the device into the underside of the ship. Unfortunately, after several attempts Lee was not able to pierce Eagle’s hull and abandoned the operation as the timer on the explosive was due <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>off</b> <b>and</b> he feared getting caught at dawn. A popular story held that he failed due to the copper lining covering the ship's hull. The Royal Navy had recently begun installing copper sheathing on the bottoms of their warships to protect from damage by woodworms and other marine life, however the lining was paper-thin and could not have stopped Lee from drilling through it. Bushnell believed Lee's failure was probably due to an iron plate connected to the ship's rudder hinge. [...] When Lee attempted another spot in the hull, he was unable to stay beneath the ship, and eventually abandoned the attempt. It seems more likely that he was suffering from fatigue and carbon dioxide inhalation, which made him confused and unable to properly carry out the process of drilling through the Eagles hull. Lee reported British soldiers on Governors Island spotted the submersible and rowed out to investigate. [...] He then released the charge (which he called a [...] "torpedo", the prevailing term for underwater explosive devices prior to about 1890), [...] "expecting that they would seize that likewise, and thus all would be blown to atoms." [...] Suspicious of the drifting charge, the British retreated back to the island. [...] Lee reported that the charge drifted into the East River, where it exploded [...] "with tremendous violence, throwing large columns of water and pieces of wood that composed it high into the air." [...] It was the first recorded use of a submarine to attack a ship; however, the only records documenting it are American. British records contain no accounts of an attack by a submarine or any reports of explosions {{on the night of the}} supposed attack on Eagle.|$|E

Gaston is brought out, but Roger refuses to give him his blessing. Instead, he hands his sword to Gaston urging him to place his hands on its hilt where it forms a cross and then <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>off</b> <b>and</b> fight for the Lord.|$|E
2500|$|Cardiacs {{are also}} renowned for their startling {{performance}} style, {{which has been}} historically integrated (via video work, publicity, interviews and onstage presentation) with a vague and oppressive band mythology. The latter involves Cardiacs' record label and supposed management company, the Alphabet Business Concern - a repressive, controlling organisation (with a marked Edwardian character) which supervises (and restricts) Cardiacs' recording work and live appearances (as well as communicating band news and statements to the band's mailing list in florid and archaic corporatese). Several early 1980s video releases by Cardiacs – in particular The Consultant's Flower Garden and the clip for <b>To</b> <b>Go</b> <b>Off</b> <b>and</b> Things – provided video [...] "evidence" [...] that Alphabet ran Cardiacs' internal affairs {{in the manner of}} an Edwardian children's home (complete with behavioural problems and bullying).|$|E

2500|$|After Gizmo {{finds a way}} out of the vent, Mohawk tortures him {{by beating}} him, {{shocking}} him with an electrical wire, putting him in the photocopier, putting Velcro strips on him and ripping them off, and finally ramming him with a toy train while the other gremlins cause the fire sprinklers <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>off</b> <b>and</b> spawn a gremlin army that throws the building into chaos. Billy attempts to lure the gremlins into the lobby, where sunlight will kill them; after Billy briefs Clamp on gremlin knowledge, Clamp exits through a secret tunnel to cover the front of the building in a giant sheet to trick the creatures. The gremlins devour serums in the lab; one becomes the intelligent Brain Gremlin, who plans to use a [...] "genetic sunblock" [...] serum to immunize them to sunlight. One gremlin turns into a female, while a third becomes pure electricity and is trapped in Clamp's answering machine by Billy. All the while [...] "Grandpa Fred" [...] films the chaos on camera with help from a Japanese tourist named Mr. Katsuji.|$|E
2500|$|In the Bombay High Court, {{the defence}} put forth {{their version of}} the incident, for which there were no {{witnesses}} other than the two men, and no evidence. Hearing Sylvia's confession, an enraged Nanavati wanted to shoot himself, but was calmed down by Sylvia, who {{told him that he}} was not to be blamed and there was no reason that he should shoot himself. Since Sylvia did not tell him whether Prem intended to marry her, Nanavati sought to find it out for himself. When Nanavati met Prem at the latter's bedroom, Prem had just come out of the bath dressed only in a white towel; an angry Nanavati swore at Prem and proceeded to ask him if he intended to marry Sylvia and look after his children. Prem replied, [...] "Will I marry every woman I sleep with?", which further enraged Nanavati. Seeing Nanavati go for the gun, enclosed in a brown packet, Prem too went for it and in the ensuing scuffle, Prem's hand caused the gun <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>off</b> <b>and</b> instantly kill him.|$|E
2500|$|Jones {{stated that}} upon her {{departure}} from Coronation Street, {{that she received}} numerous offers to appear in reality TV programmes, which she declined, quipping: [...] "lots of money <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>off</b> <b>and</b> eat a crocodile's knob, or whatever". Ignoring reality TV offers, in autumn 2005, Jones starred in an ITV's detective drama series Vincent, with Ray Winstone in the title role; this was Jones's first television role since leaving Coronation Street the previous year. In the same year, she starred on the West End stage in A Few Good Men opposite Rob Lowe and John Barrowman, which earned her the Theatregoers' Choice Award for Best Supporting Actress. She also appeared in the musical special Celebrate Oliver! which was screened on BBC1. In 2006, she starred as Snow White in the pantomime Snow White and the Seven Dwarves at the Manchester Opera House alongside Justin Moorhouse and fellow Coronation Street actor John Savident. She also appeared in Kay Mellor's Strictly Confidential in which she played a bisexual sex therapist.|$|E

60|$|A {{great many}} {{advantages}} of female companionship now began to creep into Mrs. Archibald's mind: if her husband {{should take it}} into his head {{to go out and}} hunt at night by the light of a torch; if there should be thunder-storms, and he away with the guide; if he should want <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>off</b> <b>and</b> talk to Indians or trappers, and he always did want <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>off</b> <b>and</b> talk to people of every class--it would be very pleasant to have even Margery Dearborn with her.

60|$|Talking {{of marrying}} agin reminds me o' {{something}} that 'appened {{to a young}} fellow I knew named Alf Simms.

Alf used <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> sea <b>off</b> <b>and</b> on, but more off than on, his uncle 'aving quite a tidy bit of 'ouse property, and it being understood that Alf was to have it arter he 'ad gone. His uncle used to like to 'ave him at 'ome, and Alf didn't like work, so it suited both parties.|$|R
