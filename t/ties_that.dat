5|$|Midshipman David Casey was an {{experienced}} junior {{officer who had}} distinguished himself to Captain Pigot during the previous months, but his disrating {{was one of the}} primary triggers to the mutiny. About a week before the mutiny, Casey was at his station on the main top, and the captain noticed that a gasket, one of the <b>ties</b> <b>that</b> held the sail securely, had not been tied by one of the sailors under his supervision. Casey was brought before the captain, and apologised for the oversight and took responsibility for it. The captain demanded that Casey apologise on his knees, a completely unacceptable and debasing demand for a gentleman. Casey refused to be humiliated in such a way. Pigot offered him one more opportunity and when Casey once more refused, the captain ordered that Casey receive 12 lashes (more commonly a sailor's punishment than that of a junior officer), and he was disrated, which would effectively end his career as a naval officer. Casey was a popular officer amongst the crew and they felt that he was punished unfairly. The topmen began to plot mutiny.|$|E

25|$|<b>Ties</b> <b>That</b> Bind did {{not sell}} {{as well as}} expected, and sold {{significantly}} less than the original game. In November, 2005 Midway announced it would miss its quarterly expectations, specifically citing poor sales of <b>Ties</b> <b>That</b> Bind and L.A. Rush. Midway expected to hit its $30 million revenue target, but expected loses to reach $29 million instead of the previously anticipated $19 million, blaming increased product development costs. For the fiscal year, their revenue expectations dropped from $200 million to $145 million, with expected losses of $95 million. The company ultimately reported a $29.1 million quarterly loss on revenues of $29.5 million.|$|E
25|$|Two major {{gameplay}} {{alterations in}} <b>Ties</b> <b>That</b> Bind concern pickups. Firstly, Torque {{can no longer}} stockpile Xombium bottles, allowing the player to refill their health whenever they wish. Instead, Torque must rely on stationary Xombium located at set points throughout the game. Secondly, the player is limited to carrying only two weapons at any given time, although is free to choose which two; the play may carry two melee weapons, two guns, or one of each. Also, whereas in the first game, Torque could only dual-wield the handgun, in <b>Ties</b> <b>That</b> Bind, he can dual-wield any one handed weapon, including the sawed-off shotgun. Guns {{can also be used}} to inflict minor melee damage.|$|E

25|$|Historically {{first and}} conceptually {{simplest}} is degree centrality, which {{is defined as}} the number of links incident upon a node (i.e., the number of <b>ties</b> <b>that</b> a node has). The degree can be interpreted in terms of the immediate risk of a node for catching whatever is flowing through the network (such as a virus, or some information). In the case of a directed network (where ties have direction), we usually define two separate measures of degree centrality, namely indegree and outdegree. Accordingly, indegree is a count of the number of ties directed to the node and outdegree is the number of <b>ties</b> <b>that</b> the node directs to others. When ties are associated to some positive aspects such as friendship or collaboration, indegree is often interpreted as a form of popularity, and outdegree as gregariousness.|$|E

25|$|The game {{continues}} {{the story of}} Torque, a man sentenced to death for murdering his ex-wife and two children. In the original game, after arriving on death row in Abbot State Penitentiary on Carnate Island, {{off the coast of}} Maryland, an earthquake rocks the island, and the prison is attacked by strange supernatural creatures. During the mayhem, Torque escapes. <b>Ties</b> <b>That</b> Bind continues his story, as he flees the island and heads back to his home town of Baltimore, where he must face his past misdeeds, and confront his nemesis, a mysterious criminal kingpin known as Blackmore. Players who have a saved game from The Suffering can choose one of three different openings, based upon the ending they received in the first game. As with the original game, <b>Ties</b> <b>That</b> Bind also features three different endings, depending on the players' actions throughout the game.|$|E
