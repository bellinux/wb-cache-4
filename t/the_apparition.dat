5|$|Halley's {{apparition}} of 1456 {{was also}} witnessed in Kashmir and depicted {{in great detail}} by Śrīvara, a Sanskrit poet and biographer to the Sultans of Kashmir.

50|$|The Catholic Church {{has made}} {{successive}} {{comments on the}} status of <b>the</b> Medjugorje <b>apparitions.</b> Each has declared non constat; that is, it cannot confirm the supernatural nature of <b>the</b> <b>apparitions</b> and that more study of <b>the</b> <b>apparitions</b> would be needed.

25|$|Dr. Pierre Romaine Dozous, {{the town}} physician, {{originally}} watched <b>the</b> <b>apparitions</b> from a skeptical viewpoint. He believed Soubirous, whom he knew well, {{was in her}} right mind aside from <b>the</b> <b>apparitions.</b>|$|R

5|$|According to Lafcadio Hearn, a {{butterfly}} {{was seen in}} Japan as the personification of a person's soul; whether they be living, dying, or already dead. One Japanese superstition says that if {{a butterfly}} enters your guest room and perches behind the bamboo screen, the person whom you most love is coming to see you. Large numbers of butterflies are viewed as bad omens. When Taira no Masakado was secretly preparing for his famous revolt, there appeared in Kyoto so vast a swarm of butterflies that the people were frightened— thinking <b>the</b> <b>apparition</b> to be a portent of coming evil.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>apparition</b> of 12BC was {{recorded}} in the Book of Han by Chinese astronomers of the Han Dynasty who tracked it from August through October. It passed within 0.16AU of Earth. Halley's appearance in 12BC, {{only a few years}} distant from the conventionally assigned date of the birth of Jesus Christ, has led some theologians and astronomers to suggest that it might explain the biblical story of the Star of Bethlehem. There are other explanations for the phenomenon, such as planetary conjunctions, and there are also records of other comets that appeared closer to the date of Jesus' birth.|$|E
5|$|When Macbeth {{returns to}} the witches later in the play, they show him an {{apparition}} of the murdered Banquo, along with eight kings of his family, descending through Fleance. King James, on the throne when Macbeth was written, was the ninth Stuart king. This scene thus suggests strong support for James' right to the throne by lineage, and for audiences of Shakespeare's day, was a tangible fulfilment of the witches' prophecy. <b>The</b> <b>apparition</b> is also deeply unsettling to Macbeth, who not only wants the throne for himself, but also desires to father a line of kings.|$|E

5|$|As he {{nears the}} cabin, the {{imaginary}} Barry appears and tells Alan {{that he will}} have to reject all the illusions before he can face off against the insane version of Alan, including <b>the</b> <b>apparition</b> of Barry. Alan is ready to accept that, forcing Alan to fight Taken illusions of Dr. Hartman, Barry, and the Andersons, defeating them all before he is able to reenter the cabin. His crazed side is in a paranoid state on the cabin floor, and when Alan touches him, the two are made whole again. Alan realizes that he cannot let himself fall into a delusional state again for fear of never being able to escape, and returns to the typewriter to start a new story—"Return".|$|E
5|$|In another project, {{the village}} of La Vang in Quảng Trị Province near the border with North Vietnam, {{was the scene of}} a female {{apparition}} in the late 19th century. Buddhists claimed that the bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara (also known as Kuanyin; Vietnamese: Quan Âm) performed the miracle. Diệm's brother, Ngô Đình Thục, was the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Huế and the foremost religious figure in South Vietnam's nepotistic regime. Thục declared that <b>the</b> <b>apparition</b> was the Virgin Mary, and ordered that a cathedral be built in place of the makeshift Buddhist pagoda that occupied the site. Thơ made notable financial donations to the project for political reasons.|$|E
5|$|Hugh Ross Williamson cites a {{tale about}} St. Collen, {{one of the}} {{earliest}} hermits to inhabit the Tor before the Abbey was built by St. Patrick, which has the Saint summoned by the King of the Fairies, Gwyn, to the summit of the Tor. Upon arrival there he beholds a hovering mansion inhabited by handsomely dressed courtiers and King Gwyn on a throne of gold; holy water disperses <b>the</b> <b>apparition.</b> This is from Druid mythology, in which the mansion is made of glass so as to receive the spirits of the dead, which were supposed to depart from the summit of the Tor. This was the chief reason why the chapel, and later the church, of St. Michael were built on the high hill; St. Michael being the chief patron against diabolic attacks which the monks believed the Fairy King to be numbered among. Accordingly, Williamson posits that the Tor was named after the glassy mansion of the dead.|$|E

5|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1927, Messiaen joined Dupré's organ course. Dupré later wrote that Messiaen, having never seen an organ console, sat quietly for an hour while Dupré {{explained}} and demonstrated the instrument, and then came back a week later to play Johann Sebastian Bach's Fantasia in C minor to an impressive standard. From 1929, Messiaen regularly deputised at the Église de la Sainte-Trinité, Paris, for the organist Charles Quef, who was ill at the time. The post became vacant in 1931 when Quef died, and Dupré, Charles Tournemire and Widor among others supported Messiaen's candidacy. His formal application included a letter of recommendation from Widor. The appointment was confirmed in 1931, and he remained the organist at the church for more than sixty years. He also assumed a post at the Schola Cantorum de Paris in the early 1930s. In 1932, he composed <b>the</b> <b>Apparition</b> de l'église éternelle for organ.|$|E
5|$|The fort is {{supposedly}} {{haunted by the}} Black Knight, who wears the armour and regalia of the Order of St. John, and resembles Grand Master de Vilhena. In the 1940s, the knight began to appear {{out of thin air}} near the ruins of the Chapel of St. Anthony of Padua, which had just been bombed in World War II. <b>The</b> <b>apparition</b> was reportedly seen by Maltese and English men within the fort. When the rubble from the ruined chapel began to be cleared, the workmen reported that the knight was supervising their work. When the crypt beneath the chapel was opened, it was found that it had been vandalized, and the remains of knights which had been buried there were scattered around. After the crypt was restored and the bones were reburied, the Black Knight stopped appearing. In 1980, the crypt was vandalized for a second time, and the Black Knight reportedly began to appear again.|$|E
25|$|Those who {{witnessed}} <b>the</b> <b>apparition</b> {{stood in the}} pouring rain {{for up to two}} hours reciting the Rosary, a series of traditional Catholic prayers. When <b>the</b> <b>apparition</b> began there was good light, but although it then became very dark, witnesses could still see the figures very clearly – they appeared to be the colour of a bright whitish light. <b>The</b> <b>apparition</b> did not flicker or move in any way. The witnesses reported that the ground around the figures remained completely dry during <b>the</b> <b>apparition</b> although the wind was blowing from the south. Afterwards, however the ground at the gable became wet and the gable dark.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>apparitions</b> were {{unusual in}} that the weeping statue of the Virgin Mary was {{broadcast}} on Japanese national television, and gained further notoriety with the sudden healing of hearing impairment experienced by Sasagawa after <b>the</b> <b>apparitions.</b> <b>The</b> image also became affiliated with the devotion to Our Lady of All Nations venerated in Amsterdam, from which the image shares close similarities.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>apparitions</b> {{reportedly}} {{occurred in}} December 1982, and January, February and March 1983.

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Apparition</b> did {{not speak}} until the third appearance, and {{therefore}} its identity {{was a matter of}} considerable speculation. Pious villagers Jeanne-Marie Milhet and Antoinette Peyret, on hearing Soubirous' description of <b>the</b> <b>apparition,</b> thought it was the returning spirit of one of their friends, who had died a few months before. Although not part of Catholic doctrine, the concept of the revenant was deeply rooted in Pyrenean superstition. According to tradition, revenants rarely spoke, but communicated their messages in writing, and so Milhet and Peyret furnished Soubirous with paper, a pen, and an inkpot to take with her, in case <b>the</b> <b>apparition</b> should make use of them.|$|E

25|$|The {{parish priest}} {{at the time}} of <b>the</b> <b>apparition</b> was The Very Reverend Bartholomew Aloysius Cavanagh, who was also Archdeacon of the diocese.

She, like the boys’ parents, could also not see <b>the</b> <b>apparition,</b> and called for two girls, Françoise Richer and Jeanne-Marie Lebosse, aged nine and eleven. Sister Vitaline suggested that perhaps Our Lady was visible only to the children.
