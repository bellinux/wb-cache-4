Although <b>white</b> <b>pine</b> regeneration is occurring in these second-growth oak forests, <b>white</b> <b>pine</b> regeneration patterns in oak forests of the Great Lakes region are not well documented. We examined <b>white</b> <b>pine</b> regeneration in the southern Great Lakes region in an oak stand within the Oak Openings region of northwestern Ohio, where <b>white</b> <b>pine</b> plantations established in the 1940 s have served as seed sources for <b>white</b> <b>pine</b> invasion of surrounding oak-dominated forests. <b>White</b> <b>pine</b> regeneration was aggregated in high-density clumps 2 ̆ 7 in the oak stand, with a mean <b>white</b> <b>pine</b> to <b>white</b> <b>pine</b> nearest-neighbor distance of 1. 8 m.

No <b>white</b> <b>pine</b> recruitment has occurred in the oak stand in the last 15 yr since the 6 -yr establishment interval, and we hypothesize that favorable <b>white</b> <b>pine</b> colonization sites in the oak stand were occupied during the initial invasion event. <b>White</b> <b>pine</b> regeneration in these oak forests may proceed in 2 ̆ 2 leaps and bounds, 2 ̆ 2 with <b>white</b> <b>pine</b> expanding 100 - 300 m by clumped regeneration into new areas during unique regeneration events. <b>White</b> <b>pine</b> 2 ̆ 7 s present ability to reproduce successfully in northwestern Ohio appears related to reductions of historic fire frequencies...|$|R

50|$|Macrocyclic Disease: Developing a {{management}} plan {{for this type}} of disease depends largely on whether the repeating stage (urediniospores) occur on the economically important host plant or the alternate host. For example, the repeating stage in <b>white</b> <b>pine</b> blister rust disease does not occur on <b>white</b> <b>pines</b> but on the alternate host, Ribes spp. During August and September Ribes spp. give rise to teliospores which infect <b>white</b> <b>pines.</b> Removal of the alternate host disrupts the life cycle of the rust fungi Cronartium ribicola, preventing the formation of basidiospores which infect the primary host. Although spores from <b>white</b> <b>pines</b> cannot infect other <b>white</b> <b>pines,</b> survival spores may overwinter on infected pines and reinfect Ribes spp. the following season. Infected tissue is removed from <b>white</b> <b>pines</b> and strict quarantines of Ribes spp. are maintained in high risk areas.|$|R
40|$|Eastern <b>white</b> <b>pine</b> (Pinus strobus) has {{decreased}} in abundance {{over the past}} century throughout the Great Lakes Region of North America, but the relative constraints placed on recruitment under contrasting disturbance regimes are not well understood. The objectives of this study were {{to determine the extent to}} which <b>white</b> <b>pine</b> could invade areas recently disturbed by fire or logging (within 10 – 28 years), and assess the relative limitations placed on recruitment by seed supply, microsite habitat, and competition. We compared <b>white</b> <b>pine</b> regeneration on 61 sites disturbed by fire or logging that were adjacent to intact mature stands that provided a seed source. <b>White</b> <b>pine</b> seedling and sapling densities declined with increasing distance from a seed source, and the rate of decrease was determined by the interaction between seed supply and variation in number and quality of safe sites. For a given combination of seed source and site, <b>white</b> <b>pine</b> seedlings were three times more abundant on burned than logged sites. <b>White</b> <b>pine</b> seedlings grew into the sapling size class more often on burned than logged sites due to lower shrub cover on burned sites.
