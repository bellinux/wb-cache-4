5|$|Flowers {{have converged}} to take {{advantage}} of similar birds. Flowers compete for pollinators, and adaptations reduce unfavourable effects of <b>this</b> <b>competition.</b> The fact that birds can fly during inclement weather makes them more efficient pollinators where bees and other insects would be inactive. Ornithophily may have arisen for this reason in isolated environments with poor insect colonization or areas with plants which flower in the winter. Bird-pollinated flowers usually have higher volumes of nectar and higher sugar production than those pollinated by insects.|$|E
