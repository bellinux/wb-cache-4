5000|$|After 42 episodes, World History {{concluded}} on November 9, 2012. On June 27, 2014, {{in a video}} preview, John Green announced World History {{would return}} for a second season, lasting 30 episodes. Ultimately, the second season ended on Apr 4, 2015.

He <b>thanks</b> viewers <b>for</b> <b>watching</b> the Events series, and passes over to a live feed inside the casino, filmed using concealed cameras.

5000|$|Most half-hour episodes {{contain a}} mock song parody and music video in the [...] "Soundtrack of Science" [...] by [...] "Not That Bad Records". [...] "Not that bad" [...] is a catchphrase that Nye will often say in those episodes, substituting a {{scientific}} roundup {{of the episode}} for the lyrics to a popular song. This is usually the last segment of each episode. Each half-hour show ends with Nye saying, [...] "Well, that's our show. <b>Thanks</b> <b>for</b> <b>watching.</b> If you'll excuse me, I've got some..." [...] before explaining his departure in a clever description of an activity on topic, followed by him saying [...] "See ya!" [...] afterwards. After that, a female announcer says [...] "Produced {{in association with the}} National Science Foundation". The credits sometimes rolled next to a series of outtakes from the episode. Other times, outtakes are shown at the time they actually happened.|$|E

50|$|Pierce's {{educational}} pursuits {{extend beyond}} the formal classroom, particularly her studies in the African Diaspora history. Early exposure to Africa was provided when as a child her paternal aunt, Dorothy DeLeaver Gibrilla, who was from {{the small town of}} White Stone, Virginia, married Claudius Adelejou Gibrilla of Sierra Leone, West Africa in 1937. When his country declared independence from Britain, Claude Gibrilla was named Consul General for New York. Pierce developed an appreciation of African-Americans' relationship to Africa through her frequent interactions with the Gibrillas. Mrs. Gibrilla gave Pierce the Yoruba name Modupe, meaning “I give <b>thanks</b> to God <b>for</b> <b>watching</b> over me.” Pierce's interest in the condition of black lives throughout the African Diaspora and the effects of African culture on the world later influenced her research projects and lectures.|$|R

40|$|Firstly, before {{anything}} else, I’d {{like to thank}} Jesus Christ. This degree, my job, my wife, my family … they were all His ideas. My greatest hope is that He will be pleased with all that I have done with what He gave me. Next, I’d like to thank my wife Maryanne. I love her more every day, and even though we’re still just starting what will hopefully be a long road together, being with her it feels like we’ve been friends forever. Thank you for being my support {{every day of the}} week. (Also, <b>thanks</b> <b>for</b> <b>watching</b> baby Hannah all day while I’m gone doing research! I like to come home and just be the “fun parent”.) I’ve already dedicated this work to my parents, but I feel that they deserve extra thanks for taking me {{all the way to the}} doorstep of reality before I took my first steps into the “grown-up ” world. All of my work ethic and determination comes from seeing both my parents push themselves towards excellence all my life. Greg Durgin has been an incredible advisor so far in my graduate career. He is ever the cheerleader for his students and a true master at helping fragile ideas blossom into great research. I hope to someday be an equally energetic and caring advisor for students of my own. Now to thank all my friends at Motorola! First, I have to say thanks to the whol...|$|E

50|$|Andy, Chris, and Ed (who is {{revealed}} {{to have the}} same tattoo as Andy's killer) plan the robbery on Tuesday despite Steph's attempts to talk them out of it. After an argument over Ed's involvement in their son's death, Ed says the heist is the only way for them to escape their current life. Dawkins, who owns the bank, reluctantly gives the safe's combination to Ed in return for Ed's promise to give him the tape. After loading the bank's vault with money, Dawkins <b>thanks</b> Zeke <b>for</b> personally <b>watching</b> it overnight. Before leaving, Dawkins suggests that Zeke kill anyone who attempts to rob it instead of arresting them. As Zeke reads a book, Ed and Andy break into the bank and take Zeke hostage. Once Ed has the situation under control, Andy leaves to watch the door. Zeke easily sees through Ed's disguise and taunts him. After freeing himself, Zeke shoots Ed with a gun hidden in the paper bag that holds his dinner and reveals that Steph and he are the parents of the dead child. Steph and Zeke, whom we see has the same tattoo as Andy's killer, planned to kill everyone responsible for their child's death once they learned of Ed's return to criminal activity. After hiding Ed's body, Zeke asks Steph to shoot him, and he begins his investigation.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the third}} film J {{has become a}} well-respected, Rank A MIB agent in the year 2012. He {{continues}} to work with K, but is frustrated by the secrets K keeps from him for his own good, leading to frustration in their relationship. The escaped alien criminal Boris the Animal time-travels back to 1969 and murders a young K, which {{could result in the}} end of the world as K was no longer present to establish a force-field that could permanently protect Earth from invasion by Boris's species. Thanks to [...] "being there" [...] when the major moment in history changed (the installation of the ArcNet), J was able to retain all memory of K. J travels back to 1969 to save K, although hampered by his lack of knowledge of K's personal life or the specific details of the case that killed him. To keep the present unchanged by Boris's interference, J advises K to kill the Boglodite instead of arresting him as in the original timeline. J is also stunned to discover that K's past self is much more open and friendly than his present version. With the help of an alien named Griffin and a US Army Colonel that Griffin gets to help them, J and K reach the Apollo 11 launch site and separately fight the Borises to launch the ArcNet. Using his time travel device, J defeats the elder Boris and ensures the restoration of the timeline. Future Boris is killed by Apollo 11's exhaust and the ArcNet is successfully deployed, but before he can return to the future, J witnesses the past Boris murdering the colonel that had helped them. K kills the younger Boris and J discovers to his shock that the colonel was his own father. J witnesses K comfort his past self and then neuralyze him and tell the young James that his father is a hero. Finally understanding what K was trying to protect him from, J returns to the present where he indicates his knowledge of what happened to K and <b>thanks</b> him <b>for</b> <b>watching</b> out <b>for</b> him. K tells him its been his privilege to <b>watch</b> out <b>for</b> J all these years.|$|R
