50|$|Repinaella is {{closest to}} the common {{ancestor}} with the other Olenellina. Second to split away is the Daguinaspididae-family, which comprises the closely knit group of Choubertella, Daguinaspis and Wolynaspis, with Eofallotaspis slightly further removed, and near the basis a subgroup consisting of Profallotaspis and Pelmanaspis. The monotypical family Fallotaspididae is next <b>to</b> <b>branch-off.</b> This {{is followed by the}} branch of Parafallotaspis all on its own, followed by the monotypical family Archaeaspididae. Finally Fallotaspidella {{is closest to}} the trilobites with dorsal cephalic sutures, such as Bigotina and Lemdadella.|$|E
50|$|Recent genetic {{research}} suggests that the Fabroniaceae are the sistergroup of all other hypnales. Next <b>to</b> <b>branch-off</b> are the Catagoniaceae. According to this analysis, some of the remaining taxa may be polyphyletic (Lembophyllaceae, Neckeraceae, Brachytheciaceae), others paraphyletic (Lepyrodontaceae enclose Stereophyllaceae, part of the Brachytheciaceae enclose Symphyodontaceae and two separate parts of the Lembophyllaceae, part of the Neckeraceae enclose the remaining Brachytheciaceae, another part of the Lembophyllaceae enclose Rigodiaceae and Pterigynandraceae and a second part of the Neckeraceae). The rest of the families, the third part of the Neckeraceae and the fourth part of the Lembophyllaceae could be monophyletic.|$|E
50|$|Before {{reaching}} Gospođinci, {{the main}} line was to split. One route would continue through Serbia and Hungary to Baumgarten an der March in Austria. Another route would have continued through Gospođinci and Bački Breg also <b>to</b> Hungary with <b>branch-off</b> <b>to</b> Croatia. In Hungary it would have gone through Hercegszántó and Tornyiszentmiklós to Slovenia and further in direction of Tarvisio to supply northern Italy.|$|R
5000|$|Originally {{purchased}} by the Viennese banker Salomon Mayer von Rothschild in 1843, he also financed {{the extension of the}} Emperor Ferdinand Northern Railway from Vienna to Ostrava with a <b>branch-off</b> <b>to</b> his steel mill, which was completed in 1855.|$|R
40|$|We {{report a}} case of an {{uncommon}} giant pseudoaneurysm of the gastroduodenal artery secondary to chronic pancreatitis. It presented with a perfused volume of 17. 3 cm 3 close <b>to</b> the <b>branch-off</b> of the right hepatic artery. Superselective transcatheter embolization including interlocking detachable coils and a mixture of Ethibloc and Lipiodol was our technique of choice. Following the procedure, the patient was in hemodynamically stable condition. At that time, he was free of any clinical symptoms and showed no further signs of bleeding or ischaemia. Additionally, we present {{an overview of the}} relevant literature...|$|R
5000|$|At {{the same}} time the station Wilhelmplatz (today: Richard-Wagner-Platz) was put in {{operation}} as the western terminus. The architect Alfred Grenander had designed Germany's first U-Bahn station with four tracks, in consideration of the future <b>branch-off</b> <b>to</b> Reichskanzlerplatz (today: Theodor-Heuss-Platz) in Westend that went into service on 29 March 1908.|$|R
50|$|The area {{is located}} in the {{historic}} Goriška region, itself part of the larger Slovene Littoral, about 41 km north of Nova Gorica and 87 km west of the Slovene capital Ljubljana. In the north, the road leads further up the Soča River to Bovec, with an eastern <b>branch-off</b> <b>to</b> Škofja Loka and Idrija.|$|R
50|$|In 1841 Jüterbog station {{received}} {{access to}} the Berlin-Anhalt Railway line. Today the station {{is located at the}} junction of the railway line from Berlin to Wittenberg and a <b>branch-off</b> <b>to</b> Falkenberg/Elster, all served by Regional-Express trains of the Deutsche Bahn company. A third railway connection to Beelitz and Berlin-Wannsee is provided by the private Veolia Verkehr company.|$|R
50|$|The station {{opened with}} the Nordbahn (Northern Railway) from Berlin to Neubrandenburg on 10 July 1877, then called Dalldorf, the former name of Wittenau until 1905. When a second railway station in Dalldorf was erected at the <b>branch-off</b> <b>to</b> Kremmen in 1893, it {{received}} the appendix (Nordbahn). On 5 June 1925 Wittenau (Nordbahn) {{was connected to}} the S-Bahn network.|$|R
50|$|The Main {{line for}} Europe (referred {{to as the}} Magistrale für Europa in German and Magistrale européenne in French) is a Trans-European Transport Networks (TEN-T) project for the {{creation}} of a high-speed railway line between Paris and Bratislava, with a <b>branch-off</b> <b>to</b> Budapest. It was listed as TEN project No. 17 (Paris—Bratislava) by the European Commission in 1995, and is already under way.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} form a {{junction}} between this line and their existing railway network, the CME extracted a concession from the Prussian state to make Wanne station, a station which lay on the CME's main route from Cologne <b>to</b> Minden, the <b>branch-off</b> point for the line to Hamburg, {{in order to be}} able to build the line to Venlo from Haltern about 25 km to the north (see Haltern-Venlo railway).|$|R
50|$|The {{line has}} been {{upgraded}} to double track throughout and both tracks may be worked in bi-directional running. The entire route is electrified and is powered by 15,000 Volt alternating current and a frequency of 16.7 Hertz. In particular the S-train section from Salzburg Hauptbahnhof <b>to</b> the southern <b>branch-off</b> of the Tauern Railway line at Schwarzach-St. Veit was given a major upgrade and, in places, entirely rebuilt and re-routed.|$|R
50|$|While the {{connection}} between Vienna and Graz, partly provided by ÖBB Railjet high-speed trains, is busy, international passenger traffic to Trieste has decreased in past decades. Nevertheless, the railway is to be developed by the Semmering Base Tunnel and the Koralm Railway <b>branch-off</b> <b>to</b> Klagenfurt, Carinthia. The section from Graz to the Slovenian border, which had been downgraded to a single track railway in the 1950s, is currently again enlarged to double track.|$|R
50|$|Mass tourism was decisively {{promoted}} by the scenic High Alpine Road (Großglockner-Hochalpenstraße) running from Heiligenblut to Bruck in Salzburg with a <b>branch-off</b> <b>to</b> the Franz-Josefs-Höhe viewpoint. It was built across the historic Hochtor Pass of the Alpine divide between 1930 and 1935 according to plans designed by engineer Franz Wallack. The pass road, Austria's highest, reaches 2576 m, {{and is one of}} the most popular tourist attractions in the country (second after Schönbrunn Palace) with about 270,000 vehicles and 900,000 visitors every year, about 50 million since its opening.|$|R
5000|$|Archaeological {{excavations}} in {{the area}} {{date back to the}} Iron Age Jastorf culture about 600-300 BC. The settlement its welf was first documented in 1196, probably named after a ford crossing the Ohre river at the place where today still is a bridge. A trade route which came from Leipzig and Magdeburg in the southeast crossed the river here, leading northwestwards to Lüneburg and Hamburg, with a <b>branch-off</b> <b>to</b> Braunschweig in the west. Calvörde is possibly derived from [...] "bleak (kahl) ford", however, according to local tradition, the emergence of the ford is attributed to a man named Kale and the historic meaning is [...] "Kale's ford".|$|R
5000|$|From 1806, Asch with Bohemia {{belonged to}} the Austrian Empire and Cisleithanian Austria after the Compromise of 1867. Until 1918, the town {{remained}} part of the Austria-Hungary, head of the Asch district, one of the 94 Bezirkshauptmannschaften in Bohemia. In 1854 a county legal code was granted to the region, ending five centuries of legal control by the Zedtwitz family. Asch {{was linked to the}} Eger (Cheb)-Hof railway line in 1864, with a <b>branch-off</b> <b>to</b> Saxon Adorf opened in 1885. It obtained the status of a town in 1872, as the population grew due to a flourishing textile industry. By 1910 the population rose to 21.880, from 9.405 in 1869 ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{iron works}} were {{continuously}} enlarged and finally {{purchased by the}} Viennese banker Salomon Mayer von Rothschild in 1843. He also financed {{the extension of the}} Emperor Ferdinand Northern Railway from Vienna to Ostrava with a <b>branch-off</b> <b>to</b> his steel mill, which was completed in 1855. His Rothschild heirs in 1873 founded the Witkowitzer Bergbau- und Hüttengewerkschaft, the largest iron and steel works in the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy. After the German occupation of Czechoslovakia in 1939, their possessions were [...] "aryanized" [...] and taken over by the Reichswerke Hermann Göring conglomerate. After World War II they were socialised as the Vítkovické železárny Klement Gottwald n.p. (VŽKG) by the Czechoslovak state.|$|R
25|$|A {{first guest}} from Vienna is {{documented}} in 1869, arriving by train at the Villach railway terminus and {{staying at the}} local inn. From about 1870 onwards Millstatt developed from a sedate village to a fashionable summer resort for the nobility and the wealthy bourgeoisie of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. It was in this year when wealthy publisher and son of an old Bohemian glass manufacturing dynasty, Rudolf Schürer von Waldheim, came to Millstatt to build the first hotel in town, the Hotel See-Villa according to plans designed by architect Karl Mayreder in 1883-84. The area gained {{direct access to the}} Austrian Southern Railway line by the opening of the <b>branch-off</b> <b>to</b> nearby Spittal-Millstättersee station in 1873, followed by the inauguration of the Tauern Railway line in 1909.|$|R
50|$|The present-day {{settlement}} {{may have}} arisen from a mansio called Bilachium on the Roman road from Sanctium (Villach) along the Drava River up to Littamum (Innichen), {{at the southern}} <b>branch-off</b> <b>to</b> the Kreuzbergsattel Pass. Greifenburg Castle was first mentioned in an 1166 deed; then located within the lands held by the Counts of Görz (Gorizia), it was acquired by the Carinthian duke Bernhard von Spanheim about 1230. Duke Bernhard maintained Greifenburg, defeating the united troops of Count Meinhard I of Görz and his father-in-law Count Albert IV of Tyrol with the support from his son Archbishop Philip of Salzburg in 1252. Vested with market rights in 1267, Greifenburg nevertheless fell to the House of Gorizia, when upon the extinction of the Sponheim dynasty the Habsburg king Rudolph I of Germany enfeoffed Count Meinhard's son, Meinhard II, with the Carinthian duchy in 1286. Duke Meinhard II died at Greifenburg Castle in 1295.|$|R
50|$|When in 1525 Bishop George of Polentz waived his rights, his Fischhausen {{residence}} {{was incorporated}} into the secular Duchy of Prussia. On 12 February 1526, the Hohenzollern duke Albert, former Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights, married Princess Dorothea of Denmark at the Fischhausen Castle chapel. The fortress became the residence of his mentally disabled son Albert Frederick {{until his death in}} 1618. Afterwards, the castle decayed and was finally demolished by order of King Frederick I of Prussia, who had its stones used for the expansion of the nearby Pillau fortress. Upon the re-organisation of the Prussian lands after the Congress of Vienna, Fischhausen became the administrative seat of a district (Kreis Fischhausen) within the Province of East Prussia in 1818. A station on the East Prussian Southern Railway line from Königsberg to Pillau with a <b>branch-off</b> <b>to</b> Palmnicken (Yantarny) on the Amber Coast was inaugurated in 1865. According to the German 1939 census, the town's population was 3,879.|$|R
50|$|As {{early as}} 1829, Austrian railway pioneer Franz Xaver Riepl {{proposed}} a railway connection from Vienna to the Adriatic Sea, bypassing the Eastern Alps and running via Bruck an der Leitha, Magyaróvár and Szombathely in Western Hungary, Maribor and Ljubljana to Trieste. His plans were adopted by entrepreneur Georgios Sinas, who in 1836 had engineer Matthias von Schönerer build the first stretch of line from Vienna to Győr (Raab), Hungary with a <b>branch-off</b> <b>to</b> Bratislava.At {{the same time}} plans for a direct connection through the Alps were developed and promoted by Archduke John of Austria {{to open up the}} Styrian lands beyond Semmering Pass. In 1838, Sinas established the private Wien-Raaber Eisenbahn (WRB) company with 12.5M guilders of share capital. Departing from the original plans of a connection via Hungary, the next year construction works started on the initial section which ran southwards between Baden, Lower Austria and Wiener Neustadt and opened on 16 May 1841. Schönerer had travelled to the US, where he purchased a used steam locomotive named Philadelphia, built by the Norris Locomotive Works in 1837.|$|R
