5|$|Bernard Lovell {{built the}} Transit <b>Telescope</b> at Jodrell Bank {{in the late}} 1940s. This was a -diameter radio <b>telescope</b> that could only point {{directly}} upwards; {{the next logical step}} was to build a <b>telescope</b> that could look at all parts of the sky so that more sources could be observed, as well as for longer integration times. Although the Transit <b>Telescope</b> had been designed and constructed by the astronomers that used it, a fully steerable <b>telescope</b> would need to be professionally designed and constructed; the first challenge was to find an engineer willing to do the job. This turned out to be Charles Husband, whom Lovell first met on 8 September 1949.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, {{following}} {{the resumption of}} shuttle flights in 1988, {{the launch of the}} <b>telescope</b> was scheduled for 1990. On April 24, 1990, shuttle mission STS-31 saw Discovery launch the <b>telescope</b> successfully into its planned orbit.|$|E

5|$|Funds were {{provided}} {{for the purchase of}} a 6-inch (150mm) refracting <b>telescope</b> from T. Cooke & Sons. The dome was originally designed to mount a small transit, and the lengthy <b>telescope,</b> over 2 metres long, had a limited field of view though the dome's opening. A large stone pillar was constructed inside the tower, raising the <b>telescope</b> to bring it closer to the dome and improve its field of view. Unfortunately, the new <b>telescope</b> was unable {{to take part in the}} transit measurements due to bad weather, and missed the 1895 Transit of Mercury for the same reason.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Advances in {{communications}} and electronics {{have made it}} possible to operate completely automatic <b>telescopes</b> reliably. This mode of operation lets one use moderately small <b>telescopes</b> to conduct research projects that would simply not be practicable otherwise. The principal advantages of automated observing, a) the ability to monitor objects over long times, b) flexibility of scheduling, and c) high productivity, are interrelated. We have operated state-of-the-art automatic photometric <b>telescopes</b> over the past fifteen years and are now adding automatic imaging and spectroscopic <b>telescopes</b> to give an integrated automatic observatory.

5|$|Further {{concepts}} {{for advanced}} 21st-century space telescopes include the Advanced Technology Large-Aperture Space <b>Telescope,</b> a conceptualized 8- to 16-meter (320- to 640-inch) optical space <b>telescope</b> that if realized {{could be a}} more direct successor to HST, {{with the ability to}} observe and photograph astronomical objects in the visible, ultraviolet, and infrared wavelengths, with substantially better resolution than Hubble or the Spitzer Space <b>telescope.</b> This effort is being planned for the 2025â€“2035 time frame.|$|E
5|$|In 2007 the <b>telescope</b> {{needed a}} new drive wheel, {{as one of the}} 64 {{original}} wheels had cracked; in 2008 another new steel tyre was needed after a second wheel cracked. These are the only two wheel changes needed since the <b>telescope</b> started operation in 1957.|$|E
5|$|Interferometry at Jodrell Bank started {{before the}} Lovell <b>telescope</b> was constructed, using the Transit <b>Telescope</b> with a 35 square meter {{broadside}} array {{to determine the}} size of radio-loud nebulae. Once construction of the Lovell <b>telescope</b> was complete, the broadside array was put on a steerable mount and the pair were used as a tracking radio interferometer. This was then {{used to determine the}} 2D shape of quasars on the sky.Rowson (1963) In the summer of 1961, a 25-foot (8-m) diameter paraboloid <b>telescope</b> was constructed (it was made of aluminium tubing and was mounted on the rotating structure of an old defence radar). This was then used as a steerable interferometer with the Mark I, with a resolution of 0.3 arcseconds, to determine the sizes of some high-redshift (z~0.86) quasars.|$|E

50|$|Active optics is a {{technology}} used with reflecting <b>telescopes</b> {{developed in the}} 1980s, which actively shapes a <b>telescope's</b> mirrors to prevent deformation due to external influences such as wind, temperature, mechanical stress. Without active optics, the construction of 8 metre class <b>telescopes</b> is not possible, nor would <b>telescopes</b> with segmented mirrors be feasible.|$|R

5|$|Once the Space <b>Telescope</b> {{project had}} been given the go-ahead, work on the program was divided among many institutions. Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) was given {{responsibility}} for the design, development, and construction of the <b>telescope,</b> while Goddard Space Flight Center was given overall control of the scientific instruments and ground-control center for the mission. MSFC commissioned the optics company Perkin-Elmer to design and build the Optical <b>Telescope</b> Assembly (OTA) and Fine Guidance Sensors for the space <b>telescope.</b> Lockheed was commissioned to construct and integrate the spacecraft in which the <b>telescope</b> would be housed.|$|E
5|$|STS-125, or HST-SM4 (Hubble Space <b>Telescope</b> Servicing Mission 4), was {{the fifth}} and final space shuttle mission to the Hubble Space <b>Telescope</b> (HST).|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} <b>telescope</b> was {{originally}} completed, Lovell and Husband started contemplating {{the idea of}} upgrading the <b>telescope</b> so {{that it had a}} more accurate surface, and was controlled by a digital computer. Plans for this upgrade were created by Husband and Co., and were presented to Lovell in April 1964. Their plans became more urgent when fatigue cracks were discovered in the elevation drive system in September 1967. The <b>telescope</b> was only expected to have an operational lifespan of 10 years, and Husband had been warning about the decay of the <b>telescope</b> since 1963. The appearance of fatigue cracks was the first of these problems that threatened to stop the <b>telescope</b> working; if tey had not been put right, then the elevation system could have failed and perhaps jammed. The <b>telescope</b> was therefore repaired and upgraded to become the Mark IA; the Â£400,000 of funding to do this was announced on 8 July 1968 by the SRC. The upgrade was carried out in three phases, phase 1 lasting between September 1968 and February 1969, phase 2 between September and November 1969 and phase 3 between August 1970 and November 1971.|$|E
25|$|Since {{crafting}} large lenses is {{much more}} difficult than crafting large mirrors, most modern <b>telescopes</b> are reflecting <b>telescopes,</b> that is, <b>telescopes</b> that use a primary mirror rather than an objective lens. The same general optical considerations apply to reflecting <b>telescopes</b> that applied to refracting <b>telescopes,</b> namely, the larger the primary mirror, the more light collected, and the magnification is still equal to the focal length of the primary mirror divided by the focal length of the eyepiece. Professional <b>telescopes</b> generally do not have eyepieces and instead place an instrument (often a charge-coupled device) at the focal point instead.|$|R

5|$|Spitzer devoted much of {{his career}} to pushing for the {{development}} of a space <b>telescope.</b> In 1962, a report by the US National Academy of Sciences recommended the development of a space <b>telescope</b> as part of the space program, and in 1965 Spitzer was appointed as head of a committee given the task of defining scientific objectives for a large space <b>telescope.</b>|$|E
5|$|Telescopium was {{introduced}} in 1751â€“52 by Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille with the French name le <b>Telescope,</b> depicting an aerial <b>telescope,</b> after he had observed and catalogued 10,000 southern stars during a two-year stay at the Cape of Good Hope. He devised 14 new constellations in uncharted regions of the Southern Celestial Hemisphere not visible from Europe. All but one honored instruments that symbolised the Age of Enlightenment. Covering 40 degrees of the night sky, the <b>telescope</b> stretched out northwards between Sagittarius and Scorpius. Lacaille had Latinised its name to Telescopium by 1763.|$|E
5|$|The 1981 Doctor Who episode Logopolis, {{which was}} filmed at Crowsley Park, used {{a model of}} the Lovell <b>Telescope</b> as the Pharos Project, from which the Doctor played by Tom Baker fell and regenerated.

50|$|In {{cognitive}} psychology, the <b>telescoping</b> effect (or <b>telescoping</b> bias) {{refers to}} the temporal displacement of an event whereby people perceive recent events as being more remote than they are and distant events as being more recent than they are. The former is known as backward <b>telescoping</b> or time expansion, and the latter as is known as forward <b>telescoping.</b> Three years is approximately the time frame in which events switch from being displaced backward in time to forward in time, with events occurring {{three years in the}} past being equally likely to be reported with forward <b>telescoping</b> bias as with backward <b>telescoping</b> bias. Although <b>telescoping</b> occurs in both the forward and backward directions, in general the effect is {{to increase the number of}} events reported too recently. This net effect in the forward direction is because of forces that impair memory, such as lack of salience, also impair time perception. <b>Telescoping</b> leads to an over reporting of the frequency of events. This over reporting is because participants include events beyond the period, either events that are too recent for the target time period (backward <b>telescoping)</b> or events that are too old for the target time period (forward <b>telescoping).</b>|$|R
50|$|The VLT {{consists}} of an arrangement of four large (8.2 metre diameter) <b>telescopes</b> (called Unit <b>Telescopes</b> or UTs) with optical elements that can combine them into an astronomical interferometer (VLTI), {{which is used to}} resolve small objects. The interferometer also includes a set of four 1.8 meter diameter movable <b>telescopes</b> dedicated to interferometric observations. The first of the UTs started operating in May 1998 and was offered to the astronomical community on 1 April 1999. The other <b>telescopes</b> followed suit in 1999 and 2000, thus making the VLT fully operational. Four 1.8-metre Auxiliary <b>Telescopes</b> (ATs) {{have been added to the}} VLTI to make it available when the UTs are being used for other projects. These ATs were installed between 2004 and 2007.
