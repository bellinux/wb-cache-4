5|$|Beginning in 1958, {{outer space}} {{has been the}} subject of {{multiple}} resolutions by the United Nations General Assembly. Of these, more than 50 have been concerning the international co-operation in <b>the</b> <b>peaceful</b> uses of outer space and preventing an arms race in space. Four additional space law treaties have been negotiated and drafted by the UN's Committee on <b>the</b> <b>Peaceful</b> Uses of Outer Space. Still, there remains no legal prohibition against deploying conventional weapons in space, and anti-satellite weapons have been successfully tested by the US, USSR and China. The 1979 Moon Treaty turned the jurisdiction of all heavenly bodies (including the orbits around such bodies) over to the international community. However, this treaty has not been ratified by any nation that currently practices manned spaceflight.|$|E

5|$|Although {{contemporary}} historians vilified Domitian {{after his}} death, his administration provided {{the foundation for}} <b>the</b> <b>peaceful</b> empire of the 2nd century CE, and {{the culmination of the}} 'Pax Romana'. His successors Nerva and Trajan were less restrictive, but in reality their policies differed little from Domitian's. Much more than a gloomy coda to the 1st century, the Roman Empire prospered between 81 and 96, in a reign which Theodor Mommsen described as the sombre but intelligent despotism of Domitian.|$|E
5|$|Domitian's reign {{came to an}} end in 96 when he {{was assassinated}} by court officials. He was succeeded the same day by his advisor Nerva. After his death, Domitian's memory was {{condemned}} to oblivion by the Roman Senate, while senatorial authors such as Tacitus, Pliny the Younger, and Suetonius propagated the view of Domitian as a cruel and paranoid tyrant. Modern revisionists instead have characterized Domitian as a ruthless but efficient autocrat whose cultural, economic, and political programs provided the foundation of <b>the</b> <b>peaceful</b> second century.|$|E

5|$|In the United States, unbearably {{inadequate}} {{housing and}} overcrowded neighborhoods pushed working {{men out of}} the home and into saloons where they congregated for drink and discussion.

George Pullman and William Halliday implemented a policy of tolerance in their towns identical to that of Robert Owen. <b>The</b> <b>peaceful</b> atmosphere in Pullman and Hallidayboro can be attributed in part to the absence of alcohol.|$|E

5|$|A Literary Polish {{language}} breakthrough {{came under}} the influence of the Reformation with the writings of Mikołaj Rej. In his Brief Discourse, a satire published in 1543, he defends a serf from a priest and a noble, but in his later works he often celebrates the joys of <b>the</b> <b>peaceful</b> but privileged life of a country gentleman. Rej, whose legacy is his unbashful promotion of the Polish language, left a great variety of literary pieces. Łukasz Górnicki, an author and translator, perfected the Polish prose of the period. His contemporary and friend Jan Kochanowski became one of the greatest Polish poets of all time.|$|E
5|$|According to Expanded Universe material, <b>the</b> <b>peaceful</b> Mon Calamari {{converted}} their passenger liners into warships {{to support}} the rebellion against the Galactic Empire. Expanded Universe texts state that the ships are crewed almost entirely by Mon Calamari due to the ships' Mon Calamari-oriented controls and interface. The primary opponent of Mon Calamari cruisers are the Imperial Star Destroyers. Although Mon Calamari cruisers are roughly {{the same size as}} most Imperial Destroyers, in head-to-head engagements the Mon Calamari cruisers are usually at a disadvantage, due to their thinner armor. Even so, Mon Calamari cruisers are still a formidable threat to the Imperial fleet; their large numbers of fighter squadrons, modular weapons systems and overlapping shields make them ideal for hit-and-run attacks on Imperial ships, bases, and military outposts.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} {{broadcasts}} of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) and the Voice of America to Central and Eastern Europe, a major propaganda effort begun in 1949 was Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, dedicated to bringing about <b>the</b> <b>peaceful</b> {{demise of the}} communist system in the Eastern Bloc. Radio Free Europe attempted to achieve these goals by serving as a surrogate home radio station, {{an alternative to the}} controlled and party-dominated domestic press. Radio Free Europe was a product {{of some of the most}} prominent architects of America's early Cold War strategy, especially those who believed that the Cold War would eventually be fought by political rather than military means, such as George F.

5|$|Carrier Air Group 8 (CVG-8) was {{established}} on 15 September 1948 {{in response to}} the Berlin Blockade with newly qualified pilots and reservists who volunteered for active duty. VA-84 and VA-85, the air group's attack squadrons, began receiving Maulers in November and the last aircraft was delivered in January 1949. Later that month the air group made a flyover of President Harry Truman's Inauguration ceremony. The squadron conducted their qualifications aboard the Midway from 3 to 6 May with ten Maulers crashing into the safety barrier between them. CVG-8 made a two-week cruise aboard the Midway beginning on 27 June along the East Coast of the United States, before it was disbanded in November after <b>the</b> <b>peaceful</b> resolution of the Berlin Blockade.|$|E
5|$|During such campaigns, {{he is said}} to have misled his voters {{into believing}} that he was a son of the deposed Domnitor Alexandru Ioan Cuza, and {{therefore}} a natural champion of land reform. His activity in Olt is credited with having sparked some violent incidents: in at least one account, he instigated the peasants of Slatina area to riot, and their revolt was only suppressed with use of force. Others however claim that the Romanian Land Forces randomly shot at, then charged upon, <b>the</b> <b>peaceful</b> mass of demonstrators, killing at least 35 of them.|$|E

5|$|Edward the Martyr (Old English: Eadweard; 18 March 978) was King of England from 975 {{until he}} was murdered in 978. Edward was the eldest son of King Edgar <b>the</b> <b>Peaceful</b> but was not his father's {{acknowledged}} heir. On Edgar's death, the leadership of England was contested, with some supporting Edward's claim to be king and others supporting his much younger half-brother Æthelred the Unready, recognized as a legitimate son of Edgar. Edward was chosen as king and was crowned by his main clerical supporters, the archbishops Dunstan and Oswald of Worcester.|$|E
5|$|Following Cortés' {{visit in}} 1525, no Spanish {{attempted}} {{to visit the}} warlike Itza inhabitants of Nojpetén for almost a hundred years. In 1618 two Franciscan friars set out from Mérida {{on a mission to}} attempt <b>the</b> <b>peaceful</b> conversion of the still pagan Itza in central Petén. Bartolomé de Fuensalida and Juan de Orbita were accompanied by some Christianised Maya. They were well received at Nojpetén by the current Kan Ek'. Attempts to convert the Itza failed, and the friars left Nojpetén on friendly terms with the Itza king. The friars returned in October 1619, and again Kan Ek' welcomed them in a friendly manner, but this time the Maya priesthood were hostile and the missionaries were expelled without food or water, but survived the journey back to Mérida.|$|E
5|$|Furious was recommissioned in May 1932 {{as part of}} the Home Fleet with {{a reduced}} crew before being brought up to full {{complement}} in November.

Furious was present at the Coronation Fleet Review at Spithead on 20 May 1937 for King George VI. She became a deck-landing training carrier in 1937, although she was refitted between December 1937 and May 1938 in Devonport, where the forward end of her lower flight deck was raised to make her less wet forward. During the Munich Crisis in September 1938, she embarked Nos. 801, 821 and 822 Squadrons and joined the fleet at Scapa Flow, before resuming her training duties after <b>the</b> <b>peaceful</b> conclusion of the affair.|$|E
