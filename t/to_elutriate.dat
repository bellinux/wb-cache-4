40|$|A Reflux Classifier {{involves}} the liquid fluidization of particles into {{a set of}} parallel inclined channels. Closely spaced inclined channels promote a combination of laminar flow and a high shear rate, which in turn promote the elutriation of the particles according to their density. The hydrodynamics of the particle transport within the inclined channels was examined theoretically by combining established equations for describing the fluid flow, the terminal velocity of a particle, and the shear induced inertial lift, with no adjustable parameters. The theoretical calculations provided excellent agreement with a comprehensive experimental data set, demonstrating {{the significance of the}} inertial lift force that arises at a high shear rate under the condition of laminar flow. Complex features of the experimental data were described theoretically. This work explains how it is possible <b>to</b> <b>elutriate</b> particles according to their density, with the effects of particle size suppressed.

40|$|The {{potential}} {{toxicity of}} sediments from various ports {{was assessed by}} means of two different liquid-phase toxicity bioassays (acute and chronic) with embryos and eggs of sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus. Performances of embryos and eggs of P. lividus in these bioassays were compared for their interchangeable applicability in integrated sediment quality assessment. The obtained endpoints (percentages of normally developed plutei and fertilized eggs) were linked to {{physical and chemical properties}} of sediments and demonstrated dependence on sediment contamination. The endpoints in the two bioassays were strongly correlated and generally exhibited similar tendency throughout the samples. Therein, embryos demonstrated higher sensitivity <b>to</b> <b>elutriate</b> exposure, compared to eggs.

40|$|Background, Aim and Scope The {{toxicity}} of contaminated sediments {{should be evaluated}} considering the direct exposure of laboratory organisms to whole sediments and the indirect exposure <b>to</b> <b>elutriates</b> or extracts (Tay et al. 1992, Byrne and Halloran 1999, Nendza 2002). The alga Dunaliella tertiolecta is indicated for the use in toxicity bioassays because it is highly sensitive to several xenobiotics. Harpacticoid copepods have been already used for toxicity testing and Tigriopus fulvus is a promising Mediterranean target-species in ecotoxicology (Todaro et al. 2001, Faraponova et al. 2003, Pane et al. 2005 a). In this study, the {{toxicity of}} sediments collected in harbour sites of the Northeastern Adriatic Sea was evaluated by growth inhibition test with free living and alginate-immobilized Dunaliella tertiolecta and acute toxicity test with nauplii and adult Tigriopus fulvus {{with the aim of}} pointing out the importance to utilize model organisms from different trophic levels in sediment ecotoxicology. Methodology Elutriates and whole sediments were tested on free living and immobilized (Pane et al. 1998) algal cells, and on laboratory reared copepods. Free-living D. tertiolecta were exposed <b>to</b> diluted <b>elutriates</b> in a static, multi-well plate system. Naalginate immobilized D. tertiolecta were placed in polystyrene inserts fitted with polyester mesh bottoms and exposed to a thin layer (2 mm) of whole sediments in multi-well plates (EPS 1992, Pane and Bertino 1999). Toxicity tests with copepods were carried out on Tigriopus fulvus nauplii (elutriates) and adults (whole sediments and elutriates). Same-aged nauplii useful for toxicity tests were obtained by egg sac detaching and consequent hatching stimulation (Pane et al. 2006). Newborn nauplii (I–II stage) were exposed <b>to</b> <b>elutriates</b> in multi-well plates provided with polystyrene inserts.

In our study, the role of ammonia as a possible toxicant in sediment toxicity tests was evaluated using larvae of the surf clam,. Elutriates were prepared and tested using six baseline sediment samples. Ammonia was then purged from aliquots of the baseline sediment samples prior <b>to</b> <b>elutriate</b> preparation. Finally, ammonia was spiked into aliquots of the purged elutriates to mimic ammonia concentrations measured in the baseline elutriates. Toxicity was present in all of the baseline samples and was removed in the ammonia purged samples. In most cases, toxicity was comparable in the ammonia spiked samples to levels measured in the baseline samples. Water only toxicity tests revealed that larvae of the surf clam are one of the more ammonia sensitive marine species. The LC 50 for survival was 10. 6 mg/L total ammonia (0. 53 mg/L unionized ammonia) and the EC 50 for shell development was 2. 35 mg/L total ammonia (0. 12 mg/L unionized ammonia).

Thus, the aim of this work is to separate and to purify the smectite fractions using water as a solvent at a low flux mixed with a bentonite clay extracted from a mine in Vitória da Conquista - Bahia / Brazil. For this a separation method of fractions of expandable clays based on the Stokes' Law was applied - this process is called elutriation, in order to ensure and to expand possible industrial applications of this material. The samples were characterized by analysis of X-ray diffraction, X-ray fluorescence and scanning electron microscopy. The Rietveld method enabled the quantification of main phase minerals: montmorillonite, kaolinite, nontronite and quartz, reaching 85 % in mass of montmorillonite phase {{at the end of the}} process. Results showed that the method used was efficient to remove almost all quartz, carbonates and organic matter from the sample. It was also observed a monomodal grain size distribution of elutriated materials with thinner grains, around (18. 1 ± 1. 8) μm at the end of the process.

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} water parameters in ponds {{affected by}} coal extraction. Allium cepa assay {{was used to}} measure genotoxicity/mutagenicity of the sediment. Samples were collected from four ponds in the southern state of Santa Catarina. Water temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, conductivity and turbidity were measured. Sediments were analyzed for heavy metals. Elutriate samples were prepared at a ratio of 1 : 4 sediment:water. Allium cepa bulbs were placed in samples prepared from each pond, with ultrapure water used as negative control and methyl methane sulfonate as positive control. Root length, mitotic index, chromosomal aberrations, micronuclei, and nuclear abnormalities were measured. The pH of two ponds, as well as electrical conductivity and dissolved oxygen of all ponds were below the minimum limits set by Brazilian regulation. All heavy metals analyzed were found in all sediment samples, but only Cd concentration was above the legal limit set by Brazilian law. Allium cepa root growth for samples from Ponds 1, 2, and 4 was significantly lower than the negative control. Meristematic cells exposed <b>to</b> <b>elutriate</b> samples showed no significant changes in cell division. There was a significant increase in total chromosomal aberrations in all treated samples in comparison with the negative control. This study demonstrates that even low concentrations of heavy metals can damage exposed biota, possibly due to synergistic effects.

To achieve that, an Integrated Soil Microcosms (ISM) system was designed <b>to</b> produce <b>elutriates</b> and leachates from the sediment/soil percentage mixtures. Furthermore, to investigate the biological effects of the contaminated sediments, the toxicity behavior of leachates and elutriates was assessed and compared by performing acute (48 h) toxicity assays with the cladoceran Daphnia magna as test organism. Sediment samples contaminated with industrial residues were collected in November-December 2007 in a river area {{under the influence of}} the effluents from a chlor-alkali industry (Ebro River basin in Flix Reservoir, NE Spain). Uncontaminated natural soil was collected from a pesticide-free field. Particle size, pH, conductivity, total organic carbon, organic matter content, and soil and sediment moisture were determined. Eighty ISM were set up in the laboratory. To each ISM, 3 kg of fresh soil was added to form a 20 -cm deep layer. Sediment and soil were mixed in the following proportions: 0 : 100, 10 : 90, 20 : 80, 35 : 65, and 50 : 50 (percent sediment/soil). Five hundred grams of the mixtures were placed at the top of each microcosm to form a 10 -cm deep layer. The Integrated Soil Microcosm experiment ran for 60 days. Elutriates were obtained at days 1, 7, 14, 30, and 60 while leachates were collected at days 7, 14, and 30. At each sampling time, the toxicity of the extracted elutriate and collected leachate was evaluated by performing D. magna immobilization tests. From the results, it was apparent that the toxicity of contaminated sediments decreased with the increasing percentage of fresh soil that was added as a buffer. The results also exhibited that the obtained elutriates caused significant mortalities in D. magna at day 1 and day 7, though a slight reduction in the mortality of D. magna was observed by day 30. Conversely, a different pattern of toxicity was observed in the case of the produced leachates, where no mortality of D. magna was observed at day 7, but the toxicity increased with time resulting in some mortality of D. magna by day 30. Through the leaching process, toxic contaminants present in the soil/sediment mixtures seemed to be washed out through a 30 -cm soil column leading to an increased toxicity of the leachates over time and to a decreased toxicity of the soil/sediment mixtures used <b>to</b> obtain the <b>elutriates.</b> Soil microcosms using natural soil as a buffer can be used to evaluate the toxicity of contaminated sediments and also to assess the environmental impacts on soil organisms and ground waters as a result of run-off and infiltration processes.

40|$|While {{the appeal}} of biochar {{application}} to soils continues growing, so does the concern about the possibility for surface and groundwater contamination, due to biochar-bound contaminants, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Up to now, insufficient information exists on to what extent that PAH fraction can become bioavailable in the soil solution over time and which are the associated potential ecotoxicological implications, {{as a result of}} processes such as runoff. This pilot study aimed to evaluate the ecotoxicological effects of biochar-bound PAHs in runoff from soils amended with biochar, having been identified as a gap in current knowledge. Combining soil wetting-drying cycles with PAH water-extraction, a good first approach was obtained for evaluating their potential occurrence in soil solution, while taking into consideration natural soil processes and soil-biochar interactions. LUFA 2. 2 soil alone and containing biochar (at usual field rates, 4 % ww- 1) was subjected to 0, 6 or 12 (sampling times ST- 0, ST- 1 or ST- 2 respectively) consecutive wetting-drying cycles, after which the corresponding test elutriates were extracted. Alongside PAH quantification, a battery of standard aquatic bioassays were used with representative test organisms (Vibrio fischeri, Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and Daphnia magna), for a robust ecotoxicological evaluation of the biochar-soil (BS) aqueous extracts, while LUFA soil elutriates were used as control (SS). Compared to the control (SS) and <b>to</b> <b>elutriates</b> of biochar alone (B), BS extracts showed the highest total PAH contents, suggesting that a relevant PAHs fraction in biochar-amended soil may be easily water-extractable, perhaps due to interactions between biochar and soil components. Yet, the number of soil wet-dry cycles on aqueous total PAH concentrations was often not significant, suggesting that natural soil wetting-drying events might have little influence on increased PAH bioavailability in pore water, on the short term. BS extracts induced toxicity in all tested species, although its extent was species-specific and varied with the number of wet-dry cycles. For example, the highest sensitivity was observed in the acute assay with D. magna exposed to BS extract for ST- 0, while P. subcapitata and V. fischeri were most sensitive when exposed to BS, ST- 1. Nevertheless, sub-lethal effects were also observed for P. subcapitata and V. fischeri, when exposed to the control (SS) extracts. Although the levels of individual PAHs in all samples (BS, SS and B) were below the acutely toxic concentrations reported in the literature, it cannot be excluded the combined effects of the multiple PAHs in the test elutriates when explaining these results. Furthermore, although individual PAH concentrations were below that to produce acute effects, chronic effects can occur, and therefore, long-term exposure <b>to</b> these <b>elutriates</b> and using additional non-target species, various biochars and soil properties are necessary for a full evaluation of the bioavailability and ecotoxicity of biochar-bound PAH contaminants in runoff from treated soils.

50|$|Unlike water samples, {{soil and}} {{sediment}} samples are not homogenous. As a result, {{it is difficult}} to obtain representative samples from such matrices. Toxic substances are likely to bind to particulate matter, {{and the extent to which}} toxic materials bind depends on the composition of the particles.

40|$|Laboratory {{experiments}} on granular flows using natural material {{were carried out}} in order to investigate the behaviour of granular flows passing over a break in slope. Sensors in the depositional area recorded the flow kinematics, while video footage permitted reconstruction of the deposit formation, which allowed investigation of the deposit shape {{as a function of}} the change in slope. We defined the slope-angle ratio as the proportion between slope angle in the depositional area and that of the channel. When the granular flow encounters the break in slope part of the flow front forms a bouncing clast zone due to elastic impact with the expansion box floor. During this process, part of the kinetic energy of the dense granular flow is transferred <b>to</b> <b>elutriating</b> fine ash, which subsequently forms turbulent ash cloud accompanying the granular flow until it comes to rest. Morphometric analysis of the deposits shows that they are all elliptical, with an almost constant minor axis and a variable major axis. The almost constant value of the minor axis relates to the spreading angle of flow at the end of the channel, which resembles the basal friction angle of the material. The variation of the major axis is interpreted to relate to the effect of competing inertial and frictional forces. This effect also reflects the partitioning of centripetal and tangential velocities, which changes as the flow passes over the break in slope. After normalization, morphometric data provided empirical relationships that highlight the dependence of runout from the product of slope-angle ratio and the difference in height between granular material release and deposit. The empirical relationships were tested against the runouts of hot avalanches formed during the 1944 ad eruption at Vesuvius, with differences among actual and calculated values are between 1. 7 and 15  %. Velocity measurements of laboratory granular flows record deceleration paths at different breaks in slope. When normalized, the velocity data show third-order polynomial fit, highlighting a complex behaviour involving interplay between inertial and frictional forces. The theoretical velocity decays were tested against the data published for volcaniclastic debris flows of the 5 – 6 May 1998 event in the Sarno area. The comparison is very good for non-channelized debris flows, with significant differences between actual and calculated velocities for the channelized debris flows...|$|R

The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the overall sensitivity and applicability of a number of bioassays representing multiple trophic levels, for the preliminary ecotoxicological screening (Tier I) of estuarine sediments. Chemical analyses were conducted on sediments from all sampling sites to assist in interpreting results. As sediment is an inherently complex, heterogeneous geological matrix, the toxicity associated with different exposure routes (solid, porewater and elutriate phases) was also assessed. A stimulatory response was detected following exposure of some sediment phases to both the Microtox and algal bioassays. Of the bioassays and endpoints employed in this study, the algal test was the most responsive <b>to</b> both <b>elutriates</b> and porewaters. Salinity controls, which corresponded to the salinity of the neat porewater samples, were found to have significant effects on the growth of the algae. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the inclusion of a salinity control in algal toxicity tests, the results of which emphasise the importance of incorporating appropriate controls in experimental design. While differential responses were observed, the site characterised as the most polluted on the basis of chemical analysis was consistently ranked the most toxic with all test species and all test phases. In terms of identifying appropriate Tier I screening tests for sediments, this study demonstrated both the Microtox and algal bioassays to be more sensitive than the bacterial enzyme assays and the invertebrate lethality assay employing Artemia salina.

Elutriate incubation as well as artificial spiking induced strong enrichments in nutrients (up to 18 times), metals (up to six times) and herbicides (up to 20 times) relative to the in situ concentrations in the offshore station, whereas the increases in contaminants were less marked in the lagoon station. In the offshore waters, the artificial mixture of pollutants provoked a strong inhibition of bacterial abundance, production and respiration and significant modifications of the potential functional diversity of bacterioplankton with a strong decrease of the carbohydrate utilization. In contrast, incubation with elutriate resulted in a stimulation of bacterial activities and abundances, suggesting that the toxic effects of pollutants were modified by the increase in nutrient and DOM concentrations due to the sediment resuspension. The effects of elutriate and the artificial mixture of pollutants on bacterial dynamics and the functional diversity were less marked in the lagoon waters, than in offshore waters, suggesting a relative tolerance of lagoon bacteria against contaminants...|$|R
40|$|The {{combined}} {{effects of}} contaminants and nutrients released from sediment into the water column during resuspension-mixing events were assessed on the phytoplankton composition and productivity in the anthropized lagoon of Bizerte (Tunisia, Mediterranean Sea). During a 4 -day experiment, phytoplankton was exposed in in situ immersed microcosms <b>to</b> sediment <b>elutriates</b> (untreated: El and sterilized: S-El), prepared from a sediment resuspension simulation process, and its responses were evaluated and compared with controls. Elutriate addition resulted in an enrichment of the water with contaminants (mix of metals and PAHs) and nutrients (NO _ 2 ^- − 2, NH _ 4 ^+ + 4, PO _ 4 ^ 3 - 3 − 4, Si(OH) 4). The resulting contaminant enrichment was similar among treatments, but the nutrient enrichment was slightly higher in the S-El treatment than in the El treatment. Our results show that both elutriates strongly stimulated phytoplankton growth. They also show that the S-El-induced shifts in the phytoplankton community composition slightly enhanced the species diversity, whereas the El {{did not seem to}} have any effect on the phytoplankton community composition. In addition, our results show that the net production was stimulated by both elutriate treatments, after 24 h and 48 h of exposure to S-El and El. During the first hours, both elutriates induced a prompt increase in respiration, resulting in a temporary (2 – 3 days) switch of the systems from net autotrophy (P:R >  1) to net heterotrophy (P:R <  1). Hence in anthropized coastal environments, sediment resuspensions are likely to have significant effects on the structure and productivity of pelagic primary producers, and thereby on carbon transfer throughout food webs...|$|R

Elutriates were tested using Skeletonema costatum, an eurialin Diatom. Several ratios of elutriate/growth medium (v/v) were assayed (1 : 10, 1 : 4, and undiluted) as cultural medium for exponentially growing algae, carrying out a blank control for each replicate. Tests were performed for five days, controlling algal growth by manual cell counting by microscope, in order to verify the status of the organisms every assay’s day. This experimental design was proved able to highlight a particular phenomenon, i. e. hormesis. Regarding some sites {{in the southern part of}} the Guanabara Bay growth curves, relative <b>to</b> lower sediment <b>elutriate</b> dilutions, showed, in fact, a so called toxic stimulation typical of hormetic event. On the contrary undiluted elutriates never permitted algal growth. Obtained results could help furthermore to explain the particular eutrophic situation of the water body, in which there is a high superficial eutrophization and absolute life deficiency in the deeper water column...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} reproductive, developmental, immunological, {{growth and}} carcinogenetic effects of endocrine disruptors in humans and wildlife is of global concern. Scarce prior risk analyses of these multiple stressors in river watersheds existed. Therefore, this thesis developed an integrated risk assessment of endocrine disruptors at {{a section of}} the Lower Uruguay River with industrial (a bleached Kraft pulp mill), domestic (cities) and agricultural (soy crops) sources. A preliminary risk assessment prioritised oestrogens and further compounds of concern in the watershed, notably nonylphenol, glyphosate, endosulfan, chlorophenols, dioxins and furans, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, polychlorinated byphenyls, rosin acids and phytosterols. Models predicted their multimedia distribution, and food web interactions, and then tested. A three-tiered exposure assessment first rated the river status with eutrophication risks using artificial neural networks, while growth effects evidenced in Hyalella curvispina. Then, river sampling sites were determined by hydrodynamic modelling, tracking pollutant transport by clustering and observing reproductive effects in Ceriodapnia dubia. Finally, target compounds were analysed and endocrine disruption studied from gene to population levels. Biomonitoring with Astyanax fasciatus wildfish found no intersex, but smaller testes downstream the pulp mill and lower condition factor near municipal discharges. Spinal malformations were observed exposing Pimephales promelas <b>to</b> sediment <b>elutriates.</b> When exposed <b>to</b> pulp mill effluent, egg production decreased by half. Anti-oestrogenic or androgenic effects were suggested by the toxicogenomic biomarkers ESR 1, ESR 2, IGF-I and GHR. The oestrogenicity of a stream receiving municipal wastewater was demonstrated by effects like estradiol in ZP 3, ESR 1 and IGF-I expression, in agreement with the luciferase receptor-binding screen, and the occurrence of oestrogens and nonylphenol. Overall risks of endocrine disruptors were estimated with radar diagrams, pondering nonylphenol and endosulfan as of concern in the watershed. The risks of endocrine disruption to humans through fish and water ingestion were characterised as low, and from low to moderate to freshwater biota...|$|R
40|$|Generally, Antarctica is {{considered}} to be an untouched area of the planet; however, the region's ecosystems have been subject to increased human pressure for at least the past half-century. This study assessed soils of Fildes Peninsula, where trace element pollution is thought to prevail. Four soil samples were collected from different locations and assessed following tier 1 methodologies for chemical and ecotoxicological lines of evidence (LoE) used in typical soil Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA). Trace element quantification was run on soil samples and sequential extracts, and <b>elutriates</b> were used <b>to</b> address their ecotoxicity using a standard ecotoxicological battery. The highest levels of trace elements were found for Cr, Cu, Ni and Zn, which were well above baseline levels in two sites located near previously identified contamination sources. Trace element concentrations in soils were compared with soil quality guidelines to estimate the contribution of the chemical LoE for integrated risk calculations; risk was found high, above 0. 5 for all samples. Total concentrations in soil were consistent with corresponding sequentially extracted percentages, with Cu and Zn being the most bioavailable elements. Bacteria did not respond consistently <b>to</b> the <b>elutriate</b> samples and cladocerans did not respond at all. In contrast, the growth of microalgae and macrophytes was significantly impaired by elutriates of all soil samples, consistently to estimated trace element concentrations in the elutriate matrix. These results translated into lower risk values for the ecotoxicological compared to the chemical LoE. Nevertheless, integrated risk calculations generated either an immediate recommendation for further analysis to better understand the hazardous potential of the tested soils or showed that the soils could not adequately sustain natural ecosystem functions. This study suggests that the soil ecosystem in Fildes has been inadequately protected and supports previous claims on the need to reinforce protection measures and remediation activities...|$|R

The locations analyzed are sites associated with agriculture, forestry, and petroleum hydrocarbons (oil) production. The toxicity tests include: (1) Chlorella vulgaris (algal) elutriate test, (2) Paramecium caudatum (ciliate) elutriate test, (3) Daphnia magna (cladoceran) whole sediment toxicity test, and (4) Heterocypris incongruens (ostracod) whole sediment toxicity test. The concentrations of metals in 43 % of sediment samples {{have been found to}} exceed probable effect concentration sediment quality guidelines (SQGs). However, the concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and organochlorine pesticides {{have turned out to be}} below SQGs in most sites. The correlation analysis has shown metal toxicity to daphnid reproduction and ostracod growth (R 2 = 0. 34 – 0. 64) and ammonia (R 2 = 0. 49 – 0. 54). A higher percentage of samples have shown toxicity in the whole sediment tests (86 %) compared <b>to</b> the <b>elutriate</b> tests (54 %). A total of 91 % of samples have demonstrated toxicity for at least one species. Toxicity has been most frequently observed for daphnid reproduction (83 % of samples) and ostracod growth (56 % of samples) compared to daphnid (23 %) survival, ostracod (11 %) survival, and ciliate reproduction (54 %) or algal growth (54 %). The most polluted sediments have been registered in the area of oil production. The comparison of toxicity of the samples from different types of areas has indicated that 100 % of samples from the oil production area, 94 % of samples from the agricultural area, and 50 % of samples from the forest area were toxic to at least one test organism...|$|R
40|$|Wastewater which {{primarily}} {{emanates from}} mining operations and manufacturing industries, {{has the potential}} for re-use if treated effectively. These wastewaters, which are typically characterized by high concentrations of dissolved inorganic salts are often disposed in evaporation ponds, which promotes the risk of ground water pollution and land wastage. Moreover, this forfeits the potential benefits of valuable salts recovered. The aim of this project was to investigate the treatment of multicomponent saline wastewater rich in sodium and magnesium sulphates, since these salts are prevalent in most wastewater streams. The intention was to treat the wastewater with a calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH) 2) suspension in a laboratory scale seeded fluidised bed crystallizer, thereby precipitating gypsum and magnesium hydroxide. The objectives of this study were to investigate how the chosen reactor configuration, feed stream and reagent characteristics affect the conversion and recovery of gypsum and magnesium hydroxide over a range of wastewater concentrations. Particular focus was on reducing the formation of fines through the use of seeds and to get an insight into the possible precipitation mechanisms. It was important that the resulting precipitate product quality favoured effective separation from the treated water stream for re-use. Preliminary experiments were conducted over a feed concentration ranging from 1. 5 g/L - 120 g/L (total sulphate salts) which was contacted with a stoichiometric amount of calcium hydroxide with respect to the sulphates in the stream, that is a Ca:SO 4 ratio of 1 : 1 in the fluidised bed crystallizer. These experiments identified a feasible feed concentration range for operation (8 000 - 35 000 mg/L). High inlet concentrations (≥ 50 000 mg/L) were not feasible due to rapid formation of a large mass of precipitates which disrupted fluidisation and caused the reactor contents <b>to</b> be <b>elutriated.</b> These high concentrations resulted in high rates of accumulation which necessitated the need for frequent intermittent product removal...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} bed hydrodynamics, {{particle}} and feed slurry properties on maximum slurry feed rate and elutriation during spouted bed coating of seed was studied. Experiments were {{performed in a}} 0. 15 m diameter laboratory batch spouted bed using 13 different seed types and two fertilizer coatings - monocalcium phosphate (MCP) and tricalcium phosphate (TCP) - with a methylcellulose binder. Gas superficial velocity, bed height and temperature, orifice size, coating strength and flow rate were varied during experiments. The slurry feed rate is limited by spout collapse caused by the formation of embryo agglomerates in the spray zone {{at the bottom of}} the spout. The formation of agglomerates is determined by a balance between binding forces which are related to seed and coating properties, and shearing forces which are determined by bed hydrodynamics. The spout collapses before exit air from the bed is completely saturated with water. The relative humidity of the exit air at spout collapse increases with increasing excess air velocity and particle size, decreases with increasing feed slurry viscosity and is independent of bed height and temperature. Attrition of newly formed coating is the main mechanism <b>to</b> generate <b>elutriated</b> fines. The elutriation rate increases linearly with feed slurry rate and with gas velocity to the third power. It is a strong function of coating strength. Two attrition models - the inlet gas kinetic energy model and the excess energy model - were examined. The inlet gas kinetic energy model best explains the elutriation data from these experiments at constant orifice size (25 mm). However, when the inlet orifice size is decreased, the increase in elutriation is less than predicted by the increase in inlet gas kinetic energy. The mechanistic models used in this work may also be relevant to other spouted bed granulation and coating processes...|$|R
40|$|Out of {{different}} white rot fungi, I. lacteus, P. ostreatus, P. chrysosporium and P. magnoliae {{were able to}} decolorize all six synthetic dyes tested. Further decolorization study on P. magnoliae revealed that decolorization of synthetic dyes in liquid cultures were restricted to static culture conditions for the fungus. I. lacteus and P. ostreatus were able to colonize both, tyndallized and soil with native microflora. Anthraquinone based synthetic dye - RBBR was significantly decolorized in soil by I. lacteus, a bacterial consortium and the coculture of the fungus and the bacteria. I. lacteus was comparatively more efficient that P. ostreatus and P. putida to degrade PAHs, both in artificially contaminated soil and contaminated soils from industrial area. Application of P. putida with the two individual fungi did not improve degradation efficiency and concentration pattern from the independent application of the fungi; this suggests that coculture conditions with the respective fungus were not suitable for bacteria {{to take part in}} dye decolorisation or PAH degradation. Due to poor solubility of PAHs in aqueous solution ecotoxicity test organisms like Daphnia magna may not show significant response <b>to</b> water <b>elutriates</b> prepared from PAH contaminated soil. Both earthworms and plants should be included as ecotoxicity test organisms as they contribute many functions in soil ecosystems. Apart from mortality as an end point to earthworm toxicity test other sublethal end points like effects on cocoon and juvenile production should also be considered as they may provide more sensitive and different response than mortality. To correlate the qualitative and quantitative presence of pollutants with the toxicity measurement analysis of bioaccumulation or body burden of contaminants could be helpful in determining exact cause of toxicity on the test organisms. Recent development in bioremediation research reached the point that mere chemical analysis of pollutants {{may not be enough to}} demonstrate remediation process, and thus combination of chemical analysis and ecotoxicology tests is imperative.

40|$|CO 2 {{leakages}} during {{carbon capture}} and storage in sub-seabed geological structures could produce potential {{impacts on the}} marine environment. To study lethal effects on marine organisms attributable to CO 2 seawater acidification, a bubbling CO 2 system was designed enabling a battery of different tests to be conducted, under laboratory conditions, employing various pH treatments (8. 0, 7. 5, 7. 0, 6. 5, 6. 0, and 5. 5). Assays were performed of three exposure routes (seawater, whole sediment, and sediment elutriate). Individuals of the clam (Ruditapes philippinarum) and early-life stages of the gilthead seabream, Sparus aurata, were exposed for 10 days and 72 h, respectively, to acidified clean seawater. S. aurata larvae were also exposed <b>to</b> acidified <b>elutriate</b> samples, and polychaete organisms of the specie Hediste diversicolor and clams R. philippinarum were also exposed for 10 days to estuarine whole sediment. In the fish larvae elutriate test, 100 % mortality was recorded at pH 6. 0, after 48 h of exposure. Similar results were obtained in the clam sediment exposure test. In the other organisms, significant mortality (p < 0. 05) was observed at pH values lower than 6. 0. Very high lethal effects (calculating L[H+] 50, defined as the H+ concentration that causes lethal effects in 50 % of the population exposed) were detected in association with the lowest pH treatment for all the species. The implication of these results is that a severe decrease of seawater pH would cause high mortality in marine organisms of several different kinds and life stages.

40|$|Extract] A vertical, {{cross-sectional}} exposure {{through a}} well-preserved sand blow {{and the associated}} volcano was discovered 1. 8 m above {{the base of the}} Upper Cretaceous upper member of the Wahweap Formation. Preserved features within the feeder conduit (pipe) of the sand vo 1 cano facilitate reconstruction of the vertical fluid flow and interpretation of liquefied sand flow generated by local seismogenic faulting. In the lower reaches of the conduit, a dilation fracture crosscuts a low-permeability, fine-grained sandstone seal. Above this, the conduit widens and the edges become more diffuse in the overlying higher-permeability sandstone, and conversely, the pipe contracts in diameter as it passes through lower-permeability sandstones. This change in character of the pipe, in addition to the structureless sandstone adjacent to the pipe, indicates that lateral flow to the conduit was greater in the high-permeability zones. Within the pipe, subvertical stringers of granules 30 cm below the vent indicate that fluid row of the liquefied sediment was of sufficient velocity to move granules. Medium <b>to</b> fine sand, <b>elutriated</b> from the sediment in the conduit, forms the subarial sand volcano cone. The internally massive surface volcano is slightly asymmetrical, measuring ~ 120 cm in apparent diameter and ~ 20 cm in height and is onlapped by the lee face of a fluvial dune. Modern sand volcanoes often develop proximal to faults as a result of high-magnitude seismic events. This ancient sand volcano is located in close proximity to a series of normal faults and, along with other preserved syntectonic deposits in the Wahweap Formation, indicates that the fault slip history includes intense, high-magnitude seismic activity...|$|R
40|$|In the {{framework}} of the “Risk Assessment” procedure for the ecotoxicological evaluation of compounds used in the aquatic environment, tests with target species have been carried out. This paper reports the results concerning the evaluation on cladocerans Daphnia magna of the acute toxicity of F- 500 micelle encapsulator (Hazard Control Inc., USA), a mixture of ionic and non-ionic surfactants based on fatty acid esters with aliphatic polyalcohols in watery solution, used as fire fighter agent as well as dispersant against hydrocarbon pollution, with the purpose to verify its compatibility for the aquatic environment and its potential usefulness for the remediation of soils polluted with hydrocarbons. F- 500 has been indicated to be active for soil remediation; some laboratory studies have shown that F- 500 is able to encapsulate hydrocarbons occurring into the soil and to extract and maintain them in watery solution, making them more accessible for the remediation process and consequently decreasing both their toxicity and bio-availability. As a matter of fact, F- 500 has high affinity for soil particles and was demonstrated that 0. 1 % F. 500 solutions are adsorbed almost completely (> 99 %) in soils; furthermore, after elution of soil with water less than 1 % of F- 500 was found into the eluate. The artificial soil was prepared according to the standardized procedures. Soil constituents were previously dried and subsequently dampened with deionized water in order to obtain 40 - 60 % of the maximum water retention. For ecotoxicological tests the artificial soil was treated with commercial diesel and with F- 500 at the concentration (1. 5 %) known to be non-toxic for the organisms. The artificial soil was packed up in 5 cm diameter glass columns and subsequently eluted with deionized water to obtain the eluate, according to the USEPA method. The elutriate was obtained placing soil aliquots and deionized water (1 : 4) in glass beakers and maintaining them stirred for 1 hour. For both eluate and elutriate testings the following four samples were prepared and subsequently tested: 1) control (only soil), 2) soil + diesel, 3) soil + 1. 5 % F- 500, 4) soil + diesel + 1. 5 % F- 500. Two different tests were carried out with the eluate using two different amounts of both compounds (Diesel 10 ml; F- 500 5 ml in the test A; Diesel 20 ml; F- 500 10 ml in the test B), thus maintaining unchanged the Diesel/F- 500 rate (2 : 1). Four different tests were carried out with the elutriate maintaining unchanged the diesel amount and varying the diesel:F- 500 rate, namely 2 : 1 (A), 1 : 1 (B), 1 : 2 (C), 1 : 4 (D). Daphnia magna specimens have been obtained from Daphtoxokit ephippia (Microtox, Milano, Italy; batch DM 281009) and maintained at 25 ± 2 °C in aerated and properly screened mineral water supplemented with 0. 45 mm-filtered 1 : 100 CaCl 2 solution and 0. 45 mm-filtered 1 : 100 NaHCO 3 solution. Before the test 30 Daphnia magna females were isolated and maintained starved for 24 hours; the offspring born during this period were used in the test and exposed for 24 hours at 20 ± 2 °C, 16 : 8 light:dark period, to eluates and <b>to</b> <b>elutriates</b> in multiwell plates with polyethilene inserts (NetwellTM Corning, NY, USA) provided with 74 mm porosity basal membrane. Five organisms per test in quadruplicate against control test were utilized. The tested F- 500 concentrations were chosen considering the results of preliminary assays. The acute toxicity was evaluated estimating as end-point the percent immobilization of treated newborn specimens after 10 sec. according to OECD. The results have been expressed as IC 50. The results of the tests are shown in table 1 (a, b). The data confirm that F- 500 is not toxic to daphnids and show clearly that mixing F- 500 to a soil pollutant (commercial diesel) the acute toxicity induced by eluates and elutriates on cladocerans decreases remarkably. This allows to confirm the ecocompatibility of F- 500 and its suitability for soil remediation. F- 500 is an easy-to-use compound useful for the remediation of soils and effective particularly under aerobic conditions; it is able to improve the biological degradation of contaminants by natural microbial populations as well as to stimulate the biodegradation reducing the toxicity of the environmental pollutants or making them innocuous. F- 500 allows to restore the usage of the treated areas accelerating the self-regeneration of contaminated soils and restoring rapidly the ecological equilibrium ([URL] The overall ecocompatibility and the low toxicity against marine crustaceans and fish of F- 500, evaluated through standardized parameters, are known. The tests carried out in this study have shown an evident decrease of the toxicity in soils treated with diesel + F- 500 in comparison to those treated with only diesel. This result is supposed to be due {{to the power of the}} compound to encapsulate the hydrocarbon molecules maintaining them in watery solution. Like this, the hydrocarbons could be made less available to the organisms thus resulting less toxic. Therefore, the results show a potential protective effect of F- 500 against the damage exerted by pollution on aquatic organisms and the suitability of this compound to counteract the soil pollution...|$|R
40|$|Once a {{waste is}} {{designated}} or declared to be “hazardous ” under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) it becomes {{subject to a}} myriad of rules and regulations promulgated by the U.

RCRA regulations require strict control of hazardous wastes from “cradle-to-grave; ” i. e., from generation, through transportation, storage, treatment, and disposal. There {{is little doubt that}} these regulations will change the way industry does business. The cost of disposal will go up, the financial impacts will be significant, the technical requirements will increase, and the paper work will grow. Under RCRA you will be required to do the following: 0 Provide notification if you produce “hazardous” wastes 0 Provide proper containerization for “hazardous” wastes 0 Maintain complete records of waste generation, handling and disposal 0 Obtain permits for treatment, storage, transportation, and disposal. To make matters worse, the design and operating requirements for “hazardous ” waste disposal will serve to diminish the already limited off-site capacity. Would it not be great to convert the hazardous waste into a nonhazardous material? THE CONCEPT EPA has chosen <b>to</b> use an <b>elutriate</b> test <b>to</b> determine whether toxic components can be leached from the waste. The analysis of the extract from an operationally defined procedure determines whether the waste is hazardous by the toxicity characteristic. Separate testing must be done for ignitability, corrosivity, and reactivity.

The basis for the use of this procedure developed from EPA’s concern that if these monolithic solids do not physically break down during disposal, it would be inappropriate to grind the waste into smaller particles than is necessary for elutriate testing. Certainly the leaching characteristics for a divided waste will be quite different from that of the waste in monolithic form. The structural integrity procedure was designed to be...|$|R
