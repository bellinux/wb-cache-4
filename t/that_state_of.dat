500|$|In 1997, DiCaprio {{starred in}} James Cameron's Titanic (1997) as twenty-year-old Jack Dawson, a penniless Wisconsin man who wins two {{tickets for the}} third-class on the ill-fated RMS Titanic. DiCaprio {{initially}} refused to portray the character but was eventually encouraged to pursue the role by Cameron, who strongly believed in his acting ability. Against expectations, the film {{went on to become}} the highest-grossing film to date (it was surpassed in 2010 by Cameron's film Avatar), grossing more than $1.843 billion in box-office receipts worldwide, and transformed DiCaprio into a commercial movie superstar, resulting in fan worship among teenage girls and young women in general that became known as [...] "Leo-Mania". In May 1998, for example, his face appeared on the covers of at least four teen magazines, and three books about DiCaprio were among the top six paperbacks on The New York Times Best Seller list. More than 200 fans contacted the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to protest his not being nominated for the 70th Academy Awards. He was nominated for other high-profile awards, including a second Golden Globe nomination. Upon the success of Titanic, DiCaprio stated in 2000: [...] "I have no connection with me during that whole Titanic phenomenon and what my face became around the world [...] I'll never reach <b>that</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> popularity again, and I don't expect to.

On 9 June, she got underway {{with the other}} warships of the 6th Battle Squadron {{and headed back to}} the anchorage at Scapa Flow, arriving there the following day. From 30 June to 2 July, Texas and her colleagues acted as escort for American minelayers adding to the North Sea mine barrage. After a two-day return to Scapa Flow, Texas put to sea with the Grand Fleet to conduct two days of tactical exercises and war games. At the conclusion of those drills on 8 July, the fleet entered the Firth of Forth. For the remainder of World War I, Texas and the other battleships of Division9 continued to operate with the Grand Fleet as the 6th Battle Squadron. With the German Fleet increasingly tied to its bases in the estuaries of the Jade and the Ems rivers, the American and British ships settled into a routine schedule of operations with little-to-no hint of combat operations. <b>That</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> affairs lasted until the Armistice ended hostilities on 11 November 1918.

50|$|He <b>stated</b> <b>that</b> {{achieving}} a formless attainment with no further practice would {{only lead to}} temporary rebirth in a formless realm after death. Moreover, he gave a pragmatic refutation of early Brahminical theories according to which the meditator, the meditative state, and the proposed uncaused, unborn, unanalyzable Self, are identical. These theories are undergirded by the Upanishadic correspondence between macrocosm and microcosm, from which perspective {{it is not surprising}} <b>that</b> meditative <b>states</b> <b>of</b> consciousness were thought to be identical to the subtle strata of the cosmos. The Buddha, in contrast, argued <b>that</b> <b>states</b> <b>of</b> consciousness come about caused and conditioned by the yogi's training and techniques, and therefore no <b>state</b> <b>of</b> consciousness could be this eternal Self.|$|R

2500|$|Spinoza, in his Tractatus theologico-politicus, {{tried to}} give Van den Enden's {{political}} ideas a foundation in his own philosophy, {{by pointing out that}} democracy is the best form of government [...] "approaching most closely to that freedom which nature grants to every man". Other than Thomas Hobbes, Spinoza posited that Man does not give up the rights he possesses in the state of Nature to the State, when he enters the social contract.
