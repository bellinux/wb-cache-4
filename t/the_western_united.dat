5|$|It is {{different}} for places with a Mediterranean climate. In <b>the</b> <b>western</b> <b>United</b> States, {{during the cold}} season from September–May, extratropical cyclones from the Pacific Ocean move inland into the region due to a southward migration of the jet stream during the cold season. This shift in the jet stream brings much of the annual precipitation to the region, and sometimes also brings heavy rain and strong low pressure systems. The peninsula of Italy has weather very similar to <b>the</b> <b>western</b> <b>United</b> States in this regard.|$|E
