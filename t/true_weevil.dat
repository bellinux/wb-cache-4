5|$|Psylliodes luridipennis, {{commonly}} known as the Lundy cabbage flea beetle or the bronze Lundy cabbage flea beetle, is a species of flea beetle endemic to the island of Lundy, where it lives and feeds upon the endemic Lundy cabbage (Coincya wrightii). Along with the <b>true</b> <b>weevil</b> Ceutorhynchus contractus var. pallipes and an undescribed race of flea beetle Psylliodes napi, it is known only from the Lundy cabbage. The species was first recorded by Thomas Vernon Wollaston in the 1840s, and was named by the Austrian entomologist Franz Kutschera in 1864.|$|E
5|$|Adult Psylliodes luridipennis beetles are {{invariably}} {{found on}} the Lundy cabbage (Coincya wrightii), a species endemic to the island of Lundy, where they feed on the leaves. They are not found on other locally occurring plants. However, researchers were also able to lure the beetles onto other crucifers taken from gardens. Two other taxa are known only from Lundy cabbages—the <b>true</b> <b>weevil</b> Ceutorhynchus contractus var. pallipes and an undescribed race of the flea beetle Psylliodes napi—making the plant unique to Britain as the only endemic species which is the exclusive host to endemic insect species. However, the Lundy cabbage is also host to a diverse variety of other invertebrate species.|$|E
5|$|Two {{invertebrate}} taxa are {{endemic to}} Lundy, with both feeding on the endemic Lundy cabbage (Coincya wrightii). These are the Lundy {{cabbage flea beetle}} (Psylliodes luridipennis), a species of leaf beetle (family Chrysomelidae) and the Lundy cabbage weevil (Ceutorhynchus contractus var. pallipes), a variety of <b>true</b> <b>weevil</b> (family Curculionidae). In addition, the Lundy cabbage is the main host of a flightless form of Psylliodes napi (another species of flea beetle) and {{a wide variety of}} other invertebrate species which are not endemic to the island. Another resident invertebrate of note is Atypus affinis, the only British species of purseweb spider.|$|E
50|$|Because so {{many species}} exist in such diversity, the higher {{classification}} of weevils is {{in a state}} of flux. They are generally divided into two major divisions, the Orthoceri or primitive weevils, and the Gonatoceri or <b>true</b> <b>weevils</b> (Curculionidae). E. C. Zimmerman proposed a third division, the Heteromorphi, for several intermediate forms. Primitive weevils are distinguished by having straight antennae, while <b>true</b> <b>weevils</b> have elbowed (geniculate) antennae. The elbow occurs at the end of the scape (first antennal segment) in <b>true</b> <b>weevils,</b> and the scape is usually much longer than the other antennal segments. Some exceptions occur. Nanophyini are primitive weevils (with very long trochanters), but have long scapes and geniculate antennae. From the <b>true</b> <b>weevils,</b> Gonipterinae and Ramphus have short scapes and little or no elbow.|$|R
