500|$|At Moscow, Kennan {{found the}} {{atmosphere}} even more regimented than on his previous trips, with police guards following him everywhere, discouraging contact with Soviet citizens. At the time, Soviet propaganda charged the U.S. with preparing for war, which Kennan did not wholly dismiss. [...] "I began <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>myself</b> whether... {{we had not}} contributed... by the overmilitarization of our policies and statements... to a belief in Moscow that it was war we were after, that we had settled for its inevitability, {{that it was only}} a matter of time before we would unleash it." ...|$|E
2500|$|At a Cannes press conference, {{after the}} {{identity}} of the donor was revealed, Moore said: [...] "I had <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>myself,</b> 'Would you write this check if this wasn't in the film?' I decided this is what I would do, and what I should do, {{and this is the way}} I want Americans to live." ...|$|E
2500|$|She {{revealed}} that {{after she had}} quit University and moved to London, England to focus on her music, she had completely changed her Personal Appearance. She said; [...] "Doing medicine, I {{had to be very}} conservative in how I looked and dressed. But arriving in London from Scotland, it seemed appropriate <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>myself,</b> OK, if you're no longer a medic, who are you?" [...] Sandé took her middle name Emeli on professionally two years before she hit the limelight as Adele had just risen to prominence. [...] "I changed it as soon as Adele came out. I just thought, 'You've kind of taken the [...] now', so I went with my middle name. She was just getting bigger and bigger, so I thought I just really need it." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "And I'm <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you for myself," [...] Jeanne {{continued}} {{with her hands}} clasped together as if in some small learnt prayer--"I'm <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you for <b>myself</b> if you won't positively come." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{from our}} good friend, Mynheer Van Voorden," [...] Edgar said. [...] "He is just leaving for Flanders, {{and has written}} <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> Albert and <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> {{accompany}} him thither." ...|$|R
2500|$|Additionally, {{the turmoil}} that Sue {{had been through}} had led Ratcliff to {{consider}} quitting the serial prematurely. In 1987 she told the magazine Woman's Own, [...] "'s been such an unhappy woman since Hassan died. And {{it was beginning to}} rub off on me. I'd go to work, six days a week, be stuck in that grim little cafe and be permanently miserable. I got to the stage when I started <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>myself</b> if I really wanted to spend all my working life playing a misery." [...] However, according to Ratcliff, the scriptwriters decision to make Sue pregnant changed her mind about leaving. She said, [...] "Now Sue is pregnant and happy I feel differently about the role. So maybe {{it would be fun to}} stick around for a couple more years - if I'm wanted." ...|$|E

60|$|They seemed amazingly busy. I began <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>myself</b> {{what they}} could be. Were they {{intelligent}} mechanisms? Such a thing I felt was impossible. Or did a Martian sit within each, ruling, directing, using, much as a man's brain sits and rules in his body? I began to compare the things to human machines, <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>myself</b> {{for the first time}} in my life how an ironclad or a steam engine would seem to an intelligent lower animal.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{only thing}} I have decided," [...] {{he said to}} Ned the next day, [...] "is <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> Mother Brown <b>myself</b> how much Mather paid her. We may as well settle that {{question}} first." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have not}} dared <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> even <b>myself</b> this," [...] she said, [...] "but {{since you are}} here, since you have forced it upon me, I shall ask you and you will tell me. That night I had--what shall I call it?--a vision. I saw you shoot Henry Rochester. Now you are here you shall tell me if what I saw was the truth?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope {{he will be}} here to-morrow, for I have a {{question}} or two <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> him about <b>myself</b> of some consequence. And, my dear, whenever he comes, you had better let him look at little Bella's throat." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Upon my life," [...] said Mr. Traveller, [...] "I {{was made}} <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>myself</b> that very {{question}} {{only a few}} minutes ago--by a Tinker too." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I doubt it," [...] said Mr. Fyshe. [...] "In fact, Newberry, {{to speak}} very frankly, I begin <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>myself,</b> Is Furlong {{the man for}} the post?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I had," [...] Maraton admitted, [...] "but {{the time}} came when I was forced <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>myself</b> whether they were not rather the plans of the dreamer and the theorist, when I was forced <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>myself</b> whether I was {{justified}} in destroying this generation {{for the sake of}} those to come. Life, after all, is a marvellous gift. You and I may believe in immortality, but who can be sure? It is easy enough to play chess, but when the pawns are human lives, who would not hesitate?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course I am!" [...] she answered. [...] "Didn't {{you know}} it?" [...] She seemed astonished, but I was still more so, for Corvick {{had told me}} the exact contrary. I didn't mention this, however; I only {{reminded}} her how little I had been on that score in her confidence, or even in Corvick's, and that, moreover I wasn't in ignorance of her mother's interdict. At bottom I was troubled by the disparity of the two accounts; but after a little I felt Corvick's {{to be the one}} I least doubted. This simply reduced me <b>to</b> <b>asking</b> <b>myself</b> if the girl had on the spot improvised an engagement--vamped up an old one or dashed off a new--in order to arrive at the satisfaction she desired. She must have had resources of which I was destitute, but she made her case slightly more intelligible by returning presently: [...] "What the state of things has been is that we felt of course bound to do nothing in mamma's lifetime." ...|$|R
5000|$|His first novel, Entangled: The Eater of Souls, {{the first}} in a fantasy series, was {{published}} in the UK in April 2010 and in the US in October 2010. The novel makes use of Hancock's prior research interests and as he has noted, [...] "What was there <b>to</b> lose, I <b>asked</b> <b>myself,</b> when my critics already described my factual books as fiction?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course I am!" [...] she answered. [...] "Didn't {{you know}} it?" [...] She {{appeared}} astonished; but I was still more so, for Corvick {{had told me}} the exact contrary. I didn't mention this, however; I only reminded her that I had not been to that degree in her confidence, or even in Corvick's, and that moreover I was not in ignorance of her mother's interdict. At bottom I was troubled by the disparity of the two assertions; but after a moment I felt that Corvick's was the one I least doubted. This simply reduced me <b>to</b> <b>asking</b> <b>myself</b> if the girl had on the spot improvised an engagement--vamped up an old one or dashed off a new--in order {{to arrive at the}} satisfaction she desired. I reflected that she had resources of which I was destitute; but she made her case slightly more intelligible by rejoining presently: [...] "What the state of things has been is that we felt of course bound to do nothing in mamma's lifetime." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] said he, [...] "it is {{the very}} {{question}} which I have had occasion <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>myself.</b> I would give a good deal to know. Take it in your hands and examine it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Surely it is I," [...] {{the lady}} sighed, [...] "although {{sometimes}} I am well-nigh inclined <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>myself</b> {{whether it be}} truly I or not, or whether this be not all a dreadful dream." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have had}} to ask myself," [...] the Prince continued,--"it has been my {{business}} <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>myself</b> what is your position as a great military power, and the answer I have found is that as a great military power it does not exist. I have had <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>myself</b> {{what would happen to}} your country {{in the case of a}} European war, where your fleet was distributed to guard your vast possessions in every quarter of the world, and the answer to that is that you are, to all practical purposes, defenceless. In almost any combination which could arrange itself, your country is at the mercy of the invader." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{glad you}} are so prompt," [...] said she. [...] "Promptness {{is one of the}} most {{important}} things in life. Now I am very, very busy these days, as you know, so we will begin school at once. Before either of you ask any questions, I am going <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> some <b>myself.</b> Peter, what do you look like? Where do you live? What do you eat? I want to find out just how much you really know about yourself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In my trusting way," [...] he said, [...] "I had {{imagined}} that {{either you or}} Comrade Brady {{was in charge of}} this expedition and taking me by a known route to the nearest subway station. I did not think <b>to</b> <b>ask.</b> I placed <b>myself,</b> without hesitation, wholly in your hands." ...|$|R
40|$|Recently, I {{asked my}} German-speaking, Berlin-based {{daughter}} Nanna {{whether she was}} able to understand our English-speaking neighbour when he talks with his daughter, Nanna’s best friend. Nanna laughed and obviously thought my question to be funny and replied: “Mami, ich kann doch kein Berlinisch!” which could be roughly translated as “Mummy, you know I don’t speak Berlinish!”. Of course, I also had <b>to</b> laugh and <b>asked</b> <b>myself</b> what it might mean that a German five-year old, with an otherwise fairly good understanding of semantic categories, confuses the language English with a German dialect...|$|R
6000|$|... 21. Having now {{sufficiently}} observed, {{it seems}} to me, this incongruous plant, I proceed <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>myself,</b> over it, M. Figuier's question, 'Qu'est-ce c'est qu'un Pensée?' Is this a violet--or a pansy--or a bad imitation of both? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That," [...] she remarked, [...] "rather {{interests}} me. Still, it is {{only what}} I should have expected. No, I {{do not think that}} I will sit down. I am trying <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>myself</b> exactly why I have come." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, my lord. This is {{a matter}} in which I could obey no friend, no father. I have had <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>myself,</b> and I have told myself that I do not dare to love above my station in life." ...|$|E
60|$|At {{the close}} of the third day Ajor and I were able to {{converse}} with considerable fluency, {{and it was a great}} relief to both of us, especially to Ajor. She now did nothing but ask questions whenever I would let her, which could not be all the time, as our preservation depended largely upon the rapidity with which I could gain knowledge of the geography and customs of Caspak, and accordingly I had <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> numerous questions <b>myself.</b>|$|R
50|$|Although not of {{the stature}} of his cousins, the Dwnns, Ieuan Deulwyn was not a poor man. The 1609 {{freeholder}} survey in Kidwelly confirms that he had property that passed through several generations. His son William was a gentleman and his daughter Elen married well. In marrying Cecily Rede, Ieuan himself married a woman of “one of the most notable of burghal families”. In “I Ferch a’i Gwallt” Ieuan praises “the girl I am going <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> for <b>myself</b> as a gift,” which may refer to Cecily. He alludes to the stature of her family:Her father is like Hu Gadarn figure from the Mabinogion;Great is his concern about a husband for his daughter.He will never give her in a red-gold girdleTo anyone except {{the same kind of}} gold.|$|R
5000|$|The {{song was}} written by {{founding}} band members Maurice White and Verdine White in collaboration with Reginald [...] "Sonny" [...] Burke. Earth Wind & Fire vocalist Philip Bailey later commented on the [...] "serpentine fire" [...] metaphor: [...] "Maurice White {{at that point in}} time in our career was studying a lot of metaphysics and a lot of Eastern philosophy, and the 'Serpentine Fire' - I’m not an expert on that whole thing, because I had <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> him <b>myself</b> explain - but it's actually the sex drive - or sexual impulse". Although Maurice White was evidently responsible for the song's title, Earth Wind & Fire keyboardist/musical director Larry Dunn credits the song's [...] "basic premise" [...] to Sonny Burke a veteran arranger and keyboardist featured on many R&B recordings although his only credited connection with Earth, Wind & Fire is as the co-writer of [...] "Serpentine Fire".|$|R
6000|$|Madame Munster {{looked at}} him again; and then, smiling: [...] "And I have {{certainly}} had time, since I got here, <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>myself</b> why I came. However, I never ask myself idle questions. Here I am, {{and it seems to}} me you ought only to thank me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Mr. Bounderby,' {{she went}} on in a steady, {{straight}} way, without regarding this, 'asks me to marry him. The question I have <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>myself</b> is, shall I marry him? That is so, father, is it not? You have told me so, father. Have you not?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do not know," [...] he answered, vaguely. [...] "I {{have never}} asked myself. I {{do not wish}} <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>myself.</b> Why do you speak of her? She is not of our world, the world to which I want to belong. I want to forget her." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{riding light}} in the forerigging burned with a clear, untroubled, as if symbolic, flame, {{confident}} and bright in the mysterious shades of the night. Passing on my way aft along {{the other side of}} the ship, I observed that the rope side ladder, put over, no doubt, for the master of the tug when he came to fetch away our letters, had not been hauled in as it should have been. I became annoyed at this, for exactitude in some small matters is the very soul of discipline. Then I reflected that I had myself peremptorily dismissed my officers from duty, and by my own act had prevented the anchor watch being formally set and things properly attended <b>to.</b> I <b>asked</b> <b>myself</b> whether it was wise ever to interfere with the established routine of duties even from the kindest of motives. My action might have made me appear eccentric. Goodness only knew how that absurdly whiskered mate would [...] "account" [...] for my conduct, and what the whole ship thought of that informality of their new captain. I was vexed with myself.|$|R
60|$|He turned then {{to answer}} the whistle, and I re-entered my own car. We started first, but they passed us {{in a few minutes}} {{travelling}} at a great rate, and with a cloud of dust behind them. Delora threw an evil glance at me from his place. For once I had stolen a march upon him. They had both been too ignorant of their route to keep their final destination concealed from the chauffeur, and they certainly had not expected to meet any one on the way with whom he would be likely to talk! But why <b>to</b> Newcastle? I <b>asked</b> <b>myself</b> that question so often during the morning that my shooting became purely a mechanical thing. Newcastle,--the Tyne, coals, and shipbuilding! I could think of nothing else in connection with the place.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Bolton {{left them}} at her hint of {{something}} special {{to say to}} the minister. Annie could not have had the face to speak of Mr. Brandreth's theatricals in that grim presence; and as it was, she resolved to put forward their serious object. She began abruptly: [...] "Mr. Peck, I've been <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> interest <b>myself</b> for a Social Union which the ladies of South Hatboro' are trying to establish for the operatives. I suppose you haven't heard anything of the scheme?" ...|$|R
