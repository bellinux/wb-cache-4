2500|$|Caledonian's short-haul re-equipment {{effort to}} replace the {{remaining}} obsolete piston and turboprop airliners in its fleet, initially focused on Boeing's 737. It intended {{to place an order}} for three series 200 aircraft before the end of 1967. The aircraft were to be delivered by spring 1969 to accomplish the transition to an all-jet fleet ahead of the 1969 summer charter season. As the 737 was an all-American aircraft like the previously ordered 707, Caledonian needed to approach the BOT once more to request an import tax exemption. Predictably, the BOT opposed this. It threatened to withdraw the <b>tax</b> <b>concession</b> it had granted the airline to import brand-new 707s free of duty if 737s were selected instead of One-Eleven 500s. Caledonian did not favour the One-Eleven 500 because it could not match the 737-200's range, which was reckoned sufficient to fly British holidaymakers non-stop from the UK to the Canary Islands and to destinations in the Eastern Mediterranean, as well as lower costs per seat mile {{as a result of the}} latter's wider fuselage accommodating a greater number of passengers seated six (rather than five) across. In the cut-throat short-/medium-haul charter airline business these were important cost and marketing advantages that could make all the difference between profit and loss. In addition to the risk of losing the BOT's <b>tax</b> <b>concession</b> to import new 707s duty-free into the UK outweighing the 737-200's range and cost advantage over the One-Eleven 500, sterling's devaluation together with increases in Boeing's basic sales price had made ordering One-Elevens more attractive financially. Based on an order for four aircraft valued at £7.5 million, buying an equivalent number of 737s was £1-1.5 million more expensive. Another factor swinging Caledonian's short-haul re-equipment decision in favour of the British aircraft was the manufacturer's ability to offer the Scottish airline a high-density, 109-seat version featuring an increased range of [...] (compared with [...] for the baseline 97-seat, single-class One-Eleven 500 ordered by BEA). This brought most of the Mediterranean and North Africa within range. These considerations resulted in Caledonian placing an order for three One-Eleven 500s for delivery in 1969. It also took out an option on a fourth aircraft, which was to be delivered in 1970 if confirmed.|$|E

40|$|Overview: Super <b>tax</b> <b>concessions</b> are {{increasingly}} being used by high income earners {{as a way of}} minimising their tax. This is not their original purpose. They were designed to encourage people to save for their retirement so they would be more self-reliant and less dependent on taxpayers. 80 per cent of those who are of eligible age are on the age pension or part pension and this is predicted to still be the case in 2050. It would seem that super <b>tax</b> <b>concessions</b> are not working. Worse, almost $ 18 billion (60 per cent) of super <b>tax</b> <b>concessions</b> are going to the top 20 per cent of income earners. These are the people most likely {{to be a part of}} the 20 per cent not receiving an age pension. There is no economic justification for taxpayer’s money being spent on enlarging the super balances of those that are not likely to ever claim a pension. This means that about $ 18 billion is being wasted each year on unnecessary <b>tax</b> <b>concessions.</b> Reform of super <b>tax</b> <b>concessions</b> is long overdue and should start from the principle that the only justification for using taxpayer’s money is if it reduces long term impacts on the budget.  ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} {{criticism}} of <b>tax</b> <b>concessions</b> has {{lost sight of}} the legitimate reasons for many of them. Overview While action is needed to correct structural budget deficits, the criticism of <b>tax</b> <b>concessions</b> has {{lost sight of the}} legitimate reasons for many of them, and often overestimates the revenue gain. On the whole, the so-called concessions for capital gains tax, negative gearing, superannuation, dividend imputation, and the goods and services tax are not really concessions at all but legitimate structural features of the tax system, and in some cases are essential to prevent distortions arising from taxation of savings and investment. Tinkering with <b>tax</b> <b>concessions</b> to raise more revenue on its own does not constitute beneficial <b>tax</b> reform. <b>Concessions</b> should only be reconsidered {{in the context of a}} broader restructuring of the tax system as a whole...|$|R

50|$|An urban {{enterprise}} zone {{is an area}} in which policies to encourage economic growth and development are implemented.

50|$|Chen’s {{interest}} in the economic circumstances of the aged dates to the beginnings {{of his career in}} the early 1960s, during which he conducted research examining the efficacy of tax measures favoring older people. As a result of this work his assistance was sought in the crafting and implementation of innovative “circuit-breaker” legislation in Wisconsin (involving property tax relief to older renters) and in California (involving a sliding scale for property <b>tax</b> <b>concession,</b> based on the assessed value of the older person’s home and his or her income). His ongoing scholarship and policy development on the economic circumstances of older people have emphasized the combined role of macroeconomic policies and individual behavior in providing economic security, while also stressing the problematic nature of achieving economic security in old age without accessible and adequately financed health care and long-term care.|$|E
50|$|Ottley's own {{compensation}} {{took the}} form of commissions to collect taxes in Shropshire, which he undertook with his close friend and business partner, Richard Scriven, later MP for Bishop's Castle First they were made receivers of the county's hearth tax, the key tax on property. In 1663 they made a successful bid of £2,800 for the farm of the county's excise. However, the hearth <b>tax</b> <b>concession</b> was revoked in 1667 and Ottley and Scriven were ordered to pay arrears of £700. They sought to collect the amounts owing but this led to public disorder, with distrained goods and papers being stolen. To help his efforts at repayment, he was given any prize-money concealed during the Commonwealth that he could discover. He and Scriven were also granted all treasure trove found since the Restoration, as well as part of a Cheshire outlaw’s estate. However, they were still unsuccessful. Ottley's arrears were remitted shortly before he died in 1670, although Scriven did not settle his debt until 1682.|$|E
50|$|The scheme {{dates to}} 1946, when food {{rationing}} {{was still in}} force {{following the end of}} the war. The British government granted an extra-statutory <b>tax</b> <b>concession,</b> believing that this would help citizens afford healthy meals. Under the concession, luncheon vouchers are free of income tax and national insurance contributions up to the value of 3 shillings (15 pence) a day. The initial level of 2s. 3d. (11.25p) was increased in 1948 to its current level of 3/- (15p), but has not been adjusted for inflation since. The UK government announced in March 2011 its intention to abolish this relief with effect from April 2013, although this was subject to independent advice from the Office of Tax Simplification following wider consultation. The abolition of the concession, effective from 6 April 2013, was confirmed in December 2011, with the government maintaining its view that the relief was redundant given that it is worth only 15p per day.|$|E
