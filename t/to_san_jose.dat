5|$|As {{it connects}} to I-580, I-205 is a frequently-congested major {{commuter}} {{route to the}} Bay Area. Signs on eastbound I-580 instruct travelers to take I-205, SR120, and SR99 to reach Modesto instead of using the direct, but non-freeway, route SR132. I-205 also serves to connect the Bay Area with popular weekend destinations such as Yosemite, Reno, and Lake Tahoe. The Altamont Commuter Express provides commuters with an alternate route over Altamont Pass <b>to</b> <b>San</b> <b>Jose</b> and San Francisco, the latter through a transfer to BART.|$|E
5|$|The Interstate 780 state-maintained freeway {{begins at}} Lemon Street and Curtola Parkway, quickly {{crossing}} underneath I-80 at a cloverleaf interchange. The freeway passes through parts of unincorporated Solano County, then heads southeast along the Benicia State Recreation Area (a marsh). It then bypasses downtown Benicia through the hills to the north. I-780 ends at I-680 {{at the north}} end of the Benicia-Martinez Bridge, with I-680 heading south through the East Bay <b>to</b> <b>San</b> <b>Jose.</b>|$|E
5|$|While the {{district}} includes {{all of the}} cities and communities in its jurisdiction, some of these cities do not have stations on the BART system. This has caused tensions among property owners in cities like Livermore who pay BART taxes but must travel outside the city to receive BART service. In areas like Fremont, the majority of commuters do not commute in the direction that BART would take them (many Fremonters commute <b>to</b> <b>San</b> <b>Jose,</b> where there is currently no BART service). This would be alleviated with {{the completion of a}} BART-to-San Jose extension project and the opening of the Berryessa Station in San Jose.|$|E

5|$|Before the Dumbarton and San Mateo-Hayward Bridges {{were built}} across the San Francisco Bay in the 1920s, San Francisco was bottled {{up at the}} north end of a long peninsula, with driving south on El Camino Real towards San Jose as the only {{reasonable}} alternative to the ferries for crossing the bay. The first of several highways built as an alternate to El Camino Real was the Skyline Boulevard, which was added to the state highway system in 1919. A second route, the Bay Shore Highway (Route 68), became a state highway in 1923, but only from the San Francisco city limits into San Mateo County, where the Dumbarton Bridge would begin. Just prior to the start of construction on the Dumbarton Bridge, San Francisco Supervisor Richard J. Welch noted that the Bay Shore Highway would need to be built all the way <b>to</b> <b>San</b> <b>Jose</b> as an escape valve for the additional traffic that the bridge would attract.|$|E
5|$|The 7th Division was {{assigned}} to III Corps of the Fourth United States Army, and transferred to Longview, Washington, in August 1941 to participate in tactical maneuvers. Following this training, the division moved back to Fort Ord, California, where it was located when the Japanese attack of Pearl Harbor caused the United States to declare war. The formation proceeded almost immediately <b>to</b> <b>San</b> <b>Jose,</b> California, arriving 11 December 1941 to help protect the west coast and allay civilian fears of invasion. The 53rd Infantry Regiment {{was removed from the}} 7th Division and replaced with the 159th Infantry Regiment, newly deployed from the California Army National Guard. For the early parts of the war, the division participated mainly in construction and training roles. Subordinate units also practiced boat loading at the Monterey Wharf and amphibious assault techniques at the Salinas River in California.|$|E
5|$|The Bayshore Freeway {{begins at}} the Blossom Hill Road {{interchange}} on US 101, where SR 82 begins its northwesterly path along Monterey Highway <b>to</b> <b>San</b> <b>Jose.</b> The freeway curves north and northwest, bypassing downtown San Jose to the east, and then curves west-northwest, crossing I-880 and SR 87, the latter {{just north of the}} San Jose International Airport. The portion of the highway from San Jose to South San Francisco is relatively straight and flat, running near the west edge of the San Francisco Bay. Junctions here include SR 237 in Sunnyvale, SR 85 in Mountain View, SR 84 in Menlo Park and Redwood City, SR 92 in San Mateo, and the San Francisco International Airport and I-380 in San Bruno. In South San Francisco, the freeway curves northeast around San Bruno Mountain, crossing its east edge at Sierra Point, and then heads north on a causeway across the former Candlestick Cove to the San Francisco city line.|$|E

5|$|Ballard {{continued}} {{to be used as}} a third-pairing defenseman in his second season with Vancouver. He missed five contests in November and December 2011 due to a back injury, before sustaining a season-ending concussion on February 5, 2012. Initially undetected, the injury was caused by two separate hits during a game against the Colorado Avalanche. He remained in the lineup for the following contest before being diagnosed with the injury. His season ended with 1 goal and 7 points over 47 games. His third season with the Canucks was shortened by the 2012–13 NHL lockout. When the season started Ballard was again on the Canucks third pairing with Tanev. Early in the season the two were the Canucks' most consistent pairing. An injury to Kevin Bieksa allowed Andrew Alberts to get into the line-up and split the Ballard-Tanev pairing. After Bieksa's return it was Ballard who was removed from the line-up becoming a healthy scratch. In late March Vancouver suffered several injuries up front to help fill the void Ballard returned to the line-up as a forward. He played three games before suffering a broken foot. Though he was healthy by the playoffs Vancouver opted to play Alberts and rookie Frank Corrado in the first round lost <b>to</b> <b>San</b> <b>Jose.</b> He finished the year playing in 36 games and recording two assists.|$|E
5|$|In 1575, a Spanish {{exploration}} party led by Sebastian Rodriguez Cermeno {{landed in}} Drakes Bay near Point Reyes {{and was the}} first European settler to claim land in the Bay Area. He was soon followed in 1579 by Sir Francis Drake, who also landed in Drakes Bay and claimed the land for England. The San Francisco Bay itself remained undiscovered by Europeans until a Spanish expedition led by Gaspar de Portolà sailed through the Golden Gate Strait in 1769. Further expeditions by Spanish explorers in the following years include those led by Juan Bautista de Anza who colonized the Presidio, and Gabriel Moraga who started at the Presidio and led expedition parties <b>to</b> <b>San</b> <b>Jose</b> and over the Pacheco Pass, as well as reaching the San Joaquin Valley. In 1821, Mexico gained its independence from Spain and the Bay Area became part of the Mexican province of Alta California, a period characterized by ranch life and visiting American trappers. Mexico's control of the territory would be short-lived, however, and in 1846, a party of settlers occupied Sonoma Plaza and proclaimed the independence of the new Republic of California. That same year, the Mexican-American War began, and American captain John Berrien Montgomery sailed the USS Portsmouth into the bay and seized San Francisco, which was then known as Yerba Buena, and raised the American flag for the first time over Portsmouth Square.|$|E
