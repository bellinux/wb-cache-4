The <b>turbojet</b> engine was removed and the fuel hose and its drogue extended {{out from the}} jet's former exhaust opening. Aircraft in service retained the <b>turbojet</b> and had their bomb bay doors modified to accommodate the hose and drogue. They were refueling aircraft during late 1954.|$|E

5|$|On 20July1951, the P.1067 {{made its}} maiden flight, flown by Neville Duke, from RAF Boscombe Down, {{powered by a}} single 6,500lbf (28.91kN) Avon 103 engine. The second prototype, which was fitted with production-standard avionics, {{armament}} and a 7,550lbf (33.58kN) Avon 107 <b>turbojet,</b> first flew on 5May1952. As an insurance against development problems {{on the part of}} the Avon engine, Hawker modified the design to accommodate another axial <b>turbojet,</b> the 8,000lbf (35.59kN) Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire 101.

5|$|Both Northrop and General Dynamics (GD) {{responded to}} the FX requirement. GD's F-16/79 was {{a variant of the}} F-16A, {{replacing}} the Pratt & Whitney F100 turbofan engine with the J79 <b>turbojet</b> and equipping it with downgraded avionics; Northrop responded with the F-5G.|$|E
5|$|Concorde {{needed to}} fly long {{distances}} to be economically viable; this required high efficiency from the powerplant. Turbofan engines were rejected {{due to their}} larger cross-section producing excessive drag. Olympus <b>turbojet</b> technology was available to be developed to meet the design requirements of the aircraft, although turbofans would be studied for any future SST.|$|E

5|$|On Thursday, 21 October 1948, Boeing {{engineers}} George S. Schairer, Art Carlsen and Vaughn Blumenthal {{presented the}} design of a four-engine turboprop bomber to the chief of bomber development, Colonel Pete Warden. Warden was disappointed by the projected aircraft and asked if the Boeing team could come up with a proposal for a four-engine <b>turbojet</b> bomber. Joined by Ed Wells, Boeing vice president of engineering, the engineers worked that night in the Hotel Van Cleve in Dayton, Ohio, redesigning Boeing's proposal as a four-engine <b>turbojet</b> bomber. On Friday, Colonel Warden looked over the information and asked for a better design. Returning to the hotel, the Boeing team was joined by Bob Withington and Maynard Pennell, two top Boeing engineers who were in town on other business.|$|E

5|$|Great {{confidence}} {{was placed in}} being able to reduce the noise of a <b>turbojet</b> and massive strides by SNECMA in silencer design were reported during the programme. However, by 1974 the spade silencers which projected into the exhaust were reported to be ineffective. The Olympus Mk.622 with reduced jet velocity was proposed to reduce the noise but it was not developed.|$|E
5|$|In 1944, Republic Aviation's chief designer, Alexander Kartveli, {{began working}} on a turbojet-powered {{replacement}} for the P-47 Thunderbolt piston-engined fighter. The initial attempts to redesign the P-47 to accommodate a jet engine proved futile due to the large cross-section of the early centrifugal compressor turbojets. Instead, Kartveli and his team designed a new aircraft with a streamlined fuselage largely occupied by an axial compressor <b>turbojet</b> engine and fuel stored in rather thick unswept wings.|$|E
5|$|In May 1948, AMC asked Boeing to {{incorporate}} the previously discarded, but now more fuel-efficient, jet engine into the design. That resulted {{in the development of}} yet another revision—in July 1948, Model 464-40 substituted Westinghouse J40 turbojets for the turboprops. The Air Force project officer who reviewed the Model 464-40 was favorably impressed, especially since he had already been thinking along similar lines. Nevertheless, the government was concerned about the high fuel consumption rate of the jet engines of the day, and directed that Boeing still use the turboprop-powered Model 464-35 {{as the basis for the}} XB-52. Although he agreed that <b>turbojet</b> propulsion was the future, General Howard A. Craig, Deputy Chief of Staff for Material, was not very keen on a jet-powered B-52, since he felt that the jet engine had not yet progressed sufficiently to permit skipping an intermediate turboprop stage. However, Boeing was encouraged to continue <b>turbojet</b> studies even without any expected commitment to jet propulsion.|$|E
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, <b>turbojets</b> {{accelerate}} {{a much smaller}} mass flow of intake air and burned fuel, but they then reject it at very high speed. When a de Laval nozzle is used to accelerate a hot engine exhaust, the outlet velocity may be locally supersonic. <b>Turbojets</b> are particularly suitable for aircraft travelling at very high speeds.|$|R
50|$|<b>Turbojets</b> are {{the second}} oldest type; {{it has a}} high, usually supersonic, exhaust speed and low frontal cross-section, and so is best suited to high-speed, usually supersonic, flight. Although once widely used, they are {{relatively}} inefficient compared to turboprop and turbofans for subsonic flight. The last major aircraft to use <b>turbojets</b> were Concorde and Tu-144 supersonic transports.|$|R

5|$|Later {{production}} Tu-144 versions {{were more}} refined and competitive. They had retractable canards for better low-speed control, <b>turbojet</b> engines providing nearly the fuel efficiency {{and range of}} Concorde and {{a top speed of}} Mach 2.35. Passenger service commenced in November 1977, but after the 1978 crash the aircraft was taken out of service. The aircraft had an inherently unsafe structural design as a consequence of an automated production method chosen to simplify and speed up manufacturing.|$|E
5|$|On 11 September 1944, the USAAF {{released}} General Operational Requirements {{for a day}} fighter with a {{top speed}} of 600mph (521kn, 966km/h), combat radius of 705miles (612nmi, 1,135km), and armament of either six 0.50in (12.7mm) or four 0.60in (15.2mm) machine guns. In addition, the new aircraft had to use the General Electric TG-180 axial <b>turbojet</b> which entered production as the Allison J35.|$|E
5|$|The Comet was {{powered by}} {{two pairs of}} <b>turbojet</b> engines buried in the wings close to the fuselage. Chief {{designer}} Bishop chose the Comet's embedded-engine configuration because it avoided the drag of podded engines and allowed for a smaller fin and rudder, since the hazards of asymmetric thrust were reduced. The engines were outfitted with baffles to reduce noise emissions, and extensive soundproofing was also implemented to improve passenger conditions.|$|E
