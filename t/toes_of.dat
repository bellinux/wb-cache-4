5|$|Barnes {{gripped the}} bat very {{low on the}} handle and bent over so far in his stance that the {{knuckles}} {{of his right hand}} were level with his knees. He stood with his heels almost together and the <b>toes</b> <b>of</b> his left foot pointing toward extra cover, which left him open-chested when facing the bowler. A noticeable flourish in his backlift enabled him to follow the swinging delivery and play it late if necessary. His first movement was back and across the crease to cover the stumps from the view of the bowler, putting him in position to play the hook, leg glance, sweep and his favourite square cut shot.|$|E
5|$|Frogs {{that live}} in or visit water have adaptations that improve their {{swimming}} abilities. The hind limbs are heavily muscled and strong. The webbing between the <b>toes</b> <b>of</b> the hind feet increases {{the area of the}} foot and helps propel the frog powerfully through the water. Members of the family Pipidae are wholly aquatic and show the most marked specialization. They have inflexible vertebral columns, flattened, streamlined bodies, lateral line systems, and powerful hind limbs with large webbed feet. Tadpoles mostly have large tail fins which provide thrust when the tail is moved from side to side.|$|E
5|$|Newton {{moved to}} London {{to take up}} the post of warden of the Royal Mint in 1696, a {{position}} that he had obtained through the patronage of Charles Montagu, 1st Earl of Halifax, then Chancellor of the Exchequer. He took charge of England's great recoining, somewhat treading on the <b>toes</b> <b>of</b> Lord Lucas, Governor of the Tower (and securing the job of deputy comptroller of the temporary Chester branch for Edmond Halley). Newton became perhaps the best-known Master of the Mint upon the death of Thomas Neale in 1699, a position Newton held for the last 30 years of his life. These appointments were intended as sinecures, but Newton took them seriously, retiring from his Cambridge duties in 1701, and exercising his power to reform the currency and punish clippers and counterfeiters.|$|E

5|$|This {{curtailment}} of governors' {{powers as}} the Emperors' representatives may have lessened the political dangers of an all-too-powerful class of Imperial delegates, {{but it also}} severely limited governors' ability to oppose local landed elites, specially those of senatorial status, which, although with reduced opportunities for office holding, retained wealth, social prestige, and personal connections. â€“ specially in relatively peaceful regions without a great military presence. On one occasion, Diocletian had to exhort a proconsul of Africa not to fear the consequences of treading on the <b>toes</b> <b>of</b> the local magnates of senatorial rank. If a governor of senatorial rank himself felt these pressures, one can imagine the difficulties faced by a mere praeses. That accounts for the strained relationship between the central power and local elites: sometime during 303, an attempted military sedition in Seleucia Pieria and Antioch made Diocletian to extract a bloody retribution on both cities by putting to death a number of their council members for failing their duties of keeping order in their jurisdiction.|$|E
5|$|Dyer was {{a popular}} choice with boxing promoters, helped {{by the fact that}} after each bout he would sing Thora, a popular hit of the day to the audience. His careers as a pugilist and {{baritone}} earned him the nickname, 'The Singing Boxer'. His first few bouts were all held in south Wales, but by the autumn of 1910 he was travelling to England to fight, and on 10 October 1910 he was invited to fight at the National Sporting Club in Covent Garden, London. On 15 May 1911 Dyer was scheduled to fight Dick Emden at The Ring in Blackfriars, London. To date, Dyer had recorded over 15 bouts and was unbeaten but the fight with Emden ended in defeat and affected his future boxing career. Dyer was easily ahead in the bout, when in the fifth round he dislocated his knee and fell to the canvas in agony. Emden, who taunted the fallen Dyer, was given the victory and Dyer would not fight for another six months. The injury to his right knee plagued Dyer throughout his entire boxing career, and also stopped him serving in the armed forces during the First World War. After the injury, Dyer always fought with a protector strapped around his knee, and was forced to change his fighting style. He would always stand on the <b>toes</b> <b>of</b> his right foot, as a quick back step could possibly dislocate his knee again. His return bout in November 1911 was a win against Young Lilley at The Ring, but this was again followed by a long absence. Dyer did not fight again until 1 June 1912.|$|E
5|$|The African river martin feeds in flocks over {{river and}} forest, often far from water. It eats insects, mainly taking winged ants. The flight {{is strong and}} fast, {{interspersed}} with glides. Wintering birds regularly perch on treetops, wires and roofs. The white-eyed river martin feeds on insects, including beetles, which are caught on the wing. Given its size and unusual mouth structure, it may take larger insects than other swallows. This species is described as graceful and buoyant in flight, and, like its African relative, appears reluctant to use perches. This behaviour, together with its unusual toe-shape {{and the fact that}} mud was found on the <b>toes</b> <b>of</b> one of the first specimens, suggests that this species may be relatively terrestrial. In winter, it roosts with barn swallows in reedbeds. Pamela C. Rasmussen suggested that, given its unusually large eyes, the species might be nocturnal or crepuscular, a factor that could make it highly cryptic and thus partly explain how such a distinctive species remained undetected for so long. Although the fact that the first specimens were supposedly collected roosting at night in reed-beds might be a contraindication, {{it is possible that the}} birds might not actually have been caught at the roost; or they might be crepuscular, feeding at dawn and dusk; or they might be capable of both diurnal and nocturnal behaviour, depending on the season or local circumstances.|$|E

25|$|The movie {{replaces the}} charmed Silver Shoes with pointed <b>toes</b> <b>of</b> {{the book with}} Ruby-Red Slippers. This was because full color motion {{pictures}} were still a relatively new technology in 1939, and MGM wanted {{to show off the}} visually dazzling process. Shiny red shoes were more impressive in a color motion picture compared to silver ones. Due to the popularity of the movie, the green witch and the Ruby Slippers are more well known to the general public and pop culture than their book counterparts, and are even considered iconic.|$|E
25|$|Rhacophoridae flying frogs (gliding). A {{number of}} the Rhacophoridae, such as Wallace's flying frog (Rhacophorus nigropalmatus), have adaptations for gliding, the main feature being {{enlarged}} toe membranes. For example, the Malayan flying frog Rhacophorus prominanus glides using the membranes between the <b>toes</b> <b>of</b> its limbs, and small membranes located at the heel, {{the base of the}} leg, and the forearm. Some of the frogs are quite accomplished gliders, for example, the Chinese flying frog Rhacophorus dennysi can maneuver in the air, making two kinds of turn, either rolling into the turn (a banked turn) or yawing into the turn (a crabbed turn).|$|E

25|$|The earless {{water rat}} is adapted best {{to a life}} in water {{out of all the}} muroids. It has {{extremely}} long hindfeet, the <b>toes</b> <b>of</b> which are webbed completely, strongly reduced forelegs, absent or invisible ears, very small eyes, and a long tail with a row of hairs at the downside. That row starts at each side of the beginning of the tail as a long white row of hairs; these two rows merge at about 50mm {{from the beginning of the}} tail and the row goes on to the end of the tail. In all these characters, it resembles the elegant water shrew (Nectogale elegans), a good example of convergent evolution.|$|E
25|$|A yorker ball {{bounces off}} the pitch {{right in front}} of (or is aimed at the <b>toes</b> <b>of)</b> the batsman's feet, an area known as the block hole. Because of the usual stance of the batsman and the {{regulation}} length of the cricket bat the bat is not usually held near the ground while the batsman prepares to strike the ball, so playing a yorker requires the batsman to alter the height of his or her bat very quickly after detecting a yorker has been bowled. This is difficult, and the yorker can often squeeze through the gap and break the wicket. Successfully playing this type of delivery is also known as digging out a yorker.|$|E
25|$|Anchiornis has hindleg {{proportions}} {{more like}} those of more primitive theropod dinosaurs than avialans, with long legs indicating a fast-running lifestyle. However, while long legs normally indicate a fast runner, the legs and even feet and <b>toes</b> <b>of</b> Anchiornis were covered in feathers, including long feathers on the legs, {{similar to those in}} the hindwings of Microraptor. Long leg feathers on the lower legs may have slowed the running speed of Anchiornis. In modern birds, especially those that live on the ground, the lower legs tend to show reduction or even loss of feathers. The hind wings of Anchiornis were smaller and made of more curved, symmetrical feathers than those of Microraptor, suggesting that they were used mainly for display rather than flight. However, they might still have granted the animal some kind of aerodynamic advantage, even if their primary purpose was for display or some other function.|$|E

25|$|Although {{they appear}} to be similar to the untrained eye, crocodiles, {{alligators}} and the gharial belong to separate biological families. The gharial, with its narrow snout, is easier to distinguish, while morphological differences are more difficult to spot in crocodiles and alligators. The most obvious external differences are visible in the head, with crocodiles having narrower and longer heads, with a more V-shaped than a U-shaped snout compared to alligators and caimans. Another obvious trait is that the upper and lower jaws of the crocodiles are the same width, and the teeth in the lower jaw fall along the edge or outside the upper jaw when the mouth is closed; therefore, all teeth are visible, unlike an alligator, which possesses in the upper jaw small depressions into which the lower teeth fit. Also, when the crocodile's mouth is closed, the large fourth tooth in the lower jaw fits into a constriction in the upper jaw. For hard-to-distinguish specimens, the protruding tooth is the most reliable feature to define the species' family. Crocodiles have more webbing on the <b>toes</b> <b>of</b> the hind feet and can better tolerate saltwater due to specialized salt glands for filtering out salt, which are present, but non-functioning, in alligators. Another trait that separates crocodiles from other crocodilians is their much higher levels of aggression.|$|E
25|$|In December 2009 Alison Grieve, a 32-year-old {{waitress}} and event manager from Bruntsfield, Edinburgh, {{witnessed a}} waitress drop a tray full of glasses of champagne at a corporate event for {{a delegation of}} international lawyers. To address how a tray could right itself {{at the moment of}} impending tilt, Grieve, a first-time inventor with a university background in 'History of film and photography', developed a finger receiver attached to the bottom of a wait tray based on first-principle physics, load dispersal, and counter movement. In a closed position, the finger receiver lays flush with the bottom of the wait tray so that the tray can sit on the surface of a bar or table without wobbling and can be stacked onto other trays. When the device is open, two slots can be accessed into which a waitperson may secure their two inside fingers, similar to how a flip-flop structurally attaches itself between the <b>toes</b> <b>of</b> the foot to counter the large stresses place upon it. The Safetray product's arrangement creates a strong cantilever advantage for the waitperson to allow them additional control over torque caused by items placed in various locations around the tray. The stability achieved with the Safetray product allows a waitperson to place a bottle of wine right {{at the edge of the}} tray while still keeping the tray in a horizontal position by reacting instinctively against the bottle's off-balance downward force.|$|E
500|$|The breed {{tends to}} shed hair twice {{annually}} or regularly {{throughout the year}} in temperate climates. Some Labradors shed considerably; however, individual Labradors vary. Labrador hair is usually short and straight, and the tail is quite broad and strong. The webbed <b>toes</b> <b>of</b> the Labrador Retriever make them excellent swimmers. The webbing between their toes can {{also serve as a}} [...] "snowshoe" [...] in colder climates and keep snow from balling up between their toesâ€”a condition that can be painful to other breeds with hair between the toes. Their interwoven coat is also relatively waterproof, providing more assistance for swimming.|$|E

500|$|At {{least two}} stages of {{construction}} are recognized, Llullaillaco I and Llullaillaco II.

500|$|Balaur is a genus of {{theropod}} dinosaurs {{estimated to}} have lived about [...] {{years ago in the}} late Cretaceous (Maastrichtian), and contains the single species B. bondoc.

In addition to its strange feet, the type specimen of Balaur is unique for its status of being the most complete theropod fossil from the late Cretaceous of Europe. It also possesses a great number of additional autapomorphies, including a reduced and presumably nonfunctional third finger, consisting of only one rudimentary phalanx.|$|E
