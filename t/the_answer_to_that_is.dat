6000|$|We {{have another}} Example of a Man's selling {{himself to the}} Devil, that is very remarkable, and {{that is in the}} Bible too, and even in that, I do not find, what the Devil did for him, in Payment of the Purchase Price. The Person selling was Ahab, of whom the Text says expresly, there was none like him, who did sell himself to work Wickedness in the Sight of the LORD, 1 Kings xxi. 20, and the 25. I think it might have been rendred, if not {{translated}} in Spight of the Lord, or in Defiance of God; for certainly that's the Meaning of it; and now allowing me to preach a little upon this Text, my Sermon shall be very short. Ahab sold himself, who did he sell himself to? I answer that Question by a Question; who would buy him? who, as we say, would give any thing for him? and <b>the</b> <b>Answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> plain also, you may judge of the Purchaser by the Work he was to do; he that buys a Slave in the Market, buys him to work for him, and to do such Business as he has for him to do: Ahab was bought to work wickedness, and who would buy him for that but the Devil? ...|$|E

60|$|I {{know it will}} be said--I {{will not}} weary the House by arguing it, but I only desire to meet at once the {{objection}} that will be taken--that these councils will, if you take away the safeguard of the official majority, pass any number of wild-cat Bills. <b>The</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> {{that the head of}} the Government can veto the wild-cat Bills. The Governor-General can withhold his assent, and the withholding of the assent of the Governor-General is no defunct power. Only the other day, since I have been at the India Office, the Governor-General disallowed a Bill passed by a Local Government which I need not name, with the most advantageous effect. I am quite convinced that if that Local Government had had an unofficial majority the Bill would never have been passed, and the Governor-General would not have had to refuse his assent. But so he did, and so he would if these gentlemen, whose numbers we propose to increase and whose powers we propose to widen, chose to pass wild-cat Bills. And it must be remembered that the range of subjects within the sphere of Provincial Legislative Councils is rigorously limited by statutory exclusions. I will not labour the point now. Anybody who cares, in a short compass, can grasp the argument, of which we shall hear a great deal, in Paragraphs 17 to 20 of my reply to the Government of India, in the Papers that will speedily be in your Lordships' hands.|$|E

And, one must acknowledge that all good comes from the Lord only, and only the Lord can conquer temptation. This is a continuous process during one's lifetime.

50|$|If {{the key is}} to {{allocate}} appropriate time to each service based on historical OR use, {{how do you deal with}} rooms consistently running late on the day of surgery? The answer: make the allocated time, into which cases are being scheduled, longer. For example, if a surgeon does 12 hours worth of cases every day he is in the OR, don’t plan 8 hours of staffing (7am-3pm) and have everyone frustrated by having to stay late (overtime). Rather, schedule his cases into 12 hours of allocated time (7am-7pm). That way, anesthesia and nursing staff know they will be there 12 hours when they arrive to work and overtime costs (financial and morale) will be reduced. The common response to this approach is, “No one wants to be there till 7 pm.” <b>The</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>is,</b> “You are there now till 7 pm so why not make scheduled OR time 12 hr long and have a more predictable work day duration.” Thus, optimizing staffing costs is finding balance between overtime and finishing early.|$|E
50|$|Many {{consider}} {{the backbone of}} Dushyanths newfound fame to be his talented brother Santhush Weeraman of Sri Lankas commercially most successful pop act BNS. However saying that we must also consider that not all brothers and sisters of every successful artiste becomes as successful as Dushyanth has proved to be. From the latest big names such as Akon, Britney Spears to Legendary Frank Sinatra, Elvis and Michael Jackson had singlings too. But none of those siblings have stepped up as Dushyanth Weeraman has as a sibling of a Super Star. He is clearly Dushyanth Weeraman the Super Star himself and Santhush is coincidentally Dushyanths brother. Reference to a testimonial {{by one of the}} greatest musicians of Sri Lanka (mr.Aruna Siriwardena) Dushyanths singing skills are commendable & i admit he has to one of the best SINGERS in the industry. But why is the modest attention he receives being exaggerated to the point where its just plain ridiculous?

They expected that volunteered answers would be “disproportionately from men” and would lead to the “same small group of students dominating whole-class discussions.” Participants expected that randomly selecting students to share their thinking would result in “a greater diversity of students reporting answers in class” and would support “a whole community of students, rather than just the one loud student up front.” Hearing from a small number of students may limit an instructor’s ability to effectively monitor and respond to student thinking in real time.|$|E

If <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> yes, again, why is the project funded in the first place?
