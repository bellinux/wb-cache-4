40|$|We {{start by}} {{constructing}} a Hilbert manifold T of orientation preserving diffeomorphisms {{of the circle}} (modulo the group of bi-holomorphic self-mappings of the disc). This space, which could {{be thought of as}} a completion of the universal Teichmueller space, is endowed with a right-invariant Kaehler metric. Using results from the theory of quasiconformal mappings we construct an embedding of T into the infinite dimensional Segal-Wilson Grassmannian. The latter turns out to be a very natural ambient space for T. This allows us to prove that T's sectional curvature is negative in the holomorphic directions and by a reasoning along the lines of Cartan-Hadamard's theory that its geodesics exist for all time. The geodesics of <b>T</b> <b>lead</b> to solutions of the periodic Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation by means of V. Arnold's generalization of Euler's equation.

40|$|The {{presence}} of various agents, including humic materials, nanomaterials, microplastics, or simply specific chemical compounds, may cause {{changes in the}} apparent persistence, bioaccumulation, and/or toxicity (PBT) of a chemical compound leading to an either increased or decreased PBT characteristics and thus an increased or decreased hazard evaluation. In the present paper, a series chloro-containing obsolete pesticides is studied as an illustrative example. Partial order methodology is used to quantify how changed P, B, or T characteristics of methoxychlor (MEC) influences {{the measure of the}} hazard of MEC, relative to the other 11 compounds in the series investigated. Not surprisingly, an increase in one of the three indicators (P, B, or <b>T)</b> <b>lead</b> to an increased average order and thus an increased relative hazard {{as a result of a}} synergistic effect. A decrease in one of the indicator values analogously causes a decreased average order/relative hazard through an antagonistic effect; the effect, however, being less pronounced. It is further seen that the effect of changing the apparent value of the three indicators is different. Thus, persistence apparently is more important that bioaccumulation which again appears more important than toxicity, which is in agreement with previous work. The results are discussed with reference to the European chemicals framework on registration, evaluation and authorization of chemicals (REACH) framework...|$|E

40|$|In the Method of Multiple-Time-Scales (MMTS), the {{introduction}} of independent time scales {{and the elimination of}} secular terms in the fast time variable, T 0 = <b>t,</b> <b>lead</b> to the well-known solvability conditions. Starting from first order, free terms (solutions of the unperturbed equations) emerge in every order in the expansion of the approximate solution. In orders higher than first, the amplitudes of these free terms appear in the solvability conditions. Contrary to the common belief, in the MMTS analysis, these free terms play a role above and beyond the satisfaction of initial conditions: They make feasible mutual consistency among solvability conditions that arise in different orders. In general, this consistency may not be ensured if the free terms are chosen arbitrarily (e. g., set to zero, as is commonly done in many applications). If consistency is not ensured, the analysis may lead to wrong results, or allow only trivial solutions. The solvability conditions constitute a system of PDE's for the dependence of the amplitudes that appear in the expansion on the slow time scales. However, whenever the free amplitudes must be included to ensure a consistent expansion, these PDE's cannot determine the dependence of the solution on slow time variables beyond the first one, T 1 =epsilo*t. The dependence on slower time scales, Tn=epsilon^n*t, n > 1, must be imposed either through initial data at, say, T 1 = 0, or through requirements on the structure of the approximate solution (based, for example, on physical intuition) that are not related to the validity of the perturbative scheme. These claims are illustrated through several simple examples, and then discussed in the general case...|$|E
