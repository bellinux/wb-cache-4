25|$|The {{value of}} a {{resistor}} can be measured with an ohmmeter, which may be one function of a multimeter. Usually, probes {{on the ends of}} <b>test</b> <b>leads</b> connect to the resistor. A simple ohmmeter may apply a voltage from a battery across the unknown resistor (with an internal resistor of a known value in series) producing a current which drives a meter movement. The current, in accordance with Ohm's law, is inversely proportional to the sum of the internal resistance and the resistor being tested, resulting in an analog meter scale which is very non-linear, calibrated from infinity to 0 ohms. A digital multimeter, using active electronics, may instead pass a specified current through the test resistance. The voltage generated across the test resistance in that case is linearly proportional to its resistance, which is measured and displayed. In either case the low-resistance ranges of the meter pass much more current through the <b>test</b> <b>leads</b> than do high-resistance ranges, in order for the voltages present to be at reasonable levels (generally below 10 volts) but still measurable.|$|E
25|$|Open wire <b>test</b> <b>leads</b> (flying leads) {{are likely}} to pick up interference, so they are not {{suitable}} for low level signals. Furthermore, the leads have a high inductance, so they are not suitable for high frequencies. Using a shielded cable (i.e.,coaxial cable) is better for low level signals. Coaxial cable also has lower inductance, but it has higher capacitance: a typical 50ohm cable has about 90pF per meter. Consequently, a one-meter direct (1X) coaxial probe will load a circuit with a capacitance of about 110pF and a resistance of 1megohm.|$|E
25|$|Most {{multimeters}} {{include a}} fuse, or two fuses, which will sometimes prevent {{damage to the}} multimeter from a current overload on the highest current range. (For added safety, <b>test</b> <b>leads</b> with fuses built in are available.) A common error when operating a multimeter is to set the meter to measure resistance or current, and then connect it directly to a low-impedance voltage source. Unfused meters are often quickly destroyed by such errors; fused meters often survive. Fuses used in meters must carry the maximum measuring current of the instrument, but are intended to disconnect if operator error exposes the meter to a low-impedance fault. Meters with inadequate or unsafe fusing were not uncommon; this situation {{has led to the}} creation of the IEC61010 categories to rate the safety and robustness of meters.|$|E

40|$|These {{virulence}} <b>tests</b> <b>lead</b> us {{to believe}} that Micrococcus florens is pathogenic for mice, rabbits, and monkeys (Macacus rhesus), producing septicemia, and that it will also cause purulent meningitis in the two latter animals. The combined results of the biological reactions and of the agglutination <b>tests</b> <b>lead</b> {{us to believe}} that we are dealing with an organism which, though morphologically similar to the meningococcus, yet is entirely distinct. A review of the literature fails to reveal any description of a Gramnegative micrococcus which grows luxuriantly on all media tested, forms no pigment, and ferments arabinose, dextrose, and galactose...|$|R
25|$|His second <b>test</b> <b>leads</b> {{him to a}} vat, at {{the bottom}} of which Judge Halden, who gave Dylan's killer six months in jail, is chained at the neck. Large dead pigs drop into a liquidiser and spray Judge Halden with liquified pig, but Jeff reluctantly sets fire to a cage full of Dylan's toys in order to {{retrieve}} the key (hidden inside one of the many toys) and save Halden. His third test brings him before Timothy Young, Dylan's killer, who is strapped to a machine that will twist his limbs and neck in turn until they break. The key is tied to the trigger of an enclosed shotgun. Jeff eventually tries to free Timothy, but taking the key discharges the shotgun and accidentally kills Halden, and Jeff is unable to stop the machine before Timothy's neck breaks.|$|E
2500|$|Jeff's first <b>test</b> <b>leads</b> {{him into}} a meat freezer. He finds Danica Scott, the only witness of Dylan's death, who refused to testify in court; she is naked and chained at the wrists between two poles which begin {{spraying}} ice-cold water at random intervals. In order to save her, Jeff has to reach through a gap in a wall made of metal poles to reach the key. The key is so far away, {{he would have to}} press and freeze his cheek to the pole, grab the key and then tear a large chunk of his face off the frozen poles in order to save her. Danica manages to convince Jeff to help her, but freezes to death before he can retrieve the key.|$|E
2500|$|Measuring low-value resistors, such as fractional-ohm resistors, with {{acceptable}} accuracy requires four-terminal connections. One pair of terminals applies a known, calibrated {{current to}} the resistor, {{while the other}} pair senses the voltage drop across the resistor. Some laboratory quality ohmmeters, especially milliohmmeters, {{and even some of}} the better digital multimeters sense using four input terminals for this purpose, which may be used with special <b>test</b> <b>leads.</b> Each of the two so-called Kelvin clips has a pair of jaws insulated from each other. [...] One side of each clip applies the measuring current, while the other connections are only to sense the voltage drop. The resistance is again calculated using Ohm's Law as the measured voltage divided by the applied current.|$|E

5000|$|A lineman's handset {{typically}} connects via {{a pair of}} <b>test</b> <b>leads,</b> not the modular connector {{found on}} most consumer telephone equipment. The <b>test</b> <b>leads</b> will feature some combination of alligator clips (to connect to bare wires), a piercing spike or [...] "bed-of-nails" [...] (for insulated wires), and something designed to fit a punch block. Adapters designed to fit other punch block types, heat coil sockets, or modular jacks may also be used.|$|E
50|$|A {{directly}} connected {{test probe}} (so called 1× probe) puts the unwanted lead capacitance across the circuit under test. For a typical coaxial cable, loading {{is of the}} order of 100pF per meter (the length of a typical <b>test</b> <b>lead).</b>|$|R

50|$|Testing {{strategies}} {{should be}} {{reviewed by the}} developers.

25|$|Patients with ESKD are at {{increased}} overall risk for cancer. This risk is particularly high in younger patients and gradually diminishes with age.

2500|$|If {{the signal}} source {{has its own}} coaxial connector, then a simple coaxial cable is used; otherwise, a {{specialized}} cable called a [...] "scope probe", supplied with the oscilloscope, is used.

50|$|When a test access {{crosspoint}} {{itself was}} stuck closed, {{it would cause}} sporadic FCG failures all over both grids that were tested by that controller.
