5|$|The new SuperSpeed mode {{provides}} a {{data signaling rate}} of 5.0Gbit/s. However, due to <b>the</b> <b>overhead</b> incurred by 8b/10b encoding, the payload throughput is actually 4Gbit/s, and the specification considers it reasonable to achieve only around 3.2Gbit/s (0.4GB/s or 400MB/s). However, this should increase with future hardware advances. Communication is full-duplex in SuperSpeed transfer mode; earlier modes are half-duplex, arbitrated by the host.|$|E
5|$|The town of Atherton, {{which lies}} on the tracks, was an early and vocal {{opponent}} of electrification.

40|$|The study investigates <b>the</b> <b>overheads</b> {{reduction}} initiative, leading {{issue of}} public policy in Hungary between 2013 and 2014 {{in the face of}} the punctuated equilibrium theory. The case is examined from the perspective of how the punctuated equilibrium theory and the associated concepts (as policy image, policy monopoly and stream) can be applied to <b>the</b> <b>overheads</b> reduction initiative, a significant change in the public policy. After clarifying the terminology, the study presents that the increase of the expenditure of the domestic energy along with the rising number of those in arrears have already been issued as a real societal problem for years. Nevertheless, the intermittent character and the emergence of the policy image and monopoly can be justified with the priority of political aspects and the aspiration for bigger popularity. The series of provisions of <b>the</b> <b>overheads</b> reduction initiative perfectly match the governmental narrative. Between the discourse of <b>the</b> <b>overheads</b> reduction initiative generated by the government and the punctuated equilibrium provisions and the climax of popularity of Fidesz, a close interrelation can be detected.

5|$|Not all parallelization {{results in}} speed-up.

5|$|The {{increase}} in maximum bandwidth {{is achieved by}} raising the lane speed from 6 Gbit/s to 12 Gbit/s and {{increasing the number of}} AV data lanes from 3 to 4 (i.e. using all 4 lanes to carry data). The data lanes runs in inverted clock mode and embeds the clock signal in itself. This allows the clock lane to be used for data (in addition to the existing three data lanes). The lane data structure has been changed to a packet-based format. The lane encoding is changed from 8b/10b to 16b/18b (reducing <b>the</b> <b>overhead</b> from 20% to 11%).|$|E

5|$|As the {{vandalism}} {{had shut}} down {{service at the}} central hub, a police squad was organized and dispatched to protect repairmen while they fixed <b>the</b> <b>overhead</b> cables at the main terminal building. The repairmen and the police were quickly surrounded by the strikers who hurled bricks and beat them with clubs. The police and repairmen were forced to flee and were prevented from restoring power to the terminal's lines. By the afternoon of November 1, the strikers were able to force a complete shut down of the urban central hub and halt all city streetcar operations. The shut down also stopped most of Indiana's inter-city light rail transportation, but regional routes outside of Indianapolis continued to operate. The shut down caused widespread disruption of public transportation and its effects were immediately felt by the public.|$|E
5|$|During the 1980s, {{the city}} decided {{to connect the}} four {{suburban}} lines west of the city center with the Oslo Metro. The Sognsvann Line {{was selected as the}} first line to be upgraded, so the two systems would become compatible. The line was upgraded to metro standard by replacing <b>the</b> <b>overhead</b> wire with a third-rail power supply and installing automatic train protection. All the stations were rebuilt, with platforms lengthened from fitting two-car to fitting four-car trains, and the platform height increased. The third rail required all level crossings to be removed, resulting in the line being rebuilt several places to allow the road to underpass or overpass. The light rail permitted passengers to cross the lines at the stations, but this was made impossible with metro standard. Because of this, underpasses or overpasses were built at the stations.|$|E

A small railcar with space for 12passengers was also provided. The locomotive and the railcar were each fitted with a single trolley pole to collect electricity from <b>the</b> <b>overhead</b> wire. The passenger car was used for the duration of passenger services on the line, and the locomotive from the electrification of the line until closure in 1959.
