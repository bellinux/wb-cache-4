5|$|Robert was not {{discouraged}} by this naval defeat, and began his siege of Dyrrhachium. In {{command of the}} garrison at Dyrrhachium was the experienced general George Palaiologos, sent by Alexios with orders <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>out</b> at all costs while Alexios himself mustered an army to relieve the city.|$|E
5|$|A {{couple of}} months after the {{beginning}} of the French occupation, the Maltese people rebelled against the French and blockaded them in the Harbour area with British, Neapolitan and Portuguese support. The French managed <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>out</b> in Valletta until September 1800, when General Vaubois capitulated to the British, who took control of the islands.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the intervention, Tshombe lost the support of Kasa-Vubu and Mobutu and was {{dismissed}} from his post as prime minister in October 1965. Soon after Dragon Rouge, ANC and mercenary troops captured Stanleyville putting an end to the Simba rebellion. Pockets of Simba resistance continued <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>out</b> in the eastern Congo, most notably in South Kivu where Laurent-Désiré Kabila led a Maoist cross-border insurgency which lasted until the 1980s.|$|E

6000|$|... "As to Ulf {{and the men}} {{returning}} from the Springs," [...] said Finn, [...] "there is small chance of that before morning. With regard <b>to</b> <b>holding</b> <b>out,</b> I know of nothing that will cause fire to burn slow once it is well kindled. An hour hence and Ulfstede will be in ashes, as that sound surely tells." ...|$|R
5000|$|Dupree’s {{performance}} at the 2001 pageant inspired a tribute to Dupree on the television series Glee, where a character began her dance performance <b>to</b> <b>Holding</b> <b>Out</b> for a Hero by landing {{on the floor in}} a split, an imitation of Dupree's {{performance at}} the 2001 pageant. In its review of the Glee episode, Out magazine referred to Dupree's stage entry as an [...] "epic entrance." ...|$|R
5|$|Ciudad Juárez, {{defended by}} 700 troops, was {{surrounded}} on three sides, {{with the only}} possible exit route for the besieged federales being the northern path into El Paso and the US. Despite {{the fact that the}} revolutionaries had cut off the water supplies into town and the garrison was low on ammunition, its commander, Gen. Juan N. Navarro, refused to surrender, convinced that the inexperience of the rebels in laying sieges would allow him <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E
5|$|Following the war {{council of}} 20 June, Schuyler ordered St. Clair <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>out</b> {{as long as}} he could, and to avoid having his avenues of retreat cut off. Schuyler took command of a reserve force of 700 at Albany, and Washington ordered four regiments to be held in {{readiness}} at Peekskill, further down the Hudson River.|$|E
5|$|He {{also ordered}} the {{destruction}} of any remaining pagan idols in Eastern Arabia. The last city <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>out</b> against the Muslims in Western Arabia was Taif. Muhammad {{refused to accept the}} city's surrender until they agreed to convert to Islam and allowed men to destroy the statue of their goddess Allat.|$|E

5|$|If {{you do not}} {{hurry to}} fight at sea, but keep your ships here and stay near land, or even advance into the Peloponnese, then, my lord, you will easily {{accomplish}} what you had in mind on coming here. The Hellenes are not able <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>out</b> against you for a long time, but you will scatter them, and they will each flee to their own cities.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, a Byzantine fleet {{arrived and}} – after joining with the Venetian fleet – {{attacked}} the Norman fleet, which was again routed. The garrison at Dyrrhachium managed <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>out</b> all summer, despite Robert's catapults, ballistae and siege tower. The garrison made continuous sallies from the city; on one occasion, Palaiologos fought {{all day with}} an arrowhead in his skull. Another sally succeeded in destroying Robert's siege tower.|$|E
5|$|Military {{thinking}} shifted rapidly. Given {{the lack}} of equipment and properly trained men, Ironside had {{had little choice but}} to adopt a strategy of static warfare, but it was soon perceived that this would not be sufficient. Ironside has been criticised for having a siege mentality, but some consider this unfair, as he is believed to have understood the limits of the stop lines and never expected them <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>out</b> indefinitely.|$|E
60|$|But {{even while}} he spoke, Sue--not heeding him--had turned to Squire Boatfield. She went up <b>to</b> him, <b>holding</b> <b>out</b> {{her hands as}} if in instinctive childlike appeal for protection, to a kindly man.|$|R

5|$|Mstislav of Kiev and the Kievan army managed <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>out</b> {{for three}} days, but were {{eventually}} forced {{to surrender to}} Ploscânea. But Ploscânea deceived the Slavs and gave them to Tatars; Ploscânea initially was allied with Slavs and Cumans and {{was the leader of}} Brodnici, people from a territory of today Moldova and Romania. Once in control of the camp, the Mongols slaughtered the Kievan army including Mstislav of Kiev and several other noble prisoners.|$|E
5|$|Nodes were {{designated}} 'A', 'B' or 'C' depending upon {{how long they}} were expected <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>out.</b> Home Guard troops were {{largely responsible for the}} defence of nodal points and other centres of resistance such as towns and defended villages. Category 'A' nodal points and anti-tank islands usually had a garrison of regular troops.|$|E
5|$|The 2nd Battalion of the Royal Norfolks, {{along with}} the 8th Lancashire Fusiliers, were holding the Allied line at the villages of Riez du Vinage, Le Cornet Malo and Le Paradis with the {{battalion}} headquarters based at Le Paradis. The battalions had been ordered <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>out</b> {{for as long as}} possible against the Germans to give time for the BEF to evacuate from Dunkirk.|$|E
60|$|If the {{principle}} of prescription be not a constitution of positive law, but a principle of natural equity, then <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> it <b>out</b> against any man is not doing him injustice.|$|R
5000|$|Burr {{moved to}} Melbourne soon afterward, {{where he was}} {{employed}} as a draughtsman at the Crown Lands Office. He also continued <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> himself <b>out</b> as a civil engineer, {{although there are no}} known assignments.|$|R
50|$|Glasenberg became CEO of the mergered entity {{created when}} Glencore and Xstrata {{finalised}} {{one of the}} largest mining company mergers in history creating a US$88 billion company. Originally Xstrata CEO Mick Davis was to be CEO while Glasenberg would be President in a merger of equals transaction, however due <b>to</b> <b>holding</b> <b>out</b> of major Xstrata shareholder Qatar, it became a takeover target, with a 3.05 Glencore to 1 Xstrata Share exchange to create the new entity Glencore Xstrata with Glasenberg becoming CEO. Davis left the company in July 2013.|$|R
5|$|The unrest {{caused by}} this {{division}} of the Pashtun lands led {{to the rise of}} Saidullah, a Pashtun fakir who led an army of at least 10,000 against the British garrison in Malakand. Although the British forces were divided among a number of poorly defended positions, the small garrison at the camp of Malakand South and the small fort at Chakdara were both able <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>out</b> for six days against the much larger Pashtun army.|$|E
5|$|Bergonzoli {{knew that}} if Bardia and Tobruk held out, a British advance further into Libya {{eventually}} must falter under the logistical difficulties of maintaining a desert force using an extended overland supply line. Not knowing how long he had <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>out,</b> Bergonzoli was forced to ration his stocks {{of food and water}} so that O'Connor could not simply starve him out. Consequently, hunger and thirst adversely affected the morale of the Italian defenders that had already been shaken by the defeat at Sidi Barrani. So too did medical conditions undermine morale, particularly lice and dysentery, the results of poor sanitation.|$|E
5|$|By now, the {{division}} {{was too weak}} to attempt to reach Frost at the bridge. Of the nine infantry battalions, only one (1st Battalion, The Border Regiment) still existed as a unit, the rest were badly mauled or scattered. Urquhart made the difficult decision to form a defensive perimeter around Oosterbeek, abandoning the 2nd Parachute Battalion. By securing the Driel Ferry Crossing, Urquhart hoped <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>out</b> until XXX Corps could reach them and establish a new bridgehead over the Rhine using the ferry crossing platforms.|$|E

5|$|In May 1783, General Matthews {{was accused}} of {{procrastination}} and suspended by the Bombay Government. Thereafter Colonel John Campbell received provisional command of the strategic fort of Mangalore on 5 May 1783. Tipu made several assaults on the Mangalore fort up until January 1784, all of which resulted in failure. Looking at the wounded embattled garrison, Colonel Campbell considered it futile <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>out</b> any longer. He finally delivered the Mangalore fort to Tipu when the British capitulated on 30 January 1784. On 11 March 1784, Tipu and the British East India Company signed the Treaty of Mangalore, thus bringing {{an end to the}} Second Anglo-Mysore War.|$|E
5|$|In October 1962, South Kasai {{returned}} to the Republic of the Congo. The State of Katanga continued <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>out</b> against the central government until it too collapsed in January 1963 after UN forces began {{to take a more}} aggressive stance under Thant. As a compromise, South Kasai was one of the 21 provinces formally established by the federalist constitution of 1962. As the Mobutu regime launched a centralist restructuring of the Congolese state from 1965, South Kasai {{was one of the few}} provinces which was retained. In order to discourage further secessionist sentiment, the province was later restructured to include new territory in Kabinda and Sankuru Districts and renamed Eastern Kasai (Kasaï-Oriental).|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, the {{benefits}} of more defensible forts are evident: they could act as temporary refuges for overwhelmed local troops during barbarian incursions, while they waited for reinforcements. The forts were difficult for the barbarians to take by assault, as they generally lacked the necessary equipment. The forts could store sufficient supplies to enable the defenders <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>out</b> for a few weeks, and to supply relieving troops. They could also act as bases from which defenders could make sorties against isolated groups of barbarians and to cooperate with relieving forces.|$|E

5000|$|Voluntary trades do {{not require}} {{certification}} {{for a person to}} participate in activities constituting that trade.
