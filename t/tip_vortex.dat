25|$|Normally, a wing {{with such}} a low aspect ratio will suffer from very poor {{performance}} due {{to the degree of}} induced drag created at the wingtips, as the higher pressure air below spills around the wingtip to the lower-pressure region above. In a conventional aircraft, these wingtip vortices carry a lot of energy with them and hence create drag. The usual approach to reducing these vortices is to build a wing with a high aspect ratio, i.e. one that is long and narrow. However, such wings compromise the maneuverability and roll rate of the aircraft, or present a structural challenge in building them stiff enough. The XF5U attempted to overcome the <b>tip</b> <b>vortex</b> problem using the propellers to actively cancel the drag-causing tip vortices. The propellers are arranged to rotate in the opposite direction to the tip vortices, with the aim of retaining the higher-pressure air below the wing. With this source of drag eliminated, the aircraft would fly with a much smaller wing area, and the small wing would yield high maneuverability with greater structural strength.|$|E

The thick tip foil was constructed by normal extrusion of the original tip foil. The maximum thickness of the foil increased from 1. 64 % chord length to 7. 64 %. The commercial CFD code CFX was employed to simulate the flow field of the two ducted propellers. From the performance curves, it could be concluded that the tip foil thickening will not affect the thrust and torque of the ducted propeller much.

However, a cavitation surge appeared at higher cavitation numbers.

50|$|Cavitation is the {{formation}} of vapor bubbles in water near a moving propeller blade in regions of low pressure due to Bernoulli's principle. It can occur if an attempt is made to transmit too much power through the screw, or if the propeller is operating {{at a very high}} speed. Cavitation can waste power, create vibration and wear, and cause damage to the propeller. It can occur in many ways on a propeller.

Other devices such as vortilons, leading-edge extensions, leading edge cuffs, also delay flow separation at high angles of attack by re-energizing the boundary layer.|$|E
40|$|The {{primary focus}} {{of this paper is}} to {{investigate}} how a rotor's unsteady tip clearance flow structure changes in a low speed one and half stage axial compressor when the rotor tip gap size is increased from 0. 5 mm (0. 49 % of rotor tip blade chord, 2 % of blade span) to 2. 4 mm (2. 34 % chord, 4 % span) at the design condition are investigated. The changes in unsteady tip clearance flow with the 0. 62 % tip gap as the flow rate is reduced to near stall condition are also investigated. A Large Eddy Simulation (LES) is applied to calculate the unsteady flow field at these three flow conditions. Detailed Stereoscopic PIV (SPIV) measurements of the current flow fields were also performed at the Johns Hopkins University in a refractive index-matched test facility which renders the compressor blades and casing optically transparent. With this setup, the unsteady velocity field in the entire flow domain, including the flow inside the tip gap, can be measured. Unsteady tip clearance flow fields from LES are compared with the PIV measurements and both LES and PIV results are used to study changes in tip clearance flow structures. The current study shows that the <b>tip</b> clearance <b>vortex</b> is not a single structure as traditionally perceived. The <b>tip</b> clearance <b>vortex</b> is formed by multiple interlaced vorticities. Therefore, the <b>tip</b> clearance <b>vortex</b> is inherently unsteady. The multiple interlaced vortices never roll up to form a single structure. When phased-averaged, the <b>tip</b> clearance <b>vortex</b> appears as a single structure. When flow rate is reduced with the same tip gap, the <b>tip</b> clearance <b>vortex</b> rolls further upstream and the <b>tip</b> clearance <b>vortex</b> moves further radially inward and away from the suction side of the blade. When the tip gap size is increased at the design flow condition, the overall <b>tip</b> clearance <b>vortex</b> becomes stronger and it stays closer to the blade suction side and the vortex core extends all the way to the exit of the blade passage. Measured and calculated unsteady flow fields inside the tip gap agree fairly well. Instantaneous velocity vectors inside the tip gap from both the PIV and LES do show flow separation and reattachment at the entrance of tip gap as some earlier studies suggested. This area at the entrance of tip gap flow (the pressure side of the blade) is confined very close to the rotor tip section. With a small tip gap (0. 5 mm), the gap flow looks like a simple two-dimensional channel flow with larger velocity near the casing for both flow rates. A small area with a sharp velocity gradient is observed just above the rotor tip. This strong shear layer is turned radially inward when it collides with the incoming flow and forms the core structure of the <b>tip</b> clearance <b>vortex.</b> When <b>tip</b> gap size is increased to 2. 4 mm at the design operation, the radial profile of the tip gap flow changes drastically. With the large tip gap, the gap flow looks like a two-dimensional channel flow only near the casing. Near the rotor top section, a bigger region with very large shear and reversed flow is observed...|$|R

40|$|AbstractOn {{the base}} of an assumed steady inlet {{circumferential}} total pressure distortion, three-dimensional time-dependent numerical simulations are conducted on an axial flow subsonic compressor rotor. The performances and flow fields of a compressor rotor, either casing treated or untreated, are investigated in detail either with or without inlet pressure distortion. Results show that the circumferential groove casing treatment can expand the operating range of the compressor rotor either with or without inlet pressure distortion {{at the expense of}} a drop in peak isentropic efficiency. The casing treatment is capable of weakening or even removing the <b>tip</b> leakage <b>vortex</b> effectively either with or without inlet distortion. In clean inlet circumstances, the enhancement and forward movement of <b>tip</b> leakage <b>vortex</b> cause the untreated compressor rotor to stall. By contrast, with circumferential groove casing, the serious flow separation on the suction surface leads to aerodynamic stalling eventually. In the presence of inlet pressure distortion, the blade loading changes from passage to passage as the distorted inflow sector is traversed. Similar to the clean inlet circumstances, with a smooth wall casing, the enhancement and forward movement of <b>tip</b> leakage <b>vortex</b> are still the main factors which lead to the compressor rotor stalling eventually. When the rotor works under near stall conditions, the blockage resulting from the <b>tip</b> leakage <b>vortex</b> in all the passages is very serious. Especially in several passages, flow-spillage is observed. Compared to the clean inlet circumstances, circumferential groove casing treatment can also eliminate the low energy zone in the outer end wall region effectively...|$|R

50|$|Wingtip {{devices are}} {{intended}} to improve the efficiency of fixed-wing aircraft. There are several types of wing tip devices, and although they function in different manners, their intended effect is always to reduce the aircraft's drag by partial recovery of the <b>tip</b> <b>vortex</b> energy. Wingtip devices can also improve aircraft handling characteristics and enhance safety for following aircraft. Such devices increase the effective aspect ratio of a wing without materially increasing the wingspan. An extension of span would lower lift-induced drag, but would increase parasitic drag and would require boosting the strength and weight of the wing. At some point, there is no net benefit from further increased span. There may also be operational considerations that limit the allowable wingspan (e.g., available width at airport gates).|$|E

40|$|Detailed {{steady and}} {{unsteady}} numerical studies {{were performed to}} investigate tip clearance flow in an axial water jet pump. The primary objective is to understand physics of unsteady tip clearance flow, unsteady <b>tip</b> leakage <b>vortex,</b> and cavitation inception in an axial water jet pump. Steady pressure field and resulting steady <b>tip</b> leakage <b>vortex</b> from a steady flow analysis {{do not seem to}} explain measured cavitation inception correctly. The measured flow field near the tip is unsteady and measured cavitation inception is highly transient. Flow visualization with cavitation bubbles shows that the leakage vortex is oscillating significantly and many intermittent vortex ropes are present between the suction side of the blade and the <b>tip</b> leakage core <b>vortex.</b> Although the flow field is highly transient, the overall flow structure is stable and a characteristic frequency seems to exist. To capture relevant flow physics as much as possible, a Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) calculation and a Large Eddy Simulation (LES) were applied for the current investigation. The present study reveals that several vortices from the <b>tip</b> leakage <b>vortex</b> system cross the tip gap of the adjacent blade periodically. Sudden changes in local pressure field inside tip gap due to these vortices create vortex ropes.

5000|$|An {{example of}} an {{optimization}} proof of concept was done in 2003 by Leoviriyakit using the Boeing 747-200. [...] Using the variable list above, he optimized for only a single point - a lift coefficient of 0.42 and a speed of Mach 0.87, just above cruising. With just those few variables, {{he was able to}} realize a 12% decrease in drag and a 0.1% decrease in wing weight. The code that was run produced a longer span but less sweep-back than the original wing planform. While the reduction in sweep-back actually increases drag it also increases lift allowing a lower AoA and the extended wing span decreases the induced drag (wing <b>tip</b> <b>vortex)</b> resulting in a net reduction of drag. Unfortunately, his optimized design uses too simple of a model; he realized that had more variables, such as viscous effects, been taken into consideration, the resulting model would have been far different. The other major limitation of the single point approach is that it only optimizes the wing for one speed and lift condition. While the drag may have been reduced at cruising speed, it might have been drastically increased for take-off and landing, resulting in a net fuel loss for the airline.|$|E

40|$|Effects {{of a large}} rotor tip gap on the {{performance}} of a one and half stage axial compressor are investigated in detail with a numerical simulation based on LES and available PIV data. The current paper studies the main flow physics, including why and how the loss generation is increased with the large rotor tip gap. The present study reveals that when the tip gap becomes large, tip clearance fluid goes over the <b>tip</b> clearance core <b>vortex</b> and enters into the next blade's tip gap, which is called double-leakage tip clearance flow. As the tip clearance flow enters into the adjacent blade's <b>tip</b> gap, a <b>vortex</b> rope with a lower pressure core is generated. This vortex rope breaks up the <b>tip</b> clearance core <b>vortex</b> of the adjacent blade, resulting in a large additional mixing. This double-leakage tip clearance flow occurs at all operating conditions, from design flow to near stall condition, with the large tip gap for the current compressor stage. The double-leakage tip clearance flow, its interaction with the <b>tip</b> clearance core <b>vortex</b> of the adjacent blade, and the resulting large mixing loss are the main flow mechanism of the large rotor tip gap in the compressor. When the tip clearance is smaller, flow near the end wall follows more closely with the main passage flow and this double-leakage tip clearance flow does not happen near the design flow condition for the current compressor stage. When the compressor with a large tip gap operates at near stall operation, a strong vortex rope is generated near the leading edge due to the double-leakage flow. Part of this vortex separates from the path of the <b>tip</b> clearance core <b>vortex</b> and travels from the suction side of the blade toward the pressure side of the blade. This vortex is generated periodically at near stall operation with a large tip gap. As the vortex travels from the suction side to the pressure side of the blade, a large fluctuation of local pressure forces blade vibration. Nonsynchronous blade vibration occurs due to this vortex as the frequency of this vortex generation {{is not the same as}} the rotor. The present investigation confirms that this vortex is a part of separated <b>tip</b> clearance <b>vortex,</b> which is caused by the double-leakage tip clearance flow...|$|R

At the tip leakage flow field in the rotor passage, the <b>tip</b> leakage <b>vortex</b> interacts with the shock wave formed upstream of {{the leading edge of}} rotor blade. This interaction has a great influence on the loss at the tip flow region. In addition, the simulation shows that the vortex break-down occurs in the <b>tip</b> leakage <b>vortex</b> at near-stall condition due to this interaction, generating a large blockage effect near the tip in the rotor passage enough to trigger the stall of compressor.

40|$|An optical {{measurement}} technique known as Three-Dimensional Digital Particle Image Velocimetry (3 -D DPIV) {{was used to}} characterize the tip clearance flow in NASA Glenn Research Center's low-speed axial compressor. 3 -D DPIV is a technique in which a stereoscopic imaging system consisting of two cross-correlation cameras is used to record particles entrained in a flow as a laser light sheet is pulsed at two instances in time. Although 3 -D DPIV has been used elsewhere, {{this is the first}} time it has been used to measure compressor tip clearance flows. In-house modifications of the DPIV system include the use of effective seeding technology and a novel system to perform a priori calibrations at all five measurement planes, greatly reducing facility run time. Computational fluid dynamics predictions, which are used to guide design changes toward improving the efficiency and operating range of turbomachinery, can be verified and improved by comparison with 3 -D DPIV measurements of the actual tip clearance flow. This measurement campaign dealt with the characterization of the <b>tip</b> clearance <b>vortex</b> in the first stage of a four-stage axial compressor. The <b>tip</b> clearance <b>vortex</b> is formed in compressors operating with a clearance gap between the moving rotor blade tips and the stationary casing when a leakage flow, forced from the pressure side of the blade over the blade tip, forms a vortical structure on the suction side of the blade. 3 -D DPIV is ideally suited to measure the clearance vortex for two reasons: (1) this technique captures the entire blade passage flow at one instant in time, so that wandering of the vortex during the measurement does not smear out velocity gradients in the flow field, and (2) the spanwise component of velocity changes sign across the vortex core, providing a more accurate measurement of the vortex location than was available with previous two-dimensional measurement approaches. These two attributes of the data will enable computational fluid dynamics researchers to validate their predictions to a level of accuracy not previously attainable. In an effort to understand the effects of this flow phenomenon on the operation of the low speed axial compressor, data were acquired at two mass flow coefficients: 0. 395 (design operating point) and 0. 35 (operating point just above stall). In order to identify the spatial extent, location, and magnitude of the <b>tip</b> clearance <b>vortex</b> for each mass flow condition, data were acquired at five equally spaced spanwise locations, from 90 - to 100 -percent span.
