40|$|International audienceXanthone, thioxanthone, fluorenone, benzophenone, 2 -benzoylpyridine, dibenzofuran, and {{dibenzothiophene}} were deprotonated using a base {{prepared in}} situ from MCl 2 TMEDA (M = Zn or Cd; TMEDA =N,N,N,N-tetramethylethylenediamine) and lithium 2, 2, 6, 6 -tetramethylpiperidide in a 1 : 3 ratio, {{as demonstrated by}} subsequent iodolysis. The different aryl halides were involved as partners in the N-arylation of pyrrolidin- 2 -one. In the presence of copper(I) iodide and <b>tripotassium</b> <b>phosphate,</b> and using dimethyl sulfoxide as solvent, the reactions could be performed in yields ranging from 40 to 70 %. Most of the products were tested for their antimicrobial, antifungal, antioxidant, and cytotoxic (MCF- 7) activity...|$|E
40|$|Recovery {{of carbon}} fibers by {{recycling}} thermoset epoxy-matrix composites is highly desirable from {{both economic and}} environmental perspectives. This reduces waste disposal of scrap from production parts and end-of-life products. In this research, benzyl alcohol and water in subcritical and supercritical conditions, with and without addition of <b>tripotassium</b> <b>phosphate</b> (K 3 PO 4) as a decomposition reaction catalyst, were used to recover carbon fibers from composite materials for potential reuse in high performance components; while, in the literature review, the composite materials and their manufacturing processes were revisited, {{as well as the}} legal implications of end-of-life composite components, justifying the need for a thermoset composite materials recycling research project. In the experimental section of this research, the reaction temperature and time duration were the experimental parameters. The methods were evaluated by measurement of the decomposition rate of epoxy resin, which reached up to 89. 1 % and 93. 7 % with supercritical water and subcritical benzyl alcohol, respectively. The samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). SEM analysis showed complete separation of the composites as indicated by the clean recovered carbon fibers...|$|E
40|$|For the prodn. of {{siloxane}} fluids, {{the viability}} of using a multi-channel monolith as a catalyst support system in a three-phase reactor has been studied. The catalyst was <b>tripotassium</b> <b>phosphate</b> (K 3 PO 4). Expts. were performed in a single-channel flow reactor (15 mm i. d. and 500 mm catalyst coated length). The rate of reaction was followed by monitoring {{the disappearance of the}} hydroxyl group (-OH). Reaction expts. were performed at a hydroxyl group concn. range from 150 to 170 mol m- 3, T= 373 - 413 K and P= 7. 9 kPa with a nitrogen purge. The max. temp. of operation was restricted to 413 K to avoid the formation of undesirable byproducts. In the regime controlled by chem. kinetics, reaction was of an apparent first order with respect to -OH concn., and in the apparent rate const., the pre-exponential factor was 4. 19 * 10 - 4 m s- 1, and the apparent activation energy was 16. 1 kJ mol- 1. These are only valid for the operating pressure and purge gas flowrate used, as both of these are shown to affect water removal from the liq. phase and, hence, reaction rates. Mass transfer coeffs. from the liq. to the catalyst surface were estd. and these increased rapidly with flowrate and were higher than expected for a falling liq. film...|$|E
