5|$|Sahil and Jai {{drive to}} Mahabaleshwar overnight, and upon arrival decide {{to visit the}} local market. Jai is amazed by Sahil's skill as a guitarist and {{suggests}} that he pursue {{a career as a}} fulltime musician. Later, he gifts him a guitar during lunch. The two engage in several arguments and bicker about their plans throughout the trip, while enjoying each other's company nonetheless. Sahil is irked by Jai's indifferent behaviour and finds it annoying that he works even during the trip. Jai too is not pleased with Sahil's continuous badgering. One night, the two get into a heated argument over their differences. Later, Jai embraces Sahil in his bed and tries to kiss him. The latter resists, and asks Jai to go to sleep as <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> up early the next morning.|$|E
5|$|After {{several members}} of the {{resistance}} are killed by the Gestapo, Winther suspects they have an informant among them. Later, Bent visits Ketty's hotel room, and they have sex. Meanwhile, Jørgen visits his wife and advises her boyfriend to treat her properly or he will return. In a meeting, Winther says the informer is Ketty and orders her death. Bent meets Ketty; she tells him she works for both Winther and army intelligence, and that Winther does not work for the British. Winther, involved with Gilbert and Seibold, had ordered them to be killed in order not {{to be seen as a}} traitor. Bent and Jørgen search for Winther in the bar and discover that he has escaped to Stockholm. They realize it is a trap, and they escape from the Gestapo men. They decide to kill Karl Heinz Hoffmann, the Gestapo's leader, and then take over the favorite Gestapo restaurant. Bent cannot kill Hoffmann because <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> away when he notices the police coming. That night, Ketty says to Bent that he and Jørgen should go to Stockholm. In the meeting, they are offered positions in the Danish Army but they refuse. A man called Ravnen gives them the name of the real informer, and Jørgen soon kills him.|$|E
25|$|White America killed Dr. King last night. She {{made it a}} {{whole lot}} easier for a whole lot of black people today. There no longer needs to be {{intellectual}} discussions, black people know that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> guns. White America will live to cry that she killed Dr. King last night. It would have been better if she had killed Rap Brown and/or Stokely Carmichael, but when she killed Dr. King, she lost.|$|E

25|$|When {{the game}} begins, Matt meets a person whom he doesn't know, {{and she tells}} him that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> to the bridge at a certain time. Later in the game, Matt goes through {{different}} cars because of the person that he doesn't know gets them for him (except for a few cars in The Run.) Matt asks her about her identity but she doesn't respond to his question. However, there is a conflict {{when they get to}} a certain area. There, Matt finds out that the unknown person was using him to get to that area.|$|E
2500|$|In December 2003, the New York Times {{published}} {{a letter from}} the Anti-Defamation League citing Blocher, who had been convicted for anti-Semitic libel by a Zürich court in 1999, for making anti-Semitic remarks in relation to claims for restitution of Nazi-seized assets that were hidden in Swiss banks. Blocher declared that Jews [...] "were only interested in money." [...] The letter also reported that in 1997, Blocher had stated the following that had resulted in his 1999 conviction: [...] "They (the Jews) could blackmail banks, you can blackmail governments, you can blackmail national banks, you can force them to give in. [...] (But) I would like {{to see if they can}} blackmail an entire people at the ballot box. [...] <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> through the eye of this needle, and I will do my utmost that we do not yield." ...|$|E
2500|$|In September 2004, a Christmas storyline {{created by}} Berridge {{that was to}} show Zoe fall {{pregnant}} with Dennis Rickman's (Nigel Harman) baby was axed by Berridge's successor, Kathleen Hutchison. Instead, Zoe was to be seduced by Dennis's father, Den (Leslie Grantham). An EastEnders insider revealed: [...] "Dirty Den lives up to his name by seducing Zoe. He makes his move when she comments how handsome he looks for his age. But they {{are caught in the}} act by Dennis who is shocked and disgusted to see his dad snogging his girlfriend." [...] Hutchison decided that Den would be killed off in a storyline involving three people plotting to kill him. The storyline saw Zoe, Chrissie and Sam plot his death, and a source said, [...] "The three girls team up after deciding <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> rid of Den but viewers will be left wondering who the actual killer is. They plot and scheme to give themselves alibis and exact their revenge for what Den has done to them." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{response}} {{a debate}} over banning gay and lesbian marriage occurred in the Minnesota Legislature. On the House floor Lindner claimed that allowing same-sex marriage would {{open the door to}} [...] "a man marrying a child or a man marrying a dog." [...] Openly gay State Rep. Karen Clark (whose partner, parents, and her partner's parents were attending the debate) expressed dismay at the comment. Lindner told her “I don't know why you felt that was insulting. I was trying to make a point, that we've got a norm of one man, one woman. Once we begin to deviate...what's to keep us from having to pass laws to allow a man to marry several women, or a man and a boy relationship -- and there [...] are people who would like to have that. When we start changing that definition of marriage, that does open up the door to others who will say 'Why not us?'” He told Clark that while he saw her as “one of God’s creations. ...I personally don't think the lifestyle you've chosen and other homosexuals have chosen is really good [...] for you, your partner or society. ...I'm talking in general, the HIV/AIDS problem, other diseases. It probably affects more homosexual men. ...I don't know of any [...] couple, where they've been faithful to each other, a man and a woman, has any fear of any sexually transmitted disease unless <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a blood transfusion. ...you're living in sin." [...] He also stated [...] "I don't believe adoption of children by homosexual couples is [...] {{in the best interests of}} children." [...] (In 1997 Minnesota enacted the Marriage Protection Act defining marriage as a [...] "civil contract between a man and a woman" [...] and stating that [...] "Lawful marriage may be contracted only between persons of the opposite sex".) ...|$|E

60|$|I {{turned on}} him angrily, for I dislike these {{unpleasant}} suggestions. If people have such ideas, they ought in common decency to keep them to themselves. I detest individuals who make {{on the subject of}} their disagreeable presentiments, or who, when they dream that they saw one hanged as a common felon, or some such horror, will insist upon telling one all about it at breakfast, even if <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> up early to do it.|$|E

6000|$|I {{called on}} the two German ships now in port, and we are quite {{friendly}} with them, and intensely friendly of course with our own Curaçoas. But it is other guess work on the beach. Some one has employed, or subsidised, {{one of the local}} editors to attack me once a week. He is pretty scurrilous and pretty false. The first effect of the perusal of the weekly Beast is to make me angry; the second is a kind of deep, golden content and glory, when I seem to say to people: [...] "See! this is my position--I am a plain man dwelling in the bush in a house, and behold <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> up this kind of truck against me--and I have so much influence that they are obliged to write a weekly article to say I have none." ...|$|E

[...] And {{raising her}} eyes for one more of those half-bewildered looks, she moved away along the Embankment wall. When {{she was out of}} sight, Noel walked back to the station. The train was in, and she took her seat. She had three fellow passengers, all in khaki; very silent and moody, as men are when <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> up early. One was tall, dark, and perhaps thirty-five; the second small, and about fifty, with cropped, scanty grey hair; the third was of medium height and quite sixty-five, with a long row of little {{coloured}} patches on his tunic, and a bald, narrow, well-shaped head, grey hair brushed back at the sides, and the thin, collected features and drooping moustache of the old school. It was at him that Noel looked. When he glanced out of the window, or otherwise retired within himself, she liked his face; but when he turned to the ticket-collector or spoke to the others, she did not like it half so much. It was as if the old fellow had two selves, one of which he used when alone, the other in which he dressed every morning to meet the world. They had begun to talk about some Tribunal on which they had to sit. Noel did not listen, but a word or two carried to her now and then.|$|E

6000|$|... 'August 1st.--Yesterday {{afternoon}} we three {{were in our}} private geological treasury, Leonard making a spread-eagle of himself in an impossible place on the cliff side, trying to disinter what hope, springing eternal in the human breast, pronounced to be the paddle of a saurian; Aubrey, climbing as high as he durst, directing operations and making discoveries; I, upon a ledge half-way up, guarding Mab and poking in the debris, {{when one of the}} bridal pairs, with whom the place is infested, was seen questing about as if disposed to invade our premises. Aubrey, reconnoitring in high dudgeon, sarcastically observed that all red-haired men are so much alike, that he should have said yonder was Hec--. The rest ended in a view halloo from above and below, and three bounds to the beach, whereon I levelled my glass, and perceived that in very deed it was Mr. and Mrs. Ernescliffe who were hopping over the shingle. Descending, I was swung off the last rock in a huge embrace, and Hector's fiery moustache was scrubbing both my cheeks before my feet touched the ground, and Blanche with both arms round my waist. They were ready to devour us alive in their famine for a Stoneborough face; and as Flora and Mary are keeping home uninhabitable, found themselves obliged to rush away from Maplewood {{in the middle of their}} county welcomes for a little snatch of us, and to join us in vituperating the new furniture. If Mary could only hear Hector talk of a new sofa that he can't put his boots upon--he says it is bad enough at Maplewood, but that he did hope to be still comfortable at home. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> back to dine out to-morrow, but meantime the fun is more fast and furious than ever, and as soon as the tide serves, we are to fulfil our long-cherished desire of boating round to Lyme. I won't answer for the quantity of discretion added to our freight, but at least there is six feet more of valour, and Mrs. Blanche for my chaperon. Bonnie Blanche is little changed by her four months' matrimony, and only looks prettier and more stylish, but she is painfully meek and younger-sisterish, asking my leave instead of her husband's, and distressed at her smartness in her pretty shady hat and undyed silk, because I was in trim for lias-grubbing. Her appearance ought to be an example to all the brides in the place with skirts in the water, and nothing on to keep off eyes, sun, or wind from their faces. I give Flora infinite credit for it. Blanche and Aubrey walk arm in arm in unceasing talk, and that good fellow, Hector, has included Leonard in the general fraternity. They are highly complimentary, saying they should have taken Aubrey for Harry, he is so much stouter and rosier, and that Leonard is hugely grown. Here come these three boys shouting that the boat is ready; I really think Hector is more boyish and noisy than ever.|$|E
