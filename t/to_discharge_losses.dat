It is noted that the maximum electron emission of a hollow cathode with Ar can be increased 60 - 70 % by using an enclosed keeper configuration. Operation with Ar but without emissive oxide has also been attained. A 30 -cm thruster operated with Ar at moderate discharge voltages is found to give double-ion measurements consistent with a double-ion correlation developed earlier {{on the basis of}} 15 -cm thruster data. An attempt is made <b>to</b> reduce <b>discharge</b> <b>losses</b> by biasing anodes positive of the discharge plasma. The performance of a single-grid ion-optics configuration is assessed.

40|$|A {{preliminary}} thermal {{characterization of}} a newly-fabricated NSTAR-derived test-bed thruster {{has recently been}} performed. The temperature behavior of the rare-earth magnets are reported because of their critical impact on thruster operation. The results obtained to date showed that the magnet temperatures did not exceed the stabilization Emit during thruster operation up to 4. 6 kW. Magnet temperature data were also obtained for two earlier NSTAR Engineering Model Thrusters and are discussed in this report. Comparison between these thrusters suggests that the test-bed engine in its present condition is able to operate safely at higher power because of the lower <b>discharge</b> <b>losses</b> over the entire operating power range of this engine. However, because of the 'burn-in' behavior of the NSTAR thruster, magnet temperatures are expected <b>to</b> increase as <b>discharge</b> <b>losses</b> increase with accumulated thruster operation. Consequently, a new engineering solution {{may be required to}} achieve 5 -kW operation with acceptable margin...|$|R

40|$|Extensive ice {{thickness}} surveys by NASA’s Operation IceBridge enable over {{a decade}} of ice discharge measurements at high precision {{for the majority of}} Greenland’s marine-terminating outlet glaciers, prompting a reassessment of the temporal and spatial distribution of glacier change. Annualmeasurements for 178 outlet glaciers reveal that, despite widespread acceleration, only 15 glaciers accounted for 77 % of the 739 ± 29 Gt of ice lost due to acceleration since 2000 and four accounted for ~ 50 %. Among the top sources of loss are several glaciers that have received little scientific attention. The relative contribution of ice <b>discharge</b> <b>to</b> total <b>loss</b> decreased from 58 % before 2005 to 32 % between 2009 and 2012.

40|$|The {{development}} of a low field strength multipole thruster operating on both argon and xenon is described. Experimental results were obtained with a 15 -cm diameter multipole thruster and are presented {{for a wide range}} of discharge-chamber configurations. Minimum <b>discharge</b> <b>losses</b> were 300 - 350 eV/ion for argon and 200 - 250 eV/ion for xenon. Ion beam flatness parameters in the plane of the accelerator grid ranged from 0. 85 to 0. 93 for both propellants. Thruster performance is correlated for a range of ion chamber sizes and operating conditions as well as propellant type and accelerator system open area. A 30 -cm diameter ion source designed and built using the procedure and theory presented here-in is shown capable of low <b>discharge</b> <b>losses</b> and flat ion-beam profiles without optimization. This indicates that by using the low field strength multipole design, as well as general performance correlation information provided herein, it should be possible to rapidly translate initial performance specifications into easily fabricated, high performance prototypes...|$|R
40|$|Improved {{accelerator}} {{and screen}} grids for an ion accelerator {{have been designed}} and tested in a continuing effort to increase the sustainable power and thrust {{at the high end}} of the accelerator throttling range. The accelerator and screen grids are undergoing development for intended use as NASA s Evolutionary Xenon Thruster (NEXT) a spacecraft thruster that would have an input-power throttling range of 1. 2 to 6. 9 kW. The improved accelerator and screen grids could also be incorporated into ion accelerators used in such industrial processes as ion implantation and ion milling. NEXT is a successor to the NASA Solar Electric Propulsion Technology Application Readiness (NSTAR) thruster - a state-of-the-art ion thruster characterized by, among other things, a beam-extraction diameter of 28 cm, a span-to-gap ratio (defined as this diameter divided by the distance between the grids) of about 430, and a rated peak input power of 2. 3 kW. To enable the NEXT thruster to operate at the required higher peak power, the beam-extraction diameter was increased to 40 cm almost doubling the beam-extraction area over that of NSTAR (see figure). The span-to-gap ratio was increased to 600 to enable throttling to the low end of the required input-power range. The geometry of the apertures in the grids was selected on the basis of experience in the use of grids of similar geometry in the NSTAR thruster. Characteristics of the aperture geometry include a high open-area fraction in the screen grid <b>to</b> reduce <b>discharge</b> <b>losses</b> and a low open-area fraction in the accelerator grid to reduce losses of electrically neutral gas atoms or molecules. The NEXT accelerator grid was made thicker than that of the NSTAR to make more material available for erosion, thereby increasing the service life and, hence, the total impulse. The NEXT grids are made of molybdenum, which was chosen because its combination of high strength and low thermal expansion helps to minimize thermally and inertially induced deflections of the grids. A secondary reason for choosing molybdenum is the availability of a large database for this material. To keep development costs low, the NEXT grids have been fabricated by the same techniques used to fabricate the NSTAR grids. In tests, the NEXT ion optics have been found to outperform the NSTAR ion optics, as expected...|$|R
40|$|The Nuclear-Electric Xenon Ion System (NEXIS) {{thruster}} {{was designed}} to produce {{greater than or equal}} to 70 % efficiency at ISPs in excess of 6500 sec and total power levels in excess of 15 kW. In order to achieve this performance, the thruster requires a large area plasma generator capable of high propellant utilimtion efficiency and low <b>discharge</b> <b>loss</b> while producing a very flat, uniform beam profile. Fortunately, larger thrusters can be made more uniform and efficient due to the higher volume to surface ratio, provided that the magnetic cusp confinement is designed properly and the thruster length to diameter ratio is adequate. This paper describes the discharge chamber performance of the NEXIS Laboratory Model (LM) thruster. The LM discharge chamber is 65 cm in diameter at the grid plane and uses 6 ring-cusps to provide magnetic confinement of the plasma. The thruster was tested with flat carbon-carbon composite grids with the hole pattern masked to 57 cm in diameter and a conventional Type-B " 1 / 2 " diameter hollow cathode. During the preliminary "discharge only" tests, the LM thruster demonstrated profile factors of 0. 84 and a <b>discharge</b> <b>loss</b> of about 160 eV/ion at 25 V discharge voltage and over 90 % propellant utilization efficiency in simulated beam extraction experiments at 3. 9 A of beam current. Analysis of the data from these tests used the discharge-only model developed by Brophy. Subsequent beam extraction experiments validated the key variables used in the model to predict the performance from the discharge-only data, and demonstrated 3. 9 A of beam current at over 90 % propellant utilization efficiency with a flatness parameter of better than 0. 8 and a <b>discharge</b> <b>loss</b> of about 185 eV/ion. The slightly higher <b>discharge</b> <b>loss</b> measured during beam extractions was found to be due to a lower screen transparency in the as-manufactured LM grid set. Plasma measurements with a scanning probe internal to the thruster near the screen grid showed plasma densities over l x 10 (exp 11) per cubic centimeter and electron temperatures of 3. 5 to 5. 5 eV depending on the operation parameters. The performance of the NEXIS <b>discharge</b> chamber contributed <b>to</b> the over 78 % thruster efficiency measured during beam extraction at 7500 sec ISP and 25 kW of power, and over 81 % thruster efficiency measured at 8500 sec ISP...|$|R
40|$|A {{particle}} {{and energy}} balance {{model of the}} plasma discharge in magnetic ring-cusp ion thrusters has been developed. The model follows the original work of Brophy {{in the development of}} global 0 -D discharge models that utilize conservation of particles {{into and out of the}} thruster and conservation of energy into the discharge and out of the plasma in the form of charged particles to the walls and beam and plasma radiation. The present model is significantly expanded over Brophy’s original work by including self-consistent calculations of the internal neutral pressure, electron temperature, primary electron density, electrostatic ion confinement (due to the ring-cusp fields), plasma potential, discharge stability, and time dependent behavior during recycling. The model only requires information on the thruster geometry, ion optics performance and electrical inputs such as discharge voltage and currents, etc. to produce accurate performance curves of <b>discharge</b> <b>loss</b> versus mass utilization efficiency. The model has been benchmarked against the NEXIS Laboratory Model (LM) and Development Model (DM) thrusters, and successfully predicts the thruster <b>discharge</b> <b>loss</b> as a function of mass utilization efficiency for a variety of thrusters.

40|$|BackgroundManagement of {{limb and}} other malperfusion syndromes is {{controversial}} in acute type A aortic dissection. We assessed our hypothesis that urgent proximal aortic repair resolves most cases of limb ischemia without additional peripheral revascularization. MethodsWe retrospectively reviewed operative cases of acute type A aortic dissection from 1999 to 2011. Our standard technique involved urgent {{replacement of the}} ascending aorta and hemiarch. Persistent limb ischemia after aortic repair was treated by bypass surgery. Comparisons between groups both with and without limb ischemia were made. ResultsWe repaired 335 cases during the study period. Sixty-one patients had limb ischemia (18. 2 %), of whom 51 were classified with lower limb ischemia (15. 2 %). All patients with upper limb ischemia survived <b>to</b> <b>discharge</b> without limb <b>loss</b> or death. Only 11 of the 51 patients with lower limb ischemia (21. 6 %) required peripheral revascularization after aortic repair. There was one case of lower limb loss resulting from delayed recognition of persistent ischemia. Renal dysfunction occurred in 21 % of patients with isolated lower limb ischemia and in 31 % of patients with uncomplicated dissection (P =. 29). In-hospital mortality was 13. 7 % overall and 8. 0 % in patients with isolated lower limb ischemia (P =. 89). There {{was no difference in}} long-term survival between isolated limb ischemia and uncomplicated cases (P = . 54). ConclusionsMost cases of limb ischemia resolve after immediate repair of acute type A aortic dissection. There is no difference in renal dysfunction or in-hospital or long-term mortality between patients with isolated limb ischemia and those with nonmalperfusion dissection. If ischemia persists, limb salvage is successful if revascularization is expeditious...|$|R
