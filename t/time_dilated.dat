50|$|Following Thomas Young’s ideas, {{light was}} {{regarded}} in the 19th century {{to move as}} vibrations (undulations) in a substance called the Luminiferous aether, contrary to Newton’s ideas that light itself was made of substantive corpuscles. Exploring {{the nature of this}} aether, Albert Michelson published in 1881 his laboratory experiments where he had light travel {{in the direction of the}} earth’s motion and perpendicular to it. Thus measured on the moving earth, he found no difference in the speed of light traveling with the earth or perpendicular to it. It would have fully conformed to rules prevailing in a Galilean invariance system of coordinates, also called Newtonian inertial system, which apply to moving material particles. In the 1887 paper, written with Edward Morley, Michelson amended the route of the perpendicular light from ab1 to ab: “It may be mentioned here that the error was pointed out to the author of the former paper by M.A. Potier, of Paris, in the winter of 1881.” When the instrument on the moving earth is observed from a stationary point outside earth, the mirror at b1 already moved to b while light was traveling there from a. “This meant that Michelson had overestimated by a factor of two the fringe shifts originally expected.” The mirror at c also moved forward at the same time, but this was not taken into account. It thus seemed that light traveled different distances at the same time, which led George FitzGerald and Hendrik Lorentz (Lorentz ether theory) to postulate that distances shortened and <b>time</b> <b>dilated</b> in direction of motion (FitzGerald-Lorentz contraction).|$|E

A natural question that arises upon consideration of this is, "do devices exist that will experience the relativity in these systems?" We describe a thought experiment in which 'acoustic observers' possess devices called sound clocks {{that can be}} connected to form chains. Careful investigation shows that appropriately constructed chains of stationary and moving sound clocks are perceived by observers on the other chain as undergoing the relativistic phenomena of length contraction and time dilation by the Lorentz factor, with c the speed of sound. Sound clocks within moving chains actually tick less frequently than stationary ones and must be separated by a shorter distance than when stationary to satisfy simultaneity conditions. Stationary sound clocks appear to be length contracted and <b>time</b> <b>dilated</b> to moving observers due to their misunderstanding of their own state of motion {{with respect to the}} laboratory.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the design, implementation, and verification of the Active Cache Emulator (ACE), a novel FPGA-based emulator that models an L 3 cache actively and in real-time. ACE leverages interactions with its host system {{to model the}} target system (i. e. hypothetical system under study). Unlike most existing FPGA-based cache emulators that collect only memory traces from their host system, ACE provides feedback to its host by modeling {{the impact of the}} emulated cache on the system. Specifically, delays are injected to <b>time</b> <b>dilate</b> the host system which then experiences hit/miss latencies of the emulated cache. Such active emulation expands the context of performance measurements by capturing processor performance metrics (e. g. cycle per instruction) in addition to measuring the typical cachespecific performance metrics (e. g. miss ratio). ACE is designed to interface with a front-side bus (FSB) of a typical Pentium ®-based PC system. To actively emulate cache latencies, ACE utilizes the snoop stall mechanism of the FSB to inject delays to the system. At present, ACE is implemented using a Xilinx XC 2 V 6000 FPGA running at 66 MHz, the same speed as its host’s FSB. Verification of ACE includes using the Cache Calibrator and RightMark Memory Analyzer software to confirm proper detection of the emulated cache by the host system, and comparing ACE results with SimpleScalar software simulations...|$|R

Let a positive charge, q, of mass mo (<< Mo) be placed distance y ′ from Q in S ′ and experience the influence of a Coulomb force, F ′ = kQqj/y ′ 2. The amounts of charge are chosen such that their repulsion just balances their gravitational attraction F ′ = −GM 0 m 0 j ′ /y ′ 2. Having set up this nice balance, you depart along the −x ′-axis at speed −v. Obviously, the masses will remain balanced from your new perspective in system S. But in your now moving frame it appears that both electric and magnetic forces act on q such that a magnetic field B = v × E/c 2 is created by the motion of Q relative to you, where E = γkQj/y ′ 2 is the (foreshortened) electric field at q, due to Q. Here γ = 1 / √ 1 − v 2 /c 2. The sum of electric and magnetic forces as calculated in S is F = q(E + u × B), where u is the velocity of q relative to S and, in this case u = v. This leads to combined electric and magnetic forces of F = γkQqj y 2 (1 − v 2 /c 2) (1) Clearly this is a weaker force than that observed in the original system S ′ and if gravity were not present it would lead to a slower separation of Q and q as they repelled each other.

The assumption that the physical world exists {{in and of itself}} has struggled to assimilate the findings of modern physics for some time now. For example, an objective space and time would just "be", but in relativity, space contracts and <b>time</b> <b>dilates.</b> Likewise objective "things" should just inherently exist, but the entities of quantum theory are probability of existence smears, that spread, tunnel, superpose and entangle in physically impossible ways. Cosmology even tells us that our entire physical universe just "popped up", from nowhere, about 14 billion years ago. This is not how an objectively real world should behave! Yet traditional alternatives don't work much better. That the world is just an illusion of the mind doesn't explain its consistent realism and Descartes dualism, that another reality beyond the physical exists, just doubles the existential problem. It is time to consider an option we might normally dismiss out of hand. This essay explores the virtual reality conjecture, that the physical world is the digital output of non-physical quantum processing. It finds it neither illogical, nor unscientific, nor incompatible with current physics. In this model, quantum entities are programs, movement is the transfer of processing, interactions are processing overloads and the fields of physics are network properties. It has no empty space, no singularities and all the conservations of physics just conserve processing. Its prediction, that the collision of high frequency light in a vacuum can create permanent matter, will test it. If the physical world has the properties of a processing output, physics must rewrite the story behind its equations.

The Global Positioning System (GPS) uses accurate, stable atomic clocks in satellites and on the ground to provide world-wide position and time determination. As a result of their motion and being in the earth gravitational field, these clocks are subject to one of the relativity effects known as time dilation and without carefully accounting for this effect, the system would not work. This research work discussed the concept and effect of special and general relativity on GPS navigation as well as using Karl Schwarzschild time dilation equation to estimate time error. Signals exchanged by atomic clocks at different altitudes are subject to general relativistic effects described using the Schwarzschild metric and neglecting these effects would make the GPS errorfull.
