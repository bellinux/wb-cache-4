50|$|In 1952 {{the pickup}} {{selection}} circuit was modified by Fender to incorporate a real <b>tone</b> <b>control.</b> Between 1953 and 1967 the neck could be selected {{alone with a}} pre-set bassy sound and no <b>tone</b> <b>control,</b> in the middle switch the neck could be selected alone with the <b>tone</b> <b>control</b> and finally the bridge could be selected with the <b>tone</b> <b>control.</b> Although this provided the player with a proper <b>tone</b> <b>control,</b> this assembly did away with any sort of pickup combination. Eventually from late 1967 Fender again modified the circuit for the final time to give the Telecaster a more traditional twin pickup switching system: neck pickup alone with <b>tone</b> <b>control</b> in the first position, both pickups together with the <b>tone</b> <b>control</b> in the middle position and in the third position the bridge pickup alone with the <b>tone</b> <b>control.</b>|$|R
50|$|Most Cabronitas {{have two}} pickups {{but do not}} have a <b>tone</b> <b>control.</b> This is another first for the Telecaster. A <b>tone</b> <b>control</b> can be added {{aftermarket}} by using a stacked potentiometer, but many argue that dropping the <b>tone</b> <b>control</b> gives the instrument a bit more sparkle and highs in the tone, as a <b>tone</b> <b>control</b> filters some of the higher frequencies even when set to the highest level.|$|R
50|$|Vereker {{believed}} that a properly designed amplifier would not need <b>tone</b> <b>controls,</b> since these filters were often palliatives for poor design. He contended that <b>tone</b> <b>controls</b> represented a cost of manufacture yet were detrimental to sound quality. Therefore, starting with the NAC 12, Naim amplifiers have never featured the <b>tone</b> <b>controls</b> that were popular elsewhere in the industry.|$|R
5000|$|In {{their most}} basic form, <b>tone</b> <b>control</b> {{circuits}} attenuate the {{high or low}} frequencies of the signal. This is called treble or bass [...] "cut". The simplest <b>tone</b> <b>control</b> circuits are passive circuits which utilize only resistors and capacitors or inductors. They rely on the property of capacitive reactance or inductive reactance to inhibit or enhance an AC signal, in a frequency-dependent manner. Active <b>tone</b> <b>controls</b> may also amplify or [...] "boost" [...] certain frequencies. More elaborate <b>tone</b> <b>control</b> circuits can boost or attenuate the middle range of frequencies.|$|R
50|$|Historically, <b>tone</b> <b>control</b> was {{achieved}} via analog electronics, and most <b>tone</b> <b>control</b> circuits produced today still use the analog process. Nonetheless, digital approaches {{are increasingly being}} implemented {{through the use of}} digital signal processing.|$|R
5000|$|A {{preamplifier}} selects {{among several}} audio inputs, amplifies source-level signals (such as those from a turntable), {{and allows the}} listener to adjust the sound with volume and <b>tone</b> <b>controls.</b> Many audiophile-oriented preamplifiers lack <b>tone</b> <b>controls.</b> A power amplifier takes the [...] "line-level" [...] audio signal from the preamplifier and drives the loudspeakers. An integrated amplifier combines the functions of power amplification with input switching and volume and <b>tone</b> <b>control.</b> Both pre/power combinations and integrated amplifiers are widely used by audiophiles.|$|R
50|$|The {{simplest}} <b>tone</b> <b>control</b> is {{a single}} knob that when turned in one direction enhances treble frequencies and the other direction enhances bass frequencies. This was the first type of <b>tone</b> <b>control,</b> typically found on radios and record players from the 1930s to the 1970s.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Tone</b> <b>control</b> is {{also used}} to adjust an audio signal during recording. For instance, if the {{acoustics}} of the recording site cause it to absorb some frequencies more than others, <b>tone</b> <b>control</b> can be used to amplify or [...] "boost" [...] the frequencies the room dampens.|$|R

50|$|The {{electronics}} also {{differed in}} that the Prodigy featured a single volume and single <b>tone</b> <b>control.</b> Traditional Stratocasters have a single volume, but have separate <b>tone</b> <b>controls</b> for the neck and middle pickup, with no <b>tone</b> <b>control</b> for the bridge pickup. Traditional Stratocasters also have a rout {{on the face of}} the guitar for a somewhat large, chromed, and angled input jack. This is missing from the Prodigy. It instead uses the third hole in the pickguard (which would normally be for the middle pickup tone knob) as the mounting position for the input jack.|$|R
5000|$|Since their {{introduction}} in 2004, all Custom Shop Clapton Stratocasters (Team Built and Master Built) used {{a standard}} <b>tone</b> <b>control</b> {{instead of a}} TBX tone circuit. The TBX feature has been re-introduced in 2009 on [...] "Team Built" [...] versions; only the [...] "Master Built" [...] models had a normal <b>tone</b> <b>control.</b>|$|R

50|$|Apart {{from the}} pickups, John Birch applied a single-knob bass-cut/treble-cut <b>tone</b> <b>control</b> at all his instruments, {{equivalent}} to the controls at 1940/50 Epiphone Electar guitars and early 1950 Gretsch guitars with DeArmond Dynasonic pickups.

5000|$|The Marshall Major (Model 1967 [...] ) was {{a guitar}} {{amplifier}} made by Marshall. It {{was introduced in}} 1967 as the [...] "Marshall 200" [...] (in reference to the wattage of the amplifier). It had a plexi panel and two inputs in one channel, but {{in contrast with the}} 100 watt heads made by Marshall, the first series had split <b>tone</b> <b>controls</b> similar to the Sound City amps. For the second series, in late 1968, Marshall reverted to ordinary passive <b>tone</b> <b>controls,</b> and was called [...] "Marshall Major". Some authors claim the first version had active <b>tone</b> <b>controls</b> but this is incorrect, the schematics for all versions are available online.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Tone</b> <b>control</b> {{is a type}} of {{equalization}} used to make specific pitches or [...] "frequencies" [...] in {{an audio}} signal softer or louder. It allows a listener to adjust the tone of the sound produced by an audio system to his liking, for example to compensate for inadequate bass response of loudspeakers or earphones, tonal qualities of the room, or hearing impairment. A <b>tone</b> <b>control</b> circuit is an electronic circuit that consists of a network of filters which modify the signal before it is fed to speakers, headphones or recording devices by way of an amplifier. <b>Tone</b> <b>controls</b> are found on many sound systems: radios, portable music players, boomboxes, public address systems, and musical instrument amplifiers.|$|R
30|$|Pickup {{signals are}} fed to the {{amplifier}} section, {{which also includes}} <b>tone</b> <b>controls</b> and a volume potentiometer. The amplifier schematic is publicly available [36], {{and it has been}} used to gather a basic understanding of its functioning. Some of the components, such as the <b>tone</b> <b>controls</b> and the transistors, have been isolated to conduct simulations and obtain an estimate of the frequency response by means of an electric circuit simulator.|$|R
5000|$|The ES-165 was {{originally}} released {{with a single}} 490R humbucker, one volume control (300k Linear taper) and one <b>tone</b> <b>control</b> (500K audio with a [...]022 microfarad ceramic disc capacitor.) In 2004 the 490R humbucker was replaced with a Gibson BJB Floating humbucker and the <b>tone</b> <b>control</b> was removed. The volume {{was moved to the}} surface of the pickguard. On all variants the pickguard is a three-ply black/white/black beveled pickguard.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} Upgrade {{was introduced}} in 1991 and had a poplar body, three Lace Sensor pickups (models Blue at the neck, Silver {{in the middle and}} Red at the bridge) and a treble/bass expander (TBX) <b>tone</b> <b>control.</b> The TBX was a dual function stacked potentiometer <b>tone</b> <b>control.</b> From settings 1 to 5, the TBX responded like a normal <b>tone</b> <b>control</b> and routed the signal through a 250k pot with a shunt [...]022uF capacitor to cut treble. Settings 6 to 10 routed the signal directly through a 1 meg pot which supposedly cut bass, although how this was to be accomplished without a series capacitor remains a mystery. This model was available in Black/Gold Paisley, Black/Candy Red Paisley, Pearl White and Frost Red.|$|R

The levers of AI and pre-AI lenses were intended only to close the aperture to its manual setting. The advance of <b>aperture</b> <b>control</b> by the camera body itself, by partial actuation of the stop-down lever, meant more precision was required for consistent exposure. This feature is indicated by a Lens Type Signal notch in the lens mount. Although later Nikon cameras cannot <b>control</b> the <b>apertures</b> of AI-S lenses as the F4, they <b>control</b> the <b>apertures</b> of AF lenses using the same method of partial lever actuation and standardized response.|$|R

50|$|In the 1920s, the {{earliest}} combo amplifiers {{did not have}} any <b>tone</b> <b>controls.</b> <b>Tone</b> <b>controls</b> on early guitar amplifiers were very simple and provided a great deal of treble boost, but the limited controls, the loudspeakers used, and the low power of the amplifiers (typically 15 watts or less prior to the mid-1950s) gave poor high treble and bass output. This made these early amplifier/speaker systems a poor way for upright bass players to amplify the sound of their instruments.|$|R
