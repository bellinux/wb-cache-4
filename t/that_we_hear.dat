500|$|The last {{of these}} pamphlets, Taxation No Tyranny (1775), was a defence of the Coercive Acts and a {{response}} to the Declaration of Rights of the First Continental Congress of America, which protested against taxation without representation. Johnson argued that in emigrating to America, colonists had [...] "voluntarily resigned the power of voting", but they still had [...] "virtual representation" [...] in Parliament. In a parody of the Declaration of Rights, Johnson suggested that the Americans had no more right to govern themselves than the Cornish people, and asked [...] "How is it <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>hear</b> the loudest yelps for liberty among the drivers of negroes?" [...] If the Americans wanted to participate in Parliament, said Johnson, they could move to England and purchase an estate. Johnson denounced English supporters of American separatists as [...] "traitors to this country", and hoped that the matter would be settled without bloodshed, but he felt confident that it would end with [...] "English superiority and American obedience". Years before, Johnson had stated that the English and the French were just [...] "two robbers" [...] who were stealing land from the natives, and that neither deserved to live there. After the signing of the 1783 Peace of Paris treaty, marking the colonists' defeat of the British, Johnson was [...] "deeply disturbed" [...] with the [...] "state of this kingdom".|$|E

2500|$|The New Testament has {{a biblical}} account of Arab {{conversion}} to Christianity {{recorded in the}} book of Acts. When Saint Peter preaches to the people of Jerusalem, they ask, [...] "And how is it <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>hear,</b> each of us in his own native language? [...] both Jews and proselytes, Cretans and Arabians—we hear them telling in our own tongues the mighty works of God." [...] (Acts 2:8, 11, English Standard Version). Arab Christians are thus one of the oldest Christian communities.|$|E

2500|$|Meanwhile, in Etruria Gellius Egnatius, a Samnite commander, was organising a {{campaign}} against Rome. Almost all the Etruscan city-states voted for war, the nearest Umbrian tribes joined in and there were attempts to hire Gauls as auxiliaries. News of this reached Rome and Appius Claudius set off for Etruria with two legions and 15,000 allied troops. [...] Lucius Volumnius had already left for Samnium with two legions and 12,000 allies. This {{is the first time}} Livy gives details about the Roman forces and figures for the allied troops for the Samnite wars. It is also the first time <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>hear</b> of the consuls commanding two legions each. Including the forces of the proconsuls, in this year the Romans must have mobilised six legions.|$|E
2500|$|The {{nature of}} American {{democracy}} was also questioned. The sentiment {{was that the}} country lacked [...] " [...] monarch, aristocracy, strong traditions, official religion, or rigid class system," [...] according to Rubin, and its democracy was attacked by some Europeans {{in the early nineteenth}} century as degraded, a travesty, and a failure. The French Revolution, which was loathed by many European conservatives, also implicated the United States and the idea of creating a constitution on abstract and universal principles. That the country was intended to be a bastion of liberty was also seen as fraudulent given that it had been established with slavery. [...] "How is it <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>hear</b> the loudest yelps for liberty among the drivers of negroes?" [...] asked Samuel Johnson in 1775. He famously stated that, [...] "I am willing to love all mankind, except an American".|$|E

2500|$|Later after 1540 {{she gained}} a {{position}} in the household of Anne of Cleves, 4th wife of King Henry VIII from 6 January 1540 to 9 July 1540. However, she never achieved the coveted position of maid of honour, as did her sister Anne Basset, as Anne of Cleves' marriage to the king was soon annulled to facilitate his marriage to Catherine Howard. Katharine Basset was referred to thereafter simply as [...] "The Lady Anne of Cleves' woman". Anne resided at Hever Castle, the old family seat of the Boleyn family. The pursuit of a place at court for Katharine is well documented in the Lisle Papers. In 1539 Katherine wrote to her mother: [...] "...Madame, the cause of my writing to your ladyship is <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>hear</b> say that the King's grace shall be married and my lord and my lady (i.e. Rutland) as yet doth hear no word of their coming up to London. Wherefore I desire your ladyship that ye will be so good lady and mother unto me as to speak so that I {{may be one of the}} queen's maids..." [...] (signed [...] "Katherin Bassitt") Her mother took the opportunity of making the request via John Norris, brother of Henry Norris. On her way to England Queen Anne of Cleves in December 1539 had an enforced stay at Calais, and Lord Lisle used his influence as Lord Deputy of Calais, on behalf of his step-daughter Katharine, to speak to the vice-chancellor of the Duchy of Cleves, Henry Olisleger, who wrote to Lord Lisle on 6 January 1540 with disappointing news as follows: ...|$|E
2500|$|... "And {{when these}} men heard that Belisarius {{was coming and}} was not far away, they {{wrote a letter to}} him which ran as follows: [...] "Once more Chosroes, as you {{yourself}} doubtless know, has taken the field against the Romans, bringing a much greater army than formerly; and where he is purposing to go is not yet evident, except indeed <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>hear</b> he is very near, and that he has injured no place, but is always moving ahead. But come to us as quickly as possible, if indeed you are able to escape detection by the army of the enemy, in order that you yourself may be safe for the emperor, and that you may join us in guarding Hierapolis." [...] Such was the message of the letter. But Belisarius, not approving the advice given, came to the place called Europum, which is on the River Euphrates. From there he sent about in all directions and began to gather his army, and there he established his camp; and the officers in Hierapolis he answered with the following words: [...] "If, now, Chosroes is proceeding against any other peoples, and not against subjects of the Romans, this plan of yours is well considered and insures the greatest possible degree of safety; for it is great folly for those who have the opportunity of remaining quiet and being rid of trouble to enter into any unnecessary danger; but if, immediately after departing from here, this barbarian is going to fall upon some other territory of the Emperor Justinian, and that an exceptionally good one, but without any guard of soldiers, be assured that to perish valorously is better in every way than to be saved without a fight. For this would justly be called not salvation but treason. But come as quickly as possible to Europum, where, after collecting the whole army, I hope to deal with the enemy as God permits." [...] And when the officers saw this message, they took courage, and leaving there Justus with some few men in order to guard Hierapolis, all the others {{with the rest of the}} army came to Europum." ...|$|E
