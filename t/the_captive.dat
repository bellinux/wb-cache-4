50|$|The Uncompahgre did {{not take}} part in the uprising. General Charles Adams, a former US Indian agent, {{negotiated}} release of <b>the</b> <b>captives.</b> One of <b>the</b> <b>captives</b> was Josephine Meeker, adult daughter of the late Indian agent Nathan Meeker. <b>The</b> <b>captives</b> were brought to Chipeta and Ouray's home after their release. Adams held an inquiry into the events in Colorado.|$|R

5|$|Belisarius {{returned}} to Constantinople with the Vandals' royal treasure and <b>the</b> <b>captive</b> Gelimer {{to enjoy a}} triumph, while Africa was formally restored to imperial rule as the praetorian prefecture of Africa. Imperial control scarcely reached beyond the old Vandal kingdom, however, and the Moorish tribes of the interior proved unwilling to accept imperial rule and soon rose up in rebellion. The new province was shaken by the wars with the Moors and military rebellions, {{and it was not}} until 548 that peace was restored and Roman government firmly established.|$|E

5|$|D. s. harrissoni, {{known as}} the Bornean Rhinoceros or Eastern Sumatran rhinoceros, which was once common {{throughout}} Borneo; now, only about 15 individuals are estimated to survive. The known population lives in East Kalimantan, with them having recently gone extinct in Sabah. Reports of animals surviving in Sarawak are unconfirmed. This subspecies is named after Tom Harrisson, who worked extensively with Bornean zoology and anthropology in the 1960s. The Bornean subspecies is markedly smaller than the other two. <b>The</b> <b>captive</b> population consists of one male and two females at the Borneo Rhinoceros Sanctuary in Sabah.|$|E
5|$|In {{the mid-1960s}} {{a small group}} of Cuban iguanas was {{released}} from a zoo on Isla Magueyes, southwest of Puerto Rico, forming an independent free-ranging feral population. As of 2000, there has been talk of removing or relocating this population of iguanas by the US Department of Interior. This feral population is the source for 90% of <b>the</b> <b>captive</b> Cuban iguanas held in private collections and was the source for part of a study on animal communication and evolution conducted by Emilia Martins, a biologist at Indiana University.|$|E
5|$|Koskov, Necros, Kara, and <b>the</b> <b>captive</b> Bond fly to a Soviet {{air base}} in Afghanistan, where Koskov betrays Kara and imprisons her along with Bond. The pair escape {{and in doing so}} free a {{condemned}} prisoner, Kamran Shah, leader of the local Mujahideen. Bond and Milovy discover that Koskov is using Soviet funds to buy a massive shipment of opium from the Mujahideen, intending to keep the profits with enough left over to supply the Soviets with their arms and buy Western arms from Whitaker.|$|E

5|$|Deerfield {{and other}} {{communities}} collected funds to ransom <b>the</b> <b>captives.</b> French authorities and colonists also worked to extricate <b>the</b> <b>captives</b> from their Indian captors. Within a year's time, most of <b>the</b> <b>captives</b> were in French hands, {{a product of}} frontier commerce in humans that was fairly common at the time on both sides. The French and converted Indians worked to convert their captives to Roman Catholicism, with modest success. While adult captives proved fairly resistant to proselytizing, children were more receptive or likely to accept conversion under duress.|$|R
5|$|Sphenodon guntheri {{is present}} {{naturally}} on one small island {{with a population}} of approximately 400. In 1995, 50juvenile and 18adult Brothers Island tuatara were moved to Titi Island in Cook Strait, and their establishment monitored. Two years later, {{more than half of the}} animals had been seen again and of those all but one had gained weight. In 1998, 34juveniles from captive breeding and 20 wild-caught adults were similarly transferred to Matiu/Somes Island, a more publicly accessible location within Wellington Harbour. <b>The</b> <b>captive</b> juveniles were from induced layings from wild females.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>captive</b> {{breeding}} program, {{led by the}} San Diego Wild Animal Park and Los Angeles Zoo, {{and with}} other participating zoos around the country, including the Oklahoma City Zoo and Botanical Garden, {{got off to a}} slow start due to the condor's mating habits. However, utilizing the bird's ability to double clutch, biologists began removing the first egg from the nest and raising it with puppets, allowing the parents to lay another egg.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of lions kept in zoos are hybrids of different subspecies. Approximately 77% of <b>the</b> <b>captive</b> lions registered by the International Species Information System are of unknown origin. Nonetheless, they might carry genes that are extinct in the wild, {{and might be}} therefore important to maintain overall genetic variability of the lion. It is thought that those lions, imported to Europe before {{the middle of the}} 19th century, were mainly either Barbary lions from North Africa or lions from the Cape.|$|E

5|$|The {{operation}} was to commence {{at first light}} the next day, 10 September. The intervening time was spent securing the political and legal basis for the raid. Final approval was gained from Sierra Leonean President Ahmad Kabbah, and British Prime Minister Tony Blair, while the Army Legal Corps secured approval from the Sierra Leonean Police. Fordham, who had been leading the negotiations, telephoned the West Side Boys {{and was able to}} establish that <b>the</b> <b>captive</b> soldiers were alive, and the final orders were issued in the evening of 9 September.|$|E
5|$|The testimonies of the {{boatswain}} Cole, {{the carpenter}} Purcell, and the sailing master John Fryer were not unfavourable towards Heywood. However, Thomas Hayward's declared belief that Heywood {{was with the}} mutineers was damaging, as was the evidence of John Hallett concerning Heywood's alleged insolence in laughing and turning away from <b>the</b> <b>captive</b> Blighâ€”though Hallett had previously written to Nessy Heywood professing total ignorance of the part Heywood had played in the mutiny.|$|E
5|$|Their {{happiness}} {{together is}} brought to an end when Calchas persuades Agamemnon to arrange Cressida's return to him {{as part of a}} hostage exchange in which <b>the</b> <b>captive</b> Trojan Antenor is freed. The two lovers are distraught and even think of eloping together but they finally cooperate with the exchange. Despite Cressida's initial intention to remain faithful to Troilus, the Greek warrior Diomedes wins her heart. When Troilus learns of this, he seeks revenge on Diomedes and the Greeks and dies in battle. Just as Cressida betrayed Troilus, Antenor was later to betray Troy.|$|E

Rather, Rachidi asserted the hunger strike was ultimately <b>the</b> <b>captives</b> way of fighting for justice.Rachidi said that, since <b>the</b> <b>captives</b> were older and more frail than they were during previous thunder strikes, he feared captives would die during this strike.|$|R

5|$|Those who remained, {{such as the}} lame, {{the blind}} and the aged, {{employed}} themselves in cultivating the land and doing other manual work. Many were made to carry baskets filled with gobra (cowdung) for three days as a public warning to others. The stubborn Christians were given the most menial tasks, and made {{to work in the}} paddy fields. They were underfed, and immediately imprisoned for fighting. Completely isolated from any women, the idea was for <b>the</b> <b>captive</b> men to die of old age without creating any progeny.|$|E
5|$|Asad {{divided the}} spoils among his men, sending <b>the</b> <b>captive</b> Turgesh {{women to the}} local Iranian dehgans. He {{remained}} {{at the site of}} his victory for five days, before returning to Balkh, nine days after his departure. From there he set out for Jazza, where the khagan had fled. Suluk fled before the Arab pursuit, but the Arabs were soon beset by heavy rain and snow, allowing the khagan and Ibn Surayj to escape to Upper Tokharistan, whence they moved on to Usrushana. The Turgesh raiding parties left behind in Khurasan were captured or destroyed one by one by Asad and his officers, and only a few Sogdians managed to escape back across the Oxus.|$|E
5|$|Bond {{follows the}} {{diamonds}} to a pick-up by Bert Saxby, Whyte's head of security, and then onto a research laboratory owned by Whyte, where {{he finds that}} a satellite is being built by a laser refraction specialist, Professor Dr. Metz.

Blofeld admits that he intends to auction it to the highest bidder. Bond escapes and frees <b>the</b> <b>captive</b> Whyte and they establish that Blofeld is using an offshore oil rig as his base. Bond attacks the rig, stopping Blofeld's operation and dispersing his organisation.|$|E
