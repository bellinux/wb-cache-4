He wrote his memoirs (“Having Been a Soldier”), undertook some freelance journalism and briefly took a job as management trainee with Beaverbrook Newspapers. However, he had become a popular public figure and <b>turned</b> <b>this</b> to his advantage when he started a new career in politics.|$|E
5|$|The journey's beginning, on 9 July 1763, was inauspicious; on {{the first}} day a {{carriage}} wheel broke, requiring a 24-hour pause while repairs were carried out. Leopold <b>turned</b> <b>this</b> delay to advantage by taking Wolfgang to the nearby church at Wasserburg, where according to Leopold the boy played on the organ pedalboard {{as if he had been}} studying it for months. In Munich, on successive evenings, the children played before Elector Maximilian III, earning from these engagements the equivalent of half of Leopold's annual salary of 354 gulden or florins. The next stop was Augsburg, where Leopold's estranged mother refused to attend any of the three concerts given there. The family then moved on to Schwetzingen and the Mannheim court, where the children's performance apparently amazed Elector Palatine Karl Theodor and his Electress.|$|E
5|$|The new Chief of Staff, General Malin Craig offered Eichelberger {{command of}} the 29th Infantry, the {{demonstration}} regiment based at Fort Benning, Georgia. Eichelberger <b>turned</b> <b>this</b> down, {{as he had been}} away from the infantry for many years, and some infantry officers might be jealous. Instead, he accepted {{command of the}} 30th Infantry, a less prestigious unit stationed at the Presidio of San Francisco, but there were still officers who resented someone attaining command of a regiment at the age of 52. Before departing, he took a brief course at the Infantry School at Fort Benning to reacquaint himself with the infantry. As part of the 3rd Infantry Division, the 30th Infantry took part in a series of major training exercises over the next two years.|$|E
25|$|Motorcycles must be {{leaned in}} order to make <b>turns.</b> <b>This</b> lean is induced by the method known as countersteering, in which the rider {{momentarily}} steers the handlebars in the direction opposite of the desired <b>turn.</b> <b>This</b> practice is counterintuitive and therefore often confusing to novices and even many experienced motorcyclists.|$|R

25|$|It {{has been}} demonstrated, however, that resultatives exist {{independently}} of the perfect in sentences like I <b>turned</b> <b>this</b> offer down, creating the need to reexamine the role of resultatives. To address this, it has been claimed that the resultative expresses both a state and the preceding action it has resulted from. This emphasizes that the resultative describes how a state was acted upon. Therefore, it must use the passive form. However, this analysis {{does not account for}} phrases such as I <b>turned</b> <b>this</b> offer down, which uses the active rather than the passive voice.|$|E

He never held office again, and although Labor offered him a position in Chris Watson's ministry, he <b>turned</b> <b>this</b> down, presumably because of ill health. He remained as Member for Adelaide, being allowed to run unopposed at both the 1903 and 1906 elections.|$|E

25|$|The form of {{the symphony}} is startlingly original. Since the time of Joseph Haydn, a {{movement}} in a symphony would typically be unified by an approximately constant tempo and would attain variety by use of contrasting themes in different keys. Sibelius <b>turned</b> <b>this</b> scheme on its head. The symphony is unified by the key of C (every significant passage in the work is in C major or C minor), and variety is achieved by an almost constantly changing tempo, {{as well as by}} contrasts of mode, articulation and texture.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{greatest}} burdens on the government was the Canadian National Railway (CNR). The federal government had taken {{over a number of}} defunct and bankrupt railways during World War I and the 1920s. The debt the government assumed was over $2 billion, a massive sum at the time, but during the boom years it seemed payable. The Depression <b>turned</b> <b>this</b> debt into a crushing burden. Due to the decrease in trade, the CNR also began to lose substantial amounts of money during the Depression, and had to be further bailed out by the government.|$|E

The VI Corps attackers rolled past Confederate Brigadier General William McComb's brigade and captured Confederate Fort Davis, lost it to McComb's counterattack about 20 minutes later and then recaptured it a short time later. By 7:45a.m., Heth and the remaining men of his division, with only Brigadier General John R. Cooke's brigade mostly intact, were withdrawing toward Sutherland's Station.|$|E

Accepting {{a position}} as associate editor at Cosmopolitan magazine, she <b>turned</b> <b>this</b> forum into an opportunity to campaign for greater public acceptance of aviation, especially focusing {{on the role of}} women entering the field. In 1929, Earhart was among the first aviators to promote commercial air travel through the development of a passenger airline service; along with Charles Lindbergh, she represented Transcontinental Air Transport (TAT, later TWA) and invested time and money in setting up the first regional shuttle service between New York and Washington, D.C., the Ludington Airline. She was a Vice President of National Airways, which conducted the flying operations of the Boston-Maine Airways and several other airlines in the northeast. By 1940, it had become Northeast Airlines.|$|E

25|$|Upon {{leaving the}} UN a year later, Holbrooke {{took over a}} nearly moribund NGO that was {{intended}} to mobilize businesses and corporations {{in the fight against}} AIDS. At the time, it had 17 members. Over the next six years, Holbrooke <b>turned</b> <b>this</b> organization—originally called the Global Business Council on HIV/AIDS—into a worldwide organization with over 225 members. It expanded to include malaria and tuberculosis, becoming the Global Business Coalition on HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria in 2006. In 2011, the organization became GBCHealth and expanded its mandate to include an array of health issues. GBCHealth is the official focal point for mobilizing the business community in support of The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and has grown into {{an important part of the}} ongoing war against these three diseases.|$|E
25|$|These are folded down, so {{that the}} paper lies {{on the surface of}} the inked type. The bed is rolled under the platen, using a {{windlass}} mechanism. A small rotating handle is used called the 'rounce' to do this, and the impression is made with a screw that transmits pressure through the platen. To turn the screw the long handle attached to it is <b>turned.</b> <b>This</b> is known as the bar or 'Devil's Tail.' In a well-set-up press, the springiness of the paper, frisket, and tympan caused the bar to spring back and raise the platen, the windlass turned again to move the bed back to its original position, the tympan and frisket raised and opened, and the printed sheet removed. Such presses were always worked by hand. After around 1800, iron presses were developed, some of which could be operated by steam power.|$|E
25|$|To {{get to the}} airfield, {{which was}} {{to the north of}} Barce, T1 patrol skirted {{the eastern side of the}} town using the main road. They were passed by one Italian {{motorised}} unit with which friendly greetings were exchanged. As the unit approached the airfield Captain Wilder left his commander's jeep because he wanted to drive his old vehicle Tutira III; the others manning the truck were Troopers Parker and Holland. Near the airfield entrance the patrol was challenged by several sentries who were shot down; on reaching the airfield gates they were found to be shut but unlocked. Wilder opened the gates and the trucks drove through onto the airfield. The first target encountered was a truck and trailer unit carrying 52 cans of aviation fuel. Machine gun fire <b>turned</b> <b>this</b> into a fireball which illuminated much of the airfield, making it easier for the unit to find their way around.|$|E
