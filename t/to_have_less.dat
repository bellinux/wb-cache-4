5|$|The {{amount of}} food waste {{produced}} by a household and its occupants is affected by several factors; WRAP found the most impacting factors to be: firstly {{the size of the}} household, followed by the age of the individual occupants and finally the household composition (e.g. single occupant household). The other factors: job status, lifestage, ethnicity and occupation grouping of individuals were found <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>less</b> correlation between the amount of avoidable waste.|$|E
5|$|From the 1940s to the 1960s, The Accounting Review {{published}} articles of greater diversity, and leading authors {{during this period}} tended <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>less</b> practical accounting experience and more formal education. During this period, the three individuals that accounted {{for most of the}} editorial duties of the journal were A. C. Littleton (1944-1947), Frank Smith (1950-1959) and Robert Mautz (1960-1962), all of whom either had practical accounting experience, or were leading authors prior to 1945, when the journal was oriented towards the accounting practice.|$|E
5|$|In 1946, Magnusson {{established}} {{the use of}} stem cells from bone marrow with the first surgical debridement of an OCD lesion. These cells typically differentiate into fibrocartilage and rarely form hyaline cartilage. While small lesions can be resurfaced using this form of surgery, the repair tissue tends <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>less</b> strength than normal hyaline cartilage and must be protected for 6 to 12 months. Results for large lesions tend to diminish over time; this {{can be attributed to}} the decreased resilience and poor wear characteristics of the fibrocartilage.|$|E

5|$|Snowfall {{is often}} heavier in the Sussex Weald than {{in many other}} low-lying parts of central and {{southern}} England due to the proximity of moisture-laden southerly tracking low pressure systems bringing easterly winds and snow to areas from South London southwards. However, again due to the southerly location of the area, with warmer air from the nearby English Channel, the snow is often temporary as low pressure systems track north bringing in milder air; areas immediately north of London tend <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>less</b> accumulation, but lying for a longer duration.|$|E
5|$|The Austrians {{believed}} their ships <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>less</b> effective guns than their enemy, so decided {{to engage the}} Italians at close range and ram them. The Austrian fleet formed into an arrowhead formation with the ironclads in the first line, charging at the Italian ironclad squadron. In the melée which followed both sides were frustrated {{by the lack of}} damage inflicted by guns, and by the difficulty of ramming—nonetheless, the effective ramming attack being made by the Austrian flagship against the Italian attracted great attention in following years.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} eight {{iterations}} in the Naga series, {{not counting the}} redesigned versions, with release dates spanning from 2009 to 2016. The mice are, in order of release: the Naga, Naga Epic, Naga 2012, Naga Hex, Naga 2014, Naga Epic Chroma, Naga Chroma, and Naga Hex v2. All except the Naga Epic and the Naga Epic Chroma are wired and connected through a USB port. The Naga Hex and the Naga Hex v2 are the only iterations <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>less</b> than twelve buttons, with six and seven respectively. The Naga 2014 is the only mouse in the series to have a left-handed version. The colors of the mice vary.|$|E

5|$|Ueland was {{unanimously}} fired as CEO by NSB's {{board on}} 29 June. Immediately afterwards his deputy Randi Flesland resigned, {{after she had}} rejected the board's proposal for her to become acting CEO. The same day, Adtranz assumed full responsibility for the defects, and guaranteed that they would cover NSB's costs. In a report, Adtranz stated that the axles should be examined every , which would mean weekly inspections. They stated that they hoped further inquiries {{would find a way}} <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>less</b> frequent inspections. This was rejected by NSB, who would not have sufficient trains to run the schedules with such a tight inspection scheme. Instead, Adtranz and NSB agreed to a new programme which would involve inspection every three weeks.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, Dugan {{developed}} a gain limiting improvement to the automixing algorithm. The Dugan Gain Limiting System was patented in September 1989 and {{presented to the}} 87th AES convention in October. Dugan described for the AES his prototype of an automixer to be inserted into selected microphone channels of a mixing console, operated by a person, to help in mixing multiple live microphones <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>less</b> reverberation and noise, more focus on the desired sound, eliminating the mixing engineer's problem of too-slow human reaction time. The gain limiting system provided smooth, continuous control over the equivalent number of open microphones (NOM) that the automixer would send at its outputs. The NOM could be set anywhere between 1 and 10, with higher settings sounding more natural for a recording in a studio, and lower settings offering greater control of acoustic feedback {{in the presence of}} sound reinforcement loudspeakers. An embodiment of Dugan's three patents was produced as the Model D Automatic Mixing Controller, a 3U rack unit handling 8 channels which could be linked with up to 11 other Model Ds to automatically mix as many as 96 channels simultaneously.|$|E
5|$|Originally, all aetosaurs were {{considered}} {{members of the}} family Stagonolepididae. Early phylogenetic analyses split aetosaurs into two subfamilies, Aetosaurinae and Desmatosuchinae. Aetosaurines are characterized by projections called eminences on the dorsal paramedian osteoderms that are close to the midline of the back. Desmatosuchines have a few more distinguishing characteristics, including grooves on the dorsal paramedians that help them lock to the lateral plates in a tight articulation. Many desmatosuchines have long spikes projecting from the lateral plates. These spikes are especially prominent in Desmatosuchus. Aetosaurines, on the other hand, tend <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>less</b> spikes. Many aetosaurines, such as Aetosaurus and Neoaetosauroides, have smooth carapaces and lack spikes altogether. More recent studies (see below) have favored a third group, Typothoracisinae, which like Desmatosuchinae has long spikes, but differs in having more sharply angled joints between osteoderms. Moreover, the genus Aetosauroides is now often classified outside Stagonolepididae as a non-stagonolepidid aetosaur, making the names Aetosauria and Stagonolepididae no longer synonymous.|$|E

The {{equatorial}} Pacific is an HNLC (high-nitrate, low chlorophyll) region, {{with the exception}} of the area around the Galápagos Islands, where there is commonly a relatively large standing stock of phytoplankton. In this experiment, the growth rates of bacteria and the grazing rates of the organisms that feed on bacteria were measured at two stations around the Galápagos, one thought <b>to</b> <b>have</b> higher iron concentrations than the other. It was predicted that when iron was added to water samples from east of Isabela island, a large increase in growth rate would be seen, because it usually <b>has</b> <b>less</b> phytoplankton, presumably due <b>to</b> <b>having</b> <b>less</b> iron...|$|R
