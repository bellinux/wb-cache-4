50|$|Without relay valves, {{it would}} take too long for {{sufficient}} air to <b>travel</b> from the <b>brake</b> pedal valve {{to the rear of}} the truck or trailer in order to apply the rear service brakes concurrently with the front service brakes, resulting in a condition known as brake lag. To correct this condition on a long-wheel-base vehicle, a relay valve is installed near the rear service brake chambers. In tractors as well as straight-trucks, a remote air-supply is provided in the form of a large diameter pipe connected between the primary reservoir and the relay valve for remote service brake application.|$|R

An ideal system serves the occupant with comfort, minimal road disturbance, and thedriver with steer control and maneuverability.

40|$|The {{collection}} of driving habits data is gaining momentum as vehicle telematics based solutions become popular in consumer markets such as auto-insurance and driver assistance services.

40|$|The {{concept of}} the {{adhesive}} power of a tire {{with respect to the}} road involves several properties which result from the purpose of the tire; namely, connecting link between vehicle and road: (1) The tire must transfer the tractive and braking forces acting in the direction of <b>travel</b> (tractive and <b>braking</b> adhesion). (2) The tire is to prevent lateral deviations of the vehicle from the desired direction of travel (track adhesion). Moreover, the rubber tire provides part of the springing of the vehicle. Above all, it has to level out the minor road irregularities; thus it smoothes, as it were, the road and simultaneously reduces the noise of driving. The springing properties of the tire affect the adhesive power. The tests described below comprise a determination of the braking and track adhesion of individual tires. The adhesion of driven wheels has not been investigated so far. *"Versuche zur Feststellung des Haftverm_gens von Personenwagen-Bereifungen", Deutsche Kraftfahrtforschung, Technischer Forschungsbericht...|$|R
50|$|CBTC {{systems are}} modern railway {{signaling}} systems that can mainly {{be used in}} urban railway lines (either light or heavy) and APMs, although {{it could also be}} deployed on commuter lines. For main lines, a similar system might be the European Railway Traffic Management System ERTMS Level 3 (not yet fully defined).In the modern CBTC systems the trains continuously calculate and communicate their status via radio to the wayside equipment distributed along the line. This status includes, among other parameters, the exact position, speed, <b>travel</b> direction and <b>braking</b> distance. This information allows calculation of the area potentially occupied by the train on the track. It also enables the wayside equipment to define the points on the line that must never be passed by the other trains on the same track. These points are communicated to make the trains automatically and continuously adjust their speed while maintaining the safety and comfort (jerk) requirements. So, the trains continuously receive information regarding the distance to the preceding train and are then able to adjust their safety distance accordingly.|$|R
50|$|Its central {{hydraulic}} system, powering the four disc brakes (inboard in front to help lower unsprung weight) and the advanced hydro-pneumatic self-levelling suspension, {{was derived from}} the Citroën DS. It also has a feature that increased or decreased braking pressure in accordance with cargo load, without any noticeable difference in the brake pedal response. The powered system was different from the typical assisted systems in that there was virtually no <b>travel</b> on the <b>brake</b> pedal even when braking hard. The hydraulic suspension allowed the car to be raised for rough terrain at low speeds (a feature taking account of the country lanes of its native France) and to full height for easy access to the partially enclosed rear wheels. The hand brake lever is mounted on the dashboard as opposed to being mounted between the front seats. In car entertainment can be fitted in the space that would have been utilised by the handbrake. As with other Citroën cars, the hydraulic system depressurizes over several hours, so the car will sink to the bump stops when the engine is off.|$|R
40|$|Necessity of {{mobility}} {{of goods and}} people for economic development of a country has unleashed a boom in vehicle population in developing countries like India. Because of large economic disparity in the society, 2 -wheelers on the road outnumber 4 -wheelers almost 5 : 1. Using crowded roads, poor condition of roads and undisciplined traffic requires frequent starts and stops – some of them very abrupt. Pitching-over of 2 -wheelers under such “panic braking” manoeuvre puts vast number of 2 -wheeler riders under risk of sustaining severe injury as during pitch-over rider is thrown over the handle bar. In the work presented here, key operational parameters responsible for pitch over of a motorcycle, and their relative influence on the phenomenon have been identified. “Pitch-over” envelope, to define unsafe zone, in terms of these parameters has been defined. Mathematical models using analytical solutions were used to identify the key operational parameters influencing the pitch-over tendency of motorcycles. Relative effects of these parameters, like <b>travel</b> velocity, <b>braking</b> duration, brake bias, road gradient, and road friction coefficient, on threshold of pitch-over were studied using ADAMS model. This model was validated against available test results for some standard manoeuvres. Duration of application of brakes, deceleration, {{was found to be}} the most important parameter for pitch-over. Motorcycle deceleration increases non-linearly with reduction in duration of braking. With adequate time, > 2 s in this case, tendency of pitch over is negligible. However, as available time reduces to 1 s or lower, a realistic scenario on a crowded street, motorcycle will have a tendency to pitch-over even at speeds lower than 40 km/h. This highlights the importance of developing a pitch-over control system for motorcycles operating in cities of developing countries...|$|R

40|$|NoA {{vehicle that}} {{deviates}} laterally from its intended path of <b>travel</b> when the <b>brakes</b> are applied {{is considered to}} demonstrate ‘instability’ {{in the form of}} an unexpected and undesirable response to the driver input. Even where the magnitude of lateral displacement of the vehicle is small (i. e. ‘drift’ rather than ‘pull’) such a condition would be considered unacceptable by manufacturers and customers. Steering ‘drift’ during braking can be caused by several factors, some of which relate to vehicle design and others to external influences such as road conditions. The study presented here examines the causes and effects of steering drift during straight-line braking. A comparative analysis is made between two types of vehicle model: one built with rigid suspension components and the other with flexible components. In both the cases, the vehicle behaviour is simulated during braking in a straight line, and responses including lateral acceleration, yaw rate, and lateral displacement of the vehicle are predicted and analysed under fixed steering control. Suspension/steering geometry characteristics, namely toe steer and caster angle, have been studied to understand how the effect of variations in these parameters differs in models with rigid or flexible components drift during straight-line braking. Results from both vehicle models show that differences between rigid and flexible components can affect the predicted steering drift propensity. The differences between the two models have emphasized the importance of using flexible (compliant) components in vehicle handling simulations to achieve better correlation between prediction and experiment...|$|R
40|$|An optimal {{velocity}} {{trajectory for}} a heavy duty vehicle, obtained {{with the aid}} of modern GPS and digital map devices, depends on several variables. Curvature speed limitations, road grade, and posted road speed are common constraints imposed by the road travelled. This thesis presents a method for modelling and analysing a switching controller through the use of the former mentioned constraints. A non-linear model for the heavy duty vehicle is derived, enabling suitable control methods to be applied. Pontryagin’s Principal and LQR are discussed to get a profound understanding of how the controller should be designed. It is discovered that a switching controller based on optimal control and engineering experience is most favourable for the problem at hand. The controller is designed to address the main objectives set in this paper of minimising fuel consumption, <b>travelling</b> time, and <b>brake</b> wear. Gauss-Newtons’s algorithm for non-linear equations is used to estimate curve radii. Other input parameters are presumed to be available. GPS data error is discussed to perform a sensitivity analysis. An electronic horizon is produced on three road segments, entailed with data of the future road topology. Finally the switching controller is applied to the road segments. Experimental results show that the controller produces a velocity trajectory, which reduces fuel consumption by 5 - 15 % and brake wear by 15 - 35 %, while the travelling time is only increased by 1 - 2 %...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{material}} selection and design selection of high performance floating brake calliper. The main function of brake {{system is to}} decelerate or stop a car. Disc brake system consist of brake rotor, brake pads and brake calliper. Most of the commercial vehicles use brake calliper made of Gray cast iron which possess heavy weight results in high fuel consumption. Another major problem is calliper being deflection during clamping action, known as “bending of bridge” will results in extended pedal <b>travel</b> since additional <b>braking</b> fluid volume is required to compensate for deflections, reduce comfort, driving feelings and safety of vehicle. The demand of Metal Matrix Composites (MMC) is greatly increased in automotive industry since it having a lower density, higher strength and comparable modulus of elasticity as compared to Gray cast iron. The objective of this thesis is to study the advantages of Magnesium hybrid MMC to replace conventional brake calliper and proposed few innovative design alternatives for automotive industry. This is done by creating an original brake calliper and validate for appropriate material using Finite Element Analysis (FEA), followed by select optimum design. In design selection, Quality Function Deployment (QFD) approach was used to rank the design parameters, few alternative designs were created using CatiaV 5 R 17 and analyzed for static structural analysis using FEA. In the end, best floating brake calliper design among those alternative designs was selected using Super Decision software.

40|$|A twin-gas-chamber {{hydropneumatic}} suspension strut concept is proposed to achieve enhanced bounce and pitch ride, and pitch attitude control. The response {{characteristics of the}} twin-gas-chamber strut suspension are {{compared with those of}} a single-gas-chamber strut Suspension to demonstrate not Only Superior performance potentials but also the added design flexibility offered by the twin- gas- chamber struts. The relative responses of both strut suspensions are evaluated through analysis of a pitch plane vehicle model, subject to straight-line braking inputs and excitations arising from randomly distributed road elevations. A generalized formulation for the strut forces is presented to derive the bounce and pitch rates of the proposed strut Suspensions. The results reveal that the twin-gas-chamber strut Suspension exhibits a slightly lower pitch stiffness in the vicinity of design ride height, but progressively hardening effects with increasing pitch deflections. Moreover, the twin-gas-chamber strut suspension exhibits considerably fewer hardening-softening effects in suspension rate compared with the suspension involving the single-gas-chamber struts. The results attained from the parametric Studies are also discussed to demonstrate superior design flexibility of the twin-gas-chamber struts for timing of the suspension bounce and pitch stiffness properties. The dynamic responses of the vehicle model with different Suspensions are assessed subject to random road roughness excitations as well as braking torque inputs. The results demonstrate that the twin- gas-chamber strut Suspension offers considerable potential for enhancing bounce and pitch ride, pitch attitude control, and Suspension <b>travel</b> responses under <b>braking,</b> while the influence on the ride and road-holding responses under random road inputs is insignificant. The results also suggest that a relatively soft front Suspension design Could provide further enhancement of pitch ride and pitch deflection responses under random road roughness excitations...|$|R
50|$|Reverse (R): This engages {{reverse gear}} within the transmission, {{permitting}} {{the vehicle to}} be driven backward, and operates a switch {{to turn on the}} white backup lights for improved visibility (the switch may also activate a beeper on delivery trucks or other large vehicles to audibly warn other drivers and nearby pedestrians of the driver's reverse movement). To select reverse in most transmissions, the driver must come to a complete stop, depress the shift-lock button (or move the shift lever toward the driver in a column shifter, or move the shifter sideways along a notched channel in a console shifter) and select reverse. The driver should avoid engaging reverse while the vehicle is moving forwards, and likewise avoid engaging any forward gear while travelling backwards. On transmissions with a torque converter, doing so at very low speed (walking pace) is not harmful, but causes unnecessary wear on clutches and bands, and a sudden deceleration that not only is uncomfortable, but also uncontrollable since the brakes and the throttle contribute in the same direction. This sudden acceleration, or jerk, can still be felt when engaging the gear at standstill, but the driver normally suppresses this by holding the <b>brakes.</b> <b>Travelling</b> slowly in the right direction while engaging the gear minimizes the jerk further, which is actually beneficial to the wearing parts of the transmission. Electronically controlled transmissions may behave differently, as engaging a gear at speed is essentially undefined behaviour. Some modern transmissions have a safety mechanism that will resist putting the car in reverse when the vehicle is moving forward; such a mechanism may consist of a solenoid-controlled physical barrier {{on either side of the}} reverse position, electronically engaged by a switch on the brake pedal, so that the brake pedal needs to be depressed in order to allow the selection of reverse. Some electronic transmissions prevent or delay engagement of reverse gear altogether while the car is moving.|$|R
40|$|Risky driving {{behaviors}} are common among young people, {{who tend to}} exhibit excessive speeding, speeding for the thrill, driving {{too close to the}} followed vehicle, driving while using a mobile phone, and to violate other road traffic rules. Here, consistently with the question-behavior effect [1, 2] we ask whether a specific action of a prevention program involving reflective thinking [3] (i. e., answering a questionnaire on driving and traffic safety) can alert participants and induce a concern capable of modifying simulated driving performance. A sample of 116 high school students, including 46 with car driving licence (DL), participated in two sessions of simulated driving tests, separated by a 60 -min rest period during which they answered a written questionnaire on either driving safety (24 / 31 with/without DL) or ICT (22 / 39 with/without DL). A simulator – designed by ACI safe driving center at Vallelunga – supported realistic driving experience in urban, suburban, and motorway critical situations and the recording of several test parameters: speed and braking reaction time for emergency braking; number of offences (excess speeding, unsignaled lane change, collision, traveling in the emergency lane) for motorway driving. Simulated driving behavior of young adults (with/without driving license) proved to be malleable. Participants who answered the driving safety questionnaire changed their performance towards greater carefulness in the second session, compared to participants in the control group who answered the ICT questionnaire. The Session × Questionnaire interaction was significant (p < 0. 001) for both <b>travelling</b> speed and <b>braking</b> reaction time. In the pre-questionnaire session travelling speed was in the 50 - 52 km/h range, with licence holders driving slightly faster; in the post-questionnaire session participants who answered the driving safety questionnaire (presumably, thinking about risky behaviors and their effects) slowed down, while participants in the control group (induced to think about ICT) increased they average speed. In the second session participants who answered the driving safety questionnaire reacted to the “Brake” signal much faster (from about 860 ms to 760 ms), while participants who answered the ICT questionnaire reacted slightly slower (from about 800 ms to 830 ms). The overall number of offenses decreased in all participants, with a stronger benefit in participants who answered the driving safety questionnaire. In general, driving licence ownership had limited effects on change of simulated driving behavior during participation in a prevention program. Our study provides strong support for the occurrence of a question-behavior effect {{within the context of a}} safe driving program. Results and conclusions are consistent with previous research in which behavioral changes were self-reported [2], but constitute a more convincing source of evidence, given that in our study the dependent measures were referred to objective measures of driving performance (not subjective evaluations) and obtained effects emerged from an experimental design including a control group involved in reflective thinking on a topic only partially related to road safety.
