5|$|In the 2005 civic election, he {{was again}} elected, though his Richmond First party only won {{three of the}} eight seats. He unsuccessfully lobbied his fellow councillors to appoint him to fill one of Richmond's two seats at Metro Vancouver. With not even his own party members {{supporting}} him for the Metro Vancouver seat and finding himself being alone {{in a number of}} issues, such as supporting the SkyTrain line being elevated, opposing the tree preservation bylaw, and wanting <b>to</b> <b>hire</b> <b>more</b> police officers, Howard left the Richmond First party in February 2006 to be an independent.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to similar measures passed in Milwaukee and Chicago, the Minneapolis Fair Employment ordinance gave the city's newly created Fair Employment Practices Commission (FEPC) authority {{to not only}} impose fines, but also prison sentences for employers who enacted job discrimination. Larger banks and department stores saw the value in civil rights and began <b>to</b> <b>hire</b> <b>more</b> African-Americans. Humphrey also recognized that city police officers operating under racial and ethnic prejudice were causing urban unrest, so he instructed the city's police chief to have officers in minority neighborhoods keep in contact with clergy, teachers, business owners, and other neighborhood leaders. This helped to redefine the issue of prejudice and got its attention as a problem that could be solved, not just {{a fact of life}} that had to be taken for granted.|$|E
5|$|Trucking {{companies}} (motor carriers) {{can also}} play a role in HOS violations. Certain carriers may choose to knowingly ignore HOS violations made by their drivers, or even encourage their drivers to do so. Allowing drivers to violate the HOS is an effective cost-cutting measure used mostly by non-union, long haul carriers. Permitting HOS violations allows a carrier to hire fewer drivers, and run on fewer trucks than a company which follows the rules. To comply with the HOS, these companies would have <b>to</b> <b>hire</b> <b>more</b> drivers (possibly driving up wages) and purchase additional trucks and trailers. Making a change to comply with the law is complicated by competition with carriers that already comply with HOS regulations. Due to this competition, carriers who choose to switch from non-compliance could not pass on all of their increased costs associated with HOS compliance to their customers.|$|E
50|$|In 2006, Carilion's {{management}} {{warned that}} {{trends in the}} health care sector threatened to undermine the organization's financial position. In response, Carilion announced plans for a significant business reorganization that would change its emphasis from running hospitals <b>to</b> <b>hiring</b> <b>more</b> doctors in a larger number of medical specialties, with a primary goal of better coordination of patient care and an emphasis on medical education and research.|$|R

5|$|On January 25, 2017, Baker {{proposed}} a $40.5 billion state budget {{for fiscal year}} 2018, and on March 9, 2017, legislative hearings began to review it. Tax changes proposed in Baker's 2018 budget proposal include extending the state sales tax to online retailers without physical storefronts or offices in-state, a requirement that credit card companies send a 1099 tax form to individuals earning more than $600 from credit and debit card transactions, extending the state's hotel tax to room-sharing services and individuals who rent out rooms for more than 150 days a year, and a $2,000-per-employee assessment on employers that do not offer health insurance to counter spending growth in the state Medicaid program, MassHealth. Spending increases to MassHealth, local government and local education aid, higher education (including $78 million towards repairs of the University of Massachusetts Boston underground parking garage), an anti-opioid trafficking program and substance abuse services, homelessness prevention, improvement in clinical services at Bridgewater State Hospital, the Department of Children and Families <b>to</b> <b>hire</b> <b>more</b> case workers, a job retraining fund, an MBTA subsidy, and increasing state tax credits to businesses that hire unemployed military veterans {{are included in the}} proposal.|$|E
5|$|On local issues, Howard was an {{advocate}} of opening Richmond to gambling facilities, {{which led to the}} River Rock Casino Resort. He was supportive of heritage preservation measures but opposed Richmond's tree preservation bylaw. He was the only one on council who preferred the elevated option for the Canada Line (then known as the Richmond-Airport-Vancouver Line), whereas the other councillors preferred the ground level option or no SkyTrain extension at all. He was {{an advocate}} for building a convention centre and the most ardent supporter of removing a 55-acre piece of land from the Agricultural Land Reserve as a possible location for it, though the removal was refused. When the possibility of the city constructing a speed-skating oval associated with the 2010 Winter Olympics came, Howard was a vocal supporter. He travelled to Lillehammer, Norway, in 2004 as part of a committee to investigate similar facilities built for the 1994 Winter Olympics. He also traveled to Pierrefonds, Quebec and Asia as part of the sister city program. He was not supportive of proposals to build a new soccer facility or financially contributing to tall ships tourism attractions. Because previous councils had made funding commitments {{at the expense of the}} city's reserve funds rather than the tax base, Howard's time on council was marked with consistent property tax increases around 3 to 4% each year. Howard unsuccessfully lobbied other councillors <b>to</b> <b>hire</b> <b>more</b> police officers. He became the subject of a lawsuit, along with other Richmond First councillors, alleging a conflict-of-interest occurred after they approved a rezoning allowing a controversial pub.|$|E

25|$|Classical {{models of}} {{unemployment}} occurs when wages {{are too high}} for employers to be willing <b>to</b> <b>hire</b> <b>more</b> workers. Wages may be too high because of minimum wage laws or union activity. Consistent with classical unemployment, frictional unemployment occurs when appropriate job vacancies exist for a worker, but {{the length of time}} needed to search for and find the job leads to a period of unemployment.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} small {{companies}} and factories began operating {{in different parts of}} the country, which not only provide revenues to the government but also create new jobs. Improvements to the business environment have resulted in more than $1.5 billion in telecom investment and created more than 100,000 jobs since 2003. Afghan rugs are becoming popular again, allowing many carpet dealers around the country <b>to</b> <b>hire</b> <b>more</b> workers.|$|E
25|$|As {{executive}} director of the League, Young pushed major corporations <b>to</b> <b>hire</b> <b>more</b> blacks. In doing so, he fostered close relationships with CEOs such as Henry Ford II, leading some blacks to charge that Young had sold out to the white establishment. Young denied these charges and stressed the importance of working within the system to effect change. Still, Young was not afraid to take a bold stand in favor of civil rights. For instance, in 1963, Young was one of the organizers of the March on Washington despite the opposition of many white business leaders.|$|E
25|$|The Colombian {{government}} was not concerned about SCADTA, though, and did not question the loyalty of the German pilots. However, in order {{to comply with the}} United States, Colombia passed laws requiring airlines <b>to</b> <b>hire</b> <b>more</b> Colombian citizens, and for 51% of the stock of these companies to be Colombian-held. Restrictions were also placed on German pilots on how they could be utilized by an airline. For example, at least one pilot on every plane had to be Colombian, and positioning devices were placed on all of SCADTA's planes so that the government could monitor their location.|$|E

25|$|Knievel {{realized}} {{that to make}} any amount of real money he would need <b>to</b> <b>hire</b> <b>more</b> performers, stunt coordinators and other personnel {{so that he could}} concentrate on the jumps. With little money, he went looking for a sponsor and found one in Bob Blair, owner of ZDS Motors, Inc., the West coast distributor for Berliner Motor Corporation, a distributor for Norton Motorcycles. Blair offered to provide the needed motorcycles, but he wanted the name changed from the Bobby Knievel and His Motorcycle Daredevils Thrill Show to Evil Knievel and His Motorcycle Daredevils. Knievel didn't want his image to be that of a Hells Angels rider, so he convinced Blair to allow him to use Evel instead of Evil.|$|E
25|$|On Monday July 23, Formateur Leterme {{presented}} his formation memorandum called The Power of People - Turning Challenges Into Opportunities Together. This formation memorandum {{formed the basis}} for the real negotiations. It contained 80 pages and nine chapters about various issues; however, it did not contain a separate chapter on constitutional reform and devolution. In his memorandum, Leterme proposed lowering income taxes for those with low and median incomes, changing the unemployment benefits system, and expanding parental leave. He also wanted to keep several nuclear power stations open longer, build 1,500 additional prison cells, and establish an emergency budget for the FPS Justice <b>to</b> <b>hire</b> <b>more</b> people. The formateur did not want a collective regularisation of illegal immigrants, but proposed the establishment criteria to allow regularisation in individual cases.|$|E
25|$|UE also {{stood out}} in that period for its {{advocacy}} of equality for African American workers. In July 1950 UE leaders appointed Ernest Thompson, a black international representative and former rank-and-file factory worker, {{as secretary of the}} UE Fair Practices Committee. In essence the union's affirmative action officer, Thompson met with the leadership of UE locals around the country to develop and implement action plans to force employers <b>to</b> <b>hire</b> <b>more</b> black workers, and to give African Americans opportunities to advance into skilled trades jobs. In the midst of the Cold War assaults on UE, the union's newspaper reported such success stories as the promotion of a black worker at Johnson Machine to lathe operator. The company had insisted that this worker was unqualified and refused to train him, so white union members had taught him the job during their lunch breaks.|$|E

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with DC Women Kicking Ass, Kyrax2 talked about her experience at San Diego in 2011. Kyrax2 had noticed that the makeup of every panel she had been to at the convention was overwhelmingly male. At the panel, during the question period, she asked the panelists if they were committed <b>to</b> <b>hiring</b> <b>more</b> women.The response that she received from Dan Didio {{was that he was}} [...] "committed <b>to</b> <b>hiring</b> the absolute best writers and artists," [...] to which she asked, [...] "Are you saying you can't find any great women writers or artists?" [...] According to Kyrax2, the audience reaction was furious: People yelled at me to 'sit down!' and shouted out Gail Simone’s name over and over again. I said, [...] "Yes, I met Gail Simone yesterday. I like her very much. But I've attended all these other panels, and with the exception of her and one female editor, they’ve all been male." ...|$|R

25|$|The KKB then {{experienced}} a tremendous growth: {{as an independent}} organization, {{they were able to}} ask for financial support from a greater variety of institutions; furthermore, many members and patrons contributed to the improved financial situation, allowing them, for example, <b>to</b> <b>hire</b> <b>more</b> qualified teachers. Public relations were enormously strengthened and improved, and the choir got a logo by holding a public competition. In the summer of 1973, their first concert tour took place in the Bernese Oberland and their first record, a collection of choral and organ works by Felix Mendelssohn, was made. In 1974, a tour of the Netherlands followed {{with the help of the}} organist Hans Peter Aeschlimann, and the KKB became a supporting member of the Gesellschaft für das Gute und Gemeinnützige Basel ("Society for a Good and Charitable Basel"). Their first television appearances took place in 1975 and 1976 on Südwestrundfunk.|$|E
25|$|On January 8, 1863, Governor Leland Stanford ceremoniously broke {{ground in}} Sacramento, California, to begin {{construction}} of the Central Pacific Railroad. After great initial progress along the Sacramento Valley, construction was slowed, first by {{the foothills of the}} Sierra Nevada, then by cutting a railroad bed up the mountains themselves. As they progressed higher in the mountains, winter snowstorms and a shortage of reliable labor compounded the problems. Consequently, after a trial crew of Chinese workers was hired and found to work successfully, the Central Pacific expanded its efforts <b>to</b> <b>hire</b> <b>more</b> emigrant laborers—mostly Chinese. Emigrants from poverty stricken regions of China, many of which suffered from the strife of the Taiping Rebellion, seemed to be more willing to tolerate the living and working conditions on the railroad construction, and progress on the railroad continued. The increasing necessity for tunneling as they proceeded up the mountains then began to slow progress of the line yet again.|$|E

50|$|Despite this, {{there are}} several {{advantages}} to distributed development for a business. It allows companies <b>to</b> <b>hire</b> a <b>more</b> diverse workforce, including employees that wish to work at home or don't wish to move long distances. It allows companies <b>to</b> <b>hire</b> quality workers for a lower cost, {{as opposed to the}} very high wages in Silicon Valley. Distributed development is often more suitable for modular software, where different parts of the program can be developed separately.|$|R
40|$|The {{allocation}} of {{skills in the}} firm {{is determined by the}} span of control of managers. The span of control of any given manager includes the lower skilled managers and the workers that are in the span of control of those lower skilled managers. At each level, skills are imperfect substitutes in the production of output and there are decreasing returns <b>to</b> <b>hiring</b> <b>more</b> agents with the same skill level. In a competitive labor market with atomless firms, we find that: 1. firms have a non-degenerate skill distribution; 2. larger firms <b>hire</b> disproportionately <b>more</b> skilled workers. As a result, large firms have a skill distribution that is more skewed and they pay on average higher wages; 3. The presence of a non-divisibility as in Lucas (1978) will pin down the skill level of the highest skilled manager. When investment in skills is endogenized, we find that the equilibrium skill distribution has a long right tail, even if ex ante all agents are identical. ...|$|R
50|$|According to {{researchers}} at the University of California, Berkeley and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, {{the primary cause of}} this gap is discrimination manifested in the tendency of women <b>to</b> be <b>hired</b> <b>more</b> frequently in lower paying occupations, in addition to the fact that male dominated occupations are higher paying than female dominated occupations, and that, even within comparable occupations, women are often paid less than men.|$|R
