Moreover, the constant and rapid development of European environmental law makes its reception in the internal law even more difficult.

40|$|International audienceBusiness {{applications}} in open and dynamic service markets offer great opportunities for both consumers {{as well as}} for providers of services. However, the management of related business processes in such environments requires considerable (often still manual) effort. Specific additional challenges arise in highly dynamic environments which may lead, e. g., to service failures or even to complete disappearance of partners and, consequently, a need to reconfigure related processes. This work aims at generic software support for addressing such challenges mainly by providing an extensible negotiation framework which is capable of performing the tasks of service selection and service execution automatically. Its technical basis are augmented, reusable and highly autonomous service components that can be tailored towards the specific needs of each business process. In addition, the implementation of <b>the</b> <b>negotiation</b> <b>framework</b> includes a simulation component which offers convenient means to study the outcome of different settings of the business environment a priori...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Automatic vessel collision-avoidance {{systems have}} been studied {{in the fields of}} {{artificial}} intelligence and navigation for decades. And to facilitate automatic collision-avoidance decision-making in two-vessel-encounter situation, several expert and fuzzy expert {{systems have been}} developed. However, none of them can negotiate with each other as seafarers usually do when they intend to make a harmonious and more economic overall plan of collision avoidance in the COLREGS-COST-HIGH situations where collision avoidance following the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea(COLREGS) costs too much. A negotiation framework was put forward in our previous research to enable vessels to negotiate for optimizing collision avoidance in the COLREGS-COST-HIGH situations at open sea. In this paper, <b>the</b> <b>negotiation</b> <b>framework</b> is improved by considering the planned route of both vessels. The simulation results show that more economic overall plan of collision avoidance may be achieved by the improved framework when one or both parties deviate from their planed route or are approaching their next way points.

Forming a joint capability by contribution requires both persuasion and negotiation between the SoS coordinator and each individual system.

40|$|An {{innovative}} negotiation {{framework for}} resolving complex construction conflicts and disputes {{has been developed}} in this research. The unique feature of the proposed negotiation framework is that it {{takes into account the}} attitudes of the decision makers, which is an important human factor in construction negotiation at both the strategic and tactical levels of decision making. At the strategic level, the Graph Model for Conflict Resolution (GMCR) technique has been systematically employed as a method of determining the most beneficial strategic agreement that is possible, given the competing interests and attitudes of the decision makers. At the tactical level, a previously agreed-upon strategic decision has been analyzed in depth using utility functions {{in order to determine the}} trade-offs or concessions needed for the decision makers to reach a mutually acceptable resolution of the negotiation issues. A real-life case study of a brownfield construction negotiation has been used to illustrate how the proposed methodology can be applied and to demonstrate the importance and benefits of incorporating the attitudes of the decision makers into the negotiation process to better identify the most feasible resolutions. The proposed attitude-based negotiation framework constitutes a new systems engineering methodology that will assist managers in tackling real-world controversies, particularly in the construction industry. <b>The</b> <b>negotiation</b> <b>framework</b> has been implemented into a convenient negotiation decision support system that automates the proposed negotiation methodology. The research is expected to improve negotiation methodologies for construction disputes, thereby saving significant amounts of time and resources. The proposed methodology may also assist decision makers in overcoming the challenges of conventional negotiation processes because the incorporation of the attitudes of the decision makers results in a more accurate identification of tradeoffs, greater recognition of the level of satisfaction of the decision makers, and enhanced generation of optimum solutions...|$|E
40|$|Intellectual {{property}} law and competition law {{have been playing}} {{an important role in}} the field of licensing SEPs. During the standardisation process with the SSO, the patent holder gives its irrevocable commitment to license the patent under fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms (FRAND). If and when subsequent licensing negotiations fail with the implementer the SEP holder usually files a suit of infringement and applies for an injunction. The implementer’s response usually comprises a competition law defence relying on FRAND commitment given by the SEP holder. Case law of the CJEU and the Commission together with national litigation have examined the interplay between the SEP holders exclusive patent right and competition rules, both of which have the common goal at the end: incentivising innovation and ensuring free competition. The thesis seeks to answer the question of why and under what circumstances FRAND-encumbered SEP holder is barred from seeking injunctive relief by the presumption of abuse under Art. 102 TFEU. The question will be analysed in the light of the Huawei ruling delivered by the CJEU. Subsequent national cases applying <b>the</b> <b>negotiation</b> <b>framework</b> set forth by the ruling will be examined. The thesis follows the traditional dogmatic legal approach. The thesis makes use of the primary sources of law in form of EU and other international treaties. Secondary sources of law entail the body of case law from the CJEU and the Commission. The thesis suggests that the ruling delivered in Huawei has not fully addressed the issue of when and on what terms access to SEPs should be granted while conforming to EU competition law. The Court took a very careful approach in its decision and many open questions remain to be resolved by the national courts. The most pressing questions relate to the determination of FRAND. However, the ruling did establish a negotiation framework against which the conduct of the SEP holder and the implementer may be assessed...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A Service Level Agreement (SLA) {{is a legal}} {{contract}} between parties to ensure the Quality of Service (QoS) are provided the providers to the customers. A SLA negotiation between participants assists in defining the QoS requirements of critical service-based processes. However, <b>the</b> <b>negotiation</b> process for customers is a significant task particularly when there are multiple SaaS providers in the Cloud market, as service cost and quality are constantly changing and consumers have varying needs. Therefore, we propose a novel automated <b>negotiation</b> <b>framework</b> where a SaaS broker is utilized as the one-stop-shop for customers to achieve the required service efficiently when negotiating with multiple providers. <b>The</b> automated <b>negotiation</b> <b>framework</b> facilitates intelligent bilateral bargaining of SLAs between a SaaS broker and multiple providers to achieve different objectives for different participants. To maximize profit and improve customer satisfaction levels for the broker, we propose the design of counter offer generation strategies and decision making heuristics that take into account time, market constraints and trade-off between QoS parameters. Our negotiation heuristics are evaluated by extensive experimental studies of our framework using data from a real Cloud provider.

40|$|Negotiation {{has been}} {{extensively}} discussed in game-theoretic, economic and management science literatures for decades. Recent growing interest in autonomous interacting software agents and their potential application {{in areas such as}} electronic commerce has give increased importance to automated negotiation.

The main contribution of this paper is that it derives a precisely specified interface from these architectures that facilitates an easy integration of heterogeneous agents into <b>the</b> overall <b>negotiation</b> <b>framework.</b> <b>The</b> interface is defined as a set of adapters that allows for various levels of integration of agents into the system architecture. The functionality provided by the system architecture depends on the number of adapters that are implemented and used to connect an agent to this architecture, ranging from functionality to conduct a bilateral negotiation to functionality for computing agent internal performance measures such as the quality of an opponent model. The architecture is used as the basis of a competitive testbed which allows us to study various negotiating agents. The design yields a flexible <b>negotiation</b> <b>framework</b> that facilitates negotiating different domains potentially using different protocols whereas no details of the internal negotiating agent structure are enforced.

40|$|Automated {{negotiation}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} common approaches used to make decisions and manage disputes between computational entities leading them to optimal agreements. Many existing works tackle single-issue <b>negotiations</b> and <b>the</b> <b>negotiation</b> environment is assumed to be static so that the agents can make decisions based solely on the proposals of the counterparts and their own fixed parameters. Most real-world scenarios, however, involve complex domains and dynamic environments. In such cases, it is no longer sufficient to consider negotiation as an isolated activity in a static environment. Therefore, a more general <b>framework</b> for automated <b>negotiation</b> is needed in which <b>the</b> <b>negotiation</b> agents can be very flexible and adaptive. In this paper, we describe a generic <b>framework</b> for automated <b>negotiation,</b> which captures descriptively the social dynamics of <b>the</b> <b>negotiation</b> process. <b>The</b> proposed <b>framework</b> enables the agents to behave responsively to the changes in the environment. Their strategies can adapt as the conditions outside of <b>the</b> <b>negotiation</b> change to ensure that their decisions remain rational. And the agents are proactive and responsive by searching for options, which are outside of <b>the</b> <b>negotiation</b> and which may improve their outcomes. The key ideas and the overall system architecture together with a specific negotiation instance in a basic bilateral setting are described, along with two illustrative examples. The first example is in the context of e-commerce, and the second example is an application scenario of service level agreement negotiation in service computing.

40|$|Abstract — Automated trust {{negotiation}} (ATN) is {{an approach}} that establishes mutual trust between strangers wishing to share resources or conduct business by gradually requesting and disclosing digitally signed credentials. Previous work on improving negotiation efficiency mainly focuses on using history negotiation information, which may lead to unnecessary information leakage and cannot improve <b>the</b> <b>negotiation</b> efficiency when both negotiators do not have appropriate history information. Thus in this paper, we enhance <b>the</b> <b>negotiation</b> efficiency from a new aspect, that is, adjust policies based on trust evaluations. An ATN framework is designed to enhance <b>the</b> <b>negotiation</b> efficiency. This <b>framework</b> can simplify <b>the</b> <b>negotiation</b> process, reduce <b>the</b> number of exchanged credentials and credential validations whenever possible. Furthermore, it avoids revealing unnecessary information during <b>negotiations.</b> This <b>framework</b> presents a number of innovative features, such as the support of virtual organizations and trust evaluations, {{and the use of}} fine-grained adaptive policies to adjust policies based on the trustworthiness levels.
