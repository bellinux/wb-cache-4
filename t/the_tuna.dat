5|$|Commercial sashimi tuna steaks {{may have}} their {{coloration}} fixated {{by the use}} of flushing with carbon monoxide (CO), whereby CO is pumped into bags containing <b>the</b> <b>tuna,</b> which is then stored at 4° Celsius. The duration of time for color fixation to occur varies per the size of the meat. For example, a two-inch tuna steak takes twenty-four hours for color fixation to be completed using this process. When utilized, color fixation using CO occurs prior to the vacuum sealing of tuna steaks for storage. In Japan, color fixation using CO is prohibited.|$|E
5|$|The {{body of a}} teleost is denser than water, so fish must {{compensate}} for the difference or they will sink. Many teleosts have a swim bladder that adjusts their buoyancy through manipulation of gases {{to allow them to}} stay at the current water depth, or ascend or descend without having to waste energy in swimming. In the more primitive groups like some minnows, the swim bladder is open to the esophagus and doubles as a lung. It is often absent in fast-swimming fishes such as <b>the</b> <b>tuna</b> and mackerel. In fish where the swim bladder is closed, the gas content is controlled through the rete mirabilis, a network of blood vessels serving as a countercurrent gas exchanger between the swim bladder and the blood. The Chondrostei such as sturgeons also have a swim bladder, but this appears to have evolved separately: other Actinopterygii such as the bowfin and the bichir do not have one, so swim bladders appear to have arisen twice, and the teleost swim bladder is not homologous with the chondrostean one.|$|E

25|$|In a 2001 study, the {{movements}} of Atlantic bluefin tuna from an area off North Carolina were studied {{with the help of}} special popup tags. When attached to a tuna, these tags monitored {{the movements}} of <b>the</b> <b>tuna</b> for about a year, then freed themselves, and floated to the surface where they transmitted their information to a satellite. The study found that <b>the</b> <b>tuna</b> had four different migration patterns. One group confined itself to the western Atlantic for a year. Another group also stayed mainly in the western Atlantic, but migrated to the Gulf of Mexico for spawning. A third group moved across the Atlantic Ocean and back again. The fourth group crossed to the eastern Atlantic and then moved into the Mediterranean Sea for spawning. The study indicates that, while there is some differentiation by spawning areas, there is essentially only one population of Atlantic bluefin tuna, intermixing groups that between them use all of the north Atlantic Ocean, the Gulf of Mexico and the Mediterranean Sea.|$|E
25|$|The dolphin-safe {{movement}} in the U.S. was led by environmental and consumer groups {{in response to the}} use of total encirclement netting. With this method, fishermen surrounded dolphin pods along with <b>the</b> <b>tuna</b> they were catching and the dolphins were given no chance to escape before the nets were lifted. This resulted in large numbers of dolphins being killed, imperiling the survival of entire species of dolphin, specifically in the Eastern Tropical Pacific.|$|E
25|$|However, <b>the</b> <b>tuna</b> {{industry}} has achieved successes in reversing cetacean bycatch trends. International {{recognition of the}} problem of cetacean bycatch in tuna fishing led to the Agreement on the International Dolphin Conservation Program in 1999 and overall there has been a dramatic reduction in death rates. In particular, dolphin bycatch in tuna fishing in the East Tropical Pacific has dropped from 500,000 per year in 1970 to 100,000 per year in 1990 to 3,000 per year in 1999 to 1,000 per year in 2006.|$|E
50|$|The little tunny's {{markings}} {{allow it}} to easily be distinguished from similar species.

The scattering of dark, fingerprint-like spots between the pectoral and pelvic fins cannot be found on any related Atlantic species. The first dorsal fin of the Atlantic bonito is also lower and sloping. Its lack of teeth on the vomer can set it apart from its close Pacific relatives, the kawakawa and the black skipjack. The dorsal fins of the bullet and frigate mackerel are set apart. Unlike the little tunny, <b>the</b> skipjack <b>tuna</b> lacks markings {{on the back and}} has broad, straight stripes on the underside.|$|R
40|$|Examining {{the stomach}} {{contents}} of the yellwfin and <b>the</b> bigeye <b>tunas</b> obtained in <b>the</b> western part of South Pacific Ocean for about thirty days, October 1958, and the following results were obtained; (1) In the Fiji area, there occured many fish having rather empty stomach than in the other area, therefore, this area seems to be poor in food organisms. (2) Food organisms found in the stomach amounted to about 27 kind (c. f. Table 4), being remarkably poor than in the equatorial region. Among them, Alepisaurids, Carangids, Lepidotids, Paralepids, Ostraciontids, Balistids, Cephalopods and Macruran shrimps occupied more than 10 %, respectively. These {{are probably the most}} important as prey of <b>tunas</b> in <b>the</b> Fiji area. (3) Coelenterates were rather abundant in the Fiji area than in the region to the north of 20 °S. (4) There differences of food-habit among both fish in respects of certain kind of preys. Several deep sea fish, such as Paralepids and Alepisaurids, occured in <b>the</b> bigeye <b>tuna</b> at higher frequency than in <b>the</b> yellowfin <b>tuna.</b> Others, such as Chiasmodontids and Sternoptychids occured in <b>the</b> bigeye <b>tuna,</b> being absent in <b>the</b> yellowfin <b>tuna.</b> Several surface sea fish, such as Carangids, Scombrids, Clupeids and Ostraciontids, on the contrary, were found more abundant in <b>the</b> yellowfin <b>tuna</b> than <b>the</b> bigeye <b>tuna.</b> Others, such as Balistids, Molids, Coryphaenids and the youngs of Katsuwonids were not seen in <b>the</b> bigeye <b>tuna.</b> From <b>the</b> mentioned above, it will be presumed that <b>the</b> bigeye <b>tuna</b> may be essentially the resident in slightly deeper layer compared with <b>the</b> yellowfin <b>tuna.</b> ﻿フイジー海域におけるマグロ類の胃内容物の特徴として下記の傾向が認められた. 1. 赤道から南北にへだたる程,空胃が多くなる. 従って,この海域はマグロ類にとって餌料となるべき生物の量が少ないものと考えられる. 2. 本海域に見られた餌料生物は約 27 種で,赤道海域より種類が顕著に少ない. そのうち, 10 %以上の高い出現率を示したpreyはミズウオ科・アジ科・シマガツオ科・ハダカエソ科・モンガラカワハギ科・ハコフグ科の魚類 6 種とイカ類・エビ類で,本海域の鮪類の餌料として重要な﻿占めるものと思われる. 3. クラゲ類は他の海域より高い出現率を示した. 4. 数種の餌料について,キハダとメバチにかなり顕著な食性の相異が認められた. 深海性のハダカエソ科・ミズウオ科はメバチにその出現割合が大きい. 深海性のムネエソ科・クロバウズギス科はメバチに出現し,キハダではその出現を見なかった. 表層性のモンガラカワハギ科・マンボ科・シイラ科及びカツオ若年魚はキハダには見られ,メバチには出現を見なかった. 又,表層性のアジ科・サバ科・イワシ科・ハコフグ科がキハダにその出現割合が大きい. 以上の傾向から,メバチの棲息分布はキハダより深い層にあるということが考えられる...|$|R
