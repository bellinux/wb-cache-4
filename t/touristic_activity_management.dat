40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the issue of}} mild <b>touristic</b> <b>activities</b> in green urban landscapes. More specifically, it uses the case of Pasfilipo Park {{in the city of}} Karditsa, Greece, where a green urban landscape has been utilized for local life improvement and illustrates existing <b>touristic</b> <b>activities</b> in this area. For the purposes of strengthening landscape’s role, various <b>touristic</b> <b>activities</b> are proposed accompanied by Information and Communications Technologies (ICT). Moreover, this paper queries scientific issues with regard to the capitalization of green urban spaces for small scale <b>touristic</b> and ecological <b>activities,</b> which support local life and local economic growth. This study addresses the above modern requirements for urban development with respect to existing natural and human resources. It attempts to answer the following question: can green open spaces in cities be capitalized for <b>touristic</b> <b>activities</b> that support sustainable growth? In this order, green spaces in cities are recognized as areas for smart growth, where mild <b>touristic</b> <b>activities</b> can be undertaken without ecologic damages and can result in simultaneous economic activities that can lead to local development...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} {{to what extent}} tourism {{is present in the}} stay of professional visitors in Barcelona, Spain. Increased opportunities in mobility and ICTs may facilitate this combination of professional and <b>touristic</b> <b>activities.</b> Following the literature, it is hypothesized that this group increasingly includes <b>touristic</b> <b>activity</b> in their professional stay, which may be performed at everyday locations such as workplace and hotel location. After a quantitative analysis of conference visitors’ activities, it was found that tourism and professional activity intermingle in the Barcelona context. However, contrary to expectations, <b>touristic</b> <b>activities</b> were mainly performed at the conventional tourism areas of the city. Furthermore, the use of (public) transport and mobile ICT-devices seem to facilitate <b>touristic</b> <b>activity.</b> The findings indicate that tourism is no longer a single, isolated activity, and should increasingly be seen in relation to daily life activities. The case of professional travel triggers further consequences for tourism research, professional life and urban contexts...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} {{phenomena}} and social-economic processes under {{the aspect of}} their evolution in time, mainly on a short term or intra-annual represents a preoccupation at a micro and macroeconomic level. For the tourism operators, this process includes knowing the touristic market and the anticipations of its evolution, as an important condition for taking decisions in their activity. The aim of this work is to analyze the <b>touristic</b> <b>activity</b> according to seasonality in Mamaia station, using qualitative and quantitative research methods. The study is important through the aspects that emphasize the specific evolution of the <b>touristic</b> <b>activity</b> from this station. For this aim, a database was formed by the monthly values of three indicators of the <b>touristic</b> <b>activity</b> (number of arrivals, number of overnights and the average duration of the stay) from the period 2010 - 2016, using a series of statistic and econometric instruments. The results of the research can be proved by the units that maintain or {{are connected to the}} <b>touristic</b> <b>activity,</b> but also to the local administration, in making up the attenuation strategy of the <b>touristic</b> <b>activity</b> concerning the seasonality of Mamaia.

Using various techniques (for instance the Spatial Planning of the Local Territory, the guide published by WTO, measurements on the 1 : 25, 000 topographic map, satellite images), there the POT and CUT urban indexes were determined, together with some specific indicators for touristic pressure on the environ-ment, such as stress and critical ecosystems. The final goal of mapping the ecologic fragility areas situated along the main di-rections for the settlement development is to underline the potential environmental changes determined by the touristic capitalization of the region...|$|R

In the same time, the agro-tourism is a way to increase the values of Romanian specificity, without affecting the quality of natural environment. So, it is imperious necessary to identify and typologies the specifics of the villages, from a touristic point of view, and to determine the specific activities that can polarize different segments of touristic necessities.

The city of Campos de Jordão, nationally known for its cool climate, European architecture and sophisticated gastronomy, is popular among people who seek both tranquility and entertainment. The objective of this assignment is to evaluate the urban impact created by the increase of noise energy due to <b>touristic</b> <b>activities</b> in the city of Campos do Jordão. Thus, measurement of sound pressure levels were carried out on holidays and working days in 15 chosen spots. The results showed a considerable elevation of noise levels, even in areas away from touristic zones.
