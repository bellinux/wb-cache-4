Hungry and not wanting to be rude by eating before they get back, Jim and Pam check the bathrooms and hear Phyllis and Bob having sex in the disabled bathroom. Phyllis and Bob finally come back to their table and Jim and Pam lose their appetites and look on in disgust as Phyllis and Bob seductively put food in each other's mouths.|$|E

They go to an {{apartment}} where they swim and eat food; Neto leaves the place when Lobo suggests that they reciprocate for the food by letting the men there caress them. Alone in downtown, Neto begs for money, and he is helped by a woman called Leninha. She takes him home <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>lunch</b> with some friends; after it, Neto and Leninha have sex. Later, at night, he is arrested for doing graffiti, and his parents pick him up at the police station. The following day, Neto is in his bedroom and his father finds a marijuana cigarette in his jacket. Neto's sister advises his parents {{to send him to}} a mental institution.|$|E
5|$|Mercedes becomes {{jealous of}} Malachy {{and his new}} girlfriend, Lynsey Nolan (Karen Hassan). Mercedes lies to Lynsey and tells her that she is HIV-positive. Mercedes tells Malachy and they {{secretly}} plan to reconcile. Lynsey learns of this and discovers Mercedes has lied. Lynsey tells Malachy, who punches Mercedes. Mercedes and Malachy reconcile. However, Malachy is badly injured in an explosion and Mercedes is forced to turn off his life support, and he subsequently dies. Malachy's family are forced by Myra to invite Mercedes to his funeral despite discovering her infidelity. Mercedes gets into an argument with Billy Alexander (Richard Graham) at her aunt Kathleen McQueen's (Alison Burrows) fundraising event, after she accuses him of touching her. Carmel apologises for Mercedes' behaviour and agrees <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>lunch</b> with Billy. When Billy visits Carmel, Myra slaps him and reveals {{that he is the}} father of Mercedes and Jacqui. He tells Mercedes and Jacqui that he needs a kidney transplant and that they are the only likely donors. When Mercedes and Jacqui refuse to be donors, Kathleen tells Billy that he is the father of her daughter Theresa McQueen (Jorgie Porter), confirming that Theresa is actually Mercedes and Jacqui's half-sister. Billy is later revealed to not be needing a kidney, and that it is actually Mercedes, Jacqui and Theresa's secret half-sister, Emily Alexander (Elizabeth Henstridge). However, Mercedes is not interested in Billy nor Emily and declines to be a donor, although Jacqui later agrees to be a donor but is revealed not to be a match, so Billy and Emily disown her and leave.|$|E

The patrol took cover among some rocks in a small wadi at Gebel Sherif and camouflaged the trucks, before preparing <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>lunch.</b> The plane returned and circled over the wadi, where it directed a patrol of the Auto-Saharan Company to intercept the Long Range Desert Group (LRDG).|$|E

It was finally {{overturned}} in August 1971, after female journalists and the general public created an outcry against the antiquated practice, and picketed the club’s meeting place. Mary Spletter was the first woman to cross the club’s threshold, and in addition <b>to</b> <b>having</b> <b>lunch</b> at the club, she was asked to sign a plaque in honor of the occasion, adding to the club’s historic collection.|$|R

On 10 January 1966, Shastri and Ayub Khan signed the Tashkent Declaration.|$|E
500|$|Calment's {{remarkable}} health presaged {{her later}} record. On television she stated J'ai jamais été malade, jamais, jamais (I {{have never been}} ill, never ever). Asked about her daily routine while at primary school, she replied that [...] "when you are young you get up at eight o'clock". In lieu of a solid breakfast she would have café au lait (coffee with milk) or chocolat (hot chocolate) and at noon her father would pick her up from school <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>lunch</b> at home before she returned to school for the afternoon.|$|E

Then, while the auctioneer stepped away <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>lunch,</b> John, Kessiah and their children escaped to a nearby safe house. When night fell, Bowley sailed the family on a log canoe [...] to Baltimore, where they met with Tubman, who brought the family to Philadelphia.|$|E
5000|$|God the Invisible King [...] "was so {{different}} from what Wells normally wrote that most people {{did not know how}} to handle it."

500|$|During one scene, Wendy tells Stan {{that she}} smelled Ms. Ellen taking a [...] "smelly dump" [...] in the {{bathroom}} {{in an attempt to}} make him less attracted to her. In the original script, Wendy originally told Stan that she had a yeast infection, but Comedy Central censors made Parker and Stone change the line. Parker and Stone said although the network typically provides great leniency in permitting obscene jokes, they often object to lines about female hygiene problems. During a cafeteria scene, a boy visible at a lunch table in the background looks exactly like Craig Tucker, but the color of his hat has been changed to make him appear to be a different character. The idea of Ms. Ellen taking one of the children to dinner came from Parker's real-life experiences. At his school, the children were able <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>lunch</b> with the teacher and principal if they were awarded [...] "Student of the Week". Parker said he went on one of the lunches once and found the experience [...] "really, really creepy" [...] because he had the impression the teacher and principal were having a romantic affair.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{opens with}} a musical number in which the members of Quahog sing about what they want for Christmas. Peter wishes to have actress and models Jessica Biel and Megan Fox.

Lois wishes to visit the Spanish coasts, and [...] "Mexico, [...] with two black guys and some blow". Chris wishes for Jennifer Garner and Meg wishes for a Lexus. The neighbors of Quahog also wish for gifts: Herbert wishes for a drummer boy (there {{is a picture of}} singer Nick Jonas on the wall while he wishes for this), Mayor Adam West wishes for a tinkertoy, Carl wishes for a Blu-ray version of The Wiz and Consuela wishes for more Lemon Pledge. Continuing with the song, Jillian Russell wishes for Easter eggs, Joe wishes for one day when kids don't stare at him, Bonnie wants platinum-plated silverware, Quagmire wants [...] "Japanese girls of no restraint" [...] to choke him and then whip him and Mort (who is Jewish) says he will sue if they put a Christmas tree in the airport. The song ends with various {{characters}} appearing in an advent calendar.|$|E
500|$|Barzun Donnelly {{recommended}} to Hynes that he consider Lou Taylor Pucci {{for the lead}} role of Mercer, believing that he was [...] "perfect". Hynes watched Pucci's 2005 film Thumbsucker and thought that [...] "We'd be so lucky to have him." [...] He contacted Pucci about the role but was leaving for Norway {{in less than a}} week to attend a friend's wedding and wanted to meet with him before leaving. Pucci was in San Francisco on a press tour and Hynes flew from Los Angeles <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>lunch</b> with him. Hynes said of the meeting, [...] "I think we really [...] each other," [...] and Pucci accepted the role a week later. Jena Malone signed on to portray Joely because she [...] "loved the script" [...] and was keen to play [...] "a woman on the cusp of learning to toy with her [...] sexual manipulation"; she only later learned that Hynes had written the role with her in mind, having previously worked with her on the short film Al as in Al. Hynes said that Zooey Deschanel, Maura Tierney, and Bill Duke each joined the cast because they [...] "read [...] and really liked it". He made a deliberate attempt to cast Deschanel and Malone against their previous types. He described Deschanel as a [...] "glamour girl" [...] and Malone as a sexually mature woman.|$|E
5000|$|It is a {{step further}} in a general trend, in France, <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>lunches</b> in {{restaurants}} that are quicker than in the past. Back in the 20th century it was common as a minimum <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a starter, then a main course, then a plate of cheese, then a dessert, then a cup of coffee, and then a digestif. Then the starter ceased to be the accepted norm, and the plate of cheese became scarce, and the digestif disappeared. The [...] "café gourmand" [...] represents a further step, as ordering the dessert and the coffee in one go gains time, avoiding the need <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> call the waiter over to order.|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{is what we}} {{are asking}} ourselves," [...] Mr. Jacks continued. [...] "In the absence of any {{definite}} clue, coincidences such as this are always interesting. In this case, as it happens, we can take them even a little further. We find that you, for instance, Miss Penelope Morse, a young American lady, celebrated for her wit and accomplishments, and well known in London society, were <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>lunched</b> with Mr. Hamilton Fynes on the day when he made his tragical arrival in London; we find too, curiously enough, that {{you were one of the}} party with whom Mr. Richard Vanderpole was <b>to</b> <b>have</b> dined and gone to the theatre on the night of his decease." ...|$|R

500|$|By 1930, MacArthur was still, at age 50, the {{youngest}} of the U.S. Army's major generals, and the best known. He left the Philippines on 19 September 1930 and for a brief time was in command of the IX Corps Area in San Francisco. On 21 November, he was sworn in as Chief of Staff of the United States Army, with the rank of general. While in Washington, he would ride home each day <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>lunch</b> with his mother. At his desk, he would wear a Japanese ceremonial kimono, cool himself with an oriental fan, and smoke cigarettes in a jeweled cigarette holder. In the evenings, he liked to read military history books. About this time, he began referring to himself as [...] "MacArthur". He had already hired a public relations staff to promote his image with the American public, together with a set of ideas he was known to favor, namely: a belief that America needed a strongman leader to deal with the possibility that Communists might lead all of the great masses of unemployed into a revolution; that America's destiny was in the Asia-Pacific region; and a strong hostility to the British Empire. One contemporary described MacArthur as the greatest actor to ever serve as a U.S Army general while another wrote that MacArthur had a court rather than a staff.|$|E
2500|$|Kasit {{revealed}} that he had planned <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>lunch</b> with the Sondhi {{on the day of}} the attack.

2500|$|City Hall {{is located}} in Government Center in {{downtown}} Boston. [...] The adjoining [...] City Hall Plaza is sometimes used for parades and rallies; most memorably, the region's championship sports teams, the Boston Celtics, Boston Bruins, New England Patriots, and the Boston Red Sox, have been feted in front of City Hall. A huge crowd in the plaza also greeted Queen Elizabeth II during her 1976 Bicentennial visit, as she walked from the Old State House to City Hall <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>lunch</b> with the Mayor.|$|E

60|$|They meant <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>lunched</b> in {{the open}} air; but, as it was cloudy, decided to spread the feast at the hotel. Such a {{delightful}} revel as followed! A scene from the 'Decameron,' modernised, would give some idea of it; for after the banquet all adjourned to the gardens of the Doria Villa, and there disported themselves as merrily {{as if all the}} plagues of life were quite forgotten, and death itself among the lost arts. Flirting and dancing, charades and singing, stories and statues, poems and pictures, gossip and gambols, absorbed the hours as pleasantly as in the olden time. And if the costumes were not as picturesque as those in Vedder's fine picture, the ladies were as lovely, the gentlemen as gallant, and all much better behaved than those of Boccaccio's party.|$|R
5000|$|The book {{highlights}} Cemal's [...] "personal transformation" [...] and {{his experiences}} in Armenia. While Cemal was in Armenia, he <b>had</b> an opportunity <b>to</b> meet and <b>have</b> <b>lunch</b> with Armen Gevorkyan, the grandson of Artashes Gevorgyan, the man who assassinated his grandfather Djemal Pasha in 1922.|$|R
2500|$|After the Imperial Japanese Navy was defeated, the Emperor called Yonai to his castle. The Emperor amiably invited Yonai <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>lunch</b> together. After that, the Emperor said, [...] "I really {{appreciated}} your reign {{and effort}} not to begin the war. I think {{we are not going}} to meet often like before". He put a pen and inkstone into a case and said, [...] "These are the things that I have used. I would like to present this as a gift to you." [...] (Agawa, n.d.). This action is extremely rare because having presented the belongings of the Emperor is the supreme honor and the utmost expression of amiability.|$|E
2500|$|Producer Gregg Hoffman {{unexpectedly}} died a {{few weeks}} after the release of Saw II. Darren Lynn Bousman, director and co-writer of Saw II, James Wan, director of Saw, and Leigh Whannell, screenwriter on both, turned down the offer to make a third film. Wan and Whannell were among the executive producers of Saw II. Bousman, Wan and Whannell got together <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>lunch</b> the day they heard of Hoffman's passing and came to conclusion that Saw III was going to be made with or without them, so they decided to make the film in dedication to Hoffman. Whannell aimed to make Saw III more emotional, describing the plot as essentially a [...] "love story" [...] between Jigsaw and Amanda.|$|E
2500|$|Initially Tennant and Lowe {{performed}} as West End {{because of their}} love of London's West End, but later {{they came up with}} the name Pet Shop Boys, derived from friends of theirs who worked in a pet shop in Ealing. Their big break came in August 1983, when Tennant was assigned by Smash Hits to interview The Police in New York. The duo were obsessed with a stream of Hi-NRG records made by New York producer Bobby Orlando, simply known as Bobby O. According to Tennant: [...] "I thought: well, if I've got to go and see The Police play, then I'm also going <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>lunch</b> with Bobby O." [...] They shared a cheeseburger and carrot cake, at a restaurant called the Applejack Diner, on 19 August (two years to the day since Tennant and Lowe had met) and, after hearing a demo tape that Tennant had brought along with him, Orlando suggested making a record with the Pet Shop Boys.|$|E
