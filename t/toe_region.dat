40|$|Irrespective of the {{mechanical}} properties of the alloy to be welded, the fatigue strength of welded joints is primarily controlled by the stress concentration associated with the weld toe or weld root. In {{order to reduce the}} effects of such notch defects in welds, which are influenced by tensile properties of the alloy, post-weld improvement techniques have been developed. The two most commonly used techniques are weld toe grinding and TIG dressing, which are intended to both remove toe defects such as non-metallic intrusions and to re-profile the weld <b>toe</b> <b>region</b> to give a lower stress concentration. In the case of TIG dressing the weld toe is re-melted to provide a smoother transition between the plate and the weld crown and to beneficially modify the residual stress redistribution. Assessing the changes to weld stress state arising from TIG-dressing is most easily accomplished through a complex numerical simulation that requires coupled thermo-fluid dynamics and solid mechanics. However, this can be expensive in terms of computational cost and time needed to reach a solution. The present paper therefore proposes a simplified numerical model that overcomes such drawbacks and which simulates the remelted <b>toe</b> <b>region</b> by means of the activation and deactivation of elements in the numerical model...|$|E

In the present paper, we develop a model for load transfer in a whole nerve, using a simple pressure vessel approximation, in order to assess the significant of stiffening of the collagenous nerve sheath on endoneurial fluid pressure. We also develop a fibril-scale mechanics model for the nerve, to model the straightening of wavy fibrils, producing the <b>toe</b> <b>region</b> observed in nerve tissue, and also to interrogate the effects of interfibrillar crosslinks on the overall properties of the tissue. Such collagen crosslinking has been implicated in complications in diabetic tissues. Our fibril-scale model uses a two-parameter Weibull model for fibril strength, in combination with statistical parameters describing fibril modulus, angle, wave-amplitude, and volume fraction to capture both <b>toe</b> <b>region</b> and failure region behavior of whole rat sciatic nerve. The extrema of equal and local load-sharing assumptions are used to map potential differences in diabetic and nondiabetic tissues.

40|$|Abstract: More than 90 % of {{injuries}} in runners are {{recorded in the}} lower extremity, equally affecting the regions of the knee, shank, and foot. Stress fractures are responsible for numerous running-related injuries. In the current study, the plantar pressure patterns of prerace, immediately postrace, and 24 hours after long-distance running in the Spartathlon were analyzed to com-pare foot loading in the respective con-ditions. Forty-six male participants of the Spartathlon ultramarathon were examined before, immediately after completion of the race, and 24 hours later with plantar pressure measure-ments during barefoot walking on a capacitive platform. The results revealed {{a significant increase in}} the peak pres-sure and impulse values in the forefoot areas and a decrease under the toes before and immediately after the race. On the contrary, no significant dif-ferences were found between the pre-race and the 24 -hour postrace values. The present findings indicate that the Spartathlon race leads to significant variations in foot-loading characteris-tics, especially in the peak pressure and impulse values under the forefoot and <b>toe</b> <b>regions.</b> Twenty-four-hour postrace data measurements reveal insignificant differences from the prerace statement, probably because of the restoration of local muscular activity...|$|R

The purpose of this study was to quantitatively assess the foot loading characteristics of diabetic patients with fifth-toe deformity through a comparative analysis with diabetic patients with healthy and normal feet. Six neuropathic diabetic female subjects with the fifth-toe deformation and six age-matched neuropathic diabetic controls without any feet deformities participated in the walking test. Dynamic barefoot plantar pressure was measured with Novel EMED force plate. Peak pressure and pressure-time integral for all 7 foot regions (rearfoot, midfoot, lateral forefoot, central forefoot, medial forefoot, great toe, and other toes) were collected. Peak pressure was significantly higher in the patients with toe deformity in rearfoot, central forefoot, and great toe regions compared with the control group. Meanwhile, loading sustaining period extended longer in great <b>toe</b> <b>region</b> of deformed group than in that of the control group, and the center of pressure was nearly in the big <b>toe</b> <b>region</b> during toe offstage.

30|$|The {{resultant}} {{load-elongation curve}} {{can be divided}} into four distinct regions according to the structural properties of the ACL. A first nonlinear region, the so-called ‘toe region’, is described as collagen fibres, which are arranged in varying degrees of crimp, easily extend under low axial forces [26, 27, 28]. The <b>toe</b> <b>region</b> is followed by a quasilinear region where collagen fibres reversibly deform. The slope of the linear region allows for reproducible determination of ligament stiffness (measured in Newtons per millimetre) and corresponds to the loads acting on the ACL during daily activities. In the intact knee, both the <b>toe</b> <b>region</b> and the linear region of the ACL loading curve will allow the tibia to translate anteriorly for 3 – 5 mm during knee motion as well as during an anterior drawer manoeuvre. With additional loading, the slope of the load-elongation curve decreases (yield-point) as plastic deformation of the collagen fibres occurs. Finally, the curve reaches the ultimate load, which is described as failure of the bone-ligamentbone complex. It may be derived from the load-elongation curve, that applying high loads to a ligament will increase the stiffness and may therefore sufficiently restrict excessive joint motion when high external loads are applied. Even more accurately, the biomechanical properties of a ligament are represented by the relation of stress and strain, where stress is defined as deformation per unit length (%) and where strain is defined as load per unit cross-sectional area (N/mm 2) [26].|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe present paper {{proposes a}} new and more {{accurate}} fatigue life prediction model for fillet welded joints in steel subjected to constant amplitude loading. With the traditional fracture mechanics approach, the greatest difficulty when computing the fatigue life of a welded detail is to determine the initial crack size a 0. The classical way to determine the stress intensity factor K (SIF) is by using the following formula Where σ is the applied stress, a is the crack size and g(a/T) the geometrical correction factor which has been determined by Gurney function or similar solutions. This approach is not accurate for short crack because of the singular V-notch behaviour close to the crack tip is not taken into account. In fact, the singular behaviour at this point has a great influence on the SIF calculation. The present work proposes an alternative approach based on the determination of the Energy Release Rate (G) in the V-notch region at the weld toe in order to calculate the stress intensity factor as follows E being the Young's modulus. Once the ΔK is determined for varying stresses, we can calculate the life fatigue based on the Paris crack propagation law. The size of the weld <b>toe</b> <b>region</b> influenced by the singular V-notch behaviour is based on experimental work concerning a cruciform steel joint subjected to an applied axial stress of 150 MPa and a weld angle of 45 °. Based the same conditions as in these experimental tests, we compared the results from the classical Gurney's approach with the results from the present methodology. The experimental results in terms of fatigue life and crack length were used as reference. When the crack growth rate is plotted against ΔK we can see that, in our approach two slopes appear. The first slope that corresponds to the short crack propagation in the weld <b>toe</b> <b>region</b> and the second slope that corresponds to the stable crack propagation far from the weld <b>toe</b> <b>region.</b> Also, for short cracks, our approach is closer to the experimental results than the Gurney's approach. Moreover, with our approach, we do not need to introduce the real initial crack size at the weld toe. It is demonstrated how the time consumed for short crack propagation becomes the dominant part of the entire fatigue life at low stress levels. The short crack propagation is more accurately described by the present model than in traditionally approaches. Future extensions of the present work will deal with the introduction of the influence of the weld toe radius and the material characteristics of the HAZ on the fatigue life duration...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study was}} to describe and compare characteristics of professional ballet and collegiate dancers, as well as investigate the relationships among these characteristics. The first portion of the study investigates differences in body composition, lower extremity and trunk muscular strength, dynamic postural stability, and landing kinematics of professional ballet dancers and collegiate dance majors. The second portion of the study determines the ability of strength to predict dynamic postural stability and kinematic variables that are potential risk factors for injury including, knee valgus, ankle inversion, and foot pronation. Fifty nine dancers participated in the study (30 professional ballet and 29 collegiate). Equal proportions of males and females were in each group. Dancers completed an injury history questionnaire, followed by assessments of body composition, dynamic postural stability, kinematics during a dance jump task, and isokinetic and isometric muscular strength. Results demonstrate that professional dancers are significantly stronger than collegiate dancers for most muscle groups tested. The study found no significant differences in dynamic postural stability, and minimal differences in kinematics. No differences were found in self-reported injury histories, except that a greater proportion of professional dancers reported injuries to the ankle, and foot and <b>toe</b> <b>regions.</b> Regression analyses revealed that gender and trunk rotation strength predicted dynamic postural stability.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to investigate the performance of geogrid reinforced soil walls with panel facing using marginal backfill with and without chimney sand drain subjected to seepage. A series of centrifuge model tests were performed at 40 gravities using a 4. 5 m radius large beam centrifuge facility available at IIT Bombay. The results revealed that a geogrid reinforced soil wall with low stiffness geogrid and without any chimney drain experienced a catastrophic failure due to excess pore water pressure that developed in the reinforced and backfill zones at the onset of seepage. In comparison, a soil wall reinforced with stiff geogrid layers was found to perform effectively even at the onset of seepage. Provision of chimney sand drain effectively decreased pore water pressure not only at the wall toe but also at mid distance from toe of the wall and thereby resulted in enhancing the wall performance under the effect of seepage forces. However, a local piping failure was observed near the <b>toe</b> <b>region</b> of the wall. The observed centrifuge test results were further analysed by performing seepage and stability analyses to evaluate the effect of thickness of sand layer in a chimney drain. An increase in thickness of sand layer in chimney drain was found to improve the discharge values and thereby enhancing the factor of safety against piping near the <b>toe</b> <b>region.</b> Based on the analysis and interpretation of centrifuge test results, it can be concluded that marginal soil can be used as a backfill in reinforced soil walls provided, it has geogrid layers of adequate stiffness and/or proper chimney drain configuration.

40|$|Weld bead {{geometry}} cannot, by {{its very}} nature, be precisely defined. Parameters such as bead shape and toe radius vary from joint to joint even in well-controlled manufacturing operations. In the Notch Stress Intensity Factor (N-SIF) approach the weld <b>toe</b> <b>region</b> is modelled as a sharp V-shaped corner and local stress distributions in planar problems can be expressed in closed form {{on the basis of}} the relevant Mode I and Mode II N-SIFs. Initially thought of as parameters suitable for quantifying only the crack initiation life, N-SIFs are shown able to predict also the total fatigue life, at least when a large part of the life is spent as in the propagation of small cracks in the highly stressed region close to the notch tip. A large amount of experimental data reported in the literature for steel and aluminium welded joints is used here to demonstrate the applicability of the N-SIF-based approach...|$|E
40|$|Objective Elevated dynamic plantar foot {{pressures}} {{significantly increase}} the risk of foot ulceration in diabetes mellitus. The aim was to determine which factors predict plantar pressures in a population of diabetic patients who are at high-risk of foot ulceration. Methods Patients with diabetes, peripheral neuropathy and a history of ulceration were eligible for inclusion in this cross sectional study. Demographic data, foot structure and function, and disease-related factors were recorded and used as potential predictor variables in the anal-yses. Barefoot peak pressures during walking were calculated for the heel, midfoot, fore-foot, lesser <b>toes,</b> and hallux <b>regions.</b> Potential predictors were investigated using multivariate linear regression analyses. 167 participants with mean age of 63 years contrib-uted 329 feet to the analyses. Results The regression models were able to predict between 6 % (heel) and 41 % (midfoot) of th...|$|R
40|$|The latest {{state of}} the art on Discrete Element Method (DEM) and the {{increased}} computational power are capable of incorporating and resolving complex physics in comminution devices such as tumbling mills. A full 3 D simulation providing a comprehensive prediction of bulk particle dynamics in a grinding mill is now possible using the latest DEM software tools. This paper explores the breakage environment in mills using DEM techniques, and how these techniques may be expanded to provide more useful data for mill and comminution device modelling. A campaign of DEM simulations were performed by varying the mill size and charge particle size distribution to explore and understand the breakage environment in mills using DEM techniques. Analysis of each mill was conducted through consideration of the total energy dissipation {{and the nature of the}} collision environment that leads to comminution. The DEM simulations show that the mill charge particle size distribution has a strong influence on the mill input power and on the way the energy is distributed across the charge. The smaller particles experience higher energies while the larger experience less, but this variation is strongly dependent on the mill size. The results also showed that the average particle collision energy increases with increasing mill size, whereas its distribution over particle size is strongly influenced by the mill content particle size distribution. The simulations also captured the energy distribution within different regions of the tumbling charge, with the <b>toe</b> impact <b>region</b> having higher impact energies and the bulk shear region having higher tangential energies. Regardless of the mill size most of the energy is consumed by the particles in the mid-size range, which has the highest percentage mass of the total charge distribution...|$|R
40|$|Background. Specific {{regions of}} the foot are {{responsible}} for the gait tasks of weight acceptance, single-limb support, and forward propulsion. With region foot pain, gait abnormalities may arise and affect the plantar pressure and force pattern utilized. Therefore, this study’s purpose was to evaluate plantar pressure and force pattern differences between adults with and without region-specific foot pain. Methods. Plantar pressure and force data were collected on Framingham Foot Study members while walking barefoot at a self-selected pace. Foot pain was evaluated by self-report and grouped by foot <b>region</b> (<b>toe,</b> forefoot, midfoot, or rearfoot) or regions (two or three or more regions) of pain. Unadjusted and adjusted linear regression with generalized estimating equations was used to determine associations between feet with and without foot pain. Results. Individuals with distal foot (forefoot or toes) pain had similar maximum vertical forces under the pain region, while those with proximal foot (rearfoot or midfoot) pain had different maximum vertical forces compared to those without regional foot pain (referent). During walking, there were significant differences in plantar loading and propulsion ranging from 2 % to 4 % betwee...|$|R
