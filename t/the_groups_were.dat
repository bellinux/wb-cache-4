5|$|As groups {{supporting}} {{autonomy and}} independence began campaigning, {{a series of}} pro-integration paramilitary groups of East Timorese began threatening violence—and indeed committing violence—around the country. Alleging pro-independence bias {{on the part of}} UNAMET, <b>the</b> <b>groups</b> <b>were</b> seen working with and receiving training from Indonesian soldiers. Before the May agreement was announced, an April paramilitary attack in Liquiça left dozens of East Timorese dead. On 16 May 1999, a gang accompanied by Indonesian troops attacked suspected independence activists in the village of Atara; in June another group attacked a UNAMET office in Maliana.|$|E
5|$|Despite these efforts, on 21February {{it became}} clear just how {{fundamentally}} opposed <b>the</b> <b>groups</b> <b>were.</b> Philip Nye, one of the dissenting brethren, asserted in a speech that a presbytery set over local congregations would become as powerful as the state and was dangerous to the commonwealth, provoking vigorous opposition from presbyterians. The next day, the Assembly finally began to establish a prescription for presbyterian government. Owing to a strong belief in {{the unity of the}} church, the Assembly continued to try to find ways to reconcile the dissenting brethren with the majority throughout 1644, including the establishment of a special committee for that purpose in March. However, on 15November, the dissenting brethren presented their reasons for disagreement {{with the rest of the}} Assembly to Parliament, and on 11December the majority submitted a draft of a presbyterian form of government.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} {{psilocybin}} are highly variable and {{depend on the}} mindset and {{environment in which the}} user has the experience, factors commonly referred to as set and setting. In the early 1960s, Timothy Leary and colleagues at Harvard University investigated the role of set and setting on the effects of psilocybin. They administered the drug to 175 volunteers from various backgrounds in an environment intended to be similar to a comfortable living room. Ninety-eight of the subjects were given questionnaires to assess their experiences and the contribution of background and situational factors. Individuals who had experience with psilocybin prior to the study reported more pleasant experiences than those for whom the drug was novel. Group size, dosage, preparation, and expectancy were important determinants of the drug response. In general, those placed in groups of more than eight individuals felt that <b>the</b> <b>groups</b> <b>were</b> less supportive, and their experiences were less pleasant. Conversely, smaller groups (fewer than six individuals) were seen as more supportive. Participants also reported having more positive reactions to the drug in those groups. Leary and colleagues proposed that psilocybin heightens suggestibility, making an individual more receptive to interpersonal interactions and environmental stimuli. These findings were affirmed in a later review by Jos ten Berge (1999), who concluded that dosage, set, and setting were fundamental factors in determining the outcome of experiments that tested the effects of psychedelic drugs on artists' creativity.|$|E

5|$|With the {{turnover}} of Point Cypress and Point Marone to South Vietnamese navy on 15 August 1970, Squadron One and its remaining division, Division 13, were decommissioned. Over 3,000 Coast Guardsmen had served with Squadron One in Vietnam since May 1965. Administrative and liaison functions {{that had been}} {{carried out by the}} Squadron One staff were turned over to the Office of the Senior Coast Guard Officer, Vietnam (SCGOV). Several officers of Squadron One were assigned temporary duties as advisors to former Squadron One cutters to further assist the new RVN commanding officers in their new duties. The Coast Guard continued to provide technical assistance and training under the SCATTOR/VECTOR programs for the SVN after Squadron One was disestablished through the formation of four Technical Assistance Groups. Each group was composed of an officer and eight to eleven engineers reporting to SCGOV. <b>The</b> <b>groups</b> <b>were</b> located at Da Nang where there were six cutters assigned; Cam Ranh Bay, six cutters; Vung Tau, eight cutters; and An Thoi, six cutters. As tours of duty for each Coast Guardsman ended, U.S. Navy personnel gradually took over the training duties.|$|E

25|$|The 12 {{participant}} {{teams were}} divided into four groups of three teams each. <b>The</b> <b>groups</b> <b>were</b> determined based on the rankings of the teams in Twenty20 as of 1 March 2007. The top two teams from each group went through to {{the second stage of}} the tournament.|$|E
25|$|Another {{figure that}} was highly {{regarded}} {{during the period}} was Jean Price-Mars. He associated the reasons behind the Occupation to the division between the Haitian elite and the poorer people of the country. He noted that <b>the</b> <b>groups</b> <b>were</b> divided over the practice of Vodou, with the implication that the elites did not recognize Vodou because they connected it to an evil practice.|$|E
25|$|In 1951, the Strategic Air Command {{began to}} {{eliminate}} its combat group {{by reducing the}} group headquarters token strength and attaching the flying squadrons directly to the wing; therefore, wings replaced the medium bombardment groups attached to Far East Air Forces (FEAF) Bomber Command for combat. <b>The</b> <b>groups</b> <b>were</b> either inactivated or reduced in strength to one officer and one enlisted.|$|E
50|$|On 25 April 1966 <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>was</b> reorganized and redesignated Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 11th Signal <b>Group.</b> <b>The</b> {{following}} December, <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>was</b> {{reassigned to}} Fort Huachuca, Arizona.|$|R

25|$|Prior to its {{closing in}} late 1969, Eastern State Penitentiary (then known as State Correctional Institution, Philadelphia) had {{established}} a far reaching program of group therapy {{with the goal of}} having all inmates involved. From 1967, when the plan was initiated, the program appears to have been moderately successful as many inmates were involved in the groups which were voluntary. An interesting aspect was that <b>the</b> <b>groups</b> <b>were</b> led by two therapists, one from the psych or social work staff, and the second from the prison officer staff.|$|E
25|$|The playoffs, {{known as}} the Red Bulls Salute, {{took place in the}} Wellblechpalast and the O2 World, Berlin between 19–22 December 2013. It was played with two groups of three teams each. The teams played a {{round-robin}} in their group, for a total of three games, and the best-seeded team from each group qualiied for the Final; all other teams were eliminated from the tournament. <b>The</b> <b>groups</b> <b>were</b> determined by a draw taking place in Berlin on 9 September 2013. The first game in each group took place in the Wellblechpalast; all other games, including the Final, were played in the O2 World.|$|E
25|$|Several groups {{called for}} a boycott of the census over the {{involvement}} of Lockheed Martin, including the Stop the War Coalition, and the Christian thinktank Ekklesia. <b>The</b> <b>groups</b> <b>were</b> concerned about sharing data with a company involved in surveillance and data processing for the CIA and FBI; and also providing funding to an arms company making nuclear missiles and cluster bombs. The Green Party also objected, and campaigned unsuccessfully to stop Lockheed Martin getting the contract, although no decision was made {{about whether or not}} to call for a boycott. The Census Alert campaign group also decided against calling for a boycott.|$|E

25|$|With {{the meeting}} of the Board of Governors to vote moved again to mid-May, <b>the</b> <b>groups</b> <b>were</b> asked to make another brief {{presentation}} to the full relocation committee on April 29, 2013. The committee voted to recommend rejection of the relocation request to the full board. When the Board of Governors finally convened in Dallas on May 15, 2013, they heard final presentations from both the Seattle and Sacramento groups. The BOG voted 22-8 against moving the Kings from Sacramento to Seattle. As the PSA for the sale of the team was, for all intents and purposes, dependent upon relocation, the NBA rejected the sale without vote.|$|E
25|$|Also {{during this}} period, {{paramilitary}} activities increased, both legally and illegally. The creation of legal CONVIVIR self-defense and intelligence gathering groups was authorized by Congress and the Samper administration in 1994. Members of CONVIVIR groups {{were accused of}} committing numerous abuses against the civilian population by several human rights organizations. <b>The</b> <b>groups</b> <b>were</b> left without legal support after a 1997 decision by the Colombian Constitutional Court which restricted many of their prerrogatives and demanded stricter oversight. However, in April 1997, preexisting paramilitary forces and several former CONVIVIR members were joined to create the AUC, a large paramilitary militia closely tied to drug trafficking which carried out attacks on the FARC and ELN rebel {{groups as well as}} civilians starting with the 1997 Mapiripán Massacre.|$|E
25|$|Human's {{attention}} on words is impacted by emotion grasping vocabulary. Negative and positive words are better recalled than neutral {{words that are}} spoken. Many different ways that {{attention is focused on}} hearing what the speaker has to say is the inflection of the presenter's voice in a sad, content, frustrated sound or in the use of words that are close to the hear. A study was conducted to observe if the use of emotional vocabulary was a key receptor of recall memory. <b>The</b> <b>groups</b> <b>were</b> put into the same lecture halls and given the same speakers, but the results came back to determine that the inflection and word choice recalled by the listeners concluded that emotional words, phrases, and sounds are more memorable than neutral speakers.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a <b>group</b> contest <b>is</b> analyzed, where <b>the</b> <b>groups</b> <b>are</b> {{allowed to}} {{determine}} their sharing rules either sequentially or simultaneously. It is found that in case <b>the</b> more numerous <b>group</b> determines its sharing rule prior to <b>the</b> smaller <b>group,</b> rent dissipation in <b>the</b> <b>group</b> contest <b>is</b> higher than in an individual contest. However, if the order of moves <b>is</b> endogenized, <b>the</b> smaller <b>group</b> will always act prior to <b>the</b> bigger <b>group.</b> Competition between <b>the</b> <b>groups</b> <b>is</b> in this way weakened and <b>the</b> <b>groups</b> <b>are</b> able to save on expenditures. ...|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> BA-20 <b>Group</b> <b>is</b> {{situated}} {{a few kilometers}} to {{the northeast}} of the site core and includes four platforms dating to the Late Preclassic. <b>The</b> <b>group</b> <b>was</b> already abandoned by the time Río Azul reached its maximum extent; no Early Classic remains {{have been found in}} the vicinity of BA-20. <b>The</b> <b>group</b> <b>was</b> reinhabited during <b>the</b> Late Classic, with the general repopulation of Río Azul and <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>is</b> estimated to have housed some 2500 people between the AD 692 and 830. The total area covered by <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>is</b> estimated to be 7 to 8 km2, of which mapping and test excavations covered just 0.8 km2. In the mapped area, archaeologists recorded 275 structures and 30 chultunob. Almost all of the architecture within <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>is</b> domestic in nature and the likely food-storage function of the chultunob supports the interpretation of <b>the</b> <b>group</b> as principally residential in nature.|$|R
