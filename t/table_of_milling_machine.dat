50|$|An {{indexing}} head, {{also known}} as a dividing head or spiral head, is a specialized tool that allows a workpiece to be circularly indexed; that is, easily and precisely rotated to preset angles or circular divisions. Indexing heads are usually used on the <b>tables</b> <b>of</b> <b>milling</b> <b>machines,</b> but may be used on many other machine tools including drill presses, grinders, and boring machines. Common jobs for a dividing head include machining the flutes <b>of</b> a <b>milling</b> cutter, cutting the teeth <b>of</b> a gear, <b>milling</b> curved slots, or drilling a bolt hole circle around the circumference of a part.|$|R

5000|$|A {{backplate}} with threads may screw onto a {{threaded spindle}} nose (for lathe work) or onto an adapter plate {{with the same}} nose, to be mounted on the <b>table</b> <b>of</b> <b>milling</b> <b>machines</b> or surface grinding machines. This [...] "threaded spindle nose" [...] type of mounting was the typical method in the 19th century through 1930s. It is simple and useful, but the degree of control of concentricity is not quite {{good enough to be}} foolproof for high-speed, high-precision work (high precision can be achieved, but the time and skill involved in the setups makes it a poor choice now that better options exist, such as the cam-lock spindle noses described below). Threaded spindle noses are still built on new machine tools, but only of the low-end variety (hobbyist, least-expense MRO, etc.). High-capital manufacturing (where high upfront expense yields lowest possible unit expense for mid- to high-volume part counts of high-precision parts) has moved away from this type of mounting. The exact-adjust (Set-Tru) concept is one way to chase high concentricity on threaded spindle noses with some relative degree of ease.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Increasing {{the demand}} for {{effectively}} use of the production facility requires the tools for sharing the manufacturing facility through remote operation of the machining process. This research introduces the methodology of machining technology for direct remote operation <b>of</b> networked <b>milling</b> <b>machine.</b> The integrated tools with virtual simulation, remote desktop protocol and Setup Free Attachment for remote operation <b>of</b> <b>milling</b> process are proposed. Accessing and monitoring of machining operation is performed by remote desktop interface and 3 D virtual simulations. Capability of remote operation is supported by an auto setup attachment with a reconfigurable pin type setup free technology installed on the <b>table</b> <b>of</b> CNC <b>milling</b> <b>machine</b> to perform unattended machining process.

40|$|Abstract—One of {{the main}} {{concerns}} about parallel mechanisms {{is the presence of}} singular points within their workspaces. In singular positions the mechanism gains or loses one or several degrees of freedom. It is impossible to control the mechanism in singular positions. Therefore, these positions have to be avoided. This is a vital need especially in computer controlled machine tools designed and manufactured on the basis of parallel mechanisms. This need has to be taken into consideration when selecting design parameters. A prerequisite to this is a thorough knowledge about the effect of design parameters and constraints on singularity. In this paper, quality condition index was introduced as a criterion for evaluating singularities of different configurations of a hexapod mechanism obtainable by different design parameters. It was illustrated that this method can effectively be employed to obtain the optimum configuration of hexapod mechanism with the aim of avoiding singularity within the workspace. This method was then employed to design the hexapod <b>table</b> <b>of</b> a CNC <b>milling</b> <b>machine.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Unwanted {{vibration}} in <b>machine</b> tools like <b>milling,</b> lathe, grinding <b>machine</b> {{is one of}} {{the main}} problem as it affects the quality of the machined parts, tool life and noise during machining operation. Hence these unwanted vibrations are needed to be suppressed or damped out while machining. Therefore the present work concentrates and aims on study of different controllable parameter that affect the responses like vibration amplitude and roughness of machined part. The part to be machined is kept on sandwich of plates made up of polymer and composite material. The sandwich along with the part to be machined, fixed on the slotted <b>table</b> <b>of</b> horizontal <b>milling</b> <b>machine.</b> The parameters that can easily be controlled are feed, RPM of cutter, depth of cut, and number of plates that form the secondary bed material. Polymers like Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC), Polypropylene (PP) plates and composites like Glass Fiber Polyester and Glass Fiber Epoxy (GFE) plates are used in the experiments to form the sandwich (secondary bed material) on which work-piece (MS Plate) was mounted and fed to the milling cutter. Four holes are made on the specimen and the plates to ensure that the sandwich of plate including the work-piece can be bolted to the slotted table. Common up-milling operation was carried out in controlled manner. Vibration signals were recorded on the screen of phosphorous storage oscilloscope and surface roughness of machined plate was found from the Talysurf. Finite element analysis (FEA) was carried out to know the resonance frequencies at which the structure should not be excited. In the course of the FEA some important facts have come up that lead to set some of the steps of precautions during the experimentation. Response surface methodology (RSM) is used to develop the model equation for each set of plate material. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{project is}} to {{investigate}} using the time-frequency domain analysis acoustic emission (AE) signal for the milling process. The objective of this {{project is to}} study the properties of acoustic emission signal during the machining process at different surface quality using the time frequency localization method. This thesis describes the pattern of graph that being shown from different of machining parameter. Several steps being followed {{to ensure that the}} experiment will run. First step to run the experiment is to design of experiments. Before running the experiment, the materials be facing to get parallel surface and several parameters of machining being chosen to get the variations of surface roughness. The materials will clamp at the <b>table</b> <b>of</b> the <b>milling</b> <b>machine</b> and the sensor will be placed on the materials. To remove the gaps between the sensor and the workpiece, the function of grease be used. To check whether the AE system will detect the signal, pencil break test will be done. This action can produce AE signals that like as the experiment will be run. For the cutting tools, the carbide coated cutting tools being used and for the materials using Haynes 188 as the experimental material. To get the variation of surface roughness, parameter that being selected before being used. Different parameters give different AE signal and the surface roughness also varies. When all the data collected, it can be used in manufacturing field. And the result that obtained is for the smooth the range of the Ra is about from 0. 270 Î¼m until 0. 384 Î¼m. And for the medium surface quality, it from 1. 370 Î¼m to 2. 058 Î¼m. For the rough surface, the Ra is about 6. 033 to 7. 042 Î¼m. In STFT windows, the graph looks to their pattern of the colour of the graph. From the colour at the graph, colour that more dominant shows the high value of amplitude. STFT windows are most suitable to view of the times, frequency and the amplitude of the signal and that show it the most suitable method to analyze the condition monitoring of machining...|$|R
