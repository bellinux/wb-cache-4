25|$|Both Art and Horace were very, {{very aware}} of {{what they wanted to}} do. They wanted {{to get away from the}} jazz scene of the early '50s, which was the Birdland scene—you hire Phil Woods or Charlie Parker or J. J. Johnson, <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> sit in with the house rhythm section, and they only play blues and {{standards}} that everybody knows. There's no rehearsal, there's no thought given to the audience. Both Horace and Art knew that the only way to get the jazz audience back and make it bigger than ever was to really make music that was memorable and planned, where you consider the audience and keep everything short. They really liked digging into blues and gospel, things with universal appeal. So they put together what was to be called the Jazz Messengers.|$|E
25|$|Eraserhead {{was finally}} {{finished}} in 1976, {{after five years}} of production. Lynch subsequently tried to get the film entered into the Cannes Film Festival, but while some reviewers liked it, others felt that it was awful, and so it was not selected for screening. Similarly, reviewers from the New York Film Festival also rejected it, though it was screened at the Los Angeles Film Festival, where Ben Barenholtz, the distributor of the Elgin Theater, heard about it. He was very supportive of the movie, helping to distribute it around the United States in 1977, and Eraserhead subsequently became popular on the midnight movie underground circuit, and was later described {{as one of the most}} important midnight movies of the seventies along with El Topo, Pink Flamingos, The Rocky Horror Picture Show, The Harder <b>They</b> <b>Come</b> <b>and</b> Night of the Living Dead. The acclaimed film maker Stanley Kubrick said that it was one of his all-time favorite films.|$|E
500|$|In 2004, Eraserhead was {{selected}} for preservation in the National Film Registry by the United States Library of Congress. Selection for the Registry {{is based on a}} film being deemed [...] "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant". Eraserhead was one of the subjects featured in the 2005 documentary , which charted the rise of the midnight movie phenomenon in the late 1960s and 1970s; Lynch took part in the documentary through a series of interviews. The production covers six films which are credited as creating and popularizing the genre; also included are Night of the Living Dead, El Topo, Pink Flamingos, The Harder <b>They</b> <b>Come,</b> <b>and</b> The Rocky Horror Picture Show. In 2010, the Online Film Critics Society compiled a list of the 100 best directorial débuts, listing what they felt were the best first-time feature films by noted directors. Eraserhead placed second in the poll, behind Orson Welles' 1941 Citizen Kane.|$|E

500|$|A {{reviewer}} for the The New York Dramatic Mirror stated, [...] "It {{is rather}} {{difficult to understand}} by what magic the two signatures are made {{to appear in the}} court room without human agency. <b>They</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> go in anything but legal fashion. Evidently their appearance is to be taken symbolically - not realistically." [...] The final part of the review is difficult to infer because the film is lost, but the synopsis states that a stereopticon was used. A stereopticon, {{not to be confused with}} a stereoscope, is a type of slide projector that projects an image. According to the synopsis, the production employs one, or possibly two, stereopticon's to display the two different signatures to compare and reveal the forgery. The reviewer seems to state that the appearance as unnatural, perhaps referencing a dissolve effect. The ability to project with a dissolve was a known ability of more advanced stereopticons. According to another reviewer the film included shots of Long Island Sound.|$|E
500|$|Upon release, [...] "Perfect Illusion" [...] {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from music critics. Alice Vincent of The Daily Telegraph gave the song {{four out of}} five stars, saying that it [...] "delights me to write that this is a return to 'Just Dance'-era Gaga: a simple, infectiously catchy slice of floor-filling, stadium-cheering pop". She also complimented the [...] "rich timbre" [...] of Gaga's vocals on the song, and her emoting. For Jess Denham from The Independent, [...] "Perfect Illusion" [...] sounded more rock-oriented than [...] "Just Dance" [...] or [...] "Poker Face"; she also complimented the vocals, compared the verses to work by singer Bruce Springsteen, and added that the track was [...] "as catchy as <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> sure to prove a club banger". Idolator's Robbie Daw described Gaga as a [...] "rock goddess". The [...] "dark and grungy" [...] sound of the track was relegated more towards Born This Way, rather than the songs from Artpop. Daw ended the review saying that it was a departure from Gaga's dance-pop work of her early career.|$|E

2500|$|During the debate, Congressman Paul {{commented that}} America's history of interventionism in the Middle East {{has led to}} an unpopular view of the U.S. in Middle Eastern countries, and argued that the CIA's removal of Iranian leader Mohammed Mosaddeq in Operation Ajax, the Iraq war and the bombing of Iraq in the 1990s had led to {{increasing}} anti-American sentiment in the Middle East and promoted terrorism. When the moderator asked if Paul was suggesting that the US had [...] "invited" [...] the 9/11 attacks, Paul argued with fellow candidate Rudy Giuliani, who responded to Paul's suggestion that the U.S. pay attention to the underlying causes of terrorism by saying [...] "I don't think I've heard that before, and I've heard some pretty absurd explanations for September 11. And I would ask the congressman to withdraw that comment and tell us that he didn't really mean that."

2500|$|Jones often {{displayed}} a sheepish, self-deprecating {{sense of humor}} regarding his dire financial standing and bad reputation. [...] In June 1979, he appeared with Waylon Jennings on Ralph Emery's syndicated radio program {{and at one point}} Jennings cracked, [...] "It's lonely at the top." [...] A laughing Jones replied, [...] "It's lonely at the bottom, too! [...] It's real, real lonely, Waylon." [...] Despite his chronic unreliability, Jones was still capable of putting on a captivating live show. [...] On Independence Day, 1976, he appeared at Willie Nelson's Fourth of July Picnic in Gonzales, Texas in front of 80,000 younger, country-rock oriented fans. [...] A nervous Jones felt out of his comfort zone and nearly bolted from the festival but went on anyway and wound up stealing the show. [...] The Houston Post wrote, [...] "He was the undisputed star of this year's Willie Nelson picnic...one of the greatest." [...] Penthouse called him [...] "...the spirit of country music, plain and simple, its Holy Ghost". [...] The Village Voice added [...] "As a singer he is as intelligent as <b>they</b> <b>come,</b> <b>and</b> should be considered for a spot in America's all-time top ten." [...] Jones began missing more shows than he made, however, including several highly publicized dates at the Bottom Line club in New York City. [...] Former vice president of CBS Records Rick Blackburn recalls in the 1989 video Same Ole Me that the event had been hyped for weeks, with a lot of top press and cast members from Saturday Night Live planning to attend. [...] "We'd made our plans, travel arrangements and so forth. [...] George excused himself from my office, left - and we didn't see him for three weeks. [...] He just did not show up." [...] Much like Hank Williams, Jones seemed suspicious of success and furiously despised perceived slights and condescension directed towards the music that he loved so dearly. [...] When he finally played the Bottom Line in 1980, the New York Times called him [...] "the finest, most riveting singer in country music." ...|$|E
2500|$|While most of {{the songs}} from The Leak were {{strictly}} for the street, {{it was said that}} there would be two or three that would actually go on the album with a little remixing.

In an interview with MTV T.I. said that he was actually still recording songs for King and said he'll be making music right up to the deadline. On February 6, 2006 T.I. churned out roughly 65 tracks but only selected the hottest joints. In another interview with MTV, [...] T.I. stated that [...] "the album King is like 'Trap Muzik' on steroids". [...] He also stated that everything you loved about his albums in the past has been reincarnated and hit with some nuclear sewage that made that shit mutate into something of catastrophic proportions.

2500|$|After {{the events}} in [...] "Judgment Day", the Watchers abandon all pretense of not interfering in the Game. Believing that MacLeod is {{responsible}} for the slaughter of the Watchers, Jack Shapiro, their head, orders his death and, at the beginning of [...] "One Minute To Midnight", Duncan is trying to survive their manhunt. Believing the only way to avoid a war between the Watchers and the Immortals is to convince Shapiro of his innocence, MacLeod goes to their battle headquarters, only to find that the Immortal who is the real killer has beaten him to the punch. The bitter irony of the situation is revealed - Jacob Galati is hunting the Watchers after Horton killed his Immortal wife, Irena, during his rampage across Europe in 1992 that ended when he killed Darius in Paris, ("The Hunters"). Jacob refuses to believe that the Watchers are not evil, but agrees to meet Joe, who has been nursed back to health by Methos. Joe won't meet Jacob though and helps the Watchers to capture him. Duncan is forced to stand by whilst the Watchers murder Jacob and is devastated to receive his friend's Quickening. Methos rejects Joe and the Watchers for what they have become, but MacLeod returns to confront Shapiro, {{to put an end to}} the killing. When Shapiro refuses, Joe belatedly realizes that his friend has become another Horton and helps Duncan to secure peace with the Watchers. Wanting nothing to do with Paris, Duncan returns to Seacouver. There, he finds the Immortal Cassandra waiting for him. She is being hunted by Roland Kantos, one of her students, and she tells Duncan of a [...] "Prophecy" [...] that he will defeat great evil. Kantos relies on the hypnotic power of his voice to defeat his opponents, but Duncan, after nearly losing his head to Kantos' tricks, defeats the mesmerist by plugging his ears. Joe comes to the dojo and gets the cold shoulder from Duncan, but before he leaves, he tells MacLeod that Richie is in town, ("The End Of Innocence"). Duncan tries to make his peace with Richie, but the young Immortal is still plagued by nightmares after Duncan almost killed him in [...] "Something Wicked" [...] and warns Duncan to stay away from him. When Richie challenges and kills Carter Wellan, his mentor Haresh Clay comes for Richie, breaking his sword. Richie is arrested trying to steal another one from a museum and is bailed out by Duncan, who warns him that Clay is as good as <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> gives him a sword. The two Immortals work out their differences and, now acting as equals, it is Duncan who asks Richie to stand aside as he avenges his humiliation at Clay's hands when they first met and takes his head. In [...] "Archangel" [...] Duncan accidentally kills Richie thinking he is a demon he is destined to face.|$|E
