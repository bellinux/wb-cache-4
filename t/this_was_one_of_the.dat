5|$|Along {{this route}} between New Haven and Hartford, the Hartford and New Haven Turnpike was {{chartered}} in 1798 and opened in 1799, beginning at Grove Street in New Haven and leaving on Whitney Avenue, passing via Meriden and Berlin, and entering Hartford on Maple Avenue. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first turnpikes {{to be built}} on a straight line rather than along existing roads.|$|E
5|$|Carlsen won the London Chess Classic in December {{with five}} wins (over McShane, Aronian, Gawain Jones, Adams and Judit Polgár) and three draws (against Kramnik, Nakamura and Anand). This win, {{the third time}} Carlsen had won the tournament {{in the past four}} years, {{increased}} his rating from 2848 to a new record of 2861, breaking Kasparov's 13-year record of 2851.

5|$|June 1990: The {{remnants}} of Hurricane Boris briefly caused heavy rainfall in southern California. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{reasons why it}} was the wettest June in San Diego, since record-keeping began in 1850. Despite this, less than an inch (25mm) of rain fell in most locations.|$|E
5|$|Nagumo quickly {{reversed}} {{his order}} to re-arm the bombers with general purpose bombs {{and demanded that}} the scout plane ascertain {{the composition of the}} American force.

5|$|Additional {{concerns}} are hypothyroidism, allergies, epilepsy, diabeties and glandular disorders which may cause baldness. The hair loss occurs at around {{six months of}} age, affecting the neck, thighs and tail; however the frequency has been reduced through work conducted by the breed clubs. Hip dysplasia is seen in around 8.3% of the breed, according to surveys conducted by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals over a twenty five-year period between 1974 and 1999. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lower results of the sporting breeds, with Greyhounds coming lowest with 3.4%, and the related Boykin Spaniel coming in second highest at 47%. There {{was no evidence of}} elbow dysplasia found. The breed has an average life span of 1013 years.|$|E
5|$|Another {{element of}} the Commonwealth army {{consisted}} of various private armies fielded by the most powerful magnates. In time of peace these consisted of usually small regiments {{of a few hundred}} men, but at their extreme they could number up to 10,000, including cavalry and artillery. In some instances the magnate contribution could surpass that of the main Commonwealth army on the frontlines, although often the magnates preferred to save their troops, as they were not compensated for the state for their contributions. The troops were paid for and equipped by the richest of the noble families, such as the Opaliński, Lubomirski, Potocki, Ossoliński, Zamoyski, Koniecpolski, Sieniawski, Żółkiewski, Sapieha, Chodkiewicz, Pac and Radziwiłł families. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reasons why the magnates {{played a major role in}} Polish politics, and on occasion, allowed them to engage in bloody civil wars (such as the Lithuanian Civil War in 1700) amongst themselves.|$|E
5|$|By a 5–4 margin, {{the justices}} {{reversed}} the conviction, agreeing that Jacobson had been entrapped, on April 6, 1992. It {{has since been}} reported that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rare cases where the decision changed after arguments. The original poll of the justices showed a 7–2 majority for affirmance, with only White and Stevens holding out. But White argued persuasively for reversal to his fellow Justices, and Blackmun and Clarence Thomas, who had replaced Marshall, changed their minds. It {{has been suggested that}} Thomas, who later established a reputation for allowing wide latitude to law enforcement similar to other contemporary Republican appointees, was especially sensitive at that time to Jacobson's situation due to the sexual harassment allegations raised by Anita Hill during his own recent confirmation hearings.|$|E

5|$|Carlsen won the {{category}} 21 Nanjing Pearl Spring tournament, 2½ points ahead of second-place finisher Topalov, the world's highest-rated player at the time. He scored an undefeated 8/10, winning every game as white (against Topalov, Wang Yue, Leko, Teimour Radjabov, and Dmitry Jakovenko), and also winning as black against Jakovenko. By rating performance, <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> greatest results in history, with a PR of 3002.

5|$|Coal {{measures}} {{appear in}} the Radstock district, and surrounding Somerset Coalfield (largely concealed by Triassic and newer rocks). There are two series of coal-bearing sandstones and shales separated by Pennant Sandstone. Locally the beds are folded and faulted. There were mines in the Radstock and Nailsea areas but these have closed. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first areas {{in the world to}} undergo systematic geological study and mapping by John Strachey and William Smith in the 18th century. They observed the rock layers, or strata, which led Smith {{to the creation of a}} testable hypothesis, which he termed the Principle of Faunal Succession.|$|E
5|$|De la Ferté {{was highly}} {{critical}} of the Air Ministry's attitude to his service. In 1937 several exercises were carried out by Coastal Command in co-operation with submarines against the Home Fleet to judge the surface fleet's defence against submarine and air attack. However, despite the experiences of the First World War, no attention was paid to the problem of attacking submarines from the air as part of trade protection measures. Owing to misplaced faith in the imperfect ASDIC invention which was never intended to detect surface-running submarines, it appeared the Royal Navy no longer considered U-boats a threat to Britain's sea lanes. The Air Ministry, keen to concentrate on strategic air forces, did not dispute the Admiralty's conclusions and Coastal Command did not receive any guidance from the Air Ministry. The saving grace for both services was the construction of the Combined Headquarters which enabled rapid collaboration in maritime operations. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> few successes in organisation and preparation made before the outbreak of war.|$|E

5|$|Details of Carol's death were {{revealed}} in the post mortem. There were severe injuries to the skull, and {{it was said that}} her face had been smashed by multiple blows. It was later found in court that the murder weapon had been an ice axe. The body was found to be in a foetal position, which suggested that the body had been dealt with within a few hours of death, before rigor mortis could settle in. It has since been said that the investigators failed to acknowledge that rigor mortis passes in a 24‑to48‑hour time period, and that the body could feasibly have been trussed once rigor mortis had passed. Many unusual knots were used to tie the body, and the same knots were said to be used in Gordon Park's house and boat. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> key pieces of evidence used against Gordon in the trial.|$|E
5|$|During the war, Hammond {{spent much}} of his leave with Ness-Harvey in South Africa. In 1945, she {{followed}} him back to England, but did not like it. When Hammond left to tour Australia in 1946–47, Ness-Harvey remained behind with his mother, with whom she did not get along. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> factors which led to Hammond's problems on the tour. His divorce went through, and on his return, he and Sybil married at Kingston Register Office. She had already changed her name to Hammond by deed poll. Their first child, Roger, was born in 1948. Carolyn was born in 1950 and Valerie was born in 1952.|$|E

The case was so popular that the involved barristers found it physically difficult to get into the court each day due to the size of the crowds gathered outside.

5|$|In 1717, {{the dark}} {{pigmentation}} of a postmortem spleen and brain {{was published by}} the epidemiologist Giovanni Maria Lancisi in his malaria text book De noxiis paludum effluviis eorumque remediis. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earliest reports of the characteristic {{enlargement of the spleen}} and dark color of the spleen and brain which are the most constant post-mortem indications of chronic malaria infection. He related the prevalence of malaria in swampy areas to the presence of flies and recommended swamp drainage to prevent it.|$|E
5|$|In 1932 and 1933, the {{scientists}} at the Cavendish Laboratory {{made a series of}} ground-breaking discoveries.

Then Chadwick devised an experiment that discovered a new, uncharged particle with roughly the same mass as the proton: the neutron. In 1933, Blackett discovered tracks in his cloud chamber that confirmed the existence of the positron and revealed the opposing spiral traces of positron–electron pair production.|$|E
