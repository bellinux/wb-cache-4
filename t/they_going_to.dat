It was like, 'Oh my God, oh my God, I hope I did the right thing. Oh, that scene is too long. Oh, that's too short. Are <b>they</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> get this part? Are <b>they</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> like this? Oh, they're going to think it's boring!' Just {{worrying}} the whole way, biting my fingernails off.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} on The John and Ken Show on KFI, Headley {{was asked if he}} experienced retaliation from Scientology for speaking critically about the organization. He said that he had been issued a declaration that he was to be considered a [...] "Suppressive Person" [...] by members of the organization, and explained, [...] "That's basically the thing that goes out to anyone and everyone who is in Scientology, saying, 'This person is a Suppressive Person, and you can no longer speak to him ever again.' If you are in Scientology, and you speak to somebody who is a Suppressive Person, you yourself can be declared a Suppressive Person." [...] Headley said when he left Scientology the organization gave him a [...] "freeloader statement", a bill for US$62,000, for courses he had received in Scientology. [...] "It's actually illegal, because they are basically charging me for on-the-job training – in California you can't charge somebody for on-the-job training. It's of no real value, but you don't know that, when you're in Scientology. You think, 'Are <b>they</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> garnish my wages, are <b>they</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> sue me?' You don't know," [...] said Headley.|$|E
500|$|Stephen also {{expressed}} her {{desire for the}} character's departure from the show and asked [...] "When are <b>they</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> dispense with this hopeless character?" [...] During the storyline involving Robin and Sunny, Stephen commented [...] "Is she about to disappear into the sunset with someone else? No such luck. Looks like we're {{still going to have}} to pay a dingo to carry her off." [...] Following Sunny's departure, Stephen said [...] "The relief at Erinsborough becoming a Sunny-free zone is enormous".|$|E
6000|$|In {{an instant}} the whole hideous, {{incredible}} truth flashed wildly across my bewildered brain. <b>They</b> were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> sacrifice Kea to this hateful god! <b>They</b> were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> fling {{her into the}} mouth of the crater! <b>They</b> were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> offer her up in marriage to the son of Pélé! ...|$|R

500|$|Even {{though the}} episode aired during the {{beginning}} of the fifth season, it was produced by the crew of the fourth season. A large part of the original crew left the show after season four. This led to the addition of several scenes, which normally would not have been considered, because the mentality of the departing crew was [...] "what are <b>they</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do, get us fired?" [...] Although most of the episode was completed by the staff of season four, the end was rewritten by the team of season five.|$|E
500|$|Kate Mulgrew {{suggested}} that the show incorporate a new and stronger antagonist, saying: [...] "We need [...] to encounter enemies of such ferocity, enemies who in fact are quite lethal and frightening. Enemies that you would watch and say, 'Oh, boy, how are <b>they</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{get out of this}} one?' I don't think the Kazon hit the bill." [...] Mulgrew felt the crew's mission to get home was a more compelling storyline than those related to the Kazon, whom she criticized as [...] "great big stupid giants".|$|E
500|$|Father Ernest Sugule, {{national}} {{coordinator of the}} Congolese non-governmental organization SAIPD in Dungu, DRC, claimed that the few people there [...] "who have succeeded in watching [...] are very critical on the film," [...] as is he himself. Charlie Beckett, a media communications expert at the London School of Economics (LSE), said Invisible Children ,"haven't got the capacity for is to take that beyond another action. What are <b>they</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do with all this energy and interest? It's going to dissipate. ... I think this will crash and die, I don't think they will catch Kony. People will say they bought the bracelet and stuck posters on lamppost but that could have negative effects when it doesn't actually lead anywhere." ...|$|E

500|$|Ian Champeau, an Ojibway man in Ottawa, Ontario, filed a {{human rights}} {{complaint}} against the Nepean Redskins Football Club {{on behalf of his}} five-year-old daughter {{in an effort to get}} the team to change its name. [...] "How are <b>they</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> differentiate the playing field from the school yard? What's going to stop them from calling my daughter a redskin in the school yard? That's as offensive as using the n-word." [...] Assembly of First Nations National Chief Shawn Atleo said he supports the move because the word Redskin is [...] "offensive and hurtful and completely inappropriate. The team was changed to the [...] "Nepean Eagles", chosen from 70 suggestions submitted. Niigaan Sinclair (Anishinaabe), a writer and assistant professor at the University of Manitoba, applauded the decision and contrasted it to the decision of Daniel Snyder, the Washington team owner.|$|E
500|$|When {{people did}} confess to even a minor {{role in the}} rioting, such as {{throwing}} a few stones, they were charged with affray. One resident told the 1986 Gifford Inquiry into the rioting: [...] "You would go to bed and you would just lie there and you would think, are <b>they</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> come and kick my door, what's {{going to happen to}} my children?... It was that horrible fear that you lived with day by day, knowing they could come and kick down your door and hold you for hours." [...] The inquiry heard that 9,165 police officers were either deployed on the estate or held in reserve between 10 and 14 October 1985. Thus, argues Rose, the police created, or at least intensified, a climate of fear in which witnesses were afraid to step forward.|$|E
500|$|Musically, [...] "All In My Head (Flex)" [...] fuses reggae and pop with trap music. The song {{is three}} minutes and thirty-seconds {{in length and}} samples the song [...] "Flex" [...] by Jamaican DJ Mad Cobra which itself {{interpolated}} elements of The Temptations' [...] "Just My Imagination". Its instrumentation consists of guitar, percussion, synthesized finger snaps and synths creating an electronic-reggae beat. The song opens with Hansen singing the chorus featuring guitar chords and crisp clicks. Following the rap performed by Fetty Wap, Ally Brooke belts out [...] the first verse: [...] "Curtains like waves closing in all around us, dimming the lights just so that they don't blind us," [...] backed by the percussion and guitar chords. Concerning his collaboration on [...] "All in My Head (Flex)", Fetty Wap told Billboard that during the recording, his voice [...] "wasn't as mature as it is now." [...] And described as [...] "impossible" [...] to performed the song on stage. [...] "Like, I smoke way too much now. No more high-range. If you were actually to hear the first version to that song, I do not sound anything like that. It was way high up there. So when we changed everything I was like I don't think <b>they</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> like it because it felt like I took the energy from it. But they were like we love it, we rocking with it." [...] He expressed.|$|E

500|$|Tomb Raider was {{critically}} acclaimed. In a 'world exclusive' review, GamesMaster magazine {{gave the}} game {{a score of}} 90%, {{as well as the}} [...] "GamesMaster Gold award" [...] (awarded to games that manage a score of 90% or above). The editor regarded the quality of the visuals, the length and depth of the gameplay, and the [...] "spectacular" [...] last third of the game as the highlights. The summary said [...] "sitting back exhausted we were left with just one question dribbling forth from our gaping jaws. How on earth are <b>they</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> top this in the sequel? Because of one thing there can be no doubt. Lara is back." [...] IGN's Keza MacDonald also spoke extremely positively, stating that they felt the game was [...] "exciting" [...] and [...] "beautifully presented", included [...] "great characterization" [...] and [...] "more depth than you would expect". They gave the game an overall score of 9.1 out of 10, the highest score they have given a game in the series since 1996's Tomb Raider, describing it as [...] "amazing" [...] and concluding that the game [...] "did justice" [...] to both the character and franchise. Ryan Taljonick of GamesRadar lauded the location's setting and environment, and expressed that [...] "not one area ever feels like a rehash of another". Taljonick also felt that the game had great pacing, and that it is [...] "unrivaled by any other game in the genre". Furthermore, the reviewer considered Lara's character development as [...] "an integral part" [...] of the whole game's experience, and concluded that Tomb Raider [...] "is a fantastic game and an excellent origin story for one of gaming's original treasure seekers". Australian TV show Good Game praised the game: it was rated 10/10 by both hosts, becoming the eighth game in the show's seven-year run to do so. Giant Bomb gave the game four stars out of five, stating that [...] "Tomb Raiders tone is somewhat at odds with its action, but the reborn Lara Croft seems primed for a successful new adventuring career".|$|E
2500|$|Todd and Marty's {{relationship}} became {{based on}} a psychiatrist/patient dynamic and not something physical. When asked if romance could be a possibility, Carlivati stated, [...] "I'd like to watch it unfold a beat at a time, a day at a time, {{a week at a}} time and not have the audience jump to, 'Are <b>they</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> kiss? Are <b>they</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> fall in love? Are <b>they</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> sleep together?' The goal is more to take these two characters who have an unbelievable, dark history with each other and explore where it would or could go if they didn't have that obstacle [...] the rape [...] between them." [...] However, Carlivati said that this obstacle would always be there and that the audience would see close moments. These close moments include Todd helping Marty walk and physical contact between the two while he nurses her back to health. [...] "I think the thing about the two of them, the characters and the actors, is you feel a chemistry when they're just talking, so I don't necessarily categorize it as romantic," [...] stated Carlivati. [...] "They're definitely forming a relationship and it continues to grow and build through the fall." ...|$|E
2500|$|A radio {{newscast}} {{reported on}} the Chicago Tribune's scoop of the [...] "confession," [...] which Heirens heard in his cell.

State's Attorney Tuohy also absolutely denied that Heirens had made a confession.|$|E

5000|$|The Nazis {{entered this}} war under the rather childish {{delusion}} that <b>they</b> were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> bomb everybody else, {{and nobody was}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> bomb them.

One of the Argentine officers came along and actually struck one of the guards and told us to stand up. We stood up and he shook my hand and a few other guys' hands and said that we shouldn't lie down, that we should be proud of what we'd done." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hoggard was {{considered}} a scapegoat for his sudden falling out of favour the England and Wales Cricket Board. [...] "We've had the same problems with the ECB since I started international cricket," [...] {{he wrote in his}} book. [...] "There were people slagging them off when I first came in and there are people still slagging them off. [...] And it's not the ECB who pick the side anyway.

2500|$|Weeks later, on 10 April, Franklin {{wrote to}} Crick for {{permission}} to see their model. Franklin retained her scepticism for premature model building even after seeing the Watson-Crick model, and remained unimpressed. She {{is reported to have}} commented, [...] "It's very pretty, but how are <b>they</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> prove it?" [...] As an experimental scientist, Franklin seems to have been interested in producing far greater evidence before publishing-as-proven a proposed model. As such, her response to the Watson-Crick model was in keeping with her cautious approach to science. Most of the scientific community hesitated several years before accepting the double helix proposal. At first mainly geneticists embraced the model because of its obvious genetic implications.|$|E

Most of the passengers on the ship are Germans, returning to their fatherland at a time when millions of other Germans {{are looking for ways to}} escape." [...] In a scene noted by Spoto as an example, a Nazi passenger is [...] "barking inanities" [...] about how Germans should purify their race, to which a German-Jewish passenger responds, [...] "There are nearly a million Jews in Germany.

2500|$|Fifty {{motions to}} reopen divorce cases {{that had been}} handled by Garson were {{received}} by New York's chief administrative judge for matrimonial cases. Of those, three or four were granted a hearing, and eventually settled. However, even in cases that involved both Garson and Siminovsky, rulings were not necessarily reviewed or overturned. To receive a hearing, parties were required to demonstrate some likelihood {{that they had not}} received a fair trial. Criticizing a process that required parties who did not have subpoena powers or wiretaps to prove corruption in each case, the President of the New York State chapter of the National Organization for Women said: [...] "The burden of proof is going to fall on them to show the case is corrupted; and how are <b>they</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do that?" ...|$|E

All of the buildings have got to touch at the ground. We then devised this system and it had an absolutely firm principle: it had a great spine down the middle where everybody walked. That led everywhere. The cars were on the outside, on both sides. When you came into the spaces things were square, they were rectangular courtyards and they were all slightly different. There were two or three essentials: one was that the covered way had to be continuous, the buildings had to be three or four storeys high and connecting to the next one. I thought it worked very well." ...|$|E
