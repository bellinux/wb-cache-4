Through exten-sive field studies, we observed that they often build and share custom tools for specific tasks that are not supported by vendor tools. Recent trends toward web-based manage-ment consoles offer many advantages but put an extra bur-den on system administrators, as customization requires web programming, which is beyond the skills of many sys-tem administrators. To meet their needs, we developed A 1, a spreadsheet-based environment with a task-specific sys-tem-administration language for quickly creating small tools or migrating existing scripts to run as web portlets.

Although thousands of QTL regions {{have been identified}} in livestock species, most of them are large and contain many genes. This tool was there-fore {{designed to}} assist the characterization of genes in a QTL interval region as a step towards selecting the best candidate genes.

Both human gen-ome and mouse genome can be aligned with the studied region to detect synteny and segment con-servation, which is useful for running inter-species comparisons of QTL locations.

5000|$|On June 8, 1524, the conquerors {{arrived in}} the {{neighborhood}} of Acajutla at a village called Acaxual. There, according to records, a battle ensued between the opposing armies, with the Nahuat wearing cotton armor (of three fingers' thickness, according to Alvarado) and carrying long lances. This circumstance would be crucial in the progression of the battle. Alvarado approached the Pipil lines with his archers' showers of crossbow arrows, but the natives did not retreat. The conquistador noticed the proximity of a nearby hill and knew that it could be a convenient hiding place for his opponents. Alvarado pretended that his army had given up the battle and retreated. The Pipils suddenly rushed the invaders, giving Alvarado an opportunity to inflict massive losses. The Pipils that fell to the ground could not get back on their feet, hindered by the weight of their cotton armor, which enabled the Spanish to slaughter them. Decimated, the Nahuat forces retreated to reassemble further along his route. In a second battle a few days later, the remaining formal Cuscatlan army again assembled on the battlefield but was finally defeated. In the words of Alvarado: [...] "...the destruction was so great <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> short time none were left alive...".|$|R

The direct address to the camera turns a reporter from an anonymous bearer of information into the “main star”.
