Night Springs is a fictional television show in Alan Wake, and is the setting of said show. On 10 November, a short teaser trailer was unveiled. During {{the days leading up}} to the publication of the first screenshot, Remedy employees made a number of comments on the official Alan Wake community forums about the new game. It was shared that the new title is [...] "structured like a full release complete with a pretty damn impressive storyline that expands the originals in some interesting ways." [...] Although no specifics were revealed, Remedy responded to fans who were worried that being an Xbox Live Arcade game meant that the amount of content in the game would be too small. Remedy claimed that there will definitely be enough [...] "value for money" [...] for the players of the game, and that fans [...] "will be blown away by the proportion of things pretty soon".|$|E

2500|$|Prominent {{evolutionary}} biologists such as Richard Dawkins and Jerry Coyne {{have proposed}} various [...] "controversies" [...] {{that are worth}} teaching, instead of intelligent design.

Dennett, author of Darwin's Dangerous Idea, describes how they generate a sense of controversy: [...] "The proponents of intelligent design use an ingenious ploy that works something like this: First you misuse or misdescribe some scientist's work. Then you get an angry rebuttal. Then, instead of dealing forthrightly with the charges leveled, you cite the rebuttal as evidence that there is a 'controversy' to teach." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{promotion}} {{of research to}} make screening programs find ever more cancers is also criticized. One-third of diagnosed breast cancers might recede on their own. In addition to efficiently finding most deadly cancers, screening programs also find most non-life-threatening, asymptomatic breast cancers and pre-cancers, and miss some fast growing, aggressive, dangerous cancers. According to H. Gilbert Welch of the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice, [...] "I'm certainly not asking anyone to stop getting mammograms.

2500|$|Rather than a {{grand jury}} hearing, {{authorities}} held a probable cause hearing {{to determine whether or}} not to bring Simpson to trial. This was a minor victory for Simpson's lawyers, because it would give them access to evidence as it was being presented by the prosecution in contrast to procedure in {{a grand jury}} hearing. After a week-long court hearing, California Superior Court Judge Kathleen Kennedy-Powell ruled on July 7 that there was sufficient evidence to bring Simpson to trial for the murders. At his second arraignment on July 22, when asked how he pleaded to the murders, Simpson, breaking a courtroom practice <b>that</b> <b>says</b> <b>the</b> accused may plead using only the words [...] "guilty" [...] or [...] "not guilty," [...] firmly stated: [...] "Absolutely, one hundred percent, not guilty." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Guyer, {{the first}} line says that once {{the speaker of the}} sonnets is dead there should be no {{mourning}}, but it is phrased in such a way <b>that</b> <b>says</b> <b>the</b> mourning is happening now, at a point in life and living. Guyer's interpretation focuses heavily on time and the importance of that time used for mourning. In the line there is a limit of time being set aside for mourning, only in life, but after life has ended the mourning must stop. The line ends in dead, finality, giving the false sense that the sentence is over and yet it continues through to the second line. The second line gives the brief time between life {{and the sound of the}} bell to mourn and it seems to contradict {{the first line}}. The sonnet seems to be firmly against mourning after death, but really it is for mourning the dead but only in a timely manner. [...] "The sonnet's first-person subject demands that mourning—even if it lasts only for one minute or one day—coincides with, rather than succeed, the death knell that will [...] "Give warning to the world that I am fled." ...|$|E

I still like the little word if it says the thing I want to say as well as the big one, but I honor above all the word <b>that</b> <b>says</b> <b>the</b> thing. At the same time I confess that I have a prejudice against certain words that I cannot overcome; the sight of some offends me, the sound of others, and rather than use one of those detested vocables, even when I perceive that it would convey my exact meaning, I would cast about long for some other.

60|$|Here I must guard myself {{against a}} misunderstanding. It {{is not the}} fault of their authors that the long string of wanton's tragedies, from Antony and Cleopatra to Iris, are snares to poor girls, and are objected to on that account by many earnest {{men and women who}} {{consider}} Mrs Warren's Profession an excellent sermon. Mr Pinero is in no way bound to suppress the fact that his Iris is a person to be envied by millions of better women. If he made his play false to life by inventing fictitious disadvantages for her, he would be acting as unscrupulously as any tract writer. If society chooses to provide for its Irises better than for its working women, it must not expect honest playwrights to manufacture spurious evidence to save its credit. The mischief lies in the deliberate suppression of {{the other side of the}} case: the refusal to allow Mrs Warren to expose the drudgery and repulsiveness of plying for hire among coarse, tedious drunkards; the determination not to let the Parisian girl in Brieux's Les Avaries come on the stage and drive into people's minds what her diseases mean for her and for themselves.
