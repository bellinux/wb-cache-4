5|$|Henry {{responded by}} {{mounting}} campaigns against the rebel barons and deepening his alliance with Theobald. Baldwin of Flanders {{was wounded in}} battle and died in September 1118, easing the pressure on Normandy from the north-east. Henry attempted to crush a revolt {{in the city of}} Alençon, but was defeated by Fulk and the Angevin army. Forced to retreat from Alençon, Henry's position deteriorated alarmingly, as his resources became overstretched and more barons abandoned his cause. Early in 1119, Eustace of Breteuil and Henry's daughter, Juliana, threatened to join the baronial revolt. Hostages were exchanged in a bid to avoid conflict, but relations broke down and both sides mutilated their captives. Henry attacked and took the town of Breteuil, despite Juliana's attempt to kill her father with a crossbow. In the aftermath, Henry dispossessed <b>the</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> almost all of their lands in Normandy.|$|E
5|$|Unlike a {{significant}} number of registered breeds today, a horse cannot be registered as a Thoroughbred (with The Jockey Club registry) unless conceived by live cover, the witnessed natural mating of a mare and a stallion. Artificial insemination (AI) and embryo transfer (ET), though commonly used and allowable in many other horse breed registries, cannot be used with Thoroughbreds. One reason is that a greater possibility of error exists in assigning parentage with AI, and although DNA and blood testing eliminate many of those concerns, AI still requires more detailed record keeping. The main reason, however, may be economic; a stallion has a limited number of mares who can be serviced by live cover. Thus the practice prevents an oversupply of Thoroughbreds, although modern management still allows a stallion to live cover more mares in a season than was once thought possible. As an example, in 2008, the Australian stallion Encosta De Lago covered 227 mares. By allowing a stallion to cover only a couple of hundred mares a year rather than <b>the</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> thousand possible with AI, it also preserves the high prices paid for horses of the finest or most popular lineages.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: We report <b>the</b> palladium-catalyzed <b>coupling</b> <b>of</b> {{aryl halides}} with ammonia and gaseous amines as their {{ammonium}} salts. <b>The</b> <b>coupling</b> <b>of</b> aryl chlorides and ortho-substituted aryl bromides with ammonium sulfate forms anilines with higher selectivity {{for the primary}} arylamine over the diarylamine than couplings with ammonia in dioxane. The resting state for the reactions of aryl chlorides {{is different from the}} resting state for the reactions of aryl bromides, and this change in resting states is proposed to account for a difference in selectivities for reactions of the two haloarenes. The transition-metal-catalyzed amination of aryl electro-philes has become a useful method to construct arylamines. However, <b>the</b> <b>coupling</b> <b>of</b> ammonia is less developed than <b>the</b> <b>coupling</b> <b>of</b> alkylamines, and several properties <b>of</b> ammonia make <b>the</b> <b>coupling</b> <b>of</b> this reagent more challenging than <b>the</b> <b>coupling</b> <b>of</b> alkylamines. Ammonia is a good σ-donor and binds more strongly to metals than do alkylamines, and this binding can lead to catalyst deactivation. In addition, the moderate basicity and low acidity of ammonia disfavor proton exchanges to or from thi...|$|R

25|$|Even before Ukraine became {{independent}} in August 1991, {{political parties in}} Ukraine started to form around intellectuals and former Soviet dissidents. They posed the main opposition to the ruling Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of Ukraine (CP(b)U). At the first convocation of the Verkhovna Rada those parties formed the parliamentary opposition People's Council. The most noticeable parties of the parliamentary opposition included the People's Movement of Ukraine (The Movement) and the Ukrainian Republican Party. Due to the August Putsch in Moscow (19–21 August 1991), a process to prohibit communist parties in Ukraine took place. Led by Oleksandr Moroz, the parliamentary faction of the CP(b)U, Group of 239, started a process to re-form the CP(b)U into the Socialist Party of Ukraine. The restriction {{on the existence of}} communist parties in Ukraine was successfully adopted soon after the Ukrainian independence, however in <b>the</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> years the resolution was later challenged and eventually the restriction was lifted. In 1993 in Donetsk the first congress of the reinstated Communist Party of Ukraine took place, with the Party led by Petro Symonenko.|$|E
25|$|Dido was {{followed}} by The Îles of St Tropez (1860), Fair Rosamond (1862) and The Deal Boatman (1863), among many others. His most memorable early success was another musical burlesque, Ixion, or the Man at the Wheel (1863), starring Lydia Thompson in the title role, which found audiences {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic. By this time Burnand was a skilled negotiator with theatre managements, and he was among the first authors to insist on profit-sharing instead of fixed royalties. For Ixion this brought him a total of around £3,000. Other notable early works included an opéra bouffe, Windsor Castle (1865), with music by Frank Musgrave, and more pun-filled burlesques, including Helen, or, Taken from the Greek, and Guy Fawkes, or The Ugly Mug and <b>the</b> <b>Couple</b> <b>of</b> Spoons, both in 1866. Later in 1866 Burnand had a huge success with the burlesque The Latest Edition of Black-Eyed Susan; or, the Little Bill that Was Taken Up, parodying the three-act melodrama by Douglas Jerrold, Black-Eyed Susan; the show ran for 400 nights at the Royalty Theatre, was played for years provincially and in the US, and was twice revived in London.|$|E

Design: The concentration of ITI heavy chains bound to hyaluronan was determined by a two-step electrophoretic technique. Synovial fluid, TSG- 6 depleted synovial fluid and metal chelated synovial fluid were tested {{for their ability to}} support <b>the</b> <b>coupling</b> <b>of</b> ITI heavy chains to hyaluronan. Results: When synovial fluid was mixed with an ITI-source (serum or purified ITI), <b>coupling</b> <b>of</b> ITI heavy chains to hyaluronan took place.

EDTA inhibited <b>the</b> <b>coupling</b> activity, but combinations of the metal-ion chelators Mg-EGTA and Ca-EGTA demonstrated, that Ca++is essential for <b>the</b> <b>coupling</b> <b>of</b> ITI heavy chains to hyaluronan.

25|$|Layton and Chow {{were also}} the subject of some dispute when a June 14, 1990, Toronto Star article by Tom Kerr accused them of unfairly living in a housing {{cooperative}} subsidized by the federal government, despite their high income. Layton and Chow had both lived in the Hazelburn co-op since 1985, and lived together in an $800 per month three-bedroom apartment after their marriage in 1988. By 1990, their combined annual income was $120,000, and in March of that year they began voluntarily paying an additional $325 per month to offset {{their share of the}} co-op's Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation subsidy, the only members of the co-op to do so. In response to the article, the co-op's board argued that having mixed-income tenants was crucial to the success of co-ops, and that the laws deliberately set aside apartments for those willing to pay market rates, such as Layton and Chow. During the late 1980s and early 1990s they maintained approximately 30% of their units as low income units and provided the rest at what they considered market rent. In June 1990, the city's solicitor cleared <b>the</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> any wrongdoing, and later that month, Layton and Chow left the co-op and bought a house in Toronto's Chinatown together with Chow's mother, a move they said had been planned for some time. Former Toronto mayor John Sewell later wrote in NOW that rival Toronto city councillor Tom Jakobek had given the story to Tom Kerr.|$|E
