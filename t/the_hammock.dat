5|$|The {{plant growth}} around <b>the</b> <b>hammock</b> base is nearly impenetrable; beneath the canopy hammocks {{is an ideal}} habitat for animals. Reptiles (such as various species of snake and anole) and {{amphibians}} (such as the American green tree frog, Hyla cinerea), live in the hardwood hammocks. Birds such as barred owls (Strix varia), woodpeckers, northern cardinals (Cardinalis cardinalis), and southern bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) nest in hammock trees. Mammal species living in hardwood hammocks include opossums (Didelphis virginiana), raccoons (Procyon lotor), bobcats (Lynx rufus), Everglades minks (Neovison vison), marsh rabbits (Sylvilagus palustris), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), and the rare, critically endangered Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi).|$|E

50|$|A {{post office}} called Wrightsville was {{established}} in 1881. Wrightsville Beach is composed of two islands that are separated by two different bodies of water. Bradley Creek runs between the mainland and <b>the</b> <b>Hammocks</b> (currently known as Harbor Island). <b>The</b> <b>Hammocks</b> are then separated from the beach by Banks Channel. In the 1700 and 1800’s <b>the</b> <b>Hammocks</b> were accessible by a footbridge from the mainland and by boat. The beach itself was only accessible by boat.|$|R
25|$|Orthalicus reses reses snails {{are entirely}} {{arboreal}} except {{when they move}} to the forest floor for nesting or traveling. Hammocks that contain well-developed soils or leaf litter are important for nesting activity and dispersal. Essential factors affecting food availability are the light intensity and moisture content of <b>the</b> <b>hammock</b> habitat.|$|E
25|$|No {{data are}} {{available}} on minimal hammock size needed to support a viable population of tree snails. Suitable habitat would have to include an area large enough to provide for foraging and nesting requirements, {{as well as provide}} for the microclimate (air temperature and humidity) needed by the Orthalicus reses reses. Preferences for edge or interior hammock have been observed in Liguus populations on Lignumvitae Key. Age-class differences were seen where older individuals were found in the central mature hammock, while younger individuals were found more often along the edges of <b>the</b> <b>hammock.</b> Tuskes (1981) suggested this may be an adaptation of younger snails to move to the edge to escape competition from older snails. It is not known whether Orthalicus reses reses prefer interior or edge hammock areas. Recent surveys of snails in the Key Largo populations have shown higher numbers of snails along the edge of <b>the</b> <b>hammock</b> than in the interior, but this result may be affected by the differences in visibility during surveying.|$|E
25|$|The Seminoles led by Alligator, Sam Jones, and the {{recently}} escaped Coacoochee, were well positioned in a hammock surrounded by sawgrass. The ground was thick mud, and sawgrass easily cuts and burns the skin. Taylor had about 800 men, while the Seminoles numbered less than 400. Taylor sent the Missouri volunteers in first. Colonel Richard Gentry, three other officers {{and more than}} twenty enlisted men were killed before the volunteers retreated. Next in were 200 soldiers of the 6th Infantry, who lost four officers and suffered nearly 40% casualties before they withdrew. Then it was {{the turn of the}} 4th Infantry, 160 men augmented by remnants of the 6th Infantry and the Missouri volunteers. This time the troops were able to drive the Seminoles from <b>the</b> <b>hammock</b> and towards the lake. Taylor then attacked their flank with his reserves, but the Seminoles were able to escape across the lake. Only about a dozen Seminoles had been killed in the battle. Nevertheless, the Battle of Lake Okeechobee was hailed as a great victory for Taylor and the Army.|$|E

2500|$|In 1978 Dade County leased {{the land}} from the State of Florida and began making plans {{to turn it into}} a passive {{recreation}} facility. Clean-up crews appeared, and construction started on a small museum and nature study center. A nature trail was constructed in <b>the</b> <b>hammock</b> area by the Youth Conservation Corps. In addition, they planted over 500 trees. The Arch Creek Park was formally dedicated on April 25, 1982. Today, Arch Creek is an [...] site at the junction of N.E. 135th Street and Biscayne Boulevard, and offers many opportunities for botanical, historical and archaeological study. It has a museum/nature center modeled after an early Florida pioneer home, displaying Indian artifacts dug from the grounds, and live animals from the nearby hammock. Remains of the original coontie mill are still visible across the creek, and the Park exists as the only preserved archaeological site in the County.|$|E
2500|$|L'Homme au hamac, also {{referred}} to as Man in a Hammock, is a painting created in 1913 by the French artist, theorist and writer Albert Gleizes. The work was exhibited at Moderni Umeni, SVU Mánes, Vystava, Prague, February – March 1914, no. 41; and Der Sturm, Berlin, July – August 1914. The painting was reproduced in Guillaume Apollinaire, Paris-Journal, July 4, 1914 (published again in Chroniques d'Art, 1960. p.405); and Albert Gleizes, L'Épopée, Le Rouge et le Noir, October 1929, p.81. Stylistically Gleizes' painting exemplifies the principle of mobile perspective laid out in Du [...] "Cubisme", written by himself and French painter Jean Metzinger. Evidence suggests that the man reclining in <b>the</b> <b>hammock</b> is indeed Jean Metzinger. Formerly in the collection of Metzinger, the first owner of the painting, Man in a Hammock forms part of the permanent collection of the Albright-Knox Art Gallery, Buffalo, New York.|$|E

He showed off what he had brought back from his voyage to the monarchs, including a few small samples of gold, pearls, gold jewelry stolen from natives, a few natives he had kidnapped, flowers, and a hammock. He gave the monarchs a few of the gold nuggets, gold jewelry, and pearls, as well as the previously unknown tobacco plant, the pineapple fruit, the turkey, and <b>the</b> <b>hammock.</b> The monarchs invited Columbus to dine with them. A taster even tasted the food from each of his dishes before he ate to [...] "make sure it was not poisoned." [...] He was given his own footmen to open doors for him and to serve him at the table. Columbus was even rewarded with his own coat of arms. He did not bring any of the coveted East Indies spices, such as the exceedingly expensive black pepper, ginger or cloves. In his log, he wrote [...] "there is also plenty of 'ají', which is their pepper, which is more valuable than black pepper, and all the people eat nothing else, it being very wholesome". The word [...] "ají" [...] is still used in South American Spanish for chili peppers.|$|E
