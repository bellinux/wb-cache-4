5|$|By {{the middle}} of the century, <b>the</b> <b>palette</b> had {{expanded}} to include red, black, green, yellow, and gray which signifies different aspects of the earth as defined by different locations of the reservation. Navajo used indigo to obtain shades from pale blue to near black and mixed it with indigenous yellow dyes such as the rabbit brush plant to obtain bright green effects. Red was the most difficult dye to obtain locally. Early Navajo textiles use cochineal, an extract from a Mesoamerican beetle, which often made a circuitous trade route through Spain and England {{on its way to the}} Navajo. Reds used in Navajo weaving tended to be raveled from imported textiles. The Navajo obtained black dye through piñon pitch and ashes.|$|E
5|$|MacPaint uses two offscreen memory buffers {{to avoid}} flicker when {{dragging}} shapes or images across the screen. One of these buffers contained the existing pixels of a document, {{and the other}} contained the pixels of its previous state. The second buffer {{was used as the}} basis of the software's undo feature. In April 1983, the software's name was changed from MacSketch to MacPaint. The original MacPaint was programmed as a single-document interface. <b>The</b> <b>palette</b> positions and sizes were unalterable, as was the document window. This was different from other Macintosh software at the time, which allowed the users to move windows and resize them.|$|E
5|$|The {{graphic design}} {{was decided to}} be {{modelled}} from those of cartoons, and a goal was to have two thousand character animations. Another artist was hired to complete the graphics on time, and the team ultimately ended up with four. Fellow artist Andy Bass had difficulty getting the Kit-Kat graphics correct. He {{said they did not}} have the right colour, so Carr tweaked <b>the</b> <b>palette.</b> Bass modelled the vending machine that would use the Kit-Kat graphics and used 3D Studio to render it into the game palette, which he then edited using Deluxe Paint. By spring 1996, around half of the illnesses and animations were complete, the introduction and cutscenes were mostly complete, and the programming of the management system was almost finished. By early 1997, all that was left was refining the difficulty levels.|$|E
5000|$|Many of <b>the</b> <b>palettes</b> {{were found}} at Hierakonpolis, a centre of power in pre-dynastic Upper Egypt. After the {{unification}} of <b>the</b> country, <b>the</b> <b>palettes</b> ceased {{to be included in}} tomb assemblages.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the oldest}} {{examples}} of the prisoner(Man) hieroglyph is found on <b>the</b> predynastic <b>palette,</b> <b>the</b> Battlefield <b>Palette.</b> As some of <b>the</b> <b>palettes</b> involved animals, hunting, and weapons, captives were taken and displayed. Since the prisoners are shown, battles are implied. <b>The</b> famous Libyan <b>Palette</b> shows towns or districts, surrounded by enclosures, presumed walled fortifications, against outside forces or people.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Battlefield <b>Palette</b> (also {{known as}} <b>the</b> Vultures <b>Palette,</b> <b>the</b> Giraffes <b>Palette,</b> or <b>the</b> Lion <b>Palette)</b> may be <b>the</b> {{earliest}} battle scene {{representation of the}} dozen or more ceremonial or ornamental cosmetic palettes of ancient Egypt. Along with the others in this series of <b>palettes,</b> including <b>the</b> Narmer <b>Palette,</b> it includes {{some of the first}} representations of the figures, or glyphs, that became Egyptian hieroglyphs. Most notable on <b>the</b> Battlefield <b>Palette</b> is <b>the</b> standard (iat hieroglyph), and Man-prisoner hieroglyph, probably the forerunner that gave rise to the concept of the Nine Bows (representation of foreign tribal enemies).|$|R
25|$|Shorter code lengths can be {{used for}} {{palettes}} smaller than the 256 colors in the example. If <b>the</b> <b>palette</b> is only 64 colors (so color indexes are 6 bits wide), the symbols can range from 0 to 63, and the symbol width can be taken to be 6 bits, with codes starting at 7 bits. In fact, the symbol width need not match <b>the</b> <b>palette</b> size: as long as the values decoded are always less than the number of colors in <b>the</b> <b>palette,</b> the symbols can be any width from 2 to 8, and <b>the</b> <b>palette</b> size any power of 2 from 2 to 256. For example, if only the first four colors (values 0 to 3) of <b>the</b> <b>palette</b> are used, the symbols can be taken to be 2 bits wide with codes starting at 3 bits.|$|E
25|$|At first, {{the chair}} was {{available}} in three colors: greige, elephant-hide gray, and parchment. <b>The</b> <b>palette</b> of colors was later expanded. After that, a choice of several possible bases was offered.|$|E
25|$|GIF is palette-based: {{the colors}} {{used in an}} image (a frame) in the file have their RGB values defined in a palette table that can hold up to 256 entries, and {{the data for the}} image refer to the colors by their indices (0–255) in <b>the</b> <b>palette</b> table. The color {{definitions}} in <b>the</b> <b>palette</b> can be drawn from a color space of millions of shades (224 shades, 8 bits for each primary), but the maximum number of colors a frame can use is 256. This limitation seemed reasonable when GIF was developed because few people could afford the hardware to display more colors simultaneously. Simple graphics, line drawings, cartoons, and grey-scale photographs typically need fewer than 256 colors.|$|E

25|$|The {{invention}} of new synthetic pigments in the 18th and 19th centuries considerably brightened and expanded <b>the</b> <b>palette</b> of painters. J.M.W. Turner experimented {{with the new}} cobalt blue, and of the twenty colours most used by the Impressionists, twelve were new and synthetic colours, including cobalt blue, ultramarine and cerulean blue.|$|E
25|$|The {{encoding}} {{process that}} produces the 9-bit codes is shown below. A local string accumulates pixel color numbers from <b>the</b> <b>palette,</b> with no output action {{as long as the}} local string {{can be found in a}} code table. There is special treatment of the first two pixels that arrive before the table grows from its initial size by additions of strings. After each output code, the local string is initialized to the latest pixel color (that could not be included in the output code).|$|E
25|$|Blue {{gradually}} {{returned to}} court fashion in the 17th century, {{as part of}} a palette of peacock-bright colours shown off in extremely elaborate costumes. The modern blue business suit has its roots in England {{in the middle of the}} 17th century. Following the London plague of 1665 and the London fire of 1666, King Charles II of England ordered that his courtiers wear simple coats, waistcoats and breeches, and <b>the</b> <b>palette</b> of colours became blue, grey, white and buff. Widely imitated, this style of men's fashion became almost a uniform of the London merchant class and the English country gentleman.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Fish <b>palettes</b> of predynastic Egypt {{are one of}} {{the common}} types of <b>the</b> zoomorphic <b>palettes,</b> which are shaped {{in the form of the}} animal portrayed. <b>The</b> fish <b>palettes</b> are mostly ovoid in shape.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Zoomorphic <b>palette</b> {{is a type}} of Cosmetic <b>palette</b> {{made during}} <b>the</b> predynastic period of Egypt. <b>The</b> <b>palettes</b> are found at burial sites, for example Abydos {{in the second half of}} the 4th {{millennium}} BC.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>palettes</b> {{probably}} date {{mostly from}} the Naqada III (ca. 3300-3100 BC), i.e. late predynastic period, around 3100 BC. The two major pieces of <b>the</b> Battlefield <b>Palette</b> are held by the British and Ashmolean Museums.|$|R
25|$|By 1962, {{she begins}} using bright colors and allude to floral and plant-like shapes. These works are compositionally similar to her {{monochrome}} images {{due to their}} large size and rhythmic nature with no central focal point. <b>The</b> <b>palette</b> of these images often contrast one another and allude to tropical landscapes or plants. She continued working in this style until she suffered an aneurysm, fell, and broke her right wrist in 1963, the wrist she used to paint with. Since she still wanted to work, she painted {{with her left hand}} instead. To overcome working with her non-dominant hand, she often would directly apply paint from a tube to the canvas rather than using a brush, causing there to be large patches of white canvas on the surfaces of the images. The gesture and the physicality of these works is more restrained since she is working with her left hand.|$|E
25|$|The Côtes de Provence AOC {{is a large}} noncontiguous wine {{region that}} covers over 85 communes in the eastern region of Provence. The {{boundaries}} of the region extend from the alpine hills near Draguignan to the coast of Saint-Tropez. The noncontiguous parts of the region include land southeast of <b>the</b> <b>Palette</b> AOC and {{on the outskirts of}} the Bandol and Cassis wine area. The mountainous terrain near Villars-sur-Var in the northeast part of the area includes vineyards that can label their wine as Côtes de Provence. The region accounts for nearly 75% of all the wine production in Provence with rosé accounting for around 80% of the production. While the number is rising, about 15% of wine production is red wine with the remaining 5% white. The main grape varieties are Carignan, Cinsaut, Grenache, Mourvèdre and Tibouren with an increase in the use of the use of Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah. To improve quality, producers limit the amount of Carignan used in their rosé and red wine production, using the maximum of 40% permitted in the wine and mandating that at least 60% of the blend be composed of Grenache, Cinsaut, Mourvèdre and Tibouren. There is also an AOC requirement that at least 20% of the rosé must be blended from wine produced by the saignee method of maceration.|$|E

50|$|During the 1st Dynasty of the Old Kingdom, {{cemetery}} plots {{dating from}} the reign of Pharaoh Den were built. This resulted in one of <b>the</b> ceremonial cosmetic <b>palettes</b> of predynastic times being interred. <b>The</b> cosmetic <b>palette</b> {{is one of the}} more ornate examples, <b>the</b> Manshiyat Ezzat <b>Palette.</b> It contains <b>the</b> twin lion serpopards, as found on <b>the</b> famous Narmer <b>Palette,</b> <b>the</b> cosmetic eyepaint mixing circle, and some mammals endemic to Egypt. Many of <b>the</b> cosmetic <b>palettes</b> of Ancient Egypt were found in the Saqqara area cemeteries to the south.|$|R
50|$|A rope {{appears to}} encircle, or {{is at least}} part of the entire reverse, as one of the reverse motifs. The {{remaining}} piece-(of this Bull Palette) has possibly one of the more important motifs preserved in <b>the</b> <b>palettes</b> corpus. Five standards are shown collectively on <b>the</b> <b>palettes</b> right, and each is an iat standard (hieroglyph), but notably the base of each standard transforms into a 'clenched hand', which embraces the large-diameter encircling rope.|$|R
500|$|Bolland envisaged the {{flashback}} sequences {{in black}} and white, and instructed Watchmen-colorist John Higgins to use [...] "muted November colors". He was upset {{when he saw the}} finished comic had [...] "garish... hideous glowing purples and pinks... and my precious Eraserhead-esque flashback sequences swamped in orange." [...] The 2008-published 20th anniversary edition of the book featured new colouring by Bolland, restoring his artistic intentions to <b>the</b> <b>palette.</b>|$|E
500|$|The soundtrack was {{composed}} by Hudson Mohawke.

Ubisoft teamed up with Dutch music producer Oliver Heldens to influence the video for his track [...] "Good Life" [...] in the vein of DedSec. For acquiring licensed songs, an agreement was made with Amoeba Music. Mohawke's soundtrack was released separately as Ded Sec – Watch Dogs 2 (Original Game Soundtrack) via Warp Records.|$|E
500|$|Design firm Sarofsky {{once again}} {{worked on the}} film's main-on-end title {{sequence}}, having done the same for Winter Soldier. The sequence used [...] "muted and mottled, burnt umber and steel blue and cold grey" [...] colors, which were stark contrasts to the sequences for Winter Soldier and The First Avenger (the later created by Method Design) which were [...] "a minimalist graphic approach, reducing the key players to silhouettes and paring <b>the</b> <b>palette</b> down to three colors" [...] and [...] "vibrant and iconic propaganda art comes to life, enticing the viewer to join the fray", respectively. Creative director Erin Sarofsky noted {{one of the challenges}} for Civil Wars sequence was [...] "to make it feel like a Captain America title sequence and not an Avengers sequence" [...] given the number of characters in the film.|$|E

500|$|The {{art world}} {{developed}} a new appreciation for Velázquez's less Italianate paintings after 1819, when FerdinandVII opened the royal collection to the public. In 1879 John Singer Sargent [...] painted a small-scale copy of Las Meninas, and in 1882 painted a homage to the painting in his The Daughters of Edward Darley Boit, while the Irish artist Sir John Lavery chose Velázquez's masterpiece {{as the basis for}} his portrait The Royal Family at Buckingham Palace, 1913. GeorgeV visited Lavery's studio during the execution of the painting, and, perhaps remembering the legend that PhilipIV had daubed the cross of the Knights of Santiago on the figure of Velázquez, asked Lavery if he could contribute to the portrait with his own hand. According to Lavery, [...] "Thinking that royal blue might be an appropriate colour, I mixed it on <b>the</b> <b>palette,</b> and taking a brush he [...] applied it to the Garter ribbon." ...|$|E
500|$|Isabelle Stengers {{wrote that}} [...] "Whiteheadians are {{recruited}} among both philosophers and theologians, and <b>the</b> <b>palette</b> has been enriched by practitioners {{from the most}} diverse horizons, from ecology to feminism, practices that unite political struggle and spirituality with the sciences of education." [...] Indeed, in recent decades attention to Whitehead's work has become more widespread, with interest extending to intellectuals in Europe and China, and coming from such diverse fields as ecology, physics, biology, education, economics, and psychology. [...] One of the first theologians to attempt to interact with Whitehead's thought was the future Archbishop of Canterbury, William Temple. In Temple's Gifford Lectures of 1932-1934 (subsequently published as [...] "Nature, Man and God"), Whitehead {{is one of a}} number of philosophers of the emergent evolution approach Temple interacts with. However, it was not until the 1970s and 1980s that Whitehead's thought drew much attention outside of a small group of philosophers and theologians, primarily Americans, and even today he is not considered especially influential outside of relatively specialized circles.|$|E
500|$|The three DVD volumes {{released}} by Media Blasters were reviewed by Anime News Network. In {{the review of}} the first DVD, the reviewer commented, [...] "The series' skillful juggling of different characters' viewpoints puts the audience in a position to sympathize strongly with each one. Director Nobuaki Nakanishi guides the emotional content with a light, gentle touch—wisely forgoing extensive internal monologues, speeches, and emotional outbursts. Instead, he draws you in with soft, effortlessly evocative visuals and a simple, beautifully understated score, relying on subtly shifting facial expressions and meaning-laden actions to communicate the quietly affecting emotional states of his characters." [...] For the second DVD volume, Theron Martin commented, [...] "Every element of the production, from the style of the artistry to <b>the</b> <b>palette</b> of colors used to the soundtrack, contributes wonderfully to {{the look and feel of}} the original story, and the anime script not only exactly duplicates many scenes from the manga but also does everything in its power to stay true to the spirit of the original writing." [...] Finally, for the third volume, Carl Kimlinger wrote [...] "...the writers make an ill-advised attempt to remove the [...] "bitter" [...] from [...] "bittersweet" [...] by tacking on some decidedly unconvincing plot developments ...it isn't as awful as it could have been. The third volume of Kashimashi...creat a deeply satisfying conclusion with all of the vicarious emotional thrills you could possibly want." ...|$|E

50|$|Before {{the output}} is {{effectively}} made, the program must realize its logical palette: the system tries to match then the logical colors with physical ones. If an intended color is already present into <b>the</b> system <b>palette,</b> <b>the</b> system internally maps both the logical and <b>the</b> system <b>palette</b> indexes (due to they rarely coincide). If the intended color {{is not present}} yet, the system applies an internal algorithm to discard the least used color in <b>the</b> system <b>palette</b> (generally, some used by another window in the background) and substitutes it with the new color. Due to there are limited room for colors in <b>the</b> system <b>palette,</b> <b>the</b> algorithm tries also to remap similar colors together, and always by avoiding redundant colors.|$|R
50|$|On 13 May 2006, {{upon the}} {{entry into service}} of a new section between <b>Palettes</b> and Lancy-Pont-Rouge, <b>the</b> ring link was completed, {{and with it the}} first phase of the network's expansion. The new ring link section {{facilitated}} the extension of line 15 and line 17 to Palettes and Bachet, respectively. From the day the ring link was completed, the four tram lines operating on it, lines 12, 13, 15 and 17, no longer terminated there, but changed their numbers at designated stops: line 12 became line 17 at the Bachet stop, and line 13 became line 15 at <b>the</b> <b>Palettes</b> stop. In 2009, there was another alteration in the way the lines serviced the ring link: line 12 began switching to line 15 at <b>the</b> <b>Palettes</b> stop, line 13 started to reverse at <b>the</b> <b>Palettes</b> loop and line 17 was redirected to turn around at the Lancy-Pont-Rouge loop.|$|R
