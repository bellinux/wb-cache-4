5|$|O'Malley {{obtained}} commitments {{from over}} 80 prospective Park Grill investors, {{including some of}} Mayor Daley's friends and neighbors. Each share of the restaurant cost investors $200,000. Among <b>the</b> <b>investors</b> are Daley's friend Fred Barbara, a nephew of the late Chicago Alderman Fred Roti. Barbara has ties to the Hired Truck Program scandal and the blue bag recycling controversy. Other investors include relatives of Daley's political adviser Timothy Degnan, two neighbors of the mayor, Ray Chin, an O'Hare Airport contractor, and Rick Simon, a controversial figure who runs a janitorial business {{and sits on the}} board of the Chicago Convention and Tourism Bureau. Also among <b>the</b> <b>investors</b> was Daley's cousin Theresa E. Mintle, then the Chicago Transit Authority’s director of governmental affairs and former congressman Morgan F.

50|$|Finally, an {{investor}} might speculate on an entity's credit quality, since generally CDS spreads increase as credit-worthiness declines, and decline as credit-worthiness increases. <b>The</b> <b>investor</b> might therefore buy CDS protection on {{a company to}} speculate that it is about to default. Alternatively, <b>the</b> <b>investor</b> might sell protection if it thinks that the company's creditworthiness might improve. <b>The</b> <b>investor</b> selling <b>the</b> CDS is viewed as being “long” on the CDS and the credit, as if <b>the</b> <b>investor</b> owned <b>the</b> bond. In contrast, <b>the</b> <b>investor</b> who bought protection is “short” on the CDS and the underlying credit.|$|R
5|$|As its losses jeopardized the bank's capital position, UBS quickly raised US$11.5billion {{of capital}} in December 2007, US$9.7billion of {{which came from}} the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation (GIC) and US$1.8billion from an unnamed Middle Eastern investor.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the role of}} liability for past environmental contamination in the privatization processes of Central and Eastern Europe. The theoretical section establishes a link between a risk-averse investor’s amount of information regarding the extent of past environmental contamination (and its cleanup costs) and <b>the</b> <b>investor’s</b> willingness {{to pay for a}} particular enterprise, i. e., bid. As <b>the</b> <b>investor</b> obtains a more precise estimate of the uncertain cleanup costs, <b>the</b> <b>investor</b> faces less risk; therefore, <b>the</b> <b>investor’s</b> risk premium falls and <b>the</b> <b>investor’s</b> bid rises.

5|$|After {{his service}} as governor, Wilkinson {{returned}} to his business pursuits. In the early 1990s, he began borrowing money to keep his bookstore business solvent and to support his lavish lifestyle. His interest in running for another non-consecutive term as governor appeared to be dampened by the system of public financing that Kentucky had in place at that time for gubernatorial elections. In 1995, he published his memoir entitled You Can't Do That, Governor!; a major theme of the book was his disdain for conventional wisdom and political norms. In 1999, he launched ECampus.com, an Internet book retailer. Among <b>the</b> <b>investors</b> in the company were Wendy's founder Dave Thomas, Long John Silver's founder James Patterson, and Ohio State University president William English Kirwan.|$|E

50|$|An {{investor}} {{who wishes to}} be entitled to the dividend does not have to wait until after the record date to sell the stock; however, <b>the</b> <b>investor</b> must hold <b>the</b> stock until the ex-dividend date.

5|$|Conceived as {{an unusual}} {{combination}} of a large church surmounted by a hotel, construction of the building brought architectural dispute. Initially designed by Timothy L. Pflueger in the Gothic Revival style, <b>the</b> <b>investors</b> fired his firm and hired Lewis P. Hobart, who changed little of Pflueger's design. In a resulting lawsuit, Pflueger won nearly half the damages he asked for. The building opened in 1930 as the William Taylor Hotel and Temple Methodist Episcopal Church. However, extra construction expenses had put the congregation at greater financial risk, and the church-hotel concept did not prove popular. No profit was made in six years, and the church left, losing their investment. In the late 1930s the building housed the Empire Hotel, known for its Sky Room lounge, then from World War II to the 1970s, 100 McAllister served as U.S. government offices.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, in 1996 {{the games}} {{industry}} was rocked {{by the news}} that TSR had run into insoluble financial problems and had been bought by Wizards of the Coast. While WotC was busy refocussing TSR's products, Christopher Clark of Inner City Games Designs approached Gygax in 1997 {{to suggest that they}} produce some adventures to sell in game stores while TSR was otherwise occupied; the result was a pair of fantasy adventures published by Inner City Games: A Challenge of Arms (1998) and The Ritual of the Golden Eyes (1999). Gygax introduced some investors to Clark's publication setup, and although <b>the</b> <b>investors</b> were not willing to fund publication of Legendary Adventures, Clark and Gygax formed a partnership called Hekaforge Productions. Gygax was thus able to return to publish Lejendary Adventures in 1999. The game was published as a three-volume set: The Lejendary Rules for All Players (1999), Lejend Master's Lore (2000) and Beasts of Lejend (2000).|$|E
5|$|Phips and {{the crew}} were rewarded by <b>the</b> <b>investors</b> with medals, and Phips was knighted by James in June. James also rewarded Phips with the post of provost marshal general (chief sheriff) of the Dominion of New England, serving under Sir Edmund Andros. In September 1687 Phips {{returned}} to the wreck, {{though he did not}} command the venture. Admiral Narborough elected to personally lead the expedition, but it was not nearly as successful. The wreck had been discovered by others, and the arrival of the English scattered more than 20 smaller ships. Treasure worth £10,000 was recovered before Narborough's death in May 1688 brought the expedition to an end. Phips had by then already left the wreck site in early May, sailing for Boston for what seems to have been his first time home in four and a half years, to take up his new post as provost marshal general.|$|E

5|$|Rogers {{came from}} an {{affluent}} seafaring family, grew up in Poole and Bristol, and served a marine apprenticeship to a Bristol sea captain. His father held shares in many ships, but he died when Rogers was in his mid-twenties, leaving Rogers {{in control of the}} family shipping business. In 1707, Rogers was approached by Captain William Dampier, who sought support for a privateering voyage against the Spanish, with whom the British were at war. Rogers led the expedition, which consisted of two well-armed ships, Duke and Duchess, and was the captain of Duke. In three years, Rogers and his men went around the world, capturing several ships in the Pacific Ocean. En route, the expedition rescued Selkirk, finding him on Juan Fernandez Island on 1 February 1709. When the expedition returned to England in October 1711, Rogers had circumnavigated the globe, while retaining his original ships and most of his men, and <b>the</b> <b>investors</b> in the expedition doubled their money.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea of a}} new Waldorf-Astoria {{hotel was}} based on the concept {{that there should be a}} large opulent hotel in New York for {{distinguished}} visitors. Financial backing was not difficult to get in the summer of 1929 as times were prosperous; the stock market had not yet crashed nor had the Depression arrived. However, before ground was broken for the new building, some of <b>the</b> <b>investors</b> became dubious about whether this was the right time to be investing in a luxury hotel. The land for the new hotel was formerly owned by the New York Central Railroad, who had promised $10 million toward the building of the new Waldorf-Astoria. The railroad and all the other investors decided to honor their commitments and take their chances with the uncertain financial climate.|$|E
5|$|The Kinect, a motion-sensing {{input device}} made by Microsoft and {{designed}} as a video game controller, was first introduced in November 2010, and was upgraded for the 2013 release of the eighth-generation Xbox One video game console. Kinect's capabilities were revealed in May 2013. The new Kinect uses an ultra-wide 1080p camera, which can function in the dark due to an infrared sensor. It employs higher-end processing power and new software, can distinguish between fine movements (such as a thumb movements), and can determine a user's heart rate by looking at his/her face. Microsoft filed a patent application in 2011 that suggests that the corporation may use the Kinect camera system to monitor the behavior of television viewers {{as part of a}} plan to make the viewing experience more interactive.

40|$|Abstract: The {{literature}} on venture financing mainly focuses on entrepreneurial moral hazard. <b>The</b> <b>investor,</b> however, may behave opportunistically, too. We {{look at the}} case where <b>the</b> <b>investor</b> demands a higher share on the venture’s return before financing the next stage. Possibly, the staging of capital is the most salient feature of venture financing. The entrepreneur {{may be forced to}} accept <b>the</b> <b>investor’s</b> offer, when she is supposed to lose something by changing <b>the</b> <b>investor.</b> For instance, if the property rights on the invention are not sufficiently protected − because the entrepreneur has not filed for a patent or the invention does not meet the legal requirements for patent protection − <b>the</b> <b>investor</b> may use <b>the</b> idea for his own purposes once the entrepreneur terminates the relationship. This threat may force the entrepreneur to continue although <b>the</b> <b>investor</b> demands a higher share. As a consequence, she sticks with <b>the</b> <b>investor,</b> however, she may not choose the efficient level of specific investments, rather she underinvests. The impact of patent law is important.
