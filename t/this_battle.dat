5|$|<b>This</b> <b>battle</b> {{occurred}} on September 21–22, 1864. General Sheridan considered <b>this</b> <b>battle</b> {{a continuation of}} the Battle of Opequon near Winchester. General Early's Confederate army was pursued from Winchester to Fisher's Hill, where the rebels had strong fortifications and an advantageous location given the terrain. The 2nd West Virginia Cavalry regiment was still part of the 2nd Brigade led by Colonel Powell, who reported to General Averell. In <b>this</b> <b>battle,</b> the regiment initially engaged in some skirmishing while dismounted—the terrain made it difficult to fight while mounted.|$|E

5|$|On 16 December, the SLA {{launched}} a multi-front offensive against Kilinochchi. This assault {{was defeated by}} the LTTE, who claimed that SLA casualties in <b>this</b> <b>battle</b> were 130 soldiers dead and more than 300 wounded. They also claimed to have captured 28 bodies of army soldiers. However, the SLA denied this and claimed to have had only 25 soldiers killed, 18 missing and 160 wounded while they killed 120 Tigers. Heavy artillery and mortar fire was exchanged between both sides during the battle.

5|$|USSOCOM's 10th Special Forces Group, {{elements}} of JSOC and CIA/SAD Paramilitary Officers linked {{up again and}} {{were the first to}} enter Iraq prior to the invasion. Their efforts organized the Kurdish Peshmerga to defeat Ansar Al Islam in Northern Iraq before the invasion. <b>This</b> <b>battle</b> was for control of a territory in Northeastern Iraq that was completely occupied by Ansar Al Islam, an ally of Al Qaeda. This was a very significant battle and led to the termination of a substantial number of terrorists and the uncovering of a chemical weapons facility at Sargat. These terrorists {{would have been in the}} subsequent insurgency had they not been eliminated during <b>this</b> <b>battle.</b> Sargat was the only facility of its type discovered in the Iraq war. <b>This</b> <b>battle</b> may have been the Tora Bora of Iraq, but it was a sound defeat for Al Qaeda and their ally Ansar Al Islam. This combined team then led the Peshmerga against Saddam's northern Army. This effort kept Saddam's forces in the north and denied the ability to redeploy to contest the invasion force coming from the south. This effort may have saved the lives of hundreds if not thousands of coalition service men and women.|$|E

5|$|Although the Japanese Army's {{attack on}} the Allied Lunga {{perimeter}} was decisively defeated in <b>this</b> <b>battle,</b> the Japanese were {{not yet ready to}} give up the struggle for Guadalcanal.

5|$|As {{a result}} of the Japanese air attacks on the task force, one U.S. heavy cruiser was sunk, a {{destroyer}} was heavily damaged, {{and the rest of the}} U.S. task force was forced to retreat from the southern Solomons area. Partly because they turned back the U.S. task force in <b>this</b> <b>battle,</b> the Japanese successfully evacuated their remaining troops from Guadalcanal by 7 February 1943, leaving it in the hands of the Allies and ending the battle for the island.|$|E
