5|$|Back in London Emmeline {{was visited}} by Sylvia, {{who had not}} seen her mother in years. <b>Their</b> <b>politics</b> were by now very different, and Sylvia was living, unmarried, with an Italian anarchist. Sylvia {{described}} a moment of familial affection when they met, followed by a sad distance between them. Emmeline's adopted daughter Mary, however, remembered the meeting differently. According to her version, Emmeline set her teacup down and walked silently out of the room, leaving Sylvia in tears. Christabel, meanwhile, had become a convert to Adventism and devoted {{much of her time}} to the church. The British press sometimes made light of the varied paths followed by the once indivisible family.|$|E
5|$|At this time, private loyalty-review {{boards and}} anti-communist {{investigators}} {{began to appear}} to fill a growing demand among certain industries to certify that their employees were above reproach. Companies that {{were concerned about the}} sensitivity of their business, or who, like the entertainment industry, felt particularly vulnerable to public opinion made use of these private services. For a fee, these teams would investigate employees and question them about <b>their</b> <b>politics</b> and affiliations. At such hearings, the subject would usually not have a right to the presence of an attorney, and as with HUAC, the interviewee might be asked to defend himself against accusations without being allowed to cross-examine the accuser. These agencies would keep cross-referenced lists of leftist organizations, publications, rallies, charities and the like, as well as lists of individuals who were known or suspected communists. Books such as Red Channels and newsletters such as Counterattack and Confidential Information were published to keep track of communist and leftist organizations and individuals. Insofar as the various blacklists of McCarthyism were actual physical lists, they were created and maintained by these private organizations.|$|E
5|$|I was {{of course}} happy to meet the Hizbullah people, {{because it is a}} point of view that is rarely heard in the United States. I have no problem saying that I do want to express {{solidarity}} with them, and I am {{not going to be a}} coward of (sic) a hypocrite about it. I don't care about Hizbullah as a political organization. I don't know much about <b>their</b> <b>politics,</b> and anyhow, it's irrelevant. I don't live in Lebanon. It's a choice that the Lebanese have to make: Who they want to be their leaders, who they want to represent them. But there is a fundamental principle. People have the right to defend their country from foreign occupiers, and people have the right to defend their country from invaders who are destroying their country. That to me is a very basic, elementary and uncomplicated question.|$|E

25|$|The {{movement}} of people between the adjacent islands of Ireland and Great Britain has ebbed and flowed with <b>their</b> <b>politics,</b> economics and social conditions. Ireland was a feudal Lordship of the Kings of England between 1171 and 1541; a Kingdom in personal union with the Kingdom of England and Kingdom of Great Britain between 1542 and 1801; and politically united with Great Britain as the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland between 1801 and 1922.

25|$|The Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church {{was granted}} autocephaly by Pope Joseph II of Alexandria, {{head of the}} Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria in 1950. At that time Eritrea was a {{separate}} colonial territory under British administration, but nevertheless the Orthodox Church in Eritrea was simply made {{a division of the}} Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, as the British had no interest to strongly separate the Eritrean highlands from the Ethiopian highlands, corresponding to <b>their</b> <b>politics</b> of unification of the highlands (with the option of separation of the Muslim lowlands of Eritrea and their inclusion into the British Sudan).|$|E
25|$|Urechia grew {{disillusioned with}} National Liberal politics, and voted against his party {{when he felt}} that <b>their</b> <b>politics</b> no longer coincided with his own views. By 1885, he also made his peace with Junimea, which was {{generally}} offering its support to the newly founded Conservative Party, and became a collaborator of its mouthpiece Convorbiri Literare, contributing essays and stories until 1892. Also in 1885, he published his novella Logof. Baptiste Veleli ("The Logofăt Baptiste Veleli"), set in the 17th century. His varied scientific interests led him to correspond with Iuliu Popper, the Romanian-born explorer of Patagonia, who notably described to Urechia the lawlessness of Punta Arenas, Chile.|$|E

25|$|Both as an {{adolescent}} {{and as a}} young man, Spencer {{found it difficult to}} settle to any intellectual or professional discipline. He worked as a civil engineer during the railway boom of the late 1830s, while also devoting much of his time to writing for provincial journals that were nonconformist in their religion and radical in <b>their</b> <b>politics.</b> From 1848 to 1853 he served as sub-editor on the free-trade journal The Economist, during which time he published his first book, Social Statics (1851), which predicted that humanity would eventually become completely adapted to the requirements of living in society with the consequential withering away of the state.|$|E
25|$|Until 1920, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, {{later the}} founder of Pakistan, {{was a member of}} the Indian National Congress and was part of the {{independence}} struggle. Muhammad Iqbal, poet and philosopher, was a strong proponent of Hindu–Muslim unity and an undivided India, perhaps until 1930. Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy was also active in the Indian National Congress in Bengal, during his early political career. Mohammad Ali Jouhar and Shaukat Ali struggled for the emancipation of the Muslims in the overall Indian context, and struggled for independence alongside Mahatma Gandhi and Abdul Bari of Firangi Mahal. Until the 1930s, the Muslims of India broadly conducted <b>their</b> <b>politics</b> alongside their countrymen, in the overall context of an undivided India.|$|E
25|$|The endogamous caste of Azza (or Aza) among Toubou {{have the}} artisanal occupations, such as metal work, leather work, salt mining, well digging, dates farming, pottery and tailoring, {{and they have}} {{traditionally}} been despised and segregated by other strata of the Toubou, much like the Hadahid caste in southeastern Chad among the Zaghawa people. According to Paul Lovejoy – a professor of African History, the 19th century records show that these segregated Toubou castes followed the same customs and traditions {{as the rest of}} the Toubou, but they were independent in <b>their</b> <b>politics</b> and beliefs, much like the artisan castes found in many ethnic groups of eastern Chad such as Kanembu, Yedina, Arab, Kouri and Danawa peoples.|$|E

25|$|With his new {{reputation}} as Poet of the Empire, Kipling was warmly received {{by some of}} the most influential politicians of the Cape Colony, including Rhodes, Sir Alfred Milner, and Leander Starr Jameson. Kipling cultivated their friendship and came to admire the men and <b>their</b> <b>politics.</b> The period 1898–1910 was crucial in the history of South Africa and included the Second Boer War (1899–1902), the ensuing peace treaty, and the 1910 formation of the Union of South Africa. Back in England, Kipling wrote poetry in support of the British cause in the Boer War and on his next visit to South Africa in early 1900, he became a correspondent for The Friend newspaper in Bloemfontein, which had been commandeered by Lord Roberts for British troops.|$|E
25|$|Isopescu-Grecul's mission {{came to an}} end in September 1920, when Hungary and Romania {{exchanged}} ambassadors: {{he arranged}} for Szilárd Masirevich to be recognized as the Hungarian envoy to Romania, before being himself relieved by Ambassador Traian Stârcea. In December, he began working as an adviser for the Romanian Ministry of Agriculture and Royal Domains, under Dimitrie A. Grecianu. He continued to serve as head of the liquidation committee until 1922. During the same time, he also became involved with the Bukovina wood industry, a founder (in late 1920) and Chairman of the eponymous S.A. corporation Industria Silvică din Bucovina. By 1923, he was resuming his collaboration with Maniu, hoping to draw him and the PNR into an alliance with Flondor. <b>Their</b> <b>politics</b> was aimed against the centralizing National Liberal Party and its Bukovinan allies, the Democratic Unionists.|$|E
25|$|In 1860 the Treasury {{was a small}} {{operation}} that funded the small-scale operations of the government through the low tariff and land sales. Revenues were trivial {{in comparison with the}} cost of a full-scale war, but the Treasury Department under Secretary Salmon P. Chase showed unusual ingenuity in financing the war without crippling the economy. Many new taxes were imposed, and always with a patriotic theme comparing the financial sacrifice to the sacrifices of life and limb. The government paid for supplies in real money, which encouraged people to sell to the government regardless of <b>their</b> <b>politics.</b> By contrast the Confederacy gave paper promissory notes when it seized property, so that even loyal Confederates would hide their horses and mules rather than sell them for dubious paper. Overall the Northern financial system was highly successful in raising money and turning patriotism into profit, while the Confederate system impoverished its patriots.|$|E

25|$|Periphery {{countries}} {{are those that}} exist on the outer edges of global trade. There could be many reasons for a country to be considered peripheral, such as a dysfunctional or inefficient government. For example, some nations customs and ports are so inefficient that {{even though they are}} geographically closer it is cheaper to ship goods from longer distances. Other reasons such as wars, non-central location, insufficient infrastructure (rail lines, roads and communications) will keep a country in the periphery of global trade. Generally the populations tend to be poor and destitute so the core countries will exploit them for cheap labor and will even purposely interfere with <b>their</b> <b>politics</b> to keep things this way. Usually a peripheral country will specialize in one particular industry, leaving it vulnerable to economic instability and limiting international investment. Sometimes countries decide to isolate themselves, such as 14th century China.|$|E
25|$|The Amalgamated {{solidified}} its {{gains and}} extended its power in Chicago {{through a series}} of strikes in {{the last half of the}} 1910s. The Amalgamated found it harder, on the other hand, to make gains in Baltimore, where it was able to sign an agreement with one of the largest manufacturers that, like HSM (Hart Schaffner and Marx) in Chicago, sought labor peace, it found itself at odds with an unusual alliance of UGW locals, the corrupt head of the Baltimore Federation of Labor, and the Industrial Workers of the World, who undermined the Amalgamated's strikes and attacked strikers. Complicating the picture further were the ethnic bonds between the many Lithuanian members of the IWW and the subcontractors whom the Amalgamated was trying to put out of business and the anarcho-syndicalist politics of many Lithuanian workers, who had developed <b>their</b> <b>politics</b> in opposition to czarist oppression in their homeland. The Amalgamated eventually prevailed, as the contradictions between the IWW's politics and its alliance with small contractors and the AFL eventually undercut its support among Lithuanian workers.|$|E
25|$|Round 1 – Caïna: {{this round}} {{is named after}} Cain, who killed his own brother in the first act of murder (Gen. 4:8). This round houses the Traitors to their Kindred: they have their necks and heads out of the ice and allowed to bow their heads, {{allowing}} some protection from the freezing wind. Here Dante sees the brothers Alessandro and Napoleone degli Alberti, who killed each other over their inheritance and <b>their</b> <b>politics</b> some time between 1282 and 1286. Camiscion de' Pazzi, a Ghibelline who murdered his kinsman Ubertino, identifies several other sinners: Mordred (traitorous nephew of King Arthur); Vanni de' Cancellieri, nicknamed Focaccia (a White Guelph of Pistoia who killed his cousin, Detto de' Cancellieri); and Sassol Mascheroni of the noble Toschi family of Florence (murdered a relative). Camicion is aware that, in July 1302, his relative Carlino de' Pazzi would accept a bribe to surrender the Castle of Piantravigne to the Blacks, betraying the Whites. As a traitor to his party, Carlino belongs in Antenora, the next circle down – his greater sin will make Camiscion look virtuous by comparison.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{examines}} two policy spaces—the ARC and TVA—and <b>their</b> spatialized <b>politics.</b> The research {{observes that}} the regional concept informs {{public policy and}} {{can contribute to the}} formation of stable policy initiatives. Using the subsystem framework to understand the political viability of policy regimes, the authors conclude policy geographies that appeal to traditional definitions of regions are more stable over time. In contrast, geographies that fail to reflect pre-existing representations of space are engaged in more competitive subsystem politics. The paper demonstrates that the spatial practices of policy regions and <b>their</b> directional <b>politics</b> influence the political viability of programs. The paper concludes that policy spaces should institutionalize pre-existing geographies—not manufacture new ones. T Keywords—Agenda Setting, Politics, and Region. Regions are not, however, independent actors; they exist an...|$|R
