25|$|Forestry has an {{important}} part {{to play in the}} amelioration of the conditions in semi-arid and arid lands. If properly planned, forestry can make {{an important}} contribution to the general welfare of the people living in desert areas. The living standard {{of the people in the}} desert is low. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>afford</b> other fuels like gas, kerosene etc. Fire wood is their main fuel, of the total consumption of wood about 75 percent is firewood. The forest cover in desert is low. Rajasthan has a forest area of 31150km2. which is about 9% of the geographical area. The forest area is mainly in southern districts of Rajasthan like Udaipur and Chittorgarh. The minimum forest area is in Churu district only 80km2. Thus the forest is insufficient to fulfill the needs of firewood and grazing in desert districts. This diverts the much needed cattledung from the field to the hearth. This in turn results into the decrease in agricultural production. Agroforestry model is best suited to the people of desert. Some Institutes have done good work in Agroforestry.|$|E

6000|$|When I last made a memorandum, {{we were at}} Ephesus. We are in Syria, now, encamped in the {{mountains}} of Lebanon. The interregnum has been long, both as to time and distance. We brought not a relic from Ephesus! After gathering up fragments of sculptured marbles and breaking ornaments from the interior work of the Mosques; and after bringing them at a cost of infinite trouble and fatigue, five miles on muleback to the railway depot, a government officer compelled all who had such things to disgorge! He had an order from Constantinople to look out for our party, and see that we carried nothing off. It was a wise, a just, and a well-deserved rebuke, but it created a sensation. I never resist a temptation to plunder a stranger's premises without feeling insufferably vain about it. This time I felt proud beyond expression. I was serene {{in the midst of the}} scoldings that were heaped upon the Ottoman government for its affront offered to a pleasuring party of entirely respectable gentlemen and ladies I said, [...] "We that have free souls, it touches us not." [...] The shoe not only pinched our party, but it pinched hard; a principal sufferer discovered that the imperial order was inclosed in an envelop bearing the seal of the British Embassy at Constantinople, and therefore must have been inspired by the representative of the Queen. This was bad--very bad. Coming solely from the Ottomans, it might have signified only Ottoman hatred of Christians, and a vulgar ignorance as to genteel methods of expressing it; but coming from the Christianized, educated, politic British legation, it simply intimated that we were a sort of gentlemen and ladies who would bear watching! So the party regarded it, and were incensed accordingly. The truth doubtless was, that the same precautions would have been taken against any travelers, because the English Company who have acquired the right to excavate Ephesus, and have paid a great sum for that right, need to be protected, and deserve to be. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>afford</b> to run the risk of having their hospitality abused by travelers, especially since travelers are such notorious scorners of honest behavior.|$|E

60|$|We {{say that}} the people were virtuous because they were busy; for there is no {{principle}} of political economy more fully established than that vice in the social state is the incident and symptom of idleness. It prevails always in those classes of every great population who are either released by the possession of fixed and unchangeable wealth from the necessity, or excluded by their poverty and degradation from the advantage, of useful employment. Wealth that is free, and subject to its possessor's control, so that he can, if he will, occupy himself {{in the management of}} it, while it sometimes may make individuals vicious, does not generally corrupt classes of men, for it does not make them idle. But wherever the institutions of a country are such as to create an aristocratic class, whose incomes depend on entailed estates, or on fixed and permanent annuities, so that the capital on which <b>they</b> live <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>afford</b> them any mental occupation, they are doomed necessarily to inaction and idleness. Vicious pleasures and indulgences are, with such a class as a whole, the inevitable result; for the innocent enjoyments of man are planned and designed by the Author of Nature only for the intervals of rest and repose in a life of activity. They are always found wholly insufficient to satisfy one who makes pleasure the whole end and aim of his being.|$|R
40|$|Part I of {{this article}} {{concluded}} that tax incentives for foreign direct investment (FDI) have become increasingly common over the past 10 years or so, especially among developing countries, {{and that there is}} substantial evidence to support the proposition that tax considerations now {{play an important role in}} many investment decisions. Countries seeking to attract FDI often feel compelled to offer tax inducements that are at least as attractive as those offered by their neighbours or competitors. Countries do so at a cost, however, and that cost may be substantial. Governments are thus placed in a dilemma - <b>can</b> <b>they</b> afford to cut taxes in order to attract investment, and <b>can</b> <b>they</b> <b>afford</b> <b>not</b> to? The second part {{of this article}} assumes that countries, and especially most developing countries, will continue to feel obliged to provide tax incentives. The aim of this part therefore is to examine ways in which those incentives can be made more effective and more efficient, thereby reducing their cost to the host country. <br /...|$|R
30|$|The 15 M movement, also {{referred}} to as #SpanishRevolution or the “Indignados” movement, emerged in May 2011 and has been defined as a “networked social movement of the digital age” [13]. Networked social movements, like the Arab Spring, the 15 M, and Occupy Wall Street, are claimed to be “a network of networks, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>afford</b> <b>not</b> to have an identifiable center, and yet ensure coordination functions, as well as deliberation, by interaction between multiple nodes” [13]. Other authors have defined this new model of social movement as a “change from logic of collective action, associated with high levels of organizational resources and the formation of collective identities, to a logic of connective action, based on personalized content sharing across media networks” [7]. There, these can be seen as paradigmatic examples of how the Internet is able to alter the mobilizing structure for collective action [50]. We should note that some voices have refused these theoretical assumptions and argued that “a handful of people control most of the communication flow” and, consequently, the existence of leaders in such movements could not be denied [27]. Empirical studies revealed that the 15 M network on Twitter is characterized by its “decentralized structure, based on coalitions of smaller organizations” in spite of “a small core of central users is still critical to trigger chains of messages of high orders of magnitude” [30]. Decentralization has been also observed in [59] in which the 15 M network is defined as polycentric.|$|R

40|$|Term time {{employment}} of tertiary students {{has increased dramatically}} following funding policy changes in the global Higher Education sector. Taking a comparative approach, this study of students at the University of Canterbury, New Zealand, investigates the decision to work during the academic term, the characteristics of such employment, and the perceived impacts on the university experiences of New Zealand domestic and Chinese international students. The study revealed {{similarities and differences between}} the two largest student populations. Compared to their New Zealand peers, Chinese international students are less likely to take term time employment. Among those who have worked, New Zealand domestic students do so for financial reasons, while Chinese international students value the work experience in the host country. Chinese international students receive much lower wages and tend to have shorter employment durations. In terms of perceived impacts, both New Zealand domestic and Chinese international students express a generally positive attitude towards their employment decisions, with a limited but clear awareness of the negative impacts. Interestingly, for those who have never worked, Chinese international students indicate a much stronger willingness to join the student workforce in the future. New Zealand domestic students, however, are much less likely to work if <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>afford</b> <b>not</b> to. This research provides empirical information about international students’ term time employment in the New Zealand context. Specific advice and mentoring services are needed at both university and government levels to provide ‘a more safe and supportive’ employment environment, especially for international students...|$|R
40|$|There is no single, {{commonly}} accepted {{definition of}} trade facilitation. In its broadest terms {{it may be}} defined as a measure, or set of measures, that aims to reduce the cost of international trade transactions or all steps that can be taken to smooth and facilitate the flow of trade. Further, the gains from trade facilitation may be defined as the trade related cost that can be avoided through trade facilitation measures. According to current statistics trade accounts for 30 % of the world’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and is expected to reach 50 % in 2020. One study has estimated the entire trade transaction cost at 7 - 10 % of the total value of world trade, where trade facilitation measures could reduce the costs by one quarter. Another study has estimated the transaction cost to 2 - 15 % of the total transacted values. Further one study point at benefits from trade facilitation of USD 377 billion globally on annual basis. When the cost of trade exceeds the business societies’ profit margins, enterprises are obliged to withdraw from trade. Alternatively, the cost of trade is transferred to the final customer, which reduces business societies’ competitive advantage, and hence therefore creates incentives to withdraw from trade. Any efforts to reduce costs of trade are aligned with the concept of trade facilitation, and statutes of a prerequisite for increased global trade. The question is not if Swedish enterprises should implement trade facilitation measures, but how long <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>afford</b> <b>not</b> do it considering the harsh international competition in foreign trade. Sweden is, and has been for many years, one of the most trade dependent countries in the world, due to being a small economy with a relatively large business society. Modern China is equally trade dependent and was first opened to foreign trade and investments when Mr. Deng Xiaoping became chairman of the communist party in 1978. China is today the 5 th largest economy {{in the world and the}} 8 th largest trading nation, accountable for 5 % of the world’s exports. Swedish trade with China has steadily increased in both substance and importance, during the past decade. In 2003, China became Sweden’s most important trading partner in Asia, accounting for 2. 14 % of Swedish total trade. In adopting trade facilitation measures the two nations may increase their competitive advantages and hence increase the trade even further...|$|R
