5|$|Although {{plants are}} {{better known for}} {{defensive}} mimicry, there are exceptions. For example, many flowers use mimicry to attract pollinators, while others may trick insects into dispersing their seeds. Nonetheless, most mimicry in plants would not be classified as aggressive, as although luring pollinators is similar to cases above, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>certainly</b> not eaten by the plant. However some carnivorous plants {{may be able to}} increase their rate of capture through mimicry. For example, some have patterns in the ultraviolet region of the electromagnetic spectrum, much like the spider webs described above.|$|E
5|$|Having settled {{matters in}} Khurasan, Harun {{returned}} to the west in November 805 and prepared a huge retaliatory expedition for 806, drawing men from Syria, Palestine, Persia, and Egypt. According to al-Tabari, his army numbered 135,000 regular troops and additional volunteers and freebooters. These numbers—and the even more fantastic claims of the Byzantine chronicler Theophanes the Confessor of 300,000 men—are easily the largest ever recorded for the entire Abbasid era and {{far more than the}} estimated strength of the entire Byzantine army. Although <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>certainly</b> exaggerated, they are nevertheless indicative {{of the size of the}} Abbasid force. At the same time, a naval force under his admiral Humayd ibn Ma'yuf al-Hajuri was prepared to raid Cyprus.|$|E
5|$|The common {{chiffchaff}} breeds across Europe and Asia east {{to eastern}} Siberia and north to about 70°N, with isolated populations in northwest Africa, northern and western Turkey and northwestern Iran. It is migratory, {{but it is}} one of the first passerine birds to return to its breeding areas in the spring and among the last to leave in late autumn. When breeding, it is a bird of open woodlands with some taller trees and ground cover for nesting purposes. These trees are typically at least 5metres (16ft) high, with undergrowth that is an open, poor to medium mix of grasses, bracken, nettles or similar plants. Its breeding habitat is quite specific, and even near relatives do not share it; for example, the willow warbler (P. trochilus) prefers younger trees, while the wood warbler (P. sibilatrix) prefers less undergrowth. In winter, the common chiffchaff uses a wider range of habitats including scrub, and is not so dependent on trees. It is often found near water, unlike the willow warbler which tolerates drier habitats. There is an increasing tendency to winter in western Europe well north of the traditional areas, especially in coastal southern England and the mild urban microclimate of London. These overwintering common chiffchaffs include some visitors of the eastern subspecies abietinus and tristis, so <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>certainly</b> not all birds which have bred locally, although some undoubtedly are.|$|E

25|$|William James {{was also}} {{interested}} in mystical experiences from a drug-induced perspective, leading him to make some experiments with nitrous oxide and even peyote. He concludes that while the revelations of the mystic hold true, they hold true only for the mystic; for others <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>certainly</b> ideas to be considered, but hold no claim to truth without personal experience of such.|$|E
25|$|In {{a lecture}} before Klal, a “mixed” group of rabbis, he {{maintained}} that non-Orthodox rabbis are “valid” spiritual leaders of their congregants, whereas the Orthodox are “legitimate” religious leaders. “Valid” {{comes from the}} Latin word validus which means powerful, strong–and <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>certainly</b> strong and influential Jewish leaders who should be respected for their efforts. But only Orthodox rabbis can lay claim to “legitimacy,” a word which derives from Latin lex, law. Only one committed fully to the halakha can be considered Jewishly legitimate as a rabbi.|$|E
25|$|All {{three of}} the {{northern}} New England states (Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine) contain some areas that are unincorporated and unorganized, not part of any town, city or plantation. Maine has significantly more such area {{than the other two}} states. While these areas do exist, their importance should not be overstated. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>certainly</b> {{the exception rather than the}} rule in the New England system, and the number of New England residents who live in them is extremely small in comparison to those who live in towns and cities, even in Maine. Most such areas are located in very sparsely populated regions. Much of the barely inhabited interior of Maine is unorganized, for example.|$|E

25|$|Milne {{toured the}} Caucasus in early 1919 and thought “the {{country and the}} {{inhabitants}} are equally loathsome” and that British withdrawal “would probably lead to anarchy” but “the world would (not) lose much if {{the whole of the}} country cut each other’s throats. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>certainly</b> not worth the life of a single British soldier”. At the end of August 1919 the British withdrew from Baku (the small British naval presence was also withdrawn from the Caspian Sea), leaving only 3 battalions at Batum. Lord Curzon, Foreign Secretary, wanted a British presence in the region, although to Curzon’s fury (he thought it “abuse of authority”) the CIGS Henry Wilson gave Milne permission to withdraw if he deemed it necessary. After a British garrison at Enzeli (on the Persian Caspian coast) was taken prisoner by Bolshevik forces on 19 May 1920, Lloyd George finally insisted on a withdrawal from Batum early in June 1920. Financial retrenchment forced a British withdrawal from Persia in the spring of 1921.|$|E
500|$|Much of the {{collection}} consists of luxury objects from the 16th century. [...] Large pieces of metalwork in silver or silver-gilt make an immediate impression in the display, and these were designed to dazzle and impress guests when used at table, or displayed in rows on a sideboard with shelves like a modern bookcase or Welsh dresser. [...] Many are very heavily decorated in virtuoso displays of goldsmiths' technique; rather too heavily for conventional modern taste. [...] <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>certainly</b> ostentatious objects designed to display the wealth of their owner, {{and in many cases}} were designed to be appreciated when held in the hand, rather than seen under glass.|$|E

But Michelangelo knew the Bible well. He would have been well {{aware of the fact that}} although seraphim and cherubim are described as being winged creatures, they are described as looking like men. When Michelangelo later painted the altar wall of the chapel, he included a great number of angels, particularly in the lunettes which are decorated with scenes of angels carrying the symbols of the Passion. Other angels are employed sounding the trumpets which call forth the dead, displaying books in which the names of the saved and the damned are written and casting sinners down to Hell. In all, the Last Judgement contains more than forty angels, all closely resembling the Ignudi. It is reasonable to conclude that the Ignudi represent angels. [...] If the Ignudi are indeed angels, they are the ever-present attendants and messengers of God, impassively watching and waiting on the fate of Humankind.|$|E

2500|$|One {{important}} factor that causes variation is differing speech rate. Many phonemic contrasts are constituted by temporal characteristics (short vs. long vowels or consonants, affricates vs. fricatives, plosives vs. glides, voiced vs. voiceless plosives, etc.) and <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>certainly</b> affected {{by changes in}} speaking tempo. Another major source of variation is articulatory carefulness vs. sloppiness which is typical for connected speech (articulatory [...] "undershoot" [...] is obviously reflected in the acoustic properties of the sounds produced).|$|E

2500|$|Some of Kim Salmon's {{later work}} has {{reflected}} a quieter style. In 2002 he released an acoustic solo album, E(a)rnest, where {{he used a}} Yamaha G55 and spent 18 months recording {{it in his own}} studio. He then commenced a country music group, Darling Downs, with former Died Pretty singer, Ron Peno. Their debut album, How Can I Forget This Heart of Mine?, was released in 2005. It appeared in the US market in May 2006 and Dan Raper of PopMatters noted [...] "these are subtle, slow-hitting songs. They’re not insignificant, but <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>certainly</b> quirky" [...] although the album [...] "could reward you, but not right away, and it's riddled with tics and mannerisms that are almost purposefully thrown in to turn you away".|$|E
