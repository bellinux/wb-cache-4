Four {{successive}} architectural levels from the second kingdom's palace have been unearthed (the oldest is designated P3, while the latest is P0), and the last <b>two</b> <b>levels</b> are dated to the Akkadian period. The first <b>two</b> <b>levels</b> were excavated; the findings include a temple named Enceinte Sacrée, which was the largest in the city but it is unknown for whom it was dedicated. Also unearthed were a pillared throne room and a hall that have three double wood pillars leading to the temple.|$|E

The covariant derivative operator is constructed and related to the free energy. We show that the gauge invariant characterization of the time evolution of the <b>two</b> <b>level</b> system is analogous to the birefringence phenomenon in optics. The relation with Berry-like and Anandan [...] Aharonov phase is pointed out. Finally, we discuss entropy, environment effects and the distance in projective Hilbert space between <b>two</b> <b>level</b> states in their evolution. Comment: 7 page...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{software}} implementation for <b>two</b> <b>level</b> & three level inverter using {{space vector modulation}} techniques. This software implementation is performed by using MATLAB/SIMULINK software. This paper gives comparison between SVPWM Three phase <b>two</b> <b>level</b> & three <b>level</b> inverter. <b>Two</b> <b>level</b> inverter is the basic technique to implement any level. The main advantage of the <b>two</b> <b>level</b> inverter is simple in computation and also switching device selection is simple. It is becomes difficult in high voltage & high power applications due to the increased switching losses and limited rating of the dc link voltage. Multilevel inverters are used in high voltage and high power applications with less harmonic contents. The harmonic contents of a three level inverter are {{less than that of}} <b>two</b> <b>level</b> inverters. And also rating of the dc link voltage is high. The simulation study reveals that three level inverter generates less THD compared to two-level inverter. Key words—SVPWM, THD, <b>TWO</b> LVEL &THREE <b>LEVEL</b> INVERTERS I...|$|R

40|$|Noise {{is often}} {{considered}} to be a nuisance. Here we argue that it can be a useful probe of fluctuating <b>two</b> <b>level</b> systems in glasses. It can be used to: (1) shed light on whether the fluctuations are correlated or independent events; (2) determine if there is a low temperature glass or phase transition among interacting <b>two</b> <b>level</b> systems, and if the hierarchical or droplet model can be used to describe the glassy phase; and (3) find the lower bound of the <b>two</b> <b>level</b> system relaxation rate without going to ultralow temperatures. Finally we point out that understanding noise due to <b>two</b> <b>level</b> systems is important for technological applications such as quantum qubits that use Josephson junctions.

5|$|Although no {{speech or}} text is used {{anywhere}} in the game aside from credits and interaction hints in the main menu, the six flower dreams follow a narrative arc. The player's starting location in each stage appears to be near the ending location of the previous one, and {{through the course of}} the game the player approaches a distant city. The first levels focus on restoring life and color to the landscape. After activating a series of windmills, the player flies through a nighttime field, illuminating darkened strings of lights until they reach the city. The city is full of menacing metal structures, small arcs of electricity, and washed-out buildings; the player enlivens the city in the final <b>two</b> <b>levels</b> and transforms it into a bright and cheerful place.|$|E
5|$|Another aspect {{introduced}} in the game is the Dimension Link (D-Link), measured in a blue gauge on the interface. It is used to draw power from certain companions who the player characters meet during the game, such as Experiment 626, temporarily replacing the commands in the player's customized command deck with a pre-determined set of commands that differ with each D-Link. Once the command gauge is filled while performing a D-Link, a powerful finishing move is activated to take out enemies. Each finishing move has <b>two</b> <b>levels</b> which can render a finishing move more powerful than before, {{similar to that of}} the Command System. The D-Link can only be used when its corresponding gauge is filled completely, and can be activated by pressing right on the directional pad to access the D-Link menu, followed by selecting the chosen ally.|$|E
40|$|Noise and {{decoherence}} {{are major}} obstacles {{to the implementation}} of Josephson junction qubits in quantum computing. Recent experiments suggest that <b>two</b> <b>level</b> systems (TLS) in the oxide tunnel barrier are a source of decoherence. We explore two decoherence mechanisms in which these <b>two</b> <b>level</b> systems lead to the decay of Rabi oscillations that result when Josephson junction qubits are subjected to strong microwave driving. (A) We consider a Josephson qubit coupled resonantly to a <b>two</b> <b>level</b> system, i. e., the qubit and TLS have equal energy splittings. As a result of this resonant interaction, the occupation probability of the excited state of the qubit exhibits beating. Decoherence of the qubit results when the <b>two</b> <b>level</b> system decays from its excited state by emitting a phonon. (B) Fluctuations of the <b>two</b> <b>level</b> systems in the oxide barrier produce fluctuations and 1 /f noise in the Josephson junction critical current I_o. This in turn leads to fluctuations in the qubit energy splitting that degrades the qubit coherence. We compare our results with experiments on Josephson junction phase qubits.
