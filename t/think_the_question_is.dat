"Technical education," [...] in {{the sense}} in which the term is ordinarily used, and in which I am now {{employing}} it, means that sort of education which is specially adapted to the needs of men whose business in life it is to pursue some kind of handicraft; it is, in fact, a fine Greco-Latin equivalent for what in good vernacular English would be called [...] "the teaching of handicrafts." [...] And probably, at this stage of our progress, it may occur to many of you to think of the story of the cobbler and his last, and to say to yourselves, though you will be too polite to put the question openly to me, What does the speaker know practically about this matter?

60|$|But {{there are}} some people, nevertheless--and I am one of them--who think that the most {{practical}} and important thing about a man is still {{his view of the}} universe. We think that for a landlady considering a lodger, {{it is important to know}} his income, but still more important to know his philosophy. We think that for a general about to fight an enemy, it is important to know the enemy's numbers, but still more important to know the enemy's philosophy. We <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> not whether the theory of the cosmos affects matters, but whether in the long run, anything else affects them. In the fifteenth century men cross-examined and tormented a man because he preached some immoral attitude; in the nineteenth century we feted and flattered Oscar Wilde because he preached such an attitude, and then broke his heart in penal servitude because he carried it out. It may be a question which of the two methods was the more cruel; there can be no kind of question which was the more ludicrous. The age of the Inquisition has not at least the disgrace of having produced a society which made an idol of the very same man for preaching the very same things which it made him a convict for practising.|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} few years, the role of {{pharmaceutical}} price controls has been frequently questioned by economists {{on the grounds that}} they lower investments in research and development (R&D), due to reduced profitability [1]. A recent article by Danzon, Wang and Wang (hereafter, DWW [2]), although related to this general topic, somehow shifts the perspective, focusing on the effects of price regulation on strategic decisions to launch new chemical entities (NCEs) and finding that low prices in a therapeutic class are significantly related to launch delays of NCEs. DWW claim that these de-lays might be mainly a consequence of companies’ decisions to avoid price spillovers due to parallel trade and external referencing. After DWW, further ‘‘launch delay’ ’ literature appeared. Lanjow [3] and Kyle [4] reached similar conclusions to DWW, although using different data and techniques. The issue of launch delays becomes even more important in relation to the economic literature. For example, in different analyses Lichtenberg [5, 6] found that, compared to old products, NCEs are better at ‘‘keeping people out of the hospital’ ’ and improving life expectancy. A generalization of Lichtenberg’s re-sults would imply that lower prices may negatively affect overall social welfare by creating barriers to the entry of new drugs [7]. We <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> important and deserves further attention. Here we identify some reasons why these results cannot be interpreted simplistically. Authorities ’ or companies ’ decision? A ‘‘global’ ’ NCE launch can be delayed or rejected mainly for two reasons: • The company does not start the bargaining, e. g. for fear of cross-reference pricing or parallel trading • The price negotiation for a product (i) between the company (j) and the regulator (n) fails (Pji offer < Pni ask) In all the studies mentioned it is not possible to distinguish between these two cases, i. e. between a company’s decision not to apply for reimbursement in a country and the failure of the bargaining process. From both a regulator’s and an analyst’s point of view, however, what really matters is the first type of delay. If the decision to accept a NCE is based in theory on the maximization of the social-welfare function under budget constraints, then a failure in the bargainin...|$|E

40|$|What did {{you think}} you <b>were</b> doing?” Was <b>the</b> <b>question</b> posed by <b>the</b> conference {{organizers}} to me as the inventor and constructor of the first working Tangible Interfaces over 40 years ago. I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>was</b> intended to encourage me to talk about the underlying ideas and intentionality rather than describe an endless sequence of electronic bricks and that is what I shall do in this presentation. In the sixties the prevalent idea for a graphics interface was an analogue with sketching which was to somehow be understood by the computer as three dimensional form. I rebelled against this notion for reasons which I will explain in the presentation and instead came up with tangible physical three dimensional intelligent objects. I called these first prototypes “Intelligent Physical Modelling Systems” which is a really dumb name for an obvious concept. I am eternally grateful to Hiroshi Ishii for coining the term “Tangible User Interfaces” - the same idea but with a much smarter name. Another motivator was user involvement in the design process, and that led to the Generator (1979) project with Cedric Price for the world’s first intelligent building capable of organizing itself in response to the appetites of the users. The working model of that project is in MoMA. And the same motivation led to a self builders design kit (1980) for Walter Segal which facilitated self-builders to design their own houses. And indeed as <b>the</b> organizer’s <b>question</b> implied, <b>the</b> motivation and intentionality of these projects developed over the years in step with advancing technology. The speaker will attempt to articulate these changes with medical, psychological and educational examples. Much of this later work indeed stemming from the Media Lab where we are talking. Related topics such as “tangible thinking” and “intelligent teacups” will be introduced and the presentation will end with some speculations for the future. The presentation will be given against a background of images of early prototypes many of which have never been previously published...|$|R

China may be regarded as an artist nation, with the virtues and vices to be expected of the artist: virtues chiefly useful to others, and vices chiefly harmful to oneself. Can Chinese virtues be preserved? Or must China, in order to survive, acquire, instead, the vices which make for success and cause misery to others only?
