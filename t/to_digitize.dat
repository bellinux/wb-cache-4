In February 2012, Clough's travel expenses were probed by senator Charles E.

Many of the exhibitions were co-sponsored by either the Jordanian government (pre-1967) or the Israeli government (post-1967). Exhibitions were discontinued after 1965 due to the Six-days War conflicts and have slowed down in post-2011 as the Israeli Antiquities Authority works <b>to</b> <b>digitize</b> the scrolls and place them in permanent cold storage.|$|E

25|$|From the beginning, {{the game}} was {{designed}} to be played solely online and to mimic the feel of physical cards to make it more accessible to new players. Dodds found that past attempts <b>to</b> <b>digitize</b> physical card games by other companies left areas they felt were lacking, and wanted to improve on that experience. One particular example are card games where players have the ability to react to other players; Dodds noted that when playing in the same room as another player, these types of interactions are straightforward, but consume {{a great deal of time}} in a virtual space. Hearthstone was designed to eliminate any gameplay from the opponent during the player's turn, streamlining the game.|$|E
25|$|The {{first step}} will be {{interactive}} Web-based portal called Learning Village {{that would be}} fully functioning by fall 2010. The Learning Village program will give DPS the ability <b>to</b> <b>digitize</b> its textbooks, curriculum and lesson plans. Teachers {{will have access to}} students' assessment results and prospective lesson plans to more quickly diagnosis struggling students. Parents can log into the system to track their students' progress, print additional worksheets and view cumulative test results for a teacher's entire class. The purpose of the Learning Village tool is to serve as a unified portal to connect students, teachers, parents and principals, and deliver real-time learning. DPS will also use $14.2 million in federal stimulus and Title I dollars for netbooks for all 36,000 students and 4,000 teachers in grades 6–12 for access to technology to support hands-on learning.

40|$|Perirhinal cortex {{ablation}} {{has previously}} been shown only to impair new postoperative object discrimination learning with large stimulus set sizes (> or = 40 problems). In this study, 3 cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) with bilateral perirhinal cortex ablations were impaired relative to 3 normal controls on concurrent discrimination learning tasks with only 10 problems with the objects presented in different orientations in each trial to increase the demands placed on object identification. This supports the hypothesis that perirhinal cortex damage impairs the ability to identify multiple individual objects. Fewer errors were made <b>to</b> <b>digitized</b> images of objects than toward real objects.
