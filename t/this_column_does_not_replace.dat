Recommendations of Investor Ali column of the weekly-published popular economics journal Moneymatik constitutes our sample. The column is designed to inform individual investors about company prospects and use them as the basis for its recommendations. The results show that the published investment advice in <b>this</b> <b>column</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> help small investors earn excess returns. On the contrary, it provides a valuable deal to its `preferred investors', if any, in selecting the stocks. If one could front-run the column's recommendations by five days he/she could earn more than 5 % per week in excess of the index return.

50|$|In general, {{a linear}} program {{will not be}} given in {{canonical}} form and an equivalent canonical tableau must be found before the simplex algorithm can start. This {{can be accomplished by}} the introduction of artificial variables. Columns of the identity matrix are added as column vectors for these variables. If the b value for a constraint equation is negative, the equation is negated before adding the identity matrix <b>columns.</b> <b>This</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> change the set of feasible solutions or the optimal solution, and it ensures that the slack variables will constitute an initial feasible solution. The new tableau is in canonical form but it is not equivalent to the original problem. So a new objective function, equal to the sum of the artificial variables, is introduced and the simplex algorithm is applied to find the minimum; the modified linear program is called the Phase I problem.|$|R
40|$|Antisera to {{the sodium}} dodecyl sulfate (SDS) -polyacrylamide gel-derived polyoma virion polypeptides were used in immunoprecipitation {{experiments}} with ethylene glycol-bis-N,N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) -dissociated polyoma virions and capsids to determine the specificity of the antipolyoma polypeptide sera. Additionally, a technique for applying 125 I-labeled immunoglobulins to SDS-polyacrylamide gels was used to explore the antigenic specificities of the antisera. The results demonstrated that antisera directed against the SDS-gel-derived VP 1, VP 2, and VP 3 <b>did</b> <b>not</b> react with native polyoma proteins, but would react with the appropriate antigens on denatured polyoma proteins. Antisera against the histone region of such gels reacted with native and denatured polyoma VP 1. Separation of neutralizing antibodies from hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) antibodies to polyoma in antisera directed against the histone region of polyacrylamide gels was done by using a polyoma capsid affinity column. The antibodies eluted from <b>this</b> <b>column</b> which <b>did</b> <b>not</b> react with capsids possessed only neutralizing activity, whereas antibodies which bound to capsids possessed only HAI activity. These isolated immunoglobulin G fractions were then used in immunoprecipitation experiments {{to demonstrate that the}} antigenic determinants responsible for the HAI activity of the serum were contained on a 16, 000 -dalton polypeptide, whereas those antigenic determinants responsible for neutralizing activity were contained on a 14, 000 -dalton polypeptide.

In this paper, we generalize these {{rectangular}} matrices {{to accommodate}} the important case where a given region has zero options - rather than one or more than one - for producing {{the product of a}} particular sector, that is, it is not equipped to produce that output at all. In this case, there is no information for creating a <b>column</b> for <b>this</b> sector, and we will see that a column is not needed. The region may, however, require the use of the output in question, which then it must import; if it <b>does</b> <b>not</b> use the product either, the demand quantified in the row of intermediate inputs is legitimately and unproblematically zero. That is, whether or not the product is used in the region, the row for this sector need not be suppressed. The rectangularity of the regional matrices {{comes from the fact that}} each one has exactly n rows but may have a smaller or larger number of columns. The number of columns is reduced by each sector that <b>does</b> <b>not</b> produce in that region and increased for each sector that has more than one technology option. Note that even if the rectangular matrix happens to be square (i.e., with the same number of rows and <b>columns),</b> <b>this</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> assure a one-to-one relationship between rows and columns as in the standard A matrix. It may mean, for example, that one sector is not present in this economy, but another sector has two technological options.|$|R
40|$|The {{abundance}} and species composition of viable resting stage cells and vegetative cells of centric diatoms were investigated in Ago Bay in May and]uly， 2006 ，and in March 2007 {{to evaluate the}} functionality of the resting stage cells as a seed population. Viable resting stage cells in the surface sediments were enumerated by the extinction dilution method (most probable number method). High densities of resting stage cells (6. 1 × 103 － 2. 4 × 105 resting stage cells cm - 3) were detected throughout the study period. In the assemblage of resting stage cells， 8 genera 25 　species in total were identified. Among the 25 species， 24 species (i. e. 96 % of the total) were observed in the assemblage of vegetative cells，suggesting that the resting stage cells in the surface sediments function well as a seed population for the vegetative cells. However，the {{abundance and}} composition of the dominant groups in the sediments <b>did</b> <b>not</b> always correspond {{to those in the}} water <b>column.</b> <b>This</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> however point to a lack of importance of resting stage cells as seeds，since bloom dynamics after recruitment of newly germinated / rejuvenated cells into the water column are largely dependent on vegetative growth, which is controlled by many environmental factors. Furthermore，this study suggested that species diversity in the vegetative assemblage of centric diatoms in Ago Bay is substantially supported by the seed population in the surface sediments...|$|R
