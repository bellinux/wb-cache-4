40|$|Abstract. A mobile {{manipulation}} system {{often involves}} combining {{more than one}} robot together, typically a manipulator arm and a mobile base. To implement a force and motion control with dynamic compensation, a <b>torque-controlled</b> system is necessary. However, a <b>torque-controlled</b> robot is not always available. In fact, most commercially available mo-bile bases are velocity-controlled. This paper presents a method for combining a <b>torque-controlled</b> arm and a velocity-controlled base, while performing a force and motion task. The operational space formulation using a consistent set of integrated arm-base robot dy-namics is employed in a mobile manipulation task of polishing an aircraft canopy. The torque controlled arm compensates for the dynamics introduced by the mobile base. The added mobility of the base enables the arm to cover the entire workspace. ...|$|E

Based on the experiences in lightweight robotics and anthropomorphic robotic hands, a small robot arm with 7 axis and <b>torque-controlled</b> joints tailored to surgical procedures has been designed. With an optimized anthropomorphic kinematics, integrated multi-modal sensors and flexible robot control architecture, the first prototype KINEMEDIC and the new generation MIRO, enhanced for endoscopic surgery, can easily be adapted {{to a wide range}} of different medical procedures and scenarios by the use of specialized instruments and compiling workflows within the robot control.

40|$|Objectives This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} {{the relationship between the}} cyclic fatigue of a K 3 file and internal stress intentionally induced until the activation of the auto-stop function of the <b>torque-controlled</b> motor. Materials and Methods K 3 (Sybron Endo). 04 and. 06 taper, size 25, 30, 35, 40 and 45 were used in this study. To give the internal stress, the K 3 files were put into the. 02 taper Endo-Training-Bloc (Dentsply Maillefer) until the activation of the auto-stop function of the <b>torque-controlled</b> motor. The rotation speed was 300 rpm and torque value was 1. 0 N·cm. K 3 were grouped by the number of induced internal stress and randomly distributed to 4 experimental groups (n = 10, Stress 0 [control], Stress 1, Stress 2 and Stress 3). For measuring the cyclic fatigue failure, the K 3 files were worked against a sloped glass block and time for file separation was recorded. Data was statistically analyzed Statistical analyses were performed using two-way ANOVA and Duncan post-hoc test at p < 0. 05 level. Results Except. 04 taper size 30 in Stress 1 group, there were statistically significant differences in time for file separation between control and all experimental groups. K 3 with. 04 taper showed higher cyclic fatigue resistance than those of. 06 taper. Conclusion In the limitation of this study, the cyclic fatigue of the K 3 file was influenced by the accumulated internal stress from use until the auto-stop function was activated by the <b>torque-controlled</b> motor. Therefore, clinicians should avoid the reuse of the K 3 file that has undergone auto-stops...|$|E

Where possible, space vector theory is used and emphasis is laid on detailed mathematical and physical analysis. Sensorless drive schemes for different types of permanent magnet synchronous motors, synchronous reluctance motors, and induction motors are also presented. These include more than twenty vector drives e. g. five types of MRAS-based vector drives, and eleven types of direct-torque-controlled (DTC) drives, e. g. the ABB DTC drive.

The compensation of velocity-dependent coupling terms between the tasks by an additional passive feedback action facilitates a stability analysis for the complete hierarchy based on semi-definite Lyapunov functions.

40|$|Modern robotic {{systems with}} a large number of {{actuated}} degrees of freedom can be utilized to perform several tasks at the same time while following a given order of priority.

However, introducing null space projectors inevitably destroys the beneficial and safety-relevant feature of passivity. Here, two controllers are proposed to restore the passivity: one with local energy tanks on each hierarchy level and one with a global tank for the entire system. The formal proofs of passivity show that no energy is generated by these controllers. Once the tanks are empty, passivity is still guaranteed at the cost of some control performance.

In the past, many algorithms were proposed based on a weighted pseudoinverse of the grasp map. In a different approach, Stramigioli introduced a virtual-object based controller – called an Intrinsically Passive Controller (IPC). These controllers are reviewed and compared. A new controller {{that is similar to}} the IPC but using a virtual frame rather than a virtual object is subsequently proposed.

Controllers for robotic hands usually implement only stiffness controllers and do not program the damping. We address how to choose and implement damping {{as a function of the}} desired object-level stiffness and the effective hand–object inertia.

40|$|Instrument {{fracture}} can be {{an unpleasant}} mishap during non-surgical root canal treatment. While most stainless-steel instruments appear to fail by excessive amounts of torque, the combined action of torsional stress and cyclic loading (i. e. fatigue, {{as a result of}} rotational bending, or repeated torsion) is responsible for the breakage of NiTi rotary files in use. Factors affecting the incidence and mode of failures include the instrumentation technique, use of <b>torque-controlled</b> motor, the dimension and surface condition of the instrument, rotation rate, radius (and, to a certain extent, angle) of canal curvature, and the presence of a straight-line access and a ‘glide path’ to the apical portion of the canal. If breakage should occur clinically, the patient should be informed of the incident and consideration should be given {{as to whether or not}} to remove the fragment. Managed properly, the presence of a broken fragment per se may not adversely affect the outcome of root canal treatment.
