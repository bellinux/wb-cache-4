5|$|Except for {{the corner}} houses, <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> <b>were</b> built in pairs, each sharing a porch with its neighbour. For {{many of the}} smaller fourth- and fifth-class houses, the doors were aligned {{at right angles to}} the façade of the house, so as not to open {{directly}} adjacently to their neighbours. All houses were designed with at least one parlour and with the kitchen, scullery, and toilet in separate rooms {{at the rear of the}} house; the first-class houses also had toilets upstairs. In line with the design principles of the time, the downstairs toilets were accessible only from the back gardens, and <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> <b>were</b> not fitted with separate bathrooms; baths were taken in a moveable bath located in the kitchen.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> Brinkerhoff <b>House,</b> <b>is</b> {{located in}} Wood-Ridge, Bergen County, New Jersey, United States. The {{building}} was originally constructed in 1792 by George Brinkerhoff.

5|$|In 2000, 28.70% of {{the houses}} in Juniata County were built before 1939, 6.51% {{were built in the}} 1940s, and 8.26% were built in the 1950s. 8.53% of the county's houses were built in the 1960s, 17.99% were built in the 1970s, and 14.18% were built in the 1980s. 15.82% of <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> <b>were</b> built in the 1990s or in 2000.

5|$|Plumbe {{designed}} the estate with five classes of houses. Although <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> <b>were</b> built {{to the same}} five basic designs, each street was given a distinct style of design and ornamentation. Varying mixes of red and yellow bricks, and variations in window design and ornamental motifs, were used to give each street a distinct identity. All were designed with front and back gardens. Corner houses were given distinctive designs and turrets.|$|E
5|$|The barracks {{was less}} than 10yards wide and 33yards long (9mx30m) and was divided into eight houses, each with three floors, {{containing}} 56 rooms in all. Each floor had seven rooms facing the front and seven in the back. There were no internal hallways. The rooms were accessed directly from the outside via eight narrow wooden staircases, a fire hazard given that the stairs provided the sole exit and <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> <b>were</b> separated only by thin lathe and plaster partitions.|$|E
40|$|The {{beauty of}} <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>is</b> order; <b>The</b> blessing of <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>is</b> contentment; <b>The</b> glory of <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>is</b> hospitality; <b>The</b> crown of <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>is</b> godliness.

50|$|On July 20, 1936, <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>was</b> {{measured}} through <b>the</b> Historic American Buildings Survey. On August 21, 1936, architectural {{drawings of}} <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>were</b> prepared.

5|$|The {{center of}} the city {{contained}} several reinforced concrete buildings and lighter structures. Outside the center, the area was congested by a dense collection of small timber-made workshops set among Japanese houses. A few larger industrial plants lay near the outskirts of the city. <b>The</b> <b>houses</b> <b>were</b> constructed of timber with tile roofs, and many of the industrial buildings were also built around timber frames. The city as a whole was highly susceptible to fire damage.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>houses</b> <b>were</b> {{named after}} a local resident, Ponsonby Tottenham, a {{relative}} of the then Marquess of Ely. Number 2 was {{the home of the}} Revd.

5|$|The layout {{was unique}} {{within the city}} of Napa, {{and may have been}} unique within California. The site {{differentiated}} from most agricultural sites by facing away from the road, with no distinct difference between middle-class and workers' houses, in size, finishing, or location. Many of the buildings shared walls or were built abutting each other, and two of <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> <b>were</b> built over a single basement.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>house</b> <b>was</b> {{acquired}} by <b>the</b> Brooklyn Museum in 1952. <b>The</b> land <b>the</b> <b>house</b> sat on became {{the site of}} elementary school P.S. 236. <b>The</b> <b>house</b> <b>was</b> still extant after the school was built, it was located behind the school.

5|$|The {{residents}} of Milwaukee Avenue {{and the surrounding}} Seward neighborhood formed the Seward West Project Area Committee (PAC) {{in order to try}} to save the Milwaukee Avenue homes. They argued that the houses had significant historic value and needed to be preserved. The City argued that <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> <b>were</b> legally nonconforming, and rehabilitating them would cost more than just building new houses.|$|E
5|$|Damage was {{heaviest}} in Mozambique, {{estimated at}} about $20million (1994USD). Cyclone Nadia severely affected four provinces in the country, primarily Nampula Province where it moved ashore. There, 85% of <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> <b>were</b> destroyed, and across its path, the cyclone left 1.5million people homeless. High winds caused widespread power outages, left areas without water, and significantly damaged crops, notably the cashew crop. The storm struck before the harvest, {{and lack of}} food resulted in 300deaths {{in the months after}} the storm. Across Mozambique, Nadia directly caused 240deaths and injured thousands. Effects spread as far inland as Malawi.|$|E
5|$|Despite these precautions, {{pollution}} {{from the power}} stations was still a factor. In 1954, consideration was given to scrapping the plan to build the Union Hall housing estate in Lemington because of probable {{pollution from}} nearby power stations. This was mainly because some of <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> <b>were</b> as high as, if not higher than, the power stations' chimneys. At times, this meant the estate being exposed {{to as much as}} 1.25 parts per million of sulphur dioxide. However the estate was still built, as these peak conditions were thought unlikely to occur on more than 18 days in a year.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>house</b> <b>was</b> {{substantially}} altered or rebuilt in the 1840s and, {{following a}} serious fire, was rebuilt in the 1870s by William King.

50|$|<b>The</b> Sibley-Corcoran <b>House</b> <b>is</b> a {{historic}} <b>house</b> at 387 Valley Road in Washington, Massachusetts. <b>The</b> <b>house</b> <b>was</b> built c. 1813 by Ezra Sibley, {{and sold in}} 1825 to Daniel Sibley, including 123 acre of land. <b>The</b> <b>house</b> <b>was</b> built with Federalist features, but later owners added architectural details of the fashionable styles of the 19th century.

5|$|Following the 15th century Reformation when {{clerical}} {{marriage was}} permitted, larger households {{would have been}} required {{and as a result}} some of <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> <b>were</b> altered and combined by knocking through walls, into larger dwellings. Others had extensions built to the rear. Water supply was originally from two wells, one {{at each end of the}} close. By 1468 lead pipes had been installed to bring water into the houses, although the wells continued to function until the 19th century. Number 22 is the house which still has most of its original medieval structure as it was originally built.|$|E
5|$|In the 18thcentury it was {{the custom}} for the wealthy in Poulton to bury their dead at night, {{following}} a lamp-lit procession through town. This tradition lasted until 1810. In 1732, during the procession preceding the funeral of Geoffrey Hornby, strong winds caused sparks to fly from the lighted tapers carried by mourners. The buildings {{on the west side}} of the market place, low cottages with thatched roofs, caught fire and were destroyed. After local fund-raising <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> <b>were</b> eventually replaced with brick buildings with tile roofs.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th century, Thomas John Newbold, an English soldier {{working for}} the East India Company, {{estimated}} the population of Kuala Terengganu to be around 15,000 to 20,000 Malays with 600 Chinese, but it was presumably an overestimation. There were few brick buildings in the town. The principal brick buildings were a mosque and a custom house. Most of <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> <b>were</b> made of wood and thatch. The Chinese settlement in Kuala Terengganu, Kampung Cina, had become an old and established settlement. Most of the houses and shops in Kampung Cina were made of stone and brick. There were also {{a considerable number of}} Arabs and their descendant in Kuala Terengganu.|$|E
