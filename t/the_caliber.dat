5|$|Preliminary {{examination}} of the bullet can exclude {{a large number of}} weapons by examining the general characteristics of a recovered bullet. By determining general aspects of the fired ammunition, a number of weapons can be immediately excluded as being incapable of firing that type of bullet. The make and model of the weapon can also be inferred from the combination of different class characteristics that are common to specific manufactures. The three main class characteristics of all bullets are the lands and grooves, <b>the</b> <b>caliber</b> of the bullet, and the rifling twist. All three can be tied directly to the type of barrel that was used to fire the bullet. The lands and grooves of barrel are the bumps and valleys created when the rifling is created. <b>The</b> <b>caliber</b> is the diameter of the barrel. The twist is the direction of the striations left by the barrel's rifling, clockwise (right-handed) or counterclockwise (left-handed). Most barrels will have a right-handed twist with the exception of weapons created by the Colt's Manufacturing Company which uses left-handed twists. Weapon barrels that match the class characteristics of recovered bullets can be examined further for individual characteristics to determine if the bullet came from that particular weapon.|$|E
5|$|Costa {{was chosen}} as Down Beat jazz critics' new star on piano and vibes for 1957; {{this was the first}} time that one artist had won two {{categories}} in the same year. In 1962 he was invited to play at the first International Jazz Festival in Washington, D.C. by the President's Music Committee of the People to People program. An indication of the esteem in which Costa was held by musicians is <b>the</b> <b>caliber</b> of those who performed at his memorial concert at The Village Gate on October 8, 1962: Cohn, Benny Golson, Zoot Sims, Charlie Byrd, Jim Hall, Mundell Lowe, Farmer, Clark Terry and Hawkins were among those who played. The playing of the bands led by the last two was recorded and released as an LP. Hawkins did not usually play at benefit concerts, but his feelings for Costa meant that he did what he could to make the seven-hour event a success.|$|E

The treaty limited large German warships to a displacement of , but did not restrict <b>the</b> <b>caliber</b> of main battery guns. Several innovations were incorporated into the design, including extensive use of welding and all-diesel propulsion, which saved weight and allowed for the heavier main armament and armor. Nevertheless, the ships exceeded the weight restriction by several thousand tons, though the German Navy claimed the vessels were within the limitations. The three ships, Deutschland, Admiral Scheer, and Admiral Graf Spee, were built between 1929 and 1936. Design changes were made {{over the course of the}} construction program, resulting in slightly differing characteristics of each ship.|$|E
5|$|The Best Man Wins is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film features Thanhouser's leading players Anna Rosemond, Martin Faust, Frank H. Crane and Marie Eline in a drama about morality. Two suitors are vying for the hand of Julia Seaton and propose {{to her on the}} same day, but she asks for a month to decide between them. In the time <b>the</b> <b>caliber</b> of both men are tested when asked by a young girl, named May, to help her dying mother. The doctor refuses to help and the lawyer offers his assistance, but her mother soon dies. The orphan is taken in by the Seaton family and personally attests to the character of both men when Julia Seaton has to choose between her suitors. The writer, director and cameraman are unknown. Released on May 14, 1910, the film was met with mostly positive reviews by critics. The film is presumed lost.|$|E

25|$|Booker and {{his brother}} Stevie Ray signed with World Championship Wrestling (WCW) after Sid Vicious {{recommended}} they sign with the company.

25|$|The {{corresponding}} percentile of each scaled score {{varies from}} test to test—for example, in 2003, a scaled score of 800 in both {{sections of the}} SAT Reasoning Test corresponded to a percentile of 99.9, while a scaled score of 800 in the SAT Physics Test corresponded to the 94th percentile. The differences in what scores mean with regard to percentiles are due {{to the content of}} the exam and <b>the</b> <b>caliber</b> of students choosing to take each exam. Subject Tests are subject to intensive study (often {{in the form of an}} AP, which is relatively more difficult), and only those who know they will perform well tend to take these tests, creating a skewed distribution of scores.|$|E
25|$|Drawing {{from the}} {{experiences}} of the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-1871, a French artillery committee met on 2 February 1874 to discuss new models for the French fortress and siege artillery. Among them was a piece in the 14 to 16cm caliber range. After several meetings, on 16 April 1874 the committee settled on the 15.5cm caliber. In the subsequent program-letter of the committee, dating from 21 April, <b>the</b> <b>caliber</b> was for the first time expressed as 155 millimeters. (The other two calibers decided by this committee were the 120mm fortress and siege cannon and the 220mm mortar.) Three different 155mm prototypes were tested in Calais in 1876. The winner was Charles de Bange's model, and the French government ordered the first 300 pieces in November 1877.|$|E

5000|$|A {{positive}} {{consequence of}} the relationship between the [...]460 S&W Magnum, [...]454 Casull, and the [...]45 Colt is that bolt and lever action rifles and revolvers chambered for <b>the</b> larger <b>caliber</b> can frequently chamber <b>the</b> smaller <b>caliber.</b> <b>The</b> reverse, however, is not true and may result in firearm damage or bodily harm if attempted.|$|R

25|$|It {{would take}} another sixteen years before another player, Bernie Geoffrion, managed to score 50 {{goals in a}} single season, also while playing for Montreal. When Bobby Hull finally managed to break the season record with 54 goals in 1966, fans of the then-retired Canadiens legend, noting that Hull was playing in a 70-game schedule, demanded that the NHL {{continue}} to recognize Richard's record (similar to what Major League Baseball initially did with Babe Ruth's single-season home run record after Roger Maris broke it under similar circumstances a few years previously). Hull's fans countered that Richard had achieved his record during World War II (during which many NHLers enlisted in the military — Richard, who was notoriously prone to injury throughout his career, was deemed unfit for service) and argued that Richard's failure to match the record in peacetime, with <b>the</b> <b>caliber</b> of the NHL not similarly hindered even though he played in eleven 70-game seasons, compromised any right {{he might have to}} special consideration for the record on account of the shorter wartime schedule.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the first}} issues with its early {{acceptance}} and prosperity {{was the result of}} quality problems in consequence from rushed production to meet copious (some even defaulted) pre-orders of the pistol it was originally—as well as then being only—chambered for: the Bren Ten. An example being the peculiar circumstances surrounding the pistol's distribution at its primary release, leading to a number of initial Bren Tens sent to dealers and customers without magazines (the magazines themselves had complications). The relatively high price of the Bren Ten compared to other pistols of the time (manufacturer's suggested retail price in 1986 was U.S. $500 in that year's dollars) was another factor in its demise, and the company was eventually forced to declare bankruptcy, ceasing operations in 1986 after only three years of inconsistent, substandard production. Had it not been for Colt's Patent Fire Arms Manufacturing Company making the unexpected decision in 1987 to bring out their Delta Elite pistol (a 10mm Auto version of the M1911) and later, the FBI's adoption of <b>the</b> <b>caliber</b> in 1989, the cartridge might have sunk into obsolescence, becoming an obscure footnote in firearms history.|$|E
