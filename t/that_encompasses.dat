5|$|Character {{creation}} is done through a tutorial prologue <b>that</b> <b>encompasses</b> the different {{ages of the}} player's characters, which also covers tutorials on movement, the HUD, combat, interactions with the game world, {{and the use of}} the Pip-Boy 3000.

5|$|Matangi {{represents}} {{the power of}} the spoken word (Vaikhari) as an expression of thoughts and the mind. She also relates to the power of listening and grasping speech and converting it back to knowledge and thought. Besides spoken word, she also governs all other expressions of inner thought and knowledge, like art, music and dance. Matangi presides over the middle part of speech (Madhyama), where ideas are translated into the spoken word and in her highest role, represents Para-Vaikhari—the Supreme Word manifested through speech and <b>that</b> <b>encompasses</b> knowledge of the scriptures. She is described as the goddess of learning and speech, and the bestower of knowledge and talent. She is also called Mantrini, the mistress of the sacred mantras. She also {{represents the}} word of a guru, who serves as a spiritual guide. Matangi is described as dwelling in the Throat chakra—the origin of speech—and on the tip of the tongue. She is also associated with a channel called Sarasvati from the third eye to the tip of the tongue. According to David Frawley, her description as impure refers {{to the nature of the}} spoken word, which labels things and stereotypes them, thereby hindering actual contact with the soul of things. The goddess is described as one who helps a person to use words in the right way and to go beyond it to seek the soul and inner knowledge, which lie outside the demarcated boundaries of tradition.|$|E
