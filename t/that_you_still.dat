500|$|Davis {{was happy}} to have an episode of his own, but was puzzled {{at some of the}} contradictions in the script, such as having him assassinate John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr., but being {{concerned}} with something as minor as keeping the Buffalo Bills from winning the Super Bowl. Chris Carter said [...] "I had to speak with Bill several times; I spent hours with him on the telephone talking about the character, because the actor felt that the episode really made the character something that it wasn't. I tried to explain to him, as I think Jim and Glen were trying to express, that even if your mission in life is a destroyer, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>still</b> have some hope {{in the back of your}} mind that you can be a creator— and that this all of a sudden, this vanity, is his vanity. And we see that so clearly here and it makes him sort of a silly person".|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} day, Alice wrote a {{much shorter}} letter to Louis {{in which she}} looked forward to their meeting, and hoped that [...] "my letter did not distress you – but {{it is better to}} be quite honest about all one's feelings". Despite marital problems, Alice remained a strong supporter of her husband, being highly critical when his abilities or talents were not fully recognised. On 20 March 1877, Louis' father Prince Charles died, making Louis heir apparent. On 13 June the same year, Charles' older brother Grand Duke Louis III died, and Louis and Alice became the Grand Duke and Duchess of Hesse. Her continued unpopularity in Darmstadt, however, coupled with her mother not wanting her in England, caused strain, and she and her children spent July and August in Houlgate, Normandy, where Louis often visited them. She was hurt by her reputation in Darmstadt, and she became increasingly bitter towards it; Louis wrote in August 1877 expressing the hope that [...] "bitterness of the salt water will drive away the bitterness <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>still</b> feel against Darmstadt. Please my darling, don't speak so harshly of it when I come to join you – it would quite spoil my happiness at seeing you again." [...] Alice took Louis's letter to heart, responding: [...] "I shall certainly say nothing to you about Darmstadt when you come...I have no intention of saying anything unpleasant, least of all to you. You shake off anything unpleasant like a poodle shaking off the water {{when it comes to the}} sea – natures like yours are the happiest in themselves, but they are not made to help, comfort and advise others, nor to share with others the heat of life's noon-day or the cool of the evening, with insight, understanding and sympathy." [...] In response, Louis sent a letter that [...] "made [...] cry", and after this letter, Alice's letters to Louis were more encouraging, assuring him of his ability to make decisions by himself.|$|E
2500|$|The {{lawsuit was}} {{dismissed}} by judge Michele M. Fox on July 15, 2009. O'Brien said, [...] "I'm deeply grateful that the court's decision has vindicated the reporting in 'TrumpNation,'" [...] while Trump said, {{in regard to}} his net worth, [...] "We've proven our case. When you're worth over $5 billion or $6 billion and you've proven <b>that,</b> <b>you</b> <b>still</b> have to prove malice. The libel laws are very bad." [...] The trial {{had been scheduled to}} begin on October 13, 2009. Trump appealed the decision to dismiss the lawsuit, but an appeals court affirmed the decision in September 2011. Both courts cited Trump's lack of [...] "clear and convincing" [...] evidence as the reason for their decisions.|$|E

6000|$|... 'But {{certainly}} I will gratify your curiosity,' she resumed good-naturedly. 'It {{is really}} a compliment <b>that</b> <b>you</b> should <b>still</b> take <b>that</b> sort of interest in me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps {{you think}} I am come on purpose to quarrel with you, knowing Weston to be out, and <b>that</b> <b>you</b> must <b>still</b> fight your own battle." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you, Jane," [...] she said, [...] "I am engaged. I {{am glad to}} know, however, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>still</b> {{have one}} or two respectable friends." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Maraquita, I {{am sorry}} to find <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>still</b> persist in {{encouraging}} that morbid regret {{for the loss of}} one who cannot now be recovered." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{have you}} been doing since I saw you last?" [...] she asked. [...] "It seems <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>still</b> {{continue}} to lead a life of violence." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I'm {{surprised}} <b>that</b> <b>you</b> should <b>still</b> feel <b>you</b> {{ought to}} protect the man, and must try to convince <b>you</b> <b>that</b> he doesn't deserve it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have only}} been here a few weeks," [...] he said hurriedly. [...] "I never knew {{what had become of}} <b>you,</b> or <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were <b>still</b> here"-- ...|$|R
6000|$|CLEAVER. You {{mean the}} nine pounds. Your wits were {{sufficiently}} keen for <b>you</b> to remember <b>that?</b> And <b>you</b> <b>still</b> persist in saying you don't remember altering this cheque. [He sits down] ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>still</b> don't {{know where}} your friend gets his money?" [...] he remarked to Robert one morning, as they walked {{together}} through the village.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{trouble with}} you, Hugh, is <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>still</b> deceive yourself. You throw a glamour over things. You {{want to keep}} your {{cake and eat it}} too.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then we'll try {{to avoid}} them. All I require is <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>still</b> give the lad the entry of this house and don't {{interfere}} with me. You see I'm reasonable." ...|$|E
6000|$|EGO. [...] "'Europe {{feels that}} your Majesty is not old; and your Majesty's look (PHYSIOGNOMIE) shows <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have <b>still</b> the same force as in your thirtieth year.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I did not," [...] she admitted. [...] "Indeed, I'll {{confess that}} I was {{somewhat}} startled {{when you came}} in. You see, I imagined <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were <b>still</b> in Canada." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was just}} {{coming back to}} tell <b>you</b> <b>that</b> I loved <b>you</b> <b>still.</b> I was going to suggest <b>that</b> <b>you</b> took lessons from some good professional. And I found you gone!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Abdelm. No, Lyndaraxa; 'tis at last too late: Our loves have {{mingled with}} too much of fate. I would, but cannot now, myself deceive: O <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>still</b> could cheat, and I believe! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Never {{heard of}} the place in my life," [...] I {{answered}} cheerily. [...] "Till you mentioned it to-night, my dear fellow, I hadn't the remotest idea <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>still</b> owned property in England." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Remember, {{that she}} has her {{attachment}} to plead in her excuse; but dare {{you say to the}} world <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>still</b> remember, with gentle feelings, the man whom you stigmatize with such opprobrious epithets?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is hard indeed," [...] Myra said, [...] "that I {{should be}} so well and strong again, and <b>that</b> <b>you</b> should <b>still</b> be {{suffering}} {{for what you did}} for me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's well, Harry, <b>that's</b> well. And <b>you</b> didn't {{go in for}} {{a direct}} commission, then? I was in hopes, my boy, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> would <b>still,</b> in spite of everything, go into the Queen's service." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have had}} the keeping of {{a good many of}} my family jewels," [...] said he. [...] "I beg <b>that</b> <b>you</b> will <b>still</b> retain them as a small sign of my regard." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And if I {{should find}} <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>still</b> {{continue}} to play, {{and should have}} to separate you, will you move into your new seats pleasantly, and with good humor, feeling that I have done right about it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly not, {{provided}} <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>still</b> {{wished to}} do so, but I'm {{inclined to think}} you won't consider it necessary when you know what my attitude is. You must realize that a good deal depends on this." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Am I to {{understand}} that you have heard nothing more from Miss Yerba, either for or against her story? <b>That</b> <b>you</b> <b>still</b> {{do not know whether}} she has deceived herself, has been deceived by others, or is deceiving us?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, an antagonist, if <b>you</b> will. Confess <b>that</b> <b>you</b> thought--and <b>still</b> think--that I {{have been}} scheming {{to bring the}} Duke of Wessex to the feet of Lady Ursula Glynde, his promised wife." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Margaret, {{to come to}} {{the point}} at once, the fact is this. You must renounce any idea <b>that</b> <b>you</b> may <b>still</b> have of {{becoming}} my son's wife." [...] Then she paused.|$|R
6000|$|... "None at all, master. I know <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{mean not}} what you say, and hard words break no bones. I should have thought no more of it had you {{yourself}} not remarked <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were <b>still</b> somewhat hasty of temper." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was looking}} through the cellar-book before dinner," [...] the lawyer went on, [...] "and I see <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>still</b> have forty-seven and forty-eight, and a small {{quantity}} of two older vintages. Something {{ought to be done}} about those." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You don't {{see every}} one," [...] Hugh bravely laughed, [...] "and {{that makes it}} all the more charming that you did, and <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>still</b> do, see me. I shall really get Bardi," [...] he pursued, [...] "to go again to Verona----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now," [...] {{said her}} father, [...] "tell me, {{the pair of}} ye, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>still</b> mean to take one another for good and all; and on the {{strength}} o't you shall have another couple of hundred paid down. I swear it by the name." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am glad <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are <b>still</b> here," [...] he said heartily. [...] "Excuse {{me while}} I bathe and change. We will dine a little earlier. So far I have not eaten to-day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! Living soul is good," [...] said M'Leod. [...] "At {{any rate}} our little girl {{will be pleased}} <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are <b>still</b> {{interested}} in us. Won't you come down some day this week?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I did {{not think}} <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were <b>still</b> so young," [...] said the virtuoso. [...] "Should you live to my years, <b>you</b> will {{acknowledge}} <b>that</b> the vase of Bias was not ill bestowed." ...|$|R
