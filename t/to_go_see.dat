The whole town shows up to show their respects at the funeral. Worried about Tipi's state of mind in dealing with the man's death, Rei {{repeatedly}} tries <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>see</b> Tipi, but Shiona keeps preventing him from going to see her. Rei eventually makes it to the library, but Shiona merely tells Tipi that her parents, who she has been waiting to return, are dead and that she will always be alone. Enraged at Shiona's behavior, Rei gets her to leave the library and Rei stays with Tipi overnight. Rei and Tipi wake up the next morning to find that the town is under attack. When Rei leaves to investigate, he finds humans have infiltrated the town and are killing the townspeople.

25|$|After being {{reunited with}} old colleagues like Klein, Clem and Oscar, Judith becomes obsessed with freeing Celestine from her prison below Roxborough Tower. She and Oscar {{eventually}} head to Roxborough Tower {{after all of}} the Tabula Rasa end up being killed. When they split up, Oscar ends up getting attacked by Dowd (still alive, with pieces from the Pivot shoved into his body), who slices him up much {{in the same way}} that Oscar did to him near the start of the book. Judith arrives just as Oscar dies. After speaking with Dowd, Judith returns to the basement of the tower and frees Celestine, who then fights and defeats Dowd. Celestine tells Judith that she wants to see Maestro Sartori. Clem one night while helping the homeless finds Gentle and helps him get his senses back. Gentle heads off with him, and Monday tags along. Sartori meanwhile reveals to Judith (who still thinks he's Gentle) that he has impregnated her when she tries to get him to see Celestine. Judith tells him <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>see</b> Celestine. The real Gentle arrives shortly afterwards with Clem and Monday, and they head to Roxborough Tower, where Sartori has already met Celestine, who reveals that he was the child she bore when she was raped by Hapexamendios hundreds of years before. Gentle and Sartori do battle while the others help Celestine out of the tower.|$|E
500|$|Even if {{the subject}} of the film is political, Weingartner said, [...] "the whole idea of 'Edukating' is playful. The movie is full of jokes. And happiness. I read somewhere that kids laugh out loud more than 150 times a day. Adults laugh only 10 times a day. Well, I want people to laugh. I want people <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>see</b> the film and have fun." ...|$|E
500|$|Cole {{initially}} {{looked for}} original songs to {{record for the}} album, but said [...] "the songs being sent were pretty bad." [...] A writer from Vibe said Cole's decision to create a covers album was a marketing strategy to breed [...] "a connection between song and interpreter and between singer and audience" [...] and appeal to [...] "fans yearning for {{the good old days}} before they had to hire a sitter <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>see</b> a show". Cole later clarified she could not afford to record an album of original material, explaining [...] "we're doing a contemporary urban record on a jazz budget".|$|E

500|$|As {{with most}} episodes of The Simpsons, {{the music was}} {{composed}} by Alf Clausen and edited by Chris Ledesma. In a blog written by Ledesma, it was revealed prior to the airing of the episode that it would contain {{the use of the}} waltz [...] "Tales from the Vienna Woods" [...] by Johann Strauss II as well as a musical cue similar to the style of the main theme from the film Catch Me If You Can. The episode features several other references to popular culture as well. For example, Homer skips work <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>see</b> a film called Paul Flart: Water Park Cop, a parody of the 2009 film [...] In addition, there is a brief shot of the character Bender from the animated television series Futurama.|$|E
500|$|Several United States Senators {{screened}} the film. New Mexico Democratic Senator Jeff Bingaman and Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid saw {{the movie}} at its Washington premiere at the National Geographic Society. New Mexico Democratic Senator Tom Udall planned to see the film saying [...] "It's such a powerful statement {{because of the way}} the movie is put together, I tell everybody, Democrat or Republican, they've got <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>see</b> this movie." [...] Former New Mexico Republican Senator Pete Domenici thought Gore's prominence on the global warming issue made it more difficult to get a consensus in Congress. Bingaman disputed this saying, [...] "It seems to me we were having great difficulty recruiting Republican members of Congress to support a bill before Al Gore came up with this movie." ...|$|E
500|$|In his 1997 book Starlight, Starbright: The Early Tamil Cinema, Randor Guy {{described}} Kalidas as a [...] "crude experiment" [...] {{that had}} poor lip sync; when characters opened their mouths {{there was no}} sound, and when dialogue or song was heard, artistes remained silent. He said the public did not care about technical niceties and flocked to see the film. Film critic and journalist Kalki Krishnamurthy, in his review of the film for Ananda Vikatan, noted that he was awestruck by the costumes used. He praised Rajalakshmi's performance and her dancing but criticised her singing, saying that she had <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>see</b> a doctor to get her vocal chords fixed. The Tamil newspaper Swadesamitran printed a favourable review for Kalidas on 29 October 1931, two days prior to its theatrical release, where the reviewer, in contrast to Krishnamurthy's comments, appreciated Rajalakshmi's singing.|$|E

500|$|At the time, Warner Bros. had a {{deal with}} Inherit Productions, the {{production}} arm of Schwaid-Merenstein which was founded by manager Bob Schwaid (who worked for Warners Publishing) and producer Lewis Merenstein. Merenstein {{received a call from}} Warner Bros. <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>see</b> Morrison in [...] Boston and related how eight or nine producers had gone to hear Morrison thinking they were going to hear [...] "Brown Eyed Girl" [...] and [...] "it was another person with the same voice". Merenstein first heard Morrison play at Ace Recording studio and recalled that when [...] Morrison played the song [...] "Astral Weeks" [...] for him, [...] "I started crying. It just vibrated in my soul, and I knew that I wanted to work with that sound." [...] While Merenstein had been to see Morrison, [...] Schwaid had set to work on resolving Morrison's contractual [...] troubles.|$|E
500|$|Stacy Brooks, then-president of the Lisa McPherson Trust, stated: [...] "There's no {{way that}} this movie would be {{happening}} without Scientology's backing… This {{is one example of}} how Scientology insinuates itself in various aspects of the culture." [...] Mark Bunker characterized the film as a recruitment tactic for the Church of Scientology, stating, [...] "It's designed to introduce L. Ron Hubbard to a whole new generation of kids. It's there to plant a favorable seed in children's minds." [...] Bunker criticized the promotional methods of the film—instead of granting interviews about the film to the press, John Travolta went on a book tour and signed copies of L. Ron Hubbard's novel. Bunker stated, [...] "When Michael Caine goes around to promote The Cider House Rules, he doesn't tour bookstores and sign copies of John Irving's novel… Through the movie tie-in with the book, kids will send in the card to get their free poster, and eventually be introduced to Dianetics." [...] Scientologist Nancy O'Meara, at the time treasurer of the Foundation for Religious Freedom and currently treasurer of the Scientology-run New Cult Awareness Network, responded to Bunker's statement: [...] "Gimme a break… That's like saying people are going <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>see</b> Gladiator and then suddenly find themselves wanting to explore Christianity." ...|$|E
500|$|In July, Clark held {{another set}} of congressional {{hearings}} on the issue, attracting widespread media coverage. The hearings were tense with Clark, Kennedy, Javits, and testifying medical observers frequently clashing with Mississippi Senators John Stennis and James Eastland (both staunch segregationists), and Mississippi Board of Health officer A. L. Gray. Kennedy called child psychologist Robert Coles to testify on poverty's effect on children in the Mississippi Delta. One North Carolina doctor described [...] "an unwritten policy {{on the part of}} those who control the State to eliminate the Negro Mississippian either by driving him out of the State or starving him to death." [...] When Stennis and Eastland accused the doctor of committing libel against the welfare workers of their state, he invited them and other state officials <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>see</b> conditions for themselves, to which none accepted. On the second day of proceedings Secretary Freeman and Senator Javits got into a shouting match, with the senator arguing that the secretary should disregard local authorities' opinions, declare an emergency, and immediately supply food to the region. He remarked, [...] "We seem to be able to send airplanes to the Congo in a terrible hurry. We first heard of the desperation point of poor Mississippi Negroes 18 months agoand we are still hearing that there is starvation in Mississippi." [...] Kennedy openly expressed his frustration with Johnson administration officials' perceived inability to understand the extent of the Delta's problems and other bureaucratic complications, saying, [...] "It seems to me we are floundering around a great deal." ...|$|E

2500|$|One {{film that}} had a lasting {{impression}} on Panahi was Vittorio De Sica's Bicycle Thieves (1948).
