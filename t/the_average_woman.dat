These task force reports point out that in addition to unnecessary surgery and anxiety, the risks of more frequent mammograms include a small but significant increase in breast cancer induced by radiation.|$|E
25|$|Anguissola's {{education}} and training had different implications than that of men, since men and women worked in separate spheres.

2500|$|As {{president}} of the WCTU, the crux of Willard's argument for female suffrage {{was based on the}} platform of [...] "Home Protection," [...] which she described as [...] "the movement … the object of which is to secure for all women above the age of twenty-one years the ballot as one means for the protection of their homes from the devastation caused by the legalized traffic in strong drink." [...] The [...] "devastation" [...] she was referencing was the prevalence of violent acts against women committed by intoxicated men, both in and outside the home. Willard argued that it was too easy for men to get away with their crimes without women's suffrage. [...] The [...] "Home Protection" [...] argument was used to garner the support of the [...] "average woman," [...] who was told to be suspicious of female suffragists by the patriarchal press, religious authorities, and society as a whole. The desire for home protection gave <b>the</b> <b>average</b> <b>woman</b> a socially appropriate avenue to seek enfranchisement. Willard insisted that women must forgo the notion that they were the [...] "weaker" [...] sex and that they must embrace their natural dependence on men. She encouraged women to join the movement to improve society: [...] "Politics is the place for woman."

Identification relies on exogenous variation in schooling induced by a mandatory school reform rolled out nationwide in Italy in the early 1960 s.

25|$|Current {{biological}} {{research has}} suggested that testosterone differences can affect sexual orientation, gender identity, and personality. For example, girls with increased prenatal testosterone levels, due to congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), show more male-typed behaviors than <b>the</b> <b>average</b> female. This may cause a decrease in empathy levels, which is proven to be higher in <b>the</b> <b>average</b> <b>women</b> than men, and an increase in physical aggression, typically higher in men than women. Furthermore, multiple twin studies have also shown that homosexual traits displayed greater congruence in monozygotic (MZ) twins than dizygotic (DZ) twins displaying genetic contributions. Further studies reveal that {{this is especially true for}} girls' gender-typed values. Similarly, other studies have summarized that the prevalence of cross-gender behavior a highly heritable trait where MZ twins display the same cross-gender behaviors more so than DZ twins.|$|R
