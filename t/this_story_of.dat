5|$|These views {{informed}} {{his novel}} Quo Vadis (1896). <b>This</b> <b>story</b> <b>of</b> early Christianity in Rome, with protagonists struggling against the Emperor Nero's regime, draws parallels between repressed early Christians and contemporary Poles; and, {{due to its}} focus on Christianity, it became widely popular in the Christian West. The triumph of spiritual Christianity over materialist Rome was a critique of materialism and decadence, and also an allegory for {{the strength of the}} Polish spirit.|$|E

25|$|In 1932, Fitzgerald's wife Zelda Sayre Fitzgerald {{was hospitalized}} for {{schizophrenia}} in Baltimore, Maryland. The author rented the La Paix {{estate in the}} suburb of Towson to write <b>this</b> <b>story</b> <b>of</b> {{the rise and fall}} of Dick Diver, a promising young psychiatrist, and his wife, Nicole, who is also one of his patients. It was Fitzgerald's first novel in nine years and the last that he would complete. The early 1930s, when Fitzgerald conceived the book, were the darkest years of his life, and the novel's bleakness reflects his own experiences. The novel almost mirrors the events of Fitzgerald and Zelda's lives, as characters are pulled and put back into mental care, and the male figure, Dick Diver, starts his descent into alcoholism. While working on the book, Fitzgerald was beset with financial difficulties. He borrowed money from both his editor and his agent and wrote short stories for commercial magazines.|$|E

25|$|His first {{attempts}} at film direction had limited success, {{and he left}} Denmark {{to work in the}} French film industry. While living in France he met Jean Cocteau, Jean Hugo {{and other members of the}} French artistic scene and in 1928 he made his first classic film, The Passion of Joan of Arc. Working from the transcripts of Joan's trial, he created a masterpiece of emotion that drew equally on realism and expressionism. Dreyer used private finance from Baron Nicolas de Gunzburg to make his next film as the Danish film industry was in financial ruin. Vampyr (1932) is a surreal meditation on fear. Logic gave way to mood and atmosphere in <b>this</b> <b>story</b> <b>of</b> a man protecting two sisters from a vampire. The movie contains many indelible images, such as the hero, played by de Gunzburg (under the screen name Julian West), dreaming of his own burial and the animal blood lust on the face of one of the sisters as she suffers under the vampire's spell. The film was shot mostly silent but with sparse, cryptic dialogue in three separate versions – English, French and German.|$|E
25|$|In the 14th-century {{historical}} novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Hua Tuo heals the general Guan Yu, who is {{hit by a}} poisoned arrow in the arm during the Battle of Fancheng in 219. Hua Tuo offers to anaesthetise Guan Yu, but he simply laughs and {{says that he is}} not afraid of pain. Hua Tuo uses a knife to cut the flesh from Guan Yu's arm and scrape the poison from the bone, and the sounds strike fear into all those who heard them. During this excruciating treatment, Guan Yu continues to play a game of weiqi with Ma Liang without flinching from pain. When Ma Liang asks him later, Guan Yu says that he feigned being unhurt to keep the morale of his troops high. After Hua Tuo's successful operation, Guan Yu allegedly rewards him with a sumptuous banquet, and offers a gift of 100 ounces of gold, but Hua Tuo refuses, saying that a physician's duty is to heal patients and not to make profit. Although Hua Tuo historically died in 208, a decade before Guan Yu fought at the Battle of Fancheng, <b>this</b> <b>story</b> <b>of</b> him performing surgery on Guan Yu has become a popular artistic theme.|$|E

500|$|Overall, {{the reviews}} of the series were {{generally}} positive. Michael Conroy of GQ named Strike Back an [...] "Editor's Pick" [...] for its [...] "excellent cinematography, stellar performances and a surprisingly balanced global perspective makes <b>this</b> <b>story</b> <b>of</b> two former British SAS soldiers a thoroughly enjoyable action romp." [...] Conroy compared the series to Green Zone, The Pacific and the Call of Duty video game series. Keith Watson of Metro called the series a [...] "British action series that packs a Die Hard-style thrill around every corner." [...] Watson praised Armitage's performance, calling him perfect for the role, and that [...] "for once in a British series, the action scenes kick some proper butt." [...] John Preston of The Daily Telegraph stated that Strike Back was [...] "a slick affair, crisply directed by Daniel Percival, scripted with considerable sharpness by Jed Mercurio and full of belting action sequences." ...|$|E
500|$|By {{the late}} 17th century, when Tillemont wrote his Histoire des Empereurs, {{it was no}} longer {{possible}} to make the argument that Philip was a Christian [...] "ſans difficulté", [...] "without difficulty". And when Jean-Baptiste Louis Crévier wrote his L'Histoire des empereurs des Romains, jusqu'à Constantin in 1749, he affirmed the contrary, that Philip was not a Christian at all: [...] "...it is easy to judge what degree of credit ought to be given to <b>this</b> <b>story</b> <b>of</b> his penance; which, besides, is not fully and exactly related by any ancient author. To make out an account of it any way tolerable, they have been obliged to patch several evidences together, and to supply and alter the one by the other. The shortest and safest course is not to admit of a perplexed and ill supported narrative. We have no great temptation to torture history in order to claim such a Christian." ...|$|E

500|$|Roger Ebert, {{writing in}} the Chicago Sun-Times, awarded the film {{three out of four}} stars. He praised the [...] "convincing" [...] acting and [...] "realistic {{locations}} and terse dialogue" [...] but questioned the verisimilitude of the story and concluded, [...] "Body of Lies contains enough you can believe, or almost believe, that you wish so much of it weren't sensationally implausible." [...] Kenneth Turan reached the same conclusion in the Los Angeles Times, [...] "The skill of top-flight director Ridley Scott and his veteran production team, not to mention the ability of stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Russell Crowe, ensure that <b>this</b> <b>story</b> <b>of</b> spies and terrorism in the Middle East is always crisp and watchable," [...] he writes, [...] "but as the film's episodic story gradually reveals itself, it ends up too unconvincing and conventional to consistently hold our attention." [...] Lou Lumenick in the New York Post writes that, [...] "There's nothing here we haven't seen in many other movies" [...] and Lisa Kennedy in the Denver Post summarised: [...] "Body of Lies is an A-list project with B-game results. The movie might be set in the Age of Jihad. But the rules of trust and mistrust are wholly familiar." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from critics. Zack Handlen, writing for The A.V. Club, rated [...] "Tempus Fugit" [...] an A−. Handlen praised {{the effectiveness of}} the cold open, and noted the episode highlighted how [...] "particularly ruthless" [...] the series was with its recurring cast, noting [...] "the mortality rate helps to create a mood of ever-encroaching doom, as if the darkness that seems about to swallow Mulder and Scully in so many scenes ... is as much symbolic as it is literal". Paula Vitaris, writing for Cinefantastique, rated [...] "Tempus Fugit" [...] two-and-a-half stars out of four, describing it as [...] "gripping" [...] with [...] "lots of action". However, Vitaris felt that the fleeting use of guest star Scott Bellis was [...] "a waste", and that the discovery of an alien corpse towards the end [...] "robs <b>this</b> <b>story</b> <b>of</b> any ambiguity". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five, calling it [...] "the best conspiracy episode we've seen in nearly two years". Shearman and Peason felt that [...] "Tempus Fugit" [...] was [...] "told very clearly, with remarkably little baggage", and praised the acting of guests Tom O'Brien and Joe Spano. Twelve members of the show's post-production crew won the 1997 Emmy Award for Outstanding Sound Editing For A Series for their work on this episode; while four others received a nomination for Outstanding Sound Mixing for a Drama Series.|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{wrote it}} is [...] "an uncommonly good movie, {{entertaining}} and actually inspirational". Writing for Film Journal International, Doris Toumarkine praised its pace and how [...] "Atchison takes spelling competitions and conveys {{the excitement of}} the 'sport,' the appeal of the 'game,' the thrill of the win, [...] the crushing blow of the loss." [...] Hornaday from The Washington Post called the film [...] "a triumph on many levels" [...] and proclaimed, [...] "It's that nod to the collective ... that makes Akeelah and the Bee so special." [...] She especially appreciated that South Los Angeles was presented without stereotypes. Jane Clifford of U-T San Diego felt the film would appeal to both children and adults, and stated that every time she tried to predict its plot [...] "it took a sharp turn. A turn that leaves you facing your stereotypes and feeling a little sheepish." [...] Dana Stevens, writing for The New York Times, asserted, [...] "The innate suspense and charm of the spelling bee," [...] and [...] "a trio of crack performances" [...] can turn [...] "a formulaic sports picture" [...] into a [...] "tale that manages to inspire without being sappy." [...] Shantayaé Grant of The Jamaica Observer wrote that [...] "acting is spectacular, the emotions are real and <b>this</b> <b>story</b> <b>of</b> black triumph is simply phenomenal." [...] New York Press critic affirmed that Akeelah and the Bee [...] "resurrects a nearly lost idea of what an art-movie really is" [...] because it has [...] "dramatic attention to character and place, psychology and existence." ...|$|E
