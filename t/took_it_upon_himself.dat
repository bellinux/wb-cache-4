5|$|Filitti's death {{occurred}} {{shortly before}} a Romanian communist regime came into existence. He was {{survived by his}} wife and son. An aristocrats by blood and conservatives by conviction, Ioan C.'s descendants and relatives suffered heavily {{as a result of the}} new policies: the outspoken anti-communist Filitti-Robănești became a political prisoner, as did his cousin Puiu Filitti, who had been the King's Adjutant. Alexandrina Filitti was stripped of virtually all her land during the land reform and nationalization, but still forced to meet agricultural quotas imposed by the government; when she failed to do so, Manole Filitti <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>upon</b> <b>himself</b> to face the consequences, and spent some three years in communist jails.|$|E
5|$|It {{was common}} for Christie to greet a {{returning}} submarine at the pier, and to award decorations {{to the crew}} on the spot. This bypassed naval award boards, and annoyed Kinkaid and Lockwood, possibly because confirmation of sinkings was accomplished by Ultra, the reading of coded Japanese radio traffic, and news of awards given so quickly could constitute a security breach. Complicating the matter was the fact MacArthur awarded army decorations to naval personnel; like Christie, he <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>upon</b> <b>himself</b> to authorize the decorations rather than {{to go through the}} standard review procedures. These events compelled Kinkaid to forbid Christie to give pierside awards, and to keep Christie from recommending the award of army medals to navy personnel. These events would ultimately contribute to Christie's dismissal as Commander of Submarines in Fremantle.|$|E
5|$|Real Madrid's {{hardcore}} {{supporters are}} the so-called Ultras Sur supporters, or simply Ultras. They {{are known for}} their extreme right-wing politics, akin to Barcelona's hardcore supporters group Boixos Nois. The Ultras Surs have developed an alliance with other right wing groups, most notably Lazio Irriducibili fans, and have also developed an alliance with left-wing groups. On several occasions, they have racially abused opposing players and have been investigated by UEFA for doing so. Florentino Pérez <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>upon</b> <b>himself</b> to ban the Ultras from the Bernabéu and assign their seats to the general public. This decision was controversial with some of the Bernabéu faithful, however, as the lively atmosphere of games would suffer as a result. The Ultras have since held protests outside the Bernabéu and have demanded to be reinstated and allowed to enter the grounds.|$|E

5|$|The end of {{the streak}} came in March 1906. Ottawa and the Montreal Wanderers tied for the ECAHA league lead in 1906, forcing a playoff series for the league {{championship}} and the Cup. Montreal won the first game in Montreal by a score of 9–1. In the return match, Ottawa replaced their goaltender Billy Hague and used goaltender Percy LeSueur, formerly of Smiths Falls. In the return match in Ottawa, Ottawa overcame the eight-goal deficit, getting a 9–1 lead to tie the series by the midway point of the second half. Harry Smith then scored to put Ottawa ahead, {{only to have the}} goal ruled offside. It was then that Lester Patrick of the Wanderers <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>upon</b> <b>himself,</b> scoring two goals to win the series 12–10. This was Frank McGee's last game and he scored two goals.|$|E
5|$|Eager to {{add another}} {{franchise}} player to their team, the Rockets heavily pursued free agent center Dwight Howard in the 2013 offseason. He officially signed with the Rockets on July 13, 2013. Led by the new inside-out combination of Howard and James Harden, and with a strong supporting cast including Chandler Parsons, Jeremy Lin, and Ömer Aşık, the Rockets were expected to jump into title contention in the upcoming season. However, in the post-season, the Rockets were defeated {{in the first round}} by the Portland Trail Blazers, losing the series 4–2. Still, in the 2014–15 season, without Lin and Parsons but reinforced by Trevor Ariza, the Rockets started the season well, winning the first four games of the season {{for the first time since}} 1996–97, and winning each of their first six games by 10 points or more, the first team to accomplish this feat since the 1985–86 Denver Nuggets. While the Rockets had many key players miss time throughout the entire season, James Harden <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>upon</b> <b>himself</b> to keep the Rockets near the top of the conference, turning him into an MVP front-runner. He became the first Rocket to score 50 points in a game since Hakeem Olajuwon, as well as the only player in franchise history to record multiple 50 point games in a season. On April 15, 2015, the Rockets beat the Jazz to claim their first ever Southwest Division title and first Division crown since 1994, and by completing 56 wins finished with the third-best regular season record in franchise history. During the playoffs, the Rockets beat the Mavericks 4–1 in the first round, and overcame a 3–1 deficit against the Los Angeles Clippers to win the Western Semifinals and return to the Conference Finals for the first time in 18 years. In the Conference Finals, the Rockets were defeated by the Golden State Warriors 4–1.|$|E
5|$|With double-digits wins {{against the}} Lakers, Utah, Boston and Philadelphia {{to start the}} 2014–15 NBA season, the Rockets {{recorded}} a 4-0 start {{for the first time}} since they won their first six games of the 1996–97 season. By recording double-digit wins against Miami and San Antonio in their next two games, the Rockets won each of their first six games by 10 points or more, and became the first team to accomplish the feat since the 1985–86 Denver Nuggets. In December, the Rockets acquired Corey Brewer and Josh Smith, two veterans who added depth to the roster. While the Rockets had many key players miss time throughout the entire season, James Harden <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>upon</b> <b>himself</b> to keep the Rockets near the top of the conference, which turned him into an MVP front-runner. On March 20, 2015, Harden scored a career-high 50 points in a 118–108 victory over the Nuggets. Harden became the first Rocket to score 50 points since Hakeem Olajuwon scored 51 against the Celtics in 1996. On April 1, Harden scored 51 points in a 115–111 win over the Sacramento Kings, becoming the first player in franchise history to record multiple 50 point games in a season. On April 15, 2015, the Rockets won their 56th game of the season and finished with the third-best regular season record in franchise history. On that same night, the Rockets claimed their first ever Southwest Division title and first Division crown since 1994. In the playoffs, the Rockets beat the Mavericks 4-1 in the first round. In the Conference Semifinals, the Los Angeles Clippers built a 3-1 lead over the Rockets, before the Rockets won the last three games in the series to return to the Conference Finals for the first time in 18 years, this time against the Golden State Warriors. With their win over the Clippers, the Rockets became just the ninth team in NBA history to win a playoff series in which they faced a 3-1 deficit. In the Conference Finals, the Warriors won the first three games before Harden scored 45 points to win Game 4 at the Toyota Center. The Warriors then finished the series in Game 5, winning 4-1.|$|E

Had the Giants knelt on the {{subsequent}} play, there still would have been one second left on the game clock once the play clock ran down, requiring a fourth-down play to be run (the play clock at the time ran for 30 seconds; it now runs for 40).|$|E

The ostensible authority for the occupation was negotiated between Captain Eliot and the Viceroy of Liangguang, the Manchu official Qishan. The Convention of Chuenpi was concluded but had not been recognised by the Qing Dynasty court at Beijing. Subsequently, Hong Kong Island was ceded to Britain in 1842 under the Treaty of Nanking, when the territory became a Crown colony.|$|E
25|$|On 2 July 1816 Méduse {{ran into}} {{increasingly}} shallow water, both Chaumareys and Richefort ignoring signs such as white breakers and mud in the water. Eventually, Lieutenant Maudet <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>upon</b> <b>himself</b> {{to start taking}} soundings off the bow, and, measuring only 18 fathoms (ca. 32 metres), warned his captain. Realising the danger at last, Chaumareys ordered the ship brought up into the wind, {{but it was too}} late, and Méduse ran aground 50 kilometres off the coast. The accident occurred at a spring high tide, which made it difficult to re-float the frigate. The captain refused to jettison the 14 three-tonne cannons and so the ship settled into the bank.|$|E
25|$|Isaac Cline {{claimed that}} he <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>upon</b> <b>himself</b> to travel along the beach and other low-lying areas warning people {{personally}} of the storm's approach.

In fact, Cline's role in the disaster {{is the subject of}} some controversy. Supporters point to Cline's issuing a hurricane warning without permission from the Bureau's central office; detractors (including author Erik Larson) point to Cline's earlier insistence that a seawall was unnecessary and his belief that an intense hurricane could not strike the island.|$|E

25|$|However, Gustav Trolle {{was deemed}} a traitor to the country, and Gustav Vasa could not {{reinstate}} him. Instead {{he ignored the}} papal bull and <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>upon</b> <b>himself</b> to install Magnus without papal acceptance. Before long, however, Johannes Magnus rebelled by declaring his discontent with the Lutheran teachings spread by the brothers Olaus and Laurentius Petri, {{under the supervision of}} King Gustav Vasa. The King then sent him off to Russia as a diplomat in 1526. Johannes Magnus was careful not to return home during that time, realizing that he was unwanted. Gustav Vasa appointed a new archbishop, Laurentius Petri, in 1531, and Johannes realized that his time as archbishop was over.|$|E
25|$|The king let the Pope {{know the}} impossibility of the request, and the {{possible}} results if the Pope persisted, but – {{for better or worse}} – the Pope did persist, and refused to accept the king's suggestions of archbishops. At the time, incidentally and for different reasons, there were also four other unoccupied bishop's seats, where the king made suggestions to the Pope about candidates, but the Pope only accepted one of the candidates. Because the Pope refused to budge on the issue of Gustav Trolle, the king, influenced by Lutheran scholar Olaus Petri, in 1531 <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>upon</b> <b>himself</b> to appoint yet another archbishop, namely the brother of Olaus, Laurentius Petri. With this royal act, the Pope lost any influence over the Swedish Church.|$|E
25|$|Walker was {{not new to}} {{the world}} of business. Since his {{migration}} to Detroit he had been involved in several different projects.

Eventually, after being involved in the grocery business for several years, he <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>upon</b> <b>himself</b> to begin operating a grocery store of his own in 1846 which did not last. Following his work as a clerk, Walker was employed at the firm of Ingersoll and Kirby, a leather and leather goods business. Through this, he gained his first knowledge into the business world. By 1845, Walker saved enough money as a clerk to invest in a business, the firm of Walker and Parker, which specialized in tanning and leather sales. However, this partnership dissolved in 1846, and Walker returned to the grocery business. Eventually, the same tannery business that he invested in was burned down in 1848.|$|E
