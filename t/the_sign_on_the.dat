25|$|Clasico 61. Run over Rayados {{with six}} goals. On February 26, 2000, Tigres visited Rayados to their stadium. Tigres outplayed Monterrey and scored six goals. Rayados claimed {{that there was}} an {{irregularity}} with <b>the</b> <b>sign</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> contract of Osmar Donizete. The game was invalidated.|$|E
500|$|When {{it opened}} October 26, 1921, the 3,880 seat theater was {{promoted}} as the [...] "Wonder Theatre of the World". Capacity crowds packed the theater during its opening {{week for the}} First National Pictures feature <b>The</b> <b>Sign</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Door starring Norma Talmadge. [...] Other attractions included a 50-piece orchestra, famed organist Jesse Crawford at the 26-rank Wurlitzer theatre organ—"Oh, yes, it was mighty," [...] recalled Orson Welles— and a live stage show. [...] Poet Carl Sandburg, reporting for the Chicago Tribune, wrote that mounted police were required for crowd control. The theater's strategy of enticing movie patrons with a plush environment and top notch service (including the pioneering use of air conditioning) was emulated nationwide.|$|E

2500|$|For {{their first}} 30 years, until 2016, the Type 1 cars had roll-type, printed {{destination}} signs. [...] The Type 1 {{were the only}} MAX cars whose rollsigns were hand-cranked. Because of the time-consuming process to change the signs, only <b>the</b> <b>sign</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> exposed end of the car was changed to the correct destination. The side signs only listed the designated route color (such as [...] "Blue Line") rather than a destination, and <b>the</b> <b>sign</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> coupled end of each car in a two-car train was left blank. [...] A two-year program that began in October 2014 and was completed in September 2016 gradually replaced all of the rollsigns in the Type 1 cars (as well {{as those in the}} Types 2 and 3) with digital, LED-type destination signs.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout the 1920s, Talmadge {{continued}} to triumph in {{films such as}} 1920's Yes or No, The Branded Woman, Passion Flower (1921), and <b>The</b> <b>Sign</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Door (1921). The next year, she had [...] the most popular film of her entire career, Smilin' Through (1922) directed by Sidney Franklin. One of the greatest screen romances of the silent film era, it was remade twice, in 1932 with Norma Shearer, and in 1941 with Jeanette MacDonald.|$|E

2500|$|Frere-Jones' {{inspiration}} for the typeface came from time spent walking block-by-block through Manhattan with a camera to find source material, and he based the font on the lettering seen in older buildings, especially <b>the</b> <b>sign</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Eighth Avenue façade of the Port Authority Bus Terminal. [...] "I suppose there's a hidden personal agenda in the design," [...] Frere-Jones said, [...] "to preserve those old pieces of New York that could be wiped out before they're appreciated. Having grown up here, I was always fond of the 'old' New York and its lettering." ...|$|E
2500|$|Immediately {{after the}} UNGA vote, UN {{officials}} still opposed Palestinian efforts to independently change [...] "Palestine" [...] to [...] "State of Palestine" [...] {{in the formal}} name of their permanent observer mission. When they saw that <b>the</b> <b>sign</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Palestinian delegation's bench in the General Assembly Hall that used to say [...] "Palestine" [...] had been replaced with a sign reading [...] "State of Palestine," [...] they called for the new sign be replaced with the old one, stating {{that as long as}} Palestine is merely a non-member state, it cannot independently ask for its name to be changed on the sign on its bench.|$|E
2500|$|The {{competition}} continued between Ragsdale and Ball. Each day <b>the</b> <b>sign</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> station {{house would}} be changed, alternating between Meridian and Sowashee. Instead of compromising, the two founders began to lay out city streets with differing plans. One day {{one of them would}} drive stakes in line with his plan, and the next day, the other would pull up his rival's stakes and drive some of his own. Ball laid his streets parallel to the railroad, and Ragsdale chose to use true compass headings. The competition is still evident today in the angles at which some streets meet in the city. The intersecting area has been described as [...] "having been formed by some giant who playfully gathered up a ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{important}} features of every chart that the astrologer must give {{special attention to}} are {{the positions of the}} sun and moon by sign and house; <b>the</b> <b>sign</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> [...] ascendant, and the planet that rules that sign, called the ascendant ruler or chart ruler. Also important is the first planet to occupy the first, second, or third houses after the ascendant. Called the rising planet it will be particularly strong in the chart. If no planet occupies the first three houses, then a planet in the twelfth house close to the ascendant can be taken to be the rising planet. Planets that are in conjunction to (right beside) the primary angles of ascendant, midheaven, descendant, or IC (known as angular planets) must also be especially considered.|$|E

6000|$|So, {{with very}} little {{questioning}} or conversation on either side, father and daughter came to their destination and Alora found herself deposited in a small suite of rooms {{on the third floor}} of a grimy and dingy house in East Sixty-seventh Street--one of a long row of similar houses that were neither residences nor business establishments, but hovered between the two. There were several little tin signs nailed beside the entrance and Lory noticed that one of these read: [...] "Jason Jones. Studio. 3rd Floor." [...] It was an old sign, scarcely legible, while others beside it seemed bright and new, and when the girl had climbed laboriously up the three flights and the artist had unlocked the door at the head of the stairs, with a key which he took from his pocket, she found everything about the rooms she entered as old and faded as <b>the</b> <b>sign</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> door.|$|E
