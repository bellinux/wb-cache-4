The potential is then used to derive the thermodynamic properties of the system assuming thermal equilibrium.

In other words, the prisoner in question <b>must</b> <b>be</b> only partially accountable for his actions. And I think one can see running through the cases that there <b>is</b> implied ... <b>that</b> there <b>must</b> <b>be</b> some form of mental disease.|$|R

5|$|The {{compartmentalization}} {{allows the}} cell to prevent translation of unspliced mRNA. Eukaryotic mRNA contains introns <b>that</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> removed before being translated to produce functional proteins. The splicing is done inside the nucleus before the mRNA {{can be accessed}} by ribosomes for translation. Without the nucleus, ribosomes would translate newly transcribed (unprocessed) mRNA, resulting in malformed and nonfunctional proteins.|$|E

5|$|A Miranda warning is an {{explanation}} of a suspect's rights <b>that</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> given by law enforcement before interrogation. It stems from the 1966 Miranda v. Arizona case, and is based primarily on the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. If a defendant in custody is not notified of their rights via a Miranda warning, any confession they give may not be admissible in court. If a defendant is not in police custody, however, police are free to question suspects without informing them of their rights, and their statements may still be admissible.|$|E
5|$|A {{follow-up}} to , Battle for Naboo is a fast-paced, arcade-style action game. Each of the game's 15levels introduces mission objectives <b>that</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> completed to progress {{to the next}} level. Enemy aircraft are primarily composed of Trade Federation Droid starfighters and air mines. Ground defenses are more varied and include battle and destroyer droids, laser and missile turrets, Armored Assault Tanks (AATs), Multi-troop transports (MTTs), gunboats and Single trooper aerial platform (STAPs).|$|E

5|$|However, poison {{still exists}} as a murderous entity today, {{but it is}} not as popular form of {{conducting}} murder {{as it used to be}} in past times, probably because of the wider range of ways to kill people and other factors <b>that</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> taken into consideration. One of the more recent deaths by poisoning was that of Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko in 2006 from lethal polonium-210 radiation poisoning.|$|E
5|$|Most enemies will flee at {{the sight}} of the vehicle, {{eliminating}} the need for Batman to fight them, and enemies attacking the car can be subdued by its automated taser defenses. Like Batman, the Batmobile can be upgraded with new abilities. Riddler challenges also feature objectives requiring the Batmobile, such as timed races in tunnels beneath Gotham City, where the environmental obstacles change during each lap, and invisible question marks <b>that</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> revealed using the Batmobile's scanner.|$|E

5|$|The Cruachan station {{temporarily}} stores {{energy at}} times of low demand, and releases it {{at times of}} high demand, when electricity prices are higher, reducing the maximum power <b>that</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> provided by power stations.

Despite the use of some rainwater, Cruachan is not a net generator of electricity: it uses more energy for pumping water and spinning its turbines than it generates.|$|E
5|$|The Jedi Knight {{series is}} {{composed}} primarily of first/third-person shooter gameplay elements, {{with a number}} of variation on the norms of the genre within each game. All of the games use a level based system which contains a series of objectives <b>that</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> completed before the player can continue. From Dark Forces II onwards, the games have included lightsaber combat and the use of Force powers, which have been tweaked and modified as the series has progressed.|$|E

5|$|The Portopia Serial Murder Incident {{follows a}} first-person {{perspective}} and narrative. The various events are described with still pictures and text messages. The player {{interacts with the}} game using a verb-noun parser which requires typing precise commands with the keyboard. Finding the exact words to type is {{considered part of the}} riddles <b>that</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> solved. While sound effects are present, the game lacks music and a save function. It features a conversation system with branching dialogue choices, where the story develops through entering commands and receiving answers to them from the player's sidekick or non-player characters.|$|E
5|$|The game {{is filled}} {{with a variety of}} puzzles <b>that</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> solved to advance the story. These include memory games and mazes. Others involve {{competing}} against a computer-controlled opponent, completing a sequence in a limited number of moves, operating mechanisms, or using an inventory item. Puzzles do not all have to be completed in a precise order; there is some flexibility in terms of being able to move through game areas and work on different challenges.|$|E
5|$|There {{are four}} enemies: the Shellcreeper, which simply walks around; the Sidestepper, which {{requires}} two hits to flip over; the Fighter Fly, which moves by jumping {{and can only}} be flipped when it is touching a platform; and the Slipice, which turns platforms into slippery ice. When bumped from below, the Slipice dies immediately instead of flipping over; these enemies do not count toward the total number <b>that</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> defeated to complete a phase. All iced platforms return to normal {{at the start of}} each new phase.|$|E
