5|$|Curse of Enchantia was Core Design's {{first attempt}} in <b>the</b> <b>adventure</b> genre as {{they set up}} to compete with LucasArts and Sierra On-Line.

5|$|Development of D {{lasted about}} {{one year and}} was {{directed}} by WARP president Kenji Eno. Eno was heavily inspired by Polarware's Transylvania adventure game series and he believes D would have never been created {{if it were not}} for playing those games. Eno and WARP were still relatively unknown in the industry, D would be their first major title. With this in mind, Eno felt that he was gambling his development career on D, and if it were not successful he would stop developing games. There were three phases to Ds development: <b>the</b> <b>adventure</b> game structure, the story creation, and finally violence was added. Since <b>the</b> <b>adventure</b> gameplay was largely finished before the story began to take fruition, flashbacks were added to detail the plot. The plot was largely based on that of Dracula, but Eno found it too boring, and so added violence and cannibalism to make the game more striking. The FMVs were created using Amiga 4000s.|$|E

Noire.|$|E
