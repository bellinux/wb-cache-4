40|$|The {{crystalline}} phase evolution during {{firing of}} glass-ceramic materials from residual E-glass fibres was investigated {{as a function}} of temperature and time. The thermal stability and crystallisation mechanism were studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The mineralogical and microstructural characterisation of the sintered glass-ceramics was carried out by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), respectively. The crystallisation behaviour was depicted by the TTT (<b>Time-Temperature-Transformation)</b> <b>curve.</b> The activation energies for crystallisation were calculated by the Friedman differential isoconversional method. The results show that devitrification of the glass leads to a series of glass-ceramic materials composed of wollastonite and plagioclase s. s.

40|$|AbstractWe {{focus on}} a {{recently}} suggested approach to the calculation of critical cooling rates for glass formation. It is a “random parameterization” method that is guided by {{a limited number of}} isothermal scanning calorimetry experiments. However, several assumptions have been made in its derivation that may not mirror the actual crystallization behavior of most supercooled liquids, which may jeopardize the estimation of glass forming ability. We evaluate those assumptions and the applicability of the method is tested for lithium disilicate glass (which displays moderate internal nucleation rates) and dibarium titanium silicate glass (which displays very high internal nucleation rates, similar to those of metallic glasses). Both glasses nucleate homogeneously and exhibit polymorphic crystallization. Our calculations show that some overlooked variables, such as the sample geometry, nucleation induction-times, surface crystallization and the breakdown of the Stokes–Einstein/Eyring equation, have significant roles on the calculated <b>time–temperature–transformation</b> <b>curves</b> during heating experiments. We demonstrate that the proposed random parameterization method can only be used when a glass forming liquid that undergoes internal crystallization is cooled from above its liquidus to various test temperatures.

These concentrations were quite small at 650 degreesC, which is just below the bay temperature of the <b>time-temperature-transformation</b> (TTT) <b>curve</b> for the initiation of ferrite formation.

The average accumulation at the latter temperatures increased appreciably as a function of transformation time. After each heat treatment, there was considerable variation in Mo accumulation from one alpha:gamma interface to another and, to a lesser extent, from one region to another along the same interface. These higher Mo concentrations were deduced to have developed largely through volume diffusion of Mo, mainly through ferrite, to interfaces whose ledgewise growth had been interrupted by growth stasis.

The run-products with the same starting composition from E 3 -S 1 (3 °C/min) show a high reproducibility in terms of crystal shape, size, and amount (< 4 area%). This demonstrates that the crystallization path is not affected by the different heat treatment above the liquidus temperature, i. e. the time scale of structural re-equilibration (relaxation) and chemical rehomogenization are shorter than our experimental time scale. Possible chemicalheterogeneities on a length scale of several micrometers for R 100 and several hundreds of micrometers for B 100 can be removed at 1300 °C within 120 minutes. A heat treatment at 1300 °C for 120 minutes significantly reduces the amount of μm-sized bubbles, potentially responsible for the onset of nucleation and unreveals the intrinsic solidification of silicate melts.

The primary objective of this thesis is identification of reliable predictive indicators of glass-forming ability {{based on the measured}} thermophysical properties and intrinsic crystallization behavior of bulk metallic glasses. A number of bulk metallic glass-forming alloys having widely different glass-forming abilities are chosen for this investigation. All of the measurements are carried out using the noncontact high vacuum electrostatic levitation technique to avoid any heterogeneous nucleation effects from container walls or environment. The measured kinetic properties, viscosity, and free volume are found to have the most pronounced influence on glass-forming ability, while the thermodynamics show weak correlation with the trends in glass-formation. The glass-forming melts show orders of magnitude higher viscosity compared to pure metals. Among the glass-forming alloys, better glass formers have higher melting temperature viscosity, higher fragility, and show a smaller change in volume upon crystallization compared to poor glass formers. The melting temperature viscosity is correlated with volume change upon crystallization in accordance with Cohen-Grest free-volume theory {{for a wide variety of}} alloys. To quantify the glass-forming ability, <b>Time-Temperature-Transformation</b> (TTT) <b>curves</b> of a number of glass-forming melts are measured over a wide temperature range between their glass-transition and melting temperatures.

These include (a) diffusionless multiple-stage martensitic transformations and (b) diffusion-based phase transformations that govern the precipitation reactions in Ni-rich alloys and the overall <b>time-temperature-transformation</b> (TTT) <b>curves.</b> (2) The systematic study of the high-strain rate response of Ni-rich NiTi alloys as a function of temperature (between - 196 ⁰C and 400 ⁰C) and thermomechanical treatment, viz., fully annealed, work-hardened and precipitation hardened conditions. Two Ni-rich Nitinol alloys, a commercial 50. 8 - NiTi (at. %) and a new 55 -NiTi (at. %), were selected for the study, since the Ni composition determines the precipitation processes and, critically, the transformation temperatures in NiTi alloys. It was observed that the presence of dislocations (through work- hardening) and the presence of Ni-rich precipitates (through age-hardening) contribute to a more complex two- stage or multiple-stage transformations and also improve the overall strength of the NiTi alloy. Based on the microstructural changes, such as recovery, recrystallization and precipitation formation in 50. 8 -NiTi alloys, the current work uniquely provides a unified and general understanding of the various multiple-stage transformations reported in the literature, specifically providing the transition between two main transformation sequence mechanisms rationalized on the basis of partial differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) studies. Additionally, the work also identified unusual multiple- stage transformations in 55 -NiTi. Aging in Ni-rich 55 NiTi elicited precipitation reactions with the formation of Ti₃Ni₄, Ti₂Ni₃ and TiNi₃ in sequence. A time-temperature- transformation diagram for 55 NiTi was constructed, as well as the upper temperature limit of formation for several precipitates has been estimated for Ni-rich NiTi alloys system as a function of Ni concentration between 50. 6 - 56 at. %. Superelasticity and shape memory characteristics in Ni-rich 55 NiTi, thought to be unfeasible, have been successfully demonstrated with recoverable strains up to ̃ 4 - 6...|$|R
