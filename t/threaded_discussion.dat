500|$|Summaries {{of stories}} and links to news {{articles}} are submitted by Slashdot's own users, and each story becomes the topic of a <b>threaded</b> <b>discussion</b> among users. Discussion is moderated by a user-based moderation system. Randomly selected moderators are assigned points (typically 5) which they can use to rate a comment. Moderation applies either −1 or +1 to the current rating, based on whether the comment is perceived as either [...] "normal", [...] "offtopic", [...] "insightful", [...] "redundant", [...] "interesting", or [...] "troll" [...] (among others).|$|E
500|$|Slashdot Japan was {{launched}} on May 28, 2001 (although {{the first article}} was published April 5, 2001) and is an official offshoot of the US-based Web site. [...] the site was owned by OSDN-Japan, Inc., and carried some of the US-based Slashdot articles as well as localized stories. An external site, New Media Services, has reported the importance of Online Moderation last December 1, 2011. On Valentine's Day 2002, founder Rob Malda proposed to longtime girlfriend Kathleen Fent using {{the front page of}} Slashdot. They were married on December 8, 2002, in Las Vegas, Nevada. Slashdot implemented a paid subscription service on March 1, 2002. Slashdot's subscription model works by allowing users to pay a small fee to be able to view pages without banner ads, starting at a rate of $5 per 1,000 page views [...] non-subscribers may still view articles and respond to comments, with banner ads in place. On March 6, 2003, subscribers were given the ability to see articles 10 to 20 minutes before they are released to the public. Slashdot altered its <b>threaded</b> <b>discussion</b> forum display software to explicitly show domains for links in articles, as [...] "users made a sport out of tricking unsuspecting readers into visiting [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|Slashdot's editors are {{primarily}} responsible for selecting and editing the primary stories that are posted daily by submitters. The editors provide a one-paragraph summary for each story and a link to an external website where the story originated. Each story becomes the topic for a <b>threaded</b> <b>discussion</b> among the site's users. A user-based moderation system is employed to filter out abusive or offensive comments. Every comment is initially given a score of −1 to +2, with a default score of +1 for registered users, 0 for anonymous users (Anonymous Coward), +2 for users with high [...] "karma", or 1 for users with low [...] "karma". As moderators read comments attached to articles, they click to moderate the comment, either up (+1) or down (1). Moderators may choose to attach a particular descriptor to the comments as well, such as [...] "normal", [...] "offtopic", [...] "flamebait", [...] "troll", [...] "redundant", [...] "insightful", [...] "interesting", [...] "informative", [...] "funny", [...] "overrated", or [...] "underrated", with each corresponding to a −1 or +1 rating. So a comment may be seen to have a rating of [...] "+1 insightful" [...] or [...] "−1 troll". Comments are very rarely deleted, even if they contain hateful remarks.|$|E
40|$|Online {{dialogic}} {{communities have}} become a ubiquitous tool that transforms student learning and course delivery. <b>Threaded</b> <b>Discussions</b> extend classroom learning by providing an asynchronous method of communication for the exchange of meaningful ideas that promote critical thinking and develop thoughtful reflective learning. <b>Threaded</b> <b>Discussions</b> transcend the physical boundaries {{of the classroom and}} capitalize on distance learning opportunities. The benefits and limitations for implementing <b>Threaded</b> <b>Discussions</b> across the content areas, along with effective strategies and practical examples, will be explored. The digital era has brought about changes in the way students learn and dialogue with each other. Online course delivery systems, like Blackboard, have {{been at the forefront of}} this shift, and <b>Threaded</b> <b>Discussions</b> are one valuable way for students to learn and exchange ideas using technology. <b>Threaded</b> <b>Discussions</b> provide vir-tual learning connections which transcend class hours and provide a dynamic, dialogic learning environment where students reflect, collaborate and discuss real-world issues.

Although techniques such as semantic models and structural models {{have been shown to}} be useful in a number of areas, they are inefficient in understanding <b>threaded</b> <b>discussions</b> due to three reasons: (I) as most of users read existing messages before posting, posts in a <b>discussion</b> <b>thread</b> are temporally dependent on the previous ones; It causes the semantics and structure to be coupled with each other in threaded discussions; (II) in online <b>discussion</b> <b>threads,</b> there are a lot of junk posts which are useless and may disturb content analysis; and (III) it is very hard to judge the quality of a post.

50|$|News stories usually {{consisted}} of a summary of a recent discussion from a development mailing list (Linux kernel mailing list) followed by the entire contents of several messages from the discussion.

5000|$|It {{is common}} for new MediaWiki users to make certain mistakes, such as forgetting to sign posts with four tildes (...) , or {{manually}} entering a plaintext signature, due to unfamiliarity with the idiosyncratic particulars involved in communication on MediaWiki discussion pages. On the other hand, the format of these discussion pages has been cited as a strength by one educator, who stated that it provides more fine-grain capabilities for discussion than traditional <b>threaded</b> <b>discussion</b> forums. For example, instead of 'replying' to an entire message, the participant in a discussion can create a hyperlink to a new wiki page on any word from the original page. Discussions are easier to follow since the content is available via hyperlinked wiki page, rather than a series of reply messages on a traditional <b>threaded</b> <b>discussion</b> forum. However, except in few cases, students were not using this capability, possibly because of their familiarity with the traditional linear discussion style {{and a lack of}} guidance on how to make the content more 'link-rich'.|$|E
