We simulated single-particle diffusion in two dimensions in an arbitrary potential, V(r), based on summation of random and potential gradient-driven motions. Algorithms were applied and verified for detection of potential-driven diffusion, and for determination of V(r) from radial particle density distributions, taking into account experimental uncertainties in particle position and finite <b>trajectory</b> <b>recording.</b> Single-particle tracking (SPT) analysis of the {{diffusion of}} cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Cl− channels in mammalian cells revealed confined diffusion with diffusion coefficient ∼ 0. 004 μm 2 /s. SPT data fitted closely to a springlike attractive potential, V(r) =kr 2, but not to other V(r) forms such as hard-wall or viscoelastic-like potentials. The “spring constant”, k, determined from SPT data was 2. 6 ± 0. 8 pN/μm, and not altered significantly by modulation of skeletal protein architecture by jasplakinolide. However, k was reduced by a low concentration of latrunculin, supporting the involvement of actin in the springlike tethering of CFTR.

40|$|As a bluff object, a {{football}} experiences high aerodynamic drag when flow is laminar due to early boundary layer separation {{and a large}} low-pressure region. The length and depth of {{a football}}’s seams can influence the separation point by triggering a turbulent boundary layer at lower Reynolds numbers. Football manufacturers can control a football’s behaviour through careful design and material choice. However, assessing the aerodynamic performance of a football can be a lengthy and expensive process, traditionally requiring {{the use of a}} suitable wind tunnel. Measuring the drag force at varying Reynolds numbers gives a full aerodynamic profile which determines how the ball will behave during flight. Some studies have attempted to establish the aerodynamic properties of footballs using <b>recorded</b> <b>trajectories,</b> but these only ascertained average properties rather than a full aerodynamic profile. This paper describes a method which uses a series of <b>recorded</b> <b>trajectories</b> to calculate the full aerodynamic properties of a football. To assess the accuracy and robustness of this method, simulated trajectory data were used to which varying degrees of noise and aerodynamic lift were added. The assessment found that random noise does not affect the accuracy of the methodology significantly. At larger magnitudes, random aerodynamic lift makes the methodology ineffective (equivalent to ball spin > 100 rpm).

To achieve imitative behaviour, we have implemented a selforganizing connectionist modular architecture on a simulated robot. Motion tracking {{was used to}} gather data of human dance movements. When imitating the dance movements, the architecture self-organizes the decomposition of movements into submovements, which are controlled by different modules.
