5|$|Fictional {{accounts}} sometimes {{portray the}} rebelling slaves as ancient Roman freedom fighters, struggling {{to change a}} corrupt Roman society and to end the Roman institution of slavery. Although this is not contradicted by classical historians, no historical account mentions <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>of</b> the rebel slaves was to end slavery in the Republic, nor {{do any of the}} actions of rebel leaders, who themselves committed numerous atrocities, seem specifically aimed at ending slavery.|$|E
5|$|From {{the point}} of view <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>of</b> {{mathematics}} is to classify and characterize, the representation theory of the Lorentz group is since 1947 a finished chapter. But in association with the Bargmann–Wigner programme, there are (as of 2006) yet unresolved purely mathematical problems, linked to the infinite-dimensional unitary representations.|$|E

He promoted the use of eco-friendly chopsticks by requiring government officials and teachers to use their own reusable chopsticks when dining, expressing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>of</b> the campaign is to reduce the use of disposable chopsticks by 100,000 pairs per day.|$|E

5|$|Tony Soprano is seen {{emerging}} from the Lincoln Tunnel and passes through the tollbooth for the New Jersey Turnpike. Numerous landmarks in and around Newark and Elizabeth, New Jersey, are then shown passing by the camera as Tony drives down the highway. The sequence ends with Tony pulling into the driveway of his suburban home. Chase has said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>of</b> the title sequence was to show that this particular mafia show was about New Jersey, as opposed to New York, where most similar dramas have been set.|$|E
5|$|Notably, {{during the}} 1960s, the Soviet General Secretary Nikita Khrushchev asked the {{communist}} leader of Albania Enver Hoxha about giving autonomy to the minority, but this initiative was without any result. The autonomy question {{remains one of}} the main issues on the diplomatic agenda in Albanian-Greek relations, {{after the collapse of the}} communist regime in Albania (1991). Moreover, a certain degree of autonomy, based on the terms of the Protocol of Corfu, is the main objective of the organization Omonoia, as well as the Unity for Human Rights Party, which represents the Greek minority in the Albanian government. Such proposals were rejected in 1991 by the Albanian government, thus spurring Omonoia's radical wing to call for Union with Greece. In another incident, in 1993, Omonoia’s chairman was immediately arrested by the Albanian police, after explaining in public <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>of</b> the Greek minority was autonomy inside the Albanian borders, based on the terms of the Protocol.|$|E

25|$|Moojan Momen writes <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>of</b> {{achieving}} {{equality of}} women and men in the Bahá'í Faith does not amount to bringing women into power in masculine roles, but instead a more radical change to the very nature of society, to make feminine qualities more valued.|$|E
25|$|In 1955, the Air Force decided <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>of</b> Blue Book {{should not}} be to {{investigate}} UFO reports, but to minimize the number of unidentified UFO reports.

25|$|On September 17, 1983, she {{published}} {{a letter in}} the Swedish daily Dagens Nyheter where she explained <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>of</b> the Swedish school system, equal schooling to all, means that all pupils {{should be encouraged to}} develop their abilities. She also warned against repression of special abilities under the guise of elitism. This effectively ended the controversy.|$|E
25|$|In {{the oldest}} Buddhism this essentialism is not recognizable. According to critics it doesn't really {{contribute}} to a real insight into Buddhism:...most of them labour under the old cliché <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>of</b> Buddhist psychological analysis is to reveal the hidden mysteries in the human mind and thereby facilitate {{the development of a}} transcendental state of consciousness beyond the reach of linguistic expression.|$|E
25|$|On December 5, 2006 the Israeli {{government}} considered redeploying {{troops in}} Lebanon, {{without regard for}} the UNIFIL forces already in the country, if the Hezbollah-led protest succeeds in toppling the current Lebanese government.

5|$|The Poor People's Campaign was {{controversial}} {{even within}} the civil rights movement.

25|$|In its {{earliest}} days the intelligent design movement {{was called the}} 'wedge movement'. The wedge metaphor, attributed to Johnson, {{is that of a}} metal wedge splitting a log and represents using an aggressive public relations programme to create an opening for the supernatural in the public's understanding of science. Johnson acknowledges <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>of</b> the intelligent design movement is to promote a theistic agenda as a scientific concept.|$|E
25|$|Leon Trotsky said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>of</b> {{socialism}} in Russia {{would not}} be realized without {{the success of the}} world revolution. Indeed, a revolutionary wave caused by the Russian Revolution lasted until 1923. Despite initial hopes for success in the German Revolution of 1918–19, in the short-lived Hungarian Soviet Republic and others like it, no other Marxist movement at the time succeeded in keeping power in its hands.|$|E
25|$|Gladstone's early {{attempts}} to find a wife proved unsuccessful, with his being rejected by Caroline Eliza Farquhar (daughter of Sir Thomas Harvie Farquhar, 2nd Baronet) in 1835, and by Lady Frances Harriet Douglas (daughter of George Douglas, 17th Earl of Morton) in 1837. Gladstone published his first book, The State in its Relations with the Church, in 1838, in which he argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>of</b> the state should be to promote and defend {{the interests of the}} Church of England.|$|E
2500|$|When {{you use the}} {{language}} of [...] "fact checking" [...] {{to talk about a}} film, I think you're sort of fundamentally misunderstanding how art works. You don't fact check Monet's Water Lilies. That's not what water lilies look like, <b>that's</b> what <b>the</b> sensation of experiencing water lilies feel like. <b>That's</b> <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> piece.|$|R
50|$|However, it {{is clear}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>goals</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two systems are similar: by concentrating votes on one {{candidate}} or one election, they allow voters to represent the intensity of their preferences.

25|$|Tocqueville {{argued that}} {{domination}} via violent means, though unpleasant, {{is necessary for}} colonization and justified {{by the laws of}} war. Such laws are not discussed in detail; however, given <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>of</b> the French mission in Algeria was to obtain commercial and military interest as opposed to self-defense, it can be deduced that Tocqueville would not concur with Just war theory's jus ad bellum criteria of just cause. Further, given that Tocqueville approved of the use of force to eliminate civilian housing in enemy territory, his approach does not accord with Just War Theory's jus in bello criteria of proportionality and discrimination.|$|E
25|$|The {{nature of}} the {{relationship}} between human security and human rights is contested among human security advocates. Some human security advocates argue <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>of</b> human security should be to build upon and strengthen the existing global human rights legal framework. However, other advocates view the human rights legal framework as part of the global insecurity problem and believe that a human security approach should propel us to move above and beyond this legalistic approach to get at the underlying sources of inequality and violence which are the root causes of insecurity in today's world.|$|E
25|$|His most {{significant}} ecumenical achievement as CDF Prefect was the Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification {{signed with the}} Lutheran World Federation in 1999. Bishop George Anderson, head of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of America, publicly acknowledged that it was ‘Ratzinger who untied the knots’ when {{it looked as though}} the document would be shipwrecked by officials from the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity. Cardinal Ratzinger got the agreement back on track by organising a meeting with the Lutheran leaders at his brother’s house in Regensburg. Included in this agreement was the notion <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>of</b> the ecumenical process is unity in diversity, not structural reintegration.|$|E
