5|$|The Lipizzans endured several wartime relocations {{throughout}} their history, {{each of which}} saved the breed from extinction. The first was in March 1797 during the War of the First Coalition, when <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> were evacuated from Lipica. During the journey, 16 mares gave birth to foals. In November 1797, <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> returned to Lipica, but the stables were in ruins. They were rebuilt, but in 1805, <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> were evacuated again when Napoleon invaded Austria. They remained away from the stud for two years, returning April 1, 1807. But then, following the Treaty of Schönbrunn in 1809, <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> were evacuated three more times during the unsettled period that followed, resulting {{in the loss of}} many horses and the destruction of the written studbooks that documented bloodlines of horses prior to 1700. <b>The</b> <b>horses</b> finally returned to Lipica for good in 1815, where they remained {{for the rest of the}} 19th century.|$|E
5|$|Albert {{was seriously}} ill with stomach cramps in August 1859. During {{a trip to}} Coburg {{in the autumn of}} 1860 he was driving alone in a {{carriage}} drawn by four horses that suddenly bolted. As <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> continued to gallop toward a stationary wagon waiting at a railway crossing, Albert jumped for his life from the carriage. One of <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> was killed in the collision, and Albert was badly shaken, though his only physical injuries were cuts and bruises. He told his brother and eldest daughter that he sensed his time had come.|$|E
5|$|During the Croatian War of Independence, from 1991 to 1995, <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> at the Lipik {{stable in}} Croatia {{were taken by}} the Serbs to Novi Sad, Serbia. <b>The</b> <b>horses</b> {{remained}} there until 2007, when calls began {{to be made for}} them to be returned to their country of origin. In October 2007, 60 horses were returned to Croatia.|$|E
50|$|To {{insert the}} bit into <b>the</b> <b>horse's</b> mouth, <b>the</b> groom should {{stand on the}} near side of <b>the</b> <b>horse,</b> place <b>the</b> reins over the animal's head, and raise the headstall {{in his right hand}} while {{directing}} the bit to <b>the</b> <b>horse's</b> mouth with his left. If <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> refuses <b>the</b> bit, the groom should hold the bit against <b>the</b> <b>horse's</b> teeth with his fingers, and insert his left thumb in <b>the</b> <b>horse's</b> jaws. If <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> still refuses, <b>the</b> groom should press the animal's lips against his canine tooth, which should make <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> open his mouth.|$|R
50|$|By September 2008, <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> {{had become}} barely visible. The Devizes Millennium White Horse Committee were seeking funds to scour <b>the</b> <b>horse,</b> <b>the</b> {{scouring}} plans were passed to Probation Service Community Serive Group who thoroughly cleaned <b>the</b> <b>horse,</b> a task {{they have been}} doing often. As of August 2012, <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> is in need of repair again. The main threat to <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> is weeds, which often grow on <b>the</b> <b>horse.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{creation}} of <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> collar removed <b>the</b> previous physical restrictions the old harness {{had on the}} animal, and allowed <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> {{to be able to}} exert its full strength in plowing. Originally, the structure of the old harness forced <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> to literally pull its workload, <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> collar’s development instead allowed <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> to push its workload, increasing the efficiency of its labor output.|$|R
5|$|In 1960, the Canadian {{government}} protected <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> by law {{in their}} feral state. From the 1980s on, long-term, noninvasive herd {{studies have been}} performed, and in 2007 a genetic analysis was conducted that concluded the herd was genetically unique enough to interest conservationists. In 2008, <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> were declared the official horse of Nova Scotia, and in 2011, the island was declared the Sable Island National Park Reserve. The herd is unmanaged, and legally protected from interference by humans. <b>The</b> <b>horses</b> live only at Sable Island and at the Shubenacadie Wildlife Park on the mainland of Nova Scotia, with the latter herd descended from horses removed from Sable Island in the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|In {{the days}} leading up to the race, Secretariat was seen as the {{favorite}} to win by many; however there were doubts about him following a third-place finish at the Wood Memorial Stakes two weeks prior to the Derby. In the wake of Secretariat's loss, Angle Light and, in particular, Sham were <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> that were seen as the most likely to win the Derby, aside from Secretariat. Many sportswriters believed that <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> in the field possessed great speed and thought the course record would be broken.|$|E
5|$|Lieutenant Bush's twelve-man {{military}} police unit {{arrived at the}} site from Los Alamos on December 30, 1944. This unit established initial security checkpoints and horse patrols. The distances around the site proved too great for <b>the</b> <b>horses,</b> so they resorted to using jeeps and trucks for transportation. <b>The</b> <b>horses</b> were used for playing polo. Maintenance of morale among men working long hours under harsh conditions along with dangerous reptiles and insects was a challenge. Bush strove to improve the food and accommodation, and to provide organized games and nightly movies.|$|E
50|$|The age of <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> {{should first}} be determined. To do so, Xenophon directs {{the reader to}} look at <b>the</b> <b>horse's</b> teeth. If <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> has lost all of his milk teeth (making him older than five), the author {{suggests}} the reader not buy <b>the</b> <b>horse.</b>|$|R
50|$|It is {{important}} that the saddle be comfortable for both the rider and <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> as an improperly fitting saddle may create pressure points on <b>the</b> <b>horse's</b> back muscle (Latissimus dorsi) and cause <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> pain and can lead to <b>the</b> <b>horse,</b> rider, or both getting injured.|$|R
25|$|To shorten <b>the</b> <b>horse's</b> stride, <b>the</b> rider sits {{taller and}} lengthens the spine. He or she also {{performs}} multiple half-halts in rhythm with <b>the</b> <b>horse's</b> strides, using <b>the</b> restraining aids to ask <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> to engage <b>the</b> hindquarters, yet keeping the leg to <b>the</b> <b>horse's</b> sides to keep impulsion. The rider should not hold the aids or hang onto <b>the</b> <b>horse's</b> mouth when shortening. If the rider does not keep sufficient leg on, <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> will simply fall onto the forehand or {{break into the}} trot or walk.|$|R
5|$|Of <b>the</b> <b>horses,</b> eight made {{it safely}} to land, while the ninth had its leg broken while being {{pushed into the}} sea.|$|E
5|$|Options for {{population}} control include fertility control, ground and helicopter shooting, and mustering and trapping. None {{of the methods}} provide complete freedom from suffering for <b>the</b> <b>horses,</b> {{and the cost of}} each is very high. The costs include those that are economic, such as research, equipment purchases, and labour expenditures, as well as moral concerns over the welfare of <b>the</b> <b>horses.</b> As a result, more effective and efficient means of control have been called for.|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{studying}} <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> {{rate their}} body condition {{on a scale}} of one (excellent) to five (very poor), based mainly on estimated weight and muscle tone. <b>The</b> <b>horses</b> tend to remain in above average condition, despite the harsh environment in which they live, with stallions generally averaging better condition then mares. During severe droughts, the average body score decreases, but even then horses are found with moderate body scores and the entire population is never in very poor condition. The condition of <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> is directly correlated to rainfall, through a correlation to available forage, though temperature, distance between forage and water and individual energy expenditures also play a role. Studies during the 1990s found no evidence of equine disease among the population and few external parasites. Investigations of carcasses found four internal nematode parasites present (strongyles, small and large pinworms and Ascarids), as well as the larvae of botflys.|$|E
50|$|Self-efficacy {{is a way}} {{to assess}} {{themselves}} and <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> using a scientific method. Evaluating the health of <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> is important because <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> could easily get injured.|$|R
50|$|For example, the act {{of seeing}} a horse qualifies as an experience, whether one sees <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> in person, in a dream, or in a hallucination. 'Bracketing' <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> suspends any {{judgement}} about <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> as noumenon, and instead analyses the phenomenon of <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> as constituted in intentional acts.|$|R
25|$|The longe whip {{takes the}} place of the rider's legs, asking <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> to move forward or out. It is held with the tip low, {{pointing}} towards <b>the</b> <b>horse's</b> hocks, with <b>the</b> lash dragging on the ground. The whip is held in the hand that <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> is not going (so if <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> were going to the right, the whip would be held in the lunger's left hand). <b>The</b> <b>horse</b> is to accept the whip as an aid, and not be fearful. When the handler goes toward <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> to adjust equipment, the lash is caught up and the whip turned backward, under the arm, so that it does not interfere with <b>the</b> <b>horse.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Namib Desert Horses were {{originally}} forced {{to compete with}} domesticated livestock turned loose by farmers onto the same ground where <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> grazed. Due in part to this competition for limited forage, <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> nearly became extinct. However, they were saved {{in part due to}} the efforts of Jan Coetzer, employee of Consolidated Diamond Mine (CDM or DBCM), mining in part of Sperrgebiet. Garub was a station for the re-filling of steam locomotives until 1977, when diesel locomotives took over the route. <b>The</b> <b>horses,</b> who had previously survived on water pumped for the locomotives, were placed in danger when the pumping stopped, with several horses dying of dehydration. Coetzer petitioned CDM to supply <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> with water, which they did in 1980, installing holding tanks and a water trough. Between 1964 and 1984, population estimates ranged between 50 and 200 horses, but generally averaged 140 to 160. In 1984, an aerial count was made that distinguished 168 horses, while ground-based observations in 1988 estimated between 150 and 200 animals.|$|E
5|$|The Shortest Way {{with the}} Dissenters; or, Proposals for the Establishment of the Church is a {{pamphlet}} consisting of twenty-nine pages. It opens with the fable of the Cock and <b>the</b> <b>Horses.</b> The Cock, lacking any perch in the stable, {{is forced to}} rest on the ground and in fear of <b>the</b> <b>Horses</b> moving around and stepping on him, advises: “Pray, Gentlefolks! let us stand still! for fear we should tread upon one another!” The speaker then applies this to the contemporary situation, with the Cock representing the Dissenters.|$|E
5|$|To prevent {{overpopulation}} and inbreeding, and {{to protect}} their habitat from being overgrazed, <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> are managed by the National Park Service, the state of North Carolina, and several private organizations. <b>The</b> <b>horses</b> are monitored for diseases, such as equine infectious anemia, an outbreak of which was discovered and subsequently eliminated on Shackleford in 1996. They are safeguarded from traffic on North Carolina Highway 12. Island populations are limited by adoptions and by birth control. Bankers taken from the wild and trained {{have been used for}} trail riding, driving, and occasionally for mounted patrols.|$|E
50|$|Rarey {{began by}} tying one of <b>the</b> traumatized <b>horse's</b> legs with a strap so that <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> {{could not stand}} on it. This gave him control over <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> and quickly tired the animal out. Then, Rarey would gently but firmly cause <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> to lie down on a {{comfortable}} surface. Once <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> was lying on its side, Rarey could use his weight, concentrated at a strategic point, to keep <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> from rising. While <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> was thus unable to protect itself, Rarey showed it that it was still entirely safe with him by touching and stroking it on all parts of its body. The result was that <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> learned {{that it could be}} entirely safe in Rarey's company, and from that beginning it was relatively easy to demonstrate to <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> that it did not need to protect itself from most other humans.|$|R
5000|$|The {{process of}} {{training}} a guide horse is rigorous and takes about eight months for each <b>horse.</b> [...] Initially, <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> {{is trained in}} basic lead work, in which <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> is taught to move at the speed that the handler commands and to navigate common obstacles. Next, <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> is trained in voice command recognition, and taught to respond to 23 voice commands. <b>The</b> <b>horse</b> is then taught to maneuver around both stationary and moving obstacles. After this, <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> is trained to signal to the handler {{when there is a}} step or ramp. Finally, <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> is housebroken, generally an easy process because of horses’ natural aversion to depositing fecal waste indoors. Intelligent disobedience is a crucial part of the training of <b>the</b> guide <b>horse,</b> as <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> must be able to disregard any commands that would be unsafe to <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> and <b>the</b> handler.|$|R
25|$|When on the {{incorrect}} lead, <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> {{is usually}} left unbalanced. In this case, correct riding {{can make the}} difference in <b>the</b> <b>horse's</b> performance. Good riding can keep the legs positioned correctly enough so that <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> is still able to perform the turn. Poor riding will hinder rather than help <b>the</b> <b>horse,</b> and in extreme situations such as a tight turn at speed, <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> may lose its legs footing and fall.|$|R
5|$|Writing poetry was a {{means of}} passing the time for {{soldiers}} of many nations, and <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> of World War I figured prominently in several poems. In 1982, Michael Morpurgo wrote the novel War Horse, about a cavalry horse in the war. The book was later adapted into a successful play of the same name, and also into a screenplay, with the movie, released on December 25, 2011 in the United States. In January 2010, the History Channel aired a documentary entitled The Real War Horse, depicting <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> of World War I.|$|E

2500|$|Clear hoof polish may {{be applied}} before <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> enters <b>the</b> arena. <b>The</b> <b>horse</b> is {{thoroughly}} clean. <b>The</b> <b>horse's</b> saliva often forms [...] "foam" [...] about <b>the</b> <b>horse's</b> lips, {{which is generally}} considered to be a sign of <b>the</b> <b>horse's</b> submission and acceptance of the bit. Some riders believe that foam should not be cleaned off <b>the</b> <b>horse's</b> mouth before entering the arena due to it being a sign of submission. Conversely, some riders choose to wipe the foam from their horses' mouths prior to entering the arena, as foam can land on the horses' chests and legs. It {{should be noted that the}} presence of foam does not necessarily indicate <b>the</b> <b>horse's</b> acceptance of <b>the</b> bit, as certain metals such as German silver may cause <b>the</b> <b>horse's</b> salivation to increase without full acceptance of the bit.|$|R

5|$|Beginning in 1920, the Piber Federal Stud, near Graz, Austria, {{became the}} main stud for <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> used in Vienna.

5|$|By 1968, {{the wild}} herd were {{concentrated}} mostly on BLM lands owing to previous roundups {{and construction of}} boundary fences. That year, the BLM again stated its intention to remove the herds, {{this time with the}} possibility of returning a small number (either 15 or 35) to the range. In response to the new announcement, the Pryor Mountain Wild Horse Association (PMWHA) was formed with the goal of preventing the roundup, and began working in concert with larger organizations such as the International Society for the Protection of Animals. The BLM argued that <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> were being removed because they were likely to starve, as they had overgrazed their environment, while the PMWHA argued the degradation of the range was not due to <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> and that in fact they were in no danger of starving. The organization further charged that the BLM was acting at the behest of other state and federal organizations who wished to see <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> removed, rather than acting in line with public opinion. The PMWHA was also concerned with the effect that the penning would have on the feral horses.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, {{the high}} command of Nazi Germany {{transferred}} most of Europe's Lipizzan breeding stock to Hostau, Czechoslovakia. The breeding stock {{was taken from}} Piber in 1942, and additional mares and foals from other European nations arrived in 1943. The stallions of the Spanish Riding School were evacuated to St. Martins, Austria from Vienna in January 1945, when bombing raids neared {{the city and the}} head of the Spanish Riding School, Colonel Alois Podhajsky, feared <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> were in danger.

50|$|This {{position}} {{had serious}} problems, {{first and foremost}} because <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> was uncomfortable being hit in the mouth over every obstacle. The position also kept the rider's weight directly {{on the back of}} <b>the</b> <b>horse,</b> and pushed <b>the</b> rider behind the motion, sending his center of gravity behind <b>the</b> <b>horse's.</b> <b>The</b> weight on <b>the</b> <b>horse's</b> back, in addition to the upward pull on the head, made it impossible for <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> to round up in a natural bascule over the fence. The rider therefore interfered with <b>the</b> <b>horse's</b> jumping movement, making it more difficult (and sometimes painful) for the animal to clear the obstacle, and made many horses sour to jumping.|$|R
