50|$|The {{school of}} Habad Hasidism sought to {{articulate}} Hasidic philosophy in intellectual systemisation. This was {{exemplified by the}} aim of the 5th Rebbe, Sholom Dovber Schneersohn, that his yeshiva academies should study Hasidic thought with the logical method of pilpul, traditionally used in Talmudic study. In the Hasidic teachings of Habad, this approach was used by each Rebbe in their public discourses and talks, with each successive leader aiming to bring down the philosophy of Hasidism into greater grasp and articulation. The 7th leader, Menachem Mendel Schneerson typically addressed Hasidic philosophy most often in informal, analytical talks. This approach to Hasidic mysticism enabled it to study the integration of other aspects of Jewish thought, into the Hasidic explanations. In Hasidic terminology, it takes a higher spiritual source in divinity to unite opposing, lower opinions. In Hasidic thought, Talmudic legislation, midrashic imagination, rationalist descriptions and kabbalistic structures are seen to reflect lower dimensions of a higher, essential Divine Unity. This method was used by the 7th Rebbe to address the topic of divine providence. In a series of talks, translated and published in English, the Lubavitcher Rebbe addresses <b>the</b> <b>resolution</b> <b>between</b> the Hasidic conception of divine providence, and its previous formulations in medieval Jewish philosophy and kabbalah. It sees the views of Maimonides and others as part of the new conception of the Baal Shem Tov.|$|E

The effect of column temperature on resolution was studied at 32 °C and 38 °C instead of 35 °. All the other mobile phase components were held constant as described above. In all the deliberate varied chromatographic conditions (flow rate and column temperature), the tailing factor of Lafutidine was less than 1.30 and <b>the</b> <b>resolution</b> <b>between</b> any two peaks was greater than 2.0.

40|$|Abstract. As {{the higher}} and higher demand for image {{definition}} of flat-panel display (FPD), the minimum linewidth of pixel electrode, {{which is based on}} the Indium-Tin-Oxide (ITO) glass, has become narrower and narrower. The feature size of sub-pixel electrode has been narrowed from about 60 ~ 100 µm to below 20 µm in recent years. Hence the lithography technology has played a more and more important role in the fabrication of FPD. The laser projection imaging (LPI) technology can solve the problems obviously. In this paper, by using of the 351 nm XeF excimer laser projection imaging system we can obtain developed pictures at <b>the</b> <b>resolution</b> <b>between</b> 10 and 20 µm on the ITO glass. In addition, the relation graphs between 10 ~ 20 µm linewidth and the modulation transfer function（MTF）of the projection system are simulated and analyzed by the ZEMAX and MATLAB software.

In this application, the optimization of the analytical conditions with an experimental design was preferred to a univariate study. Therefore, a central composite design was used and the following factors were investigated and varied simultaneously: buffer concentration, buffer pH and dimethyl-beta-CD concentration. In order to evaluate the influence of each experimental parameter on the analytical separation, <b>the</b> <b>resolutions</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> four compounds, as well as the separation time and generated current were observed and established as responses of the experimental design.
