By April 2011, Wright and Cornish had {{completed}} three drafts {{of the script}} and Wright shot test footage for the film in July 2012. Pre-production began in October 2013 after being put on hold so that Wright could complete The World's End. Casting began in December 2013, with <b>the</b> <b>hiring</b> of Rudd to play Lang.

Additionally, emphasis was placed on the writing and atmosphere to compensate for the film's small $4.5 million budget.|$|E

30|$|<b>The</b> <b>HIRE</b> Act {{was enacted}} in 2010. However, {{it is hard}} to {{estimate}} its effects.

Al-Azhar University has long been regarded as the foremost institution in the Islamic world {{for the study of}} Sunni theology and sharia, or Islamic law. The university, integrated within the mosque as part of a mosque school since its inception, was nationalized and officially designated an independent university in 1961, following the Egyptian Revolution of 1952.|$|E

The town was finally abolished by the Miami-Dade Board of County Commissioners in March 2012.|$|E

5|$|In 1895, the Massachusetts {{legislature}} transferred {{control of}} the Boston police department from Boston's mayor to the governor of Massachusetts, whom it authorized to appoint a five-person board of commissioners to manage the department. In 1906, the legislature abolished that board and gave the governor the authority to name a single commissioner to a term of five years, subject to removal by the governor. The mayor and the city continued to have responsibility for the department's expenses and the physical working conditions of its employees, but the commissioner controlled department operations and <b>the</b> <b>hiring,</b> training, and discipline of the police officers.|$|E

The Romanesque revival church building, erected in 1855, had originally housed the Middle Dutch Reformed Church, and, from 1887, the Trinity German Lutheran Church. <b>The</b> <b>hiring</b> of Goldfarb and purchase of a new building helped revive {{the congregation}}, and by 1906 (its 50th anniversary) membership had doubled.|$|E

5|$|In {{the general}} {{election}} campaign, Fletcher attempted to make the expansion of casino gambling, rather than the merit system investigation, the central issue.

The gambling issue failed to gain as much traction as <b>the</b> <b>hiring</b> scandal, however, and Beshear defeated Fletcher by a vote of 619,686 to 435,895.|$|E
