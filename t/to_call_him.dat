5|$|Miller {{attended}} the selective Melbourne High School, where Australian test captain Bill Woodfull was his mathematics teacher. Miller was a mediocre student, which disappointed Woodfull; however, Woodfull quickly noticed Miller's cricket skills. Aged 14, Miller {{was selected for}} the school's first XI, scoring 44. His control and solidity prompted the spectators <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>him</b> The Unbowlable—Woodfull's own nickname. In 1934, Miller failed all of his subjects, scoring zero in his final exam for Woodfull's geometry class, {{and was forced to}} repeat the year.|$|E
5|$|When Wilson {{proposed}} {{establishment of}} a League of Nations, with the League's charter part of the Treaty of Versailles, Taft expressed public support. He was {{out of step with}} his party, whose senators were not inclined to ratify the treaty. Taft's subsequent flip-flop on the issue of whether reservations to the treaty were necessary angered both sides, destroying any remaining influence he had with the Wilson administration, and causing some Republicans <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>him</b> a Wilson supporter and a traitor to his party. The Senate refused to ratify the Versailles pact.|$|E

Oscar tells Pam (Jenna Fischer) and Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) that the Senator was hitting on him. Jim says Lipton was likely just schmoozing a voter, talks to Lipton himself, and also gets his number. Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) later gets Lipton's number as well, resulting in Oscar thinking that the senator {{may not have been}} hitting on him. When Oscar is leaving, Lipton shakes his hand and caresses Oscar's arm for long enough that Oscar once again believes Lipton was pursuing him.|$|E

5|$|As a captain, Jardine {{inspired}} great loyalty in his players, even if {{they did}} not approve of his tactics. Christopher Douglas judges that Jardine did very well to keep the team united and loyal on the Bodyline tour. He points out that team spirit was always excellent and the players showed great determination and resolve. Jardine particularly impressed Yorkshiremen who played under him, as they believed he thought about cricket in a similar way to their county colleagues. He became close to Herbert Sutcliffe during the Bodyline tour, even though Sutcliffe was sceptical about Jardine on the previous Australian tour in 1928–29. Hedley Verity was impressed by Jardine's tactical understanding and named his younger son Douglas after the captain. Bill Bowes expressed approval of his leadership after initial misgivings, and went on <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>him</b> England's greatest captain. Nevertheless, some players such as Arthur Mitchell who played under Jardine believed he was intolerant and unsupportive of players of lesser talent, expecting everyone to perform at world-class standards.|$|E

One of his friends stated that Fischer said Cisneros had offered him US$500 to get back with her daughter, but he refused. Fischer grew angry at Cisneros's insistence that he rekindle his relationship with Cristina and eventually called her and told her to stop. Once Fischer's senior year started, he began to date a new girl, Marianela Caballero of San Luis Potosí, Mexico. He invited her to the homecoming dance, but they did not date for their first semester because Marianela did not want any commitments. However, by the start of their second semester, they began dating. Around that same time, Cristina also started dating another boy. Fischer told his friends that he was fine with Cristina dating other men.|$|E

5|$|However, {{his career}} turned sour in a match against Victoria in January 1930. After {{contributing}} three not out in Western Australia's first innings of 187, Halcombe opened the bowling for Western Australia from the pavilion {{end of the}} Melbourne Cricket Ground. He delivered the first three balls to Clive Sindrey who took a single from the third ball. Leo O'Brien then faced Halcombe and umpire Andrew Barlow no-balled Halcombe six times in succession from square leg. One of the balls struck O'Brien in the hand and forced him to retire with a burst blister on the palm, while another went for four byes. After the first two no ball decisions, the Western Australian captain Richard Bryant conferred with Barlow, but when Halcombe resumed, the umpire continued <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>him</b> for throwing. After the sixth no ball, Halcombe threw the ball to his skipper in disgust. After another discussion, he bowled at significantly reduced pace and completed his over. Victoria took a lead of 22, before Western Australia compiled 311, with Halcombe scoring 10 not out. With Halcombe out of the attack, Victoria {{went on to win}} by four wickets.|$|E

Bird suggests that to get into Hawkins' laptop, they use a hacker they both worked with previously, right before he knocks out Michael, who wakes up in the red reality.|$|E
5|$|The 18th {{century was}} not a {{particularly}} prosperous time for the Inn or its members, and few notable barristers were members during this period. Some noted members include Sir Thomas Clarke, the Master of the Rolls, Sir James Eyre, Chief Justice of the Common Pleas and Samuel Romilly, a noted law reformer. In 1780 the Inn {{was involved in the}} case of R v the Benchers of Gray's Inn, a test {{of the role of the}} Inns of Court as the sole authority to call students to the Bar. The case was brought to the Court of King's Bench by William Hart, a student at the Inn, who asked the court (under Lord Mansfield) to order the Inn <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>him</b> to the Bar. Mansfield ruled that the Inns of Court were indeed the only organisations able to call students to the Bar, and refused to order the Inns to call Hart.|$|E

5|$|With {{the growth}} of {{scholarly}} criticism in the 17th and 18th centuries, fewer historians believed Philip to be a Christian. Historians had become increasingly aware of secular texts, which did not describe Philip as a Christianand which, indeed, recorded him participating as pontifex maximus (chief priest) over the millennial Secular Games in 248. Modern scholars are divided on the issue. Some, like Hans Pohlsander and Ernst Stein, argue that the ecclesiastic narratives are ambiguous, based on oral rumor, and do not vouch for a Christian Philip; others, like John York, Irfan Shahîd, and Warwick Ball, argue that the ecclesiastic narratives are clear and dependable enough that Philip {{can be described as}} a Christian; still others, like Glen Bowersock, argue that the sources are strong enough to describe Philip as a man interested in and sympathetic to Christianity, but not strong enough <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>him</b> a Christian.|$|E
5|$|Miller went to {{the local}} state school before {{transferring}} to Melbourne High Schoola selective government institution that accepted students through an academic examat the start of 1934. The school's emphasis on scholastic and sporting excellence and its culture was {{more in line with}} that of a private school than a standard government school. Australian Test captain Bill Woodfull was on the teaching staff as Miller's mathematics teacher.}} Because he did little study and focused his energy on sport, Miller was a mediocre student.Perry, p. 18. In addition to cricket and football, Miller played baseball and competed in swimming. This disappointed Woodfull, a disciplined man who invoked the school's motto Honour the Work in exhorting his students to work hard as Australia was attempting to emerge from the depths of the Great Depression. Despite being Australia's captain, Woodfull refused to involve himself in the coaching of the school's cricket teams, feeling that it would intrude on the responsibilities of the sports teachers. Despite this, Woodfull watched the students at cricket training and quickly noticed Miller's skills. Aged 14 and still under , Miller was selected in the school's First XI. With his pads flapping against his stomach and sporting a sawn-down bat, Miller batted at No. 6 and scored 44 on his senior debut. Although his lack of power was obvious, Miller's control and solidity prompted the spectators <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>him</b> the Unbowlable, the same nickname that was accorded to Woodfull, who had a similarly strong defensive style. Melbourne {{went on to win the}} match,Perry, p. 20. and Miller impressed his captain Keith Truscott, who fought for his selection and took him under his wing. Truscott later became an ace fighter pilot in the Royal Australian Air Force, and Miller would follow in his footsteps. Truscott's social influence compounded the distractions from Miller's study. Miller failed all eight of his subjects at the end of 1934, and with an average mark of 25%, was the class dunce. He scored zero in his final exam for Woodfull's geometry class,Perry, p. 21. and was forced to repeat year 9.|$|E
