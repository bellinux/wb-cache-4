5|$|Former ACT New Zealand Member of Parliament Muriel Newman filed a {{petition}} to have New Zealand schoolchildren be protected from political indoctrination by putting provisions that resembled those in the UK <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Education</b> Act.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} research, <b>to</b> {{determine}} <b>the</b> {{attitude of}} school directors <b>to</b> <b>the</b> multicultural <b>education.</b> <b>The</b> date of the research in the descriptive survey model was collected with <b>the</b> multicultural <b>education</b> attitude scale. <b>The</b> population of the research consists of the school directors which belong <b>to</b> public in <b>the</b> city of Kocaeli, and its sampling consists of 209 school directors which were appointed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> headship {{for the first time}} in 2009 - 2010 academic years.

5|$|During this session, the Native Hawaiian legislators {{attempted}} to pass new {{laws in the}} interest of the local people, who included Hawaiian taro farmers, patients of the Kalaupapa Leprosy Settlement and victims of the 1900 Chinatown fire, among others. In total, fifty-one bills were introduced in the Senate and one hundred and twenty-six in the House, although only nineteen bills were submitted by both houses for ratification. They proposed creating a governmentally funded education program for poor Hawaiian students similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Education</b> of Hawaiian Youths Abroad program initiated during the reign of King Kalākaua. A pension for the deposed Queen Lili‘uokalani and appropriation to repair the Royal Mausoleum of Hawaii were also proposed. They promoted the use and study of the Hawaiian language, especially in the government and courts. Ignoring the Organic Act which mandated the sole use of English in the legislature, this session was conducted in both Hawaiian and English with the aid of an interpreter. Many of the territorial legislators in this session did not speak English. They also created the first county bill, which would have created five counties named after former Hawaiian aliʻi.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{returning}} to Poland in 1784, Kościuszko was commissioned {{as a major}} general in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth Army in 1789. After the Polish–Russian War of 1792 resulted in the Second Partition of Poland, he organized an uprising against Russia in March 1794, serving as its Naczelnik (commander-in-chief). Russian forces captured him at the Battle of Maciejowice in October 1794. The defeat of the Kościuszko Uprising that November led to Poland's Third Partition in 1795, which ended the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth's independent existence for 123years. In 1796, {{following the death of}} Tsaritsa Catherine the Great, Kościuszko was pardoned by her successor, Tsar Paul I, and he emigrated to the United States. A close friend of Thomas Jefferson's, with whom he shared ideals of human rights, Kościuszko wrote a will in 1798 dedicating his American assets <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>education</b> and freedom of U.S. slaves. He eventually returned to Europe and lived in Switzerland until his death in 1817. The execution of his will later proved difficult, and the funds were never used for the purpose he had intended.|$|E
