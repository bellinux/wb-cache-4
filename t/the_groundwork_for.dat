5|$|Alternative rock is {{a diverse}} {{grouping}} of rock bands that in America developed {{largely from the}} hardcore scene in the 1980s in stark opposition to the mainstream music scene. Alternative rock subgenres that developed during the decade include indie rock, Gothic rock, noise rock, grunge, and college rock. Most alternative bands were unified by their collective debt to punk, which laid <b>the</b> <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> underground and alternative music in the 1970s. Though the genre {{is considered to be}} rock, some styles were influenced by American folk, reggae and jazz. Like punk and hardcore, alternative rock had little mainstream success in America in the 1980s, but via the grassroots establishment of an indie scene through touring, college radio, fanzines, and word-of-mouth, alternative bands laid <b>the</b> <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> the breakthrough of the genre in the American public consciousness in the next decade.|$|E
5|$|Attempts {{to create}} an all-Indian state named Oklahoma and a later attempt {{to create an}} all-Indian state named Sequoyah failed but the Sequoyah Statehood Convention of 1905 {{eventually}} laid <b>the</b> <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> the Oklahoma Statehood Convention, which took place two years later. On November 16, 1907, Oklahoma was established as the 46th state in the Union.|$|E
5|$|During his career, Martin {{has also}} served as a major {{influence}} {{in the development of the}} sport of curling, establishing the competitive tier in the sport and setting <b>the</b> <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> the management of curling teams and the creation of high-level competitive curling events. He is also known for contributing to the growth of curling, long known as a recreational and participant-based sport, as a spectator sport. Martin retired from competitive curling in 2014.|$|E

5|$|Following President Obama's {{announcement}} that the United States would move towards normalizing relations with Cuba, Pritzker traveled to Cuba. Although Obama's {{change in policy}} did not end the U.S. trade embargo, since ending the embargo required an act of Congress, Pritzker met with Cuban trade ministers and other officials to discuss the changing {{relationship between the two}} countries and to lay <b>the</b> <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> more economic involvement.|$|E
5|$|Following the 2008 election, Romney laid <b>the</b> <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> {{a likely}} 2012 presidential {{campaign}} by using his Free and Strong America {{political action committee}} (PAC) {{to raise money for}} other Republican candidates and pay his existing political staff's salaries and consulting fees. A network of former staff and supporters around the nation were eager for him to run again.|$|E
5|$|Knott's major {{shortcomings}} were in deterring crime. Despite the feuds {{that continued}} to rage in the state, {{including one that}} lasted several years in Rowan County, Knott refused to acknowledge lawlessness as a problem. Overcrowding of prisons prompted Knott to employ his pardon power liberally. The legislature approved {{the construction of the}} Kentucky State Penitentiary at Eddyville, but it was Knott's predecessor, Luke P. Blackburn, who laid most of <b>the</b> <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> this project.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} several complex transfer {{problems and}} their prospective solutions within an English-to-Swedish spoken language translation system. The {{emphasis in the}} text is on transfer problems which are not lexically triggered, concentrating mainly on the translation of differences in mood and tense. Laying <b>the</b> <b>groundworks</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> translation part, the treatment of verb-phrase syntax and semantics is described in detail. The paper also shortly discusses some lexically triggered complex transfer problems...|$|R

5|$|The {{final two}} weeks of the {{earthquake}} swarm were observed by a quick response cruise launched in August 1996. The National Science Foundation funded an expedition by University of Hawaiʻi scientists, led by Frederick Duennebier, that began investigating the swarm and its origin in August 1996. The scientists' assessment laid <b>the</b> <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> many of the expeditions that followed. Follow-up expeditions to Lōʻihi took place, including a series of manned-submersible dives in August and September.|$|E
5|$|The {{first season}} {{introduced}} main {{characters of the}} series, including Fox Mulder and Dana Scully who were portrayed by David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson respectively, and recurring characters Deep Throat, Walter Skinner and Cigarette Smoking Man. The season introduced the series' main concept, revolving around the investigation of paranormal or supernatural cases, known as X-Files, by the Federal Bureau of Investigation; it also began to lay <b>the</b> <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> the series' overarching mythology.|$|E
5|$|Weber {{abandoned}} {{research into}} Protestantism because his colleague Ernst Troeltsch, a professional theologian, had begun {{work on the}} book The Social Teachings of the Christian Churches and Sects. Another reason for Weber's decision was that Troeltsch's work already achieved what he desired in that area: laying <b>the</b> <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> a comparative analysis of religion and society.|$|E

50|$|The {{remains of}} a medieval rabbit warren were {{unearthed}} in 2004. when <b>the</b> <b>groundworks</b> <b>for</b> a new spa extension to the hotel were being excavated. An underground tunnel was found extending at least 100 metres beneath the main manor house garden terrace. The tunnel is intact as of 2004, but {{has not yet been}} fully explored. Earth bore tunnels of this type are sometimes associated with High Middle Ages abbeys, palaces, and castles as secret escape routes if the site were under siege.|$|R
50|$|Butter Project {{was created}} as a split from Popcorn Time when the latter met legal {{difficulties}} — with Butter Project aiming to retain development of only expressly legal and permissible portions of the code-base, relating to video-streaming. The developers have asserted Butter Project will not use any of the popcorntime.io infrastructure. Butter Project is not aimed at allowing copyright infringement, but aims to build <b>the</b> <b>groundworks</b> <b>for</b> streaming video over BitTorrent. By having a legal portion which remains on GitHub the creators hope they can get more developers involved.|$|R
5|$|Abu Bakar promuglated the Johor State Establishment Constitution (Malay: Undang-undang Tubuh Negeri Johor), {{drafted by}} Abdul Rahman Andak, on 14 April 1895. The state's {{constitution}} {{was seen as}} a turning point by many as a step in laying <b>the</b> <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> the administration of Johor. It was suggested that Abu Bakar, who was fearful of his possible imminet death in light of his failing health, promogulated the state constitution with the intent of preserving the state's independence in the light of growing British political influence in the Malay states.|$|E
5|$|According to a 2001 {{presentation}} {{that won}} top prize at a National History Day competition, an 18-year-old Topeka High School student John Freeman {{wrote that the}} Tuskegee Airmen, America's first black military pilots, helped lay <b>the</b> <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> the civil rights movement. The most prestigious award {{of the association of}} Tuskegee Airmen, which is presented at the Tuskegee Airmen, Inc. annual convention, was named 'the Brigadier General Noel F. Parrish Award' in his honor. For many years the award was presented in person by his widow, Florence. In recognition Mrs. Parrish received the General Daniel James Jr. Distinguished Service/Achievement/Leadership Award at the 2010 convention.|$|E
5|$|Air Vice Marshal Henry Neilson Wrigley, CBE, DFC, AFC (21April 1892– 14September 1987) was {{a senior}} {{commander}} in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). A pioneering flyer and aviation scholar, he piloted the first trans-Australia flight from Melbourne to Darwin in 1919, and afterwards laid <b>the</b> <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> the RAAF's air power doctrine. During World WarI, Wrigley joined the Australian Flying Corps and saw combat with No.3 Squadron on the Western Front, earning the Distinguished Flying Cross; he later commanded the unit and published a history of its wartime exploits. He was awarded the Air Force Cross for his 1919 cross-country flight.|$|E
40|$|In January 2007 a {{programme}} {{of archaeological}} investigation {{was carried out}} at Granary Wharf, Leeds (NGR SE 2975 3320) by Birmingham Archaeology for Scott Wilson on behalf of Isis Waterside Regeneration.

5|$|Ann Bishop (19 December 1899– 7 May 1990) was a British {{biologist}} from Girton College at the University of Cambridge and a Fellow of the Royal Society, {{one of the}} few female Fellows of the Royal Society. She {{was born}} in Manchester but stayed at Cambridge {{for the vast majority of}} her professional life. Her specialties were protozoology and parasitology; early work with ciliate parasites, including the one responsible for blackhead disease in the domesticated turkey, lay <b>the</b> <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> her later research. While working towards her doctorate, Bishop studied parasitic amoebae and examined potential chemotherapies for the treatment of amoebic diseases including amoebic dysentery.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} element in nation-building, {{the story of the}} heroic past, fell to such nationalist German historians as the liberal constitutionalist Friedrich Dahlmann (1785–1860), his conservative student Heinrich von Treitschke (1834–1896), and others less conservative, such as Theodor Mommsen (1817–1903) and Heinrich von Sybel (1817–1895), to name two. Dahlmann himself died before unification, but he laid <b>the</b> <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> the nationalist histories to come through his histories of the English and French revolutions, by casting these revolutions as fundamental to the construction of a nation, and Dahlmann himself viewed Prussia as the logical agent of unification.|$|E
5|$|His {{work on the}} Newtonian limit, {{particularly}} in relation to cosmological solutions, led Ehlers, together with his former doctoral student Thomas Buchert, to a systematic study of perturbations and inhomogeneities in a Newtonian cosmos. This laid <b>the</b> <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> Buchert's later generalization of this treatment of inhomogeneities. This generalization was {{the basis of his}} attempt to explain what is currently seen as the cosmic effects of a cosmological constant or, in modern parlance, dark energy, as a non-linear consequence of inhomogeneities in general-relativistic cosmology.|$|E
50|$|The Kassite {{language}} {{has not been}} classified. However, several Kassite leaders bore Indo-European names, and the Kassites worshipped several Indo-Aryan gods, suggesting that the Kassites were under significant Indo-European influence. The reign of the Kassites laid <b>the</b> essential <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> development of subsequent Babylonian culture.|$|R
50|$|The German-Israeli {{military}} cooperation was shrouded in secrecy {{for a long}} period, as such an entente was not seen favorably within Israel. However, this tight relationship, translated through arms deal and intelligence sharing, developed into solid trust and ultimately laid <b>the</b> necessary <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> establishment of diplomatic ties.|$|R
50|$|New Times was a {{short-lived}} intellectual movement among leftists in Great Britain. It was centred on the Eurocommunist {{faction of the}} Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB), and most of <b>the</b> intellectual <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> movement was {{laid out in the}} latter party's official theoretical journal, Marxism Today.|$|R
5|$|In 1925, the Taft Court laid <b>the</b> <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> the {{incorporation}} {{of many of the}} guarantees of the Bill of Rights to be applied against the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. In Gitlow v. New York, the court by a 6–2 vote with Taft in the majority, upheld Gitlow's conviction on criminal anarchy charges for advocating the overthrow of the government; his defense was freedom of speech. Justice Edward T. Sanford wrote the court's opinion, and both majority and minority (Holmes, joined by Brandeis) assumed that the First Amendment's Free Speech and Free Press clauses were protected against infringement by the states.|$|E
5|$|In {{accordance}} with his ideology, Arafat generally {{refused to accept}} donations to his organization from major Arab governments, in order to act independently of them. He {{did not want to}} alienate them, and sought their undivided support by avoiding ideological alliances. However, to establish <b>the</b> <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> Fatah's future financial support, he enlisted contributions from the many wealthy Palestinians working in Kuwait and other Arab states of the Persian Gulf, such as Qatar (where he met Mahmoud Abbas in 1961). These businessmen and oil workers contributed generously to the Fatah organization. Arafat continued this process in other Arab countries, such as Libya and Syria.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{greatest}} influences on Cantillon's writing was English economist William Petty and his 1662 tract Treatise on Taxes. Although Petty provided much of <b>the</b> <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> Cantillon's Essai, Anthony Brewer argues that Petty's influence has been overstated. Apart from Petty, other possible influences on Cantillon include John Locke, Cicero, Livy, Pliny the Elder, Pliny the Younger, Charles Davenant, Edmond Halley, Isaac Newton, Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban, and Jean Boisard. Cantillon's involvement in John Law's speculative bubble proved invaluable and likely heavily influenced his insight {{on the relationship between}} increases in the supply of money, price, and production.|$|E
