25|$|Papers are {{accepted}} on all viruses, irrespective of host species, but the modern journal's primary {{focus is on}} animal viruses. The journal content is divided by topic, rather than by <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>virus.</b> The journal publishes occasional special issues, including reviews-only issues in 2011 and 2013. From January 2013, recent content is available freely online after 12 months, with immediate free access to reviews and special issues. Virology also participates in a hybrid open-access scheme, so that authors can pay for articles to be available online without delay.|$|E
25|$|For the research, she {{isolated}} a rabies <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>virus</b> {{which produced}} mutant strains interfering with viral growth. Later, {{in her work}} with her husband at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, one of the vesicular stomatitis viruses (VSV) she studied made ribonucleic acid (RNA) from RNA instead of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), which did not follow the conventional central dogma: DNA RNA Protein. Her discovery of this VSV virion-associated RNA – dependent RNA polymerase led to Baltimore’s research on tumor viruses and {{the discovery of the}} enzyme called reverse transcriptase. This enzyme converted RNA to DNA, and became a major breakthrough in virology.|$|E
25|$|Astrovirus is a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>virus</b> {{that was}} first {{discovered}} in 1975 using electron microscopes following {{an outbreak of}} diarrhea in humans. In addition to humans, astroviruses have now been isolated from numerous mammalian animal species (and are classified as genus Mammoastrovirus) and from avian species such as ducks, chickens, and turkey poults (classified as genus Avastrovirus). Astroviruses are 28–35nm diameter, icosahedral viruses that have a characteristic five- or sixpointed star-like surface structure when viewed by electron microscopy. Along with the Picornaviridae and the Caliciviridae, the Astroviridae comprise a third family of nonenveloped viruses whose genome is composed of plus-sense, single-stranded RNA. Astrovirus has a non-segmented, single stranded, positive sense RNA genome within a non-enveloped icosahedral capsid. Human astroviruses have been shown in numerous studies {{to be an important}} cause of gastroenteritis in young children worldwide.|$|E

500|$|Specific {{immunity}} to viruses develops {{over time and}} white blood cells called lymphocytes play a central role. Lymphocytes retain a [...] "memory" [...] of virus infections and produce many special molecules called antibodies. These antibodies attach to viruses and stop the virus from infecting cells. Antibodies are highly selective and attack only one <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>virus.</b> The body makes many different antibodies, especially during the initial infection; however, after the infection subsides, some antibodies remain {{and continue to be}} produced, often giving the host lifelong {{immunity to}} the virus.|$|E

A joint CAS/CSIRO team using phylogenetic analysis found that the SARS Coronavirus originated within the SARS-like Coronavirus group carried by the bat population in China. However, note that they only served as the source of the precursor virus (which [...] "jumped" [...] to humans and evolved into the strain responsible for SARS): bats do not carry the SARS virus itself.|$|E

2500|$|Influenza, {{commonly}} known as the flu, is an infectious disease of birds and mammals caused by an RNA virus of the family Orthomyxoviridae (the influenza viruses). In humans, common symptoms of influenza infection are fever, sore throat, muscle pains, severe headache, coughing, and weakness and fatigue. In more serious cases, influenza causes pneumonia, which can be fatal, particularly in young children and the elderly. While sometimes confused with the common cold, influenza is a much more severe disease and is caused by a different <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>virus.</b> Although nausea and vomiting can be produced, especially in children, these symptoms are more characteristic of the unrelated gastroenteritis, which is sometimes called [...] "stomach flu" [...] or [...] "24-hour flu." ...|$|E

2500|$|The virus {{responsible}} for the initial outbreak, first thought to be Marburg virus, was later identified as a new <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>virus</b> related to marburgviruses. Virus strain samples isolated from both outbreaks were named as the [...] "Ebola virus" [...] after the Ebola River, located near the originally identified viral outbreak site in Zaire. Reports conflict about who initially coined the name: either Karl Johnson of the American CDC team or Belgian researchers. Subsequently, {{a number of other}} cases were reported, almost all centered on the Yambuku mission hospital or having close contact with another case. 318 cases and 280 deaths (an 88 percent fatality rate) occurred in Zaire. Although it was assumed that the two outbreaks were connected, scientists later realized that they were caused by two distinct ebolaviruses, SUDV and EBOV. The Zaire outbreak was contained {{with the help of the}} World Health Organization and transport from the Congolese air force, by quarantining villagers, sterilizing medical equipment, and providing protective clothing.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{infected}} was {{registered in}} San Diego, California on April 2, {{but it was}} missclassed as an H2N3 case. It was not until April 13, with the first death in Oaxaca, that further research was carried out, officially detecting the new <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>virus</b> on April 16. The pandemic outbreak was first detected in the Federal District, where surveillance began picking up a surge in cases of influenza-like illness starting on March 18. The surge was assumed by authorities to be [...] "late-season flu" [...] (which usually coincides with a mild Influenzavirus B peak) until April 21, when a CDC alert concerning two isolated cases of a novel swine flu {{was reported in the}} media (see 2009 swine flu outbreak in the United States). [...] Both cases were in US counties on the Mexico – United States border, adjacent to one state in Mexico where the influenza surge had been detected. This was the missing link that connected the surge and the new strain, and established the high suspicion of an outbreak. One study estimated {{that by the end of}} April, at least 113,000 to 375,000 people in Mexico had been infected. Then, in early May, influenza activity began to decline, likely due to the shutdown of most public places in response to the outbreak. However, H1N1 remains present in Mexico, and as of December, was classified by WHO as widespread.|$|E
