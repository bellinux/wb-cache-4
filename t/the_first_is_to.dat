5|$|Each Senator has {{at least}} one {{standing}} committee assignment. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> one of the four legislative committees: Budget and Taxation; Education, Health, and Environmental Affairs (listed in this table as Education, Health, and Environment); Finance; or Judicial Proceedings. A number of Senators have secondary committee assignments, most prominently to the Executive Nominations Committee, which oversees the constitutional responsibility of the Senate to approve nominations by the Governor. Assignment to the Rules or Executive Nominations committees or to any Ad Hoc committees is not noted.|$|E
5|$|The {{story was}} {{conceived}} around a protagonist whose abilities {{can not be}} measured through standardized evaluation; as such, he is mistakenly categorized as a poor performing student or an irregular. This premise served as a basis for the character, Tatsuya Shiba. Satō has two processes for scripting the story arcs: <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> create scenarios to have characters behave and interact in certain ways; the second is to plan a scene, then script the story so it leads to that scene. Satō professed that he does not feel his characters are alive or have a will of their own when scripting them.|$|E
5|$|The Silver Line has {{two primary}} goals. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> link Washington, D.C. by rail to Washington Dulles International Airport and the edge cities of Tysons Corner, Reston, Herndon, and Ashburn. The second is to spur urban {{development}} in Tysons Corner and reduce overall reliance on highway {{traffic in the}} business district, Virginia's largest and the 12th-largest in the country. The district's area is comparable in size to downtown Washington, D.C., but is rather insulated from its surrounding neighborhoods and has no existing grid pattern in its streets. The Silver Line would also improve public access to the Udvar-Hazy Center, an annex of National Air and Space Museum located near Dulles Airport; Virginia Regional Transit currently runs a shuttle bus {{from the airport to}} Udvar-Hazy.|$|E

25|$|There are {{two basic}} ways to reduce random error in an {{epidemiological}} study. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> increase the sample size of the study.

25|$|Skin {{friction}} {{is caused}} by viscous drag in the boundary layer around the object. There {{are two ways to}} decrease skin friction: <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> shape the moving body so that smooth flow is possible, like an airfoil. The second method is to decrease the length and cross-section of the moving object as much as is practicable.|$|E
25|$|A common {{error is}} {{to attempt to}} use a delete {{expression}} to delete the object. This results in the wrong operator delete function being called. Dewhurst recommends two strategies for avoiding this error. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> ensure that any custom allocators rely upon the Standard C++ library's global, non-placement, operator new, and are thus nothing more than simple wrappers around the C++ library's memory management. The second is to create new and delete functions for individual classes, and customize memory management via class function members rather than by using the placement syntax.|$|E
25|$|The {{scanning}} tunneling microscope {{can remove}} SAM molecules in many different ways. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> remove them mechanically by dragging the tip across the substrate surface. This {{is not the most}} desired technique as these tips are expensive and dragging them causes a lot of wear and reduction of the tip quality. The second way is to degrade or desorb the SAM molecules by shooting them with an electron beam. The {{scanning tunneling microscope}} can also remove SAMs by field desorption and field enhanced surface diffusion.|$|E

25|$|Mexican artesanía is sold {{to foreigners}} in two ways. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> tourists, as Mexican {{handmade}} items {{is part of}} what makes the country attractive to foreign visitors. The second is through exports. Mexican artesanía is widely sold outside of Mexico, especially through the Internet. However, there is no single marketing entity or corporation whose business is to export Mexican artesanía in general. Exporting is mostly done by investments in a particular crafts by particular people, rather than a large scale promotion of Mexican crafts in general.|$|E
25|$|Power to gas is a {{technology}} which converts electrical {{power to a}} gas fuel. There are 2 methods, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> use the electricity for water splitting and inject the resulting hydrogen into the natural gas grid. The second (less efficient) method is used to convert carbon dioxide and water to methane, (see natural gas) using electrolysis and the Sabatier reaction. The excess power or off peak power generated by wind generators or solar arrays is then used for load balancing in the energy grid. Using the existing natural gas system for hydrogen Fuel cell maker Hydrogenics and natural gas distributor Enbridge have teamed up to develop such a power to gas system in Canada.|$|E

The second key project is transforming education from rote learning to creative thinking and engagement. He helped open the School Teixeira in Porto Velho.

25|$|The Unit {{was founded}} in January 2008 and is a {{collaborative}} venture between the University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Trust and Lancaster University. It is funded by the UK National Health Service through the National Institute for Health Research. The unit has two aims. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> conduct research in patient safety. The second {{is to make sure}} that the unit's findings are used in practice, to improve the welfare of people in North Lancashire and South Cumbria and throughout the National Health Service. In June 2010 the Unit's director, Professor Andrew Smith, helped launch The Helsinki Declaration for Patient Safety in Anaesthesiology, a practical manifesto aimed at improving the safety of anaesthesia care throughout Europe. He is now part of a joint European Society of Anaesthesiology/European Board of Anaesthesiology Task Force overseeing the implementation of the Declaration.|$|E
25|$|Applications whose goal is {{to create}} a system that generalizes well to unseen examples, face the {{possibility}} of over-training. This arises in convoluted or over-specified systems when the capacity of the network significantly exceeds the needed free parameters. Two approaches address over-training. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> use cross-validation and similar techniques to check for the presence of over-training and optimally select hyperparameters to minimize the generalization error. The second is to use some form of regularization. This concept emerges in a probabilistic (Bayesian) framework, where regularization can be performed by selecting a larger prior probability over simpler models; but also in statistical learning theory, where the {{goal is to}} minimize over two quantities: the 'empirical risk' and the 'structural risk', which roughly corresponds to the error over the training set and the predicted error in unseen data due to overfitting.|$|E
25|$|A {{narrow road}} runs east {{from the village}} of Ennerdale Bridge, giving access to a pair of car parks near the outflow of the lake. Two {{principal}} alternatives are available from here to climb Crag Fell. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> loosely follow the course of Ben Gill up beside the plantation, before swinging left toward the summit. A more interesting route is to use the lakeshore path to reach the top of Anglers Crag, before working up the hillside to turn Revelin Crag to the west. This takes the walker past what Wainwright called the Crag Fell Pinnacles, a fractured spine of rock rising 80ft above the angle of the slope. Other ascents can be made from the Coldfell Road, south of Ennerdale Bridge. A track, formerly the mine road, can be followed almost to the summit, passing over the flanks of Grike. A circuit of the upper Calder, taking in the whole Lank Rigg group can also be started from here.|$|E
