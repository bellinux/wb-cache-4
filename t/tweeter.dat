5|$|As a {{three-way}} loudspeaker system employing six individual drive units, each Isobarik kabinet has two tweeters, two midrange drivers and two woofers. One driver of each frequency range faces forward; a second <b>tweeter</b> and midrange are {{mounted on the}} top surface of the enclosure, and one bass unit is hidden from view. While the bass units are isobaric loaded, the midrange is mounted in a terminated transmission line. Crossover points are set at 375Hz between the woofer and midrange, and 3kHz between the <b>tweeter</b> and midrange. The upward-firing drivers were designed to aid dispersion and improve the off-axis listening experience.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the speaker}} uses bought-in drivers, {{they have been}} rebuilt using {{stronger}} materials. Drivers' metal baskets are treated to reduce the effects of vibration, and the enclosure designed and constructed to control energy. The drive units (T27, B110 and B139) were sourced from KEF in kit form, and two KEFKIT3 kits were judiciously used for each cabinet. However, Linn found the T27 <b>tweeter</b> too fragile {{and replaced it with}} the more robust and better-sounding D2008 from Scan-Speak after a very short run; the Scan-Speak <b>tweeter</b> was later changed to a Linn D20-LP-1, sourced from Hiquphon in Denmark. The midrange KEF B110, known for its use in the LS3/5A BBC monitor, is a 100mm-diameter unit to which Linn applied a layer of doping. The woofer is a KEF B139.|$|E

5|$|The BBC had {{initiated}} tendering to {{have the}} LS3/5 made under license. As the broadcasting unit was about to order another batch of the monitor, {{it was found that}} KEF had discontinued the B110 (A6362) and the T27 (A6340) in favour of the B110 (SP1003) and T27 (SP1032) specification, and was already using them in the Coda, one of their own-brand commercial loudspeakers. Thus the design had to be revised because these new units had different impedances, technical characteristics and altered resonance patterns. The <b>tweeter</b> was considered potentially fragile because it now had an exposed dome, so a suitable protection grille was found to cover and protect the dome. The <b>tweeter</b> was also surrounded by a thick felt rectangle to prevent interference pattern effects being created by the edge of the cabinet. The crossover also had to undergo change, and the LS3/5 became the LS3/5A in the early summer of 1974.|$|E

25|$|High-pass filters {{have many}} applications. They {{are used as}} part of an audio {{crossover}} to direct high frequencies to a <b>tweeter</b> while attenuating bass signals which could interfere with, or damage, the speaker. When such a filter is built into a loudspeaker cabinet it is normally a passive filter that also includes a low-pass filter for the woofer and so often employs both a capacitor and inductor (although very simple high-pass filters for tweeters can consist of a series capacitor and nothing else).|$|E

25|$|Woofer {{enclosures}} must {{be larger}} and more sturdily built than cabinets for mid-range or high-frequency (<b>tweeter)</b> speakers. As such, in the 1950s, when Ampeg introduced bass amplifier and speaker systems, bass guitarists began to use them. Similarly, Hammond organ players used a specialized keyboard combo amplifier, the Leslie speaker cabinet, which contains a woofer for the low frequencies and a horn for the high frequencies. The Leslie horns rotate and a baffle around the woofer rotates as well, producing a rich tremolo and chorus effect.|$|E
25|$|Rated Power– Nominal (or even continuous) power, and peak (or maximum short-term) power a {{loudspeaker}} can handle (i.e., maximum input power before destroying the loudspeaker; {{it is never}} the sound output the loudspeaker produces). A driver may be damaged at much less than its rated power if driven past its mechanical limits at lower frequencies. Tweeters can also be damaged by amplifier clipping (amplifier circuits produce large amounts of energy at high frequencies in such cases) or by music or sine wave input at high frequencies. Each of these situations might pass more energy to a <b>tweeter</b> than it can survive without damage. In some jurisdictions, power handling has a legal meaning allowing comparisons between loudspeakers under consideration. Elsewhere, the variety of meanings for power handling capacity can be quite confusing.|$|E
25|$|Plasma arc {{loudspeakers}} use electrical plasma as a radiating element. Since plasma has minimal mass, but {{is charged}} {{and therefore can}} be manipulated by an electric field, {{the result is a}} very linear output at frequencies far higher than the audible range. Problems of maintenance and reliability for this approach tend to make it unsuitable for mass market use. In 1978 Alan E. Hill of the Air Force Weapons Laboratory in Albuquerque, NM, designed the Plasmatronics Hill Type I, a <b>tweeter</b> whose plasma was generated from helium gas. This avoided the ozone and nitrous oxide produced by RF decomposition of air in an earlier generation of plasma tweeters made by the pioneering DuKane Corporation, who produced the Ionovac (marketed as the Ionofane in the UK) during the 1950s. Currently, there remain a few manufacturers in Germany who use this design, and a do-it-yourself design has been published and has been available on the Internet.|$|E

30|$|Cosine {{similarity}} scores each training <b>tweet</b> only {{based on}} the similarity between each training <b>tweet</b> and each test tweet; hence, it simply ranks higher on retweets that presumably contain the removed hashtags.

Though we expected it to show an even larger gap, the actual result is reasonable {{because it is not}} guaranteed that similar <b>tweets</b> are actual retweets and that similar <b>tweets</b> always contain all of the removed hashtags. Suppose, for example, there is a training <b>tweet</b> washington #wsuv and a test <b>tweet</b> washington #DC. Since hashtags are ignored when Cosine similarity is calculated, the similarity score for these two test <b>tweets</b> is 1.0. This training <b>tweet</b> is then considered as a retweet of the test <b>tweet</b> washington, even though it returns #wsuv instead of #DC.|$|R
25|$|Oskar Heil {{invented the}} air motion {{transducer}} in the 1960s. In this approach, a pleated diaphragm is mounted in {{a magnetic field}} and forced to close and open under control of a music signal. Air is forced from between the pleats {{in accordance with the}} imposed signal, generating sound. The drivers are less fragile than ribbons and considerably more efficient (and able to produce higher absolute output levels) than ribbon, electrostatic, or planar magnetic <b>tweeter</b> designs. ESS, a California manufacturer, licensed the design, employed Heil, and produced a range of speaker systems using his tweeters during the 1970s and 1980s. Lafayette Radio, a large US retail store chain, also sold speaker systems using such tweeters for a time. There are several manufacturers of these drivers (at least two in Germany—one of which produces a range of high-end professional speakers using tweeters and mid-range drivers based on the technology) and the drivers are increasingly used in professional audio. Martin Logan produces several AMT speakers in the US and GoldenEar Technologies incorporates them in its entire speaker line.|$|E
25|$|Transducer {{technologies}} employed much less commonly for headphones include the Heil Air Motion Transformer (AMT); Piezoelectric film; Ribbon planar magnetic; Magnetostriction and Plasma-ionisation. The first Heil AMT headphone was marketed by ESS Laboratories and was essentially an ESS AMT <b>tweeter</b> {{from one of}} the company's speakers being driven at full range. Since the turn of the century, only Precide of Switzerland have manufactured an AMT headphone. Piezoelectric film headphones were first developed by Pioneer, their two models both used a flat sheet of film which limited the maximum volume of air that could be moved. Currently TakeT produce a piezoelectric film headphone which is shaped not unlike an AMT transducer but which like the driver Precide uses for their headphones, has a variation in the size of transducer folds over the diaphragm. It additionally incorporates a two way design by its inclusion of a dedicated tweeter/supertweeter panel. The folded shape of a diaphragm allows a transducer with a larger surface area to fit within smaller space constraints. This increases the total volume of air that can be moved on each excursion of the transducer given that radiating area.|$|E

30|$|Kong et al. propose kSAITkSAIT (top-k Similar Author-Identical {{historic}} <b>Tweets),</b> an algorithm {{that can}} predict {{the popularity of}} <b>tweets</b> one, two, or three days after publication based on the retweet information received in the first hour [63]. The underlying assumption of this algorithm is that, <b>tweets</b> are retweeted {{in a similar manner}} depending on the author of the <b>tweet.</b> The prediction algorithm is thus user-specific (there is one prediction function for each user) and uses as predictive features only users’ retweeting behavior as it does not include any information about content itself or about users’ centrality in the graph of social interactions. Each <b>tweet</b> is described by a set of features (e.g., retweet acceleration, retweet depth) derived from the time-series of the retweets published in the first hour after publication by the direct and n-level followers, the publication time of the <b>tweet,</b> and information about the users who retweeted the original <b>tweet.</b> When a new <b>tweet</b> is posted, the algorithm computes the similarity of the <b>tweet</b> and all other <b>tweets</b> published by the same user, selects the top-k most similar <b>tweets,</b> and estimates the popularity of the target <b>tweet</b> as an average of the popularity of the top-k most similar <b>tweets.</b>|$|R
