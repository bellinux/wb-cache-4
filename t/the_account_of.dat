40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} <b>the</b> <b>accounting</b> <b>of</b> Czech company's branch {{established}} in Slovak Republic. The first part is rather theoretical, {{it shows the}} branch from a legal {{point of view and}} consequently in terms <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> from <b>the</b> perspective <b>of</b> the founder of the branch itself and {{from the perspective of the}} foreign branch. Other chapters are devoted to the practical example of the Czech company's branch established in Slovakia. The branch and its founder are defined in the second chapter of the thesis. The third part deals with <b>the</b> <b>accounting</b> <b>of</b> Slovak branch that means with the various operations carried out during <b>the</b> <b>accounting</b> period from <b>the</b> opening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>accounting</b> books through regular transactions to closing <b>the</b> <b>accounting</b> books. <b>The</b> third chapter also describes how to capture branch in <b>the</b> <b>accounting</b> <b>of</b> its founder. <b>The</b> last part is devoted to correct mistakes, respectively infringement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Slovak <b>accounting</b> standards, which were found in <b>the</b> <b>accounting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Slovak branch...|$|R

5|$|According to <b>the</b> <b>account</b> <b>of</b> bishop {{ambassador}} Giovanni Andrea Boccaccio, {{at least}} seven cardinals considered themselves papabile, having dismantled the furnishings of their palaces as a precaution against the traditional pillaging of the pope-elect's residence by the Roman populace: da Costa, di Campofregoso, Michiel, Piccolomini, Domenico della Rovere, Savelli, and Zeno.|$|E

Ernst Badian believes that a peace between Athens and Persia was first ratified in 463 BC (making the Athenian interventions in Egypt and Cyprus violations of the peace), and renegotiated {{at the conclusion of the}} campaign in Cyprus, taking force again by 449–448BC.|$|E

5|$|Domitian was {{allegedly}} extremely sensitive regarding his baldness, which he disguised {{in later life}} by wearing wigs.

5|$|In Iceland, {{where the}} kings' sagas {{continued}} to be copied and studied, the battle exercised the imagination of several poets. A 15th century rímur cycle, Svöldrar rímur, chronicles the battle in verse, largely following <b>the</b> <b>account</b> <b>of</b> Oddr Snorrason. Two more rímur cycles on the same topic were composed in the 18th century, {{one of which is}} preserved. In the 19th century, the popular poet Sigurður Breiðfjörð composed yet another rímur cycle on the battle, based on the account in Mesta.|$|E

5|$|Modern historians {{consider}} this highly implausible however, noting that malicious rumours {{such as those}} concerning Domitia's alleged infidelity were eagerly repeated by post-Domitianic authors, and used to highlight the hypocrisy of a ruler publicly preaching a return to Augustan morals, while privately indulging in excesses and presiding over a corrupt court.
