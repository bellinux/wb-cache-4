5|$|On a rainy Sunday of 1951, {{the crowd}} left Les Corts stadium after a 2–1 win against Santander by foot, refusing to catch any trams, and {{surprising}} the Francoist authorities. <b>The</b> <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> simple: {{at the same}} time, a tram strike was taking place in Barcelona, receiving the support of blaugrana fans. Events like this made CF Barcelona represent {{much more than just}} Catalonia and many progressive Spaniards saw the club as a staunch defender of rights and freedoms.|$|E
5|$|Polish {{headquarters}} {{decided to}} man the outer line of defences, the furthest from the densely populated areas. <b>The</b> <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> {{that in the}} 1830s 53 percent of buildings (out of 3,148 houses in Warsaw) were made of wood and a fire could easily destroy the city. In case the enemy broke through all three lines of defences, the city centre was also fortified with 30 barricades, embrasures cut through the walls of several buildings and mines hidden beneath major street crossings.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after UDI, 46 {{academics}} {{working at}} University College, a racially non-segregated institution, in Rhodesia wrote to The Times in London, denouncing the move. Officers of the British South Africa Police visited {{many of those}} who had signed to search their houses. Shortly afterwards, the residence permit of one of the academics came up for renewal, which would normally be automatic. In fact, it was revoked and the academic was deported. Van der Byl was the responsible minister and all but admitted that <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> his opposition to UDI.|$|E

5|$|Brezhnev {{conspired to}} oust Podgorny from the {{collective}} leadership {{as early as}} 1970. <b>The</b> <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> simple: Brezhnev was third, while Podgorny was first in the ranking of Soviet diplomatic protocol; Podgorny's removal would have made Brezhnev head of state, and his political power would have increased significantly. For much of the period, however, Brezhnev was unable to have Podgorny removed, {{because he could not}} count on enough votes in the Politburo, since the removal of Podgorny would have meant weakening of the power and the prestige of the collective leadership itself. Indeed, Podgorny continued to acquire greater power as the head of state throughout the early 1970s, due to Brezhnev's liberal stance on Yugoslavia and his disarmament talks with some Western powers, policies which many Soviet officials saw as contrary to common communist principles.|$|E
5|$|Content {{with their}} convincing win at Trent Bridge, Australia made no changes to their team, while England made three, omitting Barnett, Hardstaff and Young {{due to a}} {{combination}} of injury and poor form. Barnett and Hardstaff never played another Test. Despite his injury, Lindwall {{played a key role in}} a heavy 409-run Australian victory, taking eight wickets. His bowling also led to the controversial omission of Hutton, who performed poorly at Lord's, for the Third Test. <b>The</b> <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> said to be Hutton's struggles with Lindwall's short-pitched bowling. This decision pleased the Australians, who regarded Hutton as their most formidable opponent with the bat.|$|E
5|$|During the 1960s, Vestfoldfly never {{received}} a concession for a regular, scheduled flight from Sandefjord to Oslo. <b>The</b> <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> that the Skien-based Fjellfly held the concession for the routes from Oslo to Sandefjord, Tønsberg and Skien. Fjellfly never used its landing rights at Sandefjord, but nevertheless still hindered Vestfoldfly from starting a competing route. Skaunfelt eventually split his activity in two, demerging the aviation school and renaming it Den Norske Luftfartsskole, which remained in operation until 1999. The other activity was renamed Norsk Flytjeneste. In 1969, Norsk Flytjeneste and Jotun, a large Sandefjord-based industrial company, established Penguin Air Service, where Norsk Flytjeneste owned 25 {{percent of the}} shares. Penguin Air Service company bought a six-seat Piper PA-31 Navajo and started charter services for Jotun. In 1975, Bugge Supplyship also joined the joint venture and a second aircraft was bought. Most of the traffic was for the oil industry to Stavanger.|$|E

5|$|In 1973, Oslo Sporveier again {{proposed}} {{closing the}} Ekeberg Line. This time <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> {{the construction of}} the Oslo Tunnel and Oslo Central Station, which would involve construction work around Jernbanetorget. This proposal also resulted in a public reactions, and the same arguments from the mid-1960s were repeated. Again the suggestion to link the Lilleaker Line to the Ekeberg Line were launched. Oslo Sporveier calculated it would cost NOK3.6 million for investments, including rebuilding 20 Gullfisk trams, new rectifiers and new tracks. This was less than the necessary 30 buses needed for conversion to bus services.|$|E
5|$|Northrop Grumman and Raytheon {{decided in}} 2002 to locate its ground station for National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System, the {{successor}} of EOS, to Helsinki, Finland, instead of Svalbard. <b>The</b> <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> lack of {{optical fiber cable}} connection to the archipelago. NSC took initiative to build such a cable in July 2002 and gained interest from NASA, NOAA and Telenor. The cable was financed by the satellite operators paying the same fee for the transmission of data {{as they would have}} to pay for a satellite connection until the cable was paid for. A 40 million United States dollar contract was signed with Tyco International for two cables between Harstad on the mainland and Longyearbyen. Construction started in June 2003 and was completed in January 2004.|$|E
5|$|The Football Association bought Aker's {{share of}} the stadium during the 1930s, and in 1945 also part of Lyn's share. From 1948, the Cup Final was held at Ullevaal, and has been held there since. Other {{activities}} held during the first decades included boxing, and a revival meeting hosted by Billy Graham in front of 40,000 people in 1955. In 1960, NFF bought more shares from Lyn and became the majority shareholder with 50.7%, while Lyn retained 44.2%. <b>The</b> <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> the planned expansion could not receive public grants with such a strong tie to a single club, but the state {{was willing to give}} grants to the stadium if it was controlled by the federation. In 1967, a new South Stand was opened, and the following year NFF moved into offices at the stadium.|$|E

From 1997 to 1998, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone won almost all the UK awards judged by children, {{but none of the}} children's book awards judged by adults, and Sandra Beckett suggested <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> intellectual snobbery towards books that were popular among children. In 1999, the winner of the Whitbread Book of the Year award children's division was entered {{for the first time on}} the shortlist for the main award, and one judge threatened to resign if Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was declared the overall winner; it finished second, very close behind the winner of the poetry prize, Seamus Heaney's translation of the Anglo-Saxon epic Beowulf.|$|E
5|$|The {{three decades}} after the 1952 Grey Cup victory have been called the Argonauts' Dark Ages. The team went thirty-one years between {{championship}} victories and nineteen without even making an appearance in the final. Part of <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> a salary cap introduced in 1953 that cost them many talented players. For {{the first time in}} decades, they began ranking {{at the bottom of the}} Eastern Division. The management style under new owner John Bassett has also been blamed: young talent was traded or allowed to leave and the team could not form a nucleus of championship players; coaches came and went rapidly. Two notable events occurred off-field at the end of the 1950s: in 1958 the Argonauts became a founding member of the Canadian Football League and a year later found a new home at Exhibition Stadium.|$|E
5|$|When Queen Beatrix succeeded {{her mother}} Juliana on the latter's abdication on 30 April 1980, the new queen {{decided to keep}} the holiday on 30 April {{as a tribute to}} her mother. (If 30 April fell on a Sunday, Koninginnedag was {{observed}} the previous day—this occurred most recently in 2006.) <b>The</b> <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> practical as well—Beatrix's actual birthday on 31 January would have been less conducive to the traditional outdoor activities. Rather than remaining at the palace and letting the Dutch people come to her, Beatrix instead usually visited two towns each year for Koninginnedag celebrations. Local crafts and customs were demonstrated for the royal family, who had the opportunity to join in.|$|E

5|$|When {{the teams}} reconvened at Old Trafford for the Third Test, Hutton had been dropped. <b>The</b> <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> {{said to be}} Hutton's struggles with Lindwall's short-pitched bowling. The {{omission}} generated considerable controversy. The Australians were pleased, feeling that Hutton was England's best batsman. Hutton's opening position was taken by debutant Emmett. England made three further changes. Young and Pollard replaced Wright and Laker in the bowling department, thereby reverting from two spinners to one. Coxon, who made his debut in the previous match and opened the bowling, taking match figures of 3/172 and scoring 19 and a duck, was replaced by debutant batsman Crapp. Australia dropped Brown, who had scored 73 runs at 24.33 in three innings, with the all rounder Loxton. Yardley won the toss and elected to bat.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of the war, the power of the British East India Company was on the rise, whereas the Maratha Empire was on the decline (although they had only ruled for a very short duration, may be <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> they never had {{intellectual}} capabilities and could only defeat Mughals when there was no great king left) The British had been victorious in the previous Anglo-Maratha war and Hindu Brahmin Marathas were at their mercy. The Peshwa of the Maratha Empire at this time was Baji Rao II. Several Maratha leaders who had formerly sided with the Peshwa were now under British control or protection. The British had an arrangement with the Gaekwad dynasty of the Maratha province of Baroda to prevent the Peshwa from collecting revenue in that province. Gaekwad sent an envoy to the Peshwa in Pune to negotiate a dispute regarding revenue collection. The envoy, Gangadhar Shastri, was under British protection. He was murdered, and the Peshwa's minister Trimbak Dengle was suspected of the crime.|$|E

5|$|In mid-September, {{the press}} {{announced}} that on 8 May 1996 NSB had agreed that Class 71's axles could receive a steel quality substandard to European standard and recommendation from the International Union of Railways. <b>The</b> <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> that the class {{would have a}} much higher weight than planned, and that this would cause the trains to operate more slowly and thus {{not be able to}} reach the airport in the desired 19 minutes. Class 73 inherited the same axle quality from the Class 71 order. On 11 September, Adtranz accepted responsibility for the axle problems, and stated that they would replace all axles free of charge, an operation which would cost them NOK70 million. In October, Adtranz announced that they would also replace all the wheels on both classes. NSB was spending NOK1.5 million on brake discs and brake shoes per month. The parties continued to disagree on the size of compensation Adtranz should give NSB, with NOK100 million separating the two. In July, NSB replaced DNV with CorrOcean as their inspection supplier for the class. NSB stated that this halved the cost of the inspections. The same month, Bombardier Transportation, who by then had taken over Adtranz, stated {{that they were going to}} replace the bogie frames for all the Class 71 and 73, as well as Class 93 trains, as part of the compensation deal with NSB.|$|E
5|$|On 16 December 1999, NSB {{confirmed}} the option for another six Class 73 trains, costing NOK680 million, {{for use on}} the Østfold Line. On 7 January 2000, the trains were put into service on the Dovre Line between Oslo and Trondheim, and on the Sørland Line between Kristiansand and Stavanger. The travel time from Trondheim to Oslo was 5 hours and 46 minutes. In an independent marketing survey, Signatur customers were more satisfied than the customers for the two main airlines, Braathens and Scandinavian Airlines, but the train service had a lower reputation than the airlines. By May, the number of passengers on the Sørland Line had fallen by 10 percent. <b>The</b> <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> the limited capacity during the weekends; while NSB had previously run trains with 400 to 500 seats, Class 73 had considerably less capacity. Additional services were introduced on the Dovre Line from 11 June 2000, while the introduction on the Bergen Line was delayed because the infrastructure upgrades on the Bergen Line were not yet completed.|$|E
5|$|The United Nations ranked Sierra Leone 180 out of 187 {{on their}} Human Development Index. One {{of the major}} factors in this low world ranking was gender inequality. Despite a {{civil war in the}} country, {{football}} remained important to many young people, regardless of gender, in the country. <b>The</b> <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> that football was seen as one way of understanding life by watching what happened on the pitch. In 2007, a football administrator from the country {{is in charge of the}} women's football committee in the West African Football Union. In 2011, Brazilian women's football superstar Marta visited the country and met with the national team. Her visit was part of the United Nations Development Programme where Marta is a Goodwill Ambassador. In 2011, there was no national women's league in the country. In 2012, Girls Football League was launched by the Craig Bellamy Foundation after a pilot programme in 2010/2012 in Makeni that included four teams. Girls participating in the programme are given scholarships to attend, with 93% attending school regularly while involved with the programme, a much higher percentage than the national average for female school attendance.|$|E
