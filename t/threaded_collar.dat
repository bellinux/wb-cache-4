50|$|A {{waveguide}} flange is {{a connector}} for joining sections of waveguide, and {{is essentially the}} same as a pipe flange—a waveguide, {{in the context of this}} article, being a hollow metal conduit for microwave energy. The connecting face of the flange is either square, circular or (particularly for large or reduced-height rectangular waveguides), rectangular. The connection between a pair of flanges is usually made with four or more bolts, though alternative mechanisms, such as a <b>threaded</b> <b>collar,</b> may be used where there is a need for rapid assembly and disassembly. Dowel pins are sometimes used in addition to bolts, to ensure accurate alignment, particularly for very small waveguides.|$|E

Tailpieces of the violin family or viol families of instruments, including double basses, are attached by a [...] "tailgut" [...] looped around the tailpin or end button, which is let into the bottom bock of the instrument. Originally made of animal gut and adjusted with difficulty by means of a knot, tailguts are now usually made of wire or nylon monofilament, and easily adjusted with <b>threaded</b> <b>collars,</b> usually made of brass, on the ends.|$|R
5000|$|This type of {{instrument}} is commonly used in inspections of oil field tool pipe for metal surface pits, fractures, and roundness before being shipped to drilling sites for exploratory wells. The process of inspections are designed to remove weakened drill pipe, so that pipe will not fracture during drilling. Tool pipe with thicker than 1" [...] walls for a 4" [...] diameter tube of hardened steel, fitted with tapered <b>thread</b> <b>collars</b> are re-used after drilling is complete, and thinner-walled tubular oil-well casing is in place. Electronic instrumentation similar to the spherometer in design are modified at inspection plants for casing, tubing, and drill pipe. The equivalent measurements in optics would be for a cylinder, or lens with a cylindrical component having an optical axis, where a plane through the lens would produce an oval circumference.|$|R
5000|$|A screw is a {{mechanism}} that converts rotational motion to linear motion, and a torque (rotational force) to a linear force. [...] It {{is one of}} the six classical simple machines. The most common form consists of a cylindrical shaft with helical grooves or ridges called threads around the outside. [...] The screw passes through a hole in another object or medium, with threads {{on the inside of the}} hole that mesh with the screw's threads. When the shaft of the screw is rotated relative to the stationary threads, the screw moves along its axis relative to the medium surrounding it; for example rotating a wood screw forces it into wood. In screw mechanisms, either the screw shaft can rotate through a threaded hole in a stationary object, or a <b>threaded</b> <b>collar</b> such as a nut can rotate around a stationary screw shaft. [...] Geometrically, a screw can be viewed as a narrow inclined plane wrapped around a cylinder.|$|E
5000|$|In 1996 the DR650SE was introduced, {{replacing}} the previous models. The engine was radically redesigned, reducing its power but allowing for more smooth delivery. The bike's weight was also reduced by around 25 kg. In 2002, the DR's styling was updated with Suzuki's widely recognized yellow off-road racing colors and graphics. The 2010-2015 SE model has the factory option of lowering the seat height by 45 mm for shorter riders. This involves lowering {{the front and}} rear suspension. A shorter side stand is also needed. The SE seat is narrow and firm. The SE has no tachometer but with standard gearing will cruise comfortably at 110-115 km/h. It has digital electronic CDI ignition and a coated cylinder bore to reduce weight. The exhaust pipe is made of stainless steel painted black to stop rusting. For a single cylinder bike it is quite smooth due to the effective balancer shaft. At 120 km/h it still has power for overtaking. The 40 mm Mikuni Carb gives smooth power flow. It has electric start only. The 21 inch front tyre gives good directional control on gravel roads but is still fine for fast riding on sealed roads with the standard tyres. The 2013 SE model has a range of about 240 km from the 13L tank or a consumption of less than 5l/100km. The front fork is non adjustable while the rear mono shock is adjustable for preload through a tricky to access <b>threaded</b> <b>collar</b> and for compression damping. The bike qualifies for LAMs legislation for beginner motorcyclists in Australia and New Zealand where it is rated at 43HP(32 kW). The bike has an excellent reputation for reliability. The 2013-2014 model is available in either grey or white By 2015 the model has been in production for 20 years.The bike is the best selling over 500cc bike in New Zealand. The bike is often in the top 5 sellers of any capacity bikes in New Zealand.The DR650 is also a big seller in both Canada and Australia. It is not commonly sold in Europe due to the stringent Euro 3 emission regulations which make it virtually impossible for a non fuel injected machine to pass.The 2015 model is white and grey with a gold stripe on the tank,with the exhaust pipe finished bright [...]|$|E

5000|$|The 944 Turbo S's {{suspension}} had the [...] "M030" [...] option {{consisting of}} Koni adjustable shocks front and rear, with ride height adjusting <b>threaded</b> <b>collars</b> {{on the front}} struts, progressive rate springs, larger hollow rear anti-roll/torsion bars, harder durometer suspension bushings, larger 26.8 mm hollow anti-roll/torsion bars at the front, and chassis stiffening brackets in the front frame rails. The air conditioning dryer lines are routed so as to clear the front frame brace on the driver's side. The 944 Turbo S wheels, known as the Club Sport design, were 16-inch Fuchs forged and flat-dished, similar to the Design 90 wheel. Wheel widths were 7 in in the front, and 9 in in the rear with 52 mm offset; sizes of the Z-rated tires were 225/50 {{in the front and}} 245/45 in the rear. The front and rear fender edges were rolled to accommodate the larger wheels. The manual transmission (case code designation: AOR) featured a higher friction clutch disc setup, an external cooler, and a limited slip differential with a 40% lockup setting. The Turbo S front brakes were borrowed from the Porsche 928 S4, with larger Brembo GT 4-piston fixed calipers and 12-inch discs; rear Brembo brakes remained the same as a standard Turbo. ABS also came standard.|$|R

Each of the three lead screws is <b>threaded</b> through a <b>collar</b> that is press fitted through the center of one of three pinion gears. A sun gear meshes with all three pinion gears and transversely moves the three lead screws upon actuation of a drive gear. The drive gear meshes with the sun gear and is driven by a handle or servomotor. When the handle or servomotor rotates the drive gear, the sun gear rotates causing the three pinion gears to rotate, thus, causing transverse movement of the three lead screws and, accordingly, transverse movement of the transversing plate. When the drive gear rotates, the traversing plate is driven {{in and out of a}} microwave cavity. Thus, the length or size of the cavity can be tuned while maintaining the traversing plate in an exact parallel relationship with an opposing plate on another end of the cavity...|$|R

40|$|The {{ability to}} protect bridge piers and {{abutments}} against scour is critical to bridge safety. Excessive pier scour can cause high maintenance costs or even bridge collapse resulting in the interruption of traffic and possibly death. Up to now, various types of countermeasures have been recommended to reduce scouring around pier foundations. The countermeasures against pier scour can be broadly classified into two categories: (1) flow-altering and (2) bed-armouring countermeasures. This thesis focuses on the first category of countermeasures. Based on {{a comprehensive review of}} the up-to-date studies on various types of flow-altering countermeasures, these can be classified into four main groups based on their shapes and performances: (1) openings through piers, (2) pier attachments, (3) bed attachments and (4) other devices. After evaluation and considering all the countermeasures, a few countermeasures were recommended for further investigations. Among them, five countermeasures were selected for analysis in the present thesis. They are transverse sacrificial piles, <b>collar,</b> <b>threading,</b> pier slot and bed-sill. The first part of the experiments, were performed in clear-water scour condition, near threshold condition of sediment movement. In this part, countermeasures were tested individually. Afterwards, countermeasures that showed appropriate efficiency in scour depth reduction were combined one by one. Results of this part showed that a collar, pier slot and sacrificial piles may show efficiency of about 30 % in scour depth reduction; however, threading cannot be assumed as a reliable pier scour countermeasure. Results show that the blockage ratio of sacrificial piles is an important parameter, since by increasing the number of piles from three to five, the efficiency reduces. In this part also optimum size and location of a pier slot were criticised and best configuration based on previous and present studies was proposed. In fact, the best configuration can be suggested as a pier slot half as long as the flow depth plus maximum scour depth. In this case, the pier slot near the water surface may not significantly increase the efficiency. A combination of sacrificial piles with a collar and sacrificial piles with a slot showed that they cannot reduce the scour depth significantly with respect to each individual countermeasure. In particular, a combination of a collar and sacrificial piles increases the rate of scouring with respect to a single collar. At the end of this part, a combination of a bed-sill and cut-collar was selected as the best configuration. Two forms of this countermeasure were proposed for further studies. In the first proposed countermeasure, the use of a sill as wide as the channel width was recommended. This form, although reliable to prevent souring at the upstream part of the bed-sill, may not be applicable for some practical purposes. Therefore, in another attempt, a shorter bed-sill was also proposed, protected with two side-walls, {{in order to reduce the}} risk of scour intrusion in front of the bed-sill. These two proposed countermeasures showed efficiencies of 68. 5 % and 64. 5 % in scour depth reduction, however owing to the use of a border around the collar rim, the scour did not reach the pier body. In next part, the later form of proposed countermeasure that consists of a shorter bed-sill and seems to be more practical, was evaluated in unsteady flow tests with the peak flow intensity slightly greater than the threshold for the inception of sediment movement. In this section of the thesis, circular and round nose and tail rectangular piers were tested in both configurations of single and two in-line piers. The results of unsteady flow tests also show that the proposed combined countermeasure can protect pier foundation during a flood event. Specifically, it seems that the proposed countermeasure is more effective when it is applied to round nose and tail rectangular piers than circular onesScuola di Dottorato "Pitagora" in Scienzae Ingegneristiche, Ciclo I, a. a. 2007 - 2010 Università degli Studi della Calabri...|$|R
