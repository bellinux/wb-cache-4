5|$|In the Oldman Formation (the {{geological}} {{equivalent of}} the Judith River formation), Daspletosaurus torosus could have preyed upon the hadrosaur species Brachylophosaurus canadensis, the ceratopsians Coronosaurus brinkmani and Albertaceratops nesmoi, pachycephalosaurs, ornithomimids, therizinosaurs and possibly ankylosaurs. Other predators included troodontids, oviraptorosaurs, the dromaeosaurid Saurornitholestes and possibly an albertosaurine tyrannosaur (genus currently unknown). The younger Dinosaur Park and Two Medicine Formations had faunas similar to the Oldman, with <b>the</b> <b>Dinosaur</b> Park in particular preserving an unrivaled array of dinosaurs. The albertosaurine Gorgosaurus lived alongside unnamed species of Daspletosaurus in <b>the</b> <b>Dinosaur</b> Park and Upper Two Medicine environments. Young tyrannosaurs may have filled the niches in between adult tyrannosaurs and smaller theropods, which were separated by two orders of magnitude in mass. A Saurornitholestes dentary has been discovered in <b>the</b> <b>Dinosaur</b> Park Formation that bore tooth marks left by the bite of a young tyrannosaur, possibly Daspletosaurus.|$|E

Vorb takes them aboard his saucer and they travel to the present, dropping them off in New York City, which at that moment is celebrating the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. <b>The</b> <b>dinosaurs</b> pretend to be inflatable balloons to sneak along with the parade, but Rex mistakes one of <b>the</b> real <b>dinosaur</b> balloons to be his Allosaurus friend Worgul.

5|$|Along {{with the}} holotype, Russell {{designated}} a specimen collected by Barnum Brown in 1913 as the paratype of D. torosus. This specimen (AMNH 5438) consists {{of parts of}} the hindleg, the pelvis {{and some of its}} associated vertebrae. It was discovered in <b>the</b> <b>Dinosaur</b> Park Formation in Alberta. <b>The</b> <b>Dinosaur</b> Park Formation was formerly known as the Upper Oldman Formation and dates back to the middle Campanian, between 76.5 and 74.8million years ago. Daspletosaurus fossils are known specifically from the middle to upper section of the formation, between 75.6 and 75.0 million years ago. In 1914, Brown collected a nearly complete skeleton and skull; forty years later his American Museum of Natural History sold this specimen to the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago. It was mounted for display in Chicago and labeled as Albertosaurus libratus for many years, but after several skull features were later found to be modeled in plaster, including most of the teeth, the specimen (FMNH PR308) was reassigned to Daspletosaurus torosus by Thomas Carr in 1999. A total of eight specimens have been collected from <b>the</b> <b>Dinosaur</b> Park Formation over the years since, most of them within the boundaries of Dinosaur Provincial Park. Phil Currie believes that <b>the</b> <b>Dinosaur</b> Park specimens represent a new species of Daspletosaurus, distinguished by certain features of the skull. Pictures of this new species have been published, but it still awaits a name and full description in print.|$|E

50|$|The term prehistoric reptile {{covers a}} broad {{category}} that {{is intended to}} help distinguish <b>the</b> <b>dinosaurs</b> from other prehistoric reptiles.

5000|$|All of <b>the</b> <b>dinosaurs</b> are life-sized, and are animatronic. Some of <b>the</b> animatronic <b>dinosaurs</b> are interactive, {{allowing}} {{visitors to}} press buttons on <b>the</b> <b>dinosaur's</b> sign that will control {{the movement of}} various body parts depending on where the button is located (e.g. button on snout opens jaws, button on throat thrashes neck, and button on rear makes the tail sway). <b>The</b> non-interactive animatronic <b>dinosaurs</b> are activated when a special sensory camera {{in front of them}} captures movement, and they will begin to move in various ways, depending on which dinosaur or species they are. Accompanying the various movements are roaring, bellowing, and/or shrieking sound effects erupting from hidden speakers to make it seem as though <b>the</b> <b>dinosaurs</b> are calling noisily to one another.|$|R

5|$|Fossils {{have been}} found in the upper Oldman Formation and lower Dinosaur Park Formation of Canada. The Oldman Formation dates to the Campanian, about 77.5 to 76.5 million years ago, and <b>the</b> <b>Dinosaur</b> Park Formation dates from 76.6 to 74.8 million years ago. Corythosaurus lived from ~77–75.7 million years ago. In <b>the</b> <b>Dinosaur</b> Park Formation C. casuarius lived from 76.6 to 75.9 mya, with C. intermedius living from 75.8 to 75.7 mya. In the Oldman Formation C. casuarius, the only species of Corythosaurus from the deposits, lived about 77 to 76.5 mya. The holotype {{specimen}} was clearly a carcass that had floated up on a beach, as Unio shells, water-worn bones, and a baenid turtle were preserved all around. Corythosaurus probably lived in a woodland forest, and might have occasionally wandered into swampy areas.|$|E

5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>Dinosaur</b> Park Formation, Gorgosaurus lived {{alongside}} a rarer {{species of the}} tyrannosaurine Daspletosaurus. This {{is one of the}} few examples of two tyrannosaur genera coexisting. Similarly-sized predators in modern predator guilds are separated into different ecological niches by anatomical, behavioral or geographical differences that limit competition. Niche differentiation between <b>the</b> <b>Dinosaur</b> Park tyrannosaurids is not well understood. In 1970, Dale Russell hypothesized that the more common Gorgosaurus actively hunted fleet-footed hadrosaurs, while the rarer and more troublesome ceratopsians and ankylosaurians (horned and heavily armoured dinosaurs) were left to the more heavily built Daspletosaurus. However, a specimen of Daspletosaurus (OTM 200) from the contemporaneous Two Medicine Formation of Montana preserves the digested remains of a juvenile hadrosaur in its gut region.|$|E
5|$|Most {{specimens}} of Gorgosaurus libratus {{have been recovered}} from <b>the</b> <b>Dinosaur</b> Park Formation in Alberta. This formation dates {{to the middle of}} the Campanian, between 76.5 and 74.8million years ago, and Gorgosaurus libratus fossils are known specifically from the lower to middle section of the formation, between 76.6 and 75.1 million years ago. The Two Medicine Formation and Judith River Formation of Montana have also yielded possible Gorgosaurus remains. At this time, the area was a coastal plain along the western edge of the Western Interior Seaway, which divided North America in half. The Laramide Orogeny had begun uplifting the Rocky Mountains to the west, from which flowed great rivers that deposited eroded sediment in vast floodplains along the coast. The climate was subtropical with marked seasonality, and periodic droughts sometimes resulted in massive mortality among the great herds of dinosaurs, as represented in the numerous bonebed deposits preserved in <b>the</b> <b>Dinosaur</b> Park Formation. Conifers formed the forest canopy, while the understory plants consisted of ferns, tree ferns and angiosperms. Around 73million years ago, the seaway began to expand, transgressing into areas formerly above sea level and drowning <b>the</b> <b>Dinosaur</b> Park ecosystem. This transgression, called the Bearpaw Sea, is recorded by the marine sediments of the massive Bearpaw Shale.|$|E
5|$|Parasaurolophus walkeri, from <b>the</b> <b>Dinosaur</b> Park Formation, was {{a member}} of a diverse and {{well-documented}} fauna of prehistoric animals, including well-known dinosaurs such as the horned Centrosaurus, Chasmosaurus, and Styracosaurus; fellow duckbills Gryposaurus and Corythosaurus; tyrannosaurid Gorgosaurus; and armored Edmontonia, Euoplocephalus and Dyoplosaurus. It was a rare constituent of this fauna. <b>The</b> <b>Dinosaur</b> Park Formation is interpreted as a low-relief setting of rivers and floodplains that became more swampy and influenced by marine conditions over time as the Western Interior Seaway transgressed westward. The climate was warmer than present-day Alberta, without frost, but with wetter and drier seasons. Conifers were apparently the dominant canopy plants, with an understory of ferns, tree ferns, and angiosperms.|$|E
