In our walks thither we met her--when the tourist was of that sex--young, gay, gathering the red leaves of the Virginia-creeper from the lakeward terraces of the highway; we met him, old, sick, pale, munching the sour grapes, and trying somehow to kill the time. Large listless groups of them met every steamboat from which we landed, and parties of them encountered us on every road.

50|$|One of {{the founders}} of social interactionism, George Herbert Mead focused on the {{internal}} processes of how the mind constructs one's self-image. In Mind, Self, and Society (1934), he showed how infants come to know persons first and only later come to know things. According to Mead, thought is both a social and pragmatic process, based on the model of two persons discussing how to solve a problem. Mead’s central concept is the self, the part of an individual’s personality composed of self-awareness and self-image. Our self-image is, in fact, constructed of ideas about what we think others are thinking about us. While we make fun of those who visibly talk to themselves, they have only failed to do what <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>do</b> in keeping the internal conversation to ourselves. Human behavior, Mead stated, is the result of meanings created by the social interaction of conversation, both real and imaginary.|$|E

40|$|The role of {{the federal}} budget in public {{finances}} is not straightforward, writes Jenny Stewart WHY DO governments budget? The official answer is that they budget for the same reason <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>do</b> (well, some of us) : to make plans for the future in financial form, and to monitor progress against those plans. In contrast to individuals, and unlike businesses in the private sector, governments make their budgets public. Knowing the numbers helps members of parliament, and citizens, understand what the government plans to do with our money – or at least, that is the theory. In practice, in keeping with the theatrical trimmings that attend their presentation, public sector budgets are as much about political capital as they are about the financial variety. Few readers of the voluminous budget papers will pore over every detail. And even Senate estimates committees, whose members cross-examine public servants about the administrative aspects of their agencies’ budgetary estimates, focus on just a few issues. Budget night gives treasurers a rare opportunity to take centre stage, without a prime minister or premier hanging over their shoulder (or, worse still, upstaging them completely). If the news is bad, they tell it like it is, being careful, of course, to blame the situation on forces beyond their control. Inevitably, there are winners and losers. The winners (always announced first) are linked with the major themes of the budget: the most recent federal budget, awash with anti-recessionary spending, featured nation-building and the fair go. Not surprisingly, the losers receive less attention. In the last budget, they included two disparate groups: higher income earners with private health insurance, and those who will have to wait until they are sixty-seven before they qualify for the pension (which means anyone born after January 1957 – potentially a very large group indeed). Increasingly, though, budget night has a somewhat anti-climactic air about it. Speculation, rather than news, is what keeps the media excited, so budgets are about managing expectations as well as money. Key details will have been issued in advance, so that unpleasant surprises on the night are kept to a minimum. Most of us feared that the most recent federal budget would be horrific – when it actually appeared, it was much milder than we had expected. It would be a serious mistake, though, to place too much store on the numbers put forward on budget night. Programs foreshadowed to commence down the track may never materialise or, where additional or special legislation is required, may be defeated in the Senate. A budget is a financial work-in-progress, not a reality. Even the numbers relating to the budget year itself may be subject to rapid and substantial change, both on the revenue and the expenditure sides. In May, the federal government has a fairly good idea of the fiscal outcome from the soon-to-be completed year. But often there is not much resemblance between that outcome and the one that was projected in the previous year’s budget. This is not because the government is deceiving us. It is because economies are constantly changing and no one, certainly no one in the Treasury, knows what is going to happen. (If they did, they would not be in the Treasury, but making squillions in the private sector.) We might agree that changing economic conditions will affect revenue and expenditures in ways that are hard to predict. But what about the government’s policy-related choices: the new programs it is going to fund, and the old ones it is going to axe? Surely it is reasonable to expect that these will be presented (and projected) accurately in the budget?It is true that the government tells us on budget night about all those policies it knows about. But politics being the business that it is, new policies keep popping up right through the year. And in the lead-up to elections, the spending can become frenetic. In times past, the full implications of these emerging choices were not publicly known until the next budget appeared (accompanied, if the government changed, by much hand-wringing about the ineptitude of the previous lot). At least now (through the Charter of Budget Honesty that the Howard government legislated in 1998) we are told about these new policies and their financial implications when the mid-year economic and fiscal outlook is issued in December. For example, in 2006, in what proved to be the last full year of the Howard government, $ 2 billion worth of new spending was decided upon between May, when the budget was presented, and December, when the Outlook was issued. The Rudd government, not to be outdone, brought in $ 3 billion of new policies in the wake of its first budget. Coincidentally, or perhaps not, these amounts almost exactly balanced the spending opportunities that had arisen because of so-called parameter variations – increases in revenue or decreases in expenditure that occur as a result of unanticipated economic and other changes. Far from being an instrument of longer term planning, the budget is held hostage, not only by politics, but by its role in macroeconomic management. When spending is ramped up in times of recession, and pruned back in times of higher growth, it is difficult to maintain a steady course in relation to public investment, particularly when borrowing is frowned upon (except in emergencies). So we have the spectacle of the government spending up big on infrastructure-related projects in order to stimulate the economy, after years of grimly accumulating surpluses. At the same time, when more money comes in than was expected (as was the case before the financial crisis hit) the temptation to spend it on politically favourable projects is almost overwhelming. All this is made possible by the glorious flexibility that budgets provide. Provided that spending is properly authorised (that is, there is an appropriation for it), governments do not have to abide by their budgetary intentions. Indeed, there is no formal requirement for them to have a budget at all. So, what is all the fuss about? Why the enormous effort to produce budget papers that go into the most minute detail of agency activity? Twenty years ago the Commonwealth budget papers numbered a mere 600 pages. Now they are 10, 000 and growing. Much of this additional documentation is directed towards making it clearer at agency level how much money is being spent, on what, and to what effect. The idea was to enhance both the managerial capacity and the accountability of government. Both objectives have proved elusive. It is a bit hard to manage well when your financial parameters fluctuate wildly from one year to the next. Accountability for results becomes problematic as well. How can public servants be held responsible for outcomes when their power to influence them is so qualified? Perhaps this is why, after years of requiring agencies to report their spending in terms of outputs (that is, the impacts or effects of their activities), in the most recent budget departments are obliged, once again, to report {{on the basis of the}} actual programs for which appropriations are made. So, after almost a decade of continuous change, we are now going back (sort of) to the situation that obtained from roughly the early to the late- 1990 s, when agencies produced program-based budget statements. These were much easier to use and to understand than the more elaborate and ambitious productions that succeeded them, so the hardy tribe of budget-paper aficionados will be pleased. Has all the effort that has gone into improving the way government finances are reported upon been worth it? It seems to me that, as they labour unremittingly to achieve perfection in budget-related reporting, the Finance people are a little like librarians who agonise endlessly over the perfect bibliographic description of a new book, when all the users want to know is where to find it. •Jenny Stewart is Associate Professor of Public Policy at the University of Canberra.
