These new actors on the scene do not yet have a standard name; my proposed term is 'Soroi'.|$|E
25|$|<b>There</b> <b>really</b> <b>are</b> two {{different}} kinds of DDD: Inside and Outside Abraded Die Doubling. This is because Die Deterioration Doubling manifests itself in {{two different}} ways. The two classes look different, and are caused by wear in two different places. Inside Abraded Die Doubling is caused by wear around the edges and inside the actual detail affected. It appears as an enlarged, irregular outline of the element overlapping the original design element. Outside Abraded Die Doubling is caused by actual wear {{in the field of}} the die. The field of a die is the highest point, so when a mint technician polishes the die or the metal flow of a coin wears it away, the field is the first thing to be worn down. The difference here is that Outside doubling does not overlap any of the original design, but rather appears like an irregular shelf around the object.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} morning Kennedy and Edelman met with Secretary of Agriculture Orville Freeman, and angrily criticized the food stamp program for charging families {{that had no}} income. Freeman deflected, [...] "Bob, there isn't anyone in America who has no income." [...] Kennedy replied, [...] "I'll tell you what. I'll send Peter [...] here back down there with some of your people... Will you agree that you'll change the regulations if your people are convinced <b>there</b> <b>really</b> <b>are</b> people in Mississippi who have no income?" [...] Freeman agreed, and was eventually persuaded by incoming evidence to open up access to food stamps.|$|E

500|$|Through the story, Armstrong {{hoped to}} detail {{coming of age}} in America {{at the time of the}} album's release. While he {{considered}} their previous record heartfelt, he felt a more instinctual feeling to speak for the time period in which the album was released. He had felt the desire to increase the amount of political content in his lyricism as he grew into adulthood, noting that the [...] "climate" [...] surrounding his aging produced feelings of responsibility in the songs he wrote. Armstrong said, [...] "As soon as you abandon the verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge song structure ... it opens up your mind to this different way of writing, where <b>there</b> <b>really</b> <b>are</b> no rules." [...] In addition to the album's political content, it also touches on interpersonal relationships and what Dirnt labeled [...] "confusion and loss of individuality." ...|$|E
500|$|Astronaut Buzz Aldrin {{called the}} visual effects [...] "remarkable", and said, [...] "I was so extravagantly {{impressed}} by the portrayal {{of the reality of}} zero gravity. Going through the space station was done just the way that I've seen people do it in reality. The spinning is going to happen—maybe not quite that vigorous—but certainly we've been fortunate that people haven't been in those situations yet. I think it reminds us that <b>there</b> <b>really</b> <b>are</b> hazards in the space business, especially in activities outside the spacecraft." [...] Former NASA astronaut Garrett Reisman said, [...] "The pace and story was definitely engaging and I think it was the best use of the 3-D IMAX medium to date. Rather than using the medium as a gimmick, Gravity uses it to depict a real environment that is completely alien to most people. But the question that most people want me to answer is, how realistic was it? The very fact that the question is being asked so earnestly {{is a testament to the}} verisimilitude of the movie. When a bad science fiction movie comes out, no one bothers to ask me if it reminded me of the real thing." ...|$|E
2500|$|TV Barn {{called the}} first episode [...] "not to be missed", adding that [...] "Although <b>there</b> <b>really</b> <b>are</b> only two main story lines, each episode has no fewer than six stories to keep track of, full of {{suspense}} and action-packed (without seeming like a big-bang action movie). There's {{a lot going on}} in 24, but you {{have to pay attention to}} truly appreciate it. I predict 24 will have a lot of viewers' undivided attention this fall." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1903, Harry Byrd {{took over}} his father's newspaper, the Winchester Star. Under his father's ownership, {{it came to}} owe $2500 (...) to its {{newsprint}} supplier, the Antietam Paper Company. The company refused to ship more newsprint on credit, so Byrd cut a deal to make daily cash payments in return for ownership. As Byrd would later say, [...] "when you have to hunt for them that way, {{you get to know}} how many cents <b>there</b> <b>really</b> <b>are</b> in a dollar." [...] He eventually bought the Harrisonburg Daily News-Record and several other papers in the Shenandoah Valley; his family still owns these papers today.|$|E
2500|$|Many reformers – Galbraith is {{not alone}} in this – have as their basic {{objection}} to a free market that it frustrates them in achieving their reforms, because it enables people to have what they want, not what the reformers want. Hence every reformer has a strong tendency to be averse to a free market.Nobel Prize-winning economist Robert Solow, in a review of The New Industrial State, points at Galbraith's lack for empiricism and selectiveness in the his use of evidence. He points out that [...] "It may be unjust and pointless to consider the degree of literal truth of each of the assertions that make up this argument. One would hardly discuss Gulliver's Travels by debating whether <b>there</b> <b>really</b> <b>are</b> any little people, or criticize the Grande Jatte because objects aren't made up of tiny dots. Nevertheless, it may help to judge the truth of Galbraith's." ...|$|E
2500|$|When he {{rejected}} the film, Porat reportedly said, [...] "People will think that <b>there</b> <b>really</b> <b>are</b> murders taking place here. In fact, the film opens with the line, [...] "All of the events described in this film are fictional—except for one", leading the audience to wonder which one it is. That is not, however, the only reference to real events in Israeli television. The Hebrew name of the film, רצח, מצלמים (Retzach, metzalmim, literally, [...] "Murder, we're filming"), is a play on {{the name of a}} popular TV show, שקט, מצלמים (Sheket, metzalmim, or [...] "Quiet, we're filming"), and among the subplots are a news story about striking workers (a continuation of the story Loevy began in Bread) (other news stories being covered throughout the film include tensions between religious and secular, men and women, the unemployed and the wealthy, Arabs and Jews, and new immigrants—the detective investigating the murders is a Russian immigrant, who once served in the KGB and the FBI).|$|E

"The real, vital difficulty, after all, in our American life is, {{that our}} country is so wide, so various, so abounding in the richest fields of enterprise, that in every {{direction}} the cry is of the plenteousness of the harvest and the fewness of the laborers.

They seem to imagine that inasmuch as, {{while there is no}} such thing in existence as a hobgoblin, <b>there</b> <b>really</b> <b>are</b> policemen and prisons, they only half tell an untruth by saying to the recalcitrant little one that a policeman is coming to carry him off to jail.|$|E

60|$|In my judgment, Protestants lose a {{great deal}} of time in a false attack when they labour to convict the Romanists of false doctrines. Destroy the Papacy, and help the priests to wives, and I am much mistaken if the doctrinal errors, such as <b>there</b> <b>really</b> <b>are,</b> would not very soon pass away. They might remain in terminis, but they would lose their sting and body, and lapse back into figures of rhetoric and warm devotion, from which they, most of them,--such as transubstantiation, and prayers for the dead and to saints,--originally sprang. But, so long as the Bishop of Rome remains Pope, and has an army of Mamelukes all over the world, we shall do very little by {{fulminating}} against mere doctrinal errors. In the Milanese, and elsewhere in the north of Italy, I am told there is a powerful feeling abroad against the Papacy. That district seems to be something in the state of England in the reign of our Henry the Eighth.|$|E
60|$|But the {{difficulty}} {{in the case of}} the cat is nothing compared to {{the difficulty}} in the case of human beings. When human beings speak--that is, when we hear certain noises which we associate with ideas, and simultaneously see certain motions of lips and expressions of face--it is very difficult to suppose that what we hear is not the expression of a thought, as we know it would be if we emitted the same sounds. Of course similar things happen in dreams, where we are mistaken as to the existence of other people. But dreams are more or less suggested by what we call waking life, and are capable of being more or less accounted for on scientific principles if we assume that there really is a physical world. Thus every principle of simplicity urges us to adopt the natural view, that <b>there</b> <b>really</b> <b>are</b> objects other than ourselves and our sense-data which have an existence not dependent upon our perceiving them.|$|E
