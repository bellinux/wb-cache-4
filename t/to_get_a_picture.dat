Leibovitz promised Lennon that a photo with Ono would make the front cover of the magazine, even though she initially tried <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> with Lennon by himself. Leibovitz said, [...] "Nobody wanted [...] on the cover". Lennon insisted that both {{he and his wife}} be on the cover, and after taking the pictures, Leibovitz left their apartment at 3:30p.m. After the photo shoot, Lennon gave what would be his last interview, to San Francisco DJ Dave Sholin, for a music show to be broadcast on the RKO Radio Network. At 5:40p.m., Lennon and Ono, delayed by a late limousine, left their {{apartment to}} mix the song [...] "Walking on Thin Ice" [...] (an Ono song featuring Lennon on lead guitar) at the Record Plant Studio.|$|E

2500|$|On December 8, 1980, Leibovitz had a {{photo shoot}} with John Lennon for Rolling Stone, and she promised him he would make the cover. She had {{initially}} tried <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> with just Lennon alone, as Rolling Stone wanted, but Lennon insisted that both he and Yoko Ono be on the cover. Leibovitz then tried to re-create something like the kissing scene from the couple's Double Fantasy 1980 album cover, a picture Leibovitz loved, and she had John remove his clothes and curl up next to Yoko on the floor. Leibovitz recalls, [...] "What is interesting is she said she'd take her top off and I said, 'Leave everything on'not really preconceiving the picture at all. Then he curled up {{next to her and}} it was very, very strong. You couldn't help but feel that he was cold and {{he looked like he was}} clinging on to her. I think it was amazing to look at the first Polaroid and they were both very excited. John said, 'You've captured our relationship exactly. Promise me it'll be on the cover.' I looked him in the eye and we shook on it." [...] Leibovitz was the last person to professionally photograph Lennonhe was shot and killed five hours later.|$|E

2500|$|The former {{hotel has}} been called the [...] "birthplace of cable {{television}}". In 1948, the Hotel Astoria was the site of the [...] "world's first cable television system", invented by L. E. [...] "Ed" [...] Parsons, then owner of Astoria radio station KAST. Ed Parsons set up the first U.S. cable television system to use coaxial cable and a community antenna to deliver TV signals to an area that otherwise {{would not have been able}} to receive broadcast TV signals. [...] The first television station in the Pacific Northwest was inaugurated in November 1948 by Seattle radio station KRSC, now KING-TV. [...] Astoria being about [...] from Seattle, Parsons [...] "was unable <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> in his apartment, even with a high antenna". His apartment was located across the street from the eight-story Hotel Astoria, and with permission from the hotel's manager he set up an antenna on the building's roof and ran coaxial cable from there to his apartment. [...] The set-up worked, and Parsons and his wife were the only people in Astoria able to view television, starting on Thanksgiving Day 1948. [...] "Reception was not of a quality that would be saleable today," [...] Parsons told The Oregonian in 1972, [...] "but we received a picture and started attracting guests." [...] The couple quickly became overwhelmed by requests from friends and neighbors eager to pay them a visit to experience the new medium. To appease them, Parsons laid a second cable to a TV set in the hotel's lobby, and by the end of December a nearby music store was the third hook-up. [...] Parsons then began setting up cable television connections to area households, with 25 receiving the service by mid-March 1949 and 100 by July. Some time later, Parsons moved his community antenna from the roof of the Hotel Astoria to a separate location elsewhere in town and also added a second antenna site.|$|E
