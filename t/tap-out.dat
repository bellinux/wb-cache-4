25|$|Construction of SkyTrain fare {{gates was}} {{completed}} in May 2014 but they remained unclosed until April 2016 owing to multiple system problems. While open for the nearly two-year period, holders of paper-based monthly passes, bus-issued transfers, and FareSaver tickets continued {{to pass through the}} gates into the stations' fare-paid zones unimpeded, although they were subject to having their fare inspected by transit security or transit police once inside the fare-paid zone. Starting in April 2016, they were initially fully closed only during peak hours, with one gate remaining open during off-peak times for people with accessibility issues who could not reach their Compass Cards to the fare gates to tap in or out. Full implementation of the fare gates was also delayed by problems with Compass Cards when riders were tapping out as they exited buses. The tapping-out process on buses was too slow and did not always record the tap which—because the system initially deducted a three-zone fare until a <b>tap-out</b> was recorded and a refund was issued to those having only travelled one or two zones—often resulted in customers being charged for travelling through three zones when in fact they had only travelled through one or two. This was a serious setback for TransLink as the entire system was supposed to be operational by 2013. A solution was finally implemented where the requirement to tap out of buses was removed and all bus travel was considered as within a single zone, creating significant savings for those travelling multiple zones using buses only and in some cases changing transit usage patterns. The last fare gates left open for users with accessibility issues were closed on July 25, 2016, and the system has been in full operation since.|$|E
2500|$|Passengers can {{purchase}} a single-journey paper ticket at the ticket booth in the shelter. In 2013, TransJakarta introduced {{the use of}} prepaid cards or e-tickets for passenger use. The prepaid cards that are eligible as ticket are bank-issued cards of BRI BRizzi, BCA Flazz, BNI Tapcash, Mandiri e-money, Bank DKI JakCard, and Bank Mega MegaCash. The prepaid cards can be purchased and topped-up at any ticket booth in the shelter throughout the system, or at the ATM of the issuing bank. The prepaid cards, except for Bank DKI JakCard and Bank Mega MegaCash, are also valid as ticket in the Jabodetabek Commuter Train system as of June 2014, easing the integration plan between the BRT and the commuter train system. In April and May 2014, the TransJakarta management started the compulsory use of the e-tickets at several terminus in the system, based on news said that the BCA Flazz Card {{can also be used}} in Jabodetabek Commuter Train. In mid-October 2014, 56 percent passengers have used e-tickets. Now, all TransJakarta corridors and shelters applied the compulsory use of the e-tickets, since February 21, 2015. August 17, 2016 marks the start of <b>tap-out</b> system trial in Corridor 1 (Blok M - Kota), while similar trial was started on September 9, 2016 in Corridor 2. The system is meant to control the flow of people {{going in and out of}} the shelters, discourage illegal entrance to and exit from the shelters, and to encourage sales and usage of the [...] "e-tickets". In October 2016, the system had been implemented in all corridors of TransJakarta.|$|E
50|$|Dedicated {{to protect}} all {{innocent}} life in haunted {{memory of his}} own tragic past, <b>Tap-Out</b> became Glyph's bodyguard and a protector to the planet's humanoid inhabitants. Some 300 years later, {{he became aware of}} the arrival of Primal Prime's Wreckers when the naive CatSCAN wandered into a primitive camp. Attacking without bothering to answer questions, <b>Tap-Out</b> was thwarted by CatSCAN's initial non-harmful strike and then by the timely arrival of Primal Prime and the other Wreckers. <b>Tap-Out</b> apologized for his behavior, and presumably joined the Wreckers alongside Glyph after Cyclonus absconded with an alien energy source from the planet upon which he had crashed. When the Wreckers left Archa 9 they took <b>Tap-Out</b> with them, but left CatSCAN and Glyph on the planet.|$|E

50|$|The {{statistics}} of the match, unlike the drawn Grand Final, were mostly dominated by Collingwood. Collingwood beat St Kilda for disposals (379-326), kicks (250-178), marks (121-84) and tackles (87-67), while St Kilda had more handpasses than Collingwood (148-129). Collingwood was particularly dominant at ruck contests, winning 47 <b>tap-outs</b> to St Kilda's 26.|$|R
50|$|In 2009 Cloke {{moved out}} of the main ruck position, playing more {{exclusively}} as a tall forward who would take ruck <b>tap-outs</b> in the forward line. He struggled to maintain a regular position in the Carlton lineup, playing 10 games with the Blues and half of the season with Carlton's , the Northern Bullants, where he scored 39 goals in 13 games, including five in a losing grand final, to be the Bullants' leading goalkicker for the year. On 24 August 2009, Cloke was suspended by Carlton for one game for being late to a recovery session. Cloke was delisted by Carlton on 13 November 2009.|$|R

5000|$|Eason was {{a talented}} and {{hard-working}} player, nicknamed [...] "Bunny" [...] {{because of his}} speed. His accuracy with both kicking (particularly stab-kicking) and handpassing were highly regarded, as was his ability to win the ball from either his or his opponents' ruck <b>tap-outs,</b> and he {{was considered one of}} the finest rovers in Victoria in the early 1920s. He had two fingers on his right hand missing, but this did not greatly affect his skill. He is a member of Geelong's Hall of Fame and was named on the interchange bench of the club's Team of the Century. His brother Bill Eason also played for Geelong, and served as captain for four years.|$|R
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that n-doped resistive heaters in silicon waveguides show photoconductive effects with high responsivities. These photoconductive heaters, integrated into microring resonator (MRR) -based filters, {{were used to}} automatically tune and stabilize the filter's resonance wavelength to the input laser's wavelength. This is achieved without requiring dedicated defect implantations, additional material depositions, dedicated photodetectors, or optical power <b>tap-outs.</b> Automatic wavelength stabilization of first-order MRR and second-order series-coupled MRR filters is experimentally demonstrated. Open eye diagrams were obtained for data transmission at 12. 5 Gb/s while the temperature was varied by 5 C {{at a rate of}} 0. 28 C/s. We theoretically show that series-coupled MRR-based filters of any order can be automatically tuned by using photoconductive heaters to monitor the light intensity in each MRR, and sequentially aligning the resonance of each MRR to the laser's wavelength...|$|R
50|$|At his peak, Judd was {{the best}} midfielder {{in the game and}} is widely {{regarded}} as one of the best players of the 2000s decade. The strengths and traits of Judd's playing style were different between his time at West Coast and his time at Carlton, and he has been widely lauded for his proficiency at both. At West Coast, while he was a strong ball-winner, it was as an outside midfielder and ball-user where he distinguished himself. He possessed a combination of explosive speed, acceleration, agility and core strength which few if any players in the league could match; these attributes gave him the ability to receive the ball in traffic, then break free from or weave around taggers and opponents, allowing him to take clearing kicks in open space which were damaging to opposition teams. By the time he had joined Carlton, he had lost much of his acceleration and agility owing to the groin injuries he suffered in 2007. He overcame this by converting his game style to predominantly inside ball-winning role. By virtue of his core strength and balance, he became one of the best in the league at receiving ruck <b>tap-outs,</b> and riding or shaking off tackles in packs and congestion to win clearing handpasses to Carlton's outside midfielders.|$|R
