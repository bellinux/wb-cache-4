5|$|The series {{tells the}} story of the {{citizens}} of Kurōzu-cho, a fictional city which is plagued by a supernatural curse involving spirals. The story for Uzumaki originated when Ito attempted <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> about people living in a very long terraced house, and he was inspired to use a spiral shape to achieve the desired length. Ito believes the horror of Uzumaki is effective due to its subversion of symbols which are normally positively portrayed in Japanese media, and its theme of protagonists struggling against a mysterious force stronger than themselves.|$|E
5|$|Chris Chibnall wanted <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> that {{tackled the}} issue of loss and {{revolved}} around a missing person case. Executive producer Russell T Davies appreciated the character dynamics and domestic themes in the episode and cited the script {{as one of his}} inspirations in continuing the series. Ruth Jones, who is generally better known for her comedic roles, was cast against type in the central guest role of Nikki Bevan. The episode was filmed largely on location in South Wales with the island of Flat Holm featuring prominently. Response to the episode was generally positive. Reviewers generally praised the episode for illuminating the conflicting elements of Gwen's character and providing a central dilemma with no easy answer. Some critics identified ostensible plot holes, though felt that the episode's emotional successes negated these.|$|E
5|$|Fleming {{retained}} {{an interest}} in the subject and when Sillitoe suggested to the editor of The Sunday Times, Denis Hamilton, that the paper may want <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> on the International Diamond Security Organisation, Hamilton offered the story to Fleming. Sillitoe also offered his deputy, retired MI5 officer John Collard, as liaison for Fleming to interview. During World War II, Collard had assisted in the planning of Operation Overlord as part of MI11 and had joined MI5 under Sillitoe at the war's end. Whilst in MI5 he {{played a major role in}} the capture and conviction of the atomic spy Klaus Fuchs, before Sillitoe had approached him in 1954 to work for the International Diamond Security Organisation.|$|E

50|$|I {{set out in}} Marty <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> love <b>story,</b> {{the most}} {{ordinary}} love story in the world. I didn't want my hero to be handsome, and I didn't want the girl to be pretty. I wanted <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> love <b>story</b> the way it would literally have happened {{to the kind of}} people I know... The actor who played Marty, Rod Steiger, {{is one of the most}} gifted young actors in the theater, and I owe him a genuine debt of gratitude for all that he contributed to this show.|$|R
5|$|The first {{strand of}} the novel follows Hollis Henry, {{a former member of}} the early 1990s cult band The Curfew and a {{freelance}} journalist. She is hired by advertising mogul Hubertus Bigend <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> for his nascent magazine Node (described as a European Wired) about the use of locative technology in the art world. Helped by curator Odile Richard she investigates Los Angeles artist Alberto Corrales, who recreates virtually the deaths of celebrities such as River Phoenix. Corrales leads her to Bobby Chombo, an expert in geospatial technologies who handles Corrales' technical requirements. Chombo's background is troubleshooting navigation systems for the United States military. He is reclusive and paranoid, refusing to sleep in the same GPS grid square on consecutive nights, and only consents to talk to Hollis due to his admiration for The Curfew.|$|E
5|$|The novel has {{pervasive}} lesbian themes, {{concentrating on}} eroticism and self-discovery. Waters {{was working on}} a PhD dissertation in English literature when she decided <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> she would like to read. Employing her love for the variety of people and districts in London, she consciously chose an urban setting. As opposed to previous lesbian-themed fiction she had read where the characters escape an oppressive society to live apart from it, Waters chose characters who interact with their surroundings. She has acknowledged that the book imagines a lesbian presence and history in Victorian London where none was recorded. The main character's experiences in the theatrical profession and her perpetual motion through the city allow her to make observations on social conditions while exploring the issues of gender, sexism, and class difference.|$|E
5|$|Ganino and Stillwell {{completed}} their new combined story {{in about a}} week. The writers spent hours each day at Stillwell's apartment working over every detail; they felt pressured <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> Piller would find acceptable, as they wanted {{to have the opportunity}} to write the teleplay. The story treatment was turned in on October 10. Piller immediately decided to purchase the story and distributed the treatment to the writing staff while he discussed changes. Piller felt that Data's romantic feelings for TashaYar were over the top, and that an alien probe which served as a central part of the story was a cheat in terms of resolving Picard's dilemma. The writer wanted Ganino and Stillwell to enhance Guinan's role and to find another character arc for TashaYar. A revised treatment was submitted on October 29, incorporating Piller's changes. The writers were not involved in development of the teleplay. They were each paid the Writers Guild minimum of $2400.|$|E

5|$|While {{the entire}} script {{was still in}} the draft phase, Maeda revised lines that felt unnatural after asking others for their {{opinions}} on it, including Na-Ga. When writing the script, Maeda made a conscious effort to write Charlotte in the framework of an anime series, as opposed to when he wrote the script for Angel Beats!, which he admits he wrote more akin to the framework of a video game. In this way, Toba felt that Charlotte was Maeda's effort <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> in its purest form that could not be made into a video game, unlike Angel Beats!. Toba also noted that the characters in Charlotte are not written for a video game scenario, especially the protagonist, and went on to echo Horikawa's sentiment that Charlotte is akin to an I novel for Maeda. Toba explained that this is a result of Maeda's effort to remove the restrictions that come from writing the scenario for a video game.|$|E
25|$|In 1958, Keyes was {{approached}} by Galaxy Science Fiction magazine <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> <b>story,</b> {{at which point the}} elements of Flowers for Algernon fell into place. When the story was submitted to Galaxy, however, editor Horace Gold suggested changing the ending so that Charlie retained his intelligence, married Alice Kinnian, and lived happily ever after. Keyes refused to make the change and sold the story to The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction instead.|$|E
25|$|Nixon decided <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> {{that would}} {{rejuvenate}} {{the show and}} be socially relevant at the same time. This resulted in the series revealing Erica's daughter Bianca as a lesbian. Within the series, Bianca admits the truth to her mother in December 2000. Though initially controversial, the storyline was praised by fans and critics. Bianca emerged as a breakout character and lesbian icon. The show found additional success in the pairing of newcomers Leo and Greenlee (Josh Duhamel and Rebecca Budig).|$|E
25|$|The great trouvère Chrétien de Troyes claims <b>to</b> have <b>written</b> <b>a</b> Tristan <b>story,</b> {{though no}} part of it has ever been found. He {{mentions}} this in the introduction to Cligès, a romance that many see as a kind of anti-Tristan with a happy ending. Some scholars speculate his Tristan was ill-received, prompting Chretien <b>to</b> <b>write</b> Cligès - <b>a</b> <b>story</b> with no Celtic antecedent - to make amends.|$|R

25|$|My idea {{suggested}} to that gentleman was <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> {{in which the}} principal character should be a miser, who had a daughter, and that the struggles of feeling between the love for his child and his love of money, should produce certain effects and results; and as all my ancestors were mixed up in the Rebellion of '45, I suggested that the story should be of that date, in order that I might introduce some scenes and circumstances connected with that great party struggle, and also wishing to let the public of the present day have a peep at the places of public amusement of the period, I took considerable pains to give correct views and descriptions of those places which are now copied and produced upon the stage; and I take this opportunity of complimenting my friend Halliday for the very excellent and effective manner {{in which he has}} dramatised the story.|$|E
25|$|Pulp covers {{were printed}} in color on higher-quality (slick) paper. They were {{famous for their}} half-dressed damsels in distress, usually {{awaiting}} a rescuing hero. Cover art played a major part in the marketing of pulp magazines. The early pulp magazines could boast covers by some distinguished American artists; The Popular Magazine had covers by N.C. Wyeth, and Edgar Franklin Wittmack contributed cover art to Argosy and Short Stories. Later, many artists specialized in creating covers mainly for the pulps; {{a number of the}} most successful cover artists became as popular as the authors featured on the interior pages. Among the most famous pulp artists were Walter Baumhofer, Earle K. Bergey, Margaret Brundage, Edd Cartier, Virgil Finlay, Frank R. Paul, Norman Saunders, Nick Eggenhofer, (who specialized in Western illustrations), Hugh J. Ward, George Rozen, and Rudolph Belarski. Covers were important enough to sales that sometimes they would be designed first; authors would then be shown the cover art and asked <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> to match.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} of Ben-Hurs {{publication}} in 1880, Wallace had already published his first novel, The Fair God; or, The Last of the 'Tzins (1873), and Commodus: An Historical Play (1876) that was never produced. He went on to publish several more novels and biographies, including The Prince of India; or, Why Constantinople Fell (1893), a biography of President Benjamin Harrison in 1888, and The Wooing of Malkatoon (1898), but Ben-Hur remained his most significant work and best-known novel. Humanities editor Amy Lifson named Ben-Hur as the most influential Christian book of the nineteenth century, while others have identified {{it as one of}} the best-selling novels of all time. Carl Van Doren wrote that Ben-Hur was, along with Uncle Tom's Cabin, the first fiction many Americans read. Wallace's original plan was <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> of the biblical Magi as a magazine serial, which he began in 1873, but he had changed its focus by 1874. Ben-Hur begins with the story of the Magi, but the remainder of the novel connects the story of Christ with the adventures of Wallace's fictional character, Judah Ben-Hur.|$|E
50|$|To help {{draw the}} best {{possible}} performance out of the artists working on the series, prior <b>to</b> <b>writing</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> Goodwin would ask the artist what type of story or setting {{he would like to}} work in; this also served to narrow Goodwins thinking, making it easier for him to come up with <b>a</b> <b>story</b> idea. He also <b>wrote</b> <b>a</b> considerable number of adaptations of public domain works for Creepy. Initially, out of a feeling that the original works were over-familiar, he would change either the ending or the beginning of the story when doing these adaptations. Eventually he concluded that this was presumptuous, and began adhering more closely to the original stories.|$|R

500|$|The {{script was}} Davis' first—and only—writing {{contribution}} to the series. Davis, inspired by the Shakespeare play Richard III, wanted <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> wherein The Smoking Man was able to lure Scully in by enticing her with medical knowledge. In addition, [...] "En Ami" [...] was the last episode of The X-Files to be directed by Rob Bowman. The episode's title means [...] "as a friend" [...] in French and also functions as a pun, reading phonetically as [...] "enemy" [...] in English.|$|E
500|$|In [...] "How Orlo Got His Book", he {{described}} Orlo, a fictional, archetypal young {{child who was}} turned off of reading by the poor selection of simple reading material. To save Orlo the frustration, Geisel decided {{to write a book}} for children like Orlo but found the task [...] "not dissimilar to... being lost with a witch in a tunnel of love". He tried <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> called [...] "The Queen Zebra" [...] but found that both words did not appear on the list. In fact, like Geisel wrote in [...] "My Hassle with the First Grade Language", the letters [...] "q" [...] and [...] "z" [...] did not appear on the list at all. He then tried <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> about a bird, without using the word bird as it did not appear on the list. He decided to call it a [...] "wing thing" [...] instead but struggled as he discovered that it [...] "couldn't have legs or a beak or a tail. Neither a left foot or a right foot." [...] On his approach to writing The Cat in the Hat he wrote, [...] "The method I used is the same method you use when you sit down to make apple stroodle [...] without stroodles." ...|$|E

[...] Bratton (who went on to be Superintendent in Chief of the Boston Police Department, Commissioner of the New York City Police Department and Chief of Police of the Los Angeles Police Department) mentioned Brill in his 1998 book, The Turnaround: How America's Top Cop Reversed the Crime Epidemic.|$|R

She had originally intended <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> about zombies, but was discouraged by her editor T-shi and decided to abandon the idea during the third chapter. Asked about her inspiration for writing about the supernatural, Hoshino said that she feared it after seeing the 1973 film, The Exorcist. Although the horror film frightened her, it inspired the author to design the manga's Akumas.|$|E
500|$|Gordon {{claimed that}} he had wanted <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> like [...] "Kaddish" [...] since the first season, but that the [...] "emotional basis" [...] had eluded him. The {{inspiration}} for Gordon was the communal ring featured in the episode. The ring was a real Jewish relic owned by a rabbi who survived the Holocaust. In fact, the rabbi had used it to wed two of Gordon's friends. During that wedding, Gordon developed a [...] "Romeo and Juliet-like" [...] story that revolved around themes of love and wanting to bring a loved one back from the dead.|$|E
500|$|Three of {{the stories}} that later {{appeared}} in Burning Chrome were written in collaboration with other authors: [...] "The Belonging Kind" [...] (1981) with John Shirley, [...] "Red Star, Winter Orbit" [...] (1983) with Sterling, and [...] "Dogfight" [...] (1985) with Michael Swanwick. Gibson had previously written the foreword to Shirley's 1980 novel City Come A-walkin and the pair's collaboration continued when Gibson wrote the introduction to Shirley's short story collection Heatseeker (1989).
