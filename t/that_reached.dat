5|$|The Burns–Hines {{region has}} a high-desert climate but was much wetter {{in the recent}} {{geologic}} past. The Harney Basin was the largest of many depressions in which lakes formed in southeastern Oregon during the late Pleistocene.

5|$|The dodo {{was found}} {{interesting}} enough that living specimens {{were sent to}} Europe and the East. The number of transported dodos <b>that</b> <b>reached</b> their destinations alive is uncertain, and it is unknown how they relate to contemporary depictions and the few non-fossil remains in European museums. Based {{on a combination of}} contemporary accounts, paintings, and specimens, Julian Hume has inferred that at least eleven transported dodos reached their destinations alive.|$|E
5|$|The {{fair amount}} of {{isolated}} fragments and sculptures testify to the many lost works and those <b>that</b> <b>reached</b> us only incompletely, which were clearly of considerable artistic merit. None of these are mentioned in archival documents, apart from the sculptures that accompanied the Caprioli Adoration. On the other hand, the chapel in San Pietro de Dom, commissioned to Gasparo Cairano in 1504 is the only documented work of the sculptor that has been completely lost.|$|E
5|$|The third {{classification}} was {{the mountains}} classification. Points were {{awarded to the}} riders <b>that</b> <b>reached</b> {{the summit of the}} most difficult climbs first.

5|$|UND is {{classified}} by the Carnegie Foundation as a doctoral/research-intensive institution. This level of research activity {{is shown in}} UND's research statistics which, in fiscal year 2006, included program awards <b>that</b> <b>reached</b> $94.3 million, sponsored program expenditures <b>that</b> <b>reached</b> $81.2 million, and an overall research portfolio that included $315 million in total ongoing and committed accounts. Research activity at UND focuses on health sciences, nutrition, energy and environmental protection, aerospace, and engineering. As {{a major component of}} the Red River Valley Research Corridor, UND operates many research units including the Energy and Environmental Research Center, the School of Medicine, the Center for Rural Health, the Center for Innovation, the Upper Midwest Aerospace Consortium, the Bureau of Governmental Affairs, the Bureau of Educational Services and Applied Research, and the Social Science Research Institute. The Energy and Environmental Research Center (EERC), located on the eastern fringes of the UND campus, has been recognized as a leader in researching cleaner, more efficient forms of energy. The EERC operates a number of research units at UND including the National Center for Hydrogen Technology.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the surface}} low {{pressure}} center dissipated, {{the remnants of}} Mitch maintained a circulation aloft <b>that</b> <b>reached</b> the Bay of Campeche on November2. That day, the system began to trigger convection once again. Late on November3, the Hurricane Hunters observed a well-defined low-level center and flight-level winds of 60mph (95km/h). On that basis, the NHC began reissuing advisories on Mitch about 55mi (90km) west-southwest of Campeche, Campeche on the Yucatán Peninsula. Upon reforming, Mitch was moving to the east-northeast, influenced by an approaching cold front. Early on November4, Mitch made landfall just north of Campeche with winds of about 40mph (65km/h), and it quickly weakened into a tropical depression while crossing the Yucatán Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|An Ivory Coast {{international}} between 2002 and 2014, Drogba captained {{the national}} team from 2006 until his retirement from the Ivory Coast team and is the nation's all-time top goalscorer with 65 goals from 104 appearances. He led the Ivory Coast to the 2006 FIFA World Cup, their first appearance in the tournament, and also scored their first goal. He later captained the Ivory Coast at the 2010 and 2014 FIFA World Cups. He {{was part of the}} Ivory Coast teams <b>that</b> <b>reached</b> the final of the Africa Cup of Nations in 2006 and 2012, but were beaten on penalties on both occasions. On 8 August 2014, he announced his retirement from international football.|$|E

5|$|Bastei Verlag, enamoured by {{the success}} of Bessy, asked Vandersteen to provide a second weekly series. With the {{popularity}} of superheroes, especially Batman, in Belgium and Germpany in these years, Vandersteen proposed a spinoff series of Suske en Wiske, based on Jerom, the strongman of the series. Called Wastl in German, 173 stories were produced between 1968 and 1972, with a publication <b>that</b> <b>reached</b> 150,000 copies at its summit. The best of these stories were published in Dutch as well, just like it was done with the later Bessys, but the weakness of the stories ended the series after only four years.|$|E
5|$|Cameras on the Galileo {{spacecraft}} observed {{fragments of}} Comet Shoemaker–Levy9 between 16 and 22 July 1994 as they collided with Jupiter's southern hemisphere {{at a speed}} of approximately 60kilometres per second. This was the first direct observation of an extraterrestrial collision of solar system objects. While the impacts {{took place on the}} side of Jupiter hidden from Earth, Galileo, then at a distance of 1.6AU from the planet, was able to see the impacts as they occurred. Its instruments detected a fireball <b>that</b> <b>reached</b> a peak temperature of about 24,000K, compared to the typical Jovian cloudtop temperature of about 130K (−143°C), with the plume from the fireball reaching a height of over 3,000km.|$|E

He also helped the team to the semi-finals of UEFA Euro 1996, scoring a goal against Scotland which was described {{as one of the best}} of the tournament.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Hattie moved ashore in British Honduras with a storm tide {{of up to}} 14feet (4.3m) near Belize City, a city of 31,000people {{located at}} sea-level; its only {{defenses}} against the storm tide were a small seawall and a strip of swamp lands. The capital experienced high waves and a 10ft (3m) storm tide along its waterfront <b>that</b> <b>reached</b> the third story of some buildings. A trained observer estimated winds of over 150mph (240km/h), and winds in the territory were unofficially estimated as strong as 200mph (325km/h). When Hattie affected the area, most buildings in Belize City were wooden, and most of this type were destroyed. Offshore, the hurricane heavily damaged 80% of the Belize Barrier Reef, although the reef recovered after the storm.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Ida {{originated}} from a weak tropical wave <b>that</b> <b>reached</b> the western Caribbean on November1, 2009. By November2, the system spawned {{an area of}} low pressure north of Panama which moved very little over the following days. The low became increasingly organized within a favorable environment that allowed deep convection to develop. By November4, the low had become sufficiently organized for the National Hurricane Center (NHC) to classify it as Tropical Depression Eleven. At this time, the tropical depression was situated just southwest of San Andrés Island. Convective banding features became increasingly defined throughout the day, and six hours after becoming a tropical depression, the system intensified into Tropical Storm Ida.|$|E

5|$|In Armenia, the {{strategically}} important city of Theodosiopolis (Erzurum) surrendered in 609 or 610 to Ashtat Yeztayar, {{because of}} the persuasion {{of a man who}} claimed to be Theodosius, the eldest son and co-emperor of Maurice, who had supposedly fled to the protection of Khosrow. In 608, the Persians launched a raid into Anatolia <b>that</b> <b>reached</b> Chalcedon, across the Bosphorus from Constantinople. The Persian conquest was a gradual process; by the time of Heraclius' accession the Persians had conquered all Roman cities east of the Euphrates and in Armenia before moving on to Cappadocia, where their general Shahin took Caesarea. There, Phocas' son-in-law Priscus, who had encouraged Heraclius and his father to rebel, started a year-long siege to trap them inside the city.|$|E
5|$|In Chapter XVI, Poe recounts Captain James Cook's circumnavigation of {{the globe}} aboard the Resolution <b>that</b> <b>reached</b> 70°10' latitude. He also drew from A Narrative of Four Voyages (1832), an account by Benjamin Morrell that became a bestseller. A Narrative of Four Voyages may have given Poe {{the idea of the}} {{summarized}} title of his novel. Poe may have used these real-life accounts in an attempt to hoax his readers into believing the novel was an autobiographical narrative by Pym.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, Saigon {{designers}} {{tightened the}} fit of the ao dai to create the version commonly seen today. Trần Kim of Thiết Lập Tailors and Dũng of Dũng Tailors created a dress with raglan sleeves and a diagonal seam that runs from the collar to the underarm. Madame Nhu, first lady of South Vietnam, popularized a collarless version beginning in 1958. The ao dai was most popular from 1960 to 1975. A brightly colored áo dài hippy was introduced in 1968. The áo dài mini, a version designed for practical use and convenience, had slits that extended above the waist and panels <b>that</b> <b>reached</b> only to the knee.|$|E
