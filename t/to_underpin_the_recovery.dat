40|$|The Great Depression was {{the most}} devastating and {{destructive}} economic event to afflict the global economy {{since the beginning of}} the twentieth century. What, then, were the origins of the Great Depression and what have we learned about the appropriate policy responses to economic depressions from that episode? This essay reviews two recently published books on the Great Depression. Eric Rauchway's The Money Makers: How Roosevelt and Keynes Ended the Depression, Defeated Fascism, and Secured a Prosperous Peace (Basic Books, 2015) tells the story of the ways Franklin D. Roosevelt drew on the ideas of John Maynard Keynes to place monetary policy front-and-center <b>to</b> <b>underpin</b> <b>the</b> <b>recovery</b> from the Great Depression and to underwrite the blueprint of the Bretton-Woods System. Barry Eichengreen's Hall of Mirrors: The Great Depression, the Great Recession, and the Uses - and Misuses - of History (Oxford University Press, 2015) shows the way the lessons learned from analysis of the Great Depression helped shape policy makers' response to the 2007 - 08 financial crisis, thus helping to avoid many of the mistakes made by policy makers in the 1930...|$|E
40|$|This communique {{presents}} the agreed {{positions of the}} participants in the G 20 Brisbane Summit, as well as key documents, and issues for further action. Introduction Raising global growth to deliver better living standards and quality jobs for people across the world is our highest priority. We welcome stronger growth in some key economies. But <b>the</b> global <b>recovery</b> is slow, uneven and not delivering the jobs needed. The global economy is being held back by a shortfall in demand, while addressing supply constraints is key to lifting potential growth. Risks persist, including in financial markets and from geopolitical tensions. We commit to work in partnership to lift growth, boost economic resilience and strengthen global institutions. We are determined to overcome these challenges and step up our efforts to achieve strong, sustainable and balanced growth, and to create jobs. We are implementing structural reforms to lift growth and private sector activity, recognising that well-functioning markets underpin prosperity. We will ensure our macroeconomic policies are appropriate to support growth, strengthen demand and promote global rebalancing. We will continue to implement fiscal strategies flexibly, taking into account near-term economic conditions, while putting debt as a share of GDP on a sustainable path. Our monetary authorities have committed to support <b>the</b> <b>recovery</b> and address deflationary pressures when needed, consistent with their mandates. We will be mindful of the global impacts of our policies and cooperate to manage spillovers. We stand ready to use all policy levers <b>to</b> <b>underpin</b> confidence and <b>the</b> <b>recovery.</b> This year we set an ambitious goal to lift the G 20 ’s GDP by at least an additional two per cent by 2018. Analysis by the IMF-OECD indicates that our commitments, if fully implemented, will deliver 2. 1 per cent. This will add more than US$ 2 trillion to the global economy and create millions of jobs. Our measures to lift investment, increase trade and competition, and boost employment, along with our macroeconomic policies, will support development and inclusive growth, and help to reduce inequality and poverty. Our actions to boost growth and create quality jobs are set out in the Brisbane Action Plan and in our comprehensive growth strategies. We will monitor and hold each other to account for implementing our commitments, and actual progress towards our growth ambition, informed by analysis from international organisations. We will ensure our growth strategies continue to deliver and will review progress at our next meeting...|$|R
