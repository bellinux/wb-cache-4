5|$|<b>The</b> <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{bridge was}} formed by pre-casting {{individual}} concrete units on the southern river shore, then hoisting them into place on temporary timber staging in the river. The units were then structurally joined by strands of high-tensile wire and stretched with a hydraulic jack. These pre-stressing strands were anchored in reinforced concrete blocks {{at the ends of}} the spans. The new bridge had a traffic capacity of 6,000 cars per hour in each direction, over a total of six traffic lanes.|$|E
5|$|After regaining the title, Yokozuna {{challenged}} any American {{athlete to}} bodyslam him on <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> USS Intrepid on July 4, 1993. After many challengers failed, Lex Luger arrived by helicopter and bodyslammed Yokozuna. Luger became a fan favorite and changed his gimmick to an American patriot. He faced Yokozuna for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship at SummerSlam 1993; {{he won the}} match by countout but did not win the title. Lex Luger and Bret Hart each earned a title match against Yokozuna the following year at WrestleMania X. Luger was disqualified in his match, but Hart won the championship later that night.|$|E

5|$|At 2pm on Wednesday, March 21, the Spray {{collided}} with the Lucinda four miles north of Barnegat, New Jersey, knocking {{a hole in the}} Sprays bow that resulted in her filling with water; the Lucinda also sustained damage. Capt. Willis of the Lucinda saw no one other than Jackalow (whom he blamed for the collision) on board the Spray, and Jackalow refused to be rescued and taken aboard the Lucinda. Willis observed that <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Spray was strewn with bedding and other articles from the cabin.|$|E
5|$|At {{almost the}} same time as Chesapeake lost control of her helm, her fore-topsail halyard was shot away, her fore-topsail yard then dropped, and she 'luffed up'. Losing her forward momentum, she yawed further into the wind until she was 'in irons', her sails were pressed back against her masts and she then made {{sternway}} (went backwards). Her port stern quarter (rear left corner) made contact with Shannons starboard side, level with the fifth gunport from the bow, and Chesapeake was caught by the projecting fluke of one of Shannons anchors, which had been stowed on the gangway. Chesapeakes spanker boom then swung over <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British ship. Mr Stevens, Broke's boatswain, lashed the boom inboard to keep the two ships together, and lost an arm as he did so.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, the Manahawkin Bay Bridge was {{dedicated}} the Dorland J. Henderson Memorial Bridge {{in honor of}} Dorland J. Henderson, {{who was one of}} NJDOT’s top engineers that designed the lighting system for the Manahawkin Bay Bridge. In September 2009, the NJDOT began repairs to <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Manahawkin Bay Bridge. This project, completed in May 2010, cost $4 million and received funding from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.

5|$|Lex Luger's {{rivalry with}} Yokozuna began on July 4 at the Yokozuna Bodyslam Challenge on <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> USS Intrepid. After several wrestlers and other athletes {{attempted}} to body slam Yokozuna, Luger {{arrived in a}} helicopter. He was able to body slam Yokozuna, {{which led to a}} title shot at SummerSlam. To build support for Luger, the WWF had him ride across the country in a bus named the Lex Express. Yokozuna's spokesperson, Jim Cornette, agreed to the match, but he made Lex Luger agree to two conditions. Luger would not receive a rematch if he lost, and he had to wear protective padding over the steel plate in his forearm.|$|E
5|$|When Olivia Shakespear died in October 1938 in London, Dorothy asked Pound to {{organize}} the funeral, where he saw their 12-year-old son Omar {{for the first time}} in eight years. He visited Eliot and Wyndham Lewis, who produced a now-famous portrait of Pound reclining. In April 1939 he sailed for New York, believing he could stop America's involvement in World War II, happy to answer reporters' questions about Mussolini while he lounged on <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ship in a tweed jacket. He traveled to Washington, D.C. where he met senators and congressmen. His daughter, Mary, said that he had acted out of a sense of responsibility, rather than megalomania; he was offered no encouragement, and was left feeling depressed and frustrated.|$|E
5|$|After {{about half}} of his army had been ferried into Indiana, the Union gunboat USS Elk and an armed private ship, the Grey Eagle, arrived on the scene. The Elk fired a shot into <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Alice Dean as it tried to escape to the shoreline. Both of the Union ships were wooden, and as the Confederate {{artillery}} opened fire, they quickly retreated upriver towards Louisville to avoid being destroyed. The crossing resumed again. In total, it took seventeen hours for Morgan to ferry his now 2,000 men and supplies across the river. By listening in on the telegraph, he learned that Brig. Gen. Edward H. Hobson with a force of 4,000 cavalry was advancing on his position from the south. The lead elements of the Union force arrived in Brandenburg at about 8:00 pm, where the Confederate rearguard was able to delay their advance long enough for Morgan's artillery to be carried across the river. On the last trip across, most of the rearguard was able to escape, but several were left behind and captured.|$|E

5|$|Engin Raghip's {{solicitor}} was now Gareth Peirce– who had {{represented the}} Guildford Four and Birmingham Six, prominent cases of miscarriage of justice– and his barrister Michael Mansfield. Peirce applied for leave to appeal. She began to explore Raghip's mental state, arguing that his confession {{could not be}} relied upon, and arranged {{for him to be}} examined by Dr. Gísli Guðjónsson of the Institute of Psychiatry in London, a specialist in suggestibility; Guðjónsson concluded that Raghip was unusually suggestible, with a mental age of between 10 and 11. Silcott was again represented by Barbara Mills and Braithwaite by Steven Kamlish. Mills noted the lack of photographic or scientific evidence, and argued that Silcott would have been unlikely to stop firefighters from extinguishing a fire on <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tangmere block, given that he was renting a shop there.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to Operation Maslenica, RSK president Goran Hadžić ordered the ARSK to retrieve its tanks from UN storage in Sector West and attack Nova Gradiška and Novska. When local RSK authorities (led by Veljko Džakula in Sector West) demanded {{an explanation of}} the order from Hadžić, he said that the Croatian forces were about to attack Okučani. On 26 January Zabala met with Džakula in Okučani and reassured him that the UNPROFOR would protect Sector West from a Croatian attack, agreeing to provide the RSK with a written guarantee to that effect. Although Hadžić accepted the assurance and cancelled the attack, the orders were reinstated and cancelled three more times over the next two days. On 7 February, Canadian troops drilled <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bridge spanning the Strug Channel (north of Stara Gradiška) to place demolition charges. The move was protested by RSK authorities, who saw the route (the only link between Okučani and Serb-controlled territory in Bosnia and Herzegovina) as crucial to an evacuation {{in the event of an}} anticipated Croatian attack. The situation calmed down by mid-February, and the HV did not attack Sector West.|$|E
5|$|The Allies {{called for}} {{unconditional}} Japanese surrender in the Potsdam Declaration of 27 July, but the Japanese government rejected the call. In early August, the USAAF dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The Allies justified the atomic bombings {{as a military}} necessity to avoid invading the Japanese home islands which would cost the lives of between 250,000 and 500,000 Allied servicemen and millions of Japanese troops and civilians. Between the two bombings, the Soviets, pursuant to the Yalta agreement, invaded Japanese-held Manchuria, and quickly defeated the Kwantung Army, which was the largest Japanese fighting force. The Red Army also captured Sakhalin Island and the Kuril Islands. On 15 August 1945, Japan surrendered, with the surrender documents finally signed at Tokyo Bay on <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> American battleship USS Missouri on 2 September 1945, ending the war.|$|E

5|$|The British arrival was {{reportedly}} greeted with derision by the French sailors, until a boarding party clambered onto the frigate from Bedfords deck, {{to be met}} by resistance from the French crew. Mann then ordered his ship's Royal Marines to fire into the French sailors, killing several and driving many more over the side into the harbour. This attack broke their resolve and the French surrendered, several leaping into the sea to escape capture, only to be collected by the boats of Captain. As Modeste was subdued, the boats of Speedy approached the tartanes. As the boat parties boarded the small French warships, the crew of one surrendered while the other resisted the British boarders. A short melee broke out on <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tartane, resulting in the captain and one other French sailor wounded and the tartane firmly in British hands. The raid completed, the British squadron withdrew from Genoa with their prizes. British sources reported that one French sailor {{had been killed in}} the operation and ten wounded, while the British boarding parties had survived unscathed, while French sources claimed five killed and 30 wounded or in the most extreme accounts, as many as 50 killed.|$|E
5|$|At 19:00 the {{identifying}} {{lights in}} the mizzenmasts of the British fleet were lit. By this time, Guerrier had been completely dismasted and heavily battered. Zealous by contrast was barely touched: Hood had situated Zealous outside the arc {{of most of the}} French ship's broadsides, and in any case Guerrier was not prepared for an engagement on both sides simultaneously, with its port guns blocked by stores. Although their ship was a wreck, the crew of Guerrier refused to surrender, continuing to fire the few functional guns whenever possible despite heavy answering fire from Zealous. In addition to his cannon fire, Hood called up his marines and ordered them to fire volleys of musket shot at <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French ship, driving the crew out of sight but still failing to secure the surrender from Captain Trullet. It was not until 21:00, when Hood sent a small boat to Guerrier with a boarding party, that the French ship finally surrendered. Conquérant was defeated more rapidly, after heavy broadsides from passing British ships and the close attentions of Audacious and Goliath brought down all three masts before 19:00. With his ship immobile and badly damaged, the mortally wounded Captain Etienne Dalbarade struck his colours and a boarding party seized control. Unlike Zealous, these British ships suffered relatively severe damage in the engagement. Goliath lost most of its rigging, suffered damage to all three masts and suffered more than 60 casualties. With his opponents defeated, Captain Gould on Audacious used the spring on his cable to transfer fire to Spartiate, the next French ship in line. To the west of the battle the battered Sérieuse sank over the shoal. Its masts protruded from the water as survivors scrambled into boats and rowed for the shore.|$|E
5|$|The high {{waves and}} winds caused the {{greatest}} marine damage {{in a decade}} around New York City. More than 100boats were overturned or beached in Jamaica Bay, and another 150boats were wrecked between Hell Gate and {{the west end of}} Coney Island. At least ten houseboats were damaged or sank, with boaters injured and requiring rescue. A man attempting to row ashore near Point O' Woods required rescue amid strong winds. Passengers swam safely ashore after their boat capsized in Hell Gate. President Theodore Roosevelt directly experienced the effects of the hurricane while vacationing on the naval yacht Sylph along Long Island. Also on the yacht were Roosvelt's wife, son, his secretary, several friends and members of the press association. The yacht experienced gusty winds and heavy rainfall, along with rough seas, and witnessed a boat capsizing in Hell Gate. Passengers left <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> yacht for safety while their belongings were secured. After the President was considered to be in danger, the yacht headed for land, and instead of embarking toward Ellis Island as originally planned, the yacht landed at Brooklyn Navy Yard. Farther north, high winds downed many trees along coastal Connecticut, which cut telegraph and telephone lines in Bridgeport. A boy was killed in Hartford after stepping onto a downed power line. Several boats were washed ashore along the Connecticut coast. Farther inland, winds disrupted power in Leicester and damaged crops.|$|E
