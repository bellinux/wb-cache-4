500|$|In {{a letter}} to his friend Harry Peach, a fellow member of the Design and Industries Association (DIA), Pick {{explained}} his choice of Holden: [...] "I may say {{that we are going to}} build our stations upon the Morden extension railway to the most modern pattern. We are going to discard entirely all ornament. We are going to build in reinforced concrete. The station will be simply a hole in the wall, everything being sacrificed to the doorway and some notice above to tell you to what the doorway leads. We are going to represent the DIA gone mad, and in order that I may go mad in good company I have got Holden <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> do it properly." ...|$|E
500|$|The Group then {{agreed to}} produce and sell 60 JATO engines to the United States Army Air Corps. To do so they formed the Aerojet Engineering Corporation in March 1942, in which Parsons, Forman, Malina, von Kármán, and Summerfield each {{invested}} $250, opening their offices on Colorado Boulevard and bringing in Amo Smith as their engineer. Andrew G. Haley was recruited by von Kármán as their lawyer and treasurer. Although Aerojet was a for-profit operation that provided technology for military means, the founders' mentality was rooted in the ideal of using rockets for peaceful space exploration. As Haley recounted von Kármán requesting: [...] "we will make the rockets—you must make the corporation and obtain the money. Later on you will have <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> all behave well in outer space." ...|$|E
500|$|Brunner {{has spoken}} out against {{election}} officials taking voting machines {{home with them}} in the days before an election. [...] Such actions could allow hacking even though it makes transport and delivery to the eventual polling place simpler. [...] Some elections officials say they feel the system is better if elections officials keep an eye on machines the days before the elections. [...] Brunner says poll workers have sometimes cast ballots on machines in their homes. [...] She issued the following directive on the matter: [...] "We want Ohio’s voters {{and the rest of the}} nation <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have prepared a transparent process of transporting voting equipment, ballots and supplies. That begins with security practices at boards of elections and polling places, documented chain of custody, and now procedures to make secure voting machine delivery." [...] She has ordered bipartisan transport teams and proscribed storage conditions such as humidity. The federal government will subsidize the cost of her mandate.|$|E

60|$|One day as I {{was sitting}} alone in the verandah, basking in the sun, and debating whether I should rejoin Grant's army, I was {{surprised}} to see this old creature hobbling towards me.

60|$|By {{this time}} it had become {{perfectly}} dark, and the guard lighted {{a fire in the}} middle of the room in which they sat.
