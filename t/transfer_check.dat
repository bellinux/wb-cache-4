50|$|PP Rappa (11): Bowzock's best mathemagician, {{he appears}} to play havoc with his staff to {{manipulate}} numbers like those in <b>transfer</b> <b>check</b> amounts {{and the price of}} items in stores. The Carrangers catch up to Rappa as he accidentally called Pink Racer heavy and escapes after she decked him in the nose. After being laughed at by his peers, Rappa vows vengeance as Grotch provides him a powerup backpack and the ability to use Number Bombs. Though he overpowers the four Carrangers on his own, an irate Yoko arrives, believing Rappa screwed up her scale with his magic and made her think she was fat, and revealing herself as Pink Racer as she gives him a beating of a lifetime. Eating Imo-youkan, Rappa battles RV Robo and is quickly killed off.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2013 The {{mechanisms}} of mortality during critical life stages of fish are not well-understood and, for many species, {{it is not}} clear if the mechanisms are similar for naturally and artificially propagated individuals. For Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), natural fish potentially face negative interactions, such as competition, and survival disadvantages, such as smaller size, that may limit survival when in association with hatchery fish. To better understand the {{mechanisms of}} mortality for hatchery and natural Chinook salmon during the critical early marine residence stage, I: (1) developed a model to discriminate between hatchery and natural juveniles using otolith structure; (2) directly compared migratory patterns of hatchery and natural juveniles; and (3) determined if there was evidence for selective mortality during early marine residence. I followed two cohorts through space and time by collecting juveniles from May-September in the Columbia River estuary and off the coast in September of 2010 and 2011. I compared attributes of those juveniles when they firstentered marine waters with those of survivors after their first summer at sea. I used a combination of genetic stock identification, otolith chemistry and structure, and physical tags to determine stock of origin, size at and timing of freshwater emigration, marine growth, and production type (hatchery or natural). I focused on the subyearling life history of a federally managed genetic stock group (upper Columbia River summer and fall Chinook salmon, UCR Su/F) because: 1) it is an abundant stock group; 2) subyearlings may be more vulnerable to size-selective mortality than yearlings; and 3) it is currently impossible to assess impacts of hatchery production due to low rates of marking the hatchery fish within this stock group. The classification model included two metrics, {{the presence or absence of}} a previously unreported <b>transfer</b> <b>check</b> associated with hatchery rearing and variability in otolith increment width, and predicted production type with a 92...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn a {{communication}} system, we consider two models of error control policies to transmit data more accurately: Model 1 {{is a double}} <b>transfer</b> <b>checking</b> policy which sends two data, and Model 2 is a loop checking policy which sends back data. For two models, the transmission fails with probability qj at its number j and stops at a maximum number N. The expected cost rates are derived and optimal numbers N∗ to minimize them are discussed. We compare two costs and show that a double <b>transfer</b> <b>checking</b> {{is better than a}} loop checking under some reasonable conditions...|$|R

5000|$|In Canada, {{the debit}} card is {{sometimes}} referred to as a [...] "bank card". It is a client card issued by a bank that provides access to funds and other bank account transactions, such as <b>transferring</b> funds, <b>checking</b> balances, paying bills, etc., as well as point of purchase transactions connected on the Interac network. Since its national launch in 1994, Interac Direct Payment has become so widespread that, as of 2001, more transactions in Canada were completed using debit cards than cash. This popularity may be partially attributable to two main factors: the convenience of not having to carry cash, and the availability of automated bank machines (ABMs) and Direct Payment merchants on the network.|$|R
