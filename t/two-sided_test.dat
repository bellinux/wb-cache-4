Low values of T are required for significance.

40|$|Abstract There is an {{inherent}} relationship between <b>two-sided</b> hypothesis <b>tests</b> and confi-dence intervals.

Unfortunately, for discrete data there are several different ways of defining <b>two-sided</b> exact <b>tests</b> and the most commonly used <b>two-sided</b> exact <b>tests</b> are defined one way, while the most commonly used exact confidence intervals are inversions of tests defined another way. This can lead to inconsistencies where the exact test rejects but the exact confidence interval contain...|$|R
50|$|Because any one {{observation}} is equally {{likely to be}} above or below the population median, the number of plus scores will have a binomial distribution with mean = 0.5. What is {{the probability of a}} result as extreme as 7 in 10 subjects being below the median? This is exactly the same as the probability of a result as extreme as 7 heads in 10 tosses of a fair coin. Because this is a <b>two-sided</b> <b>test,</b> an extreme result can be either three or fewer heads or seven or more heads.|$|E
50|$|The one-sided {{location}} test {{compares the}} location parameter of one sample {{to a given}} constant. An example of a one-sample location test would be {{a comparison of the}} location parameter for the blood pressure distribution of a population to a given reference value. In a one-sided test, it is stated before the analysis is carried out that it is only of interest if the location parameter is either larger than, or smaller than the given constant, whereas in a <b>two-sided</b> <b>test,</b> a difference in either direction is of interest.|$|E
50|$|The two-sided {{location}} test {{compares the}} location parameters of two samples to each other. A common situation {{is where the}} two populations correspond to research subjects who have been treated with two different treatments (one of them possibly being a control or placebo). In this case, {{the goal is to}} assess whether one of the treatments typically yields a better response than the other. In a one-sided test, it is stated before the analysis is carried out that it is only of interest if a particular treatment yields the better responses, whereas in a <b>two-sided</b> <b>test,</b> it is of interest whether either of the treatments is superior to the other.|$|E
30|$|All p-values {{were based}} on <b>two-sided</b> <b>testing</b> (p[*]<[*] 0.05) and {{statistical}} analysis was performed by using SAS statistical software (version 9.3, SAS Institute, Cary, NC). No formal sample size was planned, no multiplicity p value correction was implemented.|$|R
40|$|Whenever {{inference}} for variance components is required, {{the choice}} between one-sided and <b>two-sided</b> <b>tests</b> is crucial. This choice is usually driven by whether or not negative variance components are permitted. For <b>two-sided</b> <b>tests,</b> classical inferential procedures can be followed, based on likelihood ratios, score statistics, or Wald statistics. For one-sided tests, however, one-sided test statistics need to be developed, and their null distribution derived. While this has received considerable attention {{in the context of}} the likelihood ratio test, there appears to be much confusion about the related problem for the score test. The aim of this paper is to illustrate that classical (<b>two-sided)</b> score <b>test</b> statistics, frequently advocated in practice, cannot be used in this context, but that well-chosen one-sided counterparts could be used instead. The relation with likelihood ratio tests will be established, and all results are illustrated in an analysis of continuous longitudinal data using linear mixed models. status: publishe...|$|R
50|$|The C {{test can}} be {{generalized}} to include unbalanced designs, one-sided lower limit <b>tests</b> and <b>two-sided</b> <b>tests</b> at any significance level α, {{for any number of}} data series N, and for any number of individual data points nj in data series j.|$|R
50|$|The {{parametric}} test {{is accomplished by}} undertaking separate least squares analyses on two subsets of the original dataset: these subsets are specified so that the observations for which the pre-identified explanatory variable takes the lowest values are in one subset, with higher values in the other. The subsets needs not be of equal size, nor contain all the observations between them. The {{parametric test}} assumes that the errors have a normal distribution. There is an additional assumption here, that the design matrices for the two subsets of data are both of full rank. The test statistic used is {{the ratio of the}} mean square residual errors for the regressions on the two subsets. This test statistic corresponds to an F-test of equality of variances, and a one- or <b>two-sided</b> <b>test</b> may be appropriate depending on whether or not the direction of the supposed relation of the error variance to the explanatory variable is known.|$|E
50|$|The above test {{looks at}} whether the die rolls too many 6s. We could {{also use a}} two-tailed test which could tell us if the die is biased to produce either too few or too many 6s. Note that to do this we cannot simply double the one-tailed p-value unless the {{probability}} of the event is 1/2. This is because the binomial distribution becomes asymmetric as that probability deviates from 1/2. There are two methods to define the two tailed p-value. One method is to sum {{the probability that the}} total deviation in numbers of events in either direction from the expected value is either more than or less than the expected value. The probability of that occurring in our example is 0.0437. The second method involves computing the probability that the deviation from the expected value is as unlikely or more unlikely than the observed value, i.e. from a comparison of the probability density functions. This can create a subtle difference, but in this example yields the same probability of 0.0437. In both cases, the <b>two-sided</b> <b>test</b> reveals significance at the 5% level, indicating that the number of 6s observed was significantly different for this die than the expected number at the 5% level.|$|E

40|$|For a <b>two-sided</b> {{hypothesis}} <b>testing,</b> it {{is known}} that there does not exist UMP tests. Uniformly most powerful unbiased (UMPU) tests and likelihood ratio test are the common approaches to <b>two-sided</b> <b>testing.</b> The p-values of these tests are usually used as evidence against null hypothesis. However, there are criticisms of p-values as a measure of evidence against null hypothesis for the <b>two-sided</b> <b>testing</b> problem in lit-erature. Thus, in this paper, evidence measures derived from Bayesian approach are proposed to be the replacements of p-values and are in-vestigated from both decision and testing perspectives. From decision theoretic framework, the proposed evidence measures can be demon-strated as admissible estimators, however, p-value of UMPU test are not admissible estimators; from testing aspect, the tests derived from p-values and the proposed evidence measures are shown to be UMPU tests. The Bayes estimator is better than p-value from theoretical as-pect and it has the same merit as the p-value in testing point of view. Therefore, evidence measures derived from Bayesian approach are rec-ommended in this paper...|$|R

5000|$|Finally, we {{note that}} in general, UMP tests do not exist for vector {{parameters}} or for <b>two-sided</b> <b>tests</b> (a test in which one hypothesis lies {{on both sides of}} the alternative). The reason is that in these situations, the most powerful test of a given size for one possible value of the parameter (e.g. for [...] where [...] ) is different from the most powerful test of the same size for a different value of the parameter (e.g. for [...] where [...] ). As a result, no test is uniformly most powerful in these situations.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} <b>two-sided</b> <b>tests</b> for the parameter of an {{endogenous variable}} in an instrumental variable (IV) model with heteroskedastic and autocorrelated errors. We develop the finite-sample theory of weighted-average power (WAP) tests with normal errors and a known long-run variance. We introduce two weights which are invariant to orthogonal transformations of the instruments; e. g., changing {{the order in}} which the instruments appear. While tests using the MM 1 weight can be severely biased, optimal tests based on the MM 2 weight are naturally two-sided when errors are homoskedastic. We propose two boundary conditions that yield <b>two-sided</b> <b>tests</b> whether errors are homoskedastic or not. The locally unbiased (LU) condition is related to the power around the null hypothesis and is a weaker requirement than unbiasedness. The strongly unbiased (SU) condition is more restrictive than LU, but the associated WAP tests are easier to implement. Several tests are SU in finite samples or asymptotically, including tests robust to weak IV (such as the Anderson-Rubin, score, conditional quasi-likelihood ratio, and I. Andrews' (2015) PI-CLC <b>tests)</b> and <b>two-sided</b> <b>tests</b> which are optimal when the sample size is large and instruments are strong. We refer to the WAP-SU tests based on our weights as MM 1 -SU and MM 2 -SU tests. Dropping the restrictive assumptions of normality and known variance, the theory is shown to remain valid at the cost of asymptotic approximations. The MM 2 -SU test is optimal under the strong IV asymptotics, and outperforms other existing tests under the weak IV asymptotics...|$|R
