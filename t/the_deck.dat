5|$|Ballard's {{survey found}} no {{underwater}} penetrations of the ship's fully armoured citadel. Eight holes {{were found in}} the hull, one on the starboard side and seven on the port side, all above the waterline. One of the holes is in <b>the</b> <b>deck,</b> on the bow's starboard side. The angle and shape indicates the shell that created the hole was fired from Bismarcks port side and struck the starboard anchor chain. The anchor chain has disappeared down this hole. Six holes are amidships, three shell fragments pierced the upper splinter belt, and one made a hole in the main armour belt. Further aft a huge hole is visible, parallel to the aircraft catapult, on <b>the</b> <b>deck.</b> The submersibles recorded no sign of a shell penetration through the main or side armour here, and {{it is likely that the}} shell penetrated <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> armour only. Huge dents showed that many of the 14inch shells fired by King George V bounced off the German belt armour.|$|E
5|$|In 1957 a Filton-based RAF Vampire jet from 501 Squadron {{crashed into}} Leigh Woods. The pilot, Flying officer John Greenwood, was killed after he flew under <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> of the {{suspension}} bridge while performing a victory roll.|$|E
5|$|On several occasions, the M3 {{was mounted}} on PT boats to {{increase}} their firepower. One of these boats was John F. Kennedy's PT-109. The gun with its wheels removed was mounted on wooden planks nailed to <b>the</b> <b>deck.</b>|$|E
50|$|For {{a time in}} {{the later}} 1990s, the {{sections}} of <b>the</b> parking <b>deck</b> were also known by the adjacent road. <b>The</b> then-Green <b>Deck</b> was known as the Glenwood Deck; <b>the</b> Red <b>Deck,</b> <b>the</b> Blue Ridge Deck; and <b>the</b> Gold <b>Deck,</b> <b>the</b> Creedmoor <b>Deck.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{platform}} that closed {{the top of}} the hull was <b>the</b> main <b>deck,</b> and <b>the</b> name applied not only to the floor of this space, but also the space between <b>the</b> main <b>deck</b> and <b>the</b> cabin <b>deck,</b> just above <b>the</b> main <b>deck.</b> <b>The</b> main <b>deck</b> had <b>the</b> boilers and the two steam engines which powered the paddle wheel {{at the rear of the}} boat. Wood for the boilers was stacked on <b>the</b> main <b>deck.</b> Freight was carried on <b>the</b> main <b>deck.</b> <b>The</b> cheapest passenger accommodations were on <b>the</b> main <b>deck,</b> but <b>the</b> passengers had to find their own space.|$|R
5000|$|Decks [...] - Unlike wooden Bailey <b>decks,</b> <b>the</b> steel LSB <b>decks</b> are 1.05m x 3.05m and are {{manufactured}} using robotic welding technology. <b>The</b> <b>decks</b> {{are manufactured}} {{to have a}} long fatigue life and with durbar/checkered plate finish. <b>The</b> <b>decks</b> withstand both wheeled and tracked vehicles.|$|R
5|$|There is {{a bridge}} in Cáceres, Spain, {{projected}} by engineers Pedro Plasencia and Hadrián Arias whose pavement design {{is based on}} this game. The laser cannon, some shoots, and several figures {{can be seen on}} <b>the</b> <b>deck.</b>|$|E
5|$|A player (or a pair), {{who wins}} {{at least one}} trick {{receives}} an ability to gain more round points upon declaring the card combinations. In Tute in Pairs the declarations can be performed {{until the end of}} round; in Two-player Tute this ability persists until only two cards are left in <b>the</b> <b>deck.</b>|$|E
5|$|Aircraft could undergo maintenance, {{and most}} {{functional}} and equipment tests carried out aboard - {{either in the}} hangar or on <b>the</b> <b>deck.</b> Some components and could be repaired on board, but other work was {{to be carried out}} by the workshops on the engine repair and component repair ships that would accompany the maintenance carrier.|$|E
50|$|On a Mississippi riverboat, <b>the</b> {{promenade}} <b>deck</b> is <b>the</b> second <b>deck,</b> or floor, up {{from the}} waterline, above <b>the</b> main <b>deck,</b> and below <b>the</b> Texas <b>deck.</b>|$|R
50|$|These decks {{consist of}} 60 cards in total, 50 cards in <b>the</b> main <b>deck</b> and 10 cards in <b>the</b> gate <b>deck.</b> <b>The</b> main <b>deck</b> {{contains}} member, tactics, and paradox cards, and <b>the</b> gate <b>deck</b> must consist of exactly 10 gate cards. You may {{have up to}} four cards {{of the same name}} in <b>the</b> main <b>deck,</b> and up to two cards of the same Gate number in <b>the</b> gate <b>deck.</b>|$|R
50|$|The ship's {{passenger}} accommodation was spread across six <b>decks</b> within <b>the</b> ship, each <b>deck</b> {{identified with a}} corresponding letter in descending order from <b>the</b> top <b>deck</b> down to <b>the</b> waterline, they being <b>the</b> Boat <b>Deck</b> (A <b>Deck),</b> <b>the</b> Promenade <b>Deck</b> (B <b>Deck),</b> <b>the</b> Shelter <b>Deck</b> (C <b>Deck),</b> <b>the</b> Upper <b>Deck</b> (D <b>Deck),</b> <b>the</b> Main <b>Deck</b> (E <b>Deck)</b> and <b>the</b> Lower <b>Deck</b> (F Deck), {{with each of the}} three passenger classes being allotted their own space on the ship. As seen aboard all passenger liners of the era, first, second and third class passengers were strictly segregated from one another. According to her original configuration in 1907, she was designed to carry 2,198 passengers and 827 crew members. The Cunard Line prided itself with a record for passenger satisfaction.|$|R
5|$|Emeco founder Wilton C. Dinges {{developed}} the Emeco 1006 chair in 1944 {{in collaboration with}} the Aluminum Company of America (ALCOA). It was originally designed for the US Navy, which needed a chair for <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> of battleships that could survive sea air and a torpedo blast {{to the side of the}} ship. The chairs had eye bolts under the seat, so they could be attached to a ship-deck using cables.|$|E
5|$|Ford, {{serving as}} General Quarters Officer of <b>the</b> <b>Deck,</b> {{was ordered to}} go below to assess the raging fire. He did so safely, and {{reported}} his findings back to the ship's commanding officer, Captain Stuart Ingersoll. The ship's crew was able to contain the fire, and the ship got underway again.|$|E
5|$|Full-scale armour trials {{revealed}} serious {{weaknesses in}} the proposed protection scheme. The trials employed the obsolete ironclad , modified with armour protection identical to that used by the s then under construction. <b>The</b> <b>deck</b> and turret roof armour proved to be too thin, and the structure supporting the side armour was {{not strong enough to}} withstand the shock of impact from heavy shells.|$|E
50|$|Apocryphal tales {{suggest that}} stones {{from the old}} church were often taken {{to be used to}} clean <b>the</b> <b>decks</b> of sailing ships, giving rise to the {{practice}} known as ‘holy-stoning’ <b>the</b> <b>decks.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Holds {{in older}} ships were below <b>the</b> orlop <b>deck,</b> <b>the</b> {{lower part of}} the {{interior}} of a ship's hull, especially when considered as storage space, as for cargo. In later merchant vessels it extended up through <b>the</b> <b>decks</b> to <b>the</b> underside of <b>the</b> weather <b>deck.</b>|$|R
50|$|After welding, <b>the</b> <b>decking</b> is {{coated with}} either baked-on enamel or baked-on powder coating. This {{requires}} a cleaning process, heat drying, cooling, paint dip, and then final curing. <b>The</b> <b>decking</b> can instead be electroplated with zinc.|$|R
5|$|In 1957 a Filton-based RAF Vampire jet from 501 Squadron piloted by Flying officer John Greenwood flew under <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> while {{performing}} a victory roll before crashing in Leigh Woods, killing the pilot. The accident caused a landslip {{that led to}} the temporary closure of the nearby Bristol to Portishead railway line. A police helicopter flew under the bridge during a search in 1997.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, Roksan {{introduced}} the Artaxerxes phono stage – a moving coil phono pre-amplifier designed to sit inside the turntable. Roksan also marketed a three-legged table dedicated to <b>the</b> <b>deck.</b> In 1987 Roksan launched the Shiraz moving coil phono cartridge. In 1989, Roksan launched the budget Radius record player, Tabriz arm and Corus moving magnet cartridge.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, the {{overpass}} {{bridge over}} Pottery Road, {{north of the}} Bayview/Bloor interchange was rebuilt. It was over 30 years old and it required the replacement of columns and a restructuring of <b>the</b> <b>deck.</b> It was worn down due to {{the cumulative effect of}} heavy traffic and weather. The replacement necessitated the closure of several lanes of the parkway from April until the autumn that year.|$|E
50|$|Four of <b>the</b> <b>decks</b> were armoured. <b>The</b> {{forecastle}} <b>deck,</b> {{upper deck}} and maindeck {{were all of}} 1.5 in armour and <b>the</b> middle <b>deck</b> was of 1 in, increasing to 3 in over the machinery and magazines.|$|R
50|$|There were 17 staterooms on <b>the</b> saloon <b>deck.</b> <b>The</b> saloon <b>deck</b> {{also include}} a parlour, 18 ft wide and 44 ft long, a dining room 17 ft by 38 ft, and a smoking room 17 ft wide and 34 ft long. There were {{additional}} cabins on <b>the</b> Texas <b>deck.</b> <b>The</b> inside of <b>the</b> Texas <b>deck</b> included an open balcony or gallery running around and above the dining room on <b>the</b> saloon <b>deck.</b> <b>The</b> dining room ceiling was 17 ft high, and light {{came into the room}} through colored windows in the clerestory.|$|R
50|$|When {{cards are}} {{exchanged}} between <b>the</b> two <b>decks,</b> <b>the</b> player must show the sensei cards to all opponents for confirmation, but need not show the cards removed from <b>the</b> life <b>deck.</b> <b>The</b> cards removed {{must be taken}} {{from the top of}} <b>the</b> life <b>deck,</b> then <b>the</b> sensei cards must be shuffled into <b>the</b> life <b>deck.</b> If <b>the</b> player fails to remove the sensei cards from <b>the</b> life <b>deck</b> before <b>the</b> subsequent game begins, that game is forfeited to the opponent.|$|R
5|$|On 8 October 1892, a storm-damaged vessel, Sirene, hit the {{southern}} {{side of the}} pier, causing four shops and part of <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> to collapse onto the beach below. Several columns were also dislodged, and the ship's bowsprit hit the pier entrance. All eleven crew members were rescued when they were hauled onto the pier. Damage to the pier {{was estimated to be}} £5,000 and was promptly repaired.|$|E
5|$|The Route139 {{project will}} {{rehabilitate}} the eastbound side of Hoboken Avenue Viaduct and resurface the westbound roadway. There will be operational improvements at several intersections {{on the upper}} roadway, replacing all overpasses. It will replace <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> and rehabilitate the superstructure of the Conrail Viaduct. The total project cost is estimated at $180–200million {{and is expected to}} be completed by 2016.|$|E
5|$|The bridge's {{fourteen}} spans extended 1,907feet (580m) long. The {{three main}} spans were of deck truss construction while {{all but two}} of the eleven approach spans were steel multi-girder construction, the two exceptions being concrete slab construction. The piers were not built in the navigation channel; instead, the center span of the bridge consisted of a single 458-foot (140m) steel arched truss over the 390-foot (119m) channel. The two support piers for the main trusses, each with two load-bearing concrete pylons at either side of the center main span, were located on opposite banks of the river. The center span was connected to the north and south approaches by shorter spans formed by the same main trusses. Each was 266feet (81m) in length, and was connected to the approach spans by a 38foot (11.6m) cantilever. The two main trusses, one on either side, ranged in depth from 60feet (18.3m) above their pier and concrete pylon supports, to 36feet (11m) at midspan on the central span and 30feet (9m) deep at the outer ends of the adjoining spans. At the top of the main trusses were <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> trusses, 12feet (3.6m) in depth and integral with the main trusses. The transverse deck beams, part of <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> truss, rested on top of the main trusses. These deck beams supported longitudinal deck stringers 27inches (69cm) in depth, and reinforced-concrete pavement. <b>The</b> <b>deck</b> was 113ft 4in (34.5m) in breadth and was split longitudinally. It had transverse expansion joints at the centers and ends of each of the three main spans. The roadway deck was approximately 115feet (35m) above the water level.|$|E
50|$|Multiple planes {{could be}} {{launched}} from <b>the</b> flight <b>deck</b> in <b>the</b> {{time it took}} to move a single plane from <b>the</b> hangar <b>deck</b> to <b>the</b> flight <b>deck.</b> United States Navy doctrine, formulated in the mild climate of the eastern Pacific, considered <b>the</b> hangar <b>deck</b> a maintenance shop, and stored most embarked aircraft on <b>the</b> flight <b>deck</b> to minimize time required to position for launch. Royal Navy doctrine, formulated in the cold and stormy north Atlantic, stored most embarked aircraft on <b>the</b> hangar <b>deck</b> to minimize weather damage and maximize operational readiness when the time came to launch. In either case, when all aircraft were positioned on the aft portion of <b>the</b> flight <b>deck,</b> <b>the</b> aircraft carrier turned into the wind to maximize airspeed over <b>the</b> flight <b>deck</b> and began launching aircraft over the bow.|$|R
50|$|In <b>the</b> Rider-Waite <b>deck,</b> <b>the</b> sun card {{depicts a}} nude child on a horse, {{carrying}} a dull-red banner, whereas in <b>the</b> BOTA <b>deck,</b> <b>the</b> sun card depicts two nude children {{standing in a}} field, being based upon the sun card of <b>the</b> Marseille tarot <b>deck.</b>|$|R
50|$|The LST-491 class {{replaced}} the elevator {{installed in the}} original LST-1 class, to transfer equipment between <b>the</b> tank <b>deck</b> and <b>the</b> main <b>deck,</b> with a ramp that was hinged at <b>the</b> main <b>deck.</b> This allowed vehicles to be driven directly from <b>the</b> main <b>deck</b> onto <b>the</b> tank <b>deck</b> and then across the bow ramp to the beach or causeway, speeding the process of disembarkation.|$|R
5|$|The captain puts Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) {{in charge}} of a prop wheel, which Dwight thinks is real. Jim Halpert (John Krasinski), who has brought his girlfriend Katy Moore (Amy Adams) on the cruise with him, and Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) share an awkward moment alone on <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> away from their {{significant}} others. Michael continually tries to take charge of the event by standing next to the captain and interrupting everything he says. After Michael falsely declares that the ship is sinking, sending the passengers into a panic and causing one passenger to grab a life vest and jump off the ship, the captain temporarily detains him by zip tying him to the railing on <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> outside.|$|E
5|$|The crew on a bulker {{typically}} {{consists of}} 20 to 30people, though smaller ships {{can be handled}} by 8. The crew includes the captain or master, <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> department, the engineering department, and the steward's department. The practice of taking passengers aboard cargo ships, once almost universal, is very rare today and almost non-existent on bulkers.|$|E
5|$|The {{first half}} of the game is set on a whaler {{in the middle of a}} storm, and the {{conditions}} on <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> affect the degree of control the player has over Hansen. As the ship sways continuously from side to side, aiming is made more difficult, although Hansen can grab onto a ledge to steady himself, if one is available. In some instances, the ship can sway to such a degree that Hansen will slide towards the edge and potentially fall overboard. There are also numerous environmental hazards on <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> which react to the motion of the ship, such as swinging electrical wires and crates hooked up to ropes. If any of these items hit Hansen, he will lose health. Waves crashing on to the ship's deck can also cause Hansen damage.|$|E
50|$|A {{miniature}} golf course {{was added to}} <b>the</b> forward sun <b>deck.</b> <b>The</b> aft pool <b>deck</b> and <b>the</b> original waterslide {{was replaced by a}} waterpark with three slides. The main pool was completely refurbished with new materials and new spiral staircases to <b>the</b> top <b>deck.</b> <b>The</b> adults-only area around the funnel was relocated to the aft portion of <b>the</b> Promenade <b>deck.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'She is {{the best}} sailer in the service, and she carries a hundred guns. The {{heaviest}} be on <b>the</b> lower <b>deck,</b> <b>the</b> next size on <b>the</b> middle <b>deck,</b> <b>the</b> next on the main and upper decks. My son Ned's place is on <b>the</b> lower <b>deck,</b> because he's short, and they put the short men below.' ...|$|R
50|$|The {{card that}} {{contrasts}} the most between <b>the</b> two <b>decks</b> is <b>the</b> death card. In <b>the</b> Rider-Waite <b>deck,</b> <b>the</b> death card depicts {{death as a}}n armored knight on a horse, carrying a banner, whereas in <b>the</b> BOTA <b>deck,</b> <b>the</b> death card depicts death as a bare skeleton with a scythe, with a red sky in the background, being based upon the death card of <b>the</b> Marseille tarot <b>deck.</b>|$|R
