He {{also said the}} band was not yet recording new material but was putting together demos for a new album.|$|E
5|$|Taylor gave up {{appealing}} {{his sentence}} after his request for retrial {{was rejected by}} the Utah Supreme Court. He became the second person to be executed by firing squad in the United States (after Gary Gilmore) since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976. <b>Taylor</b> <b>said</b> he chose this method of execution to embarrass the state of Utah. On January 26, 1996, the day of Taylor's execution, legislation was introduced in the Utah House of Representatives to eliminate the firing squad.|$|E
5|$|On December 5, 1989, Judge Roth found Taylor {{guilty of}} the first-degree child rape and first-degree murder of Charla Nicole King. During the penalty phase of Taylor's trial, his {{half-sister}} Leslie Beale traveled from Florida to testify about his harsh treatment under his stepfather and the three years that Taylor spent in a sex offender program at a Florida mental institution. On December 19, Taylor became the first convict in 40 years {{to be sent to}} death row by a Weber County court. Roth said that {{the facts of the case}} outweighed any mitigating circumstances. Taylor's father Albert attended most of his son's court proceedings until he died of heart failure on October 8, 1990. <b>Taylor</b> <b>said</b> he was not permitted to attend his father's funeral.|$|E

2500|$|One of the 2005 {{participants}} in the Russian student exchange program told Associated Press {{that she had a}} summer work-study internship at the Bank of Ivanovo after she returned to Russia. <b>Taylor's</b> office <b>said</b> that was a mistake because Institute policy forbids participants to work in [...] "any business venture with which Congressman Taylor is associated." [...] The bank has since ended its participation in the work-study program, <b>Taylor's</b> office <b>said.</b>|$|R

25|$|Meanwhile, the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA) {{was formed}} by Taylor's former teammates, Lester and Frank Patrick. They {{encouraged}} Taylor to come west. In November 1912, {{it was announced that}} he would be paid $1,800 to join the Vancouver Millionaires. As he prepared to leave for the west coast, <b>Taylor</b> <b>said</b> he would not play in the NHA again under any circumstances. Before he left, <b>Taylor</b> <b>said</b> one of the two new Toronto teams in the NHA was owned by Lichtenhein, who was plotting to send Taylor to Toronto and prevent him from playing for Ottawa. The accusation was denied by the presidents of both Toronto teams and by Lichtenhein, who all said he had no ownership stake in either team.|$|E
25|$|Blackpool {{reached the}} sixth {{round of the}} 1958–59 FA Cup, going out to {{eventual}} finalists Luton Town, with former Blackpool man Allan Brown netting the only goal. Also, Ernie <b>Taylor</b> <b>said</b> farewell to the seaside by joining Manchester United {{in the wake of}} the Munich air disaster.|$|E
25|$|The Russia-based {{coordinator}} of the study program is Marina Bolshakova. She {{and her husband are}} partners in the Russian bank owned by Taylor, and Taylor's Russian investment company. <b>Taylor</b> <b>said</b> Bolshakova earns no salary for her work, calling her a natural choice for the job because of her prior job as an English teacher.|$|E

In mid-2006, Bolshakov said the bank's hard currency balance was more than $22 million and its loan portfolio was more than $18.6 million.|$|E
25|$|On 20 September 2013, Queen + Adam Lambert {{performed}} at the iHeartRadio Music Festival at the MGM Grand Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas. Queen + Adam Lambert toured North America in Summer 2014 and Australia and New Zealand in August/September 2014.

25|$|In December 1909, {{coming off}} a Stanley Cup winning season in Ottawa, it was {{reported}} that Taylor had a falling out with the club over his government job and his demand for more money. The Renfrew Hockey Club of the new National Hockey Association (NHA) announced that they had signed Taylor, but a week later <b>Taylor</b> <b>said</b> that he had decided to stay in Ottawa. After another week, Taylor changed his mind and said he would join Renfrew, signing for a reported $5,250 for one season (because of the high salaries the players got, the fans called them the Renfrew Millionaires). This made him the highest paid Canadian athlete, and he made more money than the Canadian prime minister.|$|E

25|$|<b>Taylor</b> has <b>said</b> one of {{her biggest}} {{developments}} in college was to build her strength up. Despite pulling down 7.3 rebounds per game, she counted rebounding as a weakness of hers and would continue to work hard on it to improve.|$|R
25|$|His {{form in the}} Premier League {{picked up}} remarkably as he {{remained}} unbeaten in his final 11 matches which included a 7–4 victory over Van Gerwen. Taylor {{finished third in the}} table {{for the second year in}} a row to qualify for the play-offs. Taylor led Raymond van Barneveld 3–0 in the semi-finals but could only hit 26% of his doubles during the match and, ultimately was defeated 8–5. This was the first time that the Dutchman had beaten him in the tournament in 21 attempts. Later, <b>Taylor</b> <b>said</b> that the six missed darts at double to move 5–2 ahead had played heavily on his mind and had made him nervous during the match- a feeling which he had never experienced before during his 26-year career.|$|E
25|$|On 29 August 1812 Marengo {{captured}} the British brigantine Concord (Captain Taylor) between Tenerife and Fuertaventura according to Lloyd's List Marine Collection. Concord {{was taken to}} New York to auction as a prize Captain <b>Taylor</b> <b>said</b> in court evidence that {{he was allowed to}} mess with Marengo's officers on this trans-Atlantic voyage providing further evidence that her crew acted in a gentlemanly way to her prisoners. On arrival in New York the neutral Spanish owners of part of Concords cargo of wine sued Florye Charretton and Ordronaux for the loss of their property and the 190 or so pages of court documents that have survived in the US archives provide much information about the effect of privateering on mercantile trade in this period.|$|E
25|$|In 1911, Taylor {{became the}} {{property}} of Sam Lichtenhein and the NHA Montreal Wanderers. Lichtenhein wanted Taylor as a drawing card in Montreal, but, in November 1911, <b>Taylor</b> <b>said</b> he would sooner retire from hockey than join the Wanderers. To the uproar of the Wanderers, he played for Ottawa against the Wanderers on January 24, 1912. Taylor's play was so poor, he was replaced after one period, with Montreal leading 2-0. Ottawa came back to win the game, 10-6. The Wanderers formally protested and the game was ordered replayed. Taylor and the Ottawa team were each fined $100 by the league and Taylor was given an indefinite suspension. However, despite this, {{at the end of}} the season in March, Taylor was selected for an NHA All-Star team which played against the three PCHA teams in British Columbia.|$|E

25|$|Before {{their meeting}} in {{the final of the}} 2013 World Championship, <b>Taylor</b> <b>said</b> that van Gerwen's talent was better than himself at his peak and it was {{suggested}} that a win for the Dutchman would be a changing of the guard for the sport. However, Taylor fought back from 4–2 down in sets to win 7–4. A few months later, van Gerwen became the first player other than Taylor to finish top of the table of the Premier League with the two {{meeting in the}} final which van Gerwen won 10–8. Afterwards Taylor stated that he would reinvent himself and make himself better as the pair would have many battles in the future and that his next target in his career would be to beat van Gerwen. Van Gerwen himself called Taylor the greatest and said that no one will match his achievements in darts.|$|E
25|$|The {{match between}} Swansea City and Aston Villa at the Liberty Stadium, held only hours after Speed's death was announced, was {{dedicated}} to his memory. A minute's silence was to be held before the match. However, the fans applauded instead and sang Speed's name. Several players who played in the match were severely affected by the news. Four Welsh internationals played in the match; Ashley Williams, Neil Taylor and Joe Allen, of Swansea, all played under Speed for Wales, and Allen in particular {{was said to be}} struggling with the news. James Collins was the other Welsh international, and he had also played with Speed at international level. Collins' Villa teammates Shay Given and Jermaine Jenas had both played with Speed at Newcastle United, and both were very badly affected by the news. Given openly wept during and after the minute's applause. Both managers, Alex McLeish and Brendan Rodgers, paid tribute to Speed. Rodgers, who had spoken to Speed a lot since he had become Wales manager, said that the game had lost a legend, while Neil <b>Taylor</b> <b>said</b> that he hoped Wales could qualify for the 2014 World Cup to honour him.|$|E
25|$|In the ODI {{series of}} New Zealand's tour to Zimbabwe, Taylor {{unleashed}} his best form to date. In the 1st ODI, he scored 128* rescuing Zimbabwe from a precarious position to a respectable 231. In the next match, he scored another century (107*) {{leading the charge}} from the front again and in the process, becoming the first ever Zimbabwean batsman to score back-to-back ODI tons. However, he did not receive any support from the other batsmen and despite his tons, Zimbabwe lost both the games. In the final ODI, chasing a sizable 329 to win, Taylor set {{the tone of the}} chase with a brisk 75 off 65 balls, which enabled Malcolm Waller and Elton Chigumbura to give Zimbabwe a famous win. With 310 runs in the series at an average of 310.00 and a strike rate of over 100, Taylor was adjudged the Man of the Series. His 310 runs is also a record number of runs in a three-match ODI series. He scored 50 and 117 in the one off test match. By the process, Taylor became only the second Zimbabwean batsman after Kevin Arnott to score a century in the fourth innings of a Test match, and contained 5 huge sixes. Despite his half-century and his second Test cricket ton, New Zealand outlasted him to win a thrilling match. Despite that, <b>Taylor</b> <b>said</b> that his team will continue to play aggressive, attacking test cricket which drew widespread praise from all quarters. In 2011, {{as a result of his}} fine performances, he was named the cricketer of the year and the batsman of the year.|$|E

5000|$|While {{the band}} has seen several members {{come and go}} (and come again), <b>Taylor</b> has <b>said</b> {{on more than one}} {{occasion}} that the band decided sometime after 1994's Forum that [...] "Undercover is Ojo, Gym, Sim, and Gary," [...] emphasizing that any other lineup, if any, would in the future be called something else.|$|R
500|$|<b>Taylor</b> <b>said</b> he {{had offered}} to sell the tapes to Epstein in the mid-1960s, but that Epstein did not {{consider}} them to be of commercial value and offered only £20. <b>Taylor</b> <b>said</b> he kept the tapes at home, largely forgotten until 1973 {{when he decided to}} look into their marketability. Williams related a different history than Taylor, stating that after Taylor returned to Liverpool, he left the tapes with a recording engineer for editing into a potential album. The project was never finished and the engineer later relocated, with the tapes being among many items left behind. In 1972, Williams, Taylor, and the engineer gained access to the abandoned office and recovered the tapes [...] "from beneath a pile of rubble on the floor." ...|$|E
500|$|... "That track {{came from}} {{fiddling}} with the new technology that was starting to come in", guitarist Andy <b>Taylor</b> <b>said</b> {{in an interview with}} Blender magazine.

500|$|Voice actress Jen <b>Taylor</b> <b>said</b> {{that she}} {{remained}} somewhat distanced from the character, and she attended only one fan convention {{in six years}} {{after the release of}} Halo: Combat Evolved. Despite her role in voicing other video game characters, including Princess Peach, she is not a gamer. She felt that portraying Cortana was occasionally challenging because the character lacks a physical form and is [...] "a computer". Interviewed about Cortana in Halo 3, <b>Taylor</b> <b>said</b> that [...] "There's a lot more drama and a lot less technical jargon this time around. I actually just finished a couple of lines that nearly had me in tears." [...] When choosing a voice actor for the character, Bungie originally wanted Cortana to have a British accent. Although this idea was later discarded, Cortana still uses British colloquialisms in Halo: Combat Evolved.|$|E

5000|$|Hamilton {{has said}} that in his Shakespeare studies his essays and ideas all begin with his {{observations}} of handwriting. He has drawn some interest, and also has his critics.

5000|$|<b>Taylor</b> has <b>said</b> of the incidents: [...] "The first penalty wasn't {{difficult}} to call. All I remember is {{thinking it was}} a 100% correct decision. As the ball went on the spot the whole stadium went quiet. Beckenbauer, the German skipper, {{came to me and}} said 'Taylor, you're an Englishman'. The kick went in and there was complete euphoria." ...|$|R
