5|$|After {{consultation}} with Canadian Pacific Railway officials, Lieutenant Governor Edgar Dewdney {{made the decision}} to move <b>the</b> <b>capital</b> <b>to</b> Regina, also in present-day Saskatchewan, in June 1882. The decision to move the capital was controversial with the public because Edgar Dewdney owned real estate in Regina. He was accused of having conflicted interests between his private affairs and the needs of the government.|$|E
5|$|After {{the conquest}} of Rajarata, he moved <b>the</b> <b>capital</b> <b>to</b> the Jaffna {{peninsula}} which was more secured by heavy Vanni forest and ruled as a tribute-paying subordinate of the Chola empire of Tanjavur, in modern Tamil Nadu, India. During this period (1247), a Malay chieftain from Tambralinga in modern Thailand named Chandrabhanu invaded the politically fragmented island. Although King Parakramabahu II (1236–70) from Dambadeniya was able to repulse the attack, Chandrabhanu moved north and secured the throne for himself around 1255 from Magha.|$|E
5|$|Around 1350BC, the {{stability}} of the New Kingdom seemed threatened further when Amenhotep IV ascended the throne and instituted a series of radical and chaotic reforms. Changing his name to Akhenaten, he touted the previously obscure sun deity Aten as the supreme deity, suppressed the worship of most other deities, and attacked the power of the temple that had become dominated by the priests of Amun in Thebes, whom he saw as corrupt. Moving <b>the</b> <b>capital</b> <b>to</b> the new city of Akhetaten (modern-day Amarna), Akhenaten turned a deaf ear to events in the Near East (where the Hittites, Mitanni, and Assyrians were vying for control). He was devoted to his new religion and artistic style. After his death, the cult of the Aten was quickly abandoned, the priests of Amun soon regained power and returned <b>the</b> <b>capital</b> <b>to</b> Thebes. Under their influence the subsequent pharaohs Tutankhamun, Ay, Horemheb, and possibly even Neferneferuaten/Nefertiti herself worked to erase all mention of Akhenaten's heresy, now known as the Amarna Period.|$|E

5|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20th century, Dartmouth College {{president}} William Jewett Tucker decided to explore the possibility of establishing a school of business to educate the growing number of Dartmouth alumni entering the commercial world. Turning to his former roommate from his undergraduate years at Dartmouth, Tucker enlisted the support of Edward Tuck, who had since become a wealthy banker and philanthropist. Tuck donated $300,000 in the form of preferred stock shares in a Minnesota railroad company as <b>the</b> <b>capital</b> <b>to</b> found the school. It was named the Amos Tuck School of Administration and Finance, after Edward Tuck's father and Dartmouth alumnus Amos Tuck.|$|E
5|$|Diplomatic {{relations}} between Cuba and the United States continued {{for some time}} after Batista's fall, but President Eisenhower deliberately left <b>the</b> <b>capital</b> <b>to</b> avoid meeting Cuba's young revolutionary leader Fidel Castro during the latter's trip to Washington in April, leaving Vice President Richard Nixon to conduct the meeting in his place. Cuba began negotiating arms purchases from the Eastern Bloc in March 1960.|$|E

The festivities are interrupted by the arrival of Tyrion Lannister, who has been sent to <b>the</b> <b>capital</b> <b>to</b> act as Hand of the King in his father's stead. Cersei is furious, but accepts the new situation after her brother assures her that he will only act as an advisor. When Tyrion learns that Cersei has let Arya Stark escape after the execution of her father, he mocks her for throwing away two valuable hostages, as he'd planned to trade the girls for Jaime.|$|E
5|$|Events of {{the later}} years of the reign showed that Constantinople itself was not safe from barbarian incursions from the north, and even the {{relatively}} benevolent historian Menander Protector {{felt the need to}} attribute the Emperor's failure to protect <b>the</b> <b>capital</b> <b>to</b> the weakness of his body in his old age. In his efforts to renew the Roman Empire, Justinian dangerously stretched its resources while failing {{to take into account the}} changed realities of 6th-century Europe.|$|E
5|$|Gangtok rose to {{prominence}} {{as a popular}} Buddhist pilgrimage site after {{the construction of the}} Enchey Monastery in 1840. In 1894, the ruling Sikkimese Chogyal, Thutob Namgyal, transferred <b>the</b> <b>capital</b> <b>to</b> Gangtok. In the early 20th century, Gangtok became a major stopover on the trade route between Lhasa in Tibet and cities such as Kolkata (then Calcutta) in British India. After India won its independence from Britain in 1947, Sikkim chose to remain an independent monarchy, with Gangtok as its capital. In 1975, after the integration with the union of India, Gangtok was made India's 22nd state capital.|$|E

5|$|Jahanpanah was {{the fourth}} medieval city of Delhi {{established}} in 13261327 by Muhammad bin Tughlaq (1321–51), of the Delhi Sultanate. To address the constant threat of the Mongols, Tughlaq built the fortified city of Jahanpanah (meaning in Persian: “Refuge of the World”) subsuming the Adilabad fort that had {{been built in the}} 14th century and also all the establishments lying between Qila Rai Pithora and Siri Fort. Neither the city nor the fort has survived. Many reasons have been offered for such a situation. One of which is stated as the idiosyncratic rule of Mohammed bin Tughlaq when inexplicably he shifted <b>the</b> <b>capital</b> <b>to</b> Daulatabad in the Deccan and came back to Delhi soon after.|$|E
5|$|Later {{many other}} Sicilian {{towns and cities}} which had been either little damaged or {{completely}} untouched by the quake, such as Palermo, were also transformed by the Baroque style, as the fashion spread and aristocrats with a palazzo in Catania came to wish their palazzo in <b>the</b> <b>capital</b> <b>to</b> be as opulent as that in the second city.

5|$|The District Railway (DR) was a sub-surface {{underground}} railway {{which had}} opened in 1868. Its steam-hauled services operated around the Inner Circle and on branches to Hounslow, Wimbledon, Richmond, Ealing, Whitechapel and New Cross. By 1901, the DR {{was struggling to}} compete with emerging motor bus and electric tram companies and the CLR which were eroding its passenger traffic. To become more competitive, the DR was contemplating a programme of electrification, {{although it was not}} financially strong enough to raise <b>the</b> <b>capital</b> <b>to</b> carry out the work on its own. It also had parliamentary approval for a congestion-relieving deep-level line that was to run beneath its existing route between Gloucester Road and Mansion House.|$|E
5|$|The Kentish {{advance on}} London {{appears to have}} been coordinated with the {{movement}} of the rebels in Essex, Suffolk and Norfolk.

5|$|The {{capital of}} the {{territory}} remained in Vincennes for thirteen years. After the territory was reorganized in 1809 and the Illinois Territory was split off, Vincennes was then on the far west edge of the Indiana Territory. Due to this, the legislature made plans to move <b>the</b> <b>capital</b> <b>to</b> be more centralized with the population. Madison, Jeffersonville, and Corydon competed to become the new capital. Harrison favored Corydon, a town he had founded and named, and where he owned an estate. The new capitol building was finished in 1813 and the government quickly relocated to Corydon after {{the outbreak of the}} War of 1812 for fear of an attack on Vincennes.|$|E

5|$|The {{rest of the}} National Constituent Assembly {{followed}} the king within two weeks to new quarters in Paris.

The October journées thus effectively deprived the monarchist faction of significant representation in the Assembly as most of these deputies retreated from the political scene; many, like Mounier, fled the country altogether.|$|E
