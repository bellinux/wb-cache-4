5|$|During his Spitsbergen {{visits with}} Prince Albert in 1898 and 1899, Bruce had {{detected}} {{the presence of}} coal, gypsum and possibly oil. In the summers of 1906 and 1907 he again accompanied the Prince to the archipelago, with <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> <b>purpose</b> of surveying and mapping Prince Charles Foreland, an island unvisited during the earlier voyages.

5|$|Education of {{the young}} was never {{considered}} to be the primary domain of schools, even after they had become more common. Most education was carried out by a child's parents or foster parents. Formal apprenticeships were not the norm in Plymouth; it was expected that a foster family would teach the children whatever trades they themselves practiced. The church also {{played a central role in}} a child's education. As noted above, <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> <b>purpose</b> of teaching children to read was so that they could read the Bible for themselves.|$|E

(PDF) Retrieved November 25, 2011. but the most {{aggressive}} government attack against Du Bois occurred in the early 1950s, {{as a consequence of}} Du Bois's opposition to nuclear weapons. In 1950 Du Bois became chairman of the newly created Peace Information Center (PIC), which worked to publicize the Stockholm Peace Appeal in the United States. <b>The</b> <b>primary</b> <b>purpose</b> of the appeal was to gather signatures on a petition, asking governments around the world to ban all nuclear weapons.|$|E
5|$|The Lemon {{test has}} been criticized by justices and legal scholars, but it remains the {{predominant}} {{means by which the}} Court enforces the Establishment Clause. In Agostini v. Felton (1997), the entanglement prong of the Lemon test was demoted to simply being a factor in determining the effect of the challenged statute or practice. In Zelman v. Simmons-Harris (2002), the opinion of the Court considered secular purpose and the absence of primary effect; a concurring opinion saw both cases as having treated entanglement as part of <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> <b>purpose</b> test. Further tests, such as the endorsement test and coercion test, have been developed to determine whether a government action violated the Establishment Clause.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>primary</b> <b>purpose</b> of Weston's new colony was profit, {{rather than}} the {{religious}} reasons of the Plymouth settlers, and this dictated how the colony would be assembled. Weston believed that families were a detriment to a well-run plantation and so he selected able-bodied men only but not men experienced in colonial life. In total, there were several advanced scouts and fifty to sixty other colonists. The final complement also included one surgeon and one lawyer. The party was outfitted with enough supplies to last the winter.|$|E

Although the watershed is small in comparison to that of the Sacramento River, the stream is among the most polluted and acidic in the world.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>primary</b> <b>purpose</b> of {{the stop}} {{lines and the}} {{anti-tank}} islands that followed was {{to hold up the}} enemy, slowing progress and restricting the route of an attack. The need to prevent tanks from breaking through was of key importance. Consequently, the defences generally ran along pre-existing barriers to tanks such as rivers and canals; railway embankments and cuttings; thick woods; and other natural obstacles. Where possible, usually well-drained land was allowed to flood, making the ground too soft to support even tracked vehicles.|$|E

5|$|Arnold, whose {{business}} activities {{before the war}} had included sailing ships to Europe and the West Indies, carefully chose the site {{where he wanted to}} meet the British fleet. Reliable intelligence he received on October 1 indicated that the British had a force significantly more powerful than his. Because his force was inferior, he chose the narrow, rocky body of water between the western shore of Lake Champlain and Valcour Island (near modern Plattsburgh, New York), where the British fleet would have difficulty bringing its superior firepower to bear, and where the inferior seamanship of his relatively unskilled sailors would have a minimal negative effect. Some of Arnold's captains wanted to fight in open waters where {{they might be able to}} retreat to the shelter of Fort Crown Point, but Arnold argued that <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> <b>purpose</b> of the fleet was not survival but the delay of a British advance on Crown Point and Ticonderoga until the following spring.|$|E
5|$|Hope is a Symbolist oil {{painting}} by the English painter George Frederic Watts, {{who completed the}} first two versions in 1886. Radically different from previous treatments of the subject, it shows a lone blindfolded female figure sitting on a globe, playing a lyre that has only a single string remaining. The background is almost blank, its only visible feature a single star. Watts intentionally used symbolism not traditionally associated with hope to make the painting's meaning ambiguous. While his use of colour in Hope was greatly admired, {{at the time of}} its exhibition many critics disliked the painting. Hope proved popular with the Aesthetic Movement, who considered beauty <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> <b>purpose</b> of art and were unconcerned by the ambiguity of its message. Reproductions in platinotype, and later cheap carbon prints, soon began to be sold.|$|E
5|$|There are 20 castles in {{the county}} of Cheshire in North West England. Cheshire {{is one of the}} {{historic}} counties of England and its historic boundaries are different from the modern county lines. Some castles that were formerly in Cheshire are now in Greater Manchester. In addition, Warrington Castle is historically a part of Lancashire but is within the current boundaries of Cheshire. Before the Norman conquest of England began in 1066, defensive sites in England were communal, such as Anglo-Saxon burhs built as a defence against the Danes. Castles were popularised in England by the Normans– although a few sites in the south-east pre-dating the Norman conquest– and were owned by the feudal lords. <b>The</b> <b>primary</b> <b>purpose</b> of a castle was military: {{to be used as a}} base of operations and to control the surrounding areas. A castle was considered to be a stamp of authority over the population of an area, and a status symbol. Some would have acted as centres of trade and administration for a manor.|$|E

5|$|The 1994 Imola layout, {{which had}} been in place since 1981, was never again used for a Formula One race. The circuit was heavily {{modified}} following the race, including a change at Tamburello—also the scene of major accidents for Gerhard Berger (1989) and Nelson Piquet (1987)—from a high speed corner to a much slower chicane. The FIA also changed the regulations governing Formula One car design, {{to the extent that}} the 1995 regulations required all teams to create completely new designs, as their 1994 cars could not be adapted to them. The concern raised at the drivers briefing the morning of the race, by Senna and Berger, would lead to the Grand Prix Drivers' Association reforming at the following race, the 1994 Monaco Grand Prix. The GPDA, which was founded in 1961, had previously disbanded in 1982. <b>The</b> <b>primary</b> <b>purpose</b> of it reforming was to allow drivers to discuss safety issues with a view to improve standards following the incidents at Imola. The front two grid slots at the Monaco Grand Prix that year, which were painted with Brazilian and Austrian flags, were left clear in memory of the two drivers who had lost their lives, while both Williams and Simtek entered only one car each. Additionally, a minute of silence was observed before the race.|$|E
5|$|Trinity River Division is {{the second}} large CVP {{department}} for the northern Sacramento Valley. <b>The</b> <b>primary</b> <b>purpose</b> of the division is to divert water from the Trinity River into the Sacramento River drainage downstream of Shasta Dam {{in order to provide}} more flow in the Sacramento River and generating peaking power in the process. Trinity Dam forms Trinity Lake, the second largest CVP water-storage reservoir, with just over half the capacity of Shasta and a generating capacity of 140 MW. Lewiston Dam, downstream of Trinity Dam, diverts water into the Clear Creek Tunnel, which travels to empty into a third reservoir, Whiskeytown Lake on Clear Creek, a tributary of the Sacramento River, generating 154 MW of power in the process. Whiskeytown Lake (formed by Clair. A Hill Whiskeytown Dam) in turn provides water to the Spring Creek Tunnel, which travels into the lowermost extreme of Spring Creek, a stream that flows into Keswick Reservoir, generating another 180 MW of electricity. From there the water from the Trinity River empties into Keswick Reservoir and the Sacramento River. In 1963, the Spring Creek Debris Dam was constructed just upstream of the outlet of the Spring Creek Tunnel, to prevent acid mine drainage from the Iron Mountain Mine from continuing downstream and contaminating the river.|$|E
