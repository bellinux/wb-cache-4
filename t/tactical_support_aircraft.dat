5|$|Even {{though the}} {{situation}} was stabilized, the South Vietnamese were forced to retreat into small compounds at {{the north and south}} ends of the town. The intensity of the attack on Lộc Ninh revealed the true intentions of the Communists; ARVN Lieutenant General Nguyễn Văn Minh, commander of the III Corps Tactical Zone, and his American advisor Major General James F. Hollingsworth realized that Bình Long, not Tây Ninh, would be the focus of the Communist offensive. In order to halt the Communist advance, Minh and Hollingsworth directed all available <b>tactical</b> <b>support</b> <b>aircraft</b> towards Lộc Ninh. Almost immediately, Republic of Vietnam Air Force F-5 and A-1 fighter-bombers, United States Air Force (USAF) A-37s from the 8th Special Operations Squadron based at Biên Hòa, attack aircraft from the aircraft carrier , and USAF F-4 and AC-130 aircraft from Thailand began flying over the skies of Lộc Ninh. U.S. and South Vietnamese <b>tactical</b> <b>support</b> <b>aircraft</b> were directed against Viet Cong and North Vietnamese formations by American advisers on the ground. As the fighting intensified, Colonel Nguyễn Công Vinh ordered the 1st Cavalry Squadron — commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Nguyen Huu Duong — to withdraw from Fire Support Base Alpha to reinforce Lộc Ninh. However, Duong refused, saying he would surrender his unit to the Viet Cong instead. Angered, Captain Mark A. Smith reportedly threatened to destroy the 1st Cavalry Squadron with American air power if the squadron didn't fight.|$|E
25|$|In December 1953, NATO Supreme Command, {{realizing that}} a few, {{expensive}} and complex fighters located on few airbases were very vulnerable {{in case of}} a nuclear war, issued a specification for a new light <b>tactical</b> <b>support</b> <b>aircraft.</b> Aircraft manufacturers within NATO countries were invited to submit their designs for a Light Weight Strike Fighter. The competition was intended to produce a combat aircraft that was light, small and equipped with basic weapons and avionics. It should also be able to operate from dispersed airfields and require minimal ground support.|$|E
50|$|The Dornier Do 31 was a West German {{experimental}} VTOL jet transport {{built by}} Dornier. The Do 31 {{was designed to}} meet a NATO specification (NBMR-4) for a <b>tactical</b> <b>support</b> <b>aircraft</b> for the EWR VJ 101 VTOL strike aircraft designed under the NATO contract of BMR-3. The project was cancelled in 1970 owing to high costs, technical problems and a change of requirement.|$|E

50|$|The Aerfer Sagittario 2 (Italian for Archer) was a {{prototype}} all-metal single-seat lightweight fighter aircraft built in Italy by Aerfer, intended {{to serve as}} an interceptor or light <b>tactical</b> <b>support</b> <b>aircraft.</b> First flown in 1956, it became the first Italian aircraft to break the sound barrier in controlled flight when it reached Mach 1.1 during a dive from 13,725 m (45,000 ft).|$|E
50|$|The air corps was {{targeted}} to have by independence in 1946 approximately 100 bombers and additional <b>tactical</b> <b>support</b> <b>aircraft</b> {{to be used}} with the Off Shore Patrol of torpedo boats in coastal defense. When war came the corps had around 40 aircraft and 100 pilots, 500 personnel, and six squadrons. In August 1941, the PAAC was inducted into the United States Army and incorporated into the Far East Air Force.|$|E

50|$|The {{headquarters}} {{was then}} relocated in November 1959 to Ramstein AB, West Germany. At Ramstein, Seventeenth Air Force exchanged its support {{mission in the}} southern region for the defensive and offensive air mission in central Europe. The command's inventory included more than 500 <b>tactical</b> and 150 <b>support</b> <b>aircraft</b> operating from bases in West Germany, France, the Netherlands and Italy. After the 1961 Berlin Crisis and a USAFE headquarters reorganization, 17 AF assumed responsibility for five bases in Great Britain from Third Air Force.|$|R

Currently implementing a helicopter program to be utilized for border crime and search and rescue operations, thereby reducing response time and providing for increased safety for law enforcement and the citizens of Pima County.|$|R
50|$|In 1978, the F-100s {{were being}} retired, {{and they were}} {{replaced}} with A-7D Corsair II subsonic <b>tactical</b> close air <b>support</b> <b>aircraft</b> from the 23d Tactical Fighter Wing, England AFB, Louisiana along with the 354th Tactical Fighter Wing, Myrtle Beach AFB, South Carolina which were converting to the A-10 Thunderbolt II. The aircraft had excellent accuracy {{with the aid of}} an automatic electronic navigation and weapons delivery system. Although designed primarily as a ground attack aircraft, it also had limited air-to-air combat capability. In 1980, the 125th received the new twin-seat A-7K trainer and also received the Low Altitude Night Attack modification to the A-7D.|$|R

5000|$|As {{a result}} of {{experiences}} from the Korean War alongside newly developed concepts of aerial cooperation, the members of NATO recognised a need to reequip their inventories with a suitable jet-powered ground attack aircraft. In December 1953, NATO Supreme Command issued specifications for a new light <b>tactical</b> <b>support</b> <b>aircraft.</b> [...] European manufacturers were invited to submit their designs for this requested Light Weight Strike Fighter role. The G.91 was designed to this specification by the Italian engineer Giuseppe Gabrielli, hence the [...] "G" [...] designation. The competition was intended to produce an aircraft that was light, small, expendable, equipped with basic weapons and avionics and capable of operating with minimal ground support. These specifications were developed for two reasons: {{the first was the}} nuclear threat to large air bases, many cheaper aircraft could be better dispersed, and the other was to counter the trend towards larger and more expensive aircraft.|$|E
25|$|During the Vietnam War, doubts {{began to}} be raised {{regarding}} the Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker fleet's ability {{to meet the needs}} of the United States' global commitments. The aerial refueling fleet was deployed to Southeast Asia to <b>support</b> <b>tactical</b> <b>aircraft</b> and strategic bombers, while maintaining the U.S.-based support of the nuclear-bomber fleet. Consequently, the Air Force sought an aerial tanker with greater capabilities than the KC-135. In 1972, two DC-10s were flown in trials at Edwards Air Force Base, simulating air refuelings to check for possible wake issues. Boeing performed similar tests with a 747.|$|R
50|$|While {{returning}} to base, Kettles was advised that eight troops {{had been unable}} to reach the evacuation helicopters due to the intense enemy fire. With complete disregard for his own safety, Kettles passed the lead to another helicopter and returned to the landing zone to rescue the remaining troops. Without gunship, artillery, or <b>tactical</b> <b>aircraft</b> <b>support,</b> the enemy concentrated all firepower on his lone aircraft, which was immediately hit by a mortar round that damaged the tail boom and a main rotor blade and shattered both front windshields and the chin bubble. His aircraft was further raked by small arms and machine gun fire.|$|R
50|$|In {{the summer}} of 1979, the F-100s were retired, being {{replaced}} with A-7D Corsair II subsonic <b>tactical</b> close air <b>support</b> <b>aircraft</b> from <b>Tactical</b> Air Command units that were converting to the new A-10 Thunderbolt II. The aircraft had excellent accuracy {{with the aid of}} an automatic electronic navigation and weapons delivery system. Although designed primarily as a ground attack aircraft, it also had limited air-to-air combat capability. It continued its NATO commitment, deploying six A-7D aircraft to RAF Sculthorpe, England in April 1983 for Operation Cornet Miami; eight A-7Ds in June-July 1986 for Cornet Pine, and thirteen A-7Ds in May-June 1989 for Cornet Pine. The 180th Tactical Fighter Group received the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award in 1985 and again in 1990. In 1989, while deployed at Panama for a Coronet Cove deployment, 180th A-7s were employed during Operation Just Cause.|$|R
50|$|The 931st {{performed}} routine reserve airlift operations until July 1969 {{when the}} Flying Boxcars were retired, and the unit was redesignated as a <b>Tactical</b> Air <b>Support</b> unit.

25|$|The {{objective}} of Operation Maeng Da was the vital communist transshipment point at Tchepone. Mobile 1 {{was not alone}} on this multi-battalion mission, the first in MR 3 to be launched under a single field commander. It was inserted by helicopter at a rendezvous point near Vang Tai on 2 July 1970. Black Battalion joined it from the west; Blue Battalion came from the north. The three battalions came together at Vang Tai on 8 July. From there they moved southeast, reaching Route 23 on 10 July, finding little communist activity. They expected White Battalion to land 10 kilometers distant from them as the initial reinforcements for the march on Tchepone. Instead, they spent 11–15 July heavily engaged with People's Army of Vietnam 9th Regiment regulars, with Black Battalion taking severe casualties. On 16 July, the three Royalist irregular battalions withdrew to a helicopter landing zone slated for White Battalion's arrival. However, the fighting was too heavy to land the reinforcing White Battalion. The hurly-burly of <b>tactical</b> <b>aircraft</b> <b>supporting</b> the landed troops made the air space surrounding the HLZ exceedingly hazardous. The CIA agent controlling the insertion aborted it.|$|R
