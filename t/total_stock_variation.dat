40|$|Understanding soil {{phosphorus}} (P) changes under continuous cropping {{over decades}} {{is an important}} agronomic and environmental issue. The objective {{of this study was}} to examine changes in <b>total</b> P <b>stock</b> of the plough soil layer of a cultivated ecosystem in relation to P balance. The long-term field experiment Qualiagro (INRA – Veolia Environnement) was established at Feucherolles, France, in 1998. Five treatments were designed and replicated in four blocks. Farmyard manure (FYM) and three types of composts (Municipal Solid Waste (MSW), Biowastes (BIOW) and Green Waste + Sewage Sludges (GWS)) were applied every two years at a rate of 4 t C ha- 1. A control received no organic amendment. Changes of <b>total</b> P <b>stock</b> in the plough layer (0 - 28 cm) were compared to cumulated soil P balance since 1998, calculated as the difference between cumulated P input, as supplied through organic amendment and at seedling, and cumulated P output, by harvest of grains and crop residues if removed. Total soil P content and bulk soil density were determined at five soil sampling dates, crop yield and P content were measured annually. Cumulated P input for the 1998 - 2013 period ranged from 340 to 1695 kg P ha- 1 for MSW and GWS respectively. Cumulated P export by crops was influenced by treatments. Soil bulk density increased less in amended soils than in control. A linear relationship between <b>total</b> soil P <b>stock</b> <b>variation</b> and soil P balance was found, close to the 1 : 1 line. These results confirm that P outputs through erosion, runoff and leaching were negligible. Contribution of subsoil to crop nutrition was estimated to be close to 0. 5 - 1 kg P ha- 1...|$|R

30|$|Anchovy (Engraulis sp.) and sardine (Sardinops sp.) are {{important}} harvested species in four {{regions of the}} world: California Current system (CCS), Humboldt Current System, Benguela Current System, and the Kuroshio-Oyashio Current System. Those stocks exhibit a low frequency (decadal) variability and, except for the Humboldt system, out-of-phase-like synchrony (to various degrees) of <b>stock</b> <b>variation</b> between anchovy and sardine (Lluch-Belda et al. 1989; Lluch-Belda et al. 1992; Schwartzlose et al. 1999).

Our approach here is to use a coupled modeling system and apply the model to sardine and anchovy in the CCS to elucidate the various processes that connect climate forcing to sardine and anchovy <b>stock</b> <b>variation.</b>|$|R

40|$|Many {{areas in}} sub-Saharan African are data-poor and poorly accessible. The {{estimation}} of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks {{in these areas}} will {{have to rely on}} the limited available secondary data coupled with restricted field sampling. We assessed the <b>total</b> SOC <b>stock,</b> its spatial <b>variation</b> and the causes of this variation in Limpopo National Park (LNP), a data-poor and poorly accessible area in southwestern Mozambique. During a field survey, A-horizon thickness was measured and soil samples were taken for the determination of SOC concentrations. SOC concentrations were multiplied by soil bulk density and A-horizon thickness to estimate SOC stocks. Spatial distribution was assessed through: i) a measure-and-multiply approach to assess average SOC stocks by landscape unit, and ii) a soil-landscape model that used soil forming factors to interpolate SOC stocks from observations to a grid covering the area by ordinary (OK) and universal (UK) kriging. Predictions were validated by both independent and leave-one-out cross validations. The <b>total</b> SOC <b>stock</b> of the LNPwas obtained by i) calculating an area-weighted average from the means of the landscape units and by ii) summing the cells of the interpolated grid. Uncertainty was evaluated by the mean standard error for the measure-and-multiply approach and by the mean kriging prediction standard deviation for the soil-landscape model approach. The reliability of the estimates of total stockswas assessed by the uncertainty of the input data and its effect on estimates. The mean SOC stock from all sample points is 1. 59 kg m- 2; landscape unit averages are 1. 13 – 2. 46 kg m- 2. Covariables explained 45 % (soil) and 17 % (coordinates) of SOC <b>stock</b> <b>variation.</b> Predictions from spatial models averaged 1. 65 kg m- 2 and are within the ranges reported for similar soils in southern Africa. The validation root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) was about 30 % of the mean predictions for both OK and UK. Uncertainty is high (coefficient of variation of about 40 %) due to short-range spatial structure combined with sparse sampling. The range of <b>total</b> SOC <b>stock</b> of the 10, 410 km- 2 study area was estimated at 15, 579 – 17, 908 Gg. However, 90 % confidence limits of the <b>total</b> <b>stocks</b> estimated are narrower (5 – 15 %) for the measure-and-multiply model and wider (66 – 70 %) for the soil-landscape model.

30|$|As a {{consequence}} of this, and because Nfg and Np values are derived directly from the CVD data, any lack of compliance with stock tank oil material balance conservation is automatically (yet unintendedly) absorbed by Nfo. At high pressures, the differences in actual and calculated <b>total</b> <b>stock</b> tank oil are relatively small compared to Nfo; thus, the error is small and can be neglected. However, lower pressures exhibit greater differences in <b>total</b> <b>stock</b> tank oil and, therefore, the error can become significant. The imposition that <b>total</b> <b>stock</b> tank oil (Nfg + Nfo + Np) should remain the same during depletion (while actually decreasing with pressure depletion due to BO PVT shortcomings) invariably leads to a consistent overestimation of Nfo. This, in turn, leads to a consistent underestimation of Bo—as per its definition shown in Fig.  1 and as illustrated in Table  1.|$|R

The study is conducted on the Stockholm stock market where there is a clear lack of information regarding the dividend-yield and <b>total</b> <b>stock</b> return relationship.

The purpose is to answer the following research question; “What is the relationship between dividend-yield and <b>total</b> <b>stock</b> return for stocks on the OMX Stockholm Benchmark Index during different trends of the Stockholm stock market during 1999 - 2011 ?” In the processes of answering our research question, we have been conducting statistical tests where the linear regression at the heart.
