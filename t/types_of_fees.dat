40|$|In this paper, we analyse {{competing}} double auction marketplaces that vie for {{traders and}} need to set appropriate fees to make a profit. Specifically, we show how competing marketplaces should set their fees by analysing the equilibrium behaviour of two competing marketplaces. In doing so, we focus on {{two different types of}} market fees: registration fees charged to traders when they enter the marketplace, and profit fees charged to traders when they make transactions. In more detail, given the market fees, we first derive equations to calculate the marketplaces' expected profits. Then we analyse the equilibrium charging behaviour of marketplaces in two different cases: where competing marketplaces can only charge the same type of fees and where competing marketplaces can charge different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>fees.</b> This analysis provides insights which can be used to guide the charging behaviour of competing marketplaces. We also analyse whether two marketplaces can co-exist in equilibrium. We find that, when both marketplaces are limited to charging the same type of fees, traders will eventually converge to one marketplace. However, when different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>fees</b> are allowed, traders may converge to different marketplaces (i. e. multiple marketplaces can co-exist) ...|$|E

40|$|This article {{develops}} {{an analytical}} framework for viewing {{the rules on}} attorney fee arrangements that have been adopted in the United States and in major western European countries. In section II the paper explains the choice of economic agency theory {{as a starting point}} for developing this framework. Within the meaning of economic agency, the attorney is a dual agent, with duties to both the client and the judicial system. In section III the paper identifies five interests that form the basis for evaluating fee systems. These interests are derived from applying basic agency theory to the duties of the attorney as an agent of both the client and the judicial system, and extracting the more specific aspects <b>of</b> both <b>types</b> <b>of</b> duties. In sections IV and V the interest analysis is applied to three <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>fee</b> arrangements [...] the fixed fee, the hourly fee, and the contingency fee. We select these <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>fee</b> arrangements because they represents key distinct elements, one or more of which seems to be present in any <b>of</b> the <b>fee</b> systems used in the United States or in western Europe. The key distinct element <b>of</b> the fixed <b>fee</b> is that the attorney will be paid the amount agreed upon, without regard to effort or to risk. The key distinct element <b>of</b> the hourly <b>fee</b> is that the attorney will be compensated based on effort, as measured by time spent working, without regard to a fixed amount or to risk. The key distinct element <b>of</b> the contingency <b>fee</b> is that the attorney is compensated for assuming risk, without regard to an agreed upon amount or effort expended. By isolating the way these three distinct <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>fee</b> arrangements affect interests that are important in all <b>of</b> the western <b>fees</b> systems, we build a framework for evaluating the many fee arrangements that utilize and combine these key elements, such as the United Kingdom 2 ̆ 7 s new conditional fee system. This framework avoids the dominant tendency of the literature to focus on the flaws <b>of</b> a particular <b>fee</b> system in isolation from its alternatives...|$|R
