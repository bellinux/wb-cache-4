5|$|After the {{momentary}} reduction in speed, <b>the</b> <b>train</b> {{turns to the}} right and descends into a downward 540-degree helix. Immediately following the first helix, <b>the</b> <b>train</b> climbs into an upward 270-degree helix to the left. Following the climb is a small descent and a final hill. <b>The</b> <b>train</b> climbs up from the final hill into the terminal brake run.|$|E
5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>train</b> {{departs from}} the station, it {{immediately}} begins {{to climb the}} vertical (90 degree) lift hill. Upon reaching {{the top of the}} lift, <b>the</b> <b>train</b> turns 45 degrees backwards putting <b>the</b> <b>train</b> and its riders in an upside down position. Then, as <b>the</b> <b>train</b> exits the lift, it goes through a heartline roll before going down the only drop in the layout of the roller coaster. <b>The</b> <b>train</b> speeds through the station going back up the lift. Once it loses momentum <b>the</b> <b>train</b> then returns down passing through the station again. It then proceeds back up the drop and partially into the heartline roll before once again losing momentum and returning to the ground. After passing the station for the third time, <b>the</b> <b>train</b> is stopped {{near the top of the}} lift hill. It is then lowered back down to the station where the next riders board <b>the</b> <b>train.</b> The XT 150 has the option of sending riders around a second cycle at the operator's discretion. When <b>the</b> <b>train</b> stops on the lift hill at the end of the ride, instead of lowering slowly back to the station, the chain will raise the car up and send it through the ride again.|$|E
