40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect of entrepreneurs' pesonal income <b>tax</b> <b>situations</b> on {{the growth rate of}} their enterprises. We analyze the {{personal}} income tax returns {{of a large number of}} sole proprietors before and after the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and determine how the substantial reductions in marginal tax rates associated with that law affected the growth of their firms as measured by gross receipts. We find that individual income taxes exert a statistically and quantitatively significant influence on firm growth rates. Raising the sole proprietor's tax price (one minus the marginal tax rate) by 10 percent increases receipts by about 8. 4 percent. This findings is consistent with the view that raising income tax rates discourages the growth of small businesses. ...|$|R
40|$|Demand is a {{perceived}} need to exhaust resources {{to manage a}} situation. Although previous models of demand and stress have acknowledged the existence of potential gain in these <b>taxing</b> <b>situations,</b> they have focused primarily on the potential for loss. The present research tests a multivalence extension of the transactional model of stress to address the role of secondary appraisal in positively-valenced demand. Across three experiments, I demonstrate that secondary appraisal moderates the relationship between demand and valence, {{as well as an}} important cognitive outcome: problem solving. When secondary appraisal is high, demand increases positive valence and improves problemsolving performance. When secondary appraisal is low, demand increases negative valence and impairs problem-solving performance. These results are consistent with the theoretical structure of eustress and demonstrate the need to further explore positivelyvalenced demand in stress research...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect of entrepreneurs' {{personal}} income <b>tax</b> <b>situations</b> on their use of labor. We analyze the income tax returns {{of a large number}} of sole proprietors before and after the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and determine how the substantial reductions in marginal tax rates associated with that law affected their decisions to hire labor and the size of their wage bills. We find that individual income taxes exert a statistically and quantitatively significant influence on the probability that an entrepreneur hires workers. Raising the entrepreneur's tax price' (one minus the marginal tax rate) by 10 percent raises the mean probability of hiring workers by about 12 percent. Further, conditional on hiring employees, taxes also influence the total wage payments to those workers. The elasticity of the median wage bill with respect to the tax price is about 0. 37. ...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. Com. (Taxation)) [...] University of the Witwatersrand, Faculty of Commerce, Law and Management, School of Accountancy, 2014. With the {{international}} platform for cross border investment {{and economic development}} growing year on year at a steady pace, it has become apparent that bilateral income tax treaties do not always operate effectively in multilateral <b>tax</b> <b>situations.</b> Global transactions involving more than two states are certainly not uncommon {{and it could be}} said that the most fundamental issue in international taxation is double taxation resulting from the taxing rights of different tax jurisdictions that ‘overlap’ with regard to, generally speaking, one taxpayer or one declared income stream. Multilateral <b>tax</b> <b>situations,</b> commonly known as triangular cases, occur where tax incidence on a particular stream of income is triggered in three countries. These situations typically arise where a person who is a tax resident in two respective countries for tax purposes (a dual resident), or a person who is a tax resident in one country and has a permanent establishment in another, is earning revenue of which the source is in a third country. Taxing rights and jurisdictions of the three countries involved could potentially be in conflict with each other and therefore such situations may bring about lawful international triangular taxation or double taxation which will inevitably discourage enterprises from continuing investment and development internationally. Broad multilateral treaties in the income tax arena are not common 1, and most treaties are still of a bilateral nature, i. e. generally addressing tax scenarios where only two specific countries are involved. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development’s (’the OECD’) Model Tax Convention states this: There are no reasons to believe that the conclusion of a multilateral tax convention involving all Member countries could now be considered practicable. The Committee therefore considers that bilateral conventions are still a more appropriate way to ensure the elimination of double taxation at {{the international}} level. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the economic impact}} of export subsidies by investigating stock price reactions to a critical event in 1997. On November 18, 1997, the European Union announced its intention to file a complaint before the World Trade Organization (WTO), arguing that the United States provided American exporters illegal subsidies by permitting them to use Foreign Sales Corporations to exempt a fraction of export profits from taxation. Share prices of American exporters fell sharply on this news, and its implication that the WTO might force the United States to eliminate the subsidy, which happened in 2004. The share price declines were largest for exporters with high profit margins and those whose <b>tax</b> <b>situations</b> made the threatened export subsidy particularly valuable. This evidence suggests that export subsidies do not merely benefit foreign consumers, but also improve the profitability of exporters, particularly those earning rents in imperfectly competitive markets. ...|$|R
