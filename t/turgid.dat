5|$|The androecium {{consists}} of six stamens with filiform (thread like) filaments, which are fasciculate (in close bundles) and declinate or ascendent. The anthers are dorsifixed or versatile. In the gynaecium, the ovary is inferior and trilocular with pluriovulate locules. The style is filiform, and the stigma trifid. The fruit forms a trivalve capsule containing seeds which are dry, flattened, obliquely winged or irregularly discoid, hardly ever <b>turgid,</b> and globose (spherical) or subglobose, with a brown or black phytomelanous testa.|$|E
5|$|During sexual arousal, the {{clitoris}} and {{the whole}} of the genitalia engorge and change color as the erectile tissues fill with blood (vasocongestion), and the individual experiences vaginal contractions. The ischiocavernosus and bulbocavernosus muscles, which insert into the corpora cavernosa, contract and compress the dorsal vein of the clitoris (the only vein that drains the blood from the spaces in the corpora cavernosa) and the arterial blood continues a steady flow and, having no way to drain out, fills the venous spaces until they become <b>turgid</b> and engorged with blood. This is what leads to clitoral erection.|$|E

25|$|Most {{of these}} {{perceptions}} arise from Wagner's published opinions {{on a number}} of topics. Wagner was a voluminous writer and published essays and pamphlets {{on a wide range of}} subjects throughout his life. Wagner's writing style is verbose, unclear and <b>turgid,</b> which has greatly added to the confusion about his opinions. Several of his writings have achieved some notoriety, in particular his essay Das Judenthum in der Musik, (Jewishness in Music), a critical view on the influence of Jews in German culture and society at that time. The essays he wrote in his final years were also controversial, with many readers perceiving them to employ an endorsement of racist beliefs. Some commentators also believe that some of Wagner's operas contain adverse caricatures of Jews.|$|E

500|$|Although cabbage has an {{extensive}} history, {{it is difficult}} to trace its exact origins owing to the many varieties of leafy greens classified as [...] "brassicas". The wild ancestor of cabbage, Brassica oleracea, originally found in Britain and continental Europe, is tolerant of salt but not encroachment by other plants and consequently inhabits rocky cliffs in cool damp coastal habitats, retaining water and nutrients in its slightly thickened, <b>turgid</b> leaves. According to the triangle of U theory of the evolution and relationships between Brassica species, B. oleracea and other closely related kale vegetables (cabbages, kale, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and cauliflower) represent one of three ancestral lines from which all other brassicas originated.|$|E

The game was remembered as {{contentious}} for Tyrone fans, for the fact that a point that would have equalised the match in the dying seconds was controversially disallowed, because the blind-sided referee deemed Canavan to have touched the ball on the ground. The referee, Paddy Russell stated in his autobiography that he was certain the ball was on the ground, but Canavan contested in the same book that he managed to get elevation on the ball as he punched, which would have been very difficult to do if it was touching the ground.|$|E

[...] The Boston Globes Ty Burr wrote, [...] "What’s missing from this Superman saga is a sense of lightness, of pop joy". The Washington Posts Ann Hornaday stated that with [...] "Hans Zimmer’s <b>turgid,</b> over-produced score", the film [...] "is an exceptionally-unpleasant viewing experience".

[...] Jon Dolan of the magazine Entertainment Weekly found the song to be a [...] "bruising breakup lament that turns into an anthem of freedom." [...] Giving the song a negative review, Alex Nun of musicOMH wrote that [...] "Sweet Sacrifice" [...] was [...] "a <b>turgid</b> attempt to recapture past glories, the heard-before riffs and shockingly average vocals act as a slap from the proverbial wet fish."

Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave 3 out of 5 stars and said, [...] "Barfi had the potential to be great cinema, but as it stands it's a respectable film that's still better than a lot else you're likely to see."

500|$|... "Get Me Bodied" [...] is a {{moderate}} R, and bounce song, which displays influences of dance-pop, dancehall, and funk music. Jim DeRogatis of Chicago Sun-Times wrote {{that it is}} a musical mixture of double Dutch rhyming and reggae-rap. [...] According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by EMI Music Publishing, the song is written in the key of G minor, and is set in common time at {{a moderate}} groove of 100 beats per minute. Beyoncé's vocals range from the note of Bb3 to F5. [...] "Get Me Bodied" [...] progresses on a lurching and <b>turgid</b> beat. Its instrumentation includes drum patterns, surging horns, and synthesizers. The song also utilizes handclaps and syncopated interlocked clicks, which are interspersed with background chants, vocal exclamations, vocal gymnastics, and Texas twang. Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker commented that some notes which begin as [...] "legato exhalations" [...] constrict into shouts. Mike Joseph of PopMatters noted that [...] "Get Me Bodied" [...] is [...] "the glorified version" [...] of Gwen Stefani's [...] "Hollaback Girl" [...] (2005).|$|E
500|$|In 2011, Eastwood {{directed}} J. Edgar, a biopic of FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, with Leonardo DiCaprio in {{the title}} role. The film received mixed reviews, although DiCaprio's performance as Hoover was widely praised. The Rotten Tomatoes consensus was, [...] "Leonardo DiCaprio gives a predictably powerhouse performance, but J. Edgar stumbles in all other departments". Roger Ebert wrote that the film is [...] "fascinating," [...] "masterful," [...] and praised DiCaprio's performance. David Edelstein of New York Magazine, while also praising DiCaprio, wrote, [...] "It's too bad J. Edgar is so shapeless and <b>turgid</b> and ham-handed, so rich in bad lines and worse readings". In January 2011, {{it was announced that}} Eastwood was in talks to direct Beyoncé Knowles in a third remake of the 1937 film A Star Is Born; however, the project was delayed due to Beyoncé's pregnancy. Eastwood then starred in the baseball drama Trouble with the Curve (2012), as a veteran baseball scout who travels with his daughter for a final scouting trip. Robert Lorenz, who worked with Eastwood as an assistant director on several films, directed the film.|$|E
500|$|In the NME, Tony Tyler {{began his}} review {{by stating that}} he had long idolised Harrison as [...] "the finest {{packaged}} object since frozen pizza", but he had changed his opinion dramatically in recent years; after the [...] "dire, ennui-making" [...] All Things Must Pass, Tyler continued, [...] "the unworthiness of my heretical thoughts smote home {{around the time of}} the Bangla Desh concerts." [...] Tyler dismissed Material World with the description: [...] " [...] pleasant, competent, vaguely dull and inoffensive. It’s also breathtakingly unoriginal and – lyrically at least – <b>turgid,</b> repetitive and so damn holy I could scream." [...] The reviewer concluded: [...] "I have no doubt whatever it'll sell like hot tracts and that George'll donate all the profits to starving Bengalis and make me feel like the cynical heel I undoubtedly am." [...] In their 1975 book , Tyler and co-author Roy Carr bemoaned Harrison's [...] "didactically imposing [...] said Holy Memoirs upon innocent record-collectors" [...] and declared the album's spiritual theme [...] "almost as offensive in its own way" [...] as Lennon and Yoko Ono's political radicalism on Some Time in New York City (1972).|$|E
500|$|Several of the family's storylines were criticised and branded as {{unbelievable}} {{and poorly}} researched, {{and they were}} cited {{as one of the}} main reasons viewing figures for the show dropped to a low of 6.2 million. One columnist for the Daily Mirror wrote, [...] "Never has a family bored me so much. During their transplant saga I nearly donated a kidney myself to end the <b>turgid</b> tale. Get rid of 'em." [...] Fans called for the family to be axed, and an editorial on the Daily Mirror stated: [...] "The Ferreiras' father, Dan, was probably not just the worst character in soap, but the most annoying, unlikeable person on all television. Inveterate gambler, Ash and daughter Kareena are mere ciphers while Adi is just weird – like a gay version of a character from Rainbow. Ronny Ferreira, meanwhile, [...] presided over the most boring storyline in EastEnders history when viewers spent several weeks watching him lying in bed growing a beard (i.e. waiting for a kidney transplant). The fact that the Ferreiras still haven't been axed shows how indecisive and complacent the show's executives have become." [...] However, a poll on radio station BBC Asian Network found that 75% of respondents wanted the family to stay.|$|E
500|$|Stipe {{later called}} chorus lyrics of [...] "Sitting Still" [...] from R.E.M. debut album, Murmur, [...] "nonsense", {{saying in a}} 1994 online chat, [...] "You all know there aren't words, per se, {{to a lot of}} the early stuff. I can't even {{remember}} them." [...] In truth, Stipe carefully crafted the lyrics to many early R.E.M. songs. Stipe explained in 1984 that when he started writing lyrics they were like [...] "simple pictures", but after a year he grew tired of the approach and [...] "started experimenting with lyrics that didn't make exact linear sense, and it's just gone from there." [...] In the mid-1980s, as Stipe's pronunciation while singing became clearer, the band decided that its lyrics should convey ideas on a more literal level. Mills explained, [...] "After you've made three records and you've written several songs and they've gotten better and better lyrically the next step would be to have somebody question you and say, are you saying anything? And Michael had the confidence at that point to say yes [...] [...] [...]" [...] Songs like [...] "Cuyahoga" [...] and [...] "Fall on Me" [...] on Lifes Rich Pageant dealt with such concerns as pollution. Stipe incorporated more politically oriented concerns into his lyrics on Document and Green. [...] "Our political activism and the content of the songs was just a reaction to where we were, and what we were surrounded by, which was just abject horror," [...] Stipe said later. [...] "In 1987 and '88 there was nothing to do but be active." [...] Stipe has since explored other lyrical topics. Automatic for the People dealt with [...] "mortality and dying. Pretty <b>turgid</b> stuff", according to Stipe, while Monster critiqued love and mass culture.|$|E

2500|$|Starting {{with the}} orangery of Sanssouci (1851), [...] "the Neo-Renaissance became the {{obligatory}} style for university and public buildings, for banks and financial institutions, {{and for the}} urban villas" [...] in Germany. Among the most accomplished examples of the style were Villa Meyer in Dresden, Villa Haas in Hesse, Palais Borsig in Berlin, Villa Meissner in Leipzig; the German version of Neo-Renaissance culminated in such <b>turgid</b> projects as the Town Hall in Hamburg (1886-1897) and the Reichstag in Berlin (completed in 1894).|$|E

2500|$|First, Hutton's {{long and}} <b>turgid</b> Theory of the Earth (1795) was popularized {{by his friend}} John Playfair (1802). Not only did Playfair make up for Hutton's {{difficult}} prose, but he also modernized Hutton's theory by soft-pedaling both his [...] "denial of biblical history" [...] and his repeated appeals to final causes. Subsequently, Charles Lyell, who needed an empiricist hero for his own account of the warfare between science and religious bigotry, bolstered Hutton's image as a fieldworker who had no conceptual bias. Finally the legend was consolidated {{in the writings of}} later geologists, who rarely bothered to read Hutton in the original.|$|E
2500|$|The {{series was}} well {{received}} by the public and each volume usually sold out. [...] Dan Davin's Crete had a print run of 4,000 when published in 1953 and promptly sold out.

[...] Its author, journalist Peter Llewellyn, was contracted to produce another volume but slow progress resulted in the cancellation of his contract.

2500|$|Critical {{reception}} of the album has {{tended to focus on}} its thematic bleakness and the <b>turgid</b> noisiness of its instrumentation.

2500|$|The {{style and}} {{focus of the}} show changed {{considerably}} over its run, and starting late in season two the original noir idea was mostly discarded {{in favor of more}} large-scale supernatural-themed conflicts.

[...] Whereas the show initially dealt with the difficulty of being kind to people on a personal basis, the show ultimately focused on Angel's status as an archetypal Champion for humanity, and explored ideas such as moral ambiguity, the spiritual cost of violence, and the nature of free will. [...] The enduring theme throughout the series was the struggle for redemption.|$|E
2500|$|Among the {{negative}} reviews, Times Bryan Walsh found 1Q84 {{to be the}} weakest of Murakami's novels {{in part because it}} excises his typical first-person narrative. A negative review from The A.V.

Also criticizing the book was Sanjay Sipahimalani, who felt the writing was too often lazy and cliched, the Little People were risible rather than menacing, and that the book had too much repetition. Janet Maslin called the novel's [...] "1000 uneventful pages" [...] "stupefying" [...] in her review for The New York Times.
