Think of Him who, in His utter love to us, endured the cross, despising the shame. And what a cross! Truly said the prophet, [...] "His visage was marred more than any man, and His form more than the sons of men:" [...] in hunger and thirst, in tears and sighs, bruised and bleeding, His {{forehead}} crowned with thorns, His sides torn with scourges, His hands and feet gored with nails, His limbs stretched from their sockets, naked upon the shameful cross, the Son of God hung, lingering slowly towards the last gasp, {{in the death of}} the felon and the slave! The most shameful sight that this earth ever saw, and yet the most glorious sight. The most shameful sight, at which the sun in heaven veiled his face, as if ashamed, and the skies grew black, as if to hide those bleeding limbs from the foul eyes of men; and yet the noblest sight, for in that death upon the cross shone out <b>the</b> utter <b>fullness</b> of all holiness, <b>the</b> utter <b>fullness</b> of all fortitude, <b>the</b> utter <b>fullness</b> of that self- sacrificing love, which had said, [...] "The Son of Man came to seek and to save that which was lost;" [...] <b>the</b> utter <b>fullness</b> of obedient patience, which could say, [...] "Father, not My will but Thine be done;" [...] <b>the</b> utter <b>fullness</b> of generous forgiveness, which could pray, [...] "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do;" [...] <b>the</b> utter <b>fullness</b> of noble fortitude and endurance, which could say at the very moment when a fearful death stared Him in the face, [...] "Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to the Father, and He will send me at once more than twelve armies of angels? But how then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that thus it must be?" ...|$|R
50|$|For believers, <b>the</b> {{place of}} <b>fullness</b> is God. For unbelievers, {{it is within}} the power of reason (Enlightenment) or Nature, or our inner depths (Romanticism).

Only bishops are allowed to perform the sacrament of holy orders.|$|E
25|$|By 1874, skirts {{began to}} taper {{in the front}} and were adorned with trimmings, while sleeves {{tightened}} around the wrist area. Towards 1875 to 1876, bodices featured long but even tighter laced waists, and converged at a sharp point in front. Bustles lengthened and slipped even lower, causing <b>the</b> <b>fullness</b> of the skirt to further diminish. Extra fabric was gathered together behind in pleats, thus creating a narrower but longer tiered, draped train too. Due to the longer trains, petticoats had to be worn underneath {{in order to keep the}} dress clean.|$|E

25|$|The Church {{teaches that}} God {{revealed}} himself gradually, {{beginning in the}} Old Testament, and completing this revelation by sending his son, Jesus Christ, to Earth as a man. This revelation started with Adam and Eve, and was not broken off by their original sin; rather, God promised to send a redeemer. God further revealed himself through covenants between Noah and Abraham. God delivered the law to Moses on Mount Sinai, and spoke through the Old Testament prophets. <b>The</b> <b>fullness</b> of God's revelation was made manifest through {{the coming of the}} Son of God, Jesus Christ.|$|E
25|$|The Eastern Church {{attributes}} {{to the pope}} the most complete and highest power, however in a manner where <b>the</b> <b>fullness</b> and primacy are {{in harmony with the}} rights of the patriarchal sees. This is why, in virtue of and ancient right founded on customs, the Roman Pontiffs did not, except in very significant cases, exercise over these sees the ordinary and immediate jurisdiction that we are asked now to define without any exception. This definition would completely destroy the constitution of the entire Greek church. That is why my conscience as a pastor refuses to accept this constitution.|$|E
25|$|Bra-wearers {{who have}} {{difficulty}} calculating a correct cup size {{may be able}} to find a correct fit using a method adopted by plastic surgeons. Using a flexible tape measure, position the tape at the outside of the chest, under the arm, where the breast tissue begins. Measure across the fullest part of the breast, usually across the nipple, to where the breast tissue stops at the breast bone. This measuring approach assumes that the breasts are not so large or pendulous that they sag significantly, making measuring across <b>the</b> <b>fullness</b> of the breast impractical. Only women whose breasts are firm and spherical can measure without a bra.|$|E

25|$|Mormons again {{point to}} the Bible to show that after every period of apostasy, God always {{eventually}} called another prophet when the time was right. It is in that same spirit that Mormons claim that once conditions were ready, God again resumed his pattern of revealing his will through prophets by calling Joseph Smith, through whom he restored <b>the</b> <b>fullness</b> of the gospel of Jesus Christ, clearing up the error that had been introduced during the Great Apostasy. Mormons believe that since that time, revelation through prophets and apostles has continued unbroken until the present day, God having promised that revelation will not be taken again from the earth before the Second Coming of Christ.|$|E
25|$|Latter Day Saints {{believe that}} the Jews will build the Third Temple and after the Second Coming of Jesus Christ, the Jews will accept Jesus as the Messiah and most Jews will then embrace <b>the</b> <b>fullness</b> of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Then, it is believed, the Third Temple will be God's temple as Christ reigns on the earth and it will become the Jerusalem, Israel LDS Temple. There will be many LDS Temples but two main temples will jointly serve as the central {{governing}} places – the Jerusalem Temple will function as the resurrected Jesus Christ's Eastern Hemisphere governing place and the New Jerusalem Temple in Independence, Missouri will function as the resurrected Jesus Christ's Western Hemisphere governing place. Both of these two temples will have thrones for Jesus Christ to sit on during his millennial reign.|$|E
25|$|Up {{through at}} least the 1970s, most types of popular music used bowed string sections. They were {{extensively}} used in popular music throughout the 1920s and early 1930s. With the rise of swing music, however, from 1935 to 1945, the string sound was often used to add to <b>the</b> <b>fullness</b> of big band music. Following the swing era, from the late 1940s to the mid-1950s, strings began to be revived in traditional pop music. This trend accelerated in the late 1960s, with a significant revival {{of the use of}} strings, especially in soul music. Popular Motown recordings of the late 1960s and 1970s relied heavily on strings as part of their trademark texture. The rise of disco music in the 1970s continued this trend with the heavy use of string instruments in popular disco orchestras (e.g., Love Unlimited Orchestra, Biddu Orchestra, Monster Orchestra, Salsoul Orchestra, MFSB).|$|E

25|$|The Orthodox believe {{themselves}} to be the One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church; that is, the true Church established by Jesus Christ and placed into {{the care of the}} apostles. As almost all other Christian groups are in indirect schism with the Orthodox Church, mostly {{as a result of the}} Great Schism with the Roman Catholic Church at the turn of the second Christian millennium (before the schisms of the Protestant Reformation), these other groups are viewed as being Christian, but who, to varying degrees, lack full theological orthodoxy and orthopraxy. As such, all groups outside of the Orthodox Church are not seen as being members of the Church proper, but rather separated brethren who have failed to retain <b>the</b> <b>fullness</b> of the Christian faith and theology. These deviations from orthodoxy have traditionally been called heresy, but due to the term's perceived pejorative connotations, some prefer the more technical designation of the term heterodoxy.|$|E
25|$|In Roman Catholic theology, the {{doctrine}} of apostolic succession states that Christ gave the full sacramental authority {{of the church to}} the Twelve Apostles in the sacrament of Holy Orders, making them the first bishops. By conferring <b>the</b> <b>fullness</b> of the sacrament of Holy Orders on the apostles, they were given the authority to confer the sacrament of Holy Orders on others, thus consecrating more bishops in a direct lineage that can trace its origin back to the Twelve Apostles and Christ himself. This direct succession of bishops from the apostles to the present day bishops is referred to as apostolic succession. The Roman Catholic Church also holds that within the College of Apostles, Peter was picked out for the unique role of leadership and to serve as the source of unity among the apostles, a role among the bishops and within the church inherited by the pope as Peter's successor today.|$|E
25|$|The Madhyamakālaṃkāra is an eighth-century Buddhist text, {{believed}} to have been originally composed in Sanskrit by Śāntarakṣita (725–788), Though somewhat lyrical, it is a summary and a key to his encyclopedic Tattvasamgraha. It has <b>the</b> <b>fullness</b> of the Sutrayana and Mahayana traditions' development in its place of origin before the Buddhist tradition of India was transposed by the cultures of the Far East (such as China and Japan) and elsewhere (such as Ceylon and Kashmir), where Buddhism was already flourishing in culturally specific forms. The text refutes challenges of Buddhist systems and tenets from within the tradition, and is a pedagogical discourse {{on the development of the}} yana; the philosophical challenges posed by the non-Buddhist religions and non-Dharmic traditions of India, and crystallizes a dialectical sophistication of Indian logic and the clarity of debate expected of a Khenpo of Nalanda Vihara. The text was seminal in the tradition of Samye which became known as a Nyingma institution in contrast to the emergent Sarma traditions of Atisha's (980-1054) translation phase. It documents the Nyingma view of the Two Truths, making it a canonical work. Although the text was marginalized due to the rise of the Prasaṅgika subschool of Mādhyamaka, it was revived by Ju Mipham's (1846–1912) 1876 Commentary.|$|E
30|$|On {{the expense}} of {{complexity}} at client, the server is relived from the major work, i.e., flow of stream analysis. The media content is encoded initially in a standard quality and then streamed to the client. As soon as the streaming starts, the client starts the buffering of media content and applies the proposed algorithm to estimate the buffer filling rate. While the video stream is being played, <b>the</b> buffer <b>fullness</b> rate is sampled periodically, and this chronological data acts as an input to the proposed algorithm. If <b>the</b> buffer <b>fullness</b> is too high or too low, a feedback message {{is sent to the}} server to adjust the outgoing stream property.
