5|$|This pan-Germanic Empire was {{expected}} <b>to</b> <b>assimilate</b> practically all of Germanic Europe into an enormously expanded Reich. Territorially speaking, this encompassed the already-enlarged German Reich itself (consisting of pre-1938 Germany proper, Austria, Bohemia, Moravia, Alsace-Lorraine, Eupen-Malmedy, Memel, Lower Styria, Upper Carniola, Southern Carinthia and German-occupied Poland), the Netherlands, the Flemish part of Belgium, Luxembourg, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Iceland, {{at least the}} German-speaking parts of Switzerland and Liechtenstein.|$|E
5|$|After {{a failure}} <b>to</b> <b>assimilate</b> Indigenous {{children}} by early missionaries in the 17th century, educational programs were not widely attempted again by religious officials until the 1820s, {{prior to the}} introduction of state-sanctioned operations. Included among them was a school established by John West, an Anglican missionary, at the Red River Colony in what is today Manitoba. Protestant missionaries also opened residential schools in the current Ontario region, spreading Christianity and working to encourage Indigenous peoples to adopt subsistence agriculture as a way to ensure they would not return to their original, nomadic ways of life upon graduation.|$|E

Some assimilation policies included: the ban of all books written in Danish or Norwegian, thus breaking the promise made at the Treaty of Roskilde; the use of Swedish language in the conduct of sermons; and all new priests and teachers having to come from Sweden.|$|E

5|$|Detestation of {{existing}} policies is easily transformed into forcible {{resistance of the}} authority which puts them in execution, {{and it would be}} folly to disregard the causal relation between the two. Yet <b>to</b> <b>assimilate</b> agitation, legitimate as such, with direct incitement to violent resistance, is to disregard the tolerance of all methods of political agitation which in normal times is a safeguard for free government. The distinction is not scholastic subterfuge, but a hard-bought acquisition in the fight for freedom.|$|E
5|$|Finland {{had been}} {{the eastern part of}} the Swedish kingdom for centuries until 1809, during the Napoleonic Wars, when Imperial Russia conquered and {{converted}} it into an autonomous buffer state within the Russian Empire to protect Saint Petersburg, the imperial capital. Finland enjoyed wide autonomy and its own Senate until the turn of the century, when Russia began attempts <b>to</b> <b>assimilate</b> Finland as part of a general policy to strengthen central government and unify the Empire by Russification. These attempts ruined relations and increased the support of Finnish movements vying for self-government.|$|E

Before the age of 20 Mehldau also had gigs in Cobb's band, along with fellow student Peter Bernstein on guitar.|$|E
5|$|Although {{not without}} conflict, European Canadians' early {{interactions}} with First Nations and Inuit populations were relatively peaceful. First Nations and Métis peoples {{played a critical}} part {{in the development of}} European colonies in Canada, particularly for their role in assisting European coureur des bois and voyageurs in the exploration of the continent during the North American fur trade. The Crown and indigenous peoples began interactions during the European colonization period, though the Inuit, in general, had more limited interaction with European settlers. However, from the late 18th century, European Canadians encouraged indigenous peoples <b>to</b> <b>assimilate</b> into their own culture. These attempts reached a climax in the late 19th and early 20th centuries with forced integration and relocations. A period of redress is underway, which started with the appointment of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada by the Government of Canada in 2008.|$|E

5|$|Another {{focus of}} the Canadian {{government}} {{was to make the}} Aboriginal groups of Canada sedentary, as they thought that this would make them easier <b>to</b> <b>assimilate.</b> In the 19th century, the government began to support the creation of model farming villages, which were meant to encourage non-sedentary Aboriginal groups to settle in an area and begin to cultivate agriculture. When most of these model farming villages failed, the government turned instead to the creation of Indian reserves with the Indian Act of 1876. With the creation of these reserves came many restricting laws, such as further bans on all intoxicants, restrictions on eligibility to vote in band elections, decreased hunting and fishing areas, and inability for status Indians to visit other groups on their reservations.|$|E
5|$|The Western Roman Empire {{began to}} {{disintegrate}} {{in the early}} 5th century as Germanic migrations and invasions overwhelmed {{the capacity of the}} Empire <b>to</b> <b>assimilate</b> the migrants and fight off the invaders. The Romans were successful in fighting off all invaders, most famously Attila, though the empire had assimilated so many Germanic peoples of dubious loyalty to Rome that the empire started to dismember itself. Most chronologies place the end of the Western Roman Empire in 476, when Romulus Augustulus was forced to abdicate to the Germanic warlord Odoacer. By placing himself under the rule of the Eastern Emperor, rather than naming himself Emperor (as other Germanic chiefs had done after deposing past emperors), Odoacer ended the Western Empire by ending the line of Western emperors.|$|E
5|$|The {{religious}} historian R.C. Dhere, {{winner of}} the Sahitya Akademi Award for his book Sri Vitthal: Ek Mahasamanvaya, opines that Vithoba worship may be even older—"Vedic or pre-Vedic", hence pre-dating the worship of Krishna. According to this theory, Vithoba is an amalgam of various local heroes, who gave their lives to save their cattle. He was first worshipped by the Dhangar, the cattle-owning caste of Maharashtra. The rise of the Yadava dynasty, which had cowherd ancestry, could {{have led to the}} glorification of Vithoba as Krishna, who is often depicted as a cowherd. This Vaishnavization of Vithoba also led to conversion of the Shaiva Pundarika shrine to the Vaishnava shrine of the devotee Pundalik, who—according to legend—brought Vithoba to Pandharpur. There may have been an attempt <b>to</b> <b>assimilate</b> Vithoba into Buddhism; today, both are viewed as a form of Vishnu in Hinduism.|$|E

5|$|There {{is little}} {{scholarly}} consensus over {{the presence of}} the Sri Lankan Tamil people in Sri Lanka, also known as Eelam in Sangam literature. One theory states that there was not an organised Sri Lankan Tamil people presence in Sri Lanka until the invasions from what is now South India in the 12th century AD; another theory contends that Tamil people were one of the original inhabitants of the island. Theories about Tamil people's presence in Sri Lanka feed into the cycle of ethnic conflict. Another theory states that the Sri Lankan Tamils are descendant of the Nagas, who started <b>to</b> <b>assimilate</b> to Tamil culture and language around 3rd BCE.|$|E

Djokovic improved his serve from that point but lost the set. A role reversal in the second set saw Djokovic move into a 4–1 lead. Murray fought back, however, to level the score to 5–5 and won the set to secure the victory. This was Murray's third title win {{of the season and}} eleventh of his career. It was also his third Masters win of the career. Murray credited his improved fitness for his win.

5|$|The Europeans (French, Dutch and English) in the Northeast {{developed}} a fur trade with natives, including the Five Nations of the Iroquois; beaver furs were most desired. However, in the 17th century, {{the dominance of}} what historian Daniel Richter refers to as “Francophiles” or French takeover, contributed to an erosion of French-native relations. The French mission <b>to</b> <b>assimilate</b> natives required the abandonment of native tradition, which was met with resistance. By 1667, large numbers of Huron and Iroquois, especially Mohawk, started arriving at the St Lawrence Valley and its mission villages, to escape the effects of warfare. Many traditionalists, including some Mohawk, resented the Jesuits for destroying traditional native society but were unable {{to do anything to}} stop them. However, traditionalists reluctantly accepted the establishment of a mission in order to have good relations with the French, whom they needed for trade.
