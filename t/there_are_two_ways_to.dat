5|$|At present, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> get to Arad: by air or road. The only highway {{connecting}} Arad {{with the}} rest of the country is Highway 31, which connects it with Beersheba to the west, and the Dead Sea to the east. It has two junctions within Arad's municipal area—the Arad Junction (within the city itself, with Road 3199), and the Tel Arad Junction (with Highway 80). The local Road 3199 connects Arad with Masada, but does not connect to the road next to the dead sea (Highway 90). It is therefore the only way to get to Masada's western side.|$|E
5|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> get to Lundy, {{depending}} {{on the time of}} year. In the summer months (April to October) visitors are carried on the Landmark Trust's own vessel, MS Oldenburg, which sails from both Bideford and Ilfracombe. Sailings are usually three days a week, on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays, with additional sailings on Wednesdays during July and August. The voyage takes on average two hours, {{depending on}} ports, tides and weather. The Oldenburg was first registered in Bremen, Germany in 1958 and has been sailing to Lundy since her engine was replaced in 1985.|$|E

5|$|The {{objective}} in Days of Ruin {{is for the}} player to use their military force to defeat the enemy's force. Except for certain single player missions with special objectives, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> defeat an opponent: destroy all of the enemy's units or capture their headquarters. The battle system is turn-based. Two to four forces, each headed by a commanding officer (CO), take turns building and commanding units on grid-based maps. Every turn, units, which consist of ground, sea and air units, can move across {{the different types of}} terrain and attack enemy units or perform other actions, such as submerging a submarine or resupplying friendly units. Many factors can affect the battle, such as Fog of War, a phenomenon that prevents players from seeing enemy units other than those in the visual range of their units; various weather conditions; and CO powers.|$|E

25|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> {{configure}} a {{breeder reactor}} {{to do the}} required breeding. One can place the fertile and fissile fuel together, so breeding and splitting occurs in the same place. Alternatively, fissile and fertile can be separated. The latter is known as core-and-blanket, because a fissile core produces the heat and neutrons while a separate blanket does all the breeding.|$|E

Implied consent, means that a patient's consent to share personal confidential information is assumed. When personal confidential information is shared between healthcare workers, consent is taken as implied.|$|E

25|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> {{approach}} {{these symptoms}} using drugs: rate control and rhythm control. Rate control seeks {{to reduce the}} heart rate to one that is closer to normal, usually 60 to 100bpm, without trying to convert to a regular rhythm. Rhythm control seeks to restore with cardioversion the regular heart rhythm and maintain it with drugs. Studies suggest that rhythm control is mainly a concern in newly diagnosed AF, while rate control is {{more important in the}} chronic phase. Rate control with anticoagulation is as effective a treatment as rhythm control in long term mortality studies, the AFFIRM Trial.|$|E
25|$|If at {{any point}} in the game a player can use another player's discard to {{complete}} a legal hand (and with the agreed minimum points), they yell out 'Mahjong', take the piece and reveal their hand, with the way of calling it out depending on variations. This ends the hand, and scoring commences. If two or three players need the piece to win, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> resolve the issue depending on agreed table rules: Either the players compete to see who would have a better hand in terms of scoring, or simply the player closest to the discarder in order of turn wins the game.|$|E
25|$|Laser fusion was {{suggested}} in 1962 by scientists at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, {{shortly after the}} invention of the laser itself in 1960. At the time, Lasers were low power machines, but low-level research began as early as 1965. Laser fusion, formally known as inertial confinement fusion, involves imploding a target by using laser beams. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> do this: indirect drive and direct drive. In direct drive, the laser blasts a pellet of fuel. In indirect drive, the lasers blast a structure around the fuel. This makes x-rays that squeeze the fuel. Both methods compress the fuel so that fusion can take place.|$|E

25|$|In general <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> {{set up a}} {{transducer}} {{system to}} measure the sound velocity in a solid. One is a setup with two or more transducers where one is acting as a transmitter, while the other(s) is acting as a receiver. The sound velocity measurement can then be done by measuring the time between a signal is generated at the transmitter {{and when it is}} recorded at the receiver while assuming to know (or measure) the distance the acoustic signal have traveled between the transducers, or conversely to measure the resonance frequency knowing the thickness over which the wave resonate. The other type of setup is often called a pulse-echo system. Here one transducer is placed {{in the vicinity of the}} specimen acting both as transmitter and receiver. This requires a reflective interface where the generated signal can be reflected back toward the transducer which then act as a receiver recording the reflected signal. See ultrasonic testing for some measurement systems.|$|E
25|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> {{amend the}} Constitution, {{depending}} {{on the nature of}} the provision being amended. Most of the Constitution's Articles can be amended with the support of more than two-thirds of all the Members of Parliament during the Second and Third Readings of each constitutional amendment bill. However, provisions protecting Singapore's sovereignty can only be amended if supported at a national referendum by at least two-thirds of the total number of votes cast. This requirement also applies to Articles 5(2A) and 5A, though these provisions are not yet operational. Article 5(2A) protects certain core constitutional provisions such as the fundamental liberties in Part IV of the Constitution, and Articles relating to the President's election, powers, , immunity from suit, and removal from office; while Article 5A enables the President to veto proposed constitutional amendments that directly or indirectly circumvent or curtail his discretionary powers. These provisions are not yet in force as the Government views the Elected Presidency as an evolving institution in need of further refinements.|$|E

[...] The game's sequel, Super Smash Bros.

Dr. Mario characters also appear in the game as collectible stickers. Dr. Mario would later return as an unlockable playable character in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U.|$|E
500|$|An {{alternative}} {{proof of}} sufficiency {{can be used}} to show that there are many different flat foldings. Consider the smallest angle [...] and the two creases on either side of it. Mountain-fold one of these two creases and valley-fold the other, choosing arbitrarily which fold to use for which crease. Then, glue the resulting flap of paper onto the remaining part of the crease pattern. The result of this gluing will be a crease pattern with two fewer creases, on a conical sheet of paper, that still satisfies Kawasaki's condition. Therefore, by mathematical induction, repeating this process will eventually lead to a flat folding. The base case of the induction is a cone with only two creases and two equal-angle wedges, which can obviously be flat-folded by using a mountain fold for both creases. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> choose which folds to use in each step of this method, and each step eliminates two creases. Therefore, any crease pattern with [...] creases that satisfies Kawasaki's condition has at least [...] different choices of mountain and valley folds that all lead to valid flat foldings.|$|E
