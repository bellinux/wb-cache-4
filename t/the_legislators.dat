5|$|By 1826, the {{economic}} climate {{in the state}} had improved significantly. Seeing the resultant upsurge in Old Court support, {{two of the four}} New Court justices resigned. Desha offered the appointments to three different individuals, all of whom ignored or rejected them. John Telemachus Johnson finally accepted the appointment in April 1826, and the New Court met with only three justices during its 1826 term. In the August 1826 elections, the Old Court Party won majorities of 5644 in the House and 2216 in the Senate. Desha again encouraged <b>the</b> <b>legislators</b> to compromise to resolve the court impasse. The Old Court majorities in both houses, however, completely repudiated the New Court, passing a bill to restore the Old Court and overturn all legislation related to the New Court. Desha vetoed the bill, and scolded <b>the</b> <b>legislators</b> for passing a blatantly partisan bill as opposed to a compromise measure. The General Assembly overrode Desha's veto on January 1, 1827. In a conciliatory move, the Senate confirmed Desha's appointment of George M.

40|$|Abstract This study {{analyses}} {{the attitude}} of <b>the</b> <b>legislator</b> in <b>the</b> United Arab Emirates towards capital punishment and its usage. The study examines whether <b>the</b> <b>legislator</b> is moving towards abolishing this harsh punishment or is insisting in using it, and in either case asks why. This study also examines the reasons for <b>the</b> <b>legislator</b> attitude and whether it has {{been affected by the}} global trend and the global movement towards abolishing this penalty for all crimes, even for those committed in wartime. Further, the study asks whether <b>the</b> <b>legislator</b> in <b>the</b> United Arab Emirates follows the Western way of thinking in dealing with this punishment or whether it is still connected with its Islamic roots in using this punishment. An overview of the crimes punished by death in the Islamic Sharia provisions is provided in the first three chapters. Chapter 4 provides the background of the formation of the UAE and the development of its legal system, clarifying how the system could avoid the execution of an innocent person. Chapter 5 deals in depth, and critically, with the details of crimes punishable by death according to the punitive laws of the United Arab Emirates to examine how far <b>the</b> <b>legislator</b> was justified in deciding such penalty for such crimes. Chapter 6 of this study deals with the rights of the defendant facing the death penalty and the evidential guarantees provided by <b>the</b> <b>legislator</b> during <b>the</b> interrogation and trial, and whether such guarantees would save the life of an innocent person. Then Chapter 7 along with chapter 8 examine the differences between Islamic and Western laws in the ways they deal with the death penalty and serious crimes. Chapter 9 examines the impact on <b>the</b> UAE <b>legislator,</b> at <b>the</b> level of the constitution and punitive laws, of the global trend with respect to the death penalty, whether <b>the</b> UAE <b>legislator</b> has been affected and influenced by this trend, and the extent of any influence. This study concludes with Chapter 10, which discusses recommendations concerning this harsh punishment...|$|R

5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1955, the eastern United States {{experienced}} generally hot and dry weather, leading to drought conditions and decreased water levels. When Hurricane Connie struck, its rainfall moistened the soil and heightened creeks throughout the Mid-Atlantic and New England. Hurricane Diane struck North Carolina just five days later and affected the same general area. After floods in 1936, the United States federal government enacted plans to prevent future devastating floods, although they made no progress by the time Connie and Diane struck in 1955. Along the Delaware River in the 1930s, state legislatures in New Jersey and Pennsylvania had established a commission that worked to clean up polluted water, but <b>the</b> <b>legislators</b> and commission blocked federal help, comparing it to European socialism; this was {{in contrast to the}} federally funded Tennessee Valley Authority, which mitigated flooding along the Tennessee River.|$|E
5|$|Left undone, however, was {{extending}} the laws dealing with surveying and registering land claims with the registrar {{of the state}} land office. Cognizant that the old law would expire November 30, 1797, Garrard issued a proclamation on November 3 calling the legislature into special session. <b>The</b> <b>legislators</b> convened on November 28, and Garrard, drawing on {{his experience as a}} surveyor, addressed them regarding the urgency of adopting a new law and forestalling more lawsuits related to land claims, which were already numerous. Although a wealthy landowner himself, Garrard advocated protecting Kentucky's large debtor class from foreclosure on their lands. Garrard supported pro-squatting legislation, including measures that forbade the collection of taxes from squatters on profits they made from working the land they occupied and that required landowners to pay squatters for any improvements they made on their land. Despite opposition from some aristocratic legislators like John Breckinridge, most of the reforms advocated by Garrard were approved in the session.|$|E
40|$|The {{subject of}} the {{investigation}} is the controversial figure of <b>the</b> <b>legislator.</b> <b>The</b> dissertation concerns two defining directions of political modernity: the project of autonomy {{and the emergence of}} economic freedom; and identifies the effects of their collision on the philosophical destiny {{of one of the most}} interesting figures of Western culture: <b>the</b> <b>legislator.</b> Profoundly influenced by the Greek political imagery, Rousseau's oeuvre represents one of the most interesting modern interpretations of the ancient model of political autonomy. Even if Rousseau identifies the community as the alpha and omega of the law-making process, he still postulates the existence of an exceptional mind (<b>the</b> <b>legislator)</b> capable of both molding the social consciousness and correcting the excess of the collective hubris. An advocate of political autonomy expressed through political will and decision, the French thinker and his social model will encounter a fierce opposition from the economists gathered under the banner of economic liberalism (laissez-faire ideology). Believing in a "natural/providential order" which reveals itself through the natural laws of economy, the social philosophers of the economic school criticized Rousseau's social design and proposed a fresh perspective in which <b>the</b> <b>legislator's</b> prestige and authority would significantly diminish. From Rousseau to Molinari through the physiocrates (Quesnay, Baudeau, Lemercier de la Riviere), the Jacobins and the economists of the nineteenth century (Dunoyer, Bastiat, Molinari) this thesis seeks to map <b>the</b> <b>legislator's</b> rise and decline in eighteenth and nineteenth century France...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this essay was to study which {{arguments}} social workers used in {{the basis of their}} estimation concerning young people of the age 13 - 18 given an aid, a contact person (swe. kontaktperson). The purpose was also to describe how the legal paragraph, regarding contact person, is regulated and then compare the arguments made by the social worker with the intentions expressed by <b>the</b> <b>legislator.</b> To answer our purposes we studied the law and the intentions expressed by <b>the</b> <b>legislator,</b> which is <b>the</b> foundation for the legal paragraph that regulates contact person, 3 chap. 6 §. Through studies of social journals at five local authorities we collected material to make a comparison between the arguments found in the journals with the intentions expressed by <b>the</b> <b>legislator.</b> We used legal method and the perspective of sociology of law. The Swedish law, Socialtjänstlagen (2001 : 453) is a basic law which means that our legal paragraph, 3 chap 6 §, is open for interpretation. It is every local authority's own option how to apply the paragraph.

Hancock declined the office, however, not wanting to appear to have been co-opted by the governor. Nevertheless, Hancock used the improved relationship to resolve an ongoing dispute.
