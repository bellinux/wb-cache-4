5|$|Former {{chairman}} Eggert Magnússon {{made clear}} his ambition for West Ham {{to move to}} the Olympic Stadium after the 2012 Summer Olympics, a desire reiterated by current chairmen Gold and Sullivan when they assumed control of the club stating that <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> was a logical move for the Government {{as it was in the}} borough of Newham.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, Lawrence {{introduced}} Mars to {{his future}} A manager at Atlantic Records, Aaron Bay-Schuck. After hearing him play {{a couple of}} songs on the guitar, Bay-Schuck wanted to sign him immediately, but it took roughly three years for Atlantic records to finally sign Mars to the label, because <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> was too early and that he still needed to develop as an artist.|$|E

5|$|E. Swedish wrestler Ara Abrahamian was {{originally}} awarded {{a bronze medal}} in the Greco-Roman 84 kg event. However, at the medal ceremony he walked off the podium and dropped his medal on the mat in protest of the judging in his event. On August 16, 2008, the International Olympic Committee decided to strip him of his medal because <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> amounted to a political demonstration and was disrespectful to other athletes.|$|E
5|$|During filming in Sierra Gorda, Chile, {{the local}} mayor, Carlos Lopez, staged a protest {{because he was}} angry at the filmmakers' {{portrayal}} of the Antofagasta Region as part of Bolivia. He was arrested, detained briefly, and put on trial two days later. Eon dismissed his claim that they needed his permission to film in the area. Michael G. Wilson explained that Bolivia was appropriate to the plot, because of the country's history of water problems, and was surprised the two countries disliked each other a century after the War of the Pacific. In a poll by Chilean daily newspaper La Segunda, 75% of its readers disagreed with Lopez's actions, due to the negative image of Chile <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> presented, and the controversy's potential to put off productions looking to film {{in the country in}} the future.|$|E
5|$|Many women's {{rights activists}} {{who worked with}} Stanton were opposed to the {{publication}} of The Woman's Bible; <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> would harm the drive for women's suffrage. Although it was never accepted by Bible scholars as a major work, it became a popular best-seller, much {{to the dismay of}} suffragists who worked alongside Stanton within the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA). Susan B. Anthony tried to calm the younger suffragists, but they issued a formal denunciation of the book, and worked to distance the suffrage movement from Stanton's broader scope which included attacks on traditional religion. Because of the widespread negative reaction, including that of suffragists who had been close to her, publication of the book effectively ended Stanton's influence in the suffrage movement.|$|E

5|$|Other {{additions}} {{include the}} Rig and the Anti-Tank; the Rig is {{a modified version}} of an APC from the previous titles modified to be able to build temporary buildings, while the Anti-Tank is both a direct and long-range weapon specifically designed to do damage to tanks. Two modifications include the Battleship, which can now move and attack in one round, and the Aircraft Carrier, which can produce low-fuel aircraft called Seaplanes. Another new unit is the Gunship, which can attack and carry units as well. In discussing the online play of the game, the developers felt that it was necessary to limit online battles to only two people per battle, explaining that <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> would be too boring for a player to have to sit and stare at a screen while three other people made their moves.|$|E
5|$|Precautions {{were taken}} to prevent secrets from the season finale being revealed; only certain staff members were {{provided}} with copies of the episode, which were given on watermarked DVDs and distributed to secret hiding places. The writers wanted Michael {{to have a big}} plan to get Holly back, but to realize throughout {{the course of the day}} that his relationship with Holly was something special and that he did not want to disrupt it; <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> showed that Michael had become more mature, calm and confident about this relationship than that of Jan Levinson and others in his past. The first scene with Michael and Holly discussing their sketch possibilities in a secluded area was filmed with three cameras: one focusing on each side of the two actors, and one from the front of both of them to establish that the picnic was still going on behind them. Due to space limitations, the latter angle was filmed through a mirror (with the actors appearing to be opposite sides) and then the image was reversed and undistorted in post-production.|$|E
5|$|Sex {{therapist}} Ruth Westheimer {{said the}} device was most favored by those selecting from vibrators of the corded electrical variety. Therapist and sex educator Laura Berman recommended the device in many articles for the Chicago Sun-Times, both for women who had never experienced an orgasm {{and those who had}} difficulty becoming aroused. Sexologist Gloria Brame wrote in her book The Truth about Sex, a Sex Primer for the 21st Century that the Magic Wand was one of the more successful masturbation aids marketed, and stated it was popular due to its non-penetrative nature. Australian clinical psychologist and sex therapist Bettina Arndt reported that a couple she corresponded with had success using the Magic Wand while simultaneously engaging in sexual intercourse. Physician and sex columnist Hilda Hutcherson recommended the Magic Wand in her book Pleasure, and suggested women could place a soft cloth over their vulva if <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> was needed to decrease delivered intensity from the device. Cosmopolitan magazine reported that the Magic Wand was the vibrator most often suggested by sex therapists.|$|E

5|$|The second unit filmed {{part of the}} prologue's 1912 segment from August 29 to September 3. The {{main unit}} began two days later with the circus train {{sequence}} at Alamosa, Colorado, on the Cumbres and Toltec Scenic Railroad. They filmed at Pagosa Springs on September 7, and then at Cortez on September 10. From September 14 to16, filming of Indiana falling into the train carriages took place in Los Angeles. The production then moved to Utah's Arches National Park to shoot more of the opening. A house in Antonito, Colorado {{was used for the}} Jones family home. The production had intended to film at Mesa Verde National Park, but Native American representatives had religious objections to its use. When Spielberg and editor Michael Kahn viewed a rough cut of the film in late 1988, <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> suffered from a lack of action. The motorcycle chase was shot during post-production at Mount Tamalpais and Fairfax near Skywalker Ranch. The closing shot of Indiana, Henry, Sallah and Brody riding into the sunset was filmed in Texas in early 1989.|$|E
5|$|The {{scene where}} Danny Lee chases a gunman onto a tram was filmed in Causeway Bay {{and the crew}} only had three hours to film. Residents {{thought it was a}} real gunfight and phoned the police. However, when the police arrived, Danny Lee talked to the {{superintendent}} so they could continue filming. Scenes from the Dragon Boat festival were shot months apart, some footage was of the boat races and rest of the footage involving the actors was shot months later. It was planned for the boats to flip over during the chase but the owners refused because <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> would bring bad luck. The scene at the airport were filmed at the Kai Tak Airport. The scenes at Paul Chu Kong's character's house were filmed in Stanley, Hong Kong. John Woo wanted this house to be by a beach but a suitable location could not be found. The action scene inside the house took 28 days to shoot. The final action scene took 36 days to shoot and was shot at a remote building made to look like a church while the exterior seen from Ah Jong's apartment is a real church. The original ending of the film involved Jennie waiting at an airport for Li to give her the money and for them to travel to the United States. Due to Sally Yeh's tight filming schedule, the scene was not filmed and replaced with Ah Jong playing the harmonica.|$|E
25|$|The Lienchiang name {{is derived}} from the {{original}} Lianjiang County of Fujian province in Mainland China. In April 2003, the county government started considering changing the name to Matsu County to avoid confusion with the county of the same name on the mainland. Some local people opposed the name change because <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> reflected the pro-independence viewpoint of the Democratic Progressive Party.|$|E

25|$|The Official IRA {{were opposed}} to such a {{campaign}} because <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> would lead to sectarian conflict, which would defeat their strategy of uniting the workers {{from both sides of}} the sectarian divide. The IRA Border Campaign in the 1950s had avoided actions in urban centres of Northern Ireland to avoid civilian casualties and probable resulting sectarian violence. The Provisional IRA, by contrast, was primarily an urban organisation, based originally in Belfast and Derry.|$|E
25|$|In an {{interview}} with Las Vegas Sun reporters, Gibbons said “I never knew this job had a time frame on it that requires me to be sitting behind a desk at a certain hour.” He {{also said that he}} works about 60 hours a week for the state.

25|$|The Holmenkollen Ski Festival {{has been}} {{regarded}} as the de facto World Championships prior to the 1924 Winter Olympics. The Norwegian Ski Federation had been an opponent of establishing World Championships and Winter Olympics because <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> would take away {{the prestige of the}} Ski Festival. Oslo was awarded the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 1930; with exception of Sweden's Erik Rylandet who finished fifth, Norway had the top ten positions.|$|E

25|$|From 1998 through 2005, {{non-profit}} hospitals, {{state and}} local governments and other agencies paid Copeland Lowery at least $13.5 million for federal lobbying.; Many, if not most of these were in the Inland Empire (central and southern California), within or near the district that Lewis represents. The agencies paid the fees because <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> would help them get federal money from a congressman whose door was already - in theory - open to them.|$|E
25|$|They shopped their demo and {{met with}} many record {{companies}} during the summer, negotiated their potential contracts with a lawyer during autumn, and in winter finally signed with Essential Records, a division of Brentwood Music (now collectively entitled Provident Records). This was an unexpected step for the band, as Essential was the smallest company that they interviewed with, but <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> was most like a family. In addition, Essential had solid backing power from the larger Brentwood Music company which owned it, and Brentwood used a secular distributor, Silvertone Records of Zomba/Jive, {{in order to reach}} a wider audience.|$|E
25|$|Failing {{to receive}} {{official}} orders, the Hungarian army ignored the armistice, surprising the Germans. Given that many Hungarian units were {{controlled by the}} German army, {{it is unclear whether}} orders, if issued, ever reached most of the line troops. There had also been considerable propaganda about the harsh, punitive treatment of prisoners by the Soviets, and some Hungarian forces had witnessed first-hand the atrocities Soviet perpetrated against civilians. Combined with their loyalty to their country, no matter what government was in charge, <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> was their duty to fight even when the end result was predictable.|$|E

6000|$|... "Hark!" [...] was {{the reply}} and both {{strained}} their ears. There was a faint crackling of twigs, and <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> certain <b>it</b> was the bear. But {{it was too}} dark to see anything; so both shouldered their rifles and walked back to camp.|$|R

They gave their son that name because <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it’s</b> the kind of name that will always pick up the spirits of people he is with no matter where or when.|$|R
