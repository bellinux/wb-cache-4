5|$|Seeing all the singers, {{you really}} {{come face to}} face with a lot of people that are {{predominantly}} younger. That's inspiring, because <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> to you and they're such big fans and they share with you what song touched them the most and how they had to learn every single ad lib and dissect it. As a vocalist it brought me back to, 'Yeah, that's what I used to do to my Whitney Houston record and my Mariah Carey record and my Etta James record.' It brings you back to a place where it becomes your personal responsibility to infuse the next generation with more information about learning every intricate note. That's why a song called 'Sing for Me' is a special song. It's one of those singer's songs where if you're not a vocalist you can't mess with that song.|$|E

After her initial audition, she was asked to read {{for the role of}} Marcelline, and was [...] "definitely impressed by the character" [...] after seeing design drawings. Olson is also the character's singing voice. The artistic design for Marceline was created by Ward, with small changes and additions added by Phil Rynda, former lead character designer and prop designer for Adventure Time. Olson later related in an interview that she was impressed by her character because, [...] "she has really cool style [...] I love what <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> with [...] every episode."

500|$|Molina {{is known}} for his in-game pitch-calling skills, and {{pitchers}} rarely reject signs that he shows for the next pitch.

[...] But at the same time, they tend to just follow him. [...] We do put them in Yadi's hands." [...] Molina reads opposing hitters and will move fielders with subtle signs and gestures to align them with his pitch calling. [...] La Russa commented that [...] "it's not just instinct. [...] It's sense, based on how a hitter's standing, how he responds to the pitch or two before, and he's very creative in how he makes his adjustment based on what he sees with the hitter and knowing what his pitcher can do." ...|$|E

She continued {{that one of her}} favorite parts of the Peter-as-a-killer arc is being able to watch the emotional setbacks he is facing as a result of Fauxlivia's betrayal; she called it [...] "good characterization, and excellent acting". However, Stegall questioned why Massive Dynamic would build a machine known to be the destroyer of mankind. IGN columnist Ramsey Isler praised the writing staff because [...] "just when you think they might be stuck in old habits, <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> with new ideas and put a whole new perspective on old storylines and characters." [...] Isler continued that while [...] "'Reciprocity'" [...] isn't the most groundbreaking episode in the series, it does try a number of new ideas, and it gives us one big new plot point that could change the tone {{of the rest of the}} season." ...|$|E

In spring 2012 the group, now renamed 'S Club Party' set out on a tour of Australia with other noughties' hit group, Big Brovaz. On 30 May 2012, S Club featured on Australia's Channel 7 The Morning Show, announcing they are in the country for a national tour from 23 May to 2 June 2012. Subsequent to this appearance, a video of the performance was uploaded to YouTube, where the reaction was largely negative with many viewers expressing the opinion that the performance was uncomfortable to watch, with the absence of the four other members of the original band causing some disillusionment among childhood fans of the group.|$|E
500|$|The {{design for}} Marceline {{was created by}} Ward, with small changes and {{additions}} added by Phil Rynda, former lead character and prop designer for Adventure Time. Visually, Marceline has long, dark hair. She rarely walks on the ground, generally preferring to float when she travels, moves, and sleeps. Marceline, unlike {{many of the other}} characters, wears varying outfits in most of her appearances. According to Ward, her clothing changes from episode to episode because [...] "girls own more than one outfit". Olson was impressed by her character's fashion design stating, [...] "she has really cool style [...] I love what <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> with [...] every episode." [...] Olson explained that when she goes in to record the voices for each episode, she is [...] "totally surprised" [...] by the costuming for Marceline. While she says her lines, she is able to view the animatics for the episode and sometimes has to stop to admire the unique designs. Marceline's physical size and shape slightly changes depending on who is drawing her. Rynda later called this [...] "one of the coolest parts" [...] about the character's animation {{due to the fact that}} [...] "every artist leaves a little bit of their own taste and sensibilities in what they draw." ...|$|E

While the couple discuss their relationship, Saddam interrupts and takes them hostage, with Celine having planned to sing at a Canadian football game. Scott has also become worried about the presence of the Iraqi soldiers in Canada, but becomes infuriated when he finds that Terrance and Phillip have returned to Canada safely. He confronts Saddam about the double-cross, but Saddam's armed guards scare him into backing away.

500|$|The Guardians Andrew Pulver {{was less}} enthusiastic, calling the film {{a mix of}} [...] "wafer-thin psychodrama" [...] and [...] "plot-generator dialogue". Times Richard Corliss said the action was let down by [...] "inert" [...] drama, {{describing}} the film as [...] "45 minutes of awesome encased in 90 minutes of yawnsome." [...] Justin Chang of Variety criticized it as loud and lacking the nuance and subtlety of del Toro's previous films. The New Yorkers Anthony Lane's verdict read as [...] "It is possible to applaud Pacific Rim for the efficacy of its business model while deploring the tale that has been engendered—long, loud, dark, and very wet. You might as well watch the birth of an elephant." [...] The San Francisco Chronicles Mike LaSalle reacted extremely negatively by stating [...] "If {{this is the best}} we can do in terms of movies—hoif something like this can speak to the soul of audiences—maybe we should just turn over the cameras and the equipment to the alien dinosaurs and see what <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> with… Director Guillermo del Toro, who gave us Pan's Labyrinth not too many years ago, used to be known as an artistic and discerning filmmaker, despite his affection for blockbuster action and grotesqueness. But too often he gets lost in his computer…Why go to the movies to look at somebody else's computer after looking at your own all week?… The actors can't make Pacific Rim any better. They can only relieve some of the pain." [...] Slant Magazines Ed Gonzalez, who said the film lacked poignancy, compared it to a video game: [...] "a stylish but programmatic ride toward an inevitable final boss battle". The Wraps Alonso Duralde criticized the choice to set most battles at night or during the rain, feeling it detracted from the action, and said the comic relief actors—Day, Gorman, and Perlman—stole the film from the less interesting leads. Jordan Hoffman of Film.com identified Hunnam as the weak link in the cast, calling him a [...] "charisma black hole". Giles Hardie of The Sydney Morning Herald was particularly critical of the film, awarding the action sequences [...] "five IQ points out of five" [...] as he described the film as an hour and twenty minutes of fight sequences vaguely connected by ten minutes of story.|$|E
