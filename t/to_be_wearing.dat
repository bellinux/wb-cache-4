5|$|Maroon: The university's {{official}} color {{used to be}} magenta, {{one which}} was shared by Harvard University. Since it was confusing for the two schools <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>wearing</b> the same color during athletic competitions, the matter of which school could lay claim to magenta was to be settled {{through a series of}} baseball games. Fordham won the games, but Harvard reneged on its promise. Both schools continued to use the color until 1874, when the Fordham student government unanimously agreed to change to maroon. Maroon was chosen because it was not widely used at the time. Sometime later, Harvard stopped using magenta in favor of crimson.|$|E

5|$|The next day, Fung {{is having}} tea {{in a public}} square {{surrounded}} by his subordinates. He sees a beautiful woman (Kwai's pregnant friend) having tea in the same square. As {{he tries to get}} her attention, a large group of children come asking him to buy charity stickers. The children place stickers on Fung and his men. The pregnant woman leaves the square and meets up with Costello, then tells him that the man back in the square with the most number of stickers is Fung. Costello thanks her, makes his way to the square and begins to shoot a great many of the guards as well as Fung as chaos ensues. However, Fung turns out <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>wearing</b> a bulletproof vest. His subordinates help him run away from Costello, who gives chase on foot. As Costello walks, he checks the bystanders for stickers, which tips Fung off to the fact that Costello does not actually recognize him, apart from the stickers he is wearing. Fung removes the stickers from his coat, and puts them on the jacket of a subordinate instead. This causes Costello to shoot Fung's subordinate. Fung then removes his coat with all the stickers and runs off.|$|E
25|$|Visibility {{to other}} skydivers and other {{aircraft}} {{is also a}} consideration; FAA regulations require skydivers jumping at night <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>wearing</b> a light visible for three miles (5km) in every direction, and {{to turn it on}} once they are under canopy. A chem-light(glowstick) is a good idea on a night jump.|$|E

25|$|Police {{shot and}} killed a Brazilian man, Jean Charles de Menezes, at Stockwell tube station shortly after 10:00 on 22 July. Officers had pursued de Menezes from a {{location}} under surveillance, believing him {{to be one of}} the men wanted for the attacks of the previous day. They apparently believed de Menezes, who was claimed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>wearing</b> a heavy jacket – later shown to be an ordinary denim jacket – was a possible suicide bomber.|$|E
25|$|On April 18, 2010, Abu Ayyub al-Masri {{was killed}} in a joint American and Iraqi {{operation}} near Tikrit. The coalition forces believed al-Masri <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>wearing</b> a suicide vest and proceeded cautiously. After the lengthy exchange of fire and bombing of the house, the Iraqi troops stormed inside and found two women still alive, one of whom was al-Masri's wife, and four dead men, identified as al-Masri, Abu Omar al-Baghdadi, and al-Baghdadi's son. A suicide vest was found on al-Masri's corpse, according to the Iraqi Army.|$|E

25|$|In late August, {{on behalf}} of the Bulgarian government, Interpol {{attempted}} to recruit the help of member nations to identify one of the suspects in the investigation, and posted on its website an image of the alleged accomplice, urging anyone who had information about his identity to notify the authorities. The posted images include a copy of the fake driver's license in which the suspect seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>wearing</b> a wig. Interpol described the suspect as having possible Middle Eastern origin, 1.70–1.75 meters tall, and dark brown hair and eyes, who speaks English with an accent.|$|E
25|$|Archaeological dissent {{from this}} view {{began with the}} work of Carlo Maria Rosini in 1797, to be {{followed}} by a succession of archaeologists putting forward evidence to the contrary, though mainstream scholarly opinion has long been in favour of August 24. Discussion on the subject has increased somewhat in recent years. Some of the archaeological evidence from Pompeii does suggest that the town may likely have been buried about two or three months later. For example, people interred in the ashes appear <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>wearing</b> warmer clothing than the light summer clothes that would be expected in August. The fresh fruit, olives, and vegetables in the shops are typical of October, and conversely the summer fruit that would have been typical of August was already being sold in dried, or conserved form. Wine fermenting jars had been sealed over, and this would have happened around the end of October. The coins found in the purse of a woman buried in the ash include a commemorative coin that should have been minted at the end of September.|$|E
25|$|Thomas Scally {{stated that}} {{he was sitting in}} Alley Pond Park on Winchester Boulevard, in the borough of Queens, at dusk with a female friend when a yellow Volkswagen Beetle {{approached}} his car door to door and only three inches apart from his vehicle, which did not have its engine running. Scally kept an air gun under his seat and, as the VW approached his car, the VW driver was met with the gun pointed straight at him. At first, he appeared to be a light-skinned black male, but he also appeared <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>wearing</b> a stocking over his face. The driver of the VW quickly started his car and gunned it in reverse out of the parking lot. Scally chased the car to a point in Glen Oaks, Queens, where the driver jumped out and ran. He did not want to leave his female passenger to give chase, so he telephoned the Son of Sam Hot Line. Detective Richard Carroll from the Son of Sam Task Force (and Scally's former baseball coach) later told Scally that he had indeed seen the Son of Sam. Glen Oaks was later revealed to be the home of Berkowitz's sister and was close {{to the site of the}} Donna DiMaise and Joanne LoMino shootings.|$|E

500|$|The Herb {{character}} was played by actor Jon Menick, who would randomly appear at Burger King restaurants nationwide. Herb's identity was not revealed until Super Bowl XX in January 1986; he was shown <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>wearing</b> white socks, black [...] "flood pants", and thick-rimmed glasses. If a customer spotted Herb at a Burger King, {{he or she}} would win $5,000.

500|$|Conversely, Robert Christgau and Rolling Stones David Browne found Flood to be {{unremarkable}} overall. Both critics chastised the band's novelty, {{which they}} found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>wearing</b> thin as time progressed. In the UK Caroline Sullivan of Melody Maker felt that enjoyment of Flood [...] "hinges upon one's general feelings about similarly zany characters like Talking Heads and Frank Zappa. If their very American, very beatnik, surrealism spells instant yawnorama, forget TMBG—they're the same thing, but minus the good tunes." [...] However, in a 2009 Rolling Stone article revisiting Flood near its twentieth anniversary, DX Ferris praised the album {{as both the}} band's most iconic release and one that revolutionized the college radio scene.|$|E
500|$|The paper began {{publication}} on September 3, 1923. [...] The tabloid-format {{newspaper was}} to be devoted to the ideal of clean journalism, and was prudish to an extreme: [...] women's skirts were retouched in photos {{so that they would}} appear to cover the wearer's knees, while photos of wrestlers were altered so that they would appear <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>wearing</b> gym shirts. Vanderbilt's rivals did not take well to the new competition—a graphic sex story was planted by saboteurs in the first edition, forcing Vanderbilt to stop the presses and redo page 2 before it was published. Up to a hundred Illustrated Daily News newsboys were treated at local hospitals each week after being assaulted.|$|E
500|$|Because the Slender Man's fictional [...] "mythology" [...] {{has evolved}} without an {{official}} [...] "canon" [...] for reference, his appearance, motives, habits, and abilities are not fixed, but change {{depending on the}} storyteller. He is most commonly described as very tall and thin with unnaturally long, tentacle-like arms (or merely tentacles), which he can extend to intimidate or capture prey. In most stories his face is white and featureless, but occasionally his face appears differently to anyone who sees it. He appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>wearing</b> a dark suit and tie. The Slender Man {{is often associated with}} the forest and/or abandoned locations and has the ability to teleport. Proximity to the Slender Man is often said to trigger a [...] "Slender sickness"; a rapid onset of paranoia, nightmares and delusions accompanied by nosebleeds.|$|E
