Some slaves were freed by manumission for services rendered, {{or through a}} <b>testamentary</b> <b>provision</b> when their master died. Once free, they faced few barriers, beyond normal social snobbery, to participating in Roman society. The principle that a person could become a citizen by law rather than birth was enshrined in Roman mythology; when Romulus defeated the Sabines in battle, he promised the war captives that were in Rome they could become citizens.|$|E
50|$|The {{import of}} this story is, that young John William Friso's claim to the title of Prince of Orange was contested during the crucial years {{immediately}} following William III's death, thereby depriving him of {{an important source of}} prestige and power. He already was stadtholder of Friesland and Groningen, as this office had been made hereditary in 1675 and he had succeeded his father Henry Casimir II, Prince of Nassau-Dietz in 1696, be it under the regency of his mother, as he was only nine at the time. He now hoped to inherit the office in Holland and Zeeland also, especially as William III had groomed him for the office, and had made him his political heir, and the office was hereditary. However, that provision had been contingent on a natural male heir for William III. The Holland regents did not feel bound by a <b>testamentary</b> <b>provision.</b>|$|E
5000|$|This {{legal status}} was also invented to {{circumvent}} the Statute of Mortmain. That statute was intended to end the relatively common practice of leaving real property to the Church {{at the time of}} the owner's death. Two conceptualizations, not mutually exclusive, of the term mortmain ("dead hand") of the term explain its origin(s): First, the [...] "dead hand" [...] may be characterized as that of the deceased donor and former owner to whose desire, as embodied in the <b>testamentary</b> <b>provision</b> that the Church hold title to the property, remained subject. Second, because the Church as a nonnatural person recognized at common law never died, the land never left the [...] "dead hand" [...] or, more accurately, the nonliving hand of the Church. Before the Statute of Mortmain, large amounts of land were bequeathed to the Church, which never relinquished it. This legal arrangement was in contradistinction to others in which the land could be transferred to anyone, inherited only through a family line (sometimes sex-specific), or revert to a lord or the Crown upon death of the tenant. Church land had been a source of contention between the Crown and the Church for centuries. Cestui que use allowed religious orders to inhabit land, while the title resided with a corporation of lawyers or other entities, who nominally had no relation to the Church.|$|E

50|$|The {{manner in}} which assets are {{distributed}} depends on whether the deceased has left a valid will or other valid document containing <b>testamentary</b> <b>provisions,</b> such as an antenuptial contract. If the deceased has not left a valid will or valid document containing <b>testamentary</b> <b>provisions,</b> the deceased dies intestate; similarly, if the deceased leaves a valid will which does not dispose of all property, there is an intestacy as to the portion not disposed of. In the event of intestacy, the assets are distributed in a definite order of preference among the heirs, as stipulated by the Intestate Succession Act. Until recently, the Act (and its common-law precursor) existed side-by-side with a statutorily-regulated customary-law regime of intestate succession, applied on a racial basis, but this was brought to an end when the Constitutional Court, in Bhe v Magistrate, Khayelitsha, made the Intestate Succession Act applicable to all.|$|R

The {{issue of whether or not}} section 2A can be applied in circumstances where the testator revokes a portion of his or her will and simultaneously introduces new <b>testamentary</b> <b>provisions</b> in place of the revoked provisions is problematic.|$|R
40|$|The current Civil Code in force, {{unlike the}} {{previous}} one, succeeds into making {{a clear and}} natural distinction between will – as a whole – and legacy – as the main <b>testamentary</b> <b>provision.</b> Unfortunately, it does not also provide flawless regulations {{in terms of the}} categories of legacies, which are classified according to their object (universal legacies, legacies by universal title, legacies by particular title). In what the legacy by universal title is concerned, the Civil Code in force contains some controversial provisions at article 1056 paragraph (2) letter c), which interfere also with the correct qualification of legacy by particular title. Then, the regulations of the legal regime applicable to the legatee by particular title also evince flaws, for instance at article 1114 article (3) letter b) of the Civil Code, so that it becomes more and more difficult to qualify certain legacies, as being by particular or by universal title. The current work aims to point out the provisions of the Civil Code mentioned before, which generate or can generate potential controversies, but also to propose certain remedies...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{develops}} the main issues {{raised in the}} practical application regarding the burden. The first part men faced {{the thought of the}} doctrine and jurisprudence regarding the burden placed on the donation and testament, with particular regard to the problem {{of the nature of the}} burden. The second part deals with defining the meaning of «any interested person» (art. 648 c. c.), because this is important to determine, in the silence of the law, which is the structure of the burden. In the third chapter deals with the issue of discipline applicable burden from different points of view: the responsibility of burden, the impossibility or illegality of the burden (art. 647, paragraph 3, c. c.), the resolution of the <b>testamentary</b> <b>provision</b> in case of nonperformance of the burden and the identification of a criterion how to distinguish from other figures related to it, as the condition, the legacy or the mandate post mortem. The thesis aims to demonstrate that the burden takes on different characteristics depending on whether it is included into a donation or in a will. This circumstance suggests separate discussion of two figures of burden and will be developed in this thesis the main issues regarding testamentary burden. The central issue is constituted by the determination of the accidental, incidental or self-burden, which is closely related, in general, with the understanding of the inheritance system and, in particular, with the definition of a will. The theme of the chapter fifth chapter is whether the burden could constitute a means of introducing in the will a prohibition against alienation or a binding of destination on a property for the fulfillment of a certain purpose. ...|$|E

50|$|Emily {{was treated}} generously {{in her first}} husband's will. He left her a {{jointure}} of 4,000 pounds annually (increased from the 3,000 promised in the settlement), and a life interest in Leinster House (Dublin) and Carton (which she exchanged for Frescati House and 40,000 pounds) together with all their contents. She had brought the usual ducal daughter's dowry of 10,000 pounds, so the jointure and other payments would cripple her son the 2nd Duke of Leinster financially. The 1st Duke also made over-generous provisions for his younger sons and all his daughters. Emily, Duchess of Leinster and her second husband, also received the usual annuity of 400 pounds annually {{for each of the}} minor children who lived with her. Thus, Emily and William Ogilvie were probably financially better off than the 2nd Duke, who existed on less than 7,000 pounds annually out of which he had to run two large houses, play a role in Irish politics, and also provide lavish dowries of 10,000 each for three sisters who married. He also had to pay huge annuities (2,000 each) to the next youngest brothers Lord Lecale and Lord Henry Fitzgerald, and to pay the youngest brothers 10,000 each at their majority. Since Emily lived to 1814 (outliving the 2nd Duke by ten years), all these generous <b>testamentary</b> <b>provisions,</b> along with the huge building costs incurred by the 1st Duke, crippled the Leinsters for generations.|$|R
40|$|This {{contribution}} {{draws on}} critical race theory and critical legal theory {{in order to}} read and critique the Supreme Court of Appeal judgment of Erasmus AJA in BoE Trust Limited 2013 3 SA 236 (SCA). It will specifically focus on the contested jurisprudential and racial politics reflected in the reasoning followed in the judgement. It specifically takes issue with {{the way in which}} the judge avoided dealing directly with the constitutional and political implications of racially-exclusive <b>testamentary</b> <b>provisions.</b> Three specific features of the judgment are highlighted in the note as problematic: first, the rhetorical moves and ‘legal interpretive techniques’ by which the judge escaped the basic legal texts governing the situation in which a racially discriminatory provision is included in a will, as well as the substantive reasoning and normative choices that those texts necessarily invite. Secondly, how the escape from those legal texts evinces, or perhaps even facilitated, a certain evasion of, or anxiety towards the horizontal application of the Bill of Rights which explicitly proscribes overt (racial) discrimination by private non-state actors. And thirdly, how by following a formalist legal approach, one in which the basic assumptions of liberal legalism and capitalism are viewed as natural, normal and immutable, the judgment lacks a decisive rejection of racism. The judgment’s uncritical adulation of the common law of succession (and specifically the principle of freedom of testation) and its negation of a more substantive, constitutionally-infused mode of reasoning and adjudication generally reflects a conservative or traditional view of law. It is suggested that this view of law is problematic in our current post-apartheid context for two central reasons: it stands in tension with the project of transformative constitutionalism and prevents the coming into being of a more critical race jurisprudence for postapartheid South Africa...|$|R
40|$|With {{the growing}} {{belief in the}} reality of purgatory in medieval times, the hope was also rising of the {{salvation}} of the souls dwelling in that abode. By the fourteenth century the concept of purgatory had already been developed, and prayers, services and charitable acts came {{to be regarded as}} the most efficient aid to the souls of the dead. The hopes that people coping with the imminence of death placed in the effectiveness of prayers and masses pro remedio animae, and the belief in the existence of purgatory will be discussed by using the example of Kotor {{in the first half of}} the fourteenth century, on the basis of wall-paintings and wills. In the first decades of the fourteenth century the souls of the dead were depicted in the scene of the General Resurrection included in the Crucifixion painted in the apse of the Collegiata of St Mary at Kotor. In the context of eucharistic and soteriological symbolism of the iconographic programme of the apse, the motif of the General Resurrection - the souls of the dead depicted as babies that, wrapped in swaddling clothes, emerge from their sarcophagi explicitly expresses the idea of supplication. But the people's concern with the effectiveness of prayers for the deliverance of souls from purgatory is fully confirmed by the surviving wills dating to the 1320 s and 1330 s. Every citizen of Kotor could order in his will that masses, commemoration services and prayers for the salvation of his soul and the souls of his ancestors should be offered. The number and solemnity of the masses and prayers depended on the amount of money a person was able to set aside for that purpose. The imminence of death, timens mori, made people think of repentance. Still, the conventional formulae of <b>testamentary</b> <b>provisions</b> for pias causas reveal a genuine fear that death may catch them unprepared, i. e. with no charitable acts, with no repentance and, especially, with no insurance that their souls will be delivered from purgatory through masses and prayers...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (LL. M. (Estate Law)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2007 Freedom of testation is {{recognised}} {{as one of}} {{the founding}} principles of the South African law of estate succession. According to this principle, testators are free to dispose of their assets in a will in any manner they deem fit. Effect will not be given to <b>testamentary</b> <b>provisions</b> if compliance with such provisions are contra bonos mores or against public policy. Certain limitations in freedom of testation in selected common law and civil law legal systems exist. Since the enactment and commencement of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa 1996, it became important to determine whether the Constitution and particularly the Bill of Rights constitute any additional limitations on freedom of testation. This study investigates this question with particular reference to the so-called testamentary faith and race clauses. The pre- 1996 position is discussed in chapter 2 of this study. The case of Aronson v Estate Hart 1950 1 SA 539 (A) is the locus classicus as for testamentary faith and race clauses. The conclusion in this case was that testamentary faith and race clauses before the commencement of the Constitution were not contrary to public policy and consequently not invalid. In chapter 3 of this study, the position after the post- 1996 position is discussed. The Constitution is the supreme law of the Republic; law or conduct inconsistent with it is invalid, and the obligations imposed by it must be fulfilled. The question passed {{is whether or not the}} provisions of the Constitution amend the current legal position regarding testamentaly faith and race clauses, even though the Constitution is the supreme law of the Republic? Attention is drawn to the enforcement of the Constitution and relevant provisions of the Constitution. This study, inter alia, investigated the right to equality, the right to freedom of conscience, religion thought, belief and opinion, the right to human dignity and the general limitation clause. In the light of the purpose and aim of testamentary faith and race clauses, it seems likely that the right to human dignity, equality and religion as espoused in the Constitution, may be violated. Following the enactment of the Constitution, a testamentary faith and race clause may be contra bonos mores and accordingly invalid. Chapter 4 of this study recommends that a testator who wants to favour his religion should utilise other methods than testamentary faith and race clauses to favour his or her religion. For example, to place certain assets in a trust for his beneficiaries. This may ensure the protection of the rights of all people including the beneficiary. Master...|$|R
