60|$|His {{particular}} work {{upon the}} intimate constitution of matter had broadened very rapidly in his hands. The drift {{of his work}} had been to identify all colloids as liquid solutions of variable degrees of viscosity, and to treat crystalline bodies as the only solids. He had dealt with oscillating processes in colloid bodies with especial reference to living matter. He had passed from {{a study of the}} melting and <b>toughening</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> to the molecular structure of a number of elastic bodies, and so, by a characteristic leap into botanical physiology, to the states of resinous and gummy substances at the moment of secretion. He worked at first upon a false start, and then resumed to discover a growing illumination. He found himself in the presence of phenomena that seemed to him to lie near the still undiscovered threshold to the secret processes of living protoplasm. He was, as it were, breaking into biology by way of molecular physics. He spent many long nights of deep excitement, calculating and arranging the development of these seductive intimations. It was this work which his marriage had interrupted, and to which he was now returning.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Civil Engineering) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2007. The {{introduction}} <b>of</b> <b>toughened</b> <b>glass</b> {{into the}} construction industry has had several significant consequences. For the first time, glass panels can be used without continuous edge supports, {{and as a result}} can be used as load-bearing element. An excellent and very common example of the use <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> as structural element is a freestanding glass balustrade. During an undergraduate investigation, a number of impact tests were performed on continuous supported freestanding glass balustrade panels at the University of Stellenbosch [6]. It was observed that none of the balustrade panels complied with the guidelines for impact loading stipulated in the SABS [7] loading standards. The failure to meet the loading requirements highlighted the need to investigate the design <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> balustrades. This thesis describes the investigation undertaken to determine the static- and dynamic loading capacity <b>of</b> freestanding <b>glass</b> balustrades. Following a review of South African and international design standards, the static- and dynamic material properties <b>of</b> <b>toughened</b> <b>glass</b> was established by means of a laboratory test series. The laboratory test series consisted of both a destructive laboratory test series and finite element analysis, the outcome of which determined the static- and dynamic material properties <b>of</b> <b>toughened</b> <b>glass.</b> The series also included the influence of different connection types. A second phase employed the identified material properties <b>of</b> <b>toughened</b> <b>glass</b> to determine the loading capacity of full-scale balustrades. Using finite elements each balustrade set-up was loaded as required by the relevant South African loading standards. The finite element analyses identified which balustrade set-ups could resist the required imposed loads. Finally, a second laboratory test series was undertaken, the aim of which was to verify the finite element results. The successful resistance of the tested balustrade set-ups confirmed the finite element model. Recommendation to the existing design- and loading standards are made {{based on the results of}} the thesis...|$|R

Harmonic analysis theories and the principles of statistical analysis are applied in this finding. Both new and aged insulators are tested for harmonic components with a 240 Vrms AC voltage input.

The new and aged toughened glass insulators' power spectrums are compared to obtain the desired result. The level of confidence for the obtained result is determined by using statistical analysis. It is found that the fundamental, third, fifth and seventh harmonic components have positive results (i. e. the power consumed by these harmonic components increases with the age <b>of</b> the <b>toughened</b> <b>glass</b> insulator).

50|$|The second unusual {{property}} of the drops, namely {{the strength of the}} head, is a direct consequence of large compressive residual stresses—up to —that exist {{in the vicinity of the}} head's outer surface. This stress distribution is measured by using glass' natural {{property of}} stress-induced birefringence and by employing techniques of 3D photoelasticity. The high fracture toughness due to residual compressive stresses makes Prince Rupert's drops one of the earliest examples <b>of</b> <b>toughened</b> <b>glass.</b>|$|R

Liquid monomer is poured between two flat sheets <b>of</b> <b>toughened</b> <b>glass</b> sealed with a rubber gasket and heated for polymerization. Because the glass sheets may contain surface scratches or sag during the process, this traditional method has some disadvantages: among other problems, the PMMA sheets may contain variations in thickness and surface defects.

50|$|Early {{windshields}} {{were made}} <b>of</b> ordinary window <b>glass,</b> {{but that could}} lead to serious injuries {{in the event of a}} crash. A series of crashes led up to the development of stronger windshields. The most notable example of this is the Pane vs. Ford case of 1917 that decided against Pane in that he was only injured through reckless driving. They were replaced with windshields made <b>of</b> <b>toughened</b> <b>glass</b> and were fitted in the frame using a rubber or neoprene seal. The hardened glass shattered into many mostly harmless fragments when the windshield broke. These windshields, hovever, could shatter from a simple stone chip. In 1919, Henry Ford solved the problem of flying debris by using the new French technology <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> laminating. Windshields made using this process were two layers <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> with a cellulose inner layer. This inner layer held the glass together when it fractured. Between 1919 and 1929, Ford ordered the use <b>of</b> laminated <b>glass</b> on all <b>of</b> his vehicles.|$|R
50|$|The {{process for}} the {{production}} <b>of</b> <b>toughened</b> <b>glass</b> by quenching was probably inspired by {{the study of the}} drops, as it was patented in England by Parisian Francois Barthelemy Alfred Royer de la Bastie, in 1874, just one year after V. De Luynes had published accounts of his experiments with them. It has been known since at least the 19th century that formations similar to Prince Rupert's Drops are produced under certain conditions in volcanic lava. More recently researchers at the University of Bristol and the University of Iceland have studied the glass particles produced by explosive fragmentation of Prince Rupert's drops in the laboratory to better understand magma fragmentation and ash formation driven by stored thermal stresses in active volcanoes.|$|R

The roof is supported by masonry walls with round-headed windows alongside platforms 1 and 12 and rows of cast iron columns. The roof spans have wrought iron trusses with cast iron struts on girders between the columns. The original roof was covered with slates with some glazing.

40|$|The {{possibility}} <b>of</b> <b>toughening</b> <b>glass</b> and ceramics by {{addition of}} a piezoelectric particulate secondary phase {{is the focus of}} current research. It is hypothesised that stress concentrations at the tip of an advancing crack can re-orient piezoelectric domains within the reinforcement {{in the direction of the}} stress field around the crack, thus dissipating energy which contribute to fracture toughness increment of the composite. Previous work has focussed on producing glass/piezoelectric inclusion composites by conventional sintering. This process is accompanied by extended porosity formation, as well as Pb depletion in the PZT phase. In several cases, the long processing times required to fully sinter the glass matrix lead to glass-PZT reactions and to loosing the stoichiometry of the PZT inclusions. In this study, the novel production <b>of</b> new <b>glass</b> matrix composites reinforced with piezoelectric inclusions by using microwave heating was investigated. Specifically, lead-zirconate-titanate (PZT) particles in lead silicate and borosilicate glass matrices were considered. Mixtures <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> and PZT powders were prepared and used to fabricate powder compacts by uniaxial cold-pressing. In order to achieve densification, the compacts were subsequently heated in a single mode applicator, connected to a generator operating at the 2. 45 GHz ISM frequency. ...|$|R
40|$|High-strength all-ceramic {{systems for}} fixed partial {{dentures}} (FPDs) is gaining popularity {{as an alternative}} to the well established metal-ceramic FPDs. Several new framework materials and technique such as lithium disilicate, aluminum oxide and yttrium tetragonal zirconia polycrystal have been developed with improved strength, marginal discrepancy and esthetics. Since not every all-ceramic system can be used for a variety application, proper selection of the materials is an important for the success of all-ceramic FPDs. The longevity of dental restorations is an important health concern and the clinician placed great emphasis on mechanical properties to define the clinical indication of the ceramic materials because of their brittleness and low fracture toughness. The stronger and tougher framework material would improve the reliability and the longevity of dental restoration. To fabricated of an all-ceramic FPDs, material would be required with a flexural strength in excess of 300 MPa and fracture toughness 3 MPa/m ½. Zirconium has a better mechanical properties than alumina and lithium disilicate glass-ceramic, result from the transformation <b>toughening,</b> free <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> phase and minimal flaws. Whereas lithium disilicate glass-ceramic has a better translucency than alumina and zirconium based ceramic, result from the higher content <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> phase than that two materials.

It can be concluded that the all-ceramic FPDs are seems to be an acceptable clinically prosthodontic treatment according to the short-term studies and the lithium disilicate and alumina-based ceramic materials are acceptable for 3 units anterior FPDs, whereas zirconia-based ceramic are acceptable for 3 – 5 units anterior and posterior FPDs with 2 pontics. However, further investigation and more clinical long-term follow-up studies are needed. </span...|$|R

The FDS model was employed to simulate one of the experimental tests and further used to study the effect of fire sources and cavity depths. Numerical modellings show good agreement when comparing the modelled temperatures with the measured temperatures next to the internal skins and external skins. For fully-developed fires in the modelling scenarios, the fire and smoke plume hit the external panes without any attaching to the internal panes. The fire and smoke plume could break the external skin but the internal skins are safe at low temperatures...|$|R

40|$|<b>Toughening</b> <b>of</b> epoxy with {{different}} types of modifiers produces a bimodal blend that might show better fracture resistance in comparison with single-modified ones. In this research, bimodal epoxy formulations including mixtures <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> microsphere and silica nanoparticles are explored for possible synergistic <b>toughening.</b> The influence <b>of</b> composition on the glass transition temperature (T-g), tensile characteristics, and fracture toughness (K-IC) is investigated. Interestingly, a synergism in fracture toughness is observed when mixtures of modifiers were incorporated. For the fixed overall modifier content, K-IC is higher when the volume fraction <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> microsphere is lesser than the volume fraction of nanosilica. Fractographs reveal that glass microsphere increases the toughness of epoxy matrix by crack pinning/bridging mechanisms. On the other hand, nanosilica enhances the toughness by increase in plastic deformation via shear banding/particle debonding. Interestingly, the origin of synergistic toughness in bimodal epoxies is {{the interaction between the}} glass microsphere and crack-tip damage zone which provides comprehensive stable crack deflection within the nanosilica-toughened epoxy. This mechanism results in a mixed-mode crack growth that reduces the strain energy release rate in bimodal formulations...|$|R
