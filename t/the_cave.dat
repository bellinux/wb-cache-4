5|$|A {{man from}} Glastonbury {{is engaged to}} a girl from Wookey. A witch living in Wookey Hole Caves curses the romance so that it fails. The man, now a monk, seeks revenge on this witch who—having been jilted herself—frequently spoils budding relationships. The monk stalks the witch into <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> and she hides in a dark corner {{near one of the}} {{underground}} rivers. The monk blesses the water and splashes some of it at the dark parts of <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> where the witch was hiding. The blessed water immediately petrifies the witch, and she remains in <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> to this day.|$|E
5|$|At about 10:30, Rybka {{launched}} a frontal attack across the Unac supported {{by at least}} one MG42 machine gun firing into the mouth of <b>the</b> <b>cave.</b> The Germans reached the base of the hill, fifty metres from <b>the</b> <b>cave,</b> but suffered severe casualties in the assault. They were also running low on water. Prior to this attack, Tito and around 20 staff had taken refuge in <b>the</b> <b>cave.</b>|$|E
5|$|In December 1872, Colonel George Crook used Apache scouts {{to find a}} cave in Salt River Canyon {{that was}} being used by Guwevkabaya to mount attacks on White settlers. On December 28, {{accompanied}} by 100 Pima scouts, Captain William Brown led 120 of Crook's men to a siege of <b>the</b> <b>cave.</b> 110 Kwevkepaya were trapped in <b>the</b> <b>cave,</b> when Brown ordered the soldiers to fire at the roof of <b>the</b> <b>cave,</b> causing rock fragments and lead shrapnel to rain down on the Guwevkabaya. Having nowhere else to go, the besieged gathered around the mouth of <b>the</b> <b>cave,</b> where soldiers (accompanied by Crook) pushed boulders onto them from above, killing 76 of the group. The survivors were taken to Camp Grant as prisoners. The Yavapai were so demoralized by this and other actions by Crook that they surrendered at Camp Verde (renamed Fort McDowell), on April 6, 1873. In 1925, a group of Yavapai from the Fort McDowell Reservation, along with a Maricopa County Sheriff, collected the bones from <b>the</b> <b>cave,</b> and interred them at the Fort McDowell cemetery.|$|E

5|$|On November 16, 2011, the {{production}} received a fine (between $343–$3,440) from the Bulgarian {{environmental protection agency}} for unlawfully removing shrubs and small trees from the entrance of Devetashka Cave. Although permits had been obtained allowing sets {{to be built in}} the area (including a bridge to <b>the</b> <b>cave),</b> environmentalists complained that filming could damage <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> (home to about 40 endangered species). To avoid further problems, the producers agreed not to film explosions, car chases and fires near <b>the</b> <b>cave.</b>|$|E
5|$|Several {{sets were}} {{rendered}} digitally, {{and almost all}} of the sets had some form of digital enhancement. The largest digital environment was the Devetashka cave, which had to be digitally recreated because of the environmental concerns of filming explosions in the real cave. Using over 5,000 photographs taken at different times of day, <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> was accurately illuminated and rendered down to crevices and moss. The cave's interior containing a concealed nuclear vault was subjected to several changes up to two months before the effects' delivery date based on editorial input, including modifications to its scale. The railcar used within <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> was also digitally built alongside a practical version, but the digital versions versatility saw it largely replace its practical counterpart. The scene featuring the Expendables and prisoners trapped in <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> were shot entirely on Chroma key with <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> background inserted later.|$|E
5|$|The Badami cave temples are {{carved out}} of soft Badami {{sandstone}} on a hill cliff. The plan {{of each of the}} four caves (1 to 4) includes an entrance with a verandah (mukha mandapa) supported by stone columns and brackets, a distinctive feature of these caves, leading to a columned mandapa, or main hall (also maha mandapa), and then to the small, square shrine (sanctum sanctorum, garbha ghriya) cut deep inside <b>the</b> <b>cave.</b> <b>The</b> <b>cave</b> temples are linked by a stepped path with intermediate terraces overlooking the town and lake. <b>The</b> <b>cave</b> temples are labelled 1–4 in their ascending series; this numbering does not reflect the sequence of excavation.|$|E

5|$|After hatching, {{the larvae}} spend another 72 hours absorb their yolk sacs and {{developing}} their fins {{before they become}} free-swimming fry. The fry forage during daylight in a dense school and return to <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> or crevice for the night. Like other cichlids, the parents retrieve their young just before dark, sucking up three or four {{at a time and}} delivering them into the nest. The parents anticipate night, using a sense of time; in laboratory experiments convict cichlids continued to retrieve young as night approached {{even in the absence of}} any signal, such as dimming light. During the night, the fry bunch up at the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> or nest, where the parents fan them.|$|E

5|$|Neither Burch nor Smith {{had owned}} <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> or {{the land around}} it, which belonged to the public. Beginning in the 1890s, the Federal {{government}} began regulating {{the use of public}} lands like these. In 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt designated millions of acres of forest lands for protection, including what became Siskiyou National Forest, which surrounds <b>the</b> <b>cave.</b> The USFS was created in 1905 to manage these reserves. Three years later, Congress passed the Antiquities Act, which allowed the President to designate protected areas called National Monuments on public lands. In 1909, President William Howard Taft established Oregon Caves National Monument, to be managed by the USFS. A year later the USFS employed men to guard <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> and to serve as tour guides.|$|E
5|$|Only a {{few people}} visited <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> during the next decade. Among them was Thomas Condon, {{professor}} of geology at the University of Oregon. Guided by Davidson's brother, in 1884 he {{and a group of}} students hiked from Williams to the cavern, which they inspected by candlelight. Shortly thereafter, Walter Burch, an acquaintance of the Davidson family, tried to develop <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> as a business. Burch and his partners opened what they called Limestone Caves and charged visitors $1 each for a guided cave trip, a camping spot, pasture for horses, and cave water they described as medicinal. Although Burch and others hacked crude trails to <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> from Cave Junction and Williams, the trip was too difficult for most tourists, and Limestone Caves ceased operations in 1888.|$|E

5|$|Oregon Caves is a solutional cave, with {{passages}} totaling about , {{formed in}} marble.

Although the limestone formed about 190million years ago, <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> itself is no older than a few million years. Valued as a tourist cave, the cavern also has scientific value; sections of <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> that are not on tour routes contain fossils of national importance.|$|E
5|$|Runoff {{from the}} heavily wooded {{monument}} forms small headwater streams of the Illinois River, a major {{tributary of the}} Rogue River. One of five small springs in the monument becomes Upper Cave Creek, which flows on the surface before disappearing into its bed and entering <b>the</b> <b>cave.</b> Supplemented by water entering <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> from above, the stream emerges from the main entrance as Cave Creek. Within <b>the</b> <b>cave,</b> Cave Creek {{is known as the}} River Styx, named for the river Styx of Greek mythology connecting Earth to the Underworld. In late 2014, Congress added the River Styx to the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System, which added a level of protection aimed at keeping the stream free-flowing in perpetuity.
