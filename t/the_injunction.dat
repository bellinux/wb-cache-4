5|$|In April 2013, Nokia {{was granted}} a {{preliminary}} injunction in the Netherlands against STMicroelectronics, which had supplied HTC with microphone components for the device that contained Nokia’s proprietary technology. Despite <b>the</b> <b>injunction</b> being against STM, Nokia still used <b>the</b> <b>injunction</b> to publicly accuse HTC of copying technology from its products. HTC would {{still be able to}} use the remaining microphones it acquired in good faith; the offending component was replaced with an alternative version in future production runs.|$|E

50|$|Many of <b>the</b> <b>injunctions</b> came as {{a result}} of consent decrees entered into between inmates and prison {{officials}} and endorsed by federal courts so relief was not necessarily tied to violations found. Many state officials and members of Congress had complained of the breadth of relief granted by federal judges, as <b>the</b> <b>injunctions</b> often required expensive remedial actions.|$|R

5|$|On 15 July, {{less than}} twelve {{hours before the}} book went on sale in the Eastern time zone, Raincoast warned The Globe and Mail {{newspaper}} that publishing a review from a Canada-based writer at midnight, as the paper had promised, {{would be seen as}} a violation of the trade secret injunction. <b>The</b> <b>injunction</b> sparked a number of news articles alleging that <b>the</b> <b>injunction</b> had restricted fundamental rights. Canadian law professor Michael Geist posted commentary on his blog; Richard Stallman called for a boycott, requesting the publisher issue an apology. The Globe and Mail published a review from two UK-based writers in its 16 July edition and posted the Canadian writer's review on its website at 9:00 that morning. Commentary was also provided on the Raincoast website.|$|E
5|$|The US federal {{government}} intervened, obtaining an injunction against the strike {{on the theory}} that the strikers had obstructed the US Mail, carried on Pullman cars, by refusing to show up for work. President Grover Cleveland, who Debs had supported in all three of his presidential campaigns, sent the United States Army to enforce <b>the</b> <b>injunction.</b> The entrance of the Army was enough to break the strike. Overall, 30 strikers were killed in the strike, 13 of them in Chicago, and thousands were blacklisted. An estimated $80 million worth of property was damaged, and Debs was found guilty of contempt of court for violating <b>the</b> <b>injunction</b> and sent to federal prison.|$|E

5000|$|Furthermore, the Second Circuit {{held that}} <b>the</b> trial court's <b>injunctions</b> {{did not violate}} Argentina's {{sovereign}} immunity because they merely enforced the prohibition against both formal and informal subordination of {{any part of the}} debt to any other debt: [...] "They do not attach, arrest, or execute upon any property .... <b>the</b> <b>Injunctions</b> do not require Argentina to pay any bondholder any amount of money; nor do they limit the other uses to which Argentina may put its fiscal reserves. In other words, <b>the</b> <b>Injunctions</b> do not transfer any dominion or control over sovereign property to the court." ...|$|R
5|$|During the {{petition}} drive, national organizations {{on both the}} gun rights and gun control sides became involved by providing mailings and donations. Once {{the petition}}s were submitted, Morse and Giron challenged the effort in court, but were denied <b>the</b> <b>injunction</b> that they had requested from the court. A further court hearing resulted in the election being conducted in-person rather than by mail, which also led to Giron complaining of voter suppression.|$|E
5|$|On July 1, 1922, 400,000 {{railroad}} workers went on strike. Harding {{proposed a}} settlement that made some concessions, but management objected. Attorney General Daugherty convinced Judge James H. Wilkerson {{to issue a}} sweeping injunction {{to break up the}} strike. Although there was public support for the Wilkerson injunction, Harding felt it went too far, and had Daugherty and Wilkerson amend it. <b>The</b> <b>injunction</b> succeeded in ending the strike; however, tensions remained high between railroad workers and management for years.|$|E
5|$|While Reich was in Arizona in May 1956, {{one of his}} {{associates}} sent an accumulator part through the mail to another state, in violation of <b>the</b> <b>injunction,</b> after an FDA inspector posing as a customer requested it. Reich and another associate, Dr. Michael Silvert, were charged with contempt of court; Silvert had been looking after the inventory in Reich's absence. Reich at first refused to attend court, and was arrested and held for two days until a supporter posted bail of $30,000.|$|E
50|$|In {{the matter}} of {{granting}} this preliminary <b>injunction,</b> <b>the</b> Court cited Section 13(b) of the FTC Act.

50|$|For {{a double}} bind to be effective, the subject must {{be unable to}} confront or resolve the {{conflict}} between the demand placed by <b>the</b> primary <b>injunction</b> and that of <b>the</b> secondary <b>injunction.</b> In this sense, the double bind differentiates itself from a simple contradiction to a more inexpressible internal conflict, where the subject really wants {{to meet the demands of}} <b>the</b> primary <b>injunction,</b> but fails each time through an inability to address the situation's incompatibility with the demands of <b>the</b> secondary <b>injunction.</b> Thus, subjects may express feelings of extreme anxiety in such a situation, as they attempt to fulfil the demands of <b>the</b> primary <b>injunction</b> albeit with obvious contradictions in their actions.|$|R

5|$|From the {{examples}} of her mother, Aunt Sally, and a neighbor neglected by her husband and left destitute, Stone early learned that women were {{at the mercy of}} their husbands’ good will. When she came across the biblical passage, “and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee,” she was distraught over what appeared to be divine sanction of women’s subjugation, but then reasoned that <b>the</b> <b>injunction</b> applied only to wives. Resolving to “call no man my master,” she determined to keep control over her own life by never marrying, obtaining the highest education she could, and earning her own livelihood.|$|E
5|$|Mentzer and Mohan {{also wrote}} {{a series of}} generic RPG {{adventure}}s called Gary Gygax Presents Fantasy Master. They also began working on a third line of products, which began with an adventure written by Mentzer called The Convert (1987); Mentzer had written the adventure as an RPGA tournament for D, but TSR {{was not interested in}} publishing it. Mentzer got verbal permission to publish it with New Infinities, but since the permission was not in writing TSR filed an injunction to prevent the adventure's sale, although <b>the</b> <b>injunction</b> was later lifted.

5|$|On February 26, 2016, Media General {{obtained}} a preliminary injunction against Gray {{for violating the}} SSA and JSA, which required that Gray return control of WAGT to Media General, and forbade Gray from selling WAGT in the spectrum incentive auction. The company accused Gray of using the spectrum auction and sale of the station to exit the agreements illegitimately, as they were to last through 2020, and apply to any future owner of WAGT. Gray attempted to block <b>the</b> <b>injunction</b> by arguing that its actions were {{required in order to}} comply with the FCC's prohibition of joint sales agreements, but was denied. Media General took back control of WAGT on March 7, 2016.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> Mareva <b>injunction</b> {{has been}} {{available}} in England for 40 years. Initially, <b>the</b> Mareva <b>injunction</b> was a contentious form of relief; today it is regarded as an exceptionally effective device in common law jurisdictions across the globe. This body of work critically appraises the development, evolution and effectiveness of <b>the</b> Mareva <b>injunction.</b> It is primarily established that <b>the</b> Mareva <b>injunction</b> is an equitable remedy. A corollary crystallises; {{in order to gain}} a fuller understanding of <b>the</b> Mareva <b>injunction</b> it is necessary to contextualise it within the equitable jurisdiction. Traditional doctrinal research methods explicate the development of the equitable jurisdiction drawing attention to certain characteristics, common themes, techniques and principles. Equity becomes the contextual framework upon which the ensuing discourse is rendered. At its heart equity is found to be about remedies; a supplementary system which repairs defects in the law. <b>The</b> Mareva <b>injunction</b> was devised to ring fence amenable assets on a temporary basis; to protect the possibility of an effective remedy. The continuing effectiveness of <b>the</b> Mareva <b>injunction</b> is examined in relation to evolving externalities such as the rise of globalisation inclusive of developing financial infrastructures and improving technologies. The action taken by the courts to overcome the difficulties presented by the abovementioned evolving conditions are evaluated. The range of ancillary and connected orders of the court which have been created or refined {{in order to ensure that}} <b>the</b> Mareva <b>injunction</b> remains effective are critically appraised. It is argued that <b>the</b> Mareva <b>injunction</b> can no longer be viewed in isolation; it is part of an evolving matrix of interconnected devices which characterise the modern Mareva jurisdiction...|$|R

5|$|The Church of Scientology {{sought an}} {{injunction}} and {{a restraining order}} to prevent Anonymous from protesting on March 15, 2008, citing threats allegedly made by Anonymous. Both <b>the</b> <b>injunction</b> and the restraining order were denied. On March 31, 2008, Radar Online reported that representatives of law firms delivered legal letters to suspected Anons, often at their homes. The Church filed complaints of trespassing and criminal harassment against Boston organizer Gregg Housh, who was charged with disturbing an assembly of worship, disturbing the peace, and harassment. The District Attorney's office dropped the harassment charge, and Judge Thomas Horgan issued a continuance without finding for the remaining charges.|$|E
5|$|The {{environmental}} groups that had filed <b>the</b> <b>injunction</b> appealed the decision, and on October 6, 1972, the U.S. District Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C. partially reversed Hart's decision. The appeals {{court said that}} although the impact statement followed the guidelines set by the National Environmental Policy Act, it did not follow the Minerals Leasing Act, which allowed for a smaller pipeline right of way than was required for the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. The oil companies and Alyeska appealed this decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, but in April 1973, the court declined to hear the case.|$|E
5|$|In late 1992, the Dangerous Journeys RPG was {{released}} by Games Designer Workshop, but TSR immediately applied for an injunction against the entire Dangerous Journeys RPG and the Mythus setting, arguing that Dangerous Journeys was based on D and AD. Although <b>the</b> <b>injunction</b> failed, TSR moved forward with litigation. Gygax believed the legal action was without merit and fuelled by Lorraine Williams' personal enmity, but NEC and JVC both withdrew from the project, killing the Mythus computer game. By 1994, the legal costs associated with many months of pretrial discovery had drained all of Gygax's resources; believing that TSR was also suffering, Gygax offered to settle. In the end, TSR paid Gygax for the complete rights to Dangerous Journeys and Mythus. Although Gygax was well compensated for his years of work on Dangerous Journeys and Mythus, neither was ever published—TSR immediately and permanently shelved them.|$|E

5|$|On 27 August 1997, a {{delegation}} of Noongars consisting of Ken Colbung, Robert Bropho, Richard Wilkes and Mingli Wanjurri-Nungala arrived in the UK to collect Yagan's head. The delegation {{was to have been}} larger, but Commonwealth funding was withdrawn at the last minute. The handover of Yagan's skull was further delayed, however, when a Noongar named Corrie Bodney applied to the Supreme Court of Western Australia for an injunction against the handover. Claiming that his family group has sole responsibility for Yagan's remains, Bodney declared the exhumation illegal and denied the existence of any tradition or belief necessitating the head's exhumation and removal to Australia. On 29 August, Justice Henry Wallwork rejected <b>the</b> <b>injunction</b> application, on the grounds that Bodney had previously agreed to the current arrangements, and on the evidence of another Noongar elder (Albert Corunna, who claimed to be a closer relation of Yagan) and anthropologist Pat Baines, both of whom refuted Bodney's claim to sole responsibility.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>injunction</b> {{against the}} project forced Alyeska to do further {{research}} {{throughout the summer}} of 1970. The collected material {{was turned over to}} the Interior Department in October 1970, and a draft environmental impact statement was published in January 1971. The 294-page statement drew massive criticism, generating more than 12,000 pages of testimony and evidence in Congressional debates by the end of March. Criticisms of the project included its effect on the Alaska tundra, possible pollution, harm to animals, geographic features, and the lack of much engineering information from Alyeska. One element of opposition the report quelled was the discussion of alternatives. All the proposed alternatives—extension of the Alaska Railroad, an alternative route through Canada, establishing a port at Prudhoe Bay, and more—were deemed to pose more environmental risks than construction of a pipeline directly across Alaska.|$|E
5|$|The second {{controversy}} arose as {{a result}} of the renovation of the governor's mansion. Kentucky first lady Phyllis George Brown created the Save the Mansion Fund to help cover the costs of the renovation. When the renovation was complete, she planned a nine-day showcase of the mansion for the general public. Guests were charged $10 to take a tour of the mansion. Legislator Eugene P. Stuart objected to taxpayers being charged a fee to view a mansion their tax dollars supported. He asked Beshear to protest the charge, and Beshear requested an injunction against the Save the Mansion Fund. A Lexington judge refused to grant <b>the</b> <b>injunction,</b> and Beshear appealed to the Kentucky Court of Appeals, which upheld the lower court's decision. Beshear's actions caused a rift between him and Governor John Y. Brown, Jr.|$|E

40|$|The proper {{scope of}} tribunal-ordered anti-suit {{injunctions}} to combat parallel proceedings has {{been subject to}} much debate. Some have argued that arbitrators’ use of <b>the</b> <b>injunctions</b> requires restriction, while others argue that existing conditions and limitations are sufficient. This paper provides an outline of the sources from which arbitrators are empowered to order anti-suit <b>injunctions,</b> <b>the</b> development of <b>the</b> <b>injunctions</b> through cases, and the recent European Court of Justice decision in Gazprom. It briefly touches on court-ordered anti-suit <b>injunctions,</b> and <b>the</b> implications of the Brussels I Regulation for tribunal-ordered anti-suit injunctions. It concludes that the scope of anti-suit injunctions does not require further restriction. Reasons for this conclusion include the 2006 amendments to the UNCITRAL Model Law; commercial reasons; the need to prevent conflicting decisions; {{and the nature of}} arbitration as arising from private commercial arrangements between parties...|$|R
