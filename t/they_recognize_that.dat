5|$|With {{some notable}} exceptions, Reformed Christians baptize infants who {{are born to}} believing parents. Reformed Christians do so {{on the basis of}} the {{continuity}} from the old covenant between God and Israel and the new covenant with the church, since infants were circumcised under the old covenant. They also see God's saving purpose in the new covenant as having to do with families as well as individuals. Because Reformed Christians believe baptism must be embraced by faith to have any benefit, <b>they</b> <b>recognize</b> <b>that</b> faith may come later in life rather than preceding baptism. Infants may also be said to possess a seed of faith which will come to fruition later, or baptism may be administered based on a promise of faith offered by their sponsors (usually their parents) which will be kept at a later age.|$|E
5|$|Following David and Shaw's exodus for the Engineer home world, {{they arrive}} at a temple {{surrounded}} by scores of Engineers. David carpet bombs them with the mutagen, resulting in the extinction of all non-floral life on the planet, as well as mutations in the flora that can infect and impregnate organisms with Neomorphs. The Engineer ship crashes afterwards and Shaw dies from unknown means, though David preserves and utilizes her body in his eugenics experiments. Ten years later, a team from the colony ship Covenant is attacked by two Neomorphs that burst from two of their bodies. David intervenes by frightening them away with a flare gun. He urges the survivors to follow him to the temple, where he has established his laboratory. Sporting overgrown hair, David introduces himself and offers them shelter, while learning about the 2,000 colonists and hundreds of embryos in stasis aboard Covenant. He takes {{a special interest in}} the successor model from his own synthetic line, Walter, and tells him that Shaw died when the Engineer ship crashed. David claims to have loved Shaw and compares it to Walter's attachment to the terraforming expert Daniels, which Walter dismisses as being impossible. David attempts to bond with Walter by teaching him to play the flute. <b>They</b> <b>recognize</b> <b>that</b> while Walter is more advanced, he has been inhibited from creating, due to disturbances caused by David models with that feature.|$|E

Cyber-extortionists typically begin with a low-level attack and a warning that a larger attack {{will be carried out}} if a ransom is not paid in Bitcoin. Security experts recommend targeted websites to not pay the ransom.

Community of Christ states <b>they</b> <b>recognize</b> <b>that</b> there is inadequacy in any simplistic answer that defines all abortion as murder or as a simple medical procedure. They recognize a woman's right in deciding the continuation or termination of pregnancy, and recommend such decisions be made {{with the support of}} family, and consultation with medical, ministerial, and professional counseling service. They also state that jurisdictional leaders {{need to be aware of}} competent counseling resources and women's health services in their area to refer people to during and after the decision making process.|$|E

The group confronts Gongora in the Hall of Mirrors, {{the only place where}} they are vulnerable to death. The mortals help to block the mirror's power while the immortals fight Gongora, but their powers are equally matched. When the mortals become trapped in their own barrier after absorbing too much power, Seth drags Gongora through the mirror, allowing Kaim to break it and prevent him from ever returning.|$|E
25|$|In {{psychological}} {{research on}} altruism, studies often observe altruism as demonstrated through prosocial {{behaviors such as}} helping, comforting, sharing, cooperation, philanthropy, and community service. Research has found that people {{are most likely to}} help if <b>they</b> <b>recognize</b> <b>that</b> a person is in need and feel personal responsibility for reducing the person's distress. Research also suggests that the number of bystanders witnessing distress or suffering affects the likelihood of helping (the Bystander effect). Greater numbers of bystanders decrease individual feelings of responsibility. However, a witness {{with a high level of}} empathic concern is likely to assume personal responsibility entirely regardless of the number of bystanders. A feeling of personal responsibility or - moral norm - has also strongly been associated with other pro-social behaviors such as charitable giving.|$|E

25|$|Hou has {{attempted}} to balance chess with life outside of it. She enrolled in Peking University in 2012, studying International Relations, against the wishes of her trainer. She took a full course load and participated in many extracurricular activities; after graduation she applied to and was accepted by the University of Chicago for a masters in social work. Compared to the best professional male players who dedicate their lives to chess, Hou's split focus puts her as a disadvantage, {{and as a consequence}} her results against them have been lackluster. These competitors give her credit for what she has achieved in spite of her lack of preparation, and for her life outside of chess. However, <b>they</b> <b>recognize</b> <b>that</b> while Hou can probably remain the best female player in the world without extra effort, she cannot compete with the best male players unless she dedicates herself to chess. Hou is aware of this as well, but has yet to make the choice.|$|E
25|$|Rosencrantz and Guildenstern find {{themselves}} on a ship that has already set sail. The audience is {{led to believe that}} the pair has no knowledge of how they got there. At first, they try to determine whether they are still alive. Eventually, <b>they</b> <b>recognize</b> <b>that</b> they are not dead and are on board a boat. They remember that Claudius had given them a letter to deliver to England. After some brief confusion over who actually has the letter, they find it and end up opening it. They realize that Claudius has asked for Hamlet to be killed. While Rosencrantz seems hesitant to follow their orders now, Guildenstern convinces him that they are not worthy of interfering with fate and with the plans of kings. The stage becomes black and, presumably, the characters go to sleep. Hamlet switches the letter with one he has written himself, an act which takes place off stage in Hamlet.|$|E
500|$|Another {{approach}} applies {{specifically to}} the study of self-awareness, that is, the ability to distinguish oneself from others. [...] In the 1970s Gordon Gallup developed an operational test for self-awareness, known as the mirror test. [...] The test examines whether animals are able to differentiate between seeing themselves in a mirror versus seeing other animals. The classic example involves placing a spot of coloring on the skin or fur near the individual's forehead and seeing if they attempt to remove it or at least touch the spot, thus indicating that <b>they</b> <b>recognize</b> <b>that</b> the individual they are seeing in the mirror is themselves. [...] Humans (older than 18 months) and other great apes, bottlenose dolphins, killer whales, pigeons, European magpies and elephants have all been observed to pass this test.|$|E

500|$|Both {{these types}} of reading have now fallen out of favour; there is little {{consensus}} {{about the meaning of}} The Country Wife, but its [...] "notorious resistance to interpretation" [...] is having an invigorating rather than damping effect on academic interest. The play's ideological dimension has been emphasised recently. It was written by a courtier for a courtly and aristocratic audience, and Douglas Canfield has pointed to an unusual complication for a courtly play. Horner's acts of cuckolding aggression are directed not only at disrupting middle-class families of [...] "the City", in the usual way of the aristocratic Restoration rake, but also at his own, upper, class, the inhabitants of [...] "the Town" [...] the new and fashionable quarters (the future West End) that had sprung up west of the medieval City walls after the Great Fire of London in 1666. The courtier code proposed by Wycherley is of a sexual game. Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick argued in Between Men that the game is played not between men and women, but between men by means of women, who are merely the [...] "conduits" [...] of homosocial desire between men. The hierarchy of wits meant that the wittiest and most virile man would win at the game. Thus Horner, as Canfield puts it, [...] "represents not just class superiority, but that subset of class represented by the Town wits, a privileged minority that ... is the jet set identified with the Town and the Court as the loci of real power in the kingdom." [...] The aggressive attack mounted in the china scene against the class and the generation by which Wycherley was patronised with the expectation that he would defend it (against Sir Jaspar Fidget and Lady Fidget), suggests Canfield, would only let an audience of that class laugh comfortably if Horner were punished by actual impotence in the end, which he is not. [...] "When the play concludes with no poetical justice that makes Horner really impotent", writes Canfield, [...] "leaving him instead potent and still on the make, the audience laughs at its own expense: the women of quality nervously because they have been misogynistically slandered; the men of quality nervously because at some level <b>they</b> <b>recognize</b> <b>that</b> class solidarity is just a pleasing fiction." ...|$|E
500|$|A proclamation: In {{the markets}} {{of the city}} the profits from {{commerce}} are monopolized by itinerant loiterers, while the little people from the rural villages {{are not allowed to}} sell their wares. There is not a single necessity of our clothing or food that is not the product of the fields of these old rustics. The men plow and the women weave. Their toil is extremely wearisome, yet what they gain from it is negligible, while manifold interest returns to these lazy idlers. This sort, in tens and hundreds, come together to form gangs. When the villagers come to sell things in the market place, before the goods have even left their hands, this crowd of idlers arrives and attacks them, assaulting them as a group. These idlers call this [...] "the boxing of the community family." [...] They are not at all afraid to act outrageously. I have myself seen that it is like this. Have they not given thought to the foodstuffs they require and the clothing they wear? Is it produced by these people of the marketplaces? Or is it produced by the rural farmers? When <b>they</b> <b>recognize</b> <b>that</b> these goods are produced by the farming people or the rural villages, how can they look at them in anger? How can they bully and insult them? Now, Pan Fifty-two and Li Seven are both fishmongers, but Pan lives in the city and fishmongering is his source of livelihood. Li Seven is a farmer, who does fishmongering between busy times. Pan Fifty-two {{at the end of the}} year has his profit, without having had the labor of raising the fish, but simply earning it from the selling of the fish. He hated Li and fought with him at the fish market. His lack of humanity is extreme! Li Seven is a village rustic. How could he fight with the itinerant armed loiterers who hang around the marketplace? Although no injuries resulted from the fight, we still must mete out some slight punishments. Pan Fifty-two is to be beaten fifteen blows with the heavy rod. In addition, Li Seven, although he is a village farmer, was still verbally abusive while the two men were stubbornly arguing. He clearly is not a man of simple and pure character. He must have done something to provoke this dispute. Li Seven is to be given a suspended sentence of a beating of ten blows, to be carried out if hereafter there are further violations.|$|E
