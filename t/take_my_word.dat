500|$|Dodd {{contributed to}} several films in which issues facing Indigenous Australians, such as land rights and race relations, were the central subjects. These {{appearances}} included Bitter Springs (mentioned above) and The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith (1978), {{the first of}} two films in which he appeared alongside Jack Thompson. Dodd played the character of Tabidgi, the uncle of the lead character, Aboriginal man Jimmie Blacksmith. In the film, Jimmie Blacksmith marries a white woman named Gilda Marshall (played by Angela Punch McGregor). When they have a baby, Dodd's character, [...] "a tribal elder,... is worried about Jimmie's marriage to a white woman and has brought him a talisman to keep him safe". Pauline Kael, writing in The New Yorker, described the performances of the two black professional actors (Jack Charles and Dodd) as [...] "wonderful as sots:... Steve Dodds , who is tried for murder and simply says, 'You'd think it would take a good while to make up your mind to kill someone and then to kill them, but <b>take</b> <b>my</b> <b>word</b> for it, it only takes a second'".|$|E
500|$|As {{the book}} became {{acclaimed}} {{as a modern}} classic, it began {{to be used in}} the classroom, and Juster corresponded with some teachers. After the book's readers attained adulthood, they wrote of its influence on them. Novelist Cathleen Schine recalled, [...] "it was as if someone had turned on the lights. The concepts of irony, of double entendre, of words as play, of the pleasure and inevitability of intellectual absurdity, were suddenly accessible to me. They made sense to me in an extremely personal way." [...] British fantasy writer Diana Wynne Jones read her copy so often it fell apart: [...] "it didn't occur to us that it might be about something. It struck us as a little like The Wizard of Oz, only better." [...] One reader, signing himself [...] "Milo", wrote to Rolling Stone in 1970, [...] "If you want to get freaked out of your undernourished head, pick up The Phantom Tollbooth, by Norton Juster. They tell you it's a kids' book, but <b>take</b> <b>my</b> <b>word</b> for it, no one who reads it is ever the same. No hype." ...|$|E
500|$|Because Never Say Never Again {{is not an}} Eon-produced film, it has {{not been}} {{included}} in a number of subsequent reviews. Norman Wilner of MSN said that 1967's Casino Royale and Never Say Never Again [...] "exist outside the 'official' continuity, [...] are excluded from this list, just as they're absent from MGM's megabox. But <b>take</b> <b>my</b> <b>word</b> for it; they're both pretty awful". Of the more recent reviews, opinion on Never Say Never Again is still mixed: film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes lists the film with a 63% rating from 46 reviews. The score is still more positive than some of the Eon films, with Rotten Tomatoes ranking Never Say Never Again 16th among all Bond films in 2008. Empire gives the film three of a possible five stars, observing that [...] "Connery was perhaps wise to call it quits the first time round". IGN gave Never Say Never Again a score of 5 out of 10, claiming that the film [...] "is more miss than hit". The review also thought that the film was [...] "marred with too many clunky exposition scenes and not enough moments of Bond being Bond".|$|E

2500|$|In August 2017, WNED filed {{a wide-ranging}} lawsuit against Burton and RRKidz that demands Burton's company hand over {{administrative}} access to various websites and social media accounts. The lawsuit also seeks to enjoin Burton {{from using the}} Reading Rainbow catchphrase, [...] "But you don't have to <b>take</b> <b>my</b> <b>word</b> for it," [...] on his podcast. [...] As of October 2017, visiting the official Reading Rainbow website provides a page which states that [...] "Recent legal disputes between WNED and LeVar Burton/RRKIDZ have been resolved and RRKIDZ no longer licenses the Reading Rainbow brand from WNED. WNED {{is currently working on}} the next chapter of Reading Rainbow and will continue its mission of fostering education for a new generation." ...|$|E
2500|$|Every episode {{featured}} a different book, often narrated by a celebrity. Celebrity readers included Philip Bosco (Barbara Bash's Desert Giant: The World of the Saguaro Cactus), Michael Ansara (Paul Goble's The Gift of the Sacred Dog, Sheila MacGill Callahan's And Still the Turtle Watched), Josie de Guzman (Leyla Torres's Saturday Sancocho), Jason Robards (Francine Jacobs' Sam the Sea Cow), Bill Cosby (Marc Brown's Arthur's Eyes), Eartha Kitt (Megan McDonald's Is This a House for Hermit Crab?), and Charles Kimbrough (David Wiesner's June 29, 1999). After the featured story, {{at least one}} {{as well as two}} segments featured Burton in diverse places, showing interviews of people to talk about their work and other contributions, focusing on the episode's theme. In one episode, Burton took the show behind-the-scenes on the set of [...] The final segment of each show, called Book Reviews, began with Burton's introductory catchphrase, [...] "But you don't have to <b>take</b> <b>my</b> <b>word</b> for it," [...] and featured children giving capsule reviews of books they liked. At the end of nearly each episode, Burton signs off by saying: [...] "I'll see you next time." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{assured them}} that it was, {{and they were very}} polite and <b>took</b> <b>my</b> <b>word</b> for it. All but one old gentleman {{at the other end of}} the table, who wanted to know which was the joke--what he said to her or what she said to him; and we argued it out.|$|R
6000|$|... "One leg was pinioned {{beneath the}} machine {{which was on}} fire when they {{discovered}} you.

60|$|What I {{said about}} baptism's being a PEST, <b>take</b> <b>my</b> <b>words</b> as they lie, and I stand still thereto: 'Knowing that Satan can make any of God's {{ordinances}} a PEST and plague to his people, even baptism, the Lord's table, {{and the holy}} scriptures; yea, the ministers also of Jesus Christ may be suffered to abuse them, and wrench {{them out of their}} place.'

6000|$|... "I <b>take</b> back <b>my</b> <b>words.</b> The Prince is wiser than I thought. Magicians {{know the}} future because {{at times it}} rushes down upon them and they must. It is that which makes them lonely, since what they know they cannot say. But only fools will seek it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never! I've {{wished to}} say it again, ever since that night at Middlemount; I have always felt bound by what I said then, though I <b>took</b> back <b>my</b> <b>words</b> for your sake. But the promise was always there, and my life was in it. You believe that?" ...|$|R

60|$|I {{could not}} {{tell her that she}} had <b>taken</b> <b>my</b> <b>words</b> too literally, that being alone simply meant being {{separated}} from her; but there was no help for it, and some one, alas! some one I greatly hated was waiting for her. I could only thank her and her friend for their kind intentions. But what in the name of goodness was I to say to this beautiful woman who was sitting by me? She was certainly very beautiful, with a far more mature and perhaps a nobler beauty than Yoletta's, her age being about twenty-seven or twenty-eight; but the divine charm in the young girl's face could, for me, exist in no other.|$|R
