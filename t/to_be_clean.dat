5|$|Bordagaray gained {{publicity}} {{through the}} press through his colorful personality and various gimmicks. He appeared in bit parts {{in movies and}} grew a mustache {{in a time when}} baseball players were expected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>clean</b> shaven. He has been inducted into the Brooklyn Dodgers Hall of Fame, the Fresno County Athletic Hall of Fame, and the Ventura County Sports Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|Living {{conditions}} were primitive in the camp, with trainees housed either under canvas in tents or in Nissen huts {{and they were}} responsible for cooking their own meals. Correct military protocols were enforced: Officers were saluted and uniforms had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>clean,</b> with brasses and boots shining on parade. At {{the end of each}} course the final exercise was a simulated night beach landing using live ammunition.|$|E
5|$|Celtic again {{qualified}} for the UEFA Champions League for the 2013–14 season, and again played against Barcelona at Parkhead on 1 October 2013, losing 1–0. Despite the defeat, Forster again impressed with several excellent saves, in particular an outstanding double save {{near the end of}} the match. Forster also pulled off a crucial save during a 2–1 win on 22 October 2013 over Ajax at Parkhead, saving from Thulani Serero when he seemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>clean</b> through on goal.|$|E

25|$|At {{the same}} time Belgrand began {{rebuilding}} the water distribution and sewer system under the streets. In 1852 Paris had 142 kilometers of sewers, which could carry only liquid waste. Containers of solid waste were picked up each night by people called vidangeurs, who carried it to waste dumps {{on the outskirts of}} the city. The tunnels he designed were intended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>clean,</b> easily accessible, and substantially larger than the previous Parisian underground. Under his guidance, Paris's sewer system expanded fourfold between 1852 and 1869.|$|E
25|$|All mosques have rules {{regarding}} cleanliness, {{as it is}} {{an essential}} part of the worshippers' experience. Muslims before prayer are required to cleanse themselves in an ablution process known as wudu. However, even to those who enter the prayer hall of a mosque without the intention of praying, there are still rules that apply. Shoes must not be worn inside the carpeted prayer hall. Some mosques will also extend that rule to include other parts of the facility even if those other locations are not devoted to prayer. Congregants and visitors to mosques are supposed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>clean</b> themselves. It is also undesirable to come to the mosque after eating something that smells, such as garlic.|$|E

For each liter biodiesel production, approximately 0.2 – 3  L of biodiesel wastewater will be produced, and that needs <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>cleaned</b> carefully. Therefore, biodiesel production also requires a robust method to purify the water from contaminants (Berrios and Skelton 2008).|$|R
25|$|Charles did {{not learn}} to speak {{until the age of}} four nor to walk until eight, and was treated as {{virtually}} an infant until he was ten years old. His jaw was so badly deformed (an extreme example of the so-called Habsburg jaw) that he could barely speak or chew. Fearing the frail child would be overtaxed, his caretakers did not force Charles to attend school. The indolence of the young Charles was indulged {{to such an extent that}} at times he was not expected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>clean.</b> When his illegitimate half-brother John of Austria the Younger obtained power by exiling the queen mother from court, he covered his nose and insisted that the king at least brush his hair.|$|E
25|$|The {{third day}} began with Australia {{trailing}} England by 41, with seven wickets in hand. Border and Jones continued {{where they had}} left off the previous evening, with the later posting his half-century soon after the resumption. The morning session was all Australia's, who soon went past England's total in a very one-sided session. A highlight of the destruction was Jones striking a clattering six into the stands off Emburey, before mis-timing <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>clean</b> bowled by Ian Botham for 69. This brought in-form Steve Waugh to the crease to join Border who was looking well set. Border soon brought up his fifty, the total passed 300, and then Waugh brought up his fifty. In a rare lapse during an otherwise perfect innings, Border snicked a thin edge to Russell off Foster, out for 80, with he and Waugh having added 88 for the fifth wicket. Foster trapped Australian wicket-keeper Ian Healy LBW for a golden duck the very next ball {{to be on a}} hat-trick, but his replacement Trevor Hohns easily blocked the hat-trick ball.|$|E
500|$|Bordagaray {{showed up}} at spring {{training}} in 1936 with a mustache, which he grew for a bit role in The Prisoner of Shark Island, filmed during the offseason. This was scandalous, as baseball players were expected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>clean</b> shaven at the time; the last player believed to have worn a mustache was Wally Schang during the 1914 season. Looking for stories to write about, sportswriters for the Dodgers encouraged Bordagaray to grow out his mustache and goatee. The Brooklyn Eagle hosted a contest to determine what sort of beard Bordagaray should grow. After a few months, Dodgers manager Casey Stengel made him shave, saying [...] "If anyone's {{going to be a}} clown on this club, it's going to be me." [...] Mustaches would not be seen in MLB again until Oakland Athletics owner Charlie O. Finley paid his players to grow facial hair in the 1970s. Finley hosted a [...] "mustache day", and invited Bordagaray to serve as master of ceremonies.|$|E

500|$|After Woodford's removal, Kikukawa was re-appointed {{president}} and CEO of Olympus. One week later, he accused Woodford of having created [...] "a gang" [...] of direct reports that circumvented Mori, his supposed immediate subordinate. Kikukawa resigned on 26 October [...] "to restore {{confidence in the}} company under the new management". At the press conference, he declared Olympus <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>clean,</b> continued to accuse Woodford of attempting to seize power, and maintained Woodford was [...] "autocratic", and that his alleged offences [...] "included intimidation of my own staff." [...] By contrast, Woodford alleged that his forced departure was linked to several prior acquisitions and payments he questioned, particularly the US$2.2billion deal in 2008 to acquire British medical equipment maker Gyrus Group, and said on Bloomberg Television: [...] "The board has to go, they're all toxic, they are all contaminated." [...] On 30 November, Woodford {{announced that he would}} resign from the Olympus board, saying that his decision was unrelated to the official investigations in Japan, the UK, and the USA. He added that his resignation was necessary in the context, and that he was [...] "committed to ensuring that Olympus has the best possible opportunity to succeed going forward, starting with a new and untainted board of directors." ...|$|E

50|$|Ultrasonic {{cleaning}} is {{a process}} that uses ultrasound (usually from 20-400 kHz) and an appropriate cleaning solvent (sometimes ordinary tap water) to clean items. The ultrasound can be used with just water, but use of a solvent appropriate for the item <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>cleaned</b> and the type of soiling present enhances the effect. Cleaning normally lasts between three and six minutes, but can also exceed 20 minutes, depending on the object <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>cleaned.</b>|$|R

2500|$|While {{the region}} officially {{converted}} to Christianity, old pagan beliefs persisted. In 1595, cartographer Caspar Hennenberger published an explanation to his map of Prussia.

[...] wrote in 1769 that locals performed pagan rituals on the hill despite prohibitions from the Christian priests. In 1867, , a journalist from Berlin, visited Rambynas and wrote that newlyweds would climb the hill and would leave small sacrifices. The most extensive description of the hill and its legends was provided by , a Lithuanian-language teacher in Tilsit. In 1838, he published Scenes from Lithuanian People's Lives (Szenen aus dem Volksleben der Litauer). He also described a 600-year-old three-trunk linden tree that grew near the hill and was worshiped as goddess of fate Laima's tree.|$|E

Anyone who touched her bedding or any object on which she has sat was to wash his clothes, bathe in water, and remain unclean until evening. And if a man lay with her, her impurity was communicated {{to him and he}} was to be unclean seven days, and any bedding on which he lay became unclean.
