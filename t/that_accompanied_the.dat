5|$|Woo is {{cast as a}} villain, {{underscored by}} her {{frequent}} appearance to the theme music <b>that</b> <b>accompanied</b> <b>the</b> Wicked Witch of the West in the Wizard of Oz. Unlike a melodramatic villain such as J. R. Ewing, Ling was cast as a remarkably heartless character {{until well into the}} second season (Season 3 of the show), when she begins to befriend other characters.|$|E
5|$|After the Revolution {{the senior}} {{branch of the}} Rochefoucauld family regained possession. The château was renovated {{in the first half}} of the 19th century. The work was {{undertaken}} by the La Villéons in the romantic style <b>that</b> <b>accompanied</b> <b>the</b> Bourbon Restoration after 1815. They added decorations to the windows and made false arrow slots, added two towers to the south facade, added a flamboyant balustrade and dormer windows, and made changes to part of the chapel.|$|E
5|$|Returning to England in 1934, Morgan assumed {{command of}} the 4th Anti-Aircraft Battery, which was {{deployed}} to Malta during the diplomatic crisis <b>that</b> <b>accompanied</b> <b>the</b> Italian invasion of Abyssinia in 1935. He served in the War Office from 1936 to 1938. Here he became increasingly disturbed {{at the lack of}} urgency that the government displayed {{in the face of a}} war that Morgan and his fellow staff officers felt was inevitable and imminent. That year he was promoted colonel and became General Staff Officer (Grade 1) of the 3rd Division, in which Brigadier Bernard Montgomery commanded the 8th Infantry Brigade.|$|E

5|$|The {{domestication}} {{of livestock}} {{was driven by}} the need to have food on hand when hunting was unproductive. The desirable characteristics of a domestic animal are that it should be useful to man, should be able to thrive in his company, should breed freely and be easy to tend. Domestication was not a single event, but a process repeated at various periods in different places. Sheep and goats were the animals <b>that</b> <b>accompanied</b> <b>the</b> nomads in the Middle East, while cattle and pigs were associated with more settled communities.|$|E
5|$|The {{fair amount}} of {{isolated}} fragments and sculptures testify to the many lost works and those that reached us only incompletely, which were clearly of considerable artistic merit. None of these are mentioned in archival documents, apart from the sculptures <b>that</b> <b>accompanied</b> <b>the</b> Caprioli Adoration. On the other hand, the chapel in San Pietro de Dom, commissioned to Gasparo Cairano in 1504 is the only documented work of the sculptor that has been completely lost.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the Mérens is closely linked to its {{homeland}} in the Pyrenees, {{as evidenced by the}} many myths and legends in which it plays a role. The origins of the Mérens are very old, and are commonly said to be lost in the mists of time. It is native to the upper valley of Ariege, near Andorra. The direct ancestor of the Mérens was probably in this valley during the Quaternary Period, approximately 15,000 years ago. These wild horses probably moved to the mountains to escape global warming <b>that</b> <b>accompanied</b> <b>the</b> end of the last glacial period.|$|E

5|$|Activity {{after the}} caldera's {{formation}} created lava domes and rhyolitic lava flows along its ring faults. One flow was dated at 1,090,000 ± 110,000 years old, and the domes are 1.4 to 1.2 million years old. La Reforma eruption products were later partially buried by activity from El Aguajito, where volcanic activity had migrated to. Basaltic cones which erupted 600,000 {{years ago on}} the caldera's flanks despite their location {{are not part of the}} La Reforma volcano; like Isla Tortuga and Tres Virgenes, they are controlled by the tectonic processes <b>that</b> <b>accompanied</b> <b>the</b> rifting of the Sea of Cortez. Also, rivers deposited sediments inside the caldera itself. Seismic activity still occurs at Tres Virgenes volcano. La Reforma could still experience large scale explosive volcanism, especially in its southwestern part.|$|E
5|$|Although Warren {{departed}} {{the region}} soon afterwards {{with most of}} his squadron, Watrin was still unable to make an impression {{on the walls of}} Porto Ferrajo, and Airey held the town against the French for the last few weeks of the war until news arrived of the ceasefire <b>that</b> <b>accompanied</b> <b>the</b> provisional signing of the Treaty of Amiens on 1 October. On 11 October, volunteers from the Maltese Light Infantry arrived to relieve the garrison at Porto Ferrajo. In March 1802 under Article XI of the final terms of the Treaty, the British turned over the entire island to the French and Elba remained in French hands throughout the Napoleonic Wars. The Maltese detachment returned to Malta in April 1802.|$|E
5|$|In {{conversations with}} Eidelman, Meyer {{mentioned}} {{that since the}} marches <b>that</b> <b>accompanied</b> <b>the</b> main titles for the previous Star Trek films were so good, he {{had no desire to}} compete with them by composing a bombastic opening. He also felt that since the film was darker than its predecessors, it demanded something different musically as a result. He mentioned the opening to Igor Stravinsky's The Firebird as similar to the foreboding sound he wanted. Two days later Eidelman produced a tape of his idea for the main theme, played on a synthesizer. Meyer was impressed by the speed of the work and the close fit to his vision. Meyer approached producer Steven Charles-Jaffe with Eidelman's CD, which reminded Jaffe of Bernard Herrmann; Eidelman was given the task of composing the score.|$|E

5|$|In the east, Selvo {{not only}} {{maintained}} good {{trade relations with}} the Byzantine Empire, but also married into their royal family to consolidate the alliance that had existed for many years between the two nations. In 1075, Selvo married Teodora Ducas, daughter of Constantine X and sister of the reigning emperor, Michael VII. Though Venetians, especially the nobles, were wary of the pageantry <b>that</b> <b>accompanied</b> <b>the</b> marriage and the royal bride, the strengthened alliance meant even greater mobility for Venetian merchants in the east. Though {{the popularity of the}} new dogaressa was not great, Selvo was the hero of the merchant class that had had even greater political sway since the depositions of the Orseoli.|$|E
5|$|In {{the myth}} called the Destruction of Mankind, related in the Book of the Heavenly Cow from the New Kingdom (c. 1550–1070 BC), Ra uses the Eye {{as a weapon}} against humans who have rebelled against his authority. He sends the Eye—Hathor, in her {{aggressive}} manifestation as the lioness goddess Sekhmet—to massacre them. She does so, but after {{the first day of}} her rampage, Ra decides to prevent her from killing all humanity. He orders that beer be dyed red and poured out over the land. The Eye goddess drinks the beer, mistaking it for blood, and in her inebriated state returns to Ra without noticing her intended victims. Through her drunkenness she has been returned to a harmless form. Nadine Guilhou suggests that the Eye's rampage alludes to the heat and widespread disease of the Egyptian summer, and in particular to the epagomenal days before the new year, which were regarded as unlucky. The red beer might then refer to the red silt <b>that</b> <b>accompanied</b> <b>the</b> subsequent Nile flood, which was believed to end the period of misfortune.|$|E
5|$|Its {{coterie of}} {{personnel}} by now being {{referred to as}} the Australian Flying Corps (AFC), CFS commenced its first course on 17August 1914, two weeks after the outbreak of World WarI. Its students included Captain Thomas White and Lieutenant Richard Williams, with Harrison providing initial training to solo standard and Petre advanced instruction. In September, Harrison was given command of a flying unit <b>that</b> <b>accompanied</b> <b>the</b> Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force to Rabaul in German New Guinea. With {{little in the way of}} enemy resistance, however, the aircraft were never assembled in country and he had to return without leading the first Australian airmen into combat, a distinction that instead went to Petre as commander of the Mesopotamian Half Flight the following year.|$|E

5|$|Shortly after, the {{religious}} reformers (and protégés of Cromwell) Robert Barnes, William Jerome and Thomas Garret were burned as heretics. Cromwell, meanwhile, {{fell out of}} favour although it is unclear exactly why, for {{there is little evidence}} of differences of domestic or foreign policy. Despite his role, he was never formally accused of being responsible for Henry's failed marriage. Cromwell was now surrounded by enemies at court, with Norfolk also able to draw on his niece's position. Cromwell was charged with treason, selling export licences, granting passports, and drawing up commissions without permission, and may also have been blamed for the failure of the foreign policy <b>that</b> <b>accompanied</b> <b>the</b> attempted marriage to Anne. He was subsequently attainted and beheaded.|$|E
5|$|When the Allies {{received}} {{the news that}} Xerxes was clearing paths around Mount Olympus, and thus intending to march towards Thermopylae, it was both the period of truce <b>that</b> <b>accompanied</b> <b>the</b> Olympic games, and the Spartan festival of Carneia, during both of which warfare was considered sacrilegious. Nevertheless, the Spartans considered the threat so grave that they despatched their king Leonidas I with his personal bodyguard (the Hippeis) of 300 men (in this case, the elite young soldiers in the Hippeis were replaced by veterans who already had sons). Leonidas was supported by contingents from the Peloponnesian cities allied to Sparta, and other forces that were picked up en route to Thermopylae. The Allies proceeded to occupy the pass, rebuilt the wall the Phocians had built at the narrowest point of the pass, and waited for Xerxes's arrival.|$|E
5|$|From the {{beginning}} of the United States, Georgia geology has been included in maps produced for the entire country. The first geological map of the U.S. was produced in 1809 by William Maclure. In 1807, Maclure undertook the self-imposed task of making a geological survey of the United States. He traversed and mapped nearly every state in the Union. During the rigorous two-year period of his survey, he crossed and recrossed the Allegheny Mountains some 50 times. The results of his unaided endeavor were submitted to the American Philosophical Society in a memoir entitled Observations on the Geology of the United States explanatory of a Geological Map, together with the nation's first geological map, which were published in the Society's journal Transactions, This precedes William Smith's geological map of England by six years, although Smith's map was constructed using a different classification of rocks. Several reports used Maclure’s geological map to accompany their description of the geology of the U.S. (Beaujour, 1814 and Marcou, 1858). In 1816, within an elementary treatise of mineralogy and geology, Parker Cleaveland produced a geological map of the U.S. In 1843, Charles Moxon produced a small-scale geologic map of the U.S., where Ami Boué produced a geological structure map of the globe. In 1853, Marcou produced a geological map of the U.S. and the British provinces of North America. In 1856, Henry Darwin Rogers created a similar map of the geology of the U.S. and British North America. There was a short description of the geologic map of the U.S. by Charles Henry Hitchcock in 1872, which had small-scale geological maps included. Hitchcock and William P. Blake published a general geologic map of the U.S. in R.W. Raymond’s Statistics of mines and mining. In 1874, they published a geological map of the U.S. and territories in the U.S. Census 9th Statistical Atlas. Hitchcock and Blake published a summary of this map in the Geological Magazine in 1873. Gray’s geological map of the U.S. was published in the National Atlas special edition at a scale of about 1inch to 300 miles in 1876 and reprinted in 1886 by the American Institute of Mining Engineers. A geological map of the U.S. east of the Rocky Mountains was produced at the scale of 1inch to 105.5 miles by Frank H. Bradley. In the 1880s several geological maps of the U.S. were produced. William John McGee offered a detailed description for the U.S. Geological Survey in 1884. In 1887, Hitchcock produced a geological map of the U.S. and parts of Canada that was at the scale of 1inch to 200 miles, with a review of the various maps of the U.S. <b>that</b> <b>accompanied</b> <b>the</b> geological map of the U.S. In 1895, McGee and J.B. Tolbert produced a 1:15,000,000 scale map of the geology of the U.S.|$|E
