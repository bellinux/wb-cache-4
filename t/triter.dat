The Tokargans, after witnessing {{the death of the}} last female of their race, sacrifice themselves to save the Arcadia from the life sucking flames of the Flame Stream Prominence (aka the Owen Stanley Witch of Space). Harlock's lover and voice of the Underground, Maya is killed by Illumidas gunfire. After Harlock has honorably defeated the occupational commander in ship-to-ship combat, the quisling ruler of Earth, <b>Triter,</b> nonetheless declares Harlock and Emeraldas outlaws and exiles them to space. Amidst an Earth that prefers servitude to their new masters over the hard but noble fight for freedom, Harlock, Emeraldas, Tochiro, and their new pirate crew of idealists and romantics set for the stars, heading out for parts unknown.|$|E
40|$|Plant {{species of}} Albiziaceae {{are known for}} their {{traditional}} medicinal uses as medicaments of mind unrest, insomnia, physique damage, carbuncle gall in many parts of tropic zone. Albizia mollis, popularly named “maoyehehuan ” in China, is one of representative plant species of this family. This plant is well known for its sedative and sleeping pill properties. 1 The previous chemical investigation of this family has led to the isolation of lignans, 2 - 5 flavonoids, 6 - 9 saponins, 10 alkaloids, 11 together with other secondary meta-bolites. 12 In search for new and bioactive compounds from medicinal plant, the chemical study on A. mollis, collected from Kunming Botanical Garden, Yunnan Province, Peoples Republic of China, led to the isolation of four saponins including two new ones.

40|$|Stevia rebaudiana leaf was {{investigated}} for it`s proximal composition, mineral content and phytochemical screening. Further, fatty acid analysis of leaf oil was also carried out using gas chromatography. Protein, fat, carbohydrate and ash content {{were found to}} be 20. 42, 4. 34, 35. 20 and 13. 12 g% on dry weight basis, respectively. Mineral analysis showed that the high content of K, Ca, Mg, P, Na and S present in the leaf whereas cobalt, copper, iron, manganese, zinc, selenium and molybdenum found as trace amount. The phytochemical analysis revealed the presence of tannins in high concentration followed by alkaloids, cardiac glycosides, saponins, sterols and <b>triter</b> penes, reducing compounds and anthraquinones. Cyanogenetic glycosides {{were found to be}} absent in the leaf. GC analysis of leaf oil indicated the presence of palmitic, plamitoleic, stearic, oleic, linoleic and linolenic acids.

40|$|Running mean filters {{have long}} been used as time domain, digital, {{low-pass}} filters. They are a convolution in the time domain with a boxcar function (or, more generally, with functions designed for better frequency characteristics). Running means are linear and easily described by their transfer functions in the frequency domain. They handle some kinds of high-frequency contamination well. However, faced with the spikey noise sometimes affecting electronic systems and phenomena subject to interference by lightening, cosmic rays, and timing tick marks running means usually perform poorly: spikes become low, wide, one-sided pulses affecting a broad region of the signal {{in the neighborhood of}} an originally short glitch. Since we can be generally confident of the signal except during the spike itself, a better <b>triter</b> would be one that does not affect the signal outside the spike, but replaces only the bad data with some interpolation of the good data. Stated another way, this filter would do what the human data editor does. Running medians nearly behave like this ideal filter; a simple extension of them is an ideal, general despiker.

40|$|Efficient compact TiO(2) films using {{different}} polyeleetrolytes are {{prepared by the}} layer-by-layer technique (LbL) and applied as an effective contact and blocking film in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs). The polyanion thermal stability {{plays a major role}} on the compact layers, which decreases back electron transfer processes and current losses at the FTO/TiO(2) interface. FESEM images show that polyelectrolytes such is sodium sullonated polystyrene (PSS) and sulfonated lignin (SE), in comparison to poly(acrylic acid) (FAA), ensure an adequate morphology for the LbL TiO(2) layer deposited before the mesoporous film, even <b>triter</b> the sintering step at 450 degrees C. The so treated photoanode in DSCs leads to a 30 % improvement On the overall conversion efficiency. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is employed to ascertain the role of die compact films with such polyelectrolytes. The significant increase in V(oc) of the solar cells with adequate polyelectrolytes in the LbL TiO(2) films shows their pivotal role in decreasing the electron recombination at the FTO surface and enhancing the electrical contact of FTO with the mesoporous TiO(2) layer.

40|$|Molecular fossils record {{aspects of}} Neoproterozoic-Early Cambrian palaeobiology in the Bikaner-Nagaur Basin, western India. Biomarker {{hydrocarbons}} from crude oils and sedimentary rock extracts {{belonging to the}} Marwar Supergroup, India, were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, including molecular specific metastable reaction monitoring (MRM) transitions. The distinctive biomarker assemblage indicates significant contribution from both eukaryotes and bacteria. The steranes record contributions from algae as well as demosponges. Dominance of C- 29 sterane isomers signifies that green algae were important primary producers while detection of traces of dinosteranes suggests input from dinoflagellates or their ancestors. The high C- 30 sterane ratio (24 -isopropylcholestane/ 24 -n-propylcholestane;similar to 5) indicates substantial proliferation of Demospongiae which are widely considered as basal metazoa. The community of algae and other taxa, including sponges which require oxygen, thrived in a thin oxygenated layer in the upper water column. However, {{the presence of an}} underlying euxinic water column is demonstrated by the presence of gammacerane, extremely low values of pristane/phytane (around 0. 4) and carotenoids derived from both green (Chlorobi) and purple (Chromatiaceae) sulfur bacteria. Chlorobactane, isorenieratane and (beta-isorenieratane indicate both green-and brown-pigmented Chlorobi, whereas the detection of okenane and renierapurpurane are diagnostic for the Chromatiaceae. Paleorenieratane, a carotenoid pigment from an apparently 'extinct' Chlorobi taxon is present in high abundance particularly in the sedimentary rock extract. Excellent preservation of the biomarkers and an extremely mild thermal history is indicated by sterane and <b>triter</b> pane molecular ratios with preferences for biological stereoisomers. The entire biomarker assemblage is indicative of a restricted, salinity-stratified depositional environment possibly including the presence of extensive, anoxygenic microbial mats. Some of the observed characteristics mirror those of other coeval successions in Oman, Eastern Siberia and Australia but the particular combination of features appears to be unique to this setting.

40|$|We are {{concerned}} with the design of inhomogeneous, all dielectric (lossless) periodic structures which act as filters. Dielectric filters made as stacks of inhomogeneous gratings and layers of materials are being used in optical technology, but are not common at microwave frequencies. The problem is then finding the periodic cell's geometric configuration and permittivity values which correspond to a specified reflectivity/transmittivity response as a function of frequency/illumination angle. This type of design {{can be thought of as}} an inverse-source problem, since it entails finding a distribution of sources which produce fields (or quantities derived from them) of given characteristics. Electromagnetic sources (electric and magnetic current densities) in a volume are related to the outside fields by a well known linear integral equation. Additionally, the sources are related to the fields inside the volume by a constitutive equation, involving the material properties. Then, the relationship linking the fields outside the source region to those inside is non-linear, in terms of material properties such as permittivity, permeability and conductivity. The solution of the non-linear inverse problem is cast here as a combination of two linear steps, by explicitly introducing the electromagnetic sources in the computational volume as a set of unknowns in addition to the material unknowns. This allows to solve for material parameters and related electric fields in the source volume which are consistent with Maxwell's equations. Solutions are obtained iteratively by decoupling the two steps. First, we invert for the permittivity only in the minimization of a cost function and second, given the materials, we find the corresponding electric fields through direct solution of the integral equation in the source volume. The sources thus computed are used to generate the far fields and the synthesized <b>triter</b> response. The cost function is obtained by calculating the deviation between the synthesized value of reflectivity/transmittivity and the desired one. Solution geometries for the periodic cell are sought as gratings (ensembles of columns of different heights and widths), or combinations of homogeneous layers of different dielectric materials and gratings. Hence the explicit unknowns of the inversion step are the material permittivities and the relative boundaries separating homogeneous parcels of the periodic cell...|$|E
