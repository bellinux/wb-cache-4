5|$|On 19 March 1828, <b>the</b> <b>boiler</b> of {{locomotive}} No. 5 exploded at Simpasture Junction. One {{of the two}} firemen was killed, {{the other}} severely scalded. The driver (George Stephenson's older brother) was unharmed.|$|E
5|$|In {{common with}} the N, N1 and K class locomotives, the Midland Railway {{influence}} of Clayton showed in the placement of locomotive fittings on the production batch, as the water top-feed into <b>the</b> <b>boiler</b> was located inside a dome, whilst the cab area was {{a modified version of}} those on the 0-6-0s of Henry Fowler and the K class rebuilds. The rebuilds had Midland Railway-style double spectacle plates (the small windows on the front face of the cab) left over from the K class cabs, whereas the production versions had one each side of <b>the</b> <b>boiler.</b> Such modifications were becoming typical of the Southern Railway’s attempt to produce a fleet of standardised locomotives. However, all members of the U class were to vary from GWR practice, as the superheating surface area was increased, and all were equipped with outside Walschaerts valve gear.|$|E
5|$|Maintenance problems. The chain driven {{valve gear}} {{proved to be}} {{expensive}} to maintain and subject to rapid wear. Leaks from the oil bath onto the wheels caused oil to splash onto <b>the</b> <b>boiler</b> lagging in service. Once saturated with oil, the lagging attracted coal dust and ash which provided a combustible material, {{and as a result}} of the heavy braking of the locomotives, sparks would set the lagging on fire underneath the air-smoothed casing. The fires were also attributed to oil overflowing from axlebox lubricators onto the wheels when stationary to be flung upwards into <b>the</b> <b>boiler</b> lagging in service. In either case, the local fire brigade would invariably be called to put the fire out, with cold water coming into contact with the hot boiler, causing stress to the casing. Many photographs show an unmodified with 'buckled' (warped) casing, the result of a lagging fire.|$|E
50|$|A tramway was {{constructed}} between the mine and Laverton by the Kalgoorlie and Boulder Firewood company in 1908. The {{purpose was to}} deliver wood for <b>the</b> <b>boilers</b> from surrounding areas to feed <b>the</b> <b>boilers.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{main site}} {{includes}} three boilers, {{two of which}} are located {{to the west of the}} property and a third boiler located approximately ten metres to the east of <b>the</b> first two <b>boilers.</b> Situated around two of <b>the</b> <b>boilers</b> is brick rubble remains, providing evidence for the fireboxes which once surrounded <b>the</b> <b>boilers.</b> <b>The</b> third <b>boiler,</b> to <b>the</b> east, does not have any brick rubble remains surrounding it, indicating that it may have been moved from its original position.|$|R
50|$|Immediately to {{the north}} and south of <b>the</b> <b>boilers</b> are low brick structures, {{approximately}} 1m in height. These comprise the remains of a coal bin, (north) and the condensers and brick flue associated with <b>the</b> <b>boilers</b> (south).|$|R

5|$|On 29 April 1912, SECR F1 class {{locomotive}} No. 216 {{was working}} an empty stock train when it suffered {{the failure of}} the firebox crown near Tunbridge Wells {{due to a lack of}} water in <b>the</b> <b>boiler.</b> Both engine crew were severely injured by escaping steam and jumping from the moving locomotive.|$|E
5|$|On June5, 1908, Sebree {{was nearly}} killed during a speed {{trial of the}} Tennessee {{off the coast of}} California.

Witnesses reported that Sebree and other officers had left <b>the</b> <b>boiler</b> room only 50 seconds earlier.|$|E
50|$|Recycling of hot {{combustion}} {{air from the}} SNOX plants to <b>the</b> <b>boilers</b> in combination with high pressure steam production in the SNOX plants increase the thermal efficiency and output of <b>the</b> <b>boilers,</b> resulting in a proportional reduction in CO2 emission.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>boilers</b> were {{automatically}} controlled, {{and produced}} 110,000 pounds of steam per hour (49,900 kg/h) at 625 psi (4.3 MPa). Fuel {{was moved by}} belt bucket and scraper conveyors to the fuel bunkers, then delivered to <b>the</b> <b>boilers</b> by mechanical spreader stokers.|$|R
5000|$|Boilerman: Though this {{position}} is now obsolete, before the mid-20th century, when most rigs were steam-powered, the boilerman was responsible for <b>the</b> <b>boilers.</b> <b>The</b> boilerman also functioned as the laundryman, steam-cleaning the last crew's greasy work clothes in the [...] "blow barrel" [...] and then hanging them up to dry in the warm air near <b>the</b> <b>boilers.</b>|$|R
5|$|Several of {{the most}} {{successful}} features of the class were used by Drummond on his other designs. Thus <b>the</b> <b>boiler,</b> cylinders and motion were identical and interchangeable with those used on his 700 class 0-6-0 freight locomotives of 1897 and the same boiler was used on his C8 4-4-0 passenger class.|$|E
5|$|Steam is {{provided}} by an elderly Marshall portable boiler– essentially a portable engine without the actual engine. It was built in Gainsborough, Lincolnshire in 1938 before being used by Thames Water as a stand by steam generator. It was given to Kew Bridge Steam Museum (now the London Museum of Water & Steam) before being {{passed on to the}} Westonzoyland Museum and then restored with a grant from the Preservation of Industrial and Scientific Materials Foundation (PRISM). <b>The</b> <b>boiler</b> provides steam at 50 Pounds per square inch (psi) to the other exhibits. It has been fitted with two whistles, one from Wattstown and the other from Ty Mawr Collieries in Wales, both of which were donated by the National Coal Board. Along with <b>the</b> <b>boiler</b> in the outdoor courtyard area are a waterwheel pump unit built by G. H. Harris of Wadebridge, a Lee Howl pump and Lister deep well pump.|$|E
5|$|Still the Commissioners prevaricated, daunted by the {{potential}} costs, estimated by Robert Stevenson at £63,000. They {{set up a}} special Skerryvore Committee, whose members decided to visit the site by steamer to see for themselves. Just off Skerryvore a fire broke out in <b>the</b> <b>boiler</b> room crippling the ship. It was extinguished and no harm was done, but the experience may have been persuasive.|$|E
50|$|As both {{drum and}} tubes are of small diameter, <b>the</b> <b>boilers</b> are also {{suitable}} for high pressure use. However <b>the</b> <b>boilers</b> entered service early on, {{as one of}} the first small-tube water-tube designs and so they have rarely been used for high pressures or with steam turbines.|$|R
25|$|The heating plant: at {{the ground}} floor on via della Ghiacciaia, with two {{technical}} rooms, one for the ashes {{and one for the}} steam accumulators. On the first floor (at rails level), <b>the</b> <b>boilers</b> room and on the second floor the room with the hoppers to feed <b>the</b> <b>boilers.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>boilers</b> began {{operation}} in 1907 and the lift station started to pump {{water from the}} Rio Grande. Wood was used in units of 2 to 3 cords (7 to 11 m³) and a crew of 26 men with teams of mules worked around the clock to keep <b>the</b> <b>boilers</b> fed.|$|R
5|$|The Vobster Breach {{colliery}} had {{a unique}} system of long coking ovens which, {{along with the}} other buildings, have been designated as a Scheduled monument. <b>The</b> <b>boiler</b> chimney of Oxley's Colliery near Buckland Dinham which operated for a few years in the 1880s is a Grade II listed building.|$|E
5|$|The Yugoslav {{emphasis}} on anti-aircraft defense meant that Split {{could only have}} a single funnel to allow the guns as much freedom to fire as possible, which dictated that <b>the</b> <b>boiler</b> rooms were adjacent to the engine room. This meant that a single torpedo hit in the machinery spaces could immobilize the ship.|$|E
5|$|Additional {{exhibits}} {{include two}} small de Laval steam turbines by Greenwood & Batley, {{and a small}} 'Wessex' steam turbine milk bottle washer. A winch used to move railway wagons at Hemyock Dairy near Wellington was built by J. Lynn of Sunderland. There is a runnable Crossley diesel engine dating from 1935. There is a Spirax Sarco 'Ogden pump' used to pump condensate from steam lines. The collection includes <b>the</b> <b>boiler</b> which powered the Telescopic Bridge, Bridgwater.|$|E

Two <b>boiler</b> rooms, each with one triple drum, water-tube boiler, were sited beneath the forward funnel.

50|$|The 2007-08 Purdue Boilermakers men's {{basketball}} team represented Purdue University. The Head Coach was Matt Painter, then in his 3rd season with <b>the</b> <b>Boilers.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Boilers</b> did well at home, going 9-0 in the Big Ten and losing {{only a single}} home game overall (16-1). Purdue {{finished second in the}} Big Ten with a 15-3 record. They lost to Illinois {{in the first round of}} the Big Ten Tournament despite having a #2 seed. <b>The</b> <b>Boilers</b> accepted a bid to the NCAA Tournament where they made it to the second round before losing to Xavier, 78-85.|$|R
5|$|He {{later became}} a steam enthusiast, befriending many of the engine drivers and firemen {{who worked on the}} nearby railway. As a {{teenager}} he met a driver who invited him onto the footplate of his locomotive and who asked him to keep <b>the</b> <b>boiler</b> supplied with fuel. Dibnah became so enamoured with steam engines that he eventually looked for one he could buy. He learnt of a steamroller kept in a barn near Warrington and which the owners had bought from Flintshire County Council. He had <b>the</b> <b>boiler</b> pressure-tested and, despite its being in poor condition, bought it for £175. He towed it to a friend's house, spent a fortnight making various repairs, and drove it to his mother's house in Bolton. After he married and bought his own property on Radcliffe New Road, he cut an access road to the garden of his new house and moved the steamroller there. Restoring the engine took many years, as Dibnah had to create his own replacement parts, using Victorian engineering techniques and equipment he built in his garden. <b>The</b> <b>boiler</b> was in poor condition and needed serious work, but Dibnah fell back on local knowledge and was eventually able to build a new boiler. Once it was restored, he used the 1910 Aveling and Porter steamroller together with a living van he bought and restored, to take his family around the local steam fairs. While driving the vehicle was relatively safe, Dibnah had experienced several mishaps, including one instance when he lost control while descending a steep hill and was forced to drive the engine into a concrete barrier to bring it to a halt, smashing the front fork in the process.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{assessments}} of Belfasts damage showed that, while the mine had done little direct {{damage to the}} outer hull, causing only a small hole directly below one of <b>the</b> <b>boiler</b> rooms, {{the shock of the}} explosion had caused severe warping, breaking machinery, deforming the decks and causing the keel to hog (bend upwards) by three inches. On 4 January 1940 Belfast was decommissioned to Care and Maintenance status, becoming the responsibility of Rosyth Dockyard, and her crew dispersed to other vessels. By 28 June she had been repaired sufficiently to sail to Devonport, arriving on 30 June under the command of Lt Cdr H W Parkinson.|$|E
5|$|On 14 July 1876, Thunderer {{suffered}} a disastrous boiler explosion which killed 45 people. One of her boilers burst as she proceeded from Portsmouth Harbour to Stokes Bay {{to carry out}} a full-power trial. The explosion killed 15 people instantly, including her commanding officer; around 70 others were injured, of whom 30 later died. This was the Royal Navy's most deadly boiler explosion through the whole century. A model representing the failed boiler was made and is now in the Science Museum. The explosion was caused because a pressure gauge was broken and the safety valve had corroded in place. When the steam stop valve to the engines was closed, pressure in <b>the</b> <b>boiler</b> rose and could not be released. The four box boilers were the last in service in the Navy and operated at what would even then would have been considered a relatively low pressure, for more modern boilers, of 30 psi. <b>The</b> <b>boiler</b> was repaired and the ship was completed on 26 May 1877 at a cost of £368,428.|$|E

5|$|Stephenson {{built the}} {{locomotive}} originally as an 0-4-0 (an 0-4-0 is the Whyte notation for a steam locomotive with two powered axles and no unpowered leading or trailing axles). The locomotive's power was {{transmitted to the}} driving axles through pistons that were mounted under <b>the</b> <b>boiler</b> between the two front wheels {{and in front of}} the front axle. These inside cylinders' main rods were connected to a rear crank axle with a connecting rod between the two axles to power the front axle.|$|E
5|$|The 20 {{locomotives}} of {{the first}} production batch were split equally between Brighton and Ashford works, and all were completed by December 1929. The production locomotives had a slightly different profile to the K class rebuilds and featured left-hand drive to improve the visibility of signals from the driver's side of the footplate. They also had higher running plates {{along the sides of}} <b>the</b> <b>boiler</b> than the rebuilds, which required smaller wheel splashers to cover the tops of the driving wheels. Another variation was the flatter top to the dome covers, as the rebuilds retained the high N class type used on the K class.|$|E
