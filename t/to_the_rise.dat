5|$|Approximately 27,000 Boer {{women and}} {{children}} died in British concentration camps, resulting in a long-lasting legacy of bitterness towards the British and claims of genocide of Afrikaners.

5|$|In aristocratic Russian society, {{the greater}} freedoms allowed to women led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> of the powerful, socially-connected woman, {{including}} such iconic figures as Catherine the Great, Maria Naryshkina, and Countess Maria Razumovskaya.

5|$|A {{period of}} {{rebellion}} {{at the start}} of the 19th century led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> of the progressive Sultan Mahmud II and eventually to the Tanzimat period, which produced political reforms and allowed new technology to be introduced to the city. Bridges across the Golden Horn were constructed during this period, and Istanbul was connected to the rest of the European railway network in the 1880s. Modern facilities, such as a water supply network, electricity, telephones, and trams, were gradually introduced to Istanbul over the following decades, although later than to other European cities. The modernization efforts were not enough to forestall the decline of the Ottoman Empire.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the series}} fictionalises {{the world of}} MI5, several storylines are based on truth. The series had advisors who were ex-MI5 officers. The writers also {{research}} heavily on each episode. The producers were keen in world events that Britain and America were directly or indirectly responsible for, where the consequences of an operation are worse than what they intended to resolve in the first place, known as blowback. One example includes the two powers aiding the Afghan Mujahideen in 1989 before {{pulling out of the}} country; this ultimately lead <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> of Al-Qaeda.|$|E

5|$|American {{forces in}} Iraq were {{withdrawn}} {{in large numbers}} in 2009 and 2010, {{and the war in}} the region was declared formally over in December 2011. The withdrawal caused an escalation of sectarian insurgency, leading <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, the successor of al-Qaeda in the region. In 2014, Obama announced a restoration of full diplomatic relations with Cuba {{for the first time since}} 1961. The next year, the United States as a member of the P5+1 countries signed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, an agreement aimed to slow the development of Iran's nuclear program.|$|E
5|$|As Police Commissioner Blamey {{defended the}} actions of the police during the 1928 Waterside Workers' Federation dispute, during which police opened fire, killing a {{striking}} worker who was also a Gallipoli veteran, and wounding several others. His treatment of the unionists was typical of his hard line anti-communist beliefs and as such his relations with left-wing governments were tense. Along with many senior army and ex-army officers, he was a leading member of the clandestine far-right-wing League of National Security. This was reportedly a response <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> of communism in Australia. Its members stood ready to take up arms to stop a Catholic or communist revolution.|$|E
5|$|As a {{consequence}} of 19th-century Romanticism, medieval virtues like chivalry became increasingly popular among the elites. Parallel to this, medieval architecture, primarily Gothic style, returned to public attention in Germany with the unfinished Cologne Cathedral, leading <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> of Gothic Revival architecture. Other notable examples of this romantic infatuation with medieval structures and architecture are the Votive Cathedral of Vienna and Neuschwanstein Castle in Bavaria. This nostalgic longing for the medieval past, spurred on by the works of authors such as Hugh Walpole, Sir Walter Scott, and John Ruskin, meant that architectural had once again turned from the Classical to the Gothic style of architecture.|$|E

Caldwell is most well known for his novels, such as Tobacco Road; however, Kneel <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rising</b> Sun is held in high acclaim by his critics.|$|R
5|$|Bonstelle's Playhouse {{was one of}} America's first civic theaters and, uniquely in the 1920s, a {{profitable}} one. Though it closed in 1933, a year after her death, due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> of the movie industry and the Depression, Wayne State University bought the premises in 1956 {{for the use of}} its theater department, and in 1963 renamed it the Bonstelle Theatre in her memory. Bonstelle's approach gained nationwide attention and she was interviewed by authorities from other cities which wanted information about her plan. Her theater influenced the future Federal Theater Project.|$|E

5|$|During the {{preceding}} Tang dynasty, {{the civil service}} examinations did not yet produce {{the high number of}} officials as they would during the Song dynasty; a hereditary aristocracy remained dependent on the court for attaining rank and holding office. Song rulers, particularly Emperor Huizong, encountered a great deal of political opposition despite attempts to attain the ideals of the sage kings of antiquity. The inability of the sovereign to monopolize political authority was linked <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> of a new class of gentry and scholar-official who filled the bureaucracy.|$|E

The Trail of Tears in the 1830s exemplified the Indian removal policy that resettled Indians into the west on Indian reservations. The U.S. annexed the Republic of Texas in 1845 {{during a period of}} expansionist Manifest destiny. The 1846 Oregon Treaty with Britain led to U.S. control of the present-day American Northwest. Victory in the Mexican–American War resulted in the 1848 Mexican Cession of California and much of the present-day American Southwest.|$|E
5|$|From the mid-20th century, {{the tunnel}} fell into disuse. It became popular with {{homeless}} people and drug users. A police report from around 1950 stated that squatters used the edifice for warmth and shelter from elements, {{as well as}} a hideout and a meeting place. The Yugoslav Government's lack of transparency regarding the tunnel led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> of a number of urban legends, including the purported existence of walled-off corridors leading towards the Croatian Parliament palace on St. Mark's Square (in the centre of Gornji Grad), and towards Zagreb Observatory (the northernmost point of the neighbourhood) and on to Gupčeva Zvijezda.|$|E
5|$|In 280 BC, Pyrrhus {{embarked}} on a campaign in Magna Graecia (i.e. southern Italy) against the Roman Republic known as the Pyrrhic War, followed by his invasion of Sicily. Ptolemy Keraunos secured {{his position on the}} Macedonian throne by giving Pyrrhus five thousand soldiers and twenty war elephants for this endeavor. Pyrrhus returned to Epirus in 275BC after the ultimate failure of both campaigns, which contributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> of Rome because Greek cities in southern Italy such as Tarentum now became Roman allies. Pyrrhus invaded Macedonia in 274BC, defeating the largely mercenary army of AntigonusII at the 274BC Battle of Aous and driving him out of Macedonia, forcing him to seek refuge with his naval fleet in the Aegean.|$|E

5|$|In hip hop culture, a grill (most {{commonly}} referred to as grills), also known as fronts or golds, is a type of jewelry worn over the teeth. Grills are made of metal and are generally removable. They began to be worn by hip-hop artists in New York City in the early 1980s, and upgraded during the '90s in Oakland. They became even more widely popular during the mid-2000s due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> of Southern hip hop rap and the more mainstream pop culture status hip hop attained.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> {{in prices}} – 14% in the twelve months to September 2008, {{compared with a}} target of 2.5% – the Central Bank of Iceland held interest rates high (15.5%). Such high interest rates, compared with 5.5% in the United Kingdom or 4% in the eurozone for example, encouraged overseas investors to hold deposits in Icelandic krónur, leading to monetary inflation: the Icelandic money supply (M3) grew 56.5% in the twelve months to September 2008, compared with 5.0% GDP growth. The situation was effectively an economic bubble, with investors overestimating the true value of the króna.|$|E
5|$|Jerusalem is {{recognized}} as a sacred site in Islam. Though the Quran does not mention Jerusalem by name, it has been understood by Islamic scholars since the earliest times that many passages in the Quran refer to Jerusalem. Jerusalem is also mentioned {{many times in the}} hadith. Some academics attribute the holiness of Jerusalem <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> and expansion of a certain type of literary genre, known as al-Fadhail or history of cities. The Fadhail of Jerusalem inspired Muslims, especially during the Umayyad period, to embellish the sanctity of the city beyond its status in the holy texts. Others point to the political motives of the Umayyad dynasty which led to the sanctification of Jerusalem in Islam.|$|E
