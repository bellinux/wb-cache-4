5|$|Anterior cord syndrome, due {{to damage}} to the front portion of the spinal cord or {{reduction}} in the blood supply from the anterior spinal artery, {{can be caused by}} fractures or dislocations of vertebrae or herniated disks. Below the level of injury, motor function, pain sensation, and temperature sensation are lost, while sense of touch and proprioception (sense of position in space) remain intact. These differences are due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>relative</b> locations of the spinal tracts responsible for each type of function.|$|E
5|$|Bivalves filter {{large amounts}} of water to feed and breathe {{but they are not}} {{permanently}} open. They regularly shut their valves to enter a resting state, even when they are permanently submerged. In oysters, for example, their behaviour follows very strict circatidal and circadian rhythms according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>relative</b> positions of the moon and sun. During neap tides, they exhibit much longer closing periods than during spring tides.|$|E
5|$|Bowie shelved his solo {{career in}} 1989, {{retreating}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>relative</b> anonymity of band membership {{for the first}} time since the early 1970s. A hard-rocking quartet, Tin Machine came into being after Bowie began to work experimentally with guitarist Reeves Gabrels. The line-up was completed by Tony and Hunt Sales, whom Bowie had known since the late 1970s for their contribution, on bass and drums respectively, to Iggy Pop's 1977 album Lust For Life.|$|E

5|$|Of the 640,000 {{individual}} pixels that compose each frame, Earth {{takes up}} less than one (0.12 pixels, according to NASA). The light bands across the photograph are an artifact, the result of sunlight scattering off parts of the camera and its sunshade, due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>relative</b> proximity between the Sun and the Earth. Voyager's point of view was approximately 32° above the ecliptic. Detailed analysis suggested that the camera also detected the Moon, although it is too faint to be visible without special processing.|$|E
5|$|The weather of Mount Washington is {{notoriously}} erratic. This is {{partly due to}} the convergence of several storm tracks, mainly from the Atlantic to the south, the Gulf region and the Pacific Northwest. The vertical rise of the Presidential Range, combined with its north-south orientation, makes it a significant barrier to westerly winds. Low-pressure areas are more favorable to develop along the coastline in the winter due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>relative</b> temperature differences between the Northeastern United States and the Atlantic Ocean. With these factors combined, hurricane-force wind gusts are observed from the summit of the mountain on average of 110 days per year.|$|E

Whether {{or not they are}} employed by the police or the State, forensic doctors must understand their obligations to justice (not <b>to</b> <b>the</b> police or <b>the</b> State) and <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>relatives</b> of <b>the</b> deceased, so that a true account is provided of the cause of death and the circumstances surrounding it.|$|R
5|$|After Kidd's {{arrival in}} Boston on 3 July, Bellomont demanded from Kidd a written {{account of his}} travels, which Kidd, after haggling over the time, agreed to deliver {{on the morning of}} 6 July. When he did not do so, Bellomont issued a warrant for his arrest. It was {{executed}} as Kidd was en route to see Bellomont at midday the same day. Kidd then attempted to negotiate his freedom, using the secret locations of his treasure and a captured prize ship as bargaining chips. Although a portion of Kidd's treasure was recovered, it did not buy Kidd's freedom, and he was shipped to London in April 1700, where he was tried, convicted, and hanged. In contrast <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>relative</b> secrecy with which he conducted some of his communications with Kidd, Bellomont was scrupulous in his dealings with other potentially questionable merchant and pirate business, despite being offered as much as £5,000 to overlook illicit activities.|$|E
5|$|As more middle-class and {{affluent}} people {{fled the}} city <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>relative</b> quiet and open {{spaces of the}} suburbs, the urban centers deteriorated and lost population. At {{the same time that}} cities were experiencing a lower tax base due to the flight of higher income earners, pressures from The New Deal forced them to offer pensions and other benefits, increasing the average cost of benefits per employee by 1,629percent. This was in addition to hiring an average of 20percent more employees to serve the ever shrinking cities. More Americans were driving cars and fewer were using public transportation, and it was not practical to extend to the suburbs. At the same time, the number of surface roads exploded to serve the ever-increasing numbers of individually owned cars, further burdening city and country resources. During this time, the perception of using public transportation turned more negative. In what is arguably the most extreme example, Detroit, the fifth largest city in the United States in 1950 with 1,849,568 residents, had shrunk to 706,585 by 2010, a reduction of 62 percent.|$|E
5|$|By 19:30, the High Seas Fleet, {{which was}} {{by that point}} {{pursuing}} the British battlecruisers, had not yet encountered the Grand Fleet. Scheer had been considering retiring his forces before darkness exposed his ships to torpedo boat attack. He had not yet made a decision when his leading battleships encountered {{the main body of}} the Grand Fleet. This development made it impossible for Scheer to retreat, for doing so would have sacrificed the slower pre-dreadnought battleships of the II Battle Squadron, while using his dreadnoughts and battlecruisers to cover their retreat would have subjected his strongest ships to overwhelming British fire. Instead, Scheer ordered his ships to turn 16 points to starboard, which would bring the pre-dreadnoughts <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>relative</b> safety of the disengaged side of the German battle line.|$|E

5|$|Cerium(IV) aqueous {{solutions}} may {{be prepared}} by reacting cerium(III) solutions {{with the strong}} oxidising agents peroxodisulfate or bismuthate. The value of E⦵(Ce4+/Ce3+) varies widely depending on conditions due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>relative</b> ease of complexation and hydrolysis with various anions, though +1.72V is a usually representative value; that for E⦵(Ce3+/Ce) is −2.34V. Cerium is the only lanthanide which has important aqueous and coordination chemistry in the +4 oxidation state. Due to ligand-to-metal charge transfer, aqueous cerium(IV) ions are orange-yellow. Aqueous cerium(IV) is metastable in water and is a strong oxidising agent that oxidizes hydrochloric acid to give chlorine gas. For example, ceric ammonium nitrate is a common oxidising agent in organic chemistry, releasing organic ligands from metal carbonyls. In the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction, cerium oscillates between the +4 and +3 oxidation states to catalyse the reaction. Cerium(IV) salts, especially cerium(IV) sulfate, are often used as standard reagents for volumetric analysis in cerimetric titrations.|$|E
5|$|III. Menuetto: Allegro – Trio. This is {{a somber}} movement, quite {{distinct}} from the typical atmosphere of dance movements. It is relatively conservative in its key scheme, moving <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>relative</b> major key {{and back to the}} tonic. In the B section, a sequence of hemiolas is interrupted by a dramatic interpolation in A-flat major, referencing the departure to this key in the opening of the Allegro with the added minor 6th. The second A section is a transformation of the first, interrupted every four bars by a silent bar, creating a mysterious atmosphere. The trio is in A-flat major, ternary form, with a B section beginning in E-flat major colored by its own minor 6th, and modulating to G-flat major via the parallel minor.|$|E
5|$|In America, {{neoconservative}} {{aspirations to}} use the United States' military power to further destroy evildoers are thrown off track by the election of George H. W.

The neoconservatives, along with their conservative Christian allies, attempt to demonize Clinton throughout his presidency with various real and fabricated stories of corruption and immorality. To their disappointment, the American people do not turn against Clinton. Meanwhile, Islamist attempts at revolution end in massive bloodshed, leaving the Islamists without popular support. Zawahiri and bin Laden flee <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>relative</b> safety of Afghanistan and declare a new strategy.

5|$|Knox {{had avoided}} being arrested by Lord Bothwell through Wishart's advice {{to return to}} tutoring. He took shelter with Douglas in Longniddry. Several months later {{he was still in}} charge of the pupils, the sons of Douglas and Cockburn, who wearied of moving from place to place while being pursued. He {{toyed with the idea of}} fleeing to Germany and taking his pupils with him. While Knox {{remained}} a fugitive, Beaton was murdered on 29 May 1546, within his residence, the Castle of St Andrews, by a gang of five persons in revenge for Wishart's execution. The assassins seized the castle and eventually their families and friends took refuge with them, about a hundred and fifty men in all. Among their friends was Henry Balnaves, a former secretary of state in the government, who negotiated with England for the financial support of the rebels. Douglas and Cockburn suggested to Knox to take their sons <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>relative</b> safety of the castle to continue their instruction in reformed doctrine. Knox arrived at the castle on 10 April 1547.|$|E

5|$|On 9 April 1940, neutral Denmark was {{invaded by}} Nazi Germany and was {{occupied}} {{for the rest}} of World War II. As Olga's sons, Tikhon and Guri, served as officers in the Danish Army, they were interned as prisoners of war, but their imprisonment in a Copenhagen hotel lasted less than two months. Other Russian émigrés, keen to fight against the Soviets, enlisted in the German forces. Despite her sons' internment and her mother's Danish origins, Olga was implicated in her compatriots' collusion with German forces, as she continued to meet and extend help to Russian émigrés fighting against communism. After the surrender of Germany in 1945, the Soviet Union wrote to the Danish government accusing the Grand Duchess of conspiracy against the Soviet authorities. With the end of the war, Soviet troops occupied the easternmost part of Denmark, and Olga grew fearful of an assassination or kidnap attempt.
