500|$|Allegations of sexism {{occurred}} {{following a}} statement by Lino DiSalvo, the film's head of animation, who said to Fan Voice's Jenna Busch: [...] "Historically speaking, animating female characters are really, really difficult, {{because they have to}} go through these range of emotions, but you have to keep them pretty." [...] However, a Disney spokesperson later told Time that DiSalvo's quote was widely misinterpreted, stating that he was [...] "describing some technical aspects of CG animation and not making a general comment on animating females versus males or other characters." [...] Director Lee also said that DiSalvo's words were recklessly taken out of context, and that he was talking in very technical terms about CG animation. [...] "It is hard no matter what the gender is. I felt horrible for him," [...] she said. In an August 2014 interview, DiSalvo re-emphasized what he had been trying to explain all along when his statements were taken out of context– the difficulty with turning any kind of animated character from a series of sketches on a 2D emotion model sheet into a properly rigged 3D character model: [...] "Translating that emotional range onto a CG character {{is one of the most}} difficult parts of the process. Male. Female. Snowman. Animal." [...] He added, [...] "The really sad thing is people took that... catchy headline and they just repopulated it everywhere. People didn't get back to me for comments and <b>the</b> <b>sad</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> that's the way the internet works. They don't want the truth." ...|$|E
2500|$|Scholars {{and authors}} have also commented on these changes. Southern Methodist University's Director of Medieval Studies Bonnie Wheeler is [...] "convinced {{that the new}} Robert Zemeckis movie {{treatment}} sacrifices {{the power of the}} original for a plot line that propels Beowulf into seduction by Angelina Jolie—the mother of the monster he has just slain. What man doesn’t get involved with Angelina Jolie?' Wheeler asks. 'It’s a great cop-out on a great poem.' ... 'For me, <b>the</b> <b>sad</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> the movie returns to…a view of the horror of woman, the monstrous female who will kill off the male,' Wheeler says. 'It seems to me you could do so much better now. And the story of Beowulf is so much more powerful.'" [...] Other commentators pointed to the theories elucidated in John Grigsby's work Beowulf and Grendel, where Grendel's mother was linked with the ancient Germanic fertility goddess Nerthus.|$|E

50|$|Regarding {{to their}} first album, {{according}} to Ein, initially Brain Dead was planning to add some keyboards, effects and intro/outro for the album for a more atmospherically touch of pure darkness! But <b>the</b> <b>saddest</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was,</b> they were never allowed {{to do that because}} Dark Journey Records wanted to cut costs. They were the third death metal band to record an album after Suffercation's 'Day of Darkness' and Silent Death's 'Before The Sunrise' were recorded in the very same year. They aggressively promoted the album by annihilating as many stage shows as they could and by doing interviews for both local and international zines. In early 1993, they participated in compilation album called 'Dark Live Collection' together with Silent Death, Nemesis, Catarrh, Nebiras and Tormentor. Two new hellish tracks were recorded, 'The 7th Winds' and 'Spirit of Heloisa' where it's still in the dark vein of 'From The Ecstasy'. These two songs were also released in form of a promo tape and has been spread mostly for overseas.|$|R
60|$|Chuang Tzu, {{whose name}} must {{carefully}} be pronounced {{as it is}} not written, {{was born in the}} fourth century before Christ, by the banks of the Yellow River, in the Flowery Land; and portraits of the wonderful sage seated on the flying dragon of contemplation may still be found on the simple tea- trays and pleasing screens of many of our most respectable suburban households. The honest ratepayer and his healthy family have no doubt often mocked at the dome-like forehead of the philosopher, and laughed over the strange perspective of the landscape that lies beneath him. If they really knew who he was, they would tremble. For Chuang Tzu spent his life in preaching the great creed of Inaction, and in pointing out the uselessness of all useful things. 'Do nothing, and everything will be done,' was the doctrine which he inherited from his great master Lao Tzu. To resolve action into thought, and thought into abstraction, was his wicked transcendental aim. Like the obscure philosopher of early Greek speculation, he believed in the identity of contraries; like Plato, he was an idealist, and had all the idealist's contempt for utilitarian systems; he was a mystic like Dionysius, and Scotus Erigena, and Jacob Bohme, and held, with them and with Philo, that the object of life was to get rid of self-consciousness, and to become the unconscious vehicle of a higher illumination. In fact, Chuang Tzu may be said to have summed up in himself almost every mood of European metaphysical or mystical thought, from Heraclitus down to Hegel. There was something in him of the Quietist also; and in his worship of Nothing he may be said to have in some measure anticipated those strange dreamers of mediaeval days who, like Tauler and Master Eckhart, adored the purum nihil and the Abyss. The great middle classes of this country, to whom, as we all know, our prosperity, if not our civilisation, is entirely due, may shrug their shoulders over all this and ask, {{with a certain amount of}} reason, what is the identity of contraries to them, and why they should get rid of that self-consciousness which is their chief characteristic. But Chuang Tzu was something more than a metaphysician and an illuminist. He sought to destroy society, as we know it, as the middle classes know it; and <b>the</b> <b>sad</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> that he combines with the passionate eloquence of a Rousseau the scientific reasoning of a Herbert Spencer. There is nothing of the sentimentalist in him. He pities the rich more than the poor, if he ever pities at all, and prosperity seems to him as tragic a thing as suffering. He has nothing of the modern sympathy with failures, nor does he propose that the prizes should always be given on moral grounds to those who come in last in the race. It is the race itself that he objects to; and as for active sympathy, which has become the profession of so many worthy people in our own day, he thinks that trying to make others good is as silly an occupation as 'beating a drum in a forest in order to find a fugitive.' It is a mere waste of energy. That is all. While, as for a thoroughly sympathetic man, he is, in the eyes of Chuang Tzu, simply a man who is always trying to be somebody else, and so misses the only possible excuse for his own existence.|$|E

According {{to his brother}} Paul, {{the cause of death}} was heart failure. Also according to Paul, Joe was never healthy again after being in the NFL after having many surgeries and complications from his injuries sustained while playing. Tofflemire injured a shoulder at Arizona that suffered further pounding in the pros. There would be nine surgeries for that, over time, including a replacement. Four screws were implanted to keep his spine in place. Concussions, not remotely the red flag they are now, were sustained and likely unreported. These things impacted the rest of his life,” Paul Tofflemire said. “He was always in pain. He couldn’t be active and his weight was up to 300 pounds plus. <b>The</b> <b>sad</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> watching him get out of bed.

50|$|The {{strengths}} of Govan's game were hard work, pace {{on the wing}} and exceptional goalscoring ability. In April 1956, his ability was recognised by the national selectors when he received his only call-up to the full Scotland squad for a match against Austria. Unfortunately for him the international match was due to be played only {{three days before the}} Cup Final, so Birmingham refused to release him. The following season, he was Birmingham's leading scorer with 30 goals in all competitions.

She wrote, [...] "Peirce ... covers an {{extraordinary amount of}} territory, not just in terms of dealing with Brandon’s sexual-identity and self-fulfillment issues, but also in trying to understand the lives of those around him". Zacharek described Swank's performance as [...] "a continual revelation" [...] and Sevigny's performance as [...] "transformative". She said, [...] "When Brandon dies, [...] "Boys Don’t Cry" [...] reaches an emotional intensity that’s almost operatic. <b>The</b> <b>saddest</b> <b>thing,</b> though, <b>is</b> seeing Sevigny’s Lana crumpled over his corpse—the way she plays it, you know that when Brandon went, he took a part of her with him, too". David Edelstein of Slate was also very positive towards the film, calling it [...] "a meditation on the irrelevance of gender." [...] He went on to praise Swank, Sevigny, and Sarsgaard in their roles, especially Sevigny, writing that she [...] "keeps the movie tantalizing".|$|R

50|$|The album Gaddar {{remained}} as the least selling {{and the least}} known album of Erkin Koray. Then a disappointing follow-up with the name Çukulatam Benim came onto the market. The period was the years when arabesque was dominating all music world. Koray also {{was caught up in}} this trend in the album Çukulatam Benim. He was very good at arabesque, but the understanding of arabesque was a bit problematic in this album. <b>The</b> <b>sad</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> that the song Sana Bir şeyler Olmuş once composed as rock song was added to the album with a arabesque name “Na Na Nay Nom” and a terrible performance. At one time the man, who used to play Mesafeler for John Lennon with his own guitar, was now composing strange songs like “Turgay Hesabı Kim Ödeyecek”. Later on this album, no matter what it is, was published again with the name Erkin Koray Meyhanede (Zaten Hiç Çıkmadıki), which was in an unacceptable way, under the name of one of Turkey’s best artist. The part “Zaten hiç Çıkmadıki” caused many problems and end up in court many times. Later the company went bankrupt and this was an end to this chase and escape. Çukulatam Benim (My Chocolate) claimed its place as the most interesting album in Erkin Koray’s life.|$|E

M. Suganth from The Times of India gave it 4 out of 5 and claimed that Saattai was a [...] "commercial potboiler dressed up as arty fare". The reviewer further wrote: [...] "Anbazhagan's intentions are quite commendable ... but <b>the</b> <b>sad</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> that he goes about this task with less subtlety and more sermonizing, {{with the result that}} the scenes where he wishes to make a point come across as totally preachy". Similarly, Malathi Rangarajan from The Hindu wrote: [...] "The aim is lofty, the theme, noble. It is in execution that director Anbazhagan falters a little". She concluded that the film was [...] "at times obviously sermonising" [...] but [...] "still ... worthy of notice". Behindwoods's reviewer gave it 2 out of 5 and noted: [...] "The preachy dialogues in the film are what students listen to in real life.

60|$|Mrs. Thornbury {{agreed with}} him {{that they had been}} very careless, {{and that there was no}} reason {{whatever}} to think that she had caught the fever on the expedition; and after talking about other things for a short time, she left him and went sadly along the passage to her own room. There must be some reason why such things happen, she thought to herself, as she shut the door. Only at first it was not easy to understand what it was. It seemed so strange--so unbelievable. Why, only three weeks ago--only a fortnight ago, she had seen Rachel; when she shut her eyes she could almost see her now, the quiet, shy girl who was going to be married. She thought of all that she would have missed had she died at Rachel's age, the children, the married life, the unimaginable depths and miracles that seemed to her, as she looked back, to have lain about her, day after day, and year after year. The stunned feeling, which had been making it difficult for her to think, gradually gave way to a feeling of the opposite nature; she thought very quickly and very clearly, and, looking back over all her experiences, tried to fit them into a kind of order. There was undoubtedly much suffering, much struggling, but, on the whole, surely there was a balance of happiness--surely order did prevail. Nor were the deaths of young people really <b>the</b> <b>saddest</b> <b>things</b> in life--they <b>were</b> saved so much; they kept so much.

He was generous, and the needy, laughing at him because he believed so naively their stories of distress, borrowed from him with effrontery. He was very emotional, yet his feeling, so easily aroused, had in it something absurd, so that you accepted his kindness, but felt no gratitude. To take money from him was like robbing a child, and you despised him because he was so foolish. I imagine that a pickpocket, proud of his light fingers, must feel a sort of indignation with the careless woman who leaves in a cab a vanity-bag with all her jewels in it. Nature had made him a butt, but had denied him insensibility. He writhed under the jokes, practical and otherwise, which were perpetually made at his expense, and yet never ceased, it seemed wilfully, to expose himself to them. He was constantly wounded, and yet his good-nature was such that he could not bear malice: the viper might sting him, but he never learned by experience, and had no sooner recovered from his pain than he tenderly placed it once more in his bosom. His life was a tragedy written in the terms of knockabout farce. Because I did not laugh at him he was grateful to me, and he used to pour into my sympathetic ear the long list of his troubles. <b>The</b> <b>saddest</b> <b>thing</b> about them <b>was</b> that they were grotesque, and the more pathetic they were, the more you wanted to laugh.|$|R

40|$|The "Orchid Pavilion（Lanting 蘭亭) " is a {{beautiful}} landscape garden in China where a historically famous gathering called the "Lantei no Utage（蘭亭の宴）" (making-poetly banquet at the stream in a garden) was held by Wang Xizhi（王義之), the great Chinese calligrapher. The Chinese theme of Lanting associated {{with the creation of}} calligraphy {{became one of the most}} popular painting themes in Japan during the Edo period. The gathering took place on the third day of the third month, the Ninth Year of the Everlasting Harmony（永和）Period of the Eastern Jin（東晋）Dynasty（i. e., 353 CE). A Chinese painting of the "Orchid Pavilion Paintings”（蘭亭曲水図）refers to this gathering in a pictorial form. According to Chronicles of Japan（日本書紀巻 2 : Nihon Shoki in the 2 nd Volume), certain documents describe "Kyokusui no Utage”（曲水の宴: literally, riverside banquet as a court ceremony), which was held on March 3 rd, Joshi（上巳), when Emperor Kenzo was in the first year of his accession. However, this historical fact has not been verified. Eventually, in the Heian period, the "Kyokusui no Utage" was held as an annual event of poetry festivals in the lmperial Court sponsored by the Emperor. This paper discusses the major works of the "Orchid Pavilion Paintings" （蘭亭図）by Uragami Shunkin（浦上春琴), who was a Japanese painter of the late Edo period, and the painting theme of Orchid Pavilion is also considered for discussion. Furthermore, this paper analyzes how the distinct iconography of "Lanting" originated in China was introduced to Japan and accepted by Japanese painters throughout artistic changes or cultural transfbrmation over the years. Last but not least，the Wang Xizhi's spirit seen in his "Preface to the Orchid Pavilion Poems" （蘭亭序）should be worthy of special attention, although his preface was totally inappropriate on pleasant occasions such as a banquet. His immortal preface goes: Although the span of men's life may be longer or shorter, <b>the</b> <b>sad</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> that all must end in death. People are moved with Shunkin's paintings entitled "Orchid Pavilion Paintings", which reveal beauty in transforming things instead of eternal beings．文部科学省グローバルCOEプログラム 関西大学文化交渉学教育研究拠点東アジアの言語と表...|$|E

6000|$|My dearest Mrs. Martin,--It seemed long to me {{that you}} had not written, and it seems long to me now that I have not {{answered}} the kind letter which came at last. Then Henrietta told me of your being unwell at the moment of her mad excursion into Herefordshire. Altogether I want to speak to you and hear from you, and shall be easier and gladder when both are done. Do forgive my sins and write directly, and tell me everything about both of you, and how you are in spirits and health, and whether you really make up your minds to see more danger in the stormy influences of the Continent in the moral point of view than in those of England in the physical. For my part I hold to my original class of fear, and would rather face two or three revolutions than an east wind of an English winter. If I were you I would go to Pau as usual and take poor Abd-el-Kader's place (my husband is furious about the treatment of Abd-el-Kader, so I hear a good deal about him[183]), or I would go to Italy and try Florence, where really democratic ministries roar as gently as sucking doves, particularly when they are safe in place. We have listened to dreadful rumours--Florence was to have been sacked several times by the Livornese; the Grand Duke {{went so far as to}} send away his family to Siena, and we had 'Morte a Fiorentini!' chalked up on the walls. Still, somehow or other, the peace has been kept in Florentine fashion; it has rained once or twice, which is always enough here to moderate the most revolutionary when they wear their best surtouts, and I look forward to an unbroken tranquillity just as I used to do, even though the windows of the Ridolfi Palace (the ambassador in London) were smashed the other evening a few yards from ours. Perhaps a gentle and affectionate approach to contempt for our Florentines mixes a little with this feeling of security, but what then? They are an amiable, refined, graceful people, with much of the artistic temperament as distinguished from that of men of genius--effeminate, no, rather feminine in a better sense--of a fancy easily turned into impulse, but with no strenuous and determinate strength in them. What they comprehend best in the 'Italian League' is probably a league to wear silk velvet and each a feather in his hat, to carry flags and cry vivas, and keep a grand festa day in the piazzas. Better and happier in this than in stabbing prime ministers, or hanging up their dead bodies to shoot at; and not much more childish than these French patriots and republicans, who crown their great deeds by electing to the presidency such a man as Prince Louis Napoleon, simply because 'C'est le neveu de son oncle!'[184] A curious precedent for a president, certainly; but, oh heavens and earth, what curious things abroad everywhere just now, inclusive of the sea serpent! I agree with you that much of all is very melancholy and disheartening, though holding fast by my hope and belief that good will be the end, as it always is God's end to man's frenzies, and that all we observe is but the fermentation necessary to the new wine, which presently we shall drink pure. Meanwhile, <b>the</b> <b>saddest</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> impossibility (which I, for one, feel) to sympathise, to go along with, the people to whom and to whose cause all my natural sympathies yearn. The word 'Liberty' ceases to make me thrill, as at something great and unmistakable, as, for instance, the other great words Truth, and Justice; do. The salt has lost its savour, the meaning has escaped from the term; we know nothing of what people will do when they aspire to Liberty. The holiness of liberty is desecrated by the sign of the ass's hoof. Fixed principles, either of opinion or action, seem clearly gone out of the world. The principle of Destruction is in the place of the principle of Re-integration, or of Radical Reform, as we called it in England. I look all round and can sympathise nowhere. The rulers hold by rottenness, and the people leap into the abyss, and nobody knows why this is, or why that is. As to France, my tears (which I really couldn't help at the time of the expulsion of poor Louis Philippe and his family, not being very strong just then) are justified, it appears, though my husband thought them foolish (and so did I), and though we both began by an adhesion to the Republic in the cordial manner. But, just see, the Republic was a 'man in an iron mask' or helmet, and turns out a military dictatorship, a throttling of the press, a starving of the finances, and an election of Louis Napoleon to be President. Louis Philippe was better than all this, take him at worst, and at worst he did not deserve the mud and stones cast at him, which I have always maintained and maintain still. England might have got up ('happy country') more crying grievances than France at the moment of outbreak; but what makes outbreaks now-a-days is not 'the cause, my soul,' but the stuff of the people. You are huckaback on the other side of the Channel, and you wear out the poor Irish linen, let the justice of the case be what it may. Politics enough and too much, surely, especially now when they are depressing to you, and more or less to everybody.... We are still in the slow agonies of furnishing our apartment. You see, being the poorest and most prudent of possible poets, we had to solve the problem of taking our furniture out of our year's income (proceeds of poems and the like), and of not getting into debt. Oh, I take no credit to myself; I was always in debt in my little way ('small im morals,' as Dr. Bowring might call it) before I married, but Robert, though a poet and dramatist by profession, being descended from the blood of all the Puritans, and educated by the strictest of dissenters, has a sort of horror about the dreadful fact of owing five shillings five days, which I call quite morbid in its degree and extent, and which is altogether unpoetical according to the traditions of the world. So we have been dragging in by inches our chairs and tables throughout the summer, and by no means look finished and furnished at this late moment, the slow Italians coming at the heels of our slowest intentions with the putting up of our curtains, which begin to be necessary in this November tramontana. Yet in a month or three weeks we shall look quite comfortable--before Christmas; and in the meantime we heap up the pine wood and feel perfectly warm with these thick palace walls between us and the outside air. Also my husband's new edition is on the edge of coming out, and we have had an application from Mr. Phelps, of Sadler's Wells, for leave to act his 'Blot on the 'Scutcheon,' which, if it doesn't succeed, its public can have neither hearts nor intellects (that being an impartial opinion), and which, if it succeeds, will be of pecuniary advantage to us. Look out in the papers.... My love and my husband's go to you, our dear friends. Let me be always ...|$|R
