5|$|The initial event {{caused a}} number of wood framed homes in Scotia to come off their {{foundations}} while the porches of some other homes became detached. The 25MW cogeneration plant there that used wood waste products to power both the lumber company and the town suffered damage and both lumber mills were shut down for several weeks. In Rio Dell, across the Eel River from Scotia, glass store fronts along the main street were shattered and numerous buildings slipped into a culvert along Monument Road. In Petrolia (the small community closest to the epicenter) <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>store</b> (combined with a post office and gas station) was destroyed by fire, and in Fortuna, damage totaled $4 million. A six figure portion of that figure was due to losses at the high school's gymnasium.|$|E

25|$|A {{general store}} is a store that {{supplies}} the main {{needs of the}} local community and is often located in outback or rural areas with low population densities. In areas of very low population density, a general store {{may be the only}} retail outlet within hundreds of miles. <b>The</b> <b>general</b> <b>store</b> carries a very broad product assortmentâ€“ from foodstuffs and pharmaceuticals through to hardware and fuel. In addition, a general store may provide essential services such as postal services, banking services, news agency services and may also act as an agent for farm equipment and stock-food suppliers.|$|E
25|$|The station {{developed}} {{as the center}} of the community at Ljan. It was located close to <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>store,</b> while the post office was operated as part of the railway station. There was a newspaper kiosk at the station. A small garden was kept by the railway company {{at the southern end of}} the station. This was frequently used as a playground. Initially there were four daily trains per direction per day, with a twenty-minute travel time to Oslo. Throughout the 1890s the population increased, leading to a steady increase in the number of commuter trains to Lian. By 1893 there were 17 trains per direction per day. By 1894 the population at Ljan had reached 430.|$|E
25|$|Agriculture {{also played}} an {{important}} part in Waterford's economic history. Kilmeadan about 5km from the city was also home to a very successful co-operative. The farmers of the area benefited greatly from the sale of their produce (mostly butter and milk) to the co-op. In 1964, all of the co-ops in Waterford amalgamated, and was registered as Waterford Co-op. This led to the construction of a cheese factory on a green field site opposite <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>store,</b> and Kilmeadan cheese was {{to become one of the}} most recognised and successful cheddar brands in the world. This is evident as the brand won a gold and bronze medal in the World Cheese Awards in London in 2005.|$|E

25|$|Restoration of {{the mill}} began in earnest in May 2007 with Tracy Wells as foreman of the project for Pritchett Brothers. The first task was to remove the old equipment, tools, and the {{remaining}} features of <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>store</b> and fabric-making, including two carding machines. The old turbines were cleaned, and the stone foundation was repaired by lifting the mill from its moorings. In September 2007 the outside work was stopped for the year. The mill workings, currently held in storage at Salem, were re-installed in the spring 2008. A grand opening {{of the mill}} is planned for the fall of 2008, {{in time for the}} 200th anniversary of the first Beck's Mill.|$|E
25|$|The {{story begins}} in Dakota Territory at the Ingalls {{homestead}} in South Dakota {{on a hot}} September day in 1880 as Laura and her father ("Pa") are haying. Pa tells Laura that he knows the winter {{is going to be}} hard because muskrats always build a house with thick walls before a hard winter, and this year, they have built the thickest walls he has ever seen. In mid-October, the Ingalls wake with an unusually early blizzard howling around their poorly insulated claim shanty. Soon afterward, Pa receives another warning from an unexpected source: a dignified old Native American man comes to <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>store</b> in town to warn the white settlers that there will be seven months of blizzards. Impressed, Pa decides to move the family into town for the winter.|$|E
25|$|Eighteen days later, when a {{blizzard}} hits, the group uses the whiteout {{to go to}} <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>store</b> for supplies, but are stranded after it ends. While the group heads for the station, Eben creates a diversion by having the vampires chase him to his grandmother's house, where he uses one of her ultraviolet lights to burn the face of Marlow's lover, Iris (Megan Franich), so badly that Marlow is forced to kill her. As he escapes, the town snow plow operator, Beau (Mark Boone Junior), creates another distraction with his tractor, killing many of the vampires, before trying to blow himself up; when he fails, Marlow crushes his head. Eben arrives at the station, where he is then forced to kill Carter (Nathaniel Lees), who has been bitten and is turning into a vampire.|$|E

25|$|The {{explosives}} fail to {{kill the}} rabbits, and that night they attack Cole's ranch, killing Jud while Cole, Frank, Jackie, and Cole's housekeeper escape into the storm shelter. The rabbits {{make their way to}} <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>store,</b> killing housekeeper Mildred (Francesca Jarvis) and eating everybody else {{in the small town of}} Galanos they find before taking refuge in the buildings for the day. In the morning, Gerry and Amanda leave to avoid the coming press but get stuck along a sandy stretch of road. Roy and Elgin update Sheriff Cody (Paul Fix) on the situation and, after realizing the rabbits have escaped the mine, call in the National Guard. As night falls, the rabbits leave Galanos to continue the rampage, making their way to the main town of Ajo and eating and killing everybody in their pathway. Cole proposes using a half-mile wide stretch of electrified railroad track as a fence to contain and kill the rabbits. They recruit a large group of people at a drive in theater to help herd the rabbits with their car lights, with assistance from the machine gun fire of the National Guard.|$|E
