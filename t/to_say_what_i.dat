500|$|Bedingfield began {{recording}} {{her debut}} album in mid-2003, following {{the signing of}} a recording contract with Sony BMG earlier that year. She {{was determined not to}} be shaped into [...] "some music biz pigeonhole" [...] and wanted to write songs that were [...] "organic, different and real". Bedingfield began collaborating with Steve Kipner, Andrew Frampton and Wayne Wilkins in London and Los Angeles, but their sessions were largely unproductive due to Bedingfield's writer's block and the pressure that she felt to produce a hit song. Frustrated, she began to sing [...] "I love you, I love you, I love you" [...] over and over. She was at [...] "wit's end and just wanted <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> meant in a simple way, without using all those flowery words." [...] The line that Bedingfield sang out of frustration became the song's hook and its subject matter inspired by her real life difficulty writing a love song.|$|E
500|$|After Louisbourg, {{the company}} was {{stationed}} first at Fort Frederick (Saint John, New Brunswick), and then at Fort St. Anne, where {{the company was}} part of a campaign against Indians and Acadians that had taken refuge there from the ongoing expulsion of the Acadians. [...] These raids were sometimes quite brutal; the company was known to scalp Acadian settlers. [...] In one particularly brutal incident, Hazen was responsible for the scalping of six men, and the burning of four others, along with two women and three children, in a house he set on fire. [...] Joseph Bellefontaine, a leader of the local militia and the father of one of the women, claimed that he was forced to witness this event in an attempt to coerce his cooperation with the rangers. [...] (Bellefontaine escaped into the woods with two of his grandchildren.) [...] General Jeffrey Amherst, who did not hear of the incident until after he had promoted Hazen to captain, noted, [...] "I am sorry that <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have since heard of that affair has sullied his merit with me as I shall always disapprove of killing women and helpless children." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ringo Starr met {{songwriter}} Dean Grakal at a {{party on}} New Year's Eve 1996, during which the pair had a discussion about songwriting, with Grakal proposing that they form a team with Mark Hudson, whom Starr had met years prior while Starr was working on Time Takes Time (1992). Starr spoke of the writing process {{in an interview with}} Billboard magazine: [...] "This is the first time I've really been involved [...] Whereas before, I'd just sort of pick out other people's songs or songs other people had written that I thought were vaguely trying <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> would have liked to say, on this, we're really trying <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> want to say, thank you." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Reuters, Rowling was {{surprised}} over the fuss and {{declined to say}} whether her [...] "outing" [...] of Dumbledore might alienate those who disapprove of homosexuality. [...] "It has certainly never been news {{to me that a}} brave and brilliant man could love other men. He is my character. He is what he is and I have the right <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> say about him," [...] she said. Reaction has been mainly supportive on fans' Web sites, such as The Leaky Cauldron and MuggleNet.|$|E
2500|$|On 21 January 2007 Green met Paul Murdoch in a Pan Asian Boxing Association light-heavyweight bout at the State Netball and Hockey Centre in Melbourne. Green floored Murdoch in {{the first}} round [...] "with a double left jab and then ended the fight 65 seconds into the second round with a left hook." [...] Following the fight, Green stated [...] "Tonight I think I showed my best is {{definitely}} not past me", and regarding a rematch with Mundine, Green said [...] "I'm going <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> feel and I think the re-match is imminent." ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{could have}} done lots more, put in much more work and {{developed}} more pictures, but I had also a desire <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> felt about life. Simple things like a little picture in the window or {{the corner of the}} studio or an old stove in the kitchen have always been fascinating to me. They are very much alive, these flowers and grasses with the dew on them. Stieglitz always said, [...] "What have you got to say?" [...] I think in a few small cases I've said a few things, expressed how I felt, trying to show the horror of poverty or the beauty of black people. I think that in photography what you've done is what you've had to say. In everything this has been the message of my life. A simple supper, being with someone you love, seeing a deer come around to eat or drink at the barn - I like things like that. If I could make one true, quiet photograph, I would much prefer it to having a lot of answers.|$|E

2500|$|Speaking {{about the}} album with the Chicago Sun-Times, Fiasco has stated: [...] "Lasers {{is a great}} album. I'm {{actually}} happy with the record. I feel I got <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> wanted even with -- It doesn't make up for {{what it took to}} get through it. It's still being argued and debated upon. ... The climate of this record was very weird, in some instances surreal. I became very abstract. I had to create this commercial art that appeases the corporate side. I had to acquiesce to certain forces. Hopefully within that I snuck in some things I actually wanted to say any way I can." [...] In an interview with The Guardian, Fiasco has expressed that during the recording process of the album he has dealt with depression and suicidal thoughts: [...] "It was mentally destructive. I say it with a certain laissez-faire now because I'm past it [...] I was super-depressed, lightly suicidal, at moments medium suicidal – and if not suicidal, willing to just walk away from it all completely." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} for Power 106, Gomez spoke in-depth about the inspiration behind [...] "Kill Em with Kindness", saying: [...] "Everybody has had a say in my life [...] meaning the world, the perception, the media. It was really frustrating. There is a song on my record called ‘Kill Em with Kindness.’ So I’ve always done that. I ignore, I ignore, I ignore. And then {{it just kind of}} got out of hand. So I went to the new label [...] and I was like, I have to say something. I need <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> want to say, and you guys have to help me {{figure out how to do}} that." [...] While working on the album, Gomez enlisted frequent collaborators Rock Mafia to help make her sound a reality. They helped Gomez on the creation of six tracks on the album, including [...] "Revival" [...] and [...] "Kill Em with Kindness", the latter being one of the most personal tracks on Revival. She told the producers that although the production was important, she wanted the focus of the song to be the lyrics.|$|E
2500|$|In late 2009, Raven-Symone {{announced}} that she {{would return to the}} studio to record her next album. She said that the album will be [...] "R, most definitely.....with an alternative base for the lyrics". She said, [...] "It's good {{to go out there and}} spread your wings and find new talent and work with people you haven't worked with before. I'd love to find the next Timbaland or the next someone who's coming up and no one really knows yet. At the same time, I'd love to work with the Clutch and the J.A.M. again". In January 2011, she told to OnTheRedCarpet.com that she has been working on her fifth album. Da Beat Kadetz formerly known as The TriGz may be working on the project, with Manny Streetz (from Da Beat Kadetz) as executive producer. Raven revealed to Billboard that she would like to work with Sean Garrett again and that it will be R with an [...] "alternative base for lyrics". In an interview with Broadway.com in March 2012, she confirmed that she has no plans to release a new album, saying that she [...] "couldn't quite get it together" [...] and that the music she had been working on [...] "wasn't going to be something sellable." [...] She added that the album [...] "might come later in life when I'm able <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> need to say." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Mother, I {{have yet}} {{something}} more <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> It has been upon my mind, night and day, this long time. It {{is far more}} difficult <b>to</b> <b>say</b> than <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have said. That concerned myself; this concerns us all.' ...|$|R

5000|$|Buchanan is {{considered}} to be a quasi-member of the Austrian school of economics, not formally associated with the school but sharing many common beliefs. As Buchanan puts it: [...] "I certainly have a great deal of affinity with Austrian economics and I have no objections to being called an Austrian. Hayek and Mises might consider me an Austrian but, surely some of the others would not." [...] Buchanan went on <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that: [...] "I didn't become acquainted with Mises until I wrote an article on individual choice and voting in the market in 1954. After I had finished the first draft I went back to see what Mises had said in Human Action.
