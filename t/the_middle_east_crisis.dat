2500|$|The {{economy was}} soon in turmoil again, with <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> <b>crisis</b> between Egypt and Israel raising oil prices.

A Common Market report suggested that the pound could not be sustained as a reserve currency and it was suggested again that the pound should be devalued. Wilson and Callaghan refused a contingency fund offered from the IMF because of several conditions attached. On Wednesday 15 November, the historic decision was taken to commit the government to a 14.3% devaluation. The situation was a great political controversy at the time.

2500|$|The {{support of}} Palestinians is {{frequently}} {{due to the}} consideration of them as people of color—Andrew Hacker writes: [...] "The presence of Israel in the Middle East is perceived as thwarting the rightful status of people of color.
