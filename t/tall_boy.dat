25|$|Between 1880 and 1882 Wilson {{made several}} {{unsuccessful}} {{attempts to get}} into the British Army officer-training establishments, two to enter the Royal Military Academy (Woolwich) and three for the Royal Military College (although there were nine applicants for every place in the late 1870s). The entrance examinations to both relied heavily on rote learning. Sir John Fortescue later (in 1927) claimed that this was because as a <b>tall</b> <b>boy</b> he needed “time for his brain to develop”.|$|E
60|$|Hal {{once more}} crossed the street. He passed Ferris, {{and saw that}} the man the <b>tall</b> <b>boy</b> had stopped was Caleb Allen.|$|E

60|$|At last Ferris {{got tired}} of waiting, and he tried the door. It was unlocked, and, pushing it open, the <b>tall</b> <b>boy</b> entered.|$|E
60|$|The <b>tall</b> <b>boy</b> came out, {{and before}} Hal could recover he was {{dragged into the}} {{apartment}} and the door was closed and locked.|$|E

60|$|Scarcely had Dick spoken {{when the}} <b>tall</b> <b>boy</b> flung himself forward. The pair grappled, {{and a moment}} later both went down, with Dick on top.|$|E

60|$|As he did so, Hardwick shouted {{something}} to the <b>tall</b> <b>boy,</b> and then leaped the fence of the lumber-yard, and ran out on the side street.|$|E
60|$|This {{neighborhood}} was entirely new to Hal, {{and he was}} at once satisfied that the <b>tall</b> <b>boy</b> {{was not going to}} pay a visit to Tommy Macklin.|$|E
60|$|Ferris shuddered. A thin {{stream of}} blood was issuing from Hal's head, and this made the <b>tall</b> <b>boy</b> sick. He {{approached}} {{and gazed at}} Hal's pallid face and motionless form.|$|E

Inspiration had been drawn from NBA shot-blocking specialist Dikembe Mutombo, known for theatrically wagging his finger after rejections — an affectation which Batum had emulated.|$|R

60|$|Allen {{had fallen}} in with Hardwick at a {{gambling}} house uptown, and the two soon became firm friends. At that time Dick Ferris was a great admirer of Hardwick, who found the <b>tall</b> <b>boy</b> a fellow without scruples of any kind.|$|E
50|$|The police later {{issued a}} photofit {{picture of the}} 5 ft 2 <b>tall,</b> 15-17-year-old <b>boy</b> they wished to {{question}} about the King's Cross explosion.|$|R
