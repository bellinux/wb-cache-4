5|$|Continued work {{displayed}} {{a number of}} minor problems, and {{the decision was made}} to introduce a redesigned unit with significant improvements in packaging, insulation, and other practical changes. This would become the AI Mk. V, which began to arrive from Pye in late February and immediately demonstrated a host of problems. By this time <b>the</b> <b>microwave</b> units were being designed, and the Mk. V was almost cancelled. A contract for over 1,000 units was allowed to continue in case of delays in the new units. By May the issues with the Pye design were ironed out, and the FIU's testing revealed it to be superior to the Mk. IV, especially in terms of maintenance. An RAE report agreed.|$|E

5|$|In 1964 Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson serendipitously {{discovered}} the cosmic background radiation, an omnidirectional signal in <b>the</b> <b>microwave</b> band.

This tipped the balance of evidence in favor of the Big Bang model, and Penzias and Wilson were awarded a Nobel Prize in 1978.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} of distributed element filters was {{spurred on by}} the military need for radar and electronic counter measures during World WarII.

40|$|Abstract—Microwaves are {{non-ionizing}} electromagnetic radiation. With {{the growth}} of technology and increase in demand of cellular services day by day; <b>the</b> presence of <b>microwaves</b> in environment is also increasing. Mostly these services are operated at 945 MHz. <b>The</b> wavelength of <b>microwaves</b> spans from one meter to one millimeter, covering the spectrum from 300 MHz to 300 GHz. These frequencies may {{affect the quality of}} <b>the</b> <b>microwaves</b> treated plant seeds and may reduce their fertility. This paper presents the results of some investigations carried out using microwaves treated Brassica seeds on IR (Infra-Red) irradiation. The spectrum of both microwaves treated and untreated seeds was studied under visible and IR radiation. It was observed that increasing the duration or power of <b>the</b> <b>microwaves</b> significantly affected <b>the</b> irradiated spectrum. Increasing <b>the</b> <b>microwaves</b> exposure decreases <b>the</b> IR absorption coefficient of <b>the</b> seeds. Further, <b>microwaves</b> reduce <b>the</b> fluid content of the seeds, which may affect the fertility of the seeds. The results may be useful for the development of an automatic quality assessment system for seeds. Index Terms—Microwaves, IR, Brassica Juncea...|$|R

50|$|The basic {{setup for}} an FMR {{experiment}} is a microwave resonant cavity with an electromagnet. The resonant cavity is fixed at a frequency {{in the super}} high frequency band. A detector is placed {{at the end of}} the cavity to detect <b>the</b> <b>microwaves.</b> <b>The</b> magnetic sample is placed between the poles of the electromagnet and the magnetic field is swept while the resonant absorption intensity of <b>the</b> <b>microwaves</b> is detected. When the magnetization precession frequency and the resonant cavity frequency are the same, absorption increases sharply which is indicated by a decrease in the intensity at the detector.|$|R
5|$|The initial non-military {{application}} of distributed element filters was in <b>the</b> <b>microwave</b> links used by telecommunications companies {{to provide the}} backbone of their networks. These links were also used by other industries with large, fixed networks, notably television broadcasters. Such applications were part of large capital investment programs. However, mass-production manufacturing made the technology cheap enough to incorporate in domestic satellite television systems. An emerging application is in superconducting filters {{for use in the}} cellular base stations operated by mobile phone companies.|$|E
5|$|The {{resonator}} {{shown in}} figure 12 is around 120 μm in length. Experimental complete filters with an operating frequency of 30GHz have been produced using cantilever varactors as the resonator elements. The size of this filter is around 4×3.5mm. Cantilever resonators are typically applied at frequencies below 200MHz, but other structures, such as micro-machined cavities, {{can be used in}} <b>the</b> <b>microwave</b> bands. Extremely high Q resonators can be made with this technology; flexural mode resonators with a Q in excess of 80,000 at 8MHz are reported.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} {{projects}} was to build equipment to transition from the British long-wave radar to the new microwave centimeter-band radar {{made possible by the}} cavity magnetron. In working on <b>the</b> <b>Microwave</b> Early Warning system (MEW), Alvarez invented a linear dipole array antenna that not only suppressed the unwanted side lobes of the radiation field, but also could be electronically scanned without the need for mechanical scanning. This was the first microwave phased-array antenna, and Alvarez used it not only in MEW but in two additional radar systems. The antenna enabled the Eagle precision bombing radar to support precision bombing in bad weather or through clouds. It was completed rather late in the war; although a number of B-29s were equipped with Eagle and it worked well, it came too late to make much difference.|$|E

5|$|The {{prevailing}} {{model for}} the evolution of the Universe is the Big Bang theory. The Big Bang model states that the earliest state of the Universe was extremely hot and dense and that it subsequently expanded. The model is based on general relativity and on simplifying assumptions such as homogeneity and isotropy of space. A version of the model with a cosmological constant (Lambda) and cold dark matter, known as the Lambda-CDM model, is the simplest model that provides a reasonably good account of various observations about the Universe. The Big Bang model accounts for observations such as the correlation of distance and redshift of galaxies, the ratio of the number of hydrogen to helium atoms, and <b>the</b> <b>microwave</b> radiation background.|$|E
5|$|Optical {{heterodyne}} detection {{is an essential}} technique used in high-accuracy measurements of the frequencies of optical sources, {{as well as in}} the stabilization of their frequencies. Until a relatively few years ago, lengthy frequency chains were needed to connect <b>the</b> <b>microwave</b> frequency of a cesium or other atomic time source to optical frequencies. At each step of the chain, a frequency multiplier would be used to produce a harmonic of the frequency of that step, which would be compared by {{heterodyne detection}} with the next step (the output of a microwave source, far infrared laser, infrared laser, or visible laser). Each measurement of a single spectral line required several years of effort in the construction of a custom frequency chain. Currently, optical frequency combs have provided a much simpler method of measuring optical frequencies. If a mode-locked laser is modulated to form a train of pulses, its spectrum is seen to consist of the carrier frequency surrounded by a closely spaced comb of optical sideband frequencies with a spacing equal to the pulse repetition frequency (Fig.16). The pulse repetition frequency is locked to that of the frequency standard, and the frequencies of the comb elements at the red end of the spectrum are doubled and heterodyned with the frequencies of the comb elements at the blue end of the spectrum, thus allowing the comb to serve as its own reference. In this manner, locking of the frequency comb output to an atomic standard can be performed in a single step. To measure an unknown frequency, the frequency comb output is dispersed into a spectrum. The unknown frequency is overlapped with the appropriate spectral segment of the comb and the frequency of the resultant heterodyne beats is measured.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>microwave</b> bridge {{contains}} both <b>the</b> <b>microwave</b> {{source and}} the detector. Older spectrometers used a vacuum tube called a klystron to generate microwaves however modern spectrometers use a Gunn diode. Immediately after <b>the</b> <b>microwave</b> source {{there is an}} isolator which serves to attenuate any reflections back to the source which would result in fluctuations in <b>the</b> <b>microwave</b> frequency. <b>The</b> <b>microwave</b> power from the source is then passed through a directional coupler which splits <b>the</b> <b>microwave</b> power into two paths, one directed towards the cavity and the other the reference arm. Along both paths there is a variable attenuator that facilitates the precise control {{of the flow of}} microwave power. This in turn allows for accurate control over the intensity of the microwaves subjected to the sample. On the reference arm, after the variable attenuator there is a phase shifter that sets a defined phase relationship between the reference and reflected signal which permits phase sensitive detection.|$|E

25|$|Most EPR {{machines}} are reflection spectrometers, {{meaning that the}} detector should only be exposed to microwave radiation {{coming back from the}} cavity. This is achieved by the use of a device known as the circulator which directs <b>the</b> <b>microwave</b> radiation (from the branch that is heading towards the cavity) into the cavity. Reflected microwave radiation (after absorption by the sample) is then passed through the circulator towards the detector, ensuring it does not go back to <b>the</b> <b>microwave</b> source.
