500|$|After {{completing}} The Elephant Man (1980), Lynch met producer Richard Roth over coffee. Roth {{had read}} and enjoyed Lynch's Ronnie Rocket script, {{but did not}} think it was something he wanted to produce. He asked Lynch if the filmmaker had any other scripts, but the director only had ideas. [...] "I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> always wanted to sneak into a girl's room to watch her into the night and that, maybe, at one point or another, I would see something that would be the clue to a murder mystery. Roth loved the idea and asked me to write a treatment. I went home and thought of the ear in the field." [...] Production was announced in August 1984. Lynch wrote two more drafts before he was satisfied with the script of the film. Conditions at this point were ideal for Lynch's film: he had made a deal with Dino De Laurentiis that gave him complete artistic freedom and final cut privileges, with the stipulation that the filmmaker take a cut in his salary and work with a budget of only $6 million. This deal meant that Blue Velvet was the smallest film on the De Laurentiis' slate. Consequently, Lynch would be left mostly unsupervised during production. [...] "After Dune I was down so far that anything was up! So it was just a euphoria. And when you work with that kind of feeling, you can take chances. You can experiment." [...] Because the material was completely different from anything that would be considered mainstream at the time, Laurentiis had to start his own company to distribute it.|$|E

2500|$|Coincidentally, John Eisenhower, son of General Dwight D. Eisenhower, {{had only}} {{recently}} (September, 1945) been assigned to Fifteenth U.S. Army. In his book General Ike: A Personal Reminiscence he writes that one day in October 1945 'Ike' <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to fire George Patton today. [...] John Eisenhower then served under Patton for a short time.|$|E
60|$|He {{made such}} a noise that the {{landlord}} wot was waiting for 'is money, asked 'im wot he meant by it, and, arter he 'ad explained, I'm blest if the landlord didn't advise him to search me. I stood still and let George go through my pockets, and then <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>'im</b> <b>I</b> <b>'ad</b> done with <b>'im</b> and <b>I</b> never wanted to see 'im agin as long as I lived.|$|R
60|$|He {{was really}} devoted to me, I believe. But he cheered up when <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{recommended}} <b>him</b> for my successor.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> how <b>I</b> <b>had</b> once {{come through}} when land and timber grants {{could have been}} picked up for half less than nothing.|$|R
2500|$|... “The {{conductor}} {{went around}} and collected tickets {{and when he}} came to me I handed him my ticket and he refused to take it. [...] It was one of the Omnibus railroad tickets, one that I had purchased of them previous to that time. [...] He replied that colored persons were not allowed to ride. [...] I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been in the habit of riding ever since the cars had been running. [...] I answered that I had a great ways to go and I was later than I ought to be.” ...|$|E
60|$|I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> misdoubted as much; but {{the time}} was not very fortunate, as the stock was low.|$|E
60|$|And he {{was about}} to rebuke me hotly, when I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> come from Maryland, where I was born.|$|E
60|$|In {{the chamber}} beneath was my uncle Sepa. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been {{watching}} the sun rise over the city of Alexandria.|$|R
60|$|It was, as transpired later, a great pity {{he spoke}} again before <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> where <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{obtained}} the money; but fate {{would have it}} so.|$|R
6000|$|... "When Smith {{told me that}} he had no {{idea who}} was the bidder, or he would not have {{suffered}} it," [...] said Fulk, [...] "I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> could <b>have</b> no possible objection!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, I did,' {{answered}} Margaret simply. 'I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> no taste at all, {{but that}} you were responsible for everything.' ...|$|E
60|$|I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a {{few pounds}} still {{remaining}} to me, but that after that was gone I should be penniless.|$|E
60|$|I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> come {{up again}} to say how sorry I was that {{anything}} disagreeable should have occurred, and that I hoped he would not blame me much.|$|E
6000|$|... "I know it," [...] I answered, [...] "but, son, {{there is}} still work {{to do if you}} want to save your wife----" [...] and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> what <b>I</b> <b>had</b> learned.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Only to him. He {{thinks the}} world of my accomplishments. Then <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> wouldn't <b>have</b> you {{if you were the}} last man on earth instead of only the best-looking--not with a million in each stocking.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> mildly entreated <b>him</b> {{not to be}} despondent. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{heard by}} chance of his being in {{difficulty}} and had come to consult with him what could best be done.|$|R
60|$|I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{spent some}} {{years at the}} Royal College of Science, and had done some {{researches}} in biology under Huxley. He raised his eyebrows slightly at that.|$|E
6000|$|... "I met Buell on the train. I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> come West {{to study}} forestry. Buell's afraid I'll {{find out about}} this lumber steal, {{and he wants to}} shut my mouth." ...|$|E
60|$|I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> not {{a single}} friend in all the land of America, and that I was far from home and help, and very poor. And I begged him to let me go.|$|E
60|$|So, when to-morrow came, I {{went to my}} {{guardian}} after breakfast, in {{the room}} that was our town-substitute for the growlery, and <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> it in trust to tell him something.|$|R
6000|$|... '"Alas!" [...] said I, [...] "then my Manor {{is already}} forfeit. I am under vow not {{to enter the}} Great Hall." [...] And <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> what <b>I</b> <b>had</b> sworn to the Lady Ælueva.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ptolemy," [...] I answered, [...] "we {{shall be}} {{fortunate}} {{if we get}} ourselves alive out of Mur, let alone these bones and ancient treasures," [...] and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> what <b>I</b> <b>had</b> seen that evening.|$|R
6000|$|... "He was an {{enormously}} fat {{man who came}} to see me one night and said he had been sent to get back some letters. I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> destroyed them ages ago and he went away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... '"How could I {{know that}} De Aquila {{would give it}} me?" [...] I said. [...] "If I had <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> spent my night in your halter he would have burned the place twice over by now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{met your}} {{faithful}} Mike {{at the gate}} of the hospital. I was glad, indeed, to see that he had come out unharmed from that terrible fight. When I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> come to take you away, he almost cried with joy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not I," [...] cried Helen, {{laughing}} in scorn. [...] "He'd {{better have a}} care. He can't run things with a high hand {{out here on the}} border. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> would <b>have</b> none of him, and that ended it." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{last words}} brought him round, {{and he took}} his hands of. [...] "I have seen two of them within this minute," [...] said I. And so <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> what <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> Harry Charker.|$|R
6000|$|... "I said I was a prisoner, gentlemen," [...] {{he went on}} bitterly; [...] "but that ain't all! I {{asked to}} see Johnston, <b>told</b> <b>him</b> what <b>I</b> <b>had</b> done, and demanded to be {{exchanged}} for a general officer. He said, 'You be d----d.' I then sent word to the division commander-in-chief, and <b>told</b> <b>him</b> how <b>I</b> <b>had</b> saved Gray Oaks when his brigadier ran away, and he said, 'You be d----d.' I've bin 'You be d----d' from the lowest non-com. to the commander-in-chief, and when I was at last exchanged, I was exchanged, gentlemen, for two mules and a broken wagon. But I'm here, gentlemen--as I was thar!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ken came in {{this morning}} and found me sick in bed. I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been half drunk last night--and that Graves had gotten me to drink. Then Graves came in. He and Ken had hard words. They went {{outdoors}} to fight." ...|$|E
60|$|I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{observed}} he did {{not enjoy}} good spirits; {{and that it was}} a common fancy to envy others and think we should be the better of some change; quoting Horace to the point, like a young man fresh from college.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{afternoon}} we gawked around, a-lookin' {{at all the}} outside shows, for Jone said he'd have to be pretty careful of his money now, an' he was glad when I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> two free tickets in my pocket for a show in the evenin.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know he is," [...] I returned. [...] "Let me {{tell you}} what {{evidence}} <b>I</b> <b>have</b> seen of it." [...] And <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> what <b>I</b> <b>had</b> not mentioned in my narrative, of that encounter with the other convict.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{all over}} now. I am glad it is finished. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> written to [...] him, giving <b>him</b> up. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> ceased to care for him, [...] {{and that it is}} better we should both be free. It is best that way. He [...] would have had to ask me to release him, and that would have given him [...] pain. He was always gentle. Now {{he will be able to}} marry her with an [...] easy conscience, and he need never know what <b>I</b> <b>have</b> suffered. She is [...] more fitted for <b>him</b> than <b>I</b> am. I hope he will be happy. I think <b>I</b> [...] <b>have</b> done the right thing." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> what <b>I</b> <b>had</b> seen; <b>told</b> <b>him</b> {{in broken}} sentences, with gasps of pain between them, and very dexterously and swiftly he bound my arm meanwhile. He slung {{it from my}} shoulder, stood {{back and looked at}} me.|$|R
