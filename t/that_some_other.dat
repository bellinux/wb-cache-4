5|$|The {{presence}} (as at 2010) of two breeding {{pairs of}} wild peregrine falcons (nesting {{one in each}} of the telescope's two support towers) prevents the nuisance of pigeon infestation (by droppings fouling, and their body heat affecting sensitive instrument readings) <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>other</b> radio telescopes suffer from.|$|E
5|$|One {{argument}} {{in favour of}} the toxin acting as a defence against predators is the apparent Müllerian mimicry {{in some of the}} various unrelated pitohui species, which all have similar plumage. The species known as pitohuis were long thought congeneric, due to their similarities in plumage, but are now spread through three families, the oriole, whistlers and Australo-Papuan bellbirds. The similarity in appearance therefore presumably evolved as a shared aposematic signal to common predators of their distasteful nature. This signal is reinforced by the species' strong sour odor. There is also evidence <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>other</b> birds in New Guinea have evolved Batesian mimicry, where a non-toxic species adopts the appearance of a toxic species. An example of this is the non-toxic juvenile greater melampitta, which has plumage similar to the hooded pitohui.|$|E
5|$|WASP-15b is an {{extrasolar planet}} {{discovered}} in 2008 by the SuperWASP collaboration, {{which seeks to}} discover exoplanets that transit their host stars. The planet orbits its host star {{at a distance of}} 0.05 AU every four days. The mass of this planet is about one half that of Jupiter, but its radius is nearly 50% larger than Jupiter's, making the density of this planet only one quarter that of water; it is thought <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>other</b> form of heating must explain its extremely low density. WASP-15b's discovery was published on April 29, 2009.|$|E

5|$|As the WSPU gained {{recognition}} and notoriety for its actions, Pankhurst resisted efforts to democratise the organisation itself. In 1907 {{a small group}} of members led by Teresa Billington-Greig called for more involvement from the rank-and-file suffragettes at the union's annual meetings. In response, Pankhurst announced at a WSPU meeting that elements of the organisation's constitution relating to decision-making were void and cancelled the annual meetings. She also insisted that a small committee chosen by the members in attendance be allowed to co-ordinate WSPU activities. Pankhurst and her daughter Christabel were chosen (along with Mabel Tuke and Emmeline Pethick Lawrence) as members of the new committee. Frustrated, several members including Billington-Greig and Charlotte Despard quit to form their own organisation, the Women's Freedom League. In her 1914 autobiography Pankhurst dismissed criticism of the WSPU's leadership structure:if at any time a member, or a group of members, loses faith in our policy; if any one begins to suggest <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>other</b> policy ought to be substituted, or if she tries to confuse the issue by adding other policies, she ceases at once to be a member. Autocratic? Quite so. But, you may object, a suffrage organisation ought to be democratic. Well the members of the W. S. P. U. do not agree with you. We do not believe in the effectiveness of the ordinary suffrage organisation. The W. S. P. U. is not hampered by a complexity of rules. We have no constitution and by-laws; nothing to be amended or tinkered with or quarrelled over at an annual meeting... The W. S. P. U. is simply a suffrage army in the field.|$|E

25|$|Appetitive {{behaviors}} are also partly controlled by medial preoptic area as aromatase-knockout mice show deficits in sexual motivation. However, appetitive {{behaviors are}} disrupted by the lesions in rostral part rather than caudal part of medial preoptic area. Lesions of the rostral part of medial preoptic area also diminish preference for female by male rats. Furthermore, in vivo dialysis experiments {{showed that the}} level of extracellular dopamine in the mPOA increases as the sexual appetitive sequences progress. mPOA’s involvement in the control of appetitive sexual behaviors is also confirmed by pharmacological manipulations of the dopaminergic system in it. In rats, lesions to mPOA can eliminate the male copulatory behavior but can only diminish appetitive behavior, which suggests <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>other</b> parts of the brain, except for mPOA, are also responsible for sexually appetitive behavior.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} that the unique effect can be nearly zero even when the marginal effect is large. This may imply <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>other</b> covariate captures all the information in x'j, so that once that variable is in the model, there is no contribution of x'j to the variation in y. Conversely, the unique effect of x'j can be large while its marginal effect is nearly zero. This would happen if the other covariates explained {{a great deal of the}} variation of y, but they mainly explain variation in a way that is complementary to what is captured by x'j. In this case, including the other variables in the model reduces the part of the variability of y that is unrelated to x'j, thereby strengthening the apparent relationship with x'j.|$|E

There can be black markets, where a good is exchanged illegally, for example markets for goods under a command economy despite pressure to repress them, and virtual markets, such as eBay, in which buyers and sellers do not physically interact during negotiation. A market can be organized as an auction, as a private electronic market, as a commodity wholesale market, as a shopping center, as a complex institution such as a stock market, and as an informal discussion between two individuals.|$|E

25|$|It {{was found}} in 2007 that while tobacco and {{cannabis}} smoke are quite similar, cannabis smoke contained higher amounts of ammonia, hydrogen cyanide, and nitrogen oxides, but lower levels of carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). This study found that directly inhaled cannabis smoke contained as much as 20 times as much ammonia and 5 times as much hydrogen cyanide as tobacco smoke and compared the properties of both mainstream and sidestream (smoke emitted from a smouldering 'joint' or 'cone') smoke. Mainstream cannabis smoke was found to contain higher concentrations of selected polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) than sidestream tobacco smoke. However, other studies have found much lower disparities in ammonia and hydrogen cyanide between cannabis and tobacco, and <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>other</b> constituents (such as polonium-210, lead, arsenic, nicotine, and tobacco-specific nitrosamines) are either lower or non-existent in cannabis smoke.|$|E
