5|$|Abe refines this {{proof-of-concept}} {{and builds}} a stable time-apparatus ("the box"), sized {{to accommodate a}} human subject. Abe uses <b>this</b> <b>box</b> to travel six hours into his own past—as part of this process, Original-Abe sits incommunicado in a hotel room, {{so as not to}} interact or interfere with the outside world, after which Original-Abe enters the box, waits inside the box for six hours (thus going back in time six hours), and becomes Future-Abe, who travels across town, explains the proceedings to Aaron, and brings Aaron back to the self-storage facility housing the box. At the end of the overlap-timespan, Original-Abe enters the box and ceases to exist.|$|E
5|$|Boxes play a {{prominent}} role in Crash Bandicoot: Warped and can be broken with all of Crash's techniques. Boxes contain helpful items or can augment Crash's mobility. Check Point boxes allow the player to return to a specific point in the stage upon losing a life. TNT Boxes explode after a three-second fuse when jumped on, while Nitro Boxes explode upon any physical contact. All of the Nitro Boxes in a level can be detonated at once if a green-colored box with an exclamation point (!) on it is touched; contact with <b>this</b> <b>box</b> is necessary in obtaining the level's Gem, as Nitro Boxes count towards the total number of boxes broken in the level.|$|E

50|$|The rides {{are similar}} in design. There is a large steel boxed-track loop {{attached}} to a concrete base or portable trailer with supporting outriggers and steel cables. In <b>this</b> <b>boxed</b> track is a multiple-piece pivoted end-rim (inertia ring) with wheel dogs attached settled within <b>this</b> <b>boxed</b> track. On {{one section of the}} rim the train is snugly placed. The rim is run through a shock-absorbent tire drive, which drives the train around the loop.|$|R
5|$|R.C. MacLeod listed another tradition, {{somewhat}} {{similar to the}} one that appeared in c.1800 manuscript. According to this version, a MacLeod joined a Crusading army, and went to the Holy Land. While in the desert-wilderness, he came across a witch, from whom he managed to escape. He then came upon a river, and proceeded to cross it at a ford. However, a fairy maiden appeared from the water and blocked his passage. After a struggle, MacLeod overcame the fairy and passed over the river. He then became friends with her. Before they parted, the fairy maiden gave him a box of scented wood; <b>this</b> <b>box,</b> she told him, held several other smaller boxes, which fitted inside one another. She told him that the innermost box contained a magic banner, which when waved would bring forth a host of armed men to aid its owner. The fairy warned the MacLeod, that if he were to open the box within a year and a day from then, that no crops would grow on his land, no livestock would be born, as well as no children. When the MacLeod returned home he gave the box to the chief's wife. The wife, however, ignored the MacLeod's warning, and opened the box. Immediately a host of armed men appeared and that year, no children were born. The tradition concluded that ever since that time, the flag had been preserved for a time when such an army might mean salvation for the clan.|$|E

25|$|The {{boundaries}} of the Philippine archipelago are described in Article III of the Treaty of Paris (1898), as comprising an irregular polygon. A box enclosing that polygon would have corners at 20°N 116°E, 20°N 127°E, 4.75°N 127°E, 4.75°N 116°E. The center of <b>this</b> <b>box</b> would lie at 121.5 E, 12.375 N.

25|$|All {{these units}} were heavily engaged until the autumn, when 21st Army Group overran the V-1 {{launching}} sites in northern France. The emphasis then {{shifted to the}} Thames Estuary as the Luftwaffe began launching V-1s from aircraft over the North Sea. 1 AA Group, previously controlling the London Inner Artillery Zone, established a 'Diver Box' covering the estuary and 131 LAA Rgt left 71 AA Bde and joined 57th AA Bde in <b>this</b> <b>box</b> by 16 October 1944.|$|E
25|$|Holiday Camp – this {{building}} {{is known to}} have been erected on land owned by Allnatt Ltd since it is marked on the plans accompanying a combined conveyance/lease concluded by the railway with that company and is shown as measuring 12ft by 6ft.

There is uncertainty as to whether it was ever brought into use though and if so how many levers it contained.|$|E

MacDonald and Eddy played {{a husband and wife}} Broadway musical comedy team who are offered a Hollywood contract. Sweethearts won the Photoplay Gold Medal Award as Best Picture of the Year.|$|E
25|$|Web {{designer}} Doug Bowman {{has said}} that the original Internet Explorer box model represents a better, more logical approach. Peter-Paul Koch gives the example of a physical box, whose dimensions always refer to the box itself, including potential padding, but never its content. He says that <b>this</b> <b>box</b> model is more useful for graphic designers, who create designs based on the visible width of boxes rather than the width of their content. Bernie Zimmermann says that the Internet Explorer box model is closer to the definition of cell dimensions and padding used in the HTML table model.|$|E
25|$|The proprietors of the Kennet and Avon Canal Company had {{inspected}} Weldon's {{device and}} recommended {{it to the}} adjoining Somerset Coal Canal for use at Combe Hay on their new line, to overcome water supply problems there. (The Somerset Coal Canal led directly to the Kennet and Avon {{and it was in}} the latter company's interest that the new route be opened as quickly as possible.) Three such locks were proposed, each to be 80ft (24.3m)long and 60ft (18.2m) deep and containing a closed wooden box which could take the boat. <b>This</b> <b>box</b> moved {{up and down in the}} 60ft (18.2m) deep pool of water, which never left the lock.|$|E
5000|$|In the Starman series, Ted Knight was lent a Mother Box by Orion to be incorporated, {{along with}} Kitty Faulkner's energy-detecting technology, into the {{spaceship}} his son Jack used {{to track down}} a former Starman, Will Payton. <b>This</b> Mother <b>Box</b> was destroyed along with the spaceship by missiles fired from Throneworld. A notable feature of <b>this</b> Mother <b>Box</b> was the fact Ted Knight's consciousness, memories and personality were apparently copied and served as the Box's consciousness, as well as creating a holographic image of Knight to aid Jack. Since <b>this</b> specific <b>box</b> was programmed by Orion, it was prone to violent solutions.|$|R

Disney's 3D re-releases of The Lion King (in 2011) and Finding Nemo (in 2012), Despicable Me 2 (in 2013), Disney's Frozen (also in 2013), Minions (in 2015), Zootopia (in 2016), Finding Dory (also in 2016), and Despicable Me 3 (in 2017) respectively, surpassed Shrek 2 and relegated it as the tenth-highest-grossing animated film of all time.|$|E

25|$|On 27 June 2015, it was {{announced}} that River Song will feature in two Big Finish dramas, Doom Coalition 2 and The Diary of River Song, alongside Paul McGann. As a result, River Song becomes the first major character of the 2005–present modern era of Doctor Who to be featured in a Big Finish production (prior to 2015, the company had been restricted to only using characters from the original 1963-1989 series, plus McGann's Eighth Doctor from the 1996 Doctor Who TV movie). She also appeared in Doom Coalition 3 and Doom Coalition 4 alongside the Eighth Doctor.
