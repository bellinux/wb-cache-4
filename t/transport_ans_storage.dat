40|$|AbstractAmong {{the factors}} that {{decelerate}} progress of CCS demonstration and deployment {{is the lack of}} public acceptance of local projects in Germany as well as in other countries. The study presented here aims to take the issue of public CCS perceptions further by empirically investigating the relevance of different specifications of the three main steps of the CCS chain, i. e. capture, <b>transport</b> and <b>storage.</b> <b>An</b> experimental approach is chosen and applied in an online survey with a representative sample from Germany with 1830 participants. With regard to possible CO 2 sources we varied whether the CO 2 of a specific setting is captured i) as part of an energy-intensive industry process (e. g. production of steel or cement), ii) from a power plant running on biomass, or iii) a coal-fired power plant. For transport, half of the settings described made reference to transport of CO 2 via pipelines, the other half did not provide information about transport. With regard to storage the setting descriptions i) either explained that CO 2 can be stored in saline aquifers, ii) can be used to enhance gas production from an emptying natural gas field or iii) can be stored in a depleted natural gas field. We find that overall the average of the ratings for perception of the settings fall into the neutral part of the answering scale. If the source of CO 2 is a coal-fired power plant the setting is perceived less positively than if it includes biomass or industry. A significant interaction effect between transport and storage specifications is observed. This points out that storage in saline aquifers is perceived more negatively than a combination with enhanced gas recovery while storage in a depleted natural gas field is rated less positively if a pipeline is mentioned and more positively if no transport option is mentioned...|$|R

40|$|Ca 2 + {{transport}} was {{studied by}} using basolateral plasma membrane vesicles from rat parotid gland prepared by a Percoll gradient centrifugation method. In these membrane vesicles, {{there were two}} Ca 2 + transport systems; Na+/Ca 2 + exchange and ATP-dependent Ca 2 + <b>transport.</b> <b>An</b> outwardly directed Na+ gradient increased Ca 2 + uptake. Ca 2 + efflux from Ca 2 +-preloaded vesicles was stimulated by an inwardly directed Na+ gradient. However, Na+/Ca 2 + exchange did not show any 'uphill' transport of Ca 2 + against its own gradient. ATP-dependent Ca 2 + transport exhibited 'uphill' <b>transport.</b> <b>An</b> inwardly directed Na+ gradient also decreased Ca 2 + accumulation by ATP-dependent Ca 2 + uptake. The inhibition of Ca 2 + accumulation was proportional to the external Na+ level. Na+/Ca 2 + exchange was inhibited by monensin, tetracaine and chlorpromazine, whereas ATP-dependent Ca 2 + transport was inhibited by orthovanadate, tetracaine and chlorpromazine. Oligomycin {{had no effect on}} either system. These results suggest that in the parotid gland cellular free Ca 2 + is extruded mainly by an ATP-dependent Ca 2 + transport system, and Na+/Ca 2 + exchange may modify the efficacy of that system...|$|R
