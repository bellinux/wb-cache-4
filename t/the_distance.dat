30|$|In summary, {{the age of}} peak triathlon {{performance}} was higher in <b>the</b> Ironman <b>distance</b> than in <b>the</b> Olympic <b>distance</b> triathlon for both women and men. Also the age of peak performance in male triathletes was higher in <b>the</b> Ironman <b>distance</b> than in <b>the</b> Half-Ironman <b>distance</b> and it was higher in <b>the</b> Half-Ironman <b>distance</b> than in <b>the</b> Olympic <b>distance</b> triathlon in women. The age of the annual top ten {{male and female athletes}} remained stable over the last decade for <b>the</b> three different <b>distances,</b> except for a slight decrease in the age of male triathletes competing in <b>the</b> Olympic <b>distance</b> triathlon. In <b>the</b> Olympic <b>distance</b> triathlon, <b>the</b> fastest male and female triathletes were at the age of 26 – 27 years. The fastest men were ~ 28 years old in <b>the</b> Half-Ironman <b>distance</b> and ~ 35 years in <b>the</b> Ironman <b>distance.</b> In women, <b>the</b> fastest athletes were ~ 31.5 years old in <b>the</b> Half-Ironman <b>distance</b> and 34.5 years in <b>the</b> Ironman <b>distance.</b> <b>The</b> {{results of the present study}} may contribute to a more precise career planning for both coaches and athletes in order to determine the right point in time to switch from the shorter to <b>the</b> longer <b>distances.</b> <b>The</b> switch from <b>the</b> Olympic <b>distance</b> to <b>the</b> Half-Ironman <b>distance</b> and/or <b>the</b> Ironman <b>distance</b> can be planned more accurately, as with the right timing a top athlete over <b>the</b> Olympic <b>distance</b> manages to stay at the top after changing <b>the</b> racing <b>distance.</b>|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>distance</b> to the Pleiades {{can be used}} as an {{important}} first step to calibrate the cosmic distance ladder. As the cluster is so close to the Earth, its distance is relatively easy to measure and has been estimated by many methods. Accurate knowledge of <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> allows astronomers to plot a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram for the cluster, which, when compared to those plotted for clusters whose distance is not known, allows their distances to be estimated. Other methods can then extend <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> scale from open clusters to galaxies and clusters of galaxies, and a cosmic distance ladder can be constructed. Ultimately astronomers' understanding of the age and future evolution of the universe is influenced by their knowledge of <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> to the Pleiades. Yet some authors argue that the controversy over <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> to the Pleiades discussed below is a red herring, since the cosmic distance ladder can (presently) rely on a suite of other nearby clusters where consensus exists regarding the distances as established by Hipparcos and independent means (e.g., the Hyades, Coma Berenices cluster, etc.).|$|E

5|$|Astronomers {{characterize}} the morphology of a globular cluster {{by means of}} standard radii. These are the core radius (r'c), the half-light radius (r'h), and the tidal (or Jacobi) radius (r't). The overall luminosity of the cluster steadily decreases with distance from the core, and the core radius is <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> at which the apparent surface luminosity has dropped by half. A comparable quantity is the half-light radius, or <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> from the core within which half the total luminosity from the cluster is received.
