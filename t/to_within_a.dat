Audi No. 7 led the session with a three minutes and 20.967 seconds lap time, still over four seconds shy of pole position. Nissan improved all three of their cars during the session, closing <b>to</b> <b>within</b> <b>a</b> second of the closest LMP1 competitor. The No. 26 G-Drive Ligier-Nissan closed <b>to</b> <b>within</b> <b>a</b> second of KCMG to take the second grid position in LMP2, while Greaves remained in third. In LMGTE Pro the No. 51 AF Corse Ferrari rebounded from the loss of their qualifying times in the first session to lead the final session and come within a tenth of a second of Aston Martin. The sister AF Corse Ferrari also improved to fourth in the category to split the top of the grid in the class amongst the two manufacturers. The lead in LMGTE Am remained with the No. 98 Aston Martin, a second and a half ahead of the No. 83 AF Corse Ferrari. SMP Racing improved their time by leading both of the day's qualifying sessions to take second place on the grid, splitting the Aston Martin cars. The No. 67 AAI Porsche suffered a fire during the session which halted qualifying for nearly half an hour.|$|E
5|$|Magnetic Airborne Detection (MAD) {{was used}} to detect {{submerged}} U-boats. It consisted of a sensitive magnetometer installed in the cone of the aircraft (mostly Catalinas) that could detect anomalies in the Earth's magnetic field within a range of 400 feet and was sensitive to detect a submarine <b>to</b> <b>within</b> <b>a</b> few feet. The mine was {{used in conjunction with}} a 65.5lb retro bomb. It was filled with 25lb of Torpex and the weapon was rocket propelled backwards to the line of flight at a speed that counteracted the aircraft's forward motion. It was released rearwards from rails on the wings of the aircraft. Thus, with the aircraft's forward motion cancelled-out by the rocket motor, the device fell directly onto the target.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{problem of}} {{existence}} of predictive complexity for the absolute loss game is studied. Predictive complexity is a generalization of Kolmogorov complexity which bounds {{the ability of}} any algorithm to predict elements of a sequence of outcomes. For perfectly mixable loss functions (logarithmic and squared difference are among them) predictive complexity is defined like Kolmogorov complexity <b>to</b> <b>within</b> <b>an</b> additive constant. The absolute loss function is not perfectly mixable, {{and the question of}} existence of the corresponding predictive complexity, which is defined <b>to</b> <b>within</b> <b>an</b> additive constant, is open. We prove {{that in the case of}} the absolute loss game the predictive complexity can be defined <b>to</b> <b>within</b> <b>an</b> additive term O(n), where n is the length of a sequence of outcomes.

The 2nd Battalion, King's Shropshire Light Infantry advanced on foot <b>to</b> <b>within</b> <b>a</b> few kilometres of Caen, but had to withdraw {{due to lack of}} armour support. At 16:00, the German 21st Panzer Division mounted a counterattack between Sword and Juno and nearly succeeded in reaching the channel.

5|$|The {{oldest and}} most precise method of X-ray {{crystallography}} is single-crystal X-ray diffraction, in which a beam of X-rays strikes a single crystal, producing scattered beams. When they land {{on a piece of}} film or other detector, these beams make a diffraction pattern of spots; the strengths and angles of these beams are recorded as the crystal is gradually rotated. Each spot is called a reflection, since it corresponds to the reflection of the X-rays from one set of evenly spaced planes within the crystal. For single crystals of sufficient purity and regularity, X-ray diffraction data can determine the mean chemical bond lengths and angles <b>to</b> <b>within</b> <b>a</b> few thousandths of an angstrom and <b>to</b> <b>within</b> <b>a</b> few tenths of a degree, respectively. The atoms in a crystal are not static, but oscillate about their mean positions, usually by less than a few tenths of an angstrom. X-ray crystallography allows measuring the size of these oscillations.|$|E

5|$|A general mounted attack {{commenced}} at 14:30. By 15:30, the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade and the 1st and 2nd Light Horse Brigades were advancing at the gallop on Katia. When {{they had}} reached {{the edge of the}} white gypsum, the light horse and mounted rifle brigades formed a line, fixed bayonets, and charged over the exposed country. They galloped {{in a long line of}} charging horses, through shell fire and bullets, holding fixed bayonets. On the far left, the intensity of fire from the rearguard, made it necessary for the 5th Mounted Brigade of sword carrying Yeomanry, to send back their horses and advance dismounted. While all the brigades which charged, were eventually forced to attack dismounted also, when the ground became too swampy. They were met by well-directed, heavy German, Austrian and Ottoman artillery fire, which completely outgunned the supporting Ayrshire and Somerset Batteries; by sunset, the advance of the British Empire mounted brigades had been stopped. The 9th Light Horse Regiment (3rd Light Horse Brigade) on the extreme right was held up by a determined German and Ottoman rearguard and was unable to work round the right flank of that position. But after galloping <b>to</b> <b>within</b> <b>a</b> few hundred yards of the rearguard's line, they made a dismounted bayonet attack under cover of machine gun fire and the Inverness Battery. As a result, the German and Ottoman force abandoned their position, leaving 425 men and seven machine guns to be captured. But, instead of holding their ground, they drew off, and this withdrawal led to a strong German and Ottoman counterattack falling on the Canterbury Mounted Rifle Regiment.|$|E

5|$|As Patching {{had slipped}} {{earlier in the}} meet, Kerry decided to rub a sticky red {{substance}} onto {{the soles of his}} feet. The Soviet hosts had installed a carpet following the incidents, resulting in Kerry leaving red footprints in the stadium. Kerry led off in a time faster than his effort in the individual event, but it was still two seconds slower than his personal best time of 57.87s, leaving Australia in fourth place {{at the end of the}} first leg. Evans then swam a personal best of 63.01s, drawing Australia almost level with the host nation at the halfway mark. Tonelli swam his leg in 54.94s, almost two seconds faster than he had done over the distance. Tonelli did so with an uneven arm technique due to the uneven strength in his arms. He began to lose ground in the last 50m and was a bodylength behind until a late surge brought him <b>to</b> <b>within</b> <b>a</b> metre by the end of his leg. Brooks then executed a powerful, well-timed dive and surfaced almost even with his Soviet counterpart. He had drawn level by the halfway mark and made a superior turn to take the lead. The Soviet freestyler pulled level at the 25m mark before Brooks again sprinted away to seal an Australian victory by 0.22s. Brooks had finished his leg in 49.86s as he had vowed to his teammates. The time of 3m 45.70s sealed Australia's first ever win in a medley relay at the Olympics, for men or women. The team then made a celebratory dive into the pool and were interviewed poolside. In 2000, Kerry and the other members of the quartet were each awarded the Australian Sports Medal for their victory in Moscow.|$|E

Beth Israel's rabbi, Yisroel Shiff, who had evacuated to Tennessee before Katrina hit, contacted Rabbi Isaac Leider, who had worked on ZAKA search-and-rescue teams in Israel for five years. After contacting federal officials and the Louisiana National Guard, Leider hired a helicopter to fly him <b>to</b> <b>within</b> <b>a</b> mile of Beth Israel, met with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) search-and-rescue team appointed to retrieve the scrolls. The group used rubber rafts to reach Beth Israel and enter it, where Leider waded into the sanctuary and rescued the Torah scrolls and their silver ornaments.|$|E
5|$|California {{governor}} Jerry Brown {{declared a}} state of emergency for the city of San Francisco on August 23, after the fire caused damage to the power infrastructure serving the Bay Area, causing two out of the existing three hydroelectric power plants to shut down. The fire also threatened the Hetch Hetchy reservoir, the main source of water for San Francisco, providing up to 85% of the city's supply to 2.6 million customers. On August 26, the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission moved water away from Hetch Hetchy into downstream reservoirs located in San Mateo and Alameda Counties as a precautionary measure, but did not expect the fire to cause any disruption to the city's water supply. The fire advanced <b>to</b> <b>within</b> <b>a</b> mile of Hetch Hetchy by Monday, August 26, which was a concern to O'Shaughnessy Dam officials due to ash falling in the water.|$|E

5|$|During a flyby on 26 September 2012, Cassinis radar {{detected}} in Titan's northern polar region {{what is likely}} a river with a length of more than 400 kilometers. It has been compared with the much larger Nile river on Earth. This feature is connected to Ligeia Mare. Later, a paper ("Liquid-filled Canyons on Titan") published on Geophysical Research Letters on 9 August 2016 reported about the May 2013 Cassini RADAR altimeter observation of Vid Flumina channels, defined as a drainage network connected to Titan's second largest hydrocarbon sea, Ligeia Mare. Analysis of the received altimeter echoes showed that the channels are located in deep (up to ~570 m), steep-sided, canyons and have strong specular surface reflections that indicate they are currently liquid filled. Elevations of the liquid in these channels are {{at the same level}} as Ligeia Mare <b>to</b> <b>within</b> <b>a</b> vertical precision of about 0.7 m, consistent with the interpretation of drowned river valleys. Specular reflections are also observed in lower order tributaries elevated above the level of Ligeia Mare, consistent with drainage feeding into the main channel system. This is likely the first direct evidence of the presence of liquid channels on Titan and the first observation of hundred-meter deep canyons on Titan. Vid Flumina canyons are thus drowned by the sea {{but there are a few}} isolated observations to attest to the presence of surface liquids standing at higher elevations.|$|E

DeBerg's 1-yard touchdown pass to Jimmie Giles brought the Buccaneers <b>to</b> <b>within</b> <b>a</b> touchdown before halftime, but they were unable to score in the second half.

5|$|Even by May 1943 Mark II ASV (Air-to-surface-vessel) {{was still}} being used. By then the German Metox {{receivers}} could detect the 1.5m radiations. A variable condenser was installed as an interim solution to reduce {{the strength of the}} signal. This gave U-boats the impression the aircraft was moving away from it. There was a radical change in 1943 with radar equipment when the ASV Mark III was becoming available. Based on RAF Bomber Command's H2S, it transmitted a much shorter wavelength of 9.1cm instead of 1.5m as with Mark Is and IIs and could not be detected by Metox receivers in U-boats. Instead of fixed aerials there was a rotary scanner, and thus the return signals gave a visual trace through 360 degrees on a CRT known as the Plan Position Indicator (PPI). The Mark II would only cover a forward arc, unlike the Mark III. The Mark III would indicate surface vessels via a dot on the screen while the coast would be given in the shape of an outline. Targets remained visible on the screen <b>to</b> <b>within</b> <b>a</b> quarter of a mile. The Mark III also suffered much less from 'sea return' obscuring targets at short range.|$|E
