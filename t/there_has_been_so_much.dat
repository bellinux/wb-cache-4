500|$|Overmars was {{selected}} in the squad for the 1998 World Cup, staged in France. Before the tournament began, he scored two goals in a friendly against Paraguay. He was on the scoresheet in the national team's 5–0 win against South Korea in the group stage. As the tournament progressed, Overmars felt the Netherlands were [...] "getting better and better" [...] and believed they could win the World Cup: [...] "Believe me, we can do it. In the past, <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> talk about our side {{and a lot of}} pressure with people calling us favourites. This time, nobody seemed to expect anything. In fact, people would come up to me in the street and say we were only dark horses to win." [...] While training before the quarter-final match against Argentina, he sustained an injury which seemingly ruled him out of contention. He did feature late into the game as a substitute, but aggravated his injury. He was subsequently forced to sit out the entire semi-final against Brazil, which the Netherlands lost on penalties.|$|E

It has to stop!". He also called the bombardment and destruction of the city a [...] "dark chapter" [...] in modern history: ...|$|E
2500|$|The film {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Behindwoods gave {{two and a}} half out of five stars citing that the film had a [...] "loose screenplay" [...] but was compensated by a [...] "power packed performance" [...] by the actors. The reviewer compared Arya and Vishal Krishna saying [...] "Unlike Vishal, Arya doesn’t have much scope over performance, but manages to remain under spotlights with his rib-tickling comedy tracks and dialogue delivery. Although we have the signature as ‘A Film By Bala’ during final credits, it’s worth mentioning that the film completely belongs to Vishal." [...] A reviewer from in.com gave three and half out of five and said that the movie is a [...] "definite watch for Bala's followers and to watch the new Vishal emerge as a performer". Further praising Vishal, the critic stats, [...] "there is no doubt that {{from the beginning of the}} making of the film, <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> riding on Vishal's character as he has been playing the role of a squint and has done a fab job." [...] Rohit Ramachandran of nowrunning.com gave it two out of five stars stating that [...] "Avan Ivan, in the end, is Vishal and Arya battling for recognition in the acting arena." [...] Supergoodmovies also gave three and a half stars and concluded that [...] "Avan Ivan will not let down the audience. Though not a typical Bala film, a feel of joy creeps as we watch the film. It is one of the best technically made movies by Bala so far." ...|$|E

6000|$|He added awkwardly: [...] "Since we started, <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> to {{hold the}} attention. I {{remember}} a mood--an immense despair.

This new region was the famous country which the Norsemen called Vineland, and of which every schoolboy has read. <b>There</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> dispute as to whether Vineland--this warm country where grapes grew wild--was Nova Scotia or New England, or some other region, that it is worth while to read {{the account of the}} Norse saga, {{literally}} translated: ...|$|E

6000|$|I {{could not}} deny {{a word of}} this, and {{had nothing to say}} to it in general. 'But why, then,' says I, 'can you persuade me to such a horrid step as leaving you, since you have not left me?

Then, again, trustees are so circumscribed nowadays that they are afraid to do anything. <b>There</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> said lately, Mr Gresham, that a man doesn't know where he is, or what he is doing. Nobody trusts anybody. There have been such terrible things that we can't wonder at it. Only think of the case of those Hills! How can any one expect that any one else will ever trust a lawyer again after that? But that's Mr Bideawhile's bell. How can any one expect it? He will see you now, I dare say, Mr Gresham." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>There</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> {{talk about}} the mysterious [...] "wild man" [...] {{out there in the}} West for some time, that I finally felt it was my duty to go out and {{interview}} him. There was something peculiarly and touchingly romantic about the creature and his strange actions, according to the newspaper reports. He was represented as being hairy, long-armed, and of great strength and stature; ugly and cumbrous; avoiding men, but appearing suddenly and unexpectedly to women and children; going armed with a club, but never molesting any creature, except sheep, or other prey; fond of eating and drinking, and not particular about the quality, quantity, or character of the beverages and edibles; living in the woods like a wild beast, but never angry; moaning, and sometimes howling, but never uttering articulate sounds.|$|E
60|$|He {{does not}} seem to have seen a {{newspaper}} during those wanderings, and a chance sight of the transparency of a kiosk in the market-place at Bishop's Stortford announcing a 'Grave International Situation' did not excite him very much. <b>There</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> many grave international situations in recent years.|$|R

60|$|This interview, {{about which}} <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> {{controversy}} in the newspapers, and denials and counter-denials from the press bureaus of both gentlemen,--this now historic interview began at four o'clock precisely the next day. At that hour Mr. Crewe was ushered into that little room in which Mr. Flint worked when at Fairview. Like Frederick the Great and other famous captains, Mr. Flint believed in an iron bedstead regime. The magnate was, as usual, fortified behind his oak desk; the secretary with a bend in his back was in modest evidence; and an elderly man of comfortable proportions, with a large gold watch-charm portraying the rising sun, and who gave, somehow, the polished impression of a marble, sat near the window smoking a cigar. Mr. Crewe approached the desk with that genial and brisk manner {{for which he was}} noted and held out his hand to the railroad president.|$|E
6000|$|... "The rain which flooded our fields the Sunday before last, was followed, as {{you will}} remember, by bright days, of which Tuesday the 20th (February, 1872) was, in London, notable for the splendor, towards the afternoon, of its white cumulus clouds. <b>There</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> black east wind lately, and so much fog and {{artificial}} gloom, besides, that I find it is actually some two years since I last saw a noble cumulus cloud under full light. I chanced to be standing under the Victoria Tower at Westminster, when the largest mass of them floated past, that day, from the northwest; and I was more impressed than ever yet by the awfulness of the cloud-form, and its unaccountableness, in {{the present state of}} our knowledge. The Victoria Tower, seen against it, had no magnitude: it was like looking at Mont Blanc over a lamp-post. The domes of cloud-snow were heaped as definitely: their broken flanks were as gray and firm as rocks, and the whole mountain, of a compass and height in heaven which only became more and more inconceivable as the eye strove to ascend it, was passing behind the tower with a steady march, whose swiftness must in reality have been that of a tempest: yet, along all the ravines of vapor, precipice kept pace with precipice, and not one thrust another.|$|E
6000|$|And now observe, {{that this}} selfishness--this {{wholesome}} state of equilibrium--this philosophic calm, {{which is really}} only a lazy pride, was, {{as far as we}} can tell, the main object of all the schools from the time of Alexander to the Christian era. We know very little of those Sceptics, Cynics, Epicureans, Academics, Peripatetics, Stoics, of whom <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> talk, except at second-hand, through the Romans, from whom Stoicism in after ages received a new and not ignoble life. But this we do know of the later sets, that they gradually gave up the search for truth, and propounded to themselves as the great type for a philosopher, How shall a man save his own soul from this evil world? They may have been right; it may have been the best thing to think about in those exhausted and decaying times: but it was a question of ethics, not of philosophy, in the sense which the old Greek sages put on that latter word. Their object was, not to get at the laws of all things, but to fortify themselves against all things, each according to his scheme, and so to be self-sufficient and alone. Even in the Stoics, who boldly and righteously asserted an immutable morality, this was the leading conception. As has been well said of them: ...|$|E
