25|$|In Scott's first appearance, {{his body}} would glow green or be {{bathed in a}} green light {{whenever}} he used his power, such as passing through a wall or flying. During his earliest appearances, he would project a beam of green light from his ring <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> {{a variety of things}} such as move objects, melt metal, shrink objects, or put out fires. He rarely used it as an actual weapon and preferred to fight with his fists like any other pulp-adventure hero would do. The ring made him invulnerable to any weapon not made of wood.|$|E
25|$|The War of the Spanish Succession {{and later}} Napoleonic Wars allowed {{politics}} {{to once again}} influence the fortune of Sherry and its producers. Sales to England and the Netherlands were dramatically reduced as hostilities increased. European tastes also started to change as {{the emergence of the}} more accessible port wine hit the world's wine market-being particularly encouraged by the favorable Methuen Treaty. This left many Sherry merchants with excess stock <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> little more than sit and age in oak barrels. Unlike during the boom market when Sherry makers were selling their stocks {{as fast as they could}} produce it, these aging stocks began to slightly oxidize and develop more concentrated and nutty flavors.|$|E
25|$|Senior {{leadership}} {{was also an}} issue. Mussolini personally assumed control of all three individual military service ministries {{with the intention of}} influencing detailed planning. Comando Supremo (the Italian High Command) consisted of only a small complement of staff <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> little more than inform the individual service commands of Mussolini's intentions, after which it was up to the individual service commands to develop these into proper plans and execute. The result was that there was no central direction for operations and the three military services tended to work independently, focusing only on their fields, with little inter-service cooperation. The Army itself was essentially split into two different institutions; those institutionally loyal to the king (Regio Esercito) and those to Mussolini, and discrepancies in pay existed for personnel of equal rank, but from different units.|$|E

25|$|Sikorsky S-76 SHADOW : Boeing-Sikorsky MANPRINT study. The {{original}} {{concept of}} the LHX program was to produce a one-man helicopter <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> more than a two-man aircraft. The Sikorsky (S-76) Helicopter Advance Demonstrator of Operators Workload (SHADOW) had a single-pilot advanced cockpit grafted to its nose. The purpose was to study the MANPRINT or human engineering interface between the pilot and the cockpit controls and displays. The cockpit was the prototype of a single-pilot cockpit designed for use on the prototype RAH-66 Comanche armed reconnaissance helicopter. The cockpit was designed so sensors would feed data to the pilot through helmet mounted displays. The MANPRINT study determined that single-pilot operation of the Comanche was unsafe, and would result in pilot overload. As result of this study, the Comanche {{was designed to be}} operated by a crew of two.|$|E
25|$|Ulam and von Neumann {{created a}} method for calculating liquid motion in the late 1950s. The driving concept of the method was to {{consider}} a liquid {{as a group of}} discrete units and calculate the motion of each based on its neighbors' behaviors. Thus was born the first system of cellular automata. Like Ulam's lattice network, von Neumann's cellular automata are two-dimensional, with his self-replicator implemented algorithmically. The result was a universal copier and constructor working within a cellular automaton with a small neighborhood (only those cells that touch are neighbors; for von Neumann's cellular automata, only orthogonal cells), and with 29 states per cell. Von Neumann gave an existence proof that a particular pattern would make endless copies of itself within the given cellular universe by designing a 200,000 cell configuration <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> so. This design is known as the tessellation model, and is called a von Neumann universal constructor.|$|E
25|$|The air-sea rescue squadrons of the ASRS flew {{a variety}} of aircraft, usually hand me downs {{rejected}} or withdrawn from front line service by the RAF's other branches or {{as in the case}} of the Walrus begged from the Navy. They used Supermarine Spitfires and Boulton Paul Defiants to patrol for downed aircrew and Avro Ansons to drop supplies and dinghies. Supermarine Walrus and Supermarine Sea Otter amphibious craft were used to pick up aircrew from the water. Larger aircraft were used to drop airborne lifeboats. Although the Walrus and Sea Otters could pick up survivors in calm seas, further out to sea and in rougher waters, it was still not possible for aircraft to routinely pick up survivors, the large flying boats <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> so, such as the Catalinas and Short Sunderlands of Coastal Command, had many other jobs to do and were not always available. The role of aircraft in the ASRS therefore, was to locate downed airmen and to keep them alive, by dropping them survival equipment and stores, until an ASRS launch, or one from the Royal Navy's Naval Sea Rescue Services, arrived to pick them up. Generally MCS launches had responsibility for the Channel and North Sea, and Navy ones for the Western Approaches.|$|E

25|$|One major {{hallmark}} of McNamara's cost reductions was {{the consolidation of}} programs from different services, most visibly in aircraft acquisition, believing that the redundancy created waste and unnecessary spending. McNamara directed the Air Force to adopt the Navy's F-4 Phantom and A-7 Corsair combat aircraft, a consolidation that was quite successful. Conversely, his actions in mandating a premature across-the-board adoption of the untested M16 rifle proved catastrophic when the weapons began to fail in combat. McNamara tried to extend his success by merging development programs as well, resulting in the TFX dual service F-111 project. It was to combine Navy requirements for an Fleet Air Defense (FAD) aircraft and Air Force requirements for a tactical bomber. His experience {{in the corporate world}} led him to believe that adopting a single type for different missions and service would save money. He insisted on the General Dynamics entry over the DOD's preference for Boeing because of commonality issues. Though heralded as a fighter <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> everything (fast supersonic dash, slow carrier and short airfield landings, tactical strike, and even close air support), in the end it involved too many compromises to succeed at any of them. The Navy version was drastically overweight and difficult to land, and eventually canceled after a Grumman study showed it was incapable of matching the abilities of the newly revealed Soviet MiG-23 and MiG-25 aircraft. The F-111 would eventually find its niche as a tactical bomber and electronic warfare aircraft with the Air Force.|$|E
500|$|Reviews of the {{new book}} were as {{complimentary}} as those for its predecessors. The Times Literary Supplement wrote, [...] "French Provincial Cooking needs to be read rather than referred to quickly. It discourses at some length the type and origin of the dishes popular in various French regions, as well as the culinary terms, herbs and kitchen equipment used in France. But those who can give the extra time to this book will be well repaid by dishes such as La Bourride de Charles BÃ©rot and Cassoulet ColombiÃ©." [...] The Observer said that it was difficult to think of any home <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> without the book and called David [...] "a very special kind of genius".|$|E
500|$|The artistic {{style was}} meant to portray a vibrant {{underwater}} world, but the team also needed to prevent activity on-screen from overwhelming the player, so a stylized look was chosen to both maintain the game's artistic style and {{reduce the amount of}} [...] "visual noise". Environmental editing was a big issue for the team, with much of their early development dedicated to creating editing tools <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> small-scale edits to environments after they had been locked down. When creating the environments, Nava drew on his experience developing Flower for Thatgamecompany, creating sporadically scattered interaction points that triggered with player exploration and triggered new life or new elements within each environment. Since there was no dedicated animator, the team needed to use multiple techniques for animation the diver, fish and flexible vegetation: the diver used a skeletal animation run through a complex state machine, vegetation such as seaweed used rope physics, while fish mainly used mathematical motion in combination with morph target posing to remove the need of individual skeletal structures.|$|E

[...] Lacroix also commented [...] "If you missed it, get the replay. Don't think, just do it [...] the main event is well worth the price." [...] The main event was given Lacroix's highest match rating of 10 out of 10 in his review. He gave his lowest rating of 4 out of 10 to the opening Six Man Tag Team match. The NWA World Heavyweight Championship bout was ranked with a 7.5 out of 10, while a 7 out of 10 {{was given to the}} NWA World Tag Team Championship contest. Commenting on the main event, Lacroix spoke of it as a [...] "certified match of the year candidate." [...] Going onto describe in detail: [...] "Unbreakable came to a close with mind-boggling main event, featuring a three-way dance between Samoa Joe against AJ Styles against X Division champion Christopher Daniels for the championship title.

Fact is there is no review <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> justice in describing just how stellar this bout was."
