5|$|A white dwarf, {{also called}} a {{degenerate}} dwarf, is a stellar core remnant composed mostly of electron-degenerate matter. A white dwarf is very dense: its mass is comparable <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> the Sun, while its volume is comparable <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> Earth. A white dwarf's faint luminosity {{comes from the}} emission of stored thermal energy; no fusion {{takes place in a}} white dwarf wherein mass is converted to energy. The nearest known white dwarf is Sirius B, at 8.6 light years, the smaller component of the Sirius binary star. There are currently thought to be eight white dwarfs among the hundred star systems nearest the Sun. The unusual faintness of white dwarfs was first recognized in 1910. The name white dwarf was coined by Willem Luyten in 1922.|$|E
5|$|Although group 12 {{lies in the}} d-block of {{the modern}} 18-column {{periodic}} table, the d electrons of zinc, cadmium, and (almost always) mercury behave as core electrons and do not take part in bonding. This behavior is similar <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> the main-group elements, but is in stark contrast <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> the neighboring group 11 elements (copper, silver, and gold), which also have filled d-subshells in their ground-state electron configuration but behave chemically as transition metals. For example, the bonding in chromium(II) sulfide (CrS) involves mainly the 3d electrons; that in iron(II) sulfide (FeS) involves both the 3d and 4s electrons; but that of zinc sulfide (ZnS) involves only the 4s electrons and the 3d electrons behave as core electrons. Indeed, useful comparison can be made between their properties and the first two members of group 2, beryllium and magnesium, and in earlier short-form periodic table layouts, this relationship is illustrated more clearly. For instance, zinc and cadmium are similar to beryllium and magnesium in their atomic radii, ionic radii, electronegativities, {{and also in the}} structure of their binary compounds and their ability to form complex ions with many nitrogen and oxygen ligands, such as complex hydrides and amines. However, beryllium and magnesium are small atoms, unlike the heavier alkaline earth metals and like the group 12 elements (which have a greater nuclear charge but the same number of valence electrons), and the periodic trends down group 2 from beryllium to radium (similar <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> the alkali metals) are not as smooth when going down from beryllium to mercury (which is more similar <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> the p-block main groups) due to the d-block and lanthanide contractions. It is also the d-block and lanthanide contractions that give mercury many of its distinctive properties.|$|E
