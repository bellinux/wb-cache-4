There are 18.4 cm wide tracks with 131 small links and three bogies per side, sprung by small leaf springs, carry each two small road wheels. The prototype had an armoured plate protecting this assembly {{but it was}} omitted on the production vehicles to save weight, leaving only two elongated beams to brace the whole.

This is compensated by limiting the official maximum speed to thirty kilometres per hour, although {{the combination of a}} weight of just 2.64 metric tons with an engine power of 38 hp would allow for a higher speed; during testing 36 km/h was attainable. This also reduces the chance of accidents while towing the trailer; fully loaded the road speed is reduced to 25 km/h, the cross-country speed to ten km/h.

Remarkably, the hallmark antiviral cytokine IFNb is only expressed in lung epithelial cells containing DVGs, while cells within the lung that contain standard viral genomes alone do not express this cytokine. Together, our data indicate that DVGs generated during viral replication are a primary source of danger signals for the initiation of the host {{immune response}} to infection...|$|E
40|$|Increased {{tendencies of}} {{prefabricated}} bridges to form fissures as of approx. 1993 / 94 {{in combination with}} specific field and laboratory observations and initial microscopic studies at {{the middle of the}} 90 's led to suspicion of complex expansion reaction damage to a certain generation of bridges after stand for a period of approx. 15 to 20 years. The prerequisites for formation of fissures resulting from chemical expansion reactions as well as shrinking processes were present in terms of the production conditions. Eight bridge structures were selected for the study. All structures were multiple field viaduct structures consisting of beam row support structures with BT 70 elements. Various studies were performed for clarification of the formation hypothesis including: determination of the residual expansion potential under reaction-accelerating conditions, characterization of the expansion causes, identification of the reaction carriers, micro-analytic structural analysis, representation and characterization of selected specimen properties, determination of the depth-dependent sulfatization gradients, determination of the climatic conditions within the BT 70 caissons, numerical fissure pattern simulation, reconstruction of the material and thermo-technical production conditions for the period from 1966 to 1990 based on the study 'Chronological documentation of the construction of bridge prefabricated parts [...] . '. In terms of the damage mechanisms to the BT elements, the assumption was confirmed during the studies that the elements cracked open on the bottom {{even in the face of}} slight remaining expansion. This corresponds to the linear fissure course, usually at one half the carrier length on the greatest crack widths and particularly the fact that no fissures were recognizable in the non-pretensioned upper area of the prefabricated parts. The prefabricated giders of <b>the</b> <b>production</b> <b>type</b> 'immediate bonding' have proven to be more subject to damage than the giders of <b>the</b> <b>production</b> <b>type</b> 'subsequent bonding'. The expansion potentials of the spanning members and supports, followed by the edge girders, studied showed considerably lower expansion potentials than the standard girders. Based on the results obtained from X-ray electronic and microscopic studies, it can be assumed that the formation of the typical fissures parallel to the longitudinal axis at the bottom of the superstructure prefabricated parts (also particularly supported by the results of the numeric fissure pattern simulation) can be associated with the effect of chemical flow reactions. Also, from the degree of subsequent reactions, it can be estimated that the role of the secondary ettingit formation is primary and the influence of the alkaline silicic acid reaction secondary.

40|$|In France, {{after the}} ban on meat and bone meal (MBM) in cattle feeding in June 1990, cases of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) have {{continued}} to be detected in bovines born after that ban (called BAB cases). A case-control study was therefore carried out to determine the way these cases were contaminated. A multivariate conditional model was built adjusting for <b>the</b> <b>production</b> <b>type</b> of the animals and {{taking into account the}} herd size. The results confirmed that feeding cattle with proprietary concentrates was at risk for BSE, with an adjusted odds ratio of 6. 8 (2. 5; 18. 7) for the consumption of less or three different proprietary concentrates and 17. 6 (5. 7; 54. 8) for more than three, when comparing with no consumption of proprietary concentrates, considering feeding of bovines before the age of two. The results suggest that cross-contaminations by MBM in bovine concentrates have occurred after 1990. To a lesser extent, on-farm cross-contaminations, i. e. consumption by cattle of feedstuffs initially dedicated to other animals and which could legally contain MBM, have probably also existed, since the presence on farms of poultry fed purchased feed involved an increased risk of BSE with an odds ratio of 1. 8 (1. 1; 3. 0).

Using the ban on synthetic pesticides and restricted use of antibiotics, including the requirements to compensate for and prevent such uses in organic farming, as examples, {{the positive and negative}} contributions of organic farming in relation to selected public goods were analysed. The contributions of organic farming to Nature and Biodiversity and Human and Animal Health and Welfare are mainly positive compared to conventional farming for all farm types, whilst the effects on Environment and Energy and Climate are mixed; i. e. some effects are positive and others are negative. The analysis revealed a need for further documentation and revision of the organic principles and specific organic requirements— in particular in relation to the public goods Energy and Climate, which at present are not addressed in the EU Organic Regulation. Moreover, some organic farming requirements and practices cause dilemmas; e. g. more space per animal and outdoor access improves Animal Health and Welfare {{but at the same time}} has negative effects on Environment, Energy Consumption and Climate Change.

There were significant (P < 0. 05) differences among AR E. coli prevalence levels of (i) the host species, in which swine isolates were at higher risk for resistance to tetracycline, kanamycin, ceftiofur, gentamicin, streptomycin, chloramphenicol, sulfisoxazole, and ampicillin; (ii) the swine production group, in which purchased boars, nursery piglets, and breeding boars isolates had a higher risk of resistance to streptomycin and tetracycline; and iii) the vocation cohorts, in which swine worker cohort isolates exhibited lower sulfisoxazole and cefoxitin prevalence than the non-swine worker cohorts, while the slaughter plant worker cohort isolates exhibited elevated cefoxitin prevalence compared to that of non-swine workers. While a high variability was observed among seasonal samples over the 3 -year period, no significant temporal trends were apparent.

Consequently, a cross-sectional serological survey of the Dutch poultry population was executed in {{the second week of}} March 2003. The basic requirements set were detection of a 5 % prevalence of flocks exposed to LPAI virus with 95 % confidence within <b>the</b> <b>production</b> <b>type</b> stratification level within each province in the Netherlands. Because of supposed higher risk of avian influenza infections in ducks, turkeys and free-range poultry, all the commercial flocks of these production types present in the Netherlands were sampled. The serological screening of 28018 sera from 1193 randomly selected poultry farms, located outside surveillance zones showed that LPAI H 7 virus infections had occurred on three neighbouring farms all located in the southwest of the Netherlands. No antibodies against the neuraminidase N 7 subtype were detected in the sera of these farms, indicating that the subtype was different from the HPAI H 7 N 7 subtype that caused the avian influenza epidemic in 2003. In addition, evidence of infections with non-H 5 or non-H 7 subtypes of influenza A virus were obtained in two other farms located in the northeast and the southeast of the Netherlands.
