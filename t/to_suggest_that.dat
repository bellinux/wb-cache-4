5|$|Bellinger is {{the only}} Ireland King of Arms known to have made any grants of arms. However two of his four known grants were annulled and or regranted, because their {{recipients}} were within the heraldic jurisdiction of other kings of arms. There is no evidence <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> any Ireland Kings of Arms ever attempted to exercise control over the heraldic practice of Ireland.|$|E
5|$|H3 and H6 do {{not share}} such a convincing suite of Heinrich event {{symptoms}} as events H1, H2, H4, and H5, which has led some researchers <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> they are not true Heinrich events. That would make Gerard C. Bond's suggestion of Heinrich events fitting into a 7,000-year cycle ("Bond events") suspect.|$|E

5|$|Jesé {{struggled}} {{to settle in}} Paris, however, {{and by the end}} of the year he had only started in one of his nine league appearances for the club.

5|$|There is {{very limited}} data on reproduction. Young are {{probably}} born near {{the start of the}} rainy season, in November–December, when food is plentiful. Six bats were caught at the roost site in Kianjavato, of which only one was a male; this led Bates and colleagues <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> the species may be polygynous, with groups consisting of a male and multiple females.|$|E

5|$|A {{decade after}} the fact, during {{the second round of}} child abuse allegations, Jackson's lawyers would file a memo stating that the 1994 {{settlement}} was made without his consent. A later disclosure by the FBI of investigation documents compiled over nearly 20 years led Jackson's attorney <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> no evidence of molestation or sexual impropriety from Jackson toward minors existed. According to reports, the Department of Children and Family Services (Los Angeles County) investigated Jackson beginning in 1993 with the Chandler allegation and again in 2003. Reports show the LAPD and DCFS did not find credible evidence of abuse or sexual misconduct.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} authors {{have noted that}} the two explanations, as a {{chemical}} defence against predators and as a chemical defence against ectoparasites, are not mutually exclusive, and evidence for both explanations exists. The fact that the highest concentrations of toxins are bound in the feathers of the breast and belly, in both pitohuis and ifrits, has caused scientists <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> the toxins rub off on eggs and nestlings providing protection against predators and nest parasites.|$|E

5|$|After Pantjawarna, Fred Young drew Njoo and {{his wife}} to the newly {{established}} Majestic Film. Deprived of their director and main star, Oriental hired the journalist Sutan Usman Karim to direct their fourth production, Panggilan Darah (Call of Blood). This film, written by Karim and starring Dhalia and Soerip, told of two young orphans {{as they tried to}} eke a living in Batavia. This film, which debuted in June 1941, prominently featured the cigarette factory Nitisemito, leading the Indonesian film historian Misbach Yusa Biran <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> it may have paid for the advertisement. He records it as a modest success, although he notes that reviews were mixed.|$|E
5|$|Appropriate {{antibiotics}} {{decrease the}} average 3–5 day duration of symptoms by about one day, and also reduce contagiousness. They are primarily prescribed to reduce rare complications such as rheumatic fever and peritonsillar abscess. The arguments {{in favor of}} antibiotic treatment should be balanced by the consideration of possible side effects, and it is reasonable <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> no antimicrobial treatment be given to healthy adults who have adverse reactions to medication or those at low risk of complications. Antibiotics are prescribed for strep throat at a higher rate than would be expected from how common it is.|$|E

5|$|Archeologists {{believe the}} first humans to inhabit the Rogue River region were nomadic hunters and gatherers. Radiocarbon dating {{suggests}} that they arrived in southwestern Oregon at least 8,500 years ago. At least 1,500 years before the first contact with whites, the natives established permanent villages along streams. Even so, no evidence has been found <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> any of the native peoples, such as the Takelma who lived along the Rogue and Applegate rivers in the 19thcentury, used the cave.|$|E
5|$|Between 24 April and 1 May, the IX Army {{fought a}} desperate action {{to break out}} of the pocket in an attempt to link up with the XII Army. Hitler assumed that after a {{successful}} breakout from the pocket, the IX Army could combine forces with the XII Army and would be able to relieve Berlin. There is no evidence <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> Generals Heinrici, Busse, or Wenck thought that this was even remotely strategically feasible, but Hitler's agreement to allow the IX Army to break through Soviet lines allowed many German soldiers to escape to the west and surrender to the United States Army.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} Devonian, land plants had {{stabilized}} freshwater habitats, allowing the first wetland ecosystems to develop, with increasingly complex food webs that afforded new opportunities. Freshwater habitats {{were not the}} only places to find water filled with organic matter and dense vegetation near the water's edge. Swampy habitats like shallow wetlands, coastal lagoons and large brackish river deltas also existed at this time, and there is much <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> {{this is the kind of}} environment in which the tetrapods evolved. Early fossil tetrapods have been found in marine sediments, and because fossils of primitive tetrapods in general are found scattered all around the world, they must have spread by following the coastal lines — they could not have lived in freshwater only.|$|E

5|$|Class distinction, however, became linked as {{the fashion}} of female homoeroticism passed. Tribades were {{simultaneously}} considered members of the lower class trying to ruin virtuous women, and representatives of an aristocracy corrupt with debauchery. Satirical writers began <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> political rivals (or more often, their wives) engaged in tribadism in order to harm their reputations. Queen Anne was rumored to have a passionate relationship with Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough, her closest adviser and confidante. When Churchill was ousted as the queen's favorite, she purportedly spread allegations of the queen having affairs with her bedchamberwomen. Marie Antoinette was also the subject of such speculation for some months between 1795 and 1796.|$|E
5|$|Congress is not {{prevented}} from legislating as to tribes generally; and {{this appears to}} be what it has done in successive versions of the Nonintercourse Act. There is nothing in the Act <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> ‘tribe’ is to be read to exclude a bona fide tribe not otherwise federally recognized. Nor, as the district court found, is there evidence of congressional intent or legislative history squaring with appellants' interpretation. Rather we find an inclusive reading consonant with the policy and purpose of the Act.|$|E
5|$|Considering the ICBM problem, {{the study}} went on <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> {{the system would}} have to be {{effective}} between 95 and 100% of the time in order to be worthwhile. They considered attacks against the RV while the missile was in the midcourse, just as it reached the highest point in its trajectory and was traveling at its slowest speed. Practical limitations eliminated this possibility, as it required the ABM to be launched {{at about the same time}} as the ICBM in order to meet in the middle, and they could not imagine a way to arrange this. Working at much shorter ranges, during the terminal phase, seemed the only possible solution.|$|E
