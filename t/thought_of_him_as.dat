25|$|In 105 BCE, Caepio {{refused to}} co-operate with his {{superior}} officer, Gnaeus Mallius Maximus, because he <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> a novus homo, deciding by himself {{to engage in}} battle against the Cimbri, on the Rhone. There, the Roman army suffered a crushing defeat and complete destruction, in the so-called Battle of Arausio (modern Orange).|$|E
25|$|After {{signing the}} Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868), Red Cloud led his {{people in the}} {{important}} transition to reservation life. Some of his US opponents mistakenly <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> overall leader of the Sioux (Dakota, Lakota, and Nakota) groups. The large tribe had several major divisions and was highly decentralized. Bands among the Oglala and other divisions operated independently, even though some individual leaders, such as Red Cloud, were renowned as warriors and highly respected as leaders.|$|E
25|$|One of Enju's allies. He also {{drank the}} moon spring water. He dresses up as a girl. It was shown {{that when he}} was young, he had ugly scars from an {{accident}} and that his fellow villagers <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> repulsive. One girl, Mai, the most beautiful girl in the village, befriended him because she thought he was pitiful. After Maimai became beautiful from the spring water, he murdered everyone from his village and killed Mai because he felt ugly in her presence. He is Princess Yuri's younger brother, and has the same soul symbol as she has. Soul Symbol: Beauty. Similarly to Maora from The Gentlemen's Alliance Cross, his physical appearance is drastically different dressing as a girl: he has a girly round eye shape and a delicate feminine neck as opposed to his masculine appearance.|$|E
60|$|It was {{characteristic}} of Jimmy {{that it never}} even occurred to him to desert the fallen one, and depart alone. Spike was his brother-in-arms. He would as soon have <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> deserting <b>him</b> <b>as</b> a sea-captain would of abandoning the ship.|$|R
60|$|He greeted Christie kindly, {{and then}} {{addressed}} himself to Mrs. Wilkins on various charitable matters, {{for he was}} a minister at large, and she one of his almoners. Christie could really see him now, for when he preached she forgot {{the man in the}} sermon, and <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> only <b>as</b> a visible conscience.|$|R
60|$|Henery Walker wouldn't {{listen to}} 'em, and {{he jumped up}} and carried on like a madman. His idea was for 'em all to club {{together}} to pay the money, and to borrow it from Smith, the landlord, to go on with. They wouldn't 'ear of it at fust, but arter Smith 'ad pointed out that they might 'ave {{to go to jail}} with Henery, and said things about 'is license, they gave way. Bob Pretty was just starting off to see Policeman White when they took the money, and instead o' telling <b>'im</b> wot they <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>'im,</b> <b>as</b> they 'ad intended, Henery Walker 'ad to walk alongside <b>of</b> <b>'im</b> and beg and pray <b>of</b> <b>'im</b> to take the money. He took it at last as a favor to Henery, and bought the hamper back with it next morning--cheap. Leastways, he said so.|$|R
25|$|The book is in four parts. The {{first part}} deals with Hayakawa's early career and rise to stardom (1914–15), with {{detailed}} information about the themes explored in his early films like The Wrath of the Gods (dealing with Buddhism) and The Cheat (masculinity, violence). The latter film brought him international fame. He married fellow actress Tsuru Aoki in 1914. The second and third parts discuss his films during 1916–18 and 1918–22, respectively, while the final part gives an account of his public image in both America and Japan. When Hayakawa started Haworth Picture Corporation, Japanese residents in America viewed it {{as a symbol of}} his success and entrepreneurship. However, his Americanization was viewed as a national shame in Japan. Americans, meanwhile, <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> a role model for Japanese settled in United States and an Americanized and refined Japanese. He left Hollywood in the late 1920s and moved to Europe, where he acted in English and French movies, before returning to Japan where he became a priest. Hayakawa's filmography is also provided in the book, with details about the characters he portrayed. The final chapter gives a detailed account of Hayakawa's role in The Bridge on the River Kwai and discusses the similarities between this role and the role played by Hayakawa in The Cheat. His stage works are also discussed in this chapter.|$|E
500|$|Gatski {{was a quiet}} man {{who liked}} to hunt. He {{practice}}d hitting targets with his bow and arrow at League Park in Cleveland, where the Browns trained during the season. He {{was one of the}} Browns [...] "Filthy Five" [...] players who did not wash their practice uniforms during the season. Brown called him one of the strongest men on the team's roster. Graham <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> sure protection against opposing linemen. Teammates called him an [...] "iron man" [...] and a [...] "Rock of Gibraltar". He was named to All-Pro lists in all but one year between 1951 and 1955.|$|E
500|$|In The Curse of Monkey Island, Elaine realises that Guybrush is {{her true}} love, and marries him. However, Ron Gilbert {{did not intend}} for the {{relationship}} between the characters to develop in this way, stating that Elaine [...] "never really liked Guybrush and <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> more of a little brother". Gilbert was not involved in the production of The Curse of Monkey Island; while thinking that the new development team [...] "did {{a pretty good job of}} capturing [...] what Monkey Island was about", the relationship between Elaine and Guybrush [...] "was the thing that bugged [...] the most about The Curse of Monkey Island".|$|E

50|$|Robert French (1690 - 29 May 1772) was an Irish {{judge of}} the Court of Common Pleas. He was {{extremely}} unpopular with his colleagues, who <b>thought</b> poorly <b>of</b> <b>him</b> both <b>as</b> a lawyer and a judge.|$|R
60|$|He was, however, {{too much}} {{overcome}} with joy {{to be able}} to do anything rationally. His anger against the earl totally evaporated; indeed, he only <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> now <b>as</b> a man who had a house in which he could meet his love. He rushed into the drawing-room, where his mother and sisters were sitting, and, with the two letters open in his hand, proclaimed his intention of leaving home that day.|$|R
500|$|Gandhi {{believed}} that his long acquaintance with Christianity {{had made him}} like {{it as well as}} find it imperfect. He asked Christians to stop humiliating his country and his people as heathens, idolators and other abusive language, and to change their negative views of India. He {{believed that}} Christians should introspect on the [...] "true meaning of religion" [...] and get a desire to study and learn from Indian religions in the spirit of universal brotherhood. According to Eric Sharpe – a professor of Religious Studies, though Gandhi was born in a Hindu family and later became Hindu by conviction, many Christians in time <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> an [...] "exemplary Christian and even as a saint".|$|E
500|$|Seinfeld regular John O'Hurley had {{auditioned for}} several roles {{on the show}} but Carter had not {{previously}} <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> [...] "an X-Files actor". For the part of Dr. Pollidori, however, Carter considered him [...] "the absolute perfect casting choice". Stewart Gale, who played Izzy Berkowitz, was a non-actor who {{was sitting on the}} back of a truck when Carter passed. Carter convinced Gale's father—who was initially suspicious of the director's credentials—to let Gale travel to Vancouver to take part in the episode. The characters of Izzy's friends were also played by inexperienced actors. One was a snake handler on the set of The X-Files feature film—the shooting of which overlapped that of season five—and the other worked at a Vancouver coffee shop that Carter frequented.|$|E
500|$|In 1960, Ronald William Clark {{published}} a biography titled Sir Mortimer Wheeler. FitzRoy Somerset, 4th Baron Raglan reviewed the volume for the journal Man, describing [...] "this very readable little book" [...] as being [...] "adulatory" [...] in tone, [...] "but hardly {{more so than}} its subject deserves." [...] In 1982, the archaeologist Jacquetta Hawkes {{published a}} second biography, Mortimer Wheeler: Adventurer in Archaeology. Hawkes admitted she had developed [...] "a very great liking" [...] for Wheeler, having first met him when she was an archaeology student at the University of Cambridge. She believed that he had [...] "a daemonic energy", with his accomplishments in India being [...] "almost superhuman". Ultimately, she <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> being [...] "an epic hero in an anti-heroic age" [...] in which growing social egalitarianism had stifled and condemned aspects of his greatness.|$|E
60|$|She <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> pleasantly, <b>as</b> {{he walked}} off down the road after the lumber and tools that were necessary. And, in his turn, he {{wondered}} whether she were a widow or not. It promised to be a pleasant job. She was quite handsome, in a serious way, he decided--very womanly and dignified. Perhaps this was his romance, he thought, with the ready imagination upon this point of a youth of twenty-one.|$|R

They seemed to say he wished her to {{remember}} {{he was an old}} friend of her cousin--that he understood, that it was all right. Isabel gave him her hand; she <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>him,</b> extravagantly, <b>as</b> a beautiful blameless knight.|$|R

500|$|As {{the coup}} plot began to solidify, Khánh {{came to the}} fore of the group. It has been {{concluded}} by some analysts that Khiêm—who went on to be Khánh's second in command in terms of real power after the coup was successful—was more pre-eminent during the early phases of the planning, but that as a Catholic who had been rapidly promoted by Diệm after changing religion, he [...] "did not dare to carry out a coup d'état himself out of fear that the Buddhists would react strongly against him and accuse him of trying to reestablish the Ngô Regime." [...] Another factor seen as vital in bringing Khánh to the forefront of the coup group {{was the fact that the}} US military leadership deemed Khánh more capable than Khiêm and equally likely to work in accordance with US interests. Khánh was highly regarded by Harkins, who <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> [...] "the strongest of all corps commanders." [...] According to a CIA assessment, Khánh had been [...] "consistently favorable to U.S. programs and advice".|$|E
500|$|Elgar having died in 1934, the {{authorities}} turned to Walton {{to compose a}} march in the Elgarian tradition for the coronation of George VI in 1937. His Crown Imperial was an immediate success with the public, but disappointed those of Walton's admirers who <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> an avant garde composer. Among Walton's other works from this decade are more film scores, including {{the first of his}} incidental music for Shakespeare adaptations, As You Like It (1936); a short ballet for a West End revue (1936); and a choral piece, In Honour of the City of London (1937). His most important work of the 1930s, alongside the symphony, was the Violin Concerto (1939), commissioned by Jascha Heifetz. The concerto, Walton later revealed, expressed his love for Alice Wimborne. Its strong romantic style caused some critics to label it retrogressive, and Walton said in a newspaper interview, [...] "Today's white hope is tomorrow's black sheep. These days it is very sad for a composer to grow old ... I seriously advise all sensitive composers to die at the age of 37. I know: I've gone through the first halcyon period and am just about ripe for my critical damnation." ...|$|E
500|$|... {{known as}} , {{was one of}} the most talented of the Uchiha clan. Shisui was the best friend of Itachi Uchiha; in fact, Itachi <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> an older brother. Shisui wanted to stop the Uchiha's coup against Konohagakure, but Danzo stole one of his eyes and so he gave his other eye to Itachi to protect the village and jumped off a cliff and died, then later found on the river by the Uchiha {{military}} policemen. He possessed a unique Mangekyo Sharingan ability called Kotoamatsukami, which enables the user to completely subject other people under their control without their knowledge. The eye stolen by Danzo is later used by him to manipulate people for his benefits, including Mifune during the Kage Summit, but it is lost after he commits a suicide attack against Sasuke. The eye given to Itachi, on the other hand, is placed in one of his crows and used to take him out of Kabuto's reanimation jutsu. Itachi then destroys it so it could not be used by anyone again. His voice actor in the Japanese anime is Hidenobu Kiuchi, while his voice actor in the English adaptation is Nicolas Roye.|$|E

She did not know the name of the person who said that and <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> only <b>as</b> [...] "Purple Flagman".|$|R
60|$|It {{was clear}} his only chance of concealing his {{bottomless}} baseness was {{to hold his}} tongue, and meanwhile he chipped with earnest care, and abased his soul before the very shadow of Miss Walshingham. She used to come and direct and advise him, with, he felt, an effort to conceal the scorn she had for him; and, indeed, {{it is true that}} at first she <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> chiefly <b>as</b> the clumsy young man with the red ears.|$|R
500|$|Hearsay and {{conjecture}} have clouded {{assessment of}} the Duchess of Windsor's life, not helped by her own manipulation of the truth. But there is no document which proves directly that she was {{anything other than a}} victim of her own ambition, who lived out a great romance that became a great tragedy. In the opinion of her biographers, [...] "she experienced the ultimate fairy tale, becoming the adored favourite of the most glamorous bachelor of his time. The idyll went wrong when, ignoring her pleas, he threw up his position {{to spend the rest of}} his life with her." [...] Academics agree that she ascended a precipice that [...] "left her with fewer alternatives than she had anticipated. Somehow she thought that the Establishment could be overcome once [...] was king, and she confessed frankly to Aunt Bessie about her 'insatiable ambitions'... Trapped by his flight from responsibility into exactly the role she had sought, suddenly she warned him, in a letter, 'You and I can only create disaster together'... she predicted to society hostess Sibyl Colefax, 'two people will suffer' because of 'the workings of a system'... Denied dignity, and without anything useful to do, the new Duke of Windsor and his Duchess would be international society's most notorious parasites for a generation, while they thoroughly bored each other... She had <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> emotionally a Peter Pan, and of herself an Alice in Wonderland. The book they had written together, however, was a Paradise Lost." [...] The Duchess herself is reported to have summed up her life in a sentence: [...] "You have no idea how hard it is to live out a great romance." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mavrogenes {{remained}} a controversial figure, and historians' opinions about him are often contradictory. The Romanian radical and historian Nicolae Bălcescu considered him an [...] "original and fantastic man, despising the aristocracy, but having pity of the low-ranking and poor people". However, another 19th century historian, Mihail Kogălniceanu <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> [...] "a new Caligula, a tyrant for the boyars, priests, merchants and peasants". [...] V. A. Urechia believed {{him to be}} in fact [...] "a great patriot and organizer", while A. D. Xenopol saw him as maniacal and cruel.|$|E
2500|$|On March 17, 1863, Stuart's cavalry {{clashed with}} a Union raiding party at Kelly's Ford.

He wrote to a Confederate Congressman, [...] "The noble, the chivalric, the gallant Pelham is no more. ... Let the tears of agony we have shed, and the gloom of mourning throughout my command bear witness."

Nutt went to the wedding as Thumb's best man, but resented his place in the show. He stayed away from women {{for a long time after}} the wedding. In 1879, he married Lilian Elston of Redwood City, California.|$|R

Julius Kroehl <b>thought</b> highly <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> {{evidenced}} by his will in bequeathing {{many of his}} papers and reference books.

I saw him at the head of a column of British cavalry, riding twenty yards in front, on a black horse. I <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> the very symbol of British Imperial power." [...] The Testimony Films 2012 documentary War Horse: The Real Story contained extensive discussion of the First World War service of Seely and his widely revered horse, Warrior. Warrior was adopted as his formation's mascot and had a reputation for bravery under fire. Warrior survived the war, dying in 1941 at the age of 33. In September 2014, the horse was posthumously awarded an honorary PDSA Dickin Medal for bravery.|$|E
2500|$|Wittgenstein, Russell's student, {{achieved}} considerable {{prominence in}} the philosophy of language after the posthumous publication of the Philosophical Investigations. In Russell's opinion, Wittgenstein's later work was misguided, and he decried its influence and that of its followers (especially members of the so-called [...] "Oxford school" [...] of ordinary language philosophy, who he believed were promoting a kind of mysticism). He wrote a foreword to Ernest Gellner's Words and Things which was a fierce attack on the Oxford School of Ordinary Language philosophy and Wittgenstein's later work and was supportive of Gellner in the subsequent academic dispute. However, Russell still held Wittgenstein and his early work in high regard, he <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>as,</b> [...] "perhaps the most perfect example I have ever known of genius as traditionally conceived, passionate, profound, intense, and dominating."
