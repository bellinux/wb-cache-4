However, it is particularly effective with...fiddle, mandolin, and vocal breaks. The deeper <b>tones</b> <b>of</b> the banjo counter-balance the higher pitched <b>tones</b> <b>of</b> the fiddle and mandolin, and {{the activity of the}} roll patterns creates a counter-melodywhich enhances the effectiveness of the melody.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>tones</b> <b>of</b> desert sand {{are called}} desert colors because they suggest {{the colors of}} the {{landscape}} of and of the design of the Native American cultures of the Southwestern United States. The desert colors are widely used (with both <b>tones</b> <b>of</b> sky blue or turquoise and <b>tones</b> <b>of</b> maroon to complement them) in Southwest Design.|$|R
5|$|In 1949, the {{political}} climate was changing and the ban on forming veterans' associations had been lifted. Encouraged by the shifting <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> the World War II discourse and the courting of the Wehrmacht veterans by the West German government and political parties, former Waffen-SS members came forward to campaign for their rights.|$|E
5|$|Le Guin was {{strongly}} opposed to and {{troubled by the}} Vietnam War, a reaction which played a large part in the <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> the novel. The <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> the novel is often harsh and hard-hitting, playing off the anger in the United States at American military actions in Vietnam. The tension between violence and non-violence {{is a part of}} the dialectic theme in the novel, of a constant tension between opposites. Through most of the novel, the Terran military is in control of the colony, despite Raj Lyubov's good intentions. Davidson is the most prominent example of the oppressiveness of the military government. There are intentional parallels drawn between the Terran colonizers and the US intervention in Vietnam; the anti-interventionist <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> the novel was in sharp contrast to other science-fiction novels about war written around the same period. For example, the high use of drugs amongst US troops in Vietnam is represented by the use of hallucinogens amongst the Terran soldiers, which Le Guin portrays as the norm on the colony.|$|E
5|$|The {{critical}} {{reception for}} the episode was mostly positive. Many reviewers {{commented that the}} dark <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> the final episode was characteristic of the series, and that killing off the protagonist was an appropriate way to conclude. The characters of Victor and Margaret returned in a short sketch for Comic Relief's Red Nose Day telethon on 16 March 2001.|$|E

5|$|The {{main title}} music, a tense, hurtling piece, sets the <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> {{impending}} violence, and returns three {{times on the}} soundtrack. Though nothing shocking occurs during the first 15–20 minutes of the film, the title music remains in the audience's mind, lending tension to these early scenes. Herrmann also maintains tension through the slower moments in the film {{through the use of}} ostinato.|$|E

5|$|Arp and Janco {{drifted away}} from the {{movement}} ca. 1919, when they created the Constructivist-inspired workshop Das Neue Leben. In Romania, Dada was awarded an ambiguous reception from Tzara's former associate Vinea. Although he was sympathetic to its goals, treasured Hugo Ball and Hennings and promised to adapt his own writings to its requirements, Vinea cautioned Tzara and the Jancos in favor of lucidity. When Vinea submitted his poem Doleanțe ("Grievances") {{to be published by}} Tzara and his associates, he was turned down, an incident which critics attribute to a contrast between the reserved <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> the piece and the revolutionary tenets of Dada.|$|E

5|$|Foster's {{flair for}} musical melodrama inspires Madonna {{to turn in}} what is easily her most assured and {{full-bodied}} vocal performance to date. Amid a swirl of strings and Spanish guitars, she spews the song's declaration of romantic independence with a theatrical verve that perfectly matches the stagey, potentially overpowering <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> Foster's arrangement without flying {{over the heads of}} her youthful top 40 following. A stunning effort that could easily become the 'I Will Survive' of this generation.|$|E

Trevor also increased the usage of more millennial based references, impersonations & characterisations for his comedy on the show, due to his younger demographic and his ability to speak in multiple accents and eight languages.|$|E

That is to say, the timbre is associated in experience with the receipt of gratification, has acquired a pleasure-giving quality, and consequently the tones which in music have an allied timbre become pleasure-giving and are called beautiful. Not that this is the sole cause of their pleasure-giving quality.... Still, in recalling the <b>tones</b> <b>of</b> instruments which approach the <b>tones</b> <b>of</b> the human voice, and observing that they seem beautiful in proportion to their approach, we see that this secondary æsthetic element is important." ...|$|R
5|$|In the {{drafts of}} the Alien Resurrection screenplay, writer Joss Whedon {{included}} a death {{scene in which}} a lifeform was sucked through {{a gap in the}} hull of a ship. In the second draft, Perez was sucked through a fist-sized breach in the hull of the Auriga; this was changed in the final version to the Newborn being sucked through the window of the Betty. 20th Century Fox executives were skeptical about the final version, seeing it as a comedic scene contrasting with the overall <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> the Alien franchise, but director Jean-Pierre Jeunet persuaded them to leave the scene in.|$|E
5|$|In the novel's final chapters, {{the three}} storylines {{intersect}} with increasing frequency. The <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> these chapters is especially dark as they deal primarily with the horrific torture {{and death of}} the assassins {{at the hands of}} the SIM, the failure of the coup, the rape of Urania, and the concessions made to Trujillo's most vicious supporters allowing them to enact their horrific revenge on the conspirators and then escape the country. The book ends as Urania prepares to return home, determined this time to keep in touch with her family back on the island.|$|E
5|$|It Was Written is {{the second}} studio album by American rapper Nas, {{released}} July 2, 1996 on Columbia Records in the United States. Following the moderate sales success of his acclaimed debut album, Illmatic (1994), Nas chose to focus his efforts in a more mainstream direction. Primarily produced by Trackmasters, it is a departure for him from the raw, underground <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> his debut album towards a more polished, mainstream sound. The album features mafioso and gangsta themes, and marks the first appearance of Nas's short-lived supergroup The Firm, which included rappers Foxy Brown, AZ, and Cormega.|$|E
