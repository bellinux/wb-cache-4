50|$|The third {{chapter of}} the Aitareya Upanishad teaches - तत्प्रज्ञानेत्रम् प्रज्ञाने प्रतिष्ठितं प्रज्ञानेत्रो लोकः प्रज्ञानं ब्रह्म (III.i.3) that all that exist, all {{phenomena}} cosmic and psychical, are rooted in Prajñā i.e. Consciousness, and Consciousness is Brahman, in which regard Sankara in his commentary states that Brahman gets the respective names and forms as conditioned by the divergent bodies; {{it is the same}} entity that has become diversified under all the conditions and is known in every way and is thought of multifariously by all creatures as well as logicians. And, in the Kaushitaki Upanishad III.iii.4, Indra describes 'Death' as complete absorption in Prana when Prānā and Prajñā ('consciousness' or 'self'), which together live in the body and together depart, become one. The main theme of Kaushitaki Upanishad is that without Prajñā the senses do not work, which is knowledge, for by knowledge one sees clearly; Prajñā is Brahman and all things are rooted in Brahman. Prānā is Prajñā, self-consciousness. It is Prajñā that <b>takes</b> <b>possession</b> <b>of</b> Speech, and by speech one obtains words; <b>takes</b> <b>possession</b> <b>of</b> the nose, and one obtains odours; <b>takes</b> <b>possession</b> <b>of</b> the eye, and one obtains all forms; <b>takes</b> <b>possession</b> <b>of</b> the ear, and one obtains all sounds; <b>takes</b> <b>possession</b> <b>of</b> the tongue, and one obtains all tastes <b>of</b> food; <b>takes</b> <b>possession</b> <b>of</b> the hands, and one obtains all actions; <b>takes</b> <b>possession</b> <b>of</b> the body, and one obtains pleasure and pain; <b>takes</b> <b>possession</b> <b>of</b> the organ, one obtains happiness, joy and offspring; <b>takes</b> <b>possession</b> <b>of</b> the feet, one obtains all movements and <b>takes</b> <b>possession</b> <b>of</b> mind, and one obtains all thoughts, without Prajñā, no thoughts succeed.|$|R

5|$|In September 1201 one of Coutances' suffragan bishops, Lisiard, the Bishop of Sées died. King John objected {{when the}} cathedral chapter {{attempted}} to elect {{one of their}} own members as his successor. Coutances refused to recognise the result of the election, and the chapter divided into two parties, one favouring the elected chapter member, the other party another choice. Both parties appealed to the papacy, who eventually approved of the election of the Archdeacon of Sées, Silvester. Coutances had the right to consecrate the bishop however, and he refused to do so, arguing that the king's choice had been disregarded. Pope Innocent III then ordered another Norman archbishop to consecrate Silvester, but the king refused to allow Silvester to <b>take</b> <b>possession</b> <b>of</b> his see. This led Innocent to order Normandy laid under an interdict, but eventually Silvester was allowed to <b>take</b> <b>possession</b> <b>of</b> Sees.|$|E

In its view, the Anglo–Dutch Treaty did not divide up the Singapore Strait, in which Pedra Branca is situated, between the new Johor Sultanate under the British sphere of influence and the Riau-Lingga Sultanate under Dutch influence. Instead, both Britain and the Netherlands could access the Strait freely. Therefore, there was a legal vacuum with regard to sovereignty over the island, enabling the British to lawfully <b>take</b> <b>possession</b> <b>of</b> it between 1847 and 1851.|$|E

Cleveland believed Arthur's order to be in violation of treaties with the tribes, and rescinded it on April 17 of that year, ordering the settlers out of the territory. Cleveland sent in eighteen companies of Army troops to enforce the treaties and ordered General Philip Sheridan, at the time Commanding General of the U. S. Army, to investigate the matter.|$|E
