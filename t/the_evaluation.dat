40|$|Although <b>the</b> student <b>evaluation</b> of {{teaching}} {{has been extensively}} researched, no general consensus has been reached {{about the validity of}} the process. One contentious issue has been the relationship between <b>the</b> <b>evaluations</b> and learning. If good instruction increases the amount of learning that takes place, then learning and <b>the</b> <b>evaluations</b> should be validly related to each other. A review of the literature shows that attempts to find such a nomological relationship has been complicated by practice, methodol-ogy, and interpretation. A meta-analysis of the literature shows that a small average relationship exists between learning and <b>the</b> <b>evaluations</b> but that <b>the</b> association is situational and not applicable to all teachers, academic disciplines, or levels of instruction. It is concluded that the more objectively learning is measured, the less likely it is to be related to <b>the</b> <b>evaluations...</b>|$|R

The robot saves most of them, including a girl named Selvi who was bathing at the time, but she is ashamed at being seen naked on camera and flees, only to be hit and killed by a truck. Vaseegaran asks for one month to modify Chitti's neural schema to enable it to understand human behaviour and emotions, to which Bohra agrees.

5|$|With the Mirage2000 and F-18L rejected, the RAAF {{was faced}} with a choice between the F-16 and F-18A. Richardson and several other RAAF pilots tested United States Air Force (USAF) F-16Bs in 1979 and 1980, and {{reported}} that the aircraft had excellent performance but could be difficult to control at times. <b>The</b> <b>evaluation</b> team was also concerned about the reliability of the F-16's engine and regarded the aircraft as technologically immature. It was also noted that the aircraft's radar was inferior to that of the F-18A, and that F-16s could not fire the beyond-visual-range (BVR) air-to-air missiles and long-range anti-shipping missiles that the F-18A was capable of operating. In contrast, <b>the</b> <b>evaluation</b> team was impressed by the F-18A, and regarded it as being a more robust and survivable aircraft as it had been designed to operate from aircraft carriers; these features were important for operations from bare bases in northern Australia. Richardson and three other RAAF pilots test-flew F-18As, and reported that the aircraft handled well, but had some deficiencies with its flight control system and engines; these were not seen as major flaws by <b>the</b> <b>evaluation</b> team, however. The F-18A's twin engines were considered to be its main advantage over the single-engined F-16, as research conducted by <b>the</b> <b>evaluation</b> team found that the attrition rate for single-engined fighters was twice that for aircraft with two engines. Overall, however, the RAAF judged that both the F-16 and F-18A were too immature for a decision to be made in 1980 as had been originally planned, and recommended to the Government that this be deferred by a year.|$|E
