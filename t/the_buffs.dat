5|$|The men's and women's tennis {{programs}} {{have also had}} many successful years. The {{programs have}} remained as two of the more competitive tennis teams in the WAC for several decades. The women's program experienced their most successful season in 1994 in which they finished state runner-up. The men's program won 10 consecutive WAC championships from 1994 to 2003. In 1999, former head coach Bob Krug was named NFCA Midwest Region Coach of the Year. The streak in WAC Championships ended during the 2003–04 school year, but <b>the</b> <b>Buffs</b> rebounded and won three more consecutive WAC championships from 2005 to 2007. <b>The</b> <b>Buffs</b> added WAC Championship titles in 2011 and 2014. The tennis program has sent numerous players to the state tournament throughout the program's history.|$|E
5|$|Once a {{candidate}} {{was selected as}} an officer, promotion could be rapid. A. S. Smeltzer was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in 1915, after serving in the Regular Army for 15 years. He rose in rank, and by the Spring of 1917 had been promoted to Lieutenant Colonel and was commanding officer of the 6th Battalion, <b>The</b> <b>Buffs</b> (Royal East Kent Regiment).|$|E
5|$|A and C Squadrons {{supported}} a costly, abortive 15 July attack on Ruweisat Ridge and the regiment retreated as the division dug {{in at the}} boxes. Two troops were dispatched to join the 18th Battalion on 22 July, encountering an Axis pocket and losing a troop commander. The regiment was incorporated into the New Zealand Divisional box; A and C Squadrons dug in, and B Squadron patrolled south. On 17 and 18 August, A and C Squadrons were relieved by <b>the</b> <b>Buffs</b> and Royal West Kents and moved out.|$|E

25|$|Until {{it closed}} in 2009 for {{refurbishment}} this {{was known as}} <b>the</b> <b>Buffs</b> Gallery, containing the archives of <b>the</b> <b>Buffs</b> (Royal East Kent Regiment). Around 1960 the collection was in the West Gate Towers Museum, then {{was moved to the}} Royal Museum in 1978. Prior to the refurbishment, the Beaney included a room on the regiment's history from the 16th century to 1961, when the regiment was amalgamated with the Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment.|$|E

25|$|Overall, 3,200 British (201 {{officers}} and 3,000 soldiers) and 5,350 Italians (351 {{officers and}} 5,000 soldiers) were taken prisoner by the Germans. The 4th Bn, <b>The</b> <b>Buffs,</b> in their isolated position, {{were unaware of}} the surrender so {{did not attempt to}} escape; consequently nearly the whole unit was captured. As with <b>the</b> <b>Buffs,</b> only ninety men from the West Kents managed to escape from the island. The few Italian ships that were still serviceable left for Turkey or British-controlled ports. Some Italian officers were executed after the surrender; among them Cdr. Vittorio Meneghini, the commanding officer of Euro.|$|E

25|$|After the war Cornwallis was an {{instructor}} at Sandhurst. He retired from the army in 1924, joining the Army Reserve.

25|$|The Churchill tanks {{descended the}} gully between Djebel Ahmera and Djebel Rhar and with <b>the</b> <b>Buffs</b> {{appeared}} on the north-west slopes; the tanks had remarkably traversed the steep southern slopes. With tanks and infantry working together, they were heavily engaged with mortars and small arms fire. The tanks then reached the defensive rim, eliminating the surprised German strong points one-by-one with BESA machine-gun and 6-pounder fire. A tank led by sergeant O'Hare {{was the first to}} reach the summit, breaching the headquarters and capturing fifty prisoners; three more tanks followed having finished their extraordinary drive, getting up inclines that were so steep that in places they had gradients of 1:3. The rest of the regiment arrived and headed up the slopes and with <b>the</b> <b>Buffs</b> eliminated more strong points and cut off escape routes, completing the capture of Longstop and by 11:00 am the battle was over.|$|E
25|$|On 16 April 1801 Perkins, {{in company}} with Colonel Richard Blunt and a {{detachment}} of <b>the</b> <b>Buffs</b> (Royal East Kent Regiment), laid siege to and captured the wealthy islands of Sint Eustatius and Saba, capturing their French garrisons, forty-seven cannon and 338 barrels of gunpowder.

25|$|Rommel {{considered}} Point 204 a key {{position and}} so great {{a part of}} the available neighbouring armoured and infantry units were committed to attack it on 15 December and in fierce and determined fighting, the attacking force, the Ariete and the 15th Panzer Division, with the 8th Bersaglieri Regiment and the 115th Lorried Infantry Regiment, overran <b>The</b> <b>Buffs</b> and its supporting elements during the afternoon. <b>The</b> <b>Buffs</b> lost over 1,000 men killed or captured with only 71 men and a battery of field artillery escaping. Fortunately for the rest of 5th Indian Brigade it was by then too late in the day for the attacking force to collect itself and advance further to intervene at Alem Hamza. The attackers too had suffered heavily in the engagement: the German commander was heard on a radio intercept to report the inability of his force to exploit his success because of losses sustained.|$|E
25|$|He died at Slindon, near Chichester, Sussex, on 9 July 1228. He {{was buried}} in some open ground beside the south {{transept}} of Canterbury Cathedral.

The collection includes pictures, trophies, mess silver, uniforms, weapons and medals including Victoria Crosses telling stories of campaigns from North Africa and Burma to France and Germany,. It also includes some material on East Kent's Volunteers and Militia.|$|E

25|$|The Royal West Kents and <b>the</b> <b>Buffs</b> were to {{lead the}} attack whilst the Argyles, who were to be held back in reserve at the start, were {{to pass through the}} Kents and seize Djebel el Rhar, the right hand higher end of Longstop. If successful, the Surreys with the North Irish Horse were to be {{prepared}} to exploit north-eastwards along the road to Tebourba. Defending the position was the 999th Light Afrika Division (Generalmajor Ernst-Günther Baade) which was composed of the 962nd Afrika-Schützen-Regiment and the III/754th Grenadier Regiment. They had adequately prepared the area for defence and were supported by anti-tank guns, mortars and dug in machine gun nests.|$|E
25|$|By October, the British {{forces on}} the island of Leros {{numbered}} ca. 3,000 men of the 2nd Bn The Royal Irish Fusiliers, (under Lt Col Maurice French), the 4th Bn <b>The</b> <b>Buffs</b> (The Royal East Kent Regiment) (Lt Col Douglas Iggulden), the 1st Bn The King's Own Royal Regiment (Lancaster), and a company of the 2nd Bn Queen's Own Royal West Kent Regiment, the whole force under Brigadier Robert Tilney, who assumed command on 5 November. Initially, the British had planned to secure the high ground of the island's interior, but Brig Tilney insisted on a forward defence on the coastline, which had the effect of spreading his forces too thinly.|$|E
25|$|The lead in {{this game}} changed several times, and several big plays kept the {{momentum}} swinging. With less than three minutes to go, Colorado took possession of the ball deep in its own territory trailing 31–27. Johnson led the team on a last-ditch drive. With about 40 seconds to go, he completed a pass to Colorado tight end Jon Boman who fell down just yards short of the goal line. Boman slipped due to the poor conditions of the field, which saw the Buffaloes slip on the turf repeatedly throughout the game. This play gave the Buffaloes a first down, but it led to immediate confusion because <b>the</b> <b>Buffs</b> were running a hurry-up offense.|$|E
