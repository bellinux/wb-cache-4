5|$|The two river navigations {{were built}} {{independently}} of one another, {{in order to}} meet local needs, but they eventually led to plans to connect them and form a <b>through</b> <b>route.</b>|$|E
5|$|Because of its {{importance}} {{as both a}} <b>through</b> <b>route</b> past the canal and in linking Highway 140 with Highway 406, East Main Street between Highways 140 and 406 is maintained the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO) as Highway 7146.|$|E
5|$|Because the A82 is a main <b>through</b> <b>route,</b> {{tourists}} are suggested {{to use the}} older Military Road instead, {{so as to avoid}} the coach and HGV traffic. Cyclists and walkers can use the Great Glen Way between Fort Wiilam and Inverness. This is part of National Cycle Route 78 (The Caledonia Way) from Campbeltown to Inverness.|$|E

5|$|Donald Cousens Parkway is {{intended}} to relieve north-south traffic congestion on York Regional Road68 (Main Street, former Highway48) and York Regional Road69 (Ninth Line), with signage suggesting drivers use the parkway as a <b>through</b> <b>route</b> past Markham. As trucks are prohibited along Main Street, signage guides them onto the parkway.|$|E
5|$|In 1903, {{a second}} railway station was opened in Giffnock, Whitecraigs railway station. The station {{lay on the}} Lanarkshire and Ayrshire Railway, {{originally}} built to provide a <b>through</b> <b>route</b> from the Lanarkshire coalfields to ports such as Ardrossan on the Ayrshire coast.|$|E
5|$|Some 700 metres below Pulteney weir, {{the river}} is joined by the Kennet and Avon Canal which connects through Bath Locks. Together with the Kennet Navigation which joins the River Thames at Reading, this {{provides}} a <b>through</b> <b>route</b> for canal boats from Bristol to London. From this point downstream {{the river is}} known as the Avon Navigation.|$|E

5|$|A future extension, {{scheduled}} to begin construction in April 2018, will carry Donald Cousens Parkway north, crossing over the Stouffville GO Train line on a new bridge and merging into the current southern terminus of Highway48. As a result of this, Highway48 and Donald Cousens Parkway (York Regional Road48) will become the <b>through</b> <b>route</b> while Main Street will meet them at an intersection demarcating the two.|$|E
5|$|CR26 has {{continued}} to deteriorate in the years since, with one , limited maintenance segment seeing the most wear. This section, situated midway between NY30 and NY3, has become both littered with potholes and extremely narrow due to {{the erosion of the}} highway's shoulders. In mid-2009, residents of Loon Lake petitioned the county to repair all of CR26 and to continuously maintain the highway, citing the road's regional importance as a <b>through</b> <b>route</b> for commuters traveling to and from the village of Malone.|$|E
5|$|The Glasgow, Paisley, Kilmarnock and Ayr Railway (GPK) was {{a railway}} in Scotland that {{provided}} train services between Glasgow, Kilmarnock and Ayr. It opened its first line, between Glasgow and Ayr, in stages from 1839 to 1840. The section between Glasgow and Paisley was made jointly with the Glasgow, Paisley and Greenock Railway. Later it built {{a line from}} Dalry via Kilmarnock to Cumnock, linking there with the Glasgow, Dumfries and Carlisle Railway, and together forming a <b>through</b> <b>route</b> from Glasgow to Carlisle. The two companies merged to form the Glasgow and South Western Railway.|$|E
50|$|The A49 runs north-south {{through the}} parish. Other <b>through</b> <b>routes</b> include an {{unclassified}} road running broadly east-west, crossing the A49 at , which connects with the settlements of Bickerton, Chorley and Wrenbury.|$|R
50|$|LA 25 {{also serves}} as a {{hurricane}} evacuation route for the North Shore of Lake Pontchartrain {{and is one of the}} few north-south <b>through</b> <b>routes</b> heading into Mississippi between Interstates 55 and 59.|$|R
5|$|By 1890, an {{alternate}} <b>route</b> <b>through</b> Glenwood Springs {{had been completed}} and the <b>route</b> <b>through</b> the Black Canyon, being more difficult to operate, lost importance for <b>through</b> trains. The <b>route</b> was finally abandoned in 1955.|$|R
5|$|The {{new line}} was planned as a <b>through</b> <b>route</b> {{and was not}} {{intended}} to have any stations of its own, but in 1904 it was decided to build two stations on it. A new station, also named Wotton, was built immediately to the south of the existing Wotton station. On 2 April 1906 the new route opened to passengers. The two Wotton stations were very close together, and the same stationmaster was responsible for both.|$|E
5|$|The second {{iteration}} of M-10 {{was designated}} in 1929 {{on a much}} shorter segment of the original M-10 through the Flint area, serving as a business connection for the city as the <b>through</b> <b>route,</b> US10, bypassed it on the east. It was later redesignated as Business US 10 (Bus. US10) in 1941, and then as Bus. M-54 in 1962 before being turned back to local control in 1974.|$|E
5|$|At {{its peak}} in 1912, the B {{operated}} 12 Boston-Albany round trips, one Boston-Pittsfield round trip, {{and as many as}} 10 Pittsfield-North Adams round trips. Around 1913 the New Haven planned to use the Housatonic as part of a New York-Montreal <b>through</b> <b>route</b> to compete with the NYC, but this never materialized and service levels were never high. After 1926 New Haven operated two daily New York-Pittsfield round trips with additional weekend service plus a Great Barrington-Pittsfield commuter trip operated by a rail bus. After 1935, nonstop New York-Pittsfield weekend trips were added for skiers during the winter.|$|E
50|$|The {{bus station}} {{is served by}} routes 13 and 460, and by <b>through</b> <b>routes</b> 221 and 125 to Edgware and Finchley Central, respectively. The 'Cricketers' pub used to stand {{adjacent}} to the old bus station.|$|R

5|$|Having been an {{important}} <b>through</b> <b>route</b> since Roman times, businesses were established along the road during the Middle Ages. Senior clergy lived in Fleet Street during this period where there are several churches including Temple Church and St Bride's. Fleet Street became known for printing and publishing {{at the start of}} the 16th century and it became the dominant trade so that by the 20th century most British national newspapers operated from here. Much of the industry moved out in the 1980s after News International set up cheaper manufacturing premises in Wapping, but some former newspaper buildings are listed and have been preserved. The term Fleet Street remains a metonym for the British national press, and pubs on the street once frequented by journalists remain popular.|$|E
5|$|Interstate 40, the city's major east–west {{thoroughfare}} {{was completed}} entirely through Amarillo in November 1968 across {{the center of}} the city. Previously, U.S. Highway 66 was the major east–west highway through the city, generally following Amarillo Blvd. {{to the north of the}} downtown area and then curving southwest to leave the city near the Veterans Hospital. A city route (which was an original alignment of US 66 through central and west Amarillo) followed Fillmore south into the downtown area and turned on West 6th through the San Jacinto Heights district which is now home to many antique shops, restaurants and other businesses, passing the Amarillo Country Club and veering onto West 9th Street and Bushland Blvd. before tying into the <b>through</b> <b>route</b> at a traffic circle near the Veterans Hospital.|$|E
5|$|Interstate 70 (I-70) is a transcontinental Interstate Highway in the United States, {{stretching}} from Cove Fort, Utah, to Baltimore, Maryland. In Colorado, the highway traverses an east–west route across {{the center of}} the state. In western Colorado, the highway connects the metropolitan areas of Grand Junction and Denver via a route through the Rocky Mountains. In eastern Colorado, the highway crosses the Great Plains, connecting Denver with metropolitan areas in Kansas and Missouri. Bicycles and other non-motorized vehicles, normally prohibited on Interstate Highways, are allowed on those stretches of I-70 in the Rockies where no other <b>through</b> <b>route</b> exists.|$|E
50|$|Ocean County has various {{major roads}} that pass <b>through.</b> State <b>routes</b> that go <b>through</b> include <b>Route</b> 13, Route 35, Route 37, Route 70, Route 72, Route 88, and Route 166. Other major <b>routes</b> that pass <b>through</b> are U.S. <b>Route</b> 9, the Garden State Parkway, and Interstate 195 (I-195 {{is the only}} Interstate to pass through Ocean County, solely in Jackson Township).|$|R
50|$|In 1896, fares {{were reduced}} from 3d to 2d for the <b>through</b> <b>routes,</b> and {{frequency}} doubled to 5 minute intervals from Stag Gates to Holy Rood. Four new trams and forty more horses {{were required to}} operate this service.|$|R
50|$|The {{sections}} of Highway 2 and Highway 3(the Talbot Trail) in Chatham-Kent were downloaded by the province in 1998, becoming local roads 2 and 3, but they remain significant <b>through</b> <b>routes</b> {{and are still}} locally known by their old names.|$|R
5|$|NY195 {{began at}} an {{intersection}} with NY11B in the hamlet of Nicholville within {{the town of}} Lawrence. It headed north out {{of the community and}} into a series of cultivated fields. About quarter of the way between Nicholville and Lavery's Corner, the fields gave way to forested areas, which themselves ceded to more fields near an intersection with Cady Road. NY195 continued on to Lavery's Corner, where it intersected with a pair of county highways and turned east toward Lawrenceville. On its way to Lawrenceville, the highway met Ferris Road, the last <b>through</b> <b>route</b> along NY195's routing excluding the roadway at its northern terminus. East of Ferris Road, NY195 curved northeast to enter Lawrenceville, where it ended at US11.|$|E
5|$|One major {{controversy}} {{related to}} the preliminary route of US 50. The <b>through</b> <b>route</b> {{had been assigned to}} the Old Santa Fe Trail, while the spur U.S. Route 250 followed the competing New Santa Fe Trail to the south. As a compromise, the Joint Board on Interstate Highways approved a split configuration—U.S. Route 50N and U.S. Route 50S—in January. Another problem was in western Utah, where no improved road existed for US 50 to use. The final numbering plan, approved in November 1926, left a gap in US 50 between Ely, Nevada and Thistle, Utah. Finally, rather than ending US 50 at Wadsworth, where the Lincoln and Victory Highways merged, it was sent over the Lincoln Highway's Pioneer Branch, past the south side of Lake Tahoe, to Sacramento, California.|$|E
5|$|The largest {{change has}} been the {{downgrading}} of the former <b>through</b> <b>route</b> of New England Street in favour of a new north–south road, Fleet Street, which diverges to the west. This has allowed {{a large part of}} New England Street to be narrowed, pedestrianised and provided with cycle lanes. In contrast, Cheapside is expected to take a much higher volume of traffic, as it becomes the main east-west route in the New England Quarter, taking traffic between London Road and Fleet Street, the main north–south road. Two new roads, Stroudley Road and Billinton Road, have been built {{to the west of the}} new Fleet Street, between there and the railway line. These give access to the car park, Bellerbys College and a new pick-up and drop-off point immediately outside the side entrance to the station. Two new pedestrianised squares—Ann Square and New England Square—have also been created within the core site.|$|E
50|$|In 1990, Weiner {{founded the}} company, Routes to Roots, which offered archival {{research}} services to individuals throughout the world. <b>Through</b> <b>Routes</b> to Roots, Weiner organized customized tours to ancestral towns {{for individuals and}} groups interested in Poland and the former Soviet Union, including Ukraine, Moldova, Belarus, Lithuania, and Poland. Weiner undertook these tours of ancestral towns {{at a time when}} there was little to no technology, and difficulties specific to Jewish genealogy included the lack of surnames until the late 1700s, the fluidity of surnames due to immigration and language, and the destruction of documents during The Holocaust. <b>Through</b> <b>Routes</b> to Roots, Weiner has conducted genealogical research in the archives of Poland and the former Soviet Union.|$|R

50|$|By the 1950s {{there were}} an {{extensive}} goods yard, a five-road engine shed (on {{the site of the}} steel mill), a turntable, three-road goods shed, two signal boxes, an extra footbridge and a subway connecting platforms. There were a total of nine separate <b>through</b> <b>routes</b> from one tunnel to the other.|$|R
