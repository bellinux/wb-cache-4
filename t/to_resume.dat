5|$|Each half of {{the pitch}} is then divided again by a line, {{referred}} to as the 23metre line or 25yard line, positioned 22.90m from each back line. Historically, this was first used <b>to</b> <b>resume</b> play after the ball passed over the back line and marked by flags {{at the side of the}} pitch. In 1949, deliberate defensive offenses in this area resulted in a penalty corner. From 1961, players on the defensive team who were not involved at the penalty corner stood behind this line (this was then moved to the half-way line two years later). The line was also used for the offside rule between 1987 until the rule was abolished in 1996. Nowadays, there are detailed rules regarding fouls and free-hits in the 23metre region of the pitch. Since 2015, the 23metre line has also been used for the attacking team <b>to</b> <b>resume</b> play when it has gone over the back line (this replaced long corners).|$|E
