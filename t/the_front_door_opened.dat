5|$|Kenwood {{has three}} floors: {{on the ground}} floor during the Lennon period <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>opened</b> onto an {{entrance}} hall, where Lennon placed a suit of armour and a gorilla suit. Across the hall was a large living room, which had black carpets, two 18-foot sofas and a marble fireplace. To the left of the hall was a toilet, and through the living room was a dining room, where purple, velvet wallpaper was put up. Adjacent to the dining room, {{at the back of the}} house, was a small sunroom. This was decorated with various pictures, caricatures and stickers, such as the one from the Safe as Milk debut album (1967) by Captain Beefheart & His Magic Band, and one advertising the Monterey Pop Festival. Photos published by The Beatles Book Monthly show the shelves of the sunroom filled with articles such as a large, ornate cross, a Mickey Mouse doll and a mortar and pestle, reportedly used by Lennon to mix various combinations of cocaine, amphetamine, barbiturates and LSD. There was also a yellow sofa or chaise-longue upon which Lennon would spend much of his time. It was a present from his aunt, Elizabeth Smith (n√©e Stanley) also known as Mimi. Behind the sunroom was the split-level kitchen where state-of-the-art appliances were installed, so complex that a tutor had to come and give the Lennons lessons in their use.|$|E
25|$|The {{main house}} was rebuilt by William Douglas, 3rd Duke of Hamilton in 1677 with a uniform facade {{and a pair}} of stone {{staircases}} at the ends. He sent his plans to help William Douglas, 1st Duke of Queensberry with his building works, which included Drumlanrig Castle in Dumfriesshire and Queensberry House in Edinburgh. An inventory of 1688 gives the names of rooms in the now gutted main house. <b>The</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>opened</b> into a Laich Hall, and a grand stair to the south led to the dining room above. The same arrangement can still be seen at the contemporary Argyll's Lodging, Stirling.|$|E
60|$|Hal {{heard no}} more. <b>The</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>opened,</b> and a {{stranger}} hurried in.|$|E
60|$|Annabel {{rose and}} {{followed}} her sister from the room. A maidservant held <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>open.</b> Anna sent her away.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing, your ladyship. One of {{the maid}} {{servants}} believes that she heard <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>open</b> {{at five o'clock}} this morning." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>opens,</b> {{revealing}} a bright light, {{and a bag}} on the floor. Lea walks to the door, picks up the bag, and leaves.|$|R
60|$|Then I {{told our}} names, {{and in an}} instant <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>opened.</b>|$|E
60|$|Just as she {{had gone}} up stairs, <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>opened</b> to admit Bobus.|$|E
60|$|Hal {{had made}} four {{copies of the}} letter when <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>opened,</b> and Caleb Allen entered.|$|E
60|$|Larry pushed <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>open,</b> grunting. He set his {{briefcase}} {{down and took}} off his hat. Then he saw Bob for the first time.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>opens</b> onto {{a hallway}} which has doors to rooms on either side, before opening through a timber archway {{into a large}} dining room.|$|R
60|$|He {{left the}} room. Jill heard <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>open.</b> She waited breathlessly. Pity for Uncle Chris {{struggled}} with the sterner feeling that it served him right.|$|R
60|$|As {{he spoke}} <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>opened,</b> and feet were {{heard in the}} passage {{stamping}} off the snow.|$|E
60|$|Tony {{entered a}} small sitting-room, into which <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>opened,</b> {{and took a}} seat by Cousin Maria.|$|E

60|$|She obeyed him mutely, {{pressing}} {{her hands to}} her eyes, shivering in every limb. French stood back inside the room. He heard <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>open,</b> he heard Quest's voice outside.|$|R
60|$|With {{a desperate}} bound she darted into the passage {{and through the}} hall, {{dragging}} him by the hand, and threw <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>open.</b> Without, <b>the</b> street was silent and empty.|$|R
6000|$|In {{another moment}} Adye {{was leading the}} way downstairs. They found <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>open</b> and <b>the</b> policemen {{standing}} outside staring at empty air. [...] "He's got away, sir," [...] said one.|$|R
60|$|And <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>opened,</b> and Freddie {{came out}} on to the veranda, {{for all the world}} {{as if he had been}} taking a cue.|$|E
60|$|It {{was just}} eleven o'clock, and they 'ad shut {{up for the}} night, when <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>opened,</b> and George stood there smiling at 'em and shaking his 'ead.|$|E
60|$|Tommy took to {{his heels}} and ran--none too soon. <b>The</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>opened</b> and {{a hail of}} bullets {{followed}} him. Fortunately none of them hit him. He turned {{the corner of the}} square.|$|E
60|$|Morel {{knew she}} was coming. He had <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>open.</b> Everybody was on tiptoe. Half the street turned out. They {{heard the sound of}} the great motor-car. Mrs. Morel, smiling, drove home down the street.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{you will}} do it," [...] said Fred. [...] "I wonder what you and Henrietta cannot do between you! Oh, there is Uncle Geoffrey come in," [...] he exclaimed, as he heard <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>open.</b>|$|R
60|$|I call at {{the office}} of the Dublin {{organization}} in Westmoreland Street, and find <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>open,</b> and <b>the</b> office <b>door</b> <b>open,</b> and though the office is empty the cupboard <b>door</b> <b>open</b> and eighteen pounds in gold upon the shelf.|$|R
6000|$|Just as {{they reached}} the porch <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>opened</b> and a little girl stood before them. She {{appeared}} to be {{about the same age as}} Dorothy, and smiling upon her visitors she said, sweetly: ...|$|E
60|$|The {{sound of}} <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>opened</b> below, {{a rush of}} cold wind, and her father's voice {{speaking}} to Mrs. Bretton in the hall, startled her at last. She sprang up: she was down-stairs in one second.|$|E
60|$|She {{fell back}} behind her husband. <b>The</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>opened</b> slowly, {{to show the}} hound, his nose white with milk, in charge of an ancient of days clad in a blue linen ephod curiously {{gathered}} on breast and shoulders.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>opens</b> into a 15 ft. A notable {{decorative}} features is the French scenic wallpaper in {{the parlor}} and hallway, installed to commemorate the wedding of the Quarles' daughter, Sarah Anna Eliza Quarles to William Z. Thomson in 1817.|$|R
6000|$|... "Let's go {{into the}} orchard and wait," [...] said the Story Girl. [...] "It's one o'clock now, so in another hour we'll know the worst. We'll leave <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>open,</b> and we'll hear the big clock when it strikes two." ...|$|R
50|$|Typical of {{pyramidal}} {{and short}} ridge houses with a <b>front</b> verandah <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>opens</b> onto a passageway that separates <b>the</b> two <b>front</b> bedrooms and leads into the sitting room. The kitchen {{and dining room}} are {{at the back of}} the house.|$|R
60|$|He {{was already}} half-way across--three steps more would have {{anchored}} {{him in the}} harbour of the back parlour--when <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>opened,</b> and there stood Matthew. Better far had it been the Old Gentleman, in full equipage of horns, hoofs, and tail.|$|E
60|$|It was {{now about}} the right time {{in the morning to}} get up, and very soon <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>opened</b> and out came Aunt Ann, with a bucket on her arm, which she was going to fill at the well for the purpose of giving little Bridget her morning wash.|$|E
60|$|Arthur without {{question}} obeyed Jim's orders: went to <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door,</b> <b>opened</b> it, {{and ran off}} {{at the top of}} his speed. The prisoners now began to recover from the first panic, and to guess the true state of the case. Angry oaths were uttered, and they began to talk to each other in rapid tones.|$|E
6000|$|... "Good night," [...] said Father Brown, as {{the doctor}} walked briskly to the gate. He had left <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>open,</b> so that a shaft of gaslight fell upon them. In the light of this Brown opened the {{envelope}} and read the following words: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You must, indeed, {{have been}} different. Mamma, I heard <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>open.</b> If {{it is my}} uncle coming in, just ask him to step upstairs, and let me hear his {{assurance}} that I am truly awake and collected, and not dreaming or delirious." ...|$|R
