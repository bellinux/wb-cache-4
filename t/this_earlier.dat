5|$|The BBRC {{conducted}} a detailed review into the controversial {{identification of a}} curlew seen at Druridge Bay in Northumberland in 1998, coming {{to the conclusion that}} it was, as had been believed by many observers, a first-summer slender-billed curlew. This identification was accepted by the British Ornithologists Union's Records Committee, leading to the addition of this species to the British List. The record is currently being reviewed again by BBRC to establish whether <b>this</b> <b>earlier</b> decision should be upheld.|$|E
5|$|DNA {{analysis}} from 16S rRNA sequences has supported a hypothesis, originally suggested by Cleveland and colleagues in 1934, that these insects are most {{closely related to}} wood-eating cockroaches (genus Cryptocercus, the woodroach). <b>This</b> <b>earlier</b> conclusion had been based on the similarity of the symbiotic gut flagellates in the wood-eating cockroaches to those in certain species of termites regarded as living fossils. In the 1960s additional evidence supporting that hypothesis emerged when F.A. McKittrick noted similar morphological characteristics between some termites and Cryptocercus nymphs. These similarities have led some authors to propose that termites be reclassified as a single family, the Termitidae, within the order Blattodea, which contains cockroaches. Other researchers advocate the more conservative measure of retaining the termites as the Termitoidae, an epifamily within the cockroach order, which preserves the classification of termites at family level and below.|$|E
5|$|Platform A6 {{encloses}} {{the western}} extreme of the Group A plaza. The platform has two levels, the upper {{of which has}} a vertical cornice. The platform faces east onto the plaza; access was via two stairways flanked by balustrades terminating in vertical cornices. Platform A6 was built over an older {{version of the same}} building; <b>this</b> <b>earlier</b> construction phase was smaller and its stairways were destroyed in order to build the stairways of the final version. During restoration work carried out by archaeologists the back wall and a section of the facade were left exposed. Four funerary urns were found associated with the platform, mostly interred under the front of the building.|$|E
