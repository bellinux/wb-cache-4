50|$|The CIWS is {{designed}} to be the last line of defense against anti-ship missiles. Due to its design criteria, its effective range is very short relative to the range of modern ASMs, from 1 to 5 nmi km. The gun mount moves at a very high speed and with great precision. The system takes minimal inputs from the ship, making it capable of functioning despite potential damage to the ship. The only inputs required for operation are 440 V AC three-phase electric power at 60 Hz and water (for electronics cooling). For full operation, including some non-essential functions, it also has inputs for <b>true</b> <b>compass</b> ship's <b>heading</b> and 115 V AC for the PASS subsystem.|$|R

40|$|A {{fiber optic}} system for {{measuring}} magnetic heading and pitch {{of one or}} more <b>compass</b> <b>heads</b> in a towed acoustic array has been developed as a cooperative effort between engineers at Fiber Dynamics, Inc., and faculty and graduate students at Texas A&M. An unconventional photolithographic process for producing a bar-code pattern on a curved (spherical) surface was successfully implemented. First, an absorption process for applying a thin layer of photoresist uniformly to the gold-coated surface of a glass sphere was perfected. Then, a system for defining the patterns in the metal was assembled. A LabView computer program controlled the system as required to define the bar code pattern in the metal. High-quality bar code patterns were produced on floating spheres by this method. The data acquisition/signal processing system digitized and processed the raw data returning from the <b>compass</b> <b>heads,</b> and computed magnetic heading and pitch from the data. Processing of the signal from a single <b>compass</b> <b>head</b> required readout of a 7 -bit binary code giving coarse heading, using timing information to obtain fine heading, and measuring the apparent width of an analog bar to determine pitch. When monitoring multiple <b>compass</b> <b>heads</b> distributed along the fiber, a time-division demultiplexing technique was used for separating the data from the individual <b>compass</b> <b>heads.</b> For testing the system, the cylindrical sensor head was mounted on a machinist's table for rotating it through 360 ?? in the horizontal plane to vary the heading, and through ?? 10 ?? about a horizontal axis to vary pitch. Measured resolutions of the system were 0. 044 ?? for heading, and 0. 85 ?? for pitch...|$|R

50|$|When {{tracking}} {{to or from}} an NDB, it is also usual {{that the}} aircraft track on a specific bearing. To do this {{it is necessary to}} correlate the RBI reading with the <b>compass</b> <b>heading.</b> Having determined the drift, the aircraft must be flown so that the <b>compass</b> <b>heading</b> is the required bearing adjusted for drift {{at the same time as}} the RBI reading is 0 or 180 adjusted for drift. An NDB may also be used to locate a position along the aircraft's current track (such as a radial path from a second NDB or a VOR). When the needle reaches an RBI reading corresponding to the required bearing then the aircraft is at the position. However, using a separate RBI and compass, this requires considerable mental calculation to determine the appropriate relative bearing.|$|R

5000|$|Sailing ships {{generally}} had {{two kinds}} of compasses: steering compasses, two {{of which would be}} mounted in a binnacle in front of the helm for use in maintaining a course; and a bearing compass that was used for taking the bearings of celestial objects, landmarks and the ship's wake. The latter could be moved around the ship, and it was soon observed that the bearing could vary from one part of the ship to another. The explorer Joao de Castro was the first to report such an inconsistency, in 1538, and attributed it to the ship's gun. Many other objects were found to be sources of deviation in ships, including iron particles in brass compass bowls; iron nails in a wooden compass box or binnacle; and metal parts of clothing. The two steering compasses themselves could interfere with each other if they were set too close together. The [...] "bearing compass" [...] was eventually sited in a fixed position in a binicale with, as far as possible, an all round view and acquired the name [...] "standard compass" [...] It would nonetheless have a different deviation to the [...] "steering compass" [...] so the <b>compass</b> <b>heading</b> shown on the [...] "steering compass" [...] would be different to the <b>compass</b> <b>heading</b> shown on the [...] "standard compass".|$|R
