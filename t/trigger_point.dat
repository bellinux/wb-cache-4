50|$|Activation of <b>trigger</b> <b>points</b> may {{be caused}} by a number of factors, {{including}} acute or chronic muscle overload, activation by other <b>trigger</b> <b>points</b> (key/satellite, primary/secondary), disease, psychological distress (via systemic inflammation), homeostatic imbalances, direct trauma to the region, collision trauma (such as a car crash which stresses many muscles and causes instant <b>trigger</b> <b>points)</b> radiculopathy, infections and health issues such as smoking.|$|R

25|$|Prostatitis is {{inflammation}} of the prostate gland. There are primarily four different forms of prostatitis, each with different causes and outcomes. Two relatively uncommon forms, acute prostatitis and chronic bacterial prostatitis, are treated with antibiotics (category I and II, respectively). Chronic non-bacterial prostatitis or male chronic pelvic pain syndrome (category III), which comprises about 95% of prostatitis diagnoses, is treated by a large variety of modalities including alpha blockers, physical therapy, psychotherapy, antihistamines, anxiolytics, nerve modulators, phytotherapy, , surgery, and more. More recently, a combination of <b>trigger</b> <b>point</b> and psychological therapy has proved effective for category III prostatitis as well. Category IV prostatitis, relatively uncommon in the general population, {{is a type of}} leukocytosis.|$|E
25|$|There are few {{disorders}} on {{the differential}} diagnosis for carpal tunnel syndrome. Cervical radiculopathy can be mistaken for carpal tunnel syndrome since it can also cause abnormal or painful sensations in the hands and wrist. In contrast to carpal tunnel syndrome, the symptoms of cervical radiculopathy usually begins in the neck and travels down the affected arm and may be worsened by neck movement. Electromyography and imaging of the cervical spine can help to differentiate cervical radiculopathy from carpal tunnel syndrome if the diagnosis is unclear. Carpal tunnel syndrome is sometimes applied as a label to anyone with pain, numbness, swelling, and/or burning in the radial side of the hands and/or wrists. When pain is the primary symptom, carpal tunnel syndrome {{is unlikely to be}} the source of the symptoms. As a whole, the medical community is not currently embracing or accepting <b>trigger</b> <b>point</b> theories due to lack of scientific evidence supporting their effectiveness.|$|E
50|$|Sometimes {{confused}} with pressure point massage, this involves deactivating <b>trigger</b> <b>points</b> that may cause local pain or refer pain and other sensations, such as headaches, {{in other parts}} of the body. Manual pressure, vibration, injection, or other treatment is applied to these points to relieve myofascial pain. <b>Trigger</b> <b>points</b> were first discovered and mapped by Janet G. Travell (President Kennedy's physician) and David Simons. <b>Trigger</b> <b>points</b> have been photomicrographed and measured electrically and in 2007 a paper was presented showing images of <b>Trigger</b> <b>Points</b> using MRI. These points relate to dysfunction in the myoneural junction, also called neuromuscular junction (NMJ), in muscle, and therefore this technique is different from reflexology, acupressure and pressure point massage.|$|R
40|$|The main aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the phenomenology and pathophysiology of <b>trigger</b> <b>points.</b> I start by a description of how the concept is defined in relation to scientific research and clinical use. Through electronic search in databases such as PubMed, Cochrane and UpToDate I have extracted relevant research papers on this topic. I have also looked into existing, authorative literature in this field. In addition to this, I have interviewed a clinician who works in this area on a daily bases to get an understanding of how <b>trigger</b> <b>points</b> are diagnosed in the clinic. The outcome of this study reveals that, while there is good empirical evidence that <b>trigger</b> <b>points</b> exist, there is limited consensus with respect to diagnostic criteria. Neither is there a common understanding of the etiology and pathophysiology of <b>trigger</b> <b>points.</b> Several theories exist, but none seems to meet the criteria of a well-founded scientific understanding. Still, the etiology of pain in <b>trigger</b> <b>points</b> is not known, but it seems likely that central sensitization plays a key role. Further research is needed to test the validity and reliability of the criteria for diagnosing <b>trigger</b> <b>points</b> as they are used today, in order to achieve a common platform for clinical use. Further investigation into the pathophysiological mechanism is also needed in order to reach a thorough understanding, which is a prerequisite for effective treatment...|$|R
50|$|A {{successful}} {{treatment protocol}} relies on identifying <b>trigger</b> <b>points,</b> resolving them and, if all <b>trigger</b> <b>points</b> have been deactivated, elongating the structures affected along their natural {{range of motion}} and length. In the case of muscles, which is where most treatment occurs, this involves stretching the muscle using combinations of passive, active, active isolated (AIS), muscle energy techniques (MET), and proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) stretching to be effective. Fascia surrounding muscles should also be treated to elongate and resolve strain patterns, otherwise muscles will simply be returned to positions where <b>trigger</b> <b>points</b> are likely to re-develop.|$|R
50|$|Characteristic {{features}} of a myofascial trigger points include: focal point tenderness, reproduction of pain upon <b>trigger</b> <b>point</b> palpation, hardening of the muscle upon <b>trigger</b> <b>point</b> palpation, pseudo-weakness of the involved muscle, referred pain, and limited range of motion following approximately 5 seconds of sustained <b>trigger</b> <b>point</b> pressure.|$|E
5000|$|Palpation of the <b>trigger</b> <b>point</b> reproduces the patient's {{complaint}} of pain, {{and the pain}} radiates in a distribution typical of the specific muscle harboring the <b>trigger</b> <b>point.</b>|$|E
50|$|Ischemic {{compression}} {{is commonly}} applied to trigger points, {{in what is}} known as <b>trigger</b> <b>point</b> therapy, where enough sustained pressure is applied to a <b>trigger</b> <b>point</b> with a tolerable amount of pain, and as discomfort is reduced, additional pressure is gradually given.|$|E
50|$|The {{misdiagnosis}} of pain is {{the most}} important issue taken up by Travell and Simons. Referred pain from <b>trigger</b> <b>points</b> mimics the symptoms of a very long list of common maladies, but physicians, in weighing all the possible causes for a given condition, rarely consider a myofascial source. The study of <b>trigger</b> <b>points</b> has not historically been part of medical education. Travell and Simons hold that most of the common everyday pain is caused by myofascial <b>trigger</b> <b>points</b> and that ignorance of that basic concept could inevitably lead to false diagnoses and the ultimate failure to deal effectively with pain.|$|R
5000|$|Myofascial <b>trigger</b> <b>points,</b> {{also known}} as <b>trigger</b> <b>points,</b> are {{described}} as hyperirritable spots in the fascia surrounding skeletal muscle. They are associated with palpable nodules in taut bands of muscle fibers. They are a topic of ongoing controversy, as there is limited data to inform a scientific understanding of the phenomenon. Accordingly, a formal acceptance of myofascial [...] "knots" [...] as an identifiable source of pain is more common among bodyworkers, physical therapists, chiropractors, and osteopathic practitioners. Nonetheless, the concept of <b>trigger</b> <b>points</b> provides a framework which {{may be used to}} help address certain musculoskeletal pain.|$|R
40|$|The {{entry and}} exit decisions, {{considered}} as investment decisions, are investigated in the paper. Taking {{into account the}} heterogeneity of entry and exit, the analysis is based on two types of entry-exit: real (related to the establishment or closing of a firm), or entry-exit in a new sector (indicating the diversification or changing specialisation). The theoretical model is based on Marshallian <b>trigger</b> <b>points</b> with Real Option <b>trigger</b> <b>points</b> as an alternative. The estimation exploited the negative binomial model to investigate the role of <b>trigger</b> <b>points</b> (thresholds) on the observed number of entry or exit firms in Dutch glasshouse horticulture over 25 years. Firms should overcome different thresholds depending on types of entry and exit. Marshallian <b>trigger</b> <b>points</b> function {{as good as the}} ones based on Real Option theory. The estimation of the model, which takes into account expected output prices, uncertainty and the interest rate, however, provides the best explanation of entry and exit. That model can be considered of a flexible variant of Real Option theory. The model provides plausible elasticities of entry and exit, either real or in changing specialisation. entry and exit, <b>trigger</b> <b>points,</b> glasshouse horticulture, Crop Production/Industries, Industrial Organization,...|$|R

40|$|This study aims to {{investigate}} the crashworthiness behavior of hollow Al-based functionally graded material (FGM) box. In order to introduce the concept of FGM, several holes are known as <b>trigger</b> <b>points</b> were drilled on a thin-walled Al column. The column was divided into four segments and each segment has a different number of <b>trigger</b> <b>points.</b> The difference number of <b>trigger</b> <b>points</b> on each segment produces the different structural strength. Quasi-static loading test was conducted in order to observe the deformation pattern occurred. The corresponding graph of force versus distance then was analyzed to obtain the value of energy absorption for each sample. Five samples of different segment arrangement were tested, namely, S 1 a, S 1 b, S 2, S 3 and S 4. From the results obtained, the sample S 1 b give the best results with the highest value of energy absorption.

40|$|M. Tech. (Chiropractic) Abstract: PURPOSE: Myofascial pain {{syndrome}} {{is a common}} cause of discomfort and disability worldwide with various forms of literature to substantiate it. Myofascial pain {{syndrome is}} a condition that is characterised {{by the presence of}} myofascial <b>trigger</b> <b>points.</b> These <b>trigger</b> <b>points</b> often refer pain to different areas of the body. Active gluteus medius <b>trigger</b> <b>points</b> for instance may refer pain to lower back and has frequently been misdiagnosed as non-specific lower back pain. Numerous treatment protocols have been applied by specialists and therapist to reduce the pain created by these <b>trigger</b> <b>points</b> and results show indifferent evidence and efficacy. Radial shockwave therapy is an alternative modality that is used to treat a variety of different musculoskeletal conditions. It is a non-invasive treatment and ideal for musculoskeletal conditions that have failed to respond to other conservative treatment protocols. The {{purpose of the study was}} to identify the effectiveness of radial shockwave therapy in combination with spinal manipulation on active gluteus <b>trigger</b> <b>points</b> and non-specific lower back pain. DESIGN: A total of forty participants were utilised for the research study and were randomly divided into two groups of twenty participants each. Group 1 received radial shockwave therapy on gluteus medius <b>trigger</b> <b>points</b> and spinal manipulative therapy on L 4 -S 1 levels. Group 2 received detuned ultrasound on gluteus medius <b>trigger</b> <b>points</b> and spinal manipulative therapy on L 4 -S 1 levels. A total of six treatment sessions were required over a three-week period MEASUREMENTS: Subjective data was collected by using a Visual Analogue Scale. Objective data was collected by using a hand-held pressure algometer on active gluteus medius <b>trigger</b> <b>points.</b> Data was collected on the first, fourth and seventh consultations. OUTCOMES: With regards to the subjective data readings, the results from the Visual Analogue scale from the intragroup analysis indicated that both groups improved over the treatment period, the radial shockwave group showed the greatest improvement (64, 35 %). The radial shockwave group and the detuned ultrasound groups yielded p-values of 0. 00 and 0. 00 respectively. The intergroup analysis showed a statistical significant difference [...] ...|$|R
