5|$|Flanders felt that, {{to quell}} inflation, wage {{increases}} should {{be tied to}} productivity increases, rather than <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>living.</b> He recommended splitting gains in productivity three ways: to the worker for higher wages, to the company for higher profits and to the consumer for lower prices.

Such an approach would require mutual respect and understanding between labor and management.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{proposed}} that the U.S. dollar should have fractional coins using decimals, rather than eighths like the Spanish coinage. This innovation was originally suggested by Superintendent of Finance Robert Morris, with whom Hamilton corresponded after examining one of Morris's Nova Constellatio coins in 1783. He also desired the minting of small value coins, such as silver ten-cent and copper cent and half-cent pieces, for reducing <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>living</b> for the poor. One of his main objectives was {{for the general public}} to become accustomed to handling money on a frequent basis.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1927 {{economic}} indicators were signalling {{the onset of}} a recession in Australia. By 1929, the evidence was unavoidable that recession was becoming depression as a resulting of rapidly deteriorating international conditions. In that year, prices for Australian exports fell by nearly a third and GDP had fallen by 10%, with no attendant fall in <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>living.</b> Australia's debt now stood at £631 million the interest payments on which were equivalent to nearly half of Australia's export receipts, a situation difficult to sustain even in a positive economic climate. Investors and banks recognised the risk and Australia's credit access was rapidly drying up. Bruce's grand economic development plans had increased the national debt significantly yet had delivered only marginal economic expansion in the short term.|$|E

5|$|Cheney's {{political}} career began in 1969, {{as an intern}} for Congressman William A. Steiger during the Richard Nixon Administration. He then joined the staff of Donald Rumsfeld, who was then Director of the Office of Economic Opportunity from 1969–70. He held several positions {{in the years that}} followed: White House Staff Assistant in 1971, Assistant Director of <b>the</b> <b>Cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>Living</b> Council from 1971–73, and Deputy Assistant to the president from 1974–1975. As deputy assistant, Cheney suggested several options in a memo to Rumsfeld, including use of the US Justice Department, that the Ford administration could use to limit damage from an article, published by The New York Times, in which investigative reporter Seymour Hersh reported that Navy submarines had tapped into Soviet undersea communications as part of a highly classified program, Operation Ivy Bells.|$|E
5|$|Despite this {{increase}} in the domestic manufacturing industry {{there was still a}} significant shortfall in many items. In part this was due to the priority that military consumption and production necessarily had over civilian, however, there was also a considerable scarcity of raw materials and other components required for manufacturing. This was due both to the lack of shipping available from the United Kingdom, as well as the limitations placed upon the flow of such goods from Britain due to their own increased requirements. The result of this was inflationary. Domestic prices went up, while the cost of exports was deliberately kept lower than market value in an effort to prevent further inflationary pressures worldwide. As a result, <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>living</b> for many average Australians was increased considerably.|$|E
5|$|During the 12th century major landowners {{tended to}} rent out their demesne lands for money, {{motivated}} by static prices for produce and {{the chaos of}} the Anarchy between 1135 and 1153. This practice began to alter in the 1180s and 1190s, spurred by the greater political stability. In the first years of John's reign, agricultural prices almost doubled, at once increasing the potential profits on the demesne estates and also increasing <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>living</b> for the landowners themselves. Landowners now attempted wherever possible to bring their demesne lands back into direct management, creating a system of administrators and officials to run their new system of estates.|$|E

In the years following World War I, inflation dramatically eroded {{the value of a}} police officer's salary. From 1913 to May 1919, <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>living</b> rose by 76%, while police wages rose just 18%.

Boston city laborers were earning a third more on an hourly basis.|$|E
5|$|In August 1934, Hitler {{appointed}} Reichsbank President Hjalmar Schacht as Minister of Economics, and in {{the following}} year, as Plenipotentiary for War Economy in charge of preparing the economy for war.

Unemployment fell from six million in 1932 to one million in 1936. Hitler oversaw {{one of the largest}} infrastructure improvement campaigns in German history, leading to the construction of dams, autobahns, railroads, and other civil works. Wages were slightly lower in the mid to late 1930s compared with wages during the Weimar Republic, while <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>living</b> increased by 25 percent.

The thirteen churches were located in Dakar, Saint-Louis, Gorée, Rufisque, Thiès, Ngazobil, Joal, Fadiouth, Foundiougne, Kaolack, Ziguinchor, Bignona and Banjul. In 1922, the Governor decreed which buildings were authorized to practise Catholicism. While the Carabane church was one of the buildings selected, some members blamed the colonial administration for having facilitated the expansion of Islam in the country.|$|E

40|$|The most {{frequently}} occurring type of dementia is Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's {{disease is a}} degenerative illness affecting the brain, decreasing the patient's memory and judgement. A cure is not available {{but it is possible}} to delay the cognitive decline with medication. New drugs like Aricept and Metrifonate appear to have no or minor side effects and {{have a positive effect on}} the cognitive functions and behavior of the patient. At this moment the iMTA is studying the cost-effectiveness of Metrifonate. This thesis is part of that study and focuses on <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> Alzheimer's disease. <b>The</b> main question formulated in this thesis was: How do <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> institutionalization compare with <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>living</b> at home for patients with Alzheimer's disease in The Netherlands and France? For The Netherlands earlier studies on the use of health care services by demented patients were used to estimate <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> for demented patients living at home. These <b>costs</b> depend on <b>the</b> amount of formal and informal health care services that demented patients use. The valuation of informal care also determines <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> <b>costs</b> for patients <b>living</b> at home. <b>The</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>living</b> at home were compared with <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> institutionalization. <b>The</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> demented patients <b>living</b> at home are lower than <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> institutionalization when informal care is not valued. When <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> informal care are included in <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> for patients living at home, these <b>costs</b> exceed <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> institutionalization for mildly demented patients as well as for severely demented patients by seven or more hours of informal care per day. A mildly demented patient probably does not need this amount of informal care per day. A severely demented patient could need seven hours of informal care per day. In that case <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> institutionalization are lower than <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>living</b> at home. In France admission of a mildly demented patient is cheaper when the patient needs more than two hours of informal care per day. As the severity of dementia increases, <b>the</b> increase in <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> institutionalization is not equal to <b>the</b> increase in <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>living</b> at home. Therefore the thresholds at which <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>living</b> at home exceed <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> for institutionalization for a mildly demented patient does not equal the threshold for a severely demented patient. In comparison with <b>The</b> Netherlands, <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> for demented patients living at home in France are lower than in the Netherlands. This is caused by the increased use of informal care and the decreased use of professional health care services in France compared with <b>the</b> Netherlands. <b>The</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> institutionalization are also higher in the Netherlands than in France. <b>The</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French institutions are lower than <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> institutions in <b>the</b> Netherlands because the emphasis is more on the function <b>of</b> <b>living</b> than on the function of caring. When informal care is valued with the same tariff used in the Netherlands, admission of a severely demented patient needing more than seven hours of informal care per day is cheaper than living at home. This last mentioned threshold is comparable with the Netherlands...|$|R
