In 1818, Christian Gmelin {{was the first to}} observe that lithium salts give a bright red color to flame. However, both Arfwedson and Gmelin tried and failed <b>to</b> <b>isolate</b> <b>the</b> pure element from its salts. It was not isolated until 1821, when William Thomas Brande obtained it by electrolysis of lithium oxide, a process that had previously been employed by the chemist Sir Humphry Davy <b>to</b> <b>isolate</b> <b>the</b> alkali metals potassium and sodium. Brande also described some pure salts of lithium, such as the chloride, and, estimating that lithia (lithium oxide) contained about 55% metal, estimated the atomic weight of lithium to be around 9.8 g/mol (modern value ~6.94 g/mol). In 1855, larger quantities of lithium were produced through the electrolysis of lithium chloride by Robert Bunsen and Augustus Matthiessen. The discovery of this procedure led to commercial production of lithium in 1923 by the German company Metallgesellschaft AG, which performed an electrolysis of a liquid mixture of lithium chloride and potassium chloride.|$|E

5|$|In 1811, iodine was {{discovered}} by French chemist Bernard Courtois, who was born to a manufacturer of saltpeter (an essential component of gunpowder).
