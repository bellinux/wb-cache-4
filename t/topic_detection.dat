In this paper, we propose a simple and effective <b>topic</b> <b>detection</b> model called the temporal Discriminative Probabilistic Model (DPM), which is shown to be theoretically equivalent to the classic vector space model with feature selection and temporally discriminative weights. We compare DPM to its various probabilistic cousins ranging from mixture models like von-Mises Fisher (vMF) to mixed membership models like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Benchmark results on the TDT 3 dataset show that sophisticated models such as vMF and LDA do not necessarily lead to better results; {{in the case of}} LDA, notably worse performance was obtained under variational inference, which is likely due to the significantly larger number of LDA model parameters involved for document-level <b>topic</b> <b>detection.</b> On the contrary, using a relatively simple time-aware probabilistic model such as DPM suffices for both offline and online <b>topic</b> <b>detection</b> tasks, making DPM a theoretically elegant and effective model for practical <b>topic</b> <b>detection...</b>|$|E

However detecting trendy topics is very challenging due to huge number of users and short-text posts in microblog diffusion networks. In this paper we introduce a trendy <b>topics</b> <b>detection</b> system under computation and communication resource constraints. In stark contrast to retrieving and processing the whole microblog contents, we develop an idea of selecting a small set of microblog users and processing their posts to achieve an overall acceptable trendy topic coverage, without exceeding resource budget for detection. We formulate the selection operation of these subset users as mixed-integer optimization problems, and develop heuristic algorithms to compute their approximate solutions. The proposed system is evaluated with real-time test data retrieved from Sina Weibo, the dominant microblog service provider in China. It's shown that by monitoring 500 out of 1. 6 million microblog users and tracking their microposts (about 15, 000 daily) with our system, nearly 65 % trendy topics can be detected, while on average 5 hours earlier before they appear in Sina Weibo official trends...|$|R
