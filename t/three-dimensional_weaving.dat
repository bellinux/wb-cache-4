The cost of ballistic fiber goes up dramatically as yarn size goes down, so it is unclear how long this trend can continue. The current practical limit of fiber size is 200 denier with most wovens limited at the 400 denier level. <b>Three-dimensional</b> <b>weaving</b> with fibers connecting flat wovens together into a 3D system are being considered for both hard and soft ballistics. Team Engineering Inc is designing and weaving these multi layer materials. Dyneema DSM has developed higher performance laminates using a new, higher strength fiber designated SB61, and HB51. DSM feels this advanced material provides some improved performance, however the SB61 “soft ballistic” version has been recalled. [...] At the Shot Show in 2008, a unique composite of interlocking steel plates and soft UHWMPE plate was exhibited by TurtleSkin. In combination with more traditional woven fabrics and laminates a number of research efforts are working with ballistic felts. Tex Tech has been working on these materials. Like the 3D weaving, Tex Tech sees the advantage in the 3-axis fiber orientation.|$|E

40|$|Smart {{textiles}} {{are understood}} as textiles, where new functions are integrated {{to form a}} textile system that can react and interact with the environment. These new textile systems place completely new demands on the actors in the development process. With smart textiles at hand, the textile sector is almost facing a paradigm shift, which requires new manufacturing techniques; new ways of working and new roles need to be developed. New collaborations across disciplinary boundaries need to be created in order to generate new innovative products. Research state {{that it is of}} paramount importance that users are involved as early as possible in the development process of innovative products, the argument being that they possess knowledge regarding the product and its everyday use, which is lacking among designers. However, such user involvement may be limited to users acting as informants or as evaluators, but the involvement can also develop into the user becoming a member of the multidisciplinary team, a co-designer representing his/her own discipline. This is argued to facilitate the recognition of user needs and taking of them into consideration in the development process. However, such teams also face a number of challenges. One of the challenges is that the team members often lack a common language and use of terms, as they need to establish cross disciplinary communication in order to successfully specify a common goal. Furthermore, it is necessary to convert knowledge from one area of expertise into information, which is comprehensible to someone with other experiences and skills, as this makes the knowledge valuable to a individual, who has a different background or views the problem from a different perspective. The case presented in this study concerns a project where a multidisciplinary team was gathered to explore the possibility of using <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>weaving</b> techniques combined with smart textile technology to solve a clinical problem in long-term monitoring of brain activity (EEG). In the project, textile product representations were developed iteratively in collaboration with the user of the future product. The case studied aimed to understand how product representations can facilitate the dialogue in multidisciplinary teams in order {{to bridge the gap between}} users and designer. The analysis of the data reveals the importance of the product representations mediating the discussions and the sharing of knowledge but also that the product representations played different roles in the process. Five different roles were identified, the roles have further been categorized into two main groups: explanatory and concrete roles and more proactive roles. The explanatory roles are defiend such as; -’verbaliser' serving as a facilitator to fill in where words as missing or terms are not understood, - ’demonstrator’ helping to concretize questions and answers between the user and the designer. The more proactive roles were defined as; - ‘visualisers’, which denotes situations when representations support individuals to recall or evoke mental images, - ’stimulators’ that support the generation of new ideas or design solutions and the progression of new ideas and new shared knowledge in the project, and - ‘integrators’ that support the integration of perspectives between different disciplines and unites different perspectives in the team. The conclusion of this study is that the representation supports and facilitates the collaboration and communication across disciplines, bridging gaps and generating new shared knowledge...|$|E

40|$|Composites with <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>woven</b> {{architectures}} exhibit large strains {{to failure}} {{when compared to}} composites {{made up of the}} same materials but not with three-dimensional interlocking tows. The fracture mechanics of such three-dimensional architectures is a subject requiring substantial investigation and experimental testing. Classical fracture mechanics concepts (for instance, an isolated defect in a homogeneous body) will not be applicable to the woven fracture test specimen. The use of an isolated singularity to characterize an entire specimen is inadequate when the density of defects is considerable and the material is heterogeneous. Modelling of such a complex system requires a great deal of insight and consideration as well as prudent choices of model sizes to make numerical schemes feasible. The purpose of this manuscript is to review our recently acquired knowledge of damage accumulation in woven composites and to describe a practicable model of the macroscopic behavior in these and other complex composite architectures based on such knowledge. In this manuscript, discussion will be limited to uniaxial compressive loading; considerations of general loading (monotonic and cyclic) will appear in a subsequent manuscript. Our modelling efforts may be briefly described as follows: the composite is subdivided into microstructural elements (microelements) in which the micromechanical modelling is either understood rigorously or can be represented adequately by statistical parameters. There can be microstructural elements for many different types of composite components, such as the various types of warp and weft and matrix for <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>woven</b> composites. The physical dimensions of microelements are made as large as possible while the response within the element can still be represented by a single micromechatlical calculation. The various elements are linked together(sometimes by associating distinct corners and edges, sometimes by superposition) in a pattern which resembles a particular weave architecture. The model can then be loaded in any manner and the linear and nonlinear elastic responses of representative weaves can be calculated. After the elastic regime, the fracture response is determined by monitoring the damage accumulation...|$|R

50|$|FRP {{allows the}} {{alignment}} of the glass fibres of thermoplastics to suit specific design programs. Specifying the orientation of reinforcing fibres can increase the strength and resistance to deformation of the polymer. Glass reinforced polymers are strongest and most resistive to deforming forces when the polymers fibres are parallel to the force being exerted, and are weakest when the fibres are perpendicular. Thus this ability is at once both an advantage or a limitation {{depending on the context}} of use. Weak spots of perpendicular fibres can be used for natural hinges and connections, but can also lead to material failure when production processes fail to properly orient the fibres parallel to expected forces. When forces are exerted perpendicular to the orientation of fibres the strength and elasticity of the polymer is less than the matrix alone. In cast resin components made of glass reinforced polymers such as UP and EP, the orientation of fibres can be oriented in two-dimensional and <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>weaves.</b> This means that when forces are possibly perpendicular to one orientation, they are parallel to another orientation; this eliminates the potential for weak spots in the polymer.|$|R

40|$|Understanding {{the failure}} {{behaviour}} of <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>weaved</b> composites {{is necessary to}} allow the design of weave forms appropriate for application, or to predict the failure mode a component will undergo. The different effects at different length-scales call for multi-scale simulation. In this work, a finite-element model is proposed using the asymptotic homogenisation method to distribute macro-scale stresses to the micro-scale, i. e. yarns and matrix, in a repeating unit cell (RUC) model. The stresses in the yarns and matrix are then used in a continuum damage model to determine localised stiffness degradation, and the cell properties are homogenised to determine the macro-scale effect. The model is demonstrated by simulating a through-the-thickness reinforced orthogonally weaved composite, undergoing tensile, compressive and shear loading. The stress-strain response and failure are reproduced and shown to match experimental results. The model reveals the locations of damage initiation, and the progress of damage through the RUC. It is observed that the binder yarns create localised stress concentrations from which the failure process is initiated. It is concluded {{that the use of}} such a model can be critical to designing a 3 D weave with optimal behaviour...|$|R
40|$|Stromal {{stem cells}} from human dental pulp (SBP-DPSCs) were used to study osteogenic {{differentiation}} in vitro and in vivo. We previously reported that SBP-DPSCs are multipotent stem cells able to differentiate into osteoblasts, which synthesize <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>woven</b> bone tissue chips in vitro. In this study, we followed the temporal expression pattern of specific markers in SBP-DPSCs and found that, when differentiating into osteoblasts, they express, besides osteocalcin, also flk- 1 (VEGF-R 2). In addition, 30 % of them expressed specific antigens for endothelial cells, including CD 54, von-Willebrand (domain 1 and 2), CD 31 (PECAM- 1) and angiotensin-converting enzyme. Interestingly, we found endotheliocytes forming vessel walls, observing that stem cells synergically differentiate into osteoblasts and endotheliocytes, and that flk- 1 exerts {{a pivotal role in}} coupling osteoblast and endotheliocyte differentiation. When either SBP-DPSCs or bone chips obtained in vitro were transplanted into immunocompromised rats, they generated a tissue structure with an integral blood supply similar to that of human adult bone; in fact, a large number of HLA- 1 (+) vessels were observed either within the bone or surrounding it in a periosteal layer. This study provides direct evidence to suggest that osteogenesis and angiogenesis mediated by human SBP-DPSCs may be regulated by distinct mechanisms, leading to the organization of adult bone tissue after stem cell transplantion. status: publishe...|$|R
