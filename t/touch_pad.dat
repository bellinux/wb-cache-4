5|$|Donecle uses a {{swarm of}} drones {{equipped}} with laser sensors and micro-cameras. The algorithms for automatic detection of defects, trained on existing images database with a machine learning software, are able to identify various elements: texture irregularities, pitot probes, rivets, openings, text, defects, corrosion, oil stains. A damage report is sent on the operator's <b>touch</b> <b>pad</b> with each area of interest and the proposed classification with a probability percentage. After reviewing the images, the verdict is pronounced by a qualified inspector.|$|E
25|$|When {{moving through}} areas, the player mostly modifies the {{landscape}} so that new paths can be opened. For example, {{in order to}} reach an isolated area, the player might have to bring down a platform by casting a gust of wind, climb onto the platform, and then return the platform to its original position and jump off. The player is also given tools to help with puzzles. One such tool acts as a reef blower or vacuum cleaner, moving items out of the way or defeating enemies. Some tools or objects must first be created on the controller's <b>touch</b> <b>pad.</b> Here, the player can draw the shape of an object and choose the colours. When finished, the item is then used in the game world wherever it is necessary. One instance of this occurs when the player is asked to create a butterfly design. The butterfly design the player creates can then be seen numerous times throughout each level {{for the rest of the}} game.|$|E
500|$|RedOctane {{developed}} a new guitar controller for World Tour. [...] The unit is approximately 25% larger than previous controllers, making it closer {{to the size of}} a real guitar. [...] The new controller includes a longer whammy bar and places the Star Power button directly below the strum bar, improving the access of these features. [...] The strum bar itself was made quieter and longer. [...] The neck of the guitar is detachable, similar to the Gibson Les Paul controller for Guitar Hero III, but the connector has been hardened to avoid connection issues experienced with the previous unit. [...] The neck of the guitar features a touch-sensitive pad just toward the body end from the normal five fret buttons. [...] The player can use either the fret buttons or the <b>touch</b> <b>pad</b> to play regular notes. [...] The pad also allows the player to play notes via tapping or via [...] "tap strumming" [...] similar to the slap bass method for bass guitar, and to alter the pitch of sustained notes. [...] Guitar tracks feature notes connected by a semi-transparent purple line, (except for the Wii and PlayStation 2 version, in which semi-transparent gems replace this purple line) called [...] "Slider Gems"; the player can play these notes by sliding their fingers up and down the <b>touch</b> <b>pad</b> or by tapping the fret buttons without strumming. [...] The touchpad can also be used for sustained and staccato notes in the music studio feature while recording guitar, and is used for finer control over loops when recording other instruments.|$|E
50|$|A StackMat timer is a timer {{designed}} for use in sport stacking and speedcubing. StackMat timers have two <b>touch</b> <b>pads,</b> {{one on each side}} of the display. The hands are placed on the two <b>touch</b> <b>pads.</b> After 0.55 seconds, a green light will light up, and when one or both of the hands are released from the <b>touch</b> <b>pads,</b> the timer starts. When both hands are placed back on the <b>touch</b> <b>pads,</b> the timer stops and displays a time with accuracy to 0.001 seconds.|$|R

500|$|Korogashi Puzzle Katamari Damacy was {{released}} for the Nintendo DSi via DSiWare in 2009. Similar in play to Tetris, the player used the prince {{to drop a}} katamari into the playing field to clear the puzzle field. Touch My Katamari (...) is a regional launch title for the PlayStation Vita portable game system in late 2011 and early 2012. [...] The No-Vita moniker is a play on the Vita console name and the Japanese word nobita, meaning [...] "to lengthen or extend". While the core mechanics are similar to other games in the series, Touch My Katamari allows the player to use the rear <b>touch</b> <b>pad</b> on the Vita to temporarily stretch the katamari into an ovoid shape, allowing it to roll through narrow spaces or collect small objects.|$|E
2500|$|Some touchpads have [...] "hotspots", {{locations}} on the touchpad used for functionality beyond a mouse. For example, on certain touchpads, moving the finger along {{an edge of}} the <b>touch</b> <b>pad</b> will act as a scroll wheel, controlling the scrollbar and scrolling the window that has the focus vertically or horizontally. Many touchpads use two-finger dragging for scrolling. Also, some touchpad drivers support tap zones, regions where a tap will execute a function, for example, pausing a media player or launching an application. All of these functions are implemented in the touchpad device driver software, and can be disabled.|$|E
2500|$|In Visser's modification, the Acetone box was {{extended}} {{with a large}} flat board holding 12 printed circuit boards of approximately 4×4 inches, with the copper traces intertwining like forks. The copper traces formed the touch surfaces for the sounds generated by the Acetone box. Each <b>touch</b> <b>pad</b> was sensed by an electronic circuit driving high-speed Siemens computer relays he found in surplus shops. These were connected to the drum and percussion sounds of the rhythm box. [...] Although it was a crude way of playing electronic drum sounds by hand (like a percussionist playing bongos and congas), it worked and added a [...] "human feel". Visser's approach enabled drummers to have new type of virtuosity (e.g., rolls on electronic bass drums could be played with sticks). The unit was used in Frans Peters' studio in radio city Hilversum, Netherlands.|$|E

2500|$|Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty - HD Edition was {{released}} for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in [...] {{and for the}} PlayStation Vita in [...] This version {{is included in the}} Metal Gear Solid HD Collection, but is also available as a digital download on the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade. [...] The PS3 and Xbox 360 versions feature an increased 720p resolution and a [...] aspect ratio, providing a clearer and wider view of the player's surroundings compared to the original 480p resolution and [...] ratio of the PS2 version, while the PS Vita version runs at qHD resolution. Cutscenes can now be viewed in full-screen or letterboxed format, while online achievements/trophies have been added as well. Most of the additional content from Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance have also been ported in this version, such as the Missions and Snake Tales modes, although the Skateboarding minigame that was present in the PS2 version of Substance is absent. The PS3 and Vita versions have a [...] "transfarring" [...] option that allows players to transfer save data between both versions through a wi-fi connection or a cloud network. The Vita version has touch screen and <b>touch</b> <b>pad</b> support for certain gameplay functions such as switching between items and weapons or zooming into cutscenes.|$|E
