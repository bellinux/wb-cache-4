40|$|This paper {{discusses}} Sidel’s {{criticism of}} certain Kerschensteiner’s views about work-school and work-education. Sidel disputed that Kerschensteiner was {{the creator of}} the idea about work-school, emphasizing that, significantly before Kerschensteiner, he put forth this idea in his papers, in which he proved the pedagogical value of work and the need for work-school. Sidel objects to Kerschensteiner <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> convincingly elaborate the need for introducing work-school, that, when explaining the need for handcraft, he underestimated the significance of books for education and culture in general, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> specify the term "giftedness", <b>that</b> is, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> indicate <b>that</b> besides spiritual, there are other kinds of giftedness and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> understand correctly the relation between work and obviousness. Sidel also thinks that Kerschensteiner <b>did</b> <b>not</b> understand the relation between the society, state and education, i. e. <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> demonstrate <b>that</b> school reform is conditioned by social reasons, that work-school is a social an political need, that work education is the need and interest of modern society and state. Also, he objects to Kerschensteiner <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> understand nor emphasize the significance and value of handcraft for artistic education, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> speak about the role of work in the development of inventive spirit of the young, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> sufficiently emphasize <b>that</b> significance of handcraft for the development of will, moral and character, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> speak in which way work-school can be realized, i. e. <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> see the mutual relationship between social development and school and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> demand any social changes for the purpose of accomplishing that goal. Sidel concludes that Kerschensteiner’s work-school, introduced in the conditions of monarchist organization of schools in Germany, cannot be a role model which should be followed...|$|R

5|$|Matheos and Moore did {{not plan}} to make a second OSI album, and {{returned}} to their own projects after the first album's completion.

5|$|A {{central part}} of the show's premise was that the main {{character}} would be handicapped. The initial idea was for House to use a wheelchair, but Fox turned down this interpretation (for which the crew was later grateful). The wheelchair idea turned into a scar on House's face, which later turned into a bad leg necessitating use of a cane. The original script called for House to be 34 years old; however, Shore later explained <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> the character to be that young.|$|E

Speight made his Michigan debut on September 12, 2015, taking kneel-down snaps in the closing minutes of a victory over Oregon State. Asked why he played Speight instead of Morris {{at the end of}} the Oregon State game, head coach Jim Harbaugh explained <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to burn Morris's redshirt year on a meaningless snap, emphasizing that Morris remained his No. 2 quarterback.|$|E
5|$|As he {{had when}} he {{directed}} The Wrath of Khan, Meyer attempted to modify the look of Star Trek to fit his vision. Cinematographer Hiro Narita's previous work had been on effects films such as The Rocketeer, where he had {{time and money to}} make a lavish period fantasy; with The Undiscovered Country, he was constantly under time and budgetary pressures. Though Narita confessed that he knew nothing about Star Trek, Meyer replied <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> him to have any preconceived notions about the look of the series.|$|E

5|$|Benicio del Toro as Fred Fenster. Spacey {{suggested}} del Toro for the role. The {{character was}} originally written with a Harry Dean Stanton-type actor in mind. Del Toro met with Singer and the film's casting director {{and told them}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to audition {{because he did not}} feel comfortable doing them. After reading the script, del Toro realized that his character's only purpose was to be killed to demonstrate Söze's power, and did not have any meaningful impact on the story. As a result, del Toro developed Fenster's unique, garbled speech pattern to make him more memorable as a character.|$|E

Al Kooper did uncredited production work to help Dylan finish the album. For his next recording session, Dylan asked Leon Russell, who made his name with Joe Cocker, to assist in finding a new sound.
