5|$|Australia was {{a member}} of the {{international}} coalition which contributed military forces to the 1991 Gulf War, deploying a naval task group of two warships, a support ship and a clearance diving team; in total about 750 personnel. The Australian contribution was the first time Australian personnel were deployed to an active war zone since the establishment of the ADF and the deployment tested its capabilities and command structure. However, the Australian force did not see combat, and instead playing a significant role in enforcing the sanctions put in place against Iraq following the invasion of Kuwait. Some ADF personnel serving on exchange with British and American units did see combat, and a few were later decorated for their actions. Following the war, the Navy regularly deployed a frigate to the Persian Gulf or Red Sea to enforce the <b>trade</b> <b>sanctions</b> which continued to be applied to Iraq. A number of Australian airmen and ground crew posted to or on exchange with US and British air forces subsequently participated in enforcing no-fly zones imposed over Iraq between 1991 and 2003.|$|E

25|$|These {{scholars}} suggest, {{from their}} studies {{of economic and}} social data, that early 20th-century child labour in Europe and the United States ended in large part {{as a result of the}} economic development of the formal regulated economy, technology development and general prosperity. Child labour laws and ILO conventions came later. Edmonds suggests, even in contemporary times, the incidence of child labour in Vietnam has rapidly reduced following economic reforms and GDP growth. These scholars suggest economic engagement, emphasis on opening quality schools rather than more laws and expanding economically relevant skill development opportunities in the third world. International legal actions, such as <b>trade</b> <b>sanctions</b> increase child labour.|$|E
25|$|Public {{international}} law concerns relationships between sovereign nations. The sources for public {{international law}} development are custom, practice and treaties between sovereign nations, such as the Geneva Conventions. Public international law can be formed by international organisations, such as the United Nations (which was established after {{the failure of the}} League of Nations to prevent World War II), the International Labour Organisation, the World Trade Organisation, or the International Monetary Fund. Public international law has a special status as law because there is no international police force, and courts (e.g. the International Court of Justice as the primary UN judicial organ) lack the capacity to penalise disobedience. However, a few bodies, such as the WTO, have effective systems of binding arbitration and dispute resolution backed up by <b>trade</b> <b>sanctions.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} {{to pressure from}} some American farmers and agribusiness, the embargo was relaxed by the <b>Trade</b> <b>Sanctions</b> Reform and Export Enhancement Act, which {{was passed by the}} Congress in October 2000 and signed by President Bill Clinton. The relaxation allowed the sale of agricultural goods and medicine to Cuba for humanitarian reasons. Although Cuba initially declined to engage in such trade (having even refused U.S. food aid in the past, seeing it as a half-measure serving U.S. interests), the Cuban government began to allow the purchase of food from the U.S. as a result of Hurricane Michelle in November 2001. These purchases have grown since then, even though all sales are made in cash. In 2007, the U.S. was the largest food supplier of Cuba, which nevertheless is largely self-sufficient, and its fifth largest trading partner.|$|E
5000|$|It {{appears that}} from the {{beginning}} the desired track had been laid; when Board of <b>Trade</b> <b>sanction</b> to open it was refused, the Somerset and Dorset company nonetheless charged the B&ER for the agreed rental charge.

25|$|As {{explicitly}} asserted by both treaties of the European Union, the Faroe Islands are {{not part}} of the European Union. The Faroes are not grouped with the EU when it comes to international trade; for instance, when the EU and Russia imposed reciprocal <b>trade</b> <b>sanctions</b> on each other over the War in Donbass in 2014, the Faroes began exporting significant amounts of fresh salmon to Russia. Moreover, a protocol to the treaty of accession of Denmark to the European Communities stipulates that Danish nationals residing in the Faroe Islands are not considered Danish nationals within the meaning of the treaties. Hence, Danish people living in the Faroes are not citizens of the European Union (though other EU nationals living there remain EU citizens). The Faroes are not covered by the Schengen Agreement, but there are no border checks when travelling between the Faroes and any Schengen country (the Faroes have been part of the Nordic Passport Union since 1966, and since 2001 there have been no permanent border checks between the Nordic countries and the rest of the Schengen Area as part of the Schengen agreement).|$|E
25|$|The three {{deaths were}} the only Americans killed {{as a result of}} attacks on American ships by German {{submarine}} until 16 March 1917, when diplomatic relations had irreparably broken down just before the declaration of war. American official reaction to the incident was determined by President Woodrow Wilson under the advice of United States Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan and Counselor to the State Department Robert Lansing. Bryan favoured reconciliation with Germany and avoidance of war, but this policy was becoming increasingly unpopular and was opposed by his subordinate Lansing. Lansing submitted a memorandum proposing immediate and vigorous protest and coupled with the Cushing incident and the sinking of RMS Lusitania on 7 May, a British ship but carrying American passengers who drowned, president Wilson made a forceful response to Germany. In June Bryan resigned and was replaced by Lansing. Despite his belligerent formal advice, Lansing's private papers suggest that he considered the rights and wrongs of the situation much more finely balanced and the logical outcome ought to have been impartial military <b>trade</b> <b>sanctions</b> against both belligerents. However, the US economy was already heavily committed to producing military supplies for the British, while American support for {{one side or the other}} was likely to prove decisive in choosing the eventual victor.|$|E
500|$|On 11 December 1979, the Rhodesian House of Assembly voted 90 to nil {{to revert}} to British colonial status (the 'aye' votes {{included}} Ian Smith himself). The bill then passed the Senate and was assented to by the President. With the arrival of Lord Soames, the new Governor, just after 2 p.m. on 12 December 1979, Britain formally took control of Zimbabwe Rhodesia as the Colony of Southern Rhodesia, although on 13 December Soames declared that during his mandate the name Rhodesia and Zimbabwe Rhodesia {{would continue to be}} used. Britain lifted sanctions on 12 December, and the United Nations on 16 December, before calling on its member states to do likewise on 21 December. Thus Zambia, Mozambique, Tanzania, Angola and Botswana lifted sanctions on 22–23 December; Australia partly pre-empted this, [...] lifting all but <b>trade</b> <b>sanctions</b> on 18 December, and <b>trade</b> <b>sanctions</b> on 21 December.|$|E

40|$|Countries {{often use}} {{economic}} sanctions to coerce {{other countries to}} change certain policies of which they do not approve. However, if sanctioned countries smuggle goods over the border, use informal financial intermediaries, and develop black markets to <b>trade</b> <b>sanctioned</b> goods, sanctions end up having a smaller impact, sanctioned countries {{have little incentive to}} modify their policies, and sanctions are more likely to fail. This paper is the first study to test empirically whether sanctions affect informality. I compile data from different studies {{about the size of the}} informal market for 147 countries over 46 years. I use these data to analyze the relationship between the size of the informal market adjusted by the size of the population and economic sanctions. I also estimate at the impact of economic sanctions on other activities associated with informal activities. I find that informal markets increase when a country is being sanctioned and the effects are larger when the economic sanction has strong international support. I also find that the type of <b>sanction,</b> <b>trade</b> or financial, is not an important determinant of the informal market size and that sanctions also lead to increases in robbery rates and corruption...|$|R

500|$|A working {{document}} was ultimately produced {{and signed by}} Smith, Wilson and Gibbs, to be accepted or rejected in its entirety by each Cabinet after the Prime Ministers returned home. Whitehall accepted the proposals, but Salisbury turned them down; Smith announced on 5 December 1966 that while he and his ministers were largely satisfied with the terms, the Cabinet did not feel it could responsibly abandon the 1965 constitution while so much uncertainty surrounded the transition and the new [...] "mythical constitution yet to be evolved". Gondo, Rhodesia's Leader of the Opposition, promptly demanded Smith's resignation, reasoning that the Cabinet's rejection of the {{working document}} he had helped to draft amounted to a vote of no confidence. The RF ignored him. Warning that [...] "grave actions must follow", Wilson took the Rhodesia problem to the United Nations, which proceeded to institute the first mandatory <b>trade</b> <b>sanctions</b> in its history with Security Council Resolutions 232 (December 1966) and 253 (April 1968). These measures required UN member states to prevent all trade and economic links with Rhodesia.|$|E
500|$|Black nationalists in Rhodesia {{and their}} {{overseas}} supporters, prominently the OAU, clamoured for Britain to remove Smith's government {{with a military}} invasion, but Britain dismissed this option because of various logistical issues, the risk of provoking a pre-emptive Rhodesian strike on Zambia, and the psychological problems that were likely to accompany any confrontation between British and Rhodesian troops in what Smith said would be a [...] "fratricidal war". Wilson instead resolved to end the Rhodesian rebellion through economic sanctions; these principally comprised the expulsion of Rhodesia from the Sterling area, {{a ban on the}} import of Rhodesian sugar, tobacco, chrome and other goods, and an oil boycott of Rhodesia. When the Rhodesians continued to receive oil, Wilson attempted to directly cut off their main supply lines, namely the Portuguese Mozambican ports at Beira and Lourenço Marques, by posting a Royal Navy squadron to the Mozambique Channel in March 1966. This blockade, the Beira Patrol, was endorsed the following month by UN Security Council Resolution 221. The United Nations proceeded to institute the first mandatory <b>trade</b> <b>sanctions</b> in its history with Security Council Resolutions 232 (December 1966) and 253 (April 1968), which required member states to cease all trade and economic links with Rhodesia.|$|E

40|$|On April 30, 1993, the United States Trade Representative (USTR) placed Taiwan on the 2 ̆ 2 {{priority}} {{watch list}} 2 ̆ 2 {{of countries that}} failed to protect United States intellectual property rights. 2 ̆ 7 Although countries on the priority watch list are not as egregious in violating United States intellectual property rights as those identified as 2 ̆ 2 priority foreign countries, 2 ̆ 2 Taiwan was targeted for an immediate action plan, requiring it to take specific actions before July 31, 1993, or else risk being {{the subject of a}} <b>trade</b> <b>sanction.</b> Under the intense pressure from the United States, the ruling party of Taiwan rammed through the legislature the first law governing the island 2 ̆ 7 s booming cable-television industry on July 16, 1993. The authority of the USTR to target trading partners of the United States for their unsatisfactory protection of United States intellectual property rights comes from the Special 301 provision of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988. The Special 301 provision is designed to use the threat of unilateral retaliation by the United States to pressure its trade partners to reform their currently deficient intellectual property practices. The idea is the carrot and the stick, where the carrot is the right to export to the United States as a most favored nation, and the stick is the <b>trade</b> <b>sanction.</b> This paper will trace and analyze the interaction between the United States and Taiwan in the process of resolving disputes on intellectual property protection, and will discuss the implications of Taiwan 2 ̆ 7 s experience, which can be useful for understanding conflicts over intellectual property protection in other countries...|$|R
