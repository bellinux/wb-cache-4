5|$|A fluffernutter {{is made by}} {{spreading}} peanut butter on a slice of bread, then spreading {{an equal amount of}} marshmallow fluff on another slice and finally combining them to form a sandwich. Variations of the recipe include wheat bread instead of white, Nutella hazelnut spread instead of or in addition to peanut butter, and the addition of sweet ingredients like bananas or savory and salty ingredients like bacon. The Fluffernutter itself is often seen as a variation on <b>the</b> <b>peanut</b> <b>butter</b> and jelly sandwich. Though often seen as a food for children, the Fluffernutter recipe has been adapted to appeal to adult tastes. For example, a New York caterer serves a Fluffernutter hors d'oeuvre in a toasted ice cream cone with a spoon of peanut butter and torched marshmallow fluff on top.|$|E

Nick and Dale reluctantly wait outside Bobby's and Harken's houses, respectively, to commit the murders, despite neither of them wanting to. Harken discovers Bobby's cellphone in his bedroom and uses it to find his address, suspecting his wife Rhonda (Julie Bowen) is having an affair. He drives over and kills Bobby, with Nick as a secret witness.|$|E

25|$|The 29 car {{returned}} in 2005 at Bristol Motor Speedway {{as part of}} a promotion for Reese's Chocolate and Peanut Butter Lovers Cups. The promotion involved the 29 painted as the Chocolate Lovers car and the 21 painted as <b>the</b> <b>Peanut</b> <b>Butter</b> Lovers car. The plan was for Jeff Burton to drive the 29 while Kevin Harvick would drive the 21. Qualifying was rained out, so the entries were switched to assure that both cars would make the field (Harvick was a past champion and the No. 29 was not locked in). Burton drove the 21 while Harvick drove the 29. Harvick won the race in this car with Burton finishing second in the 21. Later in the season, Mayflower Transit came on to sponsor Burton after a seven-year relationship with him.|$|E

2500|$|After {{blanching}} the peanuts {{are sent}} to grinding to be manufactured into peanut butter. [...] The peanuts are then sent through two sizes of grinders. The first grinder produces a medium grind, and the second produces a fine grind. At this point, salt, and a vegetable oil stabilizer {{are added to the}} fine grind to produce <b>the</b> <b>peanut</b> <b>butter.</b> [...] This adds flavour and allows <b>the</b> <b>peanut</b> <b>butter</b> to stay as a homogenous mixture. [...] Chopped peanuts may also be added at this stage to produce “chunky” peanut butter.|$|E
2500|$|Peanut {{butter is}} {{served as a}} spread on bread, toast or crackers, and used to make {{sandwiches}} (notably <b>the</b> <b>peanut</b> <b>butter</b> and jelly sandwich).

2500|$|Peanut butter's flavor {{combines}} {{well with}} other flavors, such as oatmeal, cheese, cured meats, savory sauces, and {{various types of}} breads and crackers.

The taste can also be enhanced by similarly salty things like bacon (see peanut butter, banana and bacon sandwich), especially if <b>the</b> <b>peanut</b> <b>butter</b> has added sweetness.|$|E

2500|$|In 1970, {{their second}} album, Fun House, was released, {{featuring}} {{the addition of}} saxophonist Steve Mackay. On June 13 of that year, television recorded the band at the Cincinnati Pop Festival. While performing the songs [...] "T.V. Eye" [...] and [...] "1970", Pop leapt into the crowd, where he was hoisted up on people's hands, and proceeded to smear peanut butter all over his chest. In a broadcast interview at WNUR Northwestern University radio station in Evanston, Illinois in 1984, Stiv Bators of the Lords of the New Church and the Dead Boys confirmed the long-standing rumor that {{it was he who}} had provided <b>the</b> <b>peanut</b> <b>butter,</b> having carried a large tub from his home in Youngstown, OH and handing it up to Iggy from the audience.|$|E
2500|$|The album {{title is}} a catchphrase used by Ghoulardi, the 1960s horror host alter-ego of Cleveland {{television}} presenter Ernie Anderson. Carney called the title [...] "a shout-out to Ohio", {{the state in}} which he and Auerbach grew up. The title also captured the despondent tone of the record. Auerbach said, [...] "We liked the association with Ghoulardi, this kind of weird freak from Ohio from the early 60s – that was a phrase he used to use. And then {{so much of the}} album was lyrically melancholy and introspective and personal, so it was very blue. I guess it just made sense." [...] Carney explained the original context in which Ghoulardi used the phrase: [...] "It's [...] way of telling people to fuck off." [...] The cover art, which features an image of a blue and magenta spiral, was designed by Michael Carney, the group's art director and Patrick's brother. After selecting the title, Patrick said the group began [...] "referencing early '60s sci-fi, shows like The Outer Limits and Twilight Zone" [...] for the art direction, due to Ghoulardi's association with the genre. The album's artwork was influenced by Carney's interest in mind control; the subject drew his attention after he feuded on Twitter with fans of pop star Justin Bieber. Director Harmony Korine subsequently recommended Carney watch the 1985 film <b>The</b> <b>Peanut</b> <b>Butter</b> Solution, in which a teacher uses mind control on students to make them build paintbrushes. The film inspired the hypnotism wheel on the cover and in the album's promotional videos.|$|E
