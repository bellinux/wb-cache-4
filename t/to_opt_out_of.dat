5|$|In National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius {{decided on}} June 28, 2012, the Supreme Court {{ruled that the}} {{individual}} mandate was constitutional when the associated penalties were construed as a tax. The decision allowed states <b>to</b> <b>opt</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the Medicaid expansion. Several did so, although some later accepted the expansion.|$|E
5|$|This {{estimate}} was made {{prior to the}} Supreme Court's ruling that enabled states <b>to</b> <b>opt</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the Medicaid expansion, thereby forgoing the related federal funding. The CBO and JCT subsequently updated the budget projection, estimating {{the impact of the}} ruling would reduce the cost estimate of the insurance coverage provisions by $84 billion.|$|E
5|$|Health: Brown said {{he wanted}} doctors' {{surgeries}} to open at weekends, and GPs to be on-call in the evenings. Doctors {{had been given the}} right <b>to</b> <b>opt</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> out-of-hours care two years before under a controversial pay deal signed by then-Health Secretary John Reid, that awarded them a 22 percent pay rise in 2006. Lord Ara Darzi was appointed to review NHS service delivery, especially in London. Proposed policies included the induction of polyclinics, which would be open to tender and possibly run by private companies.|$|E

5|$|Throughout {{the summer}} of 2008, Obama {{typically}} led McCain in national polls by single-digit margins, and also led in several key swing states. McCain reprised his familiar underdog role, which was due {{at least in part}} to the overall challenges Republicans faced in the election year. McCain accepted public financing for the general election campaign, and the restrictions that go with it, while criticizing his Democratic opponent for becoming the first major party candidate <b>to</b> <b>opt</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> such financing for the general election since the system was implemented in 1976. The Republican's broad campaign theme focused on his experience and ability to lead, compared to Obama's.|$|E
5|$|Yelp began {{a service}} called Yelp Deals in April 2011, but by August it {{cut back on}} Deals due to {{increased}} competition and market saturation. That September, the Federal Trade Commission investigated Yelp's allegations that Google was using Yelp web content without authorization and that Google's search engine algorithms favored Google Places over similar services provided by Yelp. In a January 2014 agreement, Google was not subject to anti-trust litigation from the FTC, but did have to allow services like Yelp the ability <b>to</b> <b>opt</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> having their data scraped and used on Google's websites.|$|E
5|$|A recent {{development}} {{is the use of}} the RDS system of car radios. The ambulance is fitted with a short range FM transmitter, set to RDS code 31, which interrupts the radio of all cars within range, {{in the manner of a}} traffic broadcast, but in such a way that the user of the receiving radio is unable <b>to</b> <b>opt</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the message (as with traffic broadcasts). This feature is built into every RDS radio for use in national emergency broadcast systems, but short range units on emergency vehicles can prove an effective means of alerting traffic to their presence. It is, however, unlikely that this system could replace audible warnings, as it is unable to alert pedestrians, those not using a compatible radio or even have it turned off.|$|E

5|$|In June 2007, Jones {{was traded}} to the Portland Trail Blazers along with the draft rights to Rudy Fernandez, the 24th pick in the 2007 NBA draft, in {{exchange}} for cash considerations. In late January 2008, Jones was leading the NBA in three-point percentage with a percentage slightly over 50%. He missed 12 games from February 4 to February 27 with a knee injury. He had also missed 12 games in November 2007 due to knee problems, spending five games on the inactive list and seven as a DNP-CD. Jones finished the 2007–08 season third in the league in three-point percentage with a percentage of 44.4%. Despite his good shooting for the year, he was not selected to participate in the Three-Point Shootout contest during the 2008 NBA All-Star Game, much to the chagrin of Trail Blazers fans. He played in 58 games, starting 3, during the season while averaging 8.0 points, 2.8 rebounds and 22.0 minutes per game. The Trail Blazers finished the 2007–08 season with a 41–41 record. That season was the only time in Jones's NBA career that he missed the playoffs. He was also never on a team with a losing record. On June 26, 2008, he used his player option <b>to</b> <b>opt</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> his contract with the Trail Blazers, making him a free agent for the off-season.|$|E
5|$|In May 2008, {{the owners}} decided <b>to</b> <b>opt</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the 1993 arrangement, per the {{agreement}} with the players, with the termination to follow a year with no salary cap in 2010. By the CBA's expiration in March 2011, the NFLPA and the NFL had not yet come to terms on a new agreement. The owners were expected to lock out the players upon termination of the agreement. However, the NFLPA filed papers to decertify as a union on March 11, 2011, and filed an antitrust suit to enjoin the lockout with lead plaintiffs quarterbacks Tom Brady, Peyton Manning, and Drew Brees. U.S. District Court judge Susan Richard Nelson granted the players' request to end the owners' lockout on April 25. The league asked Nelson to stay the order while they appealed to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals; Nelson refused. On April 29, the Eighth Circuit granted the league a temporary stay of Nelson's ruling; the league reinstated the lockout the same day. The Eighth Circuit vacated Nelson's ruling on July 8, affirming {{the legitimacy of the}} lockout. During the lockout, players were barred from using team facilities and contacting team coaches; many organized their own workout regimens.|$|E
5|$|Milford Haven {{is located}} within the {{geographical}} and historic area known as Little England Beyond Wales, which has predominately used English for many centuries. Although {{it is the most}} westerly point of the country and the part of the county furthest from the English border, a relatively small proportion of the community knows the Welsh language. In the 2011 census, only 7.5% of residents in the Milford Central ward claimed that they could speak, read and write the language, in contrast to the Pembrokeshire county as a whole where roughly 18% of the population are able to read, write and speak Welsh, while in the neighbouring county of Carmarthenshire around 40% of people express a similar level of fluency in Welsh. Local disconnection from the Welsh language was highlighted in November 2008, when Milford Haven Town Council unsuccessfully demanded the right <b>to</b> <b>opt</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a scheme in which official documents had to be translated into Welsh if requested; the council was allegedly one of about 10 that opposed having to make such translations.|$|E
