5|$|Benny Chan {{described}} the filming process {{as some of}} the darkest days of his career, explaining that <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> was a factor beyond his control, and could not work more than eight hours a day. Whenever a scene involving <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> was shot, the crew members had to be silent, communicating in sign language. Benny Chan stated it took time, patience, and money to guide <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> through each shot, and numerous retakes were required due to the baby's constant crying and napping. As a result, production went over budget. Special methods were sometimes used to coax <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> into co-operation. One scene required <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> to suckle Chan's nipple. <b>The</b> <b>baby</b> was initially hesitant, but relented after the crew brushed a large amount of honey onto the nipple.|$|E

40|$|Skinfold {{thickness}} {{measurements were}} made at biceps, triceps, subscapular, and suprailiac sites on both sides on 265 full-term newborn infants.
