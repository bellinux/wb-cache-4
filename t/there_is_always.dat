5|$|The monarch's {{official}} flag in the United Kingdom is the Royal Standard, which {{depicts the}} Royal Arms in banner form. It is flown only from buildings, vessels and vehicles {{in which the}} Sovereign is present. The Royal Standard is never flown at half-mast because <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> a sovereign: when one dies, his or her successor becomes the sovereign instantly.|$|E
5|$|At any time, {{there are}} four or five people working at the control center: two monitor the ATC system, one {{monitors}} passenger information, and one is responsible for secondary systems, such as power supply. In case of technical problems, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> a team of linemen that can be dispatched to perform repairs. Although the trains are not equipped with drivers, there are stewards at stations and on most trains that help passengers, perform ticket controls and assist in emergency situations.|$|E
5|$|Riku Seya, usually {{referred}} to by his surname, is a classmate of Maho's who meets her when they enter junior high school. He is generally a soft-spoken boy who initially takes an interest in Shuichi, whom he believes to be a girl, when they first meet. When he learns that Shuichi is assigned male, Seya becomes angry at Maho for hiding this and stringing him along, but he soon reconciles with her and eventually starts dating her. Seya remains polite with Shuichi, though due to their initial meeting, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> some awkwardness between the two.|$|E

5|$|Von Neumann {{was asked}} to write an essay for the layman {{describing}} what mathematics is, and produced a beautiful analysis. He explained that mathematics straddles the world between the empirical and logical, arguing that geometry was originally empirical, but Euclid constructed a logical, deductive theory. However, he argued, that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> the danger of straying {{too far from the}} real world and becoming irrelevant sophistry.|$|E
5|$|Important {{buildings}} {{include the}} Roman Baths; neoclassical architect Robert Adam's Pulteney Bridge, {{based on an}} unused design for the Rialto Bridge in Venice; and Bath Abbey in the city centre, founded in 1499 {{on the site of}} an 8th-century church. Of equal importance are the residential buildings designed and built into boulevards and crescents by the Georgian architects John Wood, the Elder and his son John Wood, the Younger– well-known examples being the Royal Crescent, built around 1770, and The Circus, built around 1760, where each of the three curved segments faces one of the entrances, ensuring that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> a classical facade facing the entering visitor.|$|E

5|$|The anteroconid—the cusp at {{the front}} of m1—is usually divided in two by a central {{indentation}} (the anteromedian fossettid) in A.donovani, but this fossettid is absent in A.praeuniversitatis. Behind the anteroconid is the protoconid—metaconid pair of cusps. There is an anterolabial cingulum—a crest {{at the front}} labial margin, in front of the protoconid. There is a long crest behind the metaconid, a mesolophid. There is usually no corresponding crest (an ectolophid) behind the protoconid. Another pair of cusps—the hypoconid and the entoconid—is located {{at the back of the}} tooth. The entoconid, the lingual cusp of the two, is oriented forwards. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> a large root {{at the front of}} the tooth and another at the back. A.donovani usually has a small labial root between the two large roots and often also another small root at the lingual side, but only one of four A.praeuniversitatis m1s even has the labial rootlet.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} repairs are the {{grinding}} of the wheels; more complicated repairs {{are made by}} replacing entire components that are sent to the manufacturer. By having components in reserve, trains can have shorter maintenance times. The center also has the system's work trains, including a diesel locomotive that can fetch broken trains. At any time, there are four people working at the control center. Two monitor the ATC system, one monitors passenger information, while the last is responsible for secondary systems, such as power supply. In case of technical problems, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> a team of technicians who {{can be sent to}} perform repairs.

5|$|Jolin {{started to}} depict Stockholm {{when he moved}} to Fiskargatan, on the tall cliffs of {{southern}} Stockholm in 1914. From his studio he could see most of the city. He divided the view, facing Stadsgården or Riddarholmen, into smaller frames for his painings. Noted works from that time are: Strömmen mot Kastellholmen (Over the Strömmen on to the Kastellholmen) 1914, now in the Stockholm City Museum; Utsikt över Riddarholmen (View of Riddarholmen) 1914, bought by the Nationalmuseum but kept in the Moderna Museet, and Utsikt mot Kastellholmen (View towards the Kastellholmen) 1915, now in the Malmö Konstmuseum. In the Stockholm från Söders höjder (Stockholm from the heights of Söder) 1938, elements from Oriental art are present in the naked, branches of the trees and the red buoys looking like Chinese lanterns hanging in the trees. These paintings are defined by swift, flowing brushwork and forceful contours framing fresh, light colours. His composition of the motif involved putting details against big blocks of cool pink, sheer blue, ivory turquoise and emerald, thereby creating a populated setting. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> an air of teaming citylife along the docks and busy boating on the water of the Strömmen in these paintings.|$|E

5|$|The {{necessary}} use of heuristics {{for multiple}} alignment means that for an arbitrary set of proteins, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> {{a good chance}} that an alignment will contain errors. For example, an evaluation of several leading alignment programs using the BAliBase benchmark found that at least 24% of all pairs of aligned amino acids were incorrectly aligned. These errors can arise because of unique insertions into one or more regions of sequences, or through some more complex evolutionary process leading to proteins that do not align easily by sequence alone. As the number of sequence and their divergence increases many more errors will be made simply because of the heuristic nature of MSA algorithms. Multiple sequence alignment viewers enable alignments to be visually reviewed, often by inspecting the quality of alignment for annotated functional sites on two or more sequences. Many also enable the alignment to be edited to correct these (usually minor) errors, in order to obtain an optimal 'curated' alignment suitable for use in phylogenetic analysis or comparative modeling.|$|E
