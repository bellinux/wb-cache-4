It is bought by Gerda Millett (Ingrid Bergman), a powerful and wealthy American widow touring Europe. Just before the Invasion of Yugoslavia by the Nazi Germans, she encounters anti-fascist Davich (Omar Sharif) who commandeers her automobile to sneak into Yugoslavia, hiding in the boot before the border crossing.

500|$|Inspired by , Uriel Weinreich first {{advocated}} {{the use of}} diasystems in structural dialectology, and suggested that such a system would represent {{a higher level of}} abstraction that can unite related dialects into a single description and transcription. While phonemic systems describe the speech of a single variety, diaphonemic systems can reflect the contrasts that aren't made by all varieties being represented. [...] <b>The</b> <b>way</b> <b>these</b> differ can be shown in the name New York. This word may be transcribed phonemically as [...] in American English, as many varieties thereof do not allow the cluster [...] as a syllable onset; in Received Pronunciation, syllable-final [...] doesn't occur so this name would be transcribed [...] to reflect that pronunciation. A diaphonemic transcription such as [...] (with both the [...] and the [...] ) would thus cover both dialects. Neither is described exactly, but both are derivable from the diaphonemic transcription.|$|E

Film critic James Berardinelli described End of Watch as [...] "satisfying and emotionally potent ... a good, gritty drama of the sort that seems increasingly rare within the thriller genre", giving the film 3.5 out of 4 stars. Olly Richards, writing for Empire, gave the film 4 out of 5 stars and summarized it as [...] "a collection of cop-movie clichés but presented with sufficient flair and strong performances that the ride is enough, even if its on rails". While New York Bilge Ebiri found the film largely unrealistic and Ayer's direction [...] "serviceable at best", he wrote that [...] "Ayer and his cast appear to have so convincingly nailed <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>these</b> characters talk and act that you might not even notice the film slipping from workaday grit into out-and-out myth." ...|$|E
500|$|Panzer IVs {{comprised}} around half of {{the available}} German tank strength on the Western Front prior to the Allied invasion of Normandy on 6 June 1944. Most of the 11 panzer divisions that saw action in Normandy initially contained an armored regiment of one battalion of Panzer IVs and another of Panthers, {{for a total of}} around 160 tanks, although Waffen-SS panzer divisions were generally larger and better equipped than their Heer counterparts. Regular upgrades to the Panzer IV had helped to maintain its reputation as a formidable opponent. The bocage countryside in Normandy favored defense, and German tanks and anti-tank guns inflicted very heavy casualties on Allied armor during the Normandy campaign, despite the overwhelming Allied air superiority. German counter-attacks were blunted in the face of Allied artillery, infantry-held anti-tank weapons, tank destroyers and anti-tank guns, as well as the ubiquitous fighter bomber aircraft. The rugged terrain caused the side-skirt armor used to predetonate shaped charge anti-tank weapons, such as the British PIAT, to be pulled away. German tankers in all theaters were [...] "frustrated by <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>these</b> skirts were easily torn off when going through dense brush".|$|E

500|$|Canadian music {{magazine}} Exclaim! published two {{reviews of}} Daybreaker. Bradley Zorgdrager gave an unfavourable {{review of the}} album's sound. He said although the tracks are [...] "catchy and occasionally compelling, they're essentially identical and formulaic, as the atmospheric build-ups and soaring riffs make way for boring breakdowns. The metal-influenced parts sound forced to appease fans disappointed with their last release, which results in Daybreaker sounding more like a business move than a work of art." [...] Scott Harms' review was more favourable, praising the band's return to a much more aggressive style. He credits it for incorporating influences from previous albums, saying [...] "they have found a balance in which {{to return to the}} Searle brothers' heavy sounds while carefully incorporating Sam Carter's soaring clean vocals". Harms summarised his review by saying, [...] "as a whole, [...] sounds epic". Adam Rees of Metal Hammer rated the album 7 out of 10, acknowledging the [...] "abundant" [...] inclusion of string instruments and piano and <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>these</b> instruments create atmosphere. Ress ended his review by calling Daybreaker, [...] "A brave and brilliant British metal album". Canoe.ca author Darryl Sterdan awarded the album 2.5 stars out of 5, saying it [...] "balanc their newfound sensitivity and maturity with plenty of good old-fashioned techno-metal frenzy and primal-scream aggro. Pity they didn’t write memorable songs while they were at it." ...|$|E

[...] Nassiff {{went on to}} say that the album wouldn't appeal to the public, but it would be [...] "welcomed with open arms" [...] by the band's fans. When {{referring}} to the album's lyrics, Nassiff called the album [...] "a concept one", with a theme of [...] "the glory of being a musician", which encompasses having to be away from home for a period of time. [...] "The Downfall of Us All", as Nassiff put it, [...] "gets the listener psyched for the rest of the album". Rock on Request reviewer Anthony Avina furthered this comment by naming the songs [...] "Welcome to the Family" [...] and the title track as examples of the band showing off their [...] "wide range of talent while producing a harmonious album" [...] that the band's fans [...] "will instantly fall in love with". Avina noted the album had [...] "a unique sound that has elements" [...] from other bands such as Chiodos. Petteri Pertola, for Rockfreaks.net, [...] "appreciate <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>these</b> guys fuse metalcore and pop punk seamlessly together", adding that [...] "many songs are plagued by an overtly formulaic approach, but when it works, [...] Homesick is one of the catchiest listens you'll experience this year." [...] Punknews.org reviewer Elliot said the album had an [...] "undeniable quality", that is [...] "melodic competence". He viewed the a cappella intro to [...] "The Downfall of Us All" [...] as being [...] "a little gimmicky", while [...] "Have Faith in Me" [...] was called a tribute to Blink-182.
