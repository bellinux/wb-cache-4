The chrysanthemum growers encountered soil-born diseases, nematodes and accumulation of salinity when production {{in the same area}} was practiced continuously. Soilless culture was a cultivation technique independent from soil condition. The purpose of this research was to determine the growth of chrysanthemum grown in two soilless systems included <b>tray</b> <b>system</b> and trough system. The <b>tray</b> <b>system</b> used seedling trays (50 holes, 140 cm 3 /hole) as container, and the trays were arranged over the raise base covered with polyethylene sheet. Cuttings of chrysanthemum ‘New Yellow’ were grown in the tray and arranged at density 81 plants/m 2. Each plant was irrigated by drip emitter 6 times/day with nutrient solution containing N 200, P 60, K 300 Mg 50, S 75, Fe 12, Mn 2, B 0. 3, Cu 0. 1, Zn 0. 1 mg/L. The trough system was made from polyethylene sheet with a thickness of 0. 04 mm laid over polyethylene sheet. The height of the trough was 15 cm and the width was 1 m. Chrysanthemum cuttings were grown in trough containing of coconut peat thickness 10 cm height and plants were fertigated with nutrient solution by drip tape once a day for three weeks, after that the plants were fertigated three times a week. The growth and flowering of chrysanthemum in the two systems were observed. The growth and quality of flowers produced in the tray and the trough system were similar. No significant differences in flower characteristics were observed between the two systems except for flower color. Chrysanthemum produced in both soilless systems received the same price for grade A as soil grown chrysanthemum.

Die stone expansion and errors introduced by removable die casts may exceed the accuracy required for the passive fit of implant prosthesis. Purpose: The {{purpose of the study}} was to evaluate the linear dimensional accuracy between the implant master die and three conceptually different die systems such as Pindex system, Accu-trac precision die system, and Conventional brass dowel pin system. Materials and Methods: Thirty impressions of implant master die were made with polyether impression material. Ten experimental implant casts were fabricated for each of the three different die systems tested: Accu-trac precision die <b>tray</b> <b>system,</b> Pindex system, and conventional brass dowel pin system. The solid experimental casts were sectioned and then removed from the die system 30 times. Linear distances between all six possible distances were measured from one centre of the transfer coping to the other, using a co-ordinate measuring machine in millimeters up to accuracy of 0. 5 microns. Data were tabulated and statistically analyzed by Binomial non parametric test using SPSS version 15. Results: Significant differences were found for distance A-B (P = 0. 002), A-C (P = 0. 002), A-D (P value = 0. 002), and B-D (P = 0. 021) in Conventional Dowel pin system however for Accu-trac precision die <b>tray</b> <b>system,</b> it was significant only for distance A-D (P = 0. 002) but for Pindex system it was non-significant for all the distances measured.
