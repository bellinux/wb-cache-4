5|$|The list of Greek leaders Troilus wounds expands in {{the various}} re-tellings of the war from the two in Dares to also include Agamemnon, Diomedes and Menelaus. Guido, in keeping his promise <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>of</b> all Troilus' valorous deeds, {{describes}} many incidents. Troilus is usually victorious but is captured in an early battle by Menestheus before his friends rescue him. This incident reappears in the imitators of Guido, such as Lefevre and the Laud and Lydgate Troy Books.|$|E
5|$|The raid was {{considered}} successful—489 POWs were liberated, along with 33 civilians. The total included 492Americans, 23British, threeDutch, twoNorwegians, oneCanadian, and oneFilipino. The rescue, {{along with the}} liberation of Camp O'Donnell the same day, allowed the prisoners <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>of</b> the Bataan and Corregidor atrocities, which sparked {{a new wave of}} resolve for the war against Japan.|$|E
5|$|Although {{initially}} {{skeptical about}} the role, Perrineau took it after Lost creator J. J. Abrams told him more about it. Much of the first season arc for Michael was rewritten; he was originally {{going to be part}} of a love triangle with Korean couple Sun (Yunjin Kim) and Jin (Daniel Dae Kim), but positive fan reaction to the couple meant this storyline was dropped. After Michael leaves the Island in season two, Perrineau knew he would return to Lost at some point; he felt there was more <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>of</b> Michael's story. Reception for the character was mixed. However, Perrineau's acting was praised.|$|E

It chanced one stray seed of Immensity fell into the pretty, petty village of Cheasing Eyebright in Kent, and from the story of its queer germination there and of the tragic futility that ensued, one may attempt--following one thread, as it were--to show {{the direction in which}} the whole great interwoven fabric of the thing rolled off the loom of Time.|$|R

5|$|In a {{nighttime}} raid, {{under the cover}} of darkness and a distraction by a P-61 Black Widow, the group surprised the Japanese forces in and around the camp. Hundreds of Japanese troops were killed in the 30-minute coordinated attack; the Americans suffered minimal casualties. The Rangers, Scouts, and guerrillas escorted the POWs back to American lines. The rescue allowed the prisoners <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>of</b> the death march and prison camp atrocities, which sparked a new rush of resolve for the war against Japan. The rescuers were awarded commendations by MacArthur, and were also recognized by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. A memorial now sits {{on the site of the}} former camp, and the events of the raid have been depicted in several films.|$|E

The two stowaway on a ship to the Citadel, though are uncovered and turned over to C-Sec once they arrive. Though they try <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>of</b> the evidence they have found, they are ignored and told to leave the Citadel. Later, they are suddenly attacked by Jacobus, injuring Tali and mortally wounding Keenah. After being chased through the Citadel, Tali eventually traps Jacobus in an incinerator, killing him, though Keenah collapses and dies.|$|E
5|$|She was {{acutely aware}} of the {{importance}} of promptly publishing her discoveries and thus establishing her priority. Had not Becquerel, two years earlier, presented his discovery to the Académie des Sciences the day after he made it, credit for the discovery of radioactivity, and even a Nobel Prize, would instead have gone to Silvanus Thompson. Curie chose the same rapid means of publication. Her paper, giving a brief and simple account of her work, was presented for her to the Académie on 12 April 1898 by her former professor, Gabriel Lippmann. Even so, just as Thompson had been beaten by Becquerel, so Curie was beaten in the race <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>of</b> her discovery that thorium gives off rays in the same way as uranium; two months earlier, Gerhard Carl Schmidt had published his own finding in Berlin.|$|E

25|$|Énée then rushes on <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>of</b> the devouring of {{the priest}} Laocoön by a sea serpent, after he had warned the Trojans to burn the horse. Énée {{interpret}}s this {{as a sign of}} the goddess Athene's anger at the sacrilege. Against Cassandre's futile protests, Priam orders the horse to be brought within the city of Troy and placed next to the temple of Pallas Athene. There is a sound of what seems to be the clashing of arms from within the horse, but the Trojans, in their delusion, interpret it as a happy omen. Cassandre has watched the procession in despair, and as the act ends, resigns herself to death beneath the walls of Troy.|$|E
25|$|In the Short Parliament {{that started}} on 13 April 1640, Hampden stood forth amongst the leaders. He guided the House {{in the debate}} on 4 May in its {{opposition}} to the grant of twelve subsidies {{in return for the}} surrender of ship money. Parliament was dissolved the next day, and on 6 May an unsuccessful search was made among the papers of Hampden and of other chiefs of the party to discover incriminating correspondence with the Scots. During the eventful months which followed, when Strafford was striving in vain to force England, in spite of its visible reluctance, to support the king in his Scottish war, rumour has much <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>of</b> Hampden's activity in rousing opposition. It is likely enough that the rumour is in the main true, but we are not possessed of any satisfactory evidence on the subject.|$|E
25|$|Elizabeth Graeme married Henry Fergusson on April 21, 1772 {{without her}} father's consent. This caused quite {{a problem for}} the newlyweds. Henry and Elizabeth had been {{introduced}} to each other by Dr. Benjamin Rush, a founding father of Pennsylvania, on December 7, 1771 at one of the salons hosted by Elizabeth and Dr. Graeme. Fergusson was a recent and penniless Scottish Immigrant and he was eleven years younger than Elizabeth. Both of these qualities made him a less than ideal suitor for Elizabeth's hand in marriage and Dr. Graeme forbade that they marry. Four months after they met, Henry and Elizabeth married secretly in Old Swede's Church. Only their close friends attended, including Benjamin Rush, Provost William Smith and his wife. Despite her father's disapproval, Elizabeth had vowed to let her marriage be known. Ironically, the day on which she decided to tell him the news was the day that he suffered his fatal heart attack, with Elizabeth watching him approach Graeme Park through a window of the mansion. Elizabeth was never able <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>of</b> her marriage. She was Dr. Graeme's only living heir, she inherited Graeme Park and by right of marriage Henry Fergusson gained title to the property. With his sudden new fortune Henry Fergusson was able to quickly ascend the Philadelphia society ladder. He traveled to England twice, became director of a prominent Philadelphia library and was awarded the title magistrate in Philadelphia. He was the last magistrate of Philadelphia under British colonial rule. He sailed once more for England in late 1775 just as the American Revolution was beginning to gather steam. He returned to Philadelphia by way of New York City as a loyalist with Sir William Howe commander of the British forces in American. With Howe, Fergusson witnessed the Battle of Brandywine and the occupation of Philadelphia during the Philadelphia campaign. Fergusson involved his wife in his activities by sending her as a messenger to General George Washington to ask for his surrender and to present a bribe to a major in the Continental Army. Both of these incidents caused the Patriots of Philadelphia to doubt her loyalty. There was no doubt about where Henry Fergusson's loyalties lay. He was found a traitor by the Supreme Executive Council of Pennsylvania and Graeme Park was seized under the Confiscation Act of 1778.|$|E

500|$|A {{number of}} stories purport <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>of</b> {{the moment of}} {{inspiration}} for Look Mickey. Critic Alice Goldfarb Marquis writes that the artist recalled {{one of his sons}} pointing to a comic book and challenging; [...] "I bet you can't paint as good as that". Another says that the painting resulted from an effort to prove his abilities to both his son and his son's classmates who mocked Lichtenstein's hard-to-fathom abstracts. American painter Allan Kaprow once stated, in reference to a Bazooka Dubble Bubble Gum wrapper, to Lichtenstein, [...] "You can't teach color from Cézanne, you can only teach it from something like this." [...] Lichtenstein then showed him one of his Donald Duck images.|$|E
500|$|Squab pie {{has been}} the subject of poetry. In [...] "The Squab-Pie.

A boy on the ship goes into town to claim a large squab pie from the bakery for a penny, though it was not meant to be his. Set on a Sunday, the family who had commissioned the pie from the baker, in order to avoid cooking, try to find it, but to no avail. Taylor explains the moral is that if you believe it is a sin to cook on a Sunday, you should not be still having a big meal by getting a baker to cook for you.|$|E
