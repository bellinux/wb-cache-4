The third season finale, he explained, ended with the two universes healing themselves {{with the help of}} a [...] "bridge". He remarked, [...] "What happens if that bridge now begins to be used as a conduit for evil? That’s the issue we’re facing. What do you do? What do you do with this wonderful discovery? Do you keep it? What do you lose if you lose it? For example, if we didn’t have that , we... wouldn’t have all these wonderful characters that we’ve grown to love. What would happen? I think we have <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>that</b> issue. We have to face the issue of 'How long can you keep this alive, this link between interlacing the two universes?'" ...|$|E

40|$|In two experiments, we {{provided}} {{support for the}} hypothesis that stimuli with preexisting memory representations (e. g., famous <b>faces)</b> are easier <b>to</b> associate to their encoding context than are stimuli that lack long-term memory representations (e. g., unknown faces). Subjects viewed faces superimposed on different backgrounds (e. g., the Eiffel Tower). Face recognition on a surprise memory test was better when the encoding background was reinstated than when it was swapped with a different background; however, the reinstatement advantage was modulated by how many faces had been seen with a given background, and reinstatement did not improve recognition for unknown faces. The follow-up experiment added a drug intervention that inhibited the ability to form new associations. Context reinstatement did not improve recognition for famous or unknown faces {{under the influence of}} the drug. The results suggest that it is easier to associate context <b>to</b> <b>faces</b> <b>that</b> have a preexisting long-term memory representation than <b>to</b> <b>faces</b> <b>that</b> do not...|$|R

40|$|In Lewicki’s (1986 a) {{demonstration}} of Hidden Co-variation Detection (HCD), responses were slower <b>to</b> <b>faces</b> <b>that</b> corresponded with a co-variation encountered previously than <b>to</b> <b>faces</b> with novel co-variations. This slowing {{contrasts with the}} typical finding that priming leads to faster responding, and might suggest that HCD is a unique type of implicit process. We extended Lewicki’s (1986 a) methodology and showed that participants exposed to nonsalient co-variations between hair length and personality were subsequently faster <b>to</b> respond <b>to</b> <b>faces</b> with those co-variations than <b>to</b> <b>faces</b> without, despite lack of awareness of the critical co-variations. This result confirms that people can detect subtle relationships between features of stimuli and that, as {{with other types of}} implicit cognition, this detection facilitates responding. </p...|$|R
