5|$|At the time, <b>the</b> <b>EC</b> {{viewed the}} {{agreement}} {{as a method}} of defusing the crisis and failed to attribute the lull which coincided with the Brioni Agreement to a shift in Serbian strategy instead. <b>The</b> <b>EC</b> delegation's failure to respond to Jović's departure before the plenary meeting and <b>the</b> <b>EC</b> foreign ministers' declaration of 10 July indicating <b>the</b> <b>EC</b> would withdraw from mediation if the Brioni Agreement was not implemented only encouraged Serbia which, unlike Slovenia, Croatia, or the Yugoslav federation, had nothing to lose if <b>the</b> <b>EC</b> pulled out.

5|$|A further {{result of}} <b>the</b> <b>EC</b> delegation's mission were talks {{attended}} {{by representatives of}} <b>the</b> <b>EC,</b> Croatia, Slovenia, Serbia and the Yugoslav government. The talks were held at Brijuni Islands on 7 July. Besides <b>the</b> <b>EC</b> delegation, headed by van den Broek, five out of eight members of the federal presidency attended the talks—Mesić, Bogić Bogićević, Janez Drnovšek, Branko Kostić and Vasil Tupurkovski. The Yugoslav federal prime minister Ante Marković was also present, as were the Yugoslav federal foreign minister Budimir Lončar, interior minister Petar Gračanin and the deputy defence minister Vice Admiral Stane Brovet. Croatia was represented by President Franjo Tuđman while President Milan Kučan attended on behalf of Slovenia. Serbia was represented by Borisav Jović, a former Serbian member of the federal presidency who had resigned from the position on 15 June, instead of Milošević who refused to attend. Starting at 8am, <b>the</b> <b>EC</b> delegation held separate talks with Kučan and his assistants, then with Tuđman and his assistants, and finally with Jović. In the afternoon, a plenary meeting was held with the federal, Slovene and Croatian delegations in attendance, while Jović reportedly left dissatisfied with the talks.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{energy transfer}} between counter-propagating quantum Hall edge channels (ECs) in a two-dimensional electron system at filling factor ν= 1. <b>The</b> <b>ECs</b> {{are separated by}} a thin impenetrable potential barrier and Coulomb coupled, thereby constituting a quasi one-dimensional analogue of a spinless Luttinger liquid (LL).

5|$|On 23 June 1991, as Slovenia and Croatia {{prepared}} to declare their independence during {{the breakup of}} Yugoslavia, the European Community (EC) foreign ministers decided <b>the</b> <b>EC</b> member states would not extend diplomatic recognition to the two states. <b>The</b> <b>EC</b> viewed the declarations as unilateral moves and offered assistance in negotiations regarding {{the future of the}} SFR Yugoslavia instead. At the same time, <b>the</b> <b>EC</b> decided to suspend direct talks with Slovenia and Croatia. The move was welcomed by the Yugoslav federal government. Slovenia and Croatia declared independence on 25 June, and the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) units began to deploy from its bases in Slovenia the next day. On 27 June, armed conflict broke out as the JNA and the Territorial Defence Force of Slovenia (TDS) began fighting over control of Slovenia's border posts, in what became the Ten-Day War.|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{the present}} study was to analyze the {{intercellular}} calcium communication between smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and endothelial cells (ECs) by simultaneously monitoring artery diameter and intracellular calcium concentration in a rat mesenteric arterial segment in vitro under physiological pressure (50 mmHg) and flow (50 microl/min) in a specially developed system. Intracellular calcium was expressed as the fura 2 ratio. The diameter was measured using a digital image acquisition system. Stimulation of SMCs with the alpha(1) -agonist phenylephrine (PE) caused not only an increase in the free intracellular calcium concentration of the SMCs as expected but also in <b>the</b> <b>ECs,</b> suggesting a calcium flux from the SMCs to <b>the</b> <b>ECs.</b> <b>The</b> gap junction uncoupler palmitoleic acid greatly reduced this increase in calcium in <b>the</b> <b>ECs</b> on stimulation of the SMCs with PE.

In addition to the lengthened larval cycle in <b>the</b> mutant, <b>ecd</b> 1 /ecd 1 animals, they also display behavioral differences as compared with controls.

40|$|Intestinal {{stem cells}} (ISCs) {{in the adult}} Drosophila midgut proliferate in order to self-renew and produce {{differentiating}} daughter cells that replace those lost as part of normal gut function. Intestinal stress induces the activation of Upd/Jak/Stat signalling, which promotes intestinal regeneration by inducing rapid SC proliferation and faster tissue turnover. I have investigated {{the role of the}} Hippo (Hpo) pathway in the Drosophila midgut. The Hpo pathway regulates tissue size via the control of both apoptosis and proliferation during Drosophila development. In the midgut, Hpo pathway inactivation in either the SCs or their differentiated daughter cells, <b>the</b> enterocytes (<b>ECs),</b> induces a phenotype similar to that observed under stress situations, including increased proliferation and expression of Upd cytokines. Hpo pathway targets are induced by stresses such as bacterial infection, suggesting that the pathway functions as a sensor of cellular stress in <b>the</b> <b>ECs.</b> In addition, Yki, the pro-growth transcription factor target of the pathway, is required in ISCs to drive the proliferative response to stress. Yki inactivation has no obvious effect on baseline homeostasis, while survival upon infection is affected by loss of Yki in either <b>the</b> ISCs or <b>ECs.</b> My findings suggest that the Hpo pathway is a mediator of the regenerative response in the midgut. In the final part of the project, I have addressed possible mechanisms of Yki activation, with a view to gaining further insight into Yki function in <b>the</b> <b>ECs.</b> <b>The</b> data suggest a possible link between the generation of reactive oxygen species, JNK signalling and Yki activation. Several explanations could account for the requirement of Yki expression in <b>the</b> <b>ECs.</b> Yki expression itself might induce stress in <b>the</b> <b>ECs,</b> leading to upd expression and the regenerative response. Alternatively, the Hpo pathway might function as a stress sensor, triggering Upd release in response to noxious stimuli...|$|R
