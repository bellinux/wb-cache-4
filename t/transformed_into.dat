50|$|Scholars {{have also}} shown that rhetorical circulation, {{understood}} through a Marxist lens, involves transformation. First, ideas <b>transform</b> <b>into</b> texts, or products. After this transformation, texts can also <b>transform</b> <b>into</b> other texts. For example, a scientist might have an idea for an experiment, and that idea might <b>transform</b> <b>into</b> a research proposal. Later, the research proposal might <b>transform</b> <b>into</b> a journal article, and then a news release.|$|R

40|$|Optical and x-ray {{investigations}} of cholesteryl linoleate are reported. The phase behavior {{depends upon the}} rate of cooling. On fast cooling (quenching) at < 26 Â°, the smectic A phase <b>transforms</b> <b>into</b> another smectic A-type phase of closer packing. This phase <b>transforms</b> <b>into</b> solid phase at 10. 5 Â°. These observations are supported by x-ray investigations. On allowing the sample to stabilize {{for a long time}} at 26 Â° (after cooling from the isotropic phase), the smectic A phase gradually <b>transforms</b> <b>into</b> a new phase, which subsequently <b>transforms</b> <b>into</b> crystals.

5|$|For example, {{near the}} mouth of the Yangtze, the baiji was a princess that had lost her parents and had lived with her step-father, whom she had longed to get away from. The step-father wanted to trade her since she would have been sold for a great sum of money, but as they were {{crossing}} the river to get to the trader, a storm rolled in, and they were drenched. The step-father, enraged, tried to take her, but she plunged herself into the river. Before being drowned in the river, she was <b>transformed</b> <b>into</b> a dolphin, and swam away from her abusive step-father, who also fell in and was <b>transformed</b> <b>into</b> a porpoise.|$|E

50|$|Aside {{from the}} five Gokaiger keys, the other Ranger Keys are not {{specific}} {{to any of the}} five Gokaigers. While the Gokaigers can primarily <b>transform</b> <b>into</b> a previous Super Sentai hero of their color, the Gokaigers can use a Ranger Key of any color. For example, in the events of episode 2 and the film Tensou Sentai Goseiger vs. Shinkenger: Epic on Ginmaku, each of the Gokaigers <b>transforms</b> <b>into</b> a different previous red hero. When their representative color is not on the previous team, the Gokaiger can <b>transform</b> <b>into</b> the closest analog. For example, when the Gokaigers <b>transform</b> <b>into</b> the Gaorangers, Gokai Green <b>transforms</b> <b>into</b> Gao Black and Gokai Pink <b>transforms</b> <b>into</b> Gao White. If the gender of the original hero is different, the Gokaiger's transformed suit will match the style used by their gender (save for Sun Vulcan, where the female style of a suit had to be created {{due to the lack of}} female members). For example, when Gokai Blue and Gokai Yellow <b>transform</b> <b>into</b> Magi Blue and Magi Yellow, respectively, in episodes 1 and 3, the Magi Blue suit is in the male Magiranger style and the Magi Yellow suit in the female style.|$|R

5000|$|Upon {{the start}} of a match, a player's {{transformation}} bar starts filling up. After thirty seconds, the bar reaches full capacity, and the player has the option to <b>transform</b> <b>into</b> a larger and stronger robot. The type of robot that the player <b>transforms</b> <b>into</b> is dependent on the body armor piece the player is wearing. However, if a player had purchased a [...] "transformation pack" [...] from the store using gigas or coins, they are able to <b>transform</b> <b>into</b> more powerful robots with special attacks. Upon transforming, there is a small chance of getting a special transformation in which the player will <b>transform</b> <b>into</b> a boss virus from Sector battles.|$|R

With Tokyo <b>transformed</b> <b>into</b> a Vortex World filled with demons, the Protagonist becomes instrumental to the schemes of the Reasons, beings who seek to remake the world in their image, and Lucifer, the lord of demons.
