40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} define the Buddha’s conceptions as a causal theory that is doubtless coincides with <b>the</b> notion <b>of</b> <b>dependent</b> arising. We know that <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> <b>dependent</b> arising is core subject upon which we can indisputably resolve <b>the</b> problem <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{previous}} interpretation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> general causal theory in early Buddhism. Furthermore we can understand <b>the</b> notion <b>of</b> <b>dependent</b> arising in <b>the</b> Abhidharmma philosophy in order to defining <b>the</b> original meaning <b>of</b> Buddha. Additionally we survey <b>the</b> general nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> law <b>of</b> causation to specify the dependent arising, but {{which is a little}} different from <b>the</b> notion <b>of</b> <b>dependent</b> arising in our survey. There are four kinds of general characteristic states that are similar ideas to <b>the</b> law <b>of</b> causation, i. e., suchness, necessity, invariability and conditionality in the Abhidhamma philosophy. These four characteristics form the supporting basis for dependent arising in the Buddhist schools. Lastly, this paper has a brief overview <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dependent</b> arising for the careful study that seems to us highly structured and well worth for <b>the</b> investigation <b>of</b> ideas viewed <b>the</b> Abhidhamma philosophy...|$|R
