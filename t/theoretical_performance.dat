500|$|A more {{sophisticated}} technique {{with a similar}} flavor and with better <b>theoretical</b> <b>performance</b> was developed by [...] They observed that each pass of radix sort {{can be interpreted as}} a range reduction technique that, in linear time, reduces the maximum key size by a factor of; instead, their technique reduces the key size to the square root of its previous value (halving the number of bits needed to represent a key), again in linear time. As in radix sort, they interpret the keys as two-digit base- numbers for a base [...] that is approximately [...] They then group the items to be sorted into buckets according to their high digits, in linear time, using either a large but uninitialized direct addressed memory or a hash table. Each bucket has a representative, the item in the bucket with the largest key; they then sort the list of items using as keys the high digits for the representatives and the low digits for the non-representatives. By grouping the items from this list into buckets again, each bucket may be placed into sorted order, and by extracting the representatives from the sorted list the buckets may be concatenated together into sorted order. Thus, in linear time, the sorting problem is reduced to another recursive sorting problem in which the keys are much smaller, the square root of their previous magnitude. Repeating this range reduction until the keys are small enough to bucket sort leads to an algorithm with running time [...]|$|E
2500|$|These {{questions}} {{relate to}} the performance analysis and development of Simplex-like methods. [...] The immense efficiency of the Simplex algorithm in practice despite its exponential-time <b>theoretical</b> <b>performance</b> hints {{that there may be}} variations of Simplex that run in polynomial or even strongly polynomial time. [...] It would be of great practical and theoretical significance to know whether any such variants exist, particularly as an approach to deciding if LP can be solved in strongly polynomial time.|$|E
2500|$|The Simplex {{algorithm}} and its variants fall in {{the family}} of edge-following algorithms, so named because they solve linear programming problems by moving from vertex to vertex along edges of a polytope. [...] This means that their <b>theoretical</b> <b>performance</b> {{is limited by the}} maximum number of edges between any two vertices on the LP polytope. [...] As a result, we are interested in knowing the maximum graph-theoretical diameter of polytopal graphs. [...] It has been proved that all polytopes have subexponential diameter. The recent disproof of the Hirsch conjecture is the first step to prove whether any polytope has superpolynomial diameter. If any such polytopes exist, then no edge-following variant can run in polynomial time. Questions about polytope diameter are of independent mathematical interest.|$|E

This memorial was presented on the 17th of September, 1781, by Mr. Wheler, conformably (as he says) to the desire of the Governor-General; and it contained a long and elaborate dissertation on the trade to China, tending to prove the advantage of extending the sale of English manufactures and other goods to the North of that country, beyond the usual emporium of European nations. This ample and not ill-reasoned <b>theoretical</b> <b>performance</b> (though not altogether new either in speculation or attempt) ended by a practical proposition, very short, indeed, of the ideas opened in the preliminary discourse, but better adapted to the immediate effect. It was, that the Company should undertake the sale of its own opium in China, and commit the management of the business to the memorialist, who offered to furnish them with a strong armed ship for that purpose. The offer was accepted, and the agreement made with him for the transport of two thousand chests.|$|E
