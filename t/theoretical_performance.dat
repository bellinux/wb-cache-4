As in radix sort, they interpret the keys as two-digit base- numbers for a base [...] that is approximately [...] They then group the items to be sorted into buckets according to their high digits, in linear time, using either a large but uninitialized direct addressed memory or a hash table. Each bucket has a representative, the item in the bucket with the largest key; they then sort the list of items using as keys the high digits for the representatives and the low digits for the non-representatives. By grouping the items from this list into buckets again, each bucket may be placed into sorted order, and by extracting the representatives from the sorted list the buckets may be concatenated together into sorted order. Thus, in linear time, the sorting problem is reduced to another recursive sorting problem in which the keys are much smaller, the square root of their previous magnitude. Repeating this range reduction until the keys are small enough to bucket sort leads to an algorithm with running time [...]|$|E
2500|$|These {{questions}} {{relate to}} the performance analysis and development of Simplex-like methods. [...] The immense efficiency of the Simplex algorithm in practice despite its exponential-time <b>theoretical</b> <b>performance</b> hints {{that there may be}} variations of Simplex that run in polynomial or even strongly polynomial time. [...] It would be of great practical and theoretical significance to know whether any such variants exist, particularly as an approach to deciding if LP can be solved in strongly polynomial time.|$|E
2500|$|The Simplex {{algorithm}} and its variants fall in {{the family}} of edge-following algorithms, so named because they solve linear programming problems by moving from vertex to vertex along edges of a polytope. [...] This means that their <b>theoretical</b> <b>performance</b> {{is limited by the}} maximum number of edges between any two vertices on the LP polytope. [...] As a result, we are interested in knowing the maximum graph-theoretical diameter of polytopal graphs. [...] It has been proved that all polytopes have subexponential diameter. The recent disproof of the Hirsch conjecture is the first step to prove whether any polytope has superpolynomial diameter. If any such polytopes exist, then no edge-following variant can run in polynomial time. Questions about polytope diameter are of independent mathematical interest.|$|E
