40|$|New Voices for Old Words is a {{collection}} of previously unpublished Algonquian oral traditions featuring historical narratives, traditional stories, and legends that were gathered during {{the late nineteenth and early}} twentieth centuries. The collection presents them here in their original languages with new English-language translations. Accompanying essays explain the importance of the original texts and their relationships to the early researchers who gathered and, in some cases, actively influenced these texts. Covering the northeast United States, eastern Canada, the Great Lakes region, and the Great Plains, the Algonquian languages represented in New Voices for Old Words include Gros Ventre, Peoria, Arapaho, Meskwaki, Munsee-Delaware, Potawatomi, and Sauk. All of these languages are either endangered or have lost their last speakers; for several of them no Native text has ever been published. This volume presents case studies in examining and applying such principles as ethnopoetics to the analysis of traditional <b>texts</b> <b>in</b> <b>several</b> <b>languages</b> of the Algic language family. These studies show how much valuable linguistic and folkloric information can be recovered from older texts, much of it information that is no longer obtainable from living sources.

40|$|In {{the last}} thirty years, thanks to a joint effort by theorists, {{researchers}} and translators, Translation Studies has become a significant new field of knowledge, capable of developing its own theories, methodologies and research tools. At the same time, translation activity has also boomed, not only in quantitative terms since globalization policies have boosted the exchange of information between cultures {{as well as the}} production of <b>texts</b> <b>in</b> <b>several</b> <b>languages</b> but also as to the diversification of translation tasks, with the emergence of new forms of translation, most of them stemming from technological developments, such as software localization and subtitling. These developments pose a new challenge to translator training. How can learners be trained to successfully meet the growing and increasingly diverse demands of the translation market? This article will tackle some aspects of this challenge, with special focus on the revised notion of translation competence and the impact of recent technological and theoretical developments on translation practice and, consequently, on translation teaching and learning. It builds a case for the creation of opportunities for potential future trainers to discuss such pedagogical issues as teaching and learning approaches, goals, didactics, methods and strategies, as well as evaluation and assessment.

40|$|Abstract. Multilingual text {{compression}} exploits {{the existence}} of the same <b>text</b> <b>in</b> <b>several</b> <b>languages</b> to compress the second and subsequent copies by reference to the first. This is done based on bilingual text alignment, a map-ping of words and phrases <b>in</b> one <b>text</b> to their semantic equivalents in the translation. A new multilingual text compression scheme is suggested, which improves over an immediate generalization of bilingual algorithms. The idea is to store the necessary markup data within the source language text; the incurred compression loss due to this overhead is smaller than the savings in the compressed target language texts, for a large enough number of the latter. Experimental results are presented for a parallel corpus in six languages ex-tracted from the EUR-Lex website of the European Union.

40|$|For {{more than}} forty years machine {{translation}} has been an active area of research and development. Several variants of MT systems have been proposed e. g., interactive systems, batch-mode systems requiring a large amount of human post-editing and systems that generate <b>text</b> <b>in</b> <b>several</b> <b>languages</b> from a common structured set of data rather than a source text. Although there are some successful systems and several products on the market, it is still the case that most translators and translation companies prefer not to use MT-systems. In fact, it has been estimated “that the current share of anything that could be called MT, pure or mixed, is well below 1 % of the total translation market ” (Isabelle et al, 1993). This situation is likely to change, however. The disappointment over the performance of automatic systems has caused a change of direction in system development, putting the focus on systems that will support the translators rather than replace them. The ever increasing processing capacity of PCs and workstations will also enable translators and companies to purchase powerful tools as add-ons to their ordinary word processing programs. Furthermore, as we show below, already very simple tools can speed up th...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} use of {{general-purpose}} machine translation (MT) in assisting the users of computer-aided translation (CAT) systems based on translation memory (TM) to identify the target words in the translation proposals {{that need to be}} changed (either replaced or removed) or kept unedited, a task we term as "word-keeping recommendation". MT is used as a black box to align source and target sub-segments on the fly in the translation units (TUs) suggested to the user. Source-language (SL) and target-language (TL) segments in the matching TUs are segmented into overlapping sub-segments of variable length and machine-translated into the TL and the SL, respectively. The bilingual sub-segments obtained and the matching between the SL segment in the TU and the segment to be translated are employed to build the features that are then used by a binary classifier to determine the target words to be changed and those to be kept unedited. In this approach, MT results are never presented to the translator. Two approaches are presented in this work: one using a word-keeping recommendation system which can be trained on the TM used with the CAT system, and a more basic approach which does not require any training. Experiments are conducted by simulating the translation of <b>texts</b> <b>in</b> <b>several</b> <b>language</b> pairs with corpora belonging to different domains and using three different MT systems. We compare the performance obtained to that of previous works that have used statistical word alignment for word-keeping recommendation, and show that the MT-based approaches presented in this paper are more accurate in most scenarios. In particular, our results confirm that the MT-based approaches are better than the alignment-based approach when using models trained on out-of-domain TMs. Additional experiments were performed to check how dependent the MT-based recommender is on the language pair and MT system used for training. These experiments confirm a high degree of reusability of the recommendation models across various MT systems, but a low level of reusability across language pairs.

Emphasis is laid on the limitations of any form of word searching, especially when synonymous terms need {{to be found in}} more than one language {{in the course of a}} search. The need for the IPC to keep pace with both the developments of the technology of the inventions in patents and the rapid changes in the field of electronic retrieval of patent information, is highlighted. The practicalities and implications of the establishment of the authentic <b>text</b> <b>in</b> both English and French, with "official" texts and "unofficial" <b>texts</b> <b>in</b> <b>several</b> more <b>languages,</b> for the convenience of users, are explored.

In this process errors and inconsistencies in the version in the first language are identified, and hence contribute further to the improvement of the IPC. A natural language system for interrogating the text of the IPC in French (CIB-LN), to enable users unfamiliar with the IPC to input their query in natural language and receive the most suitable IPC terms in reply, is also described. INPI has developed this system in response to user demand in searching the commercial and, more especially, the free Internet patent databases.
