5|$|Maxwell {{ordered his}} first lieutenant, Henry Parkyns Hoppner, to take Lord Amherst {{and his party}} {{in two of the}} boats to an island, known today as Pulo Leat, <b>three</b> <b>miles</b> away. The island's thick {{vegetation}} prevented an assessment of whether it was inhabited, and forced the boat crews to row a further <b>three</b> <b>miles</b> along the shore before finding a suitable landing spot between the mangroves. The rest of the ship's company were evacuated in the remaining boats and a large raft. Because of the lack of provisions, in particular drinking water, it was decided that Hoppner would continue with Amherst and his embassy to Java, roughly 200 miles to the south. Once there, a rescue could be initiated.|$|E

5|$|Although its {{population}} had dropped below a thousand {{by the late}} 1920s, in 1927 the state replaced the stage road with what eventually became Highway 82.
