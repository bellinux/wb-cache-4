Babyface expressed how {{he went through}} more than one version of the song and described its production as a beautiful movie ballad <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> different from anything he, Carey, or Houston had ever previously recorded. In an interview with Vibe, Carey said that she [...] "liked [...] the way it was". She had characterised it as [...] "a very big ballad but in an inspirational way" [...] and denied speculation {{that there had been}} past rivalry or animosity between her and Houston prior to its recording: [...] "I never even really talked to her until this.

But also I feel like there have to be stakes. This year was filled with foreboding of violence and death, and the connection of that early summer between the riots, which resulted in death, police killing innocent people, and the Richard Speck murders and the guy on the Texas tower [...] The randomness and the nihilism that was born from <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> that permeated the story.

500|$|MacFarlane has a {{baritone}} voice. He is {{a pianist}} and singer who, {{in his early}} years, trained with Lee and Sally Sweetland, the vocal coaches of Barbra Streisand and Frank Sinatra.

[...] His comedy influences include people like Woody Allen, Jackie Gleason, Mel Brooks, and the creators of Monty Python.

500|$|The song has {{received}} generally favorable reviews from critics, who couldn't help to avoid {{comparisons between the}} track and Michael Jackson's work. Chris Martins of Spin called the recording [...] "wonderfall', stating <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> that [...] "Mars might say". He also wrote that the track was an [...] "80's-informed backing track". Sam Lanksy of Idolator praised the track, saying [...] "fortunately" [...] the drinking during the recording sections [...] "paid off on the song" [...] since it [...] "is probably our favorite effort from Mars to date". Tina Jamias from AXS.com recommended, [...] "Watch the turning point of an 80s movie and listen to [...] "Moonshine". Perfect match". Having previously stated [...] "The '80s are revisited in [...] "Moonshine" [...] with Mars taking on the sounds and styles of Michael Jackson and Madonna". Jason Lipshut of Billboard wrote that [...] "The production is so buttery that the listener can't help but get another sugar rush". Joe DeAndrea of the same publication, while reviewing Mars' 5 Best Deep Cuts, opined [...] "one of the most eclectic songs Mars has ever delivered...with a retro pop feel and a slight disco vibe to it, Mars unleashes a dose of musical ecstasy." ...|$|E
500|$|With Imaginos again {{a work in}} {{progress}} at the end of 1986, band manager Steve Schenk contacted Albert Bouchard to get the original recordings he still owned. Pearlman, with the help of engineers Paul Mandl and Steve Brown, spent his time cleaning up, re-arranging and remixing the original recordings, using state-of-the-art technology and the collaborations of studio musicians. Virtuoso guitarist Joe Satriani financed the recording of his second album, Surfing with the Alien, through his work on Imaginos. Similarly, thrash metal guitarist Marc Biedermann, whose band Blind Illusion was recording at Hyde Street Studios, mixed the album The Sane Asylum at Pearlman's studio in exchange for his collaboration. Biedermann declared in a 2008 interview that he [...] "played more lead guitar on that album than Buck Dharma". Roeser went to California in early 1987 to record his lead vocals and some guitar parts, while Tommy Zvoncheck, still a member of Blue Ã–yster Cult, re-recorded most of the keyboards on the album. The last parts recorded were the lead vocals by Eric Bloom, who was in the studio in early 1988. Donald Roeser later summed up his and Bloom's late involvement in the making of the album by saying [...] "Imaginos was our parting of the ways. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> that Eric and I agreed to do, sort of, out of respect for Sandy and his effort that he made with Imaginos".|$|E
500|$|Storylines for a {{potential}} series had been drafted by writer Mike Bullen during production of the pilot. When production on the series began, producer Christine Langan worked with him to create detailed plots for all six episodes, also acting as a script editor to redraft Bullen's work. Many of the plots were drawn from his own life; Pete and Jenny bringing up their new baby paralleled Bullen and his wife, whose first child was born in late 1997. The scenes where Pete and Jenny attend the antenatal classes were written from Bullen's memory, {{when he and his}} wife were [...] "given callipers, forceps and a suction cup to play with". The conclusion of the fourth episode, in which Pete's father dies on the way to his grandson's christening, was suggested by Harries, whose own experience of the death of his father taught him that people rarely have the opportunity to say goodbye to loved ones in real life. Not all storylines were based on real life: For Karen and David's marriage guidance scenes in Episode 5, Bullen consulted the relationship support charity Relate. Actors and directors also had input into the scripts; Bullen's original script for the marriage therapy scenes ended with David shouting and apparently using a fire extinguisher as an offensive weapon. Bathurst was not convinced <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> that his character would do, as David is [...] "too much of a coward to do anything overtly" [...] and would not leave himself so [...] "exposed": ...|$|E

500|$|The Daily Star quoted Rowland on {{the theme}} of the song. She said [...] "I hope to see women singing the song like they're in charge. It's {{important}} to know that we are commanders who have the power to shape our own destiny." [...] Love explained to Rap-Up magazine his view of the song, [...] "It's just such an aggressive record, it's a club record, it's a worldwide international record. She's stretching her legs out and she's showing her true vocal ability, she's like the queen of the night on this record." [...] Then during the video shoot of the song Rowland said [...] "I feel like I've finally come into my own," [...] a reference to the exploration of a new musical sound. [...] "With the sound of dance music getting embraced more, I'm very excited, seeing how fans have been responding to the music. Dance music is more of a European thing, but I've been looking on Twitter and seeing fans (in different parts of the country) talking about playing 'Commander'." [...] She said working with Guetta was [...] "amazing" [...] because it is [...] "effortless" [...] and she feels a great sense of [...] "chemistry" [...] when working with him. Rowland felt she was trying something different: [...] "In this generation and this day and time, no one is putting soul in dance music... no pop artist. I thought maybe <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> I could try. And then it works." [...] In an interview for MSN Xin Rowland admitted the song was [...] "darker" [...] than her previous material but still fun. [...] "I just thought it'd be so much fun to be a commander of course. It's just a statement for me definitely, coming out on my own, filling my space. I'm happy being a commander".|$|E
500|$|After co-starring on 2004's {{fourth season}} of The Shield on cable network FX, Close told network {{president}} John Landgraf {{that she would}} be open to star in another series, suggesting a spin-off for her Shield character, Captain Monica Rawling. Landgraf pitched Damages to Close, who agreed to play Patty so long as the series was shot in New York City, where she resides. To prepare for her role, Close met New York attorney Mary Jo White and her partner Lorna Scoffield, as well as litigator Patricia Hines, from whom Close learned [...] "some extraordinary things". The producers sought after Byrne to play Ellen, but she was unavailable during the first round of auditions as she was filming 28 Weeks Later. She says the opportunity [...] "came up again, so I went in, auditioned, and got the role". Like Close, Byrne spent time with a female lawyer in New York and read books written by litigators Alan Dershowitz and David DuBois, while Donovan talked to his uncle, a New York corporate lawyer. He visited Manhattan's Centre Street courts, where he [...] "followed the most intense murder trial". Ivanek was so eager to work on the series that he auditioned for two different roles, and was cast as Ray. Todd Kessler said that Danson's 1979 film The Onion Field was [...] "a huge influence on Glenn, Daniel and myself, and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> that had always stuck in our minds. And when we sought out to cast this role of Arthur Frobisher, Ted kind of came into focus." [...] In preparation for his role, the producers asked Danson to meet with CEOs of Fortune 500 corporations and watch documentaries such as , which examines the collapse of Enron. They also suggested that Danson meet with Close's acting coach Harold Guskin. The producers said that David and Katie were the hardest characters to cast. Noah Bean, who felt that he gave [...] "an awful first audition" [...] for the role of David, was called in for a second reading as he was waiting for an elevator to leave the building, and was ultimately cast. British actress Anastasia Griffith's agent informed her of the audition for the role of Katie only two hours before it began. When she met the producers, they were initially concerned about a Brit playing an American, especially since Australian Byrne had already signed on. [...] "To put their fears at rest", Griffith addressed the producers in an American accent from beginning to end of the audition. After being cast, Griffith and Byrne visited New York University dialect coach Deborah Hecht to perfect their accents.|$|E

[...] In a similar vein, Carl Friedrich von WeizsÃ¤cker, Lise Meitner's former assistant, later added that Hahn [...] "certainly did deserve this Nobel Prize.

Palomo primarily wrote the album using a Voyetra-8, a Korg MS-20 and a modified Commodore 64, and the first weeks of production in Helsinki involved him learning this equipment. Palomo first saw the Voyetra-8 in the music video for New Order's [...] "The Perfect Kiss", {{saying that he was}} amazed by its appearance: [...] "It's this bizarre, kaleidoscope interface with these knobs, and it's really physical to use, a strange kind of challenge". Palomo's songwriting on Era ExtraÃ±a was more influenced by his live performances than his previous projects, and he claimed that he had never expected to perform his songs live before. He said, [...] "It was an influence; not so much something that limited me, but a feeling that lead to longer, more soundscape-driven songs. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> that was undeniably in my mind: 'What would I want to be playing every night for eight months?'
