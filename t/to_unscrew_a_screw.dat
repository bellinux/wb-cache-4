They are intelligent enough to learn how <b>to</b> <b>unscrew</b> <b>a</b> jar and are known to raid lobster traps. O. vulgaris was the first invertebrate animal protected by the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 in the UK; it was included because of its high intelligence.|$|R

I could see in the corner the outline of a large furnace (in those days the poorer classes had still no central heat) and near it a tall boiler. In front of this a man was kneeling, evidently trying <b>to</b> <b>unscrew</b> <b>a</b> nut, but twisting it the wrong way. He was an elderly man with a grey moustache, and was dressed, in open defiance of the law, in a military costume or uniform.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—We {{present an}} {{approach}} for learning sequential robot skills through kinesthetic teaching. The demonstrations {{are represented by}} a sequence graph. Finding the transitions between consecutive basic movements is treated as classification problem where both Support Vector Machines and Gaussian Mixture Models are evaluated as classifiers. We show how the observed primitive order of all demonstrations can help to improve the movement reproduction by restricting the classification outcome to the currently executed primitive and its possible successors in the graph. The approach is validated with an experiment in which a 7 -DOF Barrett WAM robot learns <b>to</b> <b>unscrew</b> <b>a</b> light bulb. I...|$|R

5000|$|A shackle is a {{piece of}} metal to attach two ropes, or a block to a rope, or a sail to a rope. Customarily, a shackle has a {{screw-in}} pin which often is so tight that a shackle-key must be used <b>to</b> <b>unscrew</b> it. <b>A</b> snap-shackle does not screw, and can be released by hand, but it is usually less strong or more expensive than a regular shackle.|$|R
50|$|Hydration reservoirs, {{also known}} as ‘hydration bladders,’ are large volume, {{flexible}} bags typically carried in a backpack system. Users access water via a 'sipping tube.'

50|$|Tools, such as hooks or socket {{wrenches}} can be mounted {{at the end}} of the pole. More sophisticated poles can accept pneumatically or hydraulically driven power tools which allow, for example, bolts <b>to</b> be <b>unscrewed</b> remotely. <b>A</b> rotary wire brush allows a terminal to be scoured clean before a connection is made. However, a worker's dexterity is naturally reduced when operating tools {{at the end of}} a pole that is several metres long.|$|R
50|$|Plugs {{often include}} a pilot light LED {{indicator}} {{to indicate that}} electrical power is connected. Optionally, the plug may be equipped with an internal fuse for electrical safety, usually rated at 10 amps or less. In some designs, {{the tip of the}} plug may be <b>unscrewed</b> <b>to</b> reveal <b>a</b> cylindrical glass fuse; other variants may use a newer blade-type fuse inserted into the side or back of the plug.|$|R
50|$|The nosecap of the {{flashlight}} {{has the ability}} <b>to</b> be <b>unscrewed,</b> and <b>a</b> custom lens can be fitted. The flashlight contains five lens in the tailcap, consisting of two red lens, blue lens, white lens, and diffuser lens (earlier three red and no blue-green). This enabled soldiers to send signals using different colors, or to cast the light in different methods. As {{the flashlight}} could not be focused/unfocused, the diffuser lens was used to spread the light in such a fashion that it would throw out a wide glow of light, {{as opposed to a}} narrow, focused beam.|$|R
50|$|Early {{separation}} systems using Marman clamps used {{explosive bolts}} for release. These have problems of unpredictability, {{the need to}} contain debris and difficulties in testing them. A more recent approach uses <b>a</b> <b>screw</b> thread. The tension of the clamp band itself is used <b>to</b> power the <b>unscrewing</b> of <b>a</b> central bolt, when released by a NASA Standard Initiator (NSI), a pyrotechnic pin puller.|$|R
50|$|Allied forces {{developed}} their own designs of anti-handling devices during World War II. For example, the American M123A1, M124A1, M125 and M131 series of chemical long delay tail-fuzes which were used in air-dropped bombs, starting around late 1942 and remaining in service until the 1960s. Frequently fitted to M64 (500 lb), M65 (1000 lb) and M66 (2000 lb) general-purpose bombs, these fuzes were primarily designed to operate as chemical long-delay fuzes, with settings ranging between 15 minutes and 144 hours. The time delay mechanism was simple but effective: after being dropped from the aircraft a small propellor {{at the rear of}} the bomb revolved, gradually <b>screwing</b> <b>a</b> metal rod into the fuze, crushing an ampoule of acetone solvent contained within it. When this happened the fuze was fully armed and the timer countdown had started. The acetone soaked into an absorbent pad next to a celluloid disk which held back a spring-loaded firing pin from a percussion cap connected to an adjacent detonator. Acetone slowly dissolved the celluloid disk, gradually weakening it until the cocked firing pin was released and the bomb detonated. The time delay of the fuze varied according to the acetone concentration and the thickness of the celluloid disk. Removing a chemical long delay fuze from a bomb after it had been dropped would have been a straightforward process had it not been for the fact that there was an integral anti-withdrawal mechanism designed to kill anyone who tried to render the bomb safe. Fuzes such as the M123 (and its derivatives) contained two small ball-bearings at the lower end which slid out of recesses when the fuze was screwed into the bomb by aircraft armorers. The ball-bearings jammed into the screw-threads inside the fuze well, preventing the fuze from being removed. Because the lower end of the fuze was locked in place deep inside the bomb (where it was hard to get at) this posed major problems for enemy EOD personnel. Attempting <b>to</b> <b>unscrew</b> <b>a</b> fully armed chemical long-delay fuze caused it to split into two separate fuze assemblies. This action automatically triggered detonation by releasing the cocked firing pin in the lower fuze assembly, with lethal results for anyone nearby.|$|R
2500|$|After the RAF investigative board {{completed}} its {{report on the}} Halifax crash on 1 July 1942, it was distributed to a restricted list of approved recipients, but not publicly divulged. In the interests of wartime secrecy, the announcement of Blumlein's death was not made for another three years. The investigative board, headed by AIB Chief Inspector Vernon Brown – who later also investigated the post-war Star Tiger and Star Ariel disappearances – and assisted by Rolls-Royce, {{who had made the}} Halifax's Merlin engines, found that the crash was caused by engine fire, attributed <b>to</b> the <b>unscrewing</b> of <b>a</b> tappet nut on the starboard outer engine, which had been improperly tightened by an RAF engine fitter while inspecting the engine some three hours prior to the crash.|$|R
5000|$|Each team {{starts out}} on a yacht half a mile off the Mexican Riviera, with once key handed to them by T. J. Lavin. Every player has to jump off the yacht, and swim to the shore, in which the {{remainder}} of the challenge will be a footrace, containing checkpoints that are reminiscent of the aforementioned challenge games. T. J. Lavin explains to each team that all team members must cross the finish line to win the Army Strong Final Challenge. Each checkpoint contains a key that a team will need in order to obtain instructions for further checkpoints, and after the first checkpoint, teammates must be connected together by chains for {{the remainder of the}} race unless they are instructed otherwise. The first checkpoint is a combination of the [...] "Chill Out" [...] and [...] "Assembly Required" [...] games, in which players from each team must jump into a large ice tub in order to retrieve 20 pieces of a puzzle that are located at the bottom of the ice tub. Once a team has solved their puzzle, they can obtain another key, and then race to the next checkpoint, which is based on the [...] "Screw You" [...] challenge. Each team has <b>to</b> <b>unscrew</b> <b>an</b> oversize wing nut until it has been removed off a track, which contains the key to the next checkpoint, which is based on the [...] "Sliders" [...] elimination game. Note: Prior to this checkpoint, Eric collapsed and needed medical assistance, and the Veterans team became disqualified when he was removed from the final challenge. The final two checkpoints are based on the [...] "Man Overboard" [...] and [...] "I Dig You" [...] games. At the [...] "I Dig You" [...] checkpoint, each team must dig deep through the sand in order to retrieve a treasure chest that contains a flag. After digging through the sand, the Veterans raise their flag ahead of the Rookies, however T. J. Lavin does not blow horn, because the Veterans had already been disqualified. Once the Rookies raise their team flag, they are declared the winning team.|$|R
50|$|An early device {{developed}} for concealing intelligence reports when traveling by water {{was a simple}} weighted bottle that could be dropped overboard {{if there was a}} threat of capture. This was replaced by a wafer-thin leaden container in which a message was sealed. It would sink in water, and melt in fire, and could be used by agents on land or water. It had one drawback - lead poisoning if it was swallowed. It was replaced by a silver, bullet-shaped container that could be <b>unscrewed</b> <b>to</b> hold <b>a</b> message and which would not poison a courier who might be forced to swallow it.|$|R

50|$|Often, solving {{one part}} of the puzzle will reveal items, codes (passwords), or {{pathways}} that in turn that help solve another part of the puzzle. The aforementioned cupboard, for example, yields a screwdriver, and the screwdriver is used <b>to</b> <b>unscrew</b> the painting, which yields <b>a</b> <b>screw</b> in return, and so on. The player must often apply lateral thinking when trying to find uses for the items retrieved in order to solve the puzzles. Codes can be in a variety of formats, usually involving simple number sequences but can also be as complex as involving colours, directions and binary; these must be entered into the appropriate elements inside the game's environment correctly in order to advance through the game.|$|R

50|$|By {{pushing the}} hand lever of a manual turret forward, the tool is moved via the turret's slide toward the {{workpiece}} {{being held by}} the chuck, soon making contact and cutting or forming the part. On the return stroke, the tool is retracted and then indexed to the next tool held in the turret. In this way, a sequence of operations can be performed on a part without switching tools with each operation. That is, different tools can be shifted into position without the need <b>to</b> <b>unscrew</b> one and screw in another. Each tool can be set for a different length of travel by <b>a</b> stop <b>screw</b> located at the far right of the turret.|$|R
