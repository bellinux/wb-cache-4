5|$|Analysis of Estonian {{oil shale}} {{resources}} and mining possibilities intensified {{during the early}} 20th century while Estonia {{was part of the}} Russian Empire. Industrial development was under way in Saint Petersburg (known as Petrograd in 1914–24), but regional fuel resources were in short supply. A large shale oil extraction plant for processing Estonian oil shale was proposed in 1910. The outbreak of World War I, coupled with a fuel supply crisis, accelerated <b>the</b> <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> research.|$|E

5|$|In a squad {{with much}} less star power than that {{sent to the}} Tour de France, they were again {{middle of the pack}} in the team time trial, {{finishing}} 11th of 22 teams. The squad did not show themselves much, as it was not until stage 10 that they so much as finished in the top ten on a stage. Phinney took fifth place in the stage 10 individual time trial, {{a minute and a half}} off <b>the</b> <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day's winner Tony Martin. Frank rode to fourth from a breakaway in the next stage, again a minute and a half off <b>the</b> <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day's winner, this time David Moncoutié. All the team had to show for itself from the second half of the Vuelta was a seventh place from Van Avermaet in the field sprint finish to stage 12. Six BMC riders reached the Vuelta's finish, with Van Avermaet in 83rd place being their highest overall finisher.|$|E
5|$|Leeds United manager George Graham signed Hasselbaink in {{the summer}} of 1997 for a fee of £2 million. He scored on his Premier League debut in a 1–1 draw with Arsenal at Elland Road on 9 August, though {{initially}} he struggled to adapt to <b>the</b> <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> English game. He scored only five league goals before Christmas, but ended the campaign with 26 goals in all competitions following a strong second half of the season.|$|E
5|$|Next, The New Age Outlaws (Road Dogg and Billy Gunn) and Kane faced The Shield (Dean Ambrose, Seth Rollins and Roman Reigns). <b>The</b> <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{match was}} quick; {{the end of}} the match saw Kane being hit by Reigns' {{signature}} spear, and Reigns then hit both Outlaws simultaneously with another spear. The Shield then performed their Triple Powerbomb maneuver on both Outlaws for a decisive victory.|$|E

5|$|Barnes {{was also}} quiet after lunch, and after one {{long period of}} defence, he drove Laker for four through the covers, {{eliciting}} a round of ironic applause. The Australian opener responded by placing {{his hand on his}} chest and bowing to the spectators. Barnes had started slowly, but he accelerated after reaching his half-century. Bradman took two consecutive boundaries from Wright to bring up his fifty. This left Barnes on 96 and Australia at 222/1, half an hour after tea. By this time, <b>the</b> <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pitch appeared to have slowed, making batting relatively easy.|$|E
5|$|Hans Bethe {{once said}} that Klaus Fuchs was the only {{physicist}} he knew who truly changed history. Because {{the head of the}} Soviet project, Lavrenti Beria, used foreign intelligence as a third-party check, rather than giving it directly to the scientists, as he did not trust the information by default, it is unknown whether Fuchs's fission information had a substantial effect. Considering that <b>the</b> <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Soviet program was set primarily by the amount of uranium they could procure, it is hard for scholars to accurately judge how much time this saved.|$|E

5|$|On July 6, Burke {{signed a}} maximum rookie contract—120 {{percent of the}} preset salary scale of $2,032,300—with the Jazz, {{resulting}} in a contract worth in $4,987,320 guaranteed salary for his first two seasons, while the Jazz have team option rights for {{the third and fourth}} years. This cleared the way for Burke to participate in the July 7–12 Orlando Summer League. At point guard, the Jazz had traded Randy Foye and were negotiating with Mo Williams. In the NBA Summer League, Trey Burke shot at 24 percent from the field, including 1–19 on three-point shots, while trying to adjust to <b>the</b> <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> NBA game. He was even benched for a game. Following Burke's Summer League performance, the Jazz signed John Lucas III.|$|E
5|$|The four group winners, Argentina, Yugoslavia, Uruguay and the United States, {{moved to}} the semi-finals. The two semi-final matches saw {{identical}} scores. The first semi-final was played between the USA and Argentina on a rain-drenched pitch. The United States team, which featured six British-born players, lost midfielder Raphael Tracy after ten minutes to a broken leg as the match became violent. A Monti goal halfway through the first half gave Argentina a 1–0 half-time lead. In the second half, {{the strength of the}} United States team was overwhelmed by <b>the</b> <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Argentinian attacks, the match finishing 6–1 to Argentina.|$|E
5|$|The {{potential}} {{of both the}} car and Webber, who had certainly worked well to out-qualify his vastly more experienced teammate, was highlighted by the closeness they had to other teams which ran the Renault engine and although the Adrian Newey-designed car had flaws which contributed to Webber's scoreless season to that point. Though <b>the</b> <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> car seemed to be picking up, with Coulthard qualifying in the top-10 for the , Webber was unable to convert his early weekend pace into a competitive grid position due to hydraulic problems. His race was much the same with a similar hydraulic problem leading to him retiring early in the race whilst teammate Coulthard notched up the team's first points with a fifth-place finish.|$|E

5|$|The terrier of {{this period}} was short of leg, built in a chunky fashion, and had a skull that was broad across the top. Used in hunting packs and kept in kennels along with English Foxhounds, they were bred {{for their ability to}} drive the fox out of its den. Gradually <b>the</b> <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hunt became faster, and the terriers were bred with longer legs for more speed {{towards the end of the}} 18th century. However the {{increased}} size meant that the Fox Terrier became too big to be used for its original purpose, and its use in fox hunting began to decline.|$|E
5|$|The third {{prototype}} {{made its}} maiden flight in early 1948, but <b>the</b> <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flight testing was leisurely with only 7 hours and 40 minutes completed by 30 November, {{over half of}} which were connected with air show performances. Testing concluded in March 1949 when the officer in charge {{concluded that there was}} no further purpose to the tests. While the Firecrest was faster than the Firebrand, and gave its pilot a much better view from the cockpit, it was otherwise disappointing, with test pilot and naval aviator Captain Eric Brown claiming that the Firecrest was even less manoeuvrable than the sluggish Firebrand, while the powered ailerons gave lumpy controls, leading to instability in turbulent air.|$|E
5|$|Those {{with more}} serious {{injuries}} {{had to be}} carried down the track. The usual {{decision as to whether}} it was safe to move someone was simplified by the Japanese, who killed all the wounded they encountered. Only those near death were abandoned. Casualties were held at the aid posts and dressing stations until they could walk, or the Japanese threatened. It took eight or ten Papuan carriers to move each man. Army stretchers rotted and fell apart; the Papuans improvised stretchers from blankets, copra bags and timber cut along the Track. <b>The</b> <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> withdrawal was dictated by the rate at which casualties could be evacuated.|$|E

5|$|After lunch, Morris was bowled for 62. Bradman joined Barnes and the Australian skipper {{played and}} missed {{a few times}} before {{settling}} down. Barnes responded to his captain's difficulties by manipulating the strike and shielding Bradman from Bedser. The Australian opener had little trouble against the leg trap Bedser set for him, scoring freely into the leg side and taking the shine off the second new ball. Generally however, Barnes also scored sedately after lunch, and after one extended period of defence, he drove Laker for four through the covers, eliciting a round of ironic applause. Barnes responded to the public gallery by placing {{his hand on his}} chest and bowing to the spectators. Barnes had started slowly, but accelerated after reaching his half-century. He reached 96 with Australia at 1/222 half an hour after tea. By this time, <b>the</b> <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pitch appeared to have slowed, making batting relatively easy.|$|E
5|$|After the {{withdrawal}} from Gallipoli the Australians returned to Egypt and the AIF underwent a major expansion. In 1916 the infantry {{began to move}} to France while the cavalry units remained in the Middle East to fight the Turks. Australian troops of the Anzac Mounted Division and the Australian Mounted Division saw action in all the major battles of the Sinai and Palestine Campaign, playing {{a pivotal role in}} fighting the Turkish troops that were threatening British control of Egypt. The Australian's first saw combat during the Senussi uprising in the Libyan Desert and the Nile Valley, during which the combined British forces successfully put down the primitive pro-Turkish Islamic sect with heavy casualties. The Anzac Mounted Division subsequently saw considerable action in the Battle of Romani against the Turkish between 3–5 August 1916, with the Turks eventually pushed back. Following this victory the British forces went on the offensive in the Sinai, although <b>the</b> <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> advance was governed by the speed by which the railway and water pipeline could be constructed from the Suez Canal. Rafa was captured on 9 January 1917, while the last of the small Turkish garrisons in the Sinai were eliminated in February.|$|E
5|$|Although Michigan {{was able}} to score first, it was Michigan State that {{dictated}} <b>the</b> <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game. After Michigan's 34-yard field goal, the only scoring in the first quarter, Michigan State responded with a 61-yard rushing touchdown by Edwin Baker, which were the first points of the second quarter. Michigan took the lead {{a few minutes later}} with a 12-yard touchdown reception by Martell Webb, but the Spartans responded with a 41-yard rushing touchdown by Le'Veon Bell, and later added to their lead with a 38-yard field goal by Dan Conroy just before halftime. State built on their lead in the third quarter with 2 touchdowns: first a 41-yard reception by Mark Dell, then an 8-yard run by Larry Caper. Michigan's only points of the second half came on a 4-yard rushing touchdown by Denard Robinson. Michigan State sealed their win with a 28-yard field goal midway through the fourth quarter.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> editing <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Day After was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most nerve-wracking {{processes}} ABC {{had ever}} gone through in post-production {{of any of}} their films.

5000|$|While prequels {{generally}} rob readers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> narrative tension at the outset, Tor {{notes that}} Erikson avoids this pitfall by placing <b>the</b> story thousands <b>of</b> years in <b>the</b> past with long-lived characters that actually span the time period. Critics also praised Erikson's genius in weaving together multiple themes and characters but criticized <b>the</b> <b>pacing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> novel {{due to the}} [...] "characters’ penchant for introspection or philosophizing".|$|R
5000|$|Critic Matthew Saliba of Rogue Cinema says, [...] "The visual {{aesthetic}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film {{is quite}} something and very reminiscent of David Lynch's [...] "Lost Highway."
