40|$|Volumetric {{ultrasound}} imaging has been primarily {{used as a}} clinical tool to diagnose cardiac dysfunction. However, the modality still suffers from system complexity due to {{a large number of}} receive channels for volumetric reconstruction. The aim {{of the study was to}} numerically assess a cross-shaped sparse array with a dynamic transmit focusing method to reduce the system complexity and to compensate for the image quality of unfocused volumetric imaging. Analytical simulations with <b>two-way</b> <b>point</b> spread functions demonstrated that the cross-shaped sparse array entailed up to an 84 % increase in side-lobes (up to 32 dB), thus leading to significant degradation of the point spread function in the diagonal plane. A dynamic transmit focusing method was able to vividly overcome the image degradation by transmitting more beams with tilting angles. This also yielded a comparable image sensitivity (65 dB) to that of the full array when 31 × 31 tilted waves were used. The proposed cross-shaped sparse array with the dynamic transit focusing method can be used to enhance the frame rate as well as the image quality for unfocused {{ultrasound imaging}}...|$|R

40|$|Our {{animal studies}} suggest that the basal ganglia provide an {{internal}} non-specific cue to trigger movement and imply that Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s disease involves a deficiency in this cueing mechanism. Indeed parkinsonian patients typically rely upon external visual cues. To assess the effects of such non-specific cueing mechanisms on movement, we examined patients 2 ̆ 7 utilization of a variety of auditory cues. Ten patients suffering from Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s disease, and their matched controls, pressed buttons at a series of <b>two-way</b> choice <b>points</b> sequentially down a pathway, both when the latter remained illuminated throughout its length, and when it had to be followed from memory alone. In other experimental conditions, auditory cues were also provided, either contingent upon the previous response, at its initiation (a medium level of advance information) or at its completion (a low level of advance information), or as a series of regularly paced (non-contingent) auditory cues (from a metronome). In addition to error data, we recorded down time (DT, time to initiate each next response) and movement time (MT), time to execute each next response). However, both DT and MT measurements showed that parkinsonian patients were enormously disadvantaged by the absence of external cues. While contingent auditory cues were of some help, the performance of patients with Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s disease was dramatically improved by the provision of non-contingent auditory information. Moreover, parkinsonian patients, unlike controls, were greatly affected by the length of individual sub-movements, especially in the absence of external cues. When the pathway to be followed remained illuminated, sub-movement length had little effect. We conclude that for well-learnt, predictable sequences the basal ganglia provide a non-specific internal cue that is necessary for switching between one movement and the next in a movement sequence, and also for development of preparatory activity for each sub-movement in the sequence...|$|R
40|$|In {{a growing}} number of schools in the United States, {{students}} are learning through two languages in programs that aim to develop dual language proficiency along with academic achievement. These two-way bilingual programs integrate language minority and language majority students and provide content area instruction and language development in two languages. A study of over 160 schools between 1991 and 1994 provides a picture of the current state of two-way bilingual education in the United States. Two-way programs typically share the goals of bilingual proficiency, academic achievement, and positive cross-cultural attitudes and behaviors, but they vary a good deal in the approaches and strategies they use to work toward those goals. A host of local factors affect such issues as student enrollment, program features and design, and instructional features. Emerging results of studies of <b>two-way</b> bilingual programs <b>point</b> to their effectiveness in educating nonnative-English-speaking students, their promise of expanding our nation's language resources by conserving the native language skills of minority students and developing second language skills in English-speaking students, and their hope of improving relationships between majority and minority groups by enhancing cross-cultural understanding and appreciation...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the goals}} of {{exploration}} geophysics is to obtain an image of the subsurface. In petroleum exploration and near-surface geophysics, this is best achieved using reflected waves. For this, a controlled seismic or electromagnetic source is placed at the surface, activated, and the wavefields that it creates are recorded at the surface after being reflected from subsurface structures. However, it is not always possible to use controlled sources at the surface. An alternative is to make use of seismic or electromagnetic interferometry. By crosscorrelating wavefields, which are recorded at two points at the surface and result from sources around the two points, the reflection response can be retrieve between these two points as if there were a controlled source at one of the points and a receiver at the other. This book shows derivations of different seismic and electromagnetic interferometry relations using as a starting <b>point</b> <b>two-way</b> and one-way reciprocity theorems of the time-correlation type. Using numerically modeled data, the retrieval of the reflection response is investigated from the crosscorrelation of recorded wavefields from subsurface transient and noise sources. This is performed for acoustic, elastic and electromagnetic waves. The ability of seismic interferometry to retrieve reflection responses in practical applications is demonstrated with two examples. The first example uses laboratory data from an inhomogeneous granite block, where transmission recordings are crosscorrelated resulting from separate P-wave and S-wave transient sources. The second example is with field data from a desert area, where transmission recordings are crosscorrelated resulting from seismic background-noise sources in the subsurface.

40|$|AbstractRoutines-based early {{intervention}} (RBEI) {{for children with}} or at risk for developmental delay encourages collaboration between professionals and families to enhance children's participation in family routines with family-selected goals. We conducted the first single-blinded randomized control trial to examine {{the effectiveness of a}} 6 -month RBEI vs. traditional home visiting (THV), which uses a curriculum focused on children's developmental domains. Thirty-one families with children aged 5 – 30 months (mean age 17. 4 months) with or at risk for developmental delay were randomly assigned to an RBEI group (n= 15) or a THV group (n= 16). The enrolled children were evaluated using the Chinese version of Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory (PEDI-C) and the Comprehensive Development Inventory for Infants and Toddlers (CDIIT) at 5 time <b>points.</b> <b>Two-way</b> mixed analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to examine the group by stage interactions. Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS) and the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) were applied to explore between-group differences on individualized goal achievement. PEDI-C showed that the RBEI group had a faster progress rate in self-care functions and independence in social functions in the first 3 months of intervention and at the 6 -month follow-up. The RBEI group also scored higher on the GAS in the first 3 months of intervention. However, between-group differences in changes in the developmental domains on the CDIIT were not significant. Thus, RBEI was more effective than THV in promoting functional outcomes and reaching family-selected goals, while both interventions allowed equal improvement in developmental domains...|$|R
