5|$|An area of {{disturbed}} weather {{formed on}} August 26, 2003 and drifted westward. The disturbed weather then began <b>to</b> <b>organize</b> <b>and</b> the system became a tropical depression on August 28. Moving westward over waters greater than 82°F (28°C), Tropical Depression Ten-E rapidly strengthened into {{a tropical storm}} and was named Jimena by the National Hurricane Center.|$|E
5|$|A weak surface trough, located to {{the west}} of an upper-level low, {{developed}} convection to the east of the Bahamas on July 26. A tropical wave entered the area two days later, resulting in an increase of convective organization and area. Although conditions were not favorable for tropical cyclone formation, it sped to the northwest and steadily organized, developing a surface area of low pressure on the 30th. On July 31, the system continued <b>to</b> <b>organize,</b> <b>and</b> developed into Tropical Depression One while located 200miles (320km) to the east of Jacksonville, Florida.|$|E

5|$|By 1899, the {{sandstone}} shaft marker placed by Chandler Robbins in 1875 had been disturbed and broken, {{so it was}} replaced with a new stone by two U.S. Surveyors, Hubert D. Page and James M. Lentz. In 1912, a simple cement pad was poured around the marker. The first modern Navajo government convened in 1923 in an effort <b>to</b> <b>organize</b> <b>and</b> regulate an increasing amount of oil exploration activities on Navajo lands, and they would play {{a big role in}} the monument's further development.|$|E
5|$|French and Wabanaki Confederacy raiding {{activity}} {{continued in}} northern Massachusetts in 1705, {{against which the}} English colonists were unable to mount an effective defense. The raids happened too quickly for defensive forces <b>to</b> <b>organize,</b> <b>and</b> reprisal raids usually found tribal camps and settlements empty. There was a lull in the raiding while the French and English leaders negotiated the exchange of prisoners, with only limited success. Raids by Indians persisted {{until the end of}} the war, sometimes with French participation.|$|E
5|$|In October 1961, Nasser {{embarked}} on a major nationalization program for Egypt, believing the total adoption of socialism was the answer to his country's problems and would have prevented Syria's secession. In order <b>to</b> <b>organize</b> <b>and</b> solidify his popular base with Egypt's citizens and counter the army's influence, Nasser introduced the National Charter in 1962 and a new constitution. The charter called for universal health care, affordable housing, vocational schools, greater women's rights and a family planning program, as well as widening the Suez Canal.|$|E

5|$|To silence Luna, Aguinaldo {{appointed}} him as Chief of War Operations on 26 September 1898, and assigned {{the rank of}} brigadier general. In quick succession, he was made the Director or Assistant Secretary of War and Supreme Chief of the Republican Army on 28 September, arousing {{the envy of the}} other generals who were fighting since {{the first phase of the}} Revolution. Meanwhile, Luna felt that bureaucratic placebos were being thrown his way, when all he wanted was <b>to</b> <b>organize</b> <b>and</b> discipline the enthusiastic but ill-fed and ill-trained troops into a real army.|$|E
5|$|Union troops {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>organize</b> <b>and</b> {{train at}} military {{camps in the}} city, as battles in Kentucky and Tennessee caused major changes to Indianapolis. After the battles of Fort Henry and Fort Donelson, the Union began to collect {{a large number of}} Confederate prisoners of war for transport to the North. Governor Morton volunteered to hold some of the prisoners at Indianapolis. Designated as one of four northern prisoner-of-war camps, Camp Morton was converted into one of the Union's largest prisons for captured Confederate soldiers.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on August 31, 2006. It moved westward without development, and entered the eastern Pacific Ocean on September 10. An area of convection developed along the wave axis, several hundred miles south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec. It moved slowly westward and steadily organized. Convection and banding features organized around a developing center, and the system developed into Tropical Depression Thirteen-E on September 13. The system continued <b>to</b> <b>organize</b> <b>and</b> strengthened into Tropical Storm Lane early on September 14 about 90miles (145km) {{off the coast}} of Mexico. Based on a potentially developing anticyclone over the storm and a track over warm water temperatures, the Statistical Hurricane Intensity Prediction Scheme model issued a 46percent probability for rapid intensification of the storm.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on October4. It moved westward across the Atlantic Ocean without development, and entered the eastern Pacific Ocean on October18. The next day, it combined with a previously existing area of disturbed weather, resulting in a large area of convection extending northward into southern Mexico. The broad and disorganized system moved westward at 1015mph (1624km/h). On October20, the system developed an area of low pressure, and began to show signs of organization. It continued <b>to</b> <b>organize,</b> <b>and</b> developed into Tropical Depression Seventeen-E on October21 while located about 265miles (425km) south-southwest of Manzanillo. Upon forming, the depression possessed a small, tight low-level circulation beneath a well-defined mid-level circulation. Easterly wind shear initially restricted upper-level outflow as the cyclone moved to the west, a motion due to a subtropical ridge to its north.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on September 17. It moved across the shear-ridden Atlantic Ocean without development, and remained disorganized until reaching the western Caribbean Sea on September 26. There, the wave situated itself beneath an upper-level anticyclone, allowing for favorable upper-level outflow and for deep convection to develop. On the September 27, a low pressure area developed while the system was located a few hundred miles to the east of the Yucatán Peninsula. The system continued <b>to</b> <b>organize,</b> <b>and</b> nearly developed into a tropical depression before moving ashore on the Yucatán Peninsula on September 29.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on September 19. The wave moved westward, but was difficult to track due to its proximity to Hurricane Lisa and another large tropical wave. It passed through the Lesser Antilles, and slowly organized as convection increased due to an upper level low. On October 5, it entered the Gulf of Mexico, and developed an area of low pressure two days later. The system continued <b>to</b> <b>organize,</b> <b>and</b> on October 8, after developing a circulation, it developed into Tropical Depression Fourteen while located 205miles (330km) to the southeast of Brownsville, Texas.|$|E
5|$|A westward-moving {{tropical}} wave {{exited the}} coast of Africa on July 17. It tracked across the unfavorable Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea without development, and after crossing Central America, it entered the eastern Pacific Ocean on July 25. The cloud pattern and convection began to become better organized on July 28, and shortly thereafter a mid-level circulation developed. It continued <b>to</b> <b>organize,</b> <b>and</b> subsequent {{to the development of}} a low-level circulation it formed into Tropical Depression Seven-E while located about 975miles (1,575km) south-southeast of Cabo San Lucas on July 29. Operationally, tropical cyclone advisories were not initiated until visible satellite images confirmed the low-level circulation twelve hours after the depression formed.|$|E
5|$|Around 1200UTC the {{following}} day, Linfa further intensified into a severe tropical storm. A microwave satellite {{image of the}} storm depicted an eye-feature surrounded by deep convection. Interacting with a nearby upper-level low, poleward outflow significantly improved late on June19, fueling further strengthening. Slowly tracking in a general northward direction, Linfa continued <b>to</b> <b>organize</b> <b>and</b> by June20, the JTWC upgraded Linfa to a typhoon. A small, ragged eye appeared on visible satellite images by this time and several hours later, the storm reached its peak intensity just below typhoon-status according to the JMA. Maximum sustained winds peaked at 110km/h (70mph 10-minute winds) and a barometric pressure of 975hPa (mbar).|$|E

5|$|Convection {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>organize</b> <b>and</b> deepen as {{the nascent}} depression continued west-northwestward, steered by a ridge to the north. However, dry {{air from the}} Arabian Peninsula and cooler waters proved deleterious to the system, and the circulation became more disorganized on October30. Despite the marginally favorable conditions, the overall structure improved on November1, with pronounced outflow developing along the western periphery. A nearby buoy reported a barometric pressure of , which confirmed the increasing organization. At 03:00UTC on November1, the IMD upgraded the depression to a deep depression, and 24hours later to Cyclonic Storm Keila. By that time, the agency estimated peak 3minute sustained winds of 65km/h (40mph) while the storm was just 150km (95mi) southeast of Oman. The American-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) also designated the system as Tropical Cyclone 03A at 03:00UTC on November2.|$|E
5|$|During the American Civil War, Indianapolis, {{the state}} capital of Indiana, was a major base {{of support for the}} Union. Governor Oliver P. Morton, a major {{supporter}} of President Abraham Lincoln, quickly made Indianapolis a gathering place <b>to</b> <b>organize</b> <b>and</b> train troops for the Union army. The city became a major railroad hub for troop transport to Confederate lands, and therefore had military importance. Twenty-four military camps were established in the vicinity of Indianapolis. Camp Morton, the initial mustering ground <b>to</b> <b>organize</b> <b>and</b> train the state's Union volunteers in 1861, was designated as a major prisoner-of-war camp for captured Confederate soldiers in 1862. In addition to military camps, a state-owned arsenal was established in the city in 1861, and a federal arsenal in 1862. A Soldiers' Home and a Ladies' Home were established in Indianapolis to house and feed Union soldiers and their families as they passed through the city. Indianapolis residents also supported the Union cause by providing soldiers with food, clothing, equipment, and supplies, despite rising prices and wartime hardships, such as food and clothing shortages. Local doctors aided the sick, some area women provided nursing care, and Indianapolis City Hospital tended to wounded soldiers. Indianapolis sent an estimated 4,000 men into military service; an estimated 700 died during the war. Indianapolis's Crown Hill National Cemetery was established as one of two national military cemeteries established in Indiana in 1866.|$|E
5|$|Early in the season, a {{low-pressure}} area {{formed and}} persisted north of Honduras. Despite moderate wind shear, the low managed <b>to</b> <b>organize,</b> <b>and</b> was designated Tropical Depression One on June 8. The storm strengthened further, {{and it was}} upgraded to Tropical Storm Arlene on the following day. From this point, Arlene headed north, intensifying steadily as it spread tropical storm-force winds and heavy rains to the Cayman Islands and Cuba. Arlene made landfall in Cuba near Cabo Corrientes with 50mph (80km/h) winds. Wind shear weakened as the storm entered the Gulf of Mexico {{on the morning of}} June 10, and the storm intensified to just under hurricane strength with 70mph (110km/h) winds.|$|E
