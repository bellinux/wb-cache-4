5|$|In 1925, the Pirates {{became the}} first team <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> a three-game to one deficit to defeat the Washington Senators and win the World Series. Pittsburgh's third and final World Series {{championship}} while they played at Forbes Field came in 1960. Bill Mazeroski hit the first home run to end a World Series and as of 2017, the only walk-off home run in World Series Game 7 history.|$|E
5|$|Born in West Germany, Wever {{moved to}} the United States as a child, where he took up {{baseball}}. He played baseball {{in high school and}} the University of California, Santa Barbara, which led to him being drafted by the New York Yankees. After four seasons in the minor leagues, Wever made his major league debut on 17 September 1982. In his debut, he suffered a shoulder injury, which he tried to pitch through for two years before having surgery in 1984. He tried <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> the injury in 1985, but retired. After retiring, he opened a bar in San Francisco, which he continues to run.|$|E
5|$|Kuznetsova {{joined the}} Russian team in 2011. In {{the first round}} they faced France on 5 and 6 February. In the first round, Kuznetsova was {{defeated}} by Alizé Cornet, but defeated Virginie Razzano a day later. She teamed up with Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova and defeated Cornet/Julie Coin in the doubles. Russia became just the fourth nation <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> 0–2 down in a Fed Cup tie since the best-of-five-match format {{was introduced to the}} World Group in 1995. Russia defeated Italy in the semifinal in 5–0. There, Svetlana Kuznetsova defeated Roberta Vinci. Russia succeeded, the first time since 2008, in a final in the Fed Cup. Russia, however, lost against Czech Republic in 3–2.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-1930s, Chicago Black Hawks {{owner and}} staunch American {{nationalist}} Frederic McLaughlin commanded his general manager {{to compile a}} team of only American players; at the time, Taffy Abel was the only American-born player who was a regular player in the league. With eight out of 14 players Americans, the Black Hawks won only 14 of 48 games. In the playoffs, however, the Hawks upset the Canadiens, New York Americans, and the Maple Leafs to become the only team in NHL history to win the Stanley Cup despite a losing regular-season record. In the 1942 Stanley Cup Finals, the heavily favoured Toronto Maple Leafs were facing an upset, having fallen 3–0 in the seven-game series to the fifth-place Detroit Red Wings. Toronto rebounded, and won the next four games to capture the Stanley Cup, becoming {{the first of four}} teams in the NHL <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> a 3–0 series deficit and the only team to accomplish that in the Stanley Cup Finals.|$|E
5|$|Going into Wimbledon, Murray had {{not lost}} a match on grass since the {{previous}} year's final, {{and was on}} a winning streak of 11 matches on grass. In the first two rounds, Murray faced Benjamin Becker and Yen-hsun Lu respectively, defeating both in straight sets. His third round match was against 32nd seed Tommy Robredo, and despite a tour comeback over the past year, Murray overcame the Spaniard in straight sets {{to set up a}} clash with Mikhail Youzhny, the highest seed left in Murray's half following the unexpectedly early exits of Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal. Despite facing a fightback in the second set, Murray won in straight sets to make it through to his tenth consecutive Grand Slam quarterfinal, in which he was to play Fernando Verdasco, the first left-handed player Murray had faced since the 2012 US Open. For the seventh time in his career, Murray had <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> a deficit of two sets to ultimately come through in five, setting up a semifinal clash with 24th seed Jerzy Janowicz, the Polish player who beat Murray in their previous encounter. After Murray failed to break Janowicz's serve, the Pole took the opening set in the tiebreak, following a double fault from Murray. However Murray managed to up his level of play, and won the next three sets, making it through to his second consecutive Wimbledon final, and third consecutive major final against Novak Djokovic.|$|E

5|$|On 24 April, Buffon saved a late penalty from Nikola Kalinić {{to secure}} a 2–1 away victory over Fiorentina, his 13th penalty save in Serie A; {{following}} Napoli's defeat against Roma the following day, Juventus clinched their record fifth consecutive Serie A title with three games at hand. In addition to his decisive saves and record breaking unbeaten streak, Buffon was praised for his leadership, and his role in motivating the team following their defeat against Sassuolo on 28 October 2015, as Juventus subsequently went on a 25-match unbeaten streak <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> 12th place after ten matches to win the title. For his key performances in helping Juventus capture the league title, Buffon was named the Juventus Player of the Month for April 2016. On 11 May, Buffon extended his contract {{until the end of}} the 2017–18 season. Throughout the 2015–16 season, Buffon had managed to equal his personal best of 21 clean sheets in a single league season, and was voted Juventus' Player of the Season.|$|E
5|$|During the 2015–16 season, James {{was criticized}} {{for his role in}} several off-court controversies, {{including}} the midseason firing of Cavaliers' head coach David Blatt. Despite these distractions, Cleveland finished the year with 57 wins and {{the best record in the}} East. James' final averages were 25.3 points, 7.4 rebounds, and 6.8 assists per game on 52 percent shooting. In the playoffs, the Cavaliers advanced comfortably to the Finals, losing only two games en route to a rematch with the Warriors, who were coming off a record-setting 73 win season. To begin the series, Cleveland fell behind 3–1, including two blowout losses. James responded by registering back-to-back 41 point games in Games 5 and 6, leading the Cavaliers to two consecutive wins to stave off elimination. In Game 7, he posted a triple-double and made a number of key plays, including a memorable chase-down block on Andre Iguodala in the final two minutes, as Cleveland emerged victorious, winning the city's first professional sports title in 52 years and becoming the first team in NBA history <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> a 3–1 series deficit in the Finals. James became just the third player to record a triple-double in an NBA Finals Game 7, and behind series averages of 29.7 points, 11.3 rebounds, 8.9 assists, 2.3 blocks, and 2.6 steals per game, he also became the first player in league history to lead both teams in all five statistical categories for a playoff round, culminating in a unanimous Finals MVP selection.|$|E
25|$|In {{association}} football, {{the crowd}} is very passionate and often sing throughout the whole match. Some occasions where the crowd noise is extra loud can be before kickoff; during the buildup to and scoring of a goal; when encouraging the team <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> defeat; to discourage an opposition penalty taker; or to harass a referee giving a free kick to the opposition team.|$|E

25|$|In the postseason, the Warriors {{beat the}} Houston Rockets 4–1 {{in the first}} round of the playoffs, the Portland Trail Blazers 4–1 in the Western Conference Semi-finals and they won the Western Conference Championship by beating the Oklahoma City Thunder 4–3, {{becoming}} just the 10th team <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> a 1–3 deficit. The Warriors played the Cleveland Cavaliers in the NBA Finals for the second consecutive year, where they lost in seven games and became the first team in NBA history to give up a 3–1 lead in the Finals.|$|E
25|$|Using a 3–4–3, the midfielders are {{expected}} to split their time between attacking and defending. Having only three dedicated defenders means that if the opposing team breaks through the midfield, {{they will have a}} greater chance to score than with a more conventional defensive configuration, such as 4–5–1 or 4–4–2. However, the three forwards allow for a greater concentration on attack. This formation is used by more offensive-minded teams. The formation was famously used by Liverpool under Rafael Benítez {{during the second half of}} the 2005 UEFA Champions League Final <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> a three-goal deficit.|$|E

He asks Oedipus <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> Colonus to bless his son, Eteocles. Angry that his son did not love him enough to take care of him, he curses both Eteocles and his brother, condemning them both to kill each other in battle.

25|$|Pitching {{continued}} to be problematic for the Cardinals in August. Mark Mulder, attempting <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> his shoulder injury, made two starts {{towards the end of}} the month, got hit very hard both times, and return to the disabled list, where he would stay for the rest of the season. He ended the worst year of his career with a 7.14 ERA. Jason Marquis' miserable year got even worse, with a 6.75 ERA for August. New acquisition Jeff Weaver followed up his 6.46 July with a 5.67 August. Closer Jason Isringhausen also struggled, blowing two saves, taking three losses and posting a 5.06 ERA for the month.|$|E

25|$|However, {{there were}} some {{brighter}} moments: on 7 February 1891 an Ireland team featuring Jack Reynolds and four-goal hero Olphert Stanfield defeated Wales 7–2, providing Ireland with their second win. Reynolds international performances attracted the interest of West Bromwich Albion who signed him in March 1891, however it was later discovered that Reynolds was actually English. On 3 March 1894 at the Solitude Ground in Belfast, after thirteen attempts Ireland finally avoided defeat to England, the team that included Fred Spiksley and Reynolds, who had since switched allegiances, Ireland gained a 2–2 draw. Goals from Stanfield and W.K. Gibson inspired Ireland <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> 2–0 down to gain a 2–2 draw.|$|E
25|$|In {{his second}} spell with Real Madrid, Capello {{implemented}} a 4–2–3–1 formation, which {{made use of}} two defensive-minded full-backs, two defensive midfielders, and two wingers who also often tracked back; however, as a result, the club's main striker, Ruud van Nistelrooy, was often isolated, while the team's efficient playing style was described as being boring in the media, and Capello was frequently derided for his overly defensive tactics. Despite the criticism he endured, Capello made several bold decisions which allowed several talented players to co-exist, benching Ronaldo, and reinstating David Beckham into the starting line-up, {{and was able to}} create an organised and unified team environment through his disciplined approach; he ultimately led the club to an eight match unbeaten streak <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> behind and claim the Liga title, although he was sacked {{at the end of the}} season.|$|E
25|$|The {{ultimate}} {{fate of the}} Polish Legions in Italy {{was different}} from that promised by Wybicki's song. Rather than coming back to Poland, they were exploited by the French government to quell uprisings in Italy, Germany and, later, in Haiti where they were decimated by war and disease. Polish national hopes were revived with the outbreak of a Franco-Prussian war (part of the War of the Fourth Coalition) in 1806. Napoleon called Dąbrowski and Wybicki <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> Italy and help gather support for the French army in Polish-populated parts of Prussia. On 6 November 1806, both generals arrived in Poznań, enthusiastically greeted by locals singing Poland Is Not Yet Lost. The ensuing Greater Poland Uprising and Napoleon's victory over Russian forces at Friedland {{led to the creation}} of a French-controlled Polish puppet state known as the Duchy of Warsaw.|$|E
