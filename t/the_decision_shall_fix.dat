The term polymer was further defined in the 7 th amendment (92 / 32 /EEC) of the Directive. This change means that some substances which {{were considered to be}} polymers under the reporting rules when the European Inventory of Existing Commercial Chemical Substances (EINECS) was being established are no longer considered to be polymers under the 7 th amendment. Polymers were not reportable for EINECS. As all substances which are not present in the EINECS inventory are notifiable, all "no-longer polymers" should in theory be notified. However, at the time when the 7 th amendment was adopted, the Council of Ministers made it clear that these no-longer polymers should not, retrospectively, become subject to notification. To facilitate the work of national Competent Authorities and the industry the Commission was requested to draw up a list of no-longer polymers. Substances to be included in this list have been on the EU market between September 18, 1981, and October 31, 1993 and satisfy the requirement that they were considered to be polymers under the reporting rules for EINECS but are no longer considered to be polymers under the 7 th amendment. Therefore to create the no-longer polymer list industry was asked to submit their candidates. The attached list is based on these submissions. The list is not an exhaustive list. The Competent Authorities are the responsible bodies, who shall decide whether a substance is a no-longer polymer or not but as a basis, they have decided that all the substances included in the attached list are to be regarded as no-longer polymers.

40|$|AbstractIn {{the frame}} of the European {{research}} project Local 4 Global, urban traffic control is one of the demonstrative use cases of a developed decentralized control method based on the Technical System of Systems (TSoS) concept and using machine learning capabilities. TSoS concept consists of dividing the system to semiautonomous elementary systems, called constituent systems, which shall enjoy to a major extent a local decision possibility. A remaining part of <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>shall</b> be made after exchanging information between all participating systems to learn from each other and improve the overall performance. In the traffic context, two basic classes of constituent systems are suggested: dynamically signalized traffic junctions and connected vehicles with speed control capabilities. Both traffic signals and vehicle speed controls receive a correction from the L 4 GCAO global optimizer in a bigger and common control cycle, namely each day. This paper describes the methodology and the results of a VISSIM microscopic traffic simulation of a road section situated near Munich. For the strategy evaluation, the results in terms of the performance index, waiting time per link, coordination proportion, mean network speed and travel time are compared to a baseline. This is during off peak demand a currently running fixed green wave signalization and during rush hour demand on the evening time of day signalization, having additional both demands combined with a speed recommendation with corrections. First results show that during rush hour the overall performance is improved compared to the initial scenario, nevertheless in low demands opposite situation is observed. A general advantage of such method is that it is easily scalable and transposable to other portions of the network. Since machine learning capabilities are introduced, algorithms are self-adaptive to yearly and seasonally varying demand and no important human involvement is needed. An outlook is given, how to transfer the strategy to the real road and test it in a field test...|$|R
40|$|During {{switching}} of disconnectors (DS) in GIS a varying {{number of}} pre-strikes and re-strikes occur. Due {{to the very}} short duration of the voltage collapse, traveling surges are generated in the busbar duct. These very fast transient overvoltages (VFTO) can become the limiting dielectric stress which defines the dimensions at UHV voltage levels. <b>The</b> <b>decision</b> <b>shall</b> {{be based on the}} maximum VFTO peak value that occurs with reference to the rated lightning impulse withstand voltage (LIWV) of the equipment. If the maximum VFTO is higher than the LIWV, it is necessary to consider the VFTO level as dimensioning criteria or to suppress VFTO by suitable measures. The main challenges are the reduction in VFTO amplitudes and finally the reduction of the effects of VFTO on the equipment. For the different sources of VFTO and for the different equipment different mitigation methods are known. The damping of VFTO by integration of a damping resistor is a well proven technology. The way to overcome the drawback of such unwieldy designs is to use other internal damping measures. Several methods have been proposed and examined in the past, such as ferrite material or high frequency (RF) resonators. The VFTO damping solution utilizing ferrite rings has been analysed and tested and will be described here. The measurements show that a damping effect can be achieved, but with an important drawback: the magnetic material goes easily into saturation, which complicates the design and reduces its general applicability and robustness. A new approach for damping is to implement compact electromagnetic high-frequency resonators with low quality factor specially designed to cover a wider frequency range. The novelty of this idea is not only to design the resonators but also to dissipate the VFTO energy. The VFTO damping effect of the developed RF resonator tuned to the dominant harmonic component was confirmed by experiments. Rings of a nanocrystalline alloy placed around the GIS conductor were also investigated. Depending on number, material and size of the rings a good mitigation could be achieved...|$|R
