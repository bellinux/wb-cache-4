5|$|On 21 September 2005 in the League Cup second round, Rehman scored {{his only}} goal for Fulham, opening a 5–4 extra-time win over Lincoln City at Craven Cottage by heading in Heiðar Helguson's cross. In January 2006 he signed for Championship club Norwich City on loan {{for the rest}} of the season as {{defensive}} cover for the club. He made five starts for them. Having made 30 appearances in all competitions for Fulham, 26 from the starting line-up and four as a substitute, Rehman had to consider his options if he was to get regular football. Although he had two years remaining on his contract, he wanted to play regular first team football, and as a result, he decided <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> two seasons getting as much experience as possible.|$|E

5|$|Galvis {{was born}} in Punto Fijo, Falcón, Venezuela, and played Little League Baseball {{including}} the Little League World Series there before being discovered {{by one of the}} Phillies' scouts in the area. At age 16, he signed a contract with the Phillies despite not receiving much attention from scouts. He went on <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> several years in their minor league system, including a particularly lengthy stint with the Reading Phillies, the Phillies' Double-A (AA) affiliate. In 2012, he made his major league debut on opening day at second base, substituting for the injured Chase Utley. He became a fan favorite for his performance early in the season, especially on defense, until he sustained an injury, and subsequently was suspended 50 games after a positive test for performance-enhancing drugs. He missed the remainder of the season. Over {{the course of the next}} two seasons, he split time between the Lehigh Valley IronPigs – the Phillies' Triple-A affiliate – and the major league ball club, but struggled to establish himself offensively. Entering 2015, his future with the club was uncertain, though with the departure of Jimmy Rollins he was a candidate to be the team's starting shortstop.|$|E
5|$|The Austrian {{imperial}} refugees eventually {{settled in}} Quebec, {{which had the}} advantage of being French-speaking (the younger children were not yet fluent in English). As they were cut off from all European funds, finances were more stretched than ever. At one stage, Zita was reduced to making salad and spinach dishes from dandelion leaves. However, all her sons were active in the war effort. Otto promoted the dynasty's role in a post-war Europe and met regularly with Franklin Roosevelt; Robert was the Habsburg representative in London; Carl Ludwig and Felix joined the United States Army, serving with several American-raised relatives of the Mauerer line; Rudolf smuggled himself into Austria {{in the final days of}} the war to help organise the resistance. In 1945 Empress Zita celebrated her birthday on the first day of peace, 9 May. She was <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> two years touring the United States and Canada to raise funds for war-ravaged Austria and Hungary.|$|E
5|$|Employment {{in public}} {{transport}} aviation {{was difficult to}} find in 1931, but Koch was able to continue flying with the Citizen Air Force at No. 1 Squadron, Laverton. He flew as second pilot without pay for Australian National Airways in 1931, to gain experience, and was lucky not to be aboard the ill-fated Southern Cloud, when family commitments prevented him taking his position. In mid-1933 he was appointed instructor with the Australian Aero Club, based at Essendon Aerodrome. In November 1933, he was recruited by Guinea Airways as an aircraft captain, and was <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> five years in Papua and New Guinea. He flew the Junkers W 34, the Junkers G 31, and the Ford Tri-Motor during this time, gaining much experience with sea operations when the W34 was float equipped. He gained some fame from his efforts to deliver supplies to the second (1936–37) Archbold Expedition. The expedition had become isolated when its own aircraft was accidentally destroyed in Port Moresby harbour, and {{was thought to be}} camped in the Blucher Mountains near the headwaters of the Strickland River, low on supplies and without fuel for its generators. Koch, operating out of Mt Hagen in a Ford fitted with long range tanks, found the party and resupplied it by parachute with food and gasoline. Among his many photographs taken during this period are several of the last known days of Amelia Earhart at Lae aerodrome. He married Clarice Grant on 1 June 1933, in Melbourne; the couple were to have a daughter and two sons.|$|E
5000|$|Maud {{is asked}} in obscure terms {{by her father}} if she is willing to undergo some kind of [...] "ordeal" [...] to clear {{the name of her}} uncle, and of the family more generally; shortly after she assents, he dies. At the reading of his will, it emerges that her father added a codicil to it: Maud is to stay with Uncle Silas until she comes of age; if she dies whilst still a minor, the estate will pass to Silas. Lady Knollys, {{together}} with Austin's executor and fellow Swedenborgian, Dr. Bryerly, attempt in vain to overturn the codicil, realizing its many dangerous implications for the young heiress; despite their efforts, Maud consents willingly <b>to</b> <b>spending</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> {{three and a half years}} at her uncle's mansion at Bartram-Haugh.|$|R
50|$|The {{beginning}} {{of the story is}} lost, but is implied that an unnamed man had <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> night <b>next</b> <b>to</b> a tomb in the Theban Necropolis, only to be awakened by a ghost residing in it.

25|$|At this point, {{the local}} {{gendarmerie}} arrived and arrested Mitchell. He {{was confined to}} jail {{for a few days}} and later fined by the local magistrate, as bare-knuckle boxing was illegal in France at that time. Swathed in bandages, Sullivan was helped to evade the law and taken across the English Channel <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> few weeks convalescing in Liverpool.|$|E
50|$|The Revolution of 1848 forced Rubinstein back <b>to</b> Russia. <b>Spending</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> {{five years}} mainly in Saint Petersburg, Rubinstein taught, gave concerts and {{performed}} frequently at the Imperial court. The Grand Duchess Elena Pavlovna, sister-in-law to Tsar Nicholas I, became his most devoted patroness. By 1852, {{he had become}} a leading figure in Saint Petersburg's musical life, performing as a soloist and collaborating with some of the outstanding instrumentalists and vocalists who came to the Russian capital.|$|R

It was also during this time that he lost sight in his right eye.|$|E
25|$|At lunch, Pickett {{approached}} Bradman {{and asked}} for a photograph. Bradman agreed to help out as long as {{he did not have to}} put his pads back on.

25|$|A {{few days}} later Lindbergh took his first formal flying lesson in that same machine, though he was never {{permitted}} to solo {{because he could not}} afford to post the requisite damage bond.

50|$|Pilcher first held {{political}} office in 1891 {{when he was}} elected as a Democrat to represent Fauquier County in the Virginia House of Delegates.

25|$|Thomas A. Edison {{had invented}} the {{phonograph}} in 1877. But the fame bestowed on Edison for this invention (sometimes called his most original) was {{not due to}} its quality. Recording with his tinfoil phonograph was too difficult to be practical, as the tinfoil tore easily, and even when the stylus was properly adjusted, its reproduction of sound was distorted and squeaky, and good {{for only a few}} playbacks; nevertheless Edison had discovered the secret of sound recording. However he did not work to improve its quality, likely because of an agreement <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> five years developing the New York City electric light and power system.|$|E
25|$|Tobin {{immediately}} started graduate studies, also at Harvard, earning his M.A. degree in 1940.

In 1947 Tobin was elected a Junior Fellow of Harvard's Society of Fellows, which allowed him the freedom and funding <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> three years studying and doing research.|$|E
25|$|After {{his return}} to his {{canonical}} community, however, he was subjected to two years of hostility and abuse by his fellow canons, even by some accounts a case of attempted poisoning. He chose not to confront his abbot with the situation and accepted this persecution patiently. The care of local parishes in that region of France was routinely entrusted to the many abbeys and priories of canons. In 1597, when his abbot was assigning him a post, Fourier passed over two prestigious options and accepted the post of vicar of the parish of Mattaincourt in order to combat the indifference to religion widespread in the town, and to counter nascent Calvinism in the area. He went on <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> twenty {{years of his life}} serving its people.|$|E

He managed to elope with her back to his home land. But the girl's father traced their {{location}} and followed them to take her back. Knowing his arrival the lovers decided to leave the place and started off to Tamil Nadu via Aryankavu route in a single bullock ridden cart.
