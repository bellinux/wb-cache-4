25|$|The first MIPS IV {{implementation}} was the MIPS Technologies R8000 microprocessor chipset (1994). The {{design of}} the R8000 began at Silicon Graphics, Inc. {{and it was only}} used in high-end workstations and servers for scientific and technical applications where high performance on large floating-point workloads was important. Later implementations were the MIPS Technologies R10000 (1996) and the Quantum Effect Devices R5000 (1996) and RM7000 (1998). The R10000, fabricated and sold by NEC Electronics and Toshiba, and its derivatives were used by NEC, Pyramid Technology, Silicon Graphics, Inc., and <b>Tandem</b> <b>Computers</b> (among others) in workstations, servers, and supercomputers. The R5000 and R7000 found use in high-end embedded systems, personal computers, and low-end workstations and servers. A derivative of the R5000 from Toshiba, the R5900, was used in Sony Computer Entertainment's Emotion Engine, which powered its Playstation 2 game console.|$|E
25|$|As of April 2017, MIPS {{processors}} {{are used}} in embedded systems such as residential gateways and routers. Originally, MIPS was designed for general-purpose computing, and during the 1980s and 1990s, MIPS processors for personal, workstation, and server computers were used by many companies such as Digital Equipment Corporation, MIPS Computer Systems, NEC, Pyramid Technology, SiCortex, Siemens Nixdorf, Silicon Graphics, and <b>Tandem</b> <b>Computers.</b> Historically, video game consoles such as the Nintendo 64, Sony PlayStation, PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable use MIPS processors. MIPS processors also used to be popular in supercomputers during the 1990s, but all such systems have dropped off the TOP500 list. These uses were complemented by embedded applications at first, but during the 1990s, MIPS became a major presence in the embedded processor market, and by the 2000s, most MIPS processors were for these applications. In the mid- to late-1990s, {{it was estimated that}} one in three RISC microprocessors produced was a MIPS processor.|$|E

40|$|NonStop SQL is an {{implementation}} of ANSI SQL on <b>Tandem</b> <b>Computer</b> Systems. It provides distributed data and distributed execution.

The combination of SQL semantics and a message-based distributed operating system gives a surprising result: the message savings of a relational interface pay for the extra semantics of the SQL language when compared to record-at-a-time interfaces.

Much of the system was based on Sybase's DB-Library system, with the Sybase-specific sections removed and several additions to support other platforms. DB-Library was aided by an industry-wide move from library systems that were tightly linked to a specific language, to library systems that were provided by the operating system and required the languages on that platform to conform to its standards. This meant that a single library could be used with (potentially) any programming language on a given platform.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: <b>Tandem</b> <b>computer</b> {{systems are}} {{designed}} to be single-fault tolerant. This paper takes a census of customer system outages reported to Tandem. The census shows a clear improvement in the reliability of hardware and maintenance. It indicates that now (1989) software is the majority source of reported system outages (62 %), followed by system operations (15 %). This is a dramatic shift from the statistics in 1985. Even discounting systematic under-reporting of operations and environmental outages, the conclusion is clear: hardware faults and hardware maintenance are no longer a major source of outages. As the other components of the system become increasingly reliable, software necessarily becomes the dominant cause of outages. Achieving higher-availability will require improvements in software quality, and software-fault tolerance, and will require simpler operations, and operations-fault tolerance. Table of Content...|$|R

40|$|Compaq Computer, {{based in}} Houston, Texas, is the world’s largest {{personal}} computer manufacturer {{and the fourth}} largest information technology (IT) company. From 1992 - 1997, the company’s aggressive high volume PC strategy propelled it to high growth rates in revenues, while its leadership in PC servers sustained strong margins and drove profit growth. Starting in 1995, former CEO Eckhard Pfieffer began to transform Compaq from a pure PC company to a full-service IT company that could compete {{with the likes of}} IBM and Hewlett-Packard. The key strategic moves were the acquisitions of <b>Tandem</b> <b>Computer</b> and Digital Equipment Corporation in 1997 and 1998, giving Compaq a diverse line of technologies and service capabilities. Compaq stumbled badly in 1998 as it faced new challenges in the PC market and tried to assimilate Tandem and Digital.

At the {{hardware}} level, {{the system is}} designed as a loosely coupled multi-processor with fail-fast modules connected via dual paths. It is designed for online diagnosis and maintenance. A range of CPUs may be inter-connected via a hierarchical fault-tolerant local network. A variety of peripherals needed for online transaction processing are attached via dual ported controllers. A novel disc subsystem allows a choice between low cost-per-megabyte and low cost-per-access. System software provides processes and messages as the basic structuring mechanism. Processes provide software modularity and fault isolation. Process pairs tolerate hardware and transient software failures. Applications are structured as requesting processes making remote procedure calls to server processes. Process server classes utilize multi-processors. The resulting process abstractions provide a distributed system which can utilize thousands of processors. High-level networking protocols such as SNA, OSI, and a proprietary network are built atop this base. A relational database provides distributed data and distributed transactions. An application generator allows users to develop fault-tolerant applications as though the system were a conventional computer. The resulting system has price/performance competitive with conventional systems...|$|R

50|$|The {{exterior}} {{part of the}} huts {{is given}} an ancient appearance whereas the interior of each hut has rectangular space (for housing permanent and temporary exhibitions, administration offices and studio spaces), where all amenities feature modern technology. The space within each hut was achieved by discarding the central pillar, a deviation from the traditional Kanak hut design. In the circular design of the hut’s shells, the height to diameter ratio was reduced giving more space, which also resulted in greater dynamic ventilation, as was corroborated by wind tunnel tests. The cases have giant curved ribs or staves, which are made of iroko slats and steel connections and which also act as climate control devices. The outer ribs are a curved assembly of slats, which are joined to a straight vertical rib that together form part of the case structure. The staves are designed {{in such a way}} that the individual pieces appear as if they are woven together. The roof is made of corrugated aluminium sheets. It has a double roof system, which contributes to the play of shadows. The bottom of the wall, formed by the arc of the staves, has special louvers, called nacos. The nacos open and close in <b>tandem</b> automatically by <b>computer</b> control calibrated to the speed of the wind. The double roof system also allows air to pass through the roof unchecked. During the monsoon season, the winds that blow over the cases are very strong, the compound curve of the cases resists the wind, with the nacos facilitating this action further by allowing air to pass directly through the cases.|$|R
