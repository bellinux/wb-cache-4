5|$|Reactions to the {{extension}} between SR125 and SR67 were mixed. There were reports of faster transportation through the East County area, yet commuters noted a rush hour backup at SR125 headed westbound because <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> lanes traveling west through the interchange. Traffic along Mission Gorge Road {{was reported to}} have decreased by 20percent.|$|E
5|$|<b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> minor accidents: a {{car that}} {{collided}} with the locomotive whilst driving through the hospital grounds, and a wagon whose brakes failed whilst stabled at Farm Siding, which rolled down the line to Hellingly station.|$|E
5|$|<b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> other MLs in the vicinity: ML 160 had {{continued}} past {{the dock and}} was engaging targets upriver, ML 269 appeared {{to be out of}} control and was running in circles.|$|E

5|$|Monsen and Larssen both left Demokraten in 1916. The next editors were Paul O. Løkke, {{who served}} from 1916 to 1919, and Alfred Aakermann, from 1919 to 1920. Larssen {{returned}} in 1920 as editor-in-chief. Georg Svendsen was the subeditor from 1918 until 1921, when Evald O. Solbakken {{started in the}} newspaper as subeditor. Still, <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> people to deliver the editorial content.|$|E
5|$|The {{differences}} between tantalum and niobium were unequivocally demonstrated in 1864 by Christian Wilhelm Blomstrand and Henri Etienne Sainte-Claire Deville, {{as well as}} Louis J. Troost, who determined the formulas {{of some of the}} compounds in 1865 and finally by Swiss chemist Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac in 1866, who all proved that <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> elements. Articles on ilmenium continued to appear until 1871.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} scribes were disputed in the past. According to Kenyon's opinion {{there were five}} scribes, two scribes in the Old Testament (I and II) and three in the New (III, IV, and V). Subsequently, Skeat and Milne argued <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> or {{possibly}} three scribes. Present scholars agreed in that case (Metzger, Aland, Hernández, Jongkind).|$|E

5|$|After Charles II was {{restored}} to the throne in 1660, he began a wide-ranging programme of work on the coastal defences. The Dutch fleet then attacked up the Thames in June 1667, but were deterred from going further for fear of the Tilbury and Gravesend fortifications. In reality, the forts were poorly prepared to resist a Dutch attack; at Tilbury <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> guns ready for action. The Dutch struck the English fleet at Medway instead, giving enough time {{for the government to}} improve the defences along the Thames and mount 80 guns on the forts. In the wake of the conflict, the King instructed his Chief Engineer, a Dutchman called Sir Bernard de Gomme, to develop Tilbury Fort's defences further.|$|E
5|$|After Ealdred's death, {{one of the}} {{restraints}} on William's treatment of the English was removed. Ealdred {{was one of a}} few native Englishmen who William appears to have trusted, and his death led to fewer attempts to integrate Englishmen into the administration, although such efforts did not entirely stop. In 1070, a church council was held at Westminster and a number of bishops were deposed. By 1073 <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> Englishmen in episcopal sees, and by the time of William's death in 1089, there was only one, Wulfstan II of Worcester.|$|E
5|$|Cedar Fair, the park's owner, {{acquired}} Knott's Berry Farm—the first {{park with}} a Halloween Haunt—in 1997, and implemented the event throughout the chain, starting with Cedar Point. At its debut, <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> haunt attractions, Eerie Manor and Cedar Point Cemetery. Guests could travel on the Cedar Point Spooky Express through haunted lagoons and graveyards. The first new attraction, Toxic Tunnel of Terror, {{was introduced in}} 1998. Camp Spooky debuted a year later with children's activities in Camp Snoopy. In 2000, Cedar Point Cemetery was re-themed into Pharaoh's Secret. The park added three attractions in 2001, Eerie Manor was re-themed into Undertaker U., and Fright Zone and Magical House on Boo Hill were added.|$|E

Both {{were recruited}} through FIFA's Spirit of Soccer program and worked to bring the game to areas with land mines. In 2008, the Mine Risk Education Soccer tournament was held and several girls under-14 teams participated. The first women's national championship was held in 2010. Rights to broadcast the 2011 Women's World Cup in the country were bought by the Cambodian Broadcasting Service. By 2012, between Battambang or Phnom Penh, there were 400 girls playing in organised clubs.|$|E
5|$|In the 2013/14 season, Prevc {{recorded}} his first individual World Cup win in Kulm. With a second {{place at the}} same venue, Prevc won the season's ski flying title since <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> scheduled ski flying events in the season. He went on to win in Sapporo which brought him {{to the top of the}} World Cup overall standings for the first time in his career, where he remained for the next couple of events. At the end of the season, he finished 2nd in the overall rankings, after Kamil Stoch of Poland. Prevc also won the last world cup event of the season in Planica, accumulating three wins and eleven podiums in total which was his most successful season until then.|$|E
5|$|Many former {{adherents of}} the Fasci left Sicily. Life had grown hard and {{employment}} {{difficult to find}} because of their involvement with the movement. For those in Sicily who wanted to change their life for the better in those days, <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> alternatives: rebel or emigrate. After {{the failure of the}} rebellion many peasants {{had no choice but to}} vote with their feet and opted for emigration. Others remained, and a year later, in 1895, protests against unjust taxes and about the issue of communal land resumed in many towns in Sicily. The disbandment of troop had to be postponed.|$|E

5|$|On January 8, 2009, Bradley {{signed a}} three-year, $30 million {{deal with the}} Chicago Cubs. He was issued a two-game {{suspension}} for supposedly making contact with umpire Larry Vanover while arguing a strike call on April 16, which was reduced to one game on appeal. During an interleague game against the Minnesota Twins on June 12, he caught a routine fly in right field and threw it into the stands, believing {{it was the third}} out of the inning when <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> outs. The umpire allowed each of the Twins' baserunners to advance two bases as a result.|$|E
5|$|On Twomile Run {{above the}} acid mine drainage, {{a total of}} 19 macroinvertebrate taxa {{including}} 5 members of the orders Ephemeroptera and Plecoptera were observed in 1998. Below the acid mine drainage, <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> taxa, neither of which belonged to Ephemeroptera or Plecoptera. Above the acid mine drainage on Middle Branch, ten macroinvertebrate taxa were observed, of which five belonged to Ephemeroptera or Plecoptera. Below the acid mine drainage, there were two taxa, neither of which belonged to Ephemeroptera or Plecoptera. In 1999, the macroinvertebrate density ranged from 197 to 1916 individuals per square meter. The concentration of fecal coliform in the water at Cross Fork is 2000 individuals per liter and the concentration of fecal streptococcus is 2400 individuals per liter.|$|E
5|$|Sometime in the Carboniferous Period, some 350 {{million years}} ago, when <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> major land masses, insects began flying. How and why insect wings developed, however, {{is not well}} understood, {{largely due to the}} {{scarcity}} of appropriate fossils from the period of their development in the Lower Carboniferous. Three main theories on the origins of insect flight are that wings developed from paranotal lobes, extensions of the thoracic terga; that they are modifications of movable abdominal gills as found on aquatic naiads of mayflies; or that they developed from thoracic protrusions used as radiators.|$|E

5|$|The Northwest Territory {{was formed}} by the Congress of the Confederation on July 13, 1787, and {{included}} all land between the Appalachian Mountains, the Mississippi River, the Great Lakes and the Ohio River. This single territory became the states of Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, and part of eastern Minnesota. The act established an administration to oversee the territory and had the land surveyed in accordance with The Land Ordinance of 1785. At the time the territory was created, <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> American settlements in what would become Indiana: Vincennes and Clark's Grant. The population of the northwest included fewer than 5,000 Europeans. The Native American population {{was estimated to be}} near 20,000, but may have been as high as 75,000.|$|E
5|$|The {{activity}} in the first twomonths of the season were limited in tropical cyclogenesis, with the second tropical depression of the season not developing until July 22. Following that, the season was very active, {{and there was a}} quick succession of tropical cyclone development from late-July to mid-August. The Atlantic briefly remained dormant, and activity resumed on August 24 with the development of Tropical Depression Eight (Hurricane Gustav). Although August was a very active month, <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> named storms in September, both of which became hurricanes. Activity in October was high then average, with five tropical cyclones to either form or exist in the month. Following an active October, no tropical cyclogenesis occurred in the final month of the season, which is November.|$|E
5|$|The {{first thing}} {{he had to do}} was {{determine}} the characteristics of the aircraft that would be used. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> Allied aircraft large enough: the British Avro Lancaster and the US Boeing B-29 Superfortress. The United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) wanted to use the B-29 if at all possible, even though it required substantial modification. Ramsey supervised the test drop program, which began at Dahlgren, Virginia, in August 1943, before moving to Muroc Dry Lake, California, in March 1944. Mock ups of Thin Man and Fat Man bombs were dropped and tracked by an SCR-584 ground based radar set of the kind that Ramsey had helped develop at the Radiation laboratory. Numerous problems were discovered with the bombs and the aircraft modifications, and corrected.|$|E
