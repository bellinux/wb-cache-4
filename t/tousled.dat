25|$|The 1903 life-size {{portrait}} bust of Dr. David Thomas Iglehart can {{be found}} at Symphony Square in Austin, where it is on permanent loan to the Austin Symphony Society. Possibly the last known work by Ney, that of a <b>tousled</b> haired cherub resting over a grave and known as the 1906 Schnerr Memorial, {{can be found}} at Der Stadt Friedhof in Fredericksburg, Texas.|$|E
25|$|A daring new fashion arose {{for having}} one's {{portrait}} painted in undress, wearing a loosely fastened gown called a nightgown over a voluminous chemise, with <b>tousled</b> curls. The style is epitomized by the portraits of Peter Lely, which {{derive from the}} romanticized style originated by Anthony van Dyck in the 1630s. The clothing in these portraits is not representative of what was worn {{on the street or}} at court.|$|E
25|$|The {{result of}} such an {{approach}} is to invest the sculptures with greater psychological energy. The viewer finds it easier to gauge the state of mind of the characters and therefore understands the larger story at work: Daphne's wide open mouth in fear and astonishment, David biting his lip in determined concentration, or Proserpina desperately struggling to free herself. In addition to portraying psychological realism, they show a greater concern for representing physical details. The <b>tousled</b> hair of Pluto, the pliant flesh of Proserpina, or the forest of leaves beginning to envelop Daphne all demonstrate Bernini's exactitude and delight for representing complex real world textures in marble form.|$|E
500|$|When {{the tour}} first started, people—especially women—thronged {{to see it}} wearing clothes {{inspired}} by Madonna. Debbi Voller, author of Madonna: The Style Book, observed that [...] "Hundreds of thousands of young girls came to the concert dressed like her, with bleached and <b>tousled</b> hair, see-through tops, bras, fingerless gloves and crucifixes. Magazines and TV shows ran lookalike competitions." [...] This frenzy regarding Madonna {{gave rise to a}} new term called Madonna wannabe—a word that was ultimately officially recognized by the Webster's Dictionary in May 1991. Madonna was mystified as to why all the women would want to copy her look. She commented, ...|$|E
500|$|In 2000, Ripley {{appeared}} in the British dogme film The Announcement, as well as playing lead female character Grace Bingley—opposite Paul Rhys—in the Granada television pilot I Saw You, which used {{many of the same}} production staff as Cold Feet. David Belcher of The Herald called Ripley [...] "perfectly scatty, <b>tousled</b> and self-sufficient" [...] in the role, and Joe Joseph of The Times complimented her comic timing. Ripley returned to I Saw You for a three-episode miniseries in 2002. She considers I Saw You, in which she acted alongside her husband Daniel Lapaine, the television show she is most proud to have worked on.|$|E
500|$|In her 2014 biography, Valerie Solanas, Breanne Fahs {{argues that}} it is {{unlikely}} that Solanas appeared at the Chelsea Hotel looking for Girodias. Fahs states that Girodias may have fabricated the account in order to boost sales of the SCUM Manifesto, which he had published. Fahs states that [...] "the more likely story ... places Valerie at the Actor's Studio at 432 West Forty-Fourth Street early that morning." [...] Actress Sylvia Miles states that Solanas appeared at the Actor's Studio looking for Lee Strasberg, asking to leave her play for him. Miles said that Solanas [...] "had a different look, a bit <b>tousled,</b> like somebody whose appearance is the last thing on her mind." [...] Miles told Solanas that Strasberg would not be in until the afternoon. Miles said that she accepted a copy of the play from Solanas and then [...] "... shut the door because I knew she was trouble. I didn't know what sort of trouble, but I knew she was trouble." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Group Captain [...] "Laddie" [...] Lucas, Beurling was [...] "untidy, with a {{shock of}} fair <b>tousled</b> hair above {{penetrating}} blue eyes. He smiled a lot and the smile came straight out of those striking eyes... he was highly strung, brash and outspoken... something of a rebel".|$|E
2500|$|The Berger Picard {{is a low}} {{maintenance}} dog. The rough, <b>tousled</b> coat can mat if not brushed {{on a regular basis}} (once every other week) but the coat does not require special care to yield its rustic appearance. Bathing is rarely done. Their fur should never be trimmed except possibly hand-stripping the ears. They do shed {{but not as much as}} other breeds. Picards have low oil content in their fur and therefore have little [...] "doggie odor".|$|E
2500|$|The Berger Picard is a medium-sized, {{well-muscled}} dog, {{slightly longer}} than tall with a <b>tousled</b> yet elegant appearance. Their ears are naturally erect, high-set and quite wide at the base. Their eyebrows are thick, {{but do not}} shield their dark frank eyes. They {{are known for their}} smile. Their natural tail normally reaches to the hock and is carried with a slight J-curve at the tip. Their weather-proof coat is harsh and crisp to the touch, not excessively long with a minimal undercoat. Coat colors fall into two colors, fawn and brindle with a range of shade variations.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the film}} Bad Teacher, Elizabeth (Cameron Diaz) wears a [...] "Little Orphan Annie's wig" [...] when, pretending {{she is a}} journalist, she meets the state {{professor}} {{who is in charge}} of creating and distributing the exams forms, to seduce and put him to sleep. Her short <b>tousled</b> girlish hair-cut, along with the strict tailor-suit she dons, enhances her air of hidden perversion and makes it easy for her (with the help of a big glass of chardonnay mixed with two roofies) to put the professor on his knees. The wig is afterward missing from the school props box, and was much sought, before being retrieved in Elizabeth's drawer.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the first}} {{physical}} descriptions of Kierkegaard comes from an attendee, Hans Brøchner, at his brother Peter's wedding party in 1836: [...] "I found [...] almost comical. He was then twenty-three years old; he had something quite irregular in his entire form and had a strange coiffure. His hair rose almost six inches above his forehead into a <b>tousled</b> crest that gave him a strange, bewildered look." [...] Another comes from Kierkegaard's niece, Henriette Lund (1829–1909). When Søren Kierkegaard {{was a little boy}} he [...] "was of slender and delicate appearance, and ran about in a little coat of red-cabbage color. He used to be called ‘fork’ by his father, because of his tendency, developed quite early, toward satirical remarks. Although a serious, almost austere tone pervaded the Kierkegaard’s house, I have the firm impression that there was a place for youthful vivacity too, even though of a more sedate and home-made kind than one is used to nowadays. The house was open for an 'old-fashioned hospitality'" [...] (1876).|$|E
2500|$|While on {{tour with}} L. du Garde's A Horse! A Horse!, Pinter {{found himself in}} Eastbourne without a place to stay. He met a {{stranger}} in a pub who said [...] "I can take you to some digs but I wouldn't recommend them exactly," [...] and then led Pinter to the house where he stayed. Pinter told his official biographer, Michael Billington, I went to these digs and found, in short, a very big woman who was the landlady and a little man, the landlord. There {{was no one else}} there, apart from a solitary lodger, and the digs were really quite filthy ... I slept in the attic with this man I'd met in the pub ... we shared the attic and there was a sofa over my bed ... propped up so I was looking at this sofa from which hairs and dust fell continuously. And I said to the man, [...] "What are you doing here?" [...] And he said, [...] "Oh well I used to be...I'm a pianist. I used to play in the concert-party here and I gave that up." ... The woman was really quite a voracious character, always <b>tousled</b> his head and tickled him and goosed him and wouldn't leave him alone at all. And when I asked him why he stayed, he said, [...] "There's nowhere else to go." ...|$|E
