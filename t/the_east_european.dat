He also sent Tintin to fictional countries of his own devising, such as the Latin American republic of San Theodoros, <b>the</b> <b>East</b> <b>European</b> kingdom of Syldavia, or the fascist state Borduria—whose leader, Müsstler, {{was a combination of}} Nazi German leader Adolf Hitler and Italian Fascist leader Benito Mussolini.|$|E
5|$|The Third World Congress in 1951 {{resolved}} {{that the}} economies of <b>the</b> <b>East</b> <b>European</b> states and their political regimes had come to resemble that of the USSR more and more. These states were then described as deformed workers states in an analogy with the degenerated workers state in Russia. The term deformed was used rather than degenerated, because no workers' revolution had led to the foundation of these states.|$|E
5|$|Jaruzelski's Poland {{depended}} on low-cost deliveries of industrial staple commodities from the Soviet Union and meaningful Polish reforms, economic or political, were not feasible during {{the rule of}} the last three conservative Soviet general secretaries. The perestroika and glasnost policies of the Soviet Union's new leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, were therefore a crucial factor in stimulating reform in Poland. Gorbachev essentially repudiated the Brezhnev Doctrine, which had stipulated that attempts by its Eastern European satellite states to abandon the communist bloc would be countered by the Soviet Union with force. The developments in the Soviet Union altered the international situation and provided a historical opportunity for independent reforms in Poland. The hardline stance of US President Ronald Reagan was also helpful. David Ost stressed the constructive influence of Gorbachev. With his support for Polish and Hungarian membership in the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund and for <b>the</b> <b>East</b> <b>European</b> pluralistic evolution in general, the Soviet leader effectively pushed East Europe toward the West.|$|E
5000|$|Although the Soviets carried most of {{the burden}} since 1976, <b>the</b> <b>East</b> <b>Europeans</b> had been persuaded {{to take part in}} {{projects}} to boost the developing countries' economies. <b>East</b> <b>European</b> countries imported Cuban nickel, and Mongolian molybdenum and copper. They were also pressed to buy staples, such as Cuban sugar (80% of Cuba's exports), at inflated prices. Eastern Europe also contributed to the International Investment Bank, from which the underdeveloped three could acquire loans at lower interest rates than <b>the</b> <b>East</b> <b>Europeans</b> themselves. <b>The</b> Soviets also sold their fuel and raw materials to Cuba, Vietnam, and Mongolia for less than it was sold to <b>the</b> six <b>East</b> <b>European</b> members. Hence, <b>the</b> former had become competitors for the slowly diminishing Soviet resources. In the late 1980s, the only benefit accruing to <b>the</b> <b>East</b> <b>Europeans</b> was <b>the</b> services provided by Vietnamese guest workers. However, the majority of the Vietnamese had worked primarily on the Friendship pipeline in the Soviet Union.|$|R

5|$|To give a {{sense of}} the dry and dusty {{environment}} of the Dust Bowl, smoke and dirt were constantly blown through tubes onto the set. The actors' clothes were ragged and drenched in dirt, and Carnivàle had approximately 5,000 people costumed in the show's first season alone. The creative team listened to 1930s' music and radio and read old Hollywood magazines to get the period's sound, language, and slang right. The art department had an extensive research library of old catalogs, among them an original 1934 Sears Catalog, which were purchased at flea markets and antique stores. <b>The</b> <b>East</b> <b>European</b> background of some characters and Asian themes in Brother Justin's story were incorporated into the show.

25|$|The {{geography}} of Russia describes the geographic features of Russia, a country extending {{over much of}} northern Eurasia. Comprising much of eastern Europe and northern Asia, it is the world's largest country in total area. Due to its size, Russia displays both monotony and diversity. As with its topography, its climates, vegetation, and soils span vast distances. From north to south <b>the</b> <b>East</b> <b>European</b> Plain is clad sequentially in tundra, coniferous forest (taiga), mixed and broadleaf forests, grassland (steppe), and semi-desert (fringing the Caspian Sea) as the changes in vegetation reflect the changes in climate. Siberia supports a similar sequence but is predominantly taiga. The country contains forty UNESCO biosphere reserves.|$|E
25|$|The Berkman {{assassination}} attempt undermined {{public support for}} the union and prompted the final collapse of the strike.

On August 12, the company announced that 1,700 men were working at the mill and production had resumed at full capacity. The national AFL refused to intervene, <b>the</b> <b>East</b> <b>European</b> workers ignored the union and it had no strategy left.

25|$|The {{geological}} {{history of}} Europe traces {{back to the}} formation of the Baltic Shield (Fennoscandia) and the Sarmatian craton, both around 2.25billion years ago, followed by the Volgo–Uralia shield, the three together leading to <b>the</b> <b>East</b> <b>European</b> craton (≈ Baltica) which became a part of the supercontinent Columbia. Around 1.1billion years ago, Baltica and Arctica (as part of the Laurentia block) became joined to Rodinia, later resplitting around 550million years ago to reform as Baltica. Around 440million years ago Euramerica was formed from Baltica and Laurentia; a further joining with Gondwana then leading {{to the formation of}} Pangea. Around 190million years ago, Gondwana and Laurasia split apart due to the widening of the Atlantic Ocean. Finally, and very soon afterwards, Laurasia itself split up again, into Laurentia (North America) and the Eurasian continent. The land connection between the two persisted for a considerable time, via Greenland, leading to interchange of animal species. From around 50million years ago, rising and falling sea levels have determined the actual shape of Europe, and its connections with continents such as Asia. Europe's present shape dates to the late Tertiary period about five million years ago.|$|E
25|$|The {{sharp decline}} in health care {{infrastructure}} in Russia {{and elsewhere in the}} former Soviet Union (FSU) and, to a lesser extent, in Eastern Europe—owing to economic difficulties—are causing a dramatic rise in infectious disease incidence. Death rates attributed to infectious diseases in the FSU increased 50% from 1990 to 1996, with TB accounting for a substantial number of such deaths. Access to health care ranges from 50–70% in most European FSU states, including Russia and Ukraine, and from 40–50% in FSU states located in Central Asia. WHO estimates are consistent, that only 50–80% of FSU citizens had regular access to essential drugs in 1997, as compared to more than 95% a decade earlier as health care budgets and government-provided health services were slashed. Health care access is better in Eastern Europe, particularly in more developed states such as Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary, where it ranges from 70 to 90%, while only 50-70% have access in countries such as Bulgaria and Romania. More than 95 percent of the population throughout <b>the</b> <b>East</b> <b>European</b> region had such access in 1987, according to WHO.|$|E
