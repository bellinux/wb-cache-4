If she had been {{speaking}} {{to one of her}} equals she would have known how <b>to</b> <b>dispose</b> <b>of</b> the <b>question</b> without directly answering it. But what could she say to the magnificent gentleman on the stately horse? He had only to send his servant into the village to ask who the young lady from London was staying with, and the answer, in a dozen mouths at least, would direct him to her aunt. She cast one appealing look at Moody and pronounced the distinguished name of Miss Pink.|$|R
60|$|A {{conversation}} like this, without attempting {{any thing}} like {{an answer to}} the question with which it commenced, is as satisfactory to the child, and perhaps as useful in developing its powers and increasing its knowledge of language, as any attempt to explain the phenomenon would be; and the knowledge of this will make it easy for the mother <b>to</b> <b>dispose</b> <b>of</b> many a <b>question</b> which might seriously interrupt her if she conceived it necessary either to attempt a satisfactory explanation of the difficulty, or not to answer it at all.|$|R
5000|$|The term [...] "dilatory motion" [...] {{does not}} always refer to an ill-intentioned motion. In Canada, [...] "dilatory" [...] motions refer to those [...] "designed <b>to</b> <b>dispose</b> <b>of</b> the {{original}} <b>question</b> before the House either {{for the time being}} or permanently," [...] and includes, for instance, motions to proceed to the orders of the day; postpone definitely; adjourn; and so on. Jeremy Bentham held that such types of dilatory motions are useful, stating, [...] "Precipitation may arise from two causes: from ignorance, when a judgment is formed without the collection of all the information required—from passion, when there is not the necessary calm for considering the question in all its aspects." ...|$|R
40|$|Although Self-Assembled Monolayers made of long {{chains of}} n-alkanethiols (CH 3 (CH 2) n- 1 SH) on Au(111) have been {{extensively}} {{studied in the}} past, the driving forces behind {{the appearance of the}} (3 x 2 ◊ 3) super lattice observed at full coverage are still not completely understood. In order to focus on the role played by the sulfur head group minimizing the interactions between chains and <b>to</b> <b>dispose</b> <b>of</b> the <b>question</b> <b>of</b> possible X-ray induced damage, we have carried out a He atom diffraction study of the adsorption of the shortest (n= 1) thiol radical, obtained by dissociative adsorption of (CH 3 S) 2, on the Au(111) surface. Contrary to what is currently reported in the literature, domains of 1 hexagonal (◊ 3 x ◊ 3) R 30 o structure are observed to convert into well ordered (3 x 2 ◊ 3) superstructure after annealing time of few hours. Observation of forbidden peaks by the (3 x 2 ◊ 3) model proposed by Fenter et al. suggests a distortion of the symmetry of the unit cell. Observed chemisorption and physisorption energies were in good agreement with the literature. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{searches}} for rational policy alternatives concerning circumscribed sectors of governmental activity {{it is sometimes}} difficult to reach satisfactory conclusions without expanding the "universe of discourse. " And, the broader the sector and/or the higher the level of government, {{the more likely it}} is that useful results will not be obtained without viewing at least some of the aspects of the problem of interest from a national or more general point of view. Thus, during the writer's involvement with apparently well delimited problems in the management of federal research and development programs, efforts to develop rationales for decisions about program priorities invariably resulted in need <b>to</b> <b>dispose</b> first <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> falling outside the terms of reference for the issues at hand. The concepts of an "evaluative function" and, specifically, of an "evaluative branch" of government, arose in the course of attempts to overcome this difficulty. And, in exploring some of their implications beyond the confines of science and technology, it became apparent that applications promised improvement in governmental and private sector capabilities for dealing, at least theoretically, with a number of socio-economic problems now concerning the several levels of government in the United States. ...|$|R
60|$|M. C---- did {{not attempt}} {{ascending}} to first principles, in his explanations. Animal magnetism was animal magnetism--it was a fact, and not a theory. Its effects {{were not to be}} doubted; they depended on testimony <b>of</b> sufficient validity <b>to</b> <b>dispose</b> <b>of</b> any mere <b>question</b> <b>of</b> authenticity. All that he attempted was hypothesis, which he invited us to controvert. He might as well have desired me to demonstrate that the sun is not a carbuncle. On the modus operandi, and the powers of his art, the doctor was more explicit. There were a great many gradations in quality in his somnambules, some being better and some worse; and there was also a good deal of difference in the intensity of the magnetiser's. It appears to be settled that the best somnambules are females, and the best magnetisers males, though the law is not absolute. I was flattered with being, by nature, a first-rate magnetiser, and the doctor had not the smallest doubt of his ability to put me to sleep; and ability, so far as his theory went, I thought it was likely enough he might possess, though I greatly questioned his physical means.|$|R

[...] He said this so kindly, and yet so positively, as if <b>to</b> promptly <b>dispose</b> <b>of</b> that <b>question</b> before going further, that she assented mechanically. [...] "Well, then, he's taken some big risks {{in the way of}} business, and--well, things have gone bad with him, you know. Very bad! Really, they couldn't be worse! Of course it was dreadfully rash and all that," [...] he went on, as if commenting upon the amusing waywardness of a child; [...] "but the result is the usual smash-up of everything, money, credit, and all!" [...] He laughed and added, [...] "Yes, he's got cut off--mules and baggage regularly routed and dispersed! I'm in earnest." [...] He raised his eyebrows and frowned slightly, as if to deprecate any corresponding hilarity on the part of Mrs. Tucker, or any attempt to make too light of the subject, and then rising, placed his hands behind his back, beamed half-humorously upon her from beneath her husband's picture, and repeated, [...] "That's so." ...|$|R
6000|$|The two {{expected}} deaths had {{now taken}} place, {{and it only}} remained <b>to</b> <b>dispose</b> <b>of</b> the legal <b>questions</b> connected with the events which had caused them, inter the bodies, {{and return to the}} Nest. I saw that one of the cabins was prepared for the reception of Ursula and Lowiny, the latter still clinging to us, while the body of Chainbearer was laid out in a coffin that had been made by the same hands, and at the same time, as that of Thousandacres. About noon, the coroner arrived, not 'Squire Newcome, but another, for whom he had himself sent; and a jury was immediately collected from among the members of the posse. The proceedings were of no great length. I told my story, or {{as much of it as}} was necessary, from beginning to end, and others gave their testimony as to the proceedings at different periods in the events. The finding was, in the case of Chainbearer, [...] "murder by the hand of some person unknown;" [...] and in that of Thousandacres, [...] "accidental death." [...] The first was right, unquestionably; as to the last, I conceive, there was as little of [...] "accident" [...] as ever occurred, when a man was shot through the body by a steady hand, and an unerring eye. But such was the verdict, and I had nothing but conjectures for my opinion as to the agency of the Indian in killing the squatter.|$|R
6000|$|The general <b>question</b> <b>of</b> loans v. {{taxes for}} war {{purposes}} {{is one of}} [...] the utmost interest, but one that I have never seen worked out in [...] print. But assuming as data the established principles of our [...] financial system, and by no means denying the necessity of loans, I [...] have not the least doubt that {{it is for the}} interest of labour, as [...] opposed to capital, that as large a share as possible of war [...] expenditure should be defrayed from taxes. When war breaks out the [...] wages of labour on the whole have a tendency to rise, and the [...] labour of the country is well able to bear some augmentation of [...] taxes. The sums added to the public expenditure are likely at the [...] outset, and for some time, to be larger than the sums withdrawn [...] from commerce. When war ends, on the contrary, a great mass of [...] persons are dismissed from public employment, and, flooding the [...] labour market, reduce the rate of wages. But again, when war comes, [...] it is quite certain that a large share of the war taxes will be [...] laid upon property: and that, in war, property will bear a larger [...] share of our total taxation than in peace. From this it seems to [...] follow at once that, up to the point at which endurance is [...] practicable, payment by war-taxes rather than by taxes in peace is [...] for the interest of the people at large. I am not one of those who [...] think that our system of taxation, taken as a whole, is an [...] over-liberal one towards them. These observations are mere [...] contributions to a discussion, and by no means pretend <b>to</b> <b>dispose</b> [...] <b>of</b> the <b>question.</b>|$|R
