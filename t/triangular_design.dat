5|$|Band Hero also {{introduced}} an updated {{revision of the}} drum kit that shipped with Guitar Hero World Tour. Many changes were made to address weight and size concerns that made assembly difficult, and the stand's crossbar {{was moved to the}} bottom to improve leg room and allow the bass pedal to be supported by it. The cymbals were changed to a circular shape from the previous <b>triangular</b> <b>design,</b> and the sensitivity of the drums themselves were adjusted. An in-game sensitivity adjustment feature is also supported. In the United States, the new controller was, for a limited time, exclusive to the game and instrument bundles of Band Hero on Wii. The Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions of the controller were released at a later date; Band Hero bundles for these platforms in the U.S. included the World Tour drum controller.|$|E

The fortplanned and constructed on Södra Åberget Mountain south of Boden between 1902 and 1908was together with Rödberget Fort part of the southern fort group. Södra Åberget Fort had the standard armament {{in the form of}} 12cm kanon m/99, 8.4cm kanon m/94-04 and 57mm kaponjärkanon m/07. The 8.4cm artillery was modernised between 1950 and 1952.

50|$|This {{period is}} divided into three {{different}} sub periods: MBII A, B, and C. We shall see that B and C are closer linked than A. This period is diagnosed by the well-burnished red slip so often seen in the corresponding layers at digs. The slip is normally used on the smaller vessels of the period. Other decorating techniques found to be frequent amongst this period's pottery are horizontal sometimes <b>triangular</b> <b>designs</b> in black or red paint.|$|R
5000|$|The row {{design has}} a large, {{non-uniform}} current distribution. The alternating design exhibits better uniformity, given {{a high number}} of electrodes of opposite polarity. For systems with an anode or cathode that is sensitive to non-uniform current density, non-equal numbers of cathodes and anodes can be used; the 2:1 hexagonal design allows for a uniform current density at the anode but a non-uniform current distribution at the cathode. Performance can be increased through changing the shape of the poles. The <b>triangular</b> <b>design</b> improves cell capacity and power by sacrificing current uniformity. [...] A similar system uses interdigitated plates instead of poles.|$|E
50|$|The KX300 is a {{triangular}} unit designed {{so it could}} be used in groups, although many were erected alone. The <b>triangular</b> <b>design</b> of the KX300 ensures acoustic and weather protection. It was also designed to enable full use of available floor space and to provide better siting flexibility. As with the KX100, it has raised sides to prevent litter accumulation.There are two versions, one with two glass sides, the other with one glass side and one fabricated side with acoustic panels and fittings for directory holders. It was essentially {{a triangular}}-based variant of the KX100. Several KX300s were fitted with doors that resemble the KX100 doors, although many were not.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} C.710 {{model was}} an angular design developed {{from an earlier}} series of air racers. One common feature of the Caudron line was an extremely long nose that set the cockpit far back on the fuselage. The profile {{was the result of}} using the 336 kW (450 hp) Renault 12R-01 12-cylinder inline engine, which had a small cross-section and was fairly easy to streamline, but very long. The landing gear was fixed and spatted, and the vertical stabilizer was a seemingly World War I-era semicircle instead of a more common trapezoidal or <b>triangular</b> <b>design.</b> Armament consisted of a 20 mm Hispano-Suiza HS.9 cannon under each wing in a small pod.|$|E

50|$|Art historians often cite {{this new}} canon of {{proportions}} {{as evidence of}} Jōchō's genius. He based the measurements on a unit equal to {{the distance between the}} sculpted figure's chin and hairline. The distance between each knee is equal to the distance from the bottoms of the legs to the hair. The widely spaced and level knees thus form the base of a <b>triangular</b> <b>design,</b> conveying a feeling of stability and peace. The effect is further accentuated by the contrast of other elements in the design, particularly the figures' halos. These are intricately detailed, featuring dancing tennin, clouds, and flames. Jōchō's sculptures' expressions convey compassion and elegance, and the detailed and precise carving of the facial features projects a certain kindness.|$|E

5000|$|Although {{the combat}} box was {{initially}} designed around {{a group of}} airplanes, it was expanded to include a formation of three groups flying together as a [...] "combat wing", {{all of which were}} based on the same <b>triangular</b> <b>design</b> of a leading bomber (or grouping of bombers) in the center, and two bombers (or groupings) immediately behind in a vee shape, with one at an altitude above and one below the center in close proximity for mutual defense. The new combat boxes continued to be used, but groups were placed in a horizontal column and stacked at increasing altitude to decrease their vulnerability to attack. This resulted in the rear formations lagging behind which impacted both defensive tactics and bombing performance.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the most}} {{distinctive}} aspects of indigenous handcrafted textiles {{is the use of}} embroidery. Indigenous motifs found on garments range from geometric patterns, zig-zag, spirals, moons, crosses and stepped frets. Thin cloth belts that wrap around the waist (fajillas) are common in a number of indigenous groups and are richly embroidered. The borders are often adorned with zig-zag edging, such as those of the Huichols. The Otomis use a moon pattern on these belts along with their morrals or carrying bags, and the Tarahumara tend to decorate theirs with <b>triangular</b> <b>designs.</b> Many of the embroidery patterns of the huipils in Oaxaca, also show pre-Hispanic influence. Flower designs are popular for embroidering women’s clothing among the Otomis, Nahuas, Huastecs, Huichols and others. Spirals and curved designs appear with frequency especially in the center and south of the country.|$|R
