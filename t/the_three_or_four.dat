5|$|During the University of Michigan {{basketball}} scandal the Big Ten Conference, National Collegiate Athletic Association, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Internal Revenue Service, and United States Department of Justice {{investigated the}} relationship between the University of Michigan, its men's basketball teams and basketball team booster Ed Martin. The program was punished for NCAA rules violations, principally involving payments booster Martin made to several players to launder money from an illegal gambling operation. It {{is one of the largest}} incidents involving payments to college athletes in American collegiate history. It was described as one of <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> worst violations of NCAA bylaws in history up to that time by the NCAA infractions committee chairman and the largest athlete payment scandal ever by ESPN.|$|E
5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> {{years after}} {{his visit to the}} papacy, {{agreements}} were made with the various institutions who were drawing income from Clement's diocese – namely Coupar Angus Abbey, Lindores Abbey, Cambuskenneth Abbey, Arbroath Abbey, the nunnery of North Berwick and the Hospital of Brackley, Northamptonshire. These agreements did not constitute complete success. Clement was able to recover some revenue, but in fixed payments liable to real decline by way of inflation. Moreover, he had to concede permanent canonries to several of the abbots, concessions which would give them a role in the election of his successors. Another partial set-back took place. Walter Comyn, Earl of Menteith, had decided to found a monastery in his earldom and take up the income of Menteith's churches to do it; the whole of Menteith constituted nearly half of the diocese. Despite the Pope's previously helpful behaviour towards Clement's cause, he granted the earl permission to found the new monastery. The earl established Inchmahome Priory in the Lake of Menteith in 1238. Walter and Clement came to conflict over the new priory's rights, but in the same year an agreement was drawn up in a meeting of churchmen at Perth. The agreement placed most of Menteith's churches {{under the control of the}} earl; however, Clement obtained several concessions, including the right to receive episcopal dues from the new priory. Overall, Clement's successes were considerable considering the opposition which he faced, but even after his death, only 12 of the 26 parish churches in the diocese were under the bishop's direct control.|$|E

25|$|In 1877, two prospectors, Hank Smith and William Curry, {{discovered}} {{silver in}} present-day Silverado Canyon. Several mines immediately sprang {{up in the}} area, the largest of which {{was known as the}} Blue Light Mine. During this period, the town of Silverado rose at the confluence of Silverado Creek and Santiago Creek and the boom continued for over three years. Although the height of the mining was in <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> years following the discovery of silver, smaller-scale mining continued for decades after the initial boom had ended. The last commercial operations at the Blue Light Mine ceased in the 1940s.

25|$|Butterfield also oversaw {{installation}} of the taping system which Nixon ordered for the White House. On February 10, 1971, Haldeman's assistant, Larry Higby, told Butterfield that president Nixon wanted a voice-activated audio taping system installed in the Oval Office and on White House telephones. The goal, Nixon said, {{was to create a}} more accurate record of events. Butterfield worked with the Secret Service to install five hidden microphones in Nixon's desk, two in lamps on the mantel over the fireplace, two in the cabinet room, and on all telephone lines in the Lincoln Sitting Room and the Oval Office. According to Butterfield, the system was highly secret, its existence known only to Nixon, Haldeman, Ehrlichman, Higby, <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> Secret Service technical staffers who installed it, and him. In April 1971, Nixon ordered the taping system installed in his private office in the Executive Office Building.|$|E
25|$|Allied forces {{begin to}} take large numbers of Axis prisoners: The total number of prisoners taken on the Western Front in April 1945 by the Western Allies was 1,500,000. April also {{witnessed}} the capture of at least 120,000 German troops by the Western Allies in the last campaign {{of the war in}} Italy. In <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> months up to the end of April, over 800,000 German soldiers surrendered on the Eastern Front. In early April, the first Allied-governed Rheinwiesenlagers were established in western Germany to hold hundreds of thousands of captured or surrendered Axis Forces personnel. Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF) reclassified all prisoners as Disarmed Enemy Forces, not POWs (prisoners of war). The legal fiction circumvented provisions under the Geneva Convention of 1929 on the treatment of former combatants. By October, thousands had died in the camps from starvation, exposure and disease.|$|E

25|$|Jacques Bellange (c. 1575–1616) was {{an artist}} and {{printmaker}} from the Duchy of Lorraine (then independent but now part of France) whose etchings and some drawings are his only securely identified works today. They {{are among the most}} striking Northern Mannerist old master prints, mostly on Catholic religious subjects, and with a highly individual style. He worked for fourteen years in the capital, Nancy as court painter to two Dukes of Lorraine, before dying at the age of about forty, and almost all his prints were produced in <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> years before his death. None of his paintings are known to have survived, but the prints have been known to collectors since shortly after his death, though they were out of critical favour for most of this period.

500|$|On 13 June 1957 {{he became}} {{chairman}} of a committee of Privy Counsellors holding an inquiry into the Home Secretary's use of telephone tapping. After twenty-nine meetings, Birkett drafted a report which he passed on to Parliament supporting the use of telephone taps and noting their effectiveness. On 9 December, a letter arrived from the Prime Minister offering him a peerage. He accepted, and his name appeared in the New Year Honours list, and was created Baron Birkett, of Ulverston in the County of Lancaster, and took his seat in the House of Lords on 20 February 1958. In the same year, he was awarded a LLD by the University of Cambridge, where the speaker said that Birkett was [...] "endowed with such a voice as Cicero declared to be first requisite of an orator" [...] and that [...] "in our own time {{there had been no}} one more skilled in swaying the mind of a jury." [...] In February 1959, he appeared on the first episode of the BBC television program Face to Face, where he was described as [...] "one of <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> greatest criminal lawyers of this century, and perhaps one of <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> greatest criminal lawyers of all time".

500|$|After {{his visit}} to Rome for Il trovatore in January 1853, Verdi worked on {{completing}} La traviata, but with little hope of its success, due to his {{lack of confidence in}} any of the singers engaged for the season. Furthermore, the management insisted that the opera be given a historical, not a contemporary setting. The premiere in March 1853 was indeed a failure: Verdi wrote: [...] "Was the fault mine or the singers'? Time will tell." [...] Subsequent productions (following some rewriting) throughout Europe over the following two years fully vindicated the composer; Roger Parker has written [...] "Il trovatore consistently remains one of <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> most popular operas in the Verdian repertoire: but it has never pleased the critics".|$|E

At the end of 1943, all four IK-2s were still in service, but at {{the end of the}} following year, just two IK-2s remained. No IK-2s survived the war.|$|E

[...] "We did <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> cuts that Todd had brought us up to do, and we shook hands with everybody," [...] Kaylan recalled, but as they were preparing to leave, Rundgren asked them to listen to the album's planned single.

500|$|Mehldau's {{interest}} in figures of 19th century German Romanticism, including Brahms, Schubert, and Schumann, influenced his first solo piano release, Elegiac Cycle, which {{was recorded in}} 1999 and broke the sequence of trio recordings under his name.

The recording features standards, Mehldau originals, Miles Davis' [...] "Solar", and another version of [...] "Exit Music (For a Film)". Also in 1999, Mehldau was pianist for two albums by saxophonist Charles Lloyd. In the following year, Places, an album containing both Mehldau solo piano pieces and trio performances, was released. All of the tracks were Mehldau originals, and were based on his experiences of visiting and revisiting various locations worldwide. , the final album in that series, was another concert recording from the Village Vanguard, and was recorded in 2000 and released in 2001. Looking back on his earlier career, Mehldau commented in 2005 that [...] "The trio created my identity".

500|$|To {{preserve}} {{the secret of}} the proximity fuze, its use was initially permitted only over water, where a dud round could not fall into enemy hands. In late 1943, the Army obtained permission to use the weapon over land. The proximity fuze proved particularly effective against the V-1 flying bomb over England, and later Antwerp, in 1944. A version was also developed for use with howitzers against ground targets. Bush met with the Joint Chiefs of Staff in October 1944 to press for its use, arguing that the Germans would be unable to copy and produce it before the war was over. Eventually, the Joint Chiefs agreed to allow its employment from December 25. In response to the German Ardennes Offensive on December 16, 1944, the immediate use of the proximity fuze was authorized, and it went into action with deadly effect. By the end of 1944, VT fuzes were coming off the production lines at the rate of 40,000 per day. [...] "If one looks at the proximity fuze program as a whole," [...] historian James Phinney Baxter III wrote, [...] "the magnitude and complexity of the effort rank it among <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> most extraordinary scientific achievements of the war." ...|$|E

500|$|On May 8, 2003, the NCAA {{accepted}} Michigan's sanctions. It also imposed {{an additional}} {{two years of}} probation and docked the school one scholarship a year from 20042005 until 20072008. It also ordered the school to disassociate itself from Traylor (who has since died), Taylor and Bullock until 2012, and Webber until 2013. The NCAA also barred Michigan from postseason play for the 200304 season (later overturned on appeal). Infractions committee chairman Thomas Yeager, who had come very close to imposing the [...] "death penalty" [...] on the University of Alabama football program a few months earlier, called the Martin/Michigan affair [...] "one of <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> most egregious violations of NCAA bylaws" [...] ever. The disassociation meant that Michigan could not accept donations or recruiting assistance {{from any of the}} players for ten years. Webber's sanction ended on May 8, 2013. The NCAA criticized Fisher for allowing Martin access to the program, but did not sanction him. The University announced its intention to appeal the additional one-year suspension from post-season play. As a result of the sanctions, Ellerbe's successor, Tommy Amaker, received a two-year contract extension through the 2007–08 season to compensate for the duties while under probation, and Bernard Robinson, Jr. had the right to transfer without sitting out a year because, as the only scholarship senior, the ineligibility extended for his entire remaining scholarship tenure.|$|E
