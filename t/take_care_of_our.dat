It made our hearts {{glad to hear that}} was your wish... but now, father, we see you drawing back, and we are sorry to see our father doing so without seeing the enemy. We must compare our father's conduct to a fat animal, that carries its tail upon its back, but when affrighted, it drops it between its legs and runs off.|$|E
25|$|Ceres, as the Goddess who has {{control over}} nature's {{resources}} and cycles, may astrologically {{be considered the}} planet of the Environment. Returning to mythology, an early environmental villain is the figure of Erysichthon, the tearer up of the earth, who cut down trees in a grove sacred to Ceres-Demeter, {{for which he was}} punished by the goddess with fearful hunger. In this sense Ceres became an emerging archetype in the awareness of recent climate change, and is entering our collective consciousness as a need to <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> natural and irreplaceable resources in the 21st century. Ceres represents a leap towards a future of ecological responsibility and knowledge. As an indicator for environmental or community activism, Ceres would represent for some astrologers the wave of the future.|$|E

[...] The video was also compared to Bruce Springsteen's [...] "We <b>Take</b> <b>Care</b> <b>of</b> <b>Our</b> Own" [...] music video, [...] "with its gritty portraits of beleaguered U.S. citizens of every race and creed."

2500|$|Born in Cluj (Kolozsvár), Lívia Rusz {{was from}} a Hungarian-Romanian family. She {{grew up in a}} mixed environment, among local Hungarians and Romanians, and, {{according}} to her own recollection: [...] "My road was opened by a school with exceptional spirituality, where I was taught to respect and maintain traditions, to treasure the eternal cultural values, to preserve and <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> identity so as not to offend the others". Her father, Liviu, was a Romanian Railways employee, amateur artist and calligrapher, who had undergone formal training with painter Sándor Szopos. Rusz was herself avid to train in visual art, copying his paintings, learning how to use watercolors, and entering a class run by Szopos. After graduating from primary school, Rusz continued her education at a high school in her native city, where her talents brought her to the attention of painter and academic Zoltán Kovács. On Kovács' personal recommendation, she applied for the Cluj Art Institute upon passing her baccalaureate examination, and completed her training in 1955. She declared herself [...] "lucky" [...] to have been taught by Kovács, [...] "an artist with virtues recognized even by those who undermined him". As a result of this training and influence, she came to define herself as a [...] "conservative", who did not [...] "renew [...] whenever the fashion changes." [...] Rusz was Assistant at the Institute for the following three years, losing her post to an administrative restructuring.|$|E

40|$|The {{principal}} {{problem is}} the control of a nonlinear system with uncertainty. We will consider a robot manipulator system, which is nonlinear, and uncertain (unknown parameters and modeling errors). Our goals are {{to come up with}} a design of controllers that insure the stability of the system and provide robustness to parameters changes and modeling errors. We will use the theory developed for uncertain linear systems after carrying out an exact linearization of the original system. This linearization which is not an approximation, has been recently developed. The linear part of the controller has been designed so as to guarantee tracking and disturbance rejection. However, additional constraints resulting from the original nonlinear system have to be <b>taken</b> <b>care</b> <b>of.</b> <b>Our</b> design is tested by simulation on a two degree of freedom robot manipulator, which is simple enough to simulate but has all the properties of more general manipulators...|$|R

We live in an era where it is well <b>taken</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> physical comfort, but our mind is in danger. People often feel worthless and do not understand their feelings so we have developed a web application that helps strenghten confidence and encourages understanding of emotions. We started development {{with the use of}} some newer technologies. On the server side, we used Node. js, Express. js and MongoDB technologies while we used AngularJS, HTML, CSS and JavaScript on the client side. Over the years we have accumulated a lot of ideas from psychological fields that inspire positive revelations. We included these ideas in the application and we also presented them in this work. They provide the basis for a positive environment that grows together with it's users. We also added conclusions, opinions of test users and objectives for future work into the thesis...|$|R
5000|$|During the 1920s and 1930s, Aimee Semple McPherson was a {{controversial}} faith healer of growing popularity during the Great Depression. Subsequently, William Branham has been credited as {{the founder of}} the post-World War II healing revivals. By the late 1940s, Oral Roberts was well known, and he continued with faith healing until the 1980s. Roberts discounted faith healing in the late 1950s, stating, [...] "I never was a faith healer and I was never raised that way. My parents believed very strongly in medical science and we have a doctor who <b>takes</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> children when they get sick. I cannot heal anyone - God does that." [...] A friend of Roberts was Kathryn Kuhlman, another popular faith healer, who gained fame in the 1950s and had a television program on CBS. Also in this era, Jack Coe and A. A. Allen were faith healers who traveled with large tents for large open-air crusades.|$|R
