However, considering the location of the school, several hundred meters {{to the west of the}} Residence.

500|$|On {{that first}} mission, Tibbets saw in {{real-time}} that his bombs were falling on innocent civilians. [...] At the time, {{he thought to}} himself, [...] "People are getting killed down there that don't have any business getting killed. [...] Those are not soldiers." [...] But then he <b>thought</b> <b>back</b> to a lesson he had learned during his time at medical school from his roommate who was a doctor. [...] This doctor explained to him about his former classmates who failed the program {{and ended up in}} drug sales. [...] The reason why they had failed the program was because [...] "they had too much sympathy for their patients", which [...] "destroyed their ability to render the medical necessities". [...] It dawned on Tibbets that: ...|$|E
500|$|Joy and Sadness {{encounter}} Bing Bong, Riley's childhood imaginary friend, who suggests {{riding the}} train of <b>thought</b> <b>back</b> to Headquarters. The three eventually catch the train, {{but it is}} halted when Riley falls asleep. They succeed in manipulating Riley's dreams to wake her and restart the train, but it is derailed when the [...] "Honesty Island" [...] collapses (when Riley steals her mother's credit card and begins to run away). In desperation, Joy tries to ride a [...] "recall tube" [...] back to Headquarters, but abandons Sadness since close proximity to Sadness will cause the core memories to turn sad, which Joy believes will hurt Riley. But as she takes off, the ground below the tube collapses, breaking the tube and plunging Joy and Bing Bong into the Memory Dump. At the bottom, Joy then begins to lose hope and breaks into tears and cries, but discovers a sad memory of a ice hockey game that became happy when Riley's parents and friends comforted her. Joy realizes that Sadness serves an important purpose: to create empathy in others when Riley is emotionally overwhelmed and needs help.|$|E

2500|$|Zaitsev was {{the tailor}} to Vladimir Zhirinovsky for his 1996 Russian presidential campaign. Zaitsev, {{who planned to}} vote for Boris Yeltsin, stated on Zhirinovsky, [...] "He wanted {{something}} distinctly Russian, so I <b>thought</b> <b>back</b> to the military-style jackets of the 20s, the 30slike Stalin, only in new colours". On 27 May 1996, President of Russia Boris Yeltsin awarded Zaitsev the State Prize of the Russian Federation {{in the field of}} literature and the arts. In 1996, Zaitsev was also made an honorary citizen of the city of his birth, Ivanovo.|$|E
2500|$|On November 11, 1961, Baez played {{her first}} major New York concert at a sold-out {{performance}} at Town Hall. [...] Robert Shelton, folk {{critic of the}} New York Times, praised the concert, saying, [...] "That superb soprano voice, as lustrous and rich as old gold, flowed purely all evening with a wondrous ease. [...] Her singing (unwound) like a spool of satin." [...] (Stu Steadman (2017). [...] "This Day in Rock." [...] www.thisdayinrock.com) [...] Years later when Baez <b>thought</b> <b>back</b> to that concert, she laughed, saying: [...] "I remember in 1961 my manager sending me this newspaper (clipping) in the mail (which) read, 'Joan Baez Town Hall Concert, SRO.' [...] I thought SRO meant 'sold right out.' [...] I was so innocent of it all." [...] (David A. Maurer (March 10, 2016). [...] "Joan Baez: Folk Singer, Hereditary Activist." [...] "The Daily Progress.") ...|$|E
2500|$|Perry {{described}} the process [...] "a very pure moment for me" [...] and continued saying, [...] " [...] where I started my creative juices. And also {{it kind of}} exudes this euphoric feeling because everybody remembers what their teenage dreams were — all the girls that were on your poster walls." [...] After she recorded the vocals, McKee pulled Luke and Martin aside and told them her idea, to which they responded, [...] "Well why didn't you {{say that in the}} first place?". The chorus was rewritten, and the line [...] "Skin tight jeans" [...] was taken from the early [...] "trying me on" [...] version. When the final version was finished, McKee said, [...] "We were all so pumped that it had paid off. I remember Max sitting back and saying 'I wish we could bottle this feeling'. It was really magical." [...] Perry commented that even though the song was rewritten many times, she was [...] "so happy to finally get somewhere that we all agreed on" [...] after it was finished. During an interview in June 2010, Perry confirmed [...] "Teenage Dream" [...] as the second single from the album, and said that the song was about [...] "kind of like feeling that way when you were a teenager: really emotional, really invested..... It's intense being in love and being a teenager." [...] After confirming that [...] "Teenage Dream" [...] was also the title of the album, she explained that it was a throwback to her teenage years, as she <b>thought</b> <b>back</b> to her youth while contemplating marriage to her boyfriend Russell Brand. She added, [...] "To me, this year is pretty heavy. I am going to be getting married and putting out this record, and there is so much going on that it's nice to think of those young dreams." ...|$|E

60|$|Sam paused. Cold aloofness was {{all very}} well, but this {{conversation}} was developing into a vulgar brawl. The ghosts of dead and gone Marlowes, all noted for their courtesy to the sex, seemed to stand beside his chair, eyeing him reprovingly. His work, they seemed to whisper, was becoming raw. It was time to jerk the interchange of <b>thought</b> <b>back</b> {{into the realm of}} distant civility.|$|E
60|$|It may {{be added}} {{that one of}} the not too many merits of the essay {{is the way in which}} the writer, more or less in the Socratic manner, insists on {{dragging}} people out of the refuge of sonorous general terms, with a great public reputation of much too well-established a kind to be subjected to the affront of analysis. It is true that Rousseau himself contributed nothing directly to that analytic operation which Socrates likened to midwifery, and he set up graven images of his own in place of the idols which he destroyed. This, however, did not wholly efface the distinction, which he shares with all who have ever tried to lead the minds of men into new tracks, of refusing to accept the current coins of philosophical speech without test or measurement. Such a treatment of the great trite words which come so easily to the tongue and seem to weigh for so much, must always be the first step towards bringing <b>thought</b> <b>back</b> into the region of real matter, and confronting phrases, terms, and all the common form of the discussion of an age, with the actualities which it is the object of sincere discussion to penetrate.|$|E

60|$|At his query {{she made}} a sudden effort to bring her <b>thoughts</b> <b>back</b> from the past to the present, to drag her heart and her aching brain away from that half-hour spent in the hall, from that {{conversation}} with her friend, from the recollection of that terribly cruel blow which she {{had been forced to}} deal to the man who loved her best in all the world.|$|R
60|$|Was it {{helplessness}} {{that man}} loved in woman, then? It {{seemed to be}} Elspeth's helplessness that had made Tommy such a brother, and how it had always appealed to Aaron! No woman could be less helpless than herself, Grizel knew. She <b>thought</b> <b>back</b> and back, {{and she could not}} come to a time when she was not managing somebody. Women, she reflected, fall more or less deeply in love with every baby they see, while men, even the best of them, can look calmly at other people's babies. But when the helplessness of the child is in the woman, then other women are unmoved; but the great heart of man is stirred--woman is his baby. She remembered that the language of love is in two sexes--for the woman superlatives, for the man diminutives. The more she loves the bigger he grows, but in an ecstasy he could put her in his pocket. Had not Tommy taught her this? His little one, his child! Perhaps he really had loved her in the days when they both made believe that she was infantile; but soon she had shown with fatal clearness that she was not. Instead of needing to be taken care of, she had obviously wanted to take care of him: their positions were reversed. Perhaps, said Grizel to herself, I should have been a man.|$|E
60|$|When Maud Gonne {{returned}} {{she became}} our directing mind both in England and in Ireland, {{and it was}} mainly at her bidding that our movement become a protest against the dissensions, the lack of dignity, of the Parnellite and Anti-Parnellite parties, who had fought one another for seven or eight years, till busy men passed them by, as they did those performing cats that in my childhood I used to see, pretending to spit at one another on a table, outside Charing Cross station. Both parliamentary parties seeing that all young Ireland, and {{a good part of}} old, were in the movement, tried to join us, the Anti-Parnellite without abandoning its separate identity. They were admitted I think, but upon what terms I do not remember. I and two or three others had to meet Michael Davitt, and a member of parliament called F. X. O'Brien to talk out the question of separate identity, and I remember nothing of what passed but the manner and image of Michael Davitt. He seemed hardly more unfitted for such negotiation, perhaps even for any possible present politics, than I myself, and I watched him with sympathy. One knows by the way a man sits in his chair if he have emotional intensity, and Davitt's suggested to me a writer, a painter, an artist of some kind, rather than a man of action. Then, too, F. X. O'Brien did not care whether he used a good or a bad argument, whether he seemed a fool or a clever man, so that he carried his point, but if he used a bad argument Davitt would bring our <b>thought</b> <b>back</b> to it though he had to wait several minutes and re-state it. One felt that he had lived always with small unimaginative, effective men whom he despised; and that perhaps through some lack of early education, perhaps because nine years' imprisonment at the most plastic period of his life had jarred or broken his contact with reality, he had failed, except during the first months of the Land League, to dominate those men. He told me that if the split in the Irish Party had not come he would have carried the Land League into the Highlands, and recovered for Ireland as much of Scotland as was still Gaelic in blood or in language. Our negotiations, which interested so much F. X. O'Brien and my two negotiators, a barrister and a doctor, bored him I thought, even more than they did me, to whom they were a novelty; but the Highland plan with its historical foundation and its vague possibilities excited him, {{and it seemed to me}} that what we said or did stirred him, at other moments also, to some similar remote thought and emotion. I think he returned my sympathy, for a little before his death he replied to some words of congratulation I sent him after the speech in which he resigned his seat in the House of Commons, with an account of some project of his for improving the quality of the Irish representation there.|$|E
