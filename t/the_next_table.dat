They later explain {{that one of the}} sleeper agents resides in Quahog, and they are looking for him/her. Chase and Aykroyd ask Brian and Stewie to help them in their mission, noting that they know several people acting very strangely in Quahog. Brian and Stewie accept the offer.|$|E
500|$|Pinter's last stage play, Celebration (2000), is {{a social}} satire set in an opulent restaurant, which lampoons The Ivy, a fashionable venue in London's West End theatre district, and its patrons who [...] "have just come from {{performances}} of either the ballet or the opera. Not that they can remember a darn thing about what they saw, including the titles. [...] gilded, foul-mouthed souls are just as myopic {{when it comes to}} their own table mates (and for that matter, their food), with conversations that usually connect only on the surface, if there." [...] On its surface the play may appear to have fewer overtly political resonances than some of the plays from the 1980s and 1990s; but its central male characters, brothers named Lambert and Matt, are members of the elite (like the men in charge in Party Time), who describe themselves as [...] "peaceful strategy consultants [...] we don't carry guns." [...] At <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>table,</b> Russell, a banker, describes himself as a [...] "totally disordered personality... a psychopath," [...] while Lambert [...] "vows to be reincarnated as ' more civilised, [...] gentler person, [...] nicer person'." [...] These characters' deceptively smooth exteriors mask their extreme viciousness. [...] Celebration evokes familiar Pinteresque political contexts: [...] "The ritzy loudmouths in 'Celebration'... and the quieter working-class mumblers of 'The Room'... have everything in common beneath the surface". [...] "Money remains in the service of entrenched power, and the brothers in the play are 'strategy consultants' whose jobs involve force and violence... It is tempting but inaccurate to equate the comic power inversions of the social behavior in Celebration with lasting change in larger political structures", according to Grimes, for whom the play indicates Pinter's pessimism about the possibility of changing the status quo. [...] Yet, as the Waiter's often comically unbelievable reminiscences about his grandfather demonstrate in Celebration, Pinter's final stage plays also extend some expressionistic aspects of his earlier [...] "memory plays", while harking back to his [...] "comedies of menace", as illustrated in the characters and in the Waiter's final speech: ...|$|E

Intuitively, this explains why an element's contribution never [...] "runs out" [...] regardless of how many times the table is expanded: since the table is always doubled, the newest half always covers the cost of moving the oldest half.|$|R
40|$|The article {{describes}} the training program {{that takes into account}} the laws of human mental activity. The peculiarity of this training is that it enables specialists to generate additional intellectual potentials. This potentials relate to various kinds of illogical (intuitive) and hybrid (human-machine) intelligences that are associated with the quality of professional and creative activity in future. Progress in trans-phenomenal functional systems of the brain is possible by means of special procedures and computer-based training programs. The article offers a logical system of computer-aided training. This system repeatedly compares its input and output data and uses a feedback as the innate human characteristic to obtain the final result. Computer-aided training can be implemented in analog and numeric form. The article deals with the numeric widely used MS Excel-based software. It provides tabular and graphic style visualization desirable for training. A specific technical program is used for training. It allows specialists to develop a reinforcement shell of square cell type of minimal weight. In designing various constraints can be considered. On the main page of MS Excel program there are input data tables, various forms of the cell, methods of its manufacturing, and a scale table. Coefficients needed for calculations are in <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>tables.</b> <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>tables</b> contain also technological and design limitations. The basic table enables us to vary the geometric complexes of the reinforcement shell. Using the tabular and graphical results of calculations an operator can define values of further steps (iterations). The operator’s aim is to design the shell of minimum weight for the shortest time or number of steps. There is number of counters using macros in the MS Excel tables to calculate the number of past iterations. </p...|$|R

2500|$|Known as Modì (which {{plays on}} the French word 'maudit', meaning 'cursed') by many Parisians, but as Dedo {{to his family and}} friends, Modigliani was a {{handsome}} man, and attracted much female attention. Women came and went until Beatrice Hastings entered his life. She stayed with him for almost two years, was the subject of several of his portraits, including Madame Pompadour, and the object of much of his drunken wrath.
