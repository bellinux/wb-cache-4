50|$|Another way to {{classify}} alternators {{is by the}} number of phases of their output voltage. The output can be single phase, or polyphase. <b>Three-phase</b> <b>alternators</b> are the most common, but polyphase alternators can be two phase, six phase, or more.|$|R
50|$|Early designs using LEDs and {{rechargeable}} batteries used dynamos much like small DC motors, but suffered from very short brush life. Small alternators with multipole permanent-magnet external cup rotors, combined with bridge rectifiers, offered long lives. Both single-phase and <b>three-phase</b> <b>alternators</b> are in use. Overcharge is possible, {{and to be}} avoided.|$|R
25|$|Two-stage {{air-conditioning}} {{was fitted}} for summer, and heating elements placed underneath the carpet for winter. Those systems, {{along with those}} for lighting and announcements, were powered by <b>three-phase</b> <b>alternators,</b> fixed to the underframe of each carriage. These required refuelling, but were cheaper and more reliable than the axle-driven generators used most earlier vehicles.|$|R

5000|$|The new funding {{paid for}} the {{construction}} of additional workshops and the transition of the plant from mechanical drive with its great shafts and belts to electric drive. Two 4-cylinder vertical gas engines of [...] each, designed by the Anderson Foundry Co. of Glasgow, coupled to <b>three-phase</b> <b>alternators</b> built by Allmänna Svenska Elektriska Aktiebolaget of Sweden provided the electricity.|$|R
50|$|The {{plant was}} built by Westinghouse in 1907 in Mission Style, and was located on Long Island Sound. The plant used {{coal-fired}} steam turbines, and the <b>three-phase</b> <b>alternators</b> supplied single-phase power at 11 kV 25 Hz directly to the catenary. They also supplied power to the New York Central's Port Morris generating station to compensate the NYC for power consumed by New Haven trains on the NYC's third-rail supplied line to the Grand Central Terminal within the city limits.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotives}} have a supercharged 16-cylinder {{diesel engine}} of the MTU 4000 series developing 2,000 kW of power which drive a <b>three-phase</b> brushless <b>alternator.</b> At idle 8 of the 16 cylinders can be turned off, reducing fuel consumption and emissions.|$|R
50|$|A {{hydraulic}} turbine at Lauffen powered a <b>three-phase</b> <b>alternator</b> with a revolving field. The alternator revolved at 150 revolutions per minute, {{and had a}} rotating field magnet with 32 poles. It was rated at 300 hp and had a terminal voltage of 55 volts. The frequency of the current was 40 Hz. Power from the alternator was stepped up to 8000 volts for transmission by oil-insulated transformers. Later tests were carried out with transmission voltage up to 25,000 volts (between phases).|$|E
50|$|The {{station was}} built in 1900, and {{equipped}} with six Yates and Thom, 2,500hp steam engines, each engine driving an Electrical Co. Ltd, 1,500 kW, <b>three-phase</b> <b>alternator,</b> giving an output of 6,500V at 50 Hz. Babcock & Wilcox supplied 24 boilers fitted with mechanical stokers. In 1904, two Wallsend Slipway & Engineering Company, 6000 hp, marine triple-expansion steam engines were installed, each driving a 3,750 kW, 6,500V, three-phase flywheel alternator. Twelve extra boilers by Babcock & Wilcox were installed to drive the new engines. The plant's first turbine-driven generator was installed in 1907.|$|E
50|$|The {{traction}} engine was a four-pole, three-phase, 525-volt AC induction motor, weighing 143 pounds (65 kg), {{with a maximum}} speed of 24,000 rpm; it had an aluminum housing, was lubricated by oil, and had an 8:1 motor to final drive ratio. Electrical power was supplied by a water-cooled, <b>three-phase</b> <b>alternator</b> which was built into a two-stage gas turbine, fueled with liquified natural gas, running at 50,000 rpm at low speed and 100,000 rpm at high speed, weighing 186 pounds. Additional energy for acceleration was provided by a 147-pound SatCon composite flywheel housed in a vacuum chamber running at 58,000 rpm, coupled to the drive train via three-phase permanent magnets in a Halbach array.|$|E
50|$|In 1902, two 1,500-kW Parsons {{steam turbine}} driven turbo-alternators {{were added to}} the initial {{equipment}} at the station. At the time, these were the largest three-phase steam turbine driven alternators in the world, as well as being the first of the barrel type rotary design. Results gained from the turbines influenced the Cunard Steamship Company to install steam turbines on the Mauretania. The turbines drove 6,000 V <b>three-phase</b> <b>alternators,</b> supplying current to motor-generators and transformers in the substations attached to the distribution network. The motor-generators in the substations provided DC from the supplied AC and the transformers stepped-down the 6,000 V supply to 200 V for lighting use and 400 V for industrial use.|$|R
50|$|The {{batteries}} provide variable DC power (VP), which ranges {{in normal}} usage from 390 to 650 V. Pumps for ballast, water, air compressors, ventilation, cooling, and hydraulics are all designed {{to cope with}} this supply range, but some equipment cannot. The boat, therefore, is supplied with two sets of auxiliary motor generators designed to be powered by the batteries and produce stable output, one set powered by each main battery. A 220-V DC supply (CP) is provided by two 100-kW generators, one supplied from each battery with either being sufficient by itself. Two 15-kW 60-Hz <b>three-phase</b> <b>alternators</b> provide power for equipment designed to work off 115 or 230 V AC and two more 15-kW 400-Hz generators provide power at 205 V AC used by radar, sonar, fire control, and communications electronics. Two 4-kW generators plus an additional backup battery provide 24 V DC.|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{discusses}} {{the use of}} biomass for electricity island operation. The first chapter explains the concept of biomass and its distribution. It also shows the potential and availability of biomass. The second chapter describes the transformation of biomass into a suitable fuel form. The third to fifth chapter describes the conversion of biomass as a fuel into electrical energy through combustion, Stirling and steam engine. In these chapters there are brought the following parameters and prices of these motors and single-phase and <b>three-phase</b> <b>alternators</b> that can be connected to these engines. Other chapters describe the production of electricity in line with consumption, where the cost per hour to run engines for {{the various types of}} fuel and price of the electricity produced in kilowatt hours is calculated. In the last chapter of the thesis there is described the possibility of accumulation of electrical energy...|$|R
50|$|Originally the {{installation}} had {{a capacity of}} 75 kW DC, provided by five 15 kW dynamos, and 360 kW AC, provided by three 120 kW alternators. The turbines were manufactured by Gilbert Gilkes and Co., whilst the dynamos and alternators were built by Siemens and Co.. All alternating-current (AC) supply was single-phase. By 1906 demand had risen and it became necessary to upgrade the plant. This was done by removing much of the original equipment {{and replacing it with}} four 445 hp Francis turbines manufactured by Kolben and Co. of Prague, each coupled to a single 300 kW <b>three-phase</b> <b>alternator</b> again built by Siemens and Co.. This raised the AC capacity of the station to 1.2 MW. The original DC equipment remained in use.|$|E
50|$|The {{power station}} {{was built by}} the Electric Lighting Department of the Municipal Council of Sydney, and began {{operations}} in 1904 as the Sydney Electric Lighting Station. The original equipment included three Ferranti cross compound reciprocating steam engines, one of 500 horsepower (hp) and two of 1,000 hp, each of which drove a <b>three-phase</b> <b>alternator</b> from Dick, Kerr & Co. for a total output of approximately 1,500 kilovolt-amperes (kVA). In 1905, two additional triple expansion 1,000 hp engines coupled to Dick Kerr 600 kW alternators were commissioned, increasing total capacity to approximately 2,700 KW. Steam was supplied by 5 Babcock & Wilcox WIF chain grate boilers, each 10,000 lb/hr at 160 psi. The five reciprocating engines were relegated to emergency use from 1911 and retired in 1916.|$|E
50|$|In 1907 {{the first}} {{turbines}} were installed, with two 750KW British Westinghouse Parsons 4.4 kV single-phase machines added. The old arc lighting plant was removed {{to provide the}} space. 1908 saw three Allen triple-expansion engines installed, each coupled to 750KW generator and more boilers. A Siemens 4.4MW 6.6 kV <b>three-phase</b> <b>alternator</b> was added in 1913. Next year, two William Robinson 5MW turbo-alternators were added. 1917 saw the further addition of a 6.5MW turbo-alternator from British Westinghouse. This was a three-phase, 6.6 kV 50HZ machine, and ran at 1500RPM. In 1927 four 6MW three-phase 6.6 kV turbo-alternators were installed. At this time all the DC generators were replaced with motor-generators generators. By 1923 there were a total of 20 Babcock water tube boilers, each having a steam capacity of 17,000 lb/hr at 165PSI and 520degF. Smoke was directed into two smoke stacks each 175 feet high.|$|E
50|$|The {{engine is}} {{fitted with a}} starter motor, which is mounted on the {{crankcase}} at the exhaust side with securing clips. It is a 24 V direct current series-wound motor with a rated power of 4 kW. The <b>three-phase</b> current <b>alternator</b> has an electronic control unit. It is mounted on the exhaust side of the engine and is driven by a belt from the crankshaft.|$|R
50|$|The DF11 diesel {{locomotive}} {{is equipped with}} an AC-DC electric transmission, 16V280ZJA diesel engine, 1 <b>three-phase</b> AC synchronous <b>alternator</b> model JF204C, and 6 ZD106 DC traction motors. Maximum braking power from the diesel is , with nominal wheel power at , capable of sustaining operating speeds of up to 160 km/h. Maximum design speed of the Co-Co trucks is 170 km/h. The cab design incorporates a 25° inclination for streamlining. The locomotive microcomputer control system consists of constant power excitation control, cooling, anti-wheel slip transfer control, fault diagnosis display, with full power to test the resistance of dynamic braking system functions, and electro-pneumatic braking system. The DF11 can haul a 640 t passenger train (about 12 cars) up to the maximum balancing speed of 167 km/h on straight track; or a 1100 t train (about 20 cars) to a maximum balancing speed of 143 km/h.|$|R
40|$|Magnetic {{equivalent}} circuits (MECs) {{have been}} employed by many researchers {{to model the}} relationship between magnetic flux and current in electromagnetic systems such as electric machines, transformers and inductors [1],[2]. Magnetic circuits are analogous to electric circuits where voltage, current, resistance and conductance are the respective counterparts of magneto-motive force (MMF), magnetic flux, reluctance and permeance. The solution of MECs can be accomplished with the plethora of techniques developed for electrical circuit analysis. Specifically, mesh analysis, based on Kirchoff’s Voltage Law (KVL), and nodal analysis, based on Kirchoffs Current Law (KCL), are two very common solution techniques. Once an MEC is established, the question is often of which circuit analysis technique should be applied {{in order to minimize}} computational effort. ^ For linear circuits, there is little advantage to using mesh over nodal analysis. Using one method may yield a system with fewer equations, but for most problems the difference in unknowns is insignificant. When analyzing nonlinear magnetic systems, researchers have noted a significant difference in mesh versus nodal analysis. Derbas et al have noted that for nonlinear MECs a mesh analysis reduces the number of iterations required to solve the nonlinear system using a Newton-Raphson method [3]. It was further shown that for strong nonlinearities caused by magnetic saturation, a nodal-based solution will often fail to converge whereas a mesh-based solution will converge. ^ It is relatively easy to apply MEC analysis to stationary magnetic systems. However, modeling electric machinery with MECs can be challenging since the circuit structure can depend on the position of the rotor. Specifically, in the case in which mesh-based solution techniques are applied, the circuit components representing the airgap will tend to infinite values as stator/rotor structures (i. e. teeth) come into and out of alignment. As a result, one must eliminate these elements and establish new KVL loops with the remaining non-infinite components. Researchers have developed algorithms to automate the loop construction process [4]. However, the algorithms require one to categorize all potential overlap positions, which is a challenge for claw-pole machines. One does not experience this issue in nodal-based solution techniques. However, since machines tend to operate in saturation, issues of convergence are often encountered. ^ In this research, an alternative solution technique is provided in which mesh analysis is used in all magnetically nonlinear flux tubes while nodal analysis is used to solve for quantities in the airgap. This has the potential to use the advantage of each solution technique. This research builds upon that presented in [5], in which permeance expressions for all flux tubes were developed for a nodal MEC model of a <b>three-phase</b> claw-pole <b>alternator</b> with a delta-connected stator. In addition to the mixed mesh/nodal system a second focus is to explore new model configurations including six-phase machines with wye-connected stator and permanent magnets on the rotor. Validation of the models that are proposed is performed using both FEA models and experimental data from commercially-available alternators. ...|$|R
50|$|Obtaining a DC supply {{controlled}} by rectifiers requires an AC power source. Consequently, the existing auxiliary generator was {{converted to a}} <b>three-phase</b> <b>alternator</b> with automatic voltage regulator. This arrangement gives improved control of traction current over conventional rheostatic systems and gives fine control when starting a train. Normally the driver has to maintain tractive effort well below the rail adhesion limit to give himself time to respond to wheel slip. The constant current systems of Class 74 were designed to allow the driver to apply power very near the limit of adhesion and the booster output is regulated {{in such a way}} that the maximum current of any traction motor group does not exceed the selected value. Thus, even when one motor (axle, wheel set) starts slipping, the voltage across the whole group of motors cannot rise because current in the non-slipping motors is fixed. As one motor begins to slip, its current consumption drops (electric motors use greatest current when stalled and least while free-running) which provides more current for the non-slipping motor (The current for the group is fixed and therefore shared across the motors in the group). The voltage drops proportionately and the slipping motor now partly deprived of power, begins to slow, the slip stops and everything returns to the state it was in before slip set in. Simply speaking the motors all work as a differentially balanced team so that as one motor begins to slip, the others act to balance everything which reduces the speed of the slipping motor almost 'by magic', but maintains torque at a point just below friction break-away. Recovery of wheel slip (providing the driver is not in-attentive or deliberately attempting to slip) is very rapid. It is this system that allowed the incredible acceleration for which Class 74 was known.|$|E
