Hence, any computer on <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> can send a message to any other computer using its IP address. These messages carry with them the originating computer's IP address allowing for two-way communication. <b>The</b> <b>Internet</b> is thus an exchange of messages between computers.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the growth}} of <b>the</b> <b>Internet,</b> the {{characteristics}} of local area networks (LANs)--computer networks that do not extend beyond a few kilometers—remain distinct.

However, purposefully lacking a direct connection to <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> does not provide assured protection from hackers, military forces, or economic powers.

5|$|For <b>the</b> <b>Internet,</b> the {{physical}} medium and {{data link protocol}} can vary several times as packets traverse the globe. This is because <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> places no constraints on what physical medium or data link protocol is used.

In practice, most intercontinental communication will use the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) protocol (or a modern equivalent) on top of optic fiber. This is because for most intercontinental communication <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> shares the same infrastructure as the public switched telephone network.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>The</b> <b>Internet’s</b> inter-domain routeing {{system has}} evolved {{to keep pace}} with <b>the</b> <b>Internet’s</b> rapid growth, from a few co-operatively managed {{administrative}} domains to a large number of competetive domains. This growth has brought to light one of <b>the</b> <b>Internet’s</b> shortcomings: lack of support for efficient control and management of traffic, particularly between domains. This paper presents an extension to BGP, the inter-domain routeing protocol, that enables congestion to drive route selection and thus allows economic incentives to play their part in traffic distribution. Implementation in a deployed BGP stack is discussed and a simple simulation presented, showing better traffic distribution. ...|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Internet</b> is of {{interest}} to sociologists in various ways; most practically {{as a tool for}} research and as a discussion platform. The sociology of <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> in the broad sense regards the analysis of online communities (e.g. newsgroups, social networking sites) and virtual worlds, thus there is often overlap with community sociology. Online communities may be studied statistically through network analysis or interpreted qualitatively through virtual ethnography. Moreover, organizational change is catalysed through new media, thereby influencing social change at-large, perhaps forming the framework for a transformation from an industrial to an informational society. One notable text is Manuel Castells' <b>The</b> <b>Internet</b> Galaxy—the title of which forms an inter-textual reference to Marshall McLuhan's The Gutenberg Galaxy. Closely related to the sociology of <b>the</b> <b>Internet,</b> is digital sociology, which expands the scope of study to address not only <b>the</b> <b>internet</b> but also the impact of the other digital media and devices that have emerged since {{the first decade of the}} twenty-first century.|$|E
