5|$|Research {{has shown}} that the {{consumption}} of hot chocolate can be positive to one's health. A study conducted by Cornell University {{has shown that}} hot chocolate contains more antioxidants than wine and tea, therefore reducing <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> <b>disease.</b> In a single serving of cocoa, the researchers found 611 milligrams of gallic acid equivalents (GAE) and 564 milligrams of epicatechin equivalents (ECE), compared with 340 milligrams of GAE and 163 milligrams of ECE in red wine, and 165 milligrams of GAE and 47 milligrams of ECE in green tea. Chang Yong Lee, the professor and researcher at Cornell who conducted the study, revealed that larger amounts of antioxidants are released when the beverage is heated.|$|E
5|$|In the {{short-term}} low carbohydrate diets appear better than low fat diets for weight loss. In the long term; however, {{all types of}} low-carbohydrate and low-fat diets appear equally beneficial. A 2014 review found that the heart disease and diabetes risks associated with different diets appear to be similar. Promotion of the Mediterranean diets among the obese may lower <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> <b>disease.</b> Decreased intake of sweet drinks is also related to weight-loss. Success rates of long-term weight loss maintenance with lifestyle changes are low, ranging from 2–20%. Dietary and lifestyle changes are effective in limiting excessive weight gain in pregnancy and improve outcomes for both {{the mother and the}} child. Intensive behavioral counseling is recommended in those who are both obese and have other risk factors for heart disease.|$|E

5|$|Drinking {{more than}} one drink a day for women or two drinks for men {{increases}} <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> <b>disease,</b> high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, and stroke. Risk is greater in younger people due to binge drinking which may result in violence or accidents. About 3.3 million deaths (5.9% of all deaths) {{are believed to be}} due to alcohol each year. Alcoholism reduces a person's life expectancy by around ten years and alcohol use is the third leading cause of early death in the United States. No professional medical association recommends that people who are nondrinkers should start drinking wine. Long-term alcohol abuse can cause a number of physical symptoms, including cirrhosis of the liver, pancreatitis, epilepsy, polyneuropathy, alcoholic dementia, heart disease, nutritional deficiencies, peptic ulcers and sexual dysfunction, and can eventually be fatal. Other physical effects include an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease, malabsorption, alcoholic liver disease, and cancer. Damage to the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system can occur from sustained alcohol consumption. A wide range of immunologic defects can result and there may be a generalized skeletal fragility, in addition to a recognized tendency to accidental injury, resulting a propensity to bone fractures.|$|E

25|$|After {{reports of}} {{research}} finding that dietary oats can help lower cholesterol, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a final rule that allows food companies to make health claims on food labels of foods that contain soluble fiber from whole oats (oat bran, oat flour and rolled oats), noting that 3.0grams of soluble fiber daily from these foods may reduce <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> <b>disease.</b> To {{qualify for the}} health claim, the food that contains the oats must provide at least 0.75grams of soluble fiber per serving.|$|E
25|$|The main active {{ingredient}} of wine is alcohol, and therefore, {{the health effects}} of alcohol apply to wine. Drinking small quantities of alcohol (less than one drink in women and two in men) is associated with a decreased risk of heart disease, stroke, diabetes mellitus, and early death. Drinking more than this amount however, increases <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> <b>disease,</b> high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, and stroke. Risk is greater in younger people due to binge drinking which may result in violence or accidents. About 3.3 million deaths (5.9% of all deaths) are believed to be due to alcohol each year.|$|E
25|$|Mayo Clinic has {{highlighted}} certain oils {{that are}} high in saturated fats, including coconut, palm oil and palm kernel oil.

The US National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute urged saturated fats be replaced with polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats, listing olive and canola oils as sources of healthier monounsaturated oils while soybean and sunflower oils as good sources of polyunsaturated fats. One study showed that consumption of non-hydrogenated unsaturated oils like soybean and sunflower are preferable to the consumption of palm oil for lowering <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> <b>disease.</b>|$|E
40|$|In a large {{prospective}} study {{of cardiovascular disease}} in 7735 middle-aged men—the British Regional Heart Study— the 443 subjects who experienced a major ischaemic heart disease event within 7. 5 years of follow-up were on average 1. 6 cm shorter than the other men (p<. 0. 001). <b>The</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> attack was approximately twice as great in the shortest quintile of men compared with the tallest quintile. When a number <b>of</b> recognized <b>risk</b> factors for ischaemic heart disease were taken into account—age, social class, serum total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, cigarette smoking—there was a marked reduction in <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> attack associated with height.

25|$|Doctors {{have known}} of strong links between fish and healthy hearts {{ever since they}} noticed that {{fish-eating}} Inuit populations in the Arctic had low levels of heart disease. One study has suggested that adding one portion of fish a week to your diet can cut your chances of suffering a heart attack by half. Fish is thought to protect the heart because eating less saturated fat and more omega-3 can help to lower the amount of cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood – two fats that, in excess, increase <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> <b>disease.</b> Omega-3 fats also have natural built-in anti-oxidants, which are thought to stop the thickening and damaging of artery walls. Regularly eating fish oils is also thought {{to reduce the risk}} of arrhythmia – irregular electrical activity in the heart which increases the risk of sudden heart attacks.|$|E
25|$|In 1997, the FDA {{approved}} of {{a claim that}} intake of at least 3.0 g of β-glucan from oats per day decreased absorption of dietary cholesterol and reduced the risk of coronary heart disease. The approved health claim was later amended to include these sources of β-glucan: rolled oats (oatmeal), oat bran, whole oat flour, oatrim, whole grain barley and barley beta-fiber. An example of an allowed label claim: Soluble fiber from foods such as oatmeal, {{as part of a}} diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol, may reduce <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> <b>disease.</b> A serving of oatmeal supplies 0.75 grams of the 3.0 g of β-glucan soluble fiber necessary per day to have this effect. The claim language is in the Federal Register 21 CFR 101.81 Health Claims: Soluble fiber from certain foods and risk of coronary heart disease (CHD).|$|E
25|$|The chief {{reason why}} people with {{diabetes}} develop high blood pressure is hardening of the arteries. Diabetes tends {{to speed up the}} process of atherosclerosis. The other fact about diabetes is that it affects both large and small blood vessels in the body. Over time, blood vessels become clogged with fatty depots, become non-compliant and lose their elasticity. The process of atherosclerosis is a lot faster in diabetic individuals whom do not have good control of their blood sugars. The high blood pressure eventually leads to heart failure, strokes, heart attacks, blindness, kidney failure, loss of libido and poor circulation of blood in the legs. When the blood supply to the feet is compromised, the chances of infections and amputations also increases. All diabetics should know that even mild elevations in blood pressure can be detrimental to health. Studies have shown that diabetics with even a slight elevation in blood pressure have 2-3 times <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> compared to individuals without diabetes.|$|E

500|$|In 1995, a CIAR-funded {{study on}} secondhand smoke {{exposure}} by Peter Lee was published. The tobacco industry {{hoped that the}} study would undermine the validity of a 1981 study by Takeshi Hirayama, which reported a positive association between secondhand smoke and lung cancer risk. The final paper concluded that studies like Hirayama's were subject to misclassification bias, and therefore, had [...] "little scientific basis". In 1995, the journal Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology published two studies funded by the CIAR examining the association between ETS and heart disease. Both studies concluded that ETS exposure from spouses did not increase <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> <b>disease,</b> and that previous conclusions to the contrary were due to publication bias. Both of these studies {{have been criticized for}} suffering from exposure misclassification, because both studies failed to distinguish between current and former smokers. In 2003, a study funded by the center was published in the BMJ. Authored by James Enstrom and Geoffrey Kabat, the study found little association between secondhand smoke and coronary heart disease or lung cancer. This study has been criticized for failing to distinguish between those who were exposed to second-hand smoke and those who were not, because, according to the American Cancer Society, the study's participants were enrolled in 1959, [...] "when exposure to secondhand smoke was so pervasive that virtually everyone was exposed to ETS, {{whether or not they were}} married to a smoker." ...|$|E
