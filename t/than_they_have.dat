5|$|The Sauvignon blanc vine often buds late but ripens early, {{which allows}} it to perform well in sunny climates when not exposed to {{overwhelming}} heat. In warm regions such as South Africa, Australia and California, the grape flourishes in cooler climate appellations such as the Alexander Valley area. In areas where the vine is subjected to high heat, the grape will quickly become over-ripe and produce wines with dull flavors and flat acidity. Rising global temperatures have caused farmers to harvest the grapes earlier <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> in the past.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal's {{first team}} have competed {{in a number}} of national, and {{in the early part of}} the club's history, {{regionally}} contested leagues such as the United League, the Southern District Combination and the London League Premier Division. Their record against each club faced in these discontinued competitions, in addition to the Football League and Premier League is listed below. Arsenal's first Football League match was against Newcastle United, and they met their 85th and most recent different league opponent, A.F.C. Bournemouth, for the first time in the 2015–16 Premier League season. The team that Arsenal have played most in league competition is Manchester United, who they first met in the 1894–95 Football League season; the 81 defeats from 196 meetings is more <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> lost against any other club. Liverpool have drawn 50 league encounters with Arsenal, more than any other club. Arsenal have recorded more league victories against Everton than against any other club, having beaten them 94 times out of 192 attempts.|$|E
5|$|Duke {{regards the}} rivalry as far less {{significant}} than the Carolina–Duke rivalry. The Duke–Michigan rivalry {{is fueled by}} the fact that both institutions strive to be premier academic institutions with solid reputations for producing scholars and student athletes rather than just athletic powerhouses. Duke and Michigan have played one another in men's basketball 30 times. The teams have played twice in the same season three times: 1963–64, 1991–92, and 2008–09. Michigan has played Duke more times <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> any other school outside of the state of Michigan that has never {{been a member of the}} Big Ten Conference. In turn, Duke's 30 games against Michigan are the most they have played any other school outside of the Maryland-Virginia-North Carolina-South Carolina region that has never been a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference. Eight of the meetings between Duke and Michigan have featured opponents both ranked in the top ten in the AP Poll; six times both teams were ranked in the top five. Michigan has not faced any of its fellow conference members as many times with both participants so highly ranked.|$|E

25|$|The game's plot {{revolves}} around a dictator named General Sabio and a missing commander from Spencer's organization, Colonel Brubaker. Spencer {{and a team}} of four other bionics are sent to locate Brubaker and his platoon and help them complete their mission of disarming Sabio's missiles. The team's original mission evolves as the bionics, split into three teams, face opposition greater <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> previously faced. Reception from critics was lukewarm, with the game averaging in the 60% range at aggregate websites GameRankings and Metacritic. Some critics praised the new gameplay mechanics, while others felt that it was a step down from its predecessor.|$|E

25|$|Overall, the Hunter Valley {{has more}} soils (mostly hard, acidic patches of poorly {{draining}} heavy clay) that are unsuitable for viticulture <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> {{areas that are}} ideal for growing grapes. The soils of the Lower Hunter vary widely from sandy alluvial flats (often planted to Semillon), to deep friable loam (often planted with Shiraz) and friable red duplex soils. In the Upper Hunter, the rivers and creeks of the region contribute to the areas black, silty loam soils that are often overlaid on top of alkaline clay loam. Among the hills of the Brokenback range are strips of volcanic basalt that are prized by growers for their tendencies to restrict vigor and concentrate mineral flavours in the grapes.|$|E
25|$|The {{source of}} the Poulter is {{in a region where}} the {{underlying}} geology is an extensive water-bearing porous rock structure called the Magnesian Limestone aquifer. Magnesian limestone is named because if contains quantities of the mineral Dolomite, which is rich in Magnesium. Where this rock reaches the surface, springs often occur, and the Poulter starts at such a spring. Further to the east, the Magnesian Limestone is covered by a layer of porous rock called the Triassic Sherwood Sandstone aquifer, which is the major geological component of the area. Continuing eastwards, both are covered by a layer of Mercia mudstone. The groundwater levels in these aquifers affect whether they supply water to the river system, or take water from it, and levels are lower <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> historically been, {{as a result of the}} extraction of groundwater, particularly for public water supply, and by fracturing of the aquifers as a result of subsidence caused by deep coal mining.|$|E
25|$|A study {{published}} in the journal Science in September 2009 determined that temperatures in the Arctic are higher presently <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> been {{at any time in the}} previous 2,000 years. Samples from ice cores, tree rings and lake sediments from 23 sites were used by the team, led by Darrell Kaufman of Northern Arizona University, to provide snapshots of the changing climate. Geologists were able to track the summer Arctic temperatures as far back as the time of the Romans by studying natural signals in the landscape. The results highlighted that for around 1,900 years temperatures steadily dropped, caused by precession of earth's orbit that caused the planet to be slightly farther away from the sun during summer in the Northern Hemisphere. These orbital changes led to a cold period known as the little ice age during the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. However, during the last 100 years temperatures have been rising, despite the fact that the continued changes in earth's orbit would have driven further cooling. The largest rises have occurred since 1950, with four of the five warmest decades in the last 2,000 years occurring between 1950 and 2000. The last decade was the warmest in the record.|$|E

25|$|With star players, Landry Jones, Ryan Broyles, and Travis Lewis {{coming back}} for the 2011 season, there were high {{expectations}} for Bob Stoops and his Sooner football team. Stoops hired former Sooners quarterback Josh Heupel as offensive coordinator to replace the departed Wilson. OU began the season ranked #1 in both the AP and Coaches polls. The Sooners became the first teams {{to reach the top}} ranking in the Associated Press poll 100 times since the poll began in 1936. Under Stoops, OU has been ranked No. 1 more weeks <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> not been ranked in the top 25. They were able to accomplish this feat without even stepping foot on the field, as they had their bye week this weekend. Their early season match-up with fellow top five team Florida State proved to test the Sooners, as they looked to prove that their #1 ranking was warranted. As the Sooners played well the first few weeks the Sooners were thought {{to be out of the}} National Title race with a heartbreaking loss to the unranked Texas Tech Red Raiders snapping a school-record 39game home win streak. However, the Sooners bounced back the following. few weeks to become ranked fifth in the country despite losing star receiver Ryan Broyles only to lose to Baylor for the first time in school history. They stayed in the hunt for a share of the conference title and a Fiesta Bowl appearance until losing to in-state rival Oklahoma State in the last game of the season. They finished the regular season 9–3 and went on to defeat Iowa 31-14 in the Insight Bowl.|$|E

To match the aggressive attitude and nature of said themes, Draiman told the other band members to create darker, more textural music <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> before.

This album and the band's change in image/musical direction (nu metal/alternative metal) was highly criticized, with critics and fans alike accusing the band of [...] "selling out".

Rick Anderson of Allmusic stated Machine Head was [...] "sounding a bit looser and less constricted musically <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> in the past".
