5|$|Men, I know you’ve {{all been}} waiting to learn what this cruise is about, and why we’re still headed southeast. Now, at last, I can tell you <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> going on the voyage which all submariners have dreamed of ever since they possessed the means of doing so. We have the ship {{and we have the}} crew. We’re going around the world, nonstop. And we’re going to do it entirely submerged.|$|E
5|$|On 19 October Banksy {{released}} another {{video for}} his tour of New York potentially {{to convey the}} movement in nature <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> blind to but it is truly just a vagina with ants crawling out of it.|$|E

50|$|Our {{community}} {{is built on}} trust. At Waring, we students, teachers, parents and administrators {{have a responsibility to}} make our school a creative, productive environment for social and intellectual growth. We shape and maintain our culture, and it requires <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have integrity, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>be</b> honest, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>be</b> caring and <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>be</b> courageous.|$|R
5|$|The {{whole point}} is <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> the song. The self {{is coming from}} a state of pure awareness, {{from the state of}} being. All the rest that comes about in the outward manifestation of the {{physical}} world (including all the fluctuations which end up as thoughts and actions) is just clutter. The true nature of each soul is pure consciousness. So the song is really about transcending and {{about the quality of the}} transcendent.|$|E
5|$|They hold <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> {{guilty of}} murder, {{and with their}} {{aldermanic}} jury's verdict to back them, they would hold a court of Judge Lynch and hang the unfortunate one of us who got into their clutches without an hour's delay, providing they didn't first tear him to pieces...|$|E
5|$|Clement {{argues for}} the {{equality}} of sexes, {{on the grounds that}} salvation is extended to all of mankind equally. Unusually, he suggests that Christ is neither male or female, and that God the Father has both male and female aspects: the eucharist is described as milk from the breast (Christ) of the Father. He is supportive of women playing {{an active role in the}} leadership of the church, and provides a list of women he considers inspirational, which includes both Biblical and Classical Greek figures. It has been suggested that Clement's progressive views on gender as set out in the Paedagogus were influenced by Gnosticism. However, later in the work, he argues against the Gnostics that faith, not esoteric knowledge , is required for salvation. According to Clement, it is through faith in Christ <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> enlightened and come to know God.|$|E

5|$|I {{hope that}} {{all the people who}} see us will be happy in knowing that we, despite being prisoners, {{we were able to do}} this. Before the dancing, our {{problems}} were really heavy to bear. Dancing takes our minds away from our problems. Our bodies became more healthy. As for the judges, they may be impressed with us, seeing <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> being rehabilitated and this could help our case. We are being rehabilitated in a good way.|$|E
5|$|In 1969 {{the large}} Allied Breweries combine {{initiated}} a {{hostile takeover bid}} for Boddingtons, which valued the company at £5million. Charles Boddington took {{the unusual step of}} issuing a spirited defence of the company to the shareholders: You will be only too aware that present-day pressures bear heavily towards the elimination of individuality and character in many consumer goods. There is an inexorable progression towards the mass-produced nationwide product of standardised quality. You, however, are still, at this moment in time, a shareholder in one of the remaining independent brewery companies whose traditional draught beers have a reputation for quality and individual character beyond the immediate area of the North of England in which we operate... The takeover of Boddingtons and its consequent elimination can achieve very little. It will do nothing for the national economy, add nothing to the nation's exports, and contribute nothing at all to the quality of life <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> all used to enjoy.|$|E
5|$|Many human {{diseases}} are not static phenomena, but capable of evolution. Viruses, bacteria, fungi and cancers evolve to be resistant to host immune defences, {{as well as}} pharmaceutical drugs. These same problems occur in agriculture with pesticide and herbicide resistance. It is possible <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> facing {{the end of the}} effective life of most of available antibiotics and predicting the evolution and evolvability of our pathogens and devising strategies to slow or circumvent it is requiring deeper knowledge of the complex forces driving evolution at the molecular level.|$|E
60|$|But when, {{according}} to his desire, we came to turn southward, having passed beyond the second great lake, our men began all to be uneasy, and said <b>we</b> <b>were</b> now {{out of our way}} for certain, for <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> going farther from home, and <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> indeed far enough off already.|$|R

5000|$|After parting {{ways with}} their guitarist the band soon decided to abandon {{all of the}} [...] "Reportage" [...] songs, cancel the Youth sessions, and further explore their new musical {{direction}} with Dom Brown on guitar and Danja producing and co-writing. John was quoted as saying, [...] "we were kind of coming to the decision <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> going {{to let go of}} all of this music, and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> going to let go of songs <b>that</b> <b>we</b> had <b>been</b> working on for months and months. But there was such a thing <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> moving forward, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> creating this new identity."

5|$|Measurements of {{the effects}} of the cosmic {{microwave}} background radiation on the dynamics of distant astrophysical systems in 2000 proved the Copernican principle, that, on a cosmological scale, the Earth is not in a central position. Radiation from the Big Bang was demonstrably warmer at earlier times throughout the universe. Uniform cooling of the CMB over billions of years is explainable only if the universe is experiencing a metric expansion, and excludes the possibility <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> near the unique center of an explosion.|$|E
5|$|No one {{familiar}} {{with the history of}} this country can deny that congressional committees are useful. It is necessary to investigate before legislating, but the line between investigating and persecuting is a very fine one, and the junior Senator from Wisconsin has stepped over it repeatedly. His primary achievement has been in confusing the public mind, as between the internal and the external threats of Communism. We must not confuse dissent with disloyalty. We must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law. We will not walk in fear, one of another. We will not be driven by fear into an age of unreason, if we dig deep in our history and our doctrine, and remember <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> not descended from fearful men—not from men who feared to write, to speak, to associate and to defend causes that were, for the moment, unpopular.|$|E
5|$|On {{the evening}} of the 23rd June 2010, with the support of a posse of faceless men, Julia Gillard deposed the sitting Prime Minister of Australia Kevin Rudd. Gillard {{reportedly}} told Senator Kim Carr <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> sleepwalking to defeat. With the event occurring in the evening, involving red-haired and 'deliberately barren' Gillard goading Rudd into resigning from Head of Government to be replaced by herself, led Julia Gillard to be compared with Lady Macbeth, labelled a witch and be the recipient of misogyny.|$|E

At 3 p.m., Hopkinson called out <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> approaching a junction, and {{in less than a}} minute afterwards, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> hurried into a broad and noble river ... such was the force with which <b>we</b> had <b>been</b> shot out of the Morumbidgee, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> carried nearly to the bank opposite its embouchure, whilst we continued to gaze in silent astonishment on the capacious channel [...] we had entered ...|$|R

5|$|Some {{commentators}} {{suggested the}} discovery and subsequent positive exposure and good morale {{around the city}} contributed to Leicester City F.C.'s shock Premier League victory in 2016. A {{few days after the}} burial, Leicester City began a winning streak to take them from bottom of the league to comfortably avoiding relegation, and they {{went on to win the}} league the following year. Mayor Peter Soulsby said:For too long, people in Leicester have been modest about their achievements and the city they live in. Now - thanks first to the discovery of King Richard III and the Foxes' phenomenal season - it's our time to step into the international limelight.and:It has been said <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> somehow being repaid for burying Richard with honour in our cathedral.|$|E
5|$|The central {{image of}} The Dry Salvages is {{water and the}} sea. The images {{are similar to the}} Odyssey but {{represent}} internal aspects. Humanity loses itself to technology and theories like evolution that separate mankind philosophically from the past. According to Eliot, within each man there is a connection to all of mankind. If we just accept drifting upon the sea, then we will end up broken upon rocks. We are restrained by time, but the Annunciation gave mankind hope that {{he will be able to}} escape. This hope is not part of the present. What we must do is understand the patterns found within the past to see that there is meaning to be found. This meaning allows one to experience eternity through moments of revelation. Through Christ, we are able to overcome time unless we do not know him. Our corruption can be overcome and <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> able to join the eternal.|$|E
5|$|The {{real issue}} is that it moves the moral center more towards the obscene. That it becomes more normal to be more sexually promiscuous, because they are bombarded with imagery that is loaded with innuendo, and that is seen as normal, even preferred... if girls and women find their {{identity}} and self-worth in the approval of people, they will {{do whatever it takes}} to become popular and loved. When stars like Rihanna, who blast sexuality, are thrust into the limelight, girls tend to think that is the way for them to be valuable. God tells us <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> fearfully and wonderfully made... bearing His image. Rihanna is selling a lie.|$|E

50|$|The truth <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> {{being asked}} for My Bonnie {{but no one}} {{actually}} ordered it. Brian would order any record once we had a firm order for it.

60|$|Nothing {{happened}} to disturb us that night, {{and on the}} following morning I was up early making preparations. The despair of the people when they learned <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> going to leave them was something quite pitiable.

5|$|What Arafat {{says about}} me doesn't bother me. Not only he, {{but also a}} whole list of Arab and world {{politicians}} claim that I am an agent of the Zionists or the CIA. Others state that I am a mercenary of the French secret service and of the Soviet KGB. The latest rumor is that I am an agent of Khomeini. During a certain period they said we were spies for the Iraqi regime. Now they say <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> Syrian agents.... Many psychologists and sociologists in the Soviet bloc tried to investigate this man Abu Nidal. They wanted to find a weak point in his character. The result was zero.|$|E

"It means simply <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> {{all taken}} for green-horns, which {{was quite a}} mistake, and <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> to have been {{thoroughly}} cheated--a catastrophe which has happily been prevented.

60|$|This last {{seemed to}} me the wisest course, and despite Saul's grumbling, for he claimed <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> {{wilfully}} wasting time, even {{going so far as}} to hint <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> afraid to really make the trial, we remained within shelter of the foliage near by the dead cottonwood until, I should say ten o'clock in the forenoon.|$|R
60|$|I {{waited until}} they were quite close enough to hear me, and then I hailed them.
