5|$|Dodd {{tried to}} follow in the pattern of New Englanders who have entered the race for the Democratic {{nomination}} and won, including John Kerry, Michael Dukakis, and John F. Kennedy.

He would have been the first Senator to win the presidency while in office since Kennedy was elected in 1960 (that honor ultimately went to Barack Obama).

5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s Van der Byl was willing <b>to</b> <b>endorse</b> <b>the</b> Smith government's {{negotiations}} with moderate black nationalist leaders and rejected attempts by international missions to broker an agreement. He {{served in the}} short-lived government of Zimbabwe Rhodesia in 1979, following the Internal Settlement. After the country's reconstitution as Zimbabwe in 1980, Van der Byl remained in politics and close to Ian Smith; he loudly attacked former RF colleagues who had gone over to support Robert Mugabe. He retired to South Africa after the Mugabe government abolished the parliament seats reserved for whites in 1987, and died in 1999 {{at the age of}} 76.|$|E
5|$|Independently of {{the method}} used to signify royal assent, it is the {{responsibility}} of the Clerk of the Parliaments, once the assent has been duly notified to both houses, not only <b>to</b> <b>endorse</b> <b>the</b> act in the name of the monarch with the formal Norman French formula, but to certify that assent has been granted. The clerk signs one authentic copy of the bill and inserts the date (in English) on which the assent was notified to the two houses after the title of the act. When an act is published, the signature of the clerk is omitted, as is the Norman French formula, should the endorsement have been made in writing. However, the date on which the assent was notified is printed in brackets.|$|E
5|$|On 10 December 1936, Álvarez put the Republic's {{case to the}} League of Nations, further {{demanding}} that the League condemn Italy's and Germany's decision to recognise the Nationalists. He pointed {{to the risk of}} the Spanish war spreading, and suggested that the Non-Intervention Committee was ineffective. This charge was denied by Lord Cranborne and Édouard Viénot, the British and French representatives respectively, who appealed to the League <b>to</b> <b>endorse</b> <b>the</b> mediation plan. The League condemned intervention, urged its council's members to support non-intervention, and commended mediation. It then closed discussion on Spain, leaving it to the Committee. The mediation plan, however, was soon dropped. Britain and France continued to consider, and put forward, plans to prevent foreign volunteers, outside of the Committee.|$|E

5000|$|Hence {{not only}} was there {{uncertainty}} to whether it really was the [...] "Women's World Cup" [...] or not, but <b>the</b> IRB refused <b>to</b> <b>endorse</b> it regardless of its status - the [...] "deferral" [...] (above) was in practice a refusal <b>to</b> <b>endorse</b> as <b>the</b> next scheduled IRB meeting was only days before the event was due to start.

5|$|A year later, he {{was elected}} to the Netherlands' {{national}} parliament, but his first four years in parliament drew little attention. However, his appointment in 2002 as a public spokesman for the VVD led Wilders to become more well known for his outspoken criticism of Islamic extremism. Tensions immediately developed within the party, as Wilders found himself to be to the right of most members, and challenged the party line in his public statements. He was expelled from the VVD parliamentary party, and in September 2004, Wilders left the VVD, having been a member since 1989, to form his own political party, Groep Wilders, later renamed the Party for Freedom. The crunch issue with the VVD party line was about his refusal <b>to</b> <b>endorse</b> <b>the</b> party's position that European Union accession negotiations must be started with Turkey.|$|E
5|$|After the Khmer Republic {{fell to the}} Khmer Rouge on 17 April 1975, a {{new regime}} under its charge, Democratic Kampuchea, was formed. Sihanouk was {{appointed}} as its Head of State, a ceremonial position. In September 1975, Sihanouk briefly returned to Cambodia to inter the ashes of his mother, before going abroad again to lobby for diplomatic recognition of Democratic Kampuchea. He returned on 31December 1975 and presided over a meeting <b>to</b> <b>endorse</b> <b>the</b> constitution of Democratic Kampuchea. In February 1976 Khieu Samphan took him on a tour across the Cambodian countryside. Sihanouk {{was shocked to see}} the use of forced labour and population displacement carried out by the Khmer Rouge government, known as the Angkar. Following the tour, Sihanouk decided to resign as the Head of State. The Angkar initially rejected his resignation request, though they subsequently accepted it in mid-April 1976, retroactively backdating it to 2April 1976.|$|E
5|$|Despite their {{co-operation}} in the AFL-CIO merger, Meany and Reuther had {{a contentious}} relationship for many years. In 1963, Meany and Reuther disagreed about the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, {{a major event}} {{in the history of}} the civil rights movement in the United States. Meany opposed AFL-CIO endorsement of the march. In an AFL-CIO executive council meeting on August 12, Reuther's motion for a strong endorsement of the march was supported by only A. Philip Randolph of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, the titular leader of the march. The AFL-CIO endorsed a civil rights law and allowed individual unions <b>to</b> <b>endorse</b> <b>the</b> march. When Meany heard Randolph's speech after the march, he was visibly moved. Thereafter, he supported the creation of the A. Philip Randolph Institute to strengthen labor unions among African Americans and to strengthen ties with the African American community. Randolph said that he was sure that Meany was morally opposed to racism.|$|E

5|$|In late July {{and early}} August, {{there were two}} more {{attempts}} at resurrecting the Z-4 Plan and the 1994 economic agreement. Talks proposed on 28 July were ignored by the RSK, and last-ditch talks were held in Geneva on 3 August. These quickly broke down as Croatia and the RSK rejected a compromise proposed by Thorvald Stoltenberg, a Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General, essentially calling for further negotiations at a later date. In addition, the RSK dismissed a set of Croatian demands, including to disarm, and failed <b>to</b> <b>endorse</b> <b>the</b> Z-4 Plan once again. The talks were used by Croatia to prepare diplomatic ground for the imminent Operation Storm, whose planning was completed during the Brijuni Islands meeting between Tuđman and military commanders on 31 July. The HV started large-scale mobilization in late July, soon after General Zvonimir Červenko became its new Chief of General Staff on 15 July.|$|E
5|$|On 7 July 1999, the Lomé Peace Accord was signed. Among other provisions, the {{agreement}} mandated an immediate ceasefire between the main {{parties to the}} civil war and the disarmament of the Sierra Leone Army (SLA) and the RUF. It also gave the RUF status as a legitimate political party, a role in the Sierra Leone Government, and four of the twenty-two seats in the cabinet. Foday Sankoh, leader of the RUF, was given responsibility for the diamond mines—an appointment much criticised by observers and the international media given the RUF's history of diamond smuggling. However, Peter Hain, Minister of State for Africa, suggested that the British government had no choice but <b>to</b> <b>endorse</b> <b>the</b> Lomé agreement given the RUF's dominance, and that the only alternative was continued civil war. A military intervention by the United Kingdom in 1999 was ruled out as the British government had received no request for military assistance and felt it lacked the backing of the international community for a unilateral intervention. An intervention was also deemed to be politically and militarily impractical given the British military's involvement with NATO operations in Yugoslavia.|$|E
5|$|President of the RSK Milan Babić refused <b>to</b> <b>endorse</b> <b>the</b> plan; Milošević summoned him to Belgrade where he, Serb {{members of}} the federal presidency, JNA commanders and Bosnian Serb leaders tried to persuade Babić {{to change his mind}} in a 70-hour-long meeting. Despite failing to persuade Babić, Milošević {{arranged}} to have the RSK parliament approve the plan instead. Babić's and Milošević's supporters organized two separate, concurrent sessions of the RSK parliamenteach group proclaiming victory. On 27 February, Babić was removed as RSK president following an intervention by Milošević; he was replaced with Goran Hadžić. Babić opposed the Vance plan because he considered that acceptance of it, and the replacement of the JNA by UNPROFOR, would represent a de facto acceptance of Croatian sovereignty over the territory held by the RSK because the Vance plan treated RSK territory as part of Croatia. Croatia considered the UNPAs part of Croatia and objected to any official recognition of RSK officials within them. It feared the RSK would use the UN mission to consolidate itself within the UNPAs. The Croatian authorities considered that the only parties to the Vance Plan were the authorities in Belgrade, the UN and Croatia.|$|E
