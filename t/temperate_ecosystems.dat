Little changes of soil freezing or thawing may lead to changes in water and heat transition in soils and thus affect the structure and function of ecosystems. SHAW, as a physically based, Land-surface model, provides {{a useful tool for}} understanding and analyzing soil freezing and thawing processes. In this paper, using the measured data of <b>temperate</b> desert <b>ecosystem</b> in Dachaidan assessed the model performance in simulating soil freezing and thawing processes. Comparison of the simulated results by SHAW to the measured data showed that in the initial stage of freezing the simulated frozen depth was thinner than the measured; in the thawing period the simulated thawing rate was higher than the measured due to the overestimated soil temperature below 10 cm; however, for the most cold stage (the stable frozen stage), the simulated matched quite well with the measured. For the maximum frozen depth the simulation only overestimated by as much as 4 %. On the whole, the SHAW model performed satisfactorily. This provides a good base for further application of LSMs to the <b>temperate</b> desert <b>ecosystem</b> on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau...|$|R

50|$|Approximately 78% of earth's {{atmosphere}} is N gas (N2), {{which is an}} inert compound and biologically unavailable to most organisms. In order to be utilized in most biological processes, N2 must be converted to reactive N (Nr), which includes inorganic reduced forms (NH3 and NH4+), inorganic oxidized forms (NO, NO2, HNO3, N2O, and NO3−), and organic compounds (urea, amines, and proteins). N2 has a strong triple bond, and so {{a significant amount of}} energy (226 kcal mol-1) is required to convert N2 to Nr. Prior to industrial processes, the only sources of such energy were solar radiation and electrical discharges. Utilizing a large amount of metabolic energy and the enzyme nitrogenase, some bacteria and cyanobacteria convert atmospheric N2 to NH3, a process known as biological nitrogen fixation (BNF). The anthropogenic analogue to BNF is the Haber-Bosch process, in which fossil fuel H2 is reacted with atmospheric N2 at high temperatures and pressures to produce NH3. Lastly, N2 is converted to NO by energy from lightning, which is negligible in current <b>temperate</b> <b>ecosystems,</b> or by fossil fuel combustion.|$|E
50|$|Community {{genetics}} is {{a recently}} emerged field in biology that fuses elements of community ecology, evolutionary biology, and molecular and quantitative genetics. Antonovics first articulated the vision {{for such a}} field, and Whitham et al. formalized its definition as “The study of the genetic interactions that occur between species and their abiotic environment in complex communities.” The field aims to bridge the gaps {{in the study of}} evolution and ecology, within the multivariate community context that ecological and evolutionary phenomena are embedded within. The documentary movie A Thousand Invisible Cords provides an introduction to the field and its implications. To date, the primary focus of most community genetics studies has been on the influences of genetic variation in plants on foliar arthropod communities. In a wide variety of ecosystems, different plant genotypes often support different compositions of associated foliar arthropod communities. Such community phenotypes have been observed in natural hybrid complexes, among genotypes and sibling families within a single species and among different plant populations. To understand the broader impacts of differences among plant genotypes on biodiversity as a whole, researchers have begun to examine the response of other organisms, such as foliar endophytes, mycorrhizal fungi, soil microbes, litter dwelling arthropods, herbaceous plants and epiphytes. These effects are frequently examined with foundation species in <b>temperate</b> <b>ecosystems,</b> who structure ecosystems by modulating and stabilizing resources and ecosystem processes. The emphasis on foundation species allows researchers to focus on the likely most important players in a system without becoming overwhelmed by the complexity of all the genetically variable interactions occurring at the same time. However, unique effects of plant genotypes have also been found with non-foundation species, and can occur in tropical, boreal and alpine systems.The vision for the field of community genetics extends beyond documentation of different communities on different genotypes of a focal species. Other aspects of this field include understanding how species interactions within a community are modulated by host genotype, implications of host genotype on the fitness and evolution of community members, and selection on hosts influencing associated communities. Future progress in the field of community genetics is strongly dependent on breakthroughs of modern molecular DNA-based technology, such as genome sequencing. The application of a community genetics approach to understanding how species and communities of interacting organisms are reacting to rapid changes in climate, as well as informing restoration, are two important applied aspects of community genetics.|$|E
