5|$|Offshore {{wind power}} is {{captured}} by wind turbines placed out at sea; {{it has the}} advantage <b>that</b> <b>wind</b> speeds are higher than on land, though wind farms are more costly to construct offshore. The first offshore wind farm was installed in Denmark in 1991, and the installed capacity of European offshore wind farms reached 3 GW in 2010.|$|E

5|$|Wind power {{capacity}} has expanded rapidly to 336 GW in June 2014, and {{wind energy production}} was around 4% of total worldwide electric power usage, and growing rapidly. The actual amount of electric power <b>that</b> <b>wind</b> is able to generate is calculated by multiplying the nameplate capacity by the capacity factor, which varies according to equipment and location. Estimates of the capacity factors for wind installations {{are in the range}} of 35% to 44%.|$|E
5|$|A British Wind Energy Association report {{gives an}} average {{generation}} cost of onshore wind power of around 3.2 pence (between US 5 and 6 cents) per kW·h (2005). Cost {{per unit of}} energy produced was estimated in 2006 to be 5 to 6 percent above the cost of new generating capacity in the US for coal and natural gas: wind cost was estimated at $55.80 per MW·h, coal at $53.10/MW·h and natural gas at $52.50. Similar comparative results with natural gas were obtained in a governmental study in the UK in 2011. In 2011 power from wind turbines could be already cheaper than fossil or nuclear plants; {{it is also expected}} <b>that</b> <b>wind</b> power will be the cheapest form of energy generation in the future. The presence of wind energy, even when subsidised, can reduce costs for consumers (€5 billion/yr in Germany) by reducing the marginal price, by minimising the use of expensive peaking power plants.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the biggest}} current {{challenges}} to wind power grid integration in the United States is the necessity of developing new transmission lines to carry power from wind farms, usually in remote lowly populated states {{in the middle of}} the country due to availability of wind, to high load locations, usually on the coasts where population density is higher. The current transmission lines in remote locations were not designed for the transport of large amounts of energy. As transmission lines become longer the losses associated with power transmission increase, as modes of losses at lower lengths are exacerbated and new modes of losses are no longer negligible as the length is increased, making it harder to transport large loads over large distances. However, resistance from state and local governments makes it difficult to construct new transmission lines. Multi state power transmission projects are discouraged by states with cheap electric power rates for fear that exporting their cheap power will lead to increased rates. A 2005 energy law gave the Energy Department authority to approve transmission projects states refused to act on, but after an attempt to use this authority, the Senate declared the department was being overly aggressive in doing so. Another problem is <b>that</b> <b>wind</b> companies find out after the fact that the transmission capacity of a new farm is below the generation capacity, largely because federal utility rules to encourage renewable energy installation allow feeder lines to meet only minimum standards. These are important issues that need to be solved, as when the transmission capacity does not meet the generation capacity, wind farms are forced to produce below their full potential or stop running all together, in a process known as curtailment. While this leads to potential renewable generation left untapped, it prevents possible grid overload or risk to reliable service.|$|E
5|$|Steered by a mid- to {{low-level}} wind flow, {{the depression}} continued west-northwest toward Martinique, decelerating {{in reaction to}} the island's northern mountain range. Satellite images on the afternoon of August14 showed the development of a central dense overcast as greater atmospheric turbulence over the rugged terrain amplified the cyclone's convection; the next reconnaissance flight revealed <b>that</b> <b>wind</b> speeds near the center had increased to gale force. Based on these observations, the NHC upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Cindy around 18:00UTC, at which time the cyclone was located over Martinique with winds of 40mph (65km). Although Cindy briefly developed a favorable outflow, its upper-level structure debilitated after it moved away from the Lesser Antilles, impeding further development. Over the course of August15, Cindy's cloud pattern remained disorganized due to unfavorable wind shear; the center of circulation became ill defined, with the strongest thunderstorms confined to the eastern portion of the cyclone. Despite the unfavorable conditions, the storm managed to strengthen marginally on August16, attaining peak winds of 45mph (75km/h) and a minimum pressure of 1007mbar (hPa; 29.74inHg), roughly 85mi (140km) southeast of Santo Domingo.|$|E

25|$|As of 2007, {{wind energy}} {{represented}} only 1.7% of Illinois's energy production, {{and it was}} estimated <b>that</b> <b>wind</b> power could provide 5–10% of the state's energy needs.
