40|$|<b>Technical</b> <b>instruction</b> in {{eighteenth-century}} Prussia?both {{military and}} civilian? faltered {{for most of}} the century. In the military, promising technical achievements, such Leonhard Euler?s application of the calculus to Benjamin Robins? ballistics, were accompanied by weak institutional settings for training military engineers, with the result that much of the best military technical training continued to take place by apprenticeship. Civilian <b>technical</b> <b>instruction</b> fared better thanks to the expansion of Prussia. Obtaining control over Prussia?s territorial acquisitions in many respects demanded greater technical expertise than the wars that yielded them. This essay argues for the importance of Prussian territorial expansion from 1742, when Prussia acquired Silesia, to the three Polish partitions in 1772, 1793, and 1795, in shaping Prussian <b>technical</b> <b>instruction</b> in civil engineering. Specifically, the geography of the North European Plain?with its marshes and bogs, lakes and lagoons, and numerous waterways? presented formidable challenges, especially in hydraulic engineering. Field experiences in that region were decisive in shaping Prussian civil engineering practices that, {{at the end of the}} century, became the foundation of <b>technical</b> <b>instruction</b> at the Bauakademie, Prussia?s technical school for civil engineering and architecture, established in 1799. The Bauakademie was the earliest predecessor of the Technische Hochschule in Berlin (1879) ...|$|R

He worked with Horace Plunkett in developing the Irish co-operative movement. He was member and honorary secretary to the 1895 Recess Committee {{which led to the}} formation of both the Department of Agriculture and <b>Technical</b> <b>Instruction</b> (DATI), forerunner of the Irish Department of Agriculture, and the Vocational Education Committees (VEC). Gill's key work for the Recess committee was research into the state aid to agriculture in France and Denmark. In February 1900, he was appointed Secretary of the new Department of Agriculture and <b>Technical</b> <b>Instruction</b> in Ireland. In 1907, Gill was appointed Chairman of the Departmental Committee on Irish Forestry.

The Commission's report led to the <b>Technical</b> <b>Instruction</b> Act 1889, which supported local authorities in creating technical schools around the country. He encouraged the reform of primary and secondary state education in London, and helped oversee the merger of the City and Guilds Institute into the newly formed Imperial College of Science and Technology.|$|R

50|$|Another {{innovation}} of Suzuki was to deliberately {{leave out}} {{the large amount of}} <b>technical</b> <b>instructions</b> and exercises found in many beginners' music books of his day. He favored a focus on melodic song-playing over technical exercises, and asked teachers to allow students to make music from the beginning, helping to motivate young children with short, attractive songs which can themselves be used as technique building exercises. Each song in the common repertoire is carefully chosen to introduce some new or higher level of technique than the previous selection.|$|E

To this end the VECs were charged with the duty of setting up and maintaining vocational schools.|$|R

It comprises four parts, in which the attitude of the viol, the notation and the fingerboard in notation and tablature, the decorations and finally bowing are explained.

50|$|In {{order to}} achieve these goals, a variety of {{strategies}} and policies are used rather than legislation. The four strategies the German government bases air pollution control on are laying down environmental quality standards, emission reduction requirements according to the best available technology, production regulations, and laying down emission ceilings. Through these strategies, policy instruments {{have been put in}} place that have contributed {{to the success of the}} significant air pollution reduction in Germany. These instruments include the Federal Emission Control Act and Implementing Ordinances, <b>Technical</b> <b>Instructions</b> on Air Quality Control (TA Luft), Amendment to Ordinance on Small Firing Installations, Implementation of the directive on industrial emissions, and Transboundary air pollution control policy. The German Feed-in-Tariff policy introduced in 2000 led to the significant increase in renewable energy use and decreasing air pollution. They have been introduced in Germany to increase the use of renewables, such as wind power, biomass, hydropower, geothermal power, and photovoltaics, thereby reducing GHG emissions causing air pollution and combating climate change.|$|E
