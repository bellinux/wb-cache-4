40|$|In <b>teflubenzuron</b> and teflubenzuron/chlorfluazuron laboratory-selected sub-populations of a Cameron Highlands (1988) {{strain of}} Plutella xylostella L., {{resistance}} to <b>teflubenzuron</b> reached much greater levels than chlorfluazuron but declined at a correspondingly greater rate to give similar resistance levels after 10 - 13 generations. There was {{little evidence of}} cross-resistance to flufenoxuron and none to hexaflumuron in these populations. Reselection of a Cameron Highlands population with <b>teflubenzuron</b> after 22 generations resulted in a significant (P < 0. 05) increase in resistance after three generations. In two more recently collected strains from lowland Malaysia, Sawi (1991) and Serdang (1992) high levels of resistance to <b>teflubenzuron</b> were found, but only the former showed any apparent resistance to chlorfluazuron. There was also evidence of resistance to diflubenzuron in the Sawi strain (Serdang not examined). Resistance to <b>teflubenzuron</b> appeared to be unstable in unselected sub-populations of both lowland strains. Selection of the Sawi strain with <b>teflubenzuron</b> did not effect cross-resistance to chlorfluazuron, while attempted selection with chlorfluazuron {{had no effect on}} resistance to either compound. Selection of the Sawi strain with diflubenzuron increased resistance to <b>teflubenzuron</b> but had no effect on resistance to chlorfluazuron. In contrast to the Sawi strain, selection of the Serdang strain with <b>teflubenzuron</b> resulted in cross-resistance to chlorfluazuron. Synergist experiments with piperonyl butoxide (PB) and S,S,S-tributyl phosphorotrithioate (DEF) suggested that resistance to <b>teflubenzuron</b> in the lowland strains may involve both microsomal monooxygenases and esterases.

In fourth-instar hosts (L 4), when both parasitoid species were in their final larval instar, <b>teflubenzuron</b> significantly (P 0. 05) effect on C. plutellae, although {{a small proportion of}} the latter were unable to reproduce. Treatment of L 4 hosts with <b>teflubenzuron</b> (> LD 50) had no significant (P > 0. 05) effect on the fecundity of surviving females of D. semiclausum. Similar differential toxicity with <b>teflubenzuron</b> was observed in L 2 hosts, when parasitoids were at the egg or early larval instar stage. There was no apparent increased effect of <b>teflubenzuron</b> on either species of parasitoid when highly resistant (c. 4000 -fold) L 2 hosts (field strain) were treated with concentrations of <b>teflubenzuron</b> two to three orders of magnitude greater than in equivalent experiments with the susceptible host strain. This suggests that host resistance to <b>teflubenzuron</b> confers some protection to both species of parasitoid. Uptake experiments with [C- 14]teflubenzuron showed that accumulation of radioactivity was much greater in D. semiclausum than in C. plutellae and this may account for the differential toxicity observed.

Este estudo teve como objetivo avaliar diferentes inseticidas, reguladores de crescimento, para o controle dessa praga. Os inseticidas {{diflubenzuron}} (15 g i. a. ha- 1), lufenuron (7, 5 g i. a. ha- 1), metoxifenozide (21, 6 g i. a. ha- 1) e <b>teflubenzuron</b> (7, 5 g i. a. ha- 1) foram aplicados com pulverizador costal de precisão, equipado com pontas tipo leque 110, 02, numa pressão de 1 bar e volume de calda de 100 l ha- 1. No dia da aplicação dos inseticidas, as plantas de soja (cv. Fundacep 33) estavam com 0, 90 m de altura, no estádio R 3. 1, e infestação média de 95 lagartas pequenas e de 33 lagartas grandes por dois metros de fileira. A eficiência dos inseticidas foi determinada através da contagem do número de lagartas vivas pequenas e grandes aos 0, 2, 4, 7 e 10 dias após a aplicação (DAA); da percentagem de desfolha aos 15 DAA e da produção de grãos. Foi observado efeito de choque do inseticida metoxifenozide tanto em lagartas pequenas quanto em grandes. Os inseticidas diflubenzuron, lufenuron e <b>teflubenzuron</b> controlaram eficientemente as lagartas a partir de 4 DAA. As infestações de lagartas nas parcelas testemunhas aumentaram a desfolha em 75, 8 % e reduziram produtividade para 2371 kg ha- 1. Nas parcelas tratadas com inseticidas desfolha variou de 34, 7 % a 50, 7 % e a produtividade entre 3255 kg ha- 1 e 3585 kg ha- 1.

Smith, 1797) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) on crop corn, {{in the region of}} Chapadões. They were accomplished in the harvests 2004 / 2005 and 2005 / 2006, surveys of use of insecticides through a questionnaire in 15 properties. Three experiments were developed in Chapadão do Sul (MS) city, in the period from January to December of 2005. The experimental design was randomized blocks with 8 treatments and 4 replicates (experiment 1 and 2) and 7 treatments and 4 replicates (experiment 3). The treatments in the experiment 1 were: 1) control; 2) methomyl (151 g a. i ha- 1); 3) lambdacyhalothrin (7. 5 g a. i ha- 1); 4) thiodicarb (160 g a. i ha- 1); 5) lufenuron (7. 5 g a. i ha- 1); 6) triflumuron (38. 4 g a. i ha- 1); 7) alphacypermethrin + <b>teflubenzuron</b> (12. 7 + 12. 7 g a. i ha- 1) and 8) spinosad (24 g a. i ha- 1). In the experiment 2, the following treatments were used: 1) control; 2) methomyl (151 g a. i ha- 1); 3) lambdacyhalothrin (7. 5 g a. i ha- 1); 4) chlorpyrifos (384 g a. i ha- 1); 5) spinosad (24 g a. i ha- 1); 6) triflumurom (28. 8 g a. i ha- 1); 7) lufenuron (15 g a. i ha- 1) and 8) thiodicarb (240 g a. i ha- 1). The treatments in the experiment 3, in the first and second application were respectively: 1) control; 2) thiodicarb and triflumurom (240 and 28. 8 g a. i ha- 1); 3) lambdacyhalothrin and lufenuron (7. 5 and 15 g a. i ha- 1); 4) alphacypermethrin and <b>teflubenzuron</b> (15 and 15 g a. i ha- 1); 5) metomil and novaluron (151 and 15 g a. i ha- 1); 6) alphacypermethrin + <b>teflubenzuron</b> (12. 7 + 12. 7 g a. i ha- 1) and 7) profenofos + lufenuron (150 + 15 g a. i ha- 1).

40|$|AbstractNewly ecdysed 5 th instar Schistocerca gregaria nymphs were orally {{treated with}} LC 75 of the chitin {{synthesis}} inhibitor <b>teflubenzuron</b> (135 ppm) for 24 h; subsequently they were offered an untreated diet {{for the duration}} of this instar. Ultrastructural observation of the cuticle in 7 day old untreated 5 th instar desert locust nymphs showed that the moulting events had already began. Meanwhile, in treated nymphs of the same age, the ultrastructure of the integument showed that the moulting process was delayed, as no new chitin lamellae of 5 th instar were formed and lamellae of the previous instar were still evident. Furthermore, a protein matrix was observed as a homogenous layer with the lack of chitin and occurrence of vacuoles and abundance of mitochondria. The cuticle dry weight in treated 8 day old nymphs was significantly less than that of the control, (i. e. 8. 5 and 15 mg/nymph, respectively). Furthermore, in 8 day old treated 5 th instar nymphs, chitin and total soluble protein content were 4. 5 and 4. 85 mg/ nymph, respectively. These weights were also highly significantly less than their equivalent control being 8. 5 and 7. 85 mg/nymph for chitin and total soluble protein, respectively. Inhibition in chitin and protein synthesis was calculated to be 88. 9 % and 61. 85 %, respectively, in 8 day old 5 th instar nymphs following their treatment with LC 75 concentration of <b>teflubenzuron...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{comprehensive}} {{knowledge that}} the delayed systemic and reproduction side effects can be even more deleterious than acute toxicity, has caused a shift in focus toward sublethal effects assessment on physiology and behavior of beneficial insects. In this study, we assessed the risks posed by some insecticides with different mode of action through lethal and delayed systemic sublethal effects on the pupation, adult emergence, and reproduction of the chrysopid Chrysoperla externa (Hagen, 1861; Neuroptera: Chrysopidae), an important predator in pest biological control. The maximum field recommended dose (MFRD) and twice (2 xMFRD) for chlorantraniliprole, tebufenozide, and pyriproxyfen were harmless to C. externa. In contrast, all the tested chitin synthesis inhibitors (CSIs) were highly detrimental to the predator, despite of their lack of acute lethal toxicity. Therefore, the safety assumed by using IGRs toward beneficial insects is not valid for chrysopids. Dose-response data showed that although all CSIs have a similar mechanism of action, the relative extent of toxicity may differ (novaluron > lufenuron > <b>teflubenzuron).</b> For CSIs, the delayed systemic effects became obvious at adult emergence, where the predicted no observable effect dose (NOED) was 1 / 2048 of the MFRD for novaluron (0. 085 ng/insect), and 1 / 256 of the MFRD for both lufenuron (0. 25 ng/insect) and <b>teflubenzuron</b> (0. 6 ng/insect). Finally, this work emphasized the significance of performing toxicity risk assessments with an adequate posttreatment period to avoid underestimating the toxicities of insecticides, as the acute lethal toxicity assays may not provide accurate information regarding the long-range effects of hazardous compounds...|$|E

Fungicides {{were used in}} B and C doses {{as well as in}} dose D - 100 times lower than recomended one. The fungi were obtained from soil under potatoes using Galleria mellonella as bait insect. Chlorothalonil and copper oxychloride were chosen from fungicides, linuron, MCPA, fluazifop-P-butyl and dikwat - from herbicides and deltamethrin, <b>teflubenzuron</b> and fozalon from insecticides. The growth of both species of Metarhizium was stronger inhibited than of Paecilomyces fumosoroseus by fungicides however colonies of Metarhizium always overpassed 50 % controls colonies apart from M. flavoviridae on medium with copper oxychloride at concentration B. Herbicide linuron was more toxic to fungi than fungicides. M. anisopliae and M. fluvoviridae did not grow on medium containing dose A and dose B this herbicide but the colonies of P. fumosoroseus at dose B did not overpass 20 % of controlled ones. MCPA and fluazifop-P-butyl inhibited fungal colonies in approximated way. On the medium with these herbicides in concentration A fungal colonies were strongly inhibited and the growth of fungi on medium with MCPA at this concentration appeared not before 5 days after inoculation. Dikwat in dose A strongly inhibited the growth of M. anisopliae but in remaining combinations growth of fungal colonies was similar to controlled ones.
