5000|$|The 96 m {{tower in}} Brabantine Gothic style {{emerged from the}} plans of Jan van Ruysbroek, the court {{architect}} of Philip the Good. By 1454 this tower replacing the older belfry was complete. Above {{the roof of the}} Town Hall, the square <b>tower</b> <b>body</b> narrows to a lavishly pinnacled octagonal openwork. Atop the spire stands a 5-metre-high gilt metal statue of the archangel Michael, patron saint of Brussels, slaying a dragon or devil. The tower, its front archway and the main building façade are conspicuously off-centre relative to one another. According to legend, the architect upon discovering this [...] "error" [...] leapt to his death from the tower. More likely, the asymmetry of the Town Hall was an accepted consequence of the scattered construction history and space constraints.|$|E

They resemble minotaurs, having horned bull's heads, large hooves in place of feet, three-fingered hands, and a <b>towering</b> <b>body</b> structure. The name 'tauren' may be a reference to the Greek 'Taurus' meaning bull, or to the related mythological creature the Minotaur, which has a similar appearance.

In 2007, the government of Ronggui Subdistrict started to repair the Guizhou Wenta again and put up many communal facilities around the tower, for example, the library, the swimming pool and the basketball count. Guizhou Wenta had become a new and nice place to go for the residents in Ronggui Subdistict.|$|R

50|$|The tower’s {{base has}} heavy {{brackets}} above {{the corner of}} the main structure and narrow rectangular windows on the <b>tower</b> <b>body.</b> A group of three arched windows are at the top on each side. A row of small round windows circles the tower between the arched windows and the eave line. Terra cotta decorations embellish the tower and areas of the entablature. The tower has a clock and a set of four bells. The clock and the bells were cast by the McShane Bell Foundry in Baltimore, the same company that cast the Liberty Bell. The bells is 8000 lb of silver bell metal. Hugh Wallace of Tacoma, ambassador to France during World War I, gave the bells and chimes in memory of his daughter on Christmas Day, 1904. The pendulum of the clock, 12 ft in length, is suspended on a single wire, 40 ft in length. The mechanism is gravity run and the motors are wound electrically.|$|E
50|$|The Tower of Unity (German: Turm der Einheit) is a 30 meter high {{observation}} tower on Heldrastein, a rocky mountain belonging to Treffurt in Thuringia. The tower of Unity has an unusual history {{and is also}} from unusual design, because it is additionally guyed by anchoring wires, although it is actually free standing. The tower of Unity was built in 1962 as transmitting tower for a radar station. At {{that time it was}} an open steel lattice tower additionally guyed with the radar facility on its top. The area of this tower was not accessible for tourists at those days as it laid in the restricted area of the former border between West and East Germany. In 1989, when the border was opened, the area became again accessible for the public and the desire developed to build on Heldrastein again an {{observation tower}}, as there was until 1952 an observation tower built of stones, the such called Carl Alexander tower there. In 1996 finally permission for the transformation of the radar tower into an observation tower could be received. In order to do this changes, which cost 205,000 DM, the radome on the top was removed and the <b>tower</b> <b>body</b> was covered with wood. In addition the tower got a stairway with 166 steps and an octagonal shelter at the tower basement.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{development}} of parameterized modeling for ST 8075 tower crane {{is based on}} finite element analysis software SAP 84 and high-level programming language Fortran. According to the Saint-Venant principle, the special beam elements such as rotation joint and connection knots are specially reinforced if they don’t affect force analysis and deformation analysis of the whole structure. The tower crane is built into many small modules, which include balance arms, booms, <b>tower</b> <b>body</b> and so on. The developed program for the tower crane can realize the following functions: inputting the following parameters such as the <b>tower</b> <b>body</b> standard joint number, the boom combination type, working amplitude and hoisting weight, the computer can automatically generate hoisting points and get required crane with any <b>tower</b> <b>body</b> standard joints and booms ’ combination type. According to inputted boom combination type and amplitude, the program will automatically judge the balance weight value applied to the balance arm, apply the balance weight, assure the variable-amplitude vehicle’s position, apply the hoisting load, apply the hanger weight and generate data files. It can calculate tower crane’s force state when the crane is working at various working case such as working state and storm case. After calculating the crane, inner forces can be checked and judged whether the beams {{meet the requirements of}} strength, stiffness and stability.
