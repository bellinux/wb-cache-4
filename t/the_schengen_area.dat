5|$|While Malta cannot {{unilaterally}} {{drop the}} requirement for nations it makes agreements with to obtain visas to enter <b>the</b> <b>Schengen</b> <b>Area</b> through its border crossing points, it is permitted to offer visa discounts to certain nationalities. At present, Malta has 'visa facilitation agreements' with eight nations: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Moldova, Macedonia, Russia, Serbia and Ukraine.|$|E
5|$|Another {{strategic}} Croatian {{foreign policy}} {{goal for the}} 2000s was NATO membership. Croatia {{was included in the}} Partnership for Peace in 2000, invited to NATO membership in 2008 and formally joined the alliance on 1 April 2009. Croatia {{became a member of the}} United Nations Security Council for the 2008–2009 term, assuming presidency in December 2008. The country is preparing to join <b>the</b> <b>Schengen</b> <b>Area.</b>|$|E
5|$|Because the UK is {{not part}} of <b>the</b> <b>Schengen</b> <b>Area,</b> and because Belgium and France {{are not part of the}} Common Travel Area, all Eurostar {{passengers}} must go through border controls. Both the British Government and the Schengen governments concerned (Belgium and France) have legal obligations to check the travel documents of those entering their respective countries (as well as those leaving, in the case of Belgium and France).|$|E
50|$|The table below {{includes}} Bulgaria, Croatia and Romania (which apply <b>the</b> <b>Schengen</b> <b>Area's</b> visa list), but excludes {{states which}} do not allow any Annex II nationals to work during their visa-free stay, namely: Austria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Portugal and Spain.|$|R
5000|$|The European Parliament {{adopted a}} {{resolution}} on 8 July 2010 calling on {{all member states}} to recognise Kosovo. [...] In October 2010, an envoy of the European Parliament suggested that lack of recognition by some countries {{would not be an}} obstacle to Kosovo joining <b>the</b> <b>Schengen</b> <b>area's</b> visa-free regime.|$|R
50|$|European Union {{citizens}} of <b>the</b> <b>Schengen</b> Treaty <b>area</b> {{can enter the}} islands freely, while those from other regions need identification.|$|R
5|$|European Union {{citizens}} {{have the right}} to travel freely into Malta without completing any special formalities. The nationals of many countries are not required to hold visas to enter Malta, although many are in accordance with uniform European Union regulations. A full list of nationalities required to hold visas to enter Malta and <b>the</b> <b>Schengen</b> <b>Area</b> is published on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' web site.|$|E
5|$|The Svalbard Treaty of 1920 recognizes Norwegian sovereignty, and the 1925 Svalbard Act made Svalbard a full {{part of the}} Kingdom of Norway. The {{archipelago}} is administrated by the Governor of Svalbard, {{which is}} subordinate to the Norwegian Ministry of Justice and the Police. Unlike the rest of Norway (including Jan Mayen), Svalbard is a free economic zone and a demilitarized zone, and {{is not part of}} <b>the</b> <b>Schengen</b> <b>Area</b> nor the European Economic Area.|$|E
5|$|The Federal Republic of Germany was a {{founding}} member of the European Economic Community in 1957 and the European Union in 1993. It is part of <b>the</b> <b>Schengen</b> <b>Area,</b> and became a co-founder of the Eurozone in 1999. Germany is a member of the United Nations, NATO, the G7 (formerly G8), the G20, and the OECD. The national military expenditure is the 9th highest in the world. Known for its rich cultural history, Germany has been continuously the home of influential and successful artists, philosophers, musicians, sportspeople, entrepreneurs, scientists, engineers, and inventors.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Schengen</b> acquis {{is a set}} {{of rules}} and legislation, {{integrated}} into European Union law, which regulate the abolishment of border controls at the internal borders within <b>the</b> so-called <b>Schengen</b> <b>Area</b> and <b>the</b> strengthening of border controls at the external borders.|$|R
50|$|After {{joining the}} European Union on 1 July 2013, Croatia adopted <b>the</b> common <b>Schengen</b> design for {{passport}} stamps, even though Croatia {{is still not}} a member of <b>the</b> <b>Schengen</b> passport-free <b>area.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In 1985, {{the member}} states of the European Union {{ratified}} <b>the</b> <b>Schengen</b> Agreement, a quasi-Treaty that abolished {{the vast majority of}} border controls within <b>the</b> so-called <b>Schengen</b> <b>Area.</b> This process enabled freedom of labour movement across <b>the</b> <b>Schengen</b> Zone, in <b>the</b> spirit of furthering a Common Market and a free trade area.|$|R
5|$|Eurostar {{passengers}} travelling inside <b>the</b> <b>Schengen</b> <b>Area</b> (Brussels-Lille or Brussels-Calais; Lille-Calais {{trips are}} not allowed) {{pass through a}} separate corridor in Brussels bypassing border checks, and enter carriage 18 of the train, which is reserved for these passengers. This arrangement was set up after numerous illegal immigrants entered the UK without {{the right to do}} so, by buying a ticket from Brussels to Lille or Calais but remaining on the train until London – an issue exacerbated by Belgian police threatening to arrest UK Border Agency staff at Brussels-Midi if they tried to prevent passengers whom they suspected of attempting to exploit this loophole from boarding Eurostar trains.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, Switzerland avoids alliances {{that might}} entail military, political, or direct {{economic}} action {{and has been}} neutral {{since the end of}} its expansion in 1515. Its policy of neutrality was internationally recognised at the Congress of Vienna in 1815. Only in 2002 did Switzerland become a full member of the United Nations {{and it was the first}} state to join it by referendum. Switzerland maintains diplomatic relations with almost all countries and historically has served as an intermediary between other states. Switzerland is not a member of the European Union; the Swiss people have consistently rejected membership since the early 1990s. However, Switzerland does participate in <b>the</b> <b>Schengen</b> <b>Area.</b>|$|E
5|$|Located in the Białystok Uplands of the Podlaskie Plain on {{the banks}} of the Biała River, Białystok ranks second in terms of {{population}} density, eleventh in population, and thirteenth in area, of the cities of Poland. It has historically attracted migrants from elsewhere in Poland and beyond, particularly from Central and Eastern Europe. This is facilitated by the fact that the nearby border with Belarus is also the eastern border of the European Union, as well as <b>the</b> <b>Schengen</b> <b>Area.</b> The city and its adjacent municipalities constitute Metropolitan Białystok. The city has a , characterized by warm summers and long frosty winters. Forests are an important part of Białystok's character, and occupy around 1,756 ha (4,340 acres) (17.2% of the administrative area of the city) which places it as the fifth most forested city in Poland.|$|E
5000|$|On 15 March 2017 the President of Armenia, Serzh Sargsyan {{announced}} that Armenia will launch {{talks with the}} European Union over establishing visa-free travel for Armenian citizens into <b>the</b> EU's <b>Schengen</b> <b>Area</b> soon.|$|R
5000|$|The European Border and Coast Guard Agency (EBCG), {{commonly}} called Frontex (from French: Frontières extérieures for [...] "external borders"), is an {{agency of the}} European Union headquartered in Warsaw, Poland, tasked with border control of <b>the</b> European <b>Schengen</b> <b>Area,</b> in coordination with the border and coast guards of <b>Schengen</b> <b>Area</b> member states.|$|R
2500|$|... 28 European {{states are}} members of the politico-economic European Union, 26 of <b>the</b> border-free <b>Schengen</b> <b>Area</b> and 19 of the {{monetary}} union Eurozone. Among the smaller European organizations are the Nordic Council, the Benelux, the Baltic Assembly and the Visegrád Group.|$|R
5|$|The {{police also}} have the {{responsibility}} for prisoner transport during detention, including transport to and from court. The police serve as border guards for the outer border of <b>the</b> <b>Schengen</b> <b>Area.</b> The busiest are Oslo Airport, Gardermoen, which has 130 man-years tied to it, Storskog on the Russian border and Sandefjord Airport, Torp. These are the only borders with designated border employees—all other are manned with regular officers. The police is not responsible for customs, which {{is the responsibility of}} the Norwegian Customs and Excise Authorities. Norway participates in a series of international police cooperation, such as Interpol, Europol, the Schengen Information System, Frontex, and the Baltic Sea Task Force on Organized Crime. Norway also has a close cooperation with the other Nordic police forces. The Norwegian Police Service occasionally participates in international operations.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} people who visited Malta in 2009 dropped {{considerably}} compared to the figures for 2008 - overall, the country's tourism industry suffered an 8 percent drop from 2008. Visits from non-European Union countries dropped more considerably than visits from European Union countries (and even more so than visits from Eurozone countries), while the average stay length remained the same for both 2008 and 2009. Visitors from most countries require a visa to visit Malta. The nationalities requiring a visa are standardised as per European Union rules. Visitors already holding a valid Schengen Area visa most likely will not need to complete any more formalities to enter Malta (so long as they are already inside <b>the</b> <b>Schengen</b> <b>Area).</b> Visitors holding citizenship of the European Union do not require a visa to enter Malta as they hold the right to free movement within the European Union. In recent years, the country's tourism industry has been faced with a number of issues relating to the nation's small size, both in terms of area and population. These issues include stretched resources and infrastructure (such as water, waste management, beaches and roads), especially during the summer months of July and August.|$|E
25|$|In addition, a New Zealand {{citizen who}} has already spent up to 3 months {{in other parts of}} <b>the</b> <b>Schengen</b> <b>Area</b> can enter Hungary and remain there for up to a further 90 days visa-free. Following the stay in Hungary, if 3 months has already spent {{elsewhere}} in <b>the</b> <b>Schengen</b> <b>area,</b> he/she must then leave <b>the</b> <b>Schengen</b> <b>area</b> from Hungary and go directly to a country outside <b>the</b> <b>Schengen</b> <b>Area.</b>|$|E
25|$|Although the United Kingdom is {{not part}} of <b>the</b> <b>Schengen</b> passport-free <b>area,</b> it still uses <b>the</b> <b>Schengen</b> Information System, a {{governmental}} database used by European countries to store and disseminate information on individuals and property. This allows the UK to exchange information with countries that are a part of <b>the</b> <b>Schengen</b> agreement, often for the sake of liaising over law enforcement.|$|R
5000|$|The {{countries}} that apply <b>the</b> <b>Schengen</b> Agreement (<b>Schengen</b> <b>Area,</b> {{a subset of}} the EEA) do not implement passport controls between each other, unless exceptional circumstances occur. It is, however, mandatory to carry a passport, compliant national identity card or alien's resident permit.|$|R
50|$|The UK is {{a member}} of the European Union, but it has an opt-out from <b>the</b> <b>Schengen</b> border-free <b>area.</b> It {{operates}} its own visa policy and also maintains the Common Travel Area with the Republic of Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man.|$|R
25|$|While {{nominally}} part of <b>the</b> <b>Schengen</b> <b>Area,</b> Spain performs {{identity checks}} on all sea and air passengers leaving the enclaves for elsewhere in <b>the</b> <b>Schengen</b> <b>Area.</b>|$|E
25|$|During June 2011 Croatia {{began with}} {{implementation}} of the projects and reforms required to join <b>the</b> <b>Schengen</b> <b>Area</b> by 2015. By joining <b>the</b> <b>Schengen</b> <b>Area,</b> border checks will be eliminated at the land border with Hungary and Slovenia, {{as well as at}} airports and ports for flights and ships to/from Schengen member states, thus facilitating the freer movement of persons between Croatia and the rest of <b>the</b> <b>Schengen</b> <b>Area.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{visa policy}} of <b>the</b> <b>Schengen</b> <b>Area</b> is {{set by the}} European Union and applies to <b>the</b> <b>Schengen</b> <b>Area</b> and to other EU member states without the opt-outs enjoyed by Ireland and the UK. If someone other than a European Union, European Economic Area (EEA) or Swiss citizen wishes to enter <b>the</b> <b>Schengen</b> <b>Area,</b> Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus or Romania they must have a visa or be a {{national}} of a visa-exempt country.|$|E
50|$|Over the years, the EU has {{developed}} a wide competence {{in the area of}} justice and home affairs. To this end, agencies have been established that co-ordinate associated actions: Europol for co-operation of police forces, Eurojust for co-operation between prosecutors, and Frontex for co-operation between border control authorities. The EU also operates <b>the</b> <b>Schengen</b> Information System which provides a common database for police and immigration authorities throughout <b>the</b> borderless <b>Schengen</b> <b>Area.</b>|$|R
50|$|Diplomatic {{relations}} between Germany and Switzerland are Switzerland's closest. Between Switzerland and Germany; and between Switzerland and the European Union (EU), of which Germany is a member, {{there are over}} 200 agreements. Switzerland {{is also part of}} <b>the</b> EU's <b>Schengen</b> <b>Area</b> which abolishes international borders between Schengen states.|$|R
5000|$|... The European Commission asked Romania {{to accept}} 6,351 {{refugees}} under an EU quota scheme.

25|$|In December 1996 two non-EU member states, Norway and Iceland, {{signed an}} {{association}} {{agreement with the}} signatories of the Agreement {{to become part of}} <b>the</b> <b>Schengen</b> <b>Area.</b> While this agreement never came into force, both countries did become part of <b>the</b> <b>Schengen</b> <b>Area</b> after concluding similar agreements with the EU. The Schengen Convention itself was not open for signature by non-EU member states. In 2009, Switzerland finalised its official entry to <b>the</b> <b>Schengen</b> <b>Area</b> with the acceptance of an association agreement by popular referendum in 2005.|$|E

25|$|Juxtaposition of the Greek {{sovereign}} debt default, mass-exodus migration crisis within <b>the</b> <b>Schengen</b> free-movement <b>area,</b> deft geopolitical manoeuvring by a resurgent Russia, Brexit, and high-profile cases of corporate fraud have severely dented European Union's {{standing in the}} world and raised questions about Europe's ability to manage problems at home.|$|R
50|$|Italy is Switzerland's {{second largest}} trading partner and Switzerland is Italy's 8th largest {{investor}} (CHF 22bn) creating 78,000 jobs.
