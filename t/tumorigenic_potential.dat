Methods: Oralspheres was applied to isolate OCSC. aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 activity and CD 44 positivity of OCSC with luteolin treatment were assessed by flow cytometry analysis. Radio-sensitivity of OCSC treated with luteolin was examined. Invasion and colony-forming assays were performed to assess oncogenicity in OCSC. The expression of interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) /signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT 3) was examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and western blot analysis. Results: We showed that luteolin effectively inhibited the proliferation rate, self-renewal, aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 activity, and CD 44 positivity of OCSC but did not cause significant cytotoxicity of normal epithelial cells. Moreover, luteolin restored radio-sensitivity in OCSC. Combined treatment with luteolin and radiation displayed synergistic effect on invasiveness and clonogenicity of OCSC. Mechanistically, treatment of luteolin resulted in inactivation of IL- 6 /STAT 3 signaling. Conclusion: These results suggest that combined treatment of luteolin and radiation therapy can attenuate tumorigenicity of OCSC through IL- 6 /STAT 3 signaling inactivation...|$|R
40|$|Breast {{cancer is}} the leading cause of cancer-related {{mortality}} for females worldwide [1]. Improving early screening strategies and understanding the events that lead to tumor initiation have led to demonstrable improvements in clinical outcome. Our previous work revealed a variance in the tumorigenic capacity between different mammary epithelial cell populations in an MMTV-ErbB 2 mouse model. In order to greater understand how different mammary epithelial cells influence the tumorigenic capacity in ErbB 2 -induced breast cancer, we transplanted different cell populations from pre-neoplastic MMTV-ErbB 2 female mice into recipient mice for tumorigenic study. We found that different mammary epithelial cells bear different <b>tumorigenic</b> <b>potentials</b> even when induced by the same ErbB 2 proto-oncogene. To understand the difference in tumors formed from different epithelial cells, we performed gene expression profiling using these tumors (GSE 64487). Several genes were further validated using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Here we provide further details on the experimental methods and microarray analysis.

5000|$|Homozygous {{deletion}} of the 1p36 locus, {{which contains}} several candidate tumor suppressor genes, occurs in approximately 5% of glioblastoma (GBM), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cholangiocarcinoma. Deletion {{of this region}} often includes deletion of several passenger genes, including ENO1, which has been identified to confer collateral lethality with subsequent inhibition of its redundant paralogue ENO2. ENO1 encodes the major enolase isoform, accounting for >90% of cellular enolase activity. Enolase is responsible for conversion of 2-phosphoglycerate (2-PGA) to phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) in glycolysis. Cancer cells could be especially sensitized to inhibition of this pathway due to their frequent shift toward glycolysis, known as the 'Warburg effect'. Knockdown of ENO2 by shRNA inhibited growth, survival, and <b>tumorigenic</b> <b>potential</b> of ENO1-null cell lines over ENO1-intact cells. Additionally, the enolase inhibitor PhAH, with half-maximal inhibitory (IC50) concentrations around 20 nM, proved to be selectively toxic to ENO1-null cells over ENO1-intact cells or normal human astrocytes. Although this inhibitor did not show selective inhibition of the ENO1 isoform over ENO2, higher toxicity toward ENO1-null cells is explained by the decreased overall enolase expression in these cell lines, which only retain about 10% of their normal enolase activity. [...] SF2312, a natural antibiotic produced by Micromonospora and active against bacteria under anaerobic conditions, was also {{shown to be a}} potent inhibitor of enolase, with (IC50) concentrations ranging from 10-50 nM. This inhibitor exhibited increased potency toward ENO2 over ENO1 at concentrations above its IC50. Further, a strong selective toxicity of SF2312 toward multiple ENO1-deleted cell lines was observed; these effects were not observed in ENO1-rescued cells, were increased after SF2312 treatment compared to PhAH treatment, and were more potent during hypoxia. Cell death and inhibition of proliferation in SF2312 treated ENO1-deleted cells were preceded by a decrease in ATP and other high-energy phosphates, and the conversion of glucose to lactate was inhibited. These effects are consistent with the impacts of enolase inhibition upon glycolysis, and were reversible by ENO1 re-expression or ENO2 overexpression. Thus, pharmacological targeting of ENO2 offers a promising therapeutic target for cancers harboring ENO1 deletions, due to the redundancy and cell-essential function of these genes.|$|E

It {{is important to}} know whether cancer cells with higher <b>tumorigenic</b> <b>potential,</b> such as cancer stem cells, are only a small subpopulation. We attempt to address the question of variability in <b>tumorigenic</b> <b>potential</b> based on the heterogeneity in apoptosis resistance of cancer cells. We use stochastic differential equations and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations to explore the mechanisms that generate cell-to-cell variability in apoptosis resistance of cancer cells. In our model, a simplified scheme of apoptosis signaling reactions is developed focusing on the proapoptotic Bid-Bax reaction and its inhibition by Bcl- 2 like antiapoptotic proteins. We show how a combination of low probability Bid-Bax reaction along with overexpressed reactant molecules allows specific killing of cancer cells, especially under targeted therapy such as Bcl- 2 inhibition. This low probability Bid-Bax reaction protects normal cells from accidental apoptosis but generates cell-to-cell stochastic variability in apoptotic activation of cells equipped with overexpressed Bid and Bax molecules. We further demonstrate that cellular variations in Bcl- 2 / Bax ratio, within a cancer cell population, can affect the intrinsic fluctuations arising from the stochastic Bid-Bax reaction and thereby provides a mechanism for origin of cells with higher <b>tumorigenic</b> <b>potential.</b> We discuss the implications of our results for cancer therapy, such as, optimal strategies to minimize stochastic fluctuations in cancer cell death.

40|$|A {{significant}} {{challenge for}} the development of safe pluripotent stem cell-based therapies is the incomplete in vitro differentiation of the pluripotent stem cells and the presence of residual undifferentiated cells initiating teratoma development after transplantation in recipients. To understand the mechanisms of incomplete differentiation, a comparative study of retinoic acid-induced differentiation of mouse embryonic stem (ES) and teratocarcinoma (EC) cells was conducted. The present study identified differences in proliferative activity, differentiation, and <b>tumorigenic</b> <b>potentials</b> between ES and EC cells. Higher expression of Nanog and Mvh, as well as Activin A and BMP 4, was found in undifferentiated ES cells than in EC cells. However, the expression levels of Activin A and BMP 4 increased more sharply in the EC cells during retinoic acid-induced differentiation. Stimulation of the Activin/Nodal and BMP signaling cascades and inhibition of the MEK/ERK and PI 3 K/Act signaling pathways resulted in a significant {{decrease in the number of}} Oct 4 -expressing ES cells and a loss of tumorigenicity, similar to retinoic acid-stimulated EC cells. Thus, this study demonstrates that a differentiation strategy that modulates prodifferentiation and antiproliferative signaling in ES cells may be effective for eliminating tumorigenic cells and may represent a valuable tool {{for the development of}} safe stem cell therapeutics...|$|R
40|$|Previously, we {{identified}} {{a group of}} replication-competent exogenous mouse mammary tumor viruses that failed to induce mammary tumors in susceptible mice. Sequence comparison of tumorigenic and tumor-attenuated virus variants has linked the ability of virus to cause high-frequency mammary tumors to the gag gene. To determine the specific sequences within the gag gene that contribute to tumor induction, we constructed five distinct chimeric viruses that have various amino acid coding sequences of gag derived from a tumor-attenuated virus replaced by those of highly tumorigenic virus and tested these viruses for tumorigenic capacities in virus-susceptible C 3 H/HeN mice. Comparing the <b>tumorigenic</b> <b>potentials</b> of these viruses has allowed us to map the region responsible for tumorigenesis to a 253 -amino-acid region within the CA and NC regions of the Gag protein. Unlike C 3 H/HeN mice, BALB/cJ mice develop tumors when infected with all viral variants, irrespective of the gag gene sequences. Using genetic crosses between BALB/cJ and C 3 H/HeN mice, {{we were able to}} determine that the mechanism that confers susceptibility to Gag-independent mammary tumors in BALB/cJ mice is inherited as a dominant trait and is controlled by a single gene, called mammary tumor susceptibility (mts), that maps to chromosome 14...|$|R
40|$|Human {{papillomavirus}} (HPV) {{infection is}} associated with non-smoking female lung cancer. Our previous report demonstrated that HPV 16 promotes lung tumor cell progression by up-regulating interleukin- 17 (IL- 17). IL- 17 and its downstream signaling mediator, interleukin- 8 (IL- 8), have been implicated to modulate a variety of pro-angiogenic factors and play important roles in tumor angiogenesis and metastasis. Accordingly, we hypothesized that HPV infection may potentiate tumorigenic and metastatic characteristics of the infected cells through IL- 8. The goal {{of the present study}} was to determine whether HPV infection in lung adenocarcinoma cells can promote the expression of IL- 8 and metalloproteinases (MMPs) to make the transformed cells equipped with angiogenic and metastatic characteristics. The expression of IL- 8 and MMPs in HPV 16 E 6 -transfected H 1299 cells was analyzed to examine the hypothesis. HPV 16 E 6 up-regulates pro-angiogenic MMP- 2 and MMP- 9 through inducing IL- 8 expression in lung cancer cells. The results indicate that, in addition to cell proliferation-related machinery, HPV infection promotes the expression and activities of angiogenic and metastatic molecules in lung adenocarcinoma cells. The cytokines induced by HPV infection may work together to confer the malignant and <b>tumorigenic</b> <b>potentials</b> on the infected cells by promoting machineries of growth, angiogenic and metastatic characteristics...|$|R

Within these cells, EBV-mediated inhibition of apoptosis correlates with an up-regulation of BCL- 2 levels in concert with a down-regulation in c-MYC expression that occurs under growth-limiting conditions. Here we addressed whether EBV's effects on apoptosis and tumorigenicity are mediated by the EBV small RNAs EBER- 1 and EBER- 2. Stable expression of the EBERs in EBV-negative Akata BL cells, at levels comparable to those in EBV-positive cells, significantly enhanced the <b>tumorigenic</b> <b>potential</b> of EBV-negative BL cells in SCID mice, but did not fully restore tumorigenicity relative to EBV-positive Akata cells. Furthermore, wild-type or greater levels of EBER expression in EBV-negative Akata cells did not promote BL cell survival. These data therefore suggest that EBV can contribute to BL through at least two avenues: an EBER-dependent mechanism that enhances <b>tumorigenic</b> <b>potential</b> independent of a direct effect on apoptosis, and a second mechanism, mediated by an as-yet-unidentified EBV gene(s), that offsets the proapoptotic consequences of deregulated c-MYC in BL...|$|E

We found that among 17 lichens species, F. cucullata exhibited the most potent cytotoxicity in several human cancer cells. High performance liquid chromatography analysis revealed that the acetone extract of F. cucullata contains usnic acid, salazinic acid, Squamatic acid, Baeomycesic acid, d-protolichesterinic acid, and lichesterinic acid as subcomponents. MTT assay showed that cancer cell lines were more vulnerable to the cytotoxic effects of the extract than non-cancer cell lines. Furthermore, among the identified subcomponents, usnic acid treatment had a similar cytotoxic effect on cancer cell lines but with lower potency than the extract. At a lethal dose, treatment with the extract or with usnic acid greatly increased the apoptotic cell population and specifically activated the apoptotic signaling pathway; however, using sub-lethal doses, extract and usnic acid treatment decreased cancer cell motility and inhibited in vitro and in vivo <b>tumorigenic</b> <b>potentials.</b> In these cells, we observed significantly reduced levels of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers and phosphor-Akt, while phosphor-c-Jun and phosphor-ERK 1 / 2 levels were onl...|$|R

We {{studied the}} expression and regulation of SPR 1 {{in a series}} of human bronchial epithelial cell lines representing a model of multistep bronchial carcinogenesis. These cell lines included a primary culture of tracheobronchial epithelial cells (HTBE), a papilloma virus–transformed tracheobronchial epithelial cell line (HBE 1), a cell line selected from HBE 1 by a tobacco carcinogen and a phorbol ester (HBE 1 -C), a simian virus–transformed bronchial epithelial cell line (BEAS- 2 B), and a lung carcinoma cell line (H 460). Different <b>tumorigenic</b> <b>potentials</b> of these cell lines were indicated by graded levels of telomerase activity. Concomitant with squamous transformation, there was an increase in SPR 1 expression in HTBE, HBE 1, and HBE 1 -C that was reversible by vitamin A.

In these latter cell lines representing advanced malignant transformation, there was a loss of up- and downregulation, respectively, by the phorbol ester and vitamin A. Transfection study with chimeric constructs of the SPR 1 promoter and a reporter gene showed that the dysregulation of SPR 1 expression in malignant transformation was a result of perturbation of the basal and enhancer elements of the first 162 nucleotides in the 5 �-flanking promoter region of the SPR 1 gene.

A major goal of ongoing research is to better understand the early stages of tumorigenesis and to establish the genetic and environmental changes that underlie MB initiation and growth. However, studies of MB progression in mouse models are difficult due to the heterogeneity of tumor onset times and growth patterns and the lack of clinical symptoms at early stages. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is critical for noninvasive, longitudinal, three-dimensional (3 D) brain tumor imaging in the clinic but is limited in resolution and sensitivity for imaging early MBs in mice. In this study, high-resolution (100 μm in 2 hours) and high-throughput (150 μm in 15 minutes) manganese-enhanced MRI (MEMRI) protocols were optimized for early detection and monitoring of MBs in a Patched- 1 (Ptch 1) conditional knockout (CKO) model. The high tissue contrast obtained with MEMRI revealed detailed cerebellar morphology and enabled detection of MBs over a wide range of stages including pretumoral lesions as early as 2 to 3 weeks postnatal with volumes close to 0. 1 mm 3. Furthermore, longitudinal MEMRI allowed noninvasive monitoring of tumors and demonstrated that lesions within and between individuals have different <b>tumorigenic</b> <b>potentials.</b> 3 D volumetric studies allowed quantitative analysis of MB tumor morphology and growth rates in individual Ptch 1 -CKO mice.

Screening a λgt 11 cDNA expression library with a 9 ORF 1 protein probe yielded a novel cellular PDZ domain-containing protein, 9 BP- 1, which binds to wild-type, but not a transformation-defective, C-terminal, mutant 9 ORF 1 protein. The fact that PDZ domains complex with specific sequences at the free C-terminal end of some proteins led to the recognition that the 9 ORF 1 C-terminal region contained such a consensus-binding motif. This discovery prompted investigations into whether the 9 ORF 1 protein associates with additional cellular proteins having PDZ domains. It {{was found that the}} 9 ORF 1 protein interacts directly, in vitro and in vivo, with the PDZ domain-containing protein hDlg/SAP 97 (DLG), which is a mammalian homolog of the Drosophila discs large tumor suppressor protein and which also binds the adenomatous polyposis coli tumor suppressor protein. Of interest, in forming complexes, the 9 ORF 1 protein preferentially associated with the second PDZ domain of DLG, similar to adenomatous polyposis coli protein. Human T cell leukemia virus type 1 Tax and most oncogenic human papillomavirus E 6 oncoproteins also possessed PDZ domain-binding motifs at their C termini and, significantly, human T cell leukemia virus type 1 Tax and human papillomavirus 18 E 6 proteins bound DLG in vitro.

40|$|Cellular {{heterogeneity}} is {{an integral}} part of cancer development and progression. Progression can be associated with emergence of cells that exhibit high phenotypic plasticity (including "de-differentiation" to primitive developmental states), and aggressive behavioral properties (including high <b>tumorigenic</b> <b>potentials).</b> We observed that many biomarkers that are used to identify Cancer Stem Cells (CSC) can label cell subsets in an advanced clinical stage of lung cancer (malignant pleural effusions, or MPE). Thus, CSC-biomarkers may be useful for live sorting functionally distinct cell subsets from individual tumors, which may enable investigators to hone in on the molecular basis for functional heterogeneity. We demonstrate that the CD 44 (hi) (CD 44 -high) cancer cell subsets display higher clonal, colony forming potential than CD 44 (lo) cells (n= 3) and are also tumorigenic (n= 2 / 2) when transplanted in mouse xenograft model. The CD 44 (hi) subsets express different levels of embryonal (de-differentiation) markers or chromatin regulators. In archived lung cancer tissues, ALDH markers co-localize more with CD 44 in squamous cell carcinoma (n= 5 / 7) than Adeno Carcinoma (n= 1 / 12). MPE cancer cells and a lung cancer cell line (NCI-H- 2122) exhibit chromosomal abnormalities and 1 p 36 deletion (n= 3 / 3). Since miR- 34 a maps to the 1 p 36 deletion site, low miR- 34 a expression levels were detected in these cells. The colony forming efficiency of CD 44 (hi) cells, characteristic property of CSC, can be inhibited by mir- 34 a replacement in these samples.

However, the molecular basis of the cancer is poorly understood. Previous studies showed that chromosome 11 is important in esophageal carcinomas. The aims {{of the present study}} were to identify possible region(s) containing tumor suppressor gene(s) on chromosome 11 related to esophageal pathogenesis and to investigate its functional role in this cancer. The first aim was achieved by using seventeen polymorphic microsatellite markers spanning the whole chromosome 11 to screen for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in 38 primary esophageal squamous cell carcinomas. High rates of allelic loss were observed in two chromosomal regions, 11 p 15. 5 and 11 q 22. 3, which had also been reported in other cancers. This suggests the presence of tumor suppressor genes in these areas. The microcell-mediated chromosome transfer technique was used to determine the functional role of chromosome 11 in esophageal carcinogenesis. Chromosome 11 derived from a normal human fibroblast was introduced into the esophageal cancer cell line, T. Tn- 6 /TSI. <b>Tumorigenic</b> <b>potentials</b> of three chromosome 11 -containing microcell hybrids were studied. All the hybrids showed complete suppression of tumorigenicity, including the one that probably received only a 11 q fragment.

We found that polysialic acid-neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM) − cells among the early NPCs caused tumors, whereas PSA-NCAM+ cells were nontumorigenic. Molecular profiling, global gene analysis, and multilineage differentiation of PSA-NCAM− cells confirm that they are multipotent neural crest stem cells (NCSCs) that could differentiate into both ectodermal and mesodermal lineages. Transplantation of PSA-NCAM− cells in a gradient manner mixed with PSA-NCAM+ cells proportionally increased mesodermal tumor formation and unwanted grafts such as PERIPHERIN+ cells or pigmented cells in the rat brain.

Interestingly, this metabolic adaptation {{does not appear to be}} caused by damaged respiration, since the expression and activity of components of the respiratory chain complexes were unchanged in the cell lines. Moreover, the corresponding mitochondrial ATP synthetic abilities of the cell lines were found similar. The production of reactive oxygen species was also measured. A shift in ROS generation was found when compared nontumorigenic with tumorigenic cell lines, the latter exhibiting about threefold higher ROS levels than nontumorigenic cells.

The cell line UISO-MEL- 4 contains wild-type p 53 and is tumorigenic, whereas UISO-MEL- 6 lacks p 53 and produces lung and liver metastasis upon s. c. injection into athymic mice. Our study showed that UISO-MEL- 4 stably transfected with wild-type p 53 cDNA driven by cytomegalovirus promoter-enhancer sequences expressed high levels of p 53 and p 21 and formed s. c. tumours in vivo. Mutated p 53 (143 Val-Ala) expression, on the other hand, inhibited tumour growth in 50 % of cases and produced significantly slower growing non-metastatic tumours. Reduced tumour growth involved necrotic as well as apoptotic cell death. Inhibition of tumour growth was abrogated by the addition of Matrigel (15 mg ml(- 1)). With UISO-MEL- 6 cells, stably transfected with mutant p 53, tumour growth was delayed and metastasis was inhibited. In soft agar colony formation assay, both wild-type and mutant p 53 transfectants reduced anchorage-independent colony formation in vitro. These data suggest that mutated (143 Val-Ala) p 53, which retains DNA binding and some of the transactivation functions of the wild-type p 53 protein, suppresses <b>tumorigenic</b> and metastatic <b>potentials</b> of human melanoma cell lines in vivo...|$|R
40|$|Background: Tumor-induced lymphangiogenesis is {{a crucial}} step in {{malignant}} invasion and metastasis. Extracellular matrix protein 1 (ECM 1) was recently reported {{to play a role}} in lymphangiogenesis. In the present work, we aimed to evaluate the role of ECM 1 in gastric cancer and examined whether aberrant expression of ECM 1 increased the <b>tumorigenic</b> and metastatic <b>potential</b> of human gastric cancer. Methods: The mRNA and protein expression of ECM 1 in gastric cancer specimen and the noncancerous counterparts from 77 patients were detected by real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry staining. Lymphatic microvessel density (LMVD) in the corresponding serial sections was assessed by counting the lymphatic microvessels labelled by D 2 - 40. The correlations between ECM 1 expression, LMVD, and the clinicopathological parameters were examined. Results: ECM 1 protein expression was detected in 70. 1 % (54 / 77) of gastric cancer specimen, significantly higher than that in the corresponding counterparts (P < 0. 01). ECM 1 mRNA in tumor specimen was also dramatically amplified. Elevated LMVD and ECM 1 were positively correlated (P < 0. 01). In addition, ECM 1 protein expression was also closely associated with depth of tumor invasion and TNM stage (P < 0. 05, respectively). Conclusions: ECM 1 expression is aberrant elevated in tumor specimen and is closely related to the <b>tumorigenic</b> and metastatic <b>potential</b> of human gastric cancer. Thus, carrying out the protein examination may be beneficial to predict carcinogenesis and metastatic spread of human gastric cancer...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY-African {{green and}} rhe. us monkeys treated with antilympho-cyte {{globulin}} {{were used to}} test for the <b>tumorigenic</b> <b>potential</b> of human cell cultures derived from normal and malignant tissues. Newborn, infant, and juvenile monkeys served equally well as conditioned hosts to support the growth of human epidermoid carcinoma cells. Normal human cells tested {{in the same manner}} showed no gross or microscopic evidence of tumor formation. The results suggest that the subhuman primate treated with anti-lymphocyte globulin may be a sensitive test system for assessment of the tumorigenicity of cells. -J Nat Cancer Inst 48 : 705 - 713, 1972. THE MOST widely used test of the <b>tumorigenic</b> <b>potential</b> of cultured cells in vivo is the inoculation of such cells into the cheek pouch of the cortisonized adult hamster (1).

40|$|For anticancer drug therapy, it is {{critical}} to kill those cells with highest <b>tumorigenic</b> <b>potential,</b> even when they comprise a relatively small fraction of the overall tumor cell population. We have used the established NCI/DTP 60 cell line growth inhibition assay as a platform for exploring the relationship between chemical structure and growth inhibition in both tumorigenic and non-tumorigenic cancer cell lines. Using experimental measurements of "take rate" in ectopic implants as a proxy for <b>tumorigenic</b> <b>potential,</b> we identified eight chemical agents that appear to strongly and selectively inhibit the growth of the most tumorigenic cell lines. Biochemical assay data and structure-activity relationships indicate that these compounds act by inhibiting tubulin polymerization. Yet, their activity against tumorigenic cell lines is more selective than that of the other microtubule inhibitors in clinical use. Biochemical differences in the tubulin subunits that make up microtubules, or differences in the function of microtubules in mitotic spindle assembly or cell division may be associated with the selectivity of these compounds...|$|E
40|$|Stem {{cells and}} {{therapeutic}} genes are {{emerging as a}} new therapeutic approach to treat various neurodegenerative diseases with few effective treatment options. However, potential formation of tumors by stem cells has hampered their clinical application. Moreover, adequate preclinical platforms to precisely test <b>tumorigenic</b> <b>potential</b> of stem cells are controversial. In this study, we compared the sensitivity of various animal models for in vivo stem cell tumorigenicity testing to identify the most sensitive platform. Then, <b>tumorigenic</b> <b>potential</b> of adult human multipotent neural cells (ahMNCs) immortalized by the human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) gene was examined as a stem cell model with therapeutic genes. When human glioblastoma (GBM) cells were injected into adult (4 - 6 -week-old) Balb/c-nu, adult NOD/SCID, adult NOG, or neonate (1 - 2 -week-old) NOG mice, the neonate NOG mice showed significantly faster tumorigenesis {{than that of the}} other groups regardless of intracranial or subcutaneous injection route. Two kinds of ahMNCs (682 TL and 779 TL) were primary cultured from surgical samples of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. Although the ahMNCs were immortalized by lentiviral hTERT gene delivery (hTERT- 682 TL and hTERT- 779 TL), they did not form any detectable masses, even in the most sensitive neonate NOG mouse platform. Moreover, the hTERT-ahMNCs had no gross chromosomal abnormalities on a karyotype analysis. Taken together, our data suggest that neonate NOG mice could be a sensitive animal platform to test <b>tumorigenic</b> <b>potential</b> of stem cell therapeutics and that ahMNCs could be a genetically stable stem cell source with little tumorigenic activity to develop regenerative treatments for neurodegenerative diseases...|$|E
40|$|Follicular thyroid cancer (FTC) is {{the second}} most common type of thyroid cancers. In order to develop more {{effective}} personalized therapies, it is necessary to thoroughly evaluate patient-derived cell lines in in vivo preclinical models before using them to test new, targeted therapies. This study evaluates the <b>tumorigenic</b> and metastatic <b>potential</b> of a panel of three human FTC cell lines (WRO, FTC- 238, and TT 1609 -CO 2) with defined genetic mutations in two in vivo murine models: an orthotopic thyroid cancer model to study tumor progression and a tail vein injection model to study metastasis. All cell lines developed tumors in the orthotopic model, with take rates of 100 %. Notably, WRO-derived tumors grew two to four times faster than tumors arising from the FTC- 238 and TT 2609 -CO 2 cell lines. These results mirrored those of a tail vein injection model for lung metastasis: one hundred percent of mice injected with WRO cells in the tail vein exhibited aggressive growth of bilateral lung metastases within 35 days. In contrast, tail vein injection of FTC- 238 or TT 2609 -CO 2 cells did not result in lung metastasis. Together, our work demonstrates that these human FTC cell lines display highly varied <b>tumorigenic</b> and metastatic <b>potential</b> in vivo with WRO being the most aggressive cell line in both orthotopic and lung metastasis models. This information will be valuable when selecting cell lines for preclinical drug testing...|$|R

50|$|Some {{evidence}} suggests that cells that undergo EMT gain stem cell-like properties, thus giving rise to Cancer Stem Cells (CSCs). Upon transfection by activated Ras, a subpopulation of cells exhibiting the putative stem cell markers CD44high/CD24low increases with the concomitant induction of EMT. Also, ZEB1 is capable of conferring stem cell-like properties, thus strengthening the relationship between EMT and stemness. This property conferred by EMT is thus doubly dangerous duo for the patient, as it not only enables the carcinoma cells to enter the bloodstream, but also endows them with properties of stemness by virtue of which these cells have increased <b>tumorigenic</b> and proliferative <b>potential.</b>|$|R
