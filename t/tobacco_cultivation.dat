5|$|The tobacco {{industry}} in North Korea is substantial, with 53,000 hectares (2.3 {{percent of its}} arable land) dedicated to <b>tobacco</b> <b>cultivation.</b> This is the fourth-highest percentage of arable land dedicated to tobacco in the world, with the annual output exceeding 80,000 tonnes, making North Korea {{one of the top}} 25 tobacco worldwide producers. This is despite 31% of North Koreans being malnourished. The best, strongest and most expensive tobacco comes from the north of the country near the border with China.|$|E

25|$|Robert {{traveled}} to California during the Gold Rush {{to minister to}} those searching for gold; he died there when James was three years old. After Robert's death, his widow Zerelda remarried twice, first to Benjamin Simms in 1852 and then in 1855 to Dr. Reuben Samuel, who moved into the James family home. Jesse's mother and Samuel had four children together: Sarah Louisa, John Thomas, Fannie Quantrell, and Archie Peyton Samuel. Zerelda and Samuel acquired a total of seven slaves, who served mainly as farmhands in <b>tobacco</b> <b>cultivation.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The first {{collections}} of insects originated, partially, from the duplicates from La Specola. Expanded by gifts from Ferdinando Piccioli, and Marquis Pietro Bargagli. Some very large collections were then acquired: Macrolepidoptera from Fritz Rühl of Zurich, Microlepidoptera Piralidini from Otto Staudinger of Dresden,and collections from Professor Pietro Stefanelli. Many were then added by {{workers at the}} Institute and from the Forest Institute of Vallombrosa, from forest Inspectors, the [...] "agencies" [...] of the <b>tobacco</b> <b>cultivations</b> and from private individuals who had requested determinations. The collections are extant.|$|R

25|$|African Americans, {{who were}} mostly enslaved at the time, made up 25% of Kentucky's {{population}} before the Civil War; {{they were held}} and worked primarily in the central Bluegrass region, an area of hemp and <b>tobacco</b> <b>cultivation,</b> as well as raising blooded livestock. The number of African Americans living in Kentucky declined during the 20th century. Many migrated during {{the early part of}} the century to the industrial North and Midwest during the Great Migration for jobs and the chance to leave segregated, oppressive societies. Today, less than 9% of the state's total population is African-American.|$|E
25|$|Land {{speculation}} was {{an important}} source of income as the first settlers sold out their claims for cash to newcomers and moved further west. The great majority of Kentuckians were farmers. They grew most of their own food, using the corn crop to feed hogs and to distill into whiskey. They obtained their cash from sales of burley tobacco, hemp, horses and mules. The hemp was spun and woven for cotton bale bagging and ropes. Tobacco was labor-intensive to cultivate; planters were attracted to Kentucky from Maryland and Virginia, where their own lands were near exhaustion from <b>tobacco</b> <b>cultivation.</b> Tobacco was a labor-intensive crop, and plantations in the Bluegrass region used slave labor, but on a smaller scale than the cotton plantations of the Deep South.|$|E
25|$|Monticello was {{the primary}} {{plantation}} of Thomas Jefferson, the third President of the United States, who began designing and building Monticello at age 26 after inheriting land from his father. Located just outside Charlottesville, Virginia, in the Piedmont region, the plantation was originally , with Jefferson using slaves for extensive cultivation of tobacco and mixed crops, later shifting from <b>tobacco</b> <b>cultivation</b> to wheat in response to changing markets. Due to its architectural and historic significance, the property has been designated a National Historic Landmark. In 1987 Monticello and the nearby University of Virginia, also designed by Jefferson, were together designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The current nickel, a United States coin, features a depiction of Monticello on its reverse side.|$|E
5000|$|His {{research}} {{mainly focused}} on the soil conditioning and on fertilizers, but he also improved the agrotechnology of <b>tobacco</b> and rye <b>cultivation.</b> He thoroughly studied the physico-chemical properties of soil, relationship between the water content and circuit and the crop quality.|$|R
50|$|The {{agriculture}} {{has remained}} an important economic sector thanks to horticulture, cereal cultivation, olive <b>cultivation,</b> <b>cultivation</b> of <b>tobacco</b> and <b>cultivation</b> of grapes, from {{which are made}} well-known wines, such as Montepulciano d'Abruzzo and Trebbiano d'Abruzzo. Financial services, trade and industry are developed, especially {{in the production of}} food, chemicals, paper, building material, packaging, engineering industry and metallurgy. In addition, Chieti hosts the seat of the homonymous province, a television station (Rete 8), hospitals, sport venues and different hotels.|$|R
40|$|A {{one year}} {{investigation}} of the zooplankton community composition and dynamics in Lake Οzeros (western Greece) revealed 25 invertebrate species (16 rotifers, three copepods, five cladocerans and one mollusc larva). The mean zooplankton abundance fluctuated between 59. 4 to 818 ind l- 1, having maximum values in spring. The species composition and seasonal variation do not differentiate Lake Ozeros from the nearby lakes. The presence of the dominant calanoid copepod Eudiaptomus drieschi {{and some of the}} rotifer species recorded are characteristics of either oligo- or eutrophic lakes. According to the trophic state index (TSI) Lake Ozeros is a meso-eutrophic ecosystem, in which the eutrophic character was possibly the result of the high charge with phosphorus (being raised by 28. 9 % in comparison to previous decades), which came into the lake via the surrounding agricultural cultivations and mainly the pig-raising activities. In contrast, the concentrations of ΝΟ 3, ΝΟ 2 and NH 4 have considerably decreased possibly due to the termination of the <b>tobacco</b> <b>cultivations</b> around the lake during the last years. The novel information on the abiotic and especially the biotic elements of Lake Ozeros provided by the present study can contribute to the effective management of this aquatic ecosystem in the future...|$|R
25|$|In 1765 {{the crown}} created a {{monopoly}} on tobacco, which directly affected agriculture and manufacturing the Veracruz region. Tobacco was a valuable, high demand product. Men, women, and even children smoked, something commented on by foreign travelers and depicted in eighteenth-century casta paintings. The crown calculated that tobacco could produce {{a steady stream of}} tax revenues by supplying the huge Mexican demand, so the crown limited zones of <b>tobacco</b> <b>cultivation.</b> It also established a small number of manufactories of finished products, and licensed distribution outlets (estanquillos). The crown also set up warehouses to store up to a year's worth of supplies, including paper for cigarettes, for the manufactories. With the establishment of the monopoly, crown revenues increased and there is evidence that despite high prices and expanding rates of poverty, tobacco consumption rose {{while at the same time}} general consumption fell.|$|E
500|$|Following {{recovery}} from the Revolutionary War's burning, Norfolk and her citizens struggled to rebuild. In 1804, another serious fire along the city's waterfront destroyed some 300 buildings and the city suffered a serious economic setback. During the 1820s, agrarian communities across the American South suffered a prolonged recession, which caused many families to migrate to other areas. Many moved west into the Piedmont, or further into Kentucky and Tennessee. [...] Such migration also followed the exhaustion of soil due to <b>tobacco</b> <b>cultivation</b> in the Tidewater, {{where it had been}} the primary commodity crop for generations.|$|E
2500|$|William Randolph owned a {{considerable}} number of slaves. This reflected the rise of slavery during his business career. Around 1675 Governor Berkeley reported the population of the colony as 40,000, with 4,000 indentured servants and 2,000 slaves. [...] But as the supply of indentured servants declined late in the 17th century, the planters turned to slaves for work in the labor-intensive <b>tobacco</b> <b>cultivation.</b>|$|E
50|$|Formerly, {{the village}} was {{surrounded}} by vineyards, <b>tobacco</b> and mulberry <b>cultivation,</b> of which only the vineyards remain. In the last decades of the 20th Century Morbio Superiore developed into a residential community. Since 1960, Lattecaldo has been {{the headquarters of the}} Cantonal Forestry School. In 2000, four-fifths of the workforce worked outside the community.|$|R
50|$|The <b>cultivation</b> of <b>tobacco</b> {{usually takes}} place annually. The tobacco is germinated in cold frames or hotbeds and then transplanted {{to the field}} until it matures. It is grown in warm climates with rich, well-drained soil. About 4.2 million {{hectares}} of <b>tobacco</b> were under <b>cultivation</b> worldwide in 2000, yielding over seven million tonnes of tobacco.|$|R
25|$|Closely {{related to}} the people of the Huron Confederacy were the Tionontate, a group whom the French called the Petun (<b>Tobacco),</b> for their <b>cultivation</b> of that crop. They lived further south and were divided into two groups: the Deer and the Wolves. Considering that they formed the nucleus of the tribe later known as the Wyandot, they too may have called {{themselves}} Wendat.|$|R
2500|$|The {{economy of}} Paphos {{depends largely on}} tourism and there are four resorts in the district: Kato Paphos, Coral Bay, Latchi, and Aphrodite Hills. The largest by far is Kato Paphos which employs over half of Paphos' population. Farming, {{especially}} banana, grape and <b>tobacco</b> <b>cultivation,</b> also contributes significantly to the economy of Paphos. Paphos has a [...] water distribution network which irrigates 5,000 ha of land. Paphos has the island's second international airport. Paphos Harbour is not {{important in terms of}} international trade as most shipping uses the harbour at Limassol. Paphos Marina has cultural and historical importance and is also used for fishing.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the first}} half of the 19th century, tobacco prices {{declined}} and tobacco lands lost much of their fertility. Planters adopted mixed farming, with an emphasis on wheat and livestock, which required less labor. The Constitutions of 1830 and 1850 expanded suffrage but did not equalize white male apportionment statewide. The population grew slowly from 700,000 in 1790, to 1 million in 1830, to 1.2 million in 1860. Virginia was the largest state joining the Confederate States of America in 1861. It became the major theater of war in the American Civil War. Unionists in western Virginia created [...] the separate state of West Virginia. Virginia's economy was devastated in the war and disrupted in Reconstruction, when it was administered as Military District Number One. The first signs of recovery were seen in <b>tobacco</b> <b>cultivation</b> and the related cigarette industry, followed by coal mining and increasing industrialization. In 1883 conservative white Democrats regained power in the state government, ending Reconstruction and implementing Jim Crow laws. The 1902 Constitution limited the number of white voters below 19th-century levels and effectively disfranchised blacks until federal civil rights legislation of the mid-1960s.|$|E

Many top brand Chinese cigarettes contain Yongding leaf.|$|R
25|$|The first {{significant}} attempts at exploring the Trans-Allegheny region occurred under {{the administration of}} Governor William Berkeley. Efforts to explore farther into Virginia were hampered in 1644 when about 500 colonists were killed in another Indian massacre led, once again, by Opechancanough. Berkeley is credited with efforts to develop others sources of income for the colony besides <b>tobacco</b> such as <b>cultivation</b> of mulberry trees for silkworms and other crops at his large Green Spring Plantation.|$|R
5000|$|The Caddo peoples moved west {{along the}} Red River, which they called Bah'hatteno in Caddo. A Caddo woman, Zacado, {{instructed}} the tribe in hunting, fishing, home construction, and making clothing. Caddo religion focuses on Kadhi háyuh, translating to [...] "Lord Above" [...] or [...] "Lord of the Sky." [...] In early times, {{the people were}} led by priests, including a head priest, the xinesi, who could commune with spirits residing near Caddo temples. A cycle of ceremonies corresponded to corn <b>cultivation.</b> <b>Tobacco</b> was and is used ceremonially. Early priests drank a purifying sacrament made of wild olive leaves.|$|R

50|$|In 1674, due to oversupply, {{the price}} of tobacco was dragged down. This {{encouraged}} colonists {{to turn to the}} cultivation of sugar. Although the sale of sugar cane was a lot more profitable than the sale of <b>tobacco,</b> its <b>cultivation</b> was also a lot more difficult and intensive than that of tobacco. African slaves thus replaced “engagès” as their servile labor was necessary for the economic development of France. In 1673, the Senegal Company was founded. It was responsible for the provision of slaves to the island of Saint-Domingue. Up until then, commerce had simply been between the West Indies and France, but now France had entered in the Triangular Trade, which meant that commerce was now between France, Africa and the West Indies. Although France’s participation in the trade was delayed, it ended up playing {{an important role in the}} overall trade of African slaves. In total, 17 French ports participated in the slave trade with over 3300 slave expeditions. The port of Nantes was France’s principal slave port as it was responsible for about 42% of France’s slave trade. Other important ports were those of La Rochelle, Marseille, Honfleur, Lorient, Le Havre, Bordeaux and Saint-Malo.|$|R
