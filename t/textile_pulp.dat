Cellulase family contain three groups of enzymes, endo-(1, 4)-β-D-glucanase (EG), exo-(1, 4)-β-D-glucanase (CBH) and β-glucosidase (BGL). EG breaks o-glycosidic bonds which are present internally but randomly. CBH attacks cellulose chains at the ends, to release β-cellulobiose. BGL acts on β-cellulobiose and generates glucose (Kuhad et al. 2011). They act together to form glucose from cellulose (Sukumaran et al. 2005).

Pectin methyl esterases, feruloyl/cinnamoyl esterases and glucuronoyl esterases {{play a significant role in}} plant biomass conversion by de-esterifying pectin and lignin–carbohydrate complexes and provide an accessible substrate for the acting enzymes secreted by microorganisms. Industrially, these de-esterifying enzymes are highly significant as they are involved in the production of commercially valuable products ranging from food, beverage, <b>textile,</b> <b>pulp</b> and paper, biofuel and pharmaceutical industries.

40|$|Membranes are {{commonly}} used in industrial separation processes because of their absence of moving parts, simplicity of separation without phase change, potential of scaling and instantaneous response to system variations. In general, polymeric membranes are of low cost and could be easily prepared, yet they fail at processes that involved high temperatures, extreme pH, corrosive and organic chemicals. Ceramic membranes were therefore introduced to these harsh conditions because of their high thermal and chemical stability, while being insensitive to swelling and could be easily cleaned. Industries that make wide use of ceramic membranes include water treatment, chemical production, petrochemical, metal, automotive, <b>textile,</b> <b>pulp</b> and paper, tannery, biotechnology, cosmetic, pharmaceutical, food and beverage. Among all different membrane geometries, hollow fibre has the highest surface {{area to volume ratio}} and highest compactness. The major limitation of large scale production and application of ceramic hollow fibre membrane is the brittle nature of ceramic. Brittleness is a significant problem when the membrane is of a hollow fibre geometry which is small in size and has thin walls. Apart from cracking under pressure, brittle ceramic hollow fibre membranes are also difficult to be bundled up and to be sealed into equipment as orientated modules. This thesis presents the fabrication and characteristics of ceramic hollow fibre membranes with enhanced flexural strength, which involves nickel aluminate (NiAl 2 O 4) as a reinforcement medium and as a pure membrane material. NiAl 2 O 4 is a non-toxic ceramic material with high melting temperature and strong resistance to acids and bases. The ceramic nature and stability of the strengthened hollow fibre membrane was therefore maintained. NiAl 2 O 4 was formed by the solid-solid reaction between nickel (II) oxide (NiO) and alumina (Al 2 O 3) at high temperature of 1400 oC or above. All the ceramic hollow fibre membranes were prepared by the phase-inversion and sintering method. Apart from water the commonly used internal and external coagulant in a phase-inversion process, the use of ethanol-water mixture as internal coagulant was also attempted and its effect on the structure of membrane wall was investigated. Brittleness of the ceramic hollow fibre membranes, which was the main focus of this thesis, was indicated by flexural strength obtained by three-point bending test carried out on individual samples. On top of flexural strength, other characteristics of the ceramic hollow fibre membranes that determine their application, effectiveness and efficiency in separation processes were also studied. These include microstructure, porosity, active layer porosity and pore size, pure water flux and chemical stability. All the ceramic hollow fibre membranes prepared were porous, with their pore sizes in the microfiltration range, and are suitable for the separation of solid suspensions from liquid. The study of strength enhancement of porous ceramic hollow fibre membranes started with the reinforcement of porous ceramic materials by the inclusion of external element, which was discrete NiAl 2 O 4 in the porous alumina matrix formed by the addition of NiO. X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern proved the formation of NiAl 2 O 4 ¬ without NiO remaining after the sintering process at 1500 oC or above for 5 hours. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) showed the even distribution of NiAl 2 O 4 across the alumina matrix through ball-milling mixing of raw materials before sintering. Flexural strength of the porous NiAl 2 O 4 /Al 2 O 4 increased with NiAl 2 O 4 loading up to 146 MPa at 14. 7 wt% of NiAl 2 O 4, which was a result of closure force formed by thermal expansion mismatch between alumina and NiAl 2 O 4 that deflects crack growth. Flexural strength decreased with further increase in NiAl 2 O 4 content as densification and shrinkage were hindered by grain growth in random directions which formed agglomerates and loose particles. NiAl 2 O 4 /Al 2 O 3 hollow fibre membranes were then fabricated through phase-inversion and sintering method with the same raw materials. A maximum flexural strength of 156 MPa was achieved by the NiAl 2 O 4 /Al 2 O 3 hollow fibre membrane containing 16. 4 wt% of NiAl 2 O 4, which was 2. 3 times of that of the pure alumina sample prepared under the same conditions. The 16. 4 wt% NiAl 2 O 4 /Al 2 O 3 hollow fibre membrane had a porosity of 46. 8 % which could give sufficiently low fluid resistance. It showed a pure water flux of 597 L/m 2. h. bar under a feed pressure of 2 bar and a mean pore size of 330 nm on its active layer. In comparison with ceramic hollow fibre membranes reported in other literatures, NiAl 2 O 4 reinforced alumina hollow fibre membrane achieved a higher flexural strength than other ceramic reinforcement methods such as the addition of Ni and NiO and a comparable flexural strength as yttria-stablized zirconia (YSZ) a stronger and higher cost ceramic than alumina and as within the porosity range of 47 - 55 %. Followed by the reinforcement of alumina hollow fibre membrane by discrete NiAl 2 O 4, nickel nanowire (Ni NW) which has a continuous structure was used as a raw material in the preparation of ceramic hollow fibre membrane precursor. Ni NW was oxidized into NiO in the sintering process in air, resulting in continuous NiAl 2 O 4 chains in alumina hollow fibre membranes. On top of thermal expansion mismatch between NiAl 2 O 4 and alumina, crack bridging effect of the NiAl 2 O 4 chains also led to strengthening effect. Flexural strength was increased with NiAl 2 O 4 content up to a loading of 2. 00 wt% then decreased with further increase in NiAl 2 O 4 like the case of discrete NiAl 2 O 4. The maximum flexural strength achieved was 172 MPa and the corresponding porosity, pure water flux at a feed pressure of 2 bar and mean active layer pore size was 35 %, 35 L/m 2. h. bar and 220 nm respectively. Apart from acting as reinforcement medium in alumina hollow fibre membrane, pure NiAl 2 O 4 hollow fibre membranes were prepared by mixing alumina and NiO powder in 1 : 1 molar ratio homogeneously, followed by sintering. A sintering time of 10 hours at 1600 oC was found to be sufficient for the solid state reaction to complete and sintering of NiAl 2 O 4. Flexural strength of NiAl 2 O 4 increased with sintering temperature. The flexural strength achieved at 1630 oC the highest sintering temperature attempted was 101 MPa with a porosity of 55 % and pure water flux of 862 L/m 2. h. bar at a testing pressure of 2 bar. Its active layer pore size ranged from 50 – 140 nm. In comparison with ceramic hollow fibre membranes with similar porosities, NiAl 2 O 4 showed an appreciable flexural strength. This proved that NiAl 2 O 4 was a mechanically strong ceramic and can potentially be used as industrial scale membrane with further studies. The ceramic hollow fibre membranes presented in this thesis have enhanced flexural strength, which indicates a decrease in their brittleness. The ceramic nature and hence high thermal and chemical stability of the hollow fibre membranes were maintained. These membranes could potentially undergo large scale production for industrial scale microfiltration processes. The strengthening mechanisms presented could also be potentially used in other ceramic materials which brittleness is a hindrance for their wide application...|$|E

Pectinase enzymes are extensively used in an industrial sector especially in food industry i.e. fruit juice extraction, coffee and tea fermentation, oil extraction, improvement of chromaticity and stability of red wine (Jayani et al. 2005). Besides food industry; pectinases are widely used in <b>textile,</b> paper and <b>pulp</b> industries, waste-water treatment (Solbak et al. 2005; Ahlawat et al. 2014). More recently, the enzyme has been used with cellulose enzyme for the production bioethanol from lignocellulosic biomass (Li et al. 2014).|$|R
40|$|The Lambro-Seveso-Olona {{system is}} one of the most densely {{populated}} watershed in Europe The average population density in this area is higher than 1000 inhabitants/km 2. These population densities are among the highest in Italy and Europe. Industry is also highly developed in this basin, chemical, <b>textile,</b> paper, <b>pulp</b> and food industries being the most important ones. Although at present the Lambro-Seveso-Olona system does not receive any more the untreated wastewaters of the Milan urban area, treated wastewaters constitute about half of the streamflow. Biotic communities in this river have a long history of poor quality status, having suffered great damage due to domestic and industrial discharges. The Lambro-Seveso-Olona system constitutes also the most polluted tributary of the Po river, the largest Italian river. Aim of this study is to analyse through a modeling exercise the restoration possibilities of the Lambro-Seveso-Olona system, investigating both the source apportionment of the macropollutants and the discharge limits that should be set to achieve the good quality status. Following modeling response, the technical and economic feasibility of the requested discharge limits will be evaluated...|$|R
50|$|CRAiLAR Technologies (formerly Naturally Advanced Technologies) is a Vancouver, BC-based cleantech company {{focused on}} {{providing}} <b>textile,</b> composite and <b>pulping</b> solutions, through {{the processing of}} industrial hemp, and other bast fibers. The company states that it believes that using hemp {{as an alternative to}} other fibers results in end products which are environmentally friendlier than those currently produced using conventional feedstock. CRAiLAR Technologies is now developing and commercializing its proprietary CRAILAR fiber processing technology in partnership with the National Research Council of Canada and the Alberta Research Council. The CRAILAR process and resulting products and by-products are expected to have applications in apparel, performance textiles, energy, composite materials, and pulp and paper markets.|$|R
40|$|AbstractDyes {{have been}} used in dyeing paper and <b>pulp,</b> <b>textiles,</b> plastics, leather, {{cosmetics}} and food industries. Colour stuff discharged from these industries poses certain hazards and environmental problems. In this work we study the potential feasibility of treated and untreated cereal by product for removal of Rhodamine b from aqueous solution. The effect of various experimental parameters such as contact time and initial concentration were investigated. The suitability of the Freundlich, langmuir, BET and Hrkin Jura models to the equilibrium data was investigated for Rhodamina b-CCBP system. The results showed that the equilibrium data fitted the freundlich model best. Kinetic modeling of removal of Rhodamine B was done using the pseudo second-order rate expression...|$|R
