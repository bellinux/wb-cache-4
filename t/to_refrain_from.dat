40|$|A {{survey was}} {{conducted}} to collect information about the behaviors expected of nurses in their 4 th or 5 th year of hospital services. A total of 903 behaviors were recorded. Ail these behaviors were perceived as important by the nurses concerned. This paper will report our analysis of 260 items, excluding behaviors of nurses relative to their families, superiors or subordinates. We found {{that many of these}} behaviors pertained <b>to</b> <b>refraining</b> <b>from</b> taking leadership in a way which might have a negative effect. The respondents attached more importance to performing desired behaviors and less importance <b>to</b> <b>refraining</b> <b>from</b> performing undesired behaviors. The patterns of activity varied, depending on the situation in the given hospital or the particular nurse concerned. Even behaviors of less importance were given high priority, depending on conditions at the particular hospital or ward, or the particular nurse involved. We {{think it is important to}} summarize these behaviors, to create a list of the behaviors expected of nurses in their 4 th or 5 th year of hospital service...|$|R

Knox retorted that the Bible notes that Israel was punished when it followed an unfaithful king and that the Continental reformers were refuting arguments made by the Anabaptists who rejected all forms of government. The debate revealed his waning influence on political events as the nobility continued to support Mary.|$|E

5|$|Al-Azhar {{also served}} as a focal point for protests against the Ottoman {{occupation}} of Egypt, both from within the ulema and from among the general public. Student protests at al-Azhar were common, and shops {{in the vicinity of the}} mosque would often close out of solidarity with the students. The ulema was also on occasion able to defy the government. In one instance, in 1730–31, Ottoman aghas harassed the residents living near al-Azhar while pursuing three fugitives. The gates at al-Azhar were closed in protest and the Ottoman governor, fearing a larger uprising, ordered the aghas <b>to</b> <b>refrain</b> <b>from</b> going near al-Azhar. Another disturbance occurred in 1791 in which the wāli harassed the people near the al-Hussein Mosque, who then went to al-Azhar to demonstrate. The wāli was subsequently dismissed from his post.|$|E
5|$|Bradman {{arranged}} for Lindwall {{to see his}} Melbourne masseur Ern Saunders, who restored the paceman’s leg to prime condition in a fortnight.

Bradman advised Lindwall to ensure that his dragging rear right foot was further behind the line than usual to avoid being no-balled, and <b>to</b> <b>refrain</b> <b>from</b> bowling at full speed until the umpires were satisfied with his delivery stride. The Australian captain guaranteed Lindwall selection for the Tests and told him that his first priority in the lead-in tour matches was passing the umpires' scrutiny. Bradman recalled how paceman Ernie McCormick had been no-balled 35 times in the traditional tour opener against Worcester during the 1938 campaign, destroying his confidence {{for the rest of the}} season.|$|E

The Catholic Church teaches that all people are obliged by God to perform some penance for their sins, and that these acts of penance are both personal and corporeal. The purpose of fasting is spiritual focus, self-discipline, imitation of Christ, and performing penance.|$|R
