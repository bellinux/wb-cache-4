He had shot Nevill in the bedroom too, but Nevill was able to get downstairs where he and Bamber fought in the kitchen, before Bamber shot him four times, twice in his temple and twice into the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> He had shot Sheila in the main bedroom, next to her mother, and had shot the children in their beds as they slept.|$|E
5|$|On June 1, 1996, Helmsley {{appeared}} on {{an episode of}} Superstars in a match against Marty Garner. When he attempted to perform the Pedigree, Garner mistook the maneuver for a double underhook suplex and tried to jump up with the move, causing him to land squarely on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> and suffer neck damage. Garner sued the WWF, eventually settling out of court and later discussed the incident in an appearance on The Montel Williams Show.|$|E
5|$|It was {{reported}} following Hard Justice that Shane Douglas was originally supposed to handle interview duties for the show, but {{came down with}} the stomach flu {{and was replaced by}} Terry Taylor. Also, that Jeff Hardy missed multiple flights causing him to arrive after the conclusion of the show. Hardy was subsequently suspended for this and past instances of no-showing events. Abyss and Ron Killings were the only ones to receive injuries at Hard Justice. Abyss was given a fairly deep cut on the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> from being bashed with a steel chair by Killings that required stitches. Meanwhile, Killings cracked his front teeth after falling face-first onto a steel chair.|$|E

25|$|In {{the case}} of the boy who said he {{recalled}} the life of someone who had been shot, the sister of the deceased told Stevenson that her brother had shot himself in the throat.

60|$|This was {{unreasonable}}; but he {{had lived}} in <b>his</b> own world <b>of</b> unreasonable resentments for many years. At last, passing his moist palm over the rare lanky wisps of coarse hair on the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> yellow <b>head,</b> he began to talk slowly.|$|R
25|$|I {{remember}} {{just how}} those men looked as we rode up the little hill where their camp was. The red {{light of the}} morning sun was streaming upon them as they lay head towards us on the ground. And every man had a round red spot on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> about {{as big as a}} dollar where the redskins had taken his scalp. It was frightful, but it was grotesque, and the red sunlight seemed to paint everything all over. I remember one man had on buckskin breeches.|$|E
25|$|On Saturday morning, June 25, 1977, Sullivan {{was struck}} while fishing in a {{freshwater}} pool. The lightning hit the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> set his hair on fire, traveled down, and burnt {{his chest and}} stomach. Sullivan turned to his car when something unexpected occurred — a bear approached the pond and tried to steal trout from his fishing line.

25|$|A {{specially}} constructed pavilion is erected on {{a courtyard}} between the Phaisan Thaksin and Chakkraphat Phiman Halls.

The king will dip his hand into this water and rub the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> with it. A rope will then be pulled, which releases a shower of water from a canopy above. The king will be offered the water in small bowls by members of the Buddhist clergy, the royal family, government ministers, and other officials as an act of blessing.|$|E

25|$|Balarama is {{an ancient}} deity, a {{prominent}} one by the epics era of Indian history as evidenced by archeological and numismatic evidence. His iconography appears with Nāga (many-headed serpent), a plough and other farm artifacts such as watering pot, possibly indicating his origins in a bucolic, agricultural culture. Balarama's legend appears in many Parva (books) of the Mahabharata. The Book Three (Vana Parva) states Krishna and him to be brothers born to separate mothers, but one father. Book One (Adi Parva) states the circumstances that lead to light skinned Balarama, and dark skinned Krishna. Book Thirteen (Anushasana Parva) presents the mythology of Sesha's incarnation into Balarama, as Vishnu incarnated as Krishna, likely reflecting the basis why most of ancient and early medieval artworks of Balarama show a snake hood on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E
25|$|On {{at least}} one occasion, a sports-writing {{assignment}} actually took Masterson {{out of the country}} to Cuba. On April 5, 1915, the 61-year-old Bat Masterson was in Havana, Cuba, attending the heavyweight championship fight between Jack Johnson and Jess Willard. As he arrived, he posed for a newsreel cameraman. He was now quite portly. The mustache of his younger days was long gone along with most of the hair on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> In the brief film clip, he removes his hat, smiles for the camera, and replaces the hat on his head. Twenty-eight stills from this film can be viewed in a 1984 book on Masterson. Later that day, in the official film made of the fight, Bat can be seen as one of the seconds for Jess Willard, climbing through the ropes just {{prior to the start of}} the fight.|$|E
25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1943 Hughes spent nearly a month in Las Vegas, test flying his Sikorsky S-43 {{amphibian}} aircraft, practicing touch-and-go landings on Lake Mead in preparation for flying the H-4 Hercules. The weather conditions at the lake during the day were ideal and he enjoyed Las Vegas at night. On May 17, 1943, Hughes flew the Sikorsky from California carrying two CAA aviation inspectors, two of his employees, and actress Ava Gardner. Hughes dropped Gardner off in Las Vegas and proceeded to Lake Mead to conduct qualifying tests in the S-43. The test flight did not go well. The Sikorsky crashed into Lake Mead, killing CAA inspector Ceco Cline and Hughes employee Richard Felt. Hughes suffered a severe gash on the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> when he hit the upper control panel {{and had to be}} rescued by one of the others on board. Hughes paid divers $100,000 to raise the aircraft and later spent more than $500,000 restoring it.|$|E

25|$|On 7 May 1999, at UFC 20, Rutten faced Kevin Randleman for the UFC Heavyweight Championship. The {{first four}} minutes {{consisted}} of Rutten taking unanswered punishment from his guard, getting {{blood on his}} face, but after the fight was stood up to check Rutten's cut, Rutten landed a hard kick to Randleman's liver, slowing his pace {{for the rest of}} the fight. They then exchanged strikes in Bas's guard, with the Dutch fighter opening a cut in Randleman via elbow strikes on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> until the end of the overtime. The fight went to the judges, and they gave the split decision win to Rutten, crowning him as UFC Heavyweight Champion. This victory met a heated controversy from fans and professionals of the sport alike, among them Randleman's corner and Mark Coleman, who criticized the judges's decision. Fight's judging at that point was not based on the current 10-point must system, but who the judges felt won the fight overall.|$|E

[...] he'd learned all our songs, as only Jimmy can, off the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> and, within one practice, we were ready to play. It was amazing. We just knew right away.

500|$|When {{portrayed as}} a secret agent, Povenmire starts with a similar bread loaf square design, but draws it {{standing}} up vertically and places a fedora on the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> which is combined with the square torso. In contrast to his mindless and wild-eyed expression as a pet, the secret agent version of Perry is detailed with eyes [...] "full of steely blue resolve." [...] Povenmire proceeds by drawing his arms, with bare hands that are open and prepared for fighting or any danger. His legs are bent, as well prepared for an act of danger or action needed. Povenmire finishes the design by adding his beaver tail and color.|$|E
500|$|All {{characters}} in Phineas and Ferb were drawn in a design borrowed from Tex Avery's style, with geometric shapes being included in their structure; Phineas {{in particular is}} that of a triangle. The triangle face has been stated in the series as being just his nose that covers the entire head. The goal while drawing characters was to make them simple enough to be drawn by child viewers and be recognized by silhouette. Phineas's eyes lie on the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> and are of oval shape. For his hair, three [...] "tufts" [...] are put in the back and front, while three freckles lie underneath. For the ear, a small 3 is used to represent the ear lobe. Povenmire uses thin, spindly arms for every character as a simple reason to add fun.|$|E
