When {{there is a}} vacancy on the Court, a new justice is {{nominated}} using {{a variation of the}} Missouri Plan. First, the Judicial Nominating Commission submits a list of three qualified nominees to the governor. The governor then selects the new Justice from the list. If the governor fails to choose a replacement within sixty days, <b>the</b> <b>chief</b> <b>justice</b> or the acting chief justice must do so. The Judicial Nomination Commission Chief Justice selects <b>the</b> <b>chief</b> <b>justice</b> from the sitting associate justices for a five-year term. <b>The</b> <b>chief</b> <b>justice</b> presides over the Court. When the position of chief justice becomes vacant, the most senior member of the Court serves as the acting chief justice until a new one is chosen by the Judicial Nominating Commission. <b>The</b> <b>chief</b> <b>justice</b> also serves as chairman of the Judicial Nominating Commission.|$|E

5|$|Then in 1862 {{the court}} was {{expanded}} to five justices {{with the addition of}} a fifth judicial district. Also that year the Court hired its first clerk after the legislature authorized that position. In 1878, the legislature passed an act to separate the circuit and supreme courts after the population reached 100,000. With the creation of a separate Circuit Court and Supreme Court, riding circuit was abandoned and the Supreme Court was reduced to three members, with members of each court elected separately. Governor Thayer then appointed James K. Kelly, Reuben P. Boise, and Paine Page Prim to the court as temporary justices until elections could be held.
