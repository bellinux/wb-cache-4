The works {{were approved by}} the State Government in December 1912. It was envisaged that the first electric trains would be running by 1915, and the project would be completed by 1917. However, progress fell behind because World War I restrictions prevented electrical equipment being imported from the United Kingdom.|$|E

50|$|Purchasing and its allied {{activities}} became {{complex as}} the traffic and train services increased {{in number and}} size. Purchase activity, which was clerical in nature in earlier days, had {{to respond to the}} needs of time become professional. The 1980s and 1990s saw more types of rolling stocks and improved maintenance practices. The railway network as measured by <b>track</b> <b>km</b> remained more or less the same, the increase in traffic and customer expectation put severe constraints on all the resources like track, rolling stock sheds, and workshops. Less time became available for maintenance. From the mid 1990's, safe running of trains emerged as an important issue and compared to previous decades, and more items became essential for safe operation of trains. All these issues put severe strain on railways purchasing system.|$|E
40|$|High-Speed Rail (HSR) is of {{substantial}} and growing interest around the world. The European Union (EU) {{sees it as}} an integrating force; China is investing at an extraordinary level and even the U. S. is trying to move forward. Although HSR is expected to shrink the temporal distance between cities, reshape the travel patterns of people toward—we hope—environmentally-friendly ones, create an image effect for the country building it, promote regional economics, etc., HSR is an expensive alternative. It is more capital intensive than other transportation projects in both unit cost (the cost per lane or <b>track</b> <b>km)</b> and total cost. On the other hand, HSR can aid in the formations of megaregions {{with the potential for}} economic growth. This paper discusses the cost characteristics of HSR, analyzes HSR’s potential economic influence on megaregions, and identifies megaregion-related revenues that can make HSR more financially viable: specifically, we discuss the use of value capture mechanisms to capture the megaregion economic benefits of HSR in order to finance such systems...|$|E
