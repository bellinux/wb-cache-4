25|$|Artemisinins {{can be used}} alone, {{but this}} leads to a high rate of {{recrudescence}} (return of parasites) and other drugs are required to clear the body of all parasites and prevent recurrence.

25|$|After Cao Xiu died {{later in}} 228, Man Chong, as General of the Vanguard, {{was ordered to}} replace him as the {{supervisor}} of military operations in Yang Province.

However, Cao Rui did not approve and, as a compromise, he allowed Man Chong to bring only 1,000 people with him to Yang Province while the rest had to remain in Runan Commandery.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{a shared}} {{belief in the}} {{potential}} of IoT, industry leaders and consumers are facing barriers to adopt IoT technology more widely. Mike Farley argued in Forbes that many IoT solutions either lack interoperability or a clear use case for end-users. “Instead of convincing consumers that they need complex systems to serve needs they don’t have, we should fix real problems people struggle with every day.” Many gadgets in the consumer IoT space have appealed to early adopters, yet failed to demonstrate relevance to ordinary people’s lives. “In order to boost sales and drive demand beyond the early adopter set, we need <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>making</b> toys no one cares about and instead work on building simple solutions to real, everyday problems for real people.” A recent study by Ericsson regarding the adoption of IoT among Danish companies, has suggested that many are struggling “to pinpoint exactly where the value of IoT lies for them”. A company must identify where the value of IoT lies in order to capture it, otherwise non-action is the consequence. This indicates that a major roadblock to IoT adoption is not technical but analytical in nature.|$|E

500|$|The {{first film}} Breen censored in the {{production}} stage was the Joan Crawford film Forsaking All Others. Although Independent film producers vowed they would give [...] "no thought to Mr. Joe Breen or anything he represents", they caved on their stance within one month of making it. The major studios still owned most of the successful theaters in the country, and studio heads such as Harry Cohn of Columbia Pictures had already agreed <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>making</b> indecent films. In several large cities audiences booed when the Production seal appeared before films. But the Catholic Church was pleased, and in 1936 Pope Pius XI stated that the U.S. film industry [...] "has recognized and accepts its responsibility before society." [...] The Legion condemned zero films produced by the MPPDA between 1936 and 1943.|$|E
500|$|In 1990, Bart {{quickly became}} one of the most popular {{characters}} on television in what was termed [...] "Bartmania". He became the most prevalent Simpsons character on memorabilia, such as T-shirts. In the early 1990s, millions of T-shirts featuring Bart were sold; as many as one million were sold on some days. Believing Bart to be a bad role model, several American public schools banned T-shirts featuring Bart next to captions such as [...] "I'm Bart Simpson. Who the hell are you?" [...] and [...] "Underachiever ('And proud of it, man!')". The Simpsons merchandise sold well and generated $2 billion in revenue during the first 14 months of sales. The success of Bart Simpson merchandise inspired an entire line of black market counterfeit items, especially T-shirts. Some featured Bart announcing various slogans, others depicted redesigns of the character, including [...] "Teenage Mutant Ninja Bart, Air Simpson Bart, [...] RastaBart". Matt Groening generally did not object to bootleg merchandise, but took exception to a series of [...] "Nazi Bart" [...] shirts which depicted Bart in Nazi uniform or as a white power skinhead. 20th Century Fox sued the creator of the shirts, who eventually agreed <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>making</b> them.|$|E
500|$|In a May 2015 interview, Frusciante {{said that}} he was {{finished}} with making music for public consumption, that he currently has no audience and {{in the past few years}} recorded music with no intention of ever releasing it. Frusciante said [...] "For the last year and a half I made the decision <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>making</b> music for anybody and with no intention of releasing it, which is what I was doing between 2008 and 2012. I felt that if I took the public into consideration at all, I wasn’t going to grow and I wasn’t going to learn. Being an electronic musician meant I had to woodshed for a while, so I have a good few years worth of material from that period that’s never been released… At this point, I have no audience. I make tracks and I don’t finish them or send them to anybody, and consequently I get to live with the music. The music becomes the atmosphere that I’m living in. I either make really beautiful music that comes from classical, or I make music where the tempo is moving the whole time, and there’s no melodic or rhythmic center.” ...|$|E
