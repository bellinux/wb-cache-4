Every night at dinner, along with singing and praying, every student had to recite a verse, or part of a verse, of Scripture from the Bible.|$|E
25|$|A {{qualified}} sleep specialist {{should be}} consulted for {{the diagnosis of}} any sleep disorder so the appropriate measures can be taken. Past medical history and a physical examination {{need to be done}} to eliminate other conditions that could be the cause of insomnia. After all other conditions are ruled out a comprehensive sleep history should be taken. The sleep history should include sleep habits, medications (prescription and non-prescription), alcohol consumption, nicotine and caffeine intake, co-morbid illnesses, and sleep environment. A sleep diary can be used {{to keep track of the}} individual's sleep patterns. The diary should include time to bed, total sleep time, <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> onset, number of awakenings, use of medications, time of awakening and subjective feelings in the morning. The sleep diary can be replaced or validated by the use of out-patient actigraphy for a week or more, using a non-invasive device that measures movement.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to clarify the {{relationship}} between lifestyle and temperature rhythm in child. We conducted a cross-sectional study with 254 subjects. The study consisted of the day-by-day measurement of childrens temperature rhythms and lifestyle factors such as their sleep-wake rhythm, meals, etc., and a selfadministered questionnaire completed by the parents of the enrolled subjects. An analysis of the results of the survey found that the children went to bed at approximately 10 : 00 PM and woke up at approximately 7 : 20 AM. Approximately 50 % of children had entrained body temperature rhythms, and the proportion increased for children 4 years old and older. Body temperature rhythms were related <b>to</b> <b>time</b> of going <b>to</b> <b>sleep,</b> <b>time</b> of waking up, and their age in months, and the body temperature rhythms showed higher entrainment for earlier <b>time</b> of going <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> and <b>time</b> of waking up, as well as for higher age in months. The factor with the strongest relationship was <b>time</b> of going <b>to</b> <b>sleep.</b> The <b>time</b> of going <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> had the strongest relationship with the body temperature rhythm for both the younger children and the older children. In addition, a relationship was observed for the time of waking up among the younger children. 　生活要因と幼児の体温リズムの関連を明らかにするために、１～５歳の保育園児２５４名 を対象に調査を行った。 　調査の内容は、体温リズムの測定および保護者への自記式質問紙とday-by-day plot法に よる睡眠覚醒リズム、食事等の生活状況調査である。 　幼児の睡眠状況は、就寝時刻は２２時前後、起床時刻は７時２０分、体温リズムが同調して いた子どもは約５割で、４歳児以上になるとその割合が高くなっていた。 　体温リズムには就寝時刻、起床時刻、児の月齢が関連し、就寝時刻、起床時刻が早いほど、 月齢が高いほど体温リズムは同調しており、最も関連の強い要因は就寝時刻であった。 　年少児群と年長児群のいずれも最も体温リズムと関連があったのは就寝時刻であったが、 年少児群では起床時刻にも関連が認められた。[原著...|$|R

6000|$|Although Admiral Bluewater devoted {{the minimum}} of <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep,</b> {{he was not}} what the French term matinal.

[...] This occurs daily, about the rising of the sun; and no officer, whose rank raises him above mingling with the duty, ever thinks, except on extraordinary occasions that may require his presence for other purposes, of intruding on its sacred mysteries. It is a rabid hour in a ship, and the wisest course, for all idlers, and all watch-officers, who are not on duty, is to keep themselves under hatches, if their convenience will possibly allow it. He who wears a flag, however, is usually reposing in his cot, at this critical moment; or, if risen at all, he is going through similar daily ablutions of his own person.|$|E
60|$|One day Androcles was {{gathering}} truffles in a forest, {{when he found}} a lion's den; and, walking into it, he lay down and slept. It was a custom, in his <b>time,</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> in lions' dens when practicable. The lion was absent, inspecting a zoological garden, and did not return until late; but he did return. He {{was surprised to find}} a stranger in his menagerie without a ticket; but, supposing him to be some contributor to a comic paper, did not eat him: he was very well satisfied not to be eaten by him. Presently Androcles awoke, wishing he had some seltzer water, or something. (Seltzer water is good after a night's debauch, and something--it is difficult to say what--is good to begin the new debauch with). Seeing the lion eyeing him, he began hastily to pencil his last will and testament upon the rocky floor of the den. What was his surprise to see the lion advance amicably and extend his right forefoot! Androcles, however, was equal to the occasion: he met the friendly overture with a cordial grasp of the hand, whereat the lion howled--for he had a carpet-tack in his foot. Perceiving that he had made a little mistake, Androcles made such reparation as was in his power by pulling out the tack and putting it in his own foot.|$|E
6000|$|In Odyssey, XI. 373, Alcinous {{says it is}} not yet <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> ev megaro, [...] "in the hall." [...] Alcinous and Arete, his wife, sleep [...] "in {{the recess}} of the lofty domos," [...] that is, in the recess of the hall, not of [...] "the house" [...] (Odyssey, VII. 346). The same words are used of Helen and Menelaus (Odyssey, IV. 304). But when Menelaus goes forth next morning, he goes ek thalamoio, [...] "out of his chamber" [...] (Odyssey, IV. 310). But this, says Noack, is a mere {{borrowing}} of Odyssey, II 2- 5, where the same words are used of Telemachus, leaving his chamber, which undeniably was a separate chamber in the court: Eurycleia lighted him thither at night (Odyssey, I. 428). In Odyssey, IV. 121, Helen enters the hall [...] "from her fragrant, lofty chamber," [...] so she had a chamber, not in the hall. But, says Noack, this verse [...] "is not original." [...] The late poet of Odyssey, IV. has cribbed it from the early poet who composed Odyssey, XIX. 53. In that passage Penelope [...] "comes from her chamber, like Artemis or golden Aphrodite." [...] Penelope had a chamber--being [...] "a lone lorn woman," [...] who could not sleep in a hall where the Wooers sat up late drinking--and the latest poet transfers this chamber to Helen. But however late and larcenous he may have been, the poet of IV. 121 certainly did not crib the words of the poet of XIX. 53, for he says, [...] "Helen came out of her fragrant, high-roofed chamber." [...] The hall was not precisely [...] "fragrant"! However, Noack supposes that the late poet of Book IV. let Helen have a chamber apart, to lead up to the striking scene of her entry to the hall where her guests are sitting. May Helen not even have a boudoir? In Odyssey, IV. 263, Helen speaks remorsefully of having abandoned her [...] "chamber," [...] and husband, and child, with Paris; but the late poet says this, according to Noack, because he finds that he is in for a chamber, so to speak, at all events, {{as a result of his}} having previously cribbed the word [...] "chamber" [...] from Odyssey, XIX. 53. Otherwise, we presume Helen would have said that she regretted having left [...] "the recess of the lofty hall" [...] where she really did sleep. [Footnote: Noack, pp. 47-48] ...|$|E
