25|$|Witt's last {{appearance}} before Congress came in 1955. Harvey Matusow, former CPUSA member, had previously <b>testified</b> <b>before</b> <b>Congress</b> against his former comrades. However, in 1954, Matusow published a book, False Witness, {{in which he}} recanted his anti-communist testimony.

Witt was called before the Subcommittee on Internal Security on April 18 to testify about {{his involvement in the}} Matusow affair. Witt freely admitted his legal role in obtaining the publication fee.|$|E
25|$|After Helms {{left the}} {{leadership}} of the CIA, he began his service as U.S. ambassador to Iran as designated by President Nixon. This had caused the dismissal of the then current ambassador, Joseph Farland. After being confirmed by the Senate, in April 1973 Helms proceeded to his new residence in Tehran, where he served as the American representative until resigning effective January 1977. During these years, however, his presence was often required in Washington, where he <b>testified</b> <b>before</b> <b>Congress</b> in hearings about past CIA activities, including Watergate. His frequent flights to America lessened somewhat his capacity to attend to being ambassador.|$|E

25|$|Mitchell was not {{discouraged}} {{by the failure of}} his first proposal. He recognized the value of public opinion in the debate and changed tactics, embarking on a publicity campaign on behalf of military aviation. General Menoher, when he was unable to persuade Secretary of War John Wingate Weeks to silence Mitchell, resigned his position on October 4, 1921, and was replaced by Maj.Gen. Mason Patrick. Although an engineer and not an aviator, Patrick had been Pershing's Chief of Air Service in France, where his primary duty had been to coordinate the activities of Foulois and Mitchell, then rivals.

25|$|Under President Carter, the CIA was {{conducting}} covertly funded pro-American opposition against the Sandinista. In March 1981, Reagan told Congress that the CIA would protect El Salvador by preventing the shipment of Nicaraguan arms {{into the country}} to arm Communist rebels. This was a ruse. The CIA was actually arming and training Nicaraguans Contras in Honduras in hopes that they could depose the Sandinistas in Nicaragua. Through William J. Casey's tenure as DCI little {{of what he said}} in the National Security Planning Group, or to President Reagan was supported by the intelligence branch of the CIA, so Casey formed the Central American Task Force, staffed with yes men from Covert Action. On December 21, 1982, Congress passed a law restricting the CIA to its stated mission, restricting the flow of arms from Nicaragua to El Salvador, prohibiting the use of funds to oust the Sandinistas. Reagan <b>testified</b> <b>before</b> <b>Congress,</b> assuring them that the CIA was not trying to topple the Nicaraguan government.|$|E

500|$|Truman's predecessor, Franklin D. Roosevelt, had {{organized}} his own presidential library, but legislation to enable future presidents {{to do something}} similar had not been enacted.

500|$|Ford's {{decision}} to pardon Nixon was highly controversial. Critics derided the move {{and said a}} [...] "corrupt bargain" [...] had been struck between the men. They said that Ford's pardon was granted in exchange for Nixon's resignation, which had elevated Ford to the presidency. Ford's first press secretary and close friend Jerald terHorst resigned his post in protest after the pardon. According to Bob Woodward, Nixon Chief of Staff Alexander Haig proposed a pardon deal to Ford. He later decided to pardon Nixon for other reasons, primarily the friendship he and Nixon shared. Regardless, historians believe the controversy {{was one of the}} major reasons Ford lost the 1976 presidential election, an observation with which Ford agreed. In an editorial at the time, The New York Times stated that the Nixon pardon was a [...] "profoundly unwise, divisive and unjust act" [...] that in a stroke had destroyed the new president's [...] "credibility as a man of judgment, candor and competence". On October 17, 1974, Ford <b>testified</b> <b>before</b> <b>Congress</b> on the pardon. He was the first sitting President since Abraham Lincoln to testify before the House of Representatives.|$|E
