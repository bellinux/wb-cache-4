This term must be understood to include not-slanted as well as slanted; in other words the variable consists of opposite qualities having zero slant as a norm. There is evidence that optical slant, so-called, is determined by stimulation. When vision is monocular and the head is motionless, this quality seems {{to depend on the}} gradient of the density of the "texture " of the retinal image (1). The experiment which appeared to demonstrate this psychophysical correspondence, however, is defective in that the procedure failed to isolate the quality of optical slant from a congruent quality of geographical slant which accompanied it. This failure should be amended if possible. Moreover the two kinds of slant need to be denned and their relevance to spaceperception discussed. Consider first the impression of slant embodied {{in the face of an}} object—a bounded surface, or a segment of an array of surfaces. It can be studied in the following situation. The 0 sits in an ordinary room with his gaze horizontally straight ahead and fixates the center of a surface such as a sheet of <b>textured</b> <b>cardboard.</b> This surface is then rotated by E around a horizontal axis, either forward or back- 1 The experimental study here reported was carried out by Janet Crum Cornsweet under the general supervision of the senior author. The experiment was planned with the assistance o...|$|E
