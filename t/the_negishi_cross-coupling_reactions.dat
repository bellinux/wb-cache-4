In contrast, with the EWO phosphine, the β-H elimination from intermediate [PdArEt(P-EWO) ] is slow compared to the fast Ar–Et reductive elimination, and the undesired reduction product ArH observed proceeds in this case of hydrolysis of ZnArEt, formed in transmetalations where Ar is transferred from Pd to Zn. The rate of these transmetalations is comparable to the rate of reductive eliminations. Consequently, undesired transmetalations affording [PdEt 2 (P-EWO) ] and ZnArEt are more effective at early stages of the reactions and less effective when the ethylating agent becomes poorer in ZnEt 2 and richer in ZnEtX (X = I), as the reaction proceeds.

X-ray structure analyses of the complexes 4 and 6 confirm the trigonal-pyramidal architecture composed of four sandwich units. Cyclic voltammetric studies of the ferrocenyl-containing complexes 4 and 5 reveal only one reversible redox couple with a peak separation of Delta E-p < 80 mV, demonstrating a negligible mutual electronic influence of the ferrocenes in all meta positions.

Thus, the reaction of equimolar amounts of ZnCl 2 and tBuMgCl reveals {{the formation of the}} unprecedented mixed Mg-Zn complex [(THF) (4) Mg(mu-Cl) (2) Zn(Bu-t) (Cl) ] (1), {{as a result of the}} co-complexation of the two anticipated exchange products of the metathesis. This magnesium zincate adopts a contacted ion-pair structure, closely related to Knochel's pioneering "Turbo" Grignard reagents. Furthermore, a second coproduct identified in this reaction is the solvent-separated mixed magnesium-zinc chloride complex [{Mg(THF) (6) }(2 +) {Zn 2 Cl 6 }(2 -) ] (3) that critically diminishes the amount of ZnCl 2 available for the intended metathesis reaction to take place. In another surprising result, when the reaction is carried out by using an excess of 3 M equivalents of the Grignard reagent (closer to the catalytic conditions employed by synthetic chemists), solvent-separated magnesium trialkyl zincate [{Mg 2 Cl 3 (THF) (6) }(+) {Zn(Bu-t) (3) }(-) ] (4) is obtained that can be viewed as a model for the active species involved in the increasingly important organic transformations of Grignard reagents catalysed by ZnCl 2. Furthermore, preliminary reactivity studies reveal that complex 4 can be used as an effective new reagent for direct Zn-I exchange reactions that allow the preparation and structural identification of the magnesium tris(aryl) zincate [{Mg 2 Cl 3 (THF) (6) }(+) {Zn(p-Tol) (3) }(-) ] (5) that represents the first example of complete 3 -fold activation of a zincate in a Zn-I exchange reaction which, in turn, can efficiently be used as a precursor for <b>Negishi</b> <b>cross-coupling</b> <b>reactions...</b>|$|R

40|$|Methodology for the {{synthesis}} of enantioenriched compounds {{is critical to the}} discovery of new pharmaceuticals. To access single enantiomers of biologically relevant molecules for evaluation, the Jarvo laboratory has developed both enantiospecific and enantioselective reactions. Herein, we report the development of transition metal-catalyzed methodology to generate diarylalkanes and homopropargylic sultams in high enantiomeric excess. Diaryl sulfides and 1, 1 -diarylalkanes are known to exhibit a wide variety of therapeutic applications, including treatment of breast cancer. These compound classes were synthesized for biological evaluation against a range of cancer cell lines. Heteroaromatic diaryl thioethers were prepared by the reaction of sulfenyl chlorides with arylzinc bromides, while enantioenriched 1, 1 -diarylalkanes were synthesized through the nickel-catalyzed <b>cross-coupling</b> <b>reactions</b> of alkyl Grignard reagents. Several lead compounds were identified that selectively inhibited breast cancer cell proliferation in the low micromolar range. In particular, a diarylalkane containing a thiophene moiety exhibited selective activity against a triple-negative breast cancer line. Stereospecific nickel-catalyzed cross-coupling methodology has also been applied to {{the synthesis}} of tubulin-binding diarylethane derivatives. Upon evaluation for inhibition of tubulin polymerization, the (S) -enantiomer of a trimethoxyphenyl-containing diarylethane exhibited higher levels of tubulin disruption than the (R) -enantiomer. These results show proof of concept that enantioenriched diarylethanes exhibit marked differences in tubulin-binding activity. We developed a different type of nickel-catalyzed reaction for the stereospecific ring-opening of O-heterocycles in order to provide acyclic alcohols with controlled formation of a new C–C bond. Aryl-substituted tetrahydropyrans underwent nickel-catalyzed Kumada coupling reactions with a range of Grignard reagents to furnish acyclic alcohols with high diastereoselectivity. A furan-substituted lactone underwent a <b>Negishi</b> <b>cross-coupling</b> <b>reaction</b> to provide <b>the</b> corresponding carboxylic acid in high enantiospecificity. Biological evaluation of the products identified several lead compounds with selective activity against a triple-negative breast cancer line. In the final Chapter of this dissertation, we describe {{the synthesis of}} enantioenriched homopropargylic α-chiral sulfonamides via the enantioselective silver-catalyzed propargylation of N-sulfonyl ketimines. This reaction proceeded in high yield and excellent enantiomeric excess, and was compatible {{with a wide variety of}} diaryl and alkyl ketimines. Synthetic transformations of homopropargylic products via enyne ring-closing metathesis and reduction reactions proceeded with high stereochemical fidelity. Both allenyl and propargyl borolane reagents could be used to obtain propargylic products, most consistent with a mechanism involving transmetallation of the silver catalyst with the borolane reagent...|$|R

40|$|Nos últimos anos, houve um aumento considerável dos estudos envolvendo o núcleo indolizínico, um entre os milhares de heterociclos existentes, sendo 2012 o ano de maior destaque, com 102 publicações. Esse crescente interesse é atribuído principalmente à busca por novos substratos funcionalizados que apresentem características medicinais e biológicas. Todavia, as indolizinas ainda são pouco exploradas se comparadas a outros núcleos heterocíclicos, principalmente no que diz respeito a sua funcionalização por emprego de reagentes organometálicos. Desta forma, o objeto deste trabalho foi o estudo da reatividade de diversas indolizinas perante diferentes organometálicos, por meio de reações de metalação dirigida, troca iodo-magnésio e acoplamento cruzado de Negishi com o intuito de construir indolizinas polifuncionalizadas. Assim sendo, inicialmente foi estudada a reatividade de bases organometálicas diante de algumas indolizinas e as reações de seus intermediários organometálicos com uma variedade de eletrófilos. Para tanto, as indolizinas foram divididas por posicionamento das funcionalizações, ou seja, indolizinas funcionalizadas na posição 1 do anel (-CO 2 Et, -CO 2 tBu e CN), indolizinas funcionalizadas na posição 2 do anel (-CO 2 Et, CN) e indolizinas funcionalizadas nas posições 1 e 3 do anel. Na sequência, foram estudadas as reações de troca iodo-magnésio diante das indolizinas funcionalizadas nas posições 1 e 3 e, por último, as reações de metalação dirigida com os substratos 2 -arilindolizínicos seguidas por reações de acoplamento cruzado de Negishi. As moléculas sintetizadas nesta última etapa, por terem apresentado fortes propriedades fluorescentes, foram submetidas a um estudo minucioso sobre essas características. Essas estratégias sintéticas desenvolvidas no presente trabalho foram altamente eficientes, permitindo o preparo de uma série de compostos com grande diversidade estrutural, sendo sintetizadas 64 indolizinas polifuncionalizadas inéditas e 11 indolizinas polifuncionalizadas já descritas na {{literatura}} por meio de outras metodologias, com rendimentos variando de 15 % a 87 %. In recent years, {{there has}} been a considerable increase in studies involving the indolizinic core, one of thousands of existing heterocycles, with 2012 being the most outstanding year, with 102 publications. This growing interest is mainly attributed to the search for new functionalized substrates that have medicinal and biological characteristics. However, indolizines are unexplored when compared to other heterocycles, particularly regarding their functionalization with the use of organometallic reagents. Thus, the object of this work was the reactivity study of several indolizines with different organometallics by means of directed metalation reactions, iodine-magnesium exchange and <b>Negishi</b> <b>cross-coupling,</b> in order to build functionalized poly-indolizines. Therefore, initially, it was investigated the reactivity of organometallic bases upon some indolizines and the reactions of their organometallic intermediates with a variety of electrophiles. To achieve this, indolizines were divided according to their function position, i. e. indolizines functionalized at position 1 of the ring (-CO 2 Et, CN and -CO 2 tBu), indolizines functionalized at position 2 of the ring (-CO 2 Et, CN) and functionalized at positions 1 and 3 of the ring. Furthermore, the iodine-magnesium exchange reactions of indolizines functionalized at positions 1 and 3 were studied and, finally, directed metalation reactions with 2 -aryl indolizinic substrates followed by <b>Negishi</b> <b>cross-coupling</b> <b>reactions</b> were performed. <b>The</b> ultimate products of such reactions showed strong fluorescent properties and, for this reason, were subject of detailed studies on these characteristics.
