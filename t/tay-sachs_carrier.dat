Rakow was a signatory to a subsequent letter stating that [...] "Every individual has the privilege to perform the test {{in a manner consistent}} with his desires.” Additionally, the Jewish Chronicle published a letter by a Tay Sachs carrier, who was hurt by a Dor Yeshorim organiser's insinuation, that there was stigma attached to being a <b>Tay-Sachs</b> <b>carrier.</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{modified}} {{program designed}} to screen for the <b>Tay-Sachs</b> <b>carrier</b> is presented in which testing is limited to one or both partners, as needed, in an Ashkenazi Jewish (Jews {{of central and eastern}} Europeancestry) mating when there is a definite commitment toward having a child, or {{in the early stages of}} the pregnancy. Testing of unmarried indi-viduals is discouraged. The approach maximizes individ-ualization of both the medical and laboratory aspects of the program and promotes a positive and beneficial rela-tionship between physician and clinical chemist. There is little involvement of the lay population or clergy, and no special sources of funding are required. Whereas most mass screening programs for the <b>Tay-Sachs</b> <b>carrier</b> have attempted to educate large numbers of the lay public to bring pressure upon the medical community, we hav...|$|E
40|$|Chi-square {{analyses}} of new data {{as well as}} data previously reported by Myrianthopoulos have shown that grandparents of Tay-Sachs carriers die from proportionally the same causes as grandparents of noncarriers. It is unlikely {{that there is any}} advantage to being a <b>Tay-Sachs</b> <b>carrier</b> insofar as resistance to tuberculosis is concerned. Our results are further evidence to support Fraikor's claim that the high carrier frequency of the allele in Ashkenazi Jews is probably caused by a combination of founder effect, genetic drift, and differential immigration patterns...|$|E
40|$|Members of the New York Board of Rabbis were {{surveyed}} {{in the summer}} of 1991 to assess their activity in counseling congregants on issues related to genetics. Of a sample of 257 members, 181 (70. 4 %) responded to the questionnaire, and 175 of the responses were analyzed. More than half (56. 0 %) of the rabbis discussed health issues as a routine part of premarital counseling, and 22. 3 % had counseled a couple after prenatal diagnosis of an abnormal fetus. Orthodox rabbis were more likely than rabbis from other branches of Judaism to have contacted medical personnel in these cases, and they reported more involvement in helping families after {{the birth of a child}} with a hereditary condition or birth defect. However, a majority (90. 9 %) of rabbis from all branches would refer such a family for genetic counseling. Ninety-four rabbis (53. 7 %) discussed <b>Tay-Sachs</b> <b>carrier</b> testing with congregants. These rabbis tended to be Reform, to be younger, and to have fewer years in the rabbinate. Reform rabbis also scored significantly higher than did Orthodox or Conservative rabbis on knowledge questions about Jewish genetic diseases and were more active in distributing pertinent literature to congregants. Even though nearly 90 % of the sample viewed counseling on genetic issues as part of their rabbinical role, most rabbis, even those who actually counseled on these issues, felt poorly prepared to do so. Recommendations are made for increased programming in rabbinical schools and for outreach from the genetics community...|$|E
40|$|We have {{evaluated}} {{the feasibility of}} using PCR-based mutation screening for non-Jewish enzyme-defined carriers identified through Tay-Sachs disease-prevention programs. Although Tay-Sachs mutations are rare in the general population, non-Jewish individuals may be screened as spouses of Jewish carriers or as relatives of probands. In order to define a panel of alleles that might account {{for the majority of}} mutations in non-Jewish carriers, we investigated 26 independent alleles from 20 obligate carriers and 3 affected individuals. Eighteen alleles were represented by 12 previously identified mutations, 7 that were newly identified, and 1 that remains unidentified. We then investigated 46 enzyme-defined carrier alleles: 19 were pseudodeficiency alleles, and five mutations accounted for 15 other alleles. An eighth new mutation was detected among enzyme-defined carriers. Eleven alleles remain unidentified, despite the testing for 23 alleles. Some may represent false positives for the enzyme test. Our results indicate that predominant mutations, other than the two pseudodeficiency alleles (739 C [...] >T and 745 C [...] >T) and one disease allele (IVS 9 + 1 G [...] >A), do not occur in the general population. This suggests that {{it is not possible to}} define a collection of mutations that could identify an overwhelming majority of the alleles in non-Jews who may require <b>Tay-Sachs</b> <b>carrier</b> screening. We conclude that determination of carrier status by DNA analysis alone is inefficient because of the large proportion of rare alleles. Notwithstanding the possibility of false positives inherent to enzyme screening, this method remains an essential component of carrier screening in non-Jews. DNA screening can be best used as an adjunct to enzyme testing to exclude known HEXA pseudodeficiency alleles, the IVS 9 + 1 G [...] >A disease allele, and other mutations relevant to the subject's genetic heritage...|$|E
