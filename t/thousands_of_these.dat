5|$|Chrysiridia rhipheus is {{the sole}} {{specialist}} herbivore of the four species of Omphalea in Madagascar. Omphalea is toxic: the toxins are sequestered by the feeding caterpillar and retained in the pupal and adult stages. <b>Thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> moths migrate between the eastern and western ranges of their host plants.|$|E
5|$|White {{settlers}} who {{had traveled}} to Oregon along the Oregon Trail began {{to live in the}} high desert region in the 1850s and the 1860s, after they had begun farming and logging in the Willamette Valley and other lands in western Oregon. <b>Thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> emigrants reached the area from the west, crossing the Cascade Range to make land claims in eastern Oregon. The high desert area was settled by whites later than western Oregon in part because of Elijah White's failure to find a pass east through the Cascades. Once they had claimed more land, pioneers and members of the American government negotiated treaties with natives in the high desert and elsewhere in Oregon, often forcing them off their native lands and on to reservations.|$|E

25|$|But {{advocates of}} the guild model argue that the union is {{laying the groundwork for}} {{long-term}} growth. The union is not only gaining members which enable it to advocate for changes in federal labor law to permit the unionization of independent contractors. The union is also setting the stage for the affiliation of potentially hundreds of <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> workers. In the meantime, supporters say, OPEIU gains some additional dues income and is able to enhance its bargaining status with insurers and other vendors by pointing to a larger membership base.|$|E
25|$|Casu marzu {{is created}} by leaving whole {{pecorino}} cheeses outside with part of the rind removed to allow the eggs of the cheese fly Piophila casei to be laid in the cheese. A female P. casei can lay more than 500 eggs at one time. The eggs hatch and the larvae begin to eat through the cheese. The acid from the maggots' digestive system breaks down the cheese's fats, making {{the texture of the}} cheese very soft; by the time it is ready for consumption, a typical casu marzu will contain <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> maggots.|$|E

Oracle offered an XCMD that allowed HyperCard to directly query Oracle databases on any platform. This was later superseded by Oracle's Oracle Card product. BeeHive Technologies offered a hardware interface that allowed the computer to control external devices. Connected via the Apple Desktop Bus (ADB), this instrument could read the state of connected external switches or write digital outputs to a multitude of devices.|$|E

The cumulative influence of the city on the west, over the many centuries of its existence, is incalculable.

25|$|A {{simpler and}} less {{expensive}} form of arsenic removal {{is known as the}} Sono arsenic filter, using three pitchers containing cast iron turnings and sand in the first pitcher and wood activated carbon and sand in the second. Plastic buckets can also be used as filter containers. It is claimed that <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> systems are in use and can last for years while avoiding the toxic waste disposal problem inherent to conventional arsenic removal plants. Although novel, this filter has not been certified by any sanitary standards such as NSF, ANSI, WQA and does not avoid toxic waste disposal similar to any other iron removal process.|$|E

25|$|Different {{nations have}} {{different}} methods of handling internal and international trade. Australia has banned {{the export of}} its native birds since 1960. Following years of campaigning by hundreds of NGOs and outbreaks of avian flu, in July 2007, the European Union halted the importation of all wild birds with a permanent ban on their import. Prior to an earlier temporary ban started in late October 2005, the European Union (EU) was importing about two million live birds a year, about 90% of the international market: hundreds of <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> were parrots. No national laws protect feral parrot populations in the U.S. Mexico has a licensing system for capturing and selling native birds.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s and 1990s, robotic milking {{systems were}} {{developed}} and introduced (principally in the EU). <b>Thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> systems {{are now in}} routine operation. In these systems the cow has {{a high degree of}} autonomy to choose her time of milking freely during the day (some alternatives may apply, depending on cow-traffic solution used at a farm level). These systems are generally limited to intensively managed systems although research continues to match them to the requirements of grazing cattle and to develop sensors to detect animal health and fertility automatically. Every time the cow enters the milking unit she is fed concentrates and her collar is scanned to record production data.|$|E
500|$|Hammocks {{are often}} the only dry land within the park. They rise several inches above the grass-covered river, and are {{dominated}} by diverse plant life consisting of subtropical and tropical trees, such as large southern live oaks (Quercus virginiana). Trees often form canopies under which animals thrive amongst scrub bushes of wild coffee (Psychotria), white indigoberry (Randia aculeata), poisonwood (Metopium toxiferum) and saw palmetto (Serenoa repens). The park features <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> tree islands amid sloughs—which often form {{the shape of a}} teardrop when seen from above (see park map) because of the slowly moving water around them—but they can also be found in pineland and mangroves. Trees in the Everglades, including wild tamarind (Lysiloma latisiliquum) and gumbo-limbo (Bursera simaruba), rarely grow higher than [...] due to wind, cold weather, and lightning strikes.|$|E

500|$|Murals {{painted on}} the walls of the Goguryeo Tombs are {{examples}} of Korean painting from its Three Kingdoms era. Although <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> tombs have been found, only about 100 have murals. These tombs are often named for the dominating theme of the murals – these include the Tomb of the Dancers, the Tomb of the Hunters, the Tomb of the Four Spirits, and the Tomb of the Wrestlers. Heavenly bodies are a common motif, as are depictions of events from the lives of the royalty and nobles whose bodies had been entombed. The former include the sun, represented as a three-legged bird inside a wheel, and the various constellations, including especially the Four directional constellations: the Azure Dragon of the East, the Vermilion Bird of the South, the White Tiger [...] of the West, and the Black Tortoise of the North.|$|E
500|$|With {{the demise}} of the [...] AMX 50 program in 1951, France {{temporarily}} officially abandoned the thought of producing a medium tank. It was expected that West Germany would soon be allowed to rearm, and the Germans had appeared to entertain the concept of equipping their forces with a host of low-cost light, but relatively powerfully armed tanks, their quantity compensating for a lack of full armament parity with the latest medium tanks. The prospect of delivering many <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> to the Germans induced the French to adopt the idea and plan to create light tank [...] "Type 67" [...] armoured divisions, for which the AMX-13/105 was specially designed. A private enterprise design aimed at fulfilling the same requirement was the somewhat larger Char Batignolles-Châtillon. A derived medium tank prototype of the latter, made in 1955, proved {{that it was possible to}} produce a tank with a first-rate gun and frontally protected with [...] steel equivalence within a weight constraint of [...] This revived interest in the medium tank concept.|$|E

Andy Cohen and the stars of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills make cameos in the video. A scene featuring Gaga rolling around on a seashell bed in a red outfit, dancing in a gold leotard with arrows, and floating on a bed in a pool are shown throughout the song. With the help of YouTuber SkyDoesMinecraft (also making his cameo appearance), Michael Jackson, Mahatma Gandhi, John Lennon, and Jesus are resurrected using the game Minecraft and their blood is used to create clones known as [...] "G.U.Y." [...] Gaga, Vanderpump, and Richards are seen {{coming out of a}} car in black outfits, shooting money cannons, and walking down the hallway to kill corporate executives to replace with G.U.Y. clones.
