5|$|Due to the {{original}} formulation of the rules in England, the standard dimensions of a hockey pitch were originally expressed in imperial units. <b>The</b> <b>rules</b> <b>are</b> now expressed explicitly in metric dimensions (since 1998), although {{the use of the}} imperial terms remains common in some countries.|$|E
5|$|Often, {{teams will}} finish a season with {{identical}} records. It becomes necessary, therefore, to devise means to break these ties, either {{to determine which}} teams will qualify for the playoffs, or to determine seeding in the playoff tournament. The rules below are applied in order until the tie is broken. If three teams are tied for one playoff spot and the third team is eliminated at any step, the tie breaker reverts to step one for the remaining two teams. If multiple playoff spots are at stake, <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> <b>are</b> applied in order until the first team qualifies, then the process is started again for the remaining teams.|$|E
5|$|The rules {{had a major}} {{influence}} on how the modern game of football developed. Among other things they introduced into the laws of the game the concepts of corners, throw-ins, and free kicks for fouls. The abolition of the fair catch also led to their teams {{to be the first to}} head the ball. Games played under <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> <b>are</b> also credited with the development of heading and the origins of the goalkeeper and forward positions. The first inter-club football match and competitive tournament were both played using Sheffield Rules.|$|E

50|$|In the U.S., {{interested}} parties can sue {{to have a}} judge review the rulemaking process once <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>is</b> finalized. Interested parties frequently sue the rulemaking agency, asking the court to order the agency to reconsider. For example, environmental groups may sue, claiming that <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>is</b> too lax on industry; or industry groups may sue, claiming that <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>is</b> too onerous.|$|R
50|$|The {{respondents}} defended {{their actions}} {{by arguing that}} <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>was</b> a bona fide occupational requirement (BFOR). Namely, that <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>was</b> required to maintain an acceptable standard for firefighting.|$|R
5|$|A typical {{session of}} the Senate begins with a call to order by the President of the Senate. After the call to order, the {{previous}} day's journal is approved, petitions are heard, and orders involving committee and leadership appointments or changes to <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> <b>are</b> presented. First, readings of legislation take place. Senators are then given leeway to introduce any visitors, often people observing its deliberations from the gallery above the Senate chamber. Then the Senators consider legislation. They begin with unfinished business from the previous session, then consider legislation and special orders with accompanying reports from committees. At {{the discretion of the}} presiding officer, the Senate may adjourn at any time, unless a majority of members present object to adjournment.|$|E

30|$|Once <b>the</b> first <b>rule</b> <b>is</b> {{sent over}} <b>the</b> UART, <b>the</b> second <b>rule</b> <b>was</b> sent {{followed}} by <b>the</b> third <b>rule.</b> This sequence <b>was</b> followed till <b>the</b> final <b>rule</b> <b>was</b> sent.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a rule for allocating joint vehicle costs between fronthaul and backhaul truck trips {{on a given}} route. <b>The</b> <b>rule</b> <b>is</b> derived by extending the De Vany and Saving model of a competitive trucking industry operating in uncertain markets. <b>The</b> <b>rule</b> <b>is</b> based upon <b>the</b> existence of inventory costs related to truck trips and demand interdependency between fronthaul and backhaul truck trips. <b>The</b> <b>rule</b> <b>is</b> compared to an earlier joint cost allocation rule developed by Walters. ...|$|R

25|$|The craft unionist advocates sorting {{workers into}} {{exclusive}} groups of skilled workers, or workers sharing a particular trade. The organization operates, and <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> <b>are</b> formulated primarily to benefit {{members of that}} particular group.|$|E
25|$|Other {{borderline}} cases occur (much) later, and if <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> <b>are</b> followed strictly and {{these cases are}} not specially treated, they generate successive new moon dates that are 1, 28, 59, or (very rarely) 58 days apart.|$|E
25|$|The crucial {{properties}} of {{this set of}} rules are that they are sound and complete. Informally this means that <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> <b>are</b> correct and that no other rules are required. These claims can be made more formal as follows.|$|E
25|$|Sandra Wilde in 1990 {{claimed the}} sounded-like-E version of <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>was</b> {{one of only}} two soundâ€“letter {{correspondence}} rules worth teaching in elementary schools. <b>The</b> <b>rule</b> <b>was</b> covered by five of nine software programs for spelling education studied by Barbara Mullock in 2012.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>rule</b> <b>is</b> {{also known}} as <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> against self-serving statements.|$|R
5000|$|We already saw in {{the base}} case that <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> ("all horses have the same color") was valid for [...] The {{inductive}} step showed that since <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>is</b> valid for , {{it must also be}} valid for , which in turn implies that <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>is</b> valid for [...] and so on.|$|R
25|$|There are {{eighteen}} {{rules in}} official play, designed {{to apply to}} all levels of bandy, although certain modifications for groups such as juniors, veterans or women are permitted. <b>The</b> <b>rules</b> <b>are</b> often framed in broad terms, which allow flexibility in their application depending {{on the nature of}} the game.|$|E
25|$|At still lower levels, <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> <b>are</b> often changed {{simply to}} make the game playable with limited resources, or to render it more {{convenient}} and enjoyable for the participants. Informal variants of the sport are played in areas as diverse as sandy beaches and ice floes.|$|E
25|$|Social Insurance pays a {{one time}} fee of ISK 30,000 {{for any kind}} of hearing aid. However, <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> <b>are</b> {{complicated}} and require that both ears have a significant hearing loss in order to qualify for reimbursement. BTE hearing aids range from ISK 60,000 to ISK 300,000.|$|E
25|$|Ironically, however, <b>the</b> <b>Rules</b> on Containers <b>were</b> {{subsequently}} eviscerated by the Federal Trade Commission, {{which found}} that <b>the</b> <b>Rules</b> <b>were</b> an impermissible restraint on trade.|$|R
5000|$|Until 14 January 1932, <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>was</b> that <b>the</b> {{wife of a}} British {{subject was}} deemed to be a British subject, and the wife of an alien was deemed to be an alien.

50|$|Structural {{business}} <b>rules</b> (static constraints) <b>are</b> {{treated as}} alethic necessities by default, where each {{state of the}} fact model corresponds to a possible world. Pragmatically, <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>is</b> understood to apply to all future states of the fact model, until <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>is</b> revoked or changed. For the model theory, the necessity operator is omitted from the formula. Instead, <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>is</b> merely tagged as a necessity. For compliance with Common Logic, such formulae can be treated as irregular expressions, with the necessity modal operator treated as an uninterpreted symbol.|$|R
25|$|Amateur evening cricket is {{a version}} of T20 cricket that is played informally {{throughout}} the UK and the world. <b>The</b> <b>rules</b> <b>are</b> {{similar to those of}} Twenty20 cricket, with some modifications designed to speed the game up and to ensure that the game cannot be dominated by a small group of skilled players.|$|E
25|$|Note: where {{changes in}} the house edge due to changes in <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> <b>are</b> stated in {{percentage}} terms, the difference is usually stated here in percentage points, not percentage; strictly speaking if, say, an edge of 10% is reduced to 9%, the amount is reduced by ten percent, or by one percentage point.|$|E
25|$|Mesons are {{classified}} into groups {{according to their}} isospin (I), total angular momentum (J), parity (P), G-parity (G) or C-parity (C) when applicable, and quark (q) content. The rules for classification are defined by the Particle Data Group, and are rather convoluted. <b>The</b> <b>rules</b> <b>are</b> presented below, in table form for simplicity.|$|E
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>rule</b> <b>was</b> {{then changed}} to allow just 50 moves in all {{positions}}. Some {{sources say that}} <b>the</b> 1989 <b>rule</b> <b>was</b> in effect for only a [...] "year or so" [...] or a [...] "few years" [...] , [...] but one source of <b>the</b> 1992 <b>rules</b> gives <b>the</b> pre-1984 wording: [...] "...increased for certain positions if it was announced in advance" [...] By 2001 <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>was</b> Article 9.3 and allowed 50 moves for all positions [...]|$|R
5000|$|Pre-1983 sennichite. <b>The</b> sennichite <b>rule</b> <b>was</b> {{previously}} {{defined by}} a sequence of moves (and not a position) that had three repetitions. <b>The</b> <b>rule</b> <b>was</b> changed to its current form in May 1983.|$|R
5000|$|The aim of <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>is</b> to {{guarantee}} anonymity to those speaking within its walls so that better international relations may <b>be</b> achieved. <b>The</b> <b>rule</b> <b>is</b> now used internationally {{as an aid}} to free discussion. [...] <b>The</b> original <b>rule</b> of 1927 <b>was</b> refined in October 1992 and again in 2002.

25|$|Wizard's Chess {{is played}} with pieces and a board {{identical}} to Chess. <b>The</b> <b>rules</b> <b>are</b> also unchanged. The pieces are magically animated, and they violently attack {{each other when}} performing a capture, by knocking the captured piece out and dragging it off the board. The players order the pieces to move using algebraic chess notation.|$|E
25|$|Claude Soucie, the {{inventor}} of LOA, died just as his game was beginning to reach {{a critical mass of}} interest. Some of the finer points of <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> <b>are</b> just now being standardized, without the benefit of appeal to Soucie. In all situations which were discussed by Sackson, his presentation is now generally accepted as authoritative.|$|E
25|$|The total {{impedance}} of many simple {{networks of}} components {{can be calculated}} using the rules for combining impedances in series and parallel. <b>The</b> <b>rules</b> <b>are</b> identical to those used for combining resistances, except that the numbers in general will be complex numbers. In the general case, however, equivalent impedance transforms in addition to series and parallel will be required.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>rules</b> <b>were</b> {{expanded}} over time, {{to cover}} other situations. Wrigley Field, {{which did not}} acquire lights until August 1988, would sometimes see games called due to darkness. <b>The</b> <b>rule</b> <b>was</b> extended to cover darkness, again {{in the sense of}} fairness, as the setting sun was equated to [...] "light failure".|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> British <b>Rule</b> <b>is</b> {{almost never}} used in games of poker. However, <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>is</b> {{sometimes}} suggested by players {{as a way}} of unsettling opponents who are unused to the different priority of the cards.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>rule</b> has <b>been</b> {{described}} as [...] "complex, fiddlesome and {{resulting in a}} disproportionate amount of work and expense" [...] and <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>is</b> often either excluded under a well drafted will, or simply ignored.|$|R
