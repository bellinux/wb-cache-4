5|$|Scholars {{have noted}} several <b>themes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> film, such as glorification of violence, {{conformation}} to feudal ethos, debate between social order and mobilised usurpers, homosocial bonding, and the film's {{role as a}} national allegory.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} many genres, {{including}} fantasy, drama, coming of age, and the British school story (which includes elements of mystery, thriller, adventure, horror and romance), {{the world of}} Harry Potter explores numerous themes and includes many cultural meanings and references.

5|$|Greed is {{the first}} main theme that is {{introduced}} into the book, and specifically the desire to obtain gold. In a similar manner to other <b>themes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> book, it changes throughout, becoming less of a focus near {{to the end of}} the novel, where Artemis is willing to part with a large sum of money to help someone else.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Tokyopop {{licensed}} The One I Love for an English-language translation in North America, {{and published}} it in October 2004. Viz Media republished the manga in February 2015. The manga {{has also been}} translated into other languages. Reviewers have identified a few <b>themes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> collection. They had a range of reactions to The One I Love: some considered it heartfelt entertainment, while others reviewed it less positively, as a badly done take on romance.|$|E
5|$|Jesus for President: Politics for Ordinary Radicals is a 2008 book co-written by Evangelical authors Shane Claiborne and Chris Haw, two {{important}} figures in New Monasticism. The book {{asserts that the}} countercultural <b>themes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ministry of Jesus, {{such as those of}} self-denial, are ignored by American Christians because they have become accustomed to exercising Christian privilege and are unwilling to give it up.|$|E

5|$|Loyalty, fidelity, and {{betrayal}} are significant <b>themes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> book, explored {{against the background}} of both planetary and interplanetary relations. Genly Ai is sent to Gethen as an envoy of the Ekumen, whose mission is to convince the various Gethenian nations that their identities will not be destroyed when they integrate with the Ekumen. At the same time, the planetary conflict between Karhide and Orgoreyn is shown as increasing nationalism, making it hard for those in each country to view themselves as citizens of the planet.|$|E
5|$|Major <b>themes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> series {{deal with}} adventure, {{forbidden}} love, {{the concept of}} nature vs. nurture, the reactions of different faiths meeting each other, and characters being a mix of good and bad. The authors draw inspiration from several natural locations and other authors such as J. R. R. Tolkien, J. K. Rowling, and William Shakespeare.|$|E
5|$|Rimsky-Korsakov {{followed}} the musical ideals espoused by The Five. He employed Orthodox liturgical <b>themes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Russian Easter Festival Overture, folk song in Capriccio Espagnol and orientalism in Scheherazade, possibly his best known work. He proved a prolific composer {{but also a}} perpetually self-critical one. He revised every orchestral work {{up to and including}} his Third Symphony—some, like Antar and Sadko, more than once. These revisions range from minor changes of tempo, phrasing and instrumental detail to wholesale transposition and complete recomposition.|$|E

5|$|Shortly after independence, filmmakers such as Jean-Paul Ngassa and Thérèse Sita-Bella {{explored}} similar <b>themes.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 1960s, Mongo Beti, Ferdinand Léopold Oyono {{and other}} writers explored post-colonialism, problems of African development, and {{the recovery of}} African identity. Meanwhile, in the mid-1970s, filmmakers such as Jean-Pierre Dikongué Pipa and Daniel Kamwa dealt with the conflicts between traditional and post-colonial society. Literature and films {{during the next two}} decades concentrated more on wholly Cameroonian themes.|$|E

5|$|The game is Barlow's first project {{since his}} {{departure}} from Climax Studios, {{after which he}} became independent. He wanted to develop a game that was dependent on the narrative, and avoided working on the game until he was settled on an idea that was possible to execute. Barlow eventually decided to create a police procedural game, and incorporate live action footage. He conducted research for the game by watching existing police interviews. Upon doing so, he discovered recurring <b>themes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> suspects' answers, and decided to incorporate ambiguity to the investigation in the game.|$|E

5|$|The life of Queen Catherine {{has been}} one of the most popular <b>themes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> history of Bosnia and Herzegovina, {{attracting}} the attention of scholars from the neighbouring countries of Croatia and Serbia as well. With the rise of ethnic nationalism, historians attempted to ascribe to her a particular national identity – Croat, Serb or Bosniak, which is completely anachronistic to medieval times.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 2005, Iron Maiden {{began work}} on A Matter of Life and Death, their fourteenth studio effort, {{released}} in autumn 2006. While not a concept album, war and religion are recurring <b>themes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lyrics, {{as well as in}} the cover artwork. The release was a critical and commercial success, earning the band their first top ten in the Billboard 200 and receiving the Album of the Year award at the 2006 Classic Rock Roll of Honour Awards. A supporting tour followed, during which they played the album in its entirety; response to this was mixed.|$|E
5|$|Carter was {{interested}} in the possibility that extraterrestrials were involved in ancient mass extinctions on Earth and used these <b>themes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> episode. Much of the episode was also inspired by Nikos Kazantzakis's novel The Last Temptation of Christ, and a scene showing an operation on Mulder has been thematically compared to the Crucifixion of Jesus. For the dream sequences, casting director Rick Millikan brought back many actors and actresses who had been absent from the show for several years, including Jerry Hardin as Deep Throat, Rebecca Toolan as Teena Mulder, and Megan Leitch as Samantha Mulder.|$|E

5|$|Chris Chibnall {{wanted to}} write a story that tackled the issue of loss and {{revolved}} around a missing person case. Executive producer Russell T Davies appreciated the character dynamics and domestic <b>themes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> episode and cited the script as one of his inspirations in continuing the series. Ruth Jones, who is generally better known for her comedic roles, was cast against type in the central guest role of Nikki Bevan. The episode was filmed largely on location in South Wales with the island of Flat Holm featuring prominently. Response to the episode was generally positive. Reviewers generally praised the episode for illuminating the conflicting elements of Gwen's character and providing a central dilemma with no easy answer. Some critics identified ostensible plot holes, though felt that the episode's emotional successes negated these.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{being set}} in space, the film uses motifs from {{shipwreck}} and wilderness survival stories about psychological change and resilience {{in the aftermath}} of a catastrophe. Cuarón uses the character, Stone, to illustrate clarity of mind, persistence, training, and improvisation in the face of isolation and the consequences of a relentless Murphy's law. The film incorporates spiritual or existential <b>themes,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> facts of Stone's daughter's accidental and meaningless death, and in the necessity of summoning the will to survive in the face of overwhelming odds, without future certainties, and with the impossibility of rescue from personal dissolution without finding this willpower. Calamities occur but only the surviving astronauts see them.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the minor <b>themes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> B strain, the third section is upbeat but with bittersweet harmonies, returning once again to the scale of B-flat major. Here, for the first time, the piece departs from the standard left-hand pattern that characterizes most ragtime. This section of the piece {{has been compared to}} the style of twelve bar blues. The C strain also represents the only known time when Joplin departs from the standard sixteen-bar form, being instead 24 bars in length with an uneven 14- and 10-bar division. Its first 12 measures parallel the 12-bar blues form and the next two measures extend the subdominant as a transition into the last ten bars.|$|E
