5|$|As on {{most large}} warships, {{there have been}} several {{incidents}} involving the death or injury of one or more crew members, although most have involved freak accidents or failures, such as a man overboard as a result of poor weather. One of the highest-profile incidents was on 26 May 1981, when an EA-6B Prowler crashed on the flight deck of Nimitz, killing 14 crewmen and injuring 45 others. Forensic <b>testing</b> <b>of</b> the personnel involved showed that several tested positive for marijuana. While this in itself was not found to have directly caused the crash, the findings of the investigation prompted the introduction of mandatory drug <b>testing</b> <b>of</b> all service personnel.|$|E

For example, the auditor might use computer software to compare the unit selling price on duplicate sales invoices with an electronic file of approved prices as a <b>test</b> <b>of</b> the accuracy objective for sales transactions.
