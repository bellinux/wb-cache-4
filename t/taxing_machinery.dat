To achieve {{the objective of the}} study, relevant secondary data were collected from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Statistical Bulletin, Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), Office of the Accountant General of the Federation, and other relevant government agencies. The data collected were analysed using relevant descriptive statistics and econometric models such as White test, Ramsey RESET test, Breusch Godfrey test, Jacque Berra test, Augmented Dickey Fuller test, Johansen test, and Granger Causality test. The results from the various test shows that tax reforms is positively and significantly related to economic growth and that tax reforms granger cause economic growth. On the basis of the findings, the study concluded that tax reforms improves the revenue generating machinery of government to undertake socially desirable expenditure that will translate to economic growth in real output and per capita basis.

This was the reason for the high boiler pressure of , which allowed smaller pistons. Reciprocating mass of the connecting rods was also reduced with the use of four, rather than the more usual six, driving wheels. The main rods connected to the first pair of driven wheels rather than the (more conventional) second; again, this reduced the reciprocating mass as well as providing more even power throughout the stroke.

40|$|The human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) {{regulatory}} protein Tax activates transcription of the proviral long terminal repeats {{and a number}} of cellular promoters. We have developed an in vitro system to characterize the mechanism by which Tax interacts with the host cell transcription <b>machinery.</b> <b>Tax</b> was purified from cells infected with a baculovirus expression vector. Addition of these Tax preparations to nuclear extracts from uninfected human T lymphocytes activated transcription of the HTLV-I long terminal repeat approximately 10 -fold. Transcription-stimulatory activity copurified with the immunoreactive 40 -kDa Tax polypeptide on gel filtration chromatography, and, as expected, the effect of recombinant Tax was diminished in HTLV-I-infected T-lymphocyte extracts containing endogenous Tax. Tax-mediated transactivation in vivo has been previously shown to require 21 -bp-repeat Tax-responsive elements (TxREs) in the promoter DNA. Stimulation of transcription in vitro was also strongly dependent on these sequences. To investigate the mechanism of Tax transactivation, cellular proteins that bind the 21 -bp-repeat TxREs were prepared by DNA affinity chromatography. Recombinant Tax markedly increased the formation of a specific host protein-DNA complex detected in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. These data suggest that Tax activates transcription through a direct interaction with cellular proteins that bind to the 21 -bp-repeat TxREs...|$|R
2500|$|The London and Parisian Motor Co. was an Anglo-French venture {{registered}} in London in 1908 and largely backed with British capital and expertise. The castings and forgings for its engines {{were made in}} Sheffield where the company was originally based, then taken to France for assembly. The reason for this {{was that there was}} much more aeronautical activity in France than in England in 1908, but the French were <b>taxing</b> imported <b>machinery.</b> [...] The French works were in Courbevoie in the Paris suburbs. By 1909 there was more aviation activity in England and E.N.V. decided to begin full manufacture at home, at Willesden, London. [...] At that time a separate company was formed to produce the aero-engines in Willesden, The E.N.V. Motor Syndicate Ltd. [...] E.N.V. was a contraction of French phrase [...] "en-V" [...] ("in a V"), which was a common name at the time for a V-engine. Indeed, most of their engines were in fact 90° V-8s — the idea for the V8 engine itself originated with French engineer Leon Levavasseur in 1902. All of E.N.V.'s V8 engines were water-cooled inline engines. [...] The first two models were powerful but heavy, while the later [...] "D" [...] and [...] "F" [...] types were lighter yet reliable, with power ratings of 37hp (26kW) and 74hp (51kW) respectively. [...] These were widely used from 1909 in both Britain and France; in England well known pioneers like S.F. Cody, A.V. Roe, Claude Grahame-White, Moore-Brabazon and T.O.M. Sopwith used them. In France, pioneers such as Henri Rougier, Pierre de Caters, Arthur Duray and Rene Metrot won prizes flying E.N.V. powered Voisin aircraft, and other French manufacturers like Farman and Antoinette used E.N.V.s in some of their machines. After about mid-1911, these water-cooled inline engines began to fall out of favour, superseded by the much lighter air-cooled radial engines from Anzani and in particular by the high-performing newcomer, the rotary engine, introduced by the Gnome et Rhône company. [...] A good power-to-weight ratio was rather less critical for use in airship installations, and several used E.N.V. engines. The 100hp (75kW) V-8 submitted to the Naval and Military Aero Engine Contest of 1914 proved to have serious design flaws {{and as a result of}} its failure E.N.V withdrew from engine production.|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundScaling protein {{production}} {{seems like}} a simple perturbation of transcriptional control. However, when embryonic tendon fibroblasts have to produce > 50 % procollagen and secrete it from the cell 4 {{times faster than the}} average protein, this <b>taxes</b> the cellular <b>machinery</b> and requires a fresh look at how the pathway is controlled. Ascorbate, a reducing agent, can stimulate procollagen production 6 -fold. Procollagen mRNA levels goes up 6 -fold but requires 3 days for the cell to accomplish this task. Secretion rates, the last cellular step in the process, also goes up 6 -fold but this occurs in < 1 h. What regulatory scheme is consistent with these properties?Scope of this reviewThis review focuses on fibroblasts that make high levels of procollagen (type I) and how they regulate the collagen pathway. Data from many different labs are relevant to this problem {{but it is hard to}} see the bigger picture from a large number of small studies. This review aims to consolidate this data into a coherent model and this requires solutions to some controversies and postulating potential mechanisms where the details are still missing. Major conclusionsIn high collagen producing cells, the pathway is controlled by post-transcriptional regulation. This requires feedback control between secretion and translation rates that is based on the helical structure of the procollagen molecule and additional tissue-specific modifications. General significanceTranscriptional control does not scale well to high protein production with rapid regulation. New paradigms lead to better understanding of collagen diseases and tendon morphogenesis...|$|R

40|$|Fish {{production}} in Malaysia increased steadily at 4. 5 % per annum from 801 000 t in 1985 to 1 280 906 t in 1997. Most {{of the production}} was contributed by marine capture fisheries, amounting to 1 168 973 t (91 % of total production) in 1997, while the rest (132 700 t or 8 %) came from inland fisheries and aquaculture. About 72 % of the marine landings, or 837 574 t, were from Peninsular Malaysia while the rest were from the states of Sabah, Sarawak, and the Federal Territory Labuan. Marine fisheries thus contributed significantly in terms of employment in Peninsular Malaysia compared to Sabah and Sarawak. In 1997 the value added by the fisheries sector was estimated at about RM 2 million (US$ 0. 71 million at 1 US$ = RM 2. 82), which represents about 1. 5 % {{of gross domestic product}} (GDP) or 11. 1 % of the agricultural GDP. Manufacturing, services and construction sectors are the other contributors to GDP in Malaysia. Fisheries net export earnings reached a negative value (-RM 39. 6 million or US$ 14. 04 million) because Malaysia was a net importer of fish in terms of both quantity and value in 1997. Furthermore, the number of fishers decreased at a rate of 2. 2 % per annum from 102 900 in 1985 to 82 200 in 1995. In 1997, there were 79 616 fisherfolk in Malaysia and this constituted only about 1 % of the total employment in the country. With declining catch and a higher incidence of poverty among the fishing households, fishers, particularly the younger ones, are attracted to better job opportunities in other sectors such as manufacturing. Fish and fish products comprise about 60 % of total animal protein consumed in the country (compared to poultry, beef and pork), a rate much higher than in other Asian countries. Per capita annual consumption of fish increased from 9. 42 kg in 1960 to 23. 05 kg in 1989, and further to 39. 1 kg in 1995. This is expected to rise to 56 kgâ•–capitaâ•–annum- 1 in 2010. Fishing operations in Malaysia can be classified into commercial and non-commercial (traditional). Trawl nets, fish purse seines, shrimp trawl nets and anchovy purse seines are classified as commercial gear, while drift nets and other traditional gear such as hook and lines, traps and lift nets are classified as non-commercial. About 63 % (15 611) of fishers are involved in non-commercial (traditional) fishing and the rest in commercial operations. The majority of traditional fishers are involved in other economic activities such as farming, contract work, retailing and tourism. Due to limited fisheries resources, the number of registered fishing vessels decreased from 22 026 units in 1980 to 14 211 units in 1997 on the West Coast of Peninsular Malaysia. Commercial fishing vessels are generally larger than 25 GRT (gross registered tonnage) with engine capacities up to 180 HP, while traditional fishing vessels are generally less than 15 GRT with engine capacities less than 18 HP. Normally commercial fishing boats use modern navigational aids like Geographic Positioning Systems (GPS) and are fitted with Refrigerated Sea Water (RSW). The capital investment for a trawler and purse seiner of 25 - 69. 9 GRT was RM 100 000 in 1989, including the boat hull, engine, gearbox, net and accessory equipment. Annual net profit derived from a 25 - 39. 9 GRT trawler in 1989 was RM 36 520, while that from a 40 - 69. 9 GRT trawler was RM 43 601. For the fish purse seine, 25 - 39. 9 GRT and 40 - 69. 9 GRT vessels made net profits of RM 40 102 and RM 63 562 respectively. In terms of productivity efficiency, the larger vessels, trawl and purse seine (40 - 69. 9 GRT) are more efficient than the smaller fleet (25 - 39. 9 GRT). Labor productivity for large trawls is 219 kg per person-day compared to the smaller trawl of only 129 kgâ•–person-day- 1. For the purse seine fishery, large vessel labor productivity is 69 kgâ•–person-day- 1 and for the smaller vessel only 53 kgâ•–person-day- 1. The government has decided {{to reduce the number of}} trawl vessels especially those operating in inshore areas, and to encourage fishers to explore new areas in the offshore waters. In order to conserve fishery resources, the government has tried to provide incentives through tax deductions for Ã¦pioneer statusÃ†, investment tax allowances, tax exemptions for imports and a sales <b>tax</b> on fishing <b>machinery,</b> raw materials and equipment.

5000|$|In 1833 Fielden {{supported}} Lord Ashley’s Ten-Hour Bill. Instead, Althorp’s Act (the 1833 Factory Act) was passed, Althorp commenting that if adult millworkers {{wanted to}} limit their hours of work they should do it themselves. Fielden joined with others to form a National Regeneration Society which intended to accumulate enough adherent millworkers to insist to mill-owners that adults as well as children should work {{no more than an}} eight-hour day [...] This led to a split with those factory reform leaders still pinning their hopes in securing a ten-hour act by legislation. A plan to coordinate presentation of demands to millowners in spring 1834 came to nothing. It amounted to formation of a national trade union; this was difficult at the best of times (which 1834, the year of the conviction of the Tolpuddle Martyrs, was not) and the union was broken up by pre-emptive action by employers [...] In 1835 he suggested that the government should set minimum piece-rates for hand-loom work. [...] In response to hand-loom weavers doubting his sincerity and proposing instead other measures including a tax on power looms, Fielden concurred with the desirability of many of the other measures, but held that the best <b>tax</b> on <b>machinery</b> was to limit the hours it could be worked. In 1836 he opposed Poulet Thomson’s Bill, speaking against it in Parliament and producing a pamphlet The Curse of the Factory System ("A Short Account of the Origin of Factory Cruelties; of the Attempts to Protect the Children by Law; of Their Present Sufferings; Our Duty Towards Them; Injustice of Mr Thomson's Bill; the Folly of the Political Economists; a Warning Against Sending the Children of the South into the Factories of the North") whose object he summarised as [...] "to show that the workpeople have been and are cruelly treated; that they have not idly asked for protection, but that humanity and justice require it; that we shall do ourselves no harm by granting it to them; but always avowing, that I would cast manufactures to the winds, rather than see the workpeople enslaved, maimed, vitiated, and broken in constitution and in heart, as these pages will but too amply prove they now are."He spoke of his own experience as a factory child forty years previous, and showed why the work was as (or more) onerous for children in the 1830s as he had found it in the 1790s: As I have been personally and from an early age engaged in the operations connected with factory labour; that is to say, for about 40 years, a short account of my own experience may not be useless in this place, as it is this experience which teaches me to scoff at the representations of those who speak of the labour of factories as [...] " [...] very light," [...] and [...] "so easy, as to require no muscular exertion." [...] I well remember being set to work in my father's mill when I was little more than ten years old; my associates, too, in the labour and in recreation are fresh in my memory. Only a few of them are now alive; some dying very young, others living to become men and women; but many of those who lived have died off before they had attained the age of fifty years, having the appearance of being much older, a premature appearance of age which I verily believe was caused {{by the nature of the}} employment in which they had been brought up. For several years after I began to work in the mill, the hours of labour at our works did not exceed ten in the day, winter and summer, and even with the labour of those hours, I shall never forget the fatigue I often felt before the day ended, and the anxiety of us all to be relieved from the unvarying and irksome toil we had gone through before we could obtain relief by such play and amusements as we resorted to when liberated from our work. I allude to this fact, because it is not uncommon for persons to infer, that, because the children who work in factories are seen to play like other children when they have time to do so, the labour is, therefore, light, and does not fatigue them. The reverse of this conclusion I know to be the truth. I know the effect which ten hours' labour had upon myself; I who had the attention of parents better able than those of my companions to allow me extraordinary occasional indulgence. And he knows very little of human nature who does not know, that, to a child, diversion is so essential, that it will undergo, even exhaustion in its amusements. I protest, therefore, against the reasoning, that, because a child is not brought so low in spirit as to be incapable of enjoying the diversions of a child, it is not worked to the utmost that its feeble frame and constitution will bear.I well know, too, from my own experience, that the labour now undergone in the factories is much greater than it used to be, owing to the greater attention and activity required by the greatly-increased speed which is given to the machinery that the children have to attend to, when we compare it with what it was 30 to 40 years ago; and, therefore, I fully concur with the government commissioners, that a restriction to ten hours per day, is not a sufficient protection to children.The work at which I was employed in my boyhood, while it was limited to ten hours a day, was similar to the work that children have to do in the woollen mills of Yorkshire at the present time, with this difference, that wool is the manufacture in the Yorkshire mills to which I allude, and the manufacture that I was employed in was cotton, the mode of manufacturing which has been altogether changed since that period by the improvements made in machinery. These are facts which I mention, because the labour of the child in the woollen now, is what its labour in the cotton was then, the work being done on what are called [...] "billies" [...] and [...] "jennies"; and I mention them, too, because the woollen manufacturers would have it believed that the work of children in woollen mills is still lighter than that in the cotton factories, and that children, much younger than those whose labour is now limited to eight hours a day, may without injury to their health, be worked 69 hours per week. Indeed, it is on this, that the Yorkshire mill-owners have petitioned the House of Commons to allow them to work children of eight years of age as many as 72 hours in the week, or 12 hours in the day ! The 'curse of the factory system' was not that the system existed, but that it had been left unregulated. Consequently, improvements in machinery allowed no improvement in hours and conditions for the workforce; instead there was a race to the bottom: Most of the masters are obliged to admit the excessive hours of labour imposed on children, and the ministers have done it in the most solemn manner; but they cannot interfere with the labour, the [...] "free labour" [...] of the adult, because that is against sound principle! According to their own showing, it is a choice of evils; bur, contrary to reason, contrary to all acknowledged principle and to universal practice, they would choose the greater: they would overwork the child, though nature forbids it, rather than shorten the labour of the adult, who is also overworked. In short, their [...] "principle", their true and scarcely disguised [...] "principle [...] " [...] is the principle of pelf against nature.Here, then, is the [...] "curse" [...] of our factory system: as improvements in machinery have gone on, the [...] "avarice of masters" [...] has prompted many to exact more labour from their hands than they were fitted by nature to perform, and those who have wished for the hours of labour to be less for all ages than the legislature would even yet sanction, have had no alternative but to conform more or less to the prevailing practice, or abandon the trade altogether ...|$|R
