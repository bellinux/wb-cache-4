500|$|For {{the filming}} of the chestburster scene, the cast members knew that the {{creature}} would be bursting out of Hurt, and had seen the chestburster puppet, but {{they had not been}} told that fake blood would also be bursting out in every direction from high-pressure pumps and squibs. The scene was shot in one take using an artificial torso filled with blood and viscera, with Hurt's head and arms coming up from underneath the table. The chestburster was shoved up through the torso by a puppeteer who held it on a stick. When the creature burst through the chest a stream of blood shot directly at Veronica Cartwright, shocking her enough that she fell over and went into hysterics. According to Tom Skerritt: [...] "What you saw on camera was the real response. She had no idea what <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>happened.</b> All of a sudden this thing just came up." [...] The creature then runs off-camera, an effect accomplished by cutting a slit in the table for the puppeteer's stick to go through and passing an air hose through the puppet's tail to make it whip about.|$|E

[...] Anthony Burch from Destructoid gave a positive review, stating that it [...] "is so stylistically unified, so consistently cool and weird and imaginative, that it's damn near impossible not to fall in love with—even as the game ends and you're wondering what <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>happened,</b> and why." [...] He also applauded several technical and design aspects of the game, expressing appreciation for the game's [...] "stylistic choices", as well as the [...] "nigh unbelievable" [...] bloom effects featured in the game. Burch concluded that Gravity Bone is [...] "a great ride", and that the [...] "atmosphere and style alone will barrel you through to the journey's end, which comes all too soon." ...|$|E

I can't. Serious Grimm had a good run, but the transformation into quirky comic book theatrics and silliness is complete. And that's okay. There's a place for rubber masks, iffy CGI, and loads and loads of cheese. Batcrap craziness has always been Grimms bread and butter, even when the series decided to try on the 'grown-up' pants and dabble in deep and meaningful symbolism and real-world parallels. Grimm still seems to think of itself as some kind of fantastical mirror to the real world and I guess in a way it still is. Sometimes I don't know what <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> is <b>happening</b> in real life, just like I haven't been able to make heads or tails or fangs or claws of what's going on in Grimms Portland this season." ...|$|R

Richmond rover Kevin Bartlett, a renowned finals performer, was prominent early, gathering kicks at will. The first key incident in the match occurred at the 4-minute mark of the quarter. Carlton captain-coach John Nicholls, who had masterminded Richmond's demise in the previous year's Grand Final, was coming out to mark a long kick from Alex Jesaulenko when he was sensationally felled with a high shirtfront by Richmond defender Laurie Fowler, who was running back with the flight of the ball. Fans and players were stunned {{at the sight of}} one of football's most imposing figures laying groggy on the ground and unable to rise. Teammate David McKay reflected thus on the incident: To see someone who was a colossus knocked out like that really stung. He was such an enormous presence on the ground as a leader that we thought, [...] "Shit, what's going to happen now?" ... You could talk to any player from that day and they'd tell you we were stunned. I'm not saying that was the reason Richmond won on the day, but we were starting to think twice about what <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> was <b>happening</b> out there. The impact of that incident still resonates decades later, and has been replayed on television many times since.

If Nick had run through me the whole thing would have been forgotten. Nicholls lay motionless for at least three minutes, whilst being attended to by trainers.
