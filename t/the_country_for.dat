40|$|This paper uses an {{adaptation}} of Vahid and Engle's common trend/common cycle analysis to estimate trend and cyclical export elasticities for trading partner income and real exchange rates <b>for</b> 36 <b>countries.</b> <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>countries</b> <b>for</b> which both types of income elasticities can be identified, the cyclical elasticity is on average {{more than twice as}} large as the trend elasticity.
