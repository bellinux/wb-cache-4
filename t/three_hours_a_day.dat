5|$|Velvet Revolver soon gained major label {{attention}} with Warner Bros. and Chrysalis. RCA and Elektra were {{also interested in}} signing the band. They eventually signed with RCA Records. They recorded their album at NRG Recording Studios, while Slash recorded his guitar parts at a smaller studio on the southern corner between Highland Avenue and Sunset Boulevard. During recording, Weiland could only work for <b>three</b> <b>hours</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> due to a court order mentioning {{that he was to}} stay in a halfway house.

His stepmother informed him that when he graduated high school he would be {{thrown out of the}} house. Chris had been able to leave home on a football scholarship and would later play in the National Football League, but Washington himself had nowhere to go. He trained for <b>three</b> <b>hours</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> {{toward the end of his}} senior season, and showed up uninvited at a playground game featuring top high school players from Washington and Pennsylvania, where he talked his way into the game. Tom Young, who had recently left his job as an assistant coach at Maryland University to become head coach at American University, saw him play there, and although Washington did not perform particularly well, Young was impressed by his hustle and how he ignored the poor treatment he received from the people who organized the game.|$|E

In 2004 it became a full time channel, broadcasting motors programming during the day and adult programming in the late evening although the adult programming was dropped when the channel went free-to-air in 2005. It lasted longest of all the channels, and ran until 2010, when it was closed to make way for ITV HD. Most of its programmes were transferred to ITV4.|$|E
25|$|Initially, {{the paid}} fire service only covered present day Manhattan, until {{the act of}} 1865 which united Brooklyn with Manhattan to form the Metropolitan District. The same year the fire {{department}} consisted of 13 Chief Officers and 552 Company Officers and firemen. The officers and firemen worked a continuous tour of duty, with <b>three</b> <b>hours</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> off for meals and one day off a month, and were paid salaries according to their rank or grade. 1865 also saw the first adoption of regulations, although they were fairly strict and straitlaced. Following several large fires in 1866 which resulted in excessive fire losses and a rise in insurance rates, the fire department was reorganized {{under the command of}} General Alexander Shaler, and with military discipline the paid department reached its full potential which resulted in a general reduction in fire losses. In 1870 the merit system of promotion in the Fire Department was established. Southwestern Westchester County (which would later become the western Bronx) was annexed by New York in 1874 and the volunteers there were phased out and replaced by the paid department. This pattern was repeated as City services expanded elsewhere.|$|E

If prey patches are not sufficiently dense, or are located too deep in the water, the whale has to spend a larger portion of its day searching for food.

Originally named The O'Franken Factor but renamed The Al Franken Show on July 12, 2004, the show aired <b>three</b> <b>hours</b> <b>a</b> <b>day,</b> {{five days a week}} for three years. The stated goal of the show was to provide the public airwaves with more progressive views to counter what Franken perceived was the dominance of conservative syndicated commentary on the radio: [...] "I'm doing this because I want to use my energies to get Bush unelected," [...] he told a New York Times reporter in 2004. Franken's last radio show on Air America Radio was on February 14, 2007, {{at the end of which}} he announced his candidacy for the United States Senate.|$|E

Various family members would accompany her, living in the comfortable two-story house she modestly called a [...] "cottage" [...] or [...] "hut". In Hartford she was barraged with requests and {{at the center of a}} whirl of activity. Mandarin was not connected to a telegraph line until the 1880s and mail was received only once a week by boat.

500|$|Filming {{began in}} February 2005; the crew filmed for ten {{hours a day}} for thirty-one days. The eleven-year-old Palmer had to follow the United States' child labor laws, which necessitated {{spending}} at least <b>three</b> <b>hours</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> at school, one on recreation, and one at lunch. Nevertheless, Palmer appeared in almost every scene, about which Ganis commented, [...] "I honestly don't know how we figured it out, but we did". To get the filming done on time, Atchison storyboarded the scenes ahead of time and chatted with cinematographer David Mullen, the production designer Warren Young, and Glenn Farr to compile a list of scenes. This way, the filming team began each day knowing what shots they would take, their order, and the performances scheduled for each day. Most of the filming took place in South Los Angeles, which Atchison picked as the filming location due to their low budget. Scenes were also filmed at the University of Southern California, Hollywood Palladium—which stood in for the Grand Ballroom of the Washington, D.C. Hyatt Hotel—and Venice High School.|$|E

500|$|In 2004, Jovovich reprised {{the role}} of Alice in the sequel to Resident Evil, [...] The role {{required}} her to do fight training for <b>three</b> <b>hours</b> <b>a</b> <b>day,</b> {{in addition to the}} three months prior to filming in which she had [...] "gun training, martial arts, everything". Apocalypse received even more negative reactions from the critics than the first film, but it was an even greater commercial success, ranking number one at the box office unlike the first film. Following the release of the film, Jovovich was unhappy with the critical results and director Alexander Witt's effort. She noted during an interview that year that her large action films take care of the commercial part of her career, while she acts in [...] "independent little films that never come out" [...] to appease her artistic side, and [...] "It's a good balance". The following year, she was featured in Gore Vidal's faux trailer remake of Caligula, as Drusilla. In 2006, Jovovich's film, the science fiction/action thriller Ultraviolet, was released on March 3. She played the title role of Violet Song jat Shariff, a role that also involved heavily choreographed fight sequences. It was not screened for critics, but when reviewed, it was critically panned, grossing $31 million worldwide. That year, Jovovich also starred in [...]45, as Kat, the revenge driven girlfriend of an illegal gun and drug dealer with Scottish actor and DJ Angus Macfadyen.|$|E
500|$|Harrison Ford reprises {{the role}} of Dr. Henry [...] "Indiana" [...] Jones, Jr. To prepare for the role, the 64-year-old Ford spent <b>three</b> <b>hours</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> at a gym, practiced with the bullwhip for two weeks, and relied on a high-protein diet of fish and vegetables. Ford had kept fit during the series' hiatus anyway, as he hoped for another film. He {{performed}} many of his own stunts because stunt technology had become safer since 1989, and he also felt it improved his performance. It is {{also said that he}} still fit into his pants from Raiders of the Lost Ark. He argued, [...] "The appeal of Indiana Jones isn't his youth but his imagination, his resourcefulness. His physicality {{is a big part of}} it, especially the way he gets out of tight situations. But it's not all hitting people and falling from high places. My ambition in action is to have the audience look straight in the face of character and not at the back of a capable stuntman's head. I hope to continue that no matter how old I get." [...] Ford felt his return would reduce U.S. ageism (he refused to dye his hair for the role), because of the film's family appeal: [...] "This is a movie which is geared not to [...] segment of the demographic, an age-defined segment ... We've got a great shot at breaking the movie demographic constraints." [...] He told Koepp to add more references to his age in the script. Spielberg said Ford was not too old to play Indiana: [...] "When a guy gets to be that age and he still packs the same punch, and he still runs just as fast and climbs just as high, he's gonna be breathing a little heavier at the end of the set piece. And I felt, 'Let's have some fun with that. Let's not hide that. Spielberg recalled the line in Raiders that said, [...] "It's not the years, it's the mileage," [...] and felt he could not tell the difference between Ford during the shoots for Last Crusade and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.|$|E
