The Stones considered their own performance lacklustre, and the project was never broadcast. The Who had not released an album in over a year, and had not completed the recording of Tommy, which continued well into 1969, interspersed with gigs at weekends.

500|$|In {{designing}} the costumes for the Pashtun people and Taliban forces, Stofsky aimed {{to create a}} visual distinction between the villagers and Taliban fighters. [...] "Luttrell survived because of the age-old tradition of the Pashtun culture in providing hospitality and safety to those that enter their home", she explained. [...] "We dyed the Taliban's costumes black, charcoal, wine, and indigo and kept the villagers light. Their humanity prevails. This is what we hoped to get across." [...] Stofsky utilized a North Hollywood-based Afghan vendor, Moe Noorzai, for traditional Afghan clothing including vests, pants, dresses and Kashmir scarves. Stofsky also had a New Mexico-based tailor produce all of the turbans featured in the film. Zarin Mohammad Rahimi, an Afghan refugee who fled to the United States to avoid the Taliban, and his sons, Muhammad Nawroz Rahimi and Nawaz Rahimi, were hired to act as technical advisors during production. The Rahimis collaborated with Stofsky, {{as well as the}} wardrobe and casting departments, <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>them</b> <b>understand</b> the language, customs and fighting methods of the Pashtun villagers and Taliban fighters. The eldest Rahimi also played the role of an elderly shepherd in a crucial scene.|$|E

A spiritual awakening {{is meant to be}} achieved by taking the Twelve Steps, and sobriety is furthered by volunteering for AA and regular AA meeting attendance or contact with AA members. Members are encouraged to find an experienced fellow alcoholic, called a sponsor, <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>them</b> <b>understand</b> and follow the AA program. The sponsor should preferably have experience of all twelve of the steps, be the same sex as the sponsored person, and refrain from imposing personal views on the sponsored person.

40|$|The Ronald E. McNair Scholars Program‘s {{goal is to}} {{introduce}} first-generation, low-income, underrepresented group college students to effective strategies for succeeding in graduate programs. One way to explore program effectiveness beyond graduate admission is to ask the McNair graduates themselves. This interview study explores McNair graduates understandings of issues they face in adjusting to graduate school and how McNair participation prepared them for addressing these issues. Typically McNair program evaluations emphasize the collection and analysis of quantitative data – e. g. academic performance and degree attainment; however, little qualitative {{research has been conducted}} on graduate‘s perceptions of the impact of program participation on graduate school adjustment and success. Using Bourdieu‘s concept of cultural capital, along with Sociology-based ideas of role-as-resource and role mastery, this study will explore students‘ perceptions of the McNair program‘s effectiveness in regards <b>to</b> <b>helping</b> <b>them</b> <b>understand</b> the ―graduate student‖ role and to use that role to succeed in graduate school.
