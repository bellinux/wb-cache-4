5|$|Lonely and needing {{someone to}} care for his {{children}} and help with <b>the</b> <b>sewing</b> and other chores, Mala takes the young girl Iva as his new wife. But Mala still longs for Aba, and their relationship is a cold one. The Eskimos go hunting caribou by stampeding the animals into a lake and then hunting them with bow and arrow and spears from boats. Mala is haunted by Aba's death, and after pouring out his grief through dance and prayer he changes his name to Kripik. Kripik's attitude toward Iva softens dramatically, and they make love. The hunter whom Mala welcomed to the village the previous year returns to his village, and gives Kripik his wife in gratitude. The woman is {{more than happy to}} live with Mala, and Mala makes love to her as well.|$|E
5|$|Several {{commemorative}} {{figures were}} created in remembrance of Agoncillo's historic family. On November 27, 1955, a marker was erected by the National Historical Institute of the Philippines and a museum was established in Taal, Batangas in accordance with her last wish and was named Marcela Marino Agoncillo Museum and Monument. The museum is Agoncillo's ancestral house. The house-turned-museum permanently exhibits flags and a diorama depicting <b>the</b> <b>sewing</b> of the first flag. A bronze statue of her holding the flag was erected outside the house in its garden. In Hong Kong, a historical marker {{was created by the}} Hong Kong Antiquities Council at Morrison Hill Park to commemorate the site where the first Philippine flag was sewn. However, the place where the Agoncillos resided, the location of the Hong Kong Junta, and other locations of historical importance to Filipinos remain unmarked.|$|E
5|$|Many of the Plains Aborigines were matrilineal/matrifocal societies. A man {{married into}} a woman's family after a {{courtship}} {{period during which}} the woman was free to reject as many men as she wished. In the age-grade communities, couples entered into marriage in their mid-30s when a man {{would no longer be}} required to perform military service or hunt heads on the battle-field. In the matriarchal system of the Siraya, it was also necessary for couples to abstain from marriage until their mid-30s, when the bride's father would be in his declining years and would not pose a challenge to the new male member of the household. It was not until the arrival of the Dutch Reformed Church in the 17th century that the marriage and child-birth taboos were abolished. There is some indication that many of the younger members of Sirayan society embraced the Dutch marriage customs as a means to circumvent the age-grade system in a push for greater village power. Almost all indigenous peoples in Taiwan have traditionally had a custom of sexual division of labor. Women did <b>the</b> <b>sewing,</b> cooking and farming, while the men hunted and prepared for military activity and securing enemy heads in headhunting raids, which was a common practice in early Taiwan. Women were also often found in the office of priestesses or mediums to the gods.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2003 Rat selenoprotein W (SeW) {{promoter}} {{activity was}} investigated using different concentrations of cadmium, copper, and zinc. Two fragments (404 bp and 1265 bp) of <b>the</b> <b>SeW</b> promoter, containing a single metal response element (MRE), were ligated into the {{multiple cloning site}} of a pGL 3 -Basic reporter plasmid. The constructs were transfected into cultured rat C 6 (glial) and L 8 (myoblast) cells and promoter activity measured by means of luciferase reporter gene fused to <b>the</b> <b>SeW</b> promoter fragments in the reporter plasmid. With post-transfection exposure of these cell lines to these metals, copper and zinc, but not cadmium, significantly increased promoter activity of the unmutated 1265 bp (not 404 bp) construct (p< 0. 05) only in the C 6 cells. Mutation of the MRE sequence abolished promoter response to metal exposure but did not eliminate promoter activity. The results suggest that SeW expression in glial cells can be increased on exposure to copper and zinc and that this response {{is dependent on the}} MRE sequence present in <b>the</b> <b>SeW</b> promoter. To understand transcriptional regulation of <b>the</b> <b>SeW</b> gene, we used in vitro binding assays to identify transcription factors that may be involved in the transcriptional regulation of <b>the</b> <b>SeW</b> gene. Using protein from rat C 6 (glial) cell nuclear extracts, oligonucleotides containing putative regulatory elements in <b>the</b> <b>SeW</b> promoter, and antibodies, we were able to show that the specificity protein 1 (Sp 1) transcription factor binds to the Sp 1 consensus sequence in <b>the</b> <b>SeW</b> promoter as well as the MRE. However, the MRE, GRE, AP- 1 and LF-A 1 did not yield any specific binding. Although, competition analysis showed specific binding at the TFII- 1 site, super-shift analysis using anti-TFII- 1 antibody did not yield any super-shifted band. Therefore <b>the</b> <b>SeW</b> gene may be a target for Sp 1 whose interaction with <b>the</b> <b>SeW</b> promoter may activate or repress <b>the</b> transcription of <b>SeW...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} low-rate waveform interpolation (WI) coding. It {{compares the}} existing, common slowly evolving waveform (SEW) quantisation scheme with two new schemes for representing and quantising <b>the</b> <b>SEW.</b> <b>The</b> first scheme uses a minimum phase estimate to reconstruct <b>the</b> <b>SEW</b> whilst <b>the</b> second scheme uses a pulse model whose parameters are implicitly transmitted in the quantised rapidly evolving waveform (REW). These new schemes maintain or reduce the bit rate required for transmission of <b>the</b> <b>SEW.</b> Results indicate that, for low rate WI coding, necessarily coarse SEW magnitude spectrum quantisation limits {{the contribution of}} <b>the</b> <b>SEW</b> to perceptual quality. Perceptual tests indicate that avoiding coarse spectral shape quantisation and using a fixed shape model that lends itself to smooth interpolation, maintains the perceptual quality of the synthesized speech. The proposed fixed shape model requires no bits for transmission, allowing a 12 percent reduction in the overall coder bit rate...|$|R

40|$|Prototype Waveform Coding {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{promising}} methods for speech coding at low bit rates over telecommunications networks. This thesis investigates quantisation mechanisms in Multi-Prototype Waveform (MPW) coding, and two prototype waveform quantisation algorithms for speech coding at bit rates of 2. 4 kb/s are proposed. Speech coders based on these algorithms have been found to be capable of producing coded speech with equivalent perceptual quality to that generated by the US 1016 Federal Standard CELP- 4. 8 kb/s algorithm. The two proposed prototype waveform quantisation algorithms are based on Prototype Waveform Interpolation (PWI). The first algorithm is in an open loop architecture (Open Loop Quantisation). In this algorithm, the speech residual is represented as a series of prototype waveforms (PWs). The PWs are extracted in both voiced and unvoiced speech, time aligned and quantised and, at the receiver, the excitation is reconstructed by smooth interpolation between them. For low bit rate coding, the PW is decomposed into a slowly evolving waveform (SEW) and a rapidly evolving waveform (REW). <b>The</b> <b>SEW</b> is coded using vector quantisation on both magnitude and phase spectra. <b>The</b> <b>SEW</b> codebook search is based on the best matching of <b>the</b> <b>SEW</b> and <b>the</b> <b>SEW</b> codebook vector. <b>The</b> REW phase spectra is not quantised, but it is recovered using Gaussian noise.
