This was a good and bad year for Jarrett; <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> that he won four races (New Hampshire was the fourth win in July) with the bad part being the fact that he suffered a hard crash and a minor concussion at the new Kansas Speedway. In an interview, Jarrett said that he did remember not being in the Protection One 400 but only getting on the plane to go to the racetrack. After that season, Jarrett's long-time crew chief Todd Parrott departed and Jimmy Elledge took over the role as a replacement. After seven races of the 2002 season, Jarrett and Parrott reunited, and Jarrett went on to clinch two victories (Pocono and Michigan) and rebounded to ninth in the final standings after the poor start to the year.|$|E

The options were over though after a Duscher own goal gave the home team the advantage and the boost to win the Liga title. Fortunately, Deportivo secured the second Liga position {{on the final day}} of the season after a 3-0 win against Real Madrid. Diego Tristán finished as Pichichi of the Liga with 21 goals while Valerón had found his place in the team. Once again the future looked bright.|$|E
