5|$|On {{the second}} day of the battle, news reached <b>the</b> <b>Allies</b> that their lines of retreat were no longer threatened; they {{therefore}} resolved to maintain their position. They staged a hit-and-run attack on some Cilician ships, capturing and destroying them. On the third day, however, the Persian fleet attacked <b>the</b> <b>Allies</b> lines in full force. In a day of savage fighting, <b>the</b> <b>Allies</b> held on to their position, but suffered severe losses (half the Athenian fleet was damaged); nevertheless, <b>the</b> <b>Allies</b> inflicted equal losses on the Persian fleet. That evening, <b>the</b> <b>Allies</b> received news of the fate of Leonidas and <b>the</b> <b>Allies</b> at Thermopylae. Since the Allied fleet was badly damaged, and since it no longer needed to defend the flank of Thermopylae, they retreated from Artemisium to the island of Salamis.|$|E
5|$|After the {{creation}} of the provisional government in Thessaloniki, negotiations between <b>the</b> <b>Allies</b> and king intensified. <b>The</b> <b>Allies</b> wanted further demobilization of the Greek army and the removal of military forces from Thessaly to insure the safety of their troops in Macedonia. The king wanted assurances that <b>the</b> <b>Allies</b> would not officially recognize or support Venizelos' provisional government and guarantees that Greece's integrity and neutrality would be respected. After several unproductive negotiations, on 23 October the king suddenly agreed to some of the demands required by <b>the</b> <b>Allies</b> including the removal of the Greek army from Thessaly. The king also volunteered war materiel and the Greek navy to assist them. In exchange, the king requested French Deputy Paul Bénazet to keep this agreement secret from the Central Powers.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the losses}} {{that had brought}} <b>the</b> <b>Allies</b> to the border of their homeland, German morale was {{surprisingly}} strong.

5|$|Following Thermopylae, the Persian {{army had}} {{proceeded}} to burn and sack the Boeotian cities {{which had not}} surrendered, Plataea and Thespiae, before taking possession of the now-evacuated city of Athens. The allied army, meanwhile, prepared to defend the Isthmus of Corinth. Xerxes wished for a final crushing defeat of <b>the</b> <b>Allies</b> to finish the conquest of Greece in that campaigning season; conversely <b>the</b> <b>allies</b> sought a decisive victory over the Persian navy that would guarantee {{the security of the}} Peloponnese. The ensuing naval Battle of Salamis ended in a decisive victory for <b>the</b> <b>Allies,</b> marking {{a turning point in the}} conflict.|$|E
5|$|Following the Noemvriana, <b>the</b> <b>Allies,</b> {{determined}} to remove Constantine I, established a naval blockade to isolate areas which supported the king. After {{the resignation of}} the king on 15 June 1917, Greece unified under a new king, Alexander, Constantine I's son, and the leadership of Eleftherios Venizelos. It joined World War I on the side of <b>the</b> <b>Allies.</b> By 1918, the mobilized Greek army provided the numerical superiority <b>the</b> <b>Allies</b> needed on the Macedonian front. The Allied army shortly thereafter defeated the Central Powers forces in the Balkans, followed by the liberation of Serbia and the conclusion of World War I.|$|E

5|$|In August 1942, <b>the</b> <b>Allies</b> {{succeeded in}} {{repelling}} a second attack against El Alamein and, {{at a high}} cost, managed to deliver desperately needed supplies to the besieged Malta. A few months later, <b>the</b> <b>Allies</b> commenced an attack of their own in Egypt, dislodging the Axis forces and beginning a drive west across Libya. This attack was followed up shortly after by Anglo-American landings in French North Africa, {{which resulted in the}} region joining <b>the</b> <b>Allies.</b> Hitler responded to the French colony's defection by ordering the occupation of Vichy France; although Vichy forces did not resist this violation of the armistice, they managed to scuttle their fleet to prevent its capture by German forces.

5|$|In Greece, despite British aid, little air {{opposition}} was encountered. As <b>the</b> <b>Allies</b> withdrew and resistance collapsed, <b>the</b> <b>Allies</b> began evacuating to Crete.

5|$|In early 1940 <b>the</b> <b>Allies</b> {{approved}} a naval campaign that was devised {{to seize the}} northern part of Norway, a neutral country, including the key port of Narvik, and possibly also to seize the iron mines at Gällivare in northern Sweden from which Germany obtained much of its iron ore. Since the Baltic freezes in winter, the iron ore was sent south by ship from Narvik at warmer times of the year. <b>The</b> <b>Allies</b> planned to begin by mining Norwegian waters, thus provoking a German reaction in Norway, and then <b>the</b> <b>Allies</b> planned to occupy much of the country. Unforeseen by <b>the</b> <b>Allies,</b> however, Germany had itself planned to occupy Norway, and on 9 April German troops occupied Denmark and began an invasion of Norway. German troops quickly overran much of the country. <b>The</b> <b>Allies</b> sent troops to Norway, but they met with little success, and on 26 April the War Cabinet ordered a withdrawal. The Prime Minister's opponents decided to turn the adjournment debate for the Whitsun recess into a challenge to Chamberlain, who soon heard about the plan. After initial anger, Chamberlain determined to fight.|$|E

5|$|Later on that day, a deserter {{from the}} Persian fleet, a Greek called Scyllias, swam into the Allied camp. He brought {{bad news for}} <b>the</b> <b>Allies</b> — whilst most of the Persian fleet was {{undergoing}} repairs, the Persians had detached 200 seaworthy ships to sail around the outer coast of Euboea, to block the escape route of the Allied fleet. The Persians {{did not want to}} attack <b>the</b> <b>Allies</b> yet, because they thought <b>the</b> <b>Allies</b> would simply flee, and so they sought to trap them. <b>The</b> <b>Allies</b> resolved to go and meet this detachment, to prevent being trapped, though they planned to leave by nightfall to prevent the Persians becoming aware of their plans.|$|E

5|$|Operation Ironside was a Second World War {{military}} deception {{undertaken by}} <b>the</b> <b>Allies</b> in 1944. It formed part of Operation Bodyguard, a broad strategic deception plan instigated by <b>the</b> <b>Allies</b> {{throughout the year}} to help cover the June 1944 invasion of Normandy. Ironside supported the overall deception by suggesting to the Germans that <b>the</b> <b>Allies</b> would subsequently land along the Bay of Biscay. It complemented efforts to deceive the Germans into believing that <b>the</b> <b>Allies</b> would also land in southern France at this time (Operation Vendetta). Bordeaux was an important port for the German war effort and had already been a target of commando raids two years earlier.

5|$|According to Herodotus, {{after the}} Persian navy began its maneuvers, Aristides {{arrived at the}} Allied camp from Aegina. Aristides had been {{recalled}} from exile {{along with the other}} ostracised Athenians on the order of Themistocles, so that Athens might be united against the Persians. Aristides told Themistocles that the Persian fleet had encircled <b>the</b> <b>Allies,</b> which greatly pleased Themistocles, as he now knew that the Persians had walked into his trap. The Allied commanders seem to have taken this news rather uncomplainingly, and Holland therefore suggests that they were party to Themistocles's ruse all along. Either way, <b>the</b> <b>Allies</b> prepared for battle, and Themistocles delivered a speech to the marines before they embarked on the ships. In the ensuing battle, the cramped conditions in the Straits hindered the much larger Persian navy, which became disarrayed, and <b>the</b> <b>Allies</b> took advantage to win a famous victory.|$|E
5|$|Adolf Hitler was {{concerned}} about a Balkan invasion, as the area had {{been the source of}} raw materials for the German war industry, including copper, bauxite, chrome and oil. <b>The</b> <b>Allies</b> knew of Hitler's fears, and they launched Operation Barclay, a deception operation to play upon his concerns and to mislead the Germans into thinking the Balkans were the objective, thereby keeping Sicily less defended than it could have been. In doing so, the deception operation reinforced German strategic thinking about the likely British target. To suggest the eastern Mediterranean was the target, <b>the</b> <b>Allies</b> set up a headquarters in Cairo, Egypt, for a fictional formation, the Twelfth Army, consisting of twelve divisions. Military manoeuvres were conducted in Syria, with numbers inflated by dummy tanks and armoured vehicles to deceive observers. Greek interpreters were recruited and <b>the</b> <b>Allies</b> stockpiled Greek maps and currency. Falsified communications about troop movements were generated from the Twelfth Army headquarters, while the Allied command post in Tunis – which was to be the headquarters of the Sicily invasion – reduced radio traffic by using land-lines wherever possible.|$|E
