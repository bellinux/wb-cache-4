5|$|An {{interchange}} {{is planned}} between MD 12 and US 113 south of Snow Hill {{in order to}} improve safety and traffic flow as a follow up to widening US 113; however, the project is currently on hold. This proposed interchange is to be a dumbbell interchange, a variation of the diamond interchange with two roundabouts on MD 12 where it intersects the ramps to US 113. The proposed cost needed <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>this</b> interchange is $24.2 million, which includes engineering, acquisition of land, and the actual construction.|$|E
5|$|Since the New Works Programme of the 1930s, London Transport and its successors {{have planned}} {{to extend the}} Bakerloo line south to a station on Camberwell Road. The {{original}} plans were abandoned due to the war before much construction had been completed. Construction again began in the 1950s and 1970s, but was abandoned each time. Transport for London still intend <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>this</b> extension but no {{date has been set}} for this.|$|E
5|$|Plans {{were made}} in 1993 to build a direct {{interchange}} between the turnpike and I-79 in Cranberry Township, Butler County. A contract was awarded <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>this</b> interchange in November 1995. In 1997, transportation officials agreed upon a design for the interchange. The project also included the movement {{the western end of}} the ticket system to a new toll plaza in Warrendale. The interchange project was delayed by a dispute with Marshall and Pine townships in Allegheny County, who wanted to prevent construction of the toll plaza as they thought it would cause noise, air and light pollution. Marshall Township eventually agreed to allow the toll plaza be built. Groundbreaking for the new interchange took place on February 22, 2002. The westbound Butler service plaza was closed because the Warrendale toll plaza was to be located at its site. On June 1, 2003, the plaza opened and the Gateway toll plaza became a flat-rate toll plaza, while all the exit toll plazas west of Warrendale closed. The direct interchange between the turnpike and I-79, connecting to US 19, opened on November 12, 2003. The project cost $44 million.|$|E

5|$|Regardless of the sequencing, {{artificial}} mottes {{had to be}} {{built by}} piling up earth; this work was undertaken by hand, using wooden shovels and hand-barrows, possibly with picks {{as well in the}} later periods. Larger mottes took disproportionately more effort to build than their smaller equivalents, because of the volumes of earth involved. The largest mottes in England, such as Thetford, are estimated to have required up to 24,000 man-days of work; smaller ones required perhaps as little as 1,000. Contemporary accounts talk of some mottes being built in a matter of days, although these low figures have led to suggestions by historians that either these figures were an underestimate, or that they refer to the construction of a smaller design than that later seen on the sites concerned. Taking into account estimates of the likely available manpower during the period, historians estimate that the larger mottes might have taken between four and nine months <b>to</b> <b>build.</b> <b>This</b> contrasted favourably with stone keeps of the period, which typically took up to ten years to build. Very little skilled labour was required to build motte and bailey castles, which made them very attractive propositions if forced peasant labour was available, as was the case after the Norman invasion of England. Where the local workforce had to be paid – such as at Clones in Ireland, built in 1211 using imported labourers – the costs would rise quickly, in this case reaching £20.|$|E

25|$|The {{inhabitants}} of Coventry themselves influenced {{the development of}} the town when between 1150 and 1200 they obtained three charters granted by the Earls of Chester and by Henry II. One of the privileges guaranteed that any merchants coming to the town would be free to trade in peace, and if they wished to settle they would be free of rent and dues for a period of two years from when they began <b>to</b> <b>build.</b> <b>This</b> quickly encouraged the exchange of local produce such as wool, soap, needles, metal and leather goods.|$|E

Nothing came of the proposal however. In 1946 the possibility of extending the railway to Red Lion Square, Hythe was investigated again, but the East Kent Road Car Co Ltd agreed to extend their bus service from Folkestone to terminate at the original Hythe station and the extension idea was dropped.|$|E
25|$|This stage {{involves}} {{the construction of}} a curve to the Westhafen and an eastern connection to Wedding inside the northern Ringbahn. Structural preparation for these junctions to these lines had already been made during the construction of the North–South mainline in 2006. From there, the existing line will run in a southerly direction (in the tunnel layer) to the Berlin Hauptbahnhof east of the North–South mainline. The realization of an intermediate station under the working name of Perleberger Brücke (as a two-level station in a V-shape) is provided as an option. It is proposed <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>this</b> 1,600-meter-long section by 2016.|$|E

25|$|Khan {{argued that}} for Comilla to develop rapidly, the farmers in its villages {{must be able}} to rapidly expand their {{production}} and sales. The main constraint they faced was inadequate local infrastructure, especially roads, drains, embankments and irrigation. However, even if the government had the resources <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>this</b> infrastructure, Khan argued, the problem would not be solved. Once constructed, infrastructure must be regularly maintained. The benefits of it must be managed effectively based on rules that users could accept and predict. Khan thought that view it was essential to develop 'vigorous local institutions' capable of performing this type of local maintenance and management.|$|E
25|$|Many Norwegian {{immigrants}} {{arrived in}} Rice County, Minnesota, {{and the surrounding}} area in the late 19thcentury. With nearly all the immigrants being Lutheran Christians, they desired a non-secular post-secondary institution in the Lutheran tradition that offered classes in all subjects in both Norwegian and English. The catalyst for founding St. Olaf was the Reverend Bernt Julius Muus; he sought out the help of the Rev. N. A. Quammen and H.Thorson. Together they petitioned their parishes and others to raise money in order to buy a plot of land on which <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>this</b> new institution. The three men succeeded in receiving around $10,000 in pledges, and thus went on to form a corporation and to buy a plot of land and four buildings (old Northfield schoolhouses) for accommodations for the school.|$|E
25|$|The Christian Teutonic Order {{had been}} waging an ongoing {{war against the}} Prussians during the 13th century; in order to entrench their gains, the Teutons built a number of castles in the area. One such castle was planned for a {{location}} between the Nemunas and Dangė rivers. A written account of this plan is dated to 1252, when a Grand Master of the Teutons, represented by Eberhard von Seyne, made {{an agreement with the}} Curonian bishop <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>this</b> fortification. In the same year the Christians constructed the castle and named it Memelburg. The new castle was wooden, protected by a tower, and was in a marshy area. It is likely that this first castle was located on the left bank of the Danė river. It soon became a prime outpost in the war between the Christian Orders and the pagan Lithuanians allied with the Samogitians.|$|E
