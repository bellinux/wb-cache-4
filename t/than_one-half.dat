25|$|However, the JRASC {{article has}} been criticized as lacking any error analysis. Since the {{triangulation}} base used by the astronomers in their calculations was very narrow, even very small errors in determination of directions {{could result in a}} very different triangulated trajectory. Measurement errors of slightly more <b>than</b> <b>one-half</b> degree would make possible a straight-line trajectory towards the Kecksburg area and a much shallower angle of descent than reported in the JRASC article. It was also pointed out that the photos used actually show the fireball trail becoming progressively thinner, suggesting motion away from the cameras, or in the direction of Pennsylvania. Had the trajectory been sideways to the cameras, as contended in the JRASC article, the trail would likely have remained roughly constant in thickness.|$|E

Even comparing international costs of living, the $0.15 that a Honduran worker earned for the long-sleeved T-shirt was equal in purchasing power to $0.50 in the United States.

25|$|The New Brunswick Theological Seminary, {{founded in}} 1784, {{relocated}} from Brooklyn, New York, to New Brunswick in 1810, and shared facilities with Queen's College (and the Queen's College Grammar School, as both were then under the {{oversight of the}} Reformed Church in America. During those formative years, all three institutions were fit into the Old Queens Building, then the only structure on campus. During its early years, the college developed as a classic liberal arts institution, and this development (coupled with both institutions' growing larger and resulting in overcrowding at the site), caused Rutgers College and the New Brunswick Theological Seminary to sever this arrangement. In 1856, the Seminary relocated to a seven-acre (28,000 m²) tract less <b>than</b> <b>one-half</b> mile (800m) away.

40|$|We have {{observed}} {{a connection between}} cell wall synthesis and the initiation of chromosome replication in Bacillus subtilis. Initiation of chromosome replication was prevented in synchronous cultures {{in the presence of}} the cell wall synthesis inhibitor vancomycin. When vancomycin was added to the cultures after initiation of chromosome replication, one round of replication was completed but no reinitiation occurred. Similar results were obtained when cell wall synthesis was inhibited by ristocetin, cycloserine, cloxacillin, or cephaloridine. When sucrose was added to the medium, initiation of deoxyribonucleic acid replication occurred in the presence of vancomycin, to an extent which allowed replication of no more <b>than</b> approximately <b>one-half</b> of the deoxyribonucleic acid of the culture.

25|$|This {{standard}} supports standard memory cycles with {{lengths of}} 1 byte to 4 kilobytes of data, short memory cycles with lengths of 1, 2, or 4 bytes that have much less overhead compared to standard memory cycles, and I/O cycles with lengths of 1, 2, or 4 bytes of data which are low overhead as well. This significantly reduces overhead {{compared to the}} LPC bus, where all cycles except for the 128-byte firmware hub read cycle spends more <b>than</b> <b>one-half</b> {{of all of the}} bus's throughput and time in overhead. The standard memory cycle allows a length of anywhere from 1 byte to 4 kilobytes in order to allow its larger overhead to be amortised over a large transaction. eSPI slaves are allowed to initiate bus master versions of all of the memory cycles. Bus master I/O cycles, which were introduced by the LPC bus specification, and ISA-style DMA including the 32-bit variant introduced by the LPC bus specification, are not present in eSPI. Therefore, bus master memory cycles are the only allowed DMA in this standard.|$|E
