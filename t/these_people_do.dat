25|$|In western Mindanao and the Sulu Archipelago, {{there are}} ethnolinguistic nations who {{practice}} Islam. The Spanish called them Moros after the Moors (despite no resemblance or cultural ties to {{them apart from}} their religion). In the Agusan Marsh and the highlands of Mindanao, there are native ethnic groups collectively known as the Lumad. Unlike the Moros, <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>do</b> not practice Islam, and maintain their animistic beliefs and traditions though {{some of them have}} converted to Christianity as well.|$|E
25|$|The first Skull Session held at St. John Arena was in 1957. Prior to this, Skull Session {{was nothing}} more than a final run through of the music on the morning of the game. Originally, these were closed rehearsals that the band {{eventually}} opened up to friends and family members. Each week, more and more people showed up to hear the band rehearse that the director, Jack Evans, decided to move the rehearsal to St. John Arena across the street. Today, upwards of 14,000 people pack St. John Arena every home game to see the band and football team. Many of <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>do</b> not even have tickets to the game, but yet travel hours just for a chance to see and hear the band.|$|E

2500|$|Working {{the evening}} or night shift, or working at home, makes DSPD {{less of an}} {{obstacle}} for some. Many of <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>do</b> not describe their pattern as a [...] "disorder". Some DSPD individuals nap, even taking 4–5 hours of sleep {{in the morning and}} 4–5 in the evening. DSPD-friendly careers can include security work, the entertainment industry, hospitality work in restaurants, theaters, hotels or bars, call center work, manufacturing, emergency medicine, commercial cleaning, taxi or truck driving, the media, and freelance writing, translation, IT work, or medical transcription. [...] Some other careers that have an emphasis on early morning work hours, such as bakers, coffee baristas, pilots and flight crews, teachers, mail carriers, waste collection, and farming, can be particularly difficult for people who naturally sleep later than is typical. [...] Some careers, such as over-the-road truck drivers, firefighters, law enforcement, nursing, can be suitable for both people with delayed sleep phase syndrome and people with the opposite condition, advanced sleep phase disorder, as these workers are needed both very {{early in the morning and}} also late at night.|$|E

60|$|Riding, {{on empty}} stomachs, for another sixty miles over the plains, {{we came to}} a Boer's house where we had to sleep.

It appears that <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>do</b> not care about bring buried in consecrated ground, their only anxiety being to be put in a coffin, and they are {{generally}} laid to rest near to their doors. There is neither railing nor headstone, and no trees or flowers, those green emblematic garments with which civilised people try to hide the ugliness of death. I remember once seeing several graves within two or three yards of the public road, so that in a year or so the waggons will be rumbling over the heads of those who lie beneath.|$|E
60|$|And it is supremely so in {{the case}} of religion. As long as you have a creed, which every one in a certain group {{believes}} or is supposed to believe, then that group will consist of the old recurring figures of religious history, who can be appealed to by the creed and judged by it; the saint, the hypocrite, the brawler, the weak brother. <b>These</b> <b>people</b> <b>do</b> each other good; or they all join together to do the hypocrite good, with heavy and repeated blows. But once break the bond of doctrine which alone holds these people together and each will gravitate to his own kind outside the group. The hypocrites will all get together and call each other saints; the saints will get lost in a desert and call themselves weak brethren; the weak brethren will get weaker and weaker in a general atmosphere of imbecility; and the brawler will go off looking for somebody else with whom to brawl.|$|E
25|$|Archeological {{evidence}} suggests that people along the southern shores of Lake Onega and around Lake Ladoga reached the River Utsjoki in Northern Finnish Lapland before 8100 BC.

They travel from place to place, visiting literary assemblages, geographical societies, and seats of learning, and springing sudden bets that <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>do</b> not know these things. Since all people think they know them, they are an easy prey to these adventurers. Or rather they were an easy prey until the law interfered, three months ago, and a New York court decided that this kind of gambling is illegal, [...] "because it traverses Article IV, Section 9, of the Constitution of the United States, which forbids betting on a sure thing." [...] This decision was rendered by the full Bench of the New York Supreme Court, after a test sprung upon the court by counsel for the prosecution, which showed that none of the nine Judges was able to answer any of the four questions.|$|E
60|$|But {{the thing}} that still irritates me most against {{the hero of the}} popular novel is the ease with which he learns a modern foreign language. Were he a German waiter, a Swiss barber, or a Polish photographer, I would not envy him; <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>do</b> not have to learn a language. My idea is that they boil down a dictionary, and take two table-spoonsful each night before going to bed. By the time the bottle is {{finished}} they have the language well into their system. But he is not. He is just an ordinary Anglo-Saxon, and I don't believe in him. I walk about for years with dictionaries in my pocket. Weird-looking ladies and gentlemen gesticulate and rave at me for months. I hide myself in lonely places, repeating idioms to myself out loud, in the hope that by this means they will come readily to me if ever I want them, which I never do. And, after all this, I don't seem to know very much. This irritating ass, who has never left his native suburb, suddenly makes up his mind to travel on the Continent. I find him in the next chapter engaged in complicated psychological argument with French or German savants. It appears--the author had forgotten to mention it before--that one summer a French, or German, or Italian refugee, as the case may happen to be, came to live in the hero's street: thus it is that the hero is able to talk fluently in the native language of that unhappy refugee.|$|E
