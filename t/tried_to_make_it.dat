5|$|With 42 seconds remaining, the Jets {{still had}} a chance to score; however, on the kickoff, New York return man Earl Christy fumbled the ball at the Jets' 12-yard line when he was tackled by Raiders linebacker Bill Budness. Oakland reserve running back Preston Ridlehuber picked up the fumbled ball and ran into the end zone, which with another Blanda extra point gave the Raiders a 43–32 lead, deflating any hopes of the Jets coming back to win the contest. Ridlehuber could not {{remember}} whether AFL rules permitted advancing a fumbled kickoff return (they did), so <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> appear he was entering the end zone with the same motion he gathered in the ball. Oakland kicked off to New York again, but it could do little with the ball in the final seconds, and the game ended.|$|E
25|$|In 1898, the United States {{intervened in}} the Cuban insurrection and {{launched}} the Spanish–American War to force Spain out. According {{to the terms}} of the Treaty of Paris, Spain relinquished sovereignty over Cuba and ceded the Philippine Islands, Puerto Rico, and Guam to the United States. The terms of cession for the Philippines involved a payment of the sum of $20 million by the United States to Spain. The treaty was highly contentious and denounced by William Jennings Bryan, who <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> a central issue in the 1900 election. He was defeated in landslide by McKinley.|$|E
25|$|The {{situation}} turned {{worse for}} Ming Rui. By early 1768, battle-hardened Burmese reinforcements from Siam {{had begun to}} arrive back. Bolstered by the reinforcements, two Burmese armies led by Maha Thiha Thura and Ne Myo Sithu succeeded in retaking Hsenwi. The Qing commander at Hsenwi committed suicide. The main Qing army was now cut off from all supplies. It was now March 1768. Thousands of Bannermen from the freezing grasslands along the Russian border, began dying of malaria as well as Burmese attacks in the furnace-like hot weather of central Burma. Ming Rui gave up all hope of proceeding toward Ava, and instead <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> back to Yunnan with as many of his soldiers as possible.|$|E

He later sold their {{publishing}} rights to William McBurney for £4,000. In 1977 they produced Aliens, {{about the experience}} of the Irish in nineteenth-century America, which included very little folk music. They toured Britain, Germany, Canada and the United States. The night they played the Albert Hall in London was described by one critic as the loudest gig there since Hendrix. The Man Who Built America (1978), produced by Steve Katz of Blood, Sweat and Tears and Blues Project fame, concerned Irish emigration to the USA and was commercially their most successful album. The heavier sound did bring some acceptance in America but they lost their folk base and their freshness. Short Stories, Tall Tales (1979) was their last studio album and was panned by the record company and critics alike.|$|E

[...] "Even so, I tried to keep a soft touch style-wise out of respect for the film's subject," [...] said Madsen.

500|$|For the {{fighting}} game Dissidia Final Fantasy, Morita returned to voice Tidus. He {{was concerned about}} being able to perform the character's lines like the original Final Fantasy series, since it had been nearly a decade since he voiced Tidus. By that time, he was also more accustomed to acting as Ichigo and Keiji Maeda from Capcom's Sengoku Basara hack-and-slash games and the characters had a different vocal tone than Tidus'. When Moriata returned to voice Tidus, he <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> match his original performance. When the game director complimented Morita for keeping the character's tone, Morita was relieved and joked that he felt younger.|$|E

500|$|For Khan and his followers, Fletcher {{created a}} strong {{contrast}} with the highly organized Starfleet uniforms; his idea was that the exiles' costumes were made out of whatever they could find. Fletcher said, [...] "My intention with Khan was to express {{the fact that they}} had been marooned on that planet with no technical infrastructure, so they had to cannibalize from the spaceship whatever they used or wore. Therefore, I <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> look as if they had dressed themselves out of pieces of upholstery and electrical equipment that composed the ship." [...] Khan's costume was designed with an open chest to show Ricardo Montalbán's physique. Fletcher also designed smocks for the Regula I scientists, and civilian clothes for Kirk and McCoy that were designed to look practical and comfortable.|$|E
500|$|The cliffhanger {{resolves}} several plot threads {{that had}} been seeded throughout the previous episodes of the series. According to executive producer Beth Willis, the Amy Pond Ganger has been acting {{in place of the}} original Amy Pond {{since the beginning of the}} series. [...] Amy claimed she was pregnant in [...] "The Impossible Astronaut", but denied this in the following episode. Since then, the Doctor has performed several inconclusive pregnancy tests on Amy. The Eye Patch Lady, who was later revealed to be named Madame Kovarian in the episode [...] "A Good Man Goes To War", previously made brief appearances in [...] "Day of the Moon", [...] "The Curse of the Black Spot", and [...] "The Rebel Flesh". Gillan discussed the labour scene with her mother, and <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> [...] "really horrific".|$|E
500|$|Moffat's plan [...] "from the outset", to tie {{the episode}} into the {{overarching}} story arc of the series, was that Rory not just die but be erased from history in {{the crack in the}} universe. Moffat would later bring Rory back in [...] "The Pandorica Opens", though the episode reveals his consciousness was placed in a Roman centurion Auton as part of a trap for the Doctor to save the universe from the cracks. Moffat also thought it was appropriate as the trio had had fun, and now {{it was time for a}} casualty. Rory's death is also connected with Chibnall's theme of making mistakes; it was the Doctor's fault as he stopped to look at the crack. Gillan called the scene [...] "incredibly challenging" [...] for her to perform and <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> [...] "truthful and believable".|$|E

500|$|Producer Max Rosenberg, {{best known}} for his horror and supernatural films, {{provided}} the financing for The Incredible Melting Man. Samuel W. Gelfman was the film's producer, and American International Pictures served as both the production company and the distributor. According to Sachs, Gelfman and Rosenberg decided during shooting that a straight horror film would be more financially successful than a parody, so many of the comedic scenes were edited out and new horror scenes were shot and added to the film. Sachs said he felt the film was taken away from him, and that it suffered as a result because the producers <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> both a comedy and horror film, thus failing at both. Sachs said of the decision, [...] "How can a serious horror movie end with the monster being shoveled into a garbage can?" ...|$|E
500|$|... "Deuces" [...] {{was written}} by Chris Brown, Michael [...] "Tyga" [...] Stevenson and Kevin McCall, who also {{produced}} the track.

The recordings were later mixed by Brian Springer at The Record Plant in Los Angeles, California, with assistance by Anthony Taglianett. [...] "Deuces" [...] leaked online on May 20, 2010, and was later released digitally on June 25, 2010 as the first single from Brown's collaborative mixtape with Tyga, Fan of a Fan (2010). In an interview with MTV News, Tyga elaborated on [...] "Deuces" [...] and its theme, stating: [...] "Basically it's about you getting rid of this girl, you <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> work, {{but you got to}} move on.

500|$|Daniels {{had said}} that he was {{attracted}} to the initial novel based on how [...] "raw and honest" [...] it felt. In an interview with AMC he noted that reading the book brought back a memory from his childhood of a young abused girl who knocked on his family's door, claiming that her mom was going to kill her. Daniels recalls that the incident {{was the first time he}} saw his mother frightened, specifically noting the helplessness of the situation, and stating [...] "she knew that she’d have to send this little girl home, and that was what disturbed her— that she couldn’t save her. She <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> easier for her. That’s all she could do." [...] In creating the movie Daniels hoped that the experience would be cathartic and that [...] "maybe I could heal. And maybe I could heal other people, too." [...] Another stated goal Daniels had was to challenge the general public's perception of incest.|$|E

500|$|According to Hoshino, the series' main theme {{focuses on}} tragedy. Many {{characters}} such as Allen across the series suffer poor fates such as losing {{a loved one}} and being tempted to revive them by the Earl. Although this works, the people are revived as Akumas who consume the skin of their loved ones. This has led to state that an initial theme is that people should not be brought back to life. Although some characters like Kanda express unconditional love to Alma, their happiness is short-lived due to Alma dying shortly after this with another writer finding fitting for the series' dark narrative. Additionally, Allen's life becomes sadder across the series as he is forced to abandon the Black Order due to the Pope removing his rights as an exorcist and he is treated as Noah due to his connections with these characters. Nevertheless, Hoshino still <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> fun for the readers, stating that Allen will always have allies.|$|E
500|$|To help {{differentiate}} the Bennet sisters, Durran viewed Elizabeth as the [...] "tomboy", clothing her in earthy colours {{because of her}} love of the countryside. For the other sisters, Durran remarked, [...] "Jane was the most refined and yet it's still all a bit slapdash and homemade, because the Bennets have no money. One of the main things Joe wanted was for the whole thing to have a provincial feel. Mary is the bluestocking: serious and practical. And then Lydia and Kitty are a bit Tweedledum and Tweedledee {{in a kind of}} teenage way. I <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> so that they'd be sort of mirror images. If one's wearing a green dress, the other will wear a green jacket; so you always have a visual asymmetry between the two." [...] In contrast to the 1940 film, the 2005 production displayed the Bennet sisters in worn-down but comfortable dresses that allowed the actors better moveability.|$|E
500|$|It {{was always}} the same sort of system with us. We would write the nucleus of the song, the melody primary music, and then some of the words were there as we {{finished}} writing it. I started playing some rock 'n' roll piano and started boogie woogie-ing my left hand, and that inspired Mariah {{to come up with the}} melodic [...] 'I don't want a lot for Christmas.' And then we started singing and playing around with this rock 'n' roll boogie song, which immediately came out to be the nucleus of what would end up being 'All I Want For Christmas Is You.' That one went very quickly: It was an easier song to write than some of the other ones. It was very formulaic, not a lot of chord changes. I <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> a little more unique, putting in some special chords that you really don't hear a lot of, which made it unique and special.|$|E
