Within hours, the only <b>thing</b> <b>left</b> was the stone church and some walls. While Frederick developed his plan to outflank Saltykov by maneuvering behind him, Saltykov outfoxed him.|$|E

[...] Even by 1920, however, it was becoming apparent that the policy was not working (or, as the Medicine Hat News noted, [...] "Prohibition is now working smoothly. [...] The only <b>thing</b> <b>left</b> is to stop the sale of liquor!"). [...] Greenfield's own MLAs began to grumble about the policy—Archibald Matheson expressed in 1923 the view that [...] "This government has acted as philosopher, guide, and God to the people long enough." [...] Public opinion, too, began to shift against the policy, more rapidly after 1922 when three police officers {{were killed in the}} line of duty by bootleggers. [...] The last and most dramatic of these was the murder of Steve Lawson in front of the barracks where he and his family lived, by Emil [...] "Pic" [...] Picariello and Florence Lassandra. [...] Public opinion ran high both for and against the pair, and their 1923 hangings only served to unite both factions against prohibition.|$|E

2500|$|The {{second major}} tornado {{produced}} by the Franklin supercell was initially observed {{to the east of}} Liberal (5:31 pm). [...] Analysis indicated a [...] wide damage path through rural portions of Barton County, Missouri. [...] Several structures received F1 to F2 damage.

[...] As it approached the town of Stockton, several framed houses were swept off of their foundations. [...] Structural analysis indicated poor anchoring of the homes, thus warranting a high-end F3 rating. [...] The funnel then proceeded to travel through the center of Stockton, causing considerable devastation and killing three. [...] The tornado was approximately [...] in diameter as it left Stockton. [...] A two-story framed home to the east of Stockton was almost entirely destroyed and several vehicles were tossed hundreds of feet (also high-end F3). [...] Almost all the buildings in the downtown square of Stockton were destroyed and the only <b>thing</b> <b>left</b> at one bank was the vault. [...] Most of the roof was torn off of the Stockton school but the court house, just [...] south of the square, sustained only minor damage. [...] The city was closed off to the public for nearly two days. [...] The tornado then crossed into northern Polk County and appeared to weaken slightly. [...] A handful of structures received F1 and F2 damage. [...] Continuing all the way through Polk County, it shrank to approximately [...] in diameter as it entered Dallas County. [...] Damage analysis indicated twin funnels in western Polk (another tornado touched down just to the south of the parent funnel) (Observers did confirm twin tornadoes on the ground near Humansville, Missouri in northwest Polk County). [...] Over 48 homes were destroyed in northern Dallas county (again F3 damage) and two additional fatalities occurred. South of Tunas, the track shifted from northeasterly to almost east-southeasterly. [...] It then proceeded to abruptly weaken and dissipate.
