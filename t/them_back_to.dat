5|$|Against long-circulating speculations {{that his}} family has French roots, genealogists proved the German origin of Rockefeller and traced <b>them</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the early 17th century. Thereupon Johann Peter Rockenfeller (baptized 27 September 1682 in the Protestant church of Rengsdorf) immigrated in 1723 from Altwied (today a {{district}} of Neuwied, Rhineland-Palatinate) with three children to North America and settled down in Germantown, Pennsylvania.|$|E

5|$|Although McCartney {{had hoped}} {{technology}} {{would allow the}} virtual band members to appear in hyper-realistic detail, Harmonix opted to start with more exaggerated, cartoon-like designs, gradually scaling <b>them</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> appear more realistic. Animation for the Beatles characters was aided by motion capture provided by Beatles tribute bands. Dhani Harrison also assisted with modeling for character animation in the game.|$|E
5|$|Endecott's warrant was {{followed}} by an order issued by King Charles in March and received by Endecott in May 1661 containing a direct order to apprehend the two fugitives and ship <b>them</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> England. Endecott dutifully obeyed, but he appointed two recently arrived Royalists to track them down. Somewhat predictably, their search came up empty, and Whalley and Goffe thus escaped. Biographer Lawrence Mayo suggests Endecott would have appointed different men for the search had he been serious about catching them.|$|E

5|$|In November 1853, Sir George Grey {{ended his}} first term as Governor of New Zealand and sailed to the islands around New Caledonia, to indulge his {{interest}} in languages.

He gave some of his works to Grey, who took <b>them</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> England in December 1853 and donated them to the British Museum.|$|E
5|$|Some larvae, {{especially}} those of the Lycaenidae, form mutual associations with ants. They communicate with the ants using vibrations that are transmitted through the substrate as well as using chemical signals. The ants provide some degree of protection to these larvae and they in turn gather honeydew secretions. Large blue (Phengaris arion) caterpillars trick Myrmica ants into taking <b>them</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the ant colony where they feed on the ant eggs and larvae in a parasitic relationship.|$|E
5|$|The Commercial Crew Development (CCDev) {{program was}} {{initiated}} in 2010 {{with the purpose}} of creating American commercially operated crewed spacecraft capable of delivering at least four crew members to the ISS, staying docked for 180 days and then returning <b>them</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Earth. It is hoped that these vehicles could also transport non-NASA customers to private space stations such those planned by Bigelow Aerospace. Like COTS, CCDev is also a fixed price milestone-based developmental program that requires some private investment.|$|E

5000|$|In [...] "Thanksgiving", Lydia has {{him take}} her back eight weeks into the past to see Joseph Sullivan's death.

The 532nd EBSR lost one man killed and 12 wounded.|$|E

The boy returns {{to each of the}} worlds to collect Ruffleberg's companions, taking <b>them</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the real world. In doing so, Evermore's {{destruction}} is averted and it continues to exist without them. After the credits roll, a final scene shows Professor Ruffleberg returning Carltron to his old task of cleaning the lab. Carltron grins and rubs his hands together, implying that he is not as docile as the professor believes.|$|E
5|$|After Juventus won the Serie B {{title in}} the 2006–07 season, {{promoting}} <b>them</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Serie A, Buffon signed a contract extension with Juventus until 2012. Buffon was elected as the goalkeeper for the 2007 FIFPro XI {{for the second consecutive}} year, and the IFFHS World's Best Goalkeeper for a record-breaking fourth time.

5|$|After an oil {{drilling}} operation in 1903 in Dexter, Kansas, produced a gas geyser {{that would not}} burn, Kansas state geologist Erasmus Haworth collected samples of the escaping gas and took <b>them</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the University of Kansas at Lawrence where, {{with the help of}} chemists Hamilton Cady and David McFarland, he discovered that the gas consisted of, by volume, 72% nitrogen, 15% methane (a combustible percentage only with sufficient oxygen), 1% hydrogen, and 12% an unidentifiable gas. With further analysis, Cady and McFarland discovered that 1.84% of the gas sample was helium. This showed that despite its overall rarity on Earth, helium was concentrated in large quantities under the American Great Plains, available for extraction as a byproduct of natural gas.|$|E
5|$|After {{their initial}} {{founding}} with one milk supplier, Beecher's production system {{has had to}} expand several times to include more suppliers. As of 2006, Beecher's {{was in the process}} of purchasing their own farms in Eastern Washington for additional milk production, which will also give them full control over their entire product's creation. The principal milk supplier is Green Acres Farm in Duvall, Washington, using only hormone-free and antibiotic-free milk. When consistent milk production first became a problem, Beecher's purchased a herd of 200 cows. The entire dairy herd at Green Acres Farm is owned by Beecher's, who leases <b>them</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the farm. For the New York production, all Holstein and Jersey milk come directly from Dutch Hollow Farms in upstate New York.|$|E
5|$|D'Ávila {{had plans}} to {{establish}} a settlement in Montejo's name near Puerto de Caballos, but knew it fell within the jurisdiction of Honduras, and that Cerezeda would never support such a move. In any case, the situation in Trujillo was too precarious for Cerezeda to support a major expedition. D'Ávila became embroiled in the factional politics of the town, taking the part of Diego Díaz de Herrera. After a time, he decided to leave Honduras, and took passage {{with the majority of}} his men on a ship that stopped at Trujillo, which took <b>them</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Yucatán. A few of D'Ávila's men stayed and settled in Trujillo, where the situation continued to deteriorate.|$|E
