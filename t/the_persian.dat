Sailing {{into the mouth of}} the river, Cimon quickly routed <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> fleet {{gathered}} there. Most of <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> fleet made land-fall, and the sailors fled to the shelter of <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> army. Cimon then landed the Greek marines and proceeded to attack <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> army, which was also routed. The Greeks captured <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> camp, taking many prisoners, and were able to destroy 200 beached Persian triremes. This stunning double victory seems to have greatly demoralised the Persians, and prevented any further Persian campaigning in the Aegean until at least 451 BC. However, the Delian League do not appear to have pressed home their advantage, probably because of other events in the Greek world that required their attention.|$|E
5|$|From the 6th to 3rd century BC, Bahrain {{was part}} of <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> Empire ruled by the Achaemenian dynasty. By about 250 BC, Parthia brought <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> Gulf under its control and {{extended}} its influence as far as Oman. The Parthians established garrisons along the southern coast of <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> Gulf to control trade routes.|$|E
5|$|Although heavily outnumbered, the Greek Allies were {{persuaded by}} the Athenian general Themistocles to bring <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> fleet to battle again, {{in the hope}} that a victory would prevent naval {{operations}} against the Peloponnese. <b>The</b> <b>Persian</b> king Xerxes was also eager for a decisive battle. As a result of subterfuge on the part of Themistocles, <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> navy rowed into the Straits of Salamis and tried to block both entrances. In the cramped conditions of the Straits, the great Persian numbers were an active hindrance, as ships struggled to maneuver and became disorganized. Seizing the opportunity, the Greek fleet formed in line and scored a decisive victory.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Persians</b> {{finally arrived}} off the {{southern}} tip of Euboea, at Karystos. The citizens of Karystos refused to give hostages to <b>the</b> <b>Persians,</b> so they were besieged, and their land ravaged, until they submitted to <b>the</b> <b>Persians.</b>|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Persians</b> landed their army {{at three}} {{separate}} locations, disembarked, and made straight for Eretria. <b>The</b> <b>Persians</b> then began besieging the city. Rather than passively besieging <b>the</b> city, <b>the</b> <b>Persians</b> {{seem to have}} vigorously attacked the walls. Herodotus reports that the fighting was fierce and both sides suffered heavy losses. However, after six days of fighting, two eminent Eretrians, Euphorbus and Philagrus, opened the gates for <b>the</b> <b>Persians.</b> Once inside <b>the</b> city, <b>the</b> <b>Persians</b> plundered <b>the</b> city, burning the temples and sanctuaries in revenge for the burning of Sardis. Those citizens who were captured were enslaved, as Darius had ordered.|$|R
500|$|Herodotus {{described}} {{the relationship between}} the Qedarites and <b>the</b> <b>Persians</b> as follows: [...] "they did not yield the obedience of slaves to <b>the</b> <b>Persians,</b> but were united to them by friendship for having given Cambyses passage into Egypt, which <b>the</b> <b>Persians</b> could not enter without the consent of the Arabs." ...|$|R
5|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> forces put up stout resistance, {{the heavily}} {{armoured}} Greek hoplites again proved themselves superior in combat, and eventually routed <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> troops, who fled to their camp. The Ionian Greek contingents in <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> army defected, and {{the camp was}} assailed {{and a large number}} of Persians slaughtered. <b>The</b> <b>Persian</b> ships were then captured and burned. The complete destruction of <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> navy, along with the destruction of Mardonius's army at Plataea (allegedly on the same day as the Battle of Mycale), decisively ended the invasion of Greece. After Plataea and Mycale, the allied Greeks would take the offensive against the Persians, marking a new phase of the Greco-Persian Wars. Although Mycale was in every sense a decisive victory, {{it does not seem to}} have been attributed the same significance (even at the time) as, for example the Athenian victory at the Battle of Marathon or even the Greek defeat at Thermopylae.|$|E
5|$|Around {{ten days}} later, <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> army arrived at Thermopylae, and the Allies at Chalcis were {{informed}} by a ship, captained by Abronichus, {{which had been}} appointed to liaise between {{the army and the}} fleet. However, there was still no sign of <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> fleet, and the first day the Persians spent at Thermopylae passed without them launching an attack. The next day, <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> fleet finally drew near to Artemisium, heading for the Gap of Skiathos (between the coast of Magnesia and Skiathos), when a summer gale (a 'Hellesponter' - probably a north-easterly storm) broke, driving <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> fleet onto the mountainous coast. The storm lasted two days, wrecking approximately one third of <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> ships. Meanwhile, at Thermopylae, the Persians had continued to wait for the Greeks to disperse, also choosing not to attack during the storm.|$|E

50|$|Rhahzadh {{deployed}} {{his forces}} into three masses and attacked.

5|$|The {{task force}} sailed on to Euboea, {{and to the}} first major target, Eretria. The Eretrians {{made no attempt to}} stop <b>the</b> <b>Persians</b> from landing or {{advancing}} and thus allowed themselves to be besieged.

5000|$|Aeaces, {{the son of}} Syloson, and the {{grandson}} of the above Aeaces. He was tyrant of Samos, but was deprived of his tyranny by Aristagoras, when the Ionians revolted from <b>the</b> <b>Persians</b> in 500 BC.

5|$|During the night, another storm broke (this time {{probably}} a thunder-storm, possibly with a south easterly wind), preventing the Allies from setting off southwards to counter <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> detachment sent {{around the outside}} of Euboea. However, the storm also hit <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> detachment of ships, driving them off course and onto the rocky coast of 'the Hollows' of Euboea.

5|$|Following Thermopylae, <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> army {{proceeded}} to sack and burn Plataea and Thespiae, the Boeotian cities {{that had not}} submitted, before it marched on the now evacuated city of Athens. Meanwhile, the Greeks (for the most part Peloponnesians) preparing to defend the Isthmus of Corinth, demolished the single road that led through it and built a wall across it. As at Thermopylae, making this an effective strategy required the Greek navy to stage a simultaneous blockade, barring the passage of <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> navy across the Saronic Gulf, so that troops could not be landed directly on the Peloponnese. However, instead of a mere blockade, Themistocles persuaded the Greeks to seek a decisive victory against <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> fleet. Luring <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> navy into the Straits of Salamis, the Greek fleet was able to destroy much of <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> fleet in the Battle of Salamis, which essentially ended {{the threat to the}} Peloponnese.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Persians</b> had <b>the</b> sympathy {{of several}} Greek city-states, {{including}} Argos, which had pledged to defect when <b>the</b> <b>Persians</b> reached their borders.

5000|$|The ethnonym [...] "Mede" [...] {{was often}} {{used by the}} Greeks of <b>the</b> <b>Persians</b> although, {{strictly}} speaking, the Medes were a different Iranian people, subject to <b>the</b> <b>Persians.</b> It {{was not until the}} 470s that the Greeks began to refer to [...] "Persians", with Aeschylus' play <b>The</b> <b>Persians</b> in 472 being an early example of this.|$|R
50|$|In 487 BC, <b>the</b> <b>Persians</b> {{returned}} under Darius's son Xerxes. When a small Greek force {{holding the}} pass of Thermopylae was defeated, the Athenians evacuated Athens, {{the city that}} was taken by <b>the</b> <b>Persians.</b> Athens got captured and sacked twice by <b>the</b> <b>Persians</b> within one year after Thermopylae. Subsequently, the Athenians (led by Themistocles), with their allies, engaged <b>the</b> much larger <b>Persian</b> navy at sea in the Battle of Salamis. Xerxes built a throne on the coast in order to watch the Greek navy being defeated, but instead, <b>the</b> <b>Persians</b> were routed. This established a great {{turning point in the}} war.|$|R
5|$|From Babylon, Alexander went to Susa, {{one of the}} Achaemenid capitals, and {{captured}} its treasury. He sent {{the bulk of his}} army to <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> ceremonial capital of Persepolis via <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> Royal Road. Alexander himself took selected troops on the direct route to the city. He then stormed the pass of <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> Gates (in the modern Zagros Mountains) which had been blocked by a Persian army under Ariobarzanes and then hurried to Persepolis before its garrison could loot the treasury.|$|E
5|$|Herodotus gives a {{detailed}} description of <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> fleet that assembled at Doriskos in spring 480 BC (see table). However, after the fleet was struck the storm off the coast of Magnesia, approximately one third of the fleet was lost. Thus, by Herodotus's reckoning, <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> fleet would have had approximately 800 triremes at Artemisium.|$|E
5|$|In 1738 the two forts were {{surrendered}} to <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> forces.|$|E
25|$|For {{the pursuit}} of <b>the</b> <b>Persians,</b> Kotlyarevsky sent 400 Jaegers and 300 Cossacks {{under the command of}} Lieutenant Colonel Ushakov, who {{subsequently}} followed <b>the</b> <b>Persians</b> for 15 miles.|$|R
5|$|The {{task force}} then sailed around Euboea {{to the first}} major target, Eretria. According to Herodotus, the Eretrians were divided amongst {{themselves}} as to {{the best course of}} action; whether to flee to the highlands, or undergo a siege, or to submit to <b>the</b> <b>Persians.</b> In <b>the</b> event, the majority decision was to remain in the city. The Eretrians made no attempt to stop <b>the</b> <b>Persians</b> landing, or advancing, and thus allowed themselves to be besieged. For six days <b>the</b> <b>Persians</b> attacked <b>the</b> walls, with losses on both sides; however, on the seventh day two reputable Eretrians opened the gates and betrayed the city to <b>the</b> <b>Persians.</b> <b>The</b> city was razed, and temples and shrines were looted and burned.

5|$|After {{staying at}} Eretria {{for a few}} days, <b>the</b> <b>Persians</b> made {{their way down the}} coast towards Attica. <b>The</b> <b>Persians</b> dropped <b>the</b> {{captured}} Eretrians off on the island of Aegilia, before landing at the bay of Marathon in Attica. The Persians' next target was Athens. However, the Athenians had marched out from Athens to meet <b>the</b> <b>Persians,</b> and blocked <b>the</b> exits from the plains of Marathon. After several days of stalemate, the Athenians finally resolved to attack <b>the</b> <b>Persians,</b> winning a famous victory at the ensuing Battle of Marathon. After the battle, <b>the</b> remaining <b>Persians</b> fled to their ships, picked up the Eretrians from Aegilia, and then sailed back to Asia Minor, thereby ending the campaign, and <b>the</b> first <b>Persian</b> invasion of Greece.|$|R
5|$|In response, the Athenian navy under Xanthippus {{joined with}} the Allied fleet off Delos. They were then {{approached}} by a delegation from Samos, who suggested that the Ionian cities would revolt if the Allied fleet successfully engaged <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> fleet. They furthermore pointed out the poor morale and reduced seaworthiness of <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> fleet. Leotychides decided to attempt this, and sailed for Samos.|$|E
5|$|In {{the days}} before the battle, Philippicus, newly {{assigned}} to <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> front, moved to intercept an anticipated Persian invasion. He chose to deploy his army at Solachon, controlling the various routes of the Mesopotamian plain, and especially access to the main local watering source, the Arzamon river. Kardarigan, confident of victory, advanced against the Byzantines, but they had been warned and were deployed in battle order when Kardarigan reached Solachon. The Persians deployed as well and attacked, gaining the upper hand in the centre, but the Byzantine right wing broke through <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> left flank. The successful Byzantine wing was thrown into disarray as its men headed off to loot <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> camp, but Philippicus was able to restore order. Then, while the Byzantine centre was forced to form a shield wall to withstand <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> pressure, the Byzantine left flank also managed to turn the Persians' right. Under threat of a double envelopment, <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> army collapsed and fled, with many dying in the desert of thirst or from water poisoning. Kardarigan himself survived and, with a part of his army, held out against Byzantine attacks on a hillock for several days before the Byzantines withdrew.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Allies (for {{the most}} part Peloponnesian) {{prepared}} to defend the Isthmus of Corinth, demolishing the single road that led through it, and building a wall across it.

50|$|Much {{of this is}} {{uncertain}} and the sources sometimes contradict. The five groups were political or ethnic groups centered in Bactria and Afghanistan.

5|$|Perhaps {{driven by}} the will to take revenge for the {{destruction}} of Palmyrene trade centers and discourage Shapur from initiating future attacks, Odaenathus launched an invasion against the Persians. In the spring of 262, the king marched north into the occupied Roman province of Mesopotamia, driving out <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> garrisons and freeing Edessa and Carrhae. The first onslaught was aimed at Nisibis, which Odaenathus regained but sacked since the inhabitants were sympathetic toward <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> occupation. The Palmyrene monarch destroyed the Jewish city of Nehardea, 45km west of <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> capital Ctesiphon, as he deemed the Jews of Mesopotamia loyal to Shapur. By late 262 or early 263, Odaenathus stood at the walls of <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> capital.|$|E
50|$|Cyrus {{advanced}} {{to halt the}} Lydian invasion. The winter battle {{appears to have been}} fierce, but indecisive. Croesus withdrew across the Halys. As Herodotus refers to how the Lydians fell short in defeating <b>the</b> <b>Persians,</b> it seems clear that partly because of the battle, and having fewer troops than <b>the</b> <b>Persians,</b> it was enough for Croesus to retreat. <b>The</b> <b>Persians</b> reclaimed <b>the</b> land of the Medes in their name. In this respect, the battle might be regarded as a strategic victory for <b>the</b> <b>Persians,</b> in that it helped to secure Cappadocia as part of the newly formed Achaemenid Empire.|$|R
5|$|The second {{theory is}} simply that the battle {{occurred}} because <b>the</b> <b>Persians</b> finally moved to attack the Athenians. Although this theory has <b>the</b> <b>Persians</b> moving to <b>the</b> strategic offensive, this can be reconciled with the traditional account of the Athenians attacking <b>the</b> <b>Persians</b> by assuming that, seeing <b>the</b> <b>Persians</b> advancing, <b>the</b> Athenians took the tactical offensive, and attacked them. Obviously, it cannot be firmly established which theory (if either) is correct. However, both theories imply {{that there was some}} kind of Persian activity which occurred on or about the fifth day which ultimately triggered the battle. It is also possible that both theories are correct: when <b>the</b> <b>Persians</b> sent <b>the</b> cavalry by ship to attack Athens, they simultaneously sent their infantry to attack at Marathon, triggering the Greek counterattack.|$|R
