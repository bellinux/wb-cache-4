40|$|AbstractThe {{tripartite}} motif (<b>TRIM)</b> protein, <b>TRIM</b> 5 α, restricts some retroviruses, including {{human immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV- 1), from infecting the cells of particular species. <b>TRIM</b> proteins contain RING, B-box, coiled-coil and, in some cases, B 30. 2 (SPRY) domains. We investigated the properties of human <b>TRIM</b> family members closely related to <b>TRIM</b> 5. These <b>TRIM</b> proteins, like <b>TRIM</b> 5 α, assembled into homotrimers and co-localized in the cytoplasm with <b>TRIM</b> 5 α. <b>TRIM</b> 5 α turned over more rapidly than related <b>TRIM</b> proteins. <b>TRIM</b> 5 α, <b>TRIM</b> 34 and <b>TRIM</b> 6 associated with HIV- 1 capsid–nucleocapsid complexes assembled in vitro; the <b>TRIM</b> 5 α and <b>TRIM</b> 34 interactions with these complexes were dependent on their B 30. 2 (SPRY) domains. Only <b>TRIM</b> 5 α potently restricted infection by the retroviruses studied; overexpression of <b>TRIM</b> 34 resulted in modest inhibition of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVmac) infection.

40|$|<b>TRIM</b> protein {{family is}} an {{evolutionarily}} conserved gene family implicated {{in a number}} of critical processes including inflammation, immunity, antiviral and cancer. In an effort to profile the expression patterns of <b>TRIM</b> superfamily in several non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines, we found that the expression of 10 <b>TRIM</b> genes including <b>TRIM</b> 3, <b>TRIM</b> 7, <b>TRIM</b> 14, <b>TRIM</b> 16, <b>TRIM</b> 21, <b>TRIM</b> 22, <b>TRIM</b> 29, <b>TRIM</b> 59, <b>TRIM</b> 66 and <b>TRIM</b> 70 was significantly upregulated in NSCLC cell lines compared with the normal human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cell line, whereas the expression of 7 other <b>TRIM</b> genes including <b>TRIM</b> 4, <b>TRIM</b> 9, <b>TRIM</b> 36, <b>TRIM</b> 46, <b>TRIM</b> 54, <b>TRIM</b> 67 and <b>TRIM</b> 76 was significantly down-regulated in NSCLC cell lines compared with that in HBE cells.
