40|$|The Netherlands Institute for Fisheries Research {{has been}} {{commissioned}} by the Dutch Fisheries Product Board {{to carry out a}} study on the effects of <b>twin</b> <b>trawl</b> fishery on the sustainable exploitation of demersal fish stocks. The <b>twin</b> <b>trawl</b> fishery appears to grow quickly, but there are many uncertainties about {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} this fishery on fish stocks. Advantages due to the light type of gear are the low use of fuel, the high quality of landings and the relatively low disturbance of the seabed. Negative effects mentioned are the large surface that is fished, which would result in high catches and large numbers of discards. Moreover, under certain conditions, twin trawlers are allowed to use smaller mesh sizes than beam trawlers, which may result in more discards of undersized fish. This study aims at making an objective and quantitative description of the <b>twin</b> <b>trawl</b> fishery in the Netherlands and consists of three parts: 1) a description of technical and fishery biological aspects; 2) a study on discards (part of the catch returned to the sea) and; 3) an integrated description of the <b>twin</b> <b>trawl</b> fishery and a comparison with the beam trawl fishery. The present report describes the second part: discarding in the <b>twin</b> <b>trawl</b> fishery.

40|$|Face-to-face {{interviews}} were conducted to identify the main changes in gear and vessel technology that may have improved the fishing efficiency {{of a number of}} French, Danish, and Basque fleets over the past few decades. Important changes include the gradual appearance of <b>twin</b> <b>trawls</b> (Danish and French trawlers) and trammel-nets (French gillnetters), and the increased polyvalence of Basque bottom trawlers. The results suggest that fishing effort descriptors that are not traditionally measured (gear type, groundrope type, length of net used per day, headline length, crew size, number of winch or net drums) may have a substantial impact on catch rates. Adjusting fishing effort using such descriptors may generally improve the relationship between fishing effort and fishing mortality...|$|R
25|$|Otter {{trawlers}} {{usually have}} two gallows at the stern with towing blocks. The towing warps run through these, each regulated {{by its own}} winch. Medium and large trawlers usually have a stern ramp for hauling the trawl onto the deck. Some trawlers tow <b>twin</b> parallel <b>trawls,</b> using three warps, each warp with its own winch. Some otter trawlers are also outrigger trawlers (above), using outriggers to tow one or two otter trawls from each side.|$|R

The parallel <b>twin</b> body <b>trawl</b> showed an increase of 28 % in catch over that of bulged belly with a break up of 39. 9 % and 23. 1 % for prawns and fishes respectively. The increase in catch is attributed to the extra wide mouth opening (26. 6 %) of the parallel twin-body trawl. Parallel twin-body trawl had 8. 96 % lesser resistance which resulted in lower utilization of horse power...|$|R

40|$|A new {{approach}} to the bycatch problem when trawling for shrimp was initiated in Norway in 1984 utilizing the difference in swimming behaviour of fish and shrimp. A radial escape section (RES) in the aft belly of the trawl allowed fish to activly escape as shrimp was guided by funnels of netting towards the codend. The performance of the new selective device (RES) as well as behaviour of fish in trawls has been observed by a remote controlled television vehicle (RCTV). Comparative fishing experiments to evaluate its selective properties was conducted with a siamese <b>twin</b> <b>trawl</b> {{as well as with}} two trawlers fishing in the same area...|$|E
40|$|Otter trawls {{are very}} {{effective}} at capturing flatfish, {{but they can}} affect the seaf loor ecosystems where they are used. Alaska f latf ish trawlers have very long cables (called sweeps) between doors and net to herd fish {{into the path of}} the trawl. These sweeps, which ride on and can disturb the seaf loor, account for most of the area affected by these trawls and hence {{a large proportion of the}} potential for damage to seaf loor organisms. We examined modifications to otter trawls, such that disk clusters were installed at 9 -m intervals to raise trawl sweeps small distances above the seafloor, greatly reducing the area of direct seafloor contact. A critical consideration was whether flatfish would still be herded effectively by these sweeps. We compared conventional and modified sweeps using a <b>twin</b> <b>trawl</b> system and analyzed the volume and composition of the resulting catches. We tested sweeps raised 5, 7. 5, and 10 cm and observed no significant losses of flatfish catch until sweeps were raised 10 cm, and those losses were relatively small (5 – 10...|$|E
40|$|Common {{shrimp trawl}} designs {{employed}} in the southeastern United States shrimp fishery are the flat, balloon, semiballoon, jib, and super X- 3. Recent innovations in trawl design and rigging, including the <b>twin</b> <b>trawl</b> rigging and tongue trawl design, have improved the efficiency of shrimp trawling gear. A description of the construction techniques for the different designs indicate differences which affect gear performance. Measurements of horizontal spread and vertical opening for 76 trawl configurations indicate the relative efficiencies of the different designs. Maximum horizontal spreading efficiency was achieved by the "twin" and "tongue" trawl designs followed by the super X- 3, jib, balloon, and semiballoon designs. Designs having the greatest vertical openings were the tongue and flat trawl designs followed by the semiballoon. Maximum total gape dimension was demonstrated by the "Mongoose" tongue trawl. Comparison of trawl spreading efficiency and door area to headrope length ratio indicates that a range of 70 - 80 in square (per door) of door area is required for each foot of trawl headrope length for maximum efficiency with conventional trawl designs and 66 - 75 in square per foot of headrope for tongue trawl designs.

40|$|A recent {{development}} in bottom trawling {{is the use}} of <b>twin</b> <b>trawl</b> equipment, where two trawl nets are towed side by side from a single vessel. This increases the catch rate and efficiently of the trawler. Governed by cost and catch optimization, the use of <b>twin</b> <b>trawl</b> systems are expected to become more popular in the future. Using two trawl nets will, in addition to trawl doors on each side, require a heavy clump weight in the middle to prevent the trawl nets lifting from the seabed. The largest clump weights can have a mass up to 9000 kg and can cause substantial load towed across subsea pipelines, and may in many cases be the governing design load with respect to external loads in pipeline design. The main objective in this thesis work was to simulate and investigate pull-over forces from clump weights on free spanning pipelines. All simulations were carried out in the computer software SIMLA. Six different small scale tests were simulated in order to verify the finite element model, a very good agreement was obtained. Design loads from trawl gear are generally implemented according to DNV-RP-F 111. The calculation methods provided in this recommended practice are based on the same small scale tests which was made available to this thesis work for verification purposes. The validity range of DNV-RP-F 111 reflects the range of the small scale tests i. e. only valid for rigid pipelines. The effect of increasing pipeline flexibility was investigated. Simulations were carried out for span heights 0. 25 m, 0. 50 m and 0. 75 m for a 12 ” pipeline. Two different pipeline models was applied, a 25 m rigid pipeline model with spring representing the lateral pipeline stiffness, and a 1000 m pipeline model including realistic soil resistance. The major finding was that pull-over forces decrease for increasing pipeline flexibility. Compared to DNV-RP-F 111 the obtained pull-over loads was found considerably lower, both in magnitude and duration. To avoid over-conservatism it is thus recommended that a design method accounting for pipeline flexibility should be developed and used in future pipeline designs. The effect of warp angle was simulated varying the warp line length from 2. 5 to 3. 5 times the water depth. The horizontal pull-over force was found to increase for increasing warp line length. Regarding clump weight design and towing configuration, simulations have shown that a forward clump weight center of gravity will reduce the pull-over loads. Applying a lower warp line attachment point resulted in a more uniform sliding motion of the clump weight during interference and pull-over loads was almost complete reduced to a case of initial impact. It is thus suggested that future clump weight design should reflect this to reduce interference loads on both trawl gear and subsea pipelines. </p...|$|E
40|$|A {{framework}} {{to assess the}} impact of mobile fishing gear on the seabed and benthic ecosystem is presented. The framework that can be used at regional and local scales provides indicators for both trawling pressure and ecological impact. It builds on high-resolution maps of trawling intensity and considers the physical effects of trawl gears on the seabed, on marine taxa, and on the functioning of the benthic ecosystem. Within the framework, a reductionist approach is applied that breaks down a fishing gear into its components, and a number of biological traits are chosen to determine either the vulnerability of the benthos to the impact of that gear component, or to provide a proxy for their ecological role. The approach considers gear elements, such as otter boards, <b>twin</b> <b>trawl</b> clump, and groundrope, and sweeps that herd the fish. The physical impact of these elements on the seabed, comprising scraping of the seabed, sediment mobilization, and penetration, is a function of the mass, size, and speed of the individual component. The impact of the elements on the benthic community is quantified using a biological-trait approach that considers the vulnerability of the benthic community to trawl impact (e. g. sediment position, morphology), the recovery rate (e. g. longevity, maturation age, reproductive characteristics, dispersal), and their ecological role. The framework is explored to compare the indicators for pressure and ecological impact of bottom trawling in three main seabed habitat types in the North Sea. Preliminary results show that the Sublittoral mud (EUNIS A 5. 3) is affected the most due to the combined effect of intensive fishing and large proportions of long-lived tax...|$|E
40|$|During {{the fishing}} process, fish {{react to a}} trawl {{with a series of}} {{behaviours}} that often are species and size specific. Thus, a thorough understanding of fish behaviour in relation to fishing gear and a scientific understanding of the ability of different gear designs to utilize or stimulate various behavioural patterns during the catching process are essential for developing more efficient, selective, and environmentally friendly trawls. Although many behavioural studies using optical and acoustic observation systems have been conducted, harsh observation conditions on the fishing grounds often hamper the ability to directly observe fish behaviour in relation to fishing gear. As an alternative to optical and acoustic methods, we developed and applied a new mathematical model to catch data to extract detailed and quantitative information about species- and size-dependent escape behaviour in towed fishing gear such as trawls. We used catch comparison data collected with a <b>twin</b> <b>trawl</b> setup; the only difference between the two trawls was that a 12 m long upper section was replaced with 800 mm diamond meshes in one of them. We investigated the length-based escape behaviour of cod (Gadus morhua), haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus), saithe (Pollachius virens), witch flounder (Glyptocephalus cynoglossus), and lemon sole (Microstomus kitt) and quantified the extent to which behavioural responses set limits for the large mesh panel's selective efficiency. Around 85 % of saithe, 80 % of haddock, 44 % of witch flounder, 55 % of lemon sole, and 55 % of cod (below 68 cm) contacted the large mesh panel and escaped. We also demonstrated the need to account for potential selectivity in the trawl body, as it can bias the assessment of length-based escape behaviour. Our indirect assessment of fish behaviour was in agreement with the direct observations made for the same species in a similar section of the trawl body reported in the literature...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. To provide {{recommendations}} on further optimum sustainable {{use of all}} water area of the Khadzhbey lagoon as a fisheries water body. Methodology. Hydrological and ichthyological samples have been collected according to standard methods. Fish were caught using gill net with mesh size from 25 to 110 mm and <b>twin</b> <b>trawl</b> with mesh size of 30 – 40 mm in cod-end. The methodical guidelines «Metodiki zboru і obrobki іhtіologіchnih і gіdrobіologіchnih materіalіv z metoju viznachennja lіmіtіv promislovogo viluchennja rib z velikih vodoshovishh і limanіv Ukrainy» (К., 1998) and «Metodicheskie ukazanija po ocenke chislennosti ryb v presnovodnyh vodoemah» (M. : VNIIPRH, 1990) were used for fish stock assessment. Findings. The paper presents the data {{on the state of}} food base of the Khadzhybei lagoon, the dynamics and current state of commercial fish fauna associated with water salinity changes. It was demonstrated that the annual commercial catch of fish in the Khadzhybey lagoon in 2007 – 2014 ranged from 302. 4 to 1, 119. 0 tons. The catches were dominated by red lip mullet (haarder) (149. 7 – 905. 1 tons), Chinese carps (56, 5 – 282, 3 tons) and Prussian carp (10, 1 – 171, 7 tons). The stock of haarder and pikeperch in the Khadzhybey lagoon depends on the efficiency of their spawning {{as well as on the}} intensity of fish harvest. The stocks of freshwater fish — Prussian carp, silver carp, bighead carp, and common carp completely depend on artificial stocking with these species. It was shown that there is a tendency of the gradual increase in salinity of the water body in the condition of the regulated inflow of rivers, loss of the permanent connection of the lagoon with the sea, and climate change. Further increase in the salinity will result in significant reduction in fish productivity of the water body. A necessity for performing works aimed at improving the hydrological regimen of waters of the Khadzhybey lagoon and Paliev bay was shown. Originality. The {{recommendations on}} the optimum sustainable use of the total area of the Khadzhybey lagoon as a fisheries water body are provided for the first time. Current state of commercial fish fauna is presented. Practical value. Two variants (trends) of fisheries use of the Khadzhibey lagoon and Paliev Bay as a single water body were proposed. The introduced red lip mullet Liza haematocheila (Temminck et Schlegel, 1845) as the species the most adapted to the current regime of high salinity in the lagoon serves as the major commercial species in the both cases of the proposed exploitation of the lagoon...|$|E
