The Auditor's office found the managed care companies were not efficiently processing claims to health care providers despite receiving more than 700 million taxpayer dollars. Edelen created a new Medicaid Accountability and <b>Transparency</b> <b>Unit</b> in the Auditor's office to provide real-time oversight over the second-largest expenditure in state government.|$|E

50|$|A September 2015 {{article in}} Foreign Policy {{described}} how La Paz “freed itself from a ubiquitous culture of corruption.” This took place thanks to Juan Del Granado, elected mayor in 1999 {{on a platform}} of “transformation.” When he ordered fuel for municipal vehicles and the supplier handed him a check for $1,000, the usual kickback, he expelled the man from city hall. He set in place a zero-tolerance policy on graft. Former mayors, including Gaby Candia, Lupe Andrade, and Germán Monroy Chazarreta, were prosecuted and jailed. In 2004, Del Granado established a <b>Transparency</b> <b>Unit,</b> which provided a special telephone tip line, email address, and online complaints procedure for reporting corruption, and whose staffers posed as public-service users to ferret out officials who demanded irregular fees and bribes. Del Granado also instituted rewards for good practice, giving out awards to “efficient, transparent, cordial, and honest” city employees. In addition, he vigorously enforced the 1990 Financial Administration System and Governmental Control Act (SAFCO) and encouraged citizen participation in neighborhood governance.|$|E

However, market transparency can also affect incentives to deviate from collusive agreements and the punishment by rival firms in the market. Using a panel of 27 European countries, we analyze the impact of increased market transparency via {{the introduction of a}} market <b>transparency</b> <b>unit</b> for fuels in Germany. Applying a difference-in-differences approach, we find evidence that both gasoline and diesel prices have increased.

50|$|In 2003, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) was {{established}} as a law enforcement agency to investigate financial crimes such as advance fee fraud (419 fraud) and money laundering.While the ICPC targets corruption in the public sector, especially bribery, gratification, graft and abuse or misuse of office, the EFCC investigates people in all sectors who appear to be living above their means, and is empowered to investigate and prosecute money laundering and other financial crimes. The EFCC tracks illicit wealth accruing from abuse of office, especially attempts to integrate such wealth into the financial system.There have been tensions between the two commissions. The ICPC chairman, Justice Emmanuel Ayoola, has complained about duplication of the functions of ICPC by the EFCC, particularly overlap between the ICPC Anti-Corruption and <b>Transparency</b> Monitoring <b>Units</b> and the EFCC Anti-Corruption and Transparency Committees.|$|R

Thus, hospitals should acquire appropriate medical IT systems to provide accurate medical information of patients based on operational innovation. In addition, the use of medical IT systems have several potential benefits for operational innovation as follows: better communicate with colleagues and patients, improved operational processes, and providing timely information to improve patient care [24, 25].|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a {{transparent}} metamaterial (MTM) absorber in dual band application is proposed. The absorber is designed using on {{indium tin oxide}} (ITO) film for <b>transparency.</b> The <b>unit</b> cell of the proposed absorber consists of an electric LC (ELC) resonator and a ground plate, which are printed {{on opposite sides of}} the glass substrate. The ELC resonator comprises two symmetric triangular split ring resonators (TSRRs) for 8 GHz band and another two symmetric TSRRs for 12 GHz band. In low band, the absorber exhibits an absorption of 98. 6 % and a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 6. 3 % at 8 GHz. In high band, the absorber exhibits an absorption of 98. 2 % and a FWHM of 7. 6 % at 12 GHz.

40|$|We {{experimentally}} demonstrate at terahertz frequencies that a planar metamaterial {{exhibits a}} spectral response resembling electromagnetically induced <b>transparency.</b> The metamaterial <b>unit</b> cell {{consists of a}} split ring surrounded by another closed ring where their dimensions are such that their excitable lowest order modes have identical resonance frequencies but very different life times. Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy verifies that the interference of these two resonances results in a narrow transparency window located within a broad opaque region. In contrast to previous studies this enhanced transmission is achieved by independently exciting two resonances in which their coupling to the radiation field, and thus their linewidth, differs strongly. Rigorous numerical simulations prove that the transparency window {{is associated with a}} large group index and low losses, making the design potentially useful for slow light applications. This experiment opens an avenue to explore quantum mechanical phenomena using localized resonances in metallic structures...|$|R

At the same time, the more traditional instructional materials such as slide/tapes, filmstrips, <b>transparencies,</b> instructional <b>units,</b> skill sheets, books and booklets continue to be used in classrooms and laboratories. Varrella (1989) stated, " [...] . there is a wealth of instructional material available to use that will serve many of our needs, if we can only access that material effectively and use it efficiently. ” The Iowa Vocational Agricultural Teachers Association (IVATA) Instructional Materials Committee began to develop and distribute a packet of instructional materials in the summer of 1970. The instructional packet program was originated by Iowa teachers to promote the development and distribution of quality teaching {{materials for}} secondary and post-secondary agricultural education programs. The first packet in 1970 -consisted of five transparency master sets and was made available to the high school vocational agriculture teachers at a cost of $ 5. 00. On hundred and ten packets were distributed that first year. In 1990. a packet consisted of videotapes on aquaculture, farm safety and biotechnology as well as booklets on water, fish farming, shop plans and instructional units on natural resources and agricultural biotechnology. The 1990 packet sold for $ 50. 00 and 208 packets were distributed at the summer IVATA conference. During the past 11 years, 4, 548 instructional packets have been distributed to Iowa Schools. This is an average of 207 packets each year which is 80 percent of the agricultural education programs in Iowa.

40|$|A large {{percent of}} CO 2 (carbon dioxide) {{emissions}} in Serbia originate from transport. In {{the last two}} decades, the number of private car users in Belgrade evidently increased compared {{to the number of}} users of environmentally friendly modes of transport. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to present an overview of approaches to the improvement of the physical aspect of the open public spaces, which aim to increase the number of users of climate friendly modes of transport, particularly walking. Research was done using three methods: observation of the intensity of pedestrian movement in relation to different periods during the day, direct surveys of citizens and the evaluation of immediate pedestrian surroundings. Three kinds of results were obtained: the trends and concentration of pedestrian movement along the main street lines; the attitude of citizens pertaining to reliable pedestrian movement and elements which contribute to their commitment to walking; and the rhythm of activity <b>units,</b> <b>transparency,</b> and variety of activities on the ground floor of buildings. The contribution of the study is in combining different research methods. The interpretation of the results forms the basis for directing future research and campaigns on topics of climate friendly modes of transport in urban areas...|$|R
