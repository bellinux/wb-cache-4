5|$|September saw Maine and Vermont go heavily Republican {{in their}} state elections, meaning the Northeast was likely safe for McKinley. Early in that month, {{dissident}} Democrats, who favored the gold standard and President Cleveland's policies, formed the National Democratic Party, or Gold Democrats, meeting in Indianapolis. The nomination of Illinois Senator John M. Palmer for president and former Kentucky governor Simon Bolivar Buckner for vice president meant Bryan would have to overcome an electoral split in his party. Hanna applauded the selection, and predicted it would get large numbers of votes. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>chance</b> Palmer would win the election, and Hanna {{saw to it that}} the Gold Democrats were aided with quietly-provided funds.|$|E
5|$|On April 1, {{the defense}} {{asked for the}} new trial to be moved outside Brownsville, {{claiming}} their client had received unfair treatment {{in the media and}} <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>chance</b> for her to have a fair trial and an unbiased jury. The request included large numbers of magazines and newspaper articles published since 1993. It did not cite any specific passages where the alleged media bias was demonstrated. The defense also filed a motion to throw out the new indictment {{on the grounds that it}} was double jeopardy. On April 27, the judge decided to postpone his decision about where to hold the trial. He also rejected the defense motion stating that the new indictment was a case of double jeopardy. The defense argued that the prosecution had illegally used Brownsville and Houston grand juries to work on the case, but the judge countered that claim saying only the Houston grand jury had handled the case. On May 4, the trial was moved from Brownsville to Houston, Texas, because of the earlier extensive media coverage.|$|E
5|$|These initial concerns, however, {{were short}} lived, {{at least in}} the {{beginning}} as the British government provided assurances that it would underwrite a large amount of the war risk insurance for shipping in order to allow trade amongst the Commonwealth to continue. Shortly thereafter the wartime direction of trade began when the British asked the Australian government to place certain restrictions upon overseas trade in order to secure resources vital to the war effort and to limit the ability of the Central Powers from obtaining these goods from Commonwealth nations via neutral third parties. To an extent these restrictions served to reduce the ability of Australian producers to find buyers for their products, at least initially, however, in many cases the British stepped in to buy these goods, thus alleviating Australian concerns about a significant reduction in the standard of living. This understanding proved particularly beneficial for the wool and wheat industries, where the British government undertook to buy Australian products even though the shortage of shipping meant that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>chance</b> that they would ever receive them.|$|E

25|$|In 1914 the Australian {{economy was}} small but very nearly the most propserous {{in the world}} per capita; it {{depended}} on the export of wool and mutton. London provided assurances that it would underwrite {{a large amount of}} the war risk insurance for shipping in order to allow trade amongst the Commonwealth nations to continue. London imposed controls so that no exports would wind up in German hands. The British government protected prices by buying Australian products, even though the shortage of shipping meant that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>chance</b> that they would ever receive them.|$|E
25|$|A {{relationship}} between the early experiences and environment of boys, and their later sexual behaviour, has been drawn by several studies. Research suggests that father absence can {{lead to an increase}} in rape behaviour. Research conducted by Malamuth found that men raised in the absence of their father (or where resources were scarce) reported more use of sexual coercion in the past, and were more likely to indicate being more willing to rape, in the event that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>chance</b> of them getting caught. Research has also found that parental divorce and rape correlate positively.|$|E

Round 3 consisted of 16 teams, comprising the eight losers from Round 2 plus the eight winners from the backdoor system.

25|$|Germany invaded Norway in April 1940. The {{country was}} {{completely}} occupied by June. There were about 1,800 Jews in Norway, persecuted by the Norwegian Nazis. In late 1940, the Jews were banned from some occupations and in 1941 all Jews had to register their property with the government. Also in 1940, Germany invaded Denmark. The country was overrun {{so quickly that}} <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>chance</b> of organizing resistance. Consequently, the Danish government stayed in power and the Germans {{found it easier to}} work through it. Because of this, few measures were taken against the Danish Jews before 1942.|$|E

On 4 December, supported by the Madrid Cardinal Paleotti received 33 votes (he needed another 3 to win). Montalto did not want the victory of Paleotti, so together with Sforza came to the conclusion that in order to prevent his election, they needed to support either Sfondrati or Facchinetti. At the end they decided to elect Sfondrati.|$|E

On the same day, in the afternoon, Prime Minister de Villepin announced to the National Assembly that he invoked article 49-3 of the Constitution of France on that text; this meant that the law would be considered adopted in its current state, without being approved by the National Assembly, unless a motion of censure were adopted by the Assembly. Since Villepin's UMP party had an absolute majority in the Assembly, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>chance</b> that such a motion could be adopted. Predictably, a motion of censure was proposed by the left-wing opposition and was rejected by the Assembly on 21 February.|$|E

25|$|Hannibal {{had been}} able to win over a major allied base by his {{tremendous}} military success. He also regarded it as essential to take the city of Nola, a Roman fortress in Campania, a region that linked his various allies geographically and contained his most important harbour for supply. Prior to his first attempt, the pro-Carthage faction in the city had been eliminated by the Romans, so <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>chance</b> of the city being betrayed. Hannibal repeatedly tried to take this city by assault or siege, but was thwarted three times, in 216, 215 and 214, by forces led by Marcus Claudius Marcellus. By 215 Hannibal was able to take Casilinum, the other important site for controlling Campania.|$|E
25|$|Rob Andrew, then Director of Rugby at Falcons (Andrew {{has since}} been {{appointed}} Director of Elite Rugby for the English Rugby Football Union), said that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>chance</b> of Wilkinson going on England's summer tour {{and that he would}} be taking the summer off. Despite missing two conversions, he demonstrated his playmaker skills in the game against the Worcester Warriors on 30 April, in which he played the whole second half. Afterwards, Andrew reiterated that Wilkinson should not tour during the summer to prolong his recovery period. Wilkinson started as captain in the Falcons last 2005-06 Guinness Premiership game of the season on Saturday, 6 May 2006, converting six of his team's eight tries in their 54–19 victory over Leeds Tykes.|$|E
25|$|Admiral Pascual Cervera y Topete (18 February 1839, Medina-Sidonia, Cadíz, Spain – 3 April 1909, Puerto Real, Cadíz, Spain) was a {{prominent}} Spanish naval officer with the rank of Almirante (admiral) who served {{in a number of}} high positions within the Spanish Navy and had fought in several wars during the 19th century.

Although he believed that the Spanish Navy was suffering from multiple problems and that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>chance</b> for victory over the United States Navy, Cervera took command of the squadron and fought in a last stand during the Battle of Santiago de Cuba.|$|E
