By 1972, he had departed Columbia for the Verve division of MGM Records (Philips in the UK) and had relocated for a stint in London, where he hosted a television show from <b>the</b> <b>Talk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Town</b> nightclub in conjunction with Thames Television, Tony Bennett at <b>the</b> <b>Talk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Town.</b> With his new label, he tried a variety of approaches, including some more Beatles material, but found no renewed commercial success, and in a couple more years he was without a recording contract.|$|E

5|$|One of these, <b>The</b> <b>Talk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Town,</b> was {{the first}} three-time World Grand Champion. Midnight Sun was also great-grandsire of I Am Jose, the second three-time winner. Most of the leading Tennessee Walker sires {{in recent years have}} {{themselves}} been descendants of Midnight Sun. Midnight Sun sired approximately 2,600 foals in his lifetime, and during his stud career earned his owners close to $100,000 a year, mostly through the then-new use of artificial insemination (AI). Through his offspring, he has also influenced the Racking Horse and Spotted Saddle Horse breeds. For many years, a life-size statue of Midnight Sun, commissioned after his death by his former owner Geraldine Livingston, stood at the TWHBEA headquarters in Lewisburg, Tennessee.|$|E

She returned to the UK with a record-breaking run of performances at <b>the</b> <b>Talk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Town</b> nightclub. Also that year, her album Something was released, and showcased a new Bassey style, a shift from traditional pop to more contemporary songs and arrangements (the eponymous single was more successful in the UK charts than the original recording by The Beatles) – although Bassey would never completely abandon what that had been her forte: standards, show tunes, and torch songs.|$|E

25|$|Local gossips noticed Wright's flirtations, and he {{developed}} a reputation in Oak Park as a man-about-town. His family had grown to six children, but Wright was not parental and he relied on his wife Catherine to care for them. In 1903, Wright designed a house for Edwin Cheney, a neighbor in Oak Park, and immediately took a liking to Cheney's wife, Mamah. Mamah Cheney was a modern woman with interests outside the home. She was an early feminist and Wright viewed her as his intellectual equal. The two fell in love, and they became <b>the</b> <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>town,</b> as they often could be seen taking rides in Wright's automobile through Oak Park. Wright's wife, Kitty, sure that this attachment would fade as the others had, refused to grant him a divorce. Mamah had to live in Europe {{for two years in}} order to obtain a divorce from Edwin on the grounds of desertion.|$|E

Also in July, the compilation album The Seekers' Greatest Hits was released and spent 17 weeks at No.1 in Australia. It was released as The Best of The Seekers in the UK and spent 6 weeks at No.1 in 1969, managing to knock The Beatles' (White Album) {{off the top of the}} charts and preventing The Rolling Stones' Beggars Banquet from reaching the top spot.

[...] Since 1949, only four horses not of Midnight Sun's line have won the Tennessee Walking Horse World Grand Championship, the breed's highest honor. [...] Midnight Sun sired five horses who won the World Grand Championship: Midnight Merry in 1949; <b>The</b> <b>Talk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Town</b> in 1951, 1952, and 1953; Sun's Jet Parade in 1957; Setting Sun in 1958; and Sun's Delight D. in 1963.|$|E

500|$|The central {{action of}} Love's Last Shift {{is a celebration}} of the power of a good woman, Amanda, to reform a rakish husband, Loveless, by means of sweet {{patience}} and a daring bed-trick. She masquerades as a prostitute and seduces Loveless without being recognised, and then confronts him with logical argument. Since he enjoyed the night with her while taking her for a stranger, a wife can be as good in bed as an illicit mistress. Loveless is convinced and stricken, and a rich choreography of mutual kneelings, risings and prostrations follows, generated by Loveless' penitence and Amanda's [...] "submissive eloquence". The première audience is said to have wept at this climactic scene. The play was a great box-office success and was for a time <b>the</b> <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>town,</b> in both a positive and a negative sense. Some contemporaries regarded it as moving and amusing, others as a sentimental tear-jerker, incongruously interspersed with sexually explicit Restoration comedy jokes and semi-nude bedroom scenes.|$|E
500|$|In 1942 Grant {{participated in}} a three-week tour of the United States {{as part of a}} group to help the war effort and was photographed visiting wounded marines in hospital. He {{appeared}} in several routines of his own during these shows and often played the straight-man opposite Bert Lahr. In May 1942, the ten-minute propaganda short Road to Victory was released, in which he appeared alongside Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra and Charles Ruggles. On film, Grant played Leopold Dilg, a convict on the run in <b>The</b> <b>Talk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Town</b> (1942), who escapes after being wrongly convicted of arson and murder. He hides in a house with characters played by Jean Arthur and Ronald Colman, and gradually plots to secure his freedom. Crowther praised the script, and noted that Grant played Dilg with a [...] "casualness which is slightly disturbing". After a role as a foreign correspondent opposite Ginger Rogers and Walter Slezak in the off-beat comedy Once Upon a Honeymoon, in which he was praised for his scenes with Rogers, he appeared in Mr. Lucky the following year, playing a gambler in a casino aboard a ship. The commercially successful submarine war film Destination Tokyo (1943) was shot in just six weeks in the September and October, which left him exhausted; the reviewer from Newsweek thought {{it was one of the}} finest performances of his career.|$|E
