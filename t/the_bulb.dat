5|$|In 1976, {{the fire}} {{department}} moved to Fire Station #6 with the bulb; <b>the</b> <b>bulb</b> socket's cord was severed for fear that unscrewing <b>the</b> <b>bulb</b> could damage it. It was deprived of electricity for only 22 minutes during the transfer, which was made in a specially designed box and with full firetruck escort. An electrician was on hand to install <b>the</b> <b>bulb</b> into the new fire station's emergency generator. Ripley's Believe It Or Not stated that the short delay would not mar the bulb's continuous burning record. In 2001, the bulb's 100th birthday was celebrated with a community barbecue and live music. Since that move, <b>the</b> <b>bulb</b> has run continuously for 38 years; previously it had only been off the grid for {{short periods of time}} (e.g. a week in 1937 for a renovation and the odd power outage).|$|E
5|$|Neck rot is a {{fungal disease}} {{affecting}} onions in storage. It {{is caused by}} Botrytis allii, which attacks the neck and upper parts of <b>the</b> <b>bulb,</b> causing a grey mould to develop. The symptoms often first occur where <b>the</b> <b>bulb</b> has been damaged and spread downwards in the affected scales. Large quantities of spores are produced and crust-like sclerotia may also develop. In time, a dry rot sets in and <b>the</b> <b>bulb</b> becomes a dry, mummified structure. This disease may be present throughout the growing period, but only manifests itself when <b>the</b> <b>bulb</b> is in storage. Antifungal seed dressings are available and the disease can be minimised by preventing physical damage to the bulbs at harvesting, careful drying and curing of the mature onions, and correct storage in a cool, dry place with plenty of circulating air.|$|E
5|$|On {{the evening}} of May 20, 2013, the general public witnessed, through a {{dedicated}} webcam, that <b>the</b> <b>bulb</b> had apparently burned out. The next morning, an electrician {{was called in to}} confirm its status. It was determined that <b>the</b> <b>bulb</b> had not burned out when the uninterruptible power supply was bypassed, using an extension cord. The dedicated power supply was found to have been faulty. Approximately seven hours had transpired before the light was reestablished.|$|E
50|$|A {{familiar}} {{example of}} group testing involves {{a string of}} lightbulbs connected series, where we know exactly one of <b>the</b> <b>bulbs</b> is broken. <b>The</b> objective is to find <b>the</b> broken <b>bulb</b> using <b>the</b> smallest number of tests (a test is when we connect some of <b>the</b> <b>bulbs</b> to a power supply). A simple approach is to test each bulb individually. However, when there are {{a large number of}} bulbs we can be much more efficient if we pool <b>the</b> <b>bulbs</b> into groups. For example, if we connect the first half of <b>the</b> <b>bulbs</b> at once, we can determine which half <b>the</b> broken <b>bulb</b> is in, ruling out half of <b>the</b> <b>bulbs</b> in just one test.|$|R
500|$|<b>The</b> <b>bulbs</b> produce {{contractile}} roots; {{when these}} roots contract, they draw <b>the</b> <b>bulbs</b> down into deeper {{layers of the}} soil where there is greater moisture, reaching depths of [...] This may explain the absence of H.non-scripta from some thin soils over chalk in South East England, since <b>the</b> <b>bulbs</b> are unable to penetrate into sufficiently deep soils.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>bulbs</b> are solitary or {{clustered}} and tunicate and {{the plants}} are perennialized by <b>the</b> <b>bulbs</b> reforming annually {{from the base of}} <b>the</b> old <b>bulbs,</b> or are produced on the ends of rhizomes or, in a few species, at the ends of stolons. A small number of species have tuberous roots. The bulbs' outer coats are commonly brown or grey, with a smooth texture, and are fibrous, or with cellular reticulation. The inner coats of <b>the</b> <b>bulbs</b> are membranous.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>bulb</b> lies dormant {{after the}} leaves and flower stem die back and has {{contractile}} roots that pull it down further into the soil. The flower stem and leaves form in <b>the</b> <b>bulb,</b> to emerge the following season. Most species are dormant from summer to late winter, flowering in the spring, though a few species are autumn flowering.|$|E
5|$|In the autumn, {{the leaves}} die {{back and the}} outer scales of <b>the</b> <b>bulb</b> become dry and brittle, so the crop is then {{normally}} harvested. If left in the soil over winter, the growing point {{in the middle of}} <b>the</b> <b>bulb</b> begins to develop in the spring. New leaves appear and a long, stout, hollow stem expands, topped by a bract protecting a developing inflorescence. The inflorescence {{takes the form of a}} globular umbel of white flowers with parts in sixes. The seeds are glossy black and triangular in cross section.|$|E
5|$|Onions have {{particularly}} large {{cells that}} are readily observed under low magnification. Forming a single layer of cells, <b>the</b> <b>bulb</b> epidermis is easy to separate for educational, experimental, and breeding purposes.|$|E
50|$|In Africa some tribes consume <b>the</b> <b>bulbs</b> of L. revoluta. It {{is widely}} used as an ethnomedicinal in Southern Africa. Homoisoflavanones can be {{isolated}} from <b>the</b> <b>bulbs</b> of L. revoluta.|$|R
50|$|The blood inside <b>the</b> <b>bulb’s</b> erectile {{tissue is}} {{released}} to the circulatory system by the spasms of orgasm, but if orgasm does not occur, the blood will exit <b>the</b> <b>bulbs</b> over several hours.|$|R
50|$|Consider a {{very simple}} circuit {{consisting}} of four light bulbs and one 6 V battery. If a wire joins the battery to one <b>bulb,</b> to <b>the</b> next <b>bulb,</b> to <b>the</b> next <b>bulb,</b> to <b>the</b> next <b>bulb,</b> {{then back to the}} battery, in one continuous loop, <b>the</b> <b>bulbs</b> are said to be in series. If each bulb is wired to the battery in a separate loop, <b>the</b> <b>bulbs</b> are said to be in parallel. If <b>the</b> four light <b>bulbs</b> are connected in series, there is same current through all of them, and the voltage drop is 1.5 V across each bulb, which may not be sufficient to make them glow. If <b>the</b> light <b>bulbs</b> are connected in parallel, the currents through <b>the</b> light <b>bulbs</b> combine to form the current in the battery, while the voltage drop is across each bulb and they all glow.|$|R
5|$|Onions {{suffer from}} a number of plant disorders. The most serious for the home {{gardener}} are likely to be the onion fly, stem and bulb eelworm, white rot, and neck rot. Diseases affecting the foliage include rust and smut, downy mildew, and white tip disease. The bulbs may be affected by splitting, white rot, and neck rot. Shanking is a condition in which the central leaves turn yellow and the inner part of <b>the</b> <b>bulb</b> collapses into an unpleasant-smelling slime. Most of these disorders are best treated by removing and burning affected plants. The larvae of the onion leaf miner or leek moth (Acrolepiopsis assectella) sometimes attack the foliage and may burrow down into <b>the</b> <b>bulb.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>bulb</b> of the radish {{is usually}} eaten raw, {{although}} tougher specimens can be steamed. The raw flesh has a crisp texture and a pungent, peppery flavor, caused by glucosinolates and the enzyme myrosinase, which combine when chewed to form allyl isothiocyanates, {{also present in}} mustard, horseradish, and wasabi.|$|E
5|$|The {{toxicity}} of Narcissus varies with species, N. poeticus being more toxic than N. pseudonarcissus, for instance. The distribution of toxins within the plant also varies, for instance {{there is a}} five times higher concentration of alkaloid in the stem of N. papyraceus than in <b>the</b> <b>bulb,</b> making it dangerous to herbivores more likely to consume the stem than <b>the</b> <b>bulb,</b> and {{is part of the}} plant's defence mechanisms. The distribution of alkaloids within tissues may also reflect defence against parasites. The bulbs can also be toxic to other nearby plants, including roses, rice, and cabbages, inhibiting growth. For instance placing cut flowers in a vase alongside other flowers shortens the life of the latter.|$|E
40|$|Several bulbous crops like Crocus, Allium {{and some}} species of Tulipa and Narcissus can be {{infected}} with the nematode Aphelenchoides subtenuis. The nematodes cause retarded growth, poor or no flowering and eventually death of <b>the</b> <b>bulbs</b> and corms. A hot water treatment after lifting <b>the</b> <b>bulbs</b> {{has proved to be}} effective in controlling the nematodes. Due to a high incidence of infected stocks of bulbs a study was conducted to establish if the efficacy of the treatment could be improved by altering the timing and the temperature of the hot water treatment and the storage temperature of <b>the</b> <b>bulbs</b> prior to <b>the</b> hot water treatment. Bulbs and corms of Allium and Crocus were given a hot water treatment of four hours at 43. 5 or 45 °C. Between lifting and the hot water treatment <b>the</b> <b>bulbs</b> were stored at 25 or 30 °C. Prior to the hot water treatment some of <b>the</b> <b>bulbs</b> were immersed in water for 24 hours. The hot water treatment was performed at 7, 10, 12 or 14 days after lifting <b>the</b> <b>bulbs</b> or corms. Controlling Aphelenchoides subtenuis was only effective when the hot water treatment of four hours at 45 °C was applied within 10 to 14 days after lifting <b>the</b> <b>bulbs.</b> When Crocus was stored at 30 °C a hot water treatment was only effective until 10 days after lifting. When stored at 25 °C a treatment was effective until 14 days after lifting. The hot water treatment became more effective when <b>the</b> <b>bulbs</b> were immersed in water for 24 hours prior to the hot water treatment...|$|R
50|$|While <b>the</b> <b>bulbs</b> of Camassia {{species are}} edible and nutritious, the white-flowered meadow death-camas (which {{is not in}} Camassia, {{but part of the}} genus Toxicoscordion that grows in the same areas) is toxic, and <b>the</b> <b>bulbs</b> are {{difficult}} to distinguish.|$|R
50|$|Oxalis triangularis are {{plants that}} grow from bulbs, and their {{propagation}} {{is done by}} division of <b>the</b> <b>bulbs.</b> Like other <b>bulbs,</b> <b>the</b> oxalis go through dormancy periods on a regular basis; {{at the end of}} such period, <b>the</b> <b>bulbs</b> can be unearthed, sidebulbs cut and replanted in appropriate soil, where they will grow into new plants.|$|R
5|$|Eye {{irritation}} can {{be avoided}} by cutting onions under running water or submerged in a basin of water. Leaving the root end intact also reduces irritation as the onion base has a higher concentration of sulphur compounds {{than the rest of}} <b>the</b> <b>bulb.</b> Refrigerating the onions before use reduces the enzyme reaction rate and using a fan can blow the gas away from the eyes. The more often one chops onions, the less one experiences eye irritation.|$|E
5|$|Reproduction is {{generally}} by allogamy (cross-pollination) and Hippeastrum may be propagated by seed or offset bulbils (bulblets), although commercial ventures use in vitro techniques, or splitting of <b>the</b> <b>bulb</b> into sections. The genus has been intensely bred and cultivated {{since the early}} nineteenth century to produce large colourful showy flowers. In temperate climes these can be placed outside in the summer, and after a dormancy period, be induced to rebloom inside in the winter.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{commercial}} propagation method {{is referred to}} as 'twin scales'. This involves the division of <b>the</b> <b>bulb</b> into 12 sections and then separating each section into twin scales connected by the basal plate. The cuttings that are derived from these are grown in moist vermiculite in the dark till bulbils appear. More recently growing them in sunlight produce a better crop.|$|E
50|$|In autumn <b>the</b> <b>bulbs</b> were {{harvested}} {{after the}} flowers dried up and were boiled or pit-cooked. <b>The</b> <b>bulbs</b> were also dried and ground into flour. As the settlers began {{to expand their}} territory, they raised cattle which limited the growth of camas in the area.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>bulbs</b> of Calochortus amabilis are a {{traditional}} food of the Kashaya Pomo of California, who bake or boil <b>the</b> <b>bulbs,</b> {{which are then}} eaten like baked or boiled potatoes. They are a beloved food of the Pomo, locally referred to as [...] "bo".|$|R
40|$|Various {{plant spacing}} {{resulted}} in the increased plant height, onion bulb size, weight of <b>the</b> <b>bulbs,</b> number of <b>the</b> <b>bulbs</b> per plot and yield of <b>the</b> <b>bulbs.</b> In case of different nitrogen levels, all the parameters under the study were significantly affected. However, 12 cm plant spacing with 100 kg N ha - 1 gave the best results. Maximum yield of onion bulbs (22. 90 and 22. 82 t ha - 1 ) was obtained from 12 cm plant spacing with 100 kg N ha - 1 , respectively...|$|R
5|$|This Case further {{represented}} {{the development of}} the incandescent electric light bulb from the fundamental steps shown in Case #1. These electric lamps were from worldwide inventors that worked directly with Edison on ideas. The electric light bulbs were grouped chronologically from 1881 to 1904. Among these were some Diehl's induction lamps for use with alternating current. A description of how this technology worked is that of a secondary coil of wire was placed inside <b>the</b> <b>bulb</b> of a vacuum. The two ends of the coiled wire connected to the filament that was electrified and provided the light. A primary coil was wound {{on the outside of the}} glass bulb. This coil was connected to an alternating current electrical power supply. The secondary coil inside <b>the</b> <b>bulb</b> would receive this alternating magnetism from the primary coil and provide an electrical current that electrified the inside filament. Ultimately this type of alternating current technology never developed and was not used. Pictures of some of the lamps that were in this display are below. These were later numbered 358 to 536.|$|E
5|$|Zygoballus sexpunctatus {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to Zygoballus rufipes, with whom its range overlaps. The male can be distinguished from Z.rufipes by the large spot of white scales {{at the beginning of}} the thoracic slope (which is lacking in Z. rufipes), and by the longitudinal division present on <b>the</b> <b>bulb</b> of the pedipalp (Z. rufipes has a transverse division). The female can best be distinguished by the form of the epigyne (the external genital structure).|$|E
5|$|Amanita abrupta {{was first}} {{described}} by American mycologist Charles Horton Peck in 1897, {{based on a}} specimen he found in Auburn, Alabama. Because {{the remains of the}} volva are not present on <b>the</b> <b>bulb</b> in dried, mature, specimens, Peck thought that the species should be grouped with Amanita rubescens and A.spissa. Synonyms include binomials resulting from generic transfers by Jean-Edouard Gilbert to Lepidella in 1928, and to Aspidella in 1940. Both of these genera have since been subsumed into Amanita.|$|E
25|$|Fluorescent and halogen-produced {{light can}} also produce {{large amounts of}} UV radiation, though filters which fit over <b>the</b> <b>bulbs</b> are {{available}} to limit the damaging light. These filters {{will need to be}} replaced when <b>the</b> <b>bulbs</b> are changed, so maintenance staff should be aware of them and their use.|$|R
50|$|Agapanthus africanus can {{be grown}} within USDA plant {{hardiness}} zones 9 to 11. In lower-numbered zones, <b>the</b> <b>bulbs</b> should be placed deeper in the soil and mulched well in the fall. Agapanthus can be propagated by dividing <b>the</b> <b>bulbs</b> or by seeds. The seeds of most varieties are fertile.|$|R

5|$|Before this {{parliamentary}} decree, the purchaser of a tulip contract—known {{in modern}} finance as a futures contract—was legally obliged {{to buy the}} bulbs. The decree {{changed the nature of}} these contracts, so that if the current market price fell, the purchaser could opt to pay a penalty and forgo receipt of <b>the</b> <b>bulb,</b> rather than pay the full contracted price. This change in law meant that, in modern terminology, the futures contracts had been transformed into options contracts. This proposal began to be debated in the fall of 1636, and if it became clear to investors that the decree was likely to be enacted, prices probably would have risen.|$|E
5|$|Bulbs are {{harvested}} for {{market in the}} summer, sorted, stored for 2 – 3 weeks, and then further disinfected by a hot (43.5°C) bath. This eliminates infestations by narcissus fly and nematodes. The bulbs are then dried at a high temperature, and then stored at 15.5°C. The initiation of new flower development in <b>the</b> <b>bulb</b> takes place in late spring before the bulbs are lifted, and is completed by mid summer while the bulbs are in storage. The optimal temperature for initiation is 20°C followed by cooling to 13°C.|$|E
5|$|Ebert was {{a strong}} {{advocate}} for Maxivision 48, in which the movie projector runs at 48 frames per second, {{as compared to the}} usual 24 frames per second. He was opposed to the practice whereby theatres lower the intensity of their projector bulbs in order to extend the life of <b>the</b> <b>bulb,</b> arguing that this has little effect other than to make the film harder to see. Ebert was skeptical of the recent resurgence of 3D effects in film, which he found unrealistic and distracting.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are usually}} two {{three-way}} switches {{near the top}} of the floor lamp to operate <b>the</b> <b>bulbs.</b> One controls <b>the</b> three-way center <b>bulb,</b> and <b>the</b> other turns on one, two, or all three (or four) of <b>the</b> peripheral <b>bulbs.</b> <b>The</b> center <b>bulb</b> may be very high power (often a three-way, 100-200-300 watt <b>bulb),</b> where <b>the</b> others are usually 60 watts or less. Some models have a night light in the base operated by a foot switch.|$|R
50|$|In {{contrast}} to vision and hearing, <b>the</b> olfactory <b>bulbs</b> are not cross-hemispheric; <b>the</b> right <b>bulb</b> connects to <b>the</b> right hemisphere and <b>the</b> left <b>bulb</b> connects to <b>the</b> left hemisphere.|$|R
