5|$|Adults of Diphyllobothrium infest fish, and the juveniles use copepod {{crustaceans}} as intermediate hosts. Excreted proglottids {{release their}} eggs into the water, and the eggs hatch into ciliated, swimming larvae. If a larva is swallowed by a copepod, it sheds the cilia {{and the skin}} becomes a syncitium and the larva makes {{its way into the}} copepod's hemocoel (internal cavity that is <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the circulatory system) and attached itself with three small hooks. If the copepod is eaten by a fish, the larva metamorphoses into a small, unsegmented tapeworm, drills through to the gut and becomes an adult.|$|E

In order to overcome the disadvantages of the above two methods, a new method, a hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA), is presented, and is used to optimize <b>the</b> structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> hydroelectric sets. <b>The</b> computational results show the new method can obtain a global solution with a high search speed {{compared to the other}} two methods...|$|R
