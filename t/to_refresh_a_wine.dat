50|$|The {{solution}} {{used in the}} R800 was <b>to</b> <b>refresh</b> entire {{blocks of}} RAM, instead of refreshing one line of RAM on each instruction issued. Each 30μs, the CPU is halted for 4μs, this time is used <b>to</b> <b>refresh</b> <b>a</b> block of the RAM. Since there's no refresh in between fetch instructions, and the waitstate is removed due to faster RAM chips, simple instructions can be issued using only one cycle. This cycle would be cycle 2 in the Z80 example above; cycle 1 becomes optional, and it's only issued when the program crosses a 256-byte boundary.|$|R

40|$|We {{previously}} demonstrated mental rubbernecking {{during the}} simple cognitive act of <b>refreshing</b> <b>a</b> just activated representation. Participants saw two neutral and one negative word presented simultaneously and, 425 msec later, were cued <b>to</b> mentally <b>refresh</b> (i. e., think of) {{one of the}} no-longer-present words. They were slower <b>to</b> <b>refresh</b> <b>a</b> neutral word than the negative word (Johnson et al., 2005, Experiment 6 A). The present experiments extended that work by showing mental rubbernecking when negative items were sometimes the target of refreshing, but not when negative items were present but never the target of refreshing, indicating that expectations influence mental rubbernecking. How expectations might modulate the impact of emotional distraction is discussed. Cognitive, social, and clinical researchers have converging interests in understanding how emotion affects cognitio...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study how <b>to</b> <b>refresh</b> <b>a</b> local copy of an {{autonomous}} data source {{to maintain the}} copy up-to-date. As {{the size of the}} data grows, it becomes more di#cult to maintain the copy "fresh," making it crucial to synchronize the copy e#ectively. We define two freshness metrics, change models of the underlying data, and synchronization policies. We analytically study how effective the various policies are. We also experimentally verify our analysis, based on data collected from 270 web sites for more than 4 months, and we show that our new policy improves the "freshness" very significantly compared to current policies in use...|$|R

50|$|In American jurisprudence, {{under the}} rules for hearsay, {{admission}} of an unsupported affidavit as evidence is unusual (especially if the affiant is not available for cross-examination) with regard to material facts which may be dispositive of the matter at bar. Affidavits from persons who are dead or otherwise incapacitated, or who cannot be located or made to appear, may {{be accepted by the}} court, but usually only in the presence of corroborating evidence. An affidavit which reflected a better grasp of the facts close in time to the actual events may be used <b>to</b> <b>refresh</b> <b>a</b> witness's recollection. Materials used <b>to</b> <b>refresh</b> recollection are admissible as evidence. If the affiant is a party in the case, the affiant's opponent may be successful in having the affidavit admitted as evidence, as statements by a party-opponent are admissible through an exception to the hearsay rule.|$|R

5000|$|The storage cells on {{a memory}} chip {{are laid out}} in a {{rectangular}} array of rows and columns. The read process in DRAM is destructive and removes the charge on the memory cells in an entire row, so there is a row of specialized latches on the chip called sense amplifiers, one for each column of memory cells, to temporarily hold the data. During a normal read operation, the sense amplifiers after reading and latching the data, rewrite the data in the accessed row before sending the bit from a single column to output. So the normal read electronics on the chip has the ability <b>to</b> <b>refresh</b> <b>an</b> entire row of memory in parallel, significantly speeding up the <b>refresh</b> process. <b>A</b> normal read or write cycle <b>refreshes</b> <b>a</b> row of memory, but normal memory accesses cannot be relied on to hit all the rows within the necessary time, necessitating <b>a</b> separate <b>refresh</b> process. Rather than use the normal read cycle in the <b>refresh</b> process, <b>to</b> save time an abbreviated cycle called <b>a</b> <b>refresh</b> cycle is used.

40|$|As {{websites}} grow {{large and}} become more sophisticated, organizations use structured database systems {{as a source of}} base data for information on the website.

In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of scheduling a set of queries <b>to</b> <b>refresh</b> <b>a</b> very large website. Based on two types (tight and loose) of feasibility requirements, we present feasibility results when the base data change with uniform, regular and random periods. We found that tight feasibility depends on the interval length between two consecutively raised cell refresh requests while it is NP-Hard to determine loose feasibility when the base data have regular or random update periods. For the case when the base data have the uniform update periods, loose feasibilit [...] ...|$|R
