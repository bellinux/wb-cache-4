5|$|Porta Reale Curtain, {{also known}} as St. James Curtain – <b>the</b> <b>curtain</b> wall linking St. John's and St. James Bastions. The city's main gate is located within <b>the</b> <b>curtain</b> wall. The gate was rebuilt five times, with the present one being {{constructed}} between 2011 and 2014 to a design by Renzo Piano.|$|E
5|$|St. John's Curtain – <b>the</b> <b>curtain</b> wall linking St. Michael's and St. John's Bastions. It now forms part of Hastings Gardens.|$|E
5|$|The outer bailey is {{entered through}} a gatehouse; inside, the space within <b>the</b> <b>curtain</b> walls {{is divided into}} two. On {{the north side of}} the outer bailey is Castle House and its gardens; the house is a two-storeyed property, based around the old walls of the tennis court and the Castle Inn, and <b>the</b> <b>curtain</b> wall. The north end of Castle House butts onto Beacon Tower, {{overlooking}} the town.|$|E

Not <b>the</b> <b>curtains</b> at his feet, nor <b>the</b> <b>curtains</b> at his back, but those to which his face was addressed. <b>The</b> <b>curtains</b> of his bed were drawn aside; and Scrooge, {{starting}} up into a half-recumbent attitude, found himself {{face to face with}} the unearthly visitor who drew them: as close to it as I am now to you, and I am standing in the spirit at your elbow.|$|R

5000|$|In 2002, under John Ashcroft, {{curtains}} {{were installed}} blocking the statue from view during speeches. <b>The</b> <b>curtains</b> were first {{used on a}} rental basis during the administration of Dick Thornburgh. Justice officials long insisted that <b>the</b> <b>curtains</b> were put up to improve the room's use as a television backdrop and that Ashcroft {{had nothing to do}} with it.

5|$|Castile Curtain – <b>the</b> <b>curtain</b> wall linking St. James and St. Peter & Paul Bastions. Its parapet {{has been}} largely {{dismantled}} {{to make way for}} the road leading from Floriana to Valletta.|$|E
5|$|Manderaggio Curtain – <b>the</b> <b>curtain</b> wall linking St. Andrew's and San Salvatore Bastions. It was {{originally}} {{divided into two}} parts, to allow ships to enter the Manderaggio, but the breach was walled up when work on the Manderaggio was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Originally various {{buildings}} were built around <b>the</b> <b>curtain</b> wall. Moving clockwise {{from the entrance}} to the Inner Court, the shape of the 12th-century castle chapel can still be made out on <b>the</b> <b>curtain</b> wall. Convention at the time required a chapel to point along a north-east/south-east axis; in order to achieve this, the chapel had to extend out considerably into the bailey, similar to the design at White Castle. The chapel is adjacent {{to the site of the}} first stone hall in the castle, built around 1160; in the 16th and 17th centuries the chapel tower was probably also used as a cannon emplacement.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>curtains</b> {{and roses}} {{featured}} in the upper corners of the altarpiece are very significant as well. <b>The</b> drawn <b>curtains</b> are pulled back beyond {{the sides of the}} frame, literally unveiling what is hidden behind. But because <b>the</b> <b>curtains</b> are not fully drawn, one can speculate that this fictive image of heaven is not one to be taken for granted because at any moment, <b>the</b> <b>curtains</b> may close. Similarly, the pendulous garlands of white, pink, and red roses emphasize the delicate, transitory scene. Just as flowers die without water, so too may the scene disappear if not appreciated enough.|$|R
60|$|I {{went into}} my room and drew <b>the</b> <b>curtains,</b> {{but there was little}} to notice. My window opened into the courtyard, all I could see was the warm grey of {{quickening}} sky. So I pulled <b>the</b> <b>curtains</b> again, and have written of this day.|$|R

5|$|St. John and Notre Dame Bastions {{are located}} along the landward {{side of the}} fort. Each bastion is {{protected}} by a low cavalier. <b>The</b> <b>curtain</b> wall between the two bastions is further protected by a pentagonal ravelin, which is largely rock hewn.|$|E

5|$|There {{are three}} {{identifiable}} periods of medieval activity at Buckton Castle: the initial construction phase, {{which resulted in}} the creation of the ditch and the building of <b>the</b> <b>curtain</b> wall and gatehouse; the re-cutting of the ditch and further building work behind <b>the</b> <b>curtain</b> wall; and finally deliberate demolition (slighting). The castle is first mentioned in 1360, and little datable material has been recovered from the site four sherds of Pennine Gritty Ware broadly dated to the late 12th century.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, under Ashcroft, {{curtains}} {{were installed}} blocking the Spirit of Justice statue in the Robert F.

5|$|A quadrangular castle, Bodiam {{is roughly}} square-shaped. This type of castle, {{with a central}} {{courtyard}} and buildings against <b>the</b> <b>curtain</b> wall, was characteristic of castle architecture in the 14th century. Bodiam Castle {{has been described by}} military historian Cathcart King as the most complete surviving example of a quadrangular castle. There are circular towers at each of the four corners, with square central towers in the south, east, and west walls. The main entrance is a twin-towered gatehouse in the north face of the castle. There is a second entrance from the south; the postern gate is through a square tower {{in the middle of the}} south wall. The towers are three storeys high, taller than <b>the</b> <b>curtain</b> walls and the buildings in the castle which are two storeys high.|$|E
5|$|At last, on Monday, 28 June 1841 <b>the</b> <b>curtain</b> rose on Giselle at the Salle Le Peletier. Grisi danced Giselle with Lucien Petipa as {{her lover}} Albrecht, Jean Coralli as the {{gamekeeper}} Hilarion, and Adèle Dumilâtre as Myrtha, the Queen of the Wilis. Typical of the theatrical {{practices of the}} time, Giselle was preceded by an excerpt from another production—in this case, the third act of Rossini's opera, Mosè in Egitto.|$|E
5|$|At the end, Peter lets us {{know that}} {{everyone}} at Family Guy respects all living beings and assures the viewers that no animals were harmed {{in the making of}} the episode, but they did hurt the feelings of an Italian opera singer by prematurely dropping <b>the</b> <b>curtain</b> on his performance.|$|E

5|$|In the 21st century, Launceston {{is owned}} by the duchy of Cornwall and {{operated}} by English Heritage as a tourist attraction. Much of the castle defences remain, including the motte, keep and high tower which overlook the castle's former deer park to the south. The gatehouses and some of <b>the</b> <b>curtain</b> wall have survived, and archaeologists have uncovered the foundations of various buildings in the bailey, including the great hall.|$|E

The ruined tower and fragments of <b>the</b> <b>curtain</b> wall still survive on top of the ringwork's earthwork defences, which now resemble a motte, or mound, and are part of the Loughor Castle Park.|$|E
5|$|Just before 8 o'clock I saw Henry Wood take up his {{position}} behind <b>the</b> <b>curtain</b> {{at the end}} of the platform – watch in hand.

A few moments for the audience to settle down, then the Rienzi Overture, and the first concert of the new Promenades had begun.|$|E

5|$|The {{pectoral}} fin disc of the porcupine ray is evenly oval, almost {{as wide as}} long, and very thick at the center, giving it a domed appearance. The {{tip of the snout}} is rounded and barely protruding. The small eyes are closely followed by much larger spiracles. Between the narrow nostrils is a skirt-shaped curtain of skin; the posterior margin of <b>the</b> <b>curtain</b> is strongly fringed and overhangs the mouth. The mouth bears 3–5 papillae on the floor and prominent furrows at the corners. The area around the mouth, including <b>the</b> <b>curtain,</b> are heavily covered by more papillae. There are around 48 tooth rows in either jaw. The teeth are small and flattened. Five pairs of gill slits are located {{on the underside of the}} disc.|$|E
