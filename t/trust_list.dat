40|$|The goal of federated {{identity}} management {{is to allow}} principals, such as identities and attributes, to be shared across trust boundaries based on established policies. Since current Single Sign-On (SSO) mechanism excessively relies on the specifications of Circle of Trust (CoT), the need for service collaboration from different domains is being addressed on CoT. For the motivating issue of the cross-domain SSO mechanism, we need an emergent dynamic <b>trust</b> <b>list</b> for calculating the trust parties, thus, the CoT specifications require an initial effort on enrolling members automatically {{to adapt to the}} dynamic open environment. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Trust Policy Language to support trust negotiation. The formal syntax of this language is presented in Backus Naur Form (BNF) based on the concept of role membership. We also systematically develop the Dynamic Trust Model (DTM) to allow Untrusted SP to join the existing CoT by trust negotiation. Finally, we identify the process and algorithm for communication between negotiation entities...|$|E

40|$|Wireless sensor {{networks}} (WSNs) {{are composed}} {{of a large number}} of tiny sensor nodes that are self-organized through wireless communication. It aims to perceive, collect, and process information from network coverage areas. The open nature of WSNs makes them easily exposed to a variety of attacks and brings many security challenges. Furthermore, because of the limited resources, some nodes may refuse to forward packets by dropping them to save their resources such as battery, cache, and bandwidth. To resist the attacks from these selfish nodes and to punish them, we propose a fuzzy-based dynamic trust model in this paper. The model uses fuzzy sets combining with grey theory to evaluate every node's trust credibility based on direct trust and indirect trust relationship. Only those with higher trust values can be chosen to forward packets. Those untrustworthy nodes with lower trust values will be detected and excluded from the <b>trust</b> <b>list.</b> Thus, our proposal also produces an incentive to compel the selfish nodes to wellbehave again to participate in the WSN again. Additionally, we introduce the time slice scheme to guarantee a reliable node possess enough time to enjoy its services, which can solve the problem that a suddenly interrupted link causes a significant decrease of the trust value. Simulation results show that our dynamic trust model can not only demonstrate the effectiveness in detecting selfish nodes, but also possess better performance even if the bursty traffic exists.
