5|$|In Taiwan, {{the threat}} of Fanapi forced the closure of rail lines and {{cancellation}} of flights from Kaohsiung International Airport, and at least 156flights were canceled. The storm caused the Kaohsiung seaport in southern <b>Taiwan</b> <b>to</b> close, thus delaying shipments from nearby chemical plants. Many boats rode out the storm at port. Portions of the Kaohsiung Mass Rapid Transit system suspended their service, and the Maokong Gondola was shut down during the storm.|$|E

5|$|Black drongos were {{introduced}} {{just before the}} Second World War from <b>Taiwan</b> <b>to</b> the island of Rota {{to help in the}} control of insects. It is believed that they dispersed over the sea to the island of Guam in the 1950s. By 1967, they were the fourth most commonly seen birds in roadside counts on Guam and are today the most abundant bird there. Predation by and competition from black drongos have been suggested as factors in the decline of endemic bird species such as the Rota bridled white-eye and the Guam flycatcher.|$|E

5|$|Ethnic Malays {{which make}} up the {{majority}} population of Malaysia at 50.4%, are an ethnic group of Austronesian people predominantly inhabiting the Malay Peninsula, including the southernmost parts of Thailand, {{the east coast of}} Sumatra, the coast of Borneo, and the smaller islands which lie between these locations. The true origin of ethnic Malays is still the subject of studies among historians, anthropologists and linguists. A popular theory suggested that the people who spoke Austronesian languages first arrived in Maritime Southeast Asia between 2,500BCE and 1,500BCE, as a part of Austronesian expansion from <b>Taiwan</b> <b>to</b> South East Asia.|$|E
5|$|For centuries, Taiwan's {{aboriginal}} inhabitants experienced economic {{competition and}} military conflict {{with a series}} of colonising newcomers. Centralised government policies designed to foster language shift and cultural assimilation, as well as continued contact with the colonisers through trade, intermarriage and other intercultural processes, have resulted in varying degrees of language death and loss of original cultural identity. For example, of the approximately 26 known languages of the Taiwanese aborigines (collectively referred to as the Formosan languages), at least ten are now extinct, five are moribund and several are to some degree endangered. These languages are of unique historical significance, since most historical linguists consider <b>Taiwan</b> <b>to</b> be the original homeland of the Austronesian language family.|$|E
5|$|In September–October 1940, {{the ship}} was based at Hainan Island to support the Japanese {{invasion}} of French Indochina. In February 1941, Sōryū moved to <b>Taiwan</b> <b>to</b> reinforce the blockade of southern China. Two months later, the 2nd Carrier Division {{was assigned to the}} First Air Fleet, or Kido Butai, on 10 April. Sōryū's air group was detached in mid-July and transferred to Hainan Island to support the occupation of southern Indochina. Sōryū returned to Japan on 7 August and became flagship of the 2nd Division. She was relieved of that role on 22 September as she began a short refit that was completed on 24 October. The ship arrived at Kagoshima two days later and she resumed her former role as flagship of the Division.|$|E

5|$|The {{standard}} EVA Air livery utilizes dark green, signifying durability, and orange, representing technological innovation. The tail globe logo {{is intended}} to represent stability and reliability, and its positioning on the tail, with one corner off the edge, represents service innovation. The EVA Air livery was updated in 2002, adding a larger typeface {{and the use of}} green covering the aircraft below the window line. The tail design and logo remained unchanged. In late 2015, EVA Air redesigned their livery and tail logo, using the dark green color on the belly, and cancelled the orange line {{on the edge of the}} tail to highlight the corporate identity. It's the third generation livery of EVA Air, symbolizing their ambition to connect <b>Taiwan</b> <b>to</b> the world.|$|E
5|$|The {{story is}} told {{in the form of}} a series of {{interviews}} conducted by the narrator, Max Brooks, an agent of the United Nations Postwar Commission. Although the exact origin of the plague is unknown, a young boy from a village in China is identified as the plague's official patient zero. The boy's case marks the point where the Chinese government begins to take measures to cover up the disease, including generating a crisis with <b>Taiwan</b> <b>to</b> mask their activities. Nevertheless, the plague still manages to spread to various nations by human trafficking, refugees and the black market organ trade. Initially, these nations were able to cover up their smaller outbreaks, until a much larger outbreak in South Africa brings the plague to public attention.|$|E

50|$|This treaty also {{introduced}} {{the problem of}} the legal status of <b>Taiwan</b> due <b>to</b> its lack of specificity as <b>to</b> what country <b>Taiwan</b> was <b>to</b> be surrendered, and hence some supporters of Taiwan independence argue that sovereignty of Taiwan is really still undetermined.|$|R
5|$|In 1842 the Treaty of Nanking was concluded, which {{included}} among its provisions {{the creation of}} treaty ports in which Christian missionaries {{would be free to}} preach. Xiamen (then known as Amoy) was one of these treaty ports, and British, Canadian and American missionaries moved in to start preaching to the local inhabitants. These missionaries, housed in the cantonment of Gulangyu, created reference works and religious tracts, including a bible translation. Naturally, they based the pronunciation of their romanization on the speech of Xiamen, which became the de facto standard when they eventually moved into other areas of the Hokkien Sprachraum, most notably Taiwan. The 1858 Treaty of Tianjin officially opened <b>Taiwan</b> <b>to</b> western missionaries, and missionary societies were quick to send men to work in the field, usually after a sojourn in Xiamen to acquire the rudiments of the language.|$|E
5|$|In February 1959 Agagianian visited <b>Taiwan</b> <b>to</b> oversee {{missionary work}} in the island. He later {{entrusted}} Paul Yü Pin, Archbishop of Nanking, to reestablish the Fu Jen Catholic University. He arrived in Japan for a two week long visit in May 1959, which included a meeting with Emperor Hirohito. On December 10, 1959 he presided over the First Far East Conference of Bishops at the University of Santo Tomas in Manila, Philippines with attendance of 100 prelates, 10 papal representatives, 16 archbishops, 79 bishops from almost {{every country in the}} Far East. His visit to the Republic of Ireland in June 1961 was the highlight of the Patrician Year. Agagianian received a great popular welcome there. Conservative President of Ireland Éamon de Valera was famously pictured kissing Agagianian's ring. In September 1963 he visited South Vietnam and met with Madame Nhu, the Catholic first lady. On October 18, 1964 when the Uganda Martyrs where canonized by Pope Paul VI, Agagianian presided over the Holy Mass at Namugongo. In November 1964 he traveled to Bombay, India to open the 38th Eucharistic Congress.|$|E

5|$|The {{originally}} proposed route {{would have}} taken the torch through Taipei after leaving Vietnam and before heading for Hong Kong. However, the government of Taiwan (then led by the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party) objected to this proposal, claiming that this route would make {{the portion of the}} relay in Taiwan appear {{to be part of the}} torch's domestic journey through China, rather than a leg on the international route. This dispute, as well as Chinese demands that the flag and the national anthem of the Republic of China be banned along the route led the government of <b>Taiwan</b> <b>to</b> reject the proposal that it be part of the relay route, and the two sides of the Taiwan Strait subsequently blamed each other for injecting politics into the event.|$|E
5|$|The {{threat of}} the storm {{prompted}} officials in <b>Taiwan</b> <b>to</b> issue sea warnings for the island's southern coast, causing ferry service to two offshore islands to be canceled. A hot air balloon festival was canceled in Taitung City. On July8, the HKO issued a Standby Signal #1 for Hong Kong due to the increased threat from Linfa. On the next day, the agency upgraded it to a Warning Signal #8, indicating that gale-force winds were expected, although it was dropped in 5.5hours, {{becoming one of the}} shortest-lasting such warning. The local government opened 22shelters, housing 196people during the storm. The storm caused the Hong Kong International Airport to close, causing 1,020flights to be canceled. The China Meteorological Administration also issued 14warnings for the Chinese mainland, advising residents on the {{threat of the}} storm. Schools were closed in Guangdong due to the storm, while train service was canceled and 10,400boats returned to port. The Chinese government handled the preparations for Linfa at the same time Typhoon Chan-hom was threatening the country's east coast.|$|E
