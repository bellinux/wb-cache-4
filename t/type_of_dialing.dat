50|$|Prior to the {{development}} of DTMF, telephone numbers were dialed by users with a loop-disconnect (LD) signaling, more commonly known as pulse dialing (dial pulse, DP) in the U.S. It functions by interrupting the current in the local loop between the telephone exchange and the calling party's telephone at a precise rate with a switch in the telephone that is operated by the rotary dial as it spins back to its rest position after having been rotated to each desired number. The exchange equipment responds to the dial pulses either directly by operating relays, or by storing the number in a digit register recording the dialed number. The physical distance for which this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>dialing</b> was possible was restricted by electrical distortions and was only possible on direct metallic links between end points of a line. Placing calls over longer distances required either operator assistance or provision of special subscriber trunk dialing equipment. Operators used an earlier type of multi-frequency signaling.|$|E

5000|$|Unlike {{the simpler}} {{vertical}} declining sundial, this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>dial</b> {{does not always}} show hour angles on its sunside face for all declinations between east and west. When a northern hemisphere partly south-facing dial reclines back (i.e. away from the sun) from the vertical, the gnomon will become co-planar with the dial plate at declinations less than due east or due west. Likewise for southern hemisphere dials that are partly north-facing.Were these dials reclining forward, the range of declination would actually exceed due east and due west.In a similar way, northern hemisphere dials that are partly north-facing and southern hemisphere dials that are south-facing, and which lean forward toward their upward pointing gnomons, will have a similar restriction on the range of declination that is possible for a given reclination value.The critical declination [...] is a geometrical constraint which depends on the value <b>of</b> both the <b>dial's</b> reclination and its latitude : ...|$|R

40|$|A new <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>DIAL</b> {{system for}} the {{detection}} of methane in the atmosphere is being developed. The main feature of this lidar is the use of a gas correlation technique to obtain the reference signal by means of a single laser pulse, instead of two shots at different wavelengths. This fact is useful to make measurements on fast moving platforms. To meet the infrared absorption band of methane an optical parametric oscillator (OPO) was used with a LiNbO 3 crystal as active element, and a tuning range between 1. 5 divided by 4 microns. As known, the major problem to overcome in parametric oscillators are the pump beam quality and the difficulty in reducing the linewidth. The first requirement is met by using, as a pump, a Nd-YAG laser based on a new <b>type</b> <b>of</b> resonator cavity, named SFUR (Self Filtering Unstable Resonator). The laser emits, with high efficiency, near diffraction limited pulsed beams of about 250 mJ of energy, 20 ns of duration at 10 pps of frequency repetition rate. On the other hand, the gas correlation technique allows the operation with a bandwidth as large as 1 /cm, which is obtainable using only a diffraction grating as a dispersive element in the OPO cavity...|$|R
5000|$|The art of sundial {{design is}} to produce a dial that {{accurately}} displays local time. Sundial designers have also been fascinated by the mathematics <b>of</b> the <b>dial</b> and possible new ways of displaying the information. Modern dialling started in the tenth century when Arab astronomers made the great discovery that a gnomon parallel to the earths axis will produce sundials whose hour lines show equal hours or legal hours on {{any day of the}} year: the <b>dial</b> <b>of</b> Ibn al-Shatir in the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus is the oldest <b>dial</b> <b>of</b> this <b>type.</b> [...] <b>Dials</b> <b>of</b> this <b>type</b> appeared in Austria and Germany in the 1440s.|$|R
50|$|The 1A2 {{system used}} a modular plug-in {{construction}} concept that permitted many configurations {{using the same}} basic components. A typical system consisted of a basic metal mounting frame, the Key Service Unit (KSU), also called a panel, with card-edge connectors and mounting brackets for components and punch-down blocks for interconnecting cabling. The principal switching and control modules were constructed on printed circuit boards, called Key Telephone Units (KTU). KTUs provided many system features, such as various <b>types</b> <b>of</b> line interfaces, <b>dial</b> intercom, music-on-hold, and alarms. Each central office telephone line connected to the system required at least one KTU.|$|R
50|$|The chief {{advantages}} of the horizontal sundial are that {{it is easy to}} read, and the sun lights the face throughout the year. All the hour-lines intersect {{at the point where the}} gnomon's style crosses the horizontal plane. Since the style is aligned with the Earth's rotational axis, the style points true North and its angle with the horizontal equals the sundial's geographical latitude L. A sundial designed for one latitude can be adjusted for use at another latitude by tilting its base upwards or downwards by an angle equal to the difference in latitude. For example, a sundial designed for a latitude of 40° can be used at a latitude of 45°, if the sundial plane is tilted upwards by 5°, thus aligning the style with the Earth's rotational axis. Many ornamental sundials are designed to be used at 45 degrees north. Some mass-produced garden sundials fail to correctly calculate the hourlines and so can never be corrected. A local standard time zone is nominally 15 degrees wide, but may be modified to follow geographic or political boundaries. A sundial can be rotated around its style (which must remain pointed at the celestial pole) to adjust to the local time zone. In most cases, a rotation in the range of 7.5 degrees east to 23 degrees west suffices. This will introduce error in sundials that do not have equal hour angles. To correct for daylight saving time, a face needs two sets of numerals or a correction table. An informal standard is to have numerals in hot colors for summer, and in cool colors for winter. Since the hour angles are not evenly spaced, the equation of time corrections cannot be made via rotating the dial plate about the gnomon axis. These <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>dials</b> usually have an equation of time correction tabulation engraved on their pedestals or close by.Horizontal dials are commonly seen in gardens, churchyards and in public areas.|$|R
