5|$|The {{plan was}} straightforward: Vandamme and Saint Cyr {{would make a}} {{simultaneous}} attack on the Austrian right, and Soult's and Jourdan's main force would attack the Austrian center and left. Jourdan's plan, to attack four points of the opposition simultaneously, seemed <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> be the only reasonable action against a force with such numerical superiority.|$|E
5|$|According to Skeat {{the note}} in the codex {{indicated}} that the manuscript had not previously been in the Patriarchal Library in Alexandria. The manuscript was carried from Constantinople to Alexandria between 1308 and 1316, together with two mentioned above manuscripts of Chrysostom. It remained in Alexandria until 1621, when Cyril removed it once to Constantinople. Whether was originally written, in Constantinople or in Alexandria, is another question. Skeat {{did not try to}} give the answer on this question ("if any future scholar wisches to claim a Constantinopolitan origin for the Codex Alexandrinus, it is at least open <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> do so"). This view was supported by McKendrick, who proposes Ephesian provenance of the codex.|$|E

5|$|Baker, de Francisci, and Moore met in Washington on December 15. At that time, Baker, who {{hoped to}} start Peace dollar {{production}} in 1921, outlined the tight schedule {{for this to}} be accomplished, and requested certain design changes. Among these was the inclusion of the broken sword from the sculptor's alternate reverse design, to be placed under the eagle, on the mountaintop on which it stands, in addition to the olive branch. Baker approved the designs, subject to these changes. The revised designs were presented to President Harding on December 19. Harding insisted on the removal of a small feature of Liberty's face, which seemed <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> suggest a dimple, something he did not consider suggestive of peace, and the sculptor then did so.|$|E
5|$|Boone offers Bryan $25,000 {{to break}} up with Shannon but Bryan asks for $50,000 and Boone agrees. Boone also reveals that Bryan {{is not the first}} man he has paid off to leave Shannon alone. Shannon refuses to leave with Boone. He realizes that Shannon lied <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> get the money, and she has done this all the other times he had to pay off her boyfriends. Bryan says that Boone's mother stole money away from her, and she is getting what is {{rightfully}} hers. After a brief fight with Bryan in which he is beaten, Boone leaves. That night, a drunk Shannon comes to Boone's hotel room and tells him that Bryan stole the money. She tells Boone that she knows he loves her and, although he first tries to refuse her advances, they sleep together. Later, Shannon persuades Boone not to tell their parents.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of the fall of Constantinople, the only {{remaining}} territory of the Byzantine Empire was the Despotate of the Morea (Peloponnese), which was ruled by brothers of the last Emperor, Thomas Palaiologos and Demetrios Palaiologos. The Despotate continued on as an independent state by paying an annual tribute to the Ottomans. Incompetent rule, failure to pay the annual tribute and a revolt against the Ottomans finally led to Mehmed II's invasion of Morea in May 1460. Demetrios asked the Ottomans to invade and drive Thomas out. Thomas fled. The Ottomans moved through the Morea and conquered virtually the entire Despotate by the summer. Demetrios thought the Morea would be restored <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> rule, but it was incorporated into the Ottoman fold.|$|E

5|$|Fearing {{that the}} Exclusion Bill would be passed, and bolstered by some acquittals in the {{continuing}} Plot trials, which seemed <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> indicate a more favourable public mood towards Catholicism, Charles dissolved the English Parliament, {{for a second time}} that year, in mid-1679. Charles's hopes for a more moderate Parliament were not fulfilled; within a few months he had dissolved Parliament yet again, after it sought to pass the Exclusion Bill. When a new Parliament assembled at Oxford in March 1681, Charles dissolved it for a fourth time after just a few days. During the 1680s, however, popular support for the Exclusion Bill ebbed, and Charles experienced a nationwide surge of loyalty. Lord Shaftesbury was prosecuted (albeit unsuccessfully) for treason in 1681 and later fled to Holland, where he died. For the remainder of his reign, Charles ruled without Parliament.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{introduction}} of rugby-style rules to American football, Camp became a fixture at the Massasoit House conventions where rules were debated and changed. Dissatisfied with what seemed <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> be a disorganized mob, he proposed his first rule change at the first meeting he attended in 1878: a reduction from fifteen players to eleven. The motion was rejected at that time but passed in 1880. The effect was {{to open up the}} game and emphasize speed over strength. Camp's most famous change, the establishment of the line of scrimmage and the snap from center to quarterback, was also passed in 1880. Originally, the snap was executed with the foot of the center. Later changes made it possible to snap the ball with the hands, either through the air or by a direct hand-to-hand pass.|$|E
5|$|Having {{resigned}} the Bishopric of Chiapas, Las Casas {{spent the}} rest of his life working closely with the imperial court in matters relating to the Indies. In 1551 he rented a cell at the College of San Gregorio, where he lived with his assistant and friend Fray Rodrigo de Ladrada. He continued working as a kind of procurator for the natives of the Indies, many of whom directed petitions <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> speak to the Emperor on their behalf. Sometimes indigenous nobility even related their cases to him in Spain, for example, the Nahua noble Francisco Tenamaztle from Nochistlán. His influence at court was so great that some even considered that he had the final word in choosing the members of the Council of the Indies.|$|E

5|$|In 1831, Wagner {{enrolled}} at the Leipzig University, where he {{became a member of}} the Saxon student fraternity. He took composition lessons with the Thomaskantor Theodor Weinlig. Weinlig was so impressed with Wagner's musical ability that he refused any payment for his lessons. He arranged for his pupil's Piano Sonata in B-flat major (which was consequently dedicated <b>to</b> <b>him)</b> <b>to</b> be published as Wagner's Op. 1. A year later, Wagner composed his Symphony in C major, a Beethovenesque work performed in Prague in 1832 and at the Leipzig Gewandhaus in 1833. He then began to work on an opera, Die Hochzeit (The Wedding), which he never completed.|$|E
5|$|On 16 May, tens of {{thousands}} of university students demanding Suharto’s resignation, occupied the grounds and roof of the parliament building. Upon Suharto's return to Jakarta, he offered to resign in 2003 and to reshuffle his cabinet. These efforts failed when his political allies deserted him by refusing to join the proposed new cabinet. According to Wiranto, on 18 May, Suharto issued a decree which provided authority <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> take any measures to restore security; however, Wiranto decided not to enforce the decree to prevent conflict with the population. On 21 May 1998, Suharto announced his resignation, upon which vice-president Habibie assumed the presidency in accordance with the constitution.|$|E

In the meantime, however, the Poles had invaded Moldavia and replaced Ştefan Răzvan by Ieremia Movilă (15951606).

5|$|Pyrrhus' {{advance on}} Argos {{did not go}} {{smoothly}} as his army was constantly harassed by vengeful Spartan troops led by Areus. By setting up ambushes and occupying strategic positions along the Epiriote line of retreat, the Spartans were able to inflict heavy casualties on Pyrrhus' rearguard of Gauls and Molossians. In an attempt to restore the wavering morale of his rear, Pyrrhus sent Ptolemy to assume its command. Pyrrhus hoped {{that the presence of}} his son amongst the troops would stiffen their resolve and enable <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> extricate the remainder of his troops from the narrow pass through which they were passing. Ptolemy's position was attacked by a picked Spartan war band under the command of Evaclus. In the ensuing struggle, Ptolemy was slain by the Spartans causing his remaining troops to rout. The victorious Spartans pursued the fleeing Epiriote rearguard until they were checked by some Epiriote infantry.|$|E

A kneeling woman clutches the waist of the victorious soldier, raising her face <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> beg him to spare his defeated foe. The defeated warrior has a stronger body, a face more in keeping with the conventions of attractiveness at the time, and a more sympathetic expression, while the victorious man is darker skinned and has an expression of blank fierceness. The vanquished soldier's sword has broken, and lies beside him on the ground.|$|E

Any suggestion of its withdrawal back to the river Rhine to obtain a better fighting position - given the Third Reich's weakening strength against the Allied torrent of men and material - was forbidden, and it was ordered to conduct its actions from now on upon the strategic basis of not yielding an inch of ground and an abandonment of tactical manoeuvre.|$|E
