The two gradually become tired and hungry, so SpongeBob suggests they eat coral like <b>the</b> <b>pioneers.</b> Squidward immediately spits out the coral, disgusted by the taste, and demands SpongeBob hand over the pizza so he can eat it, having finally given up hope on getting back to civilization. SpongeBob refuses and a short chase ensues between the two. Just as Squidward is about to grab the pizza, SpongeBob notices a giant rock that he claims <b>the</b> <b>pioneers</b> drove for miles.
