5|$|In 1080°s two <b>trick</b> modes, <b>trick</b> {{attack and}} contest, players accrue points from {{completed}} tricks. In contest mode, players perform tricks and snowboard past flags for points. <b>Trick</b> attack mode requires players {{to perform a}} series of tricks throughout a designated level. The game features 25 tricks, {{all of which are}} performed by using a combination of circular positions of the control stick, the R button, and the B button; point values are allocated based on complexity and required time. The two types of tricks are grab tricks, in which the board is grabbed in a specific way, or spin tricks, in which the snowboarder spins the board a certain number of degrees. The 1080° spin requires nine actions, the most of any <b>trick</b> in the game.|$|E
5|$|The {{first player}} chooses a card to play. If the second player has {{one or more}} cards of higher value of the same suit as this card, one of them must be played, and the second player wins the <b>trick.</b> If the second player has cards of the same suit, but only ones of less value than the first card, one of these must be played; in this case, the second player loses the <b>trick.</b> If the second player {{does not have any}} cards of the same suit but has one or more trump cards, one of these must be played; the second player wins the <b>trick.</b> If the second player has no cards of the same suit and no trumps, any other card can be played, and the second player loses the <b>trick.</b>|$|E

40|$|Sensory <b>tricks</b> {{are various}} {{manoeuvres}} that can ameliorate dystonia. Common characteristics are well known, but their variety is wide, sensory stimulation {{is not necessarily}} the critical feature, and their physiology is unknown. To enumerate the various forms of sensory <b>tricks</b> and describe their nature, research findings and theories that may elucidate their neurophysiologic mechanism, we reviewed the literature pertaining to sensory <b>tricks,</b> including variants like motor <b>tricks,</b> imaginary <b>tricks,</b> forcible <b>tricks</b> and reverse sensory <b>tricks.</b> On the basis of this information, we propose a new classification of sensory <b>tricks</b> to include its variants. We highlight neurophysiologic evidence suggesting that sensory <b>tricks</b> work by decreasing abnormal facilitation. We tie this with established dystonia pathogenesis and postulate that sensory <b>tricks</b> decrease abnormally increased facilitation to inhibition ratios in the dystonic brain. It appears worthwhile for patients to search for possible sensory <b>tricks...</b>|$|R
50|$|Examples: Suppose you bid 3 <b>tricks.</b> If {{you take}} exactly 3 you will win 8 points (5+3).

5000|$|Unbalanced {{hands are}} divided in 3 groups: one-suited, two-suited and three-suited hands.three-suited hands are {{evaluated}} counting HCP and distributional points, DP. The distributional points show {{the potential of}} the hand to take low-card <b>tricks</b> including long-suit <b>tricks</b> or short-suit <b>tricks</b> (ruffing <b>tricks).</b> Opener's DP count are less valuable as responders because usually trumping in the long side does not add <b>tricks</b> to the total number of <b>tricks.</b> Distributional hand values ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{player can}} perform many {{different}} <b>tricks</b> from grinds, lips, air <b>tricks</b> and manuals. Performing <b>tricks</b> fills the adrenaline bar up.

5000|$|Power <b>tricks</b> {{encompass}} {{a specific}} type of advanced <b>tricks</b> and short combos. The definition of what qualifies as a [...] "power trick" [...] varies between different pen spinners, but they are usually said to be fingerless, aerial, and/or continuous in nature, thus greatly reliant on the momentum of the pen. French spinners often define power <b>tricks</b> as many difficult <b>tricks</b> linked together. Many power <b>tricks</b> are simply Continuous Fingerless Arounds or a Spin followed by a Fingerless Around. The use of power <b>tricks</b> in combos varies between spinners, but often times power <b>tricks</b> are used {{at the end of the}} combo as a [...] "finisher." [...] The term [...] "power tricker" [...] is applied to a spinner who uses power <b>tricks</b> very often and perhaps creates combos composed entirely of power <b>tricks</b> ("power combos"). Pen spinner SpinnerpeeM greatly popularized the use of power <b>tricks</b> in combos and is said to be one of the first power trickers.|$|R

5|$|Like its {{predecessors}} in the Tony Hawk's series, Underground {{is centered on}} skateboarding {{in a series of}} levels. The player performs tricks via combinations of analog stick and button inputs. For example, the player initiates an ollie (a jump <b>trick)</b> by holding and releasing the jump button. During an ollie, the player may change the position of the analog stick and press one of two buttons to perform either a flip <b>trick</b> (such as an impossible or kickflip) or a grab <b>trick</b> (such as a benihana or nosegrab). The player can grind on certain edges and rails; different tricks may be performed during a grind based on the position of the analog stick. On quarter pipes, the player may execute lip tricks. While skating on flat surfaces, the player may manual in multiple ways via button combinations. Miscellaneous tricks include acid drops and wall-rides.|$|E
50|$|Each player bids {{the amount}} of <b>tricks</b> {{he or she will}} win. If a player wins exactly that amount of <b>tricks</b> he/she will receive double the points as well as an {{additional}} 10 points for making a contract. This encourages higher calling and less calls for winning zero <b>tricks.</b> For example, I bid that I will win 2 <b>tricks.</b> I win those 2 <b>tricks</b> exactly therefore receive 4 points (2 <b>tricks</b> x 2) + 10 points additional therefore I get 14 points.|$|R
