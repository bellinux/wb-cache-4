40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposed}} an intelligent wireless indoor monitoring {{system based on}} STM 32 F 103. The system compromises a master and terminals, which communicates through a CC 1101 433 M wireless unit. Using ENC 28 J 60 and SIM 900 A to access Ethernet, the system can intelligent push information to cloud server, therefore we can observe and control terminals remotely. This paper present an algorithm based on MCU ID for <b>terminal</b> <b>code</b> recognition. The algorithm can intelligently discriminate terminals through code matching code between master and terminals, though hardware and software of terminals is similar. The experiment demonstrates that the proposed system is robust stability, real-time and obtains accurate warning information...|$|E
40|$|The speedup {{associated}} with software to FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) synthesization shows great improvement over pure processed software applications. The integration of software and FPGA microprocessor driven applications offers great possibilities. One problem with using pure FPGA driven applications {{is that the}} large source base may require more space than available on present FPGAs. In addition, {{the time required to}} program the FPGA based application is much greater than the time required to program an identical processed software implementation of the same application. In this paper we evaluate the speedup that may be achieved by profiling an existing software implementation of the JPEG 2000 still image compression algorithm and simulating replacements of <b>terminal</b> <b>code</b> in high frequency use source code execution paths with FPGA microprocessor implementations generated by ROCCC (Riverside Optimizing Compiler for Configurable Computing). In order to convert the high level software implementation to an FPGA based architecture, we use ROCCC. Our goal is to extract and convert the frequent execution paths in source code to FPGA leveraging parallelization and optimization, increasing overall performance, exploiting the unique properties of FPGAs. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{influenza}} A {{virus genome}} comprises eight single-stranded negative-sense RNA segments (vRNAs). All eight vRNAs are selec-tively packaged into each progeny virion via so-called segment-specific genome-packaging signal sequences that {{are located in}} the noncoding and <b>terminal</b> <b>coding</b> regions of both the 3 = and the 5 = ends of the vRNAs. However, it remains unclear how these signals ensure that eight different vRNAs are packaged. Here, by using a reverse genetics system, we demonstrated that, {{in the absence of the}} other seven vRNAs, a recombinant NP vRNA bearing only a reporter gene flanked by the noncoding NP regions was incorporated into virus-like particles (VLPs) as efficiently as a recombinant NP vRNA bearing the reporter gene flanked by the complete NP packaging signals (i. e., the noncoding sequences and the <b>terminal</b> <b>coding</b> regions). Viruses that comprised a recombinant NP vRNAwhose packaging signal was disrupted, and the remaining seven authentic vRNAs, did not undergo mul-tiple cycles of replication; however, a recombinant NP vRNAwith only the noncoding regions was readily incorporated into VLPs, suggesting that the packaging signal as currently defined is not necessarily essential for the packaging of the vRNA in which it resides; rather, it is required for the packaging of the full set of vRNAs. We propose that the 3 = and 5 = noncoding regions of each vRNA bear a virion incorporation signal for that vRNA and that the <b>terminal</b> <b>coding</b> regions serve as a bundling signal that ensures the incorporation of the complete set of eight vRNAs into the virion. The genome of influenza A virus is segmented into eight single-stranded negative-sense RNAs. While this genome segmenta-tion provides influenza viruses with a considerable evolutionar...|$|R

40|$|Teaching of {{knowledge}} and competence in documentation and coding {{is an essential part}} of medical education. Therefore, coding training had been placed within the course of epidemiology, medical biometry, and medical informatics. From this, we can draw conclusions about the quality of coding by novices. One hundred and eighteen students coded diagnoses from 15 nephrological cases in homework. In addition to interrater reliability, validity was calculated by comparison with a reference coding. On the level of <b>terminal</b> <b>codes,</b> 59. 3 % of the students' results were correct. The completeness was calculated as 58. 0 %. The results on the chapter level increased up to 91. 5 % and 87. 7 % respectively. For the calculation of reliability a new, simple measure was developed that leads to values of 0. 46 on the level of <b>terminal</b> <b>codes</b> and 0. 87 on the chapter level for interrater reliability. The figures of concordance with the reference coding are quite similar. In contrary, routine data show considerably lower results with 0. 34 and 0. 63 respectively. Interrater reliability and validity of coding by novices is as good as coding by experts. The missing advantage of experts could be explained by the workload of documentation and a negative attitude to coding on the one hand. On the other hand, coding in a DRG-system is handicapped by a large number of detailed coding rules, which do not end in uniform results but rather lead to wrong and random codes. Anyway, students left the course well prepared for coding...|$|R

40|$|Influenza A virus vRNA {{segments}} contain specific packaging signals {{at their}} termini that overlap the coding regions.

Most mutations tested were well-tolerated, but a virus with alterations to NP codons 464 - 466, near the 5 ′-end of the vRNA, produced small plaques and replicated to around one-tenth {{of the level of}} wild type virus. The mutant virus supported normal levels of NP and segment 5 vRNA synthesis but packaged reduced levels of both segment 5 and segment 3 into virus particles.

40|$|Coding {{junction}} {{formation in}} V(D) J recombination generates {{diversity in the}} antigen recognition structures of immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor molecules by combining processes of deletion of <b>terminal</b> <b>coding</b> sequences and addition of nucleotides prior to joining.

We found that coding junctions formed efficiently with or without terminal DNA homology. The extent of junctional deletion was conserved independent of coding ends with increased, partial, or no DNA homology. Interestingly, G/C homopolymer coding ends showed reduced deletion regardless of DNA homology. Therefore, DNA homology cannot be the primary determinant that stabilizes coding end structures for processing and joining...|$|R

The RP 59 gene is present as a single copy, contains an intron within the amino <b>terminal</b> <b>coding</b> portion of the gene, and harbors conserved S. cerevisiae splicing signals. Sequence elements upstream of the transcriptional start site are homologous to UASRPG, known to regulate the transcription of numerous genes in S. cerevisiae via their interaction with the trans-activating factor RAP 1. These elements are necessary for transcription of RP 59 in both K. lactis and S. cerevisiae hosts. UASRPG in S. cerevisiae rp genes also modulate the transcription of rp RNA synthesis {{in response to a}} growth rate upshift. In K. lactis, the RP 59 gene does not respond to growth rate upshift. Reciprocal expression of RP 59 and CRY 1 in heterologous hosts demonstrates that glucose upshift occurs in S. cerevisiae but not K. lactis.

25|$|Mutations in the pncA gene of M. tuberculosis, which encodes a pyrazinamidase and {{converts}} pyrazinamide to its active form pyrazinoic acid, {{are responsible}} for the majority of pyrazinamide resistance in M. tuberculosis strains. A few pyrazinamidase resistant strains with mutations in the rpsA gene have also been identified. However, a direct association between these rpsA mutations and pyrazinamide resistance has not been established. It is worth noting that the pyrazinamide resistant M. tuberculosis strain DHMH444 which harbors a mutation in the carboxy <b>terminal</b> <b>coding</b> region of rpsA is fully susceptible to pyrazinoic acid and pyrazinamide resistance of this strain was previously associated with decreased pyrazinamidase activity. Further, this strain was found to be susceptible to pyrazinamide in a mouse model of tuberculosis. Thus, current data indicates that rpsA mutations {{are not likely to be}} associated with pyrazinamide resistance. There are currently three main methods of testing for pyrazinamide resistance: 1) phenotypic tests where a tuberculosis strain is grown in the presence of increasing concentrations of pyrazinamide, 2) measuring levels of pyrazinamidase enzyme produced by the tuberculosis strain, or 3) looking for mutations in the pncA gene of tuberculosis. There have been concerns that the most widely used method for phenotypic resistance testing may overestimate the amount of resistant strains.|$|R

40|$|The CDC 14 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes an {{oligomeric}} dual specificity phosphatase whose {{activity is}} required for mitotic exit. Western blots suggest that Cdc 14 p is present throughout the cell division cycle. The yeast two-hybrid method was employed to identify potential regulators and substrates of Cdc 14 p. A total of 17 potential Cdc 14 p interacting proteins were identified by this method. Two proteins identified by this screen, Net 1 p and Swi 5 p, {{have been identified as}} regulators of mitotic exit. We have characterized Net 1 p in vitro as a Cdc 14 p binding protein. Net 1 p is a potent inhibitor of Cdc 14 p phosphatase activity, with an IC 50 of 1 nM. Mitotic exit is promoted by releasing Cdc 14 p from Net 1 p inhibition. Dephosphorylation of Swi 5 p is a key event that triggers mitotic exit. Phosphorylation of this protein inhibits its ability to activate transcription of SIC 1 —a factor involved in inhibiting Cdc 28 p-Clb activity. Overexpression of Cdc 14 p stimulates SIC 1 transcription. Human homologs of Cdc 14 p have been identified. Transcripts encoding Cdc 14 p homologs undergo alternative splicing within their carboxy <b>terminal</b> <b>coding</b> region which suggests that this region of the protein is critical for the regulation or specificity of the enzyme. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{regulatory}} gene merR, and the adjacent operator/promoter region was amplified from the mercury resistance (Hg(R)) determinants from 10 Gram-negative bacterial isolates from mercury polluted and pristine environments using the polymerase chain reaction. These mer regions showed polymorphism in size of PCR amplification products {{with those from}} isolates SE 3, SE 11, SE 12, SE 31, SO 1 and T 217 being of 557 base pairs in size, whilst those from isolates SE 20, T 238, SB 3, SB 4 and the positive control (Tn 501) were 536 base pairs in size. From the sequence analysis of these mer regions and comparison with previously sequenced Hg(R) determinants an evolutionary tree was constructed which showed {{there to be a}} significant difference between Gram-negative merR genes and those found in Gram-positive organisms. With the exception of the Thiobacillus Hg(R) determinants, merR genes from Gram negative bacteria were strongly conserved and could be grouped closely around the previously sequenced determinants of Tn 501, Tn 21, Tn 5053 (pMER 327 / 419) and pKLH 2. Only the merR genes of pDU 1358 and T 238 showed significant variation from these subgroups. The regions of greatest variation were the carboxyl <b>terminal</b> <b>coding</b> region of the merR gene and the operator/promoter region.

The focus is primarily on implementation in ATM systems which provide the following facilities of withdrawing currency at any remote terminal, verification of the end users identity using Personal Identification Number and an authentic One-Time-Session-Dependent Key generation and validation through the mobile. This system requires building up of an third party agent which would establish a secure session to the bank application with the terminal only after a series of authentication mechanism without compromising the privacy of any individual. The customers, without any insider privileges, can withdraw currency without being detected by any mechanisms of theft of card and eaves dropping of the Password from the card holders within the terminal software are also a major threat yet to be addressed. A basic solution is the terminals having bi-fold authentication mechanisms where mobile dependent one time session dependent key is being generated with authenticity being ensured and the confidentiality being maintained. In such a system, the correctness burden on the <b>terminal’s</b> <b>code</b> is significantly less as the customers have been given the chance to authorize themselves from their hand-held devices and are allowed to withdraw currency in terminal only after their identity is proved by a series of authentication procedures.
