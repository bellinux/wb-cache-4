40|$|Abstract Characteristics and {{availability}} of biomass waste streams and residues for power production by means of integrated gasification/combined cycle technology (BIG/CC), are evaluated for The Netherlands. Four main categories are investigated: streams from agriculture; organic waste; wood; and sludges. Altogether 18 different streams are distinguished. Gross availability and net availability are inventorized. Various properties (composition, heating value, supply patterns) are analysed and the suitability of these streams for conversion i a BIG/CC unit is studied. The costs at which various <b>treams</b> {{are likely to be}} available are assessed. The gross energetic availability amounts annually to approximately 190 PJ (HHV) primary energy. Because of competing useful and higher value applications than fuel of various <b>treams,</b> such as fodder and fertilizer, the net availability is slightly less than 90 PJ (HHV). For a number of streams the costs are negative due to present waste-treatment costs. Costs of waste streams vary from- 10 - 5 ECU/GJ. For a small fraction the costs are higher than for energy crops (estimated to be approximately 4. 5 ECU/GJ). Because there are large variations in properties and contaminants between various <b>treams,</b> the conversion system needs to flexible when a diversity of streams is treated in one installation. Some streams require mixing with cleaner fuels to make them suitable for use in a direct atmospheric biomass integrated gasifier/combined cycle system. Important technical limits for th...|$|E

Beginning with an overview and discussion of counterculture's application {{in the context of the}} late 1960 s, the article argues that many of the claims for the validity of counterculture in this socio-historical context reflect issues and shortcomings similar to those offered in relation to the concept of subculture. That is to say, counterculture was cast as a class-based (in this case middle class) mode of resistance to the dominant mains- <b>tream</b> society. The article then goes on to offer reasons as to why such a claim was, as in the case of subculture, ill-foun- ded. The article then goes on to consider how the emer- gence of the cultural turn in sociology and cultural theory further problematises the original conceptualisation of counterculture and renders the term largely incompatible with contemporary understandings of social and cultural movements in a global context. Finally, the article considers why counterculture lives on in a popular and vernacular context, a central facet of which, it is argued, relates to the way in which counterculture has been deployed in the me- dia as a means of representing critical moments in everyday responses to socio-economic and cultural tension.

40|$|The {{advantages}} of pattern-bas programming have been well-documented in the sequential literature. However patterns {{have yet to}} make their way into mains <b>tream</b> parallel computing, even though several research tools support them. There are two criticals hortcomings of pattern (or template) based systems for parallel programming: lack of extensibility and performance. The patterns supported by a tool are typically limited in number or scope, thereby narrowing the applicability of a given system. As well, patterns usually offer generic solutions, which incur additional runtime overhead that impacts performance. This paper describes our approach for addressing these problems in the CO 2 P 3 S parallel programming system. CO 2 P 3 S supports multiple levels of abstraction, allowing the user to design an application with high-level patterns, but move to lower levels of abstraction for performance tuning. Patterns are implemented as parameterized templates allowing the user the ability to customize the pattern to meet their needs. CO 2 P 3 S generates code that is specific to the pattern/parameter combinations elected by the user. The MetaCO 2 P 3 S tool addresses extensibility by giving us the ability to design and add new pattern templates to CO 2 P 3 S. Since the pattern templates are stored in a system-independent format, they are suitable for storing in a repository to be shared throughout the user community.

Most {{of the energy}} is consumed in the home. Both in the European Union countries and in Romania, the residential sector represents a very important potential for reducing the energy consumption by introducing some efficient non-pollutant technologies and an advanced energy management. The electricity consumption in residential sector is mainly focused on the lighting and domestic appliances.

5000|$|Pérez {{debuted in}} 1985 during an angle {{where his father}} Miguel Pérez Sr. {{appeared}} as a photographer at ring side taking pictures and scouting opponents before Miguel Pérez Jr.'s debut. During a match Eric Embry attacked Miguel Pérez Sr. with camera in hand and Miguel Pérez Jr. came to his father's rescue. This eventually lead to Pérez Jr.'s debut match. Had a feud with The Crusher in early 1986. At Aniversario 1986, Pérez unsuccessfully challenged Ric Flair for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. At Aniversario 1987, he defeated Reginald Lisowski. At Aniversario 1988, Pérez teamed with Castillo to defeat Bobby Jaggers and Dan Kroffat in a hair vs hair match. In 1989, he joined Castillo in a tour to New Japan Pro Wrestling, with both being rebranded as [...] "José Pérez" [...] and [...] "Daniel Castillo", collectively known as [...] "The Caribbean Express". On February 22, 1989, they lost to Kuniaki Kobayashi and Osamu Kido. The Caribbean Express repeated this performance in their next appearance. On February 28, 1989, Pérez and Castillo lost to Kengo Kimura and Tatsumi Fujinami. They opponed the Big Fight Series with a lost. In the second date, The Caribbean Express defeated Hirozaku Hata and Naoki Sano. They then joined Sid Vicious to defeat Kengo Kimura, Sano and Tatsumi Fujinami. This {{was followed by a}} loss to Kobayashi and Saito in a rematch. In his first singles match for NJPW, Pérez was unsuccessful in challenging Antonio Inoki. The Caribbean Express once again teamed with Vicious in consecutive losses to Hiroshi Hase, Masa Saito & Riki Chosu and Kengo Kimura, Chiro Koshinaka & Tatsumi Fujinami. On March 12, 1989, Pérez and Castillo lost to Hirokazu Hata and Naoki Sano. In the following two events, Kuniaki Kobayashi teamed with Hiro Saito and Naoki Sano to earn consecutive victories over The Caribbean Express. Returning to WWC for Aniversario 1989, Pérez and Castillo dropped the WWC Caribbean Tag Team Championship to David Sierra and Jerry Morrow. At Aniversario 1990, Pérez and Castillo retained over Sierra and Ron Starr. In late 1990, he returned to NJPW now as a singles wrestler and was rebranded as [...] "Miguelito Pérez". He teamed with Owen Hart in a loss to Kengo Kimura and Osamu Kido. On October 5, 1990, Pérez teamed with Chris Benoit to defeat Shiro Koshinaka and Jushin Thunder Liger. In his next appearance, Masa Saito and Shinya Hashimoto won a tag team match over him and Ricky Steamboat. Teaming once again with Hart, he lost to Keiji Muto and Masahiro Chono. On October 11, 1990, he lost a singles match to Masa Saito. Pérez then joined Benoit and Vader in a loss to Animal Hamaguchi, Tastsutoshi Godo and Junji Hirata. On October 14, 1990, he <b>treamed</b> with Rivera to defeat Kengo Kimura and Kuniaki Kobayashi. At New Year Dash, Pérez teamed with Benoit in a victory over the Dragon Bombers. This was followed by a win in a three on three match, where he teamed with Benoit and Luc [...] "Rambo" [...] Poirier. Pérez then teamed with Poirier to defeat Tatsumi Fujinami and Kimura. The team of Rivera and Pérez lost its second match, but both teamed again in a three way that involved Vader, with mixed results. His following match was another three on three, where he teamed with Poirier and Marcus Laurinaitis in a loss to Kimura, Fujinami and Osamu Kido. He then teamed with Lauranaitis in a loss to Kido and Kamura. The following week, Rivera replaced Lauranaitis in a win over the same team. On May 27, 1991, Chono defeated Pérez in a singles match. In his following appearance, he teamed with Rivera and Vader in a win over Keiji Muto, Kimura and Fujinami. Fujinami went on to win a singles match between them. In the next event, the Dragon Bombers defeated Pérez and Benoit. At The Legend of Dragon Tatsumi Fujinami 20th Anniversary both teamed with Junji Hirata in a loss to Kimura, Kido and Steve Keirn.|$|R
40|$|Amongst {{digestive}} diseases, cirrhosis is {{the most}} common non-neoplastic cause of mortality in the Western world. Furthermore, its prevalence is likely to increase in the coming decades because of the increasing incid ence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. In this project, we focused on the pathophysiology of acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF, chapter IA) to gain a further understanding of several of the lethal complications in cirrhosis: bacterial translocation from the gut (BTL), intrahepatic microcirculatory dysfunction and portal hypertension, immune dysfunction and the process of hepatic fibrogenesis. In a first set of experiments, we evaluated different translational rat models of hepatic disease to e valuate the presence of gut barrier dysfunction and ultimately intestina l bacterial translocation (Chapter III). Surprisingly, in a well validat ed model of toxic cirrhosis and portal hypertension (thioacetamide-induc ed cirrhosis, TAA), BTL did not occur, despite the presence of increased gut permeability. However, in both models of short-term and long-term c holestasis, BTL was clearly present, consistent with the clinical presen tation of patients suffering from ACLF (jaundice) and data by other grou ps showing that also in humans, bacterial translocation occurs only in t he context of decompensated cirrhosis (again with jaundice) and even acu te cholestatic liver injury. These findings led to the hypothesis that t he farnesoid-X receptor (FXR), a chief regulator of bile acid metabolism, is critically involved in hepatic decompensation, because it not only reverses cholestasis as such, but appears also expressed by intestine, i mmune cells and systemic endothelium, with increasing reports of diverse functionality potentially important in the context of ACLF (Chapter IB). For this reason, we preferred the use of a highly potent and selective FXR agonist (obeticholic acid, INT- 747) above loss-of-function experime nts to better resemble the human condition and to avoid the interference of compensatory pathways as seen after genetic knock-down. In a first s et of experiments, we gained proof of concept that FXR is indeed deficie nt in the ileum of cholestatic rats (by means of bile-duct ligation, BDL), and by restoration of its functionality with INT- 747, gut permeabilit y is restored selectively in the ileum, resulting in reduced BTL (Chapte r IV). Interestingly, this is not associated with major alterations in n either bile acid pool nor composition, suggesting another functional int eraction than purely via FXR-mediated alterations in bile acid metabolis m. From this perspective, we were able to document an important decrease in both the systemic and local intestinal immune response after INT- 747 treatment in BDL rats (especially targeting natural killer cells and in terferon-gamma expression) with secondary beneficial effects on gut dys function, thus preventing BTL observed in this model. Given the fact tha t we also found a decrease in hepatic fibrosis upon FXR agonist treatment in these BDL rats, we then aimed to investigate whether this is only s econdary to the reported decrease in BTL (and subsequently decreased Kup ffer cell activation) or through a direct effect within the hepatic micr o-environment. For these studies, to avoid a possible interference of BT L, we evaluated TAA rats subjected to 4 weeks of INT- 747 treatment, both in a prophylactic and a therapeutic setting (Chapter VI). As such, we w ere able to document a decrease in hepatic fibrosis by FXR agonists, aga in related to an overall decrease in hepatic inflammation and subsequent decrease in hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation as well as cytokines involved in HSC-related fibrogenesis, fibrinolysis, apoptosis and proli feration. A direct effect on HSC, as reported by other groups, was exclu ded in vitro. This reduction in hepatic fibrosis was in turn associated with a decrease in the structural component of intrahepatic vascular res istance (IHVR) and thus decreased portal hypertension. In a final set of experiments, we then aimed to investigate the pure hemodynamic effects in the hepatic microcirculation by INT- 747, by applying only short-term (24 hour) treatment in both BDL and TAA cirrhotic rats (Chapter V). In b oth models, we were able to document hepatic FXR pathway down-regulation /deficiency. Conversely, following FXR re-activation by INT- 747, we were able to document decreased portal hypertension by reduction also of the functional component of IHVR. This was related to an increased hepatic expression of phosphorylated endothelial nitric oxide synthase (P-eNOS) by liver sinusoidal endothelial cells. Again in vitro, a direct effect o n HSC contractility by INT- 747 could be excluded. Interestingly, the ups <b>tream</b> mechanisms of increased P-eNOS differed upon the etiology of the u nderlying liver disease: in TAA rats this was related to alterations in the Rho kinase pathway, while in BDL rats this depended upon decreased a symmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), secondary to increased dimethylargini ne dimethylaminohydrolase- 2 (DDAH- 2). In conclusion, we have shown t hat FXR deficiency in the gut-liver axis is critically associated with m any of the lethal complications in cirrhosis: bacterial translocation fr om the gut, hepatic and intestinal inflammation, portal hypertension and the development of hepatic fibrosis. We have also demonstrated that fun ctional re-activation of the FXR pathway by means of INT- 747 is able to attenuate or reverse many of these detrimental processes in different ex perimental settings of liver injury. These data explain in part the bene ficial findings in clinical trials at this time conducted in patients su ffering from primary biliary cirrhosis, non-alcoholic fatty liver diseas e and portal hypertension and supports extending these trials with FXR a gonists to other forms of chronic liver injury. status: publishe...|$|R
