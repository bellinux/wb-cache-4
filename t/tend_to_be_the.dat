5|$|The Marwari or Malani {{is a rare}} {{breed of}} horse from the Marwar (or Jodhpur) region of India. Known for its inward-turning ear tips, it comes in all equine colours, {{although}} pinto patterns <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> most popular with buyers and breeders. It {{is known for its}} hardiness, and is quite similar to the Kathiawari, another Indian breed from the Kathiawar region southwest of Marwar. Many breed members exhibit a natural ambling gait. The Marwari are descended from native Indian ponies crossed with Arabian horses, possibly with some Mongolian influence.|$|E
5|$|The {{trade off}} is between {{capacity}} and price. I've had some conversations with people saying 'it's {{getting a bit}} expensive Alan' and I know it is. I think the obvious route is the Geoffrey Watling stand, whether you put another layer on it or take it down and re-build, I don't know. Probably the sensible {{thing to do is}} bite the bullet, take it down and build a new stand, but it means 18 to 24 months without revenue and the people in that stand <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> people who have been the supporters for many generations.|$|E
5|$|Banff National Park spans three ecoregions, {{including}} montane, subalpine, and alpine. The subalpine ecoregion, {{which consists}} mainly of dense forest, comprises 53percent of Banff's area. 27percent {{of the park}} is located above the tree line, in the alpine ecoregion. The tree line in Banff lies approximately at , with open meadows at alpine regions and some areas covered by glaciers. A small portion (3percent) of the park, located at lower elevations, is in the montane ecoregion. Lodgepole pine forests dominate the montane region of Banff, with Engelmann spruce, willow, aspen, occasional Douglas-fir and a few Douglas maple interspersed. Engelmann spruce are {{more common in the}} subalpine regions of Banff, with some areas of lodgepole pine, and subalpine fir. The montane areas in the Bow Valley, which <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> preferred habitat for wildlife, have been subjected to significant human development over the years.|$|E

5|$|Many {{programming}} {{languages are}} already widely accepted and understood. However, {{the desire to}} create radically different programming languages to support the aspect-oriented programming paradigm is not significant due to business-related concerns; there are risks associated with adopting new technologies. Use of an entirely new language relies on a business's ability to acquire new developers. Additionally, the existing code base of a business {{would need to be}} discarded. Finally, a business would need to acquire a new toolchain (suite of tools) for development, which is often both an expense in both money and time. Primary concerns about roadmaps for the adoption of new technologies <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> need to train new developers and adapt existing processes to the new technology.|$|E
5|$|Reading is {{considered}} to be a key element of vocabulary development in school-age children. Before children are able to read on their own, children can learn from others reading to them. Learning vocabulary from these experiences includes using context, as well as explicit explanations of words and/or events in the story. This may be done using illustrations in the book to guide explanation and provide a visual reference or comparisons, usually to prior knowledge and past experiences. Interactions between the adult and the child often include the child's repetition of the new word back to the adult. When a child begins to learn to read, their print vocabulary and oral vocabulary <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> same, as children use their vocabulary knowledge to match verbal forms of words with written forms. These two forms of vocabulary are usually equal up until grade 3. Because written language is much more diverse than spoken language, print vocabulary begins to expand beyond oral vocabulary. By age 10, children's vocabulary development through reading moves away from learning concrete words to learning abstract words.|$|E

25|$|In 2002, Dr. Watson Scott Swail founded EPI to {{establish}} stronger connections between educational research and educational policy, {{with an emphasis}} on historically underserved communities such as students from low-income families, students of color, and students with disabilities. Swail chose this focus because these student populations <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> primary target of the majority of educational policy programs, while their voices are simultaneously under-represented in the policy-making arena. This discrepancy points to the need for a greater understanding of what factors have the greatest influence on their educational outcomes.|$|E

25|$|In addition, a few species {{routinely}} climb {{trees and}} form a dominant component of canopy faunas, where they may be collected by beating or insecticide fogging.

In temperate regions, a few species (e.g. Anurophorus spp., Entomobrya albocincta, Xenylla xavieri, Hypogastrura arborea) are almost exclusively arboreal. In tropical regions a single square meter of canopy habitat can support many species of Collembola.|$|E

Total phenolic content, a laboratory index of antioxidant strength, is higher in purple varieties due almost entirely to anthocyanin density in purple grape skin compared to absence of anthocyanins in white grape skin. It is these anthocyanins that are attracting the efforts of scientists to define their properties for human health. Phenolic content of grape skin varies with cultivar, soil composition, climate, geographic origin, and cultivation practices or exposure to diseases, such as fungal infections.|$|E
25|$|Currency {{interest}} rate fluctuations: Like all fixed income securities, {{the prices of}} fixed rate ABS move in response to changes in {{interest rate}}s. Fluctuations in interest rates affect floating rate ABS prices less than fixed rate securities, as the index against which the ABS rate adjusts will reflect interest rate changes in the economy. Furthermore, interest rate changes may affect the prepayment rates on underlying loans that back some types of ABS, which can affect yields. Home equity loans <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> most sensitive to changes in interest rates, while auto loans, student loans, and credit cards are generally less sensitive to interest rates.|$|E
