6000|$|Lawford <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath,</b> <b>and</b> quietly {{faced her}} again. 'In the old churchyard, Widderstone; I was looking at--at the gravestones.' ...|$|E
60|$|He <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> <b>and</b> stood simmering. Miss Smith {{came forward}} and, with a smothered giggle, took the mate's arm and {{squeezed}} it.|$|E
60|$|She was roused {{from these}} semi-delirious speculations {{in the sun}} furnace by Siegmund's waking. He opened his eyes, <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath,</b> <b>and</b> looked smiling at Helena.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Take</b> <b>a</b> <b>Deep</b> <b>Breath</b> is {{the second}} {{full-length}} album by Canadian band, Brighton Rock. The album was released in 1988. <b>Take</b> <b>a</b> <b>Deep</b> <b>Breath</b> is Brighton Rock's most commercially successful album, peaking at #22 on the Canadian album chart. The album was also certified Gold by the CRIA. [...] Gerry McGhee announced on April 30th, 2013 that <b>Take</b> <b>a</b> <b>Deep</b> <b>Breath</b> will be remastered by Warner Records.|$|R
60|$|I <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> like <b>a</b> man who {{is about}} to jump an {{obstacle}} in his path.|$|R
60|$|Sheila <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath,</b> but did {{not look}} up. 'I am entirely in your hands,' she replied.|$|R
60|$|Both youths <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath,</b> <b>and</b> {{then out}} on the snowy air rang a sharp, shrill whistle, once, twice, three times, rising and falling in a fashion known only to the cadets of the {{military}} school.|$|E
60|$|He <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> <b>and</b> clenched 'his hands together. By {{the time}} Mr. Chase {{came into the}} room he was able to greet him with a {{stealthy}} wink. Mr. Chase, with a humorous twist of his mouth, winked back.|$|E
60|$|Rage had transfigured her. She {{scarcely}} {{heard her}} own words. They poured out senselessly, monotonously, one calling up another, {{as if from}} the lips of a Cassandra. Lawford sank back into bed, clutching the sheets with both lean hands. He <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> <b>and</b> shut his mouth.|$|E
6000|$|... "’Undo your shirt,’ ses the skipper, {{going over}} to him, an’ {{sticking}} the trumpet agin him. ’Now <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath.</b> Don’t cough.’ ...|$|R
60|$|She <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> of the sharp, invigorating air, {{then looked}} about her, and espying me in {{conversation}} with Giacopo she approached us across the gleaming snow.|$|R
60|$|The new-comer {{threw back}} his head, {{and a look}} that was half wonder, half {{enlightenment}} gleamed in the black depths of his imperious eyes. He <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath.</b>|$|R
60|$|The {{two gentlemen}} turned {{and gazed at}} each other in stupefaction. Mr. Stokes was the first to recover, and, taking his dazed friend by the arm, led him gently away. At {{the end of the street}} he <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath,</b> <b>and,</b> after a slight pause to collect his {{scattered}} energies, summed up the situation.|$|E
60|$|I {{lifted my}} head and yelled. I have a good, deep voice, due to a hound strain in my pedigree, and at the public-house, {{when there was a}} full moon, I have often had people leaning out of the windows and saying things all down the street. I <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> <b>and</b> let it go.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wait, Joseph!" [...] {{he cried}} dramatically. [...] "This {{is no time}} to disarm. Keep your sword on your thigh, man; you will need it as you never yet have needed it." [...] He paused, <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath,</b> <b>and</b> hurled the news at his brother. [...] "Roland Marleigh is here." [...] And he sat down like a man exhausted.|$|E
6000|$|I <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath.</b> I put {{my hands}} {{to the sides of}} my mouth. [...] "Cavor!" [...] I bawled, and the sound was like some manikin {{shouting}} far away.|$|R
60|$|Stephen <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath.</b> If {{he knocked}} Mr. Hopper down, he {{certainly}} could not buy her. And {{it was a}} relief to know that the sale had not begun.|$|R
50|$|The cartoon {{begins as}} a coyote howls from a {{mountain}} top, under a full moon. He <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> as his body inflates to accommodate extra air and releases another howl.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Silk <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath,</b> <b>and</b> buttoned up his coat, {{as though}} {{preparing}} to meet Mr. Nugent {{there and then}} in deadly encounter for the person of Miss Kybird. The colour was back in his cheeks by this time, {{and his eyes were}} unusually bright. He took a step towards Mr. Kybird and, pressing his hand warmly, pushed him back into his seat again.|$|E
60|$|He <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> <b>and</b> {{then stepped}} out onto the gray, rubbled ground. After a minute he lit a {{cigarette}} and stood gazing around him. The landscape was dead. Nothing stirred. He could see for miles, endless ash and slag, ruins of buildings. A few trees without leaves or branches, only the trunks. Above him the eternal rolling clouds of gray, drifting between Terra and the sun.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Tasker <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> <b>and</b> {{resumed his}} labours. He set the table, {{and when the}} water boiled made the tea, and went down the garden to {{announce}} the fact. Mr. Chalk was still up aloft, and even at that height the pallor of his face was clearly discernible. It was evident to the couple below that the terrors of the descent were too much for him, {{but that he was}} too proud to say so.|$|E
6000|$|He carried {{down the}} stairs into the Courtyard, [...] But there he made no stay, [...] He just tied up his Garters, <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath,</b> [...] And ran like the wind away.|$|R
6000|$|... "Will {{you come}} up to the surface? I want to see you for a moment." [...] Hendricks <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath.</b> [...] "Come up here with me. I want to talk to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Look here,' said Lawford densely, 'you {{know that}} I love {{you as much}} as ever; but with this--as I am; what would be the good of my saying so?' Mrs Lawford <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath.</b>|$|R
60|$|Stealthily {{as a cat}} I sprang {{towards the}} terrace, the steps to which I climbed on hands and knees. Stooping, I sped silently across it until I had gained the flower-bed {{immediately}} below the window that had drawn me to it. Crouching there--for did I stand upright my chin would be on a level with the sill--I paused to listen for some moments. The only sound I caught was a rustle, as of paper. Emboldened, I <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath,</b> <b>and</b> standing up I gazed straight into the chamber.|$|E
60|$|I <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath,</b> <b>and</b> {{opened my}} eyes, whereat the voice cried out gladly that its intercessions had been heard, and I {{knew that it}} was on my behalf that the saints of Heaven had been {{disturbed}} in their beatific peace. My head was pillowed in a woman's lap, and it took me a moment or two to realise that that lap was Madonna Paula's, as was hers the voice that had reached my awakening senses, the voice that now welcomed me back to life in terms that were very different from the last that I could remember her having used towards me.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Clifford {{jumped from}} the saddle, and Benita, who could not speak, pointed to the {{pursuing}} Matabele. He sat down upon a rock, cocked his rifle, <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath,</b> <b>and</b> aimed and fired at the soldier who was coming on carelessly in the open. Mr. Clifford was a good shot, and shaken though he was, at this supreme moment his skill did not fail him. The man was struck somewhere, for he staggered about and fell; then slowly picked himself up, and began to hobble back towards his companions, who, when they met him, stopped a minute {{to give him some}} kind of assistance.|$|E
50|$|Her play <b>Take</b> <b>a</b> <b>Deep</b> <b>Breath</b> and Breathe, <b>a</b> loose {{adaptation}} of Aristophanes' Lysistrata, {{opened at the}} Ovalhouse Theatre in 2013 and transferred to the CLF Art Cafe in Peckham, running there from 13 to 31 August 2013.|$|R
60|$|Conger stepped down, {{onto the}} damp sidewalk. The guard came swiftly after him, {{and then the}} Speaker. Conger <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> of the cold air. He studied the dim outline of the {{building}} rising up before them.|$|R
60|$|She <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath,</b> {{amazed at}} her boldness, for this wasn't {{in the least}} how she had meant to begin. And she gazed at the rector anxiously. To her surprise, he {{did not appear to}} be inordinately shocked.|$|R
60|$|The stale odour of {{cigarette}} smoke with which the dim corridor was charged intoxicated, threatened to overpower him. It {{seemed to be the}} reek of evil itself. A closing door had a sinister meaning. He hurried; obscurity reigned below, the light in the lower hall being out; fumbled for the door-knob, and once in the street <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> <b>and</b> mopped his brow; but he had not proceeded half a block before he hesitated, retraced his steps, reentered the vestibule, and stooped to peer at the cards under the speaking tubes. Cheaply printed in large script, {{was the name of the}} tenant of the second floor rear,--MISS KATE MARCY....|$|E
6000|$|The few {{scattered}} groups {{upon the}} beach regarded them with horror {{for the most}} part, {{but some of the}} children and young people were interested and drew nearer. [...] "There ain't a bob on the beach," [...] said Grubb in an undertone, and the Desert Dervishes plied their bicycles with comic [...] "business," [...] that got a laugh from one very unsophisticated little boy. Then they <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> <b>and</b> struck into the cheerful strain of [...] "What Price Hair-pins Now?" [...] Grubb sang the song, Bert did his best to make the chorus a rousing one, and it the end of each verse they danced certain steps, skirts in hand, that they had carefully rehearsed.|$|E
60|$|Joe {{placed a}} big {{hand on the}} stone and tried to move it. According to Shefford's eye {{measurement}} the stone was nearly oval, perhaps three feet high, by {{a little over two}} in width. Joe threw off his sombrero, <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath,</b> <b>and,</b> bending over, clasped the stone in his arms. He was an exceedingly heavy and powerful man, and it was plain to Shefford that he meant to lift the stone if that were possible. Joe's broad shoulders strained, flattened; his arms bulged, his joints cracked, his neck corded, and his face turned black. By gigantic effort he lifted the stone and moved it about six inches. Then as he released his hold he fell, and when he sat up his face was wet with sweat.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh" [...] said Mr. Chase. He <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath.</b> [...] "Oh, really!" [...] he said. [...] "I wouldn't 'ave {{thought it}} of you, Gussie. I wouldn't 'ave thought you'd have played it so low down. I'm {{surprised}} at you." ...|$|R
60|$|When {{the very}} tip of Sappho's tail had melted into the foliage of the road, I arose {{to my feet}} and <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> of the happy air. I had seen her, and it was with her father she was riding.|$|R
6000|$|... "Speaking {{of these}} {{historical}} romances," [...] said Mwres, with {{an attempt at}} an easy, off-hand manner, [...] "brings me--ah--to the matter I--ah--had in mind when I asked you--when I expressed a wish to see you." [...] He paused and <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath.</b>|$|R
