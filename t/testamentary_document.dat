6000|$|... "May it please your Lordship," [...] he began, [...] "the {{details of}} this case are of as {{remarkable}} an order as any that to my knowledge have been brought before the Court. The plaintiff, Eustace Meeson, is the sole next-of-kin of Jonathan Meeson, Esquire, the late head of the well known Birmingham publishing firm of Meeson, Addison, and Roscoe. Under a will, bearing date the 8th of May, 1880, the plaintiff was left sole heir to the great wealth of his uncle--that is, {{with the exception of}} some legacies. Under a second will, now relied on by the defendants, and dated the 10th November, 1885, the plaintiff was entirely disinherited, and the present defendants, together with some six or eight legatees, were constituted the sole beneficiaries. On or about the 22nd December, 1885, however, the testator executed a third <b>testamentary</b> <b>document</b> under which the plaintiff takes the entire property, and this is the document now propounded. This <b>testamentary</b> <b>document,</b> or, rather, will--for I submit that it is in every sense a properly executed will--is tattooed upon the shoulders"--(Sensation in the court)--"is tattooed upon the shoulders of a young lady, Miss Augusta Smithers, who will presently be called before your Lordship; and to prevent any misunderstanding, I may as well at once state that since this event this lady has become engaged to be married to the plaintiff (Renewed sensation.) ...|$|E
60|$|Then his Lordship began, and, {{after giving}} a masterly {{summary of the}} whole case, {{concluded}} as follows:--"Such are {{the details of the}} most remarkable probate cause that I ever remember to have had brought to my notice, either during my career at the Bar or on the Bench. It will be obvious, as the learned Attorney-General has said, that the whole case really lies between two points. Is the document on the back of Augusta Smithers a sufficient will to carry the property? and, if so, is the unsupported story of that lady as to the execution of the document to be believed? Now, what does the law understand by the term 'Will'? Surely it understands some writing that expresses the wish or will of a person as to the disposition of his property after his decease? This writing must be executed with certain formalities; but if it is so executed by a person not labouring under any mental or other disability it is indefeasible, except by the subsequent execution of a fresh <b>testamentary</b> <b>document,</b> or by its destruction or attempted destruction, animo revocandi, or by marriage. Subject to these formalities required by the law, the form of the document--provided that its meaning is clear--is immaterial. Now, do the tattoo marks on the back of this lady constitute such a document, and do they convey the true last will or wish of the testator? That is the first point that I have to decide, and I decide it in the affirmative. It is true that it is not usual for testamentary documents to be tattooed upon the skin of a human being; but, because it is not usual, it does not follow that a tattooed document is not a valid one. The ninth section of the Statute of 1 Vic., cap. 26, specifies that no will shall be valid unless it shall be in writing; but cannot this tattooing be considered as writing within the meaning of the Act? I am clearly of opinion that it can, if only on the ground that the material used was ink--a natural ink, it is true, that of the cuttle-fish, but still ink; for I may remark that the natural product of the cuttle-fish was at one time largely used in this country for that very purpose. Further, in reference to this part of the case, it must be borne in mind that the testator was no eccentric being, who from whim or perversity chose this extraordinary method of signifying his wishes as to the disposal of his property. He was a man placed in about as terrible a position as it is possible to conceive. He was, if we are to believe the story of Miss Smithers, most sincerely anxious to revoke a disposition of his property which he now, standing {{face to face with the}} greatest issue of this life, recognised to be unjust, and which was certainly contrary to the promptings of nature as experienced by most men. And yet in this terrible strait in which he found himself, and notwithstanding the earnest desire which grew more intense as his vital forces ebbed, he could find absolutely no means of carrying out his wish. At length, however, this plan of tattooing his will upon the living flesh on a younger and stronger person is presented to him, and he eagerly avails himself of it; and the tattooing is duly carried out in his presence and at his desire, and as duly signed and witnessed. Can it be seriously argued that a document so executed does not fulfil the bare requirements of the law? I think that it cannot, and am of opinion that such a document is as much a valid will as though it had been engrossed upon the skin of a sheep, and duly signed and witnessed in the Temple.|$|E

40|$|As {{summarized}} by {{the comparison of}} laws in Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, and Minnesota, the inheritance rights of adult adoptees vary across jurisdictions. The inheritance rights of an adult adoptee {{will depend on the}} status of the stranger-to-the-adoption rule in the jurisdiction, the age limitations for inheritance in the jurisdiction, and whether there is any language granting or restricting inheritance rights in the <b>testamentary</b> <b>documents.</b> The majority of the time, the goal of the adoption is to make the person a genuine member of the family. As it stands, states do not uniformly treat adult adoptees as genuine members of the family. A default rule that uniformly recognizes the adoptee’s inheritance rights is generally in line with the adoptor’s motivation for the adoption. Three proposals may help to remedy the inconsistent adoption rights across jurisdictions: First, “family” should be defined by looking at the functional role each member plays, as opposed to using marital status to define “family” and to determine the benefits that accompany that status through marriage. Second, allowing a person to designate his or her heir is a partial solution for partners that are prevented from adopting or for partners who are discouraged from adopting by the awkward parent–child relationship that would result from the adoption. Third, a uniform law that gives an adult adoptee the status of a natural child of the adoptor, without any age limits, would ensure the equal treatment of adult adoptees across the country...|$|R
50|$|The {{concept of}} a <b>testamentary</b> <b>document</b> similar to but {{distinct}} from a will had its origins in Roman law. In the pre-classical period, a testator was required to name an heir for a will to be valid (heredis institutio). Failure to name an heir or failure to follow the proper formalities for naming an heir would result in an estate divided {{by the rules of}} intestacy. However, a testator was also able to create a fideicommissum, a more flexible and less formal indication of the testator's intent which could have the effect of transferring part or all of an estate after death, although with fewer rights to the beneficiary than those of a named heir.|$|E
40|$|The {{attorney}} 2 ̆ 7 s {{preparation of}} a <b>testamentary</b> <b>document</b> (hereinafter {{sometimes referred to}} as a will or revocable trust) should clearly and accurately reflect the client 2 ̆ 7 s last wishes. Although these testamentary documents should reflect the client 2 ̆ 7 s intent, they often fall short of accomplishing that goal. There are numerous examples of will and trust construction cases that exhaust tremendous resources in an effort to ascertain the client 2 ̆ 7 s wishes or intent. Many of these cases involve the construction of patent and/or latent ambiguities which should have been resolved by appropriate drafting. This article 2 ̆ 7 s scope is limited to patent ambiguities caused by the attorney 2 ̆ 7 s negligence and their detrimental impact on third parties. In these situations, the patent ambiguity is easily identified and the claim of negligence is clear. A patent ambiguity is obvious {{from the face of the}} will and is easily discovered prior to the testator 2 ̆ 7 s death. For example, a patent ambiguity exists where two different provisions of a will dispose of the same plot of land to different devisees. The attorney 2 ̆ 7 s close reading of the will should have discovered this error. The attorney 2 ̆ 7 s failure to correct the patent ambiguity prior to the testator 2 ̆ 7 s death has detrimental consequences for the third party harmed. Extrinsic evidence is generally not admissible to resolve a patent ambiguity, because courts are unwilling to add to or detract from the written words of the will...|$|E

Statistička obrada podataka otkriva način življenja, norme ponašanja pojedinca u okolnostima pred kraj života, te pravila nasljeđivanja, kroz što se može nazrijeti problematika obiteljskog i vjerskog mentaliteta društva u složenosti i mnogostrukoj određenosti svakidašnjice. The {{analysis}} {{of the culture of}} living in Zadar in the Middle Ages encompassed the testamentary material from the five volumes of the Files of notaries from Zadar, the Miscellanea collection and the previously analyzed sources such as a very extensive inventory of Mihovil Petrov from the monastery of St. Mary, the inventory of Grizogono, the late Lovro de Civalellis, a patrician from Zadar, and the testament of a patrician of Croatian descent Krešo Varikaša from Zadar. The mentioned private legal sources include testaments and inventories connected to the city of Zadar and its district formed in the period between {{the second half of the}} XVIII century and the beginning of the XV century. Data analysis included available facts about the testator, movables and immovables and categories other than movables and immovables such as charities or interment practices that are important in order to understand beliefs and principles characteristic of a certain socio-historical community. Reasons for writing a <b>testamentary</b> <b>document</b> should be looked for in religious politics that propagated the necessity of receiving God’s mercy as a condition for the continuity of existence while caring for progeny and their existence is less important. Overall, the gathered data is not a good indicator of the actual situation since only a small percentage of the original sources was preserved and it, in most part, refers to a higher legal population category that was surely not prevailing. Based on the results, it can be concluded that the greatest disparity in proprietary relations between social groups is not in type, numerosity and material of different objects that are in one 2 ̆ 7 s possession and in their quality of workmanship but in the object itself. The way of living and organization of residential/business space shows similarity to other Dalmatian communes and distant cities in the western European area. Individual abundance of property evident in expensive articles of clothing, valuable tableware or literature in general is following European trends of that time thus showing that Zadar, with its small but significant part of population, follows the cultural trends of its time in different aspects...|$|E
40|$|Modern {{scholars}} are deeply divided over whether Byzantine Egypt (350 to 650 CE) followed Roman law, with some {{saying that the}} effect of Roman law on Egypt was significant and others saying that it was superficial at best. There are a number of reasons for this schism, including the very general references to law in the surviving documents and the differences between Egyptian legal practice and some fundamental elements of Roman legal practice. This thesis seeks to provide additional evidence about the Egyptian adoption of Roman law by using a more systematic approach that looks at <b>testamentary</b> <b>documents</b> and donations mortis causa over a period of time, focusing on whether changes in the law are reflected in changes in the documents. It also uses the newly available word search capability of the papyri databases to look at when Roman legal terms are introduced into Egypt and how they are used. The conclusion of this thesis is that lawyers and notaries in Byzantine Egypt understood and used elements of Roman law in their testamentary practices that were useful in accomplishing the goals of their clients. They were generally very careful to ensure compliance with procedural requirements. They regularly used concepts such as waivers of the requirement for guardians for women based on 'the right of children,' the confirmation of codicils, and et cetera disinheritance clauses. They did use stipulation clauses in ways that Roman legal practitioners would not, and donations mortis causa developed into a simpler alternative to a will. Cultural practices, such as the inclination to leave property to a surviving spouse with inheritance by the children after the death of the surviving spouse, remained. The impact of Roman law on Egyptian legal practice appears to have accelerated in the sixth and seventh centuries. This information is important to historians because of the light it sheds on the success of the early Byzantine emperors to create one Roman world with shared values and norms.

40|$|For centuries, wills {{scholars}} have lamented {{the difficulty of}} discerning intent from <b>testamentary</b> <b>documents</b> but have failed to examine how these documents might be written differently. A will can reflect and reinforce the decedent’s relationships with friends and family, can express support for institutions and causes in which the decedent believes, and can establish the decedent’s lasting legacy. And even if the will is simple and mundane, dealing only with the decedent’s personal possessions or naming her fiduciaries, its terminal nature imbues the will with talismanic power. Often the final significant written communication by its author, a will {{has the potential to}} be a monument—or indeed a testament—to the decedent’s loved ones, to express her vision for the future or her version of the past. More often than not, however, today’s will is written in an insider’s private language, so that testator after testator exclaims at her will execution ceremony about the formal, dry, and sometimes archaic, legalistic writing. Is this necessary? This Article explores the advantages and pitfalls of infusing wills with expressive language. Legal {{scholars have}} widely acknowledged the power and resonance that personal narratives bring to briefs, judicial opinions, and other persuasive legal writing. This scholarship has suggested the critical role of narratives in giving meaning beyond mere rules and doctrine. Remarkably, given the intense emotional aspects of death, scholars have largely ignored the role of expressive and individualized language in wills. This Article takes seriously the ways in which such language might enhance the meaning and significance of transactional documents, such as wills. After exploring the costs and benefits to testators, beneficiaries, fiduciaries, courts and society of expressive will drafting, this Article argues that encouraging a testator to use richer, more varied language can actually help the testator focus on her own intentions and then communicate those intentions to the people she leaves behind. Moreover, this Article rejects the argument that including apparently “unnecessary” language in a will inherently result in more litigation. Rather, it suggests that expressive language has the potential to avert litigation and, when contests do occur, facilitate the court’s analysis of the challenged instrument. Far from “unnecessary,” the inclusion of expressive language in a testator’s final will and testament can strengthen the testator’s connection to her personal identity and her community, an important step in furthering the ultimate goal of having her property pass effectively as she intends and desires...|$|R
40|$|During the 1 st {{millennium}} AD, silk {{became the}} most desirable fibre in the Mediterranean region. While the expansion of silk production and consumption is widely acknowledged, specific features of the industry’s development {{are more difficult to}} discern. Chroniclers had little reason to document silk manufacturing processes, and producers were not inclined to record or publicise their trade secrets. Historical knowledge of silk comes mainly from accounts of its consumption in a variety of forms and contexts. For the middle Byzantine period (AD 843 - 1204), the two most elaborated sources associated with silk date from the 10 th century. The Book of the Eparch (BOE) (911 / 12) is a collection of regulations applied to guilds {{under the supervision of the}} eparch of Constantinople. The Book of Ceremonies (BOC), attributed to Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos (945 - 959), is a compilation of 5 th- to 10 th-century protocols used by court officials to stage imperial rituals. Together, these sources have shaped much of the existing Byzantine scholarship pertaining to silk. The conventional interpretation is that for much of the middle Byzantine period, silk was an imperial prerogative confined to the most elite members of society. However, close reading of the larger body of source evidence shows that the prevailing Byzantine silk narrative has numerous shortcomings and limited value in the study of historic processes. From the standpoint of contemporary scholarship, the role of silk in the middle Byzantine period requires reconsideration through application of current research methods. To provide a more secure historical basis for silk research, other types of writing should be considered including histories, chronicles, and <b>testamentary</b> <b>documents.</b> A survey of Byzantine and other contemporary sources dated between the 6 th and 13 th centuries reveals a large number of textual ‘mentions’ describing textiles. Many mentions contain only partial information, but include terms associated with silk such as production place, materials, weave type, end use, design, quality, and usage context. Philologists have long tried to clarify the meaning of textile words in Byzantine sources with limited success. For example, in his preface to BOC, Vogt observed that it is not possible to know the precise nuances of textile-related terms. The general view is that lexical analysis can recognise the incidence of various words, but there is seldom sufficient descriptive information in written works to form a reconstructive view of textiles. Probing more deeply, there are several reasons why textile terminology presents such a challenge. With few exceptions, authors used specific textile terms in context without elaborated definition or provision of descriptive details. Like other specialised lexicons, textile terminology usage was sometimes inconsistent and localised. Moreover, textile terms were not stable, but evolved different meanings over time. Various factors contributed to the migration of meaning including changes in material type, production location, and technology. In recent decades, new research methods supported by computer information technologies have equipped historians to analyse evidence more exhaustively and dynamically than in the past. To study Byzantine textile terminology, I developed a relational database of textile mentions similar in concept and form to a prosopography. This database comprises over 800 descriptive mentions of textiles found in a variety of Byzantine sources dating from the 6 th to 13 th centuries. The resulting corpus provides an evidentiary basis to discern patterns that are difficult to perceive with conventional methods. The textile mention database supports critical examination of textual evidence to define the meaning of terms pertaining to or associated with silk in the middle Byzantine period. This process is aided by considering written sources from a framework that follows the general sequence of silk textile processes including material acquisition and preparation, textile construction, decoration, and pattern reproduction. The larger objective is to use the collective terminology data to redefine historical understanding of silk in the middle Byzantine period by demonstrating its social importance, contribution to technology development, and integration in the regional economy...|$|R
40|$|Two {{lists of}} the books {{contained}} in Marulić’s library have been preserved, one drawn up in Marulić’s hand and appended to his will (Repertorium librorum), and the other produced by its executors after Marulić’s death (Inventarium librorum). Considering what we already know about Marulić, we can say with certainty that the two lists do not register all of the items that made part of the poet’s original library holdings; still, they provide an important secondary source {{for the study of}} the literary work and spiritual profile of the Split humanist. The names of the authors and titles of around 190 listed works (mainly printed and partly in manuscript), testify to the multifaceted nature of the owner’s interests. In the Repertorium librorum Marulić grouped the items of his collection according to the criteria of genre and subject–matter. The resulting divisions bear the fol-lowing titles (we add also the number of items in each division) : Ecclesiastici: 35 (Marulić’s own works are not included); Libri zentilium: Poetae - 15; Historici - 22; Geographi - 2; Gramatici - 13; Comenta - 4; Epistolae - 6; De re rustica - 4; Astronomi - 3; Philosophi et oratores - 32. Even such a brief and schematic survey makes it possible to draw the following, important conclusions: in the divisions of the Pagan books (where, along with the Classical authors, appear the names of some medieval and contemporary authors as well) we can find, practically by name, all five fields of the studia humaniratis: grammar (Gramatici), rhetoric (Philosophi et oratores), poetry (Poetae), history (Historici), moral philosophy (Philosophi et oratores). It should be emphasized that these divisions include the largest number of titles (with exception of the group Ecclesiastici, of course). Although, on the whole, the Inventorium librorum repeats the titles from the Repertorium, it is enlarged with twenty new titles. In the present study all the items from both lists are ordered according to the afore- said humanist disciplines and accompanied by brief commentaries. They have two purposes: 1. to identify at least some of the titles that so far have remained obscure; 2. to determine the role that the works collected by Marulić had in the context of the cultural and educational horizons of the Renaissance Humanism. (The titles of the single volumes are not quoted here, as they may be consulted in the text itself.) It is worth noting that many of the books that Marulić read were not represented in his library (or, at least, have not been registered in the lists). Consequently, we should not be deceived by the mere numerical ratio between the groups of the Ecclesiastici and Libri zentilium, particularly since Marulić was much better read in the Christian authors than it could be inferred from the testamentary catalogue. Where the Pagan authors and secular themes in general are concerned, we could say that the ratio between the evidence offered by the extant works and those of whose existence we learn from the <b>testamentary</b> <b>documents,</b> is inverse. In his works Marulić refers to the Pagan authors with emphasized caution, declaring fit for reading only those that can be useful to a Christian as an instrument of moral perfection. In his role of the »active« humanist (i. e. as a writer), the deeply religious Marulić preferred to promote Christian principles and moral-didactic action. Other themes - pleasures and sorrows of every-day life, satirical stings aiming at con-temporaries, the handling of Classical mythological themes, even love and erotic impulses - are present in his work to a far lesser extent, and almost exclusively in verse. The research undertaken here points to the unique conclusion that, as a »passive« humanist (i. e. as a reader), Marulić stood in the main stream of the literary and spiritual life of his day, characterized by a lively and unrestrained interest in every sphere of human life and integral heritage of the Antiquity. The titles quoted in the division Libri zentilium show, beyond doubt, that the horizons of the reader Marulić were much wider than it could be concluded on the mere base of his work and declared attitudes. This should be kept in mind whenever we discuss, in general terms, Marulić’s out-look and his synchronization with the Renaissance Humanism...|$|R
