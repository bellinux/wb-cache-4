5|$|German forces {{continued}} their counterattacks on Übach, suffering heavy casualties to American artillery and infantry fire. Although {{the inability to}} retake Übach persuaded German commanders that they had insufficient forces to properly defend the approaches to Aachen, the counterattacks did tie down American troops which could have otherwise continued the advance. On 4 October, the Allied advance was limited, with only the towns of Hoverdor and Beggendorf taken, the Americans having lost roughly 1,800 soldiers in <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>three</b> <b>days</b> of combat. Better progress was made on 5 October, as the 119th Regiment of the 30th Infantry Division captured Merkstein-Herbach. The following day the Germans launched another counterattack against Übach, again failing to dislodge the Americans. German armor was unable {{to cope with the}} overwhelming numerical superiority of the American tanks, and as a last-ditch effort to halt the advance the Germans began concentrated attacks on American positions with what artillery and aircraft they could muster. They found themselves severely hamstrung by lack of reserves, although General Koechling was able to deploy a Tiger detachment to the town of Alsdorf in an attempt to plug the American penetration of Aachen's northern defenses.|$|E

He was a splendid rider and an excellent shot with his rifle, for his father had obtained a permit from the authorities for him to carry one, and he could bring down an antelope when running at full speed as neatly as any of the young Boers. Four days a week he had spent in the mines, for his father intended him to follow in his footsteps, and he had worked by turns with the miners below and the engineers on the surface, so that he might in the course of a few years be thoroughly acquainted with all the details of his profession.|$|R
40|$|The {{current study}} {{examined}} the impact of non-specific treatment factors, therapeutic dosage and treatment satisfaction, on drinking behaviors and consequences among adolescents participating in a voluntary, high school- based alcohol intervention (N = 94). Path analysis served to test the primary model in which satisfaction and dosage were predicted to influence severity of alcohol use (i. e., number of binge drinking episodes and alcohol-related problems within <b>the</b> <b>past</b> 30 <b>days)</b> <b>three</b> months after initial intervention participation. Student attempts to reduce or quit drinking alcohol were proposed as an intervening variable in the model, accounting {{for part of the}} relationship between treatment variables and changes in alcohol involvement. In addition, student estimates of peer frequency of alcohol use were included in the model as a covariate to account for previous findings of the current intervention, which demonstrated that reductions in perceived peer alcohol use were associated with decreased drinking. Two theoretically-sound alternative models were also tested to determine which model best fit the data. The model exhibiting the best relative fit included direct paths 1) from treatment satisfaction and peer drinking estimates to 1 -month alcohol quit attempts, and 2) direct paths from quit attempts and peer drinking estimates to 3 -month binge drinking episodes. Examination of path coefficients revealed three significant relationships. First, students reporting greater peer estimates of alcohol use at intake {{were more likely to report}} at least one quit attempt at 1 -month follow-up. Next, students who had a reported quit attempt were more likely to report greater alcohol use severity two months later. Finally, greater baseline alcohol use severity was associated with greater follow-up alcohol use severity. Overall, it appears that adolescents self-selecting into an alcohol intervention are likely to make change efforts early in treatment, with little change in quit attempts between one and three months post-intake. Similarly, more did not mean better in terms of therapeutic dosage or treatment satisfaction and drinking outcomes. These findings suggest that adolescents voluntarily attending a school-based intervention are able to effectively optimize their therapeutic dose and quickly utilize strategies taught in session. Understanding how non-specific treatment factors affect change efforts and drinking patterns can help tailor secondary interventions for adolescents with moderate alcohol histories by maximizing engagement, motivation, and possibly future help-seeking behaviors...|$|R
