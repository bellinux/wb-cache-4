The White House ordered Goss to purge agency officers who were disloyal to the administration. After Goss' appointment, many of the CIA's senior agents were fired or quit. <b>The</b> <b>CIA</b> <b>has</b> been accused of deliberately leaking classified information to undermine the 2004 election.|$|E
5|$|Early in the film, Hoffman {{explains}} to his superiors that the terrorists' retreat to pre-tech age communication methods renders useless the high specification tools the CIA uses, {{and increases the}} worth of Ferris's human intelligence methods. They avoid mobile telephones and computers, preferring face-to-face communication and encoded written messages. By contrast, the Americans use sophisticated communication (Hoffman and Ferris regularly speak on the phone) and surveillance (high altitude spy planes offer {{a different point of}} view throughout) technology. David Denby of The New Yorker said that this was Scott's suggestion that <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> <b>has</b> the technology but not the human intelligence to properly fight terrorism in the Middle East.|$|E

To <b>the</b> <b>CIA,</b> <b>the</b> Invasion <b>had</b> to occur before the end of February 2003 if their sources inside Hussein's government were to survive.

25|$|Whether the US or China is {{the third}} largest country by total area depends on two factors: (1) The {{validity}} of China's claim on Aksai Chin and Trans-Karakoram Tract.

25|$|Despite its {{domestic}} focus, the FBI also maintains a significant international footprint, operating 60 Legal Attache (LEGAT) offices and 15 sub-offices in U.S. {{embassies and consulates}} across the globe. These overseas offices exist primarily {{for the purpose of}} coordination with foreign security services and do not usually conduct unilateral operations in the host countries.

25|$|Before the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, the CIA Director {{concurrently}} {{served as}} the head of the Intelligence Community; today, the CIA is organized under the Director of National Intelligence (DNI).

25|$|Prior to July 14, 2003, Valerie Wilson's {{employment}} status was classified. Prior to that date, her {{affiliation with the}} CIA was not common knowledge outside the intelligence community.

25|$|Unlike the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), {{which is}} a {{domestic}} security service, <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> <b>has</b> no law enforcement function and is mainly focused on overseas intelligence gathering, with only limited domestic intelligence collection.

Moreover, the CIA is the only agency authorized by law to carry out and oversee covert action at the behest of the President. It exerts foreign political influence through its tactical divisions, such as the Special Activities Division.|$|E
