5|$|Operation Varsity was {{the last}} time that the Hamilcar would be used in combat, but the model did remain in service {{for a number of years}} after the end of the Second World War; they were {{particularly}} useful for transporting large and heavy loads. On 31 December 1945 64 Hamilcars were recorded as being present at RAF Tarrant Rushton, where they were used for routine training exercises. However, in January 1946 a process was begun to dispose of 'surplus' Hamilcars, with 44 moved to disposal facilities and twenty remaining. The remainder continued to be used for routine flying exercises until July, when six more were disposed of due to 'glue deterioration', and by February 1947 only twelve were left in operation. <b>These</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> Hamilcars appear to have remained in service until 1950, with several used in airshows and public displays by the RAF, and were ultimately phased out as obsolescent by the mid-1950s.|$|E

The box office receipts of <b>these</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> films had declined from previous Wisdom films but The Square Peg (1959), an army comedy, reversed the trend {{and was one of}} the year's biggest hits. The film was the 7th most popular movie at the British box office in 1959. Less successful was Follow a Star (1959). There Was a Crooked Man (1960) was an attempt to change Wisdom's image away from Rank Organisation. The Bulldog Breed (1960) was more conventional. Wisdom remained the 10th biggest star at the British box office.|$|E

Robert Canning of IGN called it [...] "very underwhelming" [...] and gave it an [...] "okay" [...] rating of 6.5 out of 10; he noted that competition episodes {{such as this one}} spend more time on performance, and deemed the non-performance segments [...] "blase". Rolling Stone Erica Futterman characterized [...] "the moral of this week's story: embrace your youth" [...] as [...] "overkill", but noted that once the competition began, the episode [...] "succeeded in spite of itself". Amy Reiter of The Los Angeles Times called it a [...] "feel-good episode" [...] that came as a [...] "huge relief" [...] after the show [...] "had lost its moral footing <b>these</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> weeks", and AOLTV Crystal Bell said it gave her [...] "some hope {{for the rest of the}} season".

500|$|The review {{aggregator}} website Comic Book Roundup {{reported a}} 7.3 out of 10 average rating for the event, based on 270 critic reviews. Just before {{the release of}} the final part, Jesse Schedeen of IGN stated, [...] ""Trinity War" [...] itself seems almost wholly disinterested in the Trinity of Sin, the Seven Deadly Sins, {{or any of the other}} elements the crossover was initially predicated upon." [...] After Justice League #23 was released, Schedeen added,"Event comics often fail because they're more concerned with setting up a new status quo and changing the playing field than simply allowing readers to savor the high stakes and epic nature of the conflict at hand. [...] "Trinity War" [...] may well emerge as the new poster child for everything wrong with that approach. In the end, [...] "Trinity War" [...] becomes little more than a stepping stone towards Forever Evil. The result is that Justice League #23 is an almost wholly unfulfilling [...] "finale" [...] issue." [...] Overall, Newsarama's Richard Gray praised the storytelling, with the event [...] "cleverly weaving in threads set up two years ago in all related titles." [...] However, Gray was somewhat critical of the fact that [...] "the last panel of “Trinity War” leads directly into “Forever Evil”, effectively making this one big event that begets another. It’s a crime that both major syndicates are repeatedly guilty of <b>these</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> years, one so commonplace that it is increasingly difficult to take umbrage with a singular instance anymore." [...] Comic Book Resources' Doug Zawisza felt [...] "there are no true conclusions of any sort" [...] after the whole event, [...] "just more shock-for-shock's sake moments and lots of new questions" [...] added at the end of Justice League #23. As with Gray, Zawisza [...] "was hopeful DC's tactic of bleeding events one to the next would be over following the relaunch, but this issue proves – without an inkling of doubt – that that is simply not the case." ...|$|E

2500|$|During {{the first}} several months of pregnancy, the {{nutritional}} requirements do not increase significantly since {{the rate of growth}} of the fetus is very slow. [...] However, during this time, the mare may be provided supplemental vitamins and minerals, particularly if forage quality is questionable. [...] During the last 3–4 months of gestation, rapid growth of the fetus increases the mare's nutritional requirements. Energy requirements during <b>these</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> months, and during {{the first few months of}} lactation are similar to those of a horse in full training.

2500|$|... "Donnie or Marie" [...] {{received}} positive reviews. Sean McKenna of TV Fanatic {{rated the}} episode 4.6 out of 5 stars and [...] "could barely move" [...] {{after watching the}} episode. [...] "There's still a sense of not really having any clue who killed Rosie, which may be extremely obnoxious to some and perfectly riveting to others.

[...] The A.V.

Instead of falling through the dramatic pauses, the momentum carries {{all the way through}} the finale." [...] William Bibbiani of CraveOnline was pleased to see an episode dedicated to the murder investigation. He stated: [...] "I've been saying throughout this season that The Killing would have to really step up its game in the last few episodes to make the last 11 episodes seem like they were worth the trouble, and while 'Donnie or Marie' is certainly a strong one, it's not so revelatory or dramatic that it forgives the failings of the season that precedes it. If every episode of the season was this good, The Killing would have been a much better series. But even then, it would need to really end with a glorified bang to justify the buildup." ...|$|E

He has overturned the balance of power in Europe. He has destroyed the last fortress of democracy in Eastern Europe which stood in the way of his ambition.

Another interesting result is that for decreasing revenues on fixed-to-mobile calls, collusion becomes more easily sustainable. Thus, a regulation which attempts to improve pricing efficiency can enhance the incentives to collude on the mobile market. JEL classification: L. 13, L. 41, L. 9...|$|R
