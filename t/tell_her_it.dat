500|$|Michael Pascua of The Huffington Post disliked Stevens' wig, writing: [...] "Izzie's wig looked horrible. She {{looked exactly}} like her mother Robbie and that's not a compliment. I loved Cristina's Stepford wife joke and how everyone, {{including}} Derek, couldn't help but stare at her hair. Yet, no one had the balls to <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>it</b> was bad." [...] Pascua also enjoyed Leigh's performance as Lexie, commenting: [...] "This was one episode I felt that Lexie was a genuine character. She still maintained that book-smart ability to repeat facts (like the merger cases) and shows a command of medical situations." [...] He too found Oh's bear voice comical, adding: [...] "I laughed when Cristina attempted to do her voice for Mr. Bear because you knew that she didn't {{know what she was}} doing." [...] Pascua was shocked with the departure of Utterbacks' character, writing: [...] "I can't believe that they cut Nurse Olivia. I understand that she wasn't really around, but having her as a tertiary character was nice. It was kind of ass-y of the chief not to personally tell these people that they were being cut, but it made Derek look really chivalrous." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{concept of}} using a neck {{massager}} for other than its stated purpose was popularized in 2002 in the fifth-season episode of the television series Sex and the City, [...] "Critical Condition". The character Samantha Jones goes to Sharper Image to buy a vibrator, but {{the staff at the}} store <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>it</b> is a neck massager. Shortly after being featured on Sex and the City, the Magic Wand sold out of stores. Journalist Naomi Wolf wrote in The Sunday Times that while researching for an article on the female-oriented sex toys catalogue Good Vibrations, she was informed that the Magic Wand had sold out from their stock because of its appearance on Sex and the City. The Rabbit vibrator had previously seen an increase in sales, after it was similarly popularized on the program in 1998. According to a contribution to Best Sex Writing 2013 by Andy Isaacson, these appearances of sex toys on Sex and the City revolutionized the way they were perceived culturally in the United States. The Times noted the Magic Wand was relatively new to the market in the United Kingdom, where it became available in 2004. The Magic Wand was number seven of the top ten hand-held massagers sold on Amazon.com. Faye Flam writing for Knight Ridder Newspapers reported in 2006 that the Magic Wand was exempt from anti-vibrator laws in Alabama, Georgia, and Texas because it {{did not appear to be}} a phallic object. In 2006 the device was among the top-selling masturbation aids in the market.|$|E

It comes out because Mark is sorting out Frank's life {{insurance}} {{and the insurance}} company wants {{to see all of}} his medical notes. Tricia is nervous that Mark will find Frank had a paternity test, so she gets all his records and gives them to Mark in a sealed envelope. But Mark says he needs to add a cover letter and opens the envelope anyway. Of course he sees Frank took the test and demands to know what's going on. Mark's furious. Tricia runs away and Mark's left to deal with the hideous realisation that Chrissie's not his daughter and that his dad was a rapist. Then to make matters worse, he has to work with Chrissie, pretending everything's normal. I know that if I were in his shoes, I certainly wouldn't <b>tell</b> <b>her.</b> <b>It</b> doesn't take much imagination to realise how devastating that kind of news would be for Chrissie. Mark loves her and, {{at the end of the}} day, that's all that counts." ...|$|E
