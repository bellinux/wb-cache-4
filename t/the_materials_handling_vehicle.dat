In its simplest form, worn by an operator, the sensory glove measures the force the wearer imposes on {{any part of}} <b>the</b> <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> robot or <b>the</b> object being maneuvered by <b>the</b> <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> robot. This measured force is then transmitted as radio frequency (RF) signals to the controller of <b>the</b> <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> robot, which in turn maneuvers the load so that the human operator only needs to exert {{a small portion of}} the force, leaving the actuator of the system to provide the remaining force required. Therefore, the actuators of <b>the</b> <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> system add exertion only in response to the operator's hand force on <b>the</b> <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> system, or on the object maneuvered by the robot.

40|$|Operation Allocation and <b>Material</b> <b>Handling</b> Systems Selection are {{important}} functions of a manufacturing system {{and as such}} must be considered within an integrated approach to manufacturing systems design. This work, an extension to the work done by Paulo (1999) proposes to integrate two important functions of manufacturing, i. e. operation allocation and <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> systems selection, and solve them iteratively. The objective of the operation allocation model is to select a group of machines where {{the operations of the}} part types will be performed and then to assign those operations to the selected machines. <b>The</b> <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> equipment is allocated by <b>the</b> <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> system selection model to transport a part type from one machine to the other for the next operation. The operation allocation model obtains one of its inputs from <b>the</b> <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> system selection model in <b>the</b> form of <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> equipment to be used for transporting a part type from one machine to another machine. The operation allocation model interfaces with <b>the</b> <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> system selection model by providing input data {{in the form of the}} manufacturing operations to be performed at each machining center. <b>The</b> <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> system is selected on the basis of the parts visiting a machining center to perform a manufacturing operation and the abilities of the handling devices to perform <b>the</b> required <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> functions of those part types. <b>The</b> <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> system selection model provides the feedback to the first model to complete the iteration.

40|$|The keen {{competition}} in industry puts {{a great deal}} of pressure upon all parts involved, and in addition to demands on the physical product, there are demands on the service aspects, such as an increased demand on the configuration of <b>the</b> delivered <b>materials</b> and their packaging, on throughput time, timeliness, and increased cost efficiency. The performance of <b>the</b> <b>materials</b> flow systems, in which <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> constitutes an important part, therefore plays a crucial part in the strive for competitive advantage. <b>The</b> <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> function contributes to the adding of value when, for example, mixing articles, packaging them as demanded by the customer, or orienting and positioning them for a later process step, as well as influences cost efficiency and throughput time. This thesis deals with the relation between the resources required for <b>the</b> <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> function and <b>the</b> design of <b>materials</b> flow systems and is directed towards the development of a method for evaluation and improvement of materials flow systems regarding the performance of <b>the</b> <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> function. <b>The</b> development of a conceptual framework for <b>the</b> perspective of <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> as contributing to the value added in materials flow systems is included as an important basis. An improved understanding of the purpose of <b>the</b> <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> function, as well as principles and procedures for how to utilise this knowledge to evaluate and improve the performance in terms of efficiency, is provided.

40|$|As {{a part of}} {{production}} logistics, <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> is concerned with <b>the</b> internal <b>material</b> flow, which consist of inventory management and transportation. The overall goal with <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> is to ensure the production system access to <b>material,</b> where <b>the</b> <b>handling</b> is to be performed without any damage to neither material nor personnel. In a manufacturing company, a sufficient part of the total production cost can be directly derived from internal <b>materials</b> <b>handling.</b> According to Lean Production both transportation and inventory {{should be considered as}} waste. Therefore, it is important to improve the efficiency of <b>the</b> internal <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> system, though it must not be on the expense of the delivery precision or compromising the safety. The study assumes that <b>the</b> <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> system is supposed to provide the productions system with <b>the</b> right <b>materials,</b> in <b>the</b> right quantity, at the right time, and doing so in cost effective manner. The purpose with this study is to identify and analyze <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> in order to develop and present recommendations for a safer and more cost efficient <b>materials</b> <b>handling,</b> with preserved delivery precision. The study is a case study, which has been conducted on site at Sandvik Mining in Sandviken. Sandvik Mining produces drill bits, drill rods and adapters, which are used for rock drilling. The data collection has been done through interviews and observations, where the authors have been interviewing employees from Sandvik Mining as well as conducting direct observations of the processes within the field of study. The study was complemented by a literature review, where the most influential fields of study where <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> and Lean Production. The report presents a map of current material transportation flows within Sandvik Mining as well as how the management of these flows is conducted. From the map, problem areas have been identified and the underlying cause of these can be derived from the variations within the working methods. The variations occur due to <b>the</b> fact <b>the</b> <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> system does not meet the six aspects of <b>the</b> <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> equation, namely: why, what, where, when and how materials should be transported as well as by who the transportation should performed. In order to create an effective <b>materials</b> <b>handling,</b> <b>the</b> study presents recommendations that aims to define and standardize <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> activities, which could be done by material-dedicated buffer zones. The study claims that these material-dedicated buffer zones would serve as reference points for <b>the</b> <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> system, and based on which, it is possible to define <b>the</b> different <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> activities. <b>The</b> buffer zones can also provide necessary control to <b>the</b> <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> system {{as well as to the}} production system.

Model checking is a formal method that automatically verifies whether a system meets its specification by exhaustively analyzing {{a model of the}} corresponding system. To achieve a model of <b>the</b> <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> system, a modeling methodology has been developed and is introduced in this thesis.

In order to also verify large and complex <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> systems, a compositional approach is proposed.

40|$|Background: <b>Material</b> <b>handling</b> is a {{large part}} of a company´s {{internal}} work and represents between 15 % and 70 % of the total cost of a manufactured product. By improving <b>the</b> internal <b>handling</b> of <b>material,</b> more efficient distribution and manufacturing flows are possible. <b>The</b> <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> process is an input to the production and assembly process that has to be defined and mapped {{so that it can be}} improved. <b>The</b> <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> process studied at Volvo CE Braås includes goods receiving, storage, packaging as well as the order/delivery process to assembly, and will finish with <b>the</b> <b>material</b> transport to <b>the</b> assembly line. Research questions: How can <b>the</b> <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> process, from goods receiving to assembly line, at Volvo CE in Braås be described by using VSM? What kinds of waste can be identified? By proposing a future-state map, how can the identified problems and waste be reduced or eliminated? Methodology: This thesis is a descriptive case study and was conducted with a deductive approach.

The hybrid DMFC system V 3. 3 - 2 comprises an in active serial connected 1. 0 kW DMFC system and a 45 Ah lithium-ion high-power battery pack. This hybrid system replaces the battery tray of a class 3 forklift truck and can supply a peak load of 7 kW. The advantages of this energy-supply module compared to conventional lead-acid batteries are its higher range (24 h use with a 20 L methanol canister instead of 8 h with battery recharging) and its higher availability (a few minutes are required to exchange methanol canisters instead of hours to recharge the battery). However, {{in order to ensure}} that use of the DMFC system V 3. 3 - 2 is economic, the DMFC stack must have a durability of at least 10, 000 h.
