5|$|Adventure was {{conceived}} as a graphical version of the 1977 text adventure Colossal Cave Adventure. It took developer Warren Robinett approximately one year to design and code the game, during which time he had to overcome a variety of technical limitations in the Atari 2600 console hardware, as well as difficulties with management within Atari. In this game, he introduced the first widely known video game Easter egg, a secret room containing text crediting himself for the game's creation. Robinett's Easter egg became a <b>tradition</b> <b>for</b> future Atari 2600 titles.|$|E
5|$|Among the insects, in both Japan and Europe, as {{far back}} as ancient Greece and Rome, a {{butterfly}} was seen as the personification of a person's soul, both while they were alive and after their death.

5|$|During the 43 {{nomination}} years, 67 {{people have}} been given the Life Achievement Award. Multiple winners have been awarded 20 times, typically two co-winners, though five were noted in 1984. Since 2000 it has become an unofficial <b>tradition</b> <b>for</b> two winners to be announced, often with one winner primarily an author and the other not. While most winners have been authors and editors, five winners have been primarily artists of fantasy art and book covers, and three winners are best known for founding or running publishing houses that produce fantasy works.|$|E

Due to the relative lack of interest in winter sport in Australia, both Camplin and Bradbury had been without sponsorship before their Olympic triumphs, and were effectively broke.|$|E

5|$|On August 12, 1937, Roosevelt {{nominated}} Black to {{fill the}} vacancy. By tradition, a senator nominated for an executive or judicial office was confirmed immediately and without debate. However, when Black was nominated, the Senate departed from this <b>tradition</b> <b>for</b> {{the first time since}} 1853; instead of confirming him immediately, it referred the nomination to the Judiciary Committee. Black was criticized for his presumed bigotry, his cultural roots, and his Klan membership, when that became public.|$|E

5|$|Organisation Générale des Amateurs de l'Eurovision (more {{commonly}} known as OGAE) is an international organisation that was founded in 1984 in Savonlinna, Finland by Jari-Pekka Koikkalainen.

In what has become an annual <b>tradition</b> <b>for</b> the OGAE fan clubs, a voting poll was opened allowing members from forty clubs to vote for their favourite songs of the 2014 contest. Below is the top five overall results, after all the votes had been cast.|$|E
5|$|Seasons {{may play}} a role in some regions. A {{dramatic}} change in colour and texture is created by seasonal snowy conditions in northern latitudes, necessitating repainting of vehicles and separate snow oversuits. The Eastern and northern European countries have a <b>tradition</b> <b>for</b> separate winter uniforms rather than oversuits. During the Second World War, the Waffen-SS went a step further, developing reversible uniforms with separate schemes for summer and autumn, as well as white winter oversuits.|$|E

5|$|Until the 18th century, Lipizzans {{had other}} coat colors, {{including}} dun, bay, chestnut, black, piebald and skewbald. However, gray is a dominant gene. Gray {{was the color}} preferred by the royal family, and so the color was emphasized in breeding practices. Thus, in a small breed population when the color was deliberately selected as a desirable feature, {{it came to be}} the color of the overwhelming majority of Lipizzan horses. However, it is a long-standing <b>tradition</b> <b>for</b> the Spanish Riding School to have at least one bay Lipizzan stallion in residence, and this tradition is continued through the present day.|$|E
5|$|A {{ceremony}} is held each October 13 at the outfield wall in Oakland {{to listen to}} a taped broadcast of the final game of the 1960 World Series. The tradition was started by Squirrel Hill resident Saul Finkelstein, who at 1:05 pm on October 13, 1985, sat alone {{at the base of the}} flagpole and listened to the NBC radio broadcast of Chuck Thompson and Jack Quinlan. Finkelstein continued the <b>tradition</b> <b>for</b> eight more years, until word spread and other people began attending in 1993. On October 13, 2000—the game's 40th anniversary—over 600people attended to listen to the broadcast, including Mazeroski himself. For the 50th anniversary, on October 13, 2010, a plaque honoring Mazeroski was dedicated and more than 1,000 attended the broadcast, including Mazeroski and several other former Pirates.|$|E
5|$|During a {{game against}} the Canucks on March 8, 2004, Canucks player Todd Bertuzzi punched Colorado's Steve Moore from behind, leaving Moore unconscious. It was said to be {{retaliation}} for a hit Moore had delivered to Canucks captain Markus Naslund the month before. Because of the punch and the consequent fall on the ice with Bertuzzi on top of him, and numerous other players from both teams piling on top, Moore sustained three fractured neck vertebrae, among other injuries, that ended his career. Bertuzzi was away from professional hockey for 17 months as a result of suspensions. In Denver, ever since the Moore hit, it has become <b>tradition</b> <b>for</b> the home fans to boo Todd Bertuzzi every time he gains possession of the puck, whenever his team faces the Avalanche at Pepsi Center.|$|E

Turning to academia, from 1980 to 1985 he studied for a bachelor's degree in Classical archaeology at Hunter College, which he followed up with a master's degree in the subject at Bryn Mawr College from 1985 to 1988. Buczynski was diagnosed with HIV/AIDS in 1988, and died from a related Toxoplasma gondii infection the following year, converting to Roman Catholicism briefly beforehand. In 2012, the practicing Pagan Michael G. Lloyd published a biography of Buczynski entitled Bull of Heaven.|$|E
5|$|Mesopotamian {{religion}} recognizes {{literally thousands}} of deities, and distinct iconographies have been identified for about a dozen. Less frequently, gods are identified by a written label or dedication; such labels would only have been intended for the literate elites. In creating a religious object, the sculptor was not free to create novel images: the representation of deities, their attributes and context were as much part of the religion as the rituals and the mythology. Indeed, innovation and deviation from an accepted canon {{could be considered a}} cultic offense. The large degree of similarity that is found in plaques and seals suggests that detailed iconographies could have been based on famous cult statues; they established the visual <b>tradition</b> <b>for</b> such derivative works but have now been lost. It appears, though, that the Burney Relief was the product of such a tradition, not its source, since its composition is unique.|$|E
5|$|Senators {{are elected}} in even-numbered {{years when the}} President of the United States is not being elected, similar to most other state offices in Maryland. The most recent {{election}} was in November 2014. Senators are not term-limited. Should a Senator resign from office before his or her term expires, the local central committee of the party to which the retiring senator belonged makes a recommendation to the Governor for whom to appoint to the open seat. It is <b>tradition</b> <b>for</b> the Governor to appoint the recommended person. Four of the current members of the Maryland State Senate were originally appointed, two of whom have since been elected in their own right. Newly elected Senators are sworn in and begin work on the second Wednesday of the January following their election.|$|E
