40|$|Introduction: The <b>tuberculin</b> <b>test</b> is {{the most}} common method used for the {{detection}} and control of bovine tuberculosis (TB). Specificity and sensitivity of this <b>tuberculin</b> <b>test</b> is low, so it is better to perform another test in parallel for investigation of the disease. The ELISA test is user friendly, so it can be an appropriate test for performing in parallel with the <b>tuberculin</b> <b>test</b> for an accurate detection. The aim of this study is the development of an ELISA test (kit) based on proteins smaller than 10 kDa (specially ESAT- 6) for the detection of TB in cattle. Materials and Methods: Proteins lower than 10 kDa M. W. were isolated from sonicated bacteria and were precipitated with ammonium sulfate. Protein assay was done after dialysis. Then a checkerboard was done for the determination of the best concentration of antigens and antibodies. There were 114 serum samples that were isolated; 100 cows that three continual <b>tuberculin</b> <b>tests</b> were negative and 14 serum samples were positive (in the <b>tuberculin</b> <b>test).</b> Culture and PCR were done from lymph nodes (or tissues) of tuberculin positive cows. Stability was investigated on days 0, 1, 3, 5 and 7 in 37 °C. Results: The best concentration of antigens and antibodies were acquired 200 ng and 1 / 100 respectively. All of the 100 samples that were negative in the <b>tuberculin</b> <b>tests</b> were negative in this ELISA kit as well, but out of 14 samples that were positive in the <b>tuberculin</b> <b>test,</b> just 8 samples were positive in the ELISA kit. Meanwhile, the results of culture and PCR were compatible with the ELISA kit's results. There was a variation of less than 10 % between days 0 and 7 at 37 °C that shows at least 1 year stability of this kit in refrigerator temperatures (4 – 8 °C). Conclusion: Performing the ELISA test based on ESAT- 6 antigen shows that this test can be a suitable way for screening beside the <b>tuberculin</b> <b>test</b> for accurate detection. It is noticed that the specificity of the ELISA test was determined more than the <b>tuberculin</b> <b>test,</b> especially since the culture and PCR are gold standards. Therefore, incorrect sampling can change the specificity of the <b>tuberculin</b> <b>test.</b> The results of this kit can encourage designing of an ELISA kit for the detection of human TB...|$|R

40|$|In {{a housing}} estate {{population}} {{with a high}} prevalence of tuberculosis, the authors conducted tuberculosis screening with the <b>tuberculin</b> <b>test,</b> and an investigation with three purposes: evaluation of tuberculosis infection (defined as > 10 mm on <b>tuberculin</b> <b>test),</b> evaluation of BCG effect on <b>tuberculin</b> <b>test,</b> and evaluation of BCG efficacy. The data was collected by nurses during the screening and completed with observation of vaccination records in a health center. The diagnosis of tuberculosis was done by local specialized health services. The statistical significance was tested with Chi Square and Fisher Tests. Vaccine efficacy was calculated {{on the basis of}} relative risk of contracting tuberculosis according to vaccination status. The authors <b>tested</b> <b>tuberculin</b> reactivity on 396 persons - 53. 5 % of whole population resident in the neighbourhood. The infection was more prevalent in the 15 - 44 -years-old group (31. 2 %), in males (25. 9 %) and black population (30. 5 %). Only the differences between age groups were statistically significant. After the discussion of probable bias, the authors conclude that BCG does not convert the <b>tuberculin</b> <b>test</b> significantly when the cutpoint is of 10 mm, in a high prevalent tuberculosis population. Therefore, the <b>tuberculin</b> <b>test</b> could be a good diagnostic test for infection, even in vaccinated groups.

Three hundred-fifty cattle from two TB-free and two TB-infected herds were submitted to the comparative <b>tuberculin</b> <b>test</b> and the INFg assay. The comparative <b>tuberculin</b> <b>test</b> was performed using avian and bovine PPD. The INFg assay was performed by the BovigamTM kit (CSL Veterinary, Australia), according to the manufacturer's specifications.

40|$|Background. Repeat <b>tuberculin</b> skin <b>tests</b> may {{be false}} {{positive}} due to boosting of waned immunity to past mycobacterial exposure. We evaluated whether an ELISPOT test could identify tuberculosis (TB) contacts with boosting of immunity to nontuberculous mycobacterial exposure. Methodology/Principal Findings. We conducted <b>tuberculin</b> and ELISPOT <b>tests</b> in 1665 TB contacts: 799 were <b>tuberculin</b> <b>test</b> negative and were offered a repeat test after three months. Those with <b>tuberculin</b> <b>test</b> conversion had an ELISPOT, chest X-ray and sputum analysis if appropriate. We compared converters with non-converters, assessed {{the probability of}} each of four combinations of ELISPOT results over the two time points and estimated boosting with adjustment for ELISPOT sensitivity and specificity. 704 (72 %) contacts had a repeat tuberculin test; 176 (25 %) had test conversion, which increased with exposure to a case (p = 0. 002), increasing age (p = 0. 0006) and BCG scar (p = 0. 06). 114 <b>tuberculin</b> <b>test</b> converters had ELISPOT results: 16 (14 %) were recruitment positive/follow-up positive, 9 (8 %) positive/negative, 34 (30 %) negative/positive, and 55 (48 %) were negative/negative. There was a significant non-linear effect of age for ELISPOT results in skin test converters (p = 0. 038). Estimates of boosting ranged from 32 %– 41 % of skin test converters with increasing age. Three converters were diagnosed with TB, two had ELISPOT results: both were positive, including one at recruitment. Conclusions/Significance. We estimate that approximately one third of <b>tuberculin</b> skin <b>test</b> conversion in Gambian TB case contacts is due to boosting of immunity to non-tuberculous mycobacterial exposure.

As trace-back of all imported and in-contact deer was not possible, a control program, based on <b>tuberculin</b> <b>testing,</b> was implemented in July 1994.

40|$|In {{assessing}} the biological activity of BCG vaccine by <b>tuberculin</b> <b>testing</b> of vaccinated guinea-pigs, {{it is necessary}} {{to take into account the}} rates of development and waning of allergy, and also the boosting effect on waning allergy caused by the tuberculin test itself. Using Danish liquid vaccine (in approximately standard dose), the authors have carried out two series of tests, involving more than six hundred guinea-pigs, to evaluate the significance of these factors. Post-vaccination tuberculin sensitivity was found to reach a maximum within 1 - 2 months. Three months after vaccination the BCG-induced allergy began to wane, and after 12 months it had dropped almost to the level observed in non-vaccinated guinea-pigs. The tuberculin test had a strong boosting effect, however, and even 12 months after vaccination the waning sensitivity could be considerably increased by a single injection of 10 TU of tuberculin. An analysis of the results showed that the waning of the level of allergy takes place gradually over several months. This is not an effect of aging, however, as the response to vaccination was found to be independent of the age of the animals.
