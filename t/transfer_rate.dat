5|$|The USB 3.0 {{specification}} {{was published}} on 12 November 2008. Its main goals were {{to increase the}} data <b>transfer</b> <b>rate</b> (up to 5Gbit/s), decrease power consumption, increase power output, and be backward compatible with USB 2.0. USB 3.0 includes a new, higher speed bus called SuperSpeed in parallel with the USB 2.0 bus. For this reason, the new version is also called SuperSpeed. The first USB 3.0 equipped devices were presented in January 2010.|$|E
5|$|The USB2.0 {{specification}} {{was released}} in April 2000 and was ratified by the USB Implementers Forum (USB-IF) {{at the end of}} 2001. Hewlett-Packard, Intel, Lucent Technologies (now Nokia), NEC, and Philips jointly led the initiative to develop a higher data <b>transfer</b> <b>rate,</b> with the resulting specification achieving 480Mbit/s, 40 times as fast as the original USB 1.1 specification.|$|E

30|$|The {{presented}} implementation obtained <b>transfer</b> <b>rates</b> on {{the order}} of magnitude of Gbps. At 150 MHz, the communication bus achieved <b>transfer</b> <b>rates</b> of up to 4.76 Gbps. Although the obtained data <b>transfer</b> <b>rates</b> were satisfactory, the use of LVDS pins would certainly provide higher data <b>transfer</b> <b>rates.</b> Taking the data presented in [6] as reference, if it was possible to instantiate 32 lanes on the communication bus, each one with rates of 625 Mbps, {{it would be possible to}} obtain transfers up to 20 Gbps.|$|R
25|$|Memory {{manufacturers}} {{stated that}} it was impractical to mass-produce DDR1 memory with effective <b>transfer</b> <b>rates</b> in excess of 400MHz (i.e. 400 MT/s and 200MHz external clock) due to internal speed limitations. DDR2 picks up where DDR1 leaves off, utilizing internal clock rates similar to DDR1, but is available at effective <b>transfer</b> <b>rates</b> of 400MHz and higher. DDR3 advances extended the ability to preserve internal clock rates while providing higher effective <b>transfer</b> <b>rates</b> by again doubling the prefetch depth.|$|R
5|$|The eSATA {{connector}} is a {{more robust}} SATA connector, intended for connection to external hard drives and SSDs. eSATA's <b>transfer</b> <b>rate</b> (up to 6Gbit/s) {{is similar to that}} of USB3.0 (up to 5Gbit/s on current devices; 10Gbit/s speeds via USB3.1, announced on 31 July 2013). A device connected by eSATA appears as an ordinary SATA device, giving both full performance and full compatibility associated with internal drives.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Titan used Jaguar's 10 PB of Lustre storage with a {{transfer}} speed of 240 GB/s, but in April 2013, the storage was upgraded to 40 PB with a <b>transfer</b> <b>rate</b> of 1.4 TB/s. GPUs {{were selected for}} their vastly higher parallel processing efficiency over CPUs. Although the GPUs have a slower clock speed than the CPUs, each GPU contains 2,688 CUDA cores at 732 MHz, resulting in a faster overall system. Consequently, the CPUs' cores are used to allocate tasks to the GPUs rather than directly processing the data as in conventional supercomputers.|$|E
5|$|These {{and other}} {{differences}} reflect the differing design {{goals of the}} two buses: USB was designed for simplicity and low cost, while FireWire was designed for high performance, particularly in time-sensitive applications such as audio and video. Although similar in theoretical maximum <b>transfer</b> <b>rate,</b> FireWire400 is faster than USB2.0 high-bandwidth in real-use, especially in high-bandwidth use such as external hard drives. The newer FireWire800 standard is {{twice as fast as}} FireWire400 and faster than USB2.0 high-bandwidth both theoretically and practically. However, FireWire's speed advantages rely on low-level techniques such as direct memory access (DMA), which in turn have created opportunities for security exploits such as the DMA attack.|$|E

5|$|Once {{the filming}} was completed, more than 20 two-hour Beta SP video tapes of footage {{had to be}} edited down to fit {{the actions of the}} game. The {{programming}} included editing the original video footage, and mixing the rendered images of doors, drawers, chairs and other objects into the footage frame-by-frame, which was necessary for more than 100 scenes. The game required more polishing and fine-tuning than most games of its time due to the many video components, and the programmers had to determine the desired frame rate, data <b>transfer</b> <b>rate</b> and desired resolution of the video elements. Another challenge for the game was CD resource management. Since many of the scenes in the game could be repeated in multiple chapters, some pieces of the code were written onto several different CDs {{to reduce the number of}} times the player had to swap discs in the middle of a chapter, an unusual practice for computer games at the time. The final game was on seven discs, a large number for a computer game, and more than the four or five discs originally expected.|$|E
25|$|Goodput or data <b>transfer</b> <b>rate</b> {{refers to}} the {{achieved}} average net bit rate that is delivered to the application layer, exclusive of all protocol overhead, data packets retransmissions, etc. For example, {{in the case of}} file transfer, the goodput corresponds to the achieved file <b>transfer</b> <b>rate.</b> The file <b>transfer</b> <b>rate</b> in bit/s can be calculated as the file size (in bytes) divided by the file transfer time (in seconds) and multiplied by eight.|$|E
25|$|HDD data <b>transfer</b> <b>rate</b> {{depends upon}} the {{rotational}} speed of the platters and the data recording density. Because heat and vibration limit rotational speed, advancing density becomes the main method to improve sequential transfer rates. Higher speeds require a more powerful spindle motor, which creates more heat. While areal density advances by increasing both the number of tracks across the disk {{and the number of}} sectors per track, only the latter increases the data <b>transfer</b> <b>rate</b> for a given rpm. Since data <b>transfer</b> <b>rate</b> performance tracks only one of the two components of areal density, its performance improves at a lower rate.|$|E

25|$|With data being {{transferred}} 64 bits at a time, DDR SDRAM gives a <b>transfer</b> <b>rate</b> (in bytes/s) of (memory bus clock rate) × 2 (for dual rate) × 64 (number of bits transferred) / 8 (number of bits/byte). Thus, with a bus frequency of 100MHz, DDR SDRAM gives a maximum <b>transfer</b> <b>rate</b> of 1600MB/s.|$|E

25|$|The primary {{benefit of}} DDR3 SDRAM over its {{immediate}} predecessor, DDR2 SDRAM, {{is its ability}} to transfer data at twice the rate (eight times the speed of its internal memory arrays), enabling higher bandwidth or peak data rates. With two transfers per cycle of a quadrupled clock signal, a 64-bit wide DDR3 module may achieve a <b>transfer</b> <b>rate</b> (in megabytes per second, MB/s) of up to 64 times the memory clock speed (in MHz). With data being transferred 64 bits at a time per memory module, DDR3 SDRAM gives a <b>transfer</b> <b>rate</b> of (memory clock rate) × 4 (for bus clock multiplier) × 2 (for data rate) × 64 (number of bits transferred) / 8 (number of bits/byte). Thus with a memory clock frequency of 100MHz, DDR3 SDRAM gives a maximum <b>transfer</b> <b>rate</b> of 6400 MB/s.|$|E
30|$|In general, the <b>transfer</b> <b>rates</b> are {{not known}} when the IL-RR {{approach}} is used. If all of the <b>transfer</b> <b>rates</b> are known, the projection matrices can be found from Eq. (7), and the projections carried out directly. In that case, Intrinsic Linkages are generally not present, as the implicit parameter w values are likely not constant over all states and across a sequence of arbitrary rate matrices. The IL-RR approach, by imposing a constant w, allows projections to be made without knowledge of the <b>transfer</b> <b>rates.</b> The relationships between the τ’s and the rates then contribute to the solutions for the rates.|$|R

40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} to measure heat <b>transfer</b> <b>rates</b> and mass <b>transfer</b> <b>rates</b> from a water surface {{in the presence of}} electrostatic fields of various strengths generated between the water surface and a wire grid above the surface. Heat <b>transfer</b> <b>rates</b> were determined by the temperature decay after heating the test and control basins. Mass <b>transfer</b> <b>rates</b> were determined by measuring the water loss while holding the basins at fixed temperatures. It was found that very little increase in transfer coefficients took place for voltages below an onset voltage which depended on atmospheric conditions and test geometry. The heat transfer coefficient increased for voltages above the onset voltage reaching factors of three to four times the natural <b>rate.</b> The mass <b>transfer</b> coefficient also increased similar amounts for voltages above the onset voltage. The functional dependence of the increased heat and mass <b>transfer</b> <b>rates</b> on grid voltage agreed with theory developed for heat transfer from plates without mass transfer.

40|$|Condensation, a {{two-phase}} {{heat transfer}} processes, is commonly utilized in industrial systems. Condensation heat transfer can be optimized by using surfaces in which dropwise condensation (DWC) occurs, and even further optimized using superhydrophobic surfaces. For superhydrophobic condensation, a structured silicon surface with pillars 2. 1 p. m tall, 200 nm in diameter, and a 400 nm pitch was tested. By removing noncondensable gases (NCG) {{from the system}} {{by means of a}} steam trap, the heat <b>transfer</b> <b>rates</b> of DWC and SHC were found to be greater than that of filmwise condensation (FWC) by a factor of 2, but indistinguishable from each other. The effect of NCG leads to a 5 x reduction in heat <b>transfer</b> <b>rates</b> for both DWC and SHC. DWC heat <b>transfer</b> <b>rates</b> are as much as 50 kW/m 2 less than FWC at the same temperature difference, representing a 25 % reduction. However, the SHC heat <b>transfer</b> <b>rates</b> remain above those of FWC by as much as 50 kW/m² at the same temperature difference, representing a 20 % improvement. These studies suggest that SHC may be a useful passive method to improve condensation heat <b>transfer</b> <b>rates</b> in the presence of NCG. However, {{it remains to be seen}} if SHC can provide better heat <b>transfer</b> <b>rates</b> than DWC under saturated steam conditions. by Travis M. Hery. Thesis (S. B.)
