The words 'Put me back on my bike!' were invented by Sid Saltmarsh, covering the event for The Sun and Cycling– now Cycling Weekly. Saltmarsh was not there at the time and was in a reception black-spot for live accounts on Radio Tour. Simpson managed to ride a further [...] before he began to wobble. He was held upright by three spectators who then helped him to the ground on side of the road. He was unconscious with his hands locked to the handlebars. Hall shouted for the other mechanic, Ken Ryall, to pry them loose and the pair laid the lifeless Simpson beside the road. Hall and a nurse from the Tour's medical team took turns giving Simpson mouth-to-mouth resuscitation before Dumas came with an oxygen mask.|$|E
500|$|As {{the race}} reached the lower slopes of Ventoux, Simpson's team {{mechanic}} Harry Hall, witnessed Simpson, still ill, putting the lid {{back on his}} water bottle as he exited a building. Race commissaire (official), Jacques Lohmuller, later confirmed to Hall that he also saw the incident and that Simpson was putting brandy in his bottle. Near the summit of Ventoux, the peloton began to fracture. Simpson was in the front group before slipping back {{to a group of}} chasers about a minute behind. He then began losing control of his bike, zig-zagging across the road. A kilometre from the summit, Simpson fell off his bike. Team manager Alec Taylor and Hall arrived in the team car to help him. Hall tried to persuade Simpson to stop, saying: [...] "Come on Tom, that's it, that's your Tour finished", but Simpson said he wanted to continue. Taylor said, [...] "If Tom wants to go on, he goes".

50|$|One {{form of the}} {{platform}} pedal had a large flat top area and flat bottom for use with toe clips and <b>toe</b> <b>straps.</b> They were designed for greater comfort when using shoes with less than rigid soles. They typically had a smaller cutaway underside giving greater cornering clearance, which was often needed for track cycling. They were often marketed as being more aerodynamic than conventional quill pedals.|$|E
50|$|Many boats, {{especially}} dinghies, have {{equipment that}} facilitates effective hiking. Hiking straps (<b>toe</b> <b>straps)</b> made from rope or webbing hold the sailor's feet down, {{allowing them to}} lean back over the gunwale of the boat while sitting facing in. These simple devices are almost universal on dinghies {{that do not have}} more complex hiking systems. Some sailors wear special shorts fitted with pads or stiff battens to help them hike more effectively and without tiring.|$|E
50|$|In sailing, hiking ({{stacking}} or stacking out in New Zealand) is {{the action}} of moving the crew's body weight as far to windward (upwind) as possible, in order to decrease the extent the boat heels (leans away from the wind). By moving the crew's weight to windward, the moment of that force around the boat's center of buoyancy is increased. This opposes the heeling moment of the wind pushing sideways against the boat's sails. It is usually done by leaning {{over the edge of}} the boat as it heels. Some boats are fitted with equipment such as hiking straps (or <b>toe</b> <b>straps)</b> and trapezes to make hiking more effective.|$|E
5000|$|Crampons are {{fastened}} to footwear {{by means of}} a binding system.

50|$|During the 1930s it was {{discovered}} that an improvement could be made by removing the <b>toe</b> <b>strap</b> from a typical Kandahar binding. Instead, the metal cup was bent inward to slightly wrap {{over the top of the}} boot, or at least the top of the sole. Although the resulting clip was much less solid than the strap, in the case of a forward fall the boot would rotate up and out of the cup, releasing the leg. Although this was an improvement, it was a small one.|$|R

These differ from the sandals worn by the Mesopotamians, with the strap between the third and fourth toes. In India, a related chappal ("toe knob") sandal was common, with no straps but a small knob sitting {{between the first and}} second toes. They are known as Padukas ...|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} days, the Züri-Metzgete was {{dominated}} by home riders with the race being won on 34 occasions by the Swiss in the first 41 editions of the race between 1914 and 1956. The most notable foreign winner in this period was Gino Bartali. In 1946, the Italian beat arch rival Fausto Coppi in a contentious race, the two Italians rode together at a breakneck pace shaking off all their rivals with Bartali winning in controversial circumstances, sprinting away while Coppi was tightening his <b>toe</b> <b>straps.</b> Many people say this incident {{was the start of}} the “war” between Bartali and Coppi. That 1946 race was won at an average speed of 42.228 km/h, a record speed which stood for over 50 years. Spaniard Juan Antonio Flecha won the 2004 edition of the race in a record average speed of 42.707 km/h.|$|E
5000|$|However, on {{the soles}} of the hearty ladies and gentlemen who lived along the St John and Kennebecasis Rivers, there was a {{different}} type of skate. They used the famous [...] "Long Reachers". Around the year 1870, James A. Whelpley patented the [...] "Long Reach Speed Skates". Whelpley's skate factory was located at Jones Creek, on the Long Reach. Here, he turned out skates that became famous all over the continent. The skate had a blade seventeen inches long.The [...] "woods" [...] of the skates, at the widest point, measured less than an inch and a half. A screw protruded up a half an inch at this point. The skates were firmly attached with heel and <b>toe</b> <b>straps</b> made of heavy leather."Long reachers" [...] were ideally suited for the long expanse of the St John and Kennebecasis Rivers. A man on these skates could travel long distances in {{a relatively short period of}} time. From Saint John to Fredericton, by the way of the St John River, is a distance of about eighty miles. It was not uncommon for an able-bodied young man to skate this distance in a little under seven hours.|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} days of skiing the binding was also similar to those of a {{contemporary}} snowshoe, generally consisting of a leather strap fastened over the toe of the boot. In the 1800s, skiing evolved into a sport and the <b>toe</b> <b>strap</b> was replaced by a metal clip under the toe. This provided much greater grip on the boot, allowing the ski to be pushed sideways. The heel strap also changed over time; in order to allow a greater range of motion, a spring was added to allow the strap to lengthen when the boot was rotated up off the ski.|$|R
50|$|Downhill skiing only {{developed}} as a separate sport after {{the introduction of the}} ski lift. Prior to this, almost all skiing involved a mix of cross-country, downhill and even uphill skiing. For cross-country, the efficient striding motion requires the heel of the boot to lift from the ski, allowing the leg to lag behind the body as the other ski is moved forward. In the late 1880s, a number of bindings using a leather <b>strap</b> over the <b>toe</b> and a second one pulling the boot forward under the <b>toe</b> <b>strap</b> were common. These kept the toe of the boot on the ski, while allowing the heel to rise some distance.|$|R

40|$|Laser class sailors have to hike out, i. e. hook {{their feet}} under the <b>toe</b> <b>straps</b> near the {{centreline}} {{of the boat}} and hold their upper bodies {{over the edge of the}} boat, to counteract the heeling forces generated by the sails. To identify the parameters that are associated with maximal hiking performance, this cross-sectional observational study measures various knee extensor and hip flexor muscle performance characteristics in 55 Laser sailors and correlates each with the area-under-the-curve hiking moment over 3 min of hiking on a hiking dynamometer (HM 180). Our results showed that higher body mass and HM 180 were significantly associated with better race scores (Spearman&# 039;s rho = - 0. 69 and - 0. 62, respectively, both P or = 0. 95, P or = 0. 80, P or = 0. 80, P < 0. 01 in both males and females) were associated with a higher HM 180. The correlations between height, abdominal muscle endurance (crunches), explosive lower body strength (vertical jumps), cycling time-to-exhaustion, quadriceps strength endurance, or isometric quadriceps endurance with incremental loads (bucket test), and HM 180 were weaker (r < 0. 60). HM 180 may be a useful performance indicator for Laser racing. Since strength measures correlated well with HM 180, greater emphasis should be placed on developing maximum strength in the quadriceps to improve maximal hiking performance...|$|E
5000|$|... 1897: Huitfeldt further {{improved}} the design {{by changing the}} toe piece. Instead of hooks, he drilled a rectangular hole through the ski from side to side, and passed an iron bar through it. The bar was then bent up on either side, locking it in place, and then formed to fit the toe of the boot. This improvement once again dramatically {{improved the}} firmness of the fit. Finally, in 1904 he adopted the Hoyer-Ellefsen toggle, a lever that replaced the buckles. This not only greatly improved mechanical advantage, further improving {{the strength of the}} binding, but also made the system much easier to put on and remove. Better yet, the geometry of the attachment points meant the heel strap was mechanically attached below that of the <b>toe</b> <b>strap,</b> which provided a constant [...] "diagonal downpull" [...] that naturally returned the heel to the ski.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis study {{focuses on}} soft boot {{snowboard}} bindings {{by looking at}} how users interact with their binding and proposes a possible solution to overcome such issues. Snowboarding is a multibillion-dollar sport that has only reached mainstream in the last 30 years its levels of progression in technology have evolved in that time. However, snowboard bindings {{for the most part}} still consist of the same basic architecture in the last 20 years. This study was aimed at taking a user centric point of view and using additive manufacturing technologies to be able to generate a new snowboard binding that is completely adaptable to the user. The initial part of the study was a survey of 280 snowboarders focussing on preferences, style and habits. This survey was generated from over 15 nations with the vast majority of boarders on the snow for five to fifty days a year. Significant emphasis was placed on the relationship between boarder binding set-up and occurrence of pain and/or injury. From the detailed survey it was found that boarder's experienced pain in the front foot/toe area as a result from the <b>toe</b> <b>strap</b> being too tight. However boarders wanted tighter bindings to increase responsiveness. Survey data was compared to ankle and foot biomechanics to build a relationship to assess the problem of pain versus responsiveness. The design stage {{of the study was to}} develop a binding that overcame the over-tightening of the binding but still maintain equivalent or better responsiveness compared to traditional bindings. The resulting design integrated the snowboard boot much more into the design, by using the sole as a “semi-rigid” platform and locking it in laterally between the heel cup and the new <b>toe</b> <b>strap</b> arrangement. The new design developed using additive manufacturing techniques was tested via qualitative and quantitative measures in the snow and in the lab. It was found that using the new arrangement in a system resulted in no loss of performance or responsiveness to the user. Due to the design and manufacturing approach users have the ability to customise the design to their specific needs...|$|R
40|$|The {{protocol}} for estimating force of contraction by triceps surae (TS) muscles requires the immobilization of the ankle during dorsiflexion and plantar flexion. However, large {{variability in the}} results has been observed. To identify {{the cause of this}} variability, experiments were conducted where ankle dorsiflexion force and electromyogram (EMG) of the TS were recorded under two conditions: (i) <b>toes</b> were <b>strapped</b> and (ii) <b>toes</b> were unstrapped, with all other conditions such as immobilization of the ankle remaining unchanged. The root mean square (RMS) of the EMG and the force were analyzed and one-tail Student&# 039;s t-test was performed for significance between the two conditions. The RMS of the EMG from TS muscles was found to be significantly higher (~ 55 %) during dorsiflexion with toes unstrapped compared with when the <b>toes</b> were <b>strapped.</b> The torque corresponding to dorsiflexion was also higher with toes unstrapped. Our study has shown {{that it is important to}} <b>strap</b> the <b>toes</b> when measuring the torque at the ankle and EMG of the TS muscle...|$|R
5000|$|To {{improve the}} {{performance}} of the quill pedal toe clips were added. The toe clip is a thin metal or plastic attachment to the front cage of the pedal. The toe clip is shaped like the toe of a shoe and its function is to prevent a cyclist's shoe from slipping off the pedal during the forward pedaling motion. A further enhancement of the quill pedal was modifying the toe clip to allow a strap and buckle to go around or through both the pedal and the toe clip to encircle the cyclist's foot {{on the top of the}} pedal. This strap is generally made of leather or nylon.To further improve the quill pedal's efficiency a [...] "cleat" [...] was developed. This cleat consists of a small metal or plastic attachment to the cyclist's shoe. The cleat is slotted and is adapted to engage a quill section of the bicycle pedal. The use of the slotted cleat enhances a cyclist's ability over that provided by <b>toe</b> clips and <b>strap,</b> enabling for greater pedaling efficiency. Although quill pedals can be used with smoothed-soled cycling shoes or ordinary shoes, they were designed to be used with cycling shoes which had a slotted shoeplate attached to its sole. The disadvantage with this system is that to remove the shoe from the pedal a rider had to reach down and loosen the strap by hand or leave the <b>toe</b> <b>strap</b> loose and thus give up some efficiency. This type of pedal and pedal setup was common for racing cyclists until the mid to late 1980s.|$|R
50|$|The {{traditional}} cycling tourist usually used <b>toe</b> {{clips and}} <b>straps,</b> but touring shoes {{designed for use}} with clipless pedals are now also common, usually with a recessed cleat so that the rider can both walk and cycle effectively.

5000|$|Goaltenders wear special leg pads {{to protect}} their legs and knees. Leg pads have evolved {{significantly}} over the years. The earliest leg pads were {{very similar to the}} cricket pads from which they were adopted. They were constructed of leather and stuffed with deer hair. In the 1930s, leg pads became more specialized, becoming wider and thicker. In the 1940s, an extra roll of material, called a skip-over roll, was added to the outside edge of each pad face, extending from the lowest point of the pad covering the foot, called the boot break, to just below the knee rolls. In the 1950s, the skip-over roll was extended to {{the very top of the}} leg pad. In the 1980s, additional padding was added to protect the inside areas of the legs and knees. Toe foils, a plastic shield that was affixed to the bottom outside edge of the goalie pad, began to be used but were later not allowed by equipment regulations. Leg pad design and construction remained static until the 1990s when synthetic leathers and high density foams began to be used in pad construction. Advantages of synthetic materials were lighter weight, lower cost, a quick break-in period, and leg pads that could be manufactured in the colors of the goaltender's team. Some leg pad manufacturers replaced the leather <b>toe</b> <b>strap</b> with a <b>toe</b> bridge to affix the front of the leg pad to the front of the goalie skate. Starting around 2000, the [...] "box" [...] style leg pads became popular as goaltending playing technique evolved to a blocking style versus the reacting style of the past. In the [...] "box" [...] style pad, the edge between the pad face and the pad inside edge is square, keeping the pad face more perpendicular with the ice surface and maximizing the blocking area when the goaltender is in the [...] "butterfly" [...] position. Currently, ice hockey regulations require that leg pads be no wider than 11 in and can be no longer than 38 in. The NHL has also brought in rules stating that each goaltender will be measured for height, and then the height of allowable pads will be calculated in proportion to the height of the goaltender.|$|R
2500|$|It is {{possible}} to slow down or stop a fixed-gear bike in two ways. The first, most efficient, and least stressful on the rider's body is by resisting the turning cranks as they come up and around, shedding speed with each pedal rotation. The second way, less efficient but more showy, is to bump or skid the rear wheel along the pavement. Such a move is initiated by shifting the rider's weight slightly forward and pulling up on the pedals using clipless pedals or <b>toe</b> clips and <b>straps.</b> [...] The rider then stops turning the cranks, thus stopping the drivetrain and rear wheel, while applying body weight {{in opposition to the}} rotation of the cranks. This causes the rear wheel to skid, and slow the bike. The skid can be held until the bicycle stops or until the rider desires to continue pedaling again at a slower speed. The technique requires practice and is generally considered dangerous when used during cornering [...]|$|R
50|$|An older {{system is}} the {{toe-clip}} and toestrap. A toeclip is a metal cage attached {{to the front of}} the pedal into which the rider inserts the shoe. There are two methods for using pedals with toeclips. The first is a cycling shoe with a slotted shoeplate. Before the introduction of the clipless pedal, most racing shoes had a hard leather or plastic sole to which a metal or plastic shoe plate or cleat was attached. The shoeplate had a slot that fitted into the pedal. The shoeplate along with <b>toe</b> clip and <b>strap</b> keep the rider's feet firmly attached to the pedals. The drawback is that a rider had to reach down and loosen the toestrap by hand to take his foot out of the pedal and for this reason toeclips have been made largely obsolete by clipless pedals. The second is to use a cycling shoe with a smooth sole or a non-cycling shoe. This had the disadvantage of the rider's feet not being firmly attached to the pedals but had the advantage of being able to release from the pedals without having to loosen the strap by hand, and also any shoe can be used.|$|R
40|$|It is {{important}} to accurately estimate the electromyogram (EMG) /force relationship of triceps surae (TS) muscle for detecting strength deficit of tibalis anterior (TA) muscle. In literature, the protocol for recording EMG and force of dorsiflexion have been described, and the necessity for immobilizing the ankle has been explained. However, {{there is a significant}} variability of the results among researchers even though they report the fixation of the ankle. We have determined that toe extension can cause significant variation in the dorsiflexion force and EMG of TS and this can occur despite following the current guidelines which require immobilizing the ankle. The results also show that there was a large increase in the variability of the force and the RMS of EMG of TS when the <b>toes</b> were not <b>strapped</b> compared with when they were strapped. Thus, with the current guidelines, where there are no instructions regarding the necessity of <b>strapping</b> the <b>toes,</b> the EMG/force relationship of TS could be incorrect and give an inaccurate assessment of the dorsiflexor TA strength. In summary, - Current methodology to estimate the dorsiflexor TA strength with respect to the TS activity, emphasizing on ankle immobilization is insufficient to prevent large variability in the measurements. - Toe extension during dorsiflexion was found to be one source of variability in estimating the TA strength. - It is recommended that guidelines for recording force and EMG from TA and TS muscles should require the <b>strapping</b> of the <b>toes</b> along with the need for immobilizing the ankle...|$|R
