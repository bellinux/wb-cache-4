According to Fortuño, this would result in a {{decrease}} in the expenses associated with the operation of the Legislative Assembly. To achieve this, the constitution has <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>amended,</b> which would require a referendum to the people.|$|E
5|$|The DAP also {{focused on}} landholding issues. Chong Chieng Jen, the {{director}} of the DAP's by-election campaign, pointed out that those who decided not to renew their 60-year land leases would have their land returned to the government without compensation, and that even if the government approved requests to have leases renewed, landholders would have to pay large premiums. Chong said that the DAP on the other hand wanted the current state land code <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>amended</b> to allow for the automatic and unconditional renewal of all leased land for a period of 99 years.|$|E
5|$|By December 1942 {{there were}} {{concerns}} that even Oak Ridge {{was too close}} to a major population center (Knoxville) in the unlikely event of a major nuclear accident. Groves recruited DuPont in November 1942 to be the prime contractor for the construction of the plutonium production complex. DuPont was offered a standard cost plus fixed-fee contract, but the President of the company, Walter S. Carpenter, Jr., wanted no profit of any kind, and asked for the proposed contract <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>amended</b> to explicitly exclude the company from acquiring any patent rights. This was accepted, but for legal reasons a nominal fee of one dollar was agreed upon. After the war, DuPont asked to be released from the contract early, and had to return 33 cents.|$|E

5|$|As the WSPU gained {{recognition}} and notoriety for its actions, Pankhurst resisted efforts to democratise the organisation itself. In 1907 {{a small group}} of members led by Teresa Billington-Greig called for more involvement from the rank-and-file suffragettes at the union's annual meetings. In response, Pankhurst announced at a WSPU meeting that elements of the organisation's constitution relating to decision-making were void and cancelled the annual meetings. She also insisted that a small committee chosen by the members in attendance be allowed to co-ordinate WSPU activities. Pankhurst and her daughter Christabel were chosen (along with Mabel Tuke and Emmeline Pethick Lawrence) as members of the new committee. Frustrated, several members including Billington-Greig and Charlotte Despard quit to form their own organisation, the Women's Freedom League. In her 1914 autobiography Pankhurst dismissed criticism of the WSPU's leadership structure:if at any time a member, or a group of members, loses faith in our policy; if any one begins to suggest that some other policy ought to be substituted, or if she tries to confuse the issue by adding other policies, she ceases at once to be a member. Autocratic? Quite so. But, you may object, a suffrage organisation ought to be democratic. Well the members of the W. S. P. U. do not agree with you. We do not believe in the effectiveness of the ordinary suffrage organisation. The W. S. P. U. is not hampered by a complexity of rules. We have no constitution and by-laws; nothing <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>amended</b> or tinkered with or quarrelled over at an annual meeting... The W. S. P. U. is simply a suffrage army in the field.|$|E

Others {{had also been}} lobbying for changes to the New South Wales government, especially the Attorney-General of N.S.W., {{for the right to}} amend birth certificates. Asmodelle {{was the first person to}} have her birth certificate amended in this way. Months later, as a result of this action, passport sex designation was allowed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>amended</b> as well. A year later Asmodelle lobbied for anti-discrimination laws <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>amended</b> and also for the state hospitals ethics boards to allow research into ectopic pregnancy for sex-change women.|$|E

25|$|Festival matches {{were played}} at the ground to {{celebrate}} the golden jubilee of the CCI in 1987–88. Players such as Roger Binny and Mohammed Azharuddin played for a CCI XI, Wasim Akram, Imran Khan, Rameez Raja, and Mudassar Nazar, among others, turned out for Pakistan. Due to shortage of players for Pakistan, Sachin Tendulkar, then just 14 years old, fielded for Pakistan as a substitute. This was Tendulkar's first exposure to international cricket. CCI rules had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>amended</b> to allow the 14-year-old Sachin Tendulkar into the dressing room. Raj Singh Dungarpur, president of the club for several years, {{was instrumental in the}} decision to change this rule.|$|E
25|$|By May it {{had become}} {{apparent}} {{that there was no}} alternative but to revise fares to meet the increased cost of operation and particularly that of labour. The availability of workmen’s fares was altered to cease after 7 a.m., but the time had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>amended</b> shortly afterwards to 7.30 a.m. All transfer facilities were abolished after 20 May; the half-fare limit for children was altered from under 15 to under 12, and other half-fare concessions were abolished, except those for wounded soldiers. Shortly afterwards, workmen’s return fares were also withdrawn. In September, lost property charges were introduced of 2d. for articles claimed within the month, plus 1d. for each additional month thereafter.|$|E

25|$|The {{constitution}} also vows {{to respect}} the human rights, defining the latter by its endorsement of the Charter of the United Nations, the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The constitutional endorsement of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is an aspect Chad has in common with many national constitutions: among African countries, it is endorsed by Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Comoros, Congo-Brazzaville, Côte d'Ivoire, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Gabon, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Rwanda, Senegal and Tanzania. A problem {{is represented by the}} implementation of the human rights norms, as there is a legal vacuum {{due to the lack of}} the necessary provisions in the Criminal Code, which has <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>amended</b> so that national legislation is put into line with the international human rights instruments.|$|E

[...] The cyclol hypothesis stimulated many scientists to research questions in protein structure and chemistry, and was a precursor of the more accurate models hypothesized for the DNA double helix and protein secondary structure.
