500|$|Indeed, at times, his sarcasm was {{directed}} even at his superiors, with Nansouty clashing {{with the more}} senior Grouchy at the Battle of Friedland. Nevertheless, Grouchy later recognised that the actions of Nansouty's division throughout the battle were [...] "glorious". In 1809, Nansouty famously responded to Napoleon's criticism after the Battle of Wagram by saying: [...] "It is not Your Majesty at any rate who can <b>teach</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> to handle cavalry." [...] Three years later, during the campaign in Russia, when Murat, King of Naples complained {{to him about the}} lack of resistance of the horses, Nansouty retorted: [...] "Oh yes, Sire, this is because they lack patriotism." [...] At the Battle of Craonne, in 1814, one day before resigning, he was recorded to have refused to execute Napoleon's order to assault a redoubt, a move which he saw as a death sentence to his men. Instead, Nansouty told the Emperor: [...] "I am going alone. There is nothing but death there and I will not lead these brave soldiers to it." ...|$|E
500|$|Lindwall, Miller and Arthur Morris {{were the}} first {{beneficiaries}} of the New South Wales Cricket Association players' benefit payment plan, set up to reward New South Welshmen who had played for Australia in Tests. Lindwall was a Queensland selector for five seasons and an Australian selector from 1979–80 to 1982–83. He was given life membership of the Marylebone Cricket Club in 1960, the NSWCA is 1979 and the Queensland Cricket Association in 1991. In 1965, he received an MBE for his services to cricket. In retirement, {{he and his wife}} Peggy ran a florist's business after 1965. [...] He and Peggy had two children, a son and a daughter. In the early 1970s, Lindwall mentored upcoming Western Australian paceman Dennis Lillee, who went on to hold the world record for Test wickets. After the Seventh Test in the 1970-71 Ashes series Lillee asked Keith Miller for Lindwall's address as [...] "He might just be able to <b>teach</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> to bowl". He published two books, Flying Stumps in 1954 and The Challenging Tests in 1961. Lindwall died at age 74 at Greenslopes, Brisbane, Queensland. Lindwall was inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame in 1996 as one of the ten inaugural members. In 2000, he was named in the Australian Cricket Board's Team of the Century as one of its opening bowlers.|$|E
