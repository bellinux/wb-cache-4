However, it is inevitable for higher education institutes to have different priorities and roles besides their joint functions. Strategic plans are effective tools in terms of explaining these differences and to make them perceived by related stakeholders. Thus a similar approach is valid for forestry faculties which are increasing in numbers and serve diverse functions in our country. In this context, the aims {{of this study are}} to evaluate similarities and differences in statements of mission and vision and make a comparative assessment of future-oriented goals, <b>targets</b> <b>and</b> <b>strategies</b> of forestry faculties.

Moreover, it has pointed out that the emphasized factors in these statements are not reflected to the goals, <b>targets</b> <b>and</b> <b>strategies</b> in the same proportion. As a result, it is clear that the mission and vision statements of forestry faculties need to be prepared in order to emphasize their unique characteristics and differences.
