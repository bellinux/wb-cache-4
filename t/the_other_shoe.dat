5|$|It was {{something}} we wanted to wrap {{up to a certain}} extent. It's a disservice to Rick's character to make him look like he's completely clueless. But this isn't really a resolution per se. It makes things a little bit more tense, moving into this next episode. Seeing Rick interact with Shane will have an extra level of tension because now the audience has one up on Shane as opposed to one up on Rick. It’s going to be fun waiting for <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>shoe</b> to drop, when Rick may or may not confront Shane with this information.|$|E
25|$|The series {{polarized}} {{the comics}} community, with Batiuk being both praised {{for dealing with}} the topic and criticized for his graphic depiction of Lisa's slow deterioration and ultimate death. The entire storyline, which did culminate with Lisa's death in the October 4, 2007, strip (excerpt at right), was collected and published in a book entitled Lisa's Story: <b>The</b> <b>Other</b> <b>Shoe.</b> This book, which includes the strips from Lisa's initial battle with cancer (which had itself been collected in book form in 2004), was in fact published before the series had finished running in syndication. In 2007, Batiuk discussed his reasoning for pursuing the plotline, stating that he was inspired by his own personal battle against prostate cancer.|$|E

[...] "The Orange County Superior Court has already thrown out the libel claim, with good reason. Today's action is merely the est people giving up on the slander cause of action," [...] said Woods. Woods said that Erhard would lose his case regarding the dismissed libel charges if he attempted to bring the matter up on appeal: [...] "Saying they are going to focus on an appeal for the libel claim is only a face-saving statement." ...|$|E
