2500|$|The Huddersfield Narrow Canal {{provided}} a heavily-locked western {{connection to the}} wool-weaving towns of the upper Colne valley, (Golcar, Linthwaite, Slaithwaite, and Marsden) and across the Pennines to Saddleworth, Stalybridge and Manchester via Standedge Tunnel. It was never particularly successful, and Ramsden's Canal was seen almost as {{a branch of the}} Calder and Hebble, with links to Yorkshire, rather than Lancashire. The Calder and Hebble brought prosperity to the area, and Ramsden's Canal shared in it. The Narrow Canal was hampered by the need to <b>tranship</b> cargoes at Huddersfield. Their boats were , the same as those on the connecting Ashton Canal and Peak Forest Canal at the Manchester end. However, they were too long to fit through the shorter locks of Ramsden's Canal and the Calder and Hebble. In 1812 they built a [...] narrowboat, which could work through to Wakefield, but it carried a smaller cargo. The company tried unsuccessfully to get the Calder and Hebble to entend their locks to cater for longer boats. Had they succeeded, locks on Ramsden's Canal would have needed lengthening.|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you mean}} to go any closer, I'll stop her and back out!" [...] he said. [...] "Then you can <b>tranship</b> your goods outside or I'll take them on, as you like." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How can I tell yet? I {{must wait}} and see what turns up. When we <b>tranship</b> at Aden, and find out what people are going on to Bombay with us, I shall {{probably}} discover some nice married lady to whom I can attach myself." ...|$|E
50|$|Since 2005, several {{wind turbine}} parts {{have also been}} <b>transhipped</b> in the port.|$|R
6000|$|... “I see. To be <b>transhipped</b> to Liverpool for {{experimental}} manufacture, eh? Eminent capitalists at home very much interested, aren’t they?” ...|$|R
50|$|Technical {{solutions}} to avoid <b>transhipping</b> include variable gauge axles, replacing the bogies of cars, and using transporter cars that {{can carry a}} car of a different gauge.|$|R
6000|$|One day Jack {{came to me}} with {{a rather}} more sinful {{proposal}} than he had heretofore done me the honor to submit. He knew of about a thousand bales of cotton, some of it private property, some of it confiscable, stored at various points {{on the banks of the}} Alabama. He had a steamboat in readiness, [...] "with a gallant, gallant crew," [...] and he proposed to drop quietly down to the various landings by night, seize the cotton, load it on his boat and make off down the river. What he wanted from me, and was willing to pay for, was only my official signature to some blank shipping permits; or if I would accompany the expedition and share its fortunes no papers would be necessary. In declining this truly generous offer I felt that I owed it to Jack to give him a reason that he was capable of understanding, so I explained to him the arrangements at Mobile, which would prevent him from transferring his cargo to a ship and getting the necessary papers permitting her to sail. He was astonished and, I think, pained by my simplicity. Did I think him a fool? He did not purpose--not he--to <b>tranship</b> at all: the perfected plan was to dispense with all hampering formality by slipping through Mobile Bay in the black of the night and navigating his laden river craft across the Gulf to Havana! The rascal was in dead earnest, and that natural timidity of disposition which compelled me to withhold my coöperation greatly lowered me in his esteem, I fear.|$|E
60|$|For {{this was}} only a beginning. He had got into {{communication}} with the various companies which took surgeons out on their ships, and knew exactly what were their routes, and from {{men who had been}} on them what were {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} each line. He put aside the Orient and the P. & O. It was difficult to get a berth with them; and besides their passenger traffic allowed the medical officer little freedom; but there were other services which sent large tramps on leisurely expeditions to the East, stopping at all sorts of ports for various periods, from a day or two to a fortnight, so that you had plenty of time, and it was often possible to make a trip inland. The pay was poor and the food no more than adequate, so that there was not much demand for the posts, and a man with a London degree was pretty sure to get one if he applied. Since there were no passengers other than a casual man or so, shipping on business from some out-of-the-way port to another, the life on board was friendly and pleasant. Philip knew by heart the list of places at which they touched; and each one called up in him visions of tropical sunshine, and magic colour, and of a teeming, mysterious, intense life. Life! That was what he wanted. At last he would come to close quarters with Life. And perhaps, from Tokyo or Shanghai it would be possible to <b>tranship</b> into some other line and drip down to the islands of the South Pacific. A doctor was useful anywhere. There might be an opportunity to go up country in Burmah, and what rich jungles in Sumatra or Borneo might he not visit? He was young still and time was no object to him. He had no ties in England, no friends; he could go up and down the world for years, learning the beauty and the wonder and the variedness of life.|$|E
50|$|Kitadu is {{fitted with}} large cranes which help <b>tranship</b> goods, {{especially}} containers, from wagons of one gauge to wagons of another gauge.|$|E
25|$|He {{continued}} shipping {{goods to}} Portland around Cape Horn, {{and after the}} railway was built in 1855 across the Isthmus of Panama, he also <b>transhipped</b> some goods by rail.|$|R
50|$|South of the {{passenger}} railway station there is a freight yard, which was formerly important for express freight. Today it handles very little freight. Until the late 1990s, containers were <b>transhipped</b> there.|$|R
25|$|Some of {{the goods}} wagons are {{suitable}} for use on the Gornergratbahn. By means of special railcars of type Bhe 4/4, goods can also be transported {{all the way to}} the Gornergrat without being <b>transhipped</b> at Zermatt.|$|R
50|$|It {{caters to}} repair of {{passenger}} ship, tanker (ship), cargo ship, <b>tranship,</b> dredgers, fishing trawler, barge, Offshore support vessel, warships of Indian Navy and Coast Guard and oil rigs.|$|E
50|$|The place covers an {{extensive}} {{area of the}} Six Mile Creek valley with the main concentrations of features exceeding an area of 1 km (east- west) by 2 km (north-south). The smelter structure and a <b>tranship</b> stage form a closely integrated group of components. A large, well formed slag dump extends {{to the base of}} the smelter. The smelter remains are impressive, comprising three standing steel chimneys, blast furnace frame, elevated iron flues, flue dust bins, and two copper converters. The smelter floor is a raised earth platform with high concrete retaining walls each side. The blast furnace has been removed leaving the steel frame and furnace hood. Extending north-east of the smelter floor are the concrete foundations and earth bench surfaces of the power house. Storage hopper footings of a <b>tranship</b> stage are located along a rail spur line which terminates near the smelter floor. The <b>tranship</b> stage accommodates two rail alignments separated by a raised concrete platform. A line of reinforced concrete piers and headstocks remain standing as evidence of an elevated rail alignment.|$|E
50|$|Thereafter, {{the land}} routes to <b>tranship</b> camel caravans' goods were from Alexandria to ports on the Red Sea or the {{northern}} Byzantine silk route through the Caucasian Mountains transhipping on the Caspian Sea and thence to India.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not wholly at a glance. I saw {{her come}} on board, you know--she <b>transhipped</b> {{from some other}} line at Aden as we did, and I have been {{watching}} her ever since. Yes, I think I have unravelled her." ...|$|R
50|$|The first trade route was the Australia/UK one {{followed}} {{later by}} the Far East/UK route. Initial arrivals in Europe intended for the UK had to be diverted and <b>transhipped</b> via Rotterdam, because of unresolved industrial disputes in UK ports.|$|R
50|$|Through {{operation}} between railway networks {{with different}} gauges was originally impossible; goods {{had to be}} <b>transhipped</b> and passengers had to change trains. This was obviously a major obstacle to convenient transport, and in Great Britain, led to political intervention.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{part of the}} GWR, the S&CR {{was never}} {{converted}} to Brunel's Broad Gauge; but it did contribute to {{the ending of the}} Brunel system because it meant that the company had to operate two different systems and <b>tranship</b> goods.|$|E
5000|$|Between 1860 and 1863 some Lytton {{township}} allotments were alienated, {{mostly by}} Brisbane speculators who anticipated {{the development of}} wharf facilities at Lytton. Few private buildings were erected there. The Crown and Anchor Hotel at Lytton held a license in 1865-66 - about the time a government wharf adjacent to the Customs Reserve was built in 1866 to <b>tranship</b> railway stores and plant. From 1878 until [...] the Lytton Hotel served local farmers and the annual military presence.|$|E
50|$|Thanks to {{the signing}} of the Treaty of Adrianoupolis (Edirne), September 2, 1829, that {{unfettered}} the Danube grain trade, Sulina, by then under Russian control, became important. Great sailing boats could not sail fully loaded to Brăila and Galaţi, which were the main export centres of Wallachia and Moldavia, because of the shallow waters of the river; therefore, they had to <b>tranship</b> at least part of their cargoes to smaller riverboats (shleps). The owners and crew of these sleps were almost always Greek.|$|E
50|$|Initially, {{there was}} no direct {{transfer}} traffic with the state railway, all freight had to be <b>transhipped.</b> Transfer between the systems became possible in 1902. The line had 22 railway sidings {{with a total of}} 13.59 km of track in 1934.|$|R
50|$|The mine is {{connected}} by a 140 km 1435mm gauge railway to the junction at Dabola, where ore is <b>transhipped</b> to 1000mm gauge wagons {{for the rest of}} the journey to the port. This branch line was completed in 1998.|$|R
25|$|On 18 March an LST ramp {{opened at}} the base {{allowing}} supplies to be <b>transhipped</b> on LCUs and LCMs to Đông Hà. A petroleum, oil & lubricants (POL) facility was also established at the base, protected by a company from the 1st Battalion, 9th Marines.|$|R
50|$|Advenza was {{scheduled}} to commence operating between Barking, Essex (Roadways Limited's sidings) and Deanside Glasgow (John G Russell) in April 2004, using trains of containers which would be trans-shipped from rail to the respective operator depots to <b>tranship</b> pallet load freight. This was using three cycles a week, north bound Monday-Wednesday-Friday, and southbound Tuesday-Thursday-Saturday. However, due to uncertainties with the provision of locomotives {{and the fact that}} the supporting systems were not yet in place even though all the drivers had been route-trained, the launch was postponed.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{sections}} of Lytton township were alienated between 1860 and 1863, mostly by Brisbane speculators who anticipated {{the development of}} wharf facilities at Lytton. Few private buildings were erected there. The Crown and Anchor Hotel operated at Lytton briefly in 1865-66, when a government wharf adjacent to the Customs Reserve was built in 1866 to <b>tranship</b> railway stores and plant for construction of the Southern and Western Railway. From 1878 until [...] the Lytton Hotel served local farmers and a military presence. Lytton State School was established [...] In general, the district remained agricultural.|$|E
50|$|The Houthaven was dug out in 1876, {{together}} with the North Sea Canal. It was the first port in Amsterdam to be dug out (the earlier ones using existing waters). Its purpose was to <b>tranship</b> and store lumber. As lumber was increasingly transported by road, parts of the port were filled up with sand {{to be used for}} other purposes in 1945. The Minervahaven remained in use for lumber transhipment and wood processing industry was located there but port-related activities decreased strongly over time. The area is currently being redeveloped.|$|E
50|$|In 1930, the Eastern Province Cement Company {{opened a}} {{limestone}} quarry {{and built a}} 14 km cableway to transport the stone to the Loerie railway station where it was <b>transhipped</b> to the Avontuur Railway to be processed in a cement factory near Port Elizabeth.|$|R
50|$|On 18 March an LST ramp {{opened at}} the base {{allowing}} supplies to be <b>transhipped</b> on LCUs and LCMs to Đông Hà. A petroleum, oil & lubricants (POL) facility was also established at the base, protected by a company from the 1st Battalion, 9th Marines.|$|R
50|$|The Brighton - Shoreham branch was {{completed}} in May 1840, before the main line, as {{there were no significant}} civil engineering works on this section. Locomotives and rolling stock had to be <b>transhipped</b> by road for what was, in the first year, an isolated stretch of railway.|$|R
50|$|The station, as {{designed}} in 1954, {{was a large}} building almost 92 metres long and 12.5 metres wide with a 162.7 metres long concrete platform shaded with cantilever awnings extending well beyond the northeastern end of the building. A 46 metre long loading dock was built {{at the north end}} of the building with access to King Street. The entrance opened to a spacious terrazzo tiled vestibule located in the centre of the building. Some 26 other rooms made up the building including <b>Tranship</b> Room, Cloak and Luggage Room, Parcels Office, Station Master and Assistant Station Master's Offices, Clerks' Office, Telegraph Room, Ticket Office, Ladies Waiting Room, Refreshment Rooms, Store Rooms, Guards and Porters' Rooms, Mail Room and Lavatories.|$|E
5000|$|The entire Gulf of Gabes, both {{larger and}} smaller versions, is {{underlain}} by the continental shelf of the African Plate, and is nowhere deeper than 200 meters. During the Permian Period and Triassic Period, carbonate minerals and evaporites were {{deposited in the}} Gulf of Gabes which now form salt domes and diapirs. In addition carbon and hydrocarbons primarily from vegetation were deposited. These now {{form the basis for}} {{the oil and gas industry}} in the gulf. Among the important oil and gas fields in the gulf are the Ashtart Field and the Chergui Field. The Ashtart Oil Terminal lies just outside the gulf at [...] where tankers can easily <b>tranship</b> the oil.|$|E
50|$|Around {{the start}} of the 19th century, two new towns were constructed: Milford in 1790 by Sir William Hamilton, and Pembroke Dock in 1802 as the site for a new Royal Naval Dockyard. Both towns have regular planned layouts, both have {{experienced}} a history of boom and slump in shipbuilding, fishing and as railheads and ocean terminals. These two towns, which could handle the larger vessels then entering service, concentrated trade that had previously been dispersed at quays, jetties and landing places and small settlements such as Pennar, Lawrenny, Landshipping and Cosheston further up river. These small ports served the coal mines of the Pembrokeshire Coalfield located on both shores of the Daugleddau, and also the large limestone quarries at West Williamston. The Daugleddau ports flourished in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, but continued to work through the 19th century by changing to using barges to <b>tranship</b> cargoes down river to bigger vessels at the mid-Haven ports.|$|E
50|$|The Liskeard and Caradon Railway {{was opened}} on 28 November 1844 from {{quarries}} on the moors north of Liskeard to Moorswater where goods were transshipped to the Liskeard and Looe Union Canal. At Looe they {{could then be}} <b>transhipped</b> again to sea-going vessels for transport further around the coast.|$|R
5000|$|In freight rail transport, {{interchange}} is {{the practice}} of railroads conveying freight cars ("foreign" [...] cars) from other companies over their lines. This benefits shippers, whose cargo might otherwise have to be <b>transhipped</b> if the point of origin and destination are not both served by the same company.|$|R
50|$|Chemin de fer Lanaudière is {{connected}} to the Canadian Pacific (CP) and Canadian National (CN) network by the Quebec Gatineau Railway (QGRY). The railroad crosses the Lanaudière region over a distance of 17 km between Joliette and Saint-Félix-de-Valois. The network includes <b>transhipping</b> sites and offers the possibility of other junctions.|$|R
