5|$|Although {{interests}} in human anatomy {{had a long}} tradition in the Western world, a forensic book such as Song Ci's did not appear in Western works until Roderic de Castro's book in the 17th century. There have been several modern books published about Song Ci's writing and translations of it into English. This includes W.A. Harland's Records of Washing away of Injuries (1855), Herbert Giles' The Hsi Yuan Lu, or Instructions to Coroners (1924), and Dr. Brian E. McKnight's <b>The</b> <b>Washing</b> Away of Wrongs: Forensic Medicine in Thirteenth-Century China (1981).|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{striking}} pieces is a large dish weighing , in the centre of which is a relief depiction of the Last Supper. Around the edge at the top, bottom and sides are four engravings of biblical scenes: <b>the</b> <b>Washing</b> of the Feet, the Walk to Emmaus, the Coming of the Holy Ghost, and Christ's Commission to the Apostles, divided by scrolls of foliage. Made by London goldsmith Henry Greenway in 1664 for the Duke of York and later acquired by CharlesII, it stands on the high altar during the coronation ceremony.|$|E

Her lifelong love of corgis began in 1933 with Dookie, the first corgi owned by her family. Scenes of a relaxed, informal home life have occasionally been witnessed; {{she and her}} family, from time to time, prepare a meal together and do <b>the</b> <b>washing</b> up afterwards.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Meadow Valley <b>Wash</b> is a {{southern}} Nevada stream draining the Meadow Watershed that is bordered on 3 sides by the Great Basin Divide. <b>The</b> <b>wash's</b> Lincoln County headpoint {{is in the}} Wilson Creek Range, and <b>the</b> <b>wash</b> includes 2 upper confluences (e.g., <b>the</b> Patterson <b>Wash).</b> Panaca is along <b>the</b> upper <b>wash,</b> and downstream of Caliente is <b>the</b> <b>wash's</b> confluence with its east fork. Just prior to the junction with the Muddy River, <b>the</b> <b>wash</b> flows from Lincoln County into northeastern Clark County. It flows into the Muddy in the Moapa Valley just west of Glendale adjacent to Interstate 15 approximately 40 mi northwest of Las Vegas.|$|R
50|$|In 2008 {{environmental}} non-profit Pacoima Beautiful started <b>the</b> Pacoima <b>Wash</b> initiative. <b>The</b> goal of {{this project}} {{is to create a}} linear greenway composed of bike lanes and a walking path along a 12 mile stretch of <b>the</b> <b>Wash</b> between <b>the</b> Pacoima Dam in Sylmar and <b>the</b> Tujunga <b>Wash</b> in Arleta. <b>The</b> Pacoima <b>Wash</b> Vision Plan, which covers the Sylmar and Pacoima portions of <b>the</b> <b>Wash</b> was produced in 2011.

5|$|Upon making {{landfall}} {{on south}} Samar on December10, Hibok-Hibok erupted {{six times in}} rapid succession, worsening the effects of both the typhoon and the volcano. Amy had also made landfall on an area impacted by a second typhoon three weeks prior. Strong winds displaced and destroyed residences and uprooted trees, while torrential rainfall caused rivers to overflow, resulting in the flooding of sugarcane fields and <b>the</b> <b>washing</b> away of bridges. Radio communications to and between most of the central Philippine islands were disrupted.|$|E
5|$|He {{returned}} to the Netherlands in September 1939 as the Second World War threatened. He remained {{at a hotel in}} Amsterdam for several months and moved to the village of Laren in 1940. Throughout 1941, van Meegeren issued his designs, which he published in 1942 as a large and luxurious book entitled Han van Meegeren: Teekeningen I (Drawings nr I). He also created several forgeries during this time, including The Head of Christ, The Last Supper II, The Blessing of Jacob, The Adulteress, and <b>The</b> <b>Washing</b> of the Feet—all in the manner of Vermeer. On 18 December 1943, he divorced his wife, but this was only a formality; the couple remained together, but a large share of his capital was transferred to her accounts as a safeguard against the uncertainties of the war.|$|E
5|$|Historian Carl Sferrazza Anthony {{noted that}} {{ordinary}} citizens responded to Nixon. When {{a group of}} rural people visited the White House to present a quilt to the First Lady, many were overcome with nervousness; upon hearing their weeping, Pat hugged each individual tightly, and the tension dissipated. When a young boy doubted that the Executive Mansion was her house {{because he could not}} see <b>the</b> <b>washing</b> machine, Pat led him through the halls and up an elevator, into the family quarters and the laundry room. She mixed well with people of different races, and made no distinctions on that basis. During the Nixons' trip to China in 1972, foreign minister Zhou En-lai was suffienciently smitten with her so as to give two rare giant pandas to the ambassador as a gift from China.|$|E
40|$|Arroyo Chico Wash, an {{important}} drainage for central Tucson, Arizona, runs through numerous neighborhood and industrial areas before emptying into the Santa Cruz River. Within four suburban neighborhoods along <b>the</b> <b>wash,</b> direct observations, personal interviews, survey questions, and historical documents {{are used to}} describe design and management influences on the biological and human aspects of <b>the</b> <b>wash.</b> Plants along <b>the</b> <b>wash</b> are identified by 2 -meter wide belt transects run at 100 -meter intervals over the 4 kilometer length of the study area. Wild animal and bird lists are based on observation and information given by residents. Relationships between design, maintenance and neighborhood attitudes toward <b>the</b> <b>wash</b> are assessed using a survey questionnaire given to people living adjacent to <b>the</b> <b>wash.</b> Results show <b>the</b> <b>wash</b> in <b>the</b> Colonia Solana neighborhood has the greatest biological diversity, highest neighborhood satisfaction and highest recreational use. In neighborhoods where <b>the</b> <b>wash</b> is a "backyard easement", satisfaction and use are the lowest...|$|R
50|$|Owing to {{deposits}} of sediment and land reclamation, the coastline of <b>the</b> <b>Wash</b> has altered markedly within historical times; several towns {{once on the}} coast of <b>the</b> <b>Wash</b> (notably King's Lynn) are now some distance inland. Much of <b>the</b> <b>Wash</b> itself is very shallow, with several large sandbanks, such as Breast Sand, Bulldog Sand, Roger Sand and Old South Sand, which are exposed at low tide, especially along the south coast. For this reason, navigation in <b>the</b> <b>Wash</b> can be hazardous. A lightship marks the entrance to the Lynn Channel, the one safe channel from the North Sea to the south coast of <b>the</b> <b>Wash.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>wash</b> flows northwesterly {{with the}} {{alignment}} of the northwest-southeast trending mountains and valleys of the former Basin and Range mountain ranges. <b>The</b> <b>washes</b> and arroyos combine into <b>the</b> San Cristobal <b>Wash</b> which enters <b>the</b> San Cristobal Valley at <b>the</b> south. <b>The</b> <b>wash</b> ends its watercourse {{one third of the}} way into the valley, and disappears about 8 mi south of the Gila River. The majority of <b>the</b> <b>wash</b> lies in <b>the</b> southeast of Yuma County, but southeast drainages from the Growler Valley area drain extreme western Pima County.|$|R
5|$|In Goodland, Florida, {{during a}} fierce hurricane, Sara Shipley and her son, Evan, desperately try to flip <b>the</b> <b>washing</b> machine but {{fail to do}} so as tentacles ensnare them. After {{receiving}} a call, FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) arrive {{at the home of}} retired FBI agent Arthur Dales (Darren McGavin), the first to look into the X-Files. He tells them about the Shipley family and how Sara Shipley called him in a panic after her husband was attacked by something in the bathroom with tentacles. Scully is dubious about this but believes that something has indeed happened to the Shipley family during this hurricane.|$|E
5|$|Limestone traffic {{continued}} on the Tiverton section. Only two boats were working the canal by 1904, {{and the last}} commercial traffic was roadstone from Whipcott quarry to Tiverton, {{where there was a}} crushing plant. Around 7,000tons per year were transported up to 1925. After this the only income was from <b>the</b> <b>washing</b> of sheep, for which a charge was made for every 20 sheep, and the sale of water lilies which grew in the canal. In the 1930s, dams were built at both ends of a section near Halberton, where persistent leakage could not be cured.|$|E
5|$|The main {{harvesting}} {{season for}} coffee in Rwanda is during the major rainy season, running from March {{to the end}} of May. At harvest time, farmers spend most of the day picking cherries by hand. In the evening, they carry them in traditional baskets woven from banana leaves to <b>the</b> <b>washing</b> station, which may be several hours away. Technicians hand-sort the beans to pick out the best cherries, those with a deep red colour, and return the remainder to the grower to be sold on to markets outside the Maraba process at a lower price. The technicians pay the grower US$0.10 per kilogram. This money accumulates, and the association pays it each fortnight into farmers' bank accounts.|$|E

50|$|Rising {{back out}} of <b>the</b> <b>wash,</b> <b>the</b> trail reaches Bryan Ave. Taking the underpass, the cyclist should make a hairpin right onto the Bryan Ave exit ramp. A Class I trail does {{continue}} on the East side of <b>the</b> <b>wash</b> and includes several branches to the East into Irvine. However, the Peters Canyon trail crosses <b>the</b> <b>wash</b> and <b>the</b> 261 Freeway to the West on the overpass which has a dedicated Class I facility. Turning right, the Peters Canyon trail continues on the West side of <b>the</b> <b>wash.</b> You will note {{that there is a}} future provision here for the trail to continue South on the West side of <b>the</b> <b>wash.</b> Indeed, between this point and the railroad tracks the observant cyclist will have noted several completed and uncompleted sections {{on the opposite side of}} <b>the</b> <b>wash.</b> Traveling North <b>the</b> Peters Canyon trail runs parallel to an equestrian trail. From this point on, wherever the signs are insufficient to determine direction of the trail, as occurs in one or two spots, the cyclist may use the equestrian trail as a guide.|$|R
5|$|John Calvin was {{influenced}} by Martin Luther's idea of baptism as God's promises to the baptized person attached to the outward sign of washing with water. Calvin maintained Zwingli's idea of baptism as a public pledge, but insisted that it was secondary to baptism's meaning {{as a sign of}} God's promise to forgive sin. He maintained that sacraments were effective instruments in bringing about the promises they represent, however he also maintained that the promises could be refused by the baptized, and would have no effect in that case. Calvin carefully distinguished between the outward sign of <b>the</b> <b>washing</b> of water with the promises that baptism signifies while maintaining that they were inseparable. Calvin's baptismal theology is very similar to that of Luther. It differs in the way Calvin subordinated sacraments to the preaching of the word of God. While Luther placed preaching and sacraments on the same level, Calvin saw sacraments as confirmation which is added to the preaching of the word of God.|$|E
5|$|The second plot of {{the episode}} {{revolves}} around Jerry; when he prepares {{to go to the}} laundromat, Kramer asks him to take his laundry with him. Jerry agrees after some reluctance, insisting that their clothes remain segregated. After retrieving the laundry the following day and returning Kramer's portion, Jerry remembers that he had hidden a large sum of money in his laundry bag, but is unable to find it. The owner of the laundromat (John Capodice), tells him that he did not see the money, but also points out that he is not responsible for valuables. Kramer and Jerry both assume Vic stole the money and Kramer comes {{up with a plan to}} put cement mix in one of Vic's washing machines as revenge. Once they have acted out the plan, Kramer discovers that he had the money all along; and it turns out to be just enough to cover the damage to <b>the</b> <b>washing</b> machine.|$|E
5|$|The {{technicians}} start <b>the</b> <b>washing</b> process immediately, since delay {{can cause}} fermentation of the sugary coating surrounding the bean and ruination {{of the coffee}} flavour. The beans are first thrown into a deep tank. The best cherries sink {{to the bottom and}} pass through a machine that removes their skin. The technicians remove any floating cherries and process them {{in the same way as}} the others for the cooperative to sell on the domestic market for less than specialty-coffee price. The beans are fed through one of the cooperative's three de-skinning and selection machines to remove their skins and most of the sugary coating before running the individual beans through a vibrating colander. The colander separates the very highest quality Grade A beans from those labeled Grade B; the two grades are sent separately down the hill in a water chute with a 1 percent gradient. This process allows for further separation of beans based on quality, with around 15 tanks available at the bottom for capture of the different types. The beans are kept submerged, two days for the best and 15–20 hours for the lesser beans, which causes a small amount of fermentation to convert the remainder of the sugar without significantly impairing the flavour.|$|E
50|$|In {{the prime}} phase, the {{centrifuge}} begins rotation and accelerates {{to the speed}} selected on the centrifuge speed control, typically 5,600 rpm. Simultaneously, the pump begins counterclockwise rotation, enabling {{the transfer of the}} reservoir contents to <b>the</b> <b>wash</b> bowl. <b>The</b> application of centrifugal force separates the components of the fluid according to their weight. <b>The</b> <b>wash</b> bowl filling continues until the buffy coat reaches the shoulder of <b>the</b> <b>wash</b> bowl. Some autotransfusion devices have automatic features including a buffy coat sensor, which is calibrated to detect a full bowl and advance the process to <b>the</b> <b>wash</b> phase automatically.|$|R

40|$|Addition of a 0. 5 M KCl wash {{fraction}} from rabbit reticulocyte ribosomes {{causes a}} 3 - to 10 -fold {{increase in the}} extent of translation of natural mRNAs by Krebs-cell lysates. In the presence of <b>the</b> <b>wash</b> fraction, 1 pmol of rabbit or mouse 10 S RNA directs the incorporation of 80 pmol of leucine into rabbit globin. The addition of human 10 S RNA results in the synthesis of equal amounts of human α and β chains, identified by column chromatography. The stimulation by <b>the</b> <b>wash</b> fraction is almost completely dependent on added mammalian tRNA. In contrast to <b>the</b> <b>wash</b> fraction from rabbit reticulocytes, <b>the</b> <b>wash</b> fraction isolated from Krebs-cell ribosomes is inhibitory to both endogenous and exogenous mRNA translation.
