25|$|When Chris dies, he {{experiences}} {{symptoms of}} a near death experience. As pain gradually leaves his body, he observes a tunnel of light and views his dead body from above, connected to himself by a silver cord. He then experiences his life flashing before his eyes, as the events in his life unfold in reverse. This last experience occurs again later, much more slowly, while he's a ghost. Albert later compares it to purgatory, a <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>people</b> are forced to re-examine their lives without rationalization.|$|E
25|$|The {{conscience}} {{of time is}} specified as years and months well divided, with during the first ten days of the months a habit of eating coca (hayo). The next ten days are for working the farmfields and houses. The last ten days are described as <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>people</b> rest and the women live separately from the men; all the women together in one bohío and every man in his own. It is reported that {{in other parts of}} the New Kingdom of Granada, the division of time is different; the described ten day periods are longer and two months of the year are reserved for fasting (quaresma).|$|E

25|$|Dark {{skin with}} large {{concentrations}} of melanin protects against ultraviolet light and skin cancers; light-skinned people {{have about a}} tenfold greater risk of dying from skin cancer, compared with dark-skinned persons, under equal sunlight exposure. Furthermore, UV-A rays from sunlight are believed to interact with folic acid in ways that may damage health. In a number of traditional societies the sun was avoided as much as possible, especially around noon when the ultraviolet radiation in sunlight is at its most intense. Midday was a <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>people</b> stayed in the shade and had the main meal followed by a nap, a practice similar to the modern siesta.|$|E

[...] On March 26, 2011, the season premiered with the episode [...] "A Friendly Game" [...] and [...] "Oral Report".

500|$|Hubbard {{characterized}} her composition {{style as}} [...] "impressionistic paintings in music", {{in an interview}} with the St. Petersburg Times. She commented, [...] "My music is for the <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>people</b> want to turn out the lights, listen and escape into another world ... to dream places ... to little magical places in which the listener can participate and become involved." [...] Regarding a potential audience, Hubbard said, [...] "My music is for intelligent listeners, who don't mind if I change chords, and are willing to see what happens next." [...] Explaining why written text did not accompany the songs, Hubbard said, [...] "I wrote lots of poetry. But somehow it didn't feel right to have lyrics with the pieces – I'd rather leave that slot open for the listener." ...|$|E

500|$|Poor {{families}} {{are much more}} constrained in their economic ability to [...] "buy back" [...] lost time through the market. Instead of buying market substitutes, they try {{to meet their needs}} without spending money by taking care of children instead of hiring help, taking care of the sick instead of taking them to the hospital, and making food from scratch instead of buying pre-made food. The way that poor families deal with the time debt is for the main caretaker to intensify the time that they spend working, by doing multiple jobs at once instead of doing one job at a <b>time.</b> <b>When</b> <b>people</b> increase the intensity of their work to compensate for their lack of time to finish everything that needs to get done, called work intensity, many health problems occur.|$|E
500|$|Carol Swiderski of the Chicago Tribune {{wrote that}} {{although}} saying [...] "have a nice day" [...] {{may not be}} sincere, the speaker has acknowledged that the recipient is there. She argued [...] "ave we become so analytic that we can't accept these little niceties without asking ourselves, 'Did he really mean it? Does she really care if I have a nice day?'" [...] Writing that society has become so automated that going through a check-out line at a grocery store without having made eye contact or spoken with the checker is possible, Swiderski favored [...] "insincerely meant human kindness to a robot". She encouraged people to respond to [...] "have a nice day" [...] with [...] "you have a nice day, too" [...] because she hoped that when {{a sufficient number of}} people do this, there could be a <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>people</b> will sincerely intend it.|$|E
500|$|The April 10 {{show was}} the second of four concerts Davis played at the Fillmore West that month {{and one of his}} first concerts in a rock venue, having {{performed}} at New York City's Fillmore East a month earlier. His change to rock venues, suggested by Columbia Records president Clive Davis, helped the label market Bitches Brew to the counterculture audience. According to Holland, Davis' music around this time became well received by the rock audiences they encountered. [...] "I heard quite recently from one of the [...] ex-members that they were very nervous that they had to play up next to Miles", he said. [...] "It was a <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>people</b> were not that worried about musical categories. And this was some pretty strong in-your-face music. People loved it." [...] Davis said the Fillmore West shows were an [...] "eye-opening experience" [...] for him. While he became friendly with Grateful Dead frontman Jerry Garcia, who was a fan of Davis' music, there were several thousands of mostly young, white hippies who were generally unfamiliar with him, Davis recalled.|$|E

2500|$|Offshore {{wind power}} {{can help to}} reduce energy imports, reduce air {{pollution}} and greenhouse gases (by displacing fossil-fuel power generation), meet renewable electricity standards, and create jobs and local business opportunities. The advantage is that the wind is much stronger off the coasts, and unlike wind over the continent, offshore breezes can be strong in the afternoon, matching the <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>people</b> are using the most electricity. Offshore turbines can also be [...] "located close to the power-hungry populations along the coasts, {{eliminating the need for}} new overland transmission lines".|$|E

He said something like: 'I know that everything is futile when the house is burning.

Assuming, if it is set to be 7 % then once the phone’sbattery level reaches 7 %, it will store the GPS location and time of it. Now, on receiving a call, an automatic text message would be sent to the caller so as to let him know that the phone is switched off. The message would contain the last GPS location and time.
