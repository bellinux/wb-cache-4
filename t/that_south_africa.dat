Both the opening and closing ceremonies took place at Cardiff Arms Park, plus all the track and field events, on what had been the greyhound track.

5|$|Helena saw {{relatively}} little of her surviving siblings, and continued {{her role as}} a support to the monarchy and a campaigner for the many charities she represented. She and Christian led a quiet life, but did carry out a few royal engagements. On one such occasion, the elderly couple represented the King at the silver wedding anniversary, in 1906, of Kaiser Wilhelm II (Helena's nephew) and his wife Augusta Victoria (Christian's niece). During the Edwardian period, Helena visited the grave of her son, Prince Christian Victor, who died in 1900 following a bout with malaria while serving in the Second Boer War. She was met by South African Prime Minister Louis Botha, but Jan Smuts refused to meet her, partly because he was bitter <b>that</b> <b>South</b> <b>Africa</b> had lost the war and partly because his son had died in a British concentration camp.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, protest against South Africa's {{apartheid}} regime reached {{the stage of}} seeking to exclude the nation from international sport. In 1956, government rules requiring separate events for whites and non-whites in South Africa were issued; non-whites received poorer facilities. Brundage initially opposed taking any action. The run-up to the 1960 Rome Olympics had seen tumult in South Africa, including the Sharpeville massacre and a crackdown on the African National Congress. Activists attempted to persuade Brundage <b>that</b> <b>South</b> <b>Africa</b> should be excluded from the Games. Brundage initially took the word of South African sport leaders that all citizens were able to compete for {{a place on the}} Olympic team, and that non-white South Africans simply were not good enough.|$|E

40|$|This {{article will}} argue <b>that</b> <b>South</b> <b>Africa’s</b> {{approach}} to conflict mediation and peace building {{is informed by}} the ANC’s experience of {{the transition to democracy}} in <b>South</b> <b>Africa</b> and is widely misinterpreted. This was particularly evident in the Libyan crisis, where <b>South</b> <b>Africa</b> was widely accused of exhibiting a morally duplicitous and ideologically rudderless foreign policy because of {{the manner in which it}} initially supported intervention and subsequently became one of the fiercest critics of the NATO campaign. It will be argued that this is an inaccurate caricature of <b>South</b> <b>Africa’s</b> foreign policy and <b>that</b> <b>South</b> <b>Africa’s</b> approach could in fact inject vital pluralism into debates about the future of humanitarian interventions in Africa. The article draws upon interviews with senior officials in the ruling African National Congress (ANC) and South African officials who negotiated the UN Security Council resolutions that sanctioned intervention in Libya...|$|R

40|$|The study broadly {{focused on}} {{examining}} {{the trade and}} investment relationship between <b>South</b> <b>Africa</b> and the BRIC, using both descriptive and vector autoregressive estimation approaches. Specifically, the key objective is to investigate the impact of trade shocks between <b>South</b> <b>Africa</b> and the individual countries of the BRIC bloc. The findings illustrate <b>that</b> <b>South</b> <b>Africa’s</b> trade was more intense with India in the review period followed by trade with China. The impulse-response outcome showed <b>that</b> <b>South</b> <b>Africa’s</b> GDP reverts faster to equilibrium {{in the event of}} a shock in exports to and imports from Brazil. Also, when there is a shock to GDP, <b>South</b> <b>Africa’s</b> imports from Brazil reverts faster to equilibrium. The results of the variance decomposition indicate that inflation accounted for the highest variation in <b>South</b> <b>Africa’s</b> exports to and imports from both Brazil and China. Similarly, inflation explained the greatest variation in the GDP, while the greatest variation in the domestic inflation rate is explained by its own shock...|$|R

40|$|<b>South</b> <b>Africa</b> has rapidly reduced trade {{barriers}} {{since the end}} of Apartheid, yet agricultural production and exports have remained sluggish. Also, poverty and unemployment have risen and become increasingly concentrated in rural areas. This paper examines the extent to which remaining price distortions, both domestic and foreign, are contributing to the underperformance of the agricultural sector vis-à-vis the rest of the economy. We draw on a computable general equilibrium (CGE) and micro-simulation model of <b>South</b> <b>Africa</b> <b>that</b> are linked to the results of a global trade model. This framework is used {{to examine the effects of}} eliminating global and domestic price distortions. Model results indicate <b>that</b> <b>South</b> <b>Africa’s</b> agricultural sector currently benefits from global price distortions, and that removing these would create more jobs for lower-skilled workers, thereby reducing income inequality and poverty. We also find <b>that</b> <b>South</b> <b>Africa’s</b> own policies are biased against agriculture and that removing domestic distortions would raise agricultural production. Job losses in nonagricultural sectors would be outweighed by job creation in agriculture, such that overall employment rises and poverty falls. Overall, our findings suggest <b>that</b> <b>South</b> <b>Africa’s</b> own policies are more damaging to its welfare, poverty and inequality than distortionary policies in the rest of the world. Existing national price distortions may thus explain some of the poor performance of <b>South</b> <b>Africa’s</b> agricultural sector and rural development.
