5|$|After the Treaty of Ryswick ended {{war between}} the French and English in 1697, the French {{continued}} to make war on <b>the</b> <b>Iroquois</b> (primarily through their Algonquian allies in the Great Lakes region), and inflicted significant casualties on them. <b>The</b> <b>Iroquois</b> sought {{the assistance of the}} English to combat this, threatening to make peace with the French if they did not receive help. Bellomont and French Governor General Louis-Hector de Callière both claimed dominance over <b>the</b> <b>Iroquois,</b> and each refused to acknowledge the other's right to intercede on their behalf. When Callière summoned <b>the</b> <b>Iroquois</b> to Montreal for negotiations in 1699, Bellomont was alerted, and successfully manoeuvred <b>the</b> <b>Iroquois</b> into not going by sending an emissary to Montreal and troops to Albany under Lieutenant Governor Nanfan. The English emissary was unsuccessful in swaying the French from their course of action, and French-allied Algonquians made incursions deep into Iroquois territory in 1700.|$|E

5|$|Francis Parkman, an American {{historian}} {{who was one}} of the first to write about natives within the colonial historical narrative, argues that <b>the</b> <b>Iroquois</b> wars “were products of an ‘insensate fury’ and ‘mad ambition’". He said that <b>the</b> <b>Iroquois</b> waged wars due to the extinction of the beaver, their growing dependence on European goods, and resentment at the extermination of native culture. Parkman argues that <b>the</b> <b>Iroquois</b> had become so dependent on European goods that they needed these items in order to survive. In his research, Parkman had no evidence to support his claims. He assumed that the natives’ culture was inferior to the British-American, and overlooked potential reasons for <b>the</b> <b>Iroquois</b> attacks. Parkman’s interpretation neglected to explain why <b>the</b> <b>Iroquois</b> had waged war against other native groups as well. Parkman’s view would later on be dismissed due to its ethnocentric interpretation of the events.|$|E

5|$|The {{relationship}} between the French and <b>the</b> <b>Iroquois</b> was strained long before the Lachine Massacre, as the French maintained relations with other tribes as well, for both trade and war alliances, such as the Abenaki. In 1679, {{following the end of}} <b>the</b> <b>Iroquois</b> war with the Susquehannock and the Mahican, <b>the</b> <b>Iroquois</b> raided native villages in the West. Pushing out Siouan tribes to the west, they claimed hunting grounds in the Ohio Valley by right of conquest. These were kept empty of inhabitants in order to encourage hunting. As a result, <b>the</b> <b>Iroquois</b> regularly raided trading parties in the western frontier which was under French protection, and took loot from them. Following military confrontation in 1684, though <b>the</b> <b>Iroquois</b> negotiated a peace treaty with New France governor Le Febvre de la Barre, the treaty stated <b>the</b> <b>Iroquois</b> were free to attack the western Indians. The French Crown objected to the treaty, and replaced LaBarre with the Marquis de Denonville. He was less sympathetic to native relations, and did not pay attention to the Iroquois-Algonquian tensions. In part, <b>the</b> <b>Iroquois</b> attacked the French because they were not willing to accept constraints against their warfare related to traditional Iroquois enemies.|$|E

They and other tribes used the Pine Creek Path through the gorge, traveling between a path on the Genesee River in modern New York in the north, and the Great Shamokin Path along the West Branch Susquehanna River in the south. The Seneca tribe of <b>the</b> <b>Iroquois</b> believed that Pine Creek Gorge was sacred land and never established a permanent settlement there.

5|$|Before 1600, a major {{war broke}} out in eastern North America among Native Americans; it was later called the Beaver Wars. Five American Indian Iroquois tribes confederated to battle against their neighbors. <b>The</b> <b>Iroquois</b> were opposed by a {{confederation}} of primarily Algonquian tribes including the Shawnee, Miami, Wea, Pottawatomie, and the Illinois. These tribes were significantly less advanced than the Mississippian culture that had preceded them. The tribes were semi-nomadic, used stone tools rather than copper, and did not create the large-scale construction and farming works of their Mississippian predecessors. The war continued with sporadic fighting {{for at least a}} century as <b>the</b> <b>Iroquois</b> sought to dominate the expanding fur trade with the Europeans.
