This paper explores the effects of the top-down initiative of the National Numeracy Strategy (NNS) on a group of primary trainee teachers in England, and is based on the findings of an empirical study in which the data were gathered through in-depth interviewing. It is suggested that the student teachers see the NNS as a helpful framework for developing their professional expertise in an area where they often have experienced some anxiety. The ways in which the NNS has impacted on the trainees' understanding of their <b>task</b> <b>as</b> <b>teachers</b> of mathematics in a primary school are also examined...|$|E
40|$|Although our {{ultimate}} goal is to enable our learners to become autonomous and efficient in their use of the foreign language, whether or not they have the opportunity to ever live and interact in a foreign language setting, our work as teachers must involve a conscious analysis of the different factors involved in this process, as well as the conscious effort to put all the intervening factors into action. Furthermore, it is our responsibility to develop the learners¿ thinking skills as they increase their competence in the target language {{and at the same time}} make them aware of their responsibility for their own processes and success by enhancing their autonomy and making them aware of the value of learning strategies. It is our <b>task</b> <b>as</b> <b>teachers</b> to be present on this journey and guide our learners towards becoming architects and masters of their own foreign language construct. In order for this journey to be a successful one, we must make sure we provide the learner with a correct supply of building blocks.

40|$|Proefskrif [...] PU vir CHO 1. Research into {{developments}} in the practical training of teachers in South Africa, especially in the Transvaal, revealed many shortcomings in the initial form of teacher training, viz. the pupil-teacher system. From inception, the first Transvaal colleges of education attempted to establish demonstration schools on or off campus. These attempts proved unsuccessful and were finally abandoned in the late 1930 's. Since then a system of combined practical training in the training institutions and in teaching practice schools became general. 2. Empirical research into the practical training of teachers in the Transvaal {{was carried out by}} means of questionnaires to students and lecturers of training institutions and to principals and teachers of teaching practice schools. a. The main research findings on training at the training institutions are: (1) Demonstration lessons by students and lecturers using school pupils are rarely attempted, probably because of inadequate facilities. (2) Students' training in the employment and techniques of teaching aids was found inadequate. (3) A considerable percentage of students do not actively participate in common students' activities. Training in leadership is indirect through participation in students' societies and other activities. The conclusion is that students receive inadequate training for their comprehensive <b>task</b> <b>as</b> <b>teachers.</b> (4) Few institutions provide even limited facilities for scientifically planned child study and child guidance. b. Practical training during teaching practice reveals the following main shortcomings: (1) Although most principals and teachers accept co-responsibility for the training of teachers, they lack sufficient time to devote to students. (2) The differing standards and requirements demanded in criticism lessons by individual lecturers, cause confusion and frustration amongst students. (3) A marked difference in the subject and method approach between lecturers and teachers was found. (4) Poor liaison and co-operation between lecturers and teachers in that they seldom act as a team in the training of students, constitutes a great weakness in the present training system at teaching practice schools. (5) The study reveals that although at many schools students find teaching practice a rewarding and stimulating experience, at other schools little guidance or assistance is given. Finally, the study underlines the necessity in the practical training of teachers for a combined lecturer, principal, teacher team approach. Doctora...|$|E
40|$|In {{the current}} {{educational}} framework {{and with the}} new Plurilingual Programmes, {{there is a tendency}} to introduce L 2 instruction at early ages along with increased exposure to L 2 by teaching non-linguistic areas in English. For this reason, the introduction of literacy in English makes more sense in this new context since it allows an approach to teaching, writing and reading English at an earlier age and it is also necessary to have good reading comprehension and writing expression abilities in order to succeed when learning other areas of the curriculum in English.

This action research project {{gave me the opportunity}} to think about {{the importance of}} task design and think about what is the point in the <b>tasks</b> <b>as</b> <b>teachers</b> we plan. I carried out evaluation of my own personal historic lesson plans to help understand the planning of tasks and then planned two schemes of work. These schemes of work were planned and developed with the use of literature, students' feedback and my own personal reflection. Learning diaries were used in the second feedback to give students more ownership of their learning and inform me for future planning. Findings indicated that knowledge is an important factor when planning lessons and developing task design. Knowledge should be at the forefront of planning. Knowledge has been discussed in detail (Firth, 2015 b, Lambert, 2011 & DfE, 2013). The introduction of the new curriculum has allowed knowledge to be at the forefront of planning and given teachers the opportunity to think about task design centred around knowledge. Enquiry learning was also thought about with knowledge. Enquiry learning is a complex idea that needs to be carefully used in lessons to ensure knowledge is not lost. </p...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2010. With the {{implementation}} of Curriculum 2005 (C 2005) in South Africa profound changes were also made to technical education. For example, the name technical education made way for the name technology education, the senior secondary phase was replaced with the Further Education and Training band (FET), the syllabuses made way for curricula and all technical subjects were restructured, reduced and re-curriculated to four new subjects. These four new subjects are defined in the New Curriculum Statement (NCS) documents and should be taught according to the Outcomes-Based Education (OBE) principles. This study was undertaken to determine the nature of technology education in the phase, what competencies these teachers should have and what the perceptions of final year students in this phase are, regarding their vocational competencies. The above named objectives were aimed at contributing guidelines {{with the purpose of}} improving the training of FET technology teachers. In order to answer the above named questions a literature review, a qualitative and a quantitative study was undertaken. The literature revealed that technology teaching in the FET phase in South Africa has to do with education that focuses on the teaching of technological knowledge, skills, attitudes and values. The technology education in this phase focuses on electrical, mechanical, civil and design fields, with emphasis on problem solutions and the achievement of four well-defined outcomes. The implementation of FET technology in South Africa follows the international trend to place all training with a technical or technology bias under the banner of technology education because teaching only knowledge and skills were no longer sufficient. Because South Africa is still a developing country, there are unique and distinctive problems facing the effective teaching of technology. In order to train teachers effectively for the new curriculum the opinions of practicing school 'principals and experienced teachers in FET technology should be asked to determine what is expected from these novice teachers in practise. A qualitative study revealed that principals and other senior staff members of technical schools (FET) have certain expectations with regard to the competencies and capabilities of their technology teachers. These requirements, for example, includes professional competencies, general, teaching and practical skills and abilities such as subject knowledge and didactical knowledge. In a qualitative study, in which 20 of the final year FET technology students participated, it was found that according to them, they are, to a great extent, equipped for their <b>task</b> <b>as</b> <b>teachers.</b> With few exceptions, the students felt that they were well-equipped in terms of professional, general, teaching and practical skills as they were properly guided in subject and didactic knowledge. As for the training of technical teachers in the FET phase, {{it was found that the}} training to a large extent meets the demands of education and the needs of schools, but that there are one or two areas of training that might be improved on and that there are certain misconceptions when students need to judge the value of certain modules. These misconceptions or problem areas mainly focus on the educational programme, practical teaching, education administration and training in practical skills. Specific recommendations are made regarding the training of technical teachers for the FET phase: Recommendations from this study focus on: • Better planned, more effective and relevant workshop practical training. • Greater exposure to, or better planned exposure to, practical education. • Better definition or tuition of educational and didactical modules. • Specific modules exposing students to more imitated administrative tasks. • Promotion of workshop safety. This study focused on the nature of technology education in the FET band in South Africa, the training of teachers who must be able to teach technology in the FET band and the unique abilities they should possess. Recommendations from this study can thus contribute in improving FET technology training in South Africa. Master...|$|E

The subject-head can also play an important and valuable role in the initial in-service training programme by conveying knowledge and expertise concerning teaching practice, to the artisan-teacher. In the designing of an initial in-service training programme, attention should be given to the practical side of the subject, so that the knowledge acquired can be implemented immediately. Later in the training programme more time can be allocated to the theoretical aspect. The aim of this programme should be to encourage the artisan-teacher to acquire formal teaching qualifications. The school's in-service training programme is only an endeavor to provide the artisan-teacher with sufficient knowledge to teach his subject.

40|$|This chapter {{will explore}} how {{assessment}} might look in next generation learning spaces {{where we have}} the potential to merge physical and virtual activities. Students now have ready access to a world of resources within their classroom and this fundamentally changes the nature of learning and assessment. The trend toward gamification of learning and assessment will be examined and the issue of assessment in new educational environments such as MOOCs will be explored. The impact of the semantic web (Web 3. 0), where web objects and their context are all linked and objects have memory of how an individual student used them on previous occasions, will be discussed. Next generation learning spaces encapsulate the affordances of both physical and virtual spaces and yet many assessment tasks are still designed as if students occupied only one of these spaces. Teachers will need to design more authentic, meaningful tasks that will engage students in using the full range of their capabilities and available resources, both physical and virtual. Students come together physically to engage in the social construction of their knowledge and can use the virtual spaces to broaden the social dimension of their learning environment. Gamification of learning and assessment will require new approaches to defining <b>tasks</b> <b>as</b> <b>teachers</b> will need to decide how to incorporate diagnostic, formative, and summative assessment components within a more holistic educational environment.

With this we also want to increase the understanding for the teacher profession and our important mission. We will fulfil this purpose through investigating what previous research has said about the importance of education in general and what education does for a woman's life in Nigeria in particular. We will explore the effects of education for women in their cultural context. ·What has been said about the importance of education {{for the development of the}} society and the individual? ·How does education affect a Nigerian woman's view of herself? ·What happens in a woman's life and mind when she goes from being an illiterate person to a reading and writing person? Method We have made six qualitative interviews with Nigerian women who did not get the opportunity to a basic education as children. They are now attending a Christian adult school in Jos, Nigeria to learn how to read and write. Findings The women feel that the education has changed their view of themselves in many aspects. They have developed a higher confidence and are more independent than before. They feel more included in society when they have become literate. They have also got a more significant female consciousness through the education. The school's Christian approach permeates all the education and the students' subjective identity strengthens in accordance with the Christian values. We have noticed a difference in how long the women have attended the school and how much they have strengthen their identity through their way of answering our questions. Even though the women have increased their confidence, independence and female consciousness we have also seen a limit for how far this development can proceed. Their view of womanhood is within the frames of patriarchy and therefore the effects of education for these women are also within patriarchy. A conclusion we can draw is that education and the effects of education are highly connected to the context and the culture where it operates. Education's role in society becomes clearer when investigating it in a society where it is not obvious for all. This has given us a new perspective on education's role in a society. We have a clearer image about how a society's values are related to education and reproduced in school.

The overall purpose {{of the project was}} to describe, to analyse, and to interpret teachers’ teaching and assessment practices in a variety of undergraduate foundational courses of either practical or theoretical/practical nature in each one of the following knowledge domains: Social Sciences, Arts and Humanities, Health Sciences, and Sciences and Technologies. Besides, the project was also aimed at studying teacher and student perceptions on a variety of assessment, teaching, and learning dimensions. This presentation will be based upon the study that was developed within the four Portuguese universities that participated in the investigation. Thus, pedagogical aspects such as the following has been analyzed: a) teaching organization and classroom dynamics; b) teaching and assessment <b>tasks</b> <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>teacher</b> and student roles; c) feedback; and d) utilization of assessments. Data were collected through classroom observations and both teacher and student interviews. Besides, in order to study student’s and teacher’s perceptions, a 45 -item questionnaire on teaching, learning, and assessment issues was administered. Results have shown that although different professors shared quite similar pedagogical perspectives, they made use of different teaching and assessment practices. The study also showed that structured classes with clear and well defined purposes; diversified teaching and assessment dynamics; utilization of carefully selected tasks; student active participation in the learning and assessment processes; distribution of high quality feedback; utilization of formative assessment; and utilization of self and combined modes of assessment, are closely related to better student learning, according to both professors and students accounts. Questionnaire results illustrate that teachers and students share the same perceptions concerning many assessment, learning, and teaching issues. However, one could also notice that there are some critical issues on assessment and teaching that clearly divide teacher’s and student’s perceptions. Besides, this research enabled one {{to come up with some}} reflections on task nature, student participation, feedback, and quality of learning. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

40|$|This licentiate thesis {{builds on}} the {{assumption}} that there is a shift in professional perspective when a police officer takes on the task of a police teacher in the Police Basic Education Training Programme. This shift of perspective is described as a professional process as well as a learning process, and the investigation focuses the reshaping of one’s professional identity. The investigation is based on focus group interviews with four different groups of police teachers in Växjö, Stockholm, and Umeå, where they were asked to talk about their <b>task</b> <b>as</b> police <b>teachers.</b> The analysis is built on theories from George Herbert Mead, Moira von Wright, and Ludwik Fleck about the importance of in-tersubjective interaction in the interpersonal or social perspective of construction knowledge about oneself as a subject and the surrounding world. Professional identity is defined as the way, consciously or unconsciously, an individual under-stands oneself as a professional; it is seen as an ongoing process shaped by con-tinuous intersubjective meetings with others in a changeable world. Professional, personal and possibly tacit knowledge is in that aspect developed and may be pos-sible to articulate in the right environment, for example within focus groups. The findings indicate that the change of professional task of the police teachers affects their understanding of themselves as professionals, i. e., their professional identity. The development of new professional and personal knowledge is due to the ability to reflect on the outcome of the intersubjective meetings with students and other teachers. This change of professional identity of the police teachers complicates their mission in two aspects. First, the denial of the relationship with the students as colleagues could be in conflict with the expectation from the stu-dent police officers. Secondly, the gap in knowledge about police work between the reflected personal knowledge of the police teachers and the student police offi-cers’ knowledge built on movies and books makes it difficult to meet the students at their level. This situation demands opportunities for police teachers to discuss their tasks with other teachers on campus, in the context of intersubjective meet-ings...|$|R

I acted as a researcher as well <b>as</b> a <b>teacher.</b> The major findings of the study are as follows: 1. In the present context, the formation of Cooperative learning groups is difficult and time consuming. Students are used to working with their own selected group, so when groups were formed, many students were felt challenged because it disturbed their statues quo in class. It was difficult for a single teacher to manage the formation of self-selected and random-groups in a large classroom within a short time. So the teacher need to be sensitive to process of group formation. 2. Teaching Social skills is a huge task and complex process. It requires considerable practice and patience. A teacher must have a constant focus on the proper use of Social skills can encourage low-ability students to feel comfortable in the classroom. 3. Effective Positive Interdependence and Individual Accountability depend {{on the nature of the}} task. The teacher needs to have a clear understanding of the task and its objectives. It is difficult to select the <b>task</b> <b>as</b> a novice <b>teacher.</b> Positive feedback can support Positive Interdependence and Individual Accountability. 4.

However, this learning is not compatible with the existing practice of student assessment. In the present practice, the Social objectives of a student are not assessed, and the student 2 ̆ 7 s opinion is overlooked. The exam only looks for the accuracy and knowledge as peer the textbook.

30|$|Throughout the Stanford team’s {{planning}} {{and implementation of}} the TLP meetings, we included activities in which TLs engaged <b>as</b> <b>teachers</b> and <b>as</b> <b>teacher</b> leaders. To help the TLs differentiate between learning experiences related to these two roles, we adopted the use of explicit language to identify when they were in “teacher” mode and when they were in “teacher leader” mode. We kept these activities distinct and identified them explicitly by noting when they were changing “hats.” For example, all VBDs during the TLP meetings were designed to include two components. First, TLs engaged <b>as</b> <b>teachers</b> by watching the video and discussing what they noticed and learned about the mathematics, learning, and teaching. Next, we asked the TLs to switch to their teacher leader hats, and we led them through a debrief of the facilitators’ moves. This approach also helped us embed the PSC work for the TLs <b>as</b> <b>teachers</b> without having them be confused by {{whether or not they were}} engaged in an activity <b>as</b> a <b>teacher</b> (PSC) or <b>as</b> a <b>teacher</b> leader (TLP).|$|R
