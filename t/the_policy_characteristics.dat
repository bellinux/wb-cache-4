We propose a series of quantitative metrics to assess comprehensive complexity of policies. By comprehensive, we mean the difficulty of understanding a policy by administrators. We formalize the concepts of authorization-based access control models, to propose general metrics regardless of the model. We also show the application of the proposed metrics through a content management system (CMS) policy example. We outline a proof-of-concept to evaluate the feasibility of our proposal, based on SELinux policies for a general-purpose CM...|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{provides}} an overview of recent biotechnology developments in ten CEE countries which joined the EU in 2004 and 2007. The overview covers the period 2002 - 2005 and considers these countries' performance in biotechnology as well as their policies and funding for biotechnology research and commercialisation. The chapter presents data and indicators of biotechnology performance, the arrangements for policy-making, the funding of biotechnology research and a discussion of <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> <b>characteristics</b> likely to support the development of biotechnology S&T systems. Findings show that countries are developing capabilities in biotechnology which contributes to a competence to absorb and utilise the knowledge that is being created {{in the rest of the}} world. There is a trend to focus on research related to pharmaceutical biotechnology and its applications. However, this strategy has limited potential to support economic growth in countries which lack a strong pharmaceutical sector. The study concludes that CEE countries are more likely to gain economic benefits from their biotechnology research by identifying and supporting several areas of biotechnology research relevant to strong economic sectors within their countries...|$|E

The qualitative research model that was employed in this study was directed toward developing an understanding of the elements of the policies of selected public virtual universities in the United States. The methodology of this study also provided a means for the classification of the public virtual universities by utilizing the Wolf and Johnstone Institutional Taxonomy. The classification of the public virtual universities in the United States led to the selection of six public virtual universities that were included in the policy analysis component of the study. The six public virtual universities included the California Virtual University, the Florida Virtual Campus, the Kentucky Commonwealth Virtual University, the Minnesota Virtual University, the State University of New York Learning Network, and the University of Texas Telecampus. The policy analysis component of this study examined variations in policy themes and patterns related to <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> <b>characteristics</b> that existed in the public virtual universities. The findings of this study provide insight into the various issues related to the development and operation of a public virtual university in the United States. The operational issues examined in this study include commitment to access to education, development of online student services, attention to faculty resources, issues related to institutional strategic planning, and issues related to institutional funding. The key conclusions that emerged from this examination suggested three primary policy areas that can have significant impact on the development and successful operation of a public virtual university. These policy areas include the development of comprehensive student services, the availability of faculty development resources, and maintaining a central theme of access to education...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the role of}} public policy in the skills development system of the U. S. It further examines the implications of that policy for the skill development and career progression of black workers. The paper describes the current "system" for skills development in the United States as a two-tiered system: The "first-chance" or conventional system allows individuals to proceed through an extensive public elementary, secondary, and postsecondary educational sector that is supplemented by private educational institutions and is followed by employer-provided job training and work experience. The "second-chance" system is designed for individuals who do not successfully traverse the first-chance system. The second-chance system includes public job training programs, public assistance, rehabilitation programs for offenders, and educational remediation. The public agency for labor market exchange, the Employment Service, has tended to {{play a significant role}} in facilitating employment in the second-chance system. Paradoxically, despite the tremendous success of the U. S. economy, including the fact that it has the world's leading level of worker productivity, there is a pervasive perception that the current system for skills development in the U. S. is failing. Lagging school achievement (particularly in urban areas), high unemployment rates for certain groups of the population, and employer concerns about the quality of entry level workers suggest that the current system may be neither efficient nor equitable. The paper starts out by considering the rationale for public policy intervention in the skills development process. It then reviews public policy at the federal, state, and local levels that fosters skills development. At the federal level, the major policy emphasis currently is the consolidation of job training and labor market exchange programs through the Workforce Investment Act (WIA). State and local entities administer federal programs, but many states have also enacted supplemental programs in the area of skills development. After examining specific federal and state/local policy, the paper reviews recent policy demonstrations in the area of skills development. The review of the evaluative evidence leads to several general "best practice" principles about content, delivery mechanisms, and administrative characteristics. The last section of the paper reviews how well federal WIA programs are likely to fare against the best practices criteria. The major thrusts in skills development policy have been accountability, market-driven choice, decentralization/devolution, emphasis on immediate work, private-sector leadership, and consolidation. <b>The</b> <b>policy</b> <b>characteristics</b> that are in disfavor seem to be eligibility set asides, process regulations, service delivery by administrative agencies, subsidized education and training, technical assistance, and research and development. African Americans, who reside disproportionately in urban areas and who participate in the second-chance system, will be affected by these changes in emphasis. Public policy has evolved from a top-down, centralized system with regulatory protections and emphasis on equal access to an open, decentralized system operated largely by state bureaucrats and governed by individuals at the local level who happen to take an interest and who happen to know the right individuals at the right time. Theoretical arguments can be made that the new system will be more efficient and more equitable and counterarguments can be offered that the system will result in outcomes that are highly varied across localities and racial groups. public policy, skill development, careers, blacks, Bartik, Hollenbeck...|$|E

When both demographics and communications indicated discrimination was acceptable, the degree of discrimination was greater than when there was a single source of justification.

40|$|In {{the first}} decade {{following}} the annexation of Bessarabia, the Russian authorities simoultaneously pursued two different approaches without fully realizing their contradictions. On the one hand, they sought to win support of the Bessarabian nobility by recognizing their land titles in the former Hotin reaya and proclaiming local autonomy based {{on the law of}} the land. On the other hand, they sought to colonize the underpopulated lands of Southern Bessarabia by inviting transdanubian Bulgarians and other ethnic groups. Although both approaches envisioned the transformation of the new province into a new homeland for the co-religionist Balkan peoples, their combination provoked social tensions between the the Bessarabian landowners and the colonists. The paper argues that the prolonged conflict between the two groups ultimately illustrates the uncertainty of Bessarabia’s status in the political geography of the Russian empire during {{the first decade}}s after 1812.
