5|$|<b>The</b> <b>front</b> <b>cover</b> {{depicted}} {{an advanced}} civilization {{with a vast}} landscape of skyscrapers and red, sunburst-like flames {{rising out of the}} cityscape as representations of Agharta's power. Yokoo used a combination of collage, airbrushing, and painting techniques as he had with his previous work, along with postcards collected from his trips to Tahiti and New York City; the cityscape on <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>cover</b> was taken from one of his postcards. The back cover showed the city submerged in water, embedded in coral reefs, and hovered over by a diver, fish, and a squid ascending from the city. According to graphic designers Storm Thorgerson and Aubrey Powell, Yokoo depicted groups of jellyfish, coral reefs, and brightly colored fish to suggest an association between Agharta and Atlantis. The foreground of the back cover's illustration featured a reptilian creature. Cultural studies researcher Dagmar Buchwald interpreted this image as an allusion to similar ideas about Lemuria; this mythological continent supposedly existed during Earth's prehistory and was inhabited by an advanced civilization, later forced under the Earth's surface after its homeland was destroyed by a great flood.|$|E

5|$|O'Donnell hired Chalkie Davies, a {{photographer}} for New Musical Express {{for two weeks}} to photograph the band on a US tour in early 1978 in order to capture enough pictures suitable for the album artwork. <b>The</b> <b>front</b> <b>cover,</b> featuring Lynott in the foreground, was originally {{supposed to be the}} back cover as the group wanted equal coverage of all members. O'Donnell disagreed and reversed the front and back photographs at the last minute. The album had a working title of Thin Lizzy Live but Lynott decided that Live and Dangerous was better.|$|E
