5|$|The {{different}} types of rock beneath the soil strongly influence the landscape; they determine the type of vegetation <b>that</b> <b>will</b> grow, and ultimately the type of animal <b>that</b> <b>will</b> inhabit the area. Limestone has fissures and is soluble in water, therefore rivers {{have been able to}} carve deep, narrow valleys. The rivers then often find routes underground, creating cave systems. Millstone Grit is insoluble but porous, absorbing water which seeps through the grits, until it meets the less porous shales beneath, creating springs where it reaches the surface. The shales are friable and easily attacked by frost and form areas that are vulnerable to landslides, as on Mam Tor.|$|E
