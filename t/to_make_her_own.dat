She befriended American aviation pioneer Amelia Earhart, who, unbeknownst to Kalep, was planning a similar feat. After Earhart's successful flight from Canada to Ireland on 20 May, Kalep decided {{that it would not be}} worthwhile <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> attempt at flying across the Atlantic, since she would no longer be the first woman to do so. She continued to encourage other women to enter the field of aviation, however, and became a member of the Ninety-Nines, an international organisation for women pilots which was founded by Earhart and 98 other female aviators. In August 1932, Kalep planned to fly with Roger Q. Williams from Los Angeles to Athens to celebrate the former city's hosting of the 1932 Summer Olympics, but their flight was canceled. Soon after, it was reported that Kalep had remarried to W. E. Hutton-Miller, an American stockbroker.|$|E

25|$|Mayumi Kojima {{was born}} in Tokyo. When she was in high school, she heard some music by Rosemary Clooney and {{suddenly}} became captivated by American 50s music. But English lyrics were troublesome, so she decided <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> music. In childhood, influenced by her brother, she enjoyed listening to classical music, but with the new influence of 50s and 60s pop, she wanted to cross jazzy rhythms with different musical genres like the old pop artists did. At the age of 18, she wrote her first song, , and the demo tape was noticed by a record company. From then on, {{her life as a}} musician started.

25|$|Fefe Dobson's self titled {{debut album}} is {{generally}} pop-rock, {{as well as}} some traces of punk music. Several songs on the album are also in an acoustic format, stripped down to just Dobson and the guitar. The music was different from most music put out at the time, such as recent releases by Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera. In fact, Dobson originally signed with Jive Records, who intended to make her the next big pop star. However, Dobson didn't want to be a pop-star and wanted <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> type of music, and quickly left the label. For Dobson second official album Joy she worked producers David Lichens, Jon Levine, Howard Benson and Bob Ezrin on Joy, Dobson lives up to the portraits of her heroes she first hung during the recording of her first album—Kurt Cobain, Judy Garland, Coldplay, The Vines and Jeff Buckley. She co-wrote most of the songs on the album, usually composing on guitar, her choice of instrument.|$|E
500|$|Campbell {{noted that}} the {{popularity}} and the media mayhem around the song and the video, helped introduce the concept of free publicity. [...] "Like a Prayer"s impact was more evident on its parent studio album, which shot {{to the top of}} the charts once it was released in April 1989. The author further argued that the controversial clip was evidence of the emergence of the [...] "video commodity as a different entity from the song that spawned it". As author Judith Marcus explained in her book, Surviving the Twentieth Century, Madonna used the church <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> point on victimization. For Marcus the main impact lay in the fact that the clip ultimately portrayed an empowerment message, questioning and [...] "attacking" [...] the Church's male prejudice and continuous female subjugation throughout history.|$|E

[...] Being [...] "imprisoned" [...] is also presented, a fate that occurs {{to most of the}} characters – Aladdin and Jasmine are limited by their lifestyles, Genie is attached to his lamp, and Jafar to the Sultan – and is represented visually by the prison-like walls and bars of the Agrabah palace, and the scene involving caged birds which Jasmine later frees.
