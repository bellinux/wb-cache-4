Because of the vast variation demonstrated for both vibrator output and tissue damping, the thresholds were expressed in terms of amplitude of stimulator movement measured by means of an accelerometer, instead of applied voltage which is commonly used. Statistical analysis revealed a higher power of discimination for amplitude measurements at all three stimulus sites. Digital read-out gave the best statistical result and was also most practical. Reference values obtained from 110 healthy males, 10 to 74 years of age, were highly correlated with age for both upper and lower extremities.

40|$|A {{survey of}} papers using {{auditory}} evoked potentials (AEPs) published over the last 10 years (Table I) demonstrates that most AEP studies in animals have used subjective methods for auditory <b>threshold</b> <b>determination.</b> Subjective methods greatly reduce the value of statistical hypothesis testing and jeopardize tests of hypothetical experimental group differences in hearing sensitivity. Correspondingly, many {{attempts have been made}} to develop objective <b>threshold</b> <b>determination</b> methods, but these have not been used widely. Further, they seldom include an appreciation of the effects of residual noise in the AEP. In this study, AEPs evoked by tonal and noise stimuli in goldfish (Carassius auratus) were recorded and the residual background noise was measured and analyzed in detail. High variability was found in residual noise, but can be effectively controlled with a simple modification of averaging routines. Considerable interobserver disagreements were found using subjective threshold estimation. An objective method of <b>threshold</b> <b>determination</b> was developed based on comparison between AEP amplitude and controlled residual noise, using a signal detection theory approach to set specific threshold criteria.

40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{revealed}} considerable variations in human chemosensory capacities. Considerable interindividual differences in sensitivity to various odorants and specific hyposmias are well known. Many chemical {{studies have focused}} on elucidating structure-odour relationships on the basis of detection threshold measurements. The basic idea of quantitative structure-activity relationship studies is that a molecule's structure provides information about its biological activity. In a recent sensory assay of 2 -bromo- 4 -methylphenol, Barbe et al. (2014) highlighted a noticeable bimodal distribution of individual sensitivity with large interindividual differences. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the link between the chemical structure of 2 -bromo- 4 -methylphenol and this bimodal distribution.

40|$|The {{ambiguity}} {{acceptance test}} {{is an important}} quality control procedure in high precision GNSS data processing. Although the ambiguity acceptance test methods have been extensively investigated, its threshold determine method is still not well understood. Currently, the threshold is determined with the empirical approach or the fixed failure rate (FF-) approach. The empirical approach is simple but lacking in theoretical basis, while the FF-approach is theoretical rigorous but computationally demanding. Hence, the key of the <b>threshold</b> <b>determination</b> problem is how to efficiently determine the threshold in a reasonable way. In this study, a new <b>threshold</b> <b>determination</b> method named threshold function method is proposed to reduce {{the complexity of the}} FF-approach. The threshold function method simplifies the FF-approach by a modeling procedure and an approximation procedure. The modeling procedure uses a rational function model to describe the relationship between the FF-difference test threshold and the integer least-squares (ILS) success rate. The approximation procedure replaces the ILS success rate with the easy-to-calculate integer bootstrapping (IB) success rate. Corresponding modeling error and approximation error are analysed with simulation data to avoid nuisance biases and unrealistic stochastic model impact. The results indicate the proposed method can greatly simplify the FF-approach without introducing significant modeling error. The threshold function method makes the fixed failure rate <b>threshold</b> <b>determination</b> method feasible for real-time applications...|$|E
40|$|Quantitative {{sensory testing}} {{was used to}} assess the {{prevalence}} of sensory dysfunction in patients with cancer, carefully screened for other risk factors for neuropathy. Large fibre type sensory function was evaluated using vibration <b>threshold</b> (VT) <b>determinations</b> while small fibre type sensory function was assessed by thermal <b>threshold</b> (TT) <b>determinations.</b> Mean VT and TT were significantly elevated in the toes but not the fingers of cancer patients. VT elevations in the toes occurred in 31 % of cancer patients and in 6 % of control subjects. TT elevations in the toes occurred in 43 % of cancer patients and 4 % of control subjects. Based on these findings it is concluded that large and small fibre type sensory dysfunction is much more common in carefully screened cancer patients than in control subjects. This sensory dysfunction is most likely to represent a neuropathy related directly or indirectly associated with cancer...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to remark {{possibilities}} to use WorldView- 2 imagery for coastline extraction. Applications are conducted on a Phlegrean area in the Campania Region (Italy) : the considered range of coastline is particularly interesting because it shows two typologies of shoreline including reefs interspersed with segments of sandy beach. Two indices are used: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI). To enhance geometric resolution of the results pan-sharpening is applied so as to obtain maps with the same pixel dimensions of the panchromatic data. To solve the problem of <b>thresholds</b> <b>determination</b> that typically affects the classification, Maximum Likelihood method based on training sites is adopted to distinguish bare soil and sea water.

40|$|Temporal {{and thermal}} {{differences}} between the initiation of precursor, eccrine sweat and its surface discharge were investigated during passive heating. Sudomotor activity was evaluated using electrodermal (precursor) and ventilated sweat capsule measurements (dorsal fingers, dorsal hand, forehead, forearm). Passive heating significantly elevated auditory canal (0. 5 oC) and mean body temperatures (0. 9 oC). At each site, the precursor sudomotor thresholds occurred at a lower mean body temperature (P[*] 3 ̆c[*]. 05), with an average elevation of 0. 35 oC (SD 0. 04). However, discharged thresholds were delayed until this temperature had risen 0. 53 oC (SD 0. 04), producing significant phase delays across sites (mean: 4. 1 [*]min [SD 0. 5]; P[*] 3 ̆c[*]. 05). It is concluded that precise sudomotor <b>threshold</b> <b>determinations</b> require methods that respond to sweat accumulating within the secretory coil, and not discharged secretions, reinforcing the importance of electrodermal techniques...|$|R

Using reconstruction data, image quality metrics, and calculations of artifact formation, a deeper understanding and explanation of the physical and technical limitations of CT used in dimensional metrology is given. This is demonstrated in a case study using a simple hollow cylinder made of steel as a test object and calibration measurements from a tactile coordinate measuring machine (CMM). Two different <b>threshold</b> <b>determination</b> strategies for surface computation are applied. Within the study it is also shown that CT image properties, <b>threshold</b> <b>determination</b> strategies, and systematic and random measurement errors must have a definite correlation. As a conclusion it is recommended to focus more strongly on the correlation of local CT image quality and data evaluation operations {{in order to reduce}} systematic errors in surface computation and to increase repeatability of dimensional CT measurements...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Finding known object(s) in static {{pictures}} or real-time streaming pictures {{is always an}} interesting topic for many applications. A well-known and reliable method is Symmetric Phase Only Matched Filter (SPOMF). After the SPOMF operation, a peak or multiple peaks in the correlated image will indicate the position(s) of the object(s). But {{the magnitude of the}} peak(s) can be very different for different images. And it is possible that faulty peaks and mountains have influence {{on the quality of the}} detection. In that case, a dynamic floating <b>threshold</b> <b>determination</b> algorithm is necessary to accurately detect the peak(s) in the correlated image. In this paper, a self-adaptive <b>threshold</b> <b>determination</b> algorithm is developed and discussed. An algorithm that maintains a real-time sorting for two sequenced queues in order to save one scan of the correlated image is also developed and implemented. Notice that the threshold can possibly detect some fake peaks that are adjacent to the real one. In order to get the true position of the object, those fake peaks should be removed. An algorithm that removes adjacent peaks is also developed...|$|E

50|$|The {{rules on}} {{admissibility}} of evidence {{are meant to}} be the only standards for admitting evidence.

The text of these rules does not require any other preliminary showing before admitting the evidence. Congress did not intend to superimpose another level of judicial oversight onto the admissibility rules; rather, it intended to ensure that no artificial barriers stood in the way of admitting probative evidence. The rules require the trial court to make <b>threshold</b> <b>determinations</b> on admissibility, including whether evidence is relevant, and whether it is not unfairly prejudicial.
