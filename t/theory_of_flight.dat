5|$|Unfortunately {{his desire}} to be a pilot was postponed. The family {{required}} further income after his father retired. Unable to wait for that opportunity to arise he joined the Royal Engineers on 26 April 1910, as No. 20083. On 24 February 1911 he set sail for Gibraltar on the southern tip of Spain. McCudden spent eighteen months in Gibraltar before returning to England in September 1912. While in Gibraltar he read Flight manual magazine habitually, which explained the <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>flight,</b> aircraft construction and aero engines. He excelled in his service and by 26 April 1913 he had become a qualified Sapper. He also held the grade Air Mechanic 2nd Class, No. 892, which was awarded to him on 28 April 1913. Soon afterwards he {{became a member of the}} Royal Flying Corps (RFC). On 9 May he was posted to Farnborough depot as a mechanic.|$|E
25|$|Painlevé's {{mathematical}} work on {{differential equations}} {{led him to}} encounter their application to the <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>flight</b> and, as ever, his broad interest in engineering topics fostered an enthusiasm for the emerging field of aviation. In 1908, he became Wilbur Wright's first airplane passenger in France and in 1909 created the first university course in aeronautics.|$|E
25|$|On 6 October 1945 Bryks {{returned}} to Czechoslovakia {{and his second}} wife Gertrude came with him. He resumed his Czechoslovak Air Force career but his injuries, and particularly his hearing loss, prevented him from continuing as a pilot. He was posted to the Military Aviation Academy at Olomouc, where he taught English and the <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>flight.</b> He was promoted to Captain in September 1945, Staff Captain in December 1945 and Major in May 1946. Also in 1946, Gertrude bore Bryks a daughter, Sonia.|$|E

25|$|After {{two years}} {{attending}} Milverton School, Whittle won {{a scholarship to}} a secondary school which in due course became Leamington College for Boys, but when his father's business faltered {{there was not enough}} money to keep him there. He quickly developed practical engineering skills while helping in his father's workshop, and being an enthusiastic reader spent much of his spare time in the Leamington reference library, reading about astronomy, engineering, turbines, and the <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>flight.</b> At the age of 15, determined to be a pilot, Whittle applied to join the RAF.|$|E
25|$|When Bonham Carter was five, {{her mother}} had a serious nervous breakdown, from which it took her three years to recover. Upon her recovery, her {{experience}} in therapy led her to become a psychotherapist herself – Bonham Carter now pays her to read her scripts and deliver her opinion of the characters' psychological motivations. Five years after her mother's recovery, her father was diagnosed with acoustic neuroma. He suffered complications during an operation to remove the tumour {{which led to a}} stroke that left him half-paralysed and using a wheelchair. With her brothers at college, Bonham Carter was left to help her mother cope. She later studied her father's movements and mannerisms for her role in The <b>Theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>Flight.</b> He died in January 2004.|$|E
2500|$|A three-part pilot {{training}} program was implemented beginning with {{two months of}} ground school, followed by preliminary flight training teaching student pilots to fly solo, and advanced flight training to qualification as a naval aviator with a commission in the Naval Reserve Flying Corps. The first ground school for pilot training was at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The first class of fifty student pilots arrived on 23 July 1917 for an eight-week program covering electricity, signals, photography, seamanship, navigation, gunnery, aeronautic engines, <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>flight,</b> and aircraft instruments. Later classes received an initial period of indoctrination and preliminary training aboard a receiving ship before assignment to ground school. Those who successfully completed ground school were transferred to naval air stations for flight training. In July 1918 parallel ground school programs began at the University of Washington in Seattle and at Dunwoody Institute in Minneapolis; but few graduates of these schools could be counted among the 18,000 naval aviation personnel who reached Europe before the war ended.|$|E

2500|$|He {{is mainly}} remembered for his {{pioneering}} studies and experiments with flying machines, including the working, piloted glider that he designed and built. He wrote a landmark three-part treatise titled [...] "On Aerial Navigation" [...] (1809–1810), {{which was published}} in Nicholson's Journal of Natural Philosophy, Chemistry and the Arts. The 2007 discovery of sketches in Cayley's school notebooks (held in the archive of the Royal Aeronautical Society Library) revealed that even at school Cayley was developing his ideas on the <b>theories</b> <b>of</b> <b>flight.</b> It has been claimed that these images indicate that Cayley identified the principle of a lift-generating inclined plane as early as 1792. To measure the drag on objects at different speeds and angles of attack, he later built a [...] "whirling-arm apparatus", a development of earlier work in ballistics and air resistance. He also experimented with rotating wing sections of various forms in the stairwells at Brompton Hall.|$|R
