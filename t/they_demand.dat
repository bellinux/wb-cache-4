5|$|To sum up: The {{lines of}} {{cleavage}} between Pablo's revisionism and orthodox Trotskyism are {{so deep that}} no compromise is possible either politically or organizationally. The Pablo faction has demonstrated {{that it will not}} permit democratic decisions truly reflecting majority opinion to be reached. <b>They</b> <b>demand</b> complete submission to their criminal policy. They are determined to drive all orthodox Trotskyists out of the Fourth International or to muzzle and handcuff them.|$|E
5|$|Humanity survives in the aftermath, but {{the world}} {{experiences}} an ice age outside of Kazamatsuri. In the city, a huge tree grows 500 meters tall in three years, which contains the orb of light from Kotarou and Kagari. The five heroines, now in high school, investigate the tree {{as members of the}} occult research society and transform Kotarou into a familiar, but he refuses to do what <b>they</b> <b>demand.</b> Kotarou takes the girls to the Moon where they are shown circled around a seedling (as the embodiment of the Moon's Kagari) sprouting on the otherwise barren regolith.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{events can}} take place while {{managing}} the tower. For example, terrorists may phone the player {{to let them know}} that they have hidden a bomb in the building, and that <b>they</b> <b>demand</b> a ransom. If the ransom is not paid, then security services must find the bomb before it detonates, or else the tower will incur significant damages. If the player builds facilities underground, the game may notify them that their workers have discovered gold treasure, which gives the player a significant amount of funds. At random intervals during the game, there are notifications that state that a VIP will be visiting the tower soon, so the player must prepare for their visit. If the VIP enjoys their visit because of variables such as a comfortable hotel suite and efficient navigation, the VIP will give the tower a favorable rating. A favorable rating would then allow the tower to advance to the next star level, assuming the other qualifications are met. Although it does not have any impact on the tower, at the end of the fourth quarter every year in the game, Santa Claus and his reindeer fly across the tower.|$|E

25|$|Like {{other points}} of the Spanish {{geography}} and concretely in Andalucia, during the processions, saetas are sung to the sculptures. The saeta is a religious song, generally improvised and without accompaniment, which is usually done from a balcony or on the street. It is a melody of free and full of lyricism. <b>They</b> <b>demand</b> to know the style of cante jondo typical of the musical tradition of flamenco.|$|E
25|$|The primary weapons used by both Division and FMF Recon {{assets are}} {{typically}} the same standard-issued {{weapons in the}} arsenal of the Marine Corps.

Gayle hoped that his first season in Zimbabwe is a season to remember, while Nannes looked forward to bowl in a country where he had never been before. Tait {{selected}} the Mid West Rhinos franchise because it was coached by a fellow Australian and former fast bowler Jason Gillespie. Both Gayle and Nannes were teammates for Royal Challengers Bangalore in the 2011 Indian Premier League (IPL 4) and 2011 Champions League Twenty20.|$|E
25|$|Goal-setting Theory {{has strong}} {{empirical}} support dating back thirty years. However, {{there are some}} boundary conditions that indicate in some situations, goal-setting can be detrimental to performance on certain types of tasks. Goals require a narrowing of one's focus, so for more complex or creative tasks, goals can actually inhibit performance because <b>they</b> <b>demand</b> cognitive resources. Similarly, when someone is learning a new task, performance-related goals can distract from the learning process. During the learning process, it may be better to focus on mastering the task than achieving a particular result. Finally, too many goals can become distracting and counterproductive, especially if they conflict with one another.|$|E
25|$|Indépendentistes {{are fully}} {{nationalist}} in outlook. They view {{the federal government}} as a successor state to the British Empire, and as a de facto colonizing agent of English Canada. Consequently, <b>they</b> <b>demand</b> complete independence for Quebec, which they view in the context of national liberation movements in Africa and the Caribbean of the 1960s. Independence is seen as the culmination of a natural societal progression, from colonization to provincial autonomy to outright independence. Accordingly, they tend to favor assertive declarations of independence over negotiations, idealizing the Patriote movement of the 1830s. Their ideological origins can be found within the Rassemblement pour l'indépendance nationale headed by Pierre Bourgault, a founding organization of the Parti Québécois.|$|E

25|$|Experiments in knapping have {{demonstrated}} the relative ease with which a hand axe can be made, which could help explain their success. In addition, <b>they</b> <b>demand</b> relatively little maintenance and allow a choice of raw materials–any rock will suffice that supports a conchoidal fracture. It is easy to improvise their manufacture and correct mistakes without requiring detailed planning. No long or demanding apprenticeship is necessary to learn the necessary techniques. These factors combine to allow these objects to remain in use throughout pre-history. Their adaptability makes them effective {{in a variety of}} tasks, from heavy duty such as digging in soil, felling trees or breaking bones to delicate such as cutting ligaments, slicing meat or perforating a variety of materials.|$|E
25|$|The detectives {{visit the}} yacht club, where a valet (Grayson Gabriel) shares the guest sign-in log for October 5. Gwen's name is signed in at 8:37 p.m. with {{a license plate}} number that matches the {{campaign}} car in which Rosie's body was found. They question Gwen, who admits she recently lost her keycard but maintains she was at a Tacoma bed and breakfast {{on the night of}} Rosie's murder. Linden asks her about the campaign car, but she warns them to be careful with murder accusations. Later at Holder's apartment, Linden studies the grand opening photo and notices Jackson's former head of security had a broken arm. At the casino, the detectives tell Drays that Jackson framed her former head of security for murder and will eventually do the same to her. <b>They</b> <b>demand</b> to see all withheld casino security footage from the night of Rosie's murder.|$|E

Harry abducts and interrogates Coaver, who denies any knowledge of the attacks. Coaver is surrendered to a group posing as CIA personnel, who drive away with him moments before the actual CIA officers arrive. When the MI5 team realise their mistake, they give chase. Coaver is pushed out of the rear of the speeding van during the pursuit and subsequently dies on the street. The CIA applies pressure on Home Secretary William Towers (Simon Russell Beale), as they believe Harry to be directly responsible for Coaver's death. <b>They</b> <b>demand</b> Harry be handed over to CIA custody for extradition to the United States.

25|$|With {{everyone}} {{now back}} in 2016, Nate reveals the first Dominator invasion {{to have been in}} Oregon, 1951. He takes Mick Rory, Amaya Jiwe, Felicity and Cisco to kidnap a Dominator for information. The Legends successfully capture a Dominator to interrogate, but are themselves captured by federal agents. While in custody, the Legends learn from the Dominator that the aliens arrived to assess the threat humanity posed now that metahumans have appeared due to the Justice Society of America. Felicity and Cisco rescue the Legends and help set the Dominator free. Meanwhile, in Central City 2016, the team learns that the Dominators know about Barry's manipulation of the timeline, deeming him as a threat, and that <b>they</b> <b>demand</b> his surrender in exchange for peace. After the Legends return, the team discovers that the Dominators' weapon is a bomb that will kill all metahumans on Earth, with millions of collateral human casualties. The teams dissuade Barry from surrendering, with Cisco reconciling with him, having realized that continuing the estrangement against Barry was hypocritical of him (having just changed the past-himself). Firestorm manages to transmute the bomb into a liquid and the teams force the Dominators to retreat using a pain-inflicting nano-weapon. Later, as the heroes celebrate their victory, Oliver offers Kara his friendship, and Cisco gives her an interdimensional device that will allow her to travel and communicate between Earth-1 and Earth-38. Martin persuades Jax not to tell the others of his daughter, Lily, whose existence {{is the result of a}} temporal paradox he inadvertently caused when the Legends were in 1987.|$|E

Reaction in the US was generally positive, though Dave Marsh, writing in Creem gave a more critical response. Lenny Kaye, writing in Rolling Stone wrote [...] "the Who as a whole have never sounded better" [...] but added [...] "on its own terms, Quadrophenia falls short of the mark".
