30|$|It is {{accurate}} to say that those lime bosses, who had years of experience in the lime industry, have learned to internalize the historical lessons from the industry and their own practices. <b>Thus</b> <b>it</b> <b>entails</b> a certain historical legitimacy with regard to their seemingly irrational behavior—making credit-based transactions with resellers even when they had little knowledge about them. In fact, their trust in the reseller did not come from the air—it involves a certain practical sense and social legitimacy. For instance, if the reseller offered to pay immediately during the first transaction, the lime bosses might, on the contrary, regard it as a warning signal that he should be more cautious with this transaction. One of the lime bosses, {{who had been in the}} business for almost 30  years, revealed his “reasoning” for this.|$|R
40|$|This {{empirical}} study {{focuses on}} how a business might influence the relational structure {{and way of life}} for an entrepreneurial family, <b>thus</b> <b>it</b> <b>entails</b> sociological scrutiny of a social unit that has received little research attention, despite its impact on our modern economy. Isabell Stamm unveils the conditions of their specific constellation and the resulting challenges, as well as the strategies developed to cope with these challenges. The conceptual part of this monograph addresses the evolving social meanings of this social unit along with its central characteristics and leads into a conceptual model for the reciprocal influence of the business and the family, which theorizes the specific structures and conditions of entrepreneurial families. The empirical investigation describes the influence of the business on the life of entrepreneurial family members at different stages in their lives, identifies dependencies along the way, and focuses on the particularities of the generational setting in entrepreneurial families...|$|R
40|$|The {{analysis}} of spatially correlated binary data observed on lattices {{is an interesting}} topic that catches the attention of many scholars of different scientific fields like epidemiology, medicine, agriculture, biology, geology and geography. To overcome the encountered difficulties upon fitting the autologistic regression model to analyze such data via Bayesian and/or Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques, the Gaussian latent variable model has been enrolled in the methodol-ogy. Assuming a normal distribution for the latent random variable may not be realistic and wrong, normal assumptions might cause bias in parameter estimates and affect the accuracy of results and inferences. <b>Thus,</b> <b>it</b> <b>entails</b> more flexible prior distributions for the latent variable in the spa-tial models. A review of the recent literature in spatial statistics shows {{that there is an}} increasing tendency in presenting models that are involving skew distributions, especially skew-normal ones. In this study, a skew-normal latent variable modeling was developed in Bayesian {{analysis of}} the spatially correlated binary data that were acquired on uncorrelated lattices. The proposed me-thodology was applied in inspecting spatial dependency and related factors of tooth caries occur-rences in a sample of students of Yasuj University of Medical Sciences, Yasuj, Iran.

40|$|This {{research}} examines {{whether an}} extension of range–frequency theory (Parducci, 1965) could successfully predict context effects on discrimination between stimuli for two-category rating data. The new model proposes that similarity comparisons between stimulus values and rating category prototypes take place on an implicit range–frequency scale, and <b>thus</b> <b>it</b> <b>entails</b> effects of context on both mean ratings and discrimination indices. Predictions of the similarity-based range–frequency model were tested in an experiment in which the frequency distribution was manipulated by varying the range and relative frequencies of squares, with participants rating square sizes on a two-category scale. The model provided a parsimonious account of how discriminability of common stimuli increases with a decrease in stimulus range or {{an increase in the}} density of stimuli within a subrange. A well-known feature of category ratings is their dependence on the contextual distribution of stimuli being judged. For example, a target person will receive higher ratings on such dimensions as attractiveness, likeableness, or sociability if the ratings of a recently encountered set of individuals are primarily low on those dimensions (for a review, see Wedell, Hicklin, & Smarandescu, 2007).

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a classification of widely studied approaches that focus interaction analysis {{and composition of}} multiple aspect(s) in aspect-oriented programs (AOP). It is evident that AOP has an ability to distort semantics of base-programs and aspects themselves due to advice-method or advice-advice interactions in terms of control flow and data sharing features. <b>Thus,</b> <b>it</b> <b>entails</b> a comprehensive analysis in order to pinpoint ambiguities at semantic level; especially in case of multiple aspects that remains focus of this paper. One possible interaction (method-advice) may inviolate a predicate of another advice from another aspect, residing in the base-program. We narrow our analysis to understand such intricacies and present a bunch of rules to understand weaving semantics (in particular, advice-advice interaction from two different aspects) and also propose precedence laws for aspects to be woven. In this paper discrete computation of aspects using operational semantics enables better interaction analysis of aspects and specifying their behavior by excluding the dependencies of any specific AOP language implementation. The contributions are threefold: (1) a survey based on an informal classification of proposed approaches targeted towards interfering aspects (2) our proposed formal definitions for composing aspects through evaluation rules using operational semantics (3) addressing precedence issues in aspects to some degree and offering a preliminary solution based on proactive execution order of aspects...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Performance {{management}} {{has been adopted}} both by {{public and private sectors}} as a strategic response to competition and market demand, especially to employees in improving service delivery. Performance contract is a broader sector reform intended to improve efficiency and effectiveness <b>thus</b> reducing costs; <b>it</b> <b>entails</b> a range of tools used to define responsibilities and expectations between parties to achieve agreed results on mutual ground. The introduction of performance contract by City Council of Nairobi experienced many challenges most managers were not willing to sign the contract owing {{to the fact that they}} did not understand what <b>it</b> <b>entailed,</b> this affected effective delivery of service to the public. The primary objective of this study was to establish management’s perception on performance contract and factors influencing performance contract at the City Council of Nairobi the study was a cross-sectional survey design, primary sources were used to collect data, these data was collected using a semi-structured questionnaire. Descriptive statistics and factor analysis was employed in analysis of the data and the findings showed that the managers perception on PC is not really a uni-dimensional construct, rather it has two elements namely; procedural and organizational aspects, their perception is also influenced by engagement, work environment and management commitment...|$|R
40|$|As {{incremental}} Structure from Motion algorithms become effective, a good sparse {{point cloud}} representing {{the map of}} the scene becomes available frame-by-frame. From the 3 D Delaunay triangulation of these points, state-of-the-art algorithms build a manifold rough model of the scene. These algorithms integrate incrementally new points to the 3 D reconstruction only if their position estimate does not change. Indeed, whenever a point moves in a 3 D Delaunay triangulation, for instance because its estimation gets refined, a set of tetrahedra have to be removed and replaced with new ones to maintain the Delaunay property; the management of the manifold reconstruction becomes <b>thus</b> complex and <b>it</b> <b>entails</b> a potentially big overhead. In this paper we investigate different approaches and we propose an efficient policy to deal with moving points in the manifold estimation process. We tested our approach with four sequences of the KITTI dataset and we show the effectiveness of our proposal in comparison with state-of-the-art approaches.

30|$|The SRF approach, {{which is}} {{applicable}} to both poplar and eucalypts, {{is devoted to}} the growth of small trees for biomass production in the short term. This management system provides little opportunity to remove but the whole aboveground biomass (Morhart et al. 2013), and <b>it</b> <b>thus</b> <b>entails</b> the extraction of large amount of nutrients every few years. In the case of the more efficient genotypes of poplar, with an average yield of 5.5 (t∙ha−[*] 1 ∙year−[*] 1), comparison between the removal rates and the available amounts of nutrients in the soil show that 29 % of the available P and 19 % of the expected periodic N mineralization would be retained in the aboveground biomass after 7  years of growing poplar. Even if nutrient concentrations of poplar in this study are high compared to the other species studied, it is known that poplar has lower concentrations when compared to other biomass fuels, as Miscanthus (Jenkins et al. 1998), but also higher than willow (Tharakan et al. 2003).|$|R

30|$|The {{findings}} {{reported in}} this section lead to some important conclusions: First, harmonious passion would appear to positively contribute to psychological well-being and to protect against psychological ill-being. Second, obsessive passion would appear to predict psychological ill-being while being either negatively or unrelated to psychological well-being. Third, it appears that being non passionate leads to a small decrease in psychological well-being. <b>Thus,</b> <b>it</b> appears that the same (intentional) activity {{may or may not}} contribute to one's psychological well-being depending on the quality of one's engagement in the activity. Because <b>it</b> <b>entails</b> an optimal form of activity engagement, harmonious passion predicts positive well-being, while obsessive passion and its less adaptive form of defensive engagement does not. Finally, research reveals that these findings apply to men and women across the life span and on both hedonic and eudaimonic measures of psychological well-being.|$|R
