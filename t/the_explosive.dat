5|$|Production at Site S ceased in late 1945 due to {{the cold}} weather. All work was then done at Salt Wells. The plant was {{completed}} in January 1946, and all equipment was installed and working by May 1946. Work was initially dogged by an unacceptably large number of defects {{in the form of}} cracks or imperfections in <b>the</b> <b>explosive</b> blocks. The core of the problem was that the techniques used at Los Alamos did not scale to a production site, so different methods were required. Special instrumentation was devised by Caltech's Ira Bowen to assess the quality of <b>the</b> <b>explosive</b> blocks.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Mercantile <b>Explosives</b> Department {{was formed}} within the Treasury Department to manage <b>the</b> mercantile <b>explosives</b> {{formerly}} <b>the</b> {{responsibility of the}} Ordnance Storekeeper. This was eventually to evolve, in 1902, into <b>the</b> <b>Explosives</b> Department. In 1922 this Department transferred to the Department of Mines. It managed <b>the</b> <b>explosives</b> hulks in Middle Harbour, and later the Bantry Bay magazines.|$|R

In the concluding remarks the actual status of Italy and the Countries are compared, on the basis of regulation system coverage with special reference to the safety problem...|$|R

5|$|Block II {{had already}} been planned to use a {{completely}} redesigned hatch which opened outward, and could be opened {{in less than five}} seconds.

5|$|Due to {{the lack}} of any form of mass transit besides bus prior to 2008, the Phoenix Metropolitan Area has {{remained}} a very automobile-dependent city, with its first freeway opening in 1958—a year preceding most cities' first freeway openings.

5|$|In June 1944, Bradbury {{received}} {{orders from}} Parsons, {{who was now}} the Deputy Director of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos Laboratory, to report to Albuquerque, New Mexico.

5|$|Instead of the {{seafaring}} assignment {{he hoped}} for, Reynolds {{was sent to}} the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos Laboratory to assist George Kistiakowsky in the design of <b>the</b> <b>explosive</b> lenses required by the implosion-type nuclear weapon.

50|$|During World War II, the bridge, which {{provided}} railroad {{access to the}} northern part of Holland, was rigged with demolition charges by the Germans, who loaded the central pier with 400 boxes, each containing 3 kilograms of explosives. Twice those explosives were removed by Dutch resistance operatives: on the night of 26 September 1944, two members of the local swimming team, Jaap Boll and Remmert Aten, dived down and got into the central pier by way of an underwater opening, and removed <b>the</b> <b>explosives.</b> <b>The</b> Germans discovered that <b>the</b> <b>explosives</b> had been removed when they saw packaging material floating around, so Remmert Aten swam down a second time, after <b>the</b> <b>explosives</b> had been replaced.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>explosive</b> phreatomagmatic eruptions {{caused by}} the easy access of water to the erupting vents threw rocks up to a {{kilometre}} (0.6mi) away from the island, and sent ash clouds as high as 10km (6mi) up into the atmosphere. The loose pile of unconsolidated tephra would quickly have been washed away had the supply of fresh magma dwindled, and large clouds of dust were often seen blowing away from the island during {{this stage of the}} eruption.|$|E
5|$|There is {{debate about}} {{the exact nature of}} phreatomagmatic eruptions, and some {{scientists}} believe that fuel-coolant reactions may be more critical to <b>the</b> <b>explosive</b> nature than thermal contraction. Fuel coolant reactions may fragment the volcanic material by propagating stress waves, widening cracks and increasing surface area that ultimately leads to rapid cooling and explosive contraction-driven eruptions.|$|E
5|$|While George Kistiakowsky's Explosives Division (X Division) {{developed}} <b>the</b> <b>explosive</b> lenses, G Division {{designed the}} rest of the weapon. There were numerous difficulties to overcome, {{not the least of which}} was devising a means of detonating the lenses with the required speed. Robert F. Christy's solid core design was chosen as the most likely design to succeed.|$|E
