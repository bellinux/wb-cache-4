5|$|Tics are sudden, repetitive, nonrhythmic {{movements}} (motor tics) and utterances (phonic tics) {{that involve}} discrete muscle groups. Motor tics are movement-based tics, while phonic tics are involuntary sounds produced by moving air <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>nose,</b> mouth, or throat.|$|E
5|$|The {{most widely}} used route is orotracheal, in which an endotracheal tube is passed through the mouth and vocal {{apparatus}} into the trachea. In a nasotracheal procedure, an endotracheal tube is passed <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>nose</b> and vocal apparatus into the trachea. Other methods of intubation involve surgery and include the cricothyrotomy (used almost exclusively in emergency circumstances) and the tracheotomy, used primarily in situations where a prolonged need for airway support is anticipated.|$|E
5|$|By the New Kingdom, {{the ancient}} Egyptians had perfected {{the art of}} mummification; the best {{technique}} took 70 days and involved removing the internal organs, removing the brain <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>nose,</b> and desiccating the body {{in a mixture of}} salts called natron. The body was then wrapped in linen with protective amulets inserted between layers and placed in a decorated anthropoid coffin. Mummies of the Late Period were also placed in painted cartonnage mummy cases. Actual preservation practices declined during the Ptolemaic and Roman eras, while greater emphasis was placed on the outer appearance of the mummy, which was decorated.|$|E

5|$|Dysphagia and dysarthria: {{dysphagia}} is {{a difficulty}} with eating and swallowing which may cause choking and aspiration of food or liquid into the lungs, while dysarthria is a neurological motor speech disorder characterized by poor {{control over the}} subsystems and muscles responsible for speech ("articulation"). A {{speech and language therapist}} may give advice on specific swallowing techniques, on adapting food consistencies and dietary intake, on techniques to improve and maintain speech production and clarity, and on alternative communication approaches. In the case of advanced dysphagia, food can be supplied by a nasogastric tube, which is a tube that goes <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>nose</b> directly to the stomach; or a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), which is a procedure for placing a tube into the stomach and therefore administering food directly to it. This second system, although more invasive, has better results in the long term than nasogastric intake.|$|E
5|$|In 1909 {{the hunger}} strike {{was added to}} the WSPU's {{repertoire}} of resistance. On 24 June Marion Wallace Dunlop was arrested for writing an excerpt from the Bill of Rights (1688 or 1689) on a wall in the House of Commons. Angered by the conditions of the jail, Dunlop went on a hunger strike. When it proved effective, fourteen women imprisoned for smashing windows began to fast. WSPU members soon became known around the country for holding prolonged hunger strikes to protest their incarceration. Prison authorities frequently force-fed the women, using tubes inserted <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>nose</b> or mouth. The painful techniques (which, in the case of mouth-feeding, required the use of steel gags to force the mouth open) brought condemnation from suffragists and medical professionals.|$|E
5|$|Pituitary tumors require {{treatment}} {{when they}} are causing specific symptoms, such as headaches, visual field defects or excessive hormone secretion. Transsphenoidal surgery (removal of the tumor by an operation <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>nose</b> and the sphenoidal sinuses) may, apart from addressing symptoms related to the tumor, also improve pituitary function, although the gland is sometimes damaged further {{as a result of}} the surgery. When the tumor is removed by craniotomy (opening the skull), recovery is less likelyâ€“but sometimes this is the only suitable way to approach the tumor. After surgery, it may take some time for hormone levels to change significantly. Retesting the pituitary hormone levels is therefore performed 2 to 3 months later.|$|E

50|$|In human speech, egressive {{sounds are}} sounds {{by which the}} air stream is created by pushing air out <b>through</b> <b>the</b> mouth or <b>nose.</b> <b>The</b> three types of egressive sounds are pulmonic egressive (from the lungs), glottalic egressive (from the glottis), and lingual (velaric) egressive (from the tongue). The {{opposite}} of an egressive sound is an ingressive sound, by which the airstream flows inward <b>through</b> <b>the</b> mouth or <b>nose.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{decision}} on whether to surgically decompress the pituitary gland is complex and mainly dependent on the severity of visual loss and visual field defects. If visual acuity is severely reduced, there are large or worsening visual field defects, or the level of consciousness falls consistently, professional guidelines recommend that surgery is performed. Most commonly, operations on the pituitary gland are performed through transsphenoidal surgery. In this procedure, surgical instruments are passed <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>nose</b> towards the sphenoid bone, which is opened to give access to the cavity that contains the pituitary gland. Surgery is most likely to improve vision if there was some remaining vision before surgery, and if surgery is undertaken within a week of the onset of symptoms.|$|E
5|$|The {{nostrils}} in most bony fish {{differ from}} those of tetrapods. Normally, bony fish have four nares (nasal openings), one naris behind the other on each side. As the fish swims, water flows into the forward pair, across the olfactory tissue, and out through the posterior openings. This is true not only of ray-finned fish but also of the coelacanth, a fish included in the Sarcopterygii, the group that also includes the tetrapods. In contrast, the tetrapods have only one pair of nares externally but also sport a pair of internal nares, called choanae, allowing them to draw air <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>nose.</b> Lungfish are also sarcopterygians with internal nostrils, but these are sufficiently different from tetrapod choanae that they have long been recognized as an independent development.|$|E
5|$|Two Gemini-derived {{spacecraft}} {{were considered}} for unmanned resupply flights. The {{first of these}} would have involved a Gemini spacecraft, with all systems for manned flight, re-entry and landing removed. The spacecraft would have docked using a port {{at the front of}} the spacecraft. Cargo would have been transferred <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>nose</b> of the spacecraft, where the re-entry attitude control system was located on the manned spacecraft. The spacecraft was equipped with a liquid propellant engine to perform rendezvous, and to reboost the space station. The other proposal was for a new spacecraft to be built for unmanned missions, but re-using as many Gemini systems as possible. It would have had a higher cargo capacity than the stripped-down version of the Gemini spacecraft.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The careful {{recording}} of fold and fabric geometries permits evaluation of shear zone kine-matics. Directions of shearing may be calculated via the Axial-planar Intersection Method (AIM) which incorporates analysis of minor fold vergence with axial-planar rotations. The geometry of sheath fold pairs {{may also be}} used to determine shear sense with sheaths closing in the transport direction typical-ly displaying greater hinge-line curvature. Cross sections <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>noses</b> of sheath folds display cats-eye folds where the ellipticity of closures increases towards the centre of the eye, and bulls-eye folds where closures become less elliptical towards the centre, and reflect variations in bulk strain type from simple shear to constriction respectively...|$|R

50|$|Breathing in {{backstroke}} {{is easier}} than in other strokes, as <b>the</b> mouth and <b>nose</b> are usually above water. Competitive swimmers breathe in <b>through</b> <b>the</b> mouth during the recovery of one arm, and breathe out <b>through</b> <b>the</b> mouth and <b>nose</b> during <b>the</b> pull and push phase of the same arm. This is done to clear <b>the</b> <b>nose</b> of water.|$|R
5|$|As in {{all other}} tetrapods, mammals have a larynx that can quickly open and close to produce sounds, and a supralaryngeal vocal tract which filters this sound. The lungs and {{surrounding}} musculature provide the air stream and pressure required to phonate. The larynx controls the pitch and volume of sound, but the strength the lungs exert to exhale also contributes to volume. More primitive mammals, such as the echidna, can only hiss, as sound is achieved solely through exhaling through a partially closed larynx. Other mammals phonate using vocal folds, {{as opposed to the}} vocal cords seen in birds and reptiles. The movement or tenseness of the vocal folds can result in many sounds such as purring and screaming. Mammals can change the position of the larynx, allowing them to breathe <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>nose</b> while swallowing through the mouth, and to form both oral and nasal sounds; nasal sounds, such as a dog whine, are generally soft sounds, and oral sounds, such as a dog bark, are generally loud.|$|E
5|$|Pneumonia, another {{potential}} complication, develops {{in as many}} as 20% of people with pulmonary contusion. Contused lungs are less able to remove bacteria than uninjured lungs, predisposing them to infection. Intubation and mechanical ventilation further increase the risk of developing pneumonia; the tube is passed <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>nose</b> or mouth into the airways, potentially tracking bacteria from the mouth or sinuses into them. Also, intubation prevents coughing, which would clear bacteria-laden secretions from the airways, and secretions pool near the tube's cuff and allow bacteria to grow. The sooner the endotracheal tube is removed, the lower the risk of pneumonia, but if it is removed too early and has to be put back in, the risk of pneumonia rises. People who are at risk for pulmonary aspiration (e.g. those with lowered level of consciousness due to head injuries) are especially likely to get pneumonia. As with ARDS, the chances of developing pneumonia increase with the size of the contusion. Children and adults have been found to have similar rates of complication with pneumonia and ARDS.|$|E
5|$|The Horsa and Hamilcar gliders of {{the brigade}} landed at 21:00 on 6 June in a landing zone cleared of {{obstructions}} by the 5th Parachute Brigade. The primary tasks of the brigade were {{to bring in}} reinforcements and supplies, and to aid the two parachute brigades in consolidating the area held by the division; the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Squadron was {{to aid in the}} latter task, acting as a reconnaissance force to scout out German positions and impede the movement of German forces attempting to counter-attack. The Tetrarchs of 'A' Squadron were to play an integral part in this reconnaissance role due to their speed, but the squadron's strength of twenty tanks was severely depleted by the time it landed in Normandy. It lost one tank before the formation landed when the Tetrarch broke loose of its shackles and crashed <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>nose</b> of the glider that was carrying it, causing both to fall into the sea mid-flight. The squadron's strength was further weakened when two gliders collided with each other in the landing zone, destroying themselves and the Tetrarchs they carried; a third Hamilcar hit another Tetrarch as it was being unloaded and flipped the tank upside down, rendering it unusable, although the crew escaped without injury. The surviving tanks were then rendered temporarily immobile when parachute rigging lines became tangled in their suspensions, forcing their crews to cut the lines away with welding torches.|$|E

30|$|The {{right side}} of Fig.Â  3 shows several microridge rings on the {{sidewall}} surrounding <b>the</b> punch <b>nose.</b> These features increase the pulling force on the blank {{as well as the}} friction between the blank and punch by distributing the drawing force on the blank from the nasal fillet of the punch to the microridges. Consequently, the drawing force on the blank is no longer concentrated at <b>the</b> punch <b>nose</b> but is distributed <b>through</b> <b>the</b> punch <b>nose</b> and microridges. This slows sidewall thinning, preventing the occurrence of cracks.|$|R
