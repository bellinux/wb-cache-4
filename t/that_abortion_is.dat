5|$|Some anti-abortion {{activists have}} {{continued}} to advance a discredited causal link between abortion and breast cancer. In the United States, they have advanced state legislation that in several states requires health care providers to present abortion {{as a cause of}} breast cancer when counseling women who are seeking abortion. This political intervention culminated when the George W. Bush administration altered the National Cancer Institute website to suggest that abortion might cause breast cancer. In response to public concern over this intervention, the NCI convened a 2003 workshop bringing together over 100 experts on the issue. This workshop concluded that while some studies reported a statistical correlation between breast cancer and abortion, the strongest scientific evidence from large prospective cohort studies demonstrates <b>that</b> <b>abortion</b> <b>is</b> not associated with an increase in breast cancer risk, and that the positive findings were likely due to response bias.|$|E

In that year, he wrote: [...] "I believe <b>that</b> <b>abortion</b> <b>is</b> the wrong choice except in cases of incest, rape, and {{to save the life}} of the mother." [...] During his 1994 campaign for the senate, Romney had said, [...] "I believe that abortion should be safe and legal in this country," [...] a stance he reiterated during his 2002 campaign for governor. While Romney would prefer to see passage of a constitutional amendment that would outlaw abortion, he did not believe the public would support such an amendment; as an alternative, he promised to nominate Supreme Court justices who would help overturn Roe v. Wade, allowing each state to decide on the legality of abortion.|$|E

In China abortion is also widely practiced, but in Tibet it is very rare. Thus while most Buddhists would agree <b>that</b> <b>abortion</b> <b>is</b> wrong, they are less likely to push for laws banning the practice.

2500|$|FFL uses [...] "pro-women" [...] {{arguments}} {{in order to}} convince women <b>that</b> <b>abortion</b> <b>is</b> [...] "immoral". Goltz argued that the legalization of abortion allowed sexually exploitative men to avoid responsibilities, like paying for child support, and run away from their actions. FFL argues that abortion comes from gender inequality. In response to Roe v. Wade, Callaghan made several claims, including that abortion causes bodily injury to women [...] "in a third to a half of the cases", and that the Supreme Court legalized abortion because they [...] "hate poor and unwed mothers". This claim is called [...] "unsubstantiated" [...] by professor Kelsy Kretschmer. However, Kretschmer does explain {{that the goal of}} these arguments were to make it hard for men and women to consider abortion a [...] "feminist" [...] victory.|$|E
2500|$|The {{argument}} of deprivation states <b>that</b> <b>abortion</b> <b>is</b> morally wrong because it deprives the fetus of a valuable future. [...] On this account, killing an adult {{human being is}} wrong because it deprives {{the victim of a}} future like ours—a future containing highly valuable or desirable experiences, activities, projects, and enjoyments. If a being has such a future, then (according to the argument) killing that being would seriously harm it and hence would be seriously wrong. But since a fetus does have such a future, the [...] "overwhelming majority" [...] of deliberate abortions are placed in the [...] "same moral category" [...] as killing an innocent adult human being. [...] Not all abortions are unjustified according to this argument: abortion would be justified if the same justification could be applied to killing an adult human.|$|E

2500|$|Much of what {{is known}} about the methods and {{practice}} of abortion in Greek and Roman history comes from early classical texts. Abortion, as a gynecological procedure, was primarily the province of women who were either midwives or well-informed laypeople. In his Theaetetus, Plato mentions a midwife's ability to induce abortion {{in the early stages of}} pregnancy. It <b>is</b> thought unlikely <b>that</b> <b>abortion</b> <b>was</b> punished in Ancient Greece.

2500|$|One of {{the reasons}} this {{is seen as an}} evil act is because a human rebirth is seen as a {{precious}} and unique opportunity to do good deeds and attain liberation. The Jataka stories contain tales of women who perform abortions being reborn in a hell. In the case where the mother's life is in jeopardy, many traditional Buddhists agree <b>that</b> <b>abortion</b> <b>is</b> permissible. This is the only legally permissible reason for abortion in Sri Lanka and is also a view accepted in the Tibetan tradition as argued by Ganden Tri Rinpoche. In the case of rape, however, most Buddhists argue that following an act of violence by allowing 'another kind of violence towards another individual' would not be ethical. Aborting a fetus that is malformed is also seen as immoral by most Buddhists.|$|E
2500|$|Philosophers such as Aquinas use {{the concept}} of individuation. They argue <b>that</b> <b>abortion</b> <b>is</b> not {{permissible}} from {{the point at which}} individual human identity is realized. Anthony Kenny argues that this can be derived from everyday beliefs and language and one can legitimately say [...] "if my mother had had an abortion six months into her pregnancy, she would have killed me" [...] then one can reasonably infer that at six months the [...] "me" [...] in question would have been an existing person with a valid claim to life. Since division of the zygote into twins through the process of monozygotic twinning can occur until the fourteenth day of pregnancy, Kenny argues that individual identity is obtained at this point and thus abortion is not permissible after two weeks.|$|E

[...] The LCMS believes that whether abortion is legal or not, it {{does not change the}} fact <b>that</b> <b>abortion</b> <b>is</b> as sin. On the topic of whether abortion is allowed in the case of rape or incest, the LCMS has stated that though there are many [...] "emotional arguments for abortion... {{the fact of the matter}} is that it is wrong to take the life of one innocent victim (the unborn child)...It is indeed a strange logic that would have us kill an innocent unborn baby for the crime of his father." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{consequence}} of this argument is <b>that</b> <b>abortion</b> <b>is</b> wrong in all the cases where killing a child or adult with {{the same sort of}} future as the embryo would be wrong. [...] So for example, if involuntary euthanasia of patients with a future filled with intense physical pain is morally acceptable, aborting embryos whose future is filled with intense physical pain will also be morally acceptable. [...] But it would not do, for example, to invoke the fact that some embryo's future would involve such things as being raised by an unloving family, since we do not take it to be acceptable to kill a five-year-old just because her future involves being raised by an unloving family. [...] Similarly, killing a child or adult may be permissible in exceptional circumstances such as self-defense or (perhaps) capital punishment; but these are irrelevant to standard abortions.|$|E
2500|$|The {{philosophical}} {{arguments in}} the abortion debate are deontological or rights-based. [...] The view that all or almost all abortion should be illegal generally rests on the claims: (1) that the existence and moral right to life of human beings (human organisms) begins at or near conception-fertilization; (2) that induced abortion is the deliberate and unjust killing of the embryo in violation of its right to life; and (3) that the law should prohibit unjust violations {{of the right to}} life. [...] The view that abortion should in most or all circumstances be legal generally rests on the claims: (1) that women have a right to control what happens in and to their own bodies; (2) <b>that</b> <b>abortion</b> <b>is</b> a just exercise of this right; and (3) that the law should not criminalize just exercises of the right to control one's own body and its life-support functions.|$|E
2500|$|A seminal {{essay by}} Don Marquis argues <b>that</b> <b>abortion</b> <b>is</b> wrong because it deprives the embryo of a {{valuable}} future. Marquis begins {{by arguing that}} what makes it wrong to kill a normal adult human being {{is the fact that}} the killing inflicts a terrible harm on the victim. [...] The harm consists in the fact that [...] "when I die, I am deprived of all of the value of my future": I am deprived of all the valuable [...] "experiences, activities, projects, and enjoyments" [...] that I would otherwise have had. Thus, if a being has a highly valuable future ahead of it—a [...] "future like ours"—then killing that being would be seriously harmful and hence seriously wrong. But then, as a standard embryo does have a highly valuable future, killing it is seriously wrong. And so [...] "the overwhelming majority of deliberate abortions are seriously immoral", [...] "in the same moral category as killing an innocent adult human being".|$|E

2500|$|Although Jackson {{was one of}} {{the most}} liberal members of the Democratic Party, his {{position}} on abortion was originally more in line with pro-life views. Within one month after the 1973 Supreme Court decision, Roe v. Wade, legalized abortion, Jackson began a PUSH campaign against the decision, calling abortion murder and declaring that Jesus and Moses might not have been born if abortion had been available in ancient times. Jackson's strong rhetoric on abortion temporarily alienated one of his major supporters, T. R. M Howard, a black physician who made a living from performing abortions. In 1975, Jackson endorsed a plan for a constitutional amendment banning abortion. He also endorsed the Hyde Amendment, which bars the funding of abortions through the federal Medicaid program. Writing in a [...] 1977 National Right to Life Committee News report, Jackson argued that the basis for Roe v. Wade – the right to privacy – was also a premise that had been used to justify slavery and the treatment of slaves on the plantations. Jackson decried what he believed was the casual taking of life, and the decline in society's value system. However, Jackson later adopted a pro-choice view <b>that</b> <b>abortion</b> <b>is</b> a right and that the government should not prevent a woman from having an abortion.|$|E
