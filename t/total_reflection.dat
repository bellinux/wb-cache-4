40|$|A {{requirement}} for rendering realistic images interactively is efficiently simulating material properties. Recent techniques have improved the quality for interactively rendering dielectric materials, but have mostly neglected a phenomenon associated with refraction, namely, <b>total</b> internal <b>reflection.</b> We present an algorithm to approximate <b>total</b> internal <b>reflection</b> on commodity graphics hardware using a ray-depth map intersection technique that is interactive and requires no precomputation. Our results compare favorably with ray traced images and improve upon approaches that avoid <b>total</b> internal <b>reflection...</b>|$|R
50|$|For X-rays, however, all {{materials}} have indices of refraction slightly below 1. This entails that <b>total</b> <b>reflection</b> of X-rays only can occur {{when they travel}} through vacuum and impinge on a surface (at a small glancing angle). Since this kind of <b>total</b> <b>reflection</b> takes place outside of the material it is termed total external reflection. This {{makes it possible to}} focus X-rays (see, for example, NASA https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/toolbox/xray_telescopes1.html).|$|E

40|$|In {{undergraduate}} optics laboratory, {{one thing}} that is not easily achieved is quantitative measurement of optical phase. The reason is that optical phase measurement usually requires expensive interferometers. We demonstrate measurement of relative optical phase shift upon <b>total</b> internal <b>reflection.</b> <b>Total</b> internal <b>reflection,</b> though known by every student of optics, is remembered by 100 % reflection at an interface when angle of incidence is greater than the critical angle, that is, it seems all the same beyond the critical angle. This is not entirely true if one considers the optical phase, which keeps changing upon <b>total</b> internal <b>reflection</b> as the angle of incidence is varied. Furthermore, for linear polarization states perpendicular to or in the plane of incidence (s-and p- polarization), optical phase changes differently upon <b>total</b> internal <b>reflection.</b> Therefore, a linearly polarized beam composed of both s- and p- polarization undergoing <b>total</b> internal <b>reflection</b> becomes elliptically polarized. We show how to determine relative optical phase change between s- and p- polarization states through analysis of the outgoing elliptically polarized beam. Such optical phase change can also be theoretically calculated using Fresnel equations. 1...|$|R

50|$|Waves {{propagate}} in {{all directions}} in open space as spherical waves.
