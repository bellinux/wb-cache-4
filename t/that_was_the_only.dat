5|$|On 31 May, Ajax, {{under the}} command of Captain George Baird, was the second ship from the head of the battle line after deployment. She fired one salvo of six common pointed, capped shells at the battlecruisers of the I Scouting Group shortly after 19:00, but had to cease fire {{immediately}} afterwards when her view was obstructed by the ships of the 4th Light Cruiser Squadron. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> time that the ship fired her weapons during the battle.|$|E
5|$|The Dodgers scored {{their only}} {{run in the}} bottom of the fourth as Dusty Baker singled, {{advanced}} to second on an error, and scored on another single. They threatened again in the sixth inning, loading the bases, though they failed to score. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> inning after the fourth in which a Dodgers' runner reached scoring position. Niekro steadied again after the sixth, allowing just one baserunner on a two-out ninth-inning single over the remaining three innings.|$|E
5|$|The Polikarpov VIT-1 (— Flying Tank Destroyer) was a Soviet twin-engined {{multi-purpose}} aircraft developed before World War II.

5|$|Following Jordan's departure, the Houston Rockets, led by Hakeem Olajuwon, won the 1994 and 1995 NBA titles. During this period, Olajuwon {{became the}} only player in history to win the NBA MVP, NBA Defensive Player of the Year and Finals MVP awards in the same season. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> year that both the NBA and NHL finals went to seven games while {{involving}} teams from the same city, with the Rockets facing the New York Knicks in 1994. With their win in Game 7, the Rockets denied New York from winning both the NBA and NHL titles in the same year, as the New York Rangers won the 1994 Stanley Cup Finals. After trading for Drexler midseason, the Rockets later swept an Orlando Magic team consisting of Shaquille O'Neal and Penny Hardaway in the 1995 Finals; Olajuwon was again named Finals MVP, and the Rockets became the fifth franchise to win back-to-back titles {{and became the first}} 6th-seeded team to win the title without enjoying home court advantage on any of their playoff series.|$|E
5|$|For {{their second}} {{game of the}} season, the All-Americans played against another local team, the Buffalo All-Buffalo. Once again, the All-Americans shut out their opponents, winning 51–0. In the first quarter, Weldon scored a rushing touchdown. In the second quarter, the All-Americans scored three times: Running back Ockie Anderson {{returned}} a punt for a touchdown, Hughitt ran for a rushing touchdown, and Weldon caught a receiving touchdown from Hughitt. To start the second half, Anderson scored another rushing touchdown, and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> score of the third quarter. In the final quarter, Anderson kicked a 35-yard field goal. Also, defensive end Murray Shelton recovered a fumble and returned it for a touchdown. Hughitt's rushing touchdown was the final score of the game.|$|E
5|$|During the Catalonia Offensive in January 1939, the Junkers Ju 87 {{returned}} to Spain. On {{the morning of}} 21 January 1939, 34 Heinkel He 111, along with some escorts and three Ju 87B, attacked the Port of Barcelona, five days before the city was captured by the Fascists. 29 Republican fighters were defending the city. There were more than 100 aircraft operating over the city and, while a Ju 87 was dive-bombing a ship, a Republican Polikarpov I-15 pilot, Francisco Alférez Jiménez, claimed it destroyed near el Vendrell, in Coma-ruga, but the Stuka was capable of landing on the beach without crashing. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> time a Stuka attacked the capital of Catalonia. On 24 January 1939, a group of Stukas prevented {{the destruction of a}} bridge near Barcelona by strafing the demolition engineers on Molins de Rei. During the attack the Republican ground defenders, equipped with a quadruple PM M1910 mounting, hit one pilot (Heinz Bohne) in both legs and the Stuka crashed, seriously injuring Bohne, and his machine gunner, Albert Conrad. Those two were the only Stuka casualties of the war.|$|E

5|$|During the battle, König {{suffered}} significant damage. A heavy shell {{penetrated the}} main armored deck toward the bow. Another shell hit the armored bulkhead {{at the corner}} and shoved it back five feet, breaking off a large piece from the armor plate in the process. Shell splinters from another hit penetrated several of the casemates that held the 15cm secondary guns, two of which were disabled. The ammunition stores for these two guns were set on fire and the magazines had to be flooded to prevent an explosion. The ship nevertheless remained combat effective, as her primary battery remained in operation, as did most of her secondary guns; König could also steam at close to her maximum speed. Other areas of the ship had to be counter-flooded to maintain stability; 1,600tons of water entered the ship, either {{as a result of}} battle damage or counter-flooding efforts. The flooding rendered the battleship sufficiently low in the water to prevent the ship from being able to cross the Amrum Bank until 09:30 on 1 June. König was taken to Kiel for initial repairs, as <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> location that had a floating dry dock large enough to fit the ship. Repairs were conducted there from 4 to 18 June, at which point the ship was transferred to the Howaldtswerke shipyard. König was again ready to join the fleet by 21 July. In the course of the battle, she suffered 45 men killed and 27 wounded, the highest tally for any surviving battleship in the German fleet.|$|E

25|$|In fact, no {{decision}} on an approach (much less multiple approaches) had been made. Federal officials said on September 7, 1931, {{that there were}} no Arlington County approaches, and as far as they could ascertain none would be open in 1932, either. A road from the bridge south down Columbia Island and a bridge over the Boundary Channel to connect with the Mount Vernon Memorial Parkway would open in late 1931 or early 1932, they said. But <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> work foreseen.|$|E
25|$|A {{tombstone}} {{in their}} honour was erected in 1741 {{by order of}} Elizabeth of Russia over their burial place beside St. Sampson Cathedral. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> thing that was visible over their grave until 1885 when a monument was placed as they were seen as national heroes because they opposed German ideas, as represented by Biron.

25|$|Finland was {{pressured}} {{to give the}} Germans its Jews (who numbered around 200) in 1942, but given the opposition among the people and government, this did not happen.

25|$|The resurrected Browns were {{expected}} to struggle at first, as for all practical purposes, they were an expansion team. However, the Browns' first two seasons were awful even by expansion standards.

However, <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> highlight for the Browns that night. The Steelers beat the Browns 43–0 in their first game back. It was the team's worst shutout loss ever, topped later only by a 48–0 loss to Jacksonville on December 3, 2000.|$|E
