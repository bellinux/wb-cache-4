5|$|De la Rúa's {{government}} would face {{an economic crisis}} and the 2001 riots, resigning two years later. De la Rúa thought that Duhalde had organized a coup d'état against him Rodolfo Terragno, De la Rúa's Chief of the Cabinet of Ministers, thought instead that the crisis was the exclusive result of keeping the peso-dollar parity despite the costs generated by it. Duhalde and other Peronists interviewed by Ceferino Reato for the book Doce noches said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>party</b> {{had no interest in}} removing De la Rúa from power, because he was so unpopular <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>party</b> would win the 2003 presidential elections without a problem.|$|E

5|$|In addition, it {{was often}} claimed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Party</b> did not allow any member to resign, so {{a person who had}} been a member for a short time decades {{previously}} could be considered as suspect as a current member. Many of the hearings and trials of McCarthyism featured testimony by former Communist Party members such as Elizabeth Bentley, Louis Budenz, and Whittaker Chambers, speaking as expert witnesses.|$|E
5|$|Note {{that the}} {{election}} results in elections other than those for the Flemish Parliament (and the Dutch-speaking electoral college in the European Parliament) gives a somewhat wrong image of the party's support, given <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>party</b> only ran in Flanders, the one half of Belgium.|$|E

The reunited party arrived at Nome on 13 September, to a great welcome from the local population.|$|E
5|$|All {{significant}} Flemish {{political parties}} {{were reluctant to}} enter coalitions with the Vlaams Blok. Following a 1989 agreement, known as the cordon sanitaire, the party was effectively blocked from entering any level of government. The Court of Appeal in Ghent in April 2004 ruled {{that some of the}} party's organizations had breached the 1981 anti-racism law and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>party</b> sanctioned discrimination. The ruling was made definite on 9 November 2004, and the party shortly after reorganised itself as the Vlaams Belang. By 2004, the party had arguably become the single most popular Flemish party in Belgium, supported by about one in four of the Flemish electorate, as well as being {{one of the most successful}} radical right-wing populist parties in Europe as a whole.|$|E
5|$|Gerard Libaridyan, an {{historian}} and close adviser of Ter-Petrosyan, collected and presented {{the evidence against}} the defendants. He later stated {{in an interview that}} he was unsure if the evidence was true, inviting the notion <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>party</b> was banned because of its increasing chances of winning seats in the July 1995 parliamentary elections. Several months after the elections, most of the men were found not guilty with the exception of several defendants charged for engaging in corrupt business practices. The ban on the party was lifted, however, less than a week after Ter-Petrosyan fell from power in February 1998 and was replaced by Robert Kocharyan, who was backed by the Dashnaks.|$|E

5|$|Gough Whitlam saw <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>party</b> {{had little}} chance of being elected unless it could expand its appeal from the {{traditional}} working-class base to include the suburban middle class. He sought to shift control of the ALP from union officials to the parliamentary party, and hoped that even rank-and-file party members could be given {{a voice in the}} conference. In 1968, controversy erupted within the party when the executive refused to seat new Tasmanian delegate Brian Harradine, a Whitlam supporter who was considered a right-wing extremist. Whitlam resigned the leadership, demanding a vote of confidence from caucus. He defeated Cairns for the leadership in an unexpectedly close 38–32 vote. Despite the vote, the executive refused to seat Harradine.|$|E
5|$|In 1903, Willson {{sought the}} Republican gubernatorial nomination. He had {{the backing of}} William O. Bradley, who in 1895 had become the first Republican {{governor}} in the state's history. Others at the convention favored Louisville businessman Morris B. Belknap. After a ruling against a contested delegation to the convention, Willson withdrew his candidacy. Bradley, angered <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>party</b> had not united behind his candidate, boycotted the convention. Belknap was handily defeated by Democrat J. C. W. Beckham in the general election.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, the Supreme Court of India {{reinstated}} {{the controversial}} Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, which, among other things, criminalises homosexuality. There {{was a popular}} outcry, although clerics, including Muslim religious leaders, stated that they supported the verdict. BJP president Rajnath Singh said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>party</b> supported section 377, because it believed that homosexuality was unnatural, though its stand has softened after its victory in the 2014 general elections.Senior party members including Arun Jaitley and Harsh Vardhan (Delhi politician) openly support the rights of gender and sexual minorities in India.

5|$|In June 2001, the Brussels Correctional Court {{declared}} itself incompetent to {{hear the}} case, as it related to political misconduct. In February 2003, the Brussels Appellate Court followed and gave a similar judgement. The original plaintiffs then appealed, and the case {{was sent to the}} Court of Appeals in Ghent, which upheld the complaint; the Vlaams Blok non-profit organisations were fined, and it was deemed that the Vlaams Blok was an organisation that sanctioned discrimination. The Vlaams Blok lodged an appeal which was rejected, and in November 2004, the ruling was made definite, when it was upheld by the Court of Cassation. The ruling meant <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>party</b> would lose access to state funding and access to television, effectively shutting the party down.|$|E
5|$|New Labour {{also used}} the party's brand to {{continue}} this modernisation, and {{it was used to}} communicate the modernisation of the party to the public; the party also began to use focus groups to test whether their policy ideas were attractive to swing voters. Its purpose was to reassure the public <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>party</b> would provide a new kind of governance and mitigate fears that a Labour government would return to the labour unrest that had characterised its past.|$|E
5|$|On 16 September it was {{revealed}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>party</b> would seek to have Martin McGuinness, deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland, nominated to contest the election. With 14 TDs and three Senators, Sinn Féin were three short of the required twenty Oireachtas members to nominate {{a candidate for the}} presidency. Soon after the nomination was announced, four Independent TDs agreed to nominate McGuinness, securing his nomination: Michael Healy-Rae and Tom Fleming (both representing Kerry South), Luke 'Ming' Flanagan (Roscommon–South Leitrim) and Finian McGrath (Dublin North-Central). Both 'Ming' Flanagan and McGrath had previously pledged their support to Norris.|$|E

5|$|On 3 March 2010, {{elections}} for the local councils were held in the municipalities of The Netherlands. The PVV only contested these local elections in the Dutch towns The Hague and Almere, because of a shortage of good candidates. The big gains that were scored indicated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>party</b> and Wilders might dominate the political scene {{in the run-up to}} the parliamentary elections scheduled on 9 June 2010. The PVV won in Almere and came second to the Dutch Labour party in The Hague. In Almere, the PVV won 21 percent of the vote to Labour's 18 percent, preliminary results showed. In The Hague, the PVV had 8 seats—second to Labour with 10 seats.|$|E
5|$|Polling {{conducted}} throughout March 2009 by Maurice de Hond {{indicated the}} Party for Freedom {{was the most}} popular parliamentary party. The polls predicted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>party</b> would take 21% of the national vote, winning 32 out of 150 seats in the Dutch parliament. If the polling results were replicated in an election, Wilders would be a major power broker. Under such circumstances, there would also be some likelihood of him becoming Prime Minister of the Netherlands. This has been partially attributed to timely prosecution attempts against him for hate speech and the travel ban imposed on him by the United Kingdom, as well as dissatisfaction with the Dutch government's response to the global financial crisis of 2008–2009.|$|E
5|$|The LPF formed {{part of a}} {{coalition}} government with the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) and the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD), but internal conflicts in the LPF led to the coalition's break-up and fresh elections after a few months.
