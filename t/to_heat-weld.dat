40|$|EP 1897677 A 2 UPAB: 20080421 NOVELTY - Claimed is an {{assembly}} <b>to</b> <b>heat-weld</b> two thermoplastic components (1 a, 1 b). The welding assembly {{consists of a}} magnetron (20) with a generator (21) and operating in the frequency range 0. 3 and 300 GHz with a wave guide (5) between the magnetron and welding zone. The wave guide is coupled to a press (3) by means of which the two plastic components are brought into intimate contact during the welding process. USE - Microwave welding assembly to joins two plastic components. ADVANTAGE - The microwave welding press facilitates the forming of thermoplastic components that cannot be manufactured by injection moulding processes without leaving an optical blemish. Further claimed is that the welding assembly is efficient, has short process cycle times, and produces consistent weld seams of high strength...|$|E
