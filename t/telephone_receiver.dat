500|$|Morgan {{was also}} called upon on {{occasion}} {{to deal with}} Montgomery, with whom his professional relationship as {{deputy chief of staff}} was similar to that before the war when Montgomery was a brigade commander. On one occasion Morgan was summoned to Smith's office to find him white with rage at a <b>telephone</b> <b>receiver.</b> [...] "That's your bloody marshal {{on the other end of}} that," [...] Smith explained. [...] "I can't talk to him any more. Now you go on." [...] "As the campaign progressed," [...] Morgan later wrote, [...] "it became more difficult for us British at SHAEF to provide explanation, as we were continually called upon to do, for the attitude and behaviour of the British authorities as exemplified by their chosen representative in the field." [...] Senior British officers at SHAEF, notably Morgan, Kenneth Strong and Jock Whiteley remained loyal to Eisenhower. This cast a pall over their careers after the war, when Montgomery became Chief of the Imperial General Staff.|$|E

2500|$|After making {{unsuccessful}} {{inquiries about}} employment with Nikola Tesla and Marconi, de Forest struck {{out on his}} own. His first job after leaving Yale was with the Western Electric Company's telephone lab in Chicago, Illinois. While there he developed his first receiver, {{which was based on}} findings by two German scientists, Drs. A. Neugschwender and Emil Aschkinass. Their original design consisted of a mirror in which a narrow, moistened slit had been cut through the silvered back. Attaching a battery and <b>telephone</b> <b>receiver,</b> they could hear sound changes in response to radio signal impulses. De Forest, along with Ed Smythe, a co-worker who provided financial and technical help, developed variations they called [...] "responders".|$|E
2500|$|Unlike other {{microphone}} types, {{the carbon}} microphone {{can also be}} used as a type of amplifier, using a small amount of sound energy to control a larger amount of electrical energy. Carbon microphones found use as early telephone repeaters, making long distance phone calls possible in the era before vacuum tubes. These repeaters worked by mechanically coupling a magnetic <b>telephone</b> <b>receiver</b> to a carbon microphone: the faint signal from the receiver was transferred to the microphone, where it modulated a stronger electric current, producing a stronger electrical signal to send down the line. One illustration of this amplifier effect was the oscillation caused by feedback, resulting in an audible squeal from the old [...] "candlestick" [...] telephone if its earphone was placed near the carbon microphone.|$|E
5000|$|The forced neon bulb {{oscillator}} was {{the first}} system in which chaotic behavior was observed. [...] Van der Pol and van der Mark wrote, concerning their experiments with demultiplication, thatOften an irregular noise is heard in the <b>telephone</b> <b>receivers</b> before the frequency jumps to the next lower value. However this is a subsidiary phenomenon, the main effect being the regular frequency demultiplication.|$|R

2500|$|Unsatisfied by {{classes at}} Zanesville High School in 1884, R.D. Mershon joined a crew {{surveying}} for a railroad. Working under Mr. Bateman, a surveyor, he gained hands-on {{experience with a}} transit and level. Bateman would not answer Mershon's questioning, referring him instead to the Handbook of Civil Engineering by [...] John Trautwine. From that point he learned to use reference works. Given that young Merson {{had an interest in}} mechanics, a coworker suggested he study at Ohio State. Returning to Zanesville, Mershon turned to superintendent of schools William D. Lash for examination and certification. Mershon was admitted to Ohio State in the fall of 1886. His skills being evident, in his senior year he served as student assistant. In 1890 he graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering. After graduation he was an assistant instructor in electrical engineering. Working with alternating current machinery, Mershon developed a means of waveform measurement. It is described as an instantaneous potentiometer method, employing [...] a <b>telephone</b> <b>receiver</b> to indicate balance. This work attracted the attention of the Westinghouse Electric Company.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the line}} {{connections}} were completed Graham Bell heard [...] "...explosive sounds, like {{the discharge of}} artillery.... mixed with a continuous crackling noise of an indescribable character". [...] Bell began to troubleshoot his device and after changing his telephone receiver's electromagnet from low to high resistance, voices suddenly emerged from the receiver [...] "clearly and strongly", on a telegraph line connection of some 106km (66 miles) length. [...] Speaking to his son in Paris from Brantford's Dominion Telegraph office, Professor Alexander Melville Bell sang songs, quoted Shakespeare and read poetry. In Paris, news of Bell's test quickly drew crowds of onlookers who witnessed Melville's voice emanating from the crude metal box. With only a <b>telephone</b> <b>receiver</b> Alexander Graham Bell could not respond directly to his father, and instead replied back by telegraph on a separate line to Brantford. Nevertheless Alexander Graham much later declared {{that this was the}} first one-way long distance call [...] "of several miles", but noted it was [...] "the first transmission at a distance, but it was not the first reciprocal conversation over a line. That was held in Boston on 9 October 1876." ...|$|E
2500|$|There were {{at least}} two occurrences of {{immediate}} censorship of the series.

[...] Wheeeooo! Okay." [...] The first airing of [...] "Hut Sut Raw" [...] included a scene in which Rocko is picking berries; upon picking one lower on the bush, a bear rushes out whimpering and grasping his crotch. This scene is untouched in Canada. Both scenes were edited by Nickelodeon after their first broadcasts and are the only instances of censorship on the season two DVD, released in 2012. On the season three DVD, the [...] "Wacky Delly" [...] segment was shortened by approximately ten seconds to remove footage of Sal Ami repeatedly whacking Betty Bologna over the head with a <b>telephone</b> <b>receiver.</b> In addition, the restaurant named [...] "Chokey Chicken" [...] (a term for masturbation) was renamed [...] "Chewy Chicken" [...] for the series' fourth season.

40|$|Background and objectives: Pathogens can be {{transferred}} via the hands of thepersonnel not only to themselves but also to their families or to the patientcausing infection especially nosocomial infections. Microbial contamination ofhand is caused by contact with patients and their environments or usual devicesin the workplace. It seems that contamination of computer devices andhandsets are more in hospital than official buildings. The {{aim of this study}} wasto assess and compare the microbial contamination of computer keyboards,mouse and <b>telephone</b> <b>receivers</b> in a hospital department and an officialbuilding. Material and Methods: the sterile swab samples obtained from 32 keyboards, 31 computer mouse and 30 <b>telephone</b> <b>receivers</b> in the official building ofMashhad medical university and central laboratory of Imam Reza hospital werecultured on Blood agar and MacConkey agar plates. Results: Out of 64 samples from the official building, we identify 83 microbialgerms. The most common ones are gram-positive Bacilli (n = 34, 40. 95 %) andcoagulase-negative Staphylococci (n = 32, 32. 53 %). Of 29 samples of centrallaboratory, there are 33 microbial germs. The most common of them are grampositiveBacilli (n = 19, 57. 57 %) and coagulase-negative Staphylococci (n = 7, 21. 21 %). Overall, microbial contamination of the computer equipment andhandsets is not statistically meaningful (P< 0. 05). Some germs like diphtheroidare not existed in laboratory, but two cases of Aspergillus are found. Conclusion: The presence of most of the germs on these devices is due todusting or normal flora transferred via staffs’ hands. Only two of them,coagulase-positive Staphylococci and Aspergillus, should be consideredcarefully because they may cause serious infections in staff, their families orpatients.
