5|$|Coonhounds existed as a {{distinct}} type by the mid-to-late 1800s. By 1885 a raccoon pelt sold for approximately 25 cents, a fair price for the <b>time.</b> <b>Up</b> to World War I raccoons were very common despite being hunted often, and were sometimes poisoned {{to keep them from}} destroying crops.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{being located}} outside Kyustendil at the <b>time,</b> <b>up</b> until the {{construction}} of the city's main Bulgarian National Revival-style church in 1816, the Church of St George served as Kyustendil's cathedral. The church suffered some severe damage during the 19th century, the time of the Ottoman rule of Bulgaria; it was mostly destroyed, leaving only the foundations of the arches. It was reconstructed in 1878–1880, just after the establishment of the Principality of Bulgaria, with further restoration in the 2000s.|$|E
5|$|As a {{survival}} horror game, Revelations emphasizes survival, evasion, and exploration over fast-paced combat {{by providing the}} player with limited ammunition, health, and movement speed. The player {{has the ability to}} run, climb ladders, swim and dive underwater for a limited period of <b>time.</b> <b>Up</b> to three firearms can be carried at one time, in addition to grenades and the standard combat knife. Firearms range from handguns to shotguns, submachine guns and rifles. When aiming a firearm to shoot enemies, the gameplay switches into a first-person perspective. Playing as Jill, the player can upgrade firearms by finding special items throughout the game. The player may also perform melee attacks when an enemy has been stunned after being shot at the right time. Ammunition and health suppliers are dispersed among the game to help players increase their resources. A device called Genesis can be used to scan and find items hidden throughout the game's environments. The game also features an automap to help players navigate the game.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: {{physical}} mobility testing {{is an essential}} component of the geriatric assessment. The <b>timed</b> <b>up</b> and go test measures basic mobility skills including a sequence of functional manoeuvres used in everyday life. OBJECTIVES: to create a practical cut-off value to indicate normal versus below normal <b>timed</b> <b>up</b> and go test performance by comparing test performance of community-dwelling and institutionalised elderly women. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: 413 community-dwelling and 78 institutionalised mobile elderly women (age range 65 - 85 years) were enrolled in a cross-sectional study. MEASUREMENTS: <b>timed</b> <b>up</b> and go test duration, residential and mobility status, age, height, weight and body mass index were documented. RESULTS: 92 % of community-dwelling elderly women performed the <b>timed</b> <b>up</b> and go test in less than 12 seconds and all community-dwelling women had times below 20 seconds. In contrast only 9 % of institutionalised elderly women performed the <b>timed</b> <b>up</b> and go test in less than 12 seconds, 42 % were below 20 seconds, 32 % had results between 20 and 30 seconds and 26 % were above 30 seconds. The 10 (th) - 90 (th) percentiles for <b>timed</b> <b>up</b> and go test performance were 6. 0 - 11. 2 seconds for community-dwelling and 12. 7 - 50. 1 seconds for institutionalised elderly women. When stratifying participants according to mobility status, the <b>timed</b> <b>up</b> and go test duration increased significantly with decreasing mobility (Kruskall-Wallis-test: p> 0. 0001). Linear regression modelling identified residential status (p> 0. 0001) and {{physical mobility}} status (p> 0. 0001) as significant predictors of <b>timed</b> <b>up</b> and go performance. This model predicted 54 % of total variation of <b>timed</b> <b>up</b> and go test performance. CONCLUSION: residential and mobility status were identified as the strongest predictors of <b>timed</b> <b>up</b> and go test performance. We recommend the <b>timed</b> <b>up</b> and go test as a screening tool to determine whether an in-depth mobility assessment and early intervention, such as prescription of a walking aid, home visit or physiotherapy, is necessary. Community-dwelling elderly women between 65 and 85 years of age should be able to perform the <b>timed</b> <b>up</b> and go test in 12 seconds or less...|$|R

5|$|Barbara Bell, another scholar, {{believes}} that an economic catastrophe {{such as a}} famine or a long-lasting drought affected Egypt. To better {{address the problem of}} feeding the Egyptian population, Nynetjer split the realm into two and his successors founded two independent realms, perhaps with intent to reunite after the famine. Bell points to the inscriptions of the Palermo stone, where, in her opinion, the records of the annual Nile floods show constantly low levels during this period. Bell's theory is refuted today by Egyptologists such as Stephan Seidlmayer, who asserts her calculations were incorrect. Seidlmayer has shown that the annual Nile floods were at usual levels at Nynetjer's <b>time</b> <b>up</b> to the period of the Old Kingdom. Bell overlooked that the heights of the Nile floods in the Palermo stone inscription take into account the measurements of the nilometers around Memphis, but not elsewhere along the river. A state-wide drought was unlikely.|$|E
5|$|From 1915 onwards the MTT had {{to compete}} against {{unregulated}} private buses, often preceding the trams on the same route to steal fares, which the MTT countered by opening their own motor bus routes from 1925. The South Australian government began regulating buses within the state in 1927, although some private operators used {{a provision in the}} Australian constitution to their advantage. By notionally marking each ticket as a fare from the pickup point to Murrayville, Victoria (but allowing passengers to board or alight sooner) companies avoided having to abide by the regulation for some <b>time.</b> <b>Up</b> until the end of World War I, most Adelaideans were dependent on public transport for daily journeys. The introduction of private automobiles decreased passenger numbers until petrol rationing during World War II led to a resurgence in patronage; patronage remained higher than before the war, until rationing was discontinued in 1951.|$|E
5|$|Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! premiered at Liberty Cinema in {{southern}} Mumbai on 5 August 1994; it eventually ran there for over 100 weeks.

When initial viewers complained about the film's length, 2 of the 14 song sequences were removed. These were later restored when film goers were found to enjoy all of the songs.

5|$|Impact {{from the}} {{hurricane}} was severe and widespread. Initially forecast to remain offshore, the system curved northeast and moved ashore, {{becoming one of}} Mexico's worst natural disasters at the <b>time.</b> <b>Up</b> to 150 boats were submerged. Countless homes in Colima and Jalisco were damaged or destroyed, large portions of the states were inaccessible by flash flooding, and hundreds of residents were stranded. All coconut plantations were blown down during the storm, leaving thousands without work and instating fear {{that it would take}} the economy years to recover. Torrential rainfall across mountain terrain contributed to numerous mudslides that caused hundreds of fatalities. In the aftermath of the cyclone, convoys delivering aid were hindered by the destruction. Residents were vaccinated {{to prevent the spread of}} disease.

5|$|The oldest known Japanese {{large-scale}} {{works are}} historical books (Kojiki and Nihon Shoki) or regional cultural and geographical records (fudoki) compiled on imperial {{order in the}} early 8th century. They were written {{with the aim of}} legitimizing the new centralized state under imperial rule by linking the origin of emperors to the Age of the Gods. The oldest of these historical books is the Kojiki ("Record of ancient matters") dating from 712 and composed by Ō no Yasumaro at the request of Empress Genmei. Written in ancient Japanese style using Chinese ideographs, it presents the mythological origin of Japan and historical events up to the year 628. Shortly after the completion of the Kojiki, the Nihon Shoki (or Nihongi) appeared in 720, probably originating to an order by Emperor Tenmu in 681. It is a much more detailed version of the Kojiki, dating events and providing alternative versions of myths; it covers the <b>time</b> <b>up</b> to 697. Compared to the Kojiki, it follows the model of Chinese dynastic histories more closely in style and language, using orthodox classical Chinese. Both of these works provide the historical and spiritual basis for shinto.|$|E
5|$|Born in Ashford, Kent, Fuller {{was spotted}} playing for his local club, Kennington Juniors FC, by Premier League side Charlton Athletic who signed him to their youth Academy {{at the age}} of thirteen. The full-back progressed through the Addicks' Academy up until the age of nineteen, signing his first {{professional}} contract on 1 July 2004. On 17 July 2004, he featured for Charlton Athletic in a pre-season friendly win over Kent League side Sittingbourne; he scored in the 83rd minute to confirm a 3–0 win following a brace by fellow youngster Lloyd Sam. The young right-back was selected to captain Charlton Athletic's Reserves side during the 2004–05 season, helping the club to finish as Champions of the Premier Reserve League Southern Division. He also represented Charlton in the first ever Premier Reserve League Shield national play-off final on 12 May 2005, which saw Northern Division champions Manchester United Reserves beat the Addicks 4–2 at The Valley. Despite his success with the Reserves, however, he failed to break into the first team and was subsequently loaned out to League Two side Barnet on an initial one-month deal on 12 January 2006. The 21-year-old defender made his Football League debut on 14 January 2006 in a 4–1 defeat by Lincoln City. On 15 February 2006, it was announced that he would remain with Barnet for a further month. On 18 March 2006, he scored his first Football League goal in a 2–2 draw with Peterborough United. On 24 March 2006, Barnet manager Paul Fairclough extended Fuller's loan for a third and final <b>time</b> <b>up</b> until 22 April. He played his final game for the Bees on 22 April 2006 in a 0–0 draw with Chester City before subsequently returning to Charlton Athletic. In total, he made fifteen league appearances for Barnet during the 2005–06 season, which proved to be a vital contribution in helping the club avoid relegation from the Football League. Despite impressing on his loan spell, the 20-year-old defender was released by Charlton Athletic manager Alan Curbishley {{at the end of the}} season.|$|E

In 2006, <b>Time’s</b> <b>Up!</b> released an extensive study, prepared by economist, Charles Komanoff, to inform New York taxpayers of the money spent by the city and state to suppress the monthly Critical Mass ride. <b>Time's</b> <b>Up!</b> has also teamed up with New York University's Sustainability Taskforce to promote non-polluting transportation and environmental education among the NYU student body.|$|R
5|$|Following the {{departure}} of Gomes, Bordeaux hired rookie manager Laurent Blanc ahead of the 2007–08 season. Chamakh has stated on several occasions that Blanc was an important figure in his development as a footballer. However, when Blanc first arrived to the club, Chamakh struggled to earn meaningful minutes because Blanc preferred David Bellion, a new recruit. His playing <b>time</b> <b>up</b> front was further hampered {{by the arrival of}} striker Fernando Cavenaghi, who had a prolific season scoring 15 goals in only 23 appearances. Due to Cavenaghi's emergence, Chamakh was used as a target man and scored four goals, his lowest output since becoming a professional. In the 2008–09 season, Chamakh was relegated to appearing as a substitute {{for the first half of}} the campaign. However, on 21 December 2008, Chamakh convinced Blanc to change his mind. With Bordeaux trailing 3–0 against Monaco, Chamakh appeared as a substitute and, within minutes on the field, scored a goal. Following a goal from Alou Diarra to make the match 3–2, Chamakh equalized three minutes from time and, two minutes later, Cavenaghi netted the game-winner to give Bordeaux a 4–3 victory. Following the winter break, Blanc decided to use both Chamakh and Cavenaghi in the attack with influential playmaker Yoann Gourcuff acting in support. It was the former who developed a consistent partnership with Gourcuff, and Chamakh responded by scoring eight league goals in the second half of the season. On 30 May 2009, Bordeaux sealed their first league title since the 1998–99 season after defeating Caen 1–0 at the Stade Chaban Delmas. Chamakh played the entire match. The club also won the Coupe de la Ligue, completing the league and league cup double.|$|E
5|$|The Resale Prices Bill was {{introduced}} to deny manufacturers and suppliers the power to stipulate the prices at which their goods must be sold by the retailer. At the <b>time,</b> <b>up</b> to forty per cent of goods sold in Britain were subject to such price fixing, {{to the detriment of}} competition and to the disadvantage of the consumer. Douglas-Home, less instinctively liberal on economic matters than Heath, would probably not have sponsored such a proposal unprompted. However, he gave Heath his backing, in the face of opposition from some cabinet colleagues, including Butler, Hailsham and Lloyd, and a substantial number of Conservative backbenchers. They believed the change would benefit supermarkets and other large retailers at the expense of proprietors of small shops. The government was forced to make concessions to avoid defeat. Retail price maintenance would continue to be legal for some goods; these included books, on which it remained in force until market forces led to its abandonment in 1995. Manufacturers and suppliers would also be permitted to refuse to supply any retailer who sold their goods at less than cost price, as a loss leader. The bill had a difficult Parliamentary passage during which the Labour party generally abstained, leaving the Conservatives to vote for or against their own government. The bill received the royal assent in July 1964, but did not become operative until 1965, by which time Douglas-Home, Heath and their colleagues were out of office.|$|E
