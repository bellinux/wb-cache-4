5|$|Determined <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> an actress, Monroe {{continued}} {{studying at}} the Actors' Lab, and in October she {{appeared as a}} blonde vamp in the short-lived play Glamour Preferred at the Bliss-Hayden Theater, but the production was not reviewed by any major publication. To promote herself, she frequented producers' offices, befriended gossip columnist Sidney Skolsky, and entertained influential male guests at studio functions, a practice she had begun at Fox. She also became a friend and occasional sex partner of Fox executive Joseph M. Schenck, who persuaded his friend Harry Cohn, the head executive of Columbia Pictures, to sign her in March 1948.|$|E
5|$|I {{was playing}} the nice girl. It's really hard to play. All the other {{characters}} came from somebody and I said to Mike , 'Where do I come from?' And he said, 'You were the fantasy girl.' I {{found it hard to}} make anything of that. In the end I felt the only thing I could do was <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> hyper real as I could. I'm not a natural comedienne.|$|E
5|$|Lewis Harry Holtby {{was born}} on 18 September 1990 in Erkelenz, West Germany. He began playing {{football}} {{at the age of}} four with amateur side Sparta Gerderath, a club with whom his father had also previously played, before signing for Borussia Mönchengladbach when he was 11-years old. He spent three seasons in Gladbach's academy before the club let him go in 2004, deeming him to be too small and slow <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a professional footballer. Following his release, Holtby elected to sign for Alemannia Aachen in the second tier of German football at the age of 14.|$|E

5|$|Hepburn's next feature, Stage Door (1937), paired {{her with}} Ginger Rogers in {{a role that}} {{mirrored}} her own life—that of a wealthy society girl trying <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> an actress. Hepburn was praised for her work at early previews, which gave her top billing over Rogers. The film was nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards, {{but it was not}} the box-office hit RKO had hoped for. Industry pundits blamed Hepburn for the small profit, but the studio continued its commitment to resurrecting her popularity. She was cast in Howard Hawks' screwball comedy Bringing Up Baby (1938), where she played a flighty heiress who loses a leopard while trying to woo a palaeontologist (Cary Grant). She approached the physical comedy of the film with confidence, and took tips on comedic timing from her costar Walter Catlett. Bringing Up Baby was acclaimed by critics, but it was nevertheless unsuccessful at the box office. With the genre and Grant both hugely popular at the time, biographer A. Scott Berg believes the blame lay with moviegoers' rejection of Hepburn.|$|E
5|$|Muramasa was {{worked on}} by 16 people, {{over half the}} entire staff of Vanillaware, {{including}} Kamitani as the game's writer. The Wii {{was chosen as the}} game's platform of release as its specs were fairly close to that of the PlayStation 2, the console for which Odin Sphere was developed. This meant that the team could carry over their earlier experience rather than start from scratch learning about new hardware. Kamitani did create design proposals for versions on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, but went undeveloped due to budget limitations. Using the Wii's motion controls was tested by the team, but due to the game's old-fashioned style there was little need to implement them. The biggest problem when developing for the Wii was the graphics, especially how to get the various pieces of artwork in the game's scenery to interact and respond properly. They also wanted to keep loading times down to a minimum, which was made possible due to the Wii's area pre-loading abilities. Technical tinkering of this kind went on until the end of development. The game's programmer was Kentaro Ohnishi, whose biggest challenge was creating a battle system which allowed for cancelling of attacks, while maintaining the appearance of smooth attack animation. The resultant code looked so strange that another programmer thought it was a fault and deleted it, forcing Ohnishi to rebuild it. The team was highly dedicated {{to the success of the}} project, putting a large amount of work <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> good as it could be for players. By the time of release, funds for the company had been drained.|$|E

25|$|For a time, a German company {{wanted to}} make it. In 1954, the Distributors Corporation of America wanted <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> an {{animated}} film.

In 1958, {{the authors of the}} musical teamed with Sidney Buchman to produce the film independently but the film did not proceed.|$|E
25|$|A 2004 {{meeting with}} internationally {{acclaimed}} photographer Bruce Weber led to Reed's big break, {{a photo shoot}} and website video appearance for Abercrombie & Fitch. Reed appeared on a billboard in Times Square with a LIVE TO SURF tattoo and subsequently {{on the cover of}} Abercrombie & Fitch's 2004 back-to-school catalog. More than 10 million homes throughout the United States received a copy of that catalog, and that cover subsequently has appeared as an ad in Rolling Stone, GQ, Teen Vogue, and the premiere issue of VITALS. Reed credits the 2004 Abercrombie & Fitch cover for giving him the needed credentials <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a professional model.|$|E

Mardle who usually takes to be {{struggling}} to produce his best darts closed the gap to 7-5 but missed a chance <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> 7-6 <b>as</b> Baxter moved clear to 8-5. Baxter missed a match dart in the next leg and Mardle took double six. But it was different in the 15th as Mardle missed his chance <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> 8-7 <b>as</b> Baxter moved through.|$|R
25|$|At {{the same}} time, he persuaded his {{authority}} to fund major capital spending to sustain modern police efficiency. The Home Office authorised Hertfordshire {{to be the}} first force after the war to introduce a wireless system, one which Young adapted for rural circumstance from his Birmingham model. <b>To</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> effective as possible, the Home Office accepted his proposal that the wireless network needed to be set up for a larger area than one county so the neighbouring county force of Bedfordshire was added. Almost simultaneously, Young was appointed by the Home Office to a committee chaired by Sir Percy Sillitoe, Chief Constable of Kent, to consider the wireless needs of all forces. Young's action plan for the co-ordination and standardisation of all inter-force communications was rapidly accepted.|$|E

Molly invites Nomi backstage at Goddess, the Stardust Casino show where she works, to meet Cristal Connors, the diva star of the topless dance revue. When Nomi tells Cristal she dances at Cheetah's Topless Club, Cristal derisively tells her that what she does is akin to prostitution. When Nomi is too upset {{to go to work}} that night, Molly takes her dancing at The Crave Club. After getting into a fight with James, a bouncer at the club, Nomi is arrested. James bails her out of jail, but she pays him little notice.|$|E
25|$|The fourth series {{features}} Nero, now in {{the main}} role, and his crew have replaced Josh and the Elmsbury gang who have all temporarily departed the series (except Isaac, who becomes Elmsmere's caretaker) and Dexter is trying <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> an accomplished teacher, but is given the new job {{of taking care of}} Nero's shenanigans, which indirectly resembles Josh and Nathan's relationship in the first series. The teachers who appeared in series 3, Miss Parkwood and Aine O'Brien do not appear in this series, leading to the re-introduction of former head teacher Anita Andress (Liz Hume-Dawson). The series also introduced a new main character, rebellious and cynical tomboy Clem Burton (Jade Alleyne), who joins Nero's crew as well as mysterious spray paintings of Andress appear around Elmsmere, called 'The Phantom Sprayer', however it was later revealed that it was Mr. Bell who was the criminal. A new love interest for Dexter, Science teacher Lizzie Baker (Sarah Schoenbeck), is introduced in episode one. A new recurring character, Isobel Harlow (Ruby Barnhill) appears from episode three. This series also features mini cameos from Josh's gang as shown in the series premiere and series finale. Nathan also makes his comeback in two episodes.|$|E

25|$|Strong {{performances}} {{on the tour}} meant that Agassi was quickly tipped as a future Grand Slam champion. While still a teenager, he reached the semifinals of both the French Open and the US Open in 1988 and made the US Open semifinals in 1989. He began the 1990s {{with a series of}} near-misses. He reached his first Grand Slam final in 1990 at the French Open, where he was favored before losing in four sets to Andrés Gómez, which he attributes to worrying about his wig falling off. He reached his second Grand Slam final of the year at the US Open, defeating defending champion Boris Becker in the semifinals. His opponent in the final was Pete Sampras; a year earlier, Agassi had crushed Sampras, after which he told his coach that he felt bad for Sampras because he was never going <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a pro. Agassi lost the US Open final to Sampras in three sets. The rivalry between these two American players became the dominant rivalry in tennis over the rest of the decade. Also in 1990, Agassi helped the United States win its first Davis Cup in 8 years and won his only Tennis Masters Cup, beating reigning Wimbledon champion Stefan Edberg in the final.|$|E
