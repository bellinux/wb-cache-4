5|$|From there, the Arabs turned west towards Nicaea, {{the chief}} city of Bithynia and {{capital of the}} {{powerful}} Opsician Theme. The Arabs arrived before the city in late July, with al-Battal's vanguard preceding the main army. The Byzantines, probably {{under the command of}} the Count of the Opsicians, Artabasdos, did not meet them in the field, but instead retreated behind the city's walls. The Arabs assaulted the city for forty days, employing siege engines which destroyed a part of the walls, but eventually failed to take it. In late August, they raised the siege and departed, taking along many captives and much booty. The 12th-century chronicle of Michael the Syrian claims that the city's inhabitants abandoned it and fled by ship through Lake Ascania, whereupon the Arabs destroyed Nicaea, but <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>clearly</b> an error.|$|E
5|$|Lachanodrakon reappears in 790, {{when the}} young emperor Constantine VI (r. 780–797) conspired to {{overturn}} the tutelage of Irene. The general was sent by Constantine to the Armeniac Theme to secure the allegiance of its soldiers. Constantine succeeded in toppling his mother in December 790; it was probably then that Lachanodrakon was rewarded with the supreme non-imperial title, that of magistros. According to the account of Theophanes, he participated in the imperial campaign against the Bulgars in 792 {{that led to the}} disastrous defeat at the Battle of Marcellae on 20 July, where he was killed. The history of John Skylitzes records his death in the Battle of Versinikia, again against the Bulgars, in 813, but <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>clearly</b> an error.|$|E
5|$|Sulu-type {{compositions}} on the kulintangan {{are found}} among the Tausug, Samal, Yakan, Sama/Badjao, Iranun and Kadazan-Dusun. Though there exist no identifiable rhythmic or melodic differences between patterns with names such as the Maguindanao, each group has their own music compositions. For instance, the Tausug have three identifiable compositions—Kuriri, Sinug, and Lubak-Lubak—the Yakan have two—Tini-id and Kuriri—and the Dusun have three—Ayas, Kudidi and Tidung. Though these melodies vary even within groups like the Maguindanao and Maranao, one theme which characterizes the Sulu-type is the exchange of short melodic phrases between the kulintangan and the Agungs, where both instruments imitate and duplicate each other's rhythms very quickly. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>clearly</b> seen in the Tausug Sinug and Yakan Tini-id and Kuriri compositions where this sort of jousting becomes a game of skill and virtuoso playing.|$|E

25|$|Einstein {{acknowledged}} {{the controversy over}} his derivation in his 1907 survey paper on special relativity. There he notes that it is problematic to rely on Maxwell's equations for the heuristic mass–energy argument. The argument in his 1905 paper {{can be carried out}} with the emission of any massless particles, but the Maxwell equations are implicitly used to make it obvious that the emission of light in particular can be achieved only by doing work. To emit electromagnetic waves, {{all you have to do}} is shake a charged particle, and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>clearly</b> doing work, so that the emission is of energy.|$|E

25|$|When an {{arbitrary}} {{beam of light}} strikes {{the surface of a}} birefringent material, the polarizations corresponding to the ordinary and extraordinary rays generally take somewhat different paths. Unpolarized light consists of equal amounts of energy in any two orthogonal polarizations, and even polarized light (except in special cases) will have some energy in each of these polarizations. According to Snell's law of refraction, the angle of refraction will be governed by the effective refractive index which is different between these two polarizations. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>clearly</b> seen, for instance, in the Wollaston prism which is designed to separate incoming light into two linear polarizations using a birefringent material such as calcite.|$|E
25|$|A via {{connected}} two cities. Viae {{were generally}} centrally {{placed in the}} countryside. The construction and care of the public roads, whether in Rome, in Italy, or in the provinces, was, at all periods of Roman history, {{considered to be a}} function of the greatest weight and importance. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>clearly</b> shown {{by the fact that the}} censors, in some respects the most venerable of Roman magistrates, had the earliest paramount authority to construct and repair all roads and streets. Indeed, all the various functionaries, not excluding the emperors themselves, who succeeded the censors in this portion of their duties, may be said to have exercised a devolved censorial jurisdiction.|$|E
25|$|Observe {{that the}} more {{fuel-efficient}} engines can use far less fuel; their mass is almost negligible (relative to {{the mass of the}} payload and the engine itself) for some of the engines. However, note also that these require a large total amount of energy. For Earth launch, engines require a thrust to weight ratio of more than one. To do this with the ion or more theoretical electrical drives, the engine would have to be supplied with one to several gigawatts of power, equivalent to a major metropolitan generating station. From the table {{it can be seen that}} <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>clearly</b> impractical with current power sources.|$|E

25|$|The United States Numbered Highways are a {{nationwide}} grid of highways, {{but unlike the}} Interstate Highway System, there is no minimum design standard for these highways. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>clearly</b> evident as some stretches of the U.S. Highways in Texas {{are nothing more than}} a two-lane rural road, while others are urban freeways. Although the U.S. Highways have been replaced for the most part by Interstate Highways for through traffic, the U.S. Highways still serve as important regional connectors. Several notable examples of U.S. Highways that are built to freeway standards include US 75 and US 80 in Dallas, US 59 and US 290 in Houston, and US 90 and US 281 in San Antonio.|$|E
25|$|A form {{of these}} arms {{was first used}} by King William the Lion in the 12th century, though no trace {{of them can be}} made out on his seal. However, a lion rampant can clearly be made out on the seal of his son, Alexander II. Over the years many writers have claimed them to be much older; even Alexander Nisbet, {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} more reliable Scottish heralds, claims that a lion was first adopted as a personal symbol by the legendary Fergus, with the royal tressure being added in the reign of Achaius. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>clearly</b> untrue as, even if Fergus and Achaius had existed, they predate the existence of heraldry by several centuries.|$|E
25|$|A {{converse}} of a theorem is {{a statement}} formed by interchanging what is given in a theorem and {{what is to be}} proved. For example, the isosceles triangle theorem states that if two sides of a triangle are equal then two angles are equal. In the converse, the given (that two sides are equal) and what is to be proved (that two angles are equal) are swapped, so the converse is the statement that if two angles of a triangle are equal then two sides are equal. In this example, the converse can be proved as another theorem, but this is often not the case. For example, the converse to the theorem that two right angles are equal angles is the statement that two equal angles must be right angles, and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>clearly</b> not always the case.|$|E

25|$|The Paradigm system {{consists}} of two basic parts: an insulin pump and an optional glucose sensor CGM worn for up to 3 days. The disposable sensor is subcutaneously-placed to make glucose measurements in interstitial fluid every 5 minutes and transmit the reading via {{low power radio frequency}} (ISM band) to the pump for realtime display. However, insulin therapy may be conducted without CGM and although there is not yet an automated insulin-regulation feedback mechanism between measure and infusion to control the amount and timing of insulin, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>clearly</b> a future objective. So any change in basal or bolus is patient-driven by programming the pump using the Bolus WizardTM. The latest model pumps are the MiniMed Paradigm 522 and 722 which differ in reservoir size, 176 versus 300 units, respectively. In 2007 the FDA approved a pediatric model for patients 7 to 17 years old.|$|E
25|$|The dating {{of these}} events is disputed. Choniates records {{the date of the}} clash between the {{supporters}} of the Caesarissa and the imperial troops as 2 May on the 15th indiction, i.e. 2 May 1182, but as Varzos points out, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>clearly</b> an error, as this was the date of the Massacre of the Latins. Many modern scholars have therefore interpreted the date as 2 May 1181, but this contradicts the indiction dating given by Choniates. Among the scholars who accept the dating {{of these events}} to 1181, several, including the English translator of Choniates, Harry Magoulias, place the date of the intended coup on 7 February, but as Choniates' German editor Jean-Louis Van Dieten points out, for the year 1181 the correct date of the feast described by Choniates was 21 February. According to this chronology, the condemnation of the conspirators took place on 1 March, and the clashes took place on 2 May. The historian Oktawiusz Jurewicz, in his study on Andronikos I Komnenos, placed the events in 1182. As other events took place soon after, he proposed that the uprising and reconciliation all took place in February 1182, with the date for the original, aborted coup on 13 February.|$|E
25|$|The exact {{mechanisms}} {{behind this}} complex {{sequence of events}} are still a matter of debate. To simplify the system and allow more definitive study, many experiments have been performed in vitro with synthetic lipid vesicles. These {{studies have shown that}} divalent cations {{play a critical role in}} the fusion process by binding to negatively charged lipids such as phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin. One role on these ions in the fusion process is to shield the negative charge on the surface of the bilayer, diminishing electrostatic repulsion and allowing the membranes to approach each other. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>clearly</b> not the only role, however, since there is an extensively documented difference in the ability of Mg2+ versus Ca2+ to induce fusion. Although Mg2+ will induce extensive aggregation it will not induce fusion, while Ca2+ induces both. It has been proposed that this discrepancy is due to a difference in extent of dehydration. Under this theory, calcium ions bind more strongly to charged lipids, but less strongly to water. The resulting displacement of calcium for water destabilizes the lipid-water interface and promotes intimate interbilayer contact. A recently proposed alternative hypothesis is that the binding of calcium induces a destabilizing lateral tension. Whatever the mechanism of calcium-induced fusion, the initial interaction is clearly electrostatic, since zwitterionic lipids are not susceptible to this effect.|$|E
30|$|Another particularity of RCC {{metastasis}} to the ovary is {{the relative}} rarity of bilateral ovarian involvement.
