25|$|He has won {{praise for}} his man-management and talent {{spotting}} skills, especially {{his ability to}} discover young players in non-League football at the sixth tier and below, develop them and then sell them – often for a significant profit. Players <b>that</b> <b>Still</b> <b>has</b> developed that {{have gone on to}} play at a higher level include Marlon King, Craig Mackail-Smith, Paul Benson, Sam Saunders, Danny Green, and Dwight Gayle. Dagenham & Redbridge managing director Steve Thompson has stated that Still's ability to do this kept the club consistently able to compete while operating on a far smaller budget than its rivals. Still's reputation for nurturing talent, combined with his vast array of contacts within the game gained through decades of coaching, have also led to highly rated young players from Premier League academies joining his teams on loan. Examples include Marlon Pack and Matt Ritchie at Dagenham, and Cameron McGeehan, Pelly Ruddock Mpanzu and Elliot Lee at Luton.|$|E

500|$|In 1721, the London Journal {{reported}} [...] "the ground {{upon which}} the May Fair formerly was held is marked out for a large square, and several fine streets and houses are to be built upon it". Sir Richard Grosvenor, 4th Baronet asked the surveyor Thomas Barlow to design a street layout, which has survived mostly intact {{to the present day}} despite most of the properties being rebuilt. Barlow proposed a straightforward grid of wide, straight streets, with a large place as a centrepiece. Buildings were constructed here in quick succession, and by the mid-18th century it was covered in houses. Much of the land was based around seven estates – Burlington, Millfield, Conduit Mead, Albemarle Ground, the Berkeley, the Curzon and, most importantly, the Grosvenor. Of the original properties constructed in Mayfair, only the Grosvenor estate survives intact and owned by the same family, who subsequently became the Dukes of Westminster in 1874. Chesterfield Street {{is one of the few}} streets in Mayfair <b>that</b> <b>still</b> <b>has</b> 18th century properties on both sides, with one single exception, and is probably the least altered road in the area.|$|E
