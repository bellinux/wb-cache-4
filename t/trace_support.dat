40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2015 The sensory {{modalities}} {{of hearing}} and balance are {{mediated by the}} six sensory organs of the inner ear that are each comprised of the same two main cell types, support cells and mechanosensory hair cells. Loss of the sensory hair cells from these organs causes permanent hearing loss and/or balance disorders, as there is currently no therapeutic treatment for hair cell loss. In developing organs, hair cells can be generated through the transdifferentiation of support cells caused by inhibition of the Notch signaling pathway, which is normally required to determine and maintain the precise ratio of hair cells and support cells through lateral inhibition. Although the efficacy of this method declines as the organs mature and Notch signaling is downregulated, previous {{research has shown that}} the Notch downstream effector, Hes 5, is present in the adult cristae, suggesting that Notch signaling may be active and that the cristae of the adult mouse may retain some regenerative ability. In this dissertation, I tested this hypothesis and showed that Notch signaling is active in the peripheral region of the adult cristae and, using hair cell counts and lineage tracing, that supernumerary hair cells can be generated through inhibition of Notch signaling in vitro. Further, through an analysis of the spatial distribution of hair cell birth in the developing cristae, I showed that there is a correlation between the regions that maintain regenerative competence in the adult and the last regions to exit the cell cycle. In addition, to aid future regenerative studies, I identified a new support cell marker {{that can be used to}} lineage <b>trace</b> <b>support</b> cells and have used this marker to characterize spontaneous hair cell regeneration in the adult cristae in vivo. I also created standard protocols for lesioning hair cells in vivo in two common mouse strains using the known ototoxin 3, 3 ’-Iminodipropionitrile (IDPN) and for quantifiably assaying vestibular behavior in mice with varying degrees of hair cell lesion. Together, this work establishes the previously uncharacterized mouse cristae as an additional model for studying the mechanisms of hair cell regeneration and provides some of the tools necessary for future studies. Supplemental Movie 1. 1 The inner ear contains six distinct sensory organs: The cochlea, utricle, saccule, posterior cristae, horizontal cristae, and anterior cristae. These organs be seen in an intact E 15. 5 inner ear labeled for the sensory regions with Sox 2 (white) and in a color coded model of the position of the Sox 2 -labeled sensory organs created by 3 -dimensionally rendering tracings of the Sox 2 regions in the individual confocal slices. Supplemental Movie 2. 1 Cristae are highly three-dimensional, composed of two saddle-shaped hemicristae separated by the eminentia cruciatum. Sox 9 (red) labels support cells as well as non-sensory cells in the eminentia cruciatum and throughout the ampulla and semicircular canals. Gfi 1 (white) labels all hair cells in the sensory epithelium. Hes 5 -GFP is expressed in a subset of support cells in the Calretinin-negative peripheral zone. Note that while the overall structure of the sensory epithelium was preserved, the normally dome-like Sox 9 + ampulla flattened onto the sensory epithelium. Dimensions in μm (w x h x d) - 544. 9 x 272. 5 x 75. 5. Supplemental Movie 2. 2 An example of a lineage traced transitional cell from the mTmG mouse (see Figure 7 B-B’’). The GFP+ cell expressed Gfi 1, but had an elongated body similar to a support cell. The nucleus was lifting off of the basement membrane and the apical part of the cell had an unusual appearance unlike a normal hair cell or support cell. There was also another GFP+ support cell that spans the sensory epithelium as well as several non-sensory cells in view. Dimensions in μm (w x h x d) – 36. 4 x 61. 2 x 6. 9. Supplemental Movie 2. 3 An example of a lineage traced transitional cell from the mTmG mouse (see Fig. 7 CC’’).

Un-fortunately, many high-performance machines provide execution profile summaries as the only tool for per-formance investigation.

This library has been extended to use the automatic instrumentation facilities on these machines, allowing trace data from routine entry and exit, and other pro-gram segments, to be captured.

However, whether regeneration and embryonic development are controlled by identicall, similar or different genetic programmes has not been fully tested. Here, we analyse proximal-distal regeneration in Drosophila leg imaginal discs using the expression of positional markers, and by cell-lineage experiments, and we compare it with the pattern already known in normal development. During regeneration, the first proximal-distal positional markers reappear in overlapping patterns. As the regenerate expands, they segregate and further markers appear until the normal pattern is produced, following a proximal to distal sequence that is in fact the reverse of normal leg imaginal disc development. The results of lineage <b>tracing</b> <b>support</b> this interpretation and show that regenerated structures derive from cells near the wound edge. Although leg development and leg regeneration are served by a set of identical genes, the ways their proximal-distal patterns are achieved are distinct from each other.
