40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to compare psychosocial {{outcomes}} for 50 new clinic attendees, referred for cancer genetic counselling to five UK centres. The centres represented England, Scotland and Wales, and were randomly selected from groups ranked by different levels of clinical activity in cancer genetics practice. Questionnaires assessed demographic data, risk perception, mental health and use of health services pre-consultation and at 1 and 12 months follow-up. Satisfaction was measured for attendees and referring doctors at follow-up. A total of 256 unaffected adults fulfilled the study criteria. The five centres varied widely with respect to service organisation and activity, but all had a greater proportion of unaffected attendees with a breast cancer risk (61 - 91 %) than either a bowel cancer risk (0 - 33 %) or ovarian cancer risk (3 - 25 %). There were no significant differences in the psychosocial data <b>between</b> <b>centres</b> pre-counselling. No significant change over time occurred for any of the centres for risk perception or general psychological distress. There were significant differences <b>between</b> <b>centres</b> in reduction of cancer worry from baseline to 12 months and with the number of women who were recommended to have mammographic surveillance who had not received this. Overall, one-third of women for whom mammography had been recommended had not been screened within 1 year of follow-up. Subsequent attendance at the GP, but not at a hospital, was associated with risk level, but differences <b>between</b> <b>centres</b> could not be analysed. Satisfaction differed significantly <b>between</b> <b>centres</b> for 4 : 14 aspects of service provision and with 3 : 17 items concerning communication; satisfaction was high overall. Over 90 % of referring doctors were moderately/very satisfied with the service, but 23 % were dissatisfied with waiting times and 19 % with access to preventive treatment. Results differed significantly <b>between</b> <b>centres</b> for doctor's satisfaction with the provision of referral criteria and prescribing information. In conclusion, there were relatively few significant differences in psychosocial outcomes <b>between</b> <b>centres,</b> considering the wide variation in service organisation and activity. These significant differences were not consistent across the centres, therefore, differences could not be linked to specific aspects of service provision...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Two studies {{investigated}} updating of self-position {{and heading}} during real, imagined, and simulated locomotion. Subjects {{were exposed to}} a two-segment path with a <b>turn</b> <b>between</b> segments; they responded by turning to face the origin as they would if they had walked the path and were {{at the end of}} the second segment. The conditions of pathway exposure included physical walking, imagined walking from a verbal description, watching another person walk, and experiencing optic flow that simulated walking, with or without a physical <b>turn</b> <b>between</b> the path segments. If subjects failed to update an internal representation of heading, but did encode the pathway trajectory, they should have overturned by the magnitude of the <b>turn</b> <b>between</b> the path segments. Such systematic overturning was found in the description and watching conditions, but not with physical walking. Simulated optic flow was not by itself sufficient to induce spatial updating that supported correct turn responses...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Assessment of centre {{variation}} in renal transplantation outcome {{provides an opportunity}} to examine differences in quality of care <b>between</b> <b>centres.</b> However, differences in outcome may represent differences in patient factors <b>between</b> <b>centres</b> and be biased by sampling variability and inadequate data ascertainment. METHODS: Differences in 12 -month graft survival in 1986 primary renal transplant adult recipients from 16 <b>centres</b> in Australia <b>between</b> 1993 and 1998 were examined. Fifteen recipient and donor factors known prior to transplantation were examined to determine factors independently predictive of graft survival. Differences <b>between</b> <b>centres</b> in these factors were examined. Unadjusted and multivariable adjusted outcomes for each centre were compared to the average for all centres. Multivariable hierarchical modelling was employed to account for potential bias due to sampling variability. RESULTS: Factors predictive of reduced 12 -month graft survival on multivariable analysis that were significantly different <b>between</b> <b>centres</b> were time on dialysis prior to transplantation, donor age, organ source, and number of human lymphocyte antigen mismatches. Unadjusted 12 -month graft survival for all centres was 91. 7 % and ranged from 83. 1 to 96. 4 %. Although two centres performed significantly lower than average, this poorer outcome was accounted for {{in one of these}} two centres after adjusting for factors shown to be independently predictive of outcome. However, multivariable hierarchical modelling failed to identify any centre as performing significantly different to average, with 12 -month graft survival ranging from 89. 2 to 92. 2 %. Outcome in patients excluded from the study due to inadequate data ascertainment was significantly worse than patients who were included. CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence of centre variation after accounting for {{variation in}} risk factors predictive of poor outcome <b>between</b> <b>centres,</b> as well as potential bias due to sampling variability. Exclusion of patients due to inadequate data remains an important source of bias in estimating accurate outcomes. Appropriate analytical strategies and consideration of sources of bias are important for the valid identification of centres with poorer outcomes. Esther M. Briganti, Rory Wolfe, Graeme R.
