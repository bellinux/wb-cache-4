5|$|The USB {{standard}} specifies relatively loose tolerances for compliant USB connectors {{to minimize}} physical incompatibilities in connectors from different vendors. To address a weakness present {{in some other}} connector standards, the USB specification also defines limits <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> of a connecting device {{in the area around}} its plug. This was done to prevent a device from blocking adjacent ports due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> of the cable strain relief mechanism (usually molding integral with the cable outer insulation) at the connector. Compliant devices must either fit within the size restrictions or support a compliant extension cable that does.|$|E

5|$|The lake {{existed in}} several stages over the last 2,000 years, {{periodically}} drying and refilling and eventually disappearing sometime after 1580.

30|$|The {{best fit}} {{transverse}} section method presented an excellent agreement <b>to</b> <b>the</b> drill <b>sizes</b> (0.899 of ICC) and a mean difference of 0.07  mm <b>to</b> <b>the</b> drill <b>sizes,</b> comparable <b>to</b> 2 D CT method with a 0.9222 ICC and 0.33  mm mean difference <b>to</b> <b>the</b> drill <b>size.</b> <b>The</b> intra-rater agreement was excellent (0.999 of ICC) {{because of the}} semi-automated nature of the measurement that only varied according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> position of the measurement. The ability of using the 3 D image avoids the possible bias of the image cut selection and the tunnel-images mismatch present on 2 D measurements. This method preserves the 2 D CT method ability of evaluating the enlargement in different portions of the tunnel length. The best fit cylinder method presented a good agreement <b>to</b> <b>the</b> drill <b>size</b> (0.745 of ICC), and the closest mean difference <b>to</b> <b>the</b> drill <b>size</b> 0.04  mm. It {{has the advantage of}} evaluating the entire tunnel at once and was automated. The wall thickness method presented a poor agreement <b>to</b> <b>the</b> drill <b>size</b> and had a mean difference compared <b>to</b> <b>the</b> drill <b>sizes</b> of 3.38  mm due to variability in orientation of the triangles that composed the 3 D model shape, downsizing the overall measurement.|$|R
