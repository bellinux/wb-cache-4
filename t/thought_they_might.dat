5|$|At 07:00 on 4 August, {{while the}} French {{squadron}} was cruising off the Brazilian coast, lookouts sighted sails on the horizon. Uncertain {{of the identity}} of the strange ships, the French gradually closed the distance during the morning. Landolphe could see that there were seven large vessels and three smaller ships, all unmistakably British. He was unable however to tell whether they were naval ships of the line or East Indiamen. Initially he <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> be merchant ships, but at noon he sighted double rows of gunports along the side of each ship and called off the attack, turning away and signalling for his squadron to split up, believing the enemy to be large warships easily capable of destroying his small force. Captain Jurien protested Landolphe's order, insisting that the convoy was composed of merchant ships and not warships, but Landolphe over-ruled Jurien's protests. In fact, Jurien was correct.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{recognizable}} of all dinosaurs, Stegosaurus has been depicted on film, in cartoons and comics, as children's toys, and was even declared the State Dinosaur of Colorado in 1982. Due to the fragmentary nature of most early Stegosaurus fossil finds, it took many years before reasonably accurate restorations of these animals could be produced. The earliest popular image of Stegosaurus was an engraving produced by A. Tobin for the November 1884 issue of Scientific American, which included the dinosaur amid a speculative Morrison age landscape. Tobin restored the Stegosaurus as bipedal and long-necked, with the plates arranged along the tail and the back covered in spikes. This covering of spikes might {{have been based on}} a misinterpretation of the teeth, which Marsh had noted were oddly shaped, cylindrical, and found scattered, such that he <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> turn out to be small dermal spines.|$|E
25|$|About 5:00a.m., Griffin's {{division}} {{was told to}} move to the left to J. Boisseau's house. Since Warren did not know Pickett had withdrawn his force, he still expected Griffin to be able to intercept them. Griffin's force moved in line of battle with great care because they <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> strike the Confederate force from White Oak Road while moving toward the Crump Road. The Confederates did not attack and Warren remained with Crawford until he reached Crump Road.|$|E

60|$|I wandered {{from one}} fire to another {{to observe the}} conduct of the men in bivouac. They were {{generally}} light-hearted, being very young and hopeful. Evidently their great desire was to meet with the enemy. Whatever <b>thoughts</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> have had of home, they did not at that time express them aloud. Some among them, however, were grave and sad; a few were stern--almost sulky.|$|R
25|$|About 5:00a.m., Griffin's {{division}} {{was told to}} move to the left to J. Boisseau's house. Since Warren did not definitely know that Pickett had withdrawn his force, he still thought Griffin could intercept the Confederates. Griffin moved Chamberlain's brigade at the head of his column in line of battle with great care because Griffin <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> strike the Confederate force if they emerged from White Oak Road while his division moved toward Crump Road. The Confederates did not attack and Griffin advanced on Crump Road. With a Confederate counterattack still thought to be possible as Crawford moved, Warren remained with Crawford until he reached Crump Road when Warren perceived that the Confederates from the White Oak Road Line were not going to wait for or follow the moving Union division.|$|E
25|$|With Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins, Owen {{helped create}} the first life-size sculptures {{depicting}} dinosaurs as he <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> have appeared. Some models were initially created for the Great Exhibition of 1851, but 33 were eventually produced when the Crystal Palace was relocated to Sydenham, in South London. Owen famously hosted a dinner for 21 prominent men of science inside the hollow concrete Iguanodon on New Year's Eve 1853. However, in 1849, {{a few years before}} his death in 1852, Gideon Mantell had realised that Iguanodon, of which he was the discoverer, was not a heavy, pachyderm-like animal, as Owen was proposing, but had slender forelimbs; his death left him unable to participate {{in the creation of the}} Crystal Palace dinosaur sculptures, and so Owen's vision of dinosaurs became that seen by the public. He had nearly two dozen lifesize sculptures of various prehistoric animals built out of concrete sculpted over a steel and brick framework; two Iguanodon, one standing and one resting on its belly, were included.|$|E
25|$|The {{large size}} of the monolete pollen of Macroneuropteris and other seed ferns {{suggests}} {{that they may not}} have been well adapted to wind dispersal. This raises speculation about the possibility of insect pollination. One of those possibilities is Arthropleura, a very large millipede of the carboniferous. Scott and Taylor (1983) studied seed-fern pollen on the plates of Arthropleura and <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> have a role in pollination. W. A. Shear and others have noted that this is very unlikely due to the size of Arthropleura. Other insects of the carboniferous however may have been pollinators. The cycads, a modern seed plant with some similar affinities to seed ferns, were previously thought to only be pollinated by wind. New studies have confirmed the role of Thrips and other beetles in their pollination. This form of pollination is now known to be present {{as far back as the}} Cretaceous. A similar relationship may have occurred between these seed ferns and some carboniferous insects.|$|E

25|$|This second convoy was {{the convoy}} that Arrow and Acheron were escorting. Early {{on the morning}} of 3 February the British were off Cap Caxine when they sighted the two French vessels, which the British {{initially}} <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> be members of the convoy rejoining. When {{it became clear that the}} strange vessels were French frigates, Arrow threw of the tow to the brig Adventure, which had been leaking and which the British destroyed to prevent her falling into enemy hands. Arrow and Acheron then placed themselves between the convoy and the pursuing French. Vincent signaled the vessels of the convoy to make for a per-designated rendezvous point. The French frigates did not catch up to the Royal Navy vessels until the morning of 4 February. Initially, Hortense engaged Acheron, and Arrow fired a broadside into Hortense as well. About two hours later, Incorruptible joined the action. Vincent signaled to Duchess of Rutland, the most capable, though minimally so, of the merchant vessels, to join the action, a signal Duchess of Rutland ignored. Throughout the action the Royal Navy vessels were at a disadvantage. Not only did the French frigates have more cannons and men, but the French cannons were guns, whereas the British cannons were almost all carronades. The French could therefore stand off and fire their guns while out of the effective range of the carronades. Also, the French were carrying a large number of troops who harassed the British with small arms fire whenever the vessels closed.|$|E
500|$|Two of {{the ships}} {{anchored}} in Young's Bay, near Calliaqua, while the third anchored off Kingstown. The ships flew no national colours, leading to local speculation as to their intent. Local planters who <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> be merchant vessels expected {{to pick up the}} sugar harvest prevented a sentry at one of the island's coastal fortifications from firing a signal cannon, and one man sent out to one {{of the ships}} was taken prisoner. As the French began landing their troops, a small company under Captain Percin de la Roque was landed on the eastern shore to mobilise the Caribs. [...] These irregular forces, which grew to number about 800, quickly overran British settlements near the borders between the British lands and those of the Caribs, while du Rumain led his main body of troops toward Kingstown.|$|E
500|$|The boats {{made good}} {{progress}} through the morning, and Melville initially <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> strike land after a single night at sea. In the afternoon the weather worsened; the boats separated and lost sight of each other. De Long used a sea anchor to stabilize his craft in the ferocious seas, and despite having his sail torn away by the wind, managed to hold a course to the west. The storm had largely subsided by the morning of September 14, but progress was erratic {{in the absence of}} the sail, and it was three more days before the cutter ran aground at the most northerly limit of the Lena Delta. De Long and his crew waded ashore, carrying their provisions from the boat, and prepared for a long foot journey. [...] Based on their map, the nearest settlement appeared to lie [...] away. De Long thought their rations would last for three-and-a-half days.|$|E

60|$|At last, Ned {{thought he}} saw a passage {{between two of the}} big rocks, through which it might be possible, he <b>thought,</b> that <b>they</b> <b>might</b> swim, and so avoid the certain death which seemed to await them at every other spot.|$|R
500|$|After the king's {{commission}} {{had been}} read aloud, {{the crowd was}} normally asked to move back from the scaffold before being addressed by the convict. [...] While these speeches were mostly an admission of guilt (although few admitted treason), still they were carefully monitored by the sheriff and chaplain, who were occasionally forced to act; in 1588, Catholic priest William Dean's address to the crowd was considered so inappropriate that he was gagged {{almost to the point}} of suffocation. [...] Questions on matters of allegiance and politics were sometimes put to the prisoner, as happened to Edmund Gennings in 1591. [...] He was asked by priest hunter Richard Topcliffe to [...] "confess his treason", but when Gennings responded [...] "if to say Mass be treason, I confess to have done it and glory in it", Topcliffe ordered him to be quiet and instructed the hangman to push him off the ladder. [...] Sometimes the witness responsible for the condemned man's execution was also present. [...] A government spy, John Munday, was in 1582 present for the execution of Thomas Ford. [...] Munday supported the sheriff, who had reminded the priest of his confession when he protested his innocence. [...] The sentiments expressed in such speeches may be related to the conditions encountered during imprisonment. [...] Many Jesuit priests suffered badly at the hands of their captors but were frequently the most defiant; conversely, those of a higher station were often the most apologetic. [...] Such contrition may have arisen from the sheer terror felt by those who <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> be disembowelled rather than simply beheaded as they would normally expect, and any apparent acceptance of their fate may have stemmed from the belief that a serious, but not treasonable act, had been committed. [...] Good behaviour at the gallows may also have been due to a convict's desire for his heirs not to be disinherited.|$|E
500|$|As {{she arrived}} at the court Canning was cheered by the large crowd {{gathered}} outside the building. [...] Inside, she testified that she was taken by two men [...] "to the prisoner Wells's house" [...] at about 4am on the morning of 2January. [...] In the kitchen, the old woman (Squires) was sat in a chair and asked her [...] "if I chose to go their way". [...] Canning's refusal had prompted Squires to cut off her stays, slap her face, and push her up the stairs into a darkened room. [...] She told the court she [...] "saw nothing brought uphen day-light appeared, I could see about the room; there was a fire-place and a grate in it, no bed nor bedstead, nothing but hay to lie upon; there was a black pitcher not quite full of water, and about twenty-four pieces of bread ... about a quartern loaf". [...] She claimed to have escaped by removing a board from a window {{at the north end of}} the loft, climbing out, and jumping down to the soft clay below. [...] She fled along a lane behind the house, through some fields, and on finding a road set out for London. [...] When asked if she had seen or spoken to anyone on the way back, she replied that she had not, explaining that she had shied away from contact for fear of meeting somebody from the house she had escaped from. [...] Canning was cross-examined by William Davy, who questioned her recollection of events in the house. [...] Asked why she had not attempted escape earlier she replied: [...] "Because I <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> let me out; it never came into my head till that [...] morning." [...] Squires, who had been quietly muttering to herself in the dock, shouted [...] "I never saw that witness in my lifetime till this day three weeks".|$|E
2500|$|About 30 {{seconds after}} seeing the first flash of light, Arnold saw a series of bright flashes in the {{distance}} off to his left, or north of Mt. Rainier, which was then 20 to [...] away. He <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> be reflections on his airplane's windows, but a few quick tests (rocking his airplane from side to side, removing his eyeglasses, later rolling down his side window) ruled this out. The reflections came from flying objects. They flew in a long chain, and Arnold for a moment considered they might be a flock of geese, but quickly ruled this out {{for a number of}} reasons, including the altitude, bright glint, and obviously very fast speed. He then <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> be a new type of jet and started looking intently for a tail and was surprised that he couldn't find any.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Caryll {{considered}} them a moment, {{his face a}} mask, his mind entirely detached. They interested him profoundly. This subjugation of two natures that in themselves were arrogant and cruel was a process very engrossing to observe. He tried to conjecture what <b>they</b> felt, what <b>thoughts</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> be harboring. And {{it seemed to him}} that a sort of paralysis had fallen on their wits. They were stunned under the shock of the blow he had dealt them. Anon there would be railings and to spare--against him, against themselves, against the dead man above stairs, against Fate, and more besides. For the present there was this horrid, almost vacuous calm.|$|R

60|$|Captain Vane {{was with}} them that morning, and {{it was easy to}} see that the Captain was in a {{peculiar}} frame of mind. A certain twinkle in his eyes and an occasional smile, apparently at nothing, showed that his <b>thoughts,</b> whatever <b>they</b> <b>might</b> be, were busy.|$|R
2500|$|But {{his time}} at Bemerton was short. Having {{suffered}} {{for most of his}} life from poor health, in 1633 Herbert died of consumption only three years after taking holy orders. Shortly before his death, he sent the manuscript of The Temple to Nicholas Ferrar, the founder of a semi-monastic Anglican religious community at Little Gidding, reportedly telling him to publish the poems if he <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> [...] "turn to the advantage of any dejected poor soul", otherwise to burn them. Thanks to Ferrar, they were published not long after his death.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{specimens}} of the fern {{to be recognized}} were collected by Edward Willis Graves in 1917 at Sand Mountain near Trenton, Georgia. While Graves at first <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> be a variant form of A.pinnatifidum, further study in conjunction with William R. Maxon revealed them to be a hybrid between A.pinnatifidum and A.bradleyi, both of which occurred nearby. Maxon published {{a description of the}} new species in 1918. Specimens in the herbarium of Harold W. Pretz, collected in 1913 along the lower Susquehanna River and labeled as [...] "A.pinnatifidum", were subsequently identified as the new species.|$|E
2500|$|However, Hitler and {{his allies}} instead quickly marginalized Papen {{and the rest of}} the cabinet. For example, as part of the deal between Hitler and Papen, Göring had been {{appointed}} interior minister of Prussia, thus putting the largest police force in Germany under Nazi control. He frequently acted without consulting his nominal superior, Papen. The American historian Gerhard Weinberg wrote about the conservative majority of the first Hitler cabinet in 1933 [...] "...that the incredibly low intellectual and political level of most of those who <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> restrain Hitler by serving in the same cabinet with him rarely put Hitler's abilities to any severe test".|$|E

2500|$|For many years, {{before the}} advent of Doppler radar, {{scientists}} had nothing more than educated guesses as to the speed of the winds in a tornado. [...] The only evidence indicating the wind speeds found in the tornado was the damage left behind by tornadoes which struck populated areas. Some believed they reach others <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> exceed , and perhaps even be supersonic. One can still find these incorrect guesses in some old (until the 1960s) literature, such as the original Fujita Intensity Scale developed by Dr. Tetsuya Theodore Fujita in the early '70s. However, one can find accounts (e.g. be sure to scroll down) of some remarkable work done in this field by a U.S. Army soldier, Sergeant John Park Finley.|$|E
2500|$|Rotoreliefs {{were the}} next phase of Duchamp's {{spinning}} works. To make the optical [...] "play toys", he painted designs on flat cardboard circles and spun them on a phonographic turntable. When spinning, the flat disks appeared three-dimensional. He had a printer produce 500 sets of six of the designs, and set up a booth at a 1935 Paris inventors' show to sell them. The venture was a financial disaster, but some optical scientists <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> be of use in restoring three-dimensional stereoscopic sight to people who have lost vision in one eye. In collaboration with Man Ray and Marc Allégret, Duchamp filmed early versions of the Rotoreliefs and they named the film Anémic Cinéma (1926). Later, in Alexander Calder's studio in 1931, while looking at the sculptor's kinetic works, Duchamp suggested that these should be called [...] "mobiles". Calder agreed to use this novel term in his upcoming show. To this day, sculptures of this type are called [...] "mobiles".|$|E
