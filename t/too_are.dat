5|$|Military bands, <b>too,</b> <b>are</b> {{popular in}} Italy. At a {{national}} level, {{one of the}} best-known of these is the concert band of the Guardia di Finanza (Italian Customs/Border Police); it performs many times a year.|$|E
5|$|Textiles {{are made}} from both animal fibres, {{including}} wool and silk, and plant fibres, including cotton and flax. Dyestuffs <b>too</b> <b>are</b> made both from animals, including carmine from the bodies of insects, and from plants, including indigo, , and lichens.|$|E
5|$|Animals such as frogs are {{patterned}} so {{that when}} they are at rest with legs tucked in, their outline is powerfully disrupted with markings that seem to flow across body and leg boundaries. Eyes <b>too</b> <b>are</b> often hidden in stripes.|$|E
50|$|Bug <b>Too!</b> <b>is</b> a {{platforming}} video game, {{the sequel}} to Bug!. Bug <b>Too!</b> <b>was</b> originally released for the Sega Saturn on November 30, 1996 in North America. It was then ported to Windows on December 10, 1996.|$|R

5|$|Caligula's sister, Agrippina the Younger, {{wrote an}} {{autobiography}} that certainly included a detailed explanation of Caligula's reign, but it too is lost. Agrippina was banished by Caligula for her connection to Marcus Lepidus, who conspired against him. The inheritance of Nero, Agrippina's {{son and the}} future emperor, was seized by Caligula. Gaetulicus, a poet, produced a number of flattering writings about Caligula, but they <b>too</b> <b>are</b> lost.|$|E
5|$|In {{contemporary}} times, {{the shrine}} {{has become a}} controversial symbol for Japanese nationalists. While many citizens of various political persuasions visit the site to honor relatives killed in battle, whose kami (spirit) {{are said to be}} enshrined there, so <b>too</b> <b>are</b> the kami of several class-A war criminals. These criminals were enshrined in a secret ceremony in 1978, which has raised the ire of Japanese pacifists and the international community.|$|E
5|$|In {{military}} usage, soldiers often either exchange their disruptively-patterned summer uniforms for thicker snow camouflage uniforms {{printed with}} mainly-white versions of camouflage patterns in winter, or they wear white overalls over their uniforms. Some armies have {{made use of}} reversible uniforms, printed in different seasonal patterns on their two sides. Vehicles and guns are often simply repainted in white. Occasionally, aircraft <b>too</b> <b>are</b> repainted in snow camouflage patterns.|$|E

50|$|Cartoon Network <b>Too</b> <b>was</b> a British TV network {{created by}} Turner Broadcasting. CN <b>Too</b> <b>is</b> the sister station of Cartoon Network, and it often aired {{programmes}} {{a while after}} they are shown on the main Cartoon Network. During the daytime, it usually aired some action-adventure programming such as Ben 10: Alien Force and Star Wars: The Clone Wars. During overnight hours, usually between midnight and 06:00, it also aired some shows which are no longer being produced, and {{are no longer in}} high demand (i.e. Skatoony). Cartoon Network <b>Too</b> <b>was</b> closed on 1 April 2014.|$|R

5|$|Some of {{the most}} {{powerful}} and long-lasting stories are the foundation stories, also called origin or creation myths such as the Dreamtime myths of the Australian aborigines, the Mesopotamian Epic of Gilgamesh, or the Hawaiian stories of the origin of the world. These <b>too</b> <b>are</b> developed into books, films, music and games in a way that increases their longevity and enhances their entertainment value.|$|E
5|$|As the Doctor and {{geologist}} Nasreen Chaudhry arrive by TARDIS in {{the massive}} Silurian underground civilisation, they are captured and taken to the Silurian doctor, Malohkeh. The Silurians' hostility is increased when the Doctor recalls his previous meeting with a similar race of reptilian humanoids which were destroyed by humans, {{a reference to the}} Third Doctor in Doctor Who and the Silurians. Meanwhile, Amy and Mo escape from Malokeh's experimentation and Mo discovers his son, Elliot, sedated in a chamber and under observation. When Malokeh realises the Doctor is not human, the leader of the Silurian warrior caste, Restac, insists both the Doctor and Nasreen be executed and escorts them to a Silurian court; though Amy and Mo interrupt the trial with stolen weapons, they <b>too</b> <b>are</b> captured. Eldane, Restac's superior, is called in by Malohkeh and demands a halt to the hostilities.|$|E
5|$|Fish, {{traditionally}} carp, but now other firm {{white fish}} <b>too,</b> <b>are</b> minced and shaped into loaves or balls and cooked in fish broth, {{such as the}} gefilte fish of the Ashkenazi Jews, who also brought pickled herring from Eastern Europe. Herring is often served at the kiddush that follows synagogue services on Shabbat, especially in Ashkenazi communities. In the Russian immigrant community it may be served as a light meal with boiled potatoes, sour cream, dark breads and schnapps or vodka.|$|E

5|$|Like the SPARTAN-IIs, the SPARTAN-III {{candidates}} undergo radical cybernetic {{and biological}} enhancements and are outfitted with special armor {{to increase their}} abilities. The first SPARTAN-III company proves highly successful, but is wiped out when ordered to destroy a Covenant orbital shipyard in 2537. Shaken by the massacre of his troops, Kurt improves the training regimen for his next batch of SPARTAN-III recruits, but they <b>too</b> <b>are</b> all killed in action so Kurt, {{in an effort to}} reduce casualties, institutes illegal biological modifications on the third company of SPARTANs. While conducting a training exercise near Zone 67, UNSC personnel find themselves under attack by alien robotic drones.|$|E
5|$|Meru, Lyme, {{and their}} allies travel to Germany to find the Magician, another former agent. They arrive {{during one of the}} Magician's acts and Meru unintentionally negates her abilities, ruining the performance. This angers the Magician, who decides to ally herself with the Eraser out of spite. The Eraser's {{recruits}} use the Magician's help to set a trap for Lyme, Duncan, and Perrier. Lyme is beaten into a coma and left for dead, although he is found by passersby and taken to a hospital. Duncan and Perrier escape, but are now disconnected from Meru and the others. Meanwhile, Meru, Bill, and Dusty follow up a different lead in Hong Kong. They <b>too</b> <b>are</b> attacked by the Eraser, resulting in Dusty and Bill's deaths. Meru escapes, and is now more resolved than ever to stop the Eraser.|$|E
5|$|Practical uses include as food (entomophagy), in medicine, for the {{valuable}} textile silk, for dyestuffs such as carmine, in science, where the fruit fly {{is an important}} model organism in genetics, and in warfare, where insects were successfully used in the Second World War to spread disease in enemy populations. One insect, the honey bee, provides honey, pollen, royal jelly, propolis and an anti-inflammatory peptide, melittin; its larvae <b>too</b> <b>are</b> eaten in some societies. Medical uses of insects include maggot therapy for wound debridement. Over a thousand protein families {{have been identified in}} the saliva of blood-feeding insects; these may provide useful drugs such as anticoagulants, vasodilators, antihistamines and anaesthetics.|$|E

5|$|Sometimes {{circumstances}} {{such as a}} good {{breeding season}} followed by a food source failure the following year lead to irruptions in which large numbers of a species move far beyond the normal range. Bohemian waxwings Bombycilla garrulus well show this unpredictable variation in annual numbers, with five major arrivals in Britain during the nineteenth century, but 18 between the years 1937 and 2000. Red crossbills Loxia curvirostra <b>too</b> <b>are</b> irruptive, with widespread invasions across England noted in 1251, 1593, 1757, and 1791.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{have had}} great trouble {{determining}} the exact dispositions of the French fleet {{and even more}} trouble assessing the casualties it suffered in the battle. During The Terror then raging in France, bureaucracy broke down and consequently records were patchy or non-existent. The French Navy was no exception and few ship's logs have survived, making an accurate order of battle difficult to discern. Those estimates which are available are often the work of British naval officers at the battle whose accounts frequently differ. Casualties <b>too</b> <b>are</b> almost impossible to establish exactly. French sources published after the battle give a figure of 3,000, but this number does not include those captured, which amounted to 3,500 alone. British estimates aboard captured ships alone are of 1,500 casualties and most historians agree that total French losses during the month-long campaign were around 7,000, {{as opposed to the}} British losses estimated at between 1,100 and 1,500.|$|E
5|$|In Shanghai {{during the}} 1930s, Sing {{and his friend}} Bone attempt to join the Deadly Axe Gang, which ruthlessly {{controls}} the city {{under the leadership of}} Brother Sum. Sing seeks to restore his confidence after being humiliated as a young boy while trying to protect a mute girl from bullies, due to the failure of the Buddhist Palm method he had learned from a pamphlet he bought from a beggar. Sing and Bone attempt to intimidate the residents of Pig Sty Alley but are chased off by its Landlady. Hearing of this, Sum orders the capture of Sing and Bone, while sending the Gang to reassert its authority {{in the wake of the}} humiliation. Three of the tenants, Coolie, Tailor, and Donut, reveal themselves to be martial arts masters, defeating more than fifty of the Gang. Fearing retribution, the Landlady evicts the three, but they encounter a pair of hired assassins who fight using a magical guqin that launches invisible blades. Coolie is beheaded, and Tailor and Donut are mortally wounded before the Landlady and her husband the Landlord reveal that they <b>too</b> <b>are</b> martial arts masters, having gone into self-exile after the death of their son. The two defeat the assassins but Tailor and Donut die from their injuries. The Landlords temporarily evacuate the other tenants for their safety.|$|E

5|$|In {{the project}} to replace the last {{artifact}} that underpins much of the International System of Units (SI), {{a variety of other}} very different technologies and approaches were considered and explored over many years. They <b>too</b> <b>are</b> covered below. Some of these now-abandoned approaches were based on equipment and procedures that would have enabled the reproducible production of new, kilogram-mass prototypes on demand (albeit with extraordinary effort) using measurement techniques and material properties that are ultimately based on, or traceable to, fundamental constants. Others were based on devices that measured either the acceleration or weight of hand-tuned kilogram test masses and which expressed their magnitudes in electrical terms via special components that permit traceability to fundamental constants. All approaches depend on converting a weight measurement to a mass, and therefore require the precise measurement of the strength of gravity in laboratories. All approaches would have precisely fixed one or more constants of nature at a defined value.|$|E
5|$|The {{sources for}} √Åed√°n's life include Bede's Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum; Irish annals, principally the Annals of Ulster and the Annals of Tigernach; and Adomn√°n's Life of Saint Columba. The Senchus fer n-Alban, a census and {{genealogy}} of D√°l Riata, purports to record his ancestry {{and that of}} his immediate descendants. None of these sources are contemporary. Adomn√°n's work was written in the very late 7th century, probably to mark the centenary of Columba's death. It incorporates elements from a lost earlier life of Columba, De virtutibus sancti Columbae, by Cumm√©ne Find. This may have been written as early as 640; neither the elements incorporated from Cumm√©ne's work nor Adomn√°n's own writings can be treated as simple history. Bede's history was written 30 years after Adomn√°n's. The surviving Irish annals contain elements of a chronicle kept at Iona {{from the middle of the}} 7th century onwards, so that these <b>too</b> <b>are</b> retrospective when dealing with √Åed√°n's time.|$|E
