5|$|Transcription {{produces}} a single-stranded RNA molecule known as messenger RNA, whose nucleotide sequence is complementary to the DNA {{from which it}} was transcribed. The mRNA acts as an intermediate between the DNA gene and its final protein product. The gene's DNA {{is used as a}} template to generate a complementary mRNA. The mRNA matches the sequence of the gene's DNA coding strand because it is synthesised as the complement of the template strand. Transcription is performed by an enzyme called an RNA polymerase, which reads the template strand in the 3' to 5'direction and synthesizes the RNA from 5' to 3'. To initiate transcription, the polymerase first recognizes and binds a promoter region of the gene. Thus, a major mechanism of gene regulation is the blocking or sequestering the promoter region, either by <b>tight</b> <b>binding</b> by repressor molecules that physically block the polymerase, or by organizing the DNA so that the promoter region is not accessible.|$|E

40|$|Substitution of BrdU for dT in {{mammalian}} DNA {{alters the}} rates of DNA cleavage by restriction endonucleases {{in a manner that}} can be related to the specificity of cleavage. A formula is proposed that describes inhibitory and stimulatory contributions arising from the substitution of a Br atom for the CH 3 group on T. The larger Br atom is postulated to sterically hinder the nuclease from binding to adjacent groups in the DNA cleavage site, while allowing a <b>tighter</b> <b>binding</b> to itself. The inhibition caused by steric hindrance is predicted to vary inversely with distance from the point of cleavage, whereas the stimulation caused by <b>tighter</b> <b>binding</b> is predicted to be independent of distance. The resultant formula gives a good fit to the data obtained for thirteen different restriction nucleases of known specificity. The parameters in the formula appear to be simple functions of ionic strength. This formula can be used to predict the effect of BrdU substitution on any endonuclease whose specificity of cleavage is known...|$|R

25|$|Specificity is endowed by {{the large}} contact area between enzyme and substrate. Proteases such as trypsin have {{specificity}} for one residue {{before and after the}} cleaved bond due to a shallow binding cleft with only one or two pockets that bind the substrate side chains. Conversely, viral proteases such as TEV protease have a long C-terminal tail which completely covers the substrate to create a binding tunnel. This tunnel contains a set of <b>tight</b> <b>binding</b> pockets such that each side chain of the substrate peptide (P6 to P1’) is bound in a complementary site (S6 to S1’).|$|E
25|$|When the {{endothelium}} is damaged, {{the normally}} isolated, underlying collagen {{is exposed to}} circulating platelets, which bind directly to collagen with collagen-specific glycoprotein Ia/IIa surface receptors. This adhesion is strengthened further by von Willebrand factor (vWF), which is released from the endothelium and from platelets; vWF forms additional links between the platelets' glycoprotein Ib/IX/V and the collagen fibrils. This localization of platelets to the extracellular matrix promotes collagen interaction with platelet glycoprotein VI. Binding of collagen to glycoprotein VI triggers a signaling cascade that results in activation of platelet integrins. Activated integrins mediate <b>tight</b> <b>binding</b> of platelets to the extracellular matrix. This process adheres platelets {{to the site of}} injury.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have shown}} that statins bind {{reversibly}} to the HGMR enzyme. The affinity of statins for HGMR enzyme is in the nanomolar range, while the natural substrate's affinity is in the micromolar range. Studies {{have shown that}} statins use the conformational flexibility of the HMGR enzyme that causes a shallow hydrophobic groove that the statins exploit and is used to accommodate their hydrophobic moieties. The specificity and the <b>tight</b> <b>binding</b> of statins is due to orientation and bonding interactions that form between the statin and the HMGR enzyme. Polar interactions are formed between the HMG-moiety and residues that {{are located in the}} cis loop of the enzyme. These polar interactions are between Ser684, Asp690, Lys691 and Lys692 (Figure 4). The terminal carboxylate of the HMG moiety forms a salt bridge with the cationic Lys735 of the enzyme. In addition to the polar interaction, Lys691 participates in a hydrogen bonding network with Glu559, Asp767 and the O5 hydroxyl group of the hydroxyglutartic acid component of the statins. Van der Waals interactions are formed between the hydrophobic side chains of the enzyme, which involve the Leu562, Val683, Leu853, Ala856 and Leu857 and the statins. Type 2 statins form polar interaction between the fluorine atom on the fluorophenyl group and the guanidinium group of Arg590. In addition to these interactions atorvastatin and rosuvastatin also form unique hydrogen bonds between Ser565 residue and either a carbonyl oxygen atom (atorvastatin) or a sulfone oxygen atom (rosuvastatin). A unique polar interaction between the Arg568 side chain and the electronegative sulfone group on rosuvastatin makes it the statin that has the greatest number of bonding interactions with HGMR.|$|E

40|$|An {{important}} functional {{property of}} protein protease inhibitors is their stability to proteolysis. Mesotrypsin {{is a human}} trypsin that has been implicated in the proteolytic inactivation of several protein protease inhibitors. We have found that bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI), a Kunitz protease inhibitor, inhibits mesotrypsin very weakly and is slowly proteolyzed, whereas, despite close sequence and structural homology, the Kunitz protease inhibitor domain of the amyloid precursor protein (APPI) binds to mesotrypsin 100 times more tightly and is cleaved 300 times more rapidly. To define features responsible for these differences, we have assessed the binding and cleavage by mesotrypsin of APPI and BPTI reciprocally mutated at two nonidentical residues that make {{direct contact with the}} enzyme. We find that Arg at P 1 (versus Lys) favors both <b>tighter</b> <b>binding</b> and more rapid cleavage, whereas Met (versus Arg) at P′ 2 favors <b>tighter</b> <b>binding</b> but has minimal effect on cleavage. Surprisingly, we find that the APPI scaffold greatly enhances proteolytic cleavage rates, independently of the binding loop. We draw thermodynamic additivity cycles analyzing the interdependence of P 1 and P′ 2 substitutions and scaffold differences, finding multiple instances in which the contributions of these features are nonadditive. We also report the crystal structure of the mesotrypsin·APPI complex, in which we find that the binding loop of APPI displays evidence of increased mobility compared with BPTI. Our data suggest that the enhanced vulnerability of APPI to mesotrypsin cleavage may derive from sequence differences in the scaffold that propagate increased flexibility and mobility to the binding loop...|$|R
500|$|The most {{controversial}} model, known as viral eukaryogenesis, posits that the membrane-bound nucleus, {{along with other}} eukaryotic features, originated from the infection of a prokaryote by a virus. The suggestion is based on similarities between eukaryotes and viruses such as linear DNA strands, mRNA capping, and <b>tight</b> <b>binding</b> to proteins (analogizing histones to viral envelopes). One version of the proposal suggests that the nucleus evolved in concert with phagocytosis to form an early cellular [...] "predator". Another variant proposes that eukaryotes originated from early archaea infected by poxviruses, {{on the basis of}} observed similarity between the DNA polymerases in modern poxviruses and eukaryotes. It has been suggested that the unresolved question of the evolution of sex could be related to the viral eukaryogenesis hypothesis.|$|E
500|$|The large nasal {{passages}} ensure fast flow {{of sufficient}} air, and the enlarged {{heart and lungs}} allow the enrichment of blood with oxygen in a short time. This allows cheetahs to rapidly regain their stamina after a chase. During a typical chase, their respiratory rate increases from 60 to 150 breaths per minute. While running, {{in addition to having}} good traction due to their semi-retractable claws, cheetahs use their tail as a rudder-like means of steering that enables them to make sharp turns, necessary to outflank antelopes that often change direction to escape during a chase. The protracted claws increase grip over the ground, while foot pads make the sprint more convenient over tough ground. The <b>tight</b> <b>binding</b> of the tibia and the fibula restrict rotation about the lower leg, thus stabilising the animal throughout the sprint; the downside, however, is that this reduces climbing efficiency. The pendulum-like motion of the scapula increases the stride length and assists in shock absorption. The extension of the vertebral column can add as much as [...] to the length of a stride. During {{more than half of the}} time of the sprint, the animal has all four limbs in the air; this also contributes to the stride length.|$|E
500|$|On December 2, 1957, at Yale University, Richards {{performed}} a simple experiment on the protein Ribonuclease A (RNase A) that helped change the scientific community's {{view of the}} physical nature of protein molecules. Using a particular protease (Subtilisin), RNase A was converted into a split protein (RNase S), which is composed of two parts called S-peptide and S-protein (...) [...] Richards had developed that cleavage system as a postdoc at the Carlsberg Laboratory in Copenhagen, Denmark, using purified ribonuclease protein that had been donated to Christian Anfinsen by the Armour Company and that Anfinsen shared with Richards and other researchers. Richards found that, when separated, S-protein and S-peptide had no RNase activity, but that the RNase enzymatic activity was restored when the parts were recombined in the test tube. In an autobiographical piece, Richards wrote that [...] "this discovery {{came as a surprise}} to the scientific community at that time.... In retrospect, this may have been the high point of my career in terms of excitement." [...] This experiment showed that proteins maintain 3-dimensional order and <b>tight</b> <b>binding</b> between their interacting parts and that the structural information is inherent in the protein itself, foreshadowing both Anfinsen's later work showing that sequence determines structure and also the idea that hormones or other small molecules can bind tightly and specifically to proteins, a concept basic to how pharmaceutical companies design drugs today. Two years later, the protein structure of myoglobin confirmed such specific 3D relationships. [...] Later, with Marilyn Doscher and Flo Quiocho, Richards demonstrated that ribonuclease S as well as carboxypeptidase were enzymatically active in the crystals, important evidence to silence doubts that the conformations of proteins in crystals are directly relevant to their biological activity in cells.|$|E
