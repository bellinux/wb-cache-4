5|$|On October 18, several {{thunderstorms}} {{already developed}} during the morning hours and continued to intensify during the afternoon. Just after 11:00 am EDT, one tornado in downtown Pensacola, Florida caused some extensive damage {{to the roof of}} a Baptist church as well as portions of Cordova Mall but there were no reported injuries at the Church and daycare center. During the early evenings severe weather affected the Louisville, Kentucky Metro area in which tree damage and power outage were reported throughout the area and a possible tornado at around 7:00 pm EDT near the Crescent Hill area which was later confirmed as a brief EF0. Still in the region, one tree fell over a passing car but <b>the</b> <b>motorist</b> escaped injuries although he was trapped for several minutes inside. The Louisville power authority, the LG reported as much as 2,500 homes without power mostly in St. Matthews and Crescent Hill areas. More storms rolled through much of the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys {{during the second half of}} the evening and overnight with more storms in Michigan.|$|E
5|$|The Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike {{uses the}} ticket system method of tolling between the Mid-County and Wyoming Valley toll plazas {{along with the}} {{mainline}} Pennsylvania Turnpike. With the ticket system, a motorist receives a ticket upon entering the turnpike at an interchange and pays the fare and surrenders the ticket upon exiting. If a motorist loses the ticket, the turnpike charges the highest fare to the exit where <b>the</b> <b>motorist</b> leaves. Mainline toll plazas are also located at Keyser Avenue and Clarks Summit, charging a flat rate. There are no tolls on exit ramps between Wyoming Valley and Clarks Summit. E-ZPass is accepted at all toll plazas. As of 2017, it costs a passenger vehicle $12.10 to travel {{the length of the}} Northeast Extension between Mid-County and Wyoming Valley using cash and $8.54 using E-ZPass. The Keyser Avenue and Clarks Summit toll plazas cost $1.45 using cash and $0.81 using E-ZPass for passenger vehicles.|$|E
40|$|A key {{strategy}} in achieving sustainable transportation is {{the full cost}} charging regime for <b>the</b> <b>motorists.</b> However, <b>the</b> development of rational and fair charging policies {{must be based on}} the recognition of true externalities that are currently not paid for by <b>the</b> <b>motorists.</b> This research has revealed that contrary to common belief, the external components of the highly publicized community cost of accidents and congestion are insignificant. However, the environmental impacts of transportation are significant and very little of this cost is recovered from <b>the</b> <b>motorists.</b> This finding is useful for developing full cost charging system...|$|R

5|$|The tickets {{along the}} Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike were {{originally}} handed out by person. In 1987, machines started to replace humans in distributing tickets. In 1990, an {{electronic toll collection}} system was proposed for the Pennsylvania Turnpike, where a motorist would create an account and use an electronic device that would be read from an electronic tollbooth. <b>The</b> <b>motorist</b> would be billed later. The multi-state electronic tolling system, which was to be called E-ZPass, was planned to be implemented by 1998. The planned installation date was later pushed back to 2000. On December2, 2000, E-ZPass debuted along the Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike between Mid-County and Lehigh Valley. On December15, 2001, E-ZPass was extended to include {{the entire length of the}} Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike. Commercial vehicles were allowed to start using E-ZPass on December14, 2002.|$|E
5|$|Ottawa County is {{the final}} Oklahoma county that both US-60 and US-69 will pass through. The two routes first pass through the town of Afton. The first highway {{junction}} in the county is with US-59, which concurs {{with the other two}} highways. Less than a mile north of the US-59 junction, the three highways pass through a cloverleaf interchange; proceeding north through this interchange places a motorist on US-59/US-69 bound for Miami, heading west leads to the toll booth for I-44, and turning east puts <b>the</b> <b>motorist</b> on US-60 eastbound. US-60, now with no other highways concurrent with it, will parallel the BNSF rail line for the remainder of its time in Oklahoma. The next town the route passes through is Fairland; here, it has a brief concurrency with SH-125. US-60 crosses the Neosho River (also known as the Grand River) into Twin Bridges State Park. Within the park, the highway serves as the southern terminus of SH-137. US-60 crosses the Spring River to exit the park. Northeast of Wyandotte, US-60 has a brief concurrency with SH-10. As it approaches the state line, US-60 Business splits from US-60, serving Seneca, Missouri. US-60 then leaves Oklahoma, continuing into Newton County, Missouri.|$|E
5|$|US-59 heads northward, {{coming to}} an {{interchange}} with US-271 {{just north of the}} Choctaw Country Club in the city of Poteau, county seat of Le Flore County. At this interchange, US-59 exits from the mainline to join US-271; continuing north through the interchange places <b>the</b> <b>motorist</b> on the Poteau Bypass, an unnumbered state highway. US-59 and US-271 proceed through Poteau, {{coming to an}} interchange at the southern terminus of SH-112, which is also the northern terminus of the Poteau Bypass. The two concurrent roads head north through the towns of Shady Point and Panama. North of Panama, US-59 and US-271 form the eastern terminus of SH-31. At Sunset Corner, US-59 turns to the west and US-271 turns to the east, ending the concurrency. SH-9 passes straight through this intersection from west to east; upon turning west, US-59 follows SH-9 for , splitting away southeast of Cowlington. Just north of this junction, US-59 widens to a four-lane divided highway. It crosses the Arkansas River on a bridge just downstream of the dam that impounds Robert S. Kerr Reservoir. Upon crossing the river, the highway enters Sequoyah County.|$|E

40|$|Att köra eller inte köra is a {{qualitative}} study aiming {{to show how}} environmentally conscious people who utilizes cars deal with their dissonant behavior, but at the sametime maintain an identity as environmentally conscious.

The study investigates inner obstacles in the form of habits and lifestyle, but also the different strategies <b>the</b> <b>motorists</b> use to reduce their cognitive dissonance and maintain a green identity. The indicators show that the reason the majority of <b>the</b> <b>motorists</b> continue to utilize cars is part due to inner obstacles (it's adeeply rooted habit, but also a big part of their lifestyles), part due to that the individuals have defenses for their use of their cars, defenses designed to have a dissonance reducing effect. The indicators also show that <b>the</b> <b>motorists</b> value their family higher than the environment, and in this way they can legitimize many of their car uses. The study finds hints suggesting that <b>the</b> <b>motorists</b> associate good parenting with using cars and therefore risk another type of dissonance linked to parenthood if they should stop using cars. The majority of <b>the</b> <b>motorists</b> in <b>the</b> study have grown up in a rural environment suggesting that the car is a big part of a norm system linked to the motorists' cultural background, which in it self could be an explanation for why the individuals associate good parenting with the use of cars...|$|R

25|$|This {{new type}} of {{variable}} assist power steering has since spread throughout the vehicle population.

Thus the car turns easily at low speed, emphasized by high gearing given two turns lock-lock, and relatively more effort is required at higher speed.|$|E
25|$|A {{civilian}} {{and a police}} officer were killed in riot in September 1969, which broke out in response to accusation of police brutality. Two years later, public disorder returned with widespread riots in August 1971, {{following the death of}} a Puerto Rican motorist at the hands of white police officers. When the officers were not charged, Hispanic residents took to the streets and called for the suspension of those involved. The officers were ultimately charged, but remained on the job and tensions soon flared. On the night of August 19, 1971, riots erupted, and sections of downtown were looted and torched over the next three days. Fifteen major fires were set before order was restored, and ninety people were injured. City officials ended up suspending the officers {{responsible for the death of}} <b>the</b> <b>motorist,</b> but they were later acquitted by a jury.|$|E

25|$|However, {{a seizure}} that is {{justified}} at its inception may become unreasonable {{if it is}} unreasonably prolonged in duration.

And if a drug-sniffing dog is used during this unreasonable extension, {{the use of the}} dog violates the Fourth Amendment. The Illinois Supreme Court reasoned that using the dog changed the character of the encounter from a routine traffic stop to a drug investigation, and that transformation had to be supported by reasonable suspicion. The Supreme Court instead reasoned that the dog sniff does not change the character of an encounter unless the dog sniff invaded any of the citizen's other reasonable expectations of privacy. The Court concluded it did not.|$|E
25|$|Traditional cycle lanes {{increase}} vehicle/bicycle collisions. When exiting, a motorist {{must look}} ahead to avoid colliding with another vehicle or with pedestrians on a crosswalk. As the intersection curves away from the exit, the path of an exiting vehicle is relatively straight, and so <b>the</b> <b>motorist</b> may often not slow substantially. To {{give way to a}} cyclist on the outside, requires the exiting motorist to look toward the rear, to the perimeter. Other vehicles can obstruct the driver's view in this direction, complicating the motorist's task. The more frequent requirements for motorists to slow or stop reduce traffic flow. A 1992 study found that the risk to cyclists is high in all such intersections, but much higher when the junction has a marked bicycle lane or sidepath around its perimeter. Cycle lanes were installed at St. John's roundabout in Newbury, Berkshire, England and at Museum Road, Portsmouth, England. The cycle lanes at Museum Road were replaced by a narrowed carriageway to encourage lane sharing, while the St. John's roundabout retains perimeter cycle lanes.|$|E

It is estimated that as a result the Treasury is now distributing £40 million less in Road Safety Grant than is raised from fines in the year. Dorset and Essex announced plans to review camera provision with a view to possibly ending the scheme in their counties, however Dorset strongly affirmed its support for the scheme, albeit reducing financial contributions in line with the reduction in government grant. Seven counties also announced plans to turn off some or all of their cameras, amidst warnings from the country's most senior traffic policeman that this would result in an increase in deaths and injuries. Gloucestershire cancelled plans to update cameras and has reduced or cancelled maintenance contracts.|$|E
