5|$|A special Mars rover {{model was}} built for the filming; the movie cast and team {{presented}} <b>the</b> <b>rover</b> model to Jordan {{in return for the}} hospitality they had received. <b>The</b> <b>rover</b> is now exhibited in Jordan's Royal Automobile Museum.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Rover</b> {{section is}} open to any young adults {{between the ages of}} 18 and 30. <b>The</b> <b>Rover</b> {{programme}} focuses on their motto of 'Service', which has 3 aspects - service to the community, service to the Scout Movement and service to oneself. Rovers are not necessarily adult leaders of Scout Troops, although there is often some overlap. <b>The</b> <b>Rover</b> section has historically been open to young men and women, even prior to Cubbing and Scouting being opened to girls.|$|E

50|$|On Fred's death {{his entire}} assets, {{including}} <b>The</b> <b>Rovers</b> Return, are inherited by his surviving son Ashley. Fred {{had planned to}} sell <b>The</b> <b>Rovers</b> to Steve, but died before completing the sale. Like his father, Ashley is a butcher with no real interest in being landlord and decides to sell <b>The</b> <b>Rovers</b> to Steve as his father had planned.|$|R

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Rovers</b> is a 1980 album by {{the music}} group <b>The</b> Irish <b>Rovers.</b> It was their first album after they rebranded {{themselves}} as <b>The</b> <b>Rovers,</b> dropping [...] "Irish" [...] from the group name, and includes their crossover country hit [...] "Wasn't That a Party".|$|R
5|$|Within {{three months}} of joining a Rover Crew a {{newcomer}} may be invested as a Squire. Alternatively, a Scout wishing to join <b>the</b> <b>Rover</b> Crew upon their 18th birthday, may complete <b>the</b> <b>Rover</b> Network Badge. If the newcomer was not previously a Scout, {{he or she must}} first be invested as a Scout and must take the Scout Promise. The Squire then chooses a mentor, called a Sponsor, from one of the existing Rovers; the Sponsor's task is to guide the Squire in learning all the necessary Scouting skills and to aid the Squire in performing a service project as set out by <b>the</b> <b>Rover</b> Crew. Once the service project is completed the Squire can be invested as a fully fledged Rover.|$|E
5|$|Aside from <b>the</b> <b>rover</b> and its {{bridging}} kits, Jetman {{has access}} to three other pieces of equipment, {{all of which can}} be carried on the bonnet of <b>the</b> <b>rover,</b> albeit one at a time. Bombs must be used to destroy alien bases when they are encountered, which can only be accomplished when Jetman is flying above them. Another piece of equipment is a cannon that may be mounted onto the rear side of the moon rover. The final piece of equipment is a pair of teleporters which can be used to instantaneously transport the player to the teleporter's twin, thus allowing rapid transport around the moon.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, <b>the</b> <b>Rover</b> Hendrix act break joke {{has been}} {{called one of the}} worst jokes in The Simpsons history by the writers and producers. In 2007, Simon Crerar of The Times listed the Smashing Pumpkins' and Cypress Hill's {{performances}} among the 33 funniest cameos {{in the history of the}} show. Andrew Martin of Prefix Mag named Cypress Hill his sixth-favorite musical guests on The Simpsons out of a list of ten.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> Range <b>Rover</b> was {{launched}} in 1970 by British Leyland. This flagship model {{is now in its}} fourth generation. Jaguar Land <b>Rover</b> has expanded <b>the</b> use of <b>the</b> Land <b>Rover</b> Range Rover sub-brand to include <b>the</b> Range <b>Rover</b> Evoque, <b>the</b> Range <b>Rover</b> Velar and <b>the</b> Range <b>Rover</b> Sport.|$|R
25|$|In 2004, Land Rover {{launched}} another model under <b>the</b> Range <b>Rover</b> brand – <b>the</b> Range <b>Rover</b> Sport, {{which was}} based on <b>the</b> Land <b>Rover</b> Discovery platform, but <b>the</b> new Range <b>Rover</b> Sport has <b>the</b> latest Range <b>Rover</b> platform.|$|R
60|$|In {{the crowd}} was Bill Glutts, but he took care to keep away from <b>the</b> <b>Rovers.</b> Gabe Werner {{was nowhere to be}} seen, and <b>the</b> <b>Rovers</b> {{rightfully}} conjectured that he had left the town.|$|R
5|$|After filming ended, {{one of the}} {{original}} Minis was sold to Kariker Kars to be hired for various events, whereupon it was then temporarily displayed as a major attraction at <b>the</b> <b>Rover</b> Group's museum. In 1997, it was purchased by the Cars of the Stars Motor Museum and displayed for a while, later being sold on to a private buyer in the United States. One other is privately owned and nearing the end of a restoration in the south of England. A replica— the one used to promote the animated series— is on display at National Motor Museum, Beaulieu.|$|E
5|$|Alongside his {{television}} and film roles, Bathurst {{has developed a}} theatre career. He appeared in several Cambridge Footlights Revues between 1977 and 1981, and co-directed the 1978 Footlights pantomime with Martin Bergman. From his first professional stage role playing Tim Allgood in Michael Frayn's Noises Off (1983), Bathurst has starred in Judgement (1987), Getting Married (1993), The Nose (1995), <b>The</b> <b>Rover</b> (1996), Alarms and Excursions (1998–1999), The Three Sisters (2003), Whipping it Up (2006, 2007), Present Laughter (2010), and Blithe Spirit (2010, 2011).|$|E
5|$|At {{the first}} tournament in 1920, {{there were many}} {{differences}} from the modern game: games were played outdoors on natural ice, forward passes were not allowed, the rink (which had been intended to be used only for figure skating) was 56m×18m (165ft×58.5ft) and two 20-minute periods were played. Each team had seven players on the ice, the extra position being <b>the</b> <b>rover.</b> Following the tournament, the IIHF held a congress and decided to adopt the Canadian rules—six men per side and three periods of play.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} <b>the</b> development ofadvanced <b>rover</b> {{navigation and}} manipulation techniques {{for use by}} NASA's Sample Return Rover. These techniques include an algorithm for estimating the change in <b>the</b> <b>rover's</b> position and orientation by registering successive range maps from <b>the</b> <b>rover's</b> hazard avoidance stereo camera pair and the fusion of this information with <b>the</b> <b>rover's</b> wheel odometry. This map registration technique is also extended to register range maps to an a priori model-based range map for relative rover position and orientation determination. Finally, a technique for the robust and precise positioning of arover-mounted manipulator using visual feedback from <b>the</b> <b>rover's</b> stereo pair is presented. Experimental results {{for each of these}} techniques is documented in this paper...|$|R

50|$|After the {{break-up}} {{of her marriage}} to Nick Tilsley (Adam Rickett), Leanne Battersby (Jane Danson) moves into <b>The</b> <b>Rovers</b> with Natalie. <b>The</b> <b>Rovers</b> is robbed on New Year's Day 2000 after Leanne falls into debt with drug dealer Jez Quigley (Lee Boardman) over her cocaine addiction. <b>The</b> <b>Rovers</b> robbery leaves Leanne hospitalised, and after she confesses to Natalie, Natalie agrees to support her, and seeks help for her with a drug counsellor.|$|R
5|$|Number Six, who {{is trapped}} on the Island for inventing the {{bottomless}} peanut bag, tells Homer about a makeshift boat he spent thirty-three years making, which Homer steals and escapes the Island with, popping <b>the</b> <b>Rover</b> {{that emerged from}} the water to trap him. When he gets home, Homer tries to send out a message to the police through his computer, but is stopped by Number Two taking over the computer and is caught by his doppelgänger.|$|E
5|$|Watney takes <b>the</b> <b>rover</b> to {{retrieve}} the nearby Pathfinder probe, which fell silent in 1997. Using the lander's camera, he establishes rudimentary communication with Earth, first with plastic bin lids, and then using hexadecimals. NASA instructs Watney to partially modify the rover's code to link with Pathfinder so they can communicate via text. Watney becomes angry when he learns that the crew has not been told of his survival (and openly expresses it), and Sanders reluctantly lets Henderson finally inform them.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Rover</b> 75 is an {{executive}} car produced by British automobile manufacturers Rover Group {{and later by}} MG Rover, under <b>the</b> <b>Rover</b> marque. <b>The</b> <b>Rover</b> 75 was available with front-wheel drive in either a saloon or estate body style and latterly, in long-wheelbase form and a rear-wheel drive, V8-engined specification. In 2001, an MG-branded version was launched by MG Rover, called the MG ZT.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Rovers</b> Return {{occupies}} {{a corner of}} Coronation Street and Rosamund Street. The pub was built by the fictional brewery Newton and Ridley. <b>The</b> <b>Rovers</b> Return Inn has been a free house since 1996, although the brewery continues to supply it. The name comes from <b>the</b> <b>Rover's</b> Return in Withy Grove, Manchester, a 14th-century building which became a licensed house at some point but ceased to be so in 1924 and was demolished in 1958.|$|R
50|$|Once <b>the</b> <b>Rovers</b> was renovated and refurbished, Bet pinned an electrician's number up on {{the board}} telling Jack to call upon the {{services}} of a professional, as they had <b>the</b> <b>Rovers</b> back, and she intended on keeping it.|$|R
50|$|Launched in 2003 it {{contained}} two separate <b>rovers</b> <b>the</b> Spirit <b>rover</b> and <b>the</b> Opportunity <b>rover.</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>rover</b> has an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) that {{provides}} 3-axis information on its position, {{which is used}} in rover navigation. The rover's computers are constantly self-monitoring to keep <b>the</b> <b>rover</b> operational, such as by regulating the rover's temperature. Activities such as taking pictures, driving, and operating the instruments are performed in a command sequence that is sent from the flight team to <b>the</b> <b>rover.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>rover</b> ran {{during the}} lunar day, {{stopping}} occasionally to recharge its batteries via the solar panels. At night <b>the</b> <b>rover</b> hibernated {{until the next}} sunrise, heated by the radioisotope heater unit.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Rover</b> SD1 is {{both the}} code name and {{eventual}} production name given {{to a series of}} executive cars built by British Leyland (BL), under <b>the</b> <b>Rover</b> marque. It was produced through its Specialist, Rover Triumph and Austin Rover divisions from 1976 until 1986, when it was replaced by <b>the</b> <b>Rover</b> 800. The SD1 was marketed under various names. In 1977 it won the European Car of the Year title.|$|E

50|$|Stella, <b>The</b> <b>Rovers</b> Return's manageress and licensee, {{is offered}} first refusal and, {{while she is}} {{interested}} in buying the pub, her partner Karl Munro (John Michie) is reluctant, although he soon warms to the idea. After an application for a mortgage is approved, Stella and Karl buy <b>The</b> <b>Rovers</b> outright. Karl and Stella are happy being the new landlord and landlady for a while, but Karl becomes irritated {{at the amount of}} work he has to put in at <b>The</b> <b>Rovers.</b> In 2012, Karl begins an affair with barmaid Sunita Alahan (Shobna Gulati). When Stella finds out about the affair, she sacks Sunita and throws Karl out, demanding that he sign his half of <b>The</b> <b>Rovers</b> over to her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, {{how do you}} do?" [...] said Minnie, {{coming up}} with a smile on her face. [...] "How strange to meet out here!" [...] And then she shook hands with each of <b>the</b> <b>Rovers,</b> and speedily {{introduced}} her friends, and <b>the</b> <b>Rovers</b> introduced Songbird.|$|R
25|$|Lunokhod 2 was {{equipped}} with three slow-scan television cameras, one mounted high on <b>the</b> <b>rover</b> for navigation, which could return high resolution images at different rates3.2, 5.7, 10.9 or 21.1 seconds per frame (not frames per second). These images were used by the five-man team of controllers on Earth who sent driving commands to <b>the</b> <b>rover</b> in real time. There were four panoramic cameras mounted on <b>the</b> <b>rover.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Rover</b> 75 and its MG twin, the ZT, {{compared}} favourably against contemporary {{rivals in}} terms of emissions. Each engine fitted to <b>the</b> <b>Rover</b> and MG flagships were analysed and given a score between 0 (cleanest) to 100 (dirtiest) by Next Green Car.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Rover</b> 75 was {{unveiled}} {{to the public}} at the 1998 Birmingham Motor Show, with deliveries commencing in February 1999. Production of <b>the</b> <b>Rover</b> and later MG badged models ceased on 8 April 2005 when manufacturer MG Rover Group entered administration.|$|E
