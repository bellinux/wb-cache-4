In English clauses with a verb in the passive voice, for instance, the topic is typically the subject, while the agent may be omitted or may follow the preposition by.

The collected data are taken from Barack Obama’s speeches in his press conferences on January 14 th and October 8 th 2013. The collected data are analyzed based on the theory of Systemic Functional Grammar put forward by Halliday. The method and technique used in this study are an analytic descriptive. This descriptive research finds (1) two kinds of <b>theme-rheme</b> pattern; namely; simple <b>theme-rheme</b> patterns and multiple <b>theme-rheme</b> patterns. The simple <b>theme-rheme</b> patterns contain constant theme pattern, linear theme or zig-zag pattern, and derived <b>theme-rheme</b> pattern, and the multiple ones contain combination of constant theme and constant rheme, combination of constant and linear theme, combination of split and constant themes and another pattern is proposed by the researcher himself, namely derived rheme. The findings show that (2) the combination of constant and linear theme patterns is distributed most in both press conferences. In the contrary, combination of constant and split theme is only found once. To sum up, thematic structure can be used in developing of a text and making the message easily to be understood.

The investigation was inspired by Halliday and Matthiessen (2014), Eggins (2004), and Emilia (2012). In writing process, students are not aware the roles of theme-rheme; they usually tend in writing text production though <b>theme-rheme</b> system affect in their ideas presentation. If {{they are aware of}} that roles, it will help them to present their ideas effectively. This study aimed on how <b>theme-rheme</b> system are realized by EFL learners in their argumentative essays as the flow of and to find out the information flow of discourse in EFL learners’ argumentative essays at English Langauge Teaching Department of Syekh Nurjati State Islamic Institute Cirebon. In term of argumentative essay, this is created by learners based on the article from Eben Kirksey under the title “Don’t use your data as a pillow. ” Therefore, the technique of qualitative method is used to collect and identify the data or text. In addition, Frankle and Wallen (2009 : 419) declared that the qualitative method addresses observation, interviewing and content analysis. In conducting this research, researcher identified the selected text through content analysis design because the research used texts to be identified and linguistics perspectives as the approach. According to Given (2008 : 120) stated that content analysis is chosen because it is about research method to identify texts addresses the transcript of interview, speeches, text and other. The result of study reveals that EFL learners tend to use different ways in presenting the information in texts. First, in three selected texts, writers are able to apply three types of <b>theme-rheme</b> system, which are topical, interpersonal and ideational themes. Then, topical theme are prominent used to express ideational meaning which content is densely in nominal construction. It highly proved by in unmarked theme, nominal group is prominent than others. As Halliday and Matthiessen (2014 : 728) stated that “nominal group is the primary resource used by the grammar for packing lexical items at high density. ” Second, researcher captured from second research findings about information flow of discourse created through thematic progression and higher level themes. From those way, {{it can be seen that}} three selected texts used higher level theme and three ways of thematic progression in presenting their information. However, its result was the two selected texts are not appropriate with the argumentative essay as the genre that readers expected.

The result of the analysis of the thematic progression pattern showed that the linear and constant themes are prevalent in business news report, though the constant theme is the predominant. These two patterns are reflective of the features of narrative writing task of which news reporting is an aspect.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to show how modal {{particles}} can be integrated into a modular description of language where grammar and pragmatics are seen as two independent but interacting modules. The modular approach is chosen because of the problems connected with a functional approach. On the syntactic level, {{it is assumed that}} modal particles are XPs. The fact that modal particles cannot occur alone in the initial field of a clause has, presumably, semantic-pragmatic reasons. It is also argued that the many positions possible for modal particles in a clause can be accounted for by assuming that they are generated in one special position in the (theoretical) syntactic structure, namely as adjuncts to the highest VP, and that other constituents may move past them for information structural reasons {{that have to do with}} the interaction of the grammatical focus-background structure and the pragmatic <b>theme-rheme</b> structure. In the light of the differences between the various occurrences of the words ja, doch and schon, modal particles are regarded as a category of their own, separated from categories such as adverbs, focus particles and sentence equivalents. On the semantic level, it is shown that the modular approach makes it possible to minimalistically assume one semantic form per modal particle, irrespective of stress. In the case of the modal particles ja, doch and schon, it is argued that they are non-referential and non-attitudinal. It is suggested that, in view of their common feature, ‘affirmative 1, they be analysed as expressions of facticity. They are represented by an operator in a duality group based on the operator FAKT. The meaning is compositionally integrated into the meaning of a clause at the level of semantic form, where it takes scope over the proposition [e INST p]. It interacts with other modal particles and sentence adverbials, the order of which shows the scope relations. Finally, on the pragmatic level, it is maintained that there is no inherent connection between modal particles and the focus-background structure or the <b>theme-rheme</b> structure. Moreover, modal particles do not even seem to be included in the <b>theme-rheme</b> structure. However, they take part in the focus-background structure and may be focussed themselves. The functions of modal particles are derived from their meaning in interaction with the illocutionary force or the sentence mood, the Principle of Relevance, and stress. The functions thus derived are a strengthening or a weakening effect on assertions, the triggering of implicatures, and the indication of the type of relation between the utterance concerned and the context...|$|E

In example 15, ‘The United States’ function as the Theme and present New information. The information sequence in examples 14 and 15 is marked: unknown information is presented first followed by known information. The rhematic elements in both examples are known and predicted from previous reports. What the readers of these reports may not know is the party behind this accusation; whether it is the United Nations’ investigation team, the majority of the Lebanese people, the Lebanese authority, Hariri’s Future party or the United States. The United States justifies its accusations in the CNN English report by claiming to possess ‘new leads’ and ‘growing evidence’ to incriminate Syria, as is mentioned in the CNN English report. These leads are not elaborated upon and no real evidence is presented to support the United States’ accusation. The choices of <b>Theme-Rheme</b> and Given-New information in the CNN examples suggest that while the Arabic report presents the allegations against Syria in terms of a long-time opposition to the Syrian government possibly by Hariri’s political party, the English report presents the US accusation in terms of ‘evidence’, ‘mounting leads’ and ‘well-established facts’. The analysis indicates that the choices made in the CNN English report are most likely to assert the readers’ belief in Syria as a culprit of Hariri’s murder, whereas, the ones made in the CNN Arabic version are less likely to emphasize this connection and belief. Examples 14 and 15 demonstrate the relationship between <b>Theme-Rheme</b> and Given-New structures and the management of information to construct specific ideological representations of Syria in the news.|$|E

These elements are neither predicted nor mentioned in previous reports. The choice and organization of clausal and information elements in the Arabic headlines have a strong potential to strengthen the readers’ belief in Syria as an unlikely suspect in Hariri’s murder. The analysis of the unmarked information structure and the choice of certain linguistic terms as Given or New information strongly suggest a positive representation of Syria in the Arabic headlines.

The effect of dialect is complex: a) only in non-contrastive contexts produced with a high rheme accent Southerners align peaks later than Northerners; b) peak delay as a means to signal functional contrast is not used uniformly by the two varieties.
