The <b>trial</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> defendants, falsely and absurdly accused of collaboration with the Nazis, was watched by British and American diplomats without protest. The absence of the expected death sentences was their relief. The exiled government in London, after Mikołajczyk's resignation led by Tomasz Arciszewski, ceased to be officially recognized by Great Britain and the United States on 5 July 1945.|$|E

He said the company resolved over 500 complaints and added a disclaimer on the website clarifying the misconception.|$|E
