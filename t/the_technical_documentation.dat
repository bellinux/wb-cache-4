These often cause unnecessary overlapping and manual work, and make technical communication between different actors in the project inefficient.

40|$|<b>Technical</b> <b>documentation</b> {{has moved}} from printed {{booklets}} to electronic versions {{that need to be}} updated continuously to match product development and user demands. There is an imminent need to ensure <b>the</b> quality of <b>technical</b> <b>documentation,</b> i. e., information that follows a product. In order to ensure <b>the</b> quality of <b>technical</b> <b>documentation,</b> {{it is important to be}} able to measure it in a constructive way. In this paper, we approach quality from a software quality perspective and rely on automated measurements and analyses. It is generally not possible to assess quality attributes such as “ease of understanding ” using automated measurements. To assess such quality attributes, we suggest the use of visualizations as a communication medium between the machine results and technical writers, and define a visualization-based quality assessment approach for <b>technical</b> <b>documentation.</b> In order to test our approach, we use it to assess the quality of 3 real-world documentations from a Swedish mobile phone manufacture, a Japanese camera manufacturer, and a Swedish warship producer. The study shows that our approach can be used to identify potential quality defects. For example, we tested an unclassified subset of <b>the</b> warship’s <b>technical</b> <b>documentation</b> and found that 49 % of it was redundant text clones. We performed the study in collaboration with a Swedish company that is in charge of creating and maintaining the 3 documentations, and they acknowledge that our approach has great potential and that our results proved helpful to them...|$|R
