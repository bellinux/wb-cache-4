25|$|It is {{said that}} in Myra the relics of Saint Nicholas each year exuded a clear watery liquid which smells like rose water, called manna (or myrrh), which is {{believed}} by the faithful to possess miraculous powers. After the relics were brought to Bari, they continued <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so,</b> <b>much</b> to {{the joy of the}} new owners. Vials of myrrh from his relics have been taken all over the world for centuries, and can still be obtained from his church in Bari. Even up to the present day, a flask of manna is extracted from the tomb of Saint Nicholas every year on 6 December (the Saint's feast day) by the clergy of the basilica. The myrrh is collected from a sarcophagus which is located in the basilica vault and could be obtained in the shop nearby. The liquid gradually seeps out of the tomb, but it is unclear whether it originates from the body within the tomb, or from the marble itself; since the town of Bari is a harbour, and the tomb is below sea level, there have been several natural explanations proposed for the manna fluid, including the transfer of seawater to the tomb by capillary action.|$|E
500|$|Eric Goldman of IGN {{scored the}} season a 7.9 out of 10, feeling it [...] "had its up and downs, mixing in {{elements}} that worked (Daisy getting her Quake on, the Fitz and Simmons drama), elements {{we could have}} used more of (Secret Warriors!) and elements that just never felt right (Lincoln and his relationship with Daisy)." [...] Goldman also felt that {{the first half of}} the season was [...] "the stronger, more cohesive of the two halves" [...] as it aired the episode [...] "4,722 Hours" [...] which Goldman called [...] "the best hour of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. to date." [...] He criticized the pacing of the season, saying [...] "some episodes felt a bit jumbled and could have benefited from slowing down a bit—or simply not trying <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> at once. Sometimes it was just a question of including too many characters or storylines in single episodes, causing some scenarios to not have time to breathe or get the proper build up they might have with more character-focused episodes." ...|$|E
500|$|Rakeysh {{said the}} {{following}} in a scriptwriter's conference {{conducted by the}} Film Writers Association in the year 2008, [...] "I was making a documentary called Mamooli Ram, on the missed revolution with Kamalesh Pandey. We were sitting in a small hotel room in Nanded, drinking. We started singing songs, and we both realised we liked similar songs. And so Rang De Basanti was born. He was angry with the system, I was helpless with the system. We wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> <b>much.</b> But we really can't do anything and it {{was born out of}} anger. He wrote a story called Ahuti, meaning sacrifice. Ahuti was about the armed revolution about India, between the years 1919 and 1931. It started with Ashfaqullah Khan, Ramprasad Bismil, Bhagat Singh, Rajguru, went on to Chandrashekhar Azad and so on. We had this amazing screenplay called Ahuti, which we had also termed as The Young Guns of India, which started with a train robbery, Azad on a horse and so on. I said, [...] "let's do The Young Guns of India". We were going to go on the floor, and suddenly {{there were a couple of}} film on Bhagat Singh made. But they came and went. Not because they were good or bad films, not because they were written badly or not written so bad. I'm not being judgmental about them. And this is very important: because they did not reflect the sentiment of today's time. Nobody in the audience could identify with something which was past. It wasn't that there wasn't idea of patriotism in us, but it was sleeping somewhere. And you had to kind of relate to it in today's world. So a couple of bottles of vodka again, and three days later, with couple of vodkas down, Kamlesh ji comes up with 'You know what, I think I've cracked it'." ...|$|E

2500|$|In a 2011 interview, Harry {{said that}} [...] "After {{witnessing}} Elton John and his tireless efforts against HIV/AIDS", {{she had been}} inspired to put philanthropy as her top priority. She said, [...] "These things are important to my life now. I have the privilege {{of being able to}} get involved, so I do.

2500|$|Scholar Victor Kiernan {{writes that}} this {{interpretation}} {{is a perfect}} fit with the English social perspective of Shakespeare's day: [...] "An extension is in progress of a privileged class's assurance of preferential treatment in the next world as in this, to a favoured nation's conviction of having God on its side, of Englishmen being... the new Chosen People". As Elizabethan England was slowly colonising the world, the populace embraced the view of its own Divine Right and Appointment <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so,</b> <b>much</b> as Richard does in Shakespeare's play.|$|E
2500|$|When Green Party leader Elizabeth May {{made the}} {{announcement}} that she would run in Central Nova, then held by Conservative cabinet minister Peter MacKay, local Liberals would [...] "neither confirm nor deny" [...] that they had had discussions with May over ways to unseat MacKay. On March 21, Dion said, [...] "Madame May and I have conversations about how we may work together {{to be sure that}} this government will stop <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> harm to our environment". The speculation was confirmed when Dion and May agreed not to run candidates in each other's ridings.|$|E

2500|$|Also in 1891, Chicago businesswoman Bertha Palmer {{approached}} Cassatt {{to paint}} a 12' × 58' mural about [...] "Modern Woman" [...] for the Women's Building for the World's Columbian Exposition {{to be held in}} 1893. Cassatt completed the project {{over the next two years}} while living in France with her mother. The mural was designed as a triptych. The central theme was titled Young Women Plucking the Fruits of Knowledge or Science. The left panel was Young Girls Pursuing Fame and the right panel Arts, Music, Dancing. The mural displays a community of women apart from their relation to men, as accomplished persons in their own right. Palmer considered Cassatt to be an American treasure and could think of no one better {{to paint a}} mural at an exposition that was <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> to focus the world's attention on the status of women. Unfortunately the mural did not survive following the run of the exhibition when the building was torn down. Cassatt made several studies and paintings on themes similar to those in the mural, so it is possible to see her development of those ideas and images. Cassatt also exhibited other paintings in the Exposition.|$|E
2500|$|... "More Crap" [...] satirizes Irish singer, musician, and philanthropist Bono, {{best known}} for being the main vocalist of the rock band U2. Bono is portrayed as obsessed with being the best at {{everything}} and winning awards, and is criticized for not letting others claim success over him. Stan makes remarks about Bono's wealth and knighthood, {{as well as his}} highly successful band, and his [...] "hot wife", Alison Hewson. The episode also shows Bono in Africa at one point, and makes reference to his numerous accolades, including his 22 Grammy Awards, and his nominations for an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award, and the Nobel Peace Prize. In a joke, Bono is revealed to have first-place trophies in much smaller scale categories as well, such as [...] "most Sports Illustrated subscriptions sold". In the episode, people claim that Bono is both [...] "talented" [...] and [...] "caring", being [...] "able <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> <b>much,</b> try to help so many people", but, despite all of this, he [...] "seem like such a piece of crap". As the plot progresses, this problem is explained when the comparison between Bono and feces moves from metaphorical to literal, as he is revealed to be an actual piece of excrement raised as a human. As such, Bono's obsession with being number one is his way of compensating for being born [...] "" [...] – a euphemism for feces.|$|E

5000|$|Jones became {{well known}} among fans for his [...] "hanky on the head", and his perm.
