Shortly before it enters Wappocomo farm, Big Run flows alongside ledges of gray shale known to contain Chonetes and Camarotoechia fossils. A smaller unnamed stream flows through <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>lawn</b> {{of the house}} at Wappocomo before curving northwest toward its confluence with Big Run. Corn is the primary crop produced in Wappocomo's agricultural fields along the South Branch Potomac River, which consist of rich alluvial soils.|$|E
5|$|In 1881, the {{committee}} from the Discharged Prisoner’s Aid Society asked {{to use the}} building when {{it was not in}} use for discharged female convicts from the prison at Carliol Square (1828–1925) to do laundry work and the Society continued to use it for this purpose until the turn of the century. Between 1882 and 1883 City Road was built over <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>lawn</b> of the Hospital.|$|E
5|$|Caltech {{is home to}} the 1.7-ton, 130-year-old Fleming Cannon. The {{origins and}} exact age of the Fleming Cannon are not known with certainty. It is {{believed}} to have been cast during the Franco-Prussian War era, but completed in 1878 after the war was over. It was then given by the French to the United States where it was re-bored to fit American shells and the carriage constructed, but this work was completed too late for it to see use in the Spanish–American War. The cannon soon became obsolete and was donated to Southwestern Academy in San Marino, California, where it was displayed on <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>lawn</b> starting in 1925. By 1972, the school was seeking to discard the cannon, and a group of Caltech students from Fleming House took possession of the cannon and laboriously restored it to working condition. The cannon was returned to Southwestern in 1975 at the insistence of the Caltech administration, but it was permanently restored to Caltech in 1981. The cannon is one of the few objects at Caltech which is designated as unprankable given its age, fragility, and irreplaceable nature.|$|E

5|$|Filming {{began in}} Wilmington, North Carolina on May 23, 2012 at EUE/Screen Gems Studios, with the working title Caged Heat. Cinematographer John Toll opted {{to for the}} first time in his career work with digital cameras, as he found them more {{convenient}} for a visual effects-heavy production. Toll shot the film primarily on the Arri Alexa camera. From June 4 through June 6, 2012, filming took place in Cary, North Carolina at the Epic Games headquarters and SAS Institute, with a large Christmas tree set up on <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>lawn.</b> A scene was also shot at the Wilmington International Airport. The Port of Wilmington served as a location for the oil tanker in the climactic battle, along with a soundstage recreation of the dock. The crumbling house itself was filmed in a hydraulic-powered giubo platform that could bend and split into two pieces. All the interior footage had practical effects, including debris and explosions, with computer graphics used only to add exteriors and Iron Man's armor.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of the fifth day, the Pokémon News Flash reports on a {{breaking}} news story: a disc containing the unaired fifth episode of Pichu Bros. was dropped and lost by the delivery Magnemite {{on their way to the}} show's broadcasting studio. After obtaining a lamp from a friendly Duskull in <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>lawn,</b> the player takes a bus back to Mt. Snowfall, where the disc was presumed lost. Eastward are the Ruins of Truth, where the stubborn Ghost-type Pokémon Gengar blocks the player's path until it is scared away by the lamp. Inside the Ruins, Pikachu gets stuck inside a statue of the bat-like Pokémon Golbat. Upon being shaken free, the missing disc pops out. The player hands it back to Magnemite, who is waiting sheepishly outside, and heads home to watch the last episode, along with a video called Meowth's Party.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} Halloween (1978), co-written {{and directed}} by John Carpenter, {{tells the story of}} Michael Myers as he stalks and kills teenage babysitters on Halloween night. The film begins with six-year-old Michael (Will Sandin) killing his teenage sister Judith (Sandy Johnson) on Halloween 1963 in the fictional town of Haddonfield, Illinois. He is subsequently hospitalized at Smith's Grove Sanitarium. Fifteen years later, Michael (Nick Castle and Tony Moran) escapes and returns to his hometown where he stalks Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) and her friends as they babysit. The film ends with Michael being shot six times by his psychiatrist, Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence). Halloween II (1981) picks up where the events of Halloween left off. Michael's body is missing from <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>lawn,</b> where he fell when Loomis shot him. Michael follows Laurie to the local hospital, killing everyone who gets between him and Laurie. The story reveals that Laurie is actually Michael's sister: she was given up for adoption as an infant. Michael corners Loomis and Laurie in an operating room, where Loomis causes an explosion as Laurie escapes. Michael, engulfed in flames, stumbles out of the room toward Laurie before finally falling dead.|$|E

5|$|The palace {{building}} {{consists of}} four floors built with timber, mud bricks, clay, and soil mortar. A carved wooden gate that Yabgo Raja Hatim Khan took from a fort in Skardu after conquering most of the Baltistan was erected {{at the entrance of}} the palace. The passage beyond the main gate, which formerly housed a stable, leads to <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>lawn</b> of the palace, which was used by the musical band during festivities in the reign of Yabgo Rajas. The wooden ceiling of the palace is crafted with designs using chisel and paint, without the use of nail. A hall at the top floor that was used as a leisure room overlooks the Karakoram mountain range and the lawns around the palace.

40|$|<b>The</b> American {{suburban}} <b>front</b> <b>lawn</b> is {{a popular}} landscape and national ideal. Often, it is maintained using synthetic and impersonal methods of lawn care. The literature reviewed reveals a polarized response to <b>the</b> American suburban <b>front</b> <b>lawn,</b> including academic criticism and homeowner support. Many experts claim that <b>the</b> American suburban <b>front</b> <b>lawn</b> is ecologically hazardous and socially vapid and call for its replacement. Yet many suburban homeowners steadfastly construct and maintain it, despite negative ecological and social impacts. Both responses are considered and <b>the</b> American suburban <b>front</b> <b>lawn</b> is analyzed negatively (ecological and social impacts) and positively (unique validity, relevance, and benefits) {{in order to understand}} this phenomenon in all its complexity. The question is raised of whether a middle ground is possible. Research conducted attempts to determine whether there is a culturally viable way homeowners can maintain their <b>front</b> <b>lawns</b> that (1) maintains this popular groundcover, (2) maximizes its benefits, and (3) minimizes negative ecological and social impacts. Ultimately, it is posited that <b>the</b> American suburban <b>front</b> <b>lawn</b> can be maintained in its traditional form if new paradigms and practices are adopted. Research is conducted using an eco-anthropological approach. Analysis includes the use of historical, critical, and socio-cultural perspectives. ...|$|R
