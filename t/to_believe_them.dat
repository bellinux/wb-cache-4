25|$|The {{official}} {{position of the}} Holy See {{is that while the}} Holy Office has approved a few apparitions of the Virgin Mary, Roman Catholics at large are not required <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>them.</b> However, many Catholics express belief in Marian apparitions. This has included popes, e.g. four popes, i.e. Pope Pius XII, Pope John XXIII, Pope Paul VI, and Pope John Paul II have supported the Our Lady of Fátima messages as supernatural. Pope John Paul II was particularly attached to Fátima and credited Our Lady of Fátima with saving his life after he was shot in Rome on the Feast Day of Our Lady of Fátima in May 1981. He donated the bullet that wounded him on that day to the Roman Catholic sanctuary at Fátima Portugal.|$|E

25|$|For the {{remainder}} of April, the Confederates, now at 57,000 and under the direct command of Johnston, improved their defenses while McClellan undertook the laborious process of transporting and placing massive siege artillery batteries, which he planned to deploy on May 5. Johnston knew that the impending bombardment {{would be difficult to}} withstand, so began sending his supply wagons in the direction of Richmond on May 3. Escaped slaves reported that fact to McClellan, who refused <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>them.</b> He was convinced that an army whose strength he estimated as high as 120,000 would stay and fight. On the evening of May 3, the Confederates launched a brief bombardment of their own and then fell silent. Early the next morning, Heintzelman ascended in an observation balloon and found that the Confederate earthworks were empty.|$|E

Cao Cao's wife Lady Bian followed her husband and stayed at Meng Ford (孟津; present-day Mengjin County, Henan), while Cao Pi remained in Ye (in present-day Handan, Hebei). Lady Bian fell ill during that time. Lady Zhen became worried when she heard about it and she cried day and night. She constantly sent messengers to inquire her mother-in-law's condition, but refused <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>them</b> when they reported that Lady Bian was getting better, and she became filled with greater anxiety. Lady Bian later {{wrote a letter to}} her, telling her that she had fully recovered, and only then did Lady Zhen's worries disappear. About a year later, when Lady Bian returned to Ye, Lady Zhen rushed to see her mother-in-law and displayed mixed expressions of sadness and joy. Those who were present were all deeply moved by the scene before them. Lady Bian assured Lady Zhen that her illness was not serious and praised her for her filial piety.|$|E

500|$|The {{third season}} was {{initially}} planned to include three separate mysteries {{that would be}} introduced and resolved {{in a series of}} non-overlapping story arcs. Thomas realized by talking to CW Entertainment President Dawn Ostroff that viewers got too confused by his original format, and the new format would allow new viewers to start watching at any point in the season. Inspired by the improvised thriller Bubble, Thomas started laying [...] "subtle" [...] motives for the second mystery during the first one, so that fans would have [...] "a theory on whodunit" [...] when it occurred. The first mystery took place over the first nine episodes. Originally, the second mystery was to be seven episodes long and the third mystery was to occur over the last six episodes of the season. This was changed when The CW ordered a 20 episode season instead of the usual 22 episodes. The second mystery arc was shortened from seven episodes to six, and the third mystery was first changed from a six episode arc to a five episode arc. After an eight-week hiatus for the series was announced, the final mystery was changed to five stand-alone episodes designed to be friendlier to new viewers. The final mystery was originally going to be [...] "unlike any of the others we've done before". Previously, [...] "nice characters" [...] like Wallace and Mac had always been absent from the big mystery because no one was going <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>them</b> as a suspect. For the third mystery, Thomas had wanted to present a situation where Wallace and Mac could be fully involved, [...] "key players [...] really interesting stuff to do".|$|E

5000|$|In the United States, {{prior to}} the 1930s rape was {{considered}} a sex crime that was always committed by men and always done to women. From 1935-1965, a shift from labeling rapists as criminals <b>to</b> <b>believing</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> be mentally ill [...] "sexual psychopaths" [...] began making its way into popular opinion.

In the final analysis the question is whether we believe their testimony or not. I choose <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>them,</b> and not out of prudery, but because in those days people saw premarital sexual relations, especially as applies to Spielrein, differently than we do today; moreover, because unconsummated sexual desire was even more poignant and more romantic than consummated sex. However, the sexual myth dies hard, providing sensational material for a number of theatrical productions and a plethora of articles in the popular press and professional journals.|$|E

[...] Critics suggested that the children or their parents had deceived him, {{that he was too}} willing <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>them,</b> and that he had asked them leading questions.

Guderian in turn presented the intelligence results to Adolf Hitler, who refused <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>them,</b> dismissing the apparent Soviet strength as [...] "the greatest imposture since Genghis Khan". Guderian had proposed to evacuate the divisions of Army Group North trapped in the Courland Pocket to the Reich via the Baltic Sea to get the necessary manpower for the defence, but Hitler forbade it. In addition, Hitler commanded that one major operational reserve, the troops of Sepp Dietrich's 6th Panzer Army, be moved to Hungary to support Operation Frühlingserwachen.|$|E
