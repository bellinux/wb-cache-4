25|$|Prey {{animals in}} India include chital, sambar, muntjac, mouse deer, swamp deer, wild boar, gaur, water buffalo, banteng, cattle, nilgai, goats, Indian hares, Himalayan field rats and langurs. There is one {{record of a}} pack {{bringing}} down an Indian elephant calf in Assam, despite desperate defense of the mother resulting in numerous losses to the pack. In Kashmir, they prey on markhor, and <b>thamin</b> in Myanmar, Malayan tapir, Sumatran serow in Sumatra and Malay Peninsula, and Javan rusa in Java. In the Tien Shan and Tarbagatai Mountains, dholes prey on Siberian ibexes, arkhar, roe deer, maral and wild boar. In the Altai and Sayan Mountains, they prey on musk deer and reindeer. In eastern Siberia, they prey on roe deer, Manchurian wapiti, wild pig, musk deer, and reindeer, while in Primorye they feed on sika deer and goral, too. In Mongolia, they prey on argali and rarely Siberian ibex. Like African wild dogs, but unlike wolves, dholes are not known to attack people. Dholes eat fruit and vegetable matter more readily than other canids. In captivity, they eat various kinds of grasses, herbs and leaves, seemingly for pleasure rather than just when ill. In summertime in the Tien Shan Mountains, dholes eat large quantities of mountain rhubarb. Although opportunistic, dholes have a seeming aversion to hunting cattle and their calves. Livestock predation by dholes {{has been a problem}} in Bhutan since the late 1990s, as domestic animals are often left outside to graze in the forest, sometimes for weeks at a time. Livestock stall-fed at night and grazed near homes are never attacked. Oxen are killed more often than cows, probably because they are given less protection.|$|E

5000|$|For {{protection}} of the <b>thamin</b> subspecies of the Eld's deer, Chatthin Wildlife Sanctuary and Shwesettaw Wildlife Sanctuary (both protected sanctuaries) and Alaungdaw Kathapa National Park were chosen. Chatthin Wildlife Sanctuary, with an area of 104 mi2 km2 in Myanmar's central plains, 125 mi2 km2 northwest {{of the city of}} Mandalay, has Indaing deciduous broadleaf forest dominated by Dipterocarpus tuberculatus and is the habitat for four species of deer: <b>thamin,</b> muntjac (Muntiacus muntjac), hog deer (Cervus porcinus), and sambhar (Cervus unicolor). Subject to indiscriminate hunting in the past (till the ownership of guns was controlled after the 1960s), the <b>thamin,</b> highly threatened, now has a population of about 1,000. Initially, the Smithsonian National Zoo acquired a few <b>thamin</b> for observations and subsequently shifted a few to its Conservation and Research Center at Front Royal, Virginia for biological study.For a cross - check of the biological studies done at the research center, the Smithsonian Institution selected the Chatthin Wildlife Sanctuary, a protected park. Special studies on the <b>thamin</b> deer were conducted by the conservation scientists headed by Christen Wemmer of the Smithsonian. They gathered details on the biology and survival of the species by duly correlating with the changes that occurred in the ecology of the region of the Chatthin Wildlife Sanctuary. Under the research project study, the ecology of <b>thamin</b> and a series of training courses in biodiversity were organised.

5000|$|The P. e. <b>thamin</b> of Burma and Thailand are not {{associated}} with wetlands and live in three forest types: indaing forest (dominated by the tree Dipterocarpus tuberculatus) equivalent to deciduous dipterocarp forest (dipterocarp trees which belong to the family Dipterocarpaceae are resinous trees found in the Old World tropics) of Indochina and Thailand, deciduous forests of dry (thandahat), and mixed (teak).|$|E
50|$|In over 200 {{recent years}} of known history, {{the number of}} this species has {{declined}} substantially. Based on estimated rates {{of the decline of}} this species assessed in three generations (supposed to be at least a 15-year period) for all the species, the average value is reported to be in excess of 50%. Based on this assessment, IUCN has categorized the species as Endangered. In this assessment for determining the species-level, the numbers in India were considered to be numerically small (also found to be increasing), hence the numbers of wild populations only of Eld's deer P. e. <b>thamin</b> in Myanmar and P. e. siamensis of Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam were considered. The decline in population has been mainly attributed to hunting. In the case of the Myanmar <b>thamin,</b> the decline is discernible but not striking. The categorization is considered a middle-ground situation considering the extensively diverse conditions and conservation trends in the geographically isolated and distinct populations of this species.|$|E

5000|$|Smithsonian National Zoological Park, {{which has}} been closely {{associated}} with the preservation of the <b>thamin</b> deer, has in its conclusive observations stated: [...] "Chatthin Wildlife Sanctuary (CWS) in Myanmar (Burma) protects the largest population of the endangered Eld's deer left in the world. It also represents one of the largest remaining patches of dipterocarp forest - a dry forest {{that is one of the}} most threatened and least protected forest types globally. Local people rely on these forests for their livelihood. The forests provide wood, food, , and medicine. Restricting people's access to these forests by declaring them protected is probably not a sustainable solution and will put greater burden on lower income households potentially increasing poverty. However, if people continue to use and abuse forests unregulated they will disappear and with them the Eld's deer and many other species." ...|$|E
5000|$|They are hunters' {{favourite}} game [...] - [...] as prized game [...] - [...] {{because of}} their impressive antlers and hides that are in demand in the local markets. They are widely hunted for food; they were {{believed to have been}} hunted to feed armies during many Asian wars. Their population has declined due to intense development activities necessitating reclamation of land for grazing, cultivation and fish farming, in all countries. In Burma, deforestion of the diperocarp forests is cited as a reason for the threat faced by the <b>thamin</b> deer. The habitat available for their protection is very limited; only 1% of the protected forests are suitable for its protection in South Asia. Even in protected areas, the animals are poached. Another striking problem is finding adequate funds and political will to protect the species. The species have a fragmented distribution and are therefore at risk from inbreeding and loss of genetic variation.|$|E

40|$|The {{conservation}} of wildlife in the Anthropocene inevitably depends on {{an understanding of}} how human populations interact with wildlife and its habitat. This involves understanding (1) how they exploit the natural resources of a given area, (2) any conflicts they have with wildlife, and (3) their attitudes towards wildlife and its conservation. This study aimed to examine the costs and benefits that local people experienced from living near a protected area (PA) that has been established in central Myanmar to protect one of the last populations of an endangered <b>thamin</b> (Rucervus eldii <b>thamin),</b> and consequently gain insights into how they viewed and responded to their conservation. A questionnaire survey was conducted in nine villages with 209 respondents. The results showed that the people living inside the PA exploited many of the area s natural resources, but also they at the same time suffered many costs associated with conflicts caused by the wildlife in PA. Despite this, they still held positive attitudes towards both <b>thamin</b> and the PA. <b>Thamin</b> was identified as the most common crop raider among the medium-sized wildlife. Communities living inside the PA had better knowledge about PA s operations and to some extent supported the <b>thamin</b> conservation, than those from communities {{along the edge of the}} PA or outside, however the enclaved communities stated that they were less likely to report <b>thamin</b> poaching to the authorities. Illegal <b>thamin</b> hunting is apparently still going on in the area and the local people living within the PA were more aware about the recent <b>thamin</b> population decline than those from the edge or external villages...|$|E

40|$|The Eld’s deer Rucervus eldii once {{distributed}} throughout Southeast Asia extending from northeast India to Indochina and southern China is now confined to small fragmented areas. Four subspecies were identified; R. e. eldii in Manipur, India, R. e. <b>thamin</b> in central plains of Myanmar and western Thailand R. e. siamensis in Lao PDR {{and in the}} northern and eastern Cambodia and a fourth subspecies R. e. hainanus in Hainan’s Island China. The review revealed few molecular investigations have been conducted on the genetics of Eld’s deer based on karyotype analysis, mtDNA and microsatellites. Studies based on mtDNA control region have shown that population of R. e. eldii showed closest relationship with R. e. <b>thamin</b> than to R. e. siamensis. Microsatellites studies are limited to R. e. hainanus; the genetic variability was low suggesting that founder effects and genetic drift have affected the population. There still remain many knowledge gaps in the systematic and genetic status of this species. The population of Eld’s deer suggested ≈ 2165 individuals by 2003 spreading over nine reserves. Population sizes of most subspecies of Eld’s deer are small and threatened due to effects of inbreeding depression, loss of genetic variability and drift.

In future, more research is required to determine the genetic population structure on the basis of markers, variable enough to detect differences between the subspecies.

Computerized simulation modeling, using two endangered species models, the Eld's deer (Cervus eldi <b>thamin)</b> and Pr-zewalski's horse (Equus przewalskii) clearly demonstrated the value of certain sperm storage and use strategies for maintaining genetic diversity in captive populations.
