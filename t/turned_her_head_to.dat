25|$|Helen is safely away {{to recover}} from her concussion. Inspector Morton asks each family member to account for {{themselves}} {{on the day of}} Cora Lansquenet's murder after which Poirot makes a surprising statement which shocked everyone present. Cora had not come to the funeral at all. It was Miss Gilchrist in disguise, as part of a plot for her own gain, leaving Cora home asleep from a sedative in her tea. Miss Gilchrist planted the idea that Richard Abernethie's death had been a murder - when Cora is murdered, it would seem that Richard's alleged murderer had killed Cora to silence her. None of the family had seen Cora for more than two decades, due to the ill-feeling {{at the time of her}} marriage. Miss Gilchrist copied her mannerisms and the only flaw in her portrayal was spotted by Helen Abernethie - Miss Gilchrist had rehearsed a characteristic turn of the head in a mirror, where the reflection is a reverse of reality; when she came to the house after the funeral, she <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> the left, not the right. After a timely conversation among the young cousins, Helen realises this difference. Miss Gilchrist gave herself away to Poirot by referring to the wax flowers on the green malachite table the first day the relatives gathered to select objects before the auction: these were on display on the day of the reading of Richard Abernethie's will but removed by the time Miss Gilchrist, as herself, visited Enderby Hall. She had deliberately poisoned herself with the arsenic-laced wedding cake to evade suspicion and appear yet another potential victim, which aroused suspicion.|$|E
2500|$|The large canvas {{is almost}} square in format and unusually monumental for a beach view. The life-size women {{depicted}} are Sorolla's wife Clotilde and his eldest daughter Maria. Sorolla painted the scenery at the Playa de El Cabanyal beach {{in his hometown}} of Valencia. Both women lean forward slightly, so that they appear to move toward the right edge. While the wife stands straight, aligned to the edge, the daughter Maria has slightly <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> her right shoulder and is looking towards the viewer.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Mortimer <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> Billy, who {{was just}} entering.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll ask him," [...] she replied, <b>turning</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> {{look for}} him. But he and Cassandra were {{absorbed in the}} aye-aye once more.|$|R
6000|$|... 'There, {{they are}} leaving off,' as Arthur led away the pony, and Violet began to ascend the steps, <b>turning</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> look after him.|$|R
60|$|MRS GEORGE. Take me as I am: I ask no more. [She <b>turns</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> {{the study}} door and cries] Yes: come in, come in.|$|R
60|$|Miss Dunross {{laid down}} her pen, and slowly <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> look at me.|$|E
60|$|Razumov smiled amiably {{and moved}} out of her way. She <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> keep her scared eyes on him.|$|E
60|$|As {{they almost}} reached the tank, the {{beautiful}} maiden <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> {{see what the}} poor modest youth was doing.|$|E
60|$|The {{next morning}} the sea moderated greatly and, the wind having gone round to the southeast, the Paramatta {{made the most of}} it, to get west as far as {{possible}} before <b>turning</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> the south.|$|R
60|$|Straight at Pomona {{came the}} great black beast, barking furiously. But the girl did not move; {{she did not}} even <b>turn</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> look at the dog, who stopped before he reached her and began to rush wildly around her, barking terribly.|$|R
6000|$|... [She <b>turns</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> hide <b>her</b> emotion, and withdraws. NAPOLEON [...] {{steps up}} to her, and offers his arm. She takes it silently, and [...] he {{perceives}} the tears on her cheeks. They cross towards the ante- [...] room, {{away from the other}} guests.] ...|$|R
60|$|Grace <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> hide a smile. It {{was obvious}} that he had remembered {{he wanted to go}} to Allerby when he saw her.|$|E
6000|$|The {{absence of}} {{recognition}} may have disconcerted her. She <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> the fire again, {{and it was}} some seconds before she again spoke, and then more rapidly-- ...|$|E
60|$|She <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> him. It was {{the first}} time that they were quite alone, the first time that all thought of danger had become a mere dream.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: [...] Bust of a Bacchante by Augustin Jean Moreau-Vauthier from circa 1891. The {{laughing}} bacchante <b>turns</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> the left. She wears grape {{leaves in}} her hair, which is coiled in back and falls in tresses over her shoulders. This ivory sculpture {{and others like}} it in marble and ivory were displayed in Paris.Walters Art Museum, Baltimore.|$|R
40|$|Photographic {{portrait}} of a female garment worker holding two spools of thread in a pose for the camera, ca. 1940. A woman with curly hair <b>turns</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> the right while looking at the two spools of thread that she holds in her hands. The woman wearing a darkly colored suit jacket is visible {{from the waist up}} while wearing nail polish and dark lipstick...|$|R
5000|$|A Lady Writing a Letter (also {{known as}} A Lady Writing; Schrijvend meisje) is an oil {{painting}} attributed to 17th century Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer. It {{is believed to}} have been completed around 1665. The Lady is seen to be writing a letter and has been interrupted, so gently <b>turns</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> see what is happening. She wears twelve pearls (10 on the necklace and two earrings).|$|R
6000|$|... "Take me with you! I can't {{stay here}} any longer--I shall go crazy!" [...] She <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> listen. [...] "Isn't some one coming? Look out and see! I hear bells!" ...|$|E
60|$|She <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> the Arab {{as though}} in question, and he {{repeated}} the words, whereon she fell into the place that was shown to her between and a little behind the brethren.|$|E
60|$|For just {{a moment}} Tara of Helium looked her surprise; and then she shrugged her {{beautiful}} shoulders as she <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> cast her eyes over one of them at Gahan of Gathol.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, shrink and cringe, sir saint," [...] she sneered. [...] "Having cast me off {{and taken}} up holiness, {{you have the}} right, of course." [...] And with that she moved past me, and down the terrace-steps without ever <b>turning</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> look at me again. And {{that was the last}} I ever saw of her, as you shall find, though little was it to have been {{supposed}} so then.|$|R
60|$|Presently Robert {{made his}} {{appearance}} as {{the bearer of}} Mr. Prendergast's flowers, and setting his back against a shutter, in his favourite attitude, stood looking {{as if he wanted}} to help, but knew not how. Phoebe, at least, was vividly conscious of his presence, but she was supporting a long festoon with which Owen was adorning a pier-glass, and could hardly even <b>turn</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> watch him.|$|R
50|$|The Crouching Venus is a Hellenistic {{model of}} Venus {{surprised}} at her bath. Venus crouches {{with her right}} knee close <b>to</b> the ground, <b>turns</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> the right and, in most versions, reaches her right arm over to her left shoulder to cover her breasts. To judge {{by the number of}} copies that have been excavated on Roman sites in Italy and France, this variant on Venus seems to have been popular.|$|R
60|$|She <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> look at him. He {{was sitting}} a little outside the circle--an {{attitude}} typical, perhaps, {{of his position}} there. The change in her tone was slight indeed, but it was sufficient.|$|E
60|$|Louisa <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> him, {{and bent}} {{it with a}} {{deference}} that was new in her. She looked from him to Rachael, and her features softened. 'What will you do?' she asked him. And her voice had softened too.|$|E
6000|$|The {{girl that}} was going to live in a palace and walk on ground of her own was ready to die with terror. Not for {{anything}} in the world would she have <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> face her sister. Her heart was beating madly. She said with subdued haste-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He startled me," [...] {{repeated}} Heyst. She {{noted the}} anxiety in his tone, and <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> slightly <b>to</b> {{look at him}} across the table.|$|R
5000|$|To {{the left}} of Christ is his mother, Virgin Mary, who <b>turns</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> look down towards the Saved, though her pose also {{suggests}} resignation. It appears that the moment has passed for her to excercise her traditional role of pleading on behalf of souls; with John the Baptist this Deesis is a regular motif in earlier compositions. [...] Preparatory drawings show her standing and facing Christ with arms outstretched, in a more traditional intercessory posture.|$|R
60|$|To her husband, it {{was evident}} that Mimi was ill at ease. The way she kept <b>turning</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> look around <b>her,</b> the quick coming and going of the colour of her face, her hurried breathing, {{alternating}} with periods of suspicious calm, were evidences of mental perturbation. To her, the attitude of Lady Arabella seemed compounded of social sweetness and personal consideration. It would be hard to imagine more thoughtful and tender kindness towards an honoured guest.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] Marian <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> see. At {{that moment}} Lionel's pony {{stepped into a}} hole, stumbled, and when she looked back again, there was Lionel on the ground. Her head swam with fear, but the next moment Lionel {{was on his feet}} and laughing.|$|E
60|$|Bob put {{a period}} to her speech by {{a mark of}} affection to which history affords many {{parallels}} in every age. She said no more about the Black Diamond; but whenever they ascended a hill she <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> look at the lights in Portland Roads, and the grey expanse of intervening sea.|$|E
60|$|She {{had heard}} me in silence, {{and now that}} I had done, she heaved a sigh, for which gentle {{expression}} of pity out of my heart I thanked her. We were silent, thereafter, for a little while. At length she <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> regard me {{in the light of}} the now declining moon.|$|E
60|$|The solitary {{figure who}} walked this beat took no {{notice of the}} windy tune still played on the dead heath-bells. She did not <b>turn</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> look {{at a group of}} dark creatures further on, who fled from her {{presence}} as she skirted a ravine where they fed. They were about a score of the small wild ponies known as heath-croppers. They roamed at large on the undulations of Egdon, but in numbers too few to detract much from the solitude.|$|R
60|$|She {{was obliged}} to kneel down by the sofa, and remain there to satisfy her patient; and thus they {{continued}} a few minutes, when, to her very great satisfaction, she heard some other person crossing the little vestibule. She hoped, on <b>turning</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> <b>to</b> see {{the master of the}} house; but it proved to be one much less calculated for making matters easy--Charles Hayter, probably not at all better pleased by the sight of Captain Wentworth than Captain Wentworth had been by the sight of Anne.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, now," [...] thought I to myself, [...] "it {{is plain}} I must lie where I am and not disturb the balance; {{but it is}} plain also that I can put the paddle over the side {{and from time to}} time, in smooth places, give her a shove or two towards land." [...] No sooner thought upon than done. There I lay on my elbows in the most trying attitude, and every now and again gave a weak stroke or two <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> shore.|$|R
