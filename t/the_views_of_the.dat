While the metsuke-bashira pillar obstructs the view of the stage, the actors are primarily at the corners, not the center, and thus the two aisles are located where <b>the</b> <b>views</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two main actors would be obscured, ensuring a generally clear view regardless of seating.|$|E
5|$|This scheme {{can be seen}} as a {{mechanism}} for representation. First, MPs are chosen by the electorate to represent their concerns and needs in Parliament. Secondly, the Prime Minister, who is vested with the confidence of majority of the MPs, and the Cabinet which is made up of popularly elected MPs, effectively represent <b>the</b> <b>views</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> electorate as he heads the Government. The structure of the executive is therefore based on the concept of political representation.|$|E

In contrast, the high voter turnout rates in every election since then evidenced that Singaporeans have realized this point. With regard to the Taw Cheng Kong case, Shanmugam stated that since the Court's observations were obiter, they were unlikely to be treated as setting a precedent.|$|E
5|$|In {{the general}} election, Bradley carried {{the vote of}} many Gold Democrats.

Democrats were also hurt by economic factors, including the national economic problems and a severe drought in the state. Bradley was elected the first Republican governor of Kentucky, defeating Hardin {{by a vote of}} 172,436 to 163,524. Pettit, the Populist candidate, drew 16,911 votes, most of them from Democrats in western Kentucky. Turnout in the election was 85%. More votes than potential voters were registered in 18 counties, nine of which went for Bradley and nine for Hardin.|$|E

5|$|It had {{now become}} clear to President Johnson that McNamara {{had become a}} {{liability}} to the administration. In February 1968, McNamara resigned his position {{and was replaced by}} Clark Clifford, who was chosen because of his personal friendship with Johnson and his previous opposition to McNamara's suggestions that the number of troops in the South Vietnam be stabilized and that Rolling Thunder be ended. McNamara's position, however was almost immediately taken up by Secretary of State Dean Rusk, (until then an ardent advocate of the bombing campaign). Rusk proposed limiting the campaign to the panhandle of North Vietnam without preconditions and awaiting Hanoi's reaction. Within months Clifford too began to adopt <b>the</b> <b>views</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> man he had replaced, gradually becoming convinced that the U.S. had to withdraw from an open-ended commitment to the war.|$|E
5|$|Process ethics, Palmer argues, {{is closer}} to individualist consequentialism than individualist deontological {{environmental}} ethics. In considering collectivist environmental ethics, Palmer asks how process thinkers could approach natural collectives, such as ecosystems. She argues that Whitehead could view them as single entities with a good of their own, while Hartshorne could not. The primary difference between process ethics and collectivist environmental ethics, however, is that the former has a theological basis. The advocates of deep ecology have previously sought support from the views of Whitehead; two affinities are the shared holism and a shared concern with {{the extension of the}} self, but Palmer finds that the views of Whitehead and <b>the</b> <b>views</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deep ecology advocate Arne Næss differ in these areas.|$|E
5|$|The {{break with}} Rome was not, by itself, a Reformation.

A major manifestation of theological radicalism in England was Lollardy, a movement deriving from the writings of John Wycliffe, the 14th century Bible translator, which stressed the primacy of Scripture. But after the execution of Sir John Oldcastle, leader of the Lollard rebellion of 1415, they never again had access to the levers of power, and by the 15th century were much reduced in numbers and influence.|$|E

5|$|The {{confirmation}} of extraterrestrial intelligence {{could have a}} profound impact on religious doctrines, potentially causing theologians to reinterpret scriptures to accommodate the new discoveries. However, a survey of people with many different religious beliefs indicated that their faith would not be affected by the discovery of extraterrestrial intelligence, and another study, conducted by Ted Peters of the Pacific Lutheran Theological Seminary, shows that most people would not consider their religious beliefs superseded by it. Surveys of religious leaders indicate that only a small percentage are concerned that the existence of extraterrestrial intelligence might fundamentally contradict <b>the</b> <b>views</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> adherents of their religion. Gabriel Funes, the chief astronomer of the Vatican Observatory and a papal adviser on science, has stated that the Catholic Church would be likely to welcome extraterrestrial visitors warmly.|$|E
5|$|The keep {{appears to}} lie on the highest ground in the area, {{although}} this is actually located to the south, within in the deer park. Visitors would have been funnelled {{around the edge of}} the park and by the town wall towards the south gate of the castle, a route dominated by <b>the</b> <b>views</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> keep and tower. The addition of the high tower had made the castle visible to anyone entering from Devon, framing it strikingly against the hills. The keep, park and town walls probably symbolised Richard's authority as earl, and the historian Andrew Saunders has argued that the keep and high tower were also intended to resemble Richard of Cornwall's crown in his role as the King of the Romans.|$|E

5|$|There was {{a boom in}} {{skyscraper}} {{construction in}} Chicago from 1888 onwards. By 1893, Chicago had built 12 skyscrapers between 16 and 20 stories tall, tightly clustered {{in the center of}} the financial district. Chicago's skyscrapers, however, were constrained by the contemporary limits of steel-frame design and the muddy sub-soil in the city, which together limited most of their skyscrapers to around 16 or 17 stories. Chicago's skyscrapers rapidly became tourist destinations for <b>the</b> <b>views</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wider city they provided from their upper floors and as attractive sites in their own right. Tourists were advised to hire cabs for street tours of the skyscrapers – by lying back in the cab, they would be able to safely take in the tops of the tall buildings.|$|E
5|$|Arnold was {{disappointed}} with what XXIBomber Command had achieved, and wanted the Command {{to produce results}} quickly. In addition, Hansell's preference for precision bombing {{was no longer in}} accordance with <b>the</b> <b>views</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Twentieth Air Force headquarters, which wanted a greater emphasis on area attacks. In late December 1944 Arnold decided to relieve Hansell of his command. Seeing LeMay's success in improving XXBomber Command's performance, Arnold thought LeMay could solve the problems at XXIBomber Command, and replaced Hansell with him. Hansell was informed of Arnold's decision on 6January, but remained in his position until mid-January. During this period, XXIBomber Command conducted unsuccessful precision bombing attacks on the Musashino aircraft plant in Tokyo and a Mitsubishi Aircraft Works factory in Nagoya on 9 and 14January respectively. The last attack planned by Hansell was more successful, however: a force of 77 B-29s crippled a Kawasaki Aircraft Industries factory near Akashi on 19January. During XXIBomber Command's first three months of operations, it lost an average of 4.1% of aircraft dispatched in each raid.|$|E

5|$|In Lee Hsien Loong the appellants, {{which were}} in Hong Kong, {{challenged}} {{the jurisdiction of the}} High Court to hear a defamation suit brought by the respondents on the ground, among others, that the service of the writ should have been effected in accordance with the civil procedure convention set down in the Treaty of Judicial Assistance in Civil and Commercial Matters between the Republic of Singapore and the People's Republic of China. Thus, although this was not a judicial review case, the Court had to consider the justiciability of determining whether the treaty applied to Hong Kong, and whether the Court could depart from <b>the</b> <b>views</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> executive branch on the matter which were stated in a letter issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Court held that the present case did not involve the exercise of the sovereign or legislative prerogative in matters of high policy. Rather, it was concerned with the effect, and not the making, of the treaty or whether it was advisable. Thus, the letter from the Ministry was not an exercise of executive prerogative power, but merely a statement of opinion.|$|E

5|$|The vicegerency {{brought the}} pace of reforms {{under the control of}} the king. A balance was instituted between the conservatives and the reformers and this was seen in the Ten Articles, the first attempt at {{defining}} the beliefs of the Henrician Church. The articles had a two-part structure. The first five articles showed the influence of the reformers by recognising only three of the former seven sacraments: baptism, eucharist, and penance. The last five articles concerned the roles of images, saints, rites and ceremonies, and purgatory, and they reflected <b>the</b> <b>views</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> traditionalists. Two early drafts of the document have been preserved and show different teams of theologians at work. The competition between the conservatives and reformers is revealed in rival editorial corrections made by Cranmer and Cuthbert Tunstall, the bishop of Durham. The end product had something that pleased and annoyed both sides of the debate. By 11 July, Cranmer, Cromwell, and the Convocation, the general assembly of the clergy, had subscribed to the Ten Articles.|$|E
