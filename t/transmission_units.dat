The 1972 VAM Javelin saw considerable improvements {{in terms of both}} performance and sportiness. Heavy duty springs and shocks along with front sway bar were passed on to the standard equipment list, as also were power front disk brakes and power steering, all regardless of <b>transmission.</b> <b>Units</b> equipped with the four-speed manual transmission changed to a rear differential gear ratio of 3.31:1 and included a center console with locking compartment as standard equipment. The [...] "Shift-Command" [...] Borg-Warner automatic transmissions were replaced by the new [...] "Torque Command" [...] Chrysler-built A998 TorqueFlite. The chromed grille applied on the tail light lenses and the new rectangular grid front grille of the AMC Javelins arrived for the VAM models. The exterior included for the first time factory stripe designs. The interior saw new seat patterns and a new three-spoke sports steering wheel with an [...] "American Motors" [...] legend on the transparent plastic cap of the horn button. A new steering column design with a built-in safety lever to engage the steering lock came and the mechanism blocking the shifters to ignition switch departed.|$|E

50|$|The {{company was}} founded in 1923 in Antwerp under the name La Mécanique Générale (LMG).

LMG and MGG merged in 1966, and in 1972 it was renamed to Hansen Transmissions International (HTI). From 1979, the company increasingly focused on the supply of gearboxes to the growing wind energy generation sector.|$|E
50|$|It {{was unique}} in {{that not only was}} it one of the first {{transverse}} mounted automatic <b>transmission</b> <b>units</b> tailored for front wheel drive, {{it was one of the}} smallest in order to be used in the transmission-in-sump installation beneath the A-series engine used in the Mini, and later the 1100/1300 ranges. Another novel feature was that the transmission was designed to use the engine's lubricating oil, rather than conventional automatic transmission fluid (ATF). The units were manufactured in a BMC plant in Kings Norton, Birmingham which supplied complete powertrain packages (the unit required a unique engine variant) to the Longbridge and Cowley assembly plants.|$|E
