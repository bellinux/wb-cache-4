25|$|As one of {{the three}} major ports on the West Coast of the United States, the Port of Oakland is the largest seaport on San Francisco Bay and the fifth busiest {{container}} port in the United States. It was {{one of the}} earliest seaports to switch to containerization and to intermodal container transfer, thereby displacing the Port of San Francisco, which never modernized its waterfront. One of the earlier limitations to growth was the inability to transfer containers to rail lines, all cranes historically operating between ocean vessels and trucks. In the 1980s, the Port of Oakland began the evaluation of development of an intermodal container transfer capability, i.e., facilities that now allow <b>trans-loading</b> of containers from vessels to either trucks or rail modes.|$|E

Multi-modal warehouse and trans-load facilities are available. The multi-modal facility {{is located in the}} Gulf Coast Foreign Trade Zone (FTZ) #92 within the industrial park. A <b>trans-loading</b> site is available for other prime sites for bulk transfers and storage of product.|$|E
5000|$|About 1943, the P&F was {{cut back}} to 0.5 miles of track at Franklin Junction and freight was <b>trans-loaded</b> onto P&F trucks for final delivery. The only {{industry}} actually located on the P&F was a small feed/grain facility, which also served as the railroad's engine maintenance shed, since both the [...] "main track" [...] and passing track ran through the building.|$|R
5000|$|The New York and Greenwood Lake Railway [...] is a shortline {{railroad}} {{owned by}} Jim Wilson and based in Passaic, New Jersey. It operates primarily to service transfer station facilities {{for a few}} private companies, with a <b>trans-load</b> facility at its yard in Passaic. Cars run on NYGL's trackage, the former Erie Railroad Dundee spur, to interchange with the Norfolk Southern Railway on New Jersey Transit's Bergen County Line in Garfield.|$|R
50|$|The Brookhaven Rail Terminal (BRT) is a truck-train <b>trans-load</b> {{facility}} in Yaphank, New York on Long Island. The 28-acre initial site was built with $40 million in private funds and opened on September 27, 2011. It {{is projected to}} take 40,000 long haul trucks off Long Island roads and handle 1 million tons of freight a year by 2016. It includes 13,000 feet of new track, with three tracks for construction material, such as asphalt and concrete, and six tracks for merchandise, such as flour and biodiesel.|$|R
50|$|Ohi-Rail moved quickly, {{and when}} a major frac sand {{distributor}} located on the railroad in Minerva, the railroad completely rebuilt the Minerva Yard to accommodate the projected increase in traffic. At that time, they also brought General Manager, Denny Varian, on board to handle operations with the added value of his background in the rail industry. The main line is being completely rehabilitated from Minerva south {{to tap into the}} vast industrial property reserves along the line. Along with the sand cars in the railyard, tank cars are being filled with natural gas liquids via <b>trans-loading</b> from truck.|$|E
50|$|The Tacoma Eastern {{became known}} as the National Park branch of the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad. Between 1919 and 1980, the National Park branch would {{consistently}} be ranked the second most economically viable branch in the entire 1700-mile Milwaukee Road system. However, on March 15, 1980, the Milwaukee Road became the single largest railroad failure in American history. The former Tacoma Eastern portion of the railroad was conveyed to the Weyerhaeuser Corporation who used the line to move logs from Thurston and Lewis counties to a <b>trans-loading</b> facility at the Port of Tacoma for international export.|$|E

50|$|In a 42nd {{round of}} airstrikes between 8 and 10 November, the United States carried out 23 airstrikes {{in and around}} Kobanî and near Deir ez-Zor. Thirteen airstrikes {{conducted}} in and around Kobanî struck an ISIL vehicle and five small ISIL units, destroyed an ISIL-occupied building used as an ammunition stockpile, an ISIL command and control building, and seven ISIL fighting positions, as well as damaging two ISIL fighting positions. In addition, eight airstrikes southeast of Deir ez-Zor damaged several structures of an ISIL oil collection facility, which was used to <b>trans-load</b> oil for the black market, while two airstrikes east of Deir ez-Zor damaged an ISIL oil collection point.|$|R
50|$|When Regional Rail {{purchased}} the rail line {{it was in}} deep decline, but with NYS DOT grants and aggressive marketing, the line has made big advances. The old Agway Fertilizer site was converted to an inter-modal and <b>trans-load</b> site and now boasts of 4 regular customers. Commodities include beer, paper, lumber, fertilizer, wheat, barley, salt brine, potatoes and onions and of course its original mainstay plastics and chemicals and the occasional carnival train. The railroad recently leased NS lines that provided much needed additional operating revenue that saved 3 lines from abandonment. The railroad had the only through line connection operating after the mainline devastation after Hurricane Irene in 2011. Some MTA and NS trains were diverted over MNJ trackage and all local and through freight traffic was handled by them and the NYSW via the Campbell Hall cluster and yard.|$|R

5000|$|The 19th century {{proved to}} be a time of {{numerous}} travails for both the city of Norfolk, and the region as whole. War, epidemics, fires, and economic depression reduced the development of the city. The city grew into the region's economic hub. By the late 19th century, the Norfolk and Western Railway established the community as a major coal export port and built a large <b>trans-loading</b> facility at Lambert's Point. It became the terminus for numerous railroads, linking its ports to inland regions of Virginia and North Carolina, and {{at the turn of the}} 20th century the coal mining regions of Appalachia[...] Princess Anne and Norfolk Counties would become leaders in truck farming, producing over half of all greens and potatoes consumed on the east coast. Lynnhaven oysters also became a major export.|$|E
50|$|The Canadian Pacific Railway and the Canadian National Railway have {{connections}} to Saskatoon. Both railways operate intermodal facilities and <b>trans-load</b> centers; while Canadian National Railway also operates an automotive transfer facility. Saskatoon is {{a stop on}} The Canadian passenger transcontinental rail route operated by Via Rail. The Saskatoon railway station is in the city's west end; it opened in the late 1960s {{as a replacement for}} Saskatoon's original main station which was on 1st Avenue downtown—the relocation of the station sparked a major redevelopment of the downtown that included the construction of the Midtown Plaza, TCU Place (aka Centennial Auditorium) and other developments. The many provincial transportation connections and geographic location of Saskatoon give it one of its nicknames The Hub City. The Saskatchewan Railway Museum is just outside the city. Recent debates about moving all the railways out of the city are raising questions about a future LRT system, but the city's Mayor says the population is too small.|$|R
50|$|Nome has a seaport, used by freight {{ships and}} cruise ships, located at 64° 30’ N and 165° 24’ W on the {{southern}} side of the Seward Peninsula in Norton Sound. The Corps of Engineers completed the Nome Harbor Improvements Project {{in the summer of}} 2006 adding a 3025 ft breakwater east of the existing Causeway and a 270 ft spur {{on the end of the}} Causeway making it to a total of 2982 ft. The City Dock (south) on the Causeway is equipped with marine headers to handle the community's bulk cargo and fuel deliveries. The City Dock is approximately 200 ft in length with a depth of 22.5 feet (MLLW). The WestGold Dock (north) is 190 ft in length with the same depth of 22.5 feet (ML,LW). The Westgold dock handles nearly all of the exported rock/gravel for this region and is the primary location to load/unload heavy equipment. The opening between the new breakwater and the Causeway (Outer Harbor Entrance) is approximately 500 ft in width and serves as access to both Causeway deep water docks and the new Snake River entrance that leads into the Small BoatHarbor. The old entrance along the seawall has been filled in and is no longer navigable. (See photos on website) Buoys outline the navigation channel from the outer harbor entrance into the inner harbor.

40|$|An {{economic}} {{optimization model}} of waterborne containerized imports from Asia to the USA for a retailer is described. The retailer's imports are allocated to alternative ports and logistics channels {{so as to}} minimize total transportation and inventory costs. Goods may be shipped via the logistics channel of direct shipment of marine containers via truck or rail to retail distribution centers, or via transportation to cross-docking facilities in the hinterlands of the ports of entry and <b>trans-loading</b> goods from marine containers into domestic trailers or containers. A previous model has been built for a retailer employing a single optimal importing strategy, specifying the allocation of each retail distribution center to its optimal port of entry and the choice of direct shipment or <b>trans-loading,</b> uniformly applied across the importer's entire product portfolio. Here we describe a methodology to extend this model {{to allow for a}} retailer that can employ multiple optimal strategies, applied to different classes of goods within its product portfolio segmented by inventory holding cost rate. We find that for the retailer's cost minimization problem, it is provably optimal to generate sub-problems by splitting goods into consecutive valuation partitions. By doing so, the retailer's multi-strategy problem becomes computationally tractable. We examine the impact of less-than-container shipments on the optimal set of strategies. This allows us to more accurately estimate the transportation cost. We collected data, including origin-destination transportation rates and lead times, from a top five national big-box retailer to test both single and multiple strategy methodologies. Using these parameters, we found that our case study retailer could potentially reduce their total supply chain cost by over 2. 1 % by using an optimal single strategy, and over 2. 6 % by using different optimal strategies for the various goods in their portfolio. We then examine the optimal single strategy and set of multiple strategies for retailers of various importing volumes and declared goods valuation distributions. The optimal single strategy for a retailer generally shows direct shipping for the lowest value goods and lowest demand volume retailers, <b>trans-loading</b> at three to four ports for slightly higher value of goods and demand volume, and <b>trans-loading</b> at fewer and fewer ports as the good value and volume continue increasing. For our tested parameter set, the cost reduction generated by allowing multiple strategies for a single retailer can further reduce the total supply chain cost by up to 1 %. Lastly, we analyze the value of building redundancy into the supply chain to mitigate the cost of disruptions. We note that many retailers utilize more ports than our model would recommend as optimal. We have found that there is value in a retailer always utilizing at least two ports of entry to protect against supply chain disruptions at any single port. However, for those retailers whose optimal port usage already includes at least two ports, disruption mitigation would not provide enough benefit to justify the additional infrastructure investment. We hypothesize that there exist other factors such as institutional inertia and negotiation leverage that contribute to the use of these additional ports of entry...|$|E
30|$|Container shipping, by comparison, {{requires}} significant complementary {{assets in}} the form of ports, chassis, trucks and trains to deliver goods to the beneficial cargo owner. Alliances sometimes require vessels to call on multiple terminals within a single port, making it take longer to unload cargo. Process innovation and implementation for enhanced SCI cooperation cannot be done without an adequate infrastructure or capabilities to support the vessel service. These specialized assets require a bilateral dependence between the ocean carrier and the owner of the complementary asset. For example, ocean carriers need to have marshalling yards (for stacks of containers awaiting pick-up) and terminal gate operations {{that are part of the}} port terminal. Warehouses for <b>trans-loading</b> in US, EU and other countries from ocean containers to domestic vans, and the return and marshalling of empty containers further add to the complexity. Up to 30 % of an ocean vessel cargo can be empty containers.|$|E
40|$|An {{economic}} {{optimization model}} of waterborne containerized imports from Asia to the USA is described. Imports are allocated to alternative ports and logistics channels {{so as to}} minimize total transportation and inventory costs for each importer. Logistics channels include direct shipment of marine containers via truck or rail, and <b>trans-loading</b> in the hinterlands of the ports of entry from marine containers into domestic trailers or containers. The model was exercised with 2004 actual transportation costs, import volumes and declared values, plus a range of hypothetical container fees assessed on imports routed via the San Pedro Bay Ports. The results show that, without reductions in container movement lead times, container fees would result in significant diversion of cargoes to other ports. In contrast, if infrastructure is improved such that container movement lead times are significantly reduced, the model predicts little or no decrease in overall imports via San Pedro Bay but {{a substantial increase in}} trans-loaded imports for fees ranging up to $ 200 per container. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{sugarcane}} {{transfer system}} comprises sugarcane being moved, loaded, transloaded and off-loaded, which amounts {{to more than}} 25 % of the total production cost of sugarcane, hence small adjustments can have significant economic benefits. The sugarcane loading operation {{has been identified as}} an inefficient and costly component as a consequence of poor management and the under-utilisation of equipment, making it a viable leverage point for improvement. This study evaluated consignment characteristics and investigated current loading operations in an attempt to generate best management guidelines. It was directed towards the handling of whole-stick loose sugarcane, which is loaded with grabloaders. The data collected comprised photographs of sugarcane consignments, along with the payload. These photographs were examined to identify the factors that need to be considered during the loading operation. These factors include cane bulk density, the degree of cane alignment and the design characteristics of the vehicle. Cane bulk density was calculated by dividing the payload by an estimated volume attained from photographs. Two <b>trans-loading</b> sites were selected and video clips of loading operations were captured to assess typical loading practices. Factors such as {{the manner in which the}} sugarcane is presented, as well as the techniques adopted for loading, were evaluated. The results attained were utilised to generate practical recommendations for the improvement of the loading operation...|$|E
