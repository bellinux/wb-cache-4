5|$|The citadel {{encloses}} {{a set of}} buildings, {{the notable}} ones being the fort built in 1620, the Masilamaninathar Temple built in the 13th century, the Zion Church built in 1701, New Jerusalem Church built in 1718, the Town Gateway built in 1792, the Danish Governor Bungalow built in 1784 {{and a series of}} tomb stones built during the 17th and 18th centuries. The settlement inside the citadel is modeled like a small European town with a land gate and wooden doors leading to the main street, namely, the King's Street. Some of the notable buildings in the King's street are the Gate House, Muhldorff's House, Port Master's Bungalow and Rehling's House. There were originally citadel walls towards the sea, which eroded with time on account of <b>the</b> <b>salty</b> nature of the environment. The fortification could not withstand an attack by regular military forces, but acted as a protection for the citizens of the settlement against predatory cavalry raids. The bastions of the fort are constructed with black stone.|$|E
5|$|Water covers 71% of the Earth's surface. Of this, 97.5% is <b>the</b> <b>salty</b> {{water of}} the oceans and only 2.5% freshwater, most of which is locked up in the Antarctic ice sheet. The {{remaining}} freshwater is found in glaciers, lakes, rivers, wetlands, the soil, aquifers and atmosphere. Due to the water cycle, fresh water supply is continually replenished by precipitation, however {{there is still a}} limited amount necessitating management of this resource. Awareness of the global importance of preserving water for ecosystem services has only recently emerged as, during the 20th century, more than half the world's wetlands have been lost along with their valuable environmental services. Increasing urbanization pollutes clean water supplies and much of the world still does not have access to clean, safe water. Greater emphasis is now being placed on the improved management of blue (harvestable) and green (soil water available for plant use) water, and this applies at all scales of water management.|$|E

25|$|In the Netherlands, {{liquorice}} confectionery (drop) {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular forms of sweets. It is sold in many forms. Mixing it with mint, menthol, aniseed, or laurel is quite popular. Mixing it with ammonium chloride (salmiak) is also popular. A popular liquorice in the Netherlands is known as zoute drop (salty liquorice), but contains very little salt, i.e., sodium chloride. <b>The</b> <b>salty</b> taste is due to ammonium chloride. Strong, salty sweets are also popular in Nordic countries.|$|E

25|$|The {{topography}} of the municipality is diverse. Marshes are common, especially {{north of the}} city where a section of <b>the</b> <b>salty</b> wetlands became the Castro Marim and Vila Real de Santo António Marsh Natural Reserve (established in 1975, this was continental Portugal's first nature reserve). Woodlands cover the planar civil parishes of Vila Real de Santo António and Monte Gordo, while in Vila Nova de Cacela, barren lands and schist hills are more predominant. The easternmost part of the Ria Formosa system of lagoons is located in this civil parish.|$|E
25|$|Tenochtitlan {{was founded}} on an islet {{in the western part}} of the lake in the year 1325. Around it, the Aztecs created a large {{artificial}} island using a system similar to the creation of chinampas. To overcome the problems of drinking water, the Aztecs built a system of dams to separate <b>the</b> <b>salty</b> waters of the lake from the rain water of the effluents. It also permitted them to control the level of the lake. The city also had an inner system of channels that helped to control the water.|$|E
50|$|Construction of the Aswan High Dam {{across the}} Nile River in the 1960s {{has reduced the}} flow of {{freshwater}} and silt into the Levantine Sea. This made <b>the</b> sea relatively <b>saltier</b> and nutrient-poor than previously, {{which led to the}} collapse of historically important sardine fisheries, and has given an additional advantage to Red Sea species, who are adapted to <b>the</b> <b>saltier</b> and nutrient-poor Red Sea.|$|R

25|$|The {{elevated}} section {{built with}} concrete girders was not built {{to withstand the}} use of road salt in the winter. The salt created corrosion of the steel within the concrete bents (vertical columns and horizontal caps), which expanded and weakened the steel, and caused pieces of concrete to fall off. Remedial work had to be applied starting in the 1990s {{at a cost of}} $8 million per year. The remedial work included sealing expansion joints to force <b>the</b> <b>salty</b> water into the drains and extensive patching of the concrete columns. Exposed steel was sand-blasted and repainted.|$|E
25|$|A rapidly {{expanding}} centre of sub-tropical and allied horticulture, Kerikeri {{is in the}} Far North District of the North Island and lies at the western extremity of the Kerikeri Inlet, a northwestern arm of the Bay of Islands, where fresh water of the Kerikeri River enters <b>the</b> <b>salty</b> Pacific Ocean. A fast-growing community, the 2001 New Zealand census showed the population of 4,878 was an increase of 16.3 percent over the 1996 figure, and the 2006 census tally of 5,856 was a further population growth of 20 percent, and at the 2013 census had increased by a further 11 percent to 6,507.|$|E
25|$|Lake Manzala, {{which used}} to be a {{significant}} source of inexpensive fish for human consumption in Egypt, has been affected by pollution and reduced water inflow. In 1985 the lakes fishery was an open area of 89,000 ha and employed roughly 17,000 workers. The government drained substantial portions of the lake in an effort to convert its rich Nile deposits to farmland. The project was unprofitable: crops did not grow well in <b>the</b> <b>salty</b> soil and the value of resulting produce was less than the market value of the fish that the reclaimed land had formerly yielded. By 2001, Lake Manzala had lost approximately 80 percent of its former area through the effects of drainage efforts.|$|E

25|$|Ice cream {{was made}} by hand {{in a large bowl}} placed inside a tub filled with ice and salt. This was called the pot-freezer method. French confectioners refined the pot-freezer method, making ice cream in a sorbetière (a covered pail with a handle {{attached}} to the lid). In the pot-freezer method, the temperature of the ingredients is reduced by the mixture of crushed ice and salt. The salt water is cooled by the ice, and the action of the salt on the ice causes it to (partially) melt, absorbing latent heat and bringing the mixture below the freezing point of pure water. The immersed container can also make better thermal contact with <b>the</b> <b>salty</b> water and ice mixture than it could with ice alone.|$|E
25|$|Multiple {{settlements}} comprise present-day Saginaw. On {{the west}} side of the river the first settlement around what had been Fort Saginaw developed into Saginaw, which was incorporated as a city in 1857, containing the seat of the Saginaw County government. On the east side of the river a parallel settlement, East Saginaw, developed which was incorporated first as a village in 1855, and then as a city in 1859. Also south of East Saginaw, on the east bank of the river, the village of Salina formed. Salina's name relates to <b>the</b> <b>salty</b> brine that led to a growing industry of salt production in the area. Both Saginaw and East Saginaw quickly became a hub for railroad transportation in addition to ships making their way on the Saginaw River.|$|E
25|$|In March 1836, three squatters, David Fisher, James Strachan, and George Russell {{arrived on}} the Caledonia and settled the area. Geelong was first {{surveyed}} by Assistant Surveyor W. H. Smythe three weeks after Melbourne, and was gazetted as a town on 10 October 1838. There was already a church, hotel, store, wool store, and 82 houses, and the town population was 545. By 1841, the first wool {{had been sent to}} England and a regular steamer service was running between Geelong and Melbourne. Captain Foster Fyans was commissioned as the local Police Magistrate in 1837 and established himself on the Barwon River {{at the site of the}} area of present-day Fyansford. Fyans constructed a breakwater to improve the water supply to the city by preventing <b>the</b> <b>salty</b> lower reaches from mixing with fresh water and pooling water.|$|E

25|$|A round {{drilling}} edge is used, {{being the}} size of a drinking bowl, while the depth of the borehole amounts to several tens of zhang. Large bamboo stems are used with the septa removed and fitted together by male-female joints to form the well, thus keeping the fresh water out so that <b>the</b> <b>salty</b> spring water comes up by itself. Smaller bamboo tubes are also used which travel {{up and down in the}} wells as buckets. They have no bottom, but an orifice is mounted at the top. A piece of leather of several inches in size is hung up. As the tubes go in and out of the brine, the air pushes and sucks, closing and opening the leather valve. Each tube brings up several dou of brine… Where profit is to be had, people do not fail to know about it.|$|E
25|$|The Commission {{set about}} trying to find an {{alternative}} supply of drinking water for the town and garrison. It sought {{to increase the amount}} of rainwater captured by passing Gibraltar's first Public Health Ordinance in 1869, which ordered that all new dwellings should have underground tanks. At the instigation of the Commission, the British Colonial Office also commissioned the first geological survey of Gibraltar, which was undertaken in 1877 by A.C. Ramsey and J Geikie. Although it produced useful data, it failed to locate any groundwater or aquifers. Borings were carried out on the isthmus between Gibraltar and Spain in an unsuccessful attempt to find potable groundwater, but led to an improved supply of brackish water useful for sanitary purposes. The Commission instigated a system, which is still in use today, of pumping <b>the</b> <b>salty</b> water into a reservoir in the Upper Town from where it was distributed back down into the town for sanitary use. Fresh attempts were made to sink boreholes in 1892 and 1943 but neither attempt was successful in finding drinking water.|$|E

Other members have included Philip Bailey, Verdine White, Fred White, Ralph Johnson, Larry Dunn, Al McKay and Andrew Woolfolk. The band has received 20 Grammy nominations; they won six as a group and two of its members, Maurice White and Bailey, won separate individual awards. Earth, Wind & Fire have 12 American Music Awards nominations and four awards. They have been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Vocal Group Hall of Fame, received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and have sold over 100 million records, making them one of the world's best-selling bands of all time. Five members of Earth, Wind & Fire were also inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame: Maurice White, Philip Bailey, Verdine White, Larry Dunn and Al McKay. The music industry and fans have bestowed Lifetime Achievement honors from the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (Rhythm & Soul Heritage Award – 2002), NAACP (Hall of Fame – 1994) and the BET Awards (Lifetime Achievement Award – 2002).|$|E
