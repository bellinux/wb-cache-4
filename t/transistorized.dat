25|$|The smaller, lower-powered {{solenoids}} {{were first}} to be <b>transistorized,</b> followed later by the higher-current solenoids as the price, performance, and reliability of power transistors improved over the years.|$|E
25|$|Although radio {{represented}} only 15 {{percent of}} Emerson's revenue by 1954, the company credited itself as creating the first clock radio, self-powered radio, and <b>transistorized</b> pocket radio.|$|E
25|$|The Hercules missile systems sold to Japan (Nike J) were {{subsequently}} fitted with upgraded internal guidance systems, the original vacuum tube systems being replaced with <b>transistorized</b> ones.|$|E
25|$|Italian {{companies}} have developed {{products that are}} of fundamental importance in contemporary society, such as the Olivetti-developed <b>transistorized</b> mainframe computer systems and, in 1964, the world's first commercial desktop computer, the Programma 101, invented by Pier Giorgio Perotto.|$|E
25|$|The {{first use}} of channel I/O was with the IBM 709 vacuum tube mainframe, whose Model 766 Data Synchronizer was the first channel controller, in 1957. Its <b>transistorized</b> successor, the IBM 7090, had two or more {{channels}} (the 7607) and a channel multiplexor (the 7606) which could control up to eight channels.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} that he worked on the magamp, Rubin also {{considered}} using transistors in this application, but concluded that the early transistors then available were too unreliable. However, with the advent of improved transistors, the company that he worked for and other companies later produced <b>transistorized</b> versions of earth leakage protection.|$|E
25|$|In 1953 Emerson Radio and Phonograph {{purchased}} Quiet Heet Corp., which {{entered the}} company into air conditioning. Although radio represented only 15 percent of Emerson's revenue by 1954, the company credited itself as creating the firsts {{of the clock}} radio, self-powered radio, and <b>transistorized</b> pocket radio; production of tape recorders began in 1955.|$|E
25|$|Commercial {{versions}} {{were called}} Pro in Japan, and were available with either two or five seats (Pro T/F). The Pro {{had to make}} do without brake boost (until the 1985 facelift) and <b>transistorized</b> ignition (lowering power by two horsepower), and were also not available with the five speed manual transmission. The bare-bones Pro also had a manual choke.|$|E
25|$|The e-meter was {{not part}} of the early days of Dianetics and Scientology. Auditing was {{composed}} of conversation and not led by a mechanical device. Hubbard introduced an E-meter prototype during the 1952 Philadelphia Doctorate Course but did not introduce his <b>transistorized</b> version after several years later. The E-meter became “the principal material artifact” of Dianetics and Scientology from the 1960s onward.|$|E
25|$|In 1958, {{engineer}} Earl Bakken of Minneapolis, Minnesota, {{produced the}} first wearable external pacemaker {{for a patient}} of C. Walton Lillehei. This <b>transistorized</b> pacemaker, housed in a small plastic box, had controls to permit adjustment of pacing heart rate and output voltage and was connected to electrode leads which passed through {{the skin of the}} patient to terminate in electrodes attached {{to the surface of the}} myocardium of the heart.|$|E
25|$|Harley-Davidson {{has used}} various {{ignition}} systems throughout its history – {{be it the}} early points and condenser system, (Big Twin up to 1978 and Sportsters up to 1978), magneto ignition system used on some 1958 to 1969 Sportsters, early electronic with centrifugal mechanical advance weights, (all models 1978 {{and a half to}} 1979), or the late electronic with <b>transistorized</b> ignition control module, more familiarly known as the black box or the brain, (all models 1980 to present).|$|E
25|$|The {{introduction}} of <b>transistorized</b> radios, and then microcontroller-based systems that decoded the location directly, continued to improve Loran-A systems while prices dropped. By the early 1970s such units were relatively common, although they remained relatively expensive compared to devices like a radio direction finder. But {{the improvement of}} electronics through this period was so rapid {{that it was only}} a few years before Loran-C units of similar size and cost were available. This led to the decision to open Loran-C to civilian use in 1974.|$|E
25|$|At the University of Manchester, a team {{under the}} {{leadership}} of Tom Kilburn designed and built a machine using the newly developed transistors instead of valves. Initially the only devices available were germanium point-contact transistors, less reliable than the valves they replaced but which consumed far less power. Their first transistorised computer and the first in the world, was operational by 1953, and a second version was completed there in April 1955. The 1955 version used 200 transistors, 1,300 solid-state diodes, and had a power consumption of 150 watts. However, the machine did make use of valves to generate its 125kHz clock waveforms and in the circuitry to read and write on its magnetic drum memory, so it was not the first completely <b>transistorized</b> computer.|$|E
25|$|The first {{electronic}} ignition (a cold cathode type) was tested in 1948 by Delco-Remy, while Lucas introduced a <b>transistorized</b> ignition in 1955, {{which was used}} on BRM and Coventry Climax Formula One engines in 1962. The aftermarket began offering EI that year, with both the AutoLite Electric Transistor 201 and Tung-Sol EI-4 (thyratron capacitive discharge) being available. Pontiac became the first automaker to offer an optional EI, the breakerless magnetic pulse-triggered Delcotronic, on some 1963 models; it was also available on some Corvettes. The first commercially available all solid-state (SCR) capacitive discharge ignition was manufactured by Hyland Electronics in Canada also in 1963. Ford fitted a Lucas system on the Lotus 25s entered at Indianapolis the next year, ran a fleet test in 1964, and began offering optional EI on some models in 1965. Beginning in 1958, Earl W. Meyer at Chrysler worked on EI, continuing until 1961 and resulting in use of EI on the company's NASCAR hemis in 1963 and 1964.|$|E
500|$|Roberts and Mims {{were both}} {{assigned}} to the Lab's Laser Group in 1968. Roberts had reactivated Reliance Engineering and built an infrared intrusion alarm for his uncle's fish farm in Florida. Later, Roberts and Stan Cagle, a civilian worker who also went to Oklahoma State, started building a power supply they hoped to sell. Mims became an advisor to the Albuquerque Model Rocket Club and met the publisher of Model Rocketry magazine in July 1969. Mims told him about a <b>transistorized</b> tracking light that he had used on night launches of rockets in Vietnam. This led to {{an article in the}} September 1969 issue of Model Rocketry; [...] "Transistorized Tracking Light for Night Launched Model Rockets" [...] by Captain Forrest Mims. Mims became a regular contributor to Model Rocketry.|$|E
500|$|Zeus {{was similar}} to the two Nike SAM designs that preceded it. It used a long range search radar to pick up targets, {{separate}} radars to track the target and interceptor missiles in flight, and a computer to calculate intercept points. The missile itself was much larger than earlier designs, with a range of up to , compared to Hercules' [...] To ensure a kill at [...] altitude, where there was little atmosphere to carry a shock wave, it mounted a 400kiloton (kT) warhead. The search radar was a rotating triangle [...] wide, able to pick out warheads while still over [...] away, an especially difficult problem given the small size of a typical warhead. A new <b>transistorized</b> digital computer offered the performance needed to calculate trajectories for intercepts against warheads traveling over [...] per second.|$|E
2500|$|First fully <b>transistorized</b> drum {{machines}} – Seeburg/Gulbransen (1964) ...|$|E
2500|$|... {{and fully}} <b>transistorized</b> {{electronic}} rhythm machine with pre-programmed patterns, Select-A-Rhythm (SAR1), was released. [...] As {{the result of}} its robustness and enough compact size, these rhythm machines were gradually installed on the electronic organ as accompaniment of organists, and finally spread widely.|$|E
2500|$|In 1961, Dalziel, {{working with}} Rucker Manufacturing Co., {{developed}} a <b>transistorized</b> device for earth leakage protection which {{became known as}} a Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter (GFCI), sometimes colloquially shortened to Ground Fault Interrupter (GFI). [...] This name for high-sensitivity earth leakage protection is still in common use in the U.S.A.|$|E
2500|$|The Bendix [...] "Electrojector" [...] {{electronic}} {{fuel injection}} (EFI) was to be optional on the 1957 Rambler Rebel with a flashy introduction at the Daytona Beach Road Course trials. The Rebel's Electrojector equipped engine was rated at [...] This {{was to have been}} the first mass-produced engine with a <b>transistorized</b> [...] "brain box" [...] fuel injection system. A Rambler Rebel with the optional EFI was tested by Motor Trend, and they recorded this sedan going faster from a standing start than the 1957 Chevrolet Corvette with mechanical fuel injection.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{independent}} AMC dealerships began sponsoring cars in drag racing events. Preston Honea achieved fame {{with the}} 1964 [...] "Bill Kraft Rambler" [...] American from Norwalk, California. The car had a transplanted AMC V8 engine that was bored out to [...] with four carburetors on special intake manifold and featured a <b>transistorized</b> ignition {{system as well}} as an Isky 505-A camshaft. The big engine from an Ambassador added only [...] more than the venerable [...] straight-6 normally found in the small two-door American. However, with its 8200 rpm redline, the Rambler ran [...] at the Fontana dragstrip.|$|E
2500|$|The bipolar {{transistor}} {{was invented in}} 1947. From 1955 onwards transistors replaced vacuum tubes in computer designs, giving rise to the [...] "second generation" [...] of computers. Initially the only devices available were germanium point-contact transistors. Compared to vacuum tubes, transistors have many advantages: they are smaller, and require less power than vacuum tubes, so give off less heat. Silicon junction transistors were much more reliable than vacuum tubes and had longer, indefinite, service life. [...] <b>Transistorized</b> computers could contain {{tens of thousands of}} binary logic circuits in a relatively compact space. Transistors greatly reduced computers' size, initial cost, and operating cost.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Transistorized</b> {{electronics}} improved {{not only}} the CPU (Central Processing Unit), but also the peripheral devices. The second generation disk data storage units were able to store {{tens of millions of}} letters and digits. [...] Next to the fixed disk storage units, connected to the CPU via high-speed data transmission, were removable disk data storage units. A removable disk pack can be easily exchanged with another pack in a few seconds. Even if the removable disks' capacity is smaller than fixed disks, their interchangeability guarantees a nearly unlimited quantity of data close at hand. Magnetic tape provided archival capability for this data, at a lower cost than disk.|$|E
2500|$|A {{new body}} was {{introduced}} for the 1956 model featuring a new [...] "face" [...] and side coves; the taillamp fins were also gone. An optional {{fuel injection system}} was made available {{in the middle of}} the 1957 model year. It was one of the first mass-produced engines in history to reach [...] per cubic inch (16.4 cubic cm) and Chevrolet's advertising agency used a [...] "one hp per cubic inch" [...] slogan for advertising the [...] Small-Block engine. Other options included power windows (1956), hydraulically operated power convertible top (1956), heavy duty brakes and suspension (1957), and four speed manual transmission (late 1957). Delco Radio <b>transistorized</b> signal-seeking [...] "hybrid" [...] car radio, which used both vacuum tubes and transistors in its radio's circuitry (1956 option).|$|E
2500|$|There was {{no doubt}} Chevrolet was in the sports car {{business}} {{with the release of}} the 1956 model. It featured a new body, a much better convertible top with power assist optional, real glass roll up windows (also with optional power assist), and an optional hardtop. The 3-speed manual transmission was standard. The Powerglide automatic was optional. The six-cylinder engine was gone. The V8 remained at 265 cubic inches but power ranged from [...] The volume was 3,467, a low number by any contemporary standard and still less than 1954s 3,640, meaning this was the third lowest-volume model in Corvette history. Delco Radio <b>transistorized</b> signal-seeking (hybrid) car radio, which used both vacuum tubes and transistors in its radio's circuitry (1956 option).|$|E
2500|$|During the 1960s, {{implementation}} of rhythm machines were evolved into fully solid-state (<b>transistorized)</b> from early electro-mechanical with vacuum tubes, and also size {{were reduced to}} desktop size from earlier floor type. [...] In the early 1960s, a home organ manufacturer, Gulbransen (later acquired by Fender) cooperated with an automatic musical equipment manufacturer Seeburg Corporation, and released early compact rhythm machines Rhythm Prince (PRP), although, at that time, these size were still as large as small guitar amp head, due {{to the use of}} bulky electro-mechanical pattern generators. [...] Then in 1964, Seeburg invented a compact electronic rhythm pattern generator using [...] "diode matrix" [...] ( [...] in 1967), — When this patent was filed in 1964-06-26, also , , and its sound circuits [...] and [...] were filed at the same time.|$|E
2500|$|The 427 was {{available}} with a 1282ft³/min (605 L/s) Holley triple two-barrel carburetor arrangement, which the factory called Tri-Power. The ultimate Corvette engine for 1967 was coded L88, even wilder than the L89, and {{was as close}} to a pure racing engine as Chevy had ever offered in regular production. Besides the lightweight heads and bigger ports, it came with an even hotter camshaft, stratospheric 12.5:1 compression, an aluminum radiator, small-diameter flywheel, and a single huge Holley four-barrel carburetor. Although the factory advertised L88 rating was 430bhp at 4600 rpm, the true rating was said to be about 560bhp at 6400 rpm. The very high compression ratio required 103-octane racing fuel, which {{was available}} only at select service stations. Clearly this was not an engine for the casual motorist. When the L88 was ordered, Chevy made several individual options mandatory, including Positraction, the <b>transistorized</b> ignition, heavy-duty suspension, and power brakes, as well as RPO C48, which deleted the normal radio and heater to cut down on weight and discourage the car's use on the street. As costly as it was powerful – at an additional $1,500 over the base $4,240.75 price – the L88 engine and required options were sold to a mere 20 buyers that year. [...] With potential buyers anticipating the car's overdue redesign, sales for the Sting Ray's final year totaled 22,940, down over 5,000 units from 1966 results. Meanwhile, Chevrolet readied its third-generation Corvette for the 1968 model year.|$|E
50|$|Mailüfterl is a {{nickname}} for the Austrian Binär dezimaler Volltransistor-Rechenautomat (binary-decimal fully <b>transistorized</b> computing automaton), an early <b>transistorized</b> computer. Other early <b>transistorized</b> computers included TRADIC, Harwell CADET and TX-0.|$|E
50|$|<b>Transistorized</b> cardiac {{pacemaker}} - Earl Bakken founded Medtronic, where {{he developed the}} first external, battery-operated, <b>transistorized,</b> wearable artificial pacemaker in 1957.|$|E
50|$|The TRADIC (for TRAnsistor DIgital Computer or <b>TRansistorized</b> Airborne DIgital Computer) was {{the first}} <b>transistorized</b> {{computer}} in the USA, completed in 1954.|$|E
50|$|The Harwell CADET was {{the first}} fully <b>transistorized</b> {{computer}} in Europe, {{and may have been}} the first fully <b>transistorized</b> computer in the world.|$|E
5000|$|Also in the 1960s, Gulbransen {{released}} one of {{the earliest}} <b>transistorized</b> rhythm machines [...] "Seeburg/Gulbransen Select-A-Rhythm", collaborating with Seeburg Corporation.Note that Seeburg invented a fully <b>transistorized</b> rhythm machine in 1964, which was patented in 1967.|$|E
5000|$|In June 1955, Philco {{was awarded}} a {{contract}} with the National Security Agency to build a <b>transistorized</b> scientific computer, which was named the [...] "SOLO" [...] and used high-frequency surface-barrier transistors. The SOLO <b>transistorized</b> computer was the world's first completely <b>transistorized</b> computer, and was later commercially marketed by Philco as the Transac S-1000 scientific computer model. Also, later in 1955, Philco contracted with the United States Navy David Taylor Basin Research Unit to build a larger-scale fully <b>transistorized</b> computer using its high-frequency surface-barrier transistor technology, named the CPXQ model. It was later commercially marketed by Philco as the Transac S-2000 electronic data processing computer model.|$|E
50|$|In 1961, the Z22 was {{followed}} by a logically very similar <b>transistorized</b> version, the Z23. Already in 1954 Zuse had come to an agreement with Heinz Zemanek that his Zuse KG would finance the work of Rudolf Bodo, who helped Zemanek build the early European <b>transistorized</b> computer Mailüfterl, and that after that project Bodo should work for the Zuse KG—there he helped build the <b>transistorized</b> Z23. Furthermore all circuit diagrams of the Z22 were supplied to Bodo and Zemanek.|$|E
50|$|The TRADIC Phase One {{computer}} has been {{claimed to be}} the world's first fully <b>transistorized</b> computer, ahead of the Mailüfterl in Austria or the Harwell CADET in the UK, which were each completed in 1955. In the UK, the Manchester University Transistor Computer demonstrated a working prototype in 1953 which incorporated transistors before TRADIC was operational, although that was not a fully <b>transistorized</b> computer because it used vacuum tubes to generate the clock signal. The 30 watts of power for the 1 MHz clock in the TRADIC was also supplied by a vacuum tube supply because no transistors were available that could supply that much power at that frequency. If the TRADIC can be called fully <b>transistorized</b> while incorporating vacuum tubes, then the Manchester University Transistor Computer should also be, in which case that is the first <b>transistorized</b> computer and not the TRADIC. If neither can be called fully <b>transistorized,</b> then the CADET was the first fully transistorised computer in February 1955.|$|E
