50|$|According to {{an article}} from New York Times, {{telecommuting}} now takes about 2.6 percent of the American workforce not including remote works like drivers. The article also mentions an experiment done by Nicholas Bloom. Nicholas Bloom is an economics professor from Stanford University. During this experiment, 250 workers were picked randomly from Ctrip to work either at home or at an office. Ctrip is a large China travel agency. The result showed that those who telecommuted worked longer hours than those who worked at an office. The telecommuters were also more productive and happier. Ctrip saved around 2K from telecommuting. Although the quitting rate decreased for telecommuters, the promotion rate also decreased. Many telecommuters asked {{to be back in}} the office at the end with reasoning like loneliness and desire for promotion. Kate Lister, president of Global Workplace Analytics, came to the conclusion that most workers prefer telecommuting and office work combined. Telecommuting increases efficiency and workers’ flexibility. America has an increasing trend of using teleworking due to its strong economics and multimedia services. Among the top 10 telecommuter countries, U.S is ranked number one; however, developing countries like China is also catching up to the trend.An article from money.163.com states that the number of telecommuters in the Asia pacific region exceeds region like America, Europe, Middle East and Africa. Asia Pacific region has about 37% telecommuters while the others have about 23-4%. Chinese citizens also favor the combination of telecommuting and office work due to reason like disturbance at work and increase in flexibility. Not all workers have the chance <b>to</b> <b>telecommute.</b> One of the ethical issues behind telecommuting is who should have the chance <b>to</b> <b>telecommute?</b> One may have more chance to work at home because he/she has young children. The other one may argue he/she also has personal problems. It is favored by most workers to combine telecommuting and office work. Many think that telecommuting once or twice a week is a reasonable schedule. Businesses also favor this suggestion because workers are more satisfied and companies save money from it.|$|E

30|$|A {{comparison}} of the effect sizes shows that the effect sizes of sabbaticals and flexible work schedules on organizational attachment are similar. However, the fact that sabbaticals have a significantly stronger effect on organizational attachment than telecommuting indicates that employees consider <b>telecommuting</b> <b>to</b> be less beneficial than sabbaticals and flexible work schedules. As mentioned above, and in contrast to flexible work schedules, telecommuting presents various disadvantages for employees, such as social and professional isolation. Hence, although both practices offer regular flexibility, employees prefer flexible work schedules <b>to</b> <b>telecommuting,</b> because flexible work schedules provide daily working time flexibility without the significant drawbacks of telecommuting. Employees may also value sabbaticals more than telecommuting because they allow employees to fulfil personal dreams, like a trip around the world, while still having job security as they do not lose their legal rights as employees.|$|R

Likewise, the end nodes may exfiltrate sensitive data (e.g. log keystrokes or screen-capture). Assuming the device is fully trustworthy, the end node must provide the means to properly authenticate the user. Other nodes may impersonate trusted computers, thus requiring device authentication. The device and user may be trusted but within an untrustworthy environment (as determined by inboard sensors' feedback). Collectively, these risks are called the End Node Problem. There are several remedies but all require instilling trust in the end node and conveying that trust to the network/cloud.|$|E
