5000|$|<b>Missing</b> <b>Links</b> is a 1987 {{compilation}} album by The Monkees. While [...] "Apples, Peaches, Bananas And Pears" [...] and [...] "If You Have the Time" [...] both {{featured in}} the reruns of their 1960s television series, http://monkeestv.tripod.com/SaturdayAfternoon/CBS_71-72.html none of the tracks had ever been issued commercially. <b>Missing</b> <b>Links</b> is {{the first volume of}} a three-volume set (followed by <b>Missing</b> <b>Links</b> Volume 2 and <b>Missing</b> <b>Links</b> Volume 3).|$|R
50|$|First {{released}} on <b>Missing</b> <b>Links</b> in 1988. The mix presented here is slightly different than on <b>Missing</b> <b>Links.</b> The opening and ending dialogues are removed, {{and the song}} fades out at the end, whereas the mix on <b>Missing</b> <b>Links</b> does not fade. The moog also doesn't appear in this mix until after the interlude, whereas in the mix on <b>Missing</b> <b>Links,</b> the moog can be heard during all verses, and the interlude. The moog is also more restrained in this mix than in the mix on <b>Missing</b> <b>Links.</b>|$|R

50|$|<b>Missing</b> <b>Links</b> Volume Three is {{the third}} and final volume in a series of <b>Missing</b> <b>Links</b> {{compilations}} by The Monkees. Like the original (<b>Missing</b> <b>Links</b> and <b>Missing</b> <b>Links</b> Volume 2), the album is composed of unreleased material. The release marks the first time the television edit of the series' opening theme song was made available. Previous releases featured the album version, which is twice as long but lacks the television version's final verse.|$|R
50|$|<b>Missing</b> <b>Links</b> Volume Two is {{the second}} of three rarity albums by the Monkees (<b>Missing</b> <b>Links</b> Volume 1 and <b>Missing</b> <b>Links</b> Volume 3). It was {{released}} in 1990. The album contains several tracks that had been featured in the television series but {{had never before been}} available commercially.|$|R
40|$|In most of {{the link}} {{prediction}} methods, all predicted <b>missing</b> <b>links</b> are ranked according to their scores. In the practical application of prediction results, starting from the first link that has {{the highest score in}} the ranking list, we verify each link one by one through experiments or other ways. Nevertheless, how to find an occurrence pattern of true <b>missing</b> <b>links</b> in the ranking list has seldomly reported. In present study, I proposed a mathematical model for relationship between cumulative number of predicted true <b>missing</b> <b>links</b> (y) and cumulative number of predicted <b>missing</b> <b>links</b> (x) : y=K(1 -e^(-rx/K)), where K is the expected total number of true <b>missing</b> <b>links,</b> and r is the intrinsic (maximum) occurrence probability of true <b>missing</b> <b>links.</b> It can be used to predict the changes of occurrence probability of true <b>missing</b> <b>links,</b> assess the effectiveness of a prediction method, and help find the mechanism of <b>link</b> <b>missing</b> in the network. The model was validated by six prediction methods using the data of tumor pathways. ...|$|R

50|$|<b>Missing</b> <b>Link</b> is a superhumanly strong Neanderthal-like {{humanoid}} {{whose body}} absorbs and emits radiation. Eventually the <b>Missing</b> <b>Link</b> builds {{up so much}} radiation that he explodes, but can then reconstruct his body.|$|R
5000|$|It {{starts with}} a caveman going to give some flowers to a cavegirl. He fails when he hits a tree. However, he keeps going. However, the [...] "Self Appointed Hero" [...] of the story steals the girl's heart. Meanwhile, an evil Gorilla-like {{creature}} called [...] "Wild Willie" [...] the <b>Missing</b> <b>Link</b> is watching them. When the <b>Missing</b> <b>Link</b> goes to the lake to get some water, where the dinosaur is, the dinosaur kills the <b>Missing</b> <b>Link</b> and goes away. Then the [...] "Hero" [...] finds the <b>Missing</b> <b>Link</b> and takes the credit for killing Wild Willie.|$|R
50|$|Over {{the next}} few months, new episodes of <b>Missing</b> <b>Link,</b> Top 5 Reasons You Can't Blame and Ringside aired as scheduled. However, <b>Missing</b> <b>Link</b> was {{cancelled}} in June 2007, at which time production was also halted on the other two programs.|$|R
50|$|In 2005, the Africa Wrestling Federation {{was renamed}} the Africa Wrestling Alliance. In December, 2006 at the Parow Civic Centre, he defended the title against rival <b>Missing</b> <b>Link</b> in a match {{that would be}} hailed as the most violent in Koen's career, winning after <b>Missing</b> <b>Link</b> was thrown through a table engulfed in fire. Koen {{would go on to}} defend the title {{successfully}} until 30 April 2008, when he was defeated by <b>Missing</b> <b>Link</b> in a four-way match also involving BDX-Treme and African Warrior. On 9 December 2009 at the Night of Champions event, Koen defeated <b>Missing</b> <b>Link</b> to win his fourth All-Africa Heavyweight Title, breaking his previous record of three reigns in the process.|$|R
40|$|In present study, I {{proposed}} a node degree dependent random perturbation algorithm for prediction of <b>missing</b> <b>links</b> in the network. In the algorithm, I {{assume that a}} node with more existing <b>links</b> harbors more <b>missing</b> <b>links.</b> There are two rules. Rule 1 means that a randomly chosen node tends to connect to the node with greater degree. Rule 2 means that a link tends to be created between two nodes with greater degrees. <b>Missing</b> <b>links</b> of some tumor related networks (pathways) are predicted. The results prove that the prediction efficiency and percentage of correctly predicted <b>links</b> against predicted <b>missing</b> <b>links</b> with the algorithm increases as the increase of network complexity. The required number for finding true <b>missing</b> <b>links</b> in the predicted list reduces as the increase of network complexity. Prediction efficiency is complexity-depedent only. Matlab codes of the algorithm are given also. Finally, prospect of prediction for <b>missing</b> <b>links</b> is briefly reviewed. So far all prediction methods based on static topological structure only (represented by adjacency matrix) seems to be low efficient. Network evolution based, node similarity based, and sampling based (correlation based) methods {{are expected to be}} the most promising in the future. ...|$|R
50|$|On March 30, 1964, <b>Missing</b> <b>Links</b> {{moved to}} ABC {{to replace the}} {{cancelled}} The Object Is with Clark replacing McMahon as host. Its place on NBCs schedule was taken by Jeopardy!, which quickly grew in popularity. Shortly after this, CBS began counterprogramming <b>Missing</b> <b>Links</b> with reruns of The Jack Benny Program and the ratings for the game show slid even further. ABC cancelled <b>Missing</b> <b>Links</b> almost nine months later and the show {{came to an end}} on December 25, 1964.|$|R
50|$|<b>Missing</b> <b>Links</b> - The show's website {{features}} {{a list of}} links to odd and/or humorous websites. Many links are submitted by listeners, while others are found by the hosts. Before Head Up Your Ass Headlines begins, new additions to the <b>Missing</b> <b>Links</b> section are announced.|$|R
50|$|Originally {{featured}} on <b>Missing</b> <b>Links</b> in stereo. The track is also {{included on the}} Listen to the Band and Music Box sets in slightly different stereo mixes, and Monkeemania (The Very Best of the Monkees) in the same stereo mix presented on <b>Missing</b> <b>Links.</b>|$|R

40|$|Writing {{a thesis}} is {{required}} {{as the final}} assignment for university students to get the degree in their field. The thesis {{is expected to be}} right, correct, and achieved its unity. There should be oneness between one chapter and other chapters. As a matter of fact, many statements of problems stated in chapter I are not answered appropriately in findings (chapter IV). In other words, there are <b>missing</b> <b>link</b> between statement of problems and findings. The research was conducted to know {{whether or not there is}} <b>missing</b> <b>link</b> between statement of problems and findings and the percentage of <b>missing</b> <b>links,</b> and the causes of <b>missing</b> <b>links</b> in theses of educational research of English Department published in 2003 at Muhammadiyah University of Malang. And, the causes of <b>missing</b> <b>link</b> between statement of problems and findings are determined into 4 criteria. Those are lack of related references, inappropriate instruments, wrong data analysis, and insufficient background of study. The research design used in this study is a descriptive qualitative design. The researcher took educational theses in 2003 publication of English Department at Muhammadiyah University of Malang as the population. The total number of population is 45 theses. The researcher took all the theses as the sample because the amount of theses is less than 100. The researcher employed document analysis. The result of study showed that there are 4 theses or 0. 089 % have <b>missing</b> <b>link</b> between statement of problems and findings. The cause of <b>missing</b> <b>link</b> is wrong data analysis...|$|R
