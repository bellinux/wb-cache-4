40|$|The protein binding of <b>timegadine</b> to albumin, serum, plasma and plasma enriched {{with the}} acute phase {{reactants}} alpha 1 -acid glycoprotein, alpha 1 -anti-trypsin and C-reactive protein {{was determined by}} equilibrium dialysis. The effects of other analgesic and anti-inflammatories (indomethacin, ketoprofen, paracetamol and sodium salicylate) and other basic drugs (disopyramide, lignocaine, propranolol and quinidine) on the binding of <b>timegadine</b> were also determined. <b>Timegadine</b> binding was concentration-dependent up to 0. 5 micrograms/ml, but independent above this level up to 10. 0 micrograms/ml, the mean and standard error being 93. 8 +/- 0. 5 %. Albumin accounted for only 32. 4 % of <b>timegadine</b> bound to plasma. Plasma enrichment with the acute phase reactants led to significant increases in <b>timegadine</b> binding. Simultaneous dialysis with other drugs caused significant decreases in <b>timegadine</b> binding...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} food {{ingestion}} on {{the absorption of}} <b>timegadine,</b> a recently synthesised non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, was studied in ten healthy volunteers. It was found that food enhanced the absorption of <b>timegadine</b> as shown by increased peak plasma concentrations (Cmax), decreased time taken to achieve these concentrations (tmax), and increased area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{products}} {{resulting from}} proteolytic degradation of human fibrinogen (FDP) {{were found to}} induce the release of histamine from rat peritoneal mast cells. Low molecular weight, dialysable peptides (FDP) showed the highest dose dependent, histamine releasing activity. Histamine release induced by FDP was effectively inhibited by the gold compound auranofin at a concentration of 10 (- 5) - 10 (- 7) mol/l and also by the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs BW 755 c, <b>timegadine,</b> medosan, naproxen, and aspirin at the higher concentration range of 10 (- 4) - 10 (- 6) mol/l. It is concluded that the release of histamine from mast cells may be modulated to some extent by anti-inflammatory drugs, especially auranofin, BW 755 c and <b>timegadine,</b> a functional property which may be beneficial {{in the management of}} joint disease...|$|E
40|$|The {{universal}} {{response surface}} approach (URSA) {{was developed to}} assess the nature and intensity of drug interactions, ie, synergism. antagonism and additivity. URSA consists of fitting a concentration-effect surface to experimental data with maximum likelihood approaches, with the estimation of parameters, including: ID 5 os, concentration-effect slopes and the synergism-antagonism parameter α When α is positive, synergism is indicated, when α is negative, antagonism is indicated and when α is zero. additivity is indicated. URSA was applied to data from a set of 45 in vitro growth inhibition experiments with the L 929 mouse cell line. The cytokine, tumour necrosis factor (TNF), was combined with one of nine eicosanoid synthesis inhibitors: indomethacin, Ro 20 - 5720, ibuprofen (cyclooxygenase inhibitors) : nordihydroguaiaretic acid, nafazatrom, esculetin (lipoxygenase inhibitors) : or BW- 755 C, p henidone, <b>timegadine</b> [cyclo- and lipoxygenase inhibitors). Five different schedules were used with various orders and durations of drug exposure. Examples of all three types of drug interaction were found for combinations of TNF with all three classes of drugs. The largest synergism found was for TNF plus BW- 755 C (α = 4. 30 ± 1. 3 [SE]). In general, for each combination, the degree of synergism was greater for schedules in which cells were exposed to TNF before exposure to the other agent...|$|E
