5|$|All {{episodes of}} the first season were written by Sam Egan and Kindler; Kindler hired Egan to assist in writing the first season, as he {{believed}} Egan <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>creative,</b> passionate, and talented. Several episodes {{of the first}} season were written throughout the Christmas season in 2007. After the series was given the green-light, they were rewritten to establish a season-long storyline. Some of the episodes finished their writing stage as little as {{two and a half}} weeks before filming commenced. At times after the scripts were written, Sci Fi executive Mark Stern fed back to the writers, asking for certain elements to be explained so the audience could understand.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} Moo, You Bloody Choir saw Richards {{expected}} by record label Sony BMG {{to produce a}} quality follow-up. He denied being under significant pressure, though {{the persistence of the}} label—"Richo, have you got a single? Do you have singles? Please, do you have singles?"—was noted. Much of the writing for Augie March's fourth album took place while touring the United States, which Richards argued minimised the band's opportunities <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>creative.</b> In 2008, Augie March began recording Watch Me Disappear at Neil Finn's Auckland studios; they also recorded in Melbourne, Sydney, and Los Angeles. The band worked primarily in New Zealand {{to get away from the}} distraction of Melbourne, their hometown, thus allowing them to focus solely on recording.|$|E

25|$|Music therapy {{comes in}} two {{different}} forms: active and receptive. In active therapy, the therapist and patient actively participate in creating music with instruments, their voice, or other objects. This allows for the patient <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>creative</b> and expressive through the art of music. Receptive therapy {{takes place in a}} more relaxed setting where the therapist plays or makes music to the patient who is free to draw, listen or meditate. Usually the therapist determines the method unless specifically requested by the patient.|$|E

25|$|The Sneinton Festival {{has three}} elements: initial workshops, a week-long festival, {{and the final}} carnival. Workshops {{organised}} by The Festival Group {{take place in the}} run-up to the festival, and bring young people together <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>creative</b> around the year's theme, building the artwork, decorations and costumes, as well as holding dance and performance workshops. The Festival Week begins on a Saturday, and involves seven days of arts-based free and open events held in and around Sneinton. Festival Week culminates in a parade held on Carnival Day, on the next Saturday. The Carnival Parade includes floats, fancy dress, costumes, samba bands, jazz bands, youth bands, dancers, and a variety of other event performers. The festival then continues in the Hermitage Square when the parade arrives, and features an afternoon of free and diverse entertainment.|$|E
500|$|The three {{sections}} {{of a typical}} session are the warm-up, the action, and the sharing. [...] During the warm-up, the actors are encouraged {{to enter into a}} state of mind where they can be present in and aware of the current moment and are free <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>creative.</b> [...] This is done through the use of different ice-breaker games and activities. [...] Next, the action section of the psychodrama session is the time in which the actual scenes themselves take place. [...] Finally, in the post-discussion, the different actors are able to comment on the action, coming from their personal point of view, not as a critique, [...] sharing their empathy and experiences with the protagonist of the scene.|$|E

Drawing on neo-Foucauldian theorists and critics of post-Fordist labour we argue that labouring for a fit body participates in the entrepreneurial project of the self. In the precarious climates of neoliberal austerity, where we <b>are</b> encouraged <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>creatives</b> and entrepeneurs, SNS have become sites where new forms of masculinities are being displayed {{for the purposes of}} self-branding...|$|R
500|$|Keith Farrell of Compute!'s Gazette {{was struck}} by Maniac Mansions {{similarity}} to film, particularly in its use of cutscenes to impart [...] "information or urgency". He lauded the game's graphics, animation and high level of detail. Commodore Users Bill Scolding and three reviewers from Zzap!64 compared the game to The Rocky Horror Picture Show. Further comparisons were drawn to Psycho, Friday the 13th, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, The Addams Family and Scooby-Doo. Russ Ceccola of Commodore Magazine found the cutscenes <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>creative</b> and well made, and he commented that the [...] "characters are distinctively Lucasfilm's, bringing facial expressions and personality to each individual character". In Compute!, Orson Scott Card praised the game's humor, cinematic storytelling and lack of violence. He called it [...] "compellingly good" [...] and evidence of Lucasfilm's push [...] "to make computer games a valid storytelling art".|$|E
500|$|Santamental, {{released}} in October 2003, is a collaborative project featuring several prominent musicians such as guitarists Eddie Van Halen, Slash, Steve Vai, and drummer Gregg Bissonette. When Lukather's record company, Bop City Records, approached him about recording a Christmas album, he {{responded with a}} quip about his suitability for the project. The company {{wanted him to do}} the record knowing he would approach the project with a unique angle and produce something different from the typical Christmas album. Lukather recruited keyboardist Jeff Babko and guitarist Larry Carlton, who Lukather had worked with previously, to help arrange the songs. The project was a challenge to Lukather, who had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>creative</b> to turn the traditionally simple songs into something interesting for listeners without altering the fundamental structures. He said of the album, [...] "But I never dreamt in a million years that I'd do a Christmas record." ...|$|E
500|$|Miguel {{collaborated with}} Silvetti for the {{arrangement}} of Romances, while Manzanero {{was in charge of}} direction. [...] Recording began on 18 March 1997, at Ocean Way Recording in Hollywood and at The Hit Factory in New York City. During the recording of Romances, as in Romance, Silvetti employed his signature style of arrangements known as the [...] "Silvetti Sound", which Leila Cobo of Billboard describes as [...] "anchored in sweeping melodies, lush string arrangements, acoustic instrumentation, and above all, unabashed romanticism". Silvetti has stated that when he produces an album he does not simply copy his own arrangements, because he feels that would be [...] "ridiculous", and prefers <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>creative</b> within his own style. About the selection of songs for the album, Manzanero stated that [...] "I give [...] the songs, and he chooses what he wants to record." [...] Participants in the recording sessions included sixty-one musicians from the Los Angeles Philharmonic.|$|E

500|$|Campbell had {{to sleep}} wearing his make-up. Because of several scenes that {{required}} to be shot in both {{the day and the}} night, it was considered easiest to have Campbell sleep all night wearing his make-up, since removing it was too complicated. When Campbell eventually had the effect removed, he was alarmed to notice that his face had actually [...] "changed shape" [...] because of how long the make-up had been applied, though it returned to normal after an extended amount of time. This serves as one of several moments where the film-makers had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>creative</b> to make the film considering the low budget. Other examples include blacking out the windows to make scenes darker and shooting all night long to make the filming schedule. Raimi had to get increasingly inventive during production, often coming up with [...] "bizarre" [...] ideas while shooting scenes. This led to him experimenting with camera moves and camera speeds, [...] "taking it a little further than we had gone before, recording synch-sound at a third slower for a more monstrous effect.|$|E
500|$|The book is {{categorized}} as non-fiction science but some commentators emphasize {{it may be}} better described as speculative fiction. The World Without Us is grounded in environmental and science journalism. Like other environmental books, it discusses the impact that the human race has had on the planet. Weisman's thought experiment removes the judgments and sufferings of humans by focusing on a hypothetical post-human world. This approach to the genre, which [...] "throw the spotlight on the earth itself", was found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>creative</b> and objective. There have been other books that address similar topics, such as Gregory Benford's 1999 book Deep Time: How Humanity Communicates Across Millennia. Science fiction writers such as H. G. Wells (The War of the Worlds, 1898) and John Wyndham (The Day of the Triffids, 1951) had earlier touched upon the possible fate of cities and other man-made structures after the sudden removal of their creators. Similar parallels in the decay of civilization are detailed in 1949 post-apocalyptic science fiction novel by Berkeley English professor George R. Stewart, Earth Abides.|$|E
500|$|In 1984, while {{promoting}} the film This Is Spinal Tap, Shearer, Christopher Guest and Michael McKean had a performance on Saturday Night Live. All three members were offered {{the chance to}} join to the show in the 1984–1985 season. Shearer accepted because he was treated well by the producers and he thought the backstage environment had improved but later stated that he [...] "didn't realize that guests are treated better than the regulars." [...] Guest also accepted the offer while McKean rejected it, although he would join the cast in 1994. Dick Ebersol, who replaced Lorne Michaels as the show's producer, said that Shearer was [...] "a gifted performer but {{a pain in the}} butt. He's just so demanding on the preciseness of things and he's very, very hard on the working people. He's just a nightmare-to-deal-with person." [...] In January 1985, Shearer left the show for good, partially because he felt he was not being used enough. Martin Short said Shearer [...] "wanted <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>creative</b> and Dick [...] wanted something else. [...] I think he felt his voice wasn't getting represented on the show. When he wouldn't get that chance, it made him very upset." ...|$|E
