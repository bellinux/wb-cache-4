40|$|Non-luminous {{relativistic}} electron beams above <b>thunderclouds</b> are {{detected by}} radio remote sensing with low frequency radio signals from 40 – 400 kHz. The electron beams occur 2 – 9 ms after positive cloud-to-ground lightning discharges at heights between 22 – 72 km above <b>thunderclouds.</b> The positive lightning discharges also cause sprites which occur either above or before the electron beam. One electron beam was detected without any luminous sprite occurrence {{which suggests that}} electron beams may also occur independently. Numerical simulations show that the beamed electrons partially discharge the lightning electric field above <b>thunderclouds</b> and thereby gain a mean energy of 7 MeV to transport a total charge of 10 mC upwards. The impulsive current associated with relativistic electron beams above <b>thunderclouds</b> is directed downwards {{and needs to be}} considered as a novel element of the global atmospheric electric circuit...|$|R
25|$|It is {{possible}} for {{one end of the}} leader to fill the oppositely-charged well entirely while the other end is still active. When this happens, the leader end which filled the well may propagate outside of the <b>thundercloud</b> and result in either a cloud-to-air flash or a cloud-to-ground flash. In a typical cloud-to-ground flash, a bidirectional leader initiates between the main negative and lower positive charge regions in a <b>thundercloud.</b> The weaker positive charge region is filled quickly by the negative leader which then propagates toward the inductively-charged ground.|$|E

40|$|International audienceNon-luminous {{relativistic}} electron beams above <b>thunderclouds</b> {{have been}} detected by the radio signals of low frequency ∼ 40 - 400 kHz which they radiate. The electron beams occur ∼ 2 - 9 ms after positive cloud-to-ground lightning discharges at heights between ∼ 22 - 72 km above <b>thunderclouds.</b> Intense positive lightning discharges can also cause sprites which occur either above or prior to the electron beam. One electron beam was detected without any luminous sprite which suggests that electron beams may also occur independently of sprites.

25|$|The oppositely charged regions {{create an}} {{electric}} field within {{the air between}} them. This electric field varies {{in relation to the}} strength of the surface charge on the base of the <b>thundercloud</b> – the greater the accumulated charge, the higher the electrical field.|$|E
25|$|When a {{stepped leader}} {{approaches}} the ground, {{the presence of}} opposite charges on the ground enhances {{the strength of the}} electric field. The electric field is strongest on grounded objects whose tops are closest {{to the base of the}} <b>thundercloud,</b> such as trees and tall buildings. If the electric field is strong enough, a positively charged ionic channel, called a positive or upward streamer, can develop from these points. This was first theorized by Heinz Kasemir.|$|E
25|$|Volcanic {{activity}} produces lightning-friendly {{conditions in}} multiple ways. The enormous quantity of pulverized material and gases explosively ejected {{into the atmosphere}} creates a dense plume of particles. The ash density and constant motion within the volcanic plume produces charge by frictional interactions (triboelectrification), resulting in very powerful and very frequent flashes as the cloud attempts to neutralize itself. Due to the extensive solid material (ash) content, unlike the water rich charge generating zones of a normal <b>thundercloud,</b> it is often called a dirty thunderstorm.|$|E

25|$|The Charge Transfer theory {{states that}} a {{lightning}} strike to a protected structure {{can be prevented}} by reducing the electrical potential between the protected structure and the <b>thundercloud.</b> This is done by transferring electric charge (such as from the nearby Earth to the sky or vice versa). Transferring electric charge from the Earth to the sky is done by installing engineered products composed of many points above the structure. It is noted that pointed objects will indeed transfer charge to the surrounding atmosphere and that a considerable electric current can be measured through the conductors as ionization occurs at the point when an electric field is present, such as happens when thunderclouds are overhead.|$|E
500|$|Yet another {{creation}} myth {{puts the}} origin of the Arabian in the time of Ishmael, the son of Abraham. In this story, the Angel Jibril (also known as Gabriel) descended from Heaven and awakened Ishmael with a [...] "wind-spout" [...] that whirled toward him. The Angel then commanded the <b>thundercloud</b> to stop scattering dust and rain, and so it gathered itself into a prancing, handsome creature - a horse - that seemed to swallow up the ground. Hence, the Bedouins bestowed the title [...] "Drinker of the Wind" [...] to the first Arabian horse.|$|E
500|$|A tornado is a violent, {{rotating}} {{column of}} air {{in contact with}} both {{the surface of the}} earth and a cumulonimbus cloud (otherwise known as a <b>thundercloud)</b> or, in rare cases, the base of a cumulus cloud. Tornadoes come in many sizes but are typically in the form of a visible condensation funnel, whose narrow end touches the earth and is often encircled by a cloud of debris and dust. [...] Most tornadoes have wind speeds between , are approximately [...] across, and travel several kilometers (a few miles) before dissipating. Some attain wind speeds of more than , stretch more than [...] across, and stay on the ground for more than 100kilometres (dozens of miles).|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Microphysics {{that generates}} {{lightning}} flashes {{is associated with}} the physical chemistry properties of the local occurrence atmosphere. The principal agent of the electrical activity in Titan could be the methane because of its self-polarization properties or pyroelectricity. We calculate the charge obtained by Titan’s <b>thunderclouds</b> due to methane, using the approximations of <b>thunderclouds</b> as telluric capacitors. We present a time dependent mechanism because the life time of <b>thunderclouds</b> is very low; for that, we employ common atmospheric approach used for the Earth, because the similitude of both atmospheres in their chemical compositions. In Titan’s atmosphere the methane concentration is bigger than the Earth, and the electrical activity is superior, so the observed phenomenology seems to agree with this model. 1...|$|R

500|$|On {{the evening}} of 7 May 1917, near Douai, 11 British {{aircraft}} from No.56 Squadron led by Ball in an S.E.5 encountered German fighters from Jasta11.

Ball was last seen by fellow pilots pursuing the red Albatros D.III of the Red Baron's younger brother, Lothar von Richthofen, who eventually landed near Annœullin with a punctured fuel tank. Cyril Crowe observed Ball flying into a dark <b>thundercloud.</b> A German pilot officer on the ground, Lieutenant Hailer, then saw Ball's plane falling upside-down {{from the bottom of}} the cloud, at an altitude of , with a dead prop.|$|E

After receiving the kickoff, the Marines drove steadily to Vanderbilt's 10-yard line as Goettge repeatedly completed short passes. At the 10, Groves dropped back. The pass from center was low. He missed it. He reached for the ball. It trickled off his fingers. The Commodores were boring in. Wakefield was in there. Then Bomar came charging through. He picked up the ball and with a twist was out of Groves' grasp. He came out of the bunch with a long, charging run. Then he seemed a little undecided. One fleeting glance behind him and he struck out. Up came his free arm to brush off his headgear. His thin, yellow hair stood out. On he swept like a <b>thundercloud</b> of vengeance across the goal.

40|$|For the {{analysis}} of the actual dominant mechanism or mechanisms of electrification in a given storm cell, it is of great importance to make observations which can be used to determine the configuration and the magnitudes of the currents and impedances of the generator systems in active <b>thunderclouds.</b> Krider and Musser (1982) have measured Maxwell currents below Florida <b>thunderclouds</b> and shown that their patterns are consistent with simple generator geometries. It is, therefore, of great interest to study {{the extent to which a}} set of Maxwell current measurements can be inverted to obtain the generator currents and locations.
