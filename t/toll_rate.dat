As a result, the <b>toll</b> <b>rates</b> on roads on Florida's Turnpike Enterprise were raised on June 24, 2012, an increase of 11.7% to reflect the previous five years. The legislation allows for SunPass rates to be raised slightly each year, with cash rates going up every five years, with SunPass rates staying about a quarter cheaper than cash rates. [...] In keeping with the legislation, SunPass and toll-by-plate rates were raised again on July 1, 2013 by 2.1%, with cash <b>toll</b> <b>rates</b> staying the same, and are the <b>toll</b> <b>rates</b> as of January 2014.|$|R

5|$|Unlike {{most other}} toll highways, Highway 407 {{features}} no toll booths. Rather, {{a system of}} cameras and transponders allows for automatic toll collection. It {{is one of the}} earliest examples of a highway to exclusively use open road tolling. Highway407 is otherwise designed as a normal freeway; interchanges connect directly to surface streets. A radio antenna detects when a vehicle with a transponder has entered and exited the highway, calculating the <b>toll</b> <b>rate.</b> For vehicles without a transponder, an automatic number plate recognition system is used. In both cases, monthly statements are mailed to users. The automatic number plate recognition system is linked to several provincial and U.S. state motor vehicle registries.|$|E
25|$|Tolls {{are only}} {{collected}} from westbound traffic at the toll plaza {{on the east}} side of the bay. Since July 2010, the <b>toll</b> <b>rate</b> for passenger cars is $5. For vehicles with more than two axles, the <b>toll</b> <b>rate</b> is $5 per axle. Drivers may either pay by cash or use the FasTrak electronic toll collection device. There are seven toll lanes at the plaza. During peak traffic hours, the leftmost lane is designated a FasTrak-only HOV lane, allowing carpool vehicles carrying two or more people or motorcycles to pass for a toll of $2.50. The next two leftmost lanes are FasTrak-only lanes for all vehicles, and all other lanes accept both cash and FasTrak. During non-peak hours the HOV lane is open to vehicles carrying only one person, but remains FasTrak-only.|$|E

25|$|The {{agreement}} gave ERC {{the authority}} to impose tolling on the roadway in order to recoup the private parties the money they put into the project. Initially, ERC estimated the <b>toll</b> <b>rate</b> to be between $2–3 (for cars), however the Comprehensive Agreement scheduled the tolls to begin at rates of $1.59/non-peak hours and $1.84/peak for cars and $4.77/non-peak and $7.34/peak for heavy vehicles after the infusion of VDOT and FHWA money and the extra eight years added to the concession. However, after public outcry at the rates, the incoming governor, Terry McAuliffe announced a further, $82.5 million buydown of the tolls through {{the completion of the}} construction. This buydown reduced tolls to 75-cents/off peak and $1.00/peak for the light vehicles, and $2.25 during non-peak or $4.00 during peak hours for heavy vehicles. Under Gov. McAuliffe's plan, toll rates would increase by 25-cents each year until January 2017 or until the new Midtown Tunnel is completed, at which point they would return to the rates set in the Comprehensive Agreement.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{tests the}} {{hypothesis}} that the salience of a tax system affects equilibrium tax rates. To do this, I analyze how <b>toll</b> <b>rates</b> change after <b>toll</b> facilities adopt electronic toll collection. Unlike manual toll collection, in which the driver must hand over cash at the toll collection plaza, electronic toll collection automatically debits the toll amount as the car drives through the toll plaza, thereby plausibly decreasing the salience of the toll. I find robust evidence that <b>toll</b> <b>rates</b> increase following the adoption of electronic toll collection. My estimates suggest that, in steady state, <b>toll</b> <b>rates</b> are 20 to 40 percent higher than they would have been without electronic toll collection. Consistent with {{the hypothesis that}} decreased tax salience is responsible for the increase in <b>toll</b> <b>rates,</b> I also find evidence that the short run elasticity of driving with respect to the actual toll declines (in absolute value) following the adoption of electronic toll collection. I consider a variety of alternative explanations for these results and conclude that these are unlikely to be able to explain the findings. ...|$|R
