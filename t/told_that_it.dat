5|$|Alan Tudyk applied {{through a}} casting office and {{several months later}} was called in for an audition, where he met with Whedon. He was called back to test with two {{candidates}} {{for the role of}} Zoe (Wash's wife) and was <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was down to him and one other candidate. The Zoes he tested with were not selected (Gina Torres eventually received the role) and Tudyk was sent home, but received a call informing him he had the part anyway. His audition tape is included in the special features of the DVD release.|$|E
5|$|The jury {{consisted}} of seven men and five women, including one Afro-Caribbean woman. They were not <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was Silcott's fourth murder trial, {{that he had}} been out on bail for the murder of Anthony Smith when Blakelock was killed, or that he had subsequently been convicted of that murder. Silcott's barrister, Barbara Mills (1940–2011), a future Director of Public Prosecutions, decided that he should not take the stand to avoid exposing him to questions about his previous convictions.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the ship}} Virginia Maid arrives in England from the New World, {{carrying}} the young Virginia Dare, {{the first child}} born in Roanoke colony, {{as well as her}} hulking, fair-skinned, blond Native American bodyguard Rojhaz. They are taken to meet the Queen only for a vulture-like assassin to snatch Virginia. Rojhaz quickly disables the attacker, but Virginia has transformed into a white gryphon. Rojhaz subdues Virginia, and Stephen Strange bespells her to human form before Fury sees her transformed. She has strange shapeshifting powers, and Strange suspects she is the cause of the disastrous weather. Fury interrogates one of the assassins to learn who sent him. He is <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is Otto von Doom, ruler of Latveria, but Fury is too late to stop one of Doom's machines from killing Elizabeth with a poison gas released by dropping a pill into aqua regia.|$|E

5|$|One further {{proposal}} {{was made to}} rebury Lody in the 1960s. In 1959 the British and German governments agreed to move German war dead who had been buried in various locations around the UK to a new central cemetery at Cannock Chase in Staffordshire. The German War Graves Commission (VDK) asked {{if it would be}} possible to disinter Lody's body and move it to Cannock Chase. By that time, the plot had been reused for further common graves, buried above Lody's body. The VDK was <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would not be possible to disinter the other bodies without the permission of the relatives, which would have been an almost impossible task where common graves were concerned. The {{proposal was}} abandoned and Lody's body remains at Plaistow.|$|E
5|$|Scully {{discovers that}} two worms put {{together}} will kill each other. When the investigators place {{one of the}} worms into the infected dog, it recovers. Against Scully's objections, Hodge and Da Silva try to place the other worm into Mulder and Hodge realizes that Da Silva is the infected person. He and Mulder restrain the hysterical Da Silva and place the last worm inside her. When they are rescued, Da Silva is quarantined {{and the others are}} released. Although Mulder wants to return to the site, he is <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> has been destroyed by the government.|$|E
5|$|The series—presented {{as if it}} were a real documentary—depicts the {{everyday}} lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In the episode, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) comes to work thinking he has a pimple, but it turns out to actually be a cold sore. When he is <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is a form of herpes, Michael contacts all his ex-girlfriends—Jan, Holly, Helene, Donna, and Carol. Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) holds a sex education meeting in the office hoping to learn if Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) is having sex with her boyfriend, Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods).|$|E
5000|$|Main {{messages}} of Pavićević's work are love, friendship and understanding. On 2012, Pavićević <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>it's</b> {{hard to be}} a poet because [...] "there is always someone who blames poets". Pavićević participated on numerous poetry nights in Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina. One of his most known songs is a Ballad to Mostar.|$|R
60|$|John Brimblecombe {{had great}} doubts whether a venture thus started by direct help and {{patronage}} of the fiend would succeed; and Amyas himself, disliking the humbug, <b>told</b> Ayacanora <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{would be better}} to have <b>told</b> the tribe <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was a good deed, and pleasing to the Good Spirit.|$|R
50|$|In prison, Ray Seward's lawyer (John Shaw) {{tells him}} that he was unable to reach Linden. Seward asks to change his {{execution}} method to lethal injection, but is <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>it's</b> too late to change his fate. While being led back to his cell, Seward suffers a panic attack. In a rare moment of compassion, Francis Becker (Hugh Dillon) calms him.|$|R
5|$|Using a {{captured}} Ottoman cannon, Morgan and Alain {{then drive}} the Ottomans from Malta and detonate Ottoman weapon caches {{in the nearby}} caves. Inside, they discover that the Ottomans were really interested in a hidden stone library {{telling the story of}} the Lake of the Moon, which contains the Fountain of Youth, a secret Native American relic which is <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> has the ability to give eternal life, and the secret society, called the Circle of Ossus, who seek it for their own gain. Alain orders Morgan to sail to the New World to search for the Lake, but Morgan is attacked by the Pirate Elizabet Ramsey (Lizzie the Pirate) and is forced to land in the Caribbean islands. After re-engaging and defeating Lizzie, Morgan's men find some navigation charts which guide them safely to New Spain.|$|E
5|$|About January 1843, on {{the orders}} of the acting Settlement Engineer, Captain D.H. Stevenson, the slab was blown to pieces to clear and widen the {{passageway}} at the Singapore River mouth to make space for Fort Fullerton and the quarters of its commander. Some sources claim that the Superintendent of Public Works, George Drumgoole Coleman, {{was responsible for the}} Stone's destruction, but he was on leave and not in Singapore {{at the time of its}} blasting. Lieutenant-Colonel James Low had petitioned to have the sandstone slab spared, but had been <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was in the way of a projected bungalow. On the explosion taking place, he crossed the river from his office and selected fragments that had letters on them. As the fragments were very bulky, he had them chiselled into small slabs by a Chinese man. He selected some of the smaller fragments bearing the most legible parts of the inscription and sent them to the Royal Asiatic Society's museum in Calcutta (now known as the Indian Museum) for analysis, where they arrived in about June 1848.|$|E
5|$|Although Hamilton became {{concerned}} about his Mercedes' brakes, he was <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was a relatively minor sensor problem. He and Vergne reported that conditions had improved, but Vettel and Massa said that visibility remained poor. The safety car drove into the pit lane {{at the end of}} the ninth lap, and the cars were allowed to overtake. Button immediately made a pit stop to fit intermediate tyres. Hamilton attempted to pass Rosberg heading into the first corner, but could not overtake him. Rosberg began to pull away from him; Vettel tried to pass Magnussen going into the hairpin, but was unable to complete the manoeuvre. He ran wide at the Spoon Curve, remaining on the track by running onto the kerb. Pérez overtook Kvyat to claim ninth position on the lap. At the end of the first racing lap, Rosberg led Hamilton by 1.3 seconds; Hamilton was followed by Bottas, Massa, Ricciardo, Magnussen, Vettel, Räikkönen, Pérez and Kvyat.|$|E

25|$|With the Cabinet {{apparently}} contemplating {{some kind}} of military action against the Ulster Volunteers, {{it was unclear whether}} the Director of Military Operations (responsible for operations abroad), the Adjutant-General (responsible for domestic aid to the civil power) or the Director of Military Training (DMT, responsible for home defence) was responsible for drawing up deployment plans. On the evening of 18 March Robertson, who had asked practical questions throughout, was <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was his responsibility as DMT.|$|E
25|$|The gunners {{soon found}} that it was {{difficult}} to traverse their guns quickly enough to engage the fast-moving Focke-Wulf Fw 190 fighter-bombers coming in low over the coast, often in poor visibility, to drop their bombs or fire their cannons on the towns. Junkers Ju 88s and Dornier Do 215 bombers at medium altitude were easier targets and 434 Bty claimed its first Ju 88 shot down on 20 October – but were <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was a friendly Beaufighter.|$|E

25|$|Many adults {{returned}} at {{the same}} time as the school children; however, some who had volunteered for the armed services were demobbed in 1946. The meetings of families could be equally traumatic, with wives and husbands meeting again for the first time in five years and discovering they had lived very different lives which were hard to talk about. Those who had been evacuated were <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was tougher in the islands. Alderney residents were not allowed to return to their island until December 1945.|$|E
25|$|Lucas Demare {{thought that}} January and February (summer) {{were the best}} months {{to work on the}} filming in Salta but they were <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was better to do it in winter due to summer being flood season. Demare {{travelled}} to Salta to reconnoiter the area. Later, the crew and equipment moved to an old estate and big house. They worked on a big ballroom and had two small rooms; each crewman had a cot and an upside down beer wooden box as night-stand. The actresses and Enrique Muiño, due to his age, stayed in a hotel.|$|E
25|$|In March 2007, Ran D Balicer, an {{epidemiologist}} {{physician at}} the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Beersheba, Israel, {{published an article}} in the journal Epidemiology that described the similarities between this outbreak and the recent SARS and avian influenza outbreaks. Dr Balicer suggested that role-playing games could serve as an advanced platform for modeling the dissemination of infectious diseases. In a follow-up article in the journal Science, the game Second Life was suggested as another possible platform for these studies. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention contacted Blizzard Entertainment and requested statistics on this event for research on epidemics but was <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was a glitch.|$|E

25|$|Lee next {{answered}} {{a question about}} homosexuality at a Young PAP meeting in 2007. The questioner was Loretta Chen, an openly lesbian young PAP member and a bilingual theatre director in Singapore. She asked if the current censorship rules in Singapore were too equivocal and where censorship was headed {{in the next two}} decades. Chen referred to a controversial play about Singaporean porn actress Annabel Chong, which explored pornography and alternative sexuality. Lee was then asked if he believed homosexuality was a product of nature or nurture. He replied that he had asked doctors about homosexuality and had been <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was caused by a genetic random transmission of genes.|$|E
25|$|With Ball, Arnaz founded Desilu Productions. At that time, most {{television}} programs were broadcast live, {{and as the}} largest markets were in New York, {{the rest of the}} country received only kinescope images. Karl Freund, Arnaz's cameraman, and even Arnaz himself have been credited with the development of the multiple-camera setup production style using adjacent sets in front of a live audience that became the standard for subsequent situation comedies. The use of film enabled every station around the country to broadcast high-quality images of the show. Arnaz was <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would be impossible to allow an audience onto a sound stage, but he worked with Freund to design a set that would accommodate an audience, allow filming, and adhere to fire and safety codes.|$|E
25|$|Before the {{district}} occupied the Fisher Building, its headquarters {{were in the}} Macabees Building in Midtown Detroit. The district paid {{the owner of the}} Fisher Building $24.1 million in 2002 so {{the district}} could occupy five floors in the building. This was more than the owner of the Fisher Building paid to buy the building one year earlier. The district's emergency financial manager, Robert Bobb, said in 2009 that he was investigating how the school board agreed to the lease in the Fisher Building. Reginald Turner, who served on Detroit School Board from 2000 to 2003, said that he was <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would be less expensive to occupy the Fisher Building than it would to remodel the Maccabees Building.|$|E
