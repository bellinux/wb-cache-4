5|$|Alvarez's {{aviation}} responsibilities led to many adventures. For example, {{while working}} on GCA {{he became the first}} civilian <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> <b>a</b> low approach with his view outside the cockpit obstructed. He also flew many military aircraft from the co-pilot's seat, including a B-29 Superfortress and a Lockheed F-104 Starfighter. In addition, he survived a crash during World War II as a passenger in a Miles Master.|$|E
5|$|Jessica Whitney Dubroff (May 5, 1988 – April 11, 1996) was {{a seven-year-old}} girl who died while {{attempting}} to become the youngest person <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> <b>a</b> light utility aircraft across the United States. On day-two of her quest, the Cessna 177B Cardinal single engine propeller aircraft, piloted by her flight instructor, crashed during a rainstorm immediately after takeoff from Cheyenne Regional Airport in Cheyenne, Wyoming, killing Dubroff, her 57-year-old father, and her flight instructor.|$|E
5|$|With Norway {{joining the}} European Economic Area, the Norwegian airline market was {{deregulated}} from 1 April 1994. While airlines formerly needed a concession from the Ministry of Transport <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> <b>a</b> particular route, they could now compete freely on any domestic or international routes. Previously {{the two major}} airlines Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) and Braathens SAFE each had their own routes, but from 1994 both established themselves on several of the main-haul routes.|$|E

5|$|No. 33 Squadron was {{immediately}} put on alert. At noon, Pattle was ordered <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> <b>a</b> fighter patrol over the Rupel Pass, Bulgaria, another Axis partner. Here {{he had his}} first encounter with the Luftwaffe. No. 33 Squadron attacked 20 Bf 109s and claimed five without loss. Pattle claimed two victories over Bf 109Es over the Rupel Pass —Oberleutnant Arno Becker was killed and Leutnant Klaus Faber was captured. These successes represented his 26th and 27th aerial victories. Thereafter, details vary as to his score as all records were destroyed.|$|E

5|$|The {{resulting}} Mk. XIV {{was first}} tested in June 1941. It {{was the first}} modern bombsight that allowed for accurate bombing immediately after radical manoeuvring, with a settling time as little as 10 seconds. The fast settling time was invaluable during night bombing missions, as it allowed the bomber <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> <b>a</b> corkscrew (a helical path), climbing and turning and then level out immediately before the drop. Even slow turns {{made it difficult for}} night fighters to track the bombers within the limited view of their radar systems and continually changing altitude was an effective way to avoid anti-aircraft fire.|$|E
5|$|There {{was still}} fog on the plateau on 1 September, but by 15:00 CEST it was {{possible}} <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> <b>a</b> team there by helicopter. Because the fog stayed, the team retained work until 03:00 CEST in the night. In the following days, the fog lifted, making work and transport easier. By 5 September, all bodies had been recovered and the work at the plateau could be terminated. The recovery in the valley was completed two days later. The accident resulted in about 40 journalists staying in Svalbard to cover the story. The Norwegian authority's costs related to the investigation and other activities related to the accident were estimated at 30 million Norwegian krone (NOK).|$|E

5|$|After {{establishing}} {{itself in}} India, XX Bomber Command {{under the command}} of Brigadier General Kenneth Wolfe undertook various tasks to prepare for raids against Japan. Foremost among these was stockpiling fuel at the airfields in China. Until late 1944, USAAF Air Transport Command aircraft did not transport fuel for XX Bomber Command, and this task was instead undertaken by the B-29s. This arrangement proved inefficient, however, as 12 B-29 sorties between India and China were needed to transport enough fuel and other supplies to enable one of the heavy bombers <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> <b>a</b> round trip between China and Japan. As a result, it took longer than expected to build up sufficient stockpiles in China to allow B-29 operations to commence. Moreover, continued technical problems with the Superfortress, and particularly their Wright R-3350 engines, resulted in many of XX Bomber Command's aircraft being unserviceable and in need of modification at all times.|$|E
5|$|Bretagne {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Arsenal de Brest on 1 July 1912, {{launched}} on 21 April 1913, and completed in September 1915. She was commissioned into the French Navy on 10 February 1916. After entering service in 1916, Bretagne and her sisters {{were assigned to the}} 1st Division of the 1st Battle Squadron, their unit {{for the remainder of the}} war, Bretagne becoming flagship of the squadron. They spent the majority of their time at Corfu to prevent the Austro-Hungarian fleet from attempting to break out of the Adriatic. The fleet's presence was also intended to intimidate Greece, which had become increasingly hostile to the Triple Entente. Later in the war, men were drawn from their crews for anti-submarine warfare vessels. As the Austro-Hungarians largely remained in port for the duration of the war, Bretagne saw no action during the conflict. Indeed, she did not leave port at all for the entirety of 1917, due to a severe shortage of coal at Corfu. Around July 1918, the ship's foremast was replaced by a tripod foremast that mounted an experimental fire-control director and her mainmast was shortened to allow the ship <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> <b>a</b> captive kite balloon. Bretagne returned to Toulon in November 1918.|$|E
5|$|Had Flight 19 {{actually}} been where Taylor believed it to be, the flight {{would have made}} landfall with the Florida coastline within 20 minutes, depending on how far down they were. However, a later reconstruction of the incident showed that the islands visible to Taylor were probably the Bahamas, well northeast of the Keys, and that Flight 19 was exactly where it should have been. The board of investigation found that because of his belief {{that he was on}} a base course toward Florida, Taylor actually guided the flight farther northeast and out to sea. Further, it was general knowledge at NAS Fort Lauderdale that if a pilot ever became lost in the area <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> <b>a</b> heading of 270° west (or in evening hours toward the sunset if the compass had failed). By the time the flight actually turned west, they were likely so far out to sea they had already passed their aircraft's fuel endurance. This factor combined with bad weather, and the ditching characteristics of the Avenger, meant that there was little hope of rescue, even if they had managed to stay afloat.|$|E

5|$|Idaho {{returned}} to the peacetime routine of fleet exercises {{over the next five}} years; these were held off the coast of North and South America, as far south as Chile. The ship was also present for a variety of ceremonies during this period, including a Naval Review for President Warren Harding in Seattle in 1923. The Pacific Fleet was reorganized as the Battle Fleet in 1922. She took part in major exercises off Hawaii in 1925, departing California on 15 April. The exercises lasted until 1 July, after which Idaho embarked on a cruise to the southern Pacific. Stops included Samoa, Australia, and New Zealand. While returning from Hawaii to California, she carried Commander John Rodgers, who had failed in his attempt <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> <b>a</b> seaplane from California to Hawaii. The ship reached San Francisco on 24 September. For the next six years, Idaho was based in San Pedro, where she continued to conduct readiness training, alternating between the Pacific and the Caribbean Sea.|$|E
5|$|In February 1999, Braathens {{announced}} that they would re-register all their planes in Sweden {{to avoid having to}} pay value added tax on catering and fuel. Color Air and SAS, who had their planes registered abroad, had gotten away without paying the taxes, since it only applied to Norway-registered planes. Following this announcement, the Ministry of Finance changed the rules so also foreign-owned planes had to pay the tax. The change in rules cost Color Air NOK10 million per plane per year. From 1 July 1999, the seat tax was removed, but replaced by an equivalent tax for each passenger. This made it cheaper to fly an empty plane, but more expensive <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> <b>a</b> full one. Color Air had reduced the number of seats in each plane to avoid the seat tax, but increased them again after the tax was removed.|$|E
5|$|In November 1996, Blancornelas was {{planning}} to visit New York City to receive an international award {{for his work in}} covering the drug trade, political corruption, and the relationship between the drug lords and the police. A few days before he was about <b>to</b> <b>fly,</b> <b>a</b> policeman in Tijuana visited Blancornelas and warned him that he was risking his life if he decided to go. A year later, the warning proved to be true: in 1997 in Tijuana, Blancornelas was ambushed and wounded by gunmen of the Tijuana Cartel while heading to the airport for publishing a photo of the drug lord Ramón Arellano Félix. Blancornelas was nearly killed when the attackers opened fire on his car, wounding him in the abdomen and killing his driver and bodyguard, Luis Valero Elizalde, who died protecting him and managed to kill one of the shooters. Blancornelas suffered complications from the injury {{for the rest of his}} life. In the attack, Blancornelas' car was hit more than 180 times, but only four bullets penetrated the journalist's body. Elizalde, however, was hit 38 times. That same year, three other prominent journalists were killed in Mexico.|$|E

5|$|Kalep took up {{flying in}} the late 1920s, when she met Dutch aviator Anthony Fokker while holidaying in St. Moritz {{and asked him to}} teach her <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> <b>a</b> plane. She {{completed}} five hours of flying with Fokker and, after breaking her arm during a sledding accident in the winter of 1931, took her pilot's test in Germany on 1 August 1931. She passed, becoming the first qualified female pilot from Estonia, and the seventh woman to pass the exam in Germany. Soon after receiving her license, Kalep and Valter Mayer, a German mechanic, co-piloted a small Klemm plane from Berlin through Eastern Europe, stopping in Szczecin, Gdańsk, Kaunas, Jelgava and Riga, finally landing in Tallinn on 18 August. Upon her arrival in Tallinn, Kalep was greeted by a crowd of journalists and officers of the Estonian Air Force; she briefly visited relatives in Nõmme before beginning her return journey to Amsterdam.|$|E
5|$|The Gemini Lunar Surface Rescue Spacecraft was {{intended}} <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> <b>a</b> direct ascent mission, launched by a Saturn V. Descent stages, built {{from either the}} descent stage of the Apollo Lunar Module, or from the Apollo Service Module, would have reduced the spacecraft's velocity as it approached the Moon.

The other configuration used three LEM descent stages, with the second being used for landing and the third for ascent and TEI. The LSRS would have landed close to the Apollo Lunar Module on the Moon, and the Apollo crew would have transferred to it by EVA.|$|E
5|$|To {{make her}} {{performances}} {{as a female}} boxer look realistic, Oreiro trained regularly with the renowned boxer Marcela Acuña and her coach Ramón Chaparro. They taught Oreiro how to stand and move in the ring {{and how to make}} various types of strokes, and she underwent cardiovascular and weight training. Acuña commented that Oreiro mastered the basic techniques more quickly than most beginner boxers. For this training, Oreiro temporarily gave up her vegetarian diet. Another plot required the characters <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> <b>a</b> Piper Tomahawk airplane and make an emergency landing. This was risky filming, and Arana and Oreiro did not use stunt doubles for it. The scene, which was {{the first of its kind}} in a daily Argentine telenovela, required four professional pilots, five special effects experts, and two additional aircraft used for filming the main aircraft from the outside. Arana was advised by the pilot Alberto Di Giorgio.|$|E
