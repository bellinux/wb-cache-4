5000|$|Because early {{generations of}} phototypesetters could not change text size and font easily, many {{composing}} rooms and print shops had special machines designed <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>display</b> type or headlines. One such {{model is the}} PhotoTypositor, manufactured by Visual Graphics Corporation, which lets the user position each letter visually and thus retain complete control over kerning. Compugraphic's model 7200 uses the [...] "strobe-through-a-filmstrip-through-a-lens" [...] technology to expose letters and characters onto a thin strip of phototypesetting paper that is then developed by a photo processor.|$|R

50|$|The {{address is}} also updated by the Operating System's Vertical Blank Interrupt (VBI) routine using the values from Operation System shadow {{registers}} SDLSTL/SDLSTH ($0230-$0231hex/560-561dec). When the OS VBI routine is enabled direct updates to the ANTIC DLIST registers by the CPU or the ANTIC Jump instructions will be overwritten by the OS {{during the next}} Vertical Blank. Since VBI processing is the usual state of the system, most programs rely on this and only update the OS shadow registers (SDLSTL/SDLSTH $0230-$0231hex/560-561dec) <b>to</b> <b>set</b> the <b>Display</b> List.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a digital control system for swinging arc narrow gap MAG welding based on double single-chip microcomputers. The control system utilizes a single-chip microcomputer <b>to</b> <b>set</b> and <b>display</b> welding process parameters, and then uses another single-chip microcomputer {{to realize the}} control functions that are necessary for the swing arc process, {{in which the two}} single-chip microcomputers can exchange data through asynchronous serial communication circuit. Experimental results show that the control system works stably and reliably with strong anti-interference capabilities, and can completely satisfy the requirements of swinging arc narrow gap welding process...|$|R

5000|$|When {{the display}} of {{destination}} headcodes/reporting numbers {{on the front of}} trains was dropped in 1976, the instruction was given for them all <b>to</b> be <b>set</b> <b>to</b> [...] "0000". On many Westerns, the headcode was <b>set</b> <b>to</b> <b>display</b> the loco's number in contravention of this directive and most surviving members of the class ran like this until they were scrapped. If used for routeing, such reporting numbers would be interpreted as a passenger express terminating on the Southern Region.|$|R
50|$|A yard haunt is a {{house that}} is elaborately {{decorated}} to celebrate Halloween. Yards may feature fake tombstones, skulls, large inflatable characters, plastic light-up figures (aka blowmolds), strobe lights, fog machines, cobwebs, spooky music, animatronics and decor that can easily be purchased at a local Halloween store. Some home owners even create their own homemade props <b>to</b> <b>set</b> their <b>display</b> apart from other houses, while others synchronize their display to music using computer programs such as Light-O-Rama, Animated Lighting and other programs. Some displays utilize an FM transmitter so people can park their car, locate a low-frequency radio station and watch the show without it disturbing the neighbors.|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} ATM {{was created}} for the Apple Macintosh computer platform to scale PostScript Type 1 fonts for the computer monitor, and for printing to non-PostScript printers. Mac Type 1 fonts come with screen fonts <b>set</b> <b>to</b> <b>display</b> at certain point sizes only. In Macintosh operating systems prior to Mac OS X, Type 1 fonts set at other sizes would appear jagged on the monitor. ATM allowed Type 1 fonts to appear smooth at any point size, and to print well to non-PostScript devices.|$|R
40|$|Large {{high-resolution}} displays {{combine the}} images of multiple smaller display devices to form one large display area. A total resolution that can easily comprise several hundred megapixels makes them suited for the visualization of data sets {{that could not be}} perceived entirely on desktop PCs or laptops due to their size. At the same time, user collaboration benefits from an extended screen area that facilitates interaction with screen contents as well as interaction among users. This paper discusses the challenges and opportunities of large high-resolution displays and examines ways <b>to</b> <b>set</b> up <b>display</b> clusters both in terms of hardware and underlying software technology. Furthermore, it investigates how to effectively harness the computational power and resources of rendering clusters to visualize giga-scale data sets. Last but not least, traditional interaction metaphors and their scalability to large displays as well as the effect of new techniques on the user experience are discussed...|$|R
50|$|Monospaced fonts {{were widely}} used in early {{computers}} and computer terminals, which often had extremely limited graphical capabilities. Hardware implementation was simplified by using a text mode where the screen layout was addressed as a regular grid of tiles, each {{of which could be}} <b>set</b> <b>to</b> <b>display</b> a character by indexing into the hardware's character map. Some systems allowed colored text to be displayed by varying the foreground and background color for each tile. Other effects included reverse video and blinking text. Nevertheless, these early systems were typically limited to a single console font.|$|R
