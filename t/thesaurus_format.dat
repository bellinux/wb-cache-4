50|$|The Llista d’encapçalaments de matèria en català is {{the result}} of the {{translation}} of the Lista de encabezamientos de materia para bibliotecas by Carmen Rovira and Jorge Aguayo, and of the adaptation of the Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH). LEMAC was initially created by the Institut Català de Bibliografia in 1983 and continued later by the National Library of Catalonia. The Lista de encabezamientos de materia para bibliotecas is the Hispanoamerican adaptation of LCSH and was of common use in Spain when the Catalan Government decided to translate it to Catalan language at the late eighties.There are other subject headings lists that are also used or searched to create the LEMAC authority records, such as the Répertoire de vedettes-matière of the Université de Laval (Laval RVM), which is the Canadian accepted rule by the National Library of Canada and, above all, the, inspired on the Canadian version, which is the official subject headings authority list in France.In December 1999, the Llista d’encapçalaments de matèria en català (LEMAC) was codified to machine readable format. In April 2002, it was made available online through the National Library of Catalonia website. LEMAC subject authority records may be viewed in <b>thesaurus</b> <b>format</b> or in MARC21 code.|$|E
40|$|Thesauri are tools which semantically {{organize}} a domain of knowledge for operational purposes. Their relational semantics {{is concerned with}} methods that connect terms with related meanings and are designed to support information retrieval, namely enhancing the information recall performance and contributing to improve precision, too. The network of relations of a thesaurus has a semantic function: by means of it, in fact, {{a representation of the}} meaning of each thesaurus term is provided, {{as well as of the}} conceptual structure of a subject area: "a good thesaurus provides, through its hierarchy augmented by associative relationships between concepts, a semantic road map for searchers and indexers and anybody else interested in an orderly grasp of a subject field" (Soergel 1995, 369). The traditional <b>thesaurus</b> <b>format</b> - as described in international standards - includes three basic relationships, two of then at a conceptual level, hierarchical and associative relations, the other mostly at a lexical level, relation of equivalence. However, a rather widespread opinion is that this format should e refined, in order to cope with the current needs of information organization. This refinement is necessary to enhance thesaurus suitability for uses in artificial intelligence (AI) and in the Semantic Web encironments, as well as to increase possibilities for IR. This paper discusses the possibility of refining the associative relation into a number of sub-kinds by adopting the semantic model of EuroWordNet (EWN), to structure a terminological resource for a specific domain. A number of issues that such a work of refinement could imply, and in particular its domain dependence, are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|Highly {{structured}} and refined, but flexible tools {{are needed to}} deal with issues as the information management on the web and the semantic interoperability. Many issues {{in the field of}} knowledge organisation and information management {{can be traced back to}} meaning delimitation. There are opposite needs and tendencies: on one hand there’s the necessity to share a common and stable meaning of the terms in order to guarantee communication within a community. On the other hand, openness to further exploration of meaning should also be ensured to do not impoverish its richness and complexity. The term “benzene” could be defined in different ways. A biologist may consider its toxicity and the different routes on which it can enter an organism. An engineer would consider it as a fuel for combustion engine. A physicist may see it as a volatile and inflammable liquid. A fire brigade can consider benzene as a dangerous inflammable substance that cannot be extinguished by water, but only with foam. A chemist may see it as the precursor of a class of chemical compounds, etc. Benzene could be thus defined in several different ways depending on the context in which it is considered. But we should also underline that all these definitions share a common premise: “benzene” is first of all a substance (that can have toxic effects, be used as fuel, that can also cause accidents, etc.). This semantic trait seems to be unavoidable. Starting from this premise and referring also to suggestions coming from the development of applied ontologies a new environmental <b>thesaurus</b> <b>format</b> containing some innovative elements has been designed and is currently available. The goal is the development of a thesaurus aiming to become an advanced tool to be applied for environmental information management, to sustain environmental policy and research. To achieve this result EARTh has been conceived as a tool able to deal with the specific features of the environment sector (multidisciplinary character, high complexity, bio-cultural implications, etc.). In this paper the EARTh component dealing with environmental pollution and heath is presented...|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{continues}} the successful parsing experiments with {{the method of}} Segmentation-Cohesion-Dependency (SCD) configurations, a breadth-first, formal grammar-free, and optimal approach to dictionary entry parsing, proposed in the previous CogALex Workshops and applied to the following five very large thesaurus-dictionaries: DLR (The Romanian <b>Thesaurus</b> – new <b>format),</b> DAR (The Romanian <b>Thesaurus</b> – old <b>format),</b> TLF (Le Trésor de l...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a cross-linguistic {{analysis of the}} largest dictionaries currently existing for Romanian, French, and German, and a new, robust and portable method for Dictionary Entry Parsing (DEP), based on Segmentation-Cohesion-Dependency (SCD) configurations. The SCD configurations are applied successively on each dictionary entry to identify its lexicographic segments (the first SCD configuration), to extract its sense tree (the second configuration), and to parse its atomic sense definitions (the third one). Using previous results on DLR (The Romanian <b>Thesaurus</b> – new <b>format),</b> the present paper adapts and applies the SCD-based technology to other four large and complex thesauri: DAR (The Romanian <b>Thesaurus</b> – old <b>format),</b> TLF (Le Trésor de la Langue Française) ...|$|R

In the LIMBER project CCLRC further {{developed}} an RDF <b>thesaurus</b> interchange <b>format</b> which was demonstrated on the European Language Social Science Thesaurus (ELSST) at the UK Data Archive as a multilingual version of the English language Humanities and Social Science Electronic Thesaurus (HASSET) which was planned to be used by the Council of European Social Science Data Archives CESSDA.|$|R
40|$|In this poster we {{introduce}} ProThes, a pilot meta-search engine (MSE) for {{a specific}} application domain. ProThes combines three approaches: meta-search, graphical user interface (GUI) for query attempts to employ domain-specific knowledge, which is represented by both a conceptual thesaurus and results ranking heuristics. Since the knowledge representation is separated from the MSE core, adjusting the system to a specific domain is trouble free. Thesaurus allows for manual query building and automatic query techniques. This poster outlines the overall system architecture, <b>thesaurus</b> representation <b>format,</b> and query operations. ProThes is implemented on J 2 EE platform as a Web service...|$|R
5000|$|Version 4.0 {{included}} a fully functional word processor - Q&A Write - {{that could be}} launched from Q&A or used as a stand-alone application. Q&A Write featured a 100,000 word spell check, a 660,000 word <b>thesaurus,</b> a dictionary, <b>formatting</b> options such as page layout, columnar formatting, automatic page numbering and headers, as well as support for the addition of graphics. Additionally, it offered multifont printing support {{and the ability to}} hot-link elements of a Lotus 1-2-3 document, Symphony spreadsheet or Lotus PIC graphs, to Q&A Write documents. Macros could be stored in an ASCII text file created with a text editor, Q&A Write or by recording keys; the Macro Menu could be accessed from many locations by pressing Shift-F2.|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} {{theoretical}} and methodological foundations {{for the development}} of a multi-agent SDI service model for specialized digital libraries, applying semantic web technologies that permit more efficient information management, improving agent-user communication processes and facilitating accurate access to relevant resources. To do this, rss feeds are used as "current awareness bulletins" to generate personalized bibliographic alerts. The SDI service model has an rss feeds management module and an information push module. In the first module, resources are represented as rss feed items and are also semi-automatically assigned subject terms by matching their associated keywords against the terms of a SKOS Core <b>format</b> <b>thesaurus.</b> In the information push module, bibliographic alerts are customized according to the preferences defined on users' profiles...|$|R
