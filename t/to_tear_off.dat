5|$|The {{interface}} and gameplay style do {{not differ}} much from the previous title. MediEvil 2 sees the player once again in control of Sir Daniel Fortesque, who can use various forms of weaponry, such as close range swords and clubs to long-range crossbows or catapults. The game contains several of the original forms of gameplay, weaponry, and graphics that {{were present in the}} first instalment of the series. Similar to its predecessor, Dan is able <b>to</b> <b>tear</b> <b>off</b> his skeletal arm {{and use it as a}} club to fight off enemies during the early levels. Whilst featuring many of the classic swords and other medieval weaponry, new weapons featured in MediEvil 2 include pistols, shotguns and Gatling guns.|$|E
25|$|Gilliam and Lamp {{were driven}} to the San Gabriel Mountains, where they were held captive for almost two days, being bound and gagged between {{repeated}} instances of sexual and physical abuse. Both men slept in the van alongside their two hostages, with each alternatively acting as a lookout. On one occasion, Bittaker walked Lamp onto a nearby hill and forced her to pose for pornographic pictures before returning her to the van. Bittaker also informed Norris to take several Polaroid pictures of himself and Gilliam, both nude and clothed. In {{the first of three}} instances in which Bittaker raped Gilliam, he also created a tape recording of himself raping her, forcing the girl to pretend she was his cousin and informing Gilliam to feel free to express her pain. (Bittaker later claimed he buried the tape in a cemetery. The tape recording of Gilliam's rape was never found.) Bittaker is also known to have tortured Gilliam by stabbing her breasts with an ice pick and using vise grip pliers <b>to</b> <b>tear</b> <b>off</b> part of one nipple.|$|E
25|$|In 1001, Basil II sent a large army {{under the}} patrician Theodorokanos and Nikephoros Xiphias {{to the north}} of the Balkan Mountains to seize the main Bulgarian fortresses in the area. The Byzantine troops recaptured Preslav and Pliska, putting {{north-eastern}} Bulgaria once again under Byzantine rule. The following year, they struck in the opposite direction, marching through Thessaloniki <b>to</b> <b>tear</b> <b>off</b> Thessaly and the southernmost parts of the Bulgarian Empire. Although the Bulgarian commander of the fortress of Veroia, Dobromir, was married to one of Samuel's nieces, he voluntarily surrendered the fort and joined the Byzantines. The Byzantines also captured the fortress of Kolidron without a fight, but its commander Dimitar Tihon managed to retreat with his soldiers and join Samuel. The next town, Servia, did not fall so easily; its governor Nikulitsa organized the defenders well. They fought until the Byzantines penetrated the walls and forced them to surrender. Nikulitsa was taken to Constantinople and given the high court title of patrician, but he soon escaped and rejoined the Bulgarians. He attempted to retake Servia, but the siege was unsuccessful and he was captured again and imprisoned.|$|E

Duryodhana said he would not give land even as much as tip of a needle to the Pandavas. Krishna's peace proposals were ignored & dismissed, and Duryodhana publicly ordered his soldiers, even after the warnings from all the elders, to arrest Krishna. Krishna laughed and displayed his divine form, radiating intense light. Lord Krishna cursed Duryodhana that his downfall was certain {{at the hands of the}} one who was sworn <b>to</b> <b>tear</b> <b>off</b> his thigh, to the shock of the blind king, who tried to pacify the Lord with as words to calm as he could find. His peace mission utterly insulted by Duryodhana, Krishna returned to the Pandava camp at Upaplavya to inform the Pandavas that the only course left to uphold the principles of virtue and righteousness was inevitable - war. During the course of his return, Krishna met Karna, Kunti's firstborn(before Yudhishthira) and requested him to help his brothers & fight on the side of dharma. However, being helped by Duryodhana, Karna said to Krishna that he would battle against Pandavas as he had a debt to pay.|$|E
500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the debacle Nicholson returned to London, taking four Indian chiefs with him, and petitioned Queen Anne for permission to lead a more limited expedition against Port Royal, the capital of French Acadia. [...] The Queen granted the petition, and Nicholson {{was in charge of the}} forces that captured Port Royal on 2 October 1710. [...] This battle marked the conquest of Acadia, and began permanent British control over the territory they called Nova Scotia. [...] Nicholson published an account of the expedition in his 1711 Journal of an Expedition for the Reduction of Port Royal. The victorious Nicholson returned to England to petition Queen Anne for another expedition to capture the center of New France, Quebec. [...] The resulting naval expedition was led by Admiral Hovenden Walker, and Nicholson led an associated land expedition that retraced the route he had taken in 1709 toward Lake Champlain. [...] Many ships of Walker's fleet foundered on rocks near the mouth of the Saint Lawrence River, and the whole expedition was cancelled, much to Nicholson's anger; he was reported <b>to</b> <b>tear</b> <b>off</b> his wig and throw it to the ground when he heard the news.|$|E
500|$|A {{turning point}} in Sellers's {{flailing}} career came in 1974, when he teamed up with Blake Edwards to make The Return of the Pink Panther, starring alongside Christopher Plummer, Herbert Lom and Catherine Schell. The film was shot on a budget of £3 million and earned $33 million {{at the box office}} upon release in May 1975, reinvigorating Sellers's career as an A-list film star and restoring his millionaire status. The film earned Sellers a nomination for the Best Actor– Musical or Comedy award at the 33rd Golden Globe Awards. In 1976, he followed it with The Pink Panther Strikes Again. During the filming from February to June 1976, the already fraught relationship between Sellers and Blake Edwards had seriously deteriorated. Edwards says of the actor's mental state at the time of The Pink Panther Strikes Again, [...] "If you went to an asylum and you described the first inmate you saw, that's what Peter had become. He was certifiable." [...] With declining physical health, Sellers could at times be unbearable on set. His behaviour was regarded as unprofessional and childish, and he frequently threw tantrums, often threatening to abandon projects. Peter Evans mentioned that Sellers was a [...] "volatile and perplexing character [...] left a trail of misery in his private life". He also noted that Sellers had a [...] "compulsive personality and [...] an eccentric hypochondriac" [...] who became addicted to various medicines aside from his recreational drug habits during this period. His difficult behaviour during productions was widely reported and made it more difficult for Sellers to get employment in the industry {{at a time when he}} most needed the work. Despite Sellers's deep personal problems, The Pink Panther Strikes Again was well received critically. Vincent Canby of The New York Times said of Sellers in the film, [...] "There is, too, something most winningly seedy about Mr. Sellers' Clouseau, a fellow who, when he attempts <b>to</b> <b>tear</b> <b>off</b> his clothes in the heat of passion, gets tangled up in his necktie, and who, when he masquerades—for reasons never gone into—as Quasimodo, overinflates his hump with helium." [...] Sellers's performance earned him a further nomination at the 34th Golden Globe Awards.|$|E

500|$|Mileena is {{physically}} identical to Kitana, the most glaring exception being her half-Tarkata face with large and exposed fang-like teeth (which got noticeably downsized for Deception and Armageddon). Boon described Mileena as [...] "Anti-Kitana" [...] {{and said that}} her large [...] "sharp, nasty teeth" [...] have been not originally planned and were only drawn for her infamous Fatality [...] "Man-Eater" [...] (featured in Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, too), in which she sucks up the entire body of her victims and then regurgitates their clean bones. After Mortal Kombat II, her teeth were almost never used again during gameplay until Mortal Kombat 2011 (in a leap attack to bite an opponent in the neck and in one Fatality to gnaw on the killed enemy's severed head), with a sole exception of one Fatality in Deception in which she uses them <b>to</b> <b>tear</b> <b>off</b> the opponent's head. Mileena's skin color appears to be at times mildly darker than Kitana's, but is always lighter than Jade's. After the two were given more varying appearances in Mortal Kombat Gold (hairstyle for Kitana-derived characters is loose in Mortal Kombat II and pinned back in Ultimate MK3), Mileena's hair is usually much shorter than Kitana's and is most often worn gathered in a ponytail. One element of Mileena's anatomy that has often changed is her eyes. As her supposed twin sister, Mileena shared Kitana's eyes in Mortal Kombat II; her eyes then became [...] "undead" [...] style all-white (similar to the eyes of Scorpion and Noob Saibot) in Ultimate MK3. In Deception, Armageddon and Shaolin Monks, Mileena's eyes return to normal, but with yellow pupils (Kitana's eyes are brown). In Mortal Kombat 2011, however, she has Baraka-like yellow eyes with slit pupils (her eyes are also sometimes seen as glowing whole), except of her alternate Ultimate MK3 style costume (available through pre-order bonuses and later in a DLC package) in which she has human eyes once again. In Mortal Kombat X, her facial appearance has undergone drastic changes on her facial appearance based on those from Mortal Kombat Legacy live-action series, such as having a human-like mouth, yet still retain most of her Tarkatan mouth, as seen on both of her cheeks.|$|E

2500|$|The pale-white Neomorph is {{featured}} in [...] It was created through exposure to spores found {{growing on the}} Engineer homeworld. The embryronic Neomorph then gestates inside the host, until it bursts out of its host's back, throat, or possibly other areas, using mostly its head, which is sharp and pointed, similar to the Deacon. Like the Xenomorph XX121, the Neomorph has a tail, which is strong enough <b>to</b> <b>tear</b> <b>off</b> a human jaw. The Neomorph is a less weaponized version of the Xenomorph XX121, and lacks the facial features and biomechanical traits of the XX121. The Neomorph is far more feral than traditional Xenomorph XX121. They are voracious predators, often eating the corpses of their victims. Also, unlike the Xenomorph XX121, the Neomorph appears to lack a hive structure, since they propagate through mutated mammal life.|$|E

40|$|Cements {{used for}} seating fixed {{dentures}} {{are expected to}} have some definite resistance <b>to</b> <b>tearing</b> <b>off</b> and impact loads. It seems that these features may significantly influence the effective adhesion of a crown or bridge. For final seating of dentures both phosphate and glassionomer cements, which are a more recent invention, are used. The aim of this work was to compare two cements from the phosphate group with two cements from the glassionomere group with respect <b>to</b> their <b>tearing</b> <b>off</b> resistance and resistance to impact loads. The experiment was conducted in vitro. In the test for <b>tearing</b> <b>off</b> resistance Osteoplant implant was used as the abutment. The crown was a cast chrome- nickel substructure. The Raustein FM 250 was used for registration of this phenomenon. Six tests for tearing were conducted for each cement. A special device was constructed to test resistance to impact loads. The abutment was made of brass. After coating with a layer of varnish the substructure was contoured as a wax pattern and then cast in Remanium CS alloy. This metal substructure had additional handles for easier manipulation. Six tests were made for each material. When analyzing the results we found significant differences between the values of tearing resistance of the cements from the two groups (the average tearimg resistance for 1. Harv. Phosp. 183. 3 N; 2. Poscal 273. 5 N; 3. Rely X 27. 8 N; 4. GC Fuji I 19 N). Significant differences were also observed when impact load resistance was tested...|$|R

2500|$|On the Raw Is War after Austin won the WWF Championship, Vince McMahon {{presented}} him with a new title belt and warned Austin {{that he did not}} approve of his rebellious nature and that things could be done [...] "the easy way or the hard way". Austin gave his answer in the form of another Stone Cold Stunner. This led to a segment a week later where Austin had pledged a few days prior in a meeting to [...] "play ball" [...] with McMahon, appearing in a suit and tie, with a beaming McMahon taking a picture of himself and his new corporate champion. The entire thing was a ruse by Austin who {{in the course of the}} segment proceeded <b>to</b> <b>tear</b> <b>off</b> the suit, tell McMahon it was the last time he would see Austin dressed like this, punch his boss in the [...] "corporate grapefruits" [...] and take another picture of the two of them while McMahon was doubled over in pain. In April 1998, it appeared Austin and McMahon were going to battle out their differences in an actual match, but the match was declared a no contest when Dude Love made an appearance. This led to a match between Dude Love and Austin at , where Austin hit McMahon with a steel chair, then the following month they had a rematch at [...] for the WWF Championship. Austin managed to retain the title despite McMahon acting as the referee and his [...] "Corporate Stooges" [...] (Gerald Brisco and Pat Patterson) as timekeeper and ring announcer, respectively. McMahon continued to do everything he could to ruin Austin and he finally scored a big victory for his side at King of the Ring, where Austin lost the WWF Championship to Kane in a First Blood match after the Undertaker intervened and hit him with a chair while the ref was incapacitated, despite Austin having knocked Kane unconscious and thwarted an earlier intervention by Mankind.|$|E
