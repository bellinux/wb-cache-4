All three thrust chambers of the XLR67 were operated during the missile's boost phase which could last up to two minutes. At {{the conclusion of the}} boost phase the upper and lower chambers of the XLR-67 were shut down and thrust was sustained by the center chamber alone. Fuel for the XLR-67 included [...] of white fuming nitric acid oxidizer and [...] of JP-4 jet fuel. The oxidizer was stored in a series of <b>tube</b> <b>bundles</b> instead of a spherical storage tank. It is believed this configuration was chosen because it weighed less than a spherical tank of the same volume. Propellant was provided to the thrust chambers by a turbine driven propellant pump. A gas generator powered the propellant pump. The propellants were glow plug ignited. Bell contracted with Purdue University for the glow plug ignition system. Aerojet provided the pump drive assemblies.|$|E

However, Flow-induced vibration has been {{proved to be a}} positive role on heat transfer enhancement [9 – 11].

The value of stress at dangerous point is various with the vibration of planar elastic <b>tube</b> <b>bundle.</b> As a result, the fatigue failure will occur due to the alternating stress concentration in planar elastic <b>tube</b> <b>bundle.</b> It is verified that the planar elastic <b>tube</b> <b>bundle</b> suffers from bending stress and torsional stress.

30|$|Flow-induced {{vibration}} plays {{a positive}} role on heat transfer enhancement. Meanwhile, {{it is also}} a negative factor for fatigue strength. Satisfying the fatigue strength is the primary prerequisite for heat transfer enhancement. This paper numerically studied the flow-induced vibration of planar elastic <b>tube</b> <b>bundle</b> based on a two-way fluid–structure interaction (FSI) calculation. The numerical calculation involved the unsteady, three-dimensional incompressible governing equations solved with finite volume approach and the dynamic balance equation of planar elastic <b>tube</b> <b>bundle</b> solved with finite element method combined with dynamic mesh scheme. The numerical approach was verified by comparing with the published experimental results. Then the vibration trajectory, deformation and stress contour of planar elastic <b>tube</b> <b>bundle</b> were all studied. Results show that the combined movement of planar elastic <b>tube</b> <b>bundle</b> represents the agitation from inside to outside. The vibration of out-of-plane is the main vibration form with the typically sinusoidal behavior because the magnitude of displacement along the out-of-plane direction is the 100 times than the value of in-plane direction. The dangerous point locates in the innermost tube where the equivalent stress can be utilized to study the multiaxial fatigue of planar elastic <b>tube</b> <b>bundle</b> due to the alternating stress concentration. In the velocity range of 0.2 ‒ 3  m/s, it is inferred that the vibration amplitude plays a role on the stress response and the stress amplitude is susceptible to the fluid velocity. This research paves a way for studying the fatigue strength of planar elastic <b>tube</b> <b>bundle</b> by flow-induced vibration.|$|R

There is a retaining wall or overflow weir separating the <b>tube</b> <b>bundle</b> from the reboiler section where the residual reboiled liquid (called the bottoms product) is withdrawn, so that the <b>tube</b> <b>bundle</b> is kept covered with liquid and reduce the amount of low-boiling compounds in the bottoms product.|$|R

The PCCS condenser {{must be able to}} remove sufficient energy from the reactor containment to prevent containment from exceeding its design pressure following a design basis accident. The presence of noncondensable gas in the vapor can greatly reduce the performance of condensers. Hence a detailed knowledge of the heat removal performance of the PCCS in the presence of noncondensable gas is crucial for the safety and design optimization of the ESBWR. ^ Condensation experiments were performed for a vertical 4 <b>tubes</b> <b>bundle</b> submerged in a water pool.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} {{is to make the}} design of the heat {{exchanger}} more accurate. It is assumed that the division of the <b>tube</b> <b>bundle</b> of the heat exchanger to a plurality of parts by the transferred thermal output can achieve more accurate values. The first part of this thesis is dedicated to the sorting of the heat exchangers according to different criteria, and a brief description of most of them. It describes what are their functions and what are the demands placed on them. Next, there is given {{a detailed description of the}} tubular heat exchanger, specifically the mantle one because it is fundamental for this thesis. To investigate the influence of calculation accuracy, there is selected a reference heat exchanger, which processes the study. There are described the main characteristics for the reference heat exchanger (transferred thermal output, heat transfer fluids, their temperature on inputs and outputs) and its construction (geometry of the heat exchanger, number of tubes, tube geometry). The thesis also discusses the influence of calculation accuracy of the heat exchanger at its parameters.

40|$|Water flowing on a {{sprinkled}} <b>tube</b> <b>bundle</b> forms {{three basic}} modes: It is the Droplet mode (liquid drips from one tube to another), the Jet mode (with an increasing flow rate droplets merge into a column) and the Membrane (Sheet) mode (with further increasing of falling film liquid flow rate columns merge and create sheets between the tubes. With sufficient flow rate sheets merge at this {{state and the}} <b>tube</b> <b>bundle</b> is completely covered by a thin liquid film). There are several factors influencing the individual mode types as well as heat transfer. Beside the above mentioned falling film liquid flow rate they are for instance tube diameters, tube pitches in a <b>tube</b> <b>bundle</b> or a physical condition of a falling film liquid. This paper presents a summary of data measured at atmospheric pressure at a <b>tube</b> <b>bundle</b> consisting of copper tubes of 12 milimeters diameter and of the studied tube length one meter. The tubes are positioned horizontally one above another with the tested pitches of 15, 20, 25 and 30 mm {{and there is a}} distribution tube placed above them with water flowing out.
