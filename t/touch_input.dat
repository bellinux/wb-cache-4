500|$|Most early Windows Mobile devices {{came with}} a stylus, {{which can be used}} to enter {{commands}} by tapping it on the screen. The primary <b>touch</b> <b>input</b> technology behind most devices were resistive touchscreens which often required a stylus for input. [...] Later devices used capacitive sensing which does not require a stylus. [...] Along with touchscreens, a large variety of form factors existed for the platform. Some devices featured slideout keyboards, while others featured minimal face buttons.|$|E
500|$|Microsoft showcased {{other aspects}} of the new {{operating}} system, to be known as Windows 8, during subsequent presentations. Among these changes (which also included an overhauled interface optimized for use on touch-based devices built around Metro design language) was the introduction of Windows Runtime (WinRT). Software developed using this new architecture could be processor-independent (allowing compatibility with both x86 and ARM-based systems), would emphasize the use of <b>touch</b> <b>input,</b> would run within a sandboxed environment to provide additional security, and be distributed through Windows Store—a store similar to services such as the App Store and Google Play. WinRT was also optimized to provide a more [...] "reliable" [...] experience on ARM-based devices; as such, backward compatibility for Win32 software otherwise compatible with older versions of Windows was intentionally excluded from Windows on ARM. Windows developers indicated that existing Windows applications were not specifically optimized for reliability and energy efficiency on the ARM architecture, and that WinRT was sufficient for providing [...] "full expressive power" [...] for applications, [...] "while avoiding the traps and pitfalls that can potentially reduce the overall experience for consumers." [...] Consequentially, this lack of backwards compatibility would also prevent existing malware from running on the operating system.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "Quick Cover" [...] {{accessory}} {{was unveiled}} {{prior to the}} unveiling of the device itself; it is semi-translucent and features a window for the always-on portion of the screen. <b>Touch</b> <b>inputs</b> can be made through the cover and semi-translucent screen for actions such as accepting calls.|$|R
