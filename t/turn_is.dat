5|$|Another torque is {{produced}} by the finite width of the contact patch and the lean of the tire in a turn. The portion of the contact patch towards {{the outside of the}} <b>turn</b> <b>is</b> actually moving rearward, with respect to the wheel's hub, faster {{than the rest of the}} contact patch, because of its greater radius from the hub. By the same reasoning, the inner portion is moving rearward more slowly. So the outer and inner portions of the contact patch slip on the pavement in opposite directions, generating a torque that tends to turn the front wheel in the direction of the turn, and therefore tends to decrease the turn radius.|$|E
