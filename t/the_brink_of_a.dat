5|$|Argyle {{lost three}} of their next nine matches to give {{themselves}} a chance of avoiding relegation, but their win at Doncaster Rovers {{proved to be the}} last game that they would collect any points in. Defeats at home to Middlesbrough and away to Watford left the club on <b>the</b> <b>brink</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> return to England's third tier, and that was confirmed in their next game. Newcastle United won 2–0 at Home Park to secure the Championship title, and relegated the home side at the same time. The club finished 23rd in the league table after defeat by bottom club Peterborough United {{on the final day of}} the season, eight points adrift of safety. Jamie Mackie finished as the club's top scorer with eight goals in all competitions, and captain Carl Fletcher was voted Player of the Year.|$|E
5|$|Republican William S. Taylor {{defeated}} both Democratic {{candidates in}} the general election, but his margin over Goebel was only 2,383 votes. Democrats in the General Assembly began making accusations of voting irregularities in some counties, but in a surprise decision, the Board of Elections created by the Goebel Election Law and manned by three hand-picked Goebel Democrats, ruled 2–1 that the disputed ballots should count, saying the law gave them no legal power to reverse the official county results and that under the Kentucky Constitution the power to review the election lay in the General Assembly. The Assembly then invalidated enough Republican ballots to give the election to Goebel. The Assembly's Republican minority was incensed, as were voters in traditionally Republican districts. For several days, the state hovered on <b>the</b> <b>brink</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> possible civil war.|$|E
5|$|After missing {{most of the}} 193435 {{domestic}} season due to injury, McCabe scored an unbeaten 189 in the Second Test of the 193536 tour of South Africa, {{including a}} century in one session, taking Australia to <b>the</b> <b>brink</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> world record-breaking victory on a difficult final-day pitch in poor light before the match was called off. It {{was one of two}} Test centuries McCabe made on the tour. The following season, he made five fifties in the first four Tests before scoring a century to help Australia win the deciding final Test against the touring Englishmen. In the First Test of the 1938 tour of England, McCabe played what was regarded as his greatest innings, scoring 232 in four hours, including his last 72 in 28 minutes. Bradman regarded the innings as the greatest batting he ever saw. However, none of McCabe’s three most famous innings resulted in an Australian victory; he has a reputation of being at his best when Australia was in difficulty.|$|E

25|$|The {{showcasing}} and unorthodoxy of Dilshan {{was best}} highlighted against India on 15 December 2009, where Sri Lanka chased a mammoth target of 414 posted by India.

His first 150 came from 115 balls and Sri Lanka on <b>the</b> <b>brink</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sensational win. The knock of 160 was full of hooks, pulls and many scoops of his variety, leading the way to victory. But after Dilshan falls bowled by Harbhajan Singh, the match opened for Indians.

25|$|Kargil War: R {{was heavily}} criticised in 1999, {{following}} the Pakistani incursions at Kargil.

While the Army has {{been critical of the}} information they received R has pointed the finger at the politicians, claiming they had provided all the necessary information. However, R was successful in intercepting a telephonic conversation between Pervez Musharraf, the then Pakistan Army Chief who was in Beijing and his chief of staff Lt. Gen. Mohammed Aziz in Islamabad. This tape was later published by India to prove Pakistani involvement in the Kargil incursion.

25|$|Amtrak {{commenced}} {{operations in}} 1971 with $40million in direct federal aid, $100million in federally insured loans, and a somewhat larger private contribution. Officials expected that Amtrak would break even by 1974, but those expectations proved unrealistic and annual direct federal aid reached a 17-year high in 1981 of $1.25billion. During the Reagan administration, appropriations were halved and by 1986, federal support fell to a decade low of $601million, {{almost none of}} which were capital appropriations. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Congress continued the reductionist trend even while Amtrak expenses held steady or rose. Amtrak was forced to borrow to meet short-term operating needs, and by 1995 Amtrak was on <b>the</b> <b>brink</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cash crisis {{and was unable to}} continue to service its debts. In response, in 1997 Congress authorized $5.2billion for Amtrak {{over the next five years}} – largely to complete the Acela capital project – on the condition that Amtrak submit to the ultimatum of self-sufficiency by 2003 or liquidation. While Amtrak made financial improvements during this period, it did not achieve self-sufficiency.|$|E
25|$|Upon his re-election, Wallace {{indicated}} {{his intention}} to undertake a three-month review the club's business operations and it was revealed this included cuts to the first-team wage budget. The Rangers manager signed off on a wage reduction on 11 January, {{the same day as}} the club hired Philip Nash as a financial consultant to assist with the business review. Following this the club unsuccessfully asked the first-team squad to take pay cuts of around 15% until summer 2015 and as greater scrutiny was focused on the club's finances, Rangers financial director Brian Stockbridge resigned on 24 January. Indeed, in early February Wallace was forced to deny claims that the club was on <b>the</b> <b>brink</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> second insolvency event, however, two-weeks later Rangers borrowed £1.5m from shareholders Sandy Easdale and Laxey Partners for working capital. The loan agreement was widely criticised, as Laxey Partners stood to make £150,000 in either interest or shares {{by the time it was}} repaid and also the Albion Car Park and Edmiston House were being used as security. Despite this, prior to his court case, former director Imran Ahmad has failed to ring-fence cash at the club ahead of his now £500,000 lawsuit.|$|E
25|$|His Test career {{highlights}} include 329 against New Zealand in Lahore in the 2001–02 season, {{which is the}} second highest Test score by a Pakistani and the twelfth highest overall. He also scored a century (184 runs) in his 100th Test, becoming only the fifth player to do so (after Colin Cowdrey, Alec Stewart, Gordon Greenidge and Javed Miandad; Ricky Ponting subsequently emulated the feat). Inzamam made a century in each innings of the second Test match against England in 2005, to become Pakistan's leading centurion with 24 centuries, breaking Javed Miandad's record. His 25th century in the 2nd Test against India on 22 January 2006 made him the 10th player to score 25 or more centuries. He also managed 138 not out when the team was on <b>the</b> <b>brink</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> humiliating defeat against Bangladesh, eventually saving the Test match and leading his team to victory. His 92 not out against South Africa in late 2006 again showed his ability to bat in a crisis in a match winning manner. He scored twin half centuries when all appeared lost to draw the first test in Mohali against India in 2005, and also scored 184 runs in his 100th test match in the same away series causing the series to be drawn. He still holds the record for most consecutive half centuries against a country with nine in nine innings against England. This streak started from 31 May 2001 and lasted till 13 July 2006. He scored {{a century and a}} half century at Lords in 1996. His 118 against Australia in Hobart almost won the test for Pakistan but Adam Gilchrist's match winning 149 not out made the difference. His average in matches won is second only to Donald Bradman and Kumar Sangakkara.|$|E

500|$|The band's One Hot Minute tour {{proved to}} be {{successful}} however for the band it could easily {{be viewed as a}} disaster. Navarro never felt he fit properly in the band and the chemistry just wasn't there with him.

With the band on <b>the</b> <b>brink</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> break-up, Kiedis informed Flea that he felt the only way the band could continue is if Frusicante would return. Flea surprised Kiedis by stating he had been in contact with Frusciante and had a feeling he might be open to rejoining. That same month after Navarro's departure, Flea visited Frusciante and invited him to rejoin the band. An emotional and now sober Frusciante readily accepted the invitation.

500|$|In England's response, Shakib {{opted to}} use his spinners to {{minimise}} scoring opportunities, a tactic which led to Cook's dismissal for 21. His fellow opener, Trott, scored his first run from his 33rd delivery, and continued to bat circumspectly throughout the second day. Pietersen attempted to score more quickly, though it took a bad over from Razzak {{to allow him to}} do so. A misjudged shot after leaving his crease resulted in him being caught, and Collingwood followed soon after, leg before wicket from his third delivery. Bell joined Trott in the middle, and the pair added 67 runs together before Trott was dismissed for 64. Prior capitalised on more bad bowling from Razzak to reach his half-century, but fell shortly after, giving Bangladesh hope of a first-innings lead. Bell and Bresnan took England to <b>the</b> <b>brink</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> lead, adding 143 runs together, including a century for Bell. It was the first occasion on which Bell had scored a century in Test cricket without a teammate having already done so in the innings, a statistic that had been used to suggest he could not score run in tough conditions. Speaking about his century, Bell alluded to that statistic, stating that he had [...] "put a few things to bed." [...] After his dismissal, Bresnan batted with the tail, taking his score to 91, and England's to 496, a lead of 77 runs. After the third day, Bangladesh's captain, Shakib, criticised the Bangladesh Cricket Board for not paying {{for the use of the}} Umpire Decision Review System. He believed that a number of the umpiring decisions had gone against his side, and the technology could have given his side a better chance of their first Test win over England.|$|E
