25|$|Representative Duncan D. Hunter {{announced}} plans in January 2011 {{to introduce a}} bill designed to delay the end of DADT.

In April, Perkins of <b>the</b> <b>Family</b> <b>Research</b> Council argued that the Pentagon was misrepresenting its own survey data and that hearings by the House Armed Services Committee, now under Republican control, could persuade Obama to withhold certification. Congressional efforts to prevent the change in policy from going into effect continued into May and June 2011.|$|E
25|$|Earlier in the campaign, conservatives such as Tony Perkins of <b>the</b> <b>Family</b> <b>Research</b> Council, the {{president}} of the American Family Foundation, and Daniel Weiss, media analyst for James Dobson's Focus on the Family had criticized Romney for not having done enough, in their view, to stop Marriott Hotels from selling access to hardcore pornography in their hotel rooms in the decade from 1992 to 2001 that Romney had served on the hotel chain's board.

In rural areas a common investigative method is to personally ask about <b>the</b> <b>family</b> of interest by questioning shopkeepers and neighbors: kuchikiki (“inquiry of mouth”). More recently, the nakōdo gathers information about <b>the</b> <b>family</b> in question by asking around and comparing responses: kikiawaseru/toriawaseru (“inquire variously and compare”).

25|$|Opposition due to {{the safety}} of the vaccine has been {{addressed}} through studies, leaving opposition focused on the sexual implications of the vaccine to remain. Conservative groups in the U.S. have opposed the concept of making HPV vaccination mandatory for pre-adolescent girls, asserting that making the vaccine mandatory is a violation of parental rights. They also say that it will lead to early sexual activity, giving a false sense of immunity to sexually transmitted disease. (See Peltzman effect) Both <b>the</b> <b>Family</b> <b>Research</b> Council and the group Focus on the Family support widespread (universal) availability of HPV vaccines but oppose mandatory HPV vaccinations for entry to public school. Parents also express confusion over recent mandates for entry to public school pointing out that HPV is transmitted through sexual contact, not through attending school with other children.|$|E

[...] In his 2013 book Evangelicals and the Arts in Fiction, writer John Weaver writes that science fiction writer Robert A. Heinlein wrote about Evangelicals as being sexually repressed and eventually undergoing a sexual revolution. Weaver offers JC's Girls and XXXchurch.com as evidence that Heinlein's fiction is becoming a reality. By 2007, adherents of UFO religion Raëlism had responded to JC's Girls by forming [...] "Raël's Girls", an organization with a similar outreach program but a very different message, encouraging sex workers to try to maximise their own sexual pleasure while serving clients.|$|E
