5|$|While Rowan {{was still}} a justice of the Court of Appeals, the General Assembly chose him and John J. Crittenden as commissioners to resolve a border dispute with Tennessee. The dispute had arisen from an {{erroneous}} survey of the border line conducted by Dr. Thomas Walker years earlier. Walker's line deviated northward from the intended line (36 degrees, 30 minutes north latitude) by some twelve miles {{by the time it}} reached <b>the</b> <b>Tennessee</b> River. <b>The</b> <b>Tennessee</b> commissioners, Felix Grundy and William L. Brown, proposed that, because it had been accepted for so long, the Walker line be observed as far west as <b>the</b> <b>Tennessee</b> River, with Kentucky being compensated with a more southerly line between <b>the</b> <b>Tennessee</b> and Mississippi Rivers. Crittenden was inclined to accept this proposal with some minor adjustments, but Rowan insisted that Tennessee honor the statutory border of 36 degrees, 30 minutes north. <b>The</b> <b>Tennessee</b> commissioners refused to submit to arbitration in the matter, and Rowan and Crittenden delivered separate reports to the Kentucky legislature. The legislature adopted Crittenden's report; Rowan then resigned as commissioner and was replaced by Robert Trimble. Thereafter, the commissioners quickly agreed to a slightly modified version of <b>the</b> <b>Tennessee</b> proposal.|$|E
