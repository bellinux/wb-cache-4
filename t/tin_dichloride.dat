40|$|In a {{previous}} comparative toxicity study with alkyltin and estertin stabilizers, it was recognized that estertim compounds displayed in vitro lymphocytotoxic effects {{comparable to the}} dialkyltin compounds, but did not induce lymphoid atrophy when administered in vivo to rats as was found for the dialkyltin compounds. The discrepancy between the in vitro and in vivo toxicity of estertin compounds prompted us to study the metabolism of the estertin compound bis-(β-carbobutoxyethl) <b>tin</b> <b>dichloride</b> (CBETC) in rats. The hydrolysis product bis-(β-carboxyethl) <b>tin</b> <b>dichloride</b> (CETC) was the only metabolite detectable using TLC. After daily intravenous administration of 20 mg CBETC/kg body weight CETC was detected in urine only, whereas no faecal excretion of organotin was found. Intravenous adminstration of relatively large amounts of 20 mg CETC/kg body weight indicated that this compound is not metabolized by rapidly excreted in urine, probably because of its hydrophilic nature. Daily gavage of 15 mg CBETC/kg body weight resulted in the excretion of apprecable amounts of CETC in urine, but CETC was also found in faeces together with the parent compound. In the gastrointestinal tract CETC would be formed locally probably by acid hydrolysis of CBETC as was shown also in vitro in acidified water. Esterases in the gastrointestinal tract, tissues and blood might also {{be responsible for the}} fast hydrolysis of CBETC. As shown in our previous study the hydrolysis product CETC did not cause any lymphocytotoxic effect. Therefore we conclude that in the rat the estertin compund CBETC is effectively detoxified by hydrolysis of the ester bond...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe present {{work is a}} {{study of}} tin dioxide (SnO 2) based thin {{sensitive}} layer dedicated to organic vapors detection at ambient temperature. SnO 2 thin film was deposited by chemical spray pyrolysis technique. The glass substrate temperature was kept to 400 °C, using a starting solution of 0. 1 M <b>tin</b> (II) <b>dichloride</b> dihydrate (SnCl 2, 2 H 2 O). Films structural and morphological properties were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscope (AFM) respectively.

The SEM and AFM observations confirmed the granular morphology with presence of pores in the film surface. The prepared film was tested in various organic vapors (ethanol, methanol and acetone) at ambient operating temperature (25 °C± 2 °C). The obtained results suggested that SnO 2 is more sensitive to ethanol vapor with a maximum sensitivity of 35 % higher than to methanol and acetone vapors (1 % and 3 %).

40|$|Elevated placental {{release of}} the antiangiogenic factors, soluble fms-like {{tyrosine}} kinase- 1 (sFlt- 1) and soluble endoglin (sENG), {{is central to the}} pathophysiology of preeclampsia. It is widely accepted that heme oxygenase- 1 (HO- 1) is decreased in preeclamptic placenta and negatively regulates sFlt- 1 and sENG production. We set out to verify these contentions. There was no difference in HO- 1 mRNA or protein levels in preterm preeclamptic placentas (n= 17) compared with gestationally matched controls (n= 27). In silico analysis of microarray studies did not identify decreased placental HO- 1 expression in preeclamptic placenta. Silencing HO- 1 in primary trophoblasts did not affect sFlt- 1 protein secretion after 24 or 48 hours. Silencing nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2) -like 2 (transcription factor that upregulates HO- 1) in trophoblasts also did not affect sFlt- 1 secretion. Administering <b>tin</b> protoporphyrin IX <b>dichloride</b> (HO- 1 inhibitor) or cobalt protoporphyrin (HO- 1 inducer) into placental explants did not affect sFlt- 1 or sENG secretion. Silencing HO- 1 in 2 types of primary endothelial cells (human umbilical vein endothelial and uterine microvascular endothelial cells) significantly increased sFlt- 1 secretion but not sENG secretion. However, HO- 1 silencing selectively increased mRNA expression of sFlt- 1 i 13 (generically expressed sFlt- 1 variant) but not of sFlt- 1 e 15 a (sFlt- 1 variant mainly expressed in placenta). Furthermore, adding <b>tin</b> protoporphyrin IX <b>dichloride</b> decreased sFlt- 1, whereas adding HO- 1 inducers (cobalt protoporphyrin, dimethyl fumarate, and rosiglitazone) either had no effect or increased sFlt- 1 or sENG secretion (these trends are opposite to what is expected). We conclude that HO- 1 expression is not decreased in preeclamptic placenta and HO- 1 does not negatively regulate placental sFlt- 1 and sENG secretion in placental or endothelial cells.

A type of PVC-based phosphate membrane containing an organotin compound, bis(p-chlorobenzyl) <b>tin</b> <b>dichloride,</b> was evaluated, along with the nitrate and potassium membranes, in pH 7 Tris buffer solution and Kelowna soil extractant for sensitivity and long-term stability. The phosphate membranes in the Tris buffer solution of pH 7 exhibited a response over a range of 10 - 5 to 10 - 1 mol/L phosphate concentrations with an average slope of - 28. 2 + 1. 5 mV per activity decade of dibasic phosphate. The response speed of tested electrodes containing phosphate, nitrate and potassium membranes was rapid, reaching an equilibrium response in less than 15 s. However, the phosphate membrane in the Kelowna solution of pH 8. 5 was almost insensitive to different phosphate levels from 10 - 6 to 10 - 2 mol/L due to the presence of a high concentration of fluoride in the solution. In addition, the tin compound-based phosphate membranes had limited lifetimes of less than 14 days. It is not expected that the tested phosphate membranes could be used for phosphate detection in other soil extractants, such as Bray P 1 and Mehlich III solutions, because they also contain high concentrations of fluoride...|$|E
40|$|A novel {{sol-gel process}} has been {{developed}} for producing transparent conductive tin dioxide films and for their application to polymer substrates. Initially, tin oxide was produced by hydrolysis of tin tetrachloride using amended versions of methods found in the literature. The tin oxide produced from the procedure did not adhere well to glass and was not transparent. The procedure was also very time consuming.

40|$|Acanthamoeba is a protist {{pathogen}} {{that can}} cause serious human infections, including blinding keratitis and a granulomatous amoebic encephalitis that almost always results in death. The current treatment for these infections includes a mixture of drugs, and even then, a recurrence can occur. Photochemotherapy has shown promise {{in the treatment of}} Acanthamoeba infections; however, the selective targeting of pathogenic Acanthamoeba has remained a major concern. The mannose-binding protein is an important adhesin expressed on the surface membranes of pathogenic Acanthamoeba organisms. To specifically target Acan-thamoeba, the overall aim {{of this study was to}} synthesize a photosensitizing compound (porphyrin) conjugated with mannose and test its efficacy in vitro. The synthesis of mannose-conjugated porphyrin was achieved by mixing benzaldehyde and pyrrole, yielding tetraphenylporphyrin. Tetraphenylporphyrin was then converted into mono-nitrophenylporphyrin by selectively ni-trating the para position of the phenyl rings, as confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The mono-nitro-phenylporphyrin was reduced to mono-aminophenylporphyrin in the presence of <b>tin</b> <b>dichloride</b> and confirmed by a peak atm/z 629. Finally, mono-aminoporphyrin was conjugated with mannose, resulting in the formation of an imine bond. Mannose-con-jugated porphyrin was confirmed through spectroscopic analysis and showed that it absorbed light of wavelengths ranging from 425 to 475 nm. To determine the antiacanthamoebic effects of the derived product, amoebae were incubated with mannose-con-jugated porphyrin for 1 h and washed 3 times to remove extracellular compound.

The small core relativistic effective core potential, ECP 28 MDF, {{was used for}} Sn in these calculations, together with valence basis sets of up to augmented correlation-consistent polarized-valence quintuple-zeta (aug-cc-pV 5 Z) quality. Effects of outer core electron correlation on computed geometrical parameters have been investigated, and contributions of off-diagonal spin-orbit interaction to relative electronic energies have been calculated. In addition, RCCSD(T) or CASSCF/MRCI potential energy functions of the 1 A 1, ã 3 B 1, and 1 B 1 states of SnCl 2 have been computed and used to calculate anharmonic vibrational wave functions of these three electronic states. Franck-Condon factors between the 1 A 1 state, and the ã 3 B 1 and 1 B 1 states of SnCl 2, which include anharmonicity and Duschinsky rotation, were then computed, and used to simulate the ã- and - absorption and corresponding single-vibronic-level emission spectra of SnCl 2 which are yet to be recorded.

The salt-metathesis reaction of (Mamx) ECl 2 (E = Al, Ga) with dilithioferrocene and dilithioruthenocene yielded strained [1]ferrocenophanes ([1]FCPs) and [1]ruthenocenophanes ([1]RCPs), respectively, with aluminum and gallium as bridging elements. Galla[1]ruthenocenophane was {{isolated from the}} reaction mixture, while other aluminum- and gallium-bridged [1]FCPs and [1]RCPs spontaneously ring-open polymerized under conditions of their formation reactions and produced metallopolymers. Galla[1]ruthenocenophane was polymerized using Karstedt’s catalyst, which yielded poly(ruthenocenylgallane). Aluminum- and gallium-bridged bis(ferrocenyl) species were prepared by reacting lithioferrocene with respective dichlorides. DFT calculations were performed to study the structure and reactivity of these new [1]metallocenophanes. Particularly, {{the role of the}} bulky Mamx ligand and its influence on the high reactivity of these strained sandwich species was investigated. (Mamx) InCl 2 was reacted with dilithioferrocene and resulted in indium-bridged [1]FCP, [1. 1]FCP and oligomers. However, the reaction of (Mamx) InCl 2 with dilithioferrocene, substituted with two isopropyl groups ortho to lithium atoms, resulted in inda[1]ferrocenophane selectively. However, this inda[1]ferrocenophane could not be isolated as it spontaneously polymerized under conditions of its formation reaction. The synthesis and characterization of aluminum and gallium dichlorides decorated with the slim p-SiMe 3 Ar′ [p-SiMe 3 Ar′ = 5 -Me 3 Si- 2 -(Me 2 NCH 2) C 6 H 3] and Mpysm [Mpysm = (2 -C 5 H 4 N) Me 2 SiCH 2] ligands are described. These dichlorides were utilized to synthesize group- 13 -bridged [1. 1]FCPs and bis(ferrocenyl) species. Bis(ferrocenyl) species with SiMe 2 - and SiEt 2 -bridges were described as well. Two similar species, bis(1 '-bromoferrocenyl) dialkylsilane (alkyl = Me, Et) were also prepared.

The reactions of dilithioferrocene with dialkyltin dichlorides also yielded polymers that contained a mixture of linear and cyclic species. Some species were isolated by column chromatography.

Our goal {{was to investigate the}} ability of three different phosphate ion-selective electrodes (two fabricated with organotin compound-based PVC membranes, and one fabricated from a cobalt rod) used in conjunction with Kelowna soil extractant to determine phosphorus over the typical range of soil concentrations. Electrodes using organotin compound-based PVC membranes containing bis(p-chlorobenzyl) <b>tin</b> <b>dichloride</b> as an ionophore exhibited sensitive responses to HPO 42 - over a range of 10 - 4 to 10 - 1 mol/L in Tris buffer at pH 7. They were nearly insensitive to phosphate when using Kelowna soil extractant as the base solution, perhaps because of the high concentration of fluoride (0. 015 mol/L) in the Kelowna solution. In addition, the life of the membranes was less than 14 days. Electrodes using another tin-compound-based PVC membrane containing tributyltin chloride as an ionophore also provided unsatisfactory results, showing much less sensitivity to H 2 PO 4 - than previously reported. The cobalt rod-based electrodes exhibited sensitive responses to H 2 PO 4 - over a range from 10 - 5 to 10 - 1 mol/L total phosphate concentration with a detection limit of 10 - 5 mol/L in the Kelowna solution. This detection range would encompass the typical range of soil phosphorus concentrations measured in agricultural fields. The selectivity of the cobalt electrodes was satisfactory for measuring phosphates in the presence of each of six interfering ions, i. e., HCO 3 -, Cl -, Br -, NO 3 -, Ac -, and F -, with the electrodes being 47 to 1072 times more responsive to phosphate than to the tested interfering ions...|$|E

The technique is entirely non-invasive and detects gas phase species in an in situ manner with a time resolution of the order of milliseconds. Approach. In this illustration of the technique, the atmospheric pressure MOCVD reaction of tin oxide deposition on a glass substrate was studied. The precursors were dimethyl <b>tin</b> <b>dichloride</b> (DMT), water and oxygen with a substrate temperature of 650 °C. Methane was selected as the product species to monitor. The high spectral resolution of the laser allows unambiguous, selective detection of methane in the 2 n 3 band around 1665 nm. The high spatial resolution of the beam and the ability of the beam to pass directly through the walls of a quartz reactor leads to the possibility of spatial monitoring of reactors. By measuring the ratio of absorption lines arising from different vibration or rotation states it is also possible to extract temperature information across the reactor. Although not as sensitive as mid-infrared diode laser spectroscopy, the technique has many practical advantages, for example, fibre optics {{can also be used to}} launch and receive the beam. Results It was shown that the evolved methane concentration was directly correlated with the deposition rate of the tin oxide film. This important result enables the monitoring of thin film production and properties in situ during production. Preliminary results will also be presented of near-infrared laser reflectance measurements taken during the deposition of InP films by APCVD.

The phosphorus compounds P(O 2 C 6 R) 2 Br (R = Cl 4, Br 4 or Bu t 2 H 2) have been prepared by the reaction of P 4, Br 2 and the substituted o-benzoquinone o-O 2 C 6 R. There is no reaction between o-O 2 C 6 Bu t 2 H 2 (dbbq), P 4 and Ph 2 Se 2, but in the presence of catalytic quantities of Br 2 the product is P(dbc) 2 (SePh) (dbc = 3, 5 -di-Bu tcatecholate). Electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra identify the presence of the corresponding o-semiquinone species in these reactions. The 13 C and 31 P NMR spectra of these phosphoranes are studied and compared with those of P(O 2 C 6 R) X 3 (X 3 = Ph 3, Ph 2 Cl, Br 3 or Cl 3) prepared by the reaction of PX 3 and o-O 2 C 6 R. The oxidation of elemental tellurium by three o-benzoquinones o-O 2 C 6 R (R = Cl 4, Br 4 or But 2 H 2) is a direct route to the corresponding tellurium(IV) catecholates Te(O 2 C 6 R) 2. The analogous reaction with organotellurium(II) TeR' 2, (R' 2 = Et 2, Me 2, Ph(Et) or Ph(Br)) gives the products Te(O 2 C 6 R) R' 2. The reactions proceed in each case by one-electron transfer, since the presence of the semiquinone radical O 2 C 6 R in the reaction mixture has been demonstrated by ESR spectroscopy. The Te(O 2 C 6 R) 2 species resist further oxidation, and also show weak donor and acceptor properties. The structure of the compounds Te(dbc) 2 (bipy) 3. 1 and Te(O 2 C 6 Cl 4) 2 (18 -crown- 6) 3. 2 have been determined by X-ray crystallography. In both structures, the average Te-O distances (2. 012 and 2. 015 A respectively) are typical of tellurium(IV) compounds, and the average C-O distances (1. 370 and 1. 34 A respectively) confirm that the ligands are aromatic diolates. The oxidation of elemental antimony by the tetrahalogeno-o-benzoquinones o-O 2 C 6 R (R = Cl 4, or Br 4) in diethyl ether gives the unusual antimony(v) products Sb(O 2 C 6 R) 2. 5 · nEt 2 O (R = Cl 4, n = 1. 5; R = Br 4, n = 1). The same o-benzoquinones, and dbbq, upon treatment with Sb + 1 / 2 X 2 (X = Br or I) in diethyl ether, give the antimony(III) derivatives Sb(O 2 C 6 R) X (R = Cl 4, Br 4 or Bu t 2 H 2). The oxidations are shown by ESR spectroscopy to proceed via the o-semiquinone intermediates. Adducts of Sb(O 2 C 6 R) I with bidentate neutral donors have been prepared. The structure of Sb(dbc) I(bipy) 4. 1 {{has been shown to be}} that of a pseudo-octahedral molecule with a stereochemically active lone pair of electrons. The reactions between diphenyl ditelluride and tetrahalogeno-o-benzoquinones o-O 2 C 6 X 4 (X = Cl or Br) give ((X 4 C 6 O 2) TeC 6 H 52 O. The structure of ((Cl 4 C 6 O 2) TeC 6 H 52 O 5. 1 has been established crystallographically. The reactions between Ph 2 Te 2 and other oxidants have also been studied.
