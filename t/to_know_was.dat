5|$|As far as Westmoreland was concerned, however, all {{he needed}} <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>was</b> that the NVA had massed large numbers of troops for a set-piece battle. Making the {{prospect}} even more enticing was that the base was in an unpopulated area where American firepower could be fully employed without civilian casualties. The opportunity to engage and destroy a formerly elusive enemy that was moving toward a fixed position promised a victory of unprecedented proportions.|$|E
25|$|Rabi {{felt that}} {{to compete with}} the University of Chicago, Columbia needed to have access to a {{research}} reactor too; but the cost was greater than Columbia could afford without collaborating with other institutions, government assistance, or both. On January 16, 1946, Pegram convened a meeting of representatives of 16 different colleges, universities, hospitals and research institutions like the Bell Telephone Laboratories. The meeting drafted a request to the director of the Manhattan Project, Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., asking him to establish a regional research laboratory near New York City. In response, Groves sent Colonel Kenneth Nichols to meet with Pegram and Rabi and their opposite numbers from Princeton University, Hugh S. Taylor and Henry D. Smyth on February 8. They found Nichols amenable to their idea; all he wanted <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>was</b> where it would be built, and who would run it.|$|E
500|$|Between {{seasons of}} Richard, in 1934 Gielgud {{returned}} to Hamlet in London and on tour, directing {{and playing the}} title role. The production was a box-office success, and the critics were lavish in their praise. In The New York Times, Charles Morgan wrote, [...] "I have never before heard the rhythm and verse and the naturalness of speech so gently combined.... If I see a better performance of this play than this before I die, {{it will be a}} miracle." [...] Morley writes that junior members of the cast such as Alec Guinness and Frith Banbury would gather in the wings every night [...] "to watch what they seemed intuitively already <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>was</b> to be the Hamlet of their time." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{an unconstitutional}} though {{widespread}} practice during the Communist witchhunts, the U.S. State Department refused to renew Rossen's passport. This, and {{his inability to}} find work, brought Rossen, like his friend, ex-Communist Elia Kazan, back to the committee in May 1953, where he named 57 people as Communists. [...] He explained to the committee why he chose to testify: [...] "I don't think, {{after two years of}} thinking, that any one individual can indulge himself in the luxury of personal morality or pit it against what I feel today very strongly is the security and safety of this nation." [...] Stephen Rossen later shed light on his father's decision: [...] "It killed him not to work. He was torn between his desire to work and his desire not to talk, and he didn't know what to do. What I think he wanted <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>was,</b> what would I think of him if he talked? He didn't say it in that way, though. Then he explained to me the politics of it—how the studios were in on it, and there was never any chance of his working. He was under pressure, he was sick, his diabetes was bad, and he was drinking. By this time I understood that he had refused to talk before and had done his time, from my point of view. What could any kid say at that point? You say, 'I love you and I'm behind you.'" ...|$|E
500|$|McEntire {{released}} a second album in 1986 (her tenth overall), What Am I Gonna Do About You. Allmusic critic William Ruhlmann was not overly pleased with album's production, {{saying that it}} lacked the features {{that had been set}} forth on Whoever's in New England. Rulhlmann criticized the title track for [...] "something of the feel of 'Whoever's in New England' in its portrayal of a woman trying to recover from a painfully ended love affair". The title track was the lead single from the release and became a number-one single shortly after its release. This album also spawned a second number-one in [...] "One Promise Too Late". The following year, her first MCA compilation, Greatest Hits was {{released a}}nd became her first album to be certified platinum in sales, eventually certifying triple-platinum. A twelfth studio album, The Last One <b>to</b> <b>Know,</b> <b>was</b> released in 1987. The emotions of her divorce from husband, Charlie Battles, were put into the album's material, according to McEntire. The title track from the release was a number-one single in 1987 and the second single, [...] "Love Will Find Its Way to You", also reached the top spot. In late 1987, McEntire released her first Christmas collection, Merry Christmas to You, which sold two million copies in the United States, certifying double Platinum. The album included cover versions of [...] "Away in a Manger", [...] "Silent Night", and Grandpa Jones's [...] "The Christmas Guest".|$|E
2500|$|However, Jackson later {{rejected}} {{his argument}} and embraced physicalism. He notes that Mary obtains knowledge not of color, {{but of a}} new intramental state, seeing color. Also, he notes that Mary might say [...] "wow," [...] and as a mental state affecting the physical, this clashed with his former view of epiphenomenalism. David Lewis' response to this argument, {{now known as the}} ability argument, is that what Mary really came <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>was</b> simply the ability to recognize and identify color sensations to which she had previously not been exposed. Daniel Dennett and others also provide arguments against this notion (see Objections).|$|E

After a few wasted days Symons' replacement, Brigadier General Yule, decided to abandon the town and the worst-wounded to the Boers and steal away at night to Ladysmith. The next day the town surrendered and Symons became a prisoner of war along with many others. He clearly felt betrayed by Yule and just before he died on 23 October he implored the medical officer, Major Donegan, to [...] "tell everyone I died facing the enemy, tell everyone I died facing the enemy".|$|E
2500|$|In {{order to}} take {{decision}} the envoys of the Eastern Patriarchs asked the Bulgarian delegated the following question: [...] "When you took [...] Motherland, tell us under which authority {{it used to be}} and were there Latin or Greek priests?". They gave the prepared answer: [...] "We took [...] Motherland with arms from the rule of the Greeks and there we found not Latin but Greek priests." [...] In compliance with the response of the Bulgarian envoys, the Eastern Patriarchates pronounced their decision: [...] "If you have found Greek priests, it is clear that this land was under the rule of Constantinople... Therefore we adjudge, because the Bulgarian motherland, as we got <b>to</b> <b>know,</b> <b>was</b> previously under Greek ruler and had Greek priests, to be now returned again through Christianity to the holy Church of Constantinople, from which it was separated through paganism." [...] The protests of the Roman legates were futile. They forged a letter in which the Pope allegedly warned the Patriarch of Constantinople not to interfere with the Bulgarian matters, but Ignatius ignored it. After the Council (in the very same year) the Latin priests had to leave Bulgaria and were substituted by Byzantine missionaries.|$|E
