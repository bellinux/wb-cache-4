5|$|Each sermon {{begins with}} a scriptural passage that {{reinforces}} <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>that</b> {{will be discussed in}} the sermon and each was preceded with the same opening prayer (which Swift also delivered). The sermons are plainly written and apply a common-sense approach to contemporary moral issues in Dublin. Swift patterned his sermons on the plain style of the Book of Common Prayer and the Church of Ireland Authorized Version of the Bible.|$|E
5|$|In an {{interview}} with Alma Books, Whitehead states {{that the concept of}} the book originated from an article about the naming process for new pharmaceuticals such as Prozac. The article made Whitehead question how a similar process is used to assert a certain control over one's environment (his example is a boulevard named after a particular person), and yoking the two concepts was the beginning of <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>that</b> led to his composition of the novel.|$|E
5|$|Strom also {{resisted}} calling {{an early}} election {{to give his}} government a fresh mandate, despite Hamilton's impassioned advocacy for this course of action. He was no more positive towards Anderson's proposals for a radical overhaul of the party, including the computerization of political data (such as voting trends, demographic shifts, and polling results) and the purchase of an office building to make the party a profit and free it from the need for fundraising. <b>The</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>that</b> Strom did not reject outright were referred to committees and study groups where they were watered down or shelved.|$|E
50|$|Ethical hedonism is <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> {{all people}} have the right to do {{everything}} in their power to achieve the greatest amount of pleasure possible to them. It is also <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> every person's pleasure should far surpass their amount of pain. Ethical hedonism is said to have been started by Aristippus of Cyrene, a student of Socrates. He held <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> pleasure is <b>the</b> highest good.|$|R
5000|$|Hirohito was {{persistent}} in <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{emperor of}} Japan {{should be considered}} a descendant of the gods. In December 1945, he told his vice-grand chamberlain Michio Kinoshita: [...] "It is permissible to say <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Japanese are descendants of the gods is a false conception; but it is absolutely impermissible to call chimerical <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> emperor is a descendant of the gods." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{base change}} axiom {{corresponds}} to <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> if {} covers U, then {Ui ∩ V} should cover U ∩ V. The local character axiom corresponds to <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> if {Ui} covers U and {Vij}j Ji covers Ui for each i, then the collection {Vij} {{for all i}} and j should cover U. Lastly, the identity axiom corresponds to <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> any set is covered by all its possible subsets.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>that</b> {{underpin}} {{our modern}} world–meritocracy, equality before the law, property rights, religious toleration, modern secular education, sound finances, and so on–were championed, consolidated, codified and geographically extended by Napoleon. To them {{he added a}} rational and efficient local administration, an end to rural banditry, the encouragement of science and the arts, the abolition of feudalism and the greatest codification of laws {{since the fall of}} the Roman Empire.|$|E
5|$|Advances in {{microscopy}} {{also had}} a profound impact on biological thinking. In the early 19th century, a number of biologists pointed to the central importance of the cell. In 1838 and 1839, Schleiden and Schwann began promoting <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>that</b> (1) the basic unit of organisms is the cell and (2) that individual cells have all the characteristics of life, though they opposed the idea that (3) all cells come from the division of other cells. Thanks to the work of Robert Remak and Rudolf Virchow, however, by the 1860s most biologists accepted all three tenets of what came to be known as cell theory.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, the {{distinguished}} Mayanist J. Eric S. Thompson promoted <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>that</b> Maya cities were essentially vacant ceremonial centres serving a dispersed {{population in the}} forest, and that the Maya civilization was governed by peaceful astronomer-priests. These ideas began to collapse with major advances in the decipherment of the script in the late 20th century, pioneered by Heinrich Berlin, Tatiana Proskouriakoff, and Yuri Knorozov. With breakthroughs in understanding of Maya script since the 1950s, the texts revealed the warlike activities of the Classic Maya kings, and {{the view of the}} Maya as peaceful could no longer be supported. Detailed settlement surveys of Maya cities revealed the evidence of large populations, putting an end to the vacant ceremonial centre model.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> Bethlehem {{was to be}} {{the birthplace}} of the Messiah appears in no Jewish source before the 4th century CE. Jewish {{tradition}} appears to have emphasised <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> birthplace of the Messiah was not known.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> quantum {{states are}} vectors in an {{abstract}} vector space is completely general {{in all aspects}} of quantum mechanics and quantum field theory, whereas <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> quantum states are complex-valued [...] "wave" [...] functions of space is only true in certain situations.|$|R
5000|$|Say's law did not posit that (as per the Keynesian formulation) [...] "supply creates its own demand". Nor was {{it based}} on <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> {{everything}} that is saved will be exchanged. Rather, Say sought to refute <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> production and employment were limited by low consumption.|$|R
5|$|Regardless of {{acceptance}} from major religious hierarchies, early religious objections to Darwin's theory are still used {{in opposition to}} evolution. <b>The</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>that</b> species change over time through natural processes and that different species share common ancestors seemed to contradict the Genesis account of Creation. Believers in Biblical infallibility attacked Darwinism as heretical. The natural theology of the early 19th century was typified by William Paley's watchmaker analogy, an argument from design still used by the creationist movement. Natural theology included a range of ideas and arguments from the outset, and when Darwin's theory was published, ideas of theistic evolution were presented in which evolution is accepted as a secondary cause open to scientific investigation, while still holding belief in God as a first cause with a non-specified role in guiding evolution and creating humans. This position has been adopted by denominations of Christianity and Judaism in line with modernist theology which views the Bible and Torah as allegorical, thus removing the conflict between evolution and religion.|$|E
5|$|The expeditions and {{the making}} of the {{attraction}} were chronicled in three documentaries broadcast on Discovery's cable television channels in April 2006. The first was Expedition Everest: Journey to Sacred Lands, broadcast on the Travel Channel on April 9 to coincide with the attraction's grand opening. The second, Building A Thrill Ride: Expedition Everest, was aired on April 10 and detailed the planning and construction of the ride, along with some of <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>that</b> made it possible. (During construction, for example, instead of traditional scaffolding the Imagineers used interior poles that poked through the outside of the mountain and were connected by wooden platforms.) This documentary also featured survival tips from Les Stroud. The third, , was broadcast on Animal Planet on April 15 and featured American animal and nature conservationist Jeff Corwin.|$|E
5|$|The {{need for}} an {{international}} standard for chemistry was first addressed in 1860 by a committee headed by German scientist Friedrich August Kekulé von Stradonitz. This committee was the first international conference to create an international naming system for organic compounds. <b>The</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>that</b> were formulated in that conference evolved into the official IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry. IUPAC stands as a legacy of this meeting, {{making it one of}} the most important historical international collaborations of chemistry societies. Since this time, IUPAC has been the official organization held with the responsibility of updating and maintaining official organic nomenclature. IUPAC as such was established in 1919. One notable country excluded from this early IUPAC is Germany. Germany's exclusion was a result of prejudice towards Germans by the Allied powers after World War I. Germany was finally admitted into IUPAC during 1929. However, Nazi Germany was removed from IUPAC during World War II.|$|E

5|$|The seven-person {{development}} team {{started work}} on the sequel with <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>that</b> did not fit into the original. They also incorporated feedback from Killer Instinct players. Killer Instinct2 art, design, and programming changed continuously throughout development up until its release. Kevin Bayliss designed the characters and Chris Tilston developed the game engine with feedback from Nintendo's Ken Lobb. Rare used compression technology to fit the arcade version onto the smaller Nintendo64 cartridge. While Killer Instinct was planned to showcase the Nintendo 64's power, the console was more limited than Rare's arcade setup, and Rare had to optimize the arcade version to run on the console. The arcade version used an animation to give the illusion of the camera panning horizontally, but the console version used static image files with less detail. Both the arcade and console versions use the same graphic engine and character roster.|$|E

50|$|Logical {{positivism}} (later {{and more}} accurately called logical empiricism) {{is a school}} of philosophy <b>that</b> combines empiricism, <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> observational evidence is indispensable for knowledge of the world, with a version of rationalism, <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> our knowledge includes a component that is not derived from observation.|$|R
50|$|The New Testament {{exhibits}} {{a tension between}} two aspects of grace: <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> grace is from God is sufficient to cover any sin as well as offer redemption (except the Unforgivable sin) and <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> grace does not free humans from their responsibility to behave morally.|$|R
5000|$|Fellow historians tend {{to examine}} the last 35 years of Lefebvre's {{writings}} (1924-1959). This period is chosen because it is when he wrote his most influential and [...] "much more complex interpretation of the Revolution than had hitherto prevailed amongst historians". [...] Peter Jones elaborates that Lefebvre’s take on the Revolution has three major emphases: <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> countryside peasantry actively participated in <b>the</b> Revolution, <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> this participation was not significantly influenced by the bourgeoisie, and <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> peasants largely agreed on an anticapitalist way of thinking in the 1790s.|$|R
25|$|Richard Carrier has {{put forward}} <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>that</b> the 'Christ, {{the author of}} this name, was {{executed}} by the procurator Pontius Pilate in the reign of Tiberius' line is a Christian interpolation and that Tacitus wrote about Chrestians not Christians.|$|E
25|$|Produced during 1980 and 1981, La Longue Marche à travers la théorie de Galois (The Long March Through Galois Theory) is a 1600-page {{handwritten}} manuscript containing many of <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>that</b> {{led to the}} Esquisse d'un programme.

25|$|Alfred Ronalds took up {{the sport}} of fly fishing, {{learning}} the craft on the rivers Trent, Blythe and Dove. On the River Blythe, near what is today Creswell Green, Ronalds constructed a bankside fishing hut designed primarily as an observatory of trout behaviour in the river. From this hut, and elsewhere on his home rivers, Ronalds conducted experiments and formulated <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>that</b> eventually were published in The Fly-fisher's Entomology in 1836.|$|E
25|$|There {{were three}} main groups of early {{converts}} to Islam: younger brothers and sons of great merchants, {{people who had}} fallen out of the first rank in their tribe or failed to attain it, and the weak, mostly unprotected foreigners. The oligarchy of the Quraysh rejected <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>that</b> Muhammad preached, since they would have to surrender their privileges. The Quraysh also did not accept Muhammad as a prophet since he came from a clan less powerful than his opponents'.|$|E
