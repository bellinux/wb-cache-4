5000|$|Prior <b>to</b> 2011, <b>law</b> <b>schools</b> {{published}} fraudulent {{employment statistics}} suggesting that over 90% of their graduates {{were employed in}} attorney positions earning six figure salaries. Loyola was noted as a <b>law</b> <b>school</b> that previously provided inaccurate consumer information.When the ABA required <b>law</b> <b>schools</b> <b>to</b> publish accurate graduate employment statistics, applications <b>to</b> <b>law</b> <b>schools</b> fell precipitously. In response, <b>law</b> <b>schools</b> lowered admission standards to maintain class sizes without considering the consequences on bar passage rates. Since 2011, applications <b>to</b> <b>law</b> <b>schools,</b> including Loyola, have fallen by over 50%. [...] Loyola responded by lowering admission standards. In 2011, Loyola admitted a class with a 25th/75th percentile GPA of 3.13/3.57 and a 25th/75th percentile LSAT of 156/162. By 2016, Loyola's entering class had a 25th/75th percentile GPA of 3.02/3.54 and a 25th/75th percentile LSAT of 154/160. The decline in admissions standards to maintain enrollment has resulted in falling bar passage rates across the country.|$|R

Then, on September 9, 1939 he had accepted an offer to play with the Brooklyn Dodgers of the NFL. Heikkinen had previously refused offers to play pro football, but the persistence of coach Potsy Clark, and Crisler’s assurance that a coaching job would be open for him in 1940, persuaded Heikkinen to try professional football. Heikkinen noted on signing, though, that he would definitely return <b>to</b> <b>law</b> <b>school</b> in 1940. It was reported that Heikkinen signed a contract for “at least $175 a game” with the Dodgers. Heikkinen was cut by the Dodgers after playing only three games.|$|E
