5|$|Despite ongoing {{threats from}} the Khmer Rouge during the elections, on 28 May 1993, FUNCINPEC won 45.47 {{percent of the}} vote, against 38.23 percent for <b>the</b> <b>Cambodian</b> People’s Party. Though clearly defeated, Hun Sen {{refused to accept the}} results of the election, so his Defense Minister, Sin Song, {{announced}} the secession of the eastern provinces of Cambodia, which had supported <b>the</b> <b>Cambodian</b> People’s Party. Prince Norodom Ranariddh, leader of FUNCINPEC and son of Sihanouk, agreed to form a coalition government with <b>the</b> <b>Cambodian</b> People’s Party so the country would not break up. On 21 September 1993, <b>the</b> <b>Cambodian</b> Constituent Assembly approved a new Constitution and Ranariddh became First Prime Minister, and he appointed Hun Sen as the Second Prime Minister. On 23 September 1993, the constitutional monarchy was restored with Norodom Sihanouk as the head of state. In July 1994, <b>the</b> <b>Cambodian</b> Government outlawed the Khmer Rouge for its continuous violations of the Paris Agreement. Most significantly, <b>the</b> <b>Cambodian</b> Government also specifically recognised the genocide and atrocities which occurred under Democratic Kampuchea. By 1998, the Khmer Rouge was completely dissolved.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Cambodian</b> {{government}} was not informed of the incursion until it was already under way. <b>The</b> <b>Cambodian</b> leadership however welcomed the intervention against PAVN bases and the resulting weakening of PAVN military capabilities. The leadership had hoped for permanent US occupation of the PAVN sanctuaries because FANK and ARVN forces were unable to fill the vacuum in these territories following US withdrawal. It has been argued by some scholars that the incursion heated up {{the civil war and}} helped the insurgent Khmer Rouge gather recruits to their cause.|$|E
5|$|Vietnamese {{settlers}} {{began to}} settle in modern-day Cochinchina and Ho Chi Minh City from the 1620s onwards. To the Cambodians, these lands were known as Kampuchea Krom and traditionally {{under the control of}} the Khmer Empire. From the era of Chey Chettha II onwards, they came {{under the control of the}} Nguyễn lords. In 1813, Emperor Gia Long sent 10,000 Vietnamese troops into Phnom Penh and some members of <b>the</b> <b>Cambodian</b> royal family came under the control of the Vietnamese court. The Nguyen court imposed Vietnamese customs upon <b>the</b> <b>Cambodian</b> populace, and names of towns and provinces were changed to Vietnamese ones. Vietnamese settlers were encouraged {{to settle in}} Cambodia and official documents from the Vietnamese court recorded an average of 5,000 Vietnamese settlers coming into Cambodia in the 1830s. The policies imposed by the Nguyen court stirred resentment among <b>the</b> <b>Cambodian</b> populace and provoked occasional rebellions.|$|E

5|$|Between 1970 and 1975, Sihanouk took up {{residence}} in state guesthouses at Beijing and Pyongyang, courtesy of the Chinese and North Korean governments, respectively. In February 1973 Sihanouk traveled to Hanoi, where he started on a long journey with Khieu Samphan and other Khmer Rouge leaders. The convoy proceeded along the Ho Chi Minh trail and reached <b>the</b> <b>Cambodian</b> border at Stung Treng Province the following month. From there, they traveled across the provinces of Stung Treng, Preah Vihear, and Siem Reap. Throughout this entire leg of the journey, Sihanouk faced constant bombardment from American planes participating in Operation Freedom Deal. At Siem Reap, Sihanouk visited the temples of Angkor Wat, Banteay Srei, and Bayon. In August 1973 Sirik Matak wrote an open letter calling on Sihanouk to bring <b>the</b> <b>Cambodian</b> Civil War {{to an end and}} suggesting the possibility of his return to the country. When the letter reached Sihanouk, he angrily rejected Sirik Matak's advances.|$|E
5|$|In July 2015, FUNCINPEC {{announced}} {{the formation of}} <b>the</b> <b>Cambodian</b> Royalist Youth Movement, a youth organisation aimed at garnering electoral support for the party from younger voters.

Subsequently, on 3 February 2016, Nhek Bun Chhay {{announced that he was}} quitting the party, and went on to form his new party, the Khmer National United Party (KNUP). The KNUP adopted a logo which was similar to a former logo of FUNCINPEC, featuring <b>the</b> <b>Cambodian</b> Independence Monument. The secretary-general, Say Hak accepted Nhek Bun Chhay's resignation, {{while at the same time}} challenged KNUP's use of its new logo as he lodged a successful complaint with the interior ministry.|$|E

When FUNCINPEC won the 1993 Cambodian general election, it formed a coalition government with <b>the</b> <b>Cambodian</b> People's Party (CPP), which was jointly headed by two concurrently serving prime ministers.

5|$|The {{effectiveness}} of the U.S. bombing on the Khmer Rouge and the death toll of Cambodian civilians is disputed. With limited data, the range of Cambodian deaths caused by U.S. bombing may be between 40,000 and 150,000 Cambodian civilians and Khmer Rouge fighters. Another impact of the U.S. bombing and <b>the</b> <b>Cambodian</b> civil war was to destroy the homes and livelihood of many people. This was a heavy contributor to the refugee crisis in Cambodia with two million people—more than 25 percent of the population—displaced from rural areas into the cities, especially Phnom Penh which grew from about 600,000 in 1970 to an estimated population of nearly 2 million by 1975. <b>The</b> <b>Cambodian</b> government estimated that more than 20 percent of the property in the country had been destroyed during the war.|$|E

The film's co-writer, Steven Elder, appears in a minor role as Dragovic's attorney.|$|E
5|$|The main {{problems}} were {{the pressure of}} time and the desire of the U.S. president for secrecy. <b>The</b> <b>Cambodian</b> monsoon, whose heavy rains would hamper operations, was only two months away. By the order of the president, the State Department did not notify <b>the</b> <b>Cambodian</b> desk at the US Embassy, Saigon, the Phnom Penh embassy, or Lon Nol of the planning. Operational security was as tight as General Abrams could make it. There was to be no prior U.S. logistical build-up in the border regions which might serve as a signal to the communists. U.S. brigade commanders were informed only a week in advance of the offensive, while battalion commanders got only two or three days' notice.|$|E

50|$|Aside from {{collecting}} taxes more efficiently, the French {{did little}} to transform Cambodia's village-based economy. <b>Cambodians</b> paid <b>the</b> highest taxes per capita in Indochina, and in 1916 a nonviolent tax revolt brought {{tens of thousands of}} peasants into Phnom Penh to petition the king for a reduction. The incident shocked the French, who had lulled themselves into believing that <b>the</b> <b>Cambodians</b> were too indolent and individualistic to organize a mass protest. Taxes continued to be sorely resented by <b>the</b> <b>Cambodians.</b> In 1925 villagers killed a French resident after he threatened to arrest tax delinquents. For poor peasants, the corvée service (a tax substitute) of as many as ninety days a year on public works projects, was an onerous duty.|$|R
