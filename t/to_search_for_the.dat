5|$|The Forerunner Saga reveals Guilty Spark to {{have barely}} survived {{the events of}} Halo 3. His body barely {{functioning}} and his memory {{of the last few}} years erased from his fight with Chief, he was recovered by the UNSC ship Rubicon and interrogated by ONI for information about the Forerunners. During the interrogation, the barely functioning Spark had breached the Rubicon's firewalls and overpowered the onboard A.I. When the interrogation was over, his monitor body shut down and was launched into space, but his mind remained in the ship, informing the crew that he was going <b>to</b> <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Librarian and restore his friends Riser and Vinnerva from his life as Chakas before placing the crew in cryostasis and taking the ship for his own <b>to</b> <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Forerunner.|$|E

5|$|Before 1977, no {{expedition}} {{had been}} to Stewart Island/Rakiura <b>to</b> <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> bird. In 1977, sightings of kakapo were reported on Stewart Island. An expedition to the island found a track and bowl system on its first day; soon after, it located several dozen kakapo. The finding in an 8,000-hectare area of fire-modified scrubland and forest raised hope that the population would include females. The total population was estimated at 100 to 200 birds.|$|E

5|$|After obtaining {{permission}} from the Mexican government to mount an expedition into Indian territory <b>to</b> <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> legendary silver mine, Bowie, his brother Rezin, and ten others set out for San Saba on November 2, 1831. Six miles (10km) from their goal, the group stopped to negotiate with a large raiding party of Indians—reportedly more than 120 Tawakoni and Waco, plus another 40 Caddo. The attempts at parley failed and Bowie and his group fought for their lives for the next 13hours. When the Indians finally retreated, Bowie reportedly had lost only one man, while more than 40Indians had been killed and 30 were wounded. In the meantime, a party of friendly Comanche rode into San Antonio bringing word of the raiding party, which outnumbered the Bowie expedition by 14 to 1. The citizens of San Antonio believed {{the members of the}} Bowie expedition must have perished, and Ursula Bowie began wearing widow's weeds.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in August 1591, Hues joined Cavendish {{on another}} attempt to {{circumnavigate}} the globe. Sailing on the Leicester, they were accompanied by the explorer John Davis on the Desire. Cavendish and Davis agreed that they would part company once they had cleared the Strait of Magellan between Chile and Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego, as Davis intended to sail to America <b>to</b> <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Northwest Passage. The expedition was ultimately unsuccessful, although Davis did discover the Falkland Islands. In the meantime, delayed in small harbours in the Strait with crew members dying from the cold, illness and starvation, Cavendish turned back eastwards to return to England. He was plagued by mutinous crewmen, and also by natives and Portuguese who attacked his sailors seeking food and water on shore. Increasingly depressed, Cavendish died in 1592 somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean, possibly a suicide.|$|E
5|$|Cave Story {{takes place}} within the {{cavernous}} interior of a floating island. The island is populated by Mimigas, a race of sentient, rabbit-like creatures. A particular species of red flower that grows in the island causes the normally peaceful Mimigas to fall into a violent frenzy when ingested. The island also conceals an artifact called the Demon Crown, which has vast magical powers. An army of robot soldiers {{was sent to the}} floating island on a military expedition, seeking to harness the Demon Crown as a weapon for wars on the surface world. These robots slaughtered Mimigas indiscriminately in their search for the crown, but were defeated when the Mimigas decided to eat the red flowers as a last resort. Shortly before the game begins, Professor Booster, the Sakamoto family, and various assistants formed a scientific party to research the island, but they became stranded when their medical doctor managed to acquire the Crown: he then forced the expedition <b>to</b> <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> red flowers.|$|E

The staff said that ambulances were functioning in accordance with the plan until about 6:00am, when an alleged call from the Ministry of Interior ordered all but two ambulances to head back to the SMC.
