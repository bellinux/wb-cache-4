5|$|Psoriasis {{can affect}} <b>the</b> <b>nails</b> and {{produces}} {{a variety of}} changes in the appearance of finger and toe nails. Nail psoriasis occurs in 40–45% of people with psoriasis affecting the skin and has a lifetime incidence of 80–90% in those with psoriatic arthritis. These changes include pitting of <b>the</b> <b>nails</b> (pinhead-sized depressions in the nail is seen in 70% with nail psoriasis), whitening of the nail, small areas of bleeding from capillaries under the nail, yellow-reddish discoloration of <b>the</b> <b>nails</b> known as the oil drop or salmon spot, thickening of the skin under the nail (subungual hyperkeratosis), loosening and separation of the nail (onycholysis), and crumbling of the nail.|$|E
5|$|Ramalala Nahachhu (रामलला नहछू), {{literally}} The Nahachhu {{ceremony of}} the child Rama, is an Awadhi work of 20 verses composed in the Sohar metre. The Nahachhu ceremony involves cutting <b>the</b> <b>nails</b> of the feet before the Hindu Samskaras (rituals) of Chudakarana, Upanayana, Vedarambha, Samavartana or Vivaha. In the work, events {{take place in the}} city of Ayodhya, so it is considered to describe the Nahachhu before Upanayana, Vedarambha and Samavartana.|$|E
5|$|The bricks {{from which}} the house was built were fired in the {{immediate}} vicinity (along the banks of the South Branch Potomac River), and the brick walls were reinforced with hand-wrought structural iron angles. <b>The</b> <b>nails</b> used in its construction were fabricated by a local blacksmith, and the wooden sills and joists were sawn by hand. As of 2012, all the original windows, trim and building materials in the main section of the house were still present.|$|E

5000|$|The {{bleeding}} {{comes from}} <b>the</b> (vascular) <b>nail</b> bed underlying <b>the</b> (avascular) <b>nail</b> plate. A laceration of <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> bed causes bleeding into the constricted area underneath <b>the</b> hard <b>nail</b> plate. [...] Throbbing pain is common. <b>The</b> <b>nail</b> develops a black discoloration overlying <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> bed but under <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> plate.|$|R
50|$|It {{is located}} at the end of <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> (that is closest to the skin of the finger), but it still lies under <b>the</b> <b>nail.</b> It is not {{actually}} white but only appears so when it is seen through <b>the</b> <b>nail.</b> Outlining <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> matrix, <b>the</b> lunula is a very delicate part of <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> structure. If one damages <b>the</b> lunula, <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> will be permanently deformed. Even when the totality of <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> is removed, <b>the</b> lunula remains in place and is similar in appearance to another smaller fingernail embedded in <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> bed.|$|R
5|$|The four nails {{were made}} at {{different}} times, and this is reflected in their varying designs. One of <b>the</b> <b>nails</b> bears the name John Barker on its rim. Barker was a wealthy merchant who owned houses and storehouses on the Quay, in Wine Street and in Small Street. He was mayor {{during the reign of}} Charles I and represented Bristol in the 1623 Parliament.|$|E
5|$|Grill {{established}} {{a small scale}} trade monopoly at Godegård in 1775. Before he became owner of the ironworks, the farmers around Godegård had refined the wrought iron from the factory into large quantities of nails using small trip hammers. <b>The</b> <b>nails</b> were sold in Askersund. As a trader Grill would not abide this. First he decreed that the farmers had to buy all their goods at the ironworks' general store. Second, he forbade the farmers and tenant farmers to sell nails to the merchants at Askersund, at that time a center for nail trade. In this way Grill assumed control over all nail trade himself.|$|E
5|$|Narayan {{travelled}} to Lahore in 1943 and {{auditioned for}} the local All India Radio (AIR) station as a singer, but the station's music producer, Jivan Lal Mattoo, noticed grooves in Narayan's fingernails: sarangis are played by pressing the fingernails sideways against three playing strings, which strains <b>the</b> <b>nails.</b> Mattoo instead employed Narayan as a sarangi player. Traditionally, the sarangi is supposed to play after the singer and imitate the vocal performance, and play {{in the space between}} phrases. Mattoo advised Narayan and helped him contact khyal singer Abdul Wahid Khan, a rigorous teacher under whom Narayan learned four ragas through singing lessons. Narayan was allowed sporadic solo performances on AIR and began to consider a solo career.|$|E
30|$|Optical means {{magnification}} and a 6 - 0 or 7 - 0 nonchromic absorbable monofilament {{are necessary}} for nail-bed sutures. <b>The</b> <b>nail</b> is raised by using scissors or a delicate spatula starting under the free edge of <b>the</b> <b>nail.</b> It is carefully detached from <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> bed and, if necessary, <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> is removed from <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> fold by rotational movements [5]. <b>The</b> <b>nail</b> will be preserved and replaced like a biological dressing. This has different functions: to shape to the nail-bed fragments, to avoid adhesion between the roof and <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> bed, to support a possible associated fracture, like a splint, to decrease postoperative pain, and to improve tactile sensation during the healing period. Before replacing <b>the</b> <b>nail,</b> a few holes {{should be made to}} allow blood drainage. <b>The</b> <b>nail</b> should be firmly fixed {{at the end of the}} operation. Good insertion of <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> base into <b>the</b> sack bottom of <b>the</b> proximal <b>nail</b> fold is very important to prevent a dead space that may cause adherence between <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> matrix and eponychium and subsequent ungual dystrophy. To hold <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> into <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> fold, an X suture is preferable, avoiding passage through <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> bed with a U suture [6, 7]. While the new fingernail is growing, <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> used as a splint will be pushed off and substituted in 1 – 3  months. It is desirable not to remove <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> or <b>the</b> substitute so as to prevent <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> bed drying our. Steri-Strips may help keep <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> in situ during fingernail regrowth.|$|R
30|$|In {{all other}} cases, <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> bed may be raised and {{evaluated}} under magnification {{in order to}} carefully examine the characteristic of the lesion. If only the sterile matrix is damaged, <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> should be left attached proximally in <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> fold. When <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> germinal matrix is also involved, <b>the</b> entire <b>nail</b> should be detached by making two incisions on the lateral side of <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> fold. <b>The</b> <b>nail</b> should be left attached distally when dislocation of the proximal part of <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> occurs.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>nail</b> wall (vallum unguis) is the {{cutaneous}} fold overlapping {{the sides}} and proximal end of <b>the</b> <b>nail.</b> <b>The</b> lateral margin (margo lateralis) lies beneath <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> wall on <b>the</b> sides of <b>the</b> <b>nail,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> groove or fold (sulcus matricis unguis) are the cutaneous slits into which the lateral margins are embedded.|$|R
5|$|Under the {{existing}} {{command and control}} arrangement between the CIA, the AIRA, and the Seventh Air Force, the Air Force wielded little actual control over air support. In order to increase its dominance, {{a reduction in the}} role of the Raven FACS was called for. Instead, greater use was to be made of Nail FACs from Nakhon Phanom's 23rd Tactical Air Support Squadron which had recently begun transitioning to OV-10 Bronco aircraft. In the end, <b>the</b> <b>Nails</b> made increasing appearances over Military Region 2, but they never seriously encroached on the role of the Ravens.|$|E
5|$|Weisman {{explains}} that a common house {{would begin to}} fall apart as water eventually leaks into the roof around the flashings, erodes the wood and rusts <b>the</b> <b>nails,</b> leading to sagging walls and eventual collapse. After 500 years, all that would be left would be aluminum dishwasher parts, stainless steel cookware, and plastic handles. The longest-lasting evidence on Earth of a human presence would be radioactive materials, ceramics, bronze statues, and Mount Rushmore. In space, the Pioneer plaques, the Voyager Golden Record, and radio waves would outlast the Earth itself.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Peattie's {{landlord}} sneaks {{into his}} apartment for pain medication and finds Lynette's body in his bed. Immediately, she contracts a flesh-eating disease. After {{hearing about the}} incident on the news, Mulder goes to Peattie's apartment and finds the body, now headless. Peattie finds the Wieder family, whom Scully is protecting, and makes a poppet with Scully's hair and photo inside. He places nails in the doll's eyes and Scully promptly goes blind. Peattie breaks into the house, takes Scully's gun and stabs a poppet of Wieder, causing the doctor to collapse in pain. Wieder gets Peattie to admit that he's taking out his own guilt {{about not being able}} to save Lynette by blaming him instead. Mulder shows up, finds Scully's doll and removes <b>the</b> <b>nails</b> from it, allowing her to regain her vision and shoot Peattie. He is placed in a coma and Lynnette's body is shipped back to her home in West Virginia.|$|E
30|$|Treating {{subungual}} hematoma {{depends on}} the type of injury. When the hematoma is very small and not too painful, it is incorporated into <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> and progressively migrates to the free edge of <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> plate. Greater hematomas, involving up to 50 % of <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> bed, should be evacuated through two holes made in <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> plate (in asepsis, not necessarily with anesthesia) with a needle, a blade, or an incandescent clip [8]. The pressure of the hematoma under <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> causes evacuation of the blood, allowing reinsertion of <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> into <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> fold. Steri-Strips may eventually fix <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> in order to avoid dislocation. When > 50 % involvement of <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> plate is associated with a fracture of the distal phalanx, examination of <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> bed is suggested. The fingernail should be detached, the hematoma drained, and <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> lesions should be identified and eventually treated [4, 9].|$|R

5|$|The cloth {{support is}} visible {{in areas where the}} paint was thinly applied. Rusty nail holes {{can be seen in the}} lower border and across the top of the picture in an area of sky that was {{initially}} covered by frame. They indicate that the woodworking was positioned much lower than Bouts had intended; generally works painted on commission were placed by professional joiners who worked independently of the painter. The low placing of the frame however protected the underlying colours over the centuries from light; they are preserved as first laid down. The panel was originally attached to its frame by pegs and nails; <b>the</b> <b>nails</b> would have been used to attach the linen to the underlying wooden frame.|$|E
5|$|There {{are five}} main types of {{psoriasis}}: plaque, guttate, inverse, pustular, and erythrodermic. Plaque psoriasis, {{also known as}} psoriasis vulgaris, makes up about 90 percent of cases. It typically presents as red patches with white scales on top. Areas of the body most commonly affected are {{the back of the}} forearms, shins, navel area, and scalp. Guttate psoriasis has drop-shaped lesions. Pustular psoriasis presents as small non-infectious pus-filled blisters. Inverse psoriasis forms red patches in skin folds. Erythrodermic psoriasis occurs when the rash becomes very widespread, and can develop from any of the other types. Fingernails and toenails are affected in most people with psoriasis at some point in time. This may include pits in <b>the</b> <b>nails</b> or changes in nail color.|$|E
5|$|Whale {{was born}} in Dudley, England, the sixth of seven {{children}} of William, a blast furnaceman, and Sarah, a nurse. He attended Kates Hill Board School, followed by Bayliss Charity School and finally Dudley Blue Coat School. His attendance stopped in his teenage years because the cost would have been prohibitive and his labor was needed to help support the family. Thought not physically strong enough to follow his brothers into the local heavy industries, Whale started work as a cobbler, reclaiming <b>the</b> <b>nails</b> he recovered from replaced soles and selling them for scrap for extra money. He discovered he had some artistic ability and earned additional money lettering signs and price tags for his neighbors. He used his additional income to pay for evening classes at the Dudley School of Arts and Crafts.|$|E
50|$|Onychia is an {{inflammation}} of <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> folds (surrounding tissue of <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> plate) of <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> with formation of pus and shedding of <b>the</b> <b>nail.</b> Onychia {{results from the}} introduction of microscopic pathogens through small wounds.|$|R
50|$|Warts of {{this kind}} often cause damage to <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> either by lifting <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> from <b>the</b> skin or causing <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> to {{partially}} detach.

30|$|The {{blood supply}} to <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> unit {{originates}} from the proper digital arteries, proximal to the interphalangeal joint, that give off the dorsal digital branch which feeds <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> fold and matrix through the superficial arcade. <b>The</b> <b>nail</b> plate originates from <b>the</b> proximal <b>nail</b> fold and is bordered {{on either side}} by <b>the</b> lateral <b>nail</b> folds. <b>The</b> <b>nail</b> matrix {{is located on the}} ventral surface of <b>the</b> proximal <b>nail</b> fold. <b>The</b> phalanx is located under <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> without any dermis or subcutaneous tissue between them [10].|$|R
5|$|When {{the pilgrims}} reach the {{appropriate}} Miqat (depending on where they're coming from), they {{enter into a}} state of holiness – known as Ihram – that consists of wearing two white seamless cloths for the male, with the one wrapped around the waist reaching below the knee and the other draped over the left shoulder and tied at the right side; wearing ordinary dress for the female that fulfills the Islamic condition of public dress with hands or face uncovered; taking ablution; declaring the intention (niyah) to perform pilgrimage and to refraining from certain activities such as clipping <b>the</b> <b>nails,</b> shaving any part of the body, having sexual relations; using perfumes, damaging plants, killing animals, covering head (for men) or the face and hands (for women); getting married; or carrying weapons.

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>nail</b> {{plate is}} <b>the</b> {{permanent}} product of <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> matrix. Its normal appearance and growth {{depend on the}} integrity of several components: the surrounding tissues or perionychium and the bony phalanx that are contributing to <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> apparatus or <b>nail</b> unit. <b>The</b> <b>nail</b> is inserted proximally in an invagination practically parallel to the upper surface of the skin and laterally in <b>the</b> lateral <b>nail</b> grooves. This pocket-like invagination has a roof, <b>the</b> proximal <b>nail</b> fold and a floor, the matrix from which <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> is derived. <b>The</b> germinal matrix forms the bulk of <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> plate. <b>The</b> proximal element forms the superficial third of <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> whereas <b>the</b> distal element provides its inferior two-thirds. The ventral surface of <b>the</b> proximal <b>nail</b> fold adheres closely to <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> for a short distance and forms a gradually desquamating tissue, the cuticle, made of the stratum corneum of both the dorsal and the ventral side of <b>the</b> proximal <b>nail</b> fold. <b>The</b> cuticle seals and therefore protects the ungual cul-de-sac. <b>The</b> <b>nail</b> plate is bordered by <b>the</b> proximal <b>nail</b> fold which is continuous with the similarly structured lateral nail fold on each side. <b>The</b> <b>nail</b> bed extends from the lunula to the hyponychium. It presents with parallel longitudinal rete ridges. This area, by contrast to the matrix has a firm attachment to <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> plate and nail avulsion produces a denudation of <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> bed. Colourless, but translucent, the highly vascular connective tissue containing glomus organs transmits a pink colour through <b>the</b> <b>nail.</b> Among its multiple functions, <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> provides counterpressure to the pulp that {{is essential to the}} tactile sensation involving the fingers and to the prevention of the hypertrophy of the distal wall tissue, produced after <b>nail</b> loss of <b>the</b> great toe <b>nail.</b> Journal ArticleFLWINinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
