5|$|Although adult lions have {{no natural}} predators, {{evidence}} suggests <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> die violently from humans or other lions. Lions often inflict serious injuries on each other, either members of different prides encountering {{each other in}} territorial disputes, or {{members of the same}} pride fighting at a kill. Crippled lions and lion cubs may fall victim to hyenas, leopards, or be trampled by buffalo or elephants, and careless lions may be maimed when hunting prey.|$|E
5|$|Ammianus {{reports that}} 6,000 Germans perished on the {{battlefield}} and in the pursuit on land. (Libanius gives a figure of 8,000). Thousands more drowned {{as they tried to}} get across the river. It is thus likely that {{about a third of the}} German force lost their lives. However, it appears <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> escaped, including the eight reges alongside Chnodomar. The Romans lost just 243 men, including four tribuni (regimental commanders) of which two were commanders of cataphracti.|$|E
5|$|During the Gulf War of 1991, the {{air superiority}} of the {{coalition}} forces was so great <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> of Iraqi Su-25s did not even manage to get airborne. On 25 January 1991, seven Iraqi Air Force Su-25s fled from Iraq and landed in Iran.|$|E

5000|$|Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote a {{dissenting opinion}} {{in which she}} argued the {{evidence}} should be inadmissible and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority's</b> opinion will [...] "corrode all our civil liberties"; Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg joined all but part IV of Justice Sotomayor's opinion. Justice Elena Kagan also wrote a dissenting opinion, in which Justice Ginsburg joined in full, where she argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority's</b> ruling [...] "creates unfortunate incentives for the police".|$|R
5|$|Hearing of Olid's rebellion, {{and of his}} {{clash with}} González, Cortés sent his cousin Francisco de las Casas to bring the rival captains into line. Cortés was {{confident}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> of Olid's men would rally to las Casas, and only assigned him about 150 men for the expedition. Las Casas arrived off Triunfo de la Cruz as Olid was making preparations to attack Gil González Dávila, {{who was in the}} Naco valley.|$|E
5|$|In 1912, Vesto Slipher made spectrographic {{studies of}} the {{brightest}} spiral nebulae to determine their composition. Slipher discovered that the spiral nebulae have high Doppler shifts, indicating that they are moving at a rate exceeding the velocity of the stars he had measured. He found <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> of these nebulae are moving away from us.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, Romach {{and colleagues}} {{reported}} that dose escalation {{is not a}} characteristic of long-term alprazolam users, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> of long-term alprazolam users change their initial pattern of regular use to one of symptom control only when required.|$|E
5000|$|Judge Field largely stated {{his support}} for Judge Widener's earlier dissent, and argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority's</b> opinion allowed Snider {{to have the best}} of both worlds: [...] "to disobey, yet to be absolved of {{punishment}} for disobedience." [...] He also added <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority's</b> decision regarding <b>the</b> contempt charge undercut the authority of [...] "already beleaguered district judges" [...] who must see to day-to-day trial administration, and who [...] "do not live in the sterile and sometimes unrealistic environment of the appellate ivory tower." ...|$|R

5|$|In February 2010, the IMA {{shifted from}} current {{environmental}} control standards within their exhibition spaces, allowing {{temperature and humidity}} fluctuation of a few degrees {{on either side of}} the suggested standard. The IMA relinquished the standard after concluding <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> of artworks could sustain a greater range of humidity, so permitting the museum to save on the cost of energy bills and reduce its carbon footprint.|$|E
5|$|McCartney biographer Ray Coleman {{asserted}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> of the song's lyrics {{were written}} by Jackson, and given to McCartney the next day. Recording began at AIR Studios in London in May 1981. At the time, McCartney was recording Tug of War, the former Beatle's first solo album after the breakup of his group Wings.|$|E
5|$|The exact {{degree of}} Caroline's wealth was always {{problematic}} to trace, as {{the king had}} placed {{so much of it}} in different sources often difficult to locate and measure both during his lifetime and after his death. One 1912 source for instance reported that out of the king's estimated estate of $65,000,000, Caroline received $7,000,000, while others stressed still higher numbers, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> of it came from Congo shares.|$|E

5000|$|Also dissenting, Justice Sotomayor {{indicated}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority’s</b> {{reading of}} <b>the</b> exception [...] "cannot be reconciled" [...] {{with the rest}} of what Congress enacted in 1986: [...] "Congress could not plausibly have intended… for the saving clause to operate in <b>the</b> way <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> reads it to do." ...|$|R
5|$|The {{population}} in 1801 was 169. The 1831 census recorded {{that there were}} 51 adult males (over 20 years old) and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> of residents were labourers or servants, with over half the male adult workers being employed in agriculture. After reaching a high of 291 in 1821, the population declined {{to a low of}} 213 in 1871. The population rose thereafter so that it was 300 in 1931.|$|E
5|$|UB-43 sank no ships {{over the}} next eight weeks. Author Paul Halpern reports <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> of the German U-boats in the Mediterranean fleet were {{undergoing}} repairs and refits at Pola and Cattaro during January. Although no specific mention is made of repairs done on UB-43, the U-boat's inactivity in this period may be for that reason.|$|E
5|$|A {{topographic}} map shows <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> of the interconnected complex of tightly packed lakes with their valley-and-ridge landscape is primarily in Minnesota; {{the border of}} the landscape is the Canada–US border. This border is composed of the Pigeon River, and these Rove Formation lakes (going east to west): South Fowl, North Fowl, Moose, Mountain, Watap, Rose, South, Little North and Gunflint. The border runs approximately {{through the center of the}} lengths of these lakes. The only Rove-typical east-west oriented lakes lying in Ontario are Arrow and North lakes.|$|E

50|$|Chief Justice Burger {{added his}} own brief dissenting opinion, first agreeing with Rehnquist’s {{comment about the}} overbreadth of the {{plurality}} opinion, then lamenting <b>the</b> disruption <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority’s</b> decision would cause in forcing Congress to rewrite the law.|$|R
50|$|Justice Brennan also {{believed}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority's</b> opinion only addressed the privacy {{issue of a}} person's property, and ignored the possessory issues. He claimed that this could lead to pretext searches, which in his view should be suppressed.|$|R
5|$|Although the {{black-throated blue warbler}} is a {{socially}} monogamous species, males are frequently observed in territories of other males, suggesting the occurrence of extra-pair matings. Nestling parentage is identified by microsatellites in a study plot at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire. The results show that extra-pair fertilization occurs and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> of the extra-pair sires come from males in neighboring territories. Only very few extra-pair sires are from distant territories. This local reproductive interaction is also supported by another study conducted earlier, which finds that extra pair fertilizations are strongly and positively correlated with local synchrony {{but there is no}} significant association with population level synchrony.|$|E
5|$|Alvarado rested {{two days}} at Tazuzcalco, before {{proceeding}} to Miahuaclan, {{which had been}} abandoned by its inhabitants, then on to Atehuan (modern Ateos, near the Pipil city of Cuscatlan, capital of {{the province of the}} same name). Messengers from the lords of Cuscatlan brought promises of submission to the King of Spain, but when Pedro de Alvarado's army arrived at the city, he found <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> of the inhabitants had fled. Alvarado sent messengers to them, ordering them to return and submit, but they refused. Alvarado tried them in their absence, and condemned them to death; he branded all the Pipil prisoners as slaves.|$|E
5|$|Compositional {{information}} from the visible and infrared spectrometer (VIR), gamma-ray and neutron detector (GRaND), and framing camera (FC), all indicate <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> of the surface composition of Vesta {{is consistent with the}} composition of the howardite, eucrite, and diogenite meteorites. The Rheasilvia region is richest in diogenite, consistent with the Rheasilvia-forming impact excavating material from deeper within Vesta. The presence of olivine within the Rheasilvia region would also be consistent with excavation of mantle material. However, olivine has only been detected in localized regions of the northern hemisphere, not within Rheasilvia. The origin of this olivine is currently uncertain.|$|E
50|$|Justices Douglas, Black and Fortas dissented on <b>the</b> ground <b>that</b> <b>the</b> phrase “while {{away from}} home” goes to {{geography}} and not time. <b>The</b> dissent argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority’s</b> approach of interpreting the phrase as “overnight” incorrectly switches the focus {{to a time}} element.|$|R

5|$|Deep Impact. Debate {{continues}} {{about how}} much ice is in a comet. In 2001, the Deep Space 1 spacecraft obtained high-resolution images of the surface of Comet Borrelly. It {{was found that the}} surface of comet Borrelly is hot and dry, with a temperature of between , and extremely dark, suggesting that the ice has been removed by solar heating and maturation, or is hidden by the soot-like material that covers Borrelly. In July 2005, the Deep Impact probe blasted a crater on Comet Tempel 1 to study its interior. The mission yielded results suggesting <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> of a comet's water ice is below the surface and that these reservoirs feed the jets of vaporised water that form the coma of Tempel 1. Renamed EPOXI, it made a flyby of Comet Hartley 2 on 4 November 2010.|$|E
5|$|Evolution {{also does}} not require that organisms become more complex. Although the history of life shows an {{apparent}} trend towards the evolution of biological complexity; {{there is a question}} if this appearance of increased complexity is real, or if it comes from neglecting the fact <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> of life on Earth has always consisted of prokaryotes. In this view, complexity is not a necessary consequence of evolution, but that specific circumstances of evolution on Earth frequently made greater complexity advantageous and thus naturally selected for. Depending on the situation, organisms' complexity can either increase, decrease, or stay the same, and all three of these trends have been observed in evolution.|$|E
5|$|Following Germany's capitulation, the Allies demanded <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> of the High Seas Fleet be interned in the British {{naval base}} in Scapa Flow. On 21 November 1918, {{under the command}} of Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, the ships sailed from their base in Germany for the last time. The fleet rendezvoused with the light cruiser , before meeting a massive {{flotilla}} of some 370 British, American, and French warships for the voyage to Scapa Flow. Once the ships were interned, their breech blocks were removed, which disabled their guns.|$|E
