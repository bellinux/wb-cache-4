On 6 April a bomb attack took place at Ebrington Barracks in Derry. RIRA members lowered a device consisting of 5lb of homemade explosives over the perimeter fence using ropes, and the bomb subsequently exploded damaging <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> <b>and</b> an unmanned guardhouse.|$|E

5|$|Finucane {{continued}} to the pedestrian gate where he stabbed the officer controlling the gate, and two officers {{who had just}} entered the prison. This incident was seen by a soldier on duty in a watch tower, who reported to the British Army operations room {{that he had seen}} prison officers fighting. The operations room telephoned the prison's Emergency Control Room (ECR), which replied that everything was all right and that an alarm had been accidentally triggered earlier. At 4:12 pm the alarm was raised when an officer in the gatehouse pushed the prisoner holding him hostage {{out of the room and}} telephoned the ECR. However, this was not done soon enough to prevent the escape. After several attempts the prisoners had opened the main gate, and were waiting for the prisoners still in the gatehouse to rejoin them in the lorry. At this time two prison officers blocked the exit with their cars, forcing the prisoners to abandon the lorry and make their way to the outer fence which was 25 yards away. Four prisoners attacked one of the officers and hijacked his car, which they drove towards the external gate. They crashed into a car near the gate and abandoned the car. Two escaped through the gate, one was captured exiting the car, and another was captured after being chased by a soldier. At the main gate, a prison officer was shot in the leg while chasing the only two prisoners who had not yet reached the outer fence. The prisoner who fired the shot was captured after being shot and wounded by a soldier in a watch tower, and the other prisoner was captured after falling. The other prisoners escaped over <b>the</b> <b>fence,</b> <b>and</b> by 4:18 pm the main gate was closed and the prison secured, after 35 prisoners had breached the prison perimeter. The escape was the biggest in both British and Irish history, and the biggest in Europe since World War II.|$|E
5|$|While largely {{forced on}} Graham by the {{inadequate}} forces available and the inherent contradictions of Australian strategic policy, his decision was {{contrary to the}} advice of the senior task force engineer, Major Brian Florence. A number of senior infantry officers had also resisted the idea, including one of Graham's battalion commanders, Lieutenant Colonel John Warr, commanding officer 5 RAR, who had served in the Korean War where the Australians had suffered a large number of casualties from mines originally laid by other UN forces. Yet unlike many of his colleagues, as an Armoured Corps officer Graham had not served in Korea, and many of the assumptions he developed about mine warfare in North Africa had remained unchallenged. For the first six months the barrier minefield had resulted in a dramatic decline in Viet Cong infiltration, reducing re-supply movement by up to 80 percent. However, recognising the threat the obstacle posed to them, the Viet Cong had immediately begun attempting to penetrate it, cutting gaps in <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> <b>and</b> clearing lanes through the minefield to restore the flow of supplies, as well as lifting mines for their own use. Conceived to hinder the movement of the Viet Cong between their jungle bases and the villages on which they relied for supplies, the failure of South Vietnamese forces to protect the barrier minefield ultimately allowed the Viet Cong to remove thousands of mines, many of which were subsequently used against 1 ATF. While in keeping with the orthodoxy of Australian counter-insurgency doctrine, Graham's strategy ultimately proved both controversial and costly, and despite initial success, the minefield became a source of munitions for the Viet Cong and later {{the decision was made to}} remove it amid growing casualties.|$|E

40|$|Wind tunnel {{tests were}} {{conducted}} on two devices {{for the purpose of}} lift augmentation on a 60 deg delta wing at low speed.

25|$|In {{complete}} {{contrast to}} the suspended phase of a gallop, when a horse jumps over a fence, the legs are stretched out while in the air, and the front legs hit the ground before the hind legs. Essentially, the horse takes the first two steps of a galloping stride on the take-off side of <b>the</b> <b>fence,</b> <b>and</b> the other two steps on the landing side. A horse has to collect its hindquarters after a jump to strike off into the next stride.|$|E
25|$|Although some locals welcomed <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> <b>and</b> {{regarded}} it as {{a tourist}} attraction, others viewed it as an eyesore and embarrassment, and as a potential hazard to drivers using the road. Frequent legal attempts were consequently made to see it removed. These attempts were increased in early 2006, accompanied by a further removal of some 200 of the bras. Some locals claimed {{that a number of}} Japanese students who are being educated in nearby Wanaka could get offended by the fence, as well as many other Asians or South Africans.|$|E

25|$|Riders jumping low fences {{may wish}} for an {{intermediate}} length stirrup that can allow the horse some freedom of movement, while supporting the rider over <b>the</b> <b>fence,</b> <b>and</b> still providing enough leg for excellent communication. A rider travelling rapidly cross-country, over varying terrain while fox hunting or endurance riding, {{will also have}} an intermediate stirrup, needing to strike a compromise between mobility for the horse and the need of the rider to not be unseated. In the western rodeo sport of calf roping, a moderately short stirrup is also required to help the horse to sprint quickly from the box, and to allow the cowboy the freedom to swing a lariat.|$|E
25|$|By 1908, a {{new record}} {{attendance}} of 50,261 was set, {{on a day when}} the crowd was so huge that it broke through <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> <b>and</b> filed onto the ground, sitting around the boundary line to watch the action. This figure was beaten in the 1912 Grand Final when 54,463 saw Essendon defeat South Melbourne. The big finals crowds (and increasing cricket attendances) prompted the MCC to cut down the eleven fifty-year-old elm trees inside the ground and turn the stadium into a concrete bowl, complete with extra stands and standing room. The record fell again in the last grand final before World War I, when the excitement of St Kilda's first premiership attempt drew 59,479 spectators.|$|E
25|$|Combining a small culvert Fence with a Pond Leveler Pipe {{is another}} {{effective}} method to protect culverts from beaver damming. The culvert fence is made {{small enough to}} encourage the beavers to dam on it, but the resulting pond is prevented from rising to a dangerous level by a Pond Leveler Pipe installed through the culvert fence. <b>The</b> <b>Fence</b> <b>and</b> Pipe flow device needs very little maintenance and limits where and how high the beavers can dam; however, to be most effective, the intake end of the pipe should usually sit in at least 3 feet of water. When this water depth is not possible, a simple Culvert Protective Fence {{may be the best}} option.|$|E

25|$|So {{when the}} MCG was finally relinquished by the {{government}} in August 1946, there was great expectation in the buildup to the grand final, where Essendon booted a record score to defeat Melbourne. Attendances were back to 1930s levels by 1947 and 85,815 turned up to see Carlton beat Essendon by a solitary point; a similar crowd a year later watched the Bombers and Demons play the first draw in grand final history. Melbourne won the replay the following week. The sight of thousands sitting between <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> <b>and</b> the boundary line, first seen in the late 1930s, was now usual at the grand final. Spectators were admitted on a first-come basis, and thousands took to lining up outside the stadium {{in the days before the}} match to gain the best vantage point when the gates opened on the morning of the match. Some reservations were raised about spectator safety as the MCG was clearly being filled above its capacity.|$|E
25|$|Improvements {{continued}} in the Square, with the aid and advice of Director of the Brisbane Botanic Gardens, Walter Hill, who {{spent a great deal}} of time travelling to various squares and parks in Queensland and reporting upon their condition and improvements. In 1876, Hill visited Queen's Parks in Ipswich, Toowoomba and Warwick, and wrote extensive reports of both these and other parks and squares in these towns. By this stage <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> <b>and</b> gates on the Recreation Square are reported by Hill as substantial and suitable, with gates for pedestrians at each corner of the two sections of the Square, and paths from each gate crossing the square diagonally so as to afford great facilities to pedestrians. Walter Hill, at the request of the Mayor of Warwick, supplied many trees, which were firstly tended in a nearby garden and then transplanted in the square. Many established trees and park features are extant in Leslie Park today, including the diagonal paths mentioned by Hill in his report.|$|E
25|$|Historically and traditionally, the {{transportation}} of Alaskan Athabaskans is pedestrian transportation {{and they are}} traveling on foot (in winter also birchbark snowshoes). Caribou were also pursued individually on snowshoes during winter by hunters using bow and arrow. Athabascan women regularly carry their children {{with the help of}} a baby belt. Dog (Lower Tanana łiga Tanacross łii) use in many Athabaskan villages is overwhelmingly for hunting and as pack animals. Dog sleds (Lower Tanana xwtl Tanacross xědl) are an ancient and widespread means of transportation for Eskimo peoples (western central Alaskan Yup'ik people and northern and northwestern Alaskan Inupiat people), but when non-Native fur traders and explorers first traveled the Yukon River and other interior regions in the mid-19th century they observed that only a few Athabascan groups, including the Koyukon, Deg Hit'an and Holikachuk, used dogs in this way. Both of these peoples had probably learned the technique from their Iñupiat or Yup'ik Eskimo neighbors. The Gwich'in, Tanana, Ahtna and others pulled their sleds and toboggans by hand, using dogs solely for hunting and as pack animals. Dogs sometimes were used to drive the moose into <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> <b>and</b> snares.|$|E
