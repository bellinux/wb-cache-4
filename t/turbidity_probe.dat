40|$|The {{synthesis}} of crystallization-based separation processes requires experimental solid-liquid equilibrium (SLE) {{behavior of the}} system under consideration, effective representation of such SLE data, selection of crystallization solvent, and determination of crystal quality under different experimental conditions. Often, because of the considerable time and labor required for a thorough investigation of a given system, some of these steps are omitted, resulting in a suboptimal process, or worse, completely missing a feasible, superior process alternative. In order to tackle this problem, a parallel solubility measurement system was developed.

Ultimately, the approach can achieve the measurement accuracy to adapt the derived hardware iment s impe n land concentration varies dramatically for such a purpose. Serious over- or under-estimating of loads using sediment rating curves have been observed particularly for short time-frames (Walling, 1977; Walling and Webb, 1981). Although bias-correction proce-dures can be applied, the substantial scatter evidenced by most rating relationships and complexities associated with hysteresis and exhaustion effects are considered to preclude any major sediment concentrations in runoff during large storms can be in excess of 10 g L 1 or even 100 g L 1, as increasingly encountered during Typhoon events in Taiwan since 2004.

Choosing an Instrument: There are many turbidity/optical backscatter probes suitable for continuous in-situ measurements.

40|$|The {{formation}} of barium sulphate is a persistent problem affecting {{the oil and}} gas industry. Due to its high insolubility and resistance to chemical/mechanical treatment, it is difficult to remove when formed. Barium sulphate formation can be predicted using thermodynamic models; nevertheless it is imperative to understand the kinetics of barium sulphate in order to predict more accurately the rate at which these scales are being formed and to identify the correct remediation technique. Several research works have been conducted on the kinetics of barium sulphate both in bulk precipitation and on surface deposition; however these studies were often conducted in a closed system (e. g. bulk jar test) and measurements were taken off-line. In a closed system normally the saturation ratio decreases as function of the time as scaling occurs. In the current study an experimental set-up has been designed to study the kinetics of bulk and surface scaling processes in-situ, in an open system and measurements were taken in real-Time.

Since the flocculants used {{in the water and}} wastewater plants {{have been shown to be}} potentially hazardous for the human health, it has become necessary to find flocculants less dangerous and more eco-friendly. This thesis consists of a systematic study to investigate the applications of natural submicron capsules (oil-bodies) and proteins extracted from oleaginous seeds for water treatment. Submicron capsules were extracted from different oleaginous sources and their flocculation activity has been investigated and characterized. We showed that they possess flocculation activity for clay suspensions comparable or even higher than the standard flocculants as alum and ferric salts. Moreover, the capsules have been tested for their ability to remove a range of pharmaceuticals from water. The investigation of oleaginous seed materials was further extended to the extraction of soluble proteins from press-cakes, the by-product of seeds after oil extraction. Thus, the flocculation activity of extracts from several press-cakes has been tested and compared to conventional flocculants, for example, alum and ferric salts. Finally, since lab-scale flocculation tests are usually off-line, in order to improve this methodology an on-line quantification method was developed.

40|$|For {{estimating}} suspended {{sediment concentration}} (SSC) in rivers, turbidity is potentially {{a much better}} predictor than water discharge. Since about 1990, it has been feasible to automatically collect high frequency turbidity data at remote sites using battery-powered <b>turbidity</b> <b>probes</b> that are properly mounted in the river or stream. With sensors calibrated to give a linear response to formazine standards, turbidity and sediment concentration should have a linear correlation close to unity for a given size and composition of suspended particles (Gippel, 1995; Foster et al., 1992). For events of limited duration, the physical properties of the suspended particles probably change very little in most streams. A few (less than 10) data pairs spanning the range of concentrations should be sufficient to reliably establish the relation between SSC and turbidity during such events (Lewis, 1996). This relationship provides a means for accurately estimating sediment loads during storm runoff events. In addition, the detailed turbidity record often contains the signature of sediment inputs to the channel from erosion and mass wasting (Lewis and Eads, 1996). For estimating monthly or annual sediment loads, the relation between SSC and turbidity will vary over time with changes in sediment sources, organic loading, or sensor calibration (Gippel, 1995). Thus, {{the use of a}} single curve describing the long-term mean relation will yield greater errors than for short-event estimation. Nevertheless, turbidity is probably more useful than water discharge as a long-term predictor of SSC. If the turbidity-SSC relation is roughly linear, load estimates will be nearly unbiased. In contrast, with sediment rating curves (linear in the logarithms), variance estimation is much more complicated (Gilroy et al., 1990) and such models frequently fit the data poorly and are subject to large errors (Walling an...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{utilised}} the River Frome, Dorset, as a study catchment {{within which}} to examine the seasonal effects of large aquatic plants, or 'macrophytes', on hydraulic roughness, water velocity, river stage and fine sediment distribution. The thesis formed part of LOCAR, a NERC thematic research programme, and was motivated {{by the need to}} provide empirical data to improve river management and to help achieve a compromise between vegetation management for flood control and for maintaining and maximising biodiversity. The thesis employed a hierarchical research design with linked data collection at macro-, meso-, and microscales. (i) Macroscale research employed archival River Habitat Survey data and primary river surveys to place the more detailed meso- and microscale work in context. The analyses revealed the existence of a distinct chalk river group and examined the place of the River Frome within this. This provided contextual information to aid extrapolation of the current findings and facilitates comparisons with previous and future research. (ii) Mesoscale research focused upon stage and discharge measurements, and grid-based measurements of hydraulic variables. The analyses showed that macrophytes can have demonstrable and quantifiable effects on hydraulic roughness and sediment storage, which causes seasonal change in the stage/discharge relationship. However, this effect varies according to channel morphology and riparian land use and is subject to the attainment of a critical biomass. (iii) Microscale analyses employed high-frequency <b>turbidity</b> <b>probes</b> to investigate sediment processes within macrophyte beds. Each vegetation patch acted as a unique sediment filter, the characteristics of which changed over the growing season, and varied with distance along the patch. The results also suggested that retention of fine sediment is size selective and varies according to plant architecture and in-channel location. The thesis findings imply that vegetation management must be approached with greater sensitivity to reach scale and sub-reach characteristics.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Pharmaceutical industries aim for continuous improvement in the manufacturing process of producing medicines. Demands on the pharmaceutical industries are to produce quality products in a quick and cost effective way. Designing a robust crystallization process so as to produce quality crystals with the desired polymorphic form, morphology, size and size distribution, will contribute towards meeting these demands. The Food and Drug Administration regulating body encourages the development of quality by design (QbD) approaches, involving the use of process analytical technology (PAT) {{for the design of}} the crystallization process. This method enables the design of the crystallization process to be more flexible in terms of variation in operating conditions and process parameters so long as the quality of the product is maintained. The aim of this thesis work is to use QbD approaches involving the use of PAT tools and solid state analytical (SSA) techniques to increase process knowledge and understanding, which is required for the robust design of crystallization processes. Discovery of all possible polymorphic forms of an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) is important for the design of a robust crystallization process in which product quality is consistent during scale up and to prevent late stage failures. This thesis work shows the importance of using PAT tools and SSA techniques for monitoring polymorphic transformations and for the discovery of new polymorphic forms that have not yet been reported in the literature. A range of PAT tools including the FBRM, <b>turbidity</b> <b>probe</b> and ATR-UV/Vis spectrometer detected polymorphic transformations during both cooling and antisolvent crystallization experiments using the model system sodium benzoate in water and a propan- 2 -ol (IPA) /water mixture. Information obtained from a range of SSA techniques provided supporting evidence for the discovery of a new channel hydrate, channel solvate and an anhydrous form of sodium benzoate. The problem of crusting (solid depositing on vessel walls) occurring within crystallization vessels has been investigated {{with the use of a}} combination of PAT tools and SSA techniques. The FBRM and <b>turbidity</b> <b>probe</b> detected a change occurring during the cooling crystallization process of para-amino benzoic acid (ABA) in ethyl acetate. Repeats of the experiments using the ATR-UV/Vis confirmed that the change was due to crusting forming on vessel walls and not a polymorphic transformation. PAT tools also detected changes occurring during a pH controlled polymorphic cooling crystallization experiment (Chapter 9), which was subsequently confirmed by SSA methods to be due to the formation of a mixture of products and not a polymorphic transformation. This research work shows the importance of using a combination of PAT tools and SSA techniques for gaining a deeper understanding of the crystallization process and to prevent misinterpretation of results, saving both time and money. Also this research work highlights the need for improvement within industrial scale vessel design, such as vessels with variable jacket height, to prevent the problems of crusting. Robust MSZW measurements are obtained at laboratory scale using the model crystallization systems para and meta-ABA in water. PAT tools used include the FBRM and <b>turbidity</b> <b>probe.</b> The robust MSZW takes into consideration variation in process parameters including ramp rate, vessel size (1 mL and 1 L), agitator speed and type. This robust MSZW can be used for the design of scale up experiments (pilot plant and industrial scale), increasing the likelihood of producing a quality product. Nucleation orders used within crystallization models were determined from the MSZW measurements. Results showed that the nucleation order varied within different crystallization set-ups (vessel size and mixing conditions) using the model system meta-ABA in water. Therefore model-based design and scale-up of crystallization processes must be used carefully and more detailed mechanistic models, which take into consideration the effect of mixing need to be designed to improve the generality and applicability of crystallization models. pH controlled polymorphic crystallization experiments were performed using the model systems meta and para-ABA in ethanol and water. A combination of 5 PAT tools were used in a single vessel to monitor the cooling crystallization process. PAT tools used include FBRM, ATR-UV/Vis, PVM, pH and a temperature probe. Various parameters including mixing conditions, solvent, pH of solution, strength and type of acid were varied to investigate the best conditions to produce salts. Results showed that careful selection of design parameters and salt selection is important for producing quality crystals of the desired morphology so as to prevent problems in downstream processing...|$|E
40|$|In situ {{turbidity}} meters {{are being}} increasingly {{used to generate}} continuous records of suspended sediment concentration in rivers. However, {{the usefulness of the}} information obtained depends heavily on the existence of a close relationship between fluctuations in suspended sediment concentration and turbidity and the calibration procedure that relates suspended sediment concentration to the turbidity meter’s signal. This study assesses the relationship between suspended sediment concentration and turbidity for a small (1 Ð 19 km 2) rural catchment in southern Brazil and evaluates two calibration methods by comparing the estimates of suspended sediment concentration obtained from the calibrated turbidity readings with direct measurements obtained using a USDH 48 suspended sediment sampler. With the first calibration method, the calibration relationship is derived by relating the turbidity readings to simultaneous measurements of concentration obtained from suspended sediment samples collected from the vicinity of the <b>turbidity</b> <b>probe</b> during flood events. With the second method, the calibration is based on the readings obtained from the turbidity meter when the probe immersed in samples of known concentration prepared using soils collected from the catchment. Overall, there was a close link between fluctuations in suspended sediment concentration and turbidity in the stream at the outlet of the catchment, and the estimates of sediment concentration obtained using the first calibration method corresponded closely with the conventionally measured sediment concentrations. However, use of the second calibration method introduced appreciable errors. When the estimated sediment concentrations were compared wit...|$|E
40|$|As land is developed, the {{impervious}} surfaces {{that are}} created {{increase the amount}} of runoff during rainfall events, disrupting the natural hydrologic cycle, with an increment in volume of runoff and in pollutant loadings. Pollutants deposited or derived from an activity on the land surface will likely end up in stormwater runoff in some concentration, such as nutrients, sediment, heavy metals, hydrocarbons, gasoline additives, pathogens, deicers, herbicides and pesticides. Several of these pollutants are particulate-bound, so it appears clear that sediment removal can provide significant water-quality improvements and it appears to be important the knowledge of the ability of stromwater treatment devices to retain particulate matter. For this reason three different units which remove sediments have been tested through laboratory. In particular a roadside gully pot has been tested under steady hydraulic conditions, varying the characteristics of the influent solids (diameter, particle size distribution and specific gravity). The efficiency in terms of particles retained has been evaluated as a function of influent flow rate and particles characteristics; results have been compared to efficiency evaluated applying an overflow rate model. Furthermore the role of particles settling velocity in efficiency determination has been investigated. After the experimental runs on the gully pot, a standard full-scale model of an hydrodynamic separator (HS) has been tested under unsteady influent flow rate condition, and constant solid concentration at the input. The results presented in this study illustrate that particle separation efficiency of the unit is predominately influenced by operating flow rate, which strongly affects the particles and hydraulic residence time of the system. The efficiency data have been compared to results obtained from a modified overflow rate model; moreover the residence time distribution has been experimentally determined through tracer analyses for several steady flow rates. Finally three testing experiments have been performed for two different configurations of a full-scale model of a clarifier (linear and crenulated) under unsteady influent flow rate condition, and constant solid concentration at the input. The results illustrate that particle separation efficiency of the unit is predominately influenced by the configuration of the unit itself.

40|$|Internal erosion, {{which causes}} 1 / 3 of all dam {{failures}} and damage to embankment dams, is formed when the natural water leakage through the dam brings eroded material. Sinkholes on the dam crest are formed when the soil gradually falls down where a soil deficit develops due to erosion. When these holes {{on the surface}} are detected, the erosion {{has been going on}} for a long time. There are reported damages to embankment dams which have been preceded by muddy water downstream from the dam. Monitoring the turbidity in the leakage water can provide a good picture of the status of the dam regarding internal erosion. The dam safety industry shares the same positive view regarding the possibilities with turbidity measurements, but the knowledge is limited. The purpose of this thesis is to develop the understanding within the dam safety industry concerning turbidity measurements and to further improve the usefulness of existing equipment regarding detection of soil particles. This is performed by the use of a literature review, contact with representatives from other industries, and by laboratory experiments. Turbidity is measured by a sensor registering the amount of light emitted from a light source and reflected by particles in a liquid. More particles in the solution infer greater reflection of light, and therefore a higher turbidity. Turbidity is measured in different units but FTU, FNU (International standard) and NTU (American standard) has been accepted as primary standards of measurement. The reference solution Formazin is used to calibrate these measuring units and thereby ensuring the relation FTU=FNU=NTU. Turbidity less than 20 FNU in the present study is difficult to distinguish visually. <b>Turbidity</b> measurement <b>probes</b> which are used for continuous monitoring of embankment dams are installed in monitoring pits collecting leakage water from the dam. Knowing the amount of suspended solids in the leakage flow is of interest from a dam safety point of view, but turbidity can only be correlated to the amount of suspended solids if all particles are of the same size and shape, which is not to expect. This correlation should therefore be avoided when relating to embankment dams. When other users of the technology were contacted, no direct problems or disadvantages with the monitoring method could be identified. In a laboratory setup similar to a typical monitoring pit with a water flow and continuous turbidity measurement, known fractions of a moraine material of the type used as an impervious layer core in embankment dams were added while the turbidity was recorded. Effects due to the placement of the measurement probe and the influence of air bubbles and other factor were also examined. The placement of the measurement probe in the measurement pit, the effects of air bubbles in the water and other external influences, proved a marginal effect on the turbidity in comparison with the impact of the fine soil particles. Generally it can be concluded, based on laboratory tests performed, that the finest particles in the material examined, affects the turbidity the most, and primarily the clay particles. Kaolin clay affected the turbidity the most in the laboratory tests and this is partly due to its small particles, but may also be explained due to the large specific surface of the kaolinite clay mineral. The effect on turbidity measurements caused by the specific surface of the particles should be further investigated as it could have greater impact than the grain size. Particle analysis showed that particles smaller than 0. 063 mm, which is likely to affect the turbidity, remained as sediments on the bottom of the barrel in the laboratory tests. For all materials with particle size less than 0. 063 mm in the laboratory tests, an exponential relation for the decay of turbidity could be observed, even in tests with different grain size and quantity added. This trend could possibly be used when determining a minimum interval for continuous monitoring. Kaolin follows the same trend, but affects the turbidity more than twice as much as myanite and the moraine material. A mean value of the turbidity is continuously monitored, and for a large embankment dam it is less likely that an internal erosion process can fail to be detected. Nevertheless, there is a possibility that a dangerously high level of turbidity can fail to be detected when using a long monitoring interval. <b>Turbidity</b> <b>probes,</b> method of monitoring, monitoring interval and alarm level should be carefully chosen for the purpose of each project and which particles to expect.

40|$|A {{study of}} the {{behaviour}} of sedimentation basins was conducted using both numerical and experimental model simulations. Two specific effects to be considered were the effect of wind action, {{and the effect of}} density stratification. The aim was to confirm that these effects are detrimental to the ability of a basin to remove particles from a suspension by the gravitational settlement process. The numerical model developed for this study used a penalty function technique incorporated in a finite difference scheme, This allowed the system to be solved explicitly, thus obviating the need to store and solve matrices, {{as is the case with}} implicit schemes. The model was validated by comparisons of the results with standard flows and experimental data. An experimental wind-water tank facility was constructed so that experimental simulations could also be carried out. Moreover, instrumentation (Laser Doppler Anemometer) was designed and assembled so that accurate measurements could be taken. The tank facility is approximately a one-sixteenth scale model of a typical field size sedimentation tank, as would commonly be found in a water treatment plant. By changing the fan around, the wind direction could be reversed, so that both co-current and counter-current wind cases could be modelled. To determine 2 ̆ 2 point 2 ̆ 2 suspended solids concentrations, an optical fibre <b>turbidity</b> <b>probe</b> was employed. It was found that the diatomaceous earth used as sediment gave an excellent linear correlation between turbidity and suspended solids. Thus it was possible tc accurately convert the point turbidity readings into suspended sediment concentration. The results indicated that, as wind speed increased, sediment removal efficiency decreased, with the counter-current case slightly worse than the co-current case, The trends were fairly linear for all the test runs made, indicating uniform reductions in efficiency for increasing wind speeds. As sediment concentration was increased the removal efficiency increased. Removal efficiency also increased as the flow rate was decreased. When no wind was blowing removal efficiency dropped noticeably in the presence of stratification, When wind was present the induced flow circulation prevented the formation of stratification, and so the results were very similar to those when no stratification was attempted at all. The overall comparison of the numerical and experimental values was good, indicating that the numerical model can give reasonable estimates of basin performance even with the presence of wind and/or stratification...|$|E
40|$|Open channel confluences {{are present}} in many natural and {{man-made}} waterways. The dynamics of the flow {{in and around the}} junction are complex; in particular, immediately downstream of the junction, the flow develops a zone of separation on the inner wall, with accompanying secondary re-circulation patterns. The structure of this complex flow is a function of several parameters such as flow rates in both channels, angle of confluence, channel geometry including longitudinal slope and bed discordance, boundary roughness and intensity of turbulence and has a major influence on bed erosion, bank scouring, etc. If in addition, one or both streams are sediment-laden, the structure of the downstream flow becomes even more complex due to additional variables such as variation in sediment particle size and sediment concentration. This makes detailed experimental investigation of such flows very challenging. In order to investigate the junction flow behavior, laboratory experiments and numerical simulations were performed in an equal-width, equal-depth and 90 ° flat bed open channel junction. Two separate computational codes PHOENICS and CFX were used for numerical simulations. Water heights, water velocities and sediment particle tracks were computed for different flow ratios and feed concentrations. For investigating the junction flow behavior experimentally, a laboratory scale open channel junction was designed and constructed at the hydraulics laboratory of the University of Wollongong. Experiments were conducted for clean water and sediment laden flows with different flow ratios and feed concentrations. The downstream Froude number was kept constant (0. 37) for all experiments. In sediment laden flow experiments, Corvic vinyl was introduced uniformly to the branch channel as sediment and then captured at the downstream end of the main channel to facilitate clean water flow through the main channel and sediment laden flow through branch channel. Water heights and turbidity were measured at different locations of the main channel utilizing point gauges and a custom made optical <b>turbidity</b> <b>probe</b> respectively. Numerical predictions showed higher water levels upstream of the junction followed by a sudden drop of water levels immediately downstream of the junction. This phenomenon is accompanied by flow separation at the inner bank. Higher velocities were generated adjacent to the outer bank and velocities were diminished towards the inner bank. The separation zone length and width were diminished with increasing flow ratio q* (q*=main channel flow / total flow). Using a ‘body-fitted’ computational mesh, conforming to the shape of the free surface, and carrying out a ‘water-only’ simulation imposing free slip boundary condition for the free surface produced accurate velocity patterns near the bed and the free surface, showing a good agreement with experimental results. In laboratory experiments higher sediment concentrations were observed adjacent to the inner wall immediately downstream of the junction, indicating particle deposition in the low-velocity separation region. It was observed that with increasing source sediment concentration from the branch channel, the turbidity downstream of the confluence increased while covering a larger area across the width of the main channel. Low sediment concentrations were observed upstream of the junction in all experiments. Higher turbidity gradients exist close to the junction whereas the turbidity gradients gradually diminish along the downstream of the main channel. The sediment concentrations across the main channel were controlled by the location of the shear layer. This layer was moved towards inner wall with increasing discharge ratios showing higher sediment concentration adjacent to inner wall of the main channel. For lower discharge ratios q*= 0. 25 and q*= 0. 417, sediment particles were dispersed across the entire channel width of the main channel while in higher discharge ratios q*= 0. 583 and q*= 0. 75, flow from the main channel occupied most of the cross section and therefore branch channel sediment was confined to a small area adjacent to the inner wall. Similar scenario was observed in simulated particle paths as more particle tracks were shifted towards the outer wall direction for lower discharge ratios q*= 0. 25 and q*= 0. 417 than for higher discharge ratios q*= 0. 583 and q*= 0. 75. The shape factor of the separation zone (defined as the ratio of maximum separation zone width S w to separation zone length S L) was found to vary between 0. 12 to 0. 15 for all experimental conditions tested. However the shape factor for clean water is found to be lower compared to sediment laden flow at all q* values. The current study provides new data contributing {{to a better understanding of}} flow and sediment dynamics at channel junctions. The application of this new knowledge will lead to improved design of river bank protection works and urban flood and erosion control structures adjacent to the junction of branching channels...|$|E
