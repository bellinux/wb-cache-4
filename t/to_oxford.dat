5|$|Construction from Brill <b>to</b> <b>Oxford</b> {{had not yet}} begun.

On 1 April 1894, with the proposed extension <b>to</b> <b>Oxford</b> still intended, the O exercised a clause of the 1888 Act and took over the Tramway. Work began on upgrading the line {{in preparation for the}} extension. The line from Quainton Road to Brill was relaid with improved rails on transverse sleepers, replacing the original flimsy rails and longitudinal sleepers. At around this time two Manning Wardle locomotives were brought into use.|$|E

5|$|In 1883, the Duke of Buckingham {{announced}} plans to upgrade the route to main line railway standards and extend the line <b>to</b> <b>Oxford,</b> creating a through route from Aylesbury <b>to</b> <b>Oxford.</b> If built, the line {{would have been the}} shortest route between Aylesbury and Oxford at the time. Despite the backing of the wealthy Ferdinand de Rothschild, investors were deterred by the costly tunnelling proposed, and the Duke was unable to raise sufficient funds. In 1888 a cheaper scheme was proposed, in which the line would be built to a lower standard and wind around hills to avoid tunnelling. In anticipation of this, the line was named the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad. Although the existing line was upgraded in 1894, the extension <b>to</b> <b>Oxford</b> was never built. Instead, the operation of the Brill Tramway was taken over by London's Metropolitan Railway, and Brill became one of their two north-western termini. The line was rebuilt a second time in 1910, and more advanced locomotives were introduced, allowing trains to run faster.|$|E

5|$|The Duke died in 1889, and in 1894 the {{trustees}} of his estate {{set up the}} Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad Company (O) {{with the intention of}} extending the line from Brill <b>to</b> <b>Oxford.</b> Rail services from London <b>to</b> <b>Oxford</b> were very poor at this time; despite being an extremely roundabout route, had the connection from Quainton Road <b>to</b> <b>Oxford</b> been built {{it would have been the}} shortest route between Oxford and the City of London. The Metropolitan Railway leased the Brill Tramway from 1December 1899, and from then on the MR (the Metropolitan line of the London Underground from July 1933) operated all services on the line. Throughout the operation of the Brill Tramway the track and stations remained in the ownership of the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad Company; the MR had an option to purchase the line outright, but it was never taken up.|$|E
5|$|The MR grew steadily, {{extending}} its {{own services}} and acquiring other local railways {{north and west}} of London. In 1872 Edward Watkin (1819–1901) was appointed Chairman. A director of many railway companies, he wanted to unify a string of companies to create a single line from Manchester via London to an intended Channel Tunnel and on to France. In 1873 Watkin negotiated {{to take control of}} the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway and the section of the former Buckinghamshire Railway north from Verney Junction to Buckingham. He planned to extend the MR north from London to Aylesbury and extend the Tramway southwest <b>to</b> <b>Oxford,</b> creating a route from London <b>to</b> <b>Oxford.</b> Rail services between Oxford and London were poor, and although still roundabout, the scheme would have formed the shortest route from London <b>to</b> <b>Oxford,</b> Aylesbury, Buckingham and Stratford-upon-Avon. The Duke of Buckingham was enthusiastic and authorisation was sought from Parliament. Parliament did not share the enthusiasm and in 1875 the Buckinghamshire and Northamptonshire Union Railway Bill was rejected. Watkin did receive consent in 1881 to extend the MR to Aylesbury.|$|E
5|$|When {{the first}} set of posted routes in New York were {{assigned}} in 1924, the portion of Route8 in the vicinity of Oxford became part of NY12; however, the former routing of Route8-a was not given a designation at this time. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, the former routing of Route8-a became part of NY220, a new route extending from Smithville Flats <b>to</b> <b>Oxford</b> via McDonough. The entirety of NY220 west of Oxford was closed to traffic in July 1935 as a result of damage caused by severe statewide flooding earlier in the month. The portion of the route from McDonough <b>to</b> <b>Oxford</b> took approximately three days to repair and was reopened by July17. The remaining section from Smithville Flats from McDonough was reopened by the following year.|$|E

5|$|After gaining {{first-class}} honours at The Queen's College, Oxford, Cruttwell {{was elected}} a Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford in 1911, {{and the following}} year became a lecturer in history at Hertford College. His academic career was interrupted by war service during which he suffered severe wounds; after his return <b>to</b> <b>Oxford</b> in 1919 he became dean of Hertford, and in 1930, principal of the college. It was during his tenure as dean that the feud with Waugh developed while the latter was a history scholar at Hertford, in 1922–24. This hostility was pursued on Waugh's part until shortly before Cruttwell's death.|$|E
