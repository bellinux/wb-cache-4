Ezarik's video focused on the unnecessary waste of paper, as the detailed bill itemized all data transfers made during the billing period, including every email and text message. Stories of unexpected billing issues began to circulate in blogs and the technical press after the Apple iPhone's heavily advertised and anticipated release, but this video clip brought the voluminous bills <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> of the mass media.|$|E
5|$|Although the Inaccessible Island rail {{may have}} been known to the Tristan Islanders who visited the island {{annually}} to hunt seals, the species first came <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> of scientists during the Challenger expedition of 1872–1876. When the expedition visited the island in October 1873, Sir Charles Wyville Thomson learned of the species and recorded observations made by two German brothers, the Stoltenhoffs, who had been living on the island for the last two years. Thomson was unable to collect a specimen, much to his regret.|$|E

5|$|Cape {{announced}} that he had stopped publication, but he secretly leased the rights to Pegasus Press, an English-language publisher in France. His partner Wren Howard took papier-mâché moulds of the type to Paris, and by 28 September, Pegasus Press was shipping its edition to the London bookseller Leopold Hill, who acted as distributor. With publicity increasing demand, sales were brisk, but the reappearance of The Well on bookshop shelves soon came <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> of the Home Office. On 3 October Joynson-Hicks issued a warrant for shipments of the book to be seized.|$|E

5|$|Chromium was {{discovered}} {{as an element}} after it came <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> of the Western world in the red crystalline mineral crocoite (lead(II) chromate), discovered in 1761 and initially used as a pigment. Nearly all chromium is commercially extracted from the single commercially viable ore chromite, which is iron chromium oxide (FeCr2O4). Chromite is now the principal source of chromium for pigments.|$|E

Playing at centre half-back, Harley's performance in defence earned him end-of-year All-Australian honours and brought him <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> of AFL scouts.|$|E
