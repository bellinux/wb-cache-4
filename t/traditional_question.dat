40|$|We {{argue that}} the <b>traditional</b> <b>question</b> ‘fixed vs. {{flexible}} exchange rates? ’ is not well-defined, because ‘flexible exchange rates ’ does not explicitly specify any particular monetary policy. In traditional analyses, ‘flexible exchange rates ’ was interpreted as implying a fixed money supply. But fixing the money supply (or fixing its growth rate at k%) is rarely advocated nowadays. To reflect today’s policy debate, the <b>traditional</b> <b>question</b> should {{be replaced by the}} question ‘fixed exchange rates vs. inflation targeting vs. price level targeting?’. We then build a simple macroeconomic model of a small open economy. The model incorporates an ‘outside lag ’ in the effect of monetary policy on aggregate demand, so that inflation targeting and price level targeting are always imperfect. We use this model to compare the stabilisation properties of three different monetary rules: a fixed exchange rate, a fixed inflation target, and a fixed price level target. We show that price level targeting is best for stabilising output, the real exchange rate and the real interest rate, relative to their natural rates...|$|E
40|$|The {{question}} motivating {{this review}} paper is, how can computer-based interactive narrative {{be used as}} a constructivist learn- ing activity? The paper proposes that player agency can be used to link interactive narrative to learner agency in constructivist theory, and to classify approaches to interactive narrative. The <b>traditional</b> <b>question</b> driving research in interactive narrative is, ‘how can an in- teractive narrative deal {{with a high degree of}} player agency, while maintaining a coherent and well-formed narrative?’ This question derives from an Aristotelian approach to interactive narrative that, as the question shows, is inherently antagonistic to player agency. Within this approach, player agency must be restricted and manip- ulated to maintain the narrative. Two alternative approaches based on Brecht’s Epic Theatre and Boal’s Theatre of the Oppressed are reviewed. If a Boalian approach to interactive narrative is taken the conflict between narrative and player agency dissolves. The question that emerges from this approach is quite different from the <b>traditional</b> <b>question</b> above, and presents a more useful approach to applying in- teractive narrative as a constructivist learning activity...|$|E

40|$|Prism is {{an answer}} {{projection}} system that combines the best attributes of traditional and Web-based question answering systems. <b>Traditional</b> <b>question</b> answering systems retrieve answers with pinpoint accuracy but limited coverage, {{using a small}} and reliable data source, while Web-based systems retrieve answers with broad coverage but limited accuracy, using a large but noisy data source. By {{taking advantage of the}} strengths of each system, an answer projection system can answer as many questions as a Web-based system while still being as accurate as a traditional system. In fact, Prism improves the performance of a <b>traditional</b> <b>question</b> answering system by 25 %. It improves the accuracy of answers retrieved from the World Wide Web by 10 %, and more importantly, it verifies answers retrieved from the Web by providing reliable supporting documents. By combining Prism with traditional and Web-based systems, we obtain a question answering system with high accuracy and broad coverage. by Lynn Wu. Thesis (M. Eng.)

40|$|Abstract. With <b>traditional</b> <b>Question</b> Answering (QA) systems having reached nearly {{satisfactory}} performance, {{an emerging}} challenge {{is the development}} of successful Interactive Question Answering (IQA) systems. Important IQA subtasks are the identification of a dialogue-dependent typology of Follow Up Questions (FU Qs), automatic detection of the identified types, and the development of different context fusion strategies for each type. In this paper, we show how a system relying on shallow cues to similarity between utterances in a narrow dialogue context and other simple information sources, embedded in a machine learning framework, can improve FU Q answering performance by implicitly detecting different FU Q types and learning different context fusion strategies to help re-ranking their candidate answers. ...|$|E
