On six occasions the Question Mark was forced {{away from its}} flight track to refuel, once over Oceanside and five times over El Centro. Maintaining contact formation became more difficult as {{the weight of the}} planes changed during transfer, especially since the refueling pilot could not observe the Question Mark. On January 4, after the aircraft rendezvoused over the Imperial Valley, both nearly impacted the ground when they encountered an unexpected air pocket while refueling. Hoyt developed a system whereby Woodring <b>tugged</b> <b>on</b> a string tied to the pilot's arm if the C-1's speed was excessive.

2500|$|Brown's neighbor, Pablo Fenjves, testified about {{hearing a}} [...] "very {{distinctive}} barking" [...] and [...] "plaintive wail" [...] {{of a dog}} at around 10 to 15 minutes after 10:00p.m. {{while he was at}} home watching the 10 o'clock news on television. Eva Stein, another neighbor, testified about very loud and persistent barking, also at around 10:15p.m., that kept her from going back to sleep. Neighbor Steven Schwab testified that while he was walking his dog in the area near Brown's house at around 11:30p.m., he noticed a wandering and agitated Akita dog (Brown's) trailing its leash. He saw that it had bloody paws, but after examining it, he found the dog uninjured. Schwab said he took the dog to another neighbor friend of his, Sukru Boztepe. He testified that he took the dog into his home where it became more agitated. Boztepe took the dog for a walk at approximately 12:00 midnight and testified that the dog <b>tugged</b> <b>on</b> its leash and led him to Nicole's house. There he discovered Nicole Simpson's dead body. Minutes later, Boztepe flagged down a passing patrol car.|$|E

These three fellows, fasting through the Ramazan, and over as rough a road, for the greater part, as ever shook mortal bones, performed their fourteen hours' walk of near forty miles with the most admirable courage, alacrity, and good-humour. They once or twice drank water on the march, and so far infringed the rule; but they refused all bread or edible refreshment offered to them, and <b>tugged</b> <b>on</b> with an energy that the best camel, and I am sure the best Christian, might envy.

Enemy soldiers who found seemingly discarded grenades would attempt to use them (expecting a standard time delay) only to be blown up the moment they <b>tugged</b> <b>on</b> the pull-cord. Another scenario was to wire an instantaneously fuzed grenade to a door-frame in an abandoned building. Then the pull-cord would be attached to the door. When the door was kicked open by opposing troops the grenade would detonate.|$|E

5000|$|In September 1947, {{just before}} the [...] "Salon Nautique" [...] in Paris, Cousteau insisted to {{organize}} a series of deep diving attempts to determine the maximum depth a scuba diver could reach. On September 17, Maurice Fargues made the first deep diving attempt near the French Navy base at Toulon. Maurice Fargues descended an anchor line with marker slates attached at 10 metres intervals, allowing him to sign his name on them to certify the depth he had reached, and periodically <b>tugged</b> <b>on</b> a safety line attached to his weight belt to let his colleague Frédéric Dumas on the surface {{know that he was}} alive. After three minutes, at a record-setting depth of 120 m, Maurice Fargues stopped signalling. Philippe Tailliez ordered that he be pulled up, and Jean Pinard dove to meet him at 60 meters depth, only to discover that Fargues was unconscious, his mouthpiece hanging on his chest. Resuscitation attempts were continued for twelve hours, but Fargues was dead. Nitrogen narcosis or oxygen toxicity had caused him to lose his mouthpiece and drown.|$|E
