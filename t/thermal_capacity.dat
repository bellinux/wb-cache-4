25|$|It {{was soon}} clear that strict demand {{reduction}} programs {{would be needed}} to avoid widespread blackouts. In June 2001, the government created the Crisis Management Board (CGE), chaired by President Cardoso himself. The CGE received special powers among which was the authority to set up special tariffs, implement compulsory rationing and blackouts, and bypass normal bidding procedures of the purchase of new plant equipment. Instead of resorting to rolling blackouts, the government chose to apply a quota system. Quotas were established for all the consumers based on historical and target consumption level, applying bonuses for consumption well below the prescribed level, penalties for over-consumption and some freedom for the large users to trade their quotas in a secondary market. The government's goal of reducing historical consumption levels by at least 20% for an eight-month period was successfully achieved, with the government having to pay over US$200 million in bonuses to residential, industrial, and commercial customers. This achievement allowed the system to overcome that long period without blackouts and brownouts and proved the potential of demand-side management and energy efficiency efforts, which were able to create a virtual capacity of 4,000MW, helping the country to bridge the supply demand gap in a very economic way. In addition, the government launched a program for contracting emergency generation capacity, with bids for a total of 2,100MW of new <b>thermal</b> <b>capacity</b> accepted.|$|E
25|$|The Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province {{of northwestern}} British Columbia, {{also called the}} Stikine Volcanic Belt, is the most active {{volcanic}} region in Canada. It comprises {{a large number of}} small cinder cones and associated lava plains, and three large, compositionally diverse volcanoes, known as the Level Mountain, the Mount Edziza volcanic complex, and Hoodoo Mountain. In the south the volcanic province is somewhat narrow and crosses diagonally through the northwesterly structural trend of the Coast Mountains. Farther north it is less clearly defined, forming a large arch that swings westward through central Yukon. Volcanoes within the British Columbia portion of the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province are disposed along short, northerly trending en-echelon segments which, in the British Columbia portion of the volcanic province, are unmistakably involved with north-trending rift structures including synvolcanic grabens and half-grabens similar to the East African Rift, which extends from the Afar Triple Junction southward across eastern Africa. The Northern Cordilleran rift system formed {{as a result of the}} North American continent being stretched by extensional forces as the Pacific Plate slides northward along the Queen Charlotte Fault to the west, on its way to the Aleutian Trench, which extends along the southern coastline of Alaska and the adjacent waters of northeastern Siberia off the coast of Kamchatka Peninsula. As the continental crust stretches, the near-surface rocks fracture along steeply dipping cracks parallel to the rift known as faults. Hot basaltic magma rises along these fractures to create passive lava eruptions. The compositions of lavas in the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province are mantle-derived alkali olivine basalt, lesser hawaiite and basanite, which form the large shield volcanoes and small cinder cones throughout the volcanic province. Many of them contain inclusions of lherzolite. The large central volcanoes of the volcanic province consist largely of trachyte, pantellerite, and comendite lavas. These lava compositions were formed by fractionation of primary alkali basalt magma in crustal reservoirs. A region of continental rifting, such as the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province, would support the development of high-level reservoirs of sufficient size and <b>thermal</b> <b>capacity</b> to sustain prolonged fractionation.|$|E
500|$|Klaphake {{experimented with}} a very simple design: an area of {{mountain}} slope was cleared and smoothed with a watertight surface.

At night the mountain slope would cool, and in the day moisture would collect on and run down the smoothed surface.

40|$|A {{very basic}} feature of {{hydropower}} electricity operation is that inflows to the reservoirs are stochastic variables. A decision about use of water, i. e., {{production in the}} current period and transferring water to the next period, has to be made {{in the current period}} while the inflows of the future periods up to the horizon are known only by their predictions. The need for both space heating and cooling depends on the outside temperature that is stochastic. Further reallife stochastic events in the case of a complete electricity system with transmission lines and <b>thermal</b> <b>capacities,</b> are transmission capacity being reduced due to transformer accidents, storms blowing down trees on lines, breaking of lines due to icing, etc., and <b>thermal</b> <b>capacities</b> going down due to accidents. Considering windmills the output depends crucially on the wind speed that is stochastic. The best the social planner can do in the current period is to formulate an optimal plan by maximising the expectation of the sum of consumer plus producer surpluses for future periods by applying backwards induction. The problem for finding optimal solutions of the hydro management problem created by uncertainty was recognised early in the literature (Little, 1955; Koopmans, 1957; Gessford and Karlin, 1958; Massé, 1946; Morlat, 1964).

2500|$|Large dinosaurs {{may also}} have {{maintained}} their temperatures by inertial homeothermy, also known as [...] "bulk homeothermy" [...] or [...] "mass homeothermy".
