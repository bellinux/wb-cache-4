In this paper we present several new polynomial-time bounds for StQP ranging from very simple and cheap ones to more complex and <b>tight</b> <b>constructions.</b> The main tools employed in the conception and analysis of most bounds are Semidefinite Programming and decomposition of the objective function into a sum of two quadratic functions, each of which is easy to minimize. We provide a complete diagram of the dominance, incomparability, or equivalence relations among the bounds proposed in this and in previous works. In particular, we show that one of our new bounds dominates all the others. Furthermore, a specialization of such bound dominates Schrijver's improvement of Lovasz's theta function bound for the maximum size of a clique in a graph...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{solve the}} open {{problems}} of translating, when possible, all common classes of nondeterministic word automata to deterministic and nondeterministic co-Büchi word automata. The handled classes include Büchi, parity, Rabin, Streett and Muller automata. The translations follow a unified approach and are all asymptotically tight. The problem of translating Büchi automata to equivalent co-Büchi automata was solved in [2], leaving open {{the problems of}} translating automata with richer acceptance conditions. For these classes, one cannot easily extend or use the construction in [2]. In particular, going via an intermediate Büchi automaton is not optimal and might involve a blow-up exponentially higher than the known lower bound. Other known translations are also not optimal and involve a doubly exponential blow-up. We describe direct, simple, and asymptotically <b>tight</b> <b>constructions,</b> involving a 2 Θ(n) blow-up. The constructions are variants of the subset construction, and allow for symbolic implementations. Beyond the theoretical importance of the results, the new constructions have various applications, among which is an improved algorithm for translating, when possible, LTL formulas to deterministic Büchi word automata. ...|$|R

40|$|In image restoration, {{we usually}} {{assume that the}} {{underlying}} image has a good sparse approximation under a certain system. Wavelet tight frame system has been proven to be such an efficient system to sparsely approximate piecewise smooth images. Thus it has been widely used in many practical image restoration problems. However, images from different scenarios are so diverse that no static wavelet tight frame system can sparsely approximate all of them well. To overcome this, recently, Cai et. al. [6] proposed a method that derives a data-driven tight frame adapted to the specific input image, leading to a better sparse approximation. The data-driven tight frame has been applied successfully to image denoising and CT image reconstruction. In this paper, we extend this data-driven <b>tight</b> frame <b>construction</b> method to multi-channel images.
