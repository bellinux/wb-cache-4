40|$|Summary: The initial {{location}} of necrosis {{may affect the}} limb salvage rate. This study of 130 patients with chronic toe ulcers or gangrene was performed to assess whether the {{location of}} initial necrosis in the toes affected limb salvage prognosis. The patients were divided into 2 groups according to whether the initial necrosis was in the great toe or in other toes. Limb salvage prognosis was determined retrospectively. In the great toe group, the rates of <b>total</b> <b>toe</b> loss and major amputation were 50. 0 % and 24. 4 %, respectively. When the initial necrosis was in other toes, these rates were 27. 3 % and 9. 3 %, respectively. Great toe necrosis is associated with significantly higher rates of <b>total</b> <b>toe</b> loss (odds ratio = 3. 10; P = 0. 003; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 43 − 6. 68) and major amputation (odds ratio = 3. 66; P = 0. 007; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 37 − 9. 79). The great toe is supplied by 3 source arteries, whereas the lesser toes are fed by 1 or 2 arteries. Therefore, necrosis initiating from the great toe may reflect the presence of severe vascular disorders. The great toe is also anatomically connected {{to much of the}} foot via the tendons. Infection is more likely to spread along these tendons, which may reduce limb prognosis. Thus, the initial location of necrosis may be predictive of limb prognosis...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{investigation}} {{is to increase the}} efficiency of treatment of osteoarthrosis deformans of foot and ankle joints by developing and applying new hi-tech methods of treatment – individual replacement of the foot bones and joints. Materiales and methods. 39 patients with the specified pathology were surveyed. Standard total ankle replacement was performed in two of them (STAR, W. Link), 16 patients underwent the first MTP joint replacement with <b>Total</b> <b>toe</b> system. In five cases with the 1 st MTPJ arthrosis there was observed total, subtotal and polylocal aseptic necrosis of the head of the first metatarsal bone. 10 patients had a similar picture of damage of the talus due to trauma. For these patients individual artificial implants of the talus and endoprostheses of the first MTPJ were developed. Modern techniques (CT, MRT) were used to early radiodiagnosis of posttraumatic talus damage. Results and Discussion. There were developed new methods of surgical treatment of such consequences of trauma of the talus as total, subtotal and polylocal aseptic necrosis — individual total replacement of the talus by original patented technique and replacement of the first MTP joint in cases of severe aseptic necrosis of the 1 st metatarsal bone’s head with the implant with the long stem (when standard joint replacement is noneffective). Pre-production models of implants and tools were made, and technical tests of designs were carried out...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Various {{methods have}} been used to {{redistribute}} plantar surface foot pressure in patients with foot ulcers. This study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of four modalities (fracture walker, fracture walker with insert, and open and closed <b>toe</b> <b>total</b> contact casts) in reducing plantar foot pressure. Methods: Ten healthy, normal volunteer subjects had an F-scan sensor (ultra thin shoe insert pressure monitor) placed under the right foot. They then ambulated on a flat surface, maintaining their normal gait. Dynamic plantar pressures were averaged over 10 steps at four different sites (plantar surface of great toe, first metatarsal head, base of fifth metatarsal, and plantar heel). All subjects repeated this sequence under five different testing condi-tions (barefoot, with a fracture walker, fracture walker with arch support insert, open and closed <b>toe</b> <b>total</b> contact cast). Each SUbject's barefoot pressures were then com-pared with the pressures during the different modalities. Results: All four treatment modalities significantly reduced (p < 0. 05) plantar pressure at the first metatarsal head (no method was superior). The fracture walker, frac-ture walker with insert, and open <b>toe</b> <b>total</b> contact cast significantly reduced pressure at the heel. Pressures {{at the base of the}} fifth metatarsal and great toe were not significantly reduced with any treatment form. Conclusion: The fracture walker, with and without arch support, and total contact cast can effectively reduce plantar pressure at the heel and first metatarsal head...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: Infective {{endocarditis}} (IE) is a feared complication {{in up to}} 38 % {{of cases}} of Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia (SAB). BSAC guidelines recommend echocardiography in all cases of SAB. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the incidence of IE in SAB using transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) as the first step in diag-nostic imaging. This study also sought to identify clinical predictors that could improve stratification of thosewith and without IE. Methods: A guideline was implemented that any SAB resulted in themicrobiology department (i) recommending that the patient be referred for TOE and (ii) notifying the echocardiography department, resulting in streamlined listing of the patient for TOE. All cases of SAB were then assessed prospectively at University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust between September 2011 and October 2012. Previously identified risk factors for complicated S. aureus bacteraemia were recorded. Results: There were 98 SAB episodes in <b>total.</b> <b>TOE</b> was performed in 58 (59 %) with a further 22 episodes imaged by transthoracic echocardiography alone. IE was diagnosed overall in 13 (16 %) cases investigated with echocar-diography. No risk factor for IE other than presence of a cardiac device was detected in this group (P 0. 013). Conclusions: The rate of IE found in SAB is high when TOE is performed first line. There are no clear risk factors to improve yield or the type of echocardiography to be performed.

40|$|Background: We {{intend to}} present our {{experience}} of varied presentation and treatment of 12 cases of congenital constriction ring syndrome. Methods: A prospective study of patients presenting with {{the characteristics of the}} congenital constriction ring syndrome was undertaken. Twelve patients made up of 7 males and 5 females were seen. The age at presentation ranged from nine days to 5 years {{with a mean age of}} 12. 9 months. Nineteen limbs were affected, made up of four right upper limbs, six left upper limbs, six right lower limbs and three left lower limbs. In the upper limb malformations involved total 36 digits, arm in one case and forearm in one case; in the lower limb malformations involved <b>total</b> 27 <b>toes,</b> foot in one and leg in four cases. Types of lesions which were found: constriction rings, intrauterine amputations, simple syndactyly. Results: Treatment options ranged from observation to multi-staged operations. Surgical correction of the constriction ring was done by excision and w-plasty to prevent or alleviate lymphoedema, multiple release incisions over distal limb to reduce the edema. Conclusion: Congenital constriction ring syndrome is of uncertain aetiology and could cause morbidity in the new-born. The syndrome and its complications are amenable to corrective surgery with good results. Early intervention is desirable for a successful outcome.

40|$|The {{concentrations}} of trace metals: cadmium, copper, nickel, lead and mercury, {{in addition to}} aluminium, iron and manganese were determined in the sediments and pore water (except aluminium) of the Forth estuary. Organic matter (as loss on ignition), <b>total</b> organic carbon (<b>TOe),</b> <b>total</b> organic nitrogen (TON), particle size and redox potential were also determined in the sediments. In addition, chloride, sulphate, conductivity, alkalinity, pH, dissolved organic carbon, phosphate and nitrate were determined in the sediments pore water. Trace metals in the pore water were determined using a modified preconcentration technique and measurements were carried out by graphite furnace. Mercury was measured using the p. s. a mercury specific fluorescence detector. organic matter (TOC & TON) in the sediments were measured using CHNS/O analyzer. Samples were collected at seasonal intervals {{for a period of}} 18 months on board the survey vessel "Forth Ranger". Six stations were selected to represent upper, middle and lower estuary. Sediment cores collected at each station were subjected to centrifugation under nitrogen gas atmosphere to separate the pore water after being sectioned at 2. 5 cm intervals for a depth of 10 centimetres. Concentrations of trace metals in the Forth estuary varied from station to station and from one season to another. Mean concentrations for sediments were as follows (mg) : lead, 56. 9; cadmium, 0. 22; copper, 38. 9; nickel, 33. 7 and mercury, 1. 86. For pore water, the mean concentraxxi tions (Jlgł) were as follows: lead, 3. 14; cadmium, 1. 86; copper, 31. 9; nickel, 24. 7 and mercury, 0. 075. Measurements of sulphates, nitrates, phosphate, conductivity and dissolved organic carbon were used to examine the processes controlling their distributions in the pore water. The results indicated that the distributions of nutrients (phosphate and nitrate) in the upper 10 cm seemed to be controlled by macro-infaunal irrigation activities and their values varied according to the overlying water conditions. The distributions of trace metals in the sediments were found to be controlled by particle size and organic matter both spatially and temporally. Vertical distribution of trace metals in the pore water were found to be controlled by redox potential variations especially for iron and manganese. Concentrations of trace metals (Pb, Hg, Ni, Cd and CU) in the pore water were found to be higher than that in the overlying water. Enrichment factors were limited to 10 - 50 fold increase. Lead and mercury were 10 fold higher while 50 fold higher were found for nickel, copper and cadmium. Benthic flux calculations showed a significant flux of trace metals both in the summer and winter. However, flux of copper, nickel and lead tended to increase in the summer. Spatially, the lower estuary showed a higher flux of trace metals than the upper and middle reaches of the estuary...|$|R
40|$|Background: Left atrial {{appendage}} (LAA) thrombus is an accepted {{risk factor for}} ischemic stroke. Following a literature review {{we were unable to}} identify a study that determined the incidence of ischemic stroke in patients with a confirmed LAA thrombus. The {{purpose of this study was}} to establish the incidence of ischemic stroke in patients with a LAA thrombus confirmed on trans-oesophageal echocardiography (TOE). Method: A ten year retrospective single centre study was conducted for the period March 2005 to February 2014 in St. Vincent's University Hospital, Ireland. All TOE studies performed during this period were reviewed. A chart review was carried out on any patient who had a LAA thrombus, left atrial (LA) thrombus or pre-thrombus state identified. Charts were reviewed for documented neurological deficits consistent with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack within six months following TOE study. Results: Overall 1903 TOE studies were reviewed. A <b>total</b> of 67 <b>TOE</b> studies detected a LAA thrombus, LA thrombus or pre-thrombus state. In the days prior to TOE, an ischemic stroke had occurred in two of the patients. Following detection of thrombus or pre-thrombus state on TOE and optimization of oral anti-coagulation (OAC), no patient had an ischemic stroke over the subsequent six months. Conclusion: This is the only study to date that has looked at the incidence of ischemic stroke following a confirmed LAA thrombus, LA thrombus or pre-thrombus state. This single centre study found low stroke rates over a six month follow-up period in patients with a confirmed LAA thrombus, LA thrombus or pre-thrombus state and optimization of OAC. Larger studies would be required to confirm these findings...|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} of the Beaver Creek retrogressive landslide south of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan was undertaken. Supplemented by data from previous studies of the landslide, information from the installation of four inclinometers and three piezometers was sufficient to describe the field behaviour of the retrogressive landslide and to determine an appropriate procedure for analysis. Additional information was provided by laboratory measurements such as direct shear testing of field samples. The Morgenstern-Price method {{was used for the}} stability analyses. Slope indicator measurements made over a three year period starting in August, 1977 clearly indicate the presence of separate blocks within the landslide with the rate of movement increasing from the scarp to the <b>toe.</b> <b>Total</b> movement at the toe is estimated at 175 mm, while movement at the scarp has been 65 mm. The rates of movement vary throughout the year with increases and decreases in the movement rate corresponding to increases and decreases in the piezometric level as measured by piezometers in the landslide site as well as those indicated by an observation well near the site. A common failure plane is located well below the river elevation at the contact between the stratified lacustrine deposits and the underlying tills. The landslide continues to retrogress, as is indicated by the formation of a new block at the scarp. This retrogression appears to be in response to erosion at the toe of the landslide. Stability analyses have shown that for the Beaver Creek landslide, the blocks within the sliding mass can be considered as a singular unit for purposes of computing the factor of safety. However, a series of blocks starting from the toe can also be analyzed in a conventional manner. The shear strength mobilized by the Beaver Creek landslide is approximately 7. 0 degrees, plus or minus 1. 0 degree, which agrees favourably with the 6. 6 to 10. 6 degree range of residual shear strength measured in the laboratory.

The objectives of this research were to investigate the effectiveness of iodine {{as a means of}} chemical disinfection. and storage treatment on the removal of E. coli as indicator organisms in polluted water and to investigate the application of these techniques to the provision of potable quality water in disaster situations. To demonstrate the viability. or otherwise of iodine as a means of chemical disinfection. various concentrations of iodine (0. 5 to 10. 0 mg/l) were employed to inactivate E. coli as an indicator organism in low quality waters prepared by adding kaolin. stream sediments. digested sludge. raw sludge and an artificial suspension of hydrazine sulphate and hexamethylenetetramine as the sources of turbidity and <b>total</b> organic carbon (<b>TOe).</b> Five turbidity and TOe ranges. three temperature levels and three pH values were also employed during the investigation of iodine disinfection. The results obtained were compared with those of an arbitrarily selected standard of 1. 0 mg/l chlorine. This investigation has demonstrated that under all the conditions for which dosages of 8. 0 mg/l iodine were employed. a water of virtually potable quality was obtained within a 30 minutes contact period. except those containing raw sludge of more than 7 NTU. Under none of the highest inveStigated conditions (350 C. 9. 0 pH and 93 - 100 NTU) of natural water samples was a dosage of 1. 0 mg/l iodine found to be an effective disinfectant. Both 1. 0 mg/l chlOrine and 2. 0 mg/l iodine were generally effective in the samples having lower TOe values Le. kaolin and stream sediments at all investigated turbidity. temperature and pH conditions. The above dosages were also found effective in the samples containing digested sludge at the lowest investigated ranges of turbidity. temperature and pH (5 - 7 NTU. 50 e and 6. 0 pH).

40|$|The {{operational}} {{requirements for the}} River Protection Project - Waste Treatment Plant (RPP-WTP) Low Activity Waste (LAW) and High Level Waste (HLW) melter systems, together with the feed constituents, impose a number of challenges to the off-gas treatment system. The system must be robust from the standpoints of operational reliability and minimization of maintenance. The system must effectively control and remove {{a wide range of}} solid particulate matter, acid mists and gases, and organic constituents (including those arising from products of incomplete combustion of sugar and organics in the feed) to concentration levels below those imposed by regulatory requirements. The baseline design for the RPP-WTP LAW primary off-gas system includes a submerged bed scrubber (SBS), a wet electrostatic precipitator (WESP), and a high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter. The secondary off-gas system includes a sulfur-impregnated activated carbon bed (AC-S), a thermal catalytic oxidizer (TCO), a single-stage selective catalytic reduction NOx treatment system (SCR), and a packed-bed caustic scrubber (PBS). The baseline design for the RPP-WTP HLW primary off-gas system includes an SBS, a WESP, a high efficiency mist eliminator (HEME), and a HEPA filter. The HLW secondary off-gas system includes a sulfur-impregnated activated carbon bed, a silver mordenite bed, a TCO, and a single-stage SCR. The one-third scale HLW DM 1200 Pilot Melter installed at the Vitreous State Laboratory (VSL) was equipped with a prototypical off-gas train to meet the needs for testing and confirmation of the performance of the baseline off-gas system design. Various modifications have been made to the DM 1200 system as the details of the WTP design have evolved, including the installation of a silver mordenite column and an AC-S column for testing on a slipstream of the off-gas flow; the installation of a full-flow AC-S bed for the present tests was completed prior to initiation of testing. The DM 1200 system was reconfigured to enable testing of the baseline HLW or LAW off-gas trains to perform off-gas emissions testing with both LAW and HLW simulants in the present work. During 2002 and 2003, many of these off-gas components were tested individually and in an integrated manner with the DM 1200 Pilot Melter. Data from these tests are being used to support engineering design confirmation and to provide data to support air permitting activities. In fiscal year 2004, the WTP Project was directed by the Office of River Protection (ORP) to comply with Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) requirements for organics. This requires that the combined melter and off-gas system have destruction and removal efficiency (DRE) of > 99. 99 % for principal organic dangerous constituents (PODCs). In order to provide confidence that the melter and off-gas system are able to achieve the required DRE, testing has been directed with both LAW and HLW feeds. The tests included both 'normal' and 'challenge' WTP melter conditions in order to obtain data for the potential range of operating conditions for the WTP melters and off-gas components. The WTP Project, Washington State Department of Ecology, and ORP have agreed that naphthalene will be used for testing to represent semi-volatile organics and allyl alcohol will be used to represent volatile organics. Testing was also performed to determine emissions of halides, metals, products of incomplete combustion (PICs), dioxins, furans, coplanar PCBs, total hydrocarbons, and COX and NOX, as well as the particle size distribution (PSD) of particulate matter discharged {{at the end of the}} off-gas train. A description of the melter test requirements and analytical methods used is provided in the Test Plan for this work. Test Exceptions were subsequently issued which changed the TCO catalyst, added <b>total</b> organic emissions (<b>TOE)</b> to exhaust sampling schedule, and allowing modification of the test conditions in response to attainable plenum temperatures as well as temperature increases in the sulfur impregnated activated carbon (AC-S) column. Data are provided in this final report for all the required emission samples as well as melter and off-gas conditions during all the sampling periods. Appended to this report are previously issued VSL Letter Reports on method development for monitoring allyl alcohol in melter exhaust streams, on the results of characterization of the selected AC-S carbon media (Donnau BAT 37), and on DM 1200 off-line tests on the AC-S bed; also appended are reports from Air Tech on emissions sampling, and reports from Keika Ventures on validation of analytical data provided by Severn Trent Laboratories of Knoxville, Tennessee...|$|R
