40|$|The United States is {{experiencing}} a shift in racial demographics. Recent projections suggest that minority groups will make up nearly 50 % of the population by 2023. Such increases have made the topics of race, ethnicity, and culture an appealing area of study for researchers and tourism professionals alike. Existing explanations of differences in African American travel suggest that decisions are made due to marginality (generally economic) or ethnicity (subcultural values). Because travel preferences may be a byproduct of learned behaviors passed down through generations, {{it is imperative to}} understand both current and historical aspects of leisure behavior. The stories of 12 African American tourists provided information which suggests that marginality, ethnicity, and issues related to discrimination impact their attitudes and behaviors regarding tourism choice.

Perhaps not since the awarding of the Games to Moscow and the subsequent politically-motivated boycotts has a Games provoked so much debate and controversy. Ever since the International Olympic Committee announced that Beijing had won their bid, there have been consistent media stories that threaten to undermine the potential economic and social benefits to be gained from hosting the Olympics. These were enhanced around the time of the event itself as high numbers of journalists reported from the city itself. The major concerns about security, pollution, doping, and the political issues around Tibet and Darfur cast a shadow of negative publicity over the Games. A number of the world’s more important politicians refused their invitation to the opening and closing ceremonies. Some athletes spoke out against political issues.

Despite the potential of Ra isotopes and Rn- 222 as tracers of groundwater discharge, {{the use of these}} radionuclides to quantify the groundwater inflow in coastal wetlands has been only scarcely addressed in the literature. The main goal {{of this study is to}} evaluate the use of Rn- 222 and Ra isotopes to estimate the contribution of distinct groundwater sources into a Mediterranean coastal wetland (the Peniscola marsh, Castello, Spain). The Peniscola marsh is a small shallow wetland nourished by groundwater coming from four different flowpaths: (i) a deep flow from the regional carbonate aquifer of El Maestrat, (ii) a shallow flow and (iii) an intermediate flow, both from the Irta Range and the detritic Vinaros-Peniscola aquifer, and (iv) seawater intrusion. Data on Ra- 226, Rn- 222 and salinity obtained in summer 2007 revealed that the deep groundwater contribution was 15 % of the total water inflow, whereas the shallow and intermediate flow paths represented 32 % and 48 %, respectively. Seawater accounted only for the remaining 5 % inputs to the wetland. Ra isotopes also allowed estimating the marsh water age in 1. 2 days. Both the groundwater contributions derived from Rn- 222 measurements and the Ra-derived marsh water age agreed well with the direct measurements obtained using propeller flow meters, evidencing the effectiveness of the used methods. An interannual comparison between the estimated groundwater inflow and the precipitation revealed that shallow groundwater flows respond to local precipitation, whereas the deep groundwater flow from the carbonate aquifer is dominated by a constant baseflow.

40|$|Extended {{abstract}} 1 -IntroductionIn today’s world {{tourism is}} one of the essential revenue generating industries that serves as a means for cultural exchange among nation as well. Rural-tourism is a branch of tourism that is limited to the rural environment with respect to the culture and traditional customs that include their hand-craft, behavior, hospitality, green-tours, farm-tours, hunting, their cooking manners etc. Any country that intends to attract tourists in this field should be equipped with the following two characteristics: the potential that is the natural resources and the ability to provide services and facilities for rural-tourism that is the accommodation. 2 - Theoretical basesThis idea was first established during the 19 th century in the western civilization when due to industrialization and urban-dwelling, transportation and welfare; people had more leisure time to visit rural areas in vast numbers. In the 20 year forecast program of development in the realm of tourism a national approach is adopted to promote the deprived regions’ potentials through manipulation of their natural/rural capacities and abilities. In order to finance the fundamental aspects of such programs, the authorities would face numerous problems. One of the measures that could overcome these problems to a certain degree is to prioritize the villages in a province based on their potentials then categorizes them as the village-tourism centers. For this purpose, an attempt is made to prioritize the potential villages by applying AHP, which is to validate them for investment, which will include all that is needed for Village Tourism. This issue has been of concern in different countries where putting the available natural resources at the National Tourist Industry’s services would be beneficial. - The study zoneCharmahal o Bakhtiar is a province with an area of 16, 532 Km 2.

As of subjectivity, this study is an applied one and the documentation, library works and field studies are applied for data collection. With respect to prioritization, among the 12 chosen villages, the data is gathered based on the theoretical aspects and criteria definitions in tourism development are determined. For criteria selection, some existing criteria were determined and by applying the two methods of internal and external experiments and finally by holding interviews with provincial experts, in the field of tourism 9 criteria and 9 sub-criteria are selected. For data analysis, the AHP model and Expert Choice software are applied in this study. 3 - Discussion:To begin with, 20 questionnaires were accurately designed, developed and distributed among the experts and authorities involved in provincial tourism industry in order to determine the criteria and sub-criteria weighs. The questionnaires were combined in Expert Choice software where one questionnaire was developed that contained the opinions of 20 provincial experts. The AHP is materialized, priorities are made and the selected villages for tourism are determined and presented in the following table with their ranking for investment: VillageAtishgahSar Agha SeyedHoreDehcheshmeSheikh AlikhanYase chahDezakAvreganDastgerd ImamzadehChalvanSavadjanDimeWeigh. 4335. 2044. 4773. 6384. 2040. 2426. 1993. 2619. 3725. 3769. 2719. 2772 Priority 311216101275498 4 - ConclusionAfter selecting the criteria and sub-criteria during weighing process in the Expert Choice software the designated choice were evaluated according to the criteria and sub-criteria and the village with the most and the least were selected which were Dahcheshme (0. 6384 pts.) and Dezak (0. 2918 pts.), respectively.

Therefore, the ecological carrying capacity of these resources and provide appropriate solutions to use them in the planning system is seen as something important. In this regard, and despite the tourist potential of the Sabalan and sensitive ecology of the process of increasing the productivity of these resources, Research to determine the environmental carrying capacity was necessary. Something that this article based on is steady. 2 - MethodologyResearch based on field studies, library and digital and satellite data. The data and information gathering tools in this study The Information contained in Ardabil province and also applications such as GIS are. In order to perform this article, map of the geographic area Sabalan from the armed forces has been production. And elevation levels in 10 -class classification and map of slope and aspect was extracted. Also, the digital maps of vegetation, rivers and other natural and human effects also were used. After collecting the information required, the digital editing and corrections was do and the tabular data added to they were. After obtaining prone zones tourism activities, maps were provided the development priorities. Finally, with the use of maps related to ecotourism activities, physical capacity and actual was calculated for each of these activities. 3 - DiscussionIn planning and tourism management, ability and suitability cognition of land for and applying quantitative methods to estimate the amount of available resources, key role in the planning and land management is performance. So in this article from Boolean logic for classify as zero and one for the feasibility of ecotourism zone is used. And as well as from GIS like the rational function AND, Query, Map Calculator used to for Combine and overlay maps and finally drawings ecotourism prone areas have been identified. Zones that Ecotourism can be more active were selected as Development priority. Also for identify the ecosystem of the area and the topic capacity sustainable tourism development within the range carrying capacity has been studied. The carrying capacity is a process of change ecosystem without structure and functioning to go beyond certain acceptable limitsTo estimate the carrying capacity natural zone for tourism purposes, the range of three different capacities namely, Physical Carrying Capacity, Real Carrying Capacity, Effective Carrying Capacity has been considered. Physical Carrying Capacity of the maximum number of visitors in a place and time that can be present. Real Carrying Capacity Is the maximum number of visitors of a resort location with Consideration the limiting factors of human and environmental. The basis of Functions defined and calculations, the highest percentage of surface zone (50 %) dedicated to winter sports and mountaineering. This zone is an area of 44, 602 hectares which is equivalent to 36 percent of the area intended. Calculations show zone that the development potential of ecotourism has five activities; including an area southwest of the village is moeel. The second priority development include zone that will at least four potential developments of ecotourism activities, including: hiking, water sport, walking, hydrotherapy. The third priority include zone that at least three activities of ecotourism, ski, hiking, Hydrotherapy. The fourth priority development include zone that at least two potential developments of ecotourism activities Such as hiking and waling have. The Fifth priority development include zone {{that at least one of}} this activites: hiking, waling, ski, Hydrotherapy and fishing have. It also calculate the carrying capacity the surface zone would indicate that the physical capacity at the regional level in all the activities listed 5575250 person ta day And The actual capacity is 2782049 person ta day. 4 - ConclusionStudies conducted in this research suggests that with increasing incoming tourists to the region And the lack of a comprehensive plan tourism in future of the carrying capacity of environment is reduce and this possibility exists that sensitive Sabalan ecology be Destruction. It is therefore necessary that potential of zone seriously to be considered. ReferencesArdebil Regional Water Corporation, (2006), Statistics and Mineral water Information.

40|$|Extended {{abstract}} 1 -IntroductionToday, {{the urban}} concept is not understandable without resorts in different forms {{and the results}} of urban development and environmental problems have made the development ad existence of resorts unavoidable. Ahvaz is one of the metropolitan cities. For the reason of its pollution, oil-dependent industries, hot and humid weather, having a long hot and dusty season, the citizens have been encouraged to travel to other areas with better climate. Therefore, it is necessary to locate a place with appropriate climate in the province. In this study, we use the descriptive combination and analytical method and this research is applied. We aim to examine three patterns: the final level pattern walkway areas of major cities, Robert pattern and standard distance pattern. Results show that, because of the long distance between Ahvaz and Malaga, the above-mentioned models could not determine Ahvaz walkway field. 2 - Theoretical basesThe Tourism has expressed as the specific spatial patterns. One of them is spatial patterns of urban tourism. Urban areas are important tourism places because they have historical and cultural attractions. The major cities have many diverse attractions, including museums, monuments, theaters, sports stadiums, parks, toy city, Shopping centers, and places of historical and architectural sites of important events with famous people. Moreover, if the tourist attractions are located in rural areas, urban movement supports the objective location. To examine the influence of large urban parks, three methods are used that are: A - The final model of the metropolitan parkB - Robert patternC - Standard distance model 3 – DiscussionThere are three different variations of climate in Khuzestan province: desert climate, semi desert climate and mountainous climate that are suitable for tourism. Ahvaz city has taken in desert climatology; therefore, {{there is a need for}} amusement places at mountainous climates. As map 2 shows there is a 200 km distance between Ahvaz and Malagha; thus, it can be a suitable place to attract tourists in Ahvaz city. In the previous issue of the metropolitan area of the walkway in Ahwaz based on Robert, it was found to be 39 km. It seems that the proposed index for the city of Ahvaz is not generalizable to all seasons. So that, in the longest period of tourism (summer), according to the climate characteristics of the region, the index reaches to more than 100 km. To determine the influence of travel distance, the standard model of distance is used to determine the pattern of metropolitan Ahvaz. For this purpose, a moderate center in the metropolitan area is selected. 4 – ConclusionWe aimed to examine three patterns: the final level pattern walkway areas of major cities, Robert pattern and standard distance pattern. Results show that, because of the long distance between Ahvaz and Malaga, the above-mentioned models could not determine Ahvaz walkway field. Because of four-season climate of Iran, more recreational and tourism travel is based on climatic differences between regions of the country. The positive point regarding Malaqa region tourism attractions is that citizens are not forced to leave the province because Malaqa is the most proper place in the province. Ahvaz region's climate is different from Malaga; Ahvaz is a desert region and many citizens like mountain regions; so, they choose Malaqa for tourism. The far distance (186 km) is accountable. Statistical analysis show that Ahvaz citizens welcome this region and they spend part of their time in Malaqa. Tourism infrastructure is undesirable in Malaqa but this recreation place can be enough for citizens if infrastructures are provided in this region.
