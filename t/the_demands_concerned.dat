40|$|Abstract—In the paper, energy {{recuperation}} and management in automotive suspension systems with linear electric motors controlled using a proposed H ∞ controller {{to obtain a}} variable mechanical force for a car damper is presented. Vehicle suspensions in which forces are generated in response to feedback signals by active elements obviously offer increased design flexibility compared to the conventional suspensions using passive elements such as springs and dampers. The main advantage of the proposed solution using a linear AC motor is the possibility to generate desired forces acting between the unsprung and sprung masses of the car, providing good insulation of the car sprung mass from the road surface disturbances. In addition, under certain circumstances using linear motors as actuators enables to transform mechanical energy of the vertical car vibrations to electrical energy, accumulate it, and use it when needed.

40|$|The study {{presented}} in this paper addresses the question of which nonlinear demand measures are sensitive to ground motion duration by statistical analyses of several case studies. A number of single degree of freedom (SDOF) structures were selected considering: (1) four oscillation periods; (2) three evolutionary and non-evolutionary hysteretic behaviours; (3) two target ductility levels. Effects of duration are investigated, by nonlinear dynamic analysis, with respect to six different demand indices ranging from displacement ductility ratio to equivalent number of cycles. Input is made of six real accelerogram sets representing three specific duration scenarios (small, moderate and large duration). For all considered demand quantities time-history results are formally compared by statistical hypothesis test to asses the difference, if any, in <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> <b>concerning</b> different scenarios. Incremental dynamic analysis curves are used to evaluate duration effect as function of ground motion intensity (e. g. spectral acceleration corresponding to the SDOF’s oscillation period). Duration impact on structural failure probability is evaluated by fragility curves.

Homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) {{is an alternative}} combustion technology that is cleaner and more efficient than the other types of combustion.

In this study a literature review on HCCI engine has been performed and HCCI challenges and proposed solutions have been investigated from the point view of Ignition Timing that is the main problem of this engine. HCCI challenges are investigated by many IC engine researchers during the last decade, but practical solutions have not been presented for a fully HCCI engine.

40|$|In-line sensors {{were used}} to measure quarter milk {{conductivity}} and milk temperature in the milking claw for monitoring mastitis in dairy cows. In a preliminary experiment, sensor data {{were used to}} develop algorithms and threshold values {{for the detection of}} mastitis. In a later experiment, these thresholds were implemented in a monitoring system. Thresholds were determined in order to detect severe (clinical) mastitis in an early stage and subclinical mastitis, respectively. Daily milk yield and temperature served to establish the severity of mastitis. Nearly all cases of clinical and 50 % of the cases of subclinical mastitis were detected. From results of measurements it appeared that onset and cessation of oestrus-related mounting activity could be predicted by pedometers. This information was used to correlate oestrus-insemination interval and conception rate. The probability of conception was highest between 6 and 17 h after increased pedometer activity with an estimated optimum at 12 h. To improve the reliability a detection model has been developed to process the measured variables in a combined way. It can be concluded that the detection model improves the sensitivity of oestrus detection by 10 - 20 %. The sensitivity of detection of clinical and subclinical mastitis appeared to be 90 % and 76 %, respectively.

Since the discovery of the spin-wave quantization effect in patterned magnetic thin films [1, 2] many works focused on the research of eigen-excitations in magnetic media with a reduced dimensionality. The amplitude profile, the discrete frequencies and the quantization conditions of spin-wave eigenmodes in stripes [1 – 4], rectangles [4, 5], disks and ellipses [6, 7] are now well understood and allow nowadays even for an engineering of the spin-wave eigenmode spectrum in such a small magnetic structure taking into account issues of geometric shape, multilayer stacks, and even magnetic domain structure. The magnetization dynamics of rings magnetized in the onion state show a large richness of possi-ble eigenmodes. Quantization of spin waves takes place not only due to the confinement in radial and azimuthal direction in the so-called equatorial regions at 90 ◦ and 270 ◦ (see inset in Fig. 1 for the definition of the angular positions) but also in spin-wave wells in the so-called pole regions a...|$|R
