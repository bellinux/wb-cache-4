500|$|Though the novel's {{language}}, and Müller's {{language in}} general, is praised for its precision--Peter Englund, {{secretary of the}} Swedish Academy, noted her [...] "extreme precision with words"—many things are left unsaid. As a reviewer for The Australian noted, the narrator is never named, the words [...] "totalitarian" [...] and [...] "liberty" [...] never appear in the book, and even Ceausescu, usually {{referred to as the}} [...] "dictator," [...] is named only twice, first when one of the characters (a Jewish WWII survivor) notes how <b>the</b> <b>greeting</b> [...] "ciao" [...] is also the first syllable of the dictator's name, and again when a comparison is made between Ceausescu, Hitler, and Stalin.|$|E

The Sunnah is considered a model of emulation for pious Muslims and has to a great degree influenced the Muslim culture. <b>The</b> <b>greeting</b> that Muhammad taught Muslims to offer each other, [...] "may peace be upon you" [...] (Arabic: as-salamu `alaykum) is used by Muslims throughout the world. Many details of major Islamic rituals such as daily prayers, the fasting and the annual pilgrimage are only found in the Sunnah and not the Quran.|$|E

500|$|The {{idea of a}} solo singer {{alternating}} with a chorus is extended in the following movement, the bass aria with chorus [...] (Peace be with you). A string introduction depicts in agitated forte passages in 4/4 time the attack of the enemies. John Eliot Gardiner describes it as [...] "a dramatic scena in which the strings work up a storm to illustrate the raging of the soul's enemies". In sharp contrast the bass as the vox Christi (voice of Christ) sings <b>the</b> <b>greeting</b> of Jesus from verse 19 of the Gospel, [...] "Peace be with you", three times, accompanied by woodwinds in dotted rhythm in 3/4 time, marked piano. Musicologist Julian Mincham describes the music as serene, a [...] "gentle, rocking, almost cradle-like rhythm creating a perfect atmosphere of peaceful contemplation". The upper voices of the choir (without basses) answer {{to the music of}} the introduction, seeing Jesus as help in the battle (""). <b>The</b> <b>greeting</b> and answering is repeated two more times in two stanzas of the poem, reflecting the strengthening of the weary in spirit and body (""), and finally overcoming death (""). The following fourth appearance of [...] "Peace be with you" [...] is accompanied by both woodwinds and strings, and peace is finally achieved. Klaus Hofmann describes the movement as an [...] "operatic scene" [...] and continues [...] "Bach resorts to unconventional means; he shows himself as a musical dramatist and, in the process, stresses the element of contrast: he comments upon the words of the faithful with agitated, tumultuous string figures, whilst Jesus' peace greeting sounds calmly and majestically, embedded in pastoral wind sonorities." [...] Bach adapted this movement as the Gloria of his Missa in A major, BWV 234.|$|E
500|$|Outside, Wesley {{finds the}} glitch, however he cannot simply {{turn off the}} system for fear of losing {{everyone}} inside. Instead, Wesley resets the simulation, briefly placing Picard and {{the others in the}} middle of a snowstorm before finding themselves back in Dixon's office. With the reset successfully clearing the malfunction, the exit doors finally appear. Despite Picard's warnings, Redblock and Leech exit the holodeck, but dissipate as they move beyond the range of its holoemitters. As they leave the holodeck, Picard thanks McNary for his assistance, who now suspects that his world is artificial and asks whether Picard's departure is [...] "the big goodbye", to which Picard replies that he simply doesn't know. [...] Picard reaches the bridge in time to give the proper greeting to the Jarada. The Jarada accept <b>the</b> <b>greeting,</b> heralding the start of successful negotiations.|$|E
500|$|The [...] lament [...] "Rheingold! Rheingold! Reines Gold!..." [...] (Das Rheingold Scene 4) is sung by the maidens {{at the end}} of Das Rheingold, as {{the gods}} begin to cross the Rainbow Bridge into Valhalla. It begins with the music from <b>the</b> <b>greeting,</b> but {{develops}} into what Ernest Newman describes as a [...] "haunting song of loss", which becomes increasingly poignant before it is drowned by the orchestral fortissimo [...] that ends the opera. [...] A slow version of the lament is played on the horns in Siegfried, Act 2, as Siegfried enters Fafner's cave to claim the gold—the lament, says Cooke, serves to remind us of the gold's true ownership. The lament is played spiritedly during the Götterdämmerung prologue, as part of the orchestral interlude known as Siegfried's Rhine Journey, [...] before a shadow falls across the music as it descends into the minor key of the [...] "servitude" [...] motive.|$|E
