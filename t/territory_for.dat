5|$|In the post-election {{speculation}} as to {{who would}} be given office under McKinley, Hay's name figured prominently, as did that of Whitelaw Reid; both men sought high office in the State Department, either as secretary {{or one of the}} major ambassadorial posts. Reid, in addition to his vice-presidential run, had been Minister to France under Harrison. Reid, an asthmatic, handicapped himself by departing for Arizona <b>Territory</b> <b>for</b> the winter, leading to speculation about his health.|$|E
5|$|Increased {{presence}} of white settlers in Indian Territory prompted the United States Government {{to establish the}} Dawes Act in 1887, which divided the lands of individual tribes into allotments for individual families, encouraging farming and private land ownership among Native Americans but expropriating land to the federal government. In the process, railroad companies took nearly half of Indian-held land within the <b>territory</b> <b>for</b> outside settlers and for purchase.|$|E
5|$|It had {{two main}} limitations. The first {{was that the}} Carlisle line was very {{circuitous}} compared with the competing Caledonian Railway (CR) route via Beattock, which also served Edinburgh; the route also depended on running over the CR from Gretna Junction to Carlisle, and needed accommodation at Carlisle station. The CR was to prove a formidable competitor for Anglo-Scottish traffic, both passenger and goods, and much energy and money were expended in securing exclusive <b>territory</b> <b>for</b> the G, and in keeping the CR out.|$|E

5|$|Maha Chakkraphat saw the Burmese army's retreat as an {{opportunity}} {{take advantage of their}} weakness, so he ordered Princes Ramesuan and Thammaracha to follow and harass the enemy out of Siamese <b>territory.</b> <b>For</b> three days, the Siamese chased the invaders, inflicting great losses upon them. Once the forces of Ramesuan and Thammaracha closed in, Tabinshwehti made a stand near Kamphaeng Phet, dividing his forces {{on both sides of the}} road. The Siamese in their eagerness fell into the trap. The Burmese captured both Prince Ramesuan and Maha Thammaracha as prisoners of war.|$|E
5|$|Sexual {{maturity}} {{is reached}} at between 1–3 years. Most Eurasian sparrowhawks {{stay on the}} same <b>territory</b> <b>for</b> one breeding season, though others keep the same one for up to eight years. A change of mate usually triggers the change in territory. Older birds tend {{to stay in the}} same territory; failed breeding attempts make a move more likely. The birds which kept the same territories had higher nest success, though it did not increase between years; females which moved experienced more success the year after changing territory.|$|E
5|$|The land in question, {{which had}} been part of the Seneca Nation's {{traditional}} <b>territory</b> <b>for</b> centuries before the American Revolution, comprised part of the Phelps and Gorham Purchase, a tract of land disputed after the war between claims of New York and Massachusetts. By a December 16, 1786 interstate compact, the states agreed that Massachusetts would retain the proprietary rights and the pre-emption rights, but New York would retain governmental rights. After the adoption of the United States Constitution in 1787, the federal government ratified their compact.|$|E

5|$|The {{underlying}} {{problem was not}} solved: Joseph's foreign policy dictated the expansion of Habsburg influence over German-speaking territories, and only this, he believed, would counter Prussia's growing strength in Imperial affairs. In 1785, Joseph again sought to make a territorial deal with Charles Theodore, again offering to trade portions of Bavarian <b>territory</b> <b>for</b> portions of the Austrian Netherlands. This time {{it would be a}} straight trade: <b>territory</b> <b>for</b> territory, not a partition. Although the Austrian Netherlands was a wealthy territory, it was a thorn in Joseph's side, opposing his administrative and bureaucratic reforms and devouring military and administrative resources he desperately needed elsewhere in his realm. Despite its problems, Joseph could not afford to give up the Netherlands entirely, so his efforts to negotiate a partial territorial exchange guaranteed him some of the financial benefits of both his Netherlands possessions and the Bavarian territories.|$|E
5|$|The yellow-faced honeyeater breeds in monogamous pairs in a {{breeding}} season that extends from July to March, with migrating birds nesting later than sedentary birds. They nest solitarily in all-purpose territories that both parents defend against conspecifics {{and other species}} including thornbills, spinebills, and silvereyes, although the male is involved in more aggressive interactions than the female. Within {{a breeding}} season females lay two or three clutches of eggs, re-nesting with the same partner in the same territory. Banded birds {{have been identified in}} the same <b>territory</b> <b>for</b> periods of up to five years.|$|E

5|$|A {{few days}} after this first encounter, on 14 August 1502, Columbus arrived on the {{mainland}} of Honduras. He dropped anchor at a place he named as Punta Caxinas, afterwards generally known as the Cape of Honduras, near the modern town of Trujillo. He claimed possession of the <b>territory</b> <b>for</b> the king of Spain, and the coastal inhabitants greeted him in a friendly manner. After this he sailed eastward along the coast, struggling against gales and storms for a month, until the coast turned southward along {{what is now the}} east coast of Honduras, and he entered calmer waters. The Spanish named this point Cabo Gracias a Dios, giving thanks for their liberation from the storms. Colombus sailed on southwards as far as Panama, before turning back into the Caribbean Sea to be wrecked off Jamaica, before being rescued and taken to Hispaniola, and from there returning to Spain.|$|E
5|$|According to his biographer, John M. Taylor, Seward {{picked a}} good time to absent himself from electoral politics, as the Whig Party was in turmoil. President Tyler, a former Democrat, and Senator Clay each claimed {{leadership}} of the Whig Party and, as the two men differed over such issues as whether to re-establish the Bank of the United States, party support was divided. The abolitionist movement attracted those {{who did not want to}} be part of a party led by slavery-supporting southerners. In 1844, Seward was asked to run for president by members of the Liberty Party; he declined and reluctantly supported the Whig nominee, Clay. The Kentuckian was defeated by Democrat James K. Polk. The major event of Polk's administration was the Mexican–American War; Seward did not support this, feeling that the price in blood was not worth the increase in territory, especially as southerners were promoting this acquisition to expand <b>territory</b> <b>for</b> slavery.|$|E
5|$|After {{a series}} of {{political}} and military machinations conducted by the U.S., the Pathet Lao, and the North Vietnamese in Laos that are described in the History of Laos since 1945, a Declaration on the Neutrality of Laos was signed in Geneva, Switzerland on 23 July 1962. The agreement, an attempt to end a civil war between the Communist-dominated (and Hanoi-directed) Pathet Lao, neutralists, and American-backed rightists, included provisions that required the removal of all foreign military forces and precluded the use of Lao <b>territory</b> <b>for</b> interfering {{in the internal affairs}} of another country – a blatant effort to shut down North Vietnam's growing logistical corridor through southeastern Laos that would become known as the Ho Chi Minh Trail.|$|E
