40|$|Abstract We study {{networks}} where end-to-end {{traffic flow}} {{is determined by}} domains with independent and competing interests. Such multilateral networks offer smaller domains the possibility to influence traffic flows if they agree to work together. We explore a cooperative game theoretic model that accounts for such coalitional behaviour. One objective is to model the tradeoffs between transitting <b>third-party</b> <b>traffic</b> versus satisfying one's own traffic demands. In contrast to previous work our focus is on long-term economic interests as opposed to short-term routing decisions, {{and we do not}} allow transferrable utility. This leads us to the notion of harmonious routing, where each node may only transit as much flow as it offers. This problem has connections to well-known results in optimization including Mader's T-path Theorem, confluent flows, Gomory-Hu trees and a classical result of Scarf in game theory. We end with a summary of many open problems...|$|E
40|$|Several {{off-the-shelf}} products enable {{network operators}} to enforce usage restrictions by actively terminating connections when deemed undesirable. While {{the spectrum of}} their application is large—from ISPs limiting the usage of P 2 P applications to the “Great Firewall of China”—many of these systems implement the same approach to disrupt the communication: they inject artificial TCP Reset (RST) packets into the network, causing the endpoints to shut down communication upon receipt. In this work, we study the characteristics of packets injected by such traffic control devices. We show that by exploiting the race-conditions that out-of-band devices inevitably face, we not only can detect the interference but often also fingerprint the specific device in use. We develop an efficient injection detector and demonstrate its effectiveness by identifying a range of disruptive activity seen in traces from four different sites, including termination of P 2 P connections, anti-spam and anti-virus mechanisms, and the finding that China’s “Great Firewall ” has multiple components, sometimes apparently operating without coordination. We also find {{a number of sources}} of idiosyncratic connection termination that do not reflect <b>third-party</b> <b>traffic</b> disruption, including NATs, loadbalancers, and spam bots. In general, our findings highlight that (i) Internet traffic faces a wide range of control devices using injected RST packets, and (ii) to reliably detect RST injection while avoiding misidentification of other types of activity requires significant care. ...|$|E

50|$|Collision Avoidance systems which rely on {{transponder}} replies {{triggered by}} ground and airborne systems are considered passive. Ground and airborne interrogators query nearby transponders for mode C altitude information, {{which can be}} monitored by <b>third-party</b> systems for <b>traffic</b> information.

40|$|The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is the {{dominant}} transport protocol in today?s Internet. The original design of TCP left congestion control open to future designers. Short of implementing changes to the TCP stack on the end-nodes themselves, Internet Service Providers have employed several techniques {{to be able to}} operate their network equipment efficiently. These techniques amount to shaping traffic to reduce cost and improve overall customer satisfaction. The method that gives maximum control when performing traffic shaping is using an inline traffic shaper. An inline traffic shaper sits in the middle of any flow, allowing packets to pass through it and, with policy-limited freedom, inspects and modifies all packets as it pleases. However, a number of practical issues such as hardware reliability or ISP policy, may prevent such a solution from being employed. For example, an ISP that does not fully trust the quality of the traffic shaper would not want such a product to be placed in-line with its equipment, as it places a significant threat to its business. What is required in such cases is third-party rate control. Formally defined, a third-party rate controller is one that can see all traffic and inject new traffic into the network, but cannot remove or modify existing network packets. Given these restrictions, we present and study a technique to control TCP flows, namely triple-ACK duplication. The triple-ACK algorithm allows significant capabilities to a <b>third-party</b> <b>traffic</b> shaper. We provide an analytical justification for why this technique works under ideal conditions and demonstrate via simulation the bandwidth reduction achieved. When judiciously applied, the triple-ACK duplication technique produces minimal badput, while producing significant reductions in bandwidth consumption under ideal conditions. Based on a brief study, we show that our algorithm is able to selectively throttle one flow while allowing another to gain in bandwidth...|$|E
