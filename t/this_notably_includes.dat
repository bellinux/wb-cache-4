Gruening was one of only two Senators to vote against the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, which authorized an expansion of U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. Bob Bartlett, also a democrat, and erstwhile secretary of the territory, was the first senator from Alaska, and remained a senator until his death in 1968. William A. Egan, also of the Alaska Democratic Party, was elected the first governor of the State of Alaska.

He then received 37.89 percent of the total statewide vote in the general election, and so lost the state to Republican John McCain, who selected former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin as his vice-presidential running mate. In 2012, President Obama lost the state to Republican Mitt Romney yet increased his percentage of the statewide vote to 40.81%.

In hydrological sciences, {{the heterogeneity of}} subsurface properties, such as hydraulic conductivities or porosities, exerts an important control on water balance. <b>This</b> <b>notably</b> <b>includes</b> groundwater recharge, which is an important variable for efficient and sustainable groundwater resources management. Current large-scale hydrological models do not adequately consider this subsurface heterogeneity. Here we show that regions with strong subsurface heterogeneity have enhanced present and future recharge rates due to a different sensitivity of recharge to climate variability compared with regions with homogeneous subsurface properties. Our study domain comprises the carbonate rock regions of Europe, Northern Africa, and the Middle East, which cover ∼ 25 % of the total land area. We compare the simulations of two large-scale hydrological models, one of them accounting for subsurface heterogeneity. Carbonate rock regions strongly exhibit “karstification,” which is known to produce particularly strong subsurface heterogeneity. Aquifers from these regions contribute {{up to half of}} the drinking water supply for some European countries. Our results suggest that water management for these regions cannot rely on most of the presently available projections of groundwater recharge because spatially variable storages and spatial concentration of recharge result in actual recharge rates that are up to four times larger for present conditions and changes up to five times larger for potential future conditions than previously estimated. These differences in recharge rates for strongly heterogeneous regions suggest a need for groundwater management strategies that are adapted to the fast transit of water from the surface to the aquifers...|$|E

"May 2012 "The trend in many scientific disciplines today, especially in biology and genetics, is towards larger scale experiments in which a tremendous amount of data is generated. As imaging of data becomes increasingly more popular in experiments related to phenotypes, the ability to perform high-throughput big data analyses and to efficiently locate specific information within these data based on increasingly complicated and varying search criteria is of great importance to researchers. This research develops several methods for high-throughput phenotype analysis. <b>This</b> <b>notably</b> <b>includes</b> a registration algorithm called variable object pattern matching for mapping multiple indistinct and dynamic objects across images and detecting the presence of missing, extra, and merging objects. Research accomplishments resulted in a number of unique advanced search mechanisms including a retrieval engine that integrates multiple phenotype text sources and domain ontologies and a search method that retrieves objects based on temporal semantics and behavior. These search mechanisms represent the first of their kind in the phenotype community.

The version of record Oliveira, B., Afonso, J., Zlotnik, S., Diez, P. Numerical modelling of multi-phase multi-component reactive transport in the Earth's interior. "Geophysical journal international", 1 Gener 2018, vol. 212, núm. 1, p. 345 - 388 is available online at: [URL] present a conceptual and numerical approach to model processes in the Earth's interior that involve multiple phases that simultaneously interact thermally, mechanically and chemically. The approach is truly multiphase {{in the sense that}} each dynamic phase is explicitly modelled with an individual set of mass, momentum, energy and chemical mass balance equations coupled via interfacial interaction terms. It is also truly multi-component {{in the sense that the}} compositions of the system and its constituent thermodynamic phases are expressed by a full set of fundamental chemical components (e. g. SiO_ 2, Al_ 2 O_ 3, MgO, etc) rather than proxies. In contrast to previous approaches these chemical components evolve, react with, and partition into, different phases with different physical properties according to an internally-consistent thermodynamic model. This enables a thermodynamically-consistent coupling of the governing set of balance equations. Interfacial processes such as surface tensions and/or surface energy contributions to the dynamics and energetics of the system are also taken into account. The model presented here describes the evolution of systems governed by Multi-Phase Multi-Component Reactive Transport (MPMCRT) based on Ensemble Averaging and Classical Irreversible Thermodynamics principles. This novel approach provides a flexible platform to study the dynamics and non-linear feedbacks occurring within various natural systems at different scales. <b>This</b> <b>notably</b> <b>includes</b> major-and trace-element transport, diffusion-controlled trace-element re-equilibration or rheological changes associated with melt generation and migration in the Earth's mantle.

40|$|The Mano River sub-region, which {{includes}} Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea, and Côte d’Ivoire, has experienced decades of violent upheavals and political instability. <b>This</b> <b>notably</b> <b>includes</b> civil wars in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Côte d’Ivoire. While these {{have generally been}} analysed {{as a series of}} discrete wars, some specialists have interpreted them as part of a regional conflict system; indeed, the World Bank has referred to a ‘Mano River Basin conflict system’. There have been many analyses of regional conflict systems {{in other parts of the}} world. Several of these regional conflict studies highlight commonalities, including: the prominence of transnational political, economic, military and social networks; private entrepreneurs of violence; transborder kinship of identity groups; and massive refugee flows. Another commonality throughout these analyses is that private, local and transnational actors play a more important role in this type of conflict than in ‘traditional’ intra- and inter-state conflict. This Evidence Report aims to identify the ways in which militant violence diffuses in the Mano River region and to establish the conditions that characterise it as a regional conflict system. Danny Hoffman (2011) coined the term ‘Mano River War’ as an umbrella term for the 15 -year period of violence in Sierra Leone and Liberia. The Mano River War concept usefully captures the interconnectivity of the peoples and countries in the Mano River Basin and details how the Liberian, Sierra Leonean and Ivoirian civil wars relate. Despite the cessation of large-scale conflict in the region, there is nevertheless still some debate as to whether the Mano River War really has concluded. So while Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Côte d’Ivoire have not experienced war in the past five years, one wonders whether this marks the end of the Mano River War. The aim of this report is to consider the extent to which we can conclude that the Mano River War has indeed ended, and to reflect on the legacies, imaginaries and trajectories of this particular space over the past 25 years. This report therefore discusses the concept of a Mano River War through a series of questions. Should the concept use the singular or plural form? To what extent is the idea of a conflict system relevant to understanding the evolution of various armed conflicts in the region? What else might it contribute to a deeper understanding of the region that could promote more sustained peace and security? And have we now come to an end of the Mano River War, especially given successive cycles of peaceful post-conflict elections including, significantly, in Côte d’Ivoire in 2015 ?UK Department for International Developmen...|$|E
40|$|Many {{models of}} the nonnative {{acquisition}} of syntax build {{on the assumption that}} target lexical projections are developmentally prior to target functional projections (e. g. Minimal Trees (Vainikka & Young-Scholten 1994), Modulated Structure Building (Hawkins 2001)), or that learners only have to grapple with the acquisition of the topmost levels of syntactic structure (e. g. Vulnerable C-domain (Platzack 2001)). Germanic verb second (V 2) is often said to be difficult for L 2 learners irrespective of their L 1. Targetlike finite verb placement in non-subject-initial root clauses (V 2) has been described as being dependent on targetlike nonfinite verb placement (VO/OV) having been acquired first. Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, English, Swedish as well as Turkish and Korean learners of German have been reported to acquire German-style OV long before V 2 (e. g. duPlessis et al. 1987; Vainikka & Young-Scholten 1996 b; Pienemann 1998; Schwartz & Sprouse 1994; Vainikka & Young-Scholten 1994, 1996 a, b). Recent work on Swedish/German (e. g. Vulnerable C-domain (Platzack 2001), Processability (e. g. Håkansson, Pienemann & Sayehli 2002)) claims that speakers of a V 2 -language learning another V 2 -language start with a non-V 2 interlanguage grammar, i. e. they do not transfer V 2, but follow a universal developmental path of verb placement. The present paper contests the above claims, presenting quantified oral production data from 6 L 1 Swedish adult ab-initio learners of German (4 & 9 months of exposure to classroom German) as well as oral and written production data from 23 L 1 Swedish 16 -year-old intermediate learners (3 years of classroom German). I document productive use of non-subject-initial V 2 declarative clauses after only 4 months of exposure to German, {{at a time when the}} informants’ interlanguage syntax elsewhere is nontargetlike – and <b>this,</b> <b>notably,</b> <b>includes</b> head-initial VPs (VO). There is also a categorical difference between informants depending on whether they have prior knowledge of L 2 English. Of the Swedish adult ab initio learners, 3 were acquiring German as their first L 2, and they produce 100 % targetlike V 2. However, the other informants who had substantial previous exposure to English, only produce 45 % targetlike non-subject-initial V 2 in their L 3 German, also allowing nontargetlike V 3, i. e. Adv-SVX (cf. Bohnacker 2005 a, 2005 b). This suggests that the non-V 2 syntax of their L 2 English influences their acquisition of L 3 German, a potential confound that was not controlled for in earlier studies such as Håkansson, Pienemann & Sayehli (2002) and Platzack (2001). The results suggest that there is no universal developmental route to L 2 /L 3 German verb placement, that the C-domain is not vulnerable per se, that the V-domain is not invulnerable per se, that learners make use of their V 2 -L 1 syntax (Swedish), and that knowledge of a non-V 2 language (English) can make it initially more difficult to acquire another V 2 language (German). The findings are interpreted as strong empirical support for transfer approaches to the nonnative acquisition of syntax (e. g. Schwartz & Sprouse 1994, 1996). Going beyond the findings reported in Bohnacker (2005 a, b), I look at nonfinite verb placement (VO/OV) in the interlanguage German of the Swedish learners in more detail. Here, the learners show awareness of German being OV early on (by 9 months), in contrast to Swedish. However, alongside targetlike OV productions, the ab initio learners continue to produce 30 % nontarget VO utterances. This also holds for a large subgroup of the 16 -year-old intermediate learners who exhibit sizeable percentages of nontarget head-initial VPs (VO) after 3 years of exposure. Yet there is no correlation between VO and V 2 violations, nor between targetlike OV and perfect V 2. Nonfinite verb placement (VP headedness), especially in oral production, is a lot less targetlike than their finite verb placement (i. e. V 2). However, VP headedness appears to interact with syntactic context in quirky construction-specific ways. For instance, when embedding a VP under a finite auxiliary, learners overwhelmingly stick to head-final VPs (cf. (1)), but when coordinating VPs, they tend to produce a head-initial VP in the second conjunct (cf. (2)). I will address some of the implications these findings may have for current models of L 2 syntax acquisition. (1) ich will ein Hund haben. I want a dog have ‘I want to have a dog. ’ (2) L 2 er: ich will nach Paris fahren und schreiben Poesie und Dichte.
