40|$|This paper {{concerns}} {{an investigation}} into the use of cubic nonlinearity in a vibration neutralizer to improve its effectiveness. It is assumed that the excitation frequency is well above the resonance frequency of the machine to which the neutralizer is attached, and that the machine acts as a simple mass. It is also assumed that the response of the system is predominantly at the harmonic excitation frequency of the machine. The harmonic balance method is used to analyze the system. It is shown that the nonlinearity has the effect of shifting the resonant peak to a higher frequency away from the tuned frequency of the neutralizer so that the device is robust <b>to</b> <b>mistune.</b> In a linear neutralizer this can only be achieved by adding mass to the neutralizer, so the nonlinearity has the same effect as adding mass. An optimum value of nonlinearity is determined. A minimum value of the damping in the neutralizer is also determined such that the response of the machine is single valued for all frequency. In this case the effect of the nonlinearity is to increase the bandwidth of the device compared to the linear neutralizer with similar mass and damping...|$|E

The influence {{of this type of}} intentional mistuning on the design of friction dampers has hardly been explored so far. To investigate the dynamics of alternately istuned and nonlinearly coupled bladed disks a simple model is set up. The structure is represented by a plane lumped mass cyclic sector model with a single DOF oscillator for each blade.

In the present study, the rolling-pendulum type is compared with the well-known translational configuration, the latter expectedly more prone <b>to</b> <b>mistuning</b> and yet insensitive to seismic intensity because of its linear behaviour. The trade-off between the two schemes is first explored for the case of a single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) structure under a variety of design scenarios and then demonstrated through simulations on a building structure recently completed in a seismic site in Central Italy and designed to host a roof-garden atop for architectural purpose...|$|R

40|$|Small mistuning {{can cause}} large, catastrophic changes in blade {{vibrational}} response whereby the amplitudes of vibration of some blades may increase by several hundred percent. This can produce 'rogue' blades and HCF failure. The free and forced responses may be highly sensitive <b>to</b> <b>mistuning,</b> and the tuned system predictions may be qualitatively in error and grossly underestimate blade forced response and overestimate fatigue life. Manufacturing tolerances, material non-uniformities, nonidentical root fixtures, and in-service degradation result in blade-to-blade differences that destroy cyclic symmetry in bladed discs. Therefore, a credible forced response prediction system for turbomachinery vibration must take mistuning into account.

40|$|AbstractStudies of {{the neural}} {{correlates}} of short-term memory {{in a wide}} variety of brain areas have found that transient inputs can cause persistent changes in rates of action potential firing, through a mechanism that remains unknown. In a premotor area that is responsible for holding the eyes still during fixation, persistent neural firing encodes the angular position of the eyes in a characteristic manner: below a threshold position the neuron is silent, and above it the firing rate is linearly related to position. Both the threshold and linear slope vary from neuron to neuron. We have reproduced this behavior in a biophysically plausible network model.

Maximum resonant amplitudes searched across the many nodes of a large-scale finite element model of a mistuned bladed disk and across all the excitation frequencies in a given range are combined into an objective function. Individual blade mistuning is controlled by varying design parameters, whose variation range is constrained by manufacture tolerances.

40|$|This work {{introduces}} novel reduced order modeling {{techniques for}} identification of small mistuning and the simultaneous modeling of {{large and small}} mistuning in large structures that are nominally cyclically symmetric. Mistuning, or deviations in cyclically symmetric structures, can cause {{dramatic changes in the}} forced response of a system. Turbomachinery blisks are an example of cyclic structures that are subject <b>to</b> <b>mistuning.</b> Mistuning can be caused by small or large deviations in manufacturing, wear, or damage. Many accurate reduced order models (ROMS) exist to predict the system response in the presence of small mistuning. These will be denoted as direct ROMs, or those ROMs that generate system response predictions given knowledge of the system. However, the growing use of blisks, makes it necessary <b>to</b> determine the <b>mistuning</b> levels using system level experimental data of the response. Enabling this is the use of a novel concept developed in this work and denoted as inverse reduced order models (IROMs), which are models carefully selected to enhance sensitivity to the parameters that need to be predicted. System modes are categorized and a process of surrogate data is used to systematically evaluate IROMs. Many ROMs which model small mistuning in blisks are only accurate for small frequency ranges and are untested in higher frequency ranges. However, it is also necessary to have a tool <b>to</b> identify <b>mistuning</b> in higher frequency ranges. This is a nontrivial step because blade mode families are no longer isolated and blade topology becomes increasingly complicated. An enhanced measurement point selection algorithm integrated with a surrogate data process enables the identification of mistuning at higher frequencies. Large mistuning modeling of blisks using ROMs is an important step to predicting the response of the system. The approach in this work makes use of modes solved using cyclic symmetry analysis to predict the pristine, rogue, and interface portions of the system. This allows for the ROM to be generated using only simple sector level calculations, thus enabling rapid generation of ROMs. This approach can be combined with small <b>mistuning</b> models <b>to</b> accurately model both small and large mistuning in blisks...|$|R

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{believed}} that learning is due, at least in part, to long-lasting modifications of the strengths of synapses in the brain. Theoretical {{studies have shown that}} a family of synaptic plasticity rules, in which synaptic changes are driven by covariance, is particularly useful for many forms of learning, including associative memory, gradient estimation, and operant conditioning. Covariance-based plasticity is inherently sensitive. Even a slight mistuning of the parameters of a covariancebased plasticity rule is likely to result in substantial changes in synaptic efficacies. Therefore, the biological relevance of covariance-based plasticity models is questionable. Here, we study the effects of mistuning parameters of the plasticity rule in a decision making model in which synaptic plasticity is driven by the covariance of reward and neural activity. An exact covariance plasticity rule yields Herrnstein’s matching law. We show that although the effect of slight mistuning of the plasticity rule on the synaptic efficacies is large, the behavioral effect is small. Thus, matching behavior is robust <b>to</b> <b>mistuning</b> of the parameters of the covariance-based plasticity rule. Furthermore, the mistuned covariance rule results in undermatching, which is consistent with experimentally observed behavior. These results substantiate the hypothesis that approximate covariance-based synaptic plasticity underlies operant conditioning. However, we show that the mistuning of the mean subtraction makes behavior sensitive <b>to</b> the <b>mistuning</b> of the properties of the decision making network. Thus, there is a tradeoff between the robustness of matching behavior to changes in the plasticity rule and its robustness t...|$|R
40|$|A {{transfer}} matrix {{approach to the}} analysis of the dynamics of mistuned bladed disks is presented. The study focuses on mono-coupled systems, in which each blade is coupled to its two neighboring blades, and bi-coupled systems, where each blade is coupled to its four nearest neighbors. Transfer matrices yield the free dynamics, both the characteristic free wave and the normal modes - in closed form for the tuned assemblies. Mistuned assemblies are represented by random transfer matrices and an examination of the effect of mistuning on harmonic wave propagation yields the localization factor - the average rate of spatial wave amplitude decay per blade - in the mono-coupled assembly. Based on a comparison of the wave propagation characteristics of the mono- and bi-coupled assemblies, important conclusions are drawn about the effect of the additional coupling coordinate on the sensitivity <b>to</b> <b>mistuning</b> and the strength of mode localization predicted by a mono-coupled analysis...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} of the mode localization phenomenon associated with mistuning is presented for shrouded blade assemblies. The calculations {{are based on a}} generic finite element model, which permits modeling of arbitrary mistuning and both slipping and nonslipping shroud interfaces. The results presented indicate that interactions occur between mistuning and slip effects, with maximum mode localization occurring when the shrouds slip freely. Certain modes are found to be very sensitive to shroud slip, and in some cases completely change character when slip occurs. Mode localization is most pronounced in the predominantly bending modes, and varies considerably from mode to mode. As the ratio of interblade coupling strength <b>to</b> <b>mistuning</b> strength is increased, the effect of <b>mistuning</b> is observed <b>to</b> decrease significantly. This result has important implications for the flutter problem, since it suggests that the stabilization effect available from mistuning is significantly less for a shrouded rotor as compared to an unshrouded rotor...|$|R
40|$|In this work, an {{experimental}} modal analysis is performed on an academic bladed disk using a base excitation <b>to</b> identify the <b>mistuning</b> of each blade.

Since the bladed disk is a one-piece structure, there are no welded connections between the blades and the disk and the material properties can be assumed to be uniform.

40|$|Two {{state of}} the art finite element {{reduction}} techniquespreviously validated against the direct finite element method,one based on classical modal analysis and another based oncomponent mode synthesis, are applied for efficient mistunedfree vibration and forced response analysis of several bladeddisk geometries. The methods are first applied to two testcases in order to demonstrate the differences in computationalefficiency as well as to validate the methods againstexperimental data. As previous studies have indicated, nonoticeable differences in accuracy are detected for the currentapplications, while the method based on classical modalanalysis is significantly more efficient. Experimental data(mistuned frequencies and mode shapes) available for one of thetwo test cases are compared with numerical predictions, and agood match is obtained, which adds to the previous validationof the methods (against the direct finite element method). The influence of blade-to-blade coupling and rotation speedon the sensitivity of bladed disks <b>to</b> <b>mistuning</b> is thenstudied. A transonic fan is considered with part span shroudsand without shrouds, respectively, constituting a high and alow blade-to-blade coupling case. For both cases, computationsare performed at rest as well as at various rotation speeds. Mistuning sensitivity is modelled as the dependence ofamplitude magnification on the standard deviation of bladestiffnesses. The finite element reduction technique based onclassical modal analysis is employed for the structuralanalysis. This reduced order model is solved for sets of randomblade stiffnesses with various standard deviations, i. e. MonteCarlo simulations. In order to reduce the sample size, thestatistical data is fitted to a Weibull (type III) parametermodel. Three different parameter estimation techniques areapplied and compared. The key role of blade-to-blade coupling,as well as the ratio of <b>mistuning</b> <b>to</b> coupling, is demonstratedfor the two cases. It is observed that mistuning sensitivityvaries significantly with rotation speed for both fans due toan associated variation in blade-to-blade coupling strength. Focusing on the effect of one specific engine order on themistuned response of the first bending modes, it is observedthat the mistuning sensitivity behaviour of the fan withoutshrouds is unaffected by rotation at its resonant condition,due to insignificant changes in coupling strength at thisspeed. The fan with shrouds, on the other hand, shows asignificantly different behaviour at rest and resonant speed,due to increased coupling under rotation. Comparing the twocases at resonant rotor speeds, the fan without shrouds is lessor equally sensitive <b>to</b> <b>mistuning</b> than the fan with shrouds inthe entire range of mistuning strengths considered. This thesis 9 ̆ 2 scientific contribution centres on themistuning sensitivity study, where the effects of shrouds androtation speed are quantified for realistic bladed diskgeometries.

40|$|National audienceThe mistuning of blades is {{frequently}} {{the cause of}} spatial localizations for the dynamic forced response in turbomachinery industry. The random character of mistuning requires the construction of probabilistic models of random uncertainties. A usual parametric probabilistic description considers the mistuning through the Young modulus of each blade. This model consists in mistuning blade eigenfrequencies, assuming the blade modal shapes unchanged. Recently a new approach known as a non-parametric model of random uncertainties has been introduced for modelling random uncertainties in elastodynamics. This paper proposes {{the construction of a}} non-parametric model which is coherent with all the uncertainties which characterize mistuning. As mistuning is a phenomenon which is independent from one blade to another one, the structure is considered as an assemblage of substructures. The mean reduced matrix model required by the non-parametric approach is thus constructed by dynamic substructuring. A comparative approach is also needed to study the influence of the non-parametric approach for a usual parametric model adapted <b>to</b> <b>mistuning.</b> A numerical exemple is presented...|$|R

The results considerably augment the data previously obtained from discrimination experiments and from experiments in which listeners counted apparent sources. Although previous work has emphasized the role of spectral resolution in the segregation process, the present work suggests that neural synchrony is an important consideration; our data show that listeners lose the ability <b>to</b> segregate <b>mistuned</b> harmonics at high frequencies where synchronous neural firing vanishes.

40|$|The A 1 -MGBv corticothalamic {{projection}} {{is one of}} {{the major}} descending pathways in the auditory system, projecting from the primary auditory cortex (A 1) to the ventral division of medial geniculate body (MGBv). Recent evidence suggests that corticothalamic feedback can sharpen the spectral receptive fields of thalamic neurons and modulate the temporal precision of the responses. The aim of the work presented here was to investigate the role of A 1 -MGBv corticothalamic feedback using harmonic and mistuned complex tones (HCTs and MCTs) in adult ferrets. The MCTs used comprised a <b>mistuned</b> harmonic shifted <b>to</b> a higher frequency in the otherwise HCTs. The harmonic structure of sounds is an important grouping cue in auditory scene analysis. We first measured the ability of ferrets <b>to</b> detect <b>mistuned</b> harmonics using a go/no-go behavioural task paradigm. Psychometric functions plotting sensitivity as a function of degree of <b>mistuning</b> were used <b>to</b> evaluate the behavioural performance using signal detection theory. The threshold for mistuning detection was 0. 8 ± 0. 1 Hz (mean ± sem), with sensitivity indices and reaction times depending on the degree of mistuning. The threshold range for mistuning in ferrets is similar to that previously described in other species. The responses to MCTs in MGBv neurons were explored using extracellular recordings in anaesthetised animals. The functional organization of the ferret auditory thalamus has not previously been investigated. The ferret MGBv was identified by the short response latency and the sharply tuned frequency response areas of the recorded units and by its tonotopic organization, which was found to be comparable to that of other species. Compared to their responses to HCTs, the firing rates of MGBv neurons were modulated depending on the degree of mistuning and the fundamental frequency of the MCTs. Distinctive temporal response patterns were also observed, phase locked to the periodicities of altered phases of the MCTs. To investigate whether corticofugal modulation contributes <b>to</b> <b>mistuning</b> detection, A 1 -MGBv corticothalamic neurons were selectively eliminated bilaterally by chromophore-targeted laser photolysis. Using the behavioural paradigm established above, mistuning detection was tested before and after these lesions were made. Animals with corticothalamic lesions were impaired in their ability <b>to</b> detect a <b>mistuned</b> harmonic, as indicated by decreased dâ values, increased thresholds, and a shift of the psychometric curves towards higher mistuning values. Together, these results suggest a possible role for corticothalamic feedback in modulating the firing patterns of MGBv neurons in ways that contribute to accurate recognition of complex auditory stimuli. In other words, this top-down corticothalamic feedback may be important for auditory scene analysis. </p...|$|R

A laser vibrometer is used <b>to</b> characterize <b>mistuning</b> for a population of turbine wheels through {{the analysis of the}} blade-response to piezo-speaker induced noise. The turbine-wheel design under investigation is radial and is typically used in 6 - 12 L diesel engine applications. FRFs and resonance frequencies are reviewed and summarized. The study includes test results for a paddle wheel that represents a perfectly tuned system and acts as a reference. A discrete mass-spring model is developed for the paddle wheel and the model suitability is tested against measured data. Density randomization is applied <b>to</b> model <b>mistuning</b> in the turbine wheels. Frequency mistuning and relative amplitude modelling for blade modes is found in good agreement with the data, however the mass-spring model over-predicts amplitude-amplification factors for a population of radial-turbine wheels, especially with regard to hub-dominant modes. A continuous twisted-blade model is developed in Matlab using finite-element techniques. Experimental data is shown to have good agreement with the twisted-blade model. Whitehead’s maximum amplitude-amplification prediction using RMS value for a tuned amplitude value is calculated, and the turbine-wheel response is found to fit within the theoretical limit. Different mistuning patterns are studied using the twisted-blade model. Maximum and minimum response patterns are identified and recommended...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} the {{characterization}} of the blade manufacturing geometric tolerances {{in order to get}} a given level of amplification in the forced response of a mistuned bladed-disk. The theory is based on the use of a norparametric probabilistic model of blade random uncertainties. The dispersion parameters controlling the nonparametric model are estimated as a function of the geometric tolerances. The industrial application is devoted <b>to</b> the <b>mistuning</b> analysis of a 22 blades wide chord fan stage. Centrifugal stiffening due to rotational effects is also included. The results obtained validate the efficiency and the reliability of the method on three-dimensional bladed disks...|$|R
