30|$|We can note {{first for}} the series (a) the absence of <b>the</b> <b>fringes</b> for SLB since the {{constraint}} is weak {{at the beginning of}} <b>the</b> test. <b>The</b> <b>fringes</b> in ILB are related to a rigid body displacement.It is a first pitfall to avoid, <b>the</b> presence of <b>fringes</b> on <b>the</b> supports is useful to detect this problem. For series (b), more fringes were observed for both specimens. This means that the increment of deformation is higher for series (b) than for the series (a). For both series, the presence of noise between <b>the</b> <b>fringes</b> is observed for ILB, the experimental conditions are less good than for the SLB beam. A filtering of <b>the</b> <b>fringes</b> is therefore necessary.|$|R
40|$|In the {{dominant}} firm model, {{we show that}} an increase of <b>the</b> <b>fringe's</b> reserves of a nonrenewable resource {{may lead to a}} decrease in aggregate discounted social welfare. This happens when the difference between <b>the</b> <b>fringe's</b> extraction cost and {{the dominant}} firm's is positive and large enough. We also show that welfare might decrease if <b>the</b> <b>fringe's</b> marginal extraction cost decreases. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Analytical {{models for}} <b>the</b> <b>fringing</b> {{capacitance}} of MEMS devices have been developed. Dimensional analysis techniques {{were used to}} determine the equation format and the results of numerical simulations enabled the extraction of the equation constants. <b>The</b> electrostatic <b>fringing</b> fields acting on rectangular micromachined capactitor structures were analysed using the finite element tool ANSYS and a behavioural model for <b>the</b> <b>fringing</b> capacitance was subsequently developed. The model is validated using simulated an measured data reported by other authors. Based on the same technique, a model for <b>the</b> <b>fringing</b> capacitance between a micromachined levitated disc and pie-shaped electrodes was also developed...|$|R
5|$|During Tkach's tenure, {{the changes}} that he {{implemented}} stirred much controversy and significant dissent among those who continued to follow Armstrong's theology. The dissenters labeled the changes as heresy and many left to form new church organizations. Within the mainstream Christian community, some have hailed Tkach's reforms, which brought a church from <b>the</b> <b>fringe</b> to orthodoxy, as unprecedented.|$|E
5|$|Fauxlivia, Olivia Dunham's doppelgänger {{from the}} {{parallel}} universe, continues to pose as Olivia {{as part of}} <b>the</b> <b>Fringe</b> division. <b>The</b> <b>Fringe</b> team is brought in on a case where several people, part of an online group attempting to decode the information sent by a numbers station, have been stricken with amnesia. They discover the station broadcasting the signal, finding its workers killed and a strange box connected to the broadcast equipment. They identify fingerprints on the box of a Joseph Feller, but his current location is unknown.

40|$|A simple fringe {{reduction}} {{method for}} FM diode laser spectroscopy is discussed. <b>The</b> <b>fringes</b> can be effectively suppressed {{by using a}} modulation frequency that is an integral multiple of the free spectral range of <b>the</b> <b>fringes.</b> <b>The</b> technique is experimentally confirmed by two-tone FM spectroscopy of water vapor absorption lines.

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>fringes</b> act {{very much}} like the lines on a {{topography}} map, where <b>the</b> <b>fringes</b> are always perpendicular to the wedge between the surfaces. When wringing first begins, there is a large angle in the air wedge and <b>the</b> <b>fringes</b> will resemble grid topography-lines. If <b>the</b> <b>fringes</b> are straight; then the surface is flat. If the surfaces are allowed to fully wring and become parallel, <b>the</b> straight <b>fringes</b> will widen until only a dark fringe remains, and they will disappear completely. If the surface is not flat, the grid lines will have some bends in them, indicating the topography of <b>the</b> surface. Straight <b>fringes</b> with bends in them may indicate a raised elevation or a depression. Straight fringes with a [...] "V" [...] shape in the middle indicate a ridge or valley running across the center, while straight fringes with curves near the ends indicate edges that are either rounded-off or have a raised lip.|$|R

5|$|The first rural {{cemetery}} in the United States—Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts—was {{developed in the}} 1830s.

The development of rural cemeteries followed closely with the English garden movement of the early 19thcentury.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are three}} ways {{to test the}} surface for shape, but the most common is the [...] "finger-{{pressure}} test." [...] In this test, slight pressure {{is applied to the}} flat, to see which way <b>the</b> <b>fringes</b> move. <b>The</b> <b>fringes</b> will move away from the narrow end of the wedge. If the testing surface is concave, when pressure is applied {{to the center of the}} rings, the flat will flex a little and <b>the</b> <b>fringes</b> will appear to move inward. However, if the surface is convex, the flat will be in point-contact with the surface in that spot, so it will have no room to flex. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>fringes</b> will remain stationary, merely growing a little wider. If pressure is applied to the edge of the flat something similar happens. If the surface is convex the flat will rock a little, causing <b>the</b> <b>fringes</b> to move toward the finger. However, if the surface is concave the flat will flex a little, and <b>the</b> <b>fringes</b> will move away from the finger toward the center. Although this is called a [...] "finger" [...] pressure test, a wooden stick or some other instrument is often used to avoid heating the glass (with the mere weight of a toothpick often being enough pressure).|$|R

Walter, after being told the victims' personal electronics were drained of power, suspects someone drew energy from both the people and their devices' batteries. They trace the man responsible to MIT astrophysics professor Alistair Peck (Peter Weller), and enter his residence to search for clues, finding evidence that Alistair was studying time travel.

About 1,000 lifeguard rescues took place in California due to the waves. Moisture from the storm also enhanced rainfall in parts of Arizona, leading to minor accumulations.|$|E
