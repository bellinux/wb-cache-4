5|$|James and Henrietta Townsend's son, Henry Hare Townsend, {{showed little}} {{interest}} in the area or in the <b>traditional</b> <b>role</b> of the Lord of the Manor. After leasing the house to a succession of tenants, the house and grounds were sold in 1792 to Thomas Smith of Gray's Inn as a country residence.|$|E
5|$|As for the {{development}} of the parochial system, David's <b>traditional</b> <b>role</b> as its creator can not be sustained. Scotland already had an ancient system of parish churches dating to the Early Middle Ages, and the kind of system introduced by David's Normanising tendencies can more accurately be seen as mild refashioning, rather than creation; he made the Scottish system as a whole more like that of France and England, but he did not create it.|$|E
5|$|Coughlan {{has been}} criticized for {{allowing}} the doctrine of proportionality to affect administrative law, as the court has to judge the merits of a case when granting a review on grounds of substantive legitimate expectation and, in a sense, usurp the discretion of the executive branch of government. This is arguably inconsistent with the court's <b>traditional</b> <b>role</b> in judicial review which is to avoid examining the merits of administrative decisions and only scrutinize them for compliance with the law.|$|E

5|$|Instead, {{under the}} novel {{conditions}} of attrition warfare, war pigeons in their <b>traditional</b> <b>role</b> as pigeon post saw a renaissance. Neubronner's mobile dovecote {{found its way}} to the Battle of Verdun, where it proved so advantageous that similar facilities were used on a larger scale in the Battle of the Somme. After the war, the War Ministry responded to Neubronner's inquiry to the effect that the use of pigeons in aerial photography had no military value and further experiments were not justified.|$|E
5|$|Sculptural {{fragments}} to Rodin were autonomous works, and {{he considered}} them {{the essence of}} his artistic statement. His fragments– perhaps lacking arms, legs, or a head– took sculpture further from its <b>traditional</b> <b>role</b> of portraying likenesses, and into a realm where forms existed for their own sake. Notable examples are The Walking Man, Meditation without Arms, and Iris, Messenger of the Gods.|$|E
5|$|In addition, Aragorn created Faramir Prince of Ithilien and {{appointed}} Beregond Captain of Faramir's guard, the White Company. Faramir, as Prince of Ithilien, {{together with the}} Prince of Dol Amroth became King Elessar's chief commanders. In a draft letter to a reader of The Lord of the Rings, J. R. R. Tolkien writes that as Prince of Ithilien, Faramir's duties also included acting as resident march-warden of Gondor's main eastward outpost, rehabilitating the lost territories, as well as clearing it of outlaws and Orcs and cleansing Minas Morgul (an old Gondorian city, once named Minas Ithil, that Sauron had taken) of evil remnants. Faramir also fulfilled the <b>traditional</b> <b>role</b> of Steward, acting as the King’s chief counsellor and ruling Gondor in his absence.|$|E

5|$|Not all of {{the monks}} were {{attracted}} by Symeon's zealous approach. Symeon attempted to reform the Byzantine monasteries, where monks had become subservient to the emperor and had acquired large holdings of property, libraries, and art. His writings and teachings were aimed at returning the monasteries to their <b>traditional</b> <b>role</b> in the early church, urging the monks {{to take up a}} life of simplicity, asceticism, purity of heart, and constant prayer. The strict monastic discipline for which Symeon aimed upset several monks in the monastery. Symeon also took a more emotional approach to worship, suggesting that a monk shouldn't take the sacrament without tears. The introduction of vegetarian meals, along with other unique practices to instill discipline and humility, also caused some displeasure among the monks.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{day after}} the fall of the town, Faya-Largeau was {{subjected}} to a sustained air bombardment, using Su-22 and Mirage F-1s from the Aouzou air base, along with Tu-22 bombers from Sabha. Within ten days, a large ground force had been assembled east and west of Faya-Largeau by first ferrying men, armor, and artillery by air to Sabha, Kufra and the Aouzou airfield, and then by shorter-range transport planes to the area of conflict. The fresh Libyan forces amounted to 11,000 mostly regular troops, and eighty combat aircraft participated in the offensive; however, the Libyans maintained their <b>traditional</b> <b>role</b> of providing fire support, and occasional tank charges, for the assaults of the GUNT, which could count on 3,000–4,000 men on this occasion.|$|E
5|$|The lantern as {{a source}} of {{illumination}} in art was widely used by Baroque artists, and perfected by Caravaggio. Traditionally a dramatic light source and the resultant chiaroscuro were used as metaphors for the presence of God. Illumination by torch or candlelight took on religious connotations; but in The Third of May the lantern manifests no such miracle. Rather, it affords light only so that the firing squad may complete its grim work, and provides a stark illumination so that the viewer may bear witness to wanton violence. The <b>traditional</b> <b>role</b> of light in art as a conduit for the spiritual has been subverted.|$|E

5|$|The <b>traditional</b> <b>role</b> of cavalry in war is scouting—gathering {{information}} about the enemy's location, strength, and movements—while denying the enemy the same {{information about}} one's own forces. Other tasks include raiding into enemy territory and damaging their infrastructure and economy while avoiding conflict with enemy forces. On the field of battle, cavalry were expected to charge into and break up enemy infantry and cavalry formations. The prestige gained by participating in a cavalry charge was such that additional officers would attempt to join one whenever possible. Notable examples of this include Louis Nolan of the 15th Hussars joining the Charge of the Light Brigade in the Crimean War and Winston Churchill of the 4th Hussars joining the 21st Lancers for their charge during the Battle of Omdurman.|$|E
5|$|This {{emphasis}} on improvisation was essential due <b>traditional</b> <b>role</b> {{of the music}} as entertainment for the entire community. Listeners in the audience expected players to surprise and astound them by playing in their own unique style, and by incorporating improvisation to make newer versions of the piece. If a player simply imitated a preceding player, playing patterns without any improvisation, the audience members would believe she/he to be repetitious and mundane. This also explains why set performance pieces for musical productions are different in some respect—young men/women would be practicing before an event, therefore rarely relying on improvisations.|$|E
5|$|While Wellesley was {{preoccupied with}} re-taking the gun line, Pohlmann rallied his {{infantry}} and redeployed {{them into a}} semicircle with {{their backs to the}} Juah; their right flank across the river and their left in Assaye. However, most of the Maratha cannon, which had inflicted heavy losses on Wellesley's infantry, had been captured or lay abandoned on the battlefield. Reluctant to join the fray, the Maratha cavalry lingered in the distance to the west. Most were Pindarries: loosely organised and lightly armed horsemen whose <b>traditional</b> <b>role</b> was to cut down fleeing enemy troops, harass convoy lines and carry out raids into enemy territory. They were not trained to attack well-formed infantry or heavily armed European cavalry, and did not play a further part in the battle.|$|E

5|$|Having {{finished}} his school career, Crawford joined the first MCC tour of South Africa in the 1905–06 season. The team {{was not particularly}} strong—before the tour, critics judged it to possess the equivalent strength of a moderate county side. The MCC was criticised by the press in both England and South Africa for omitting many of the strongest players. As {{the youngest member of}} the team, Crawford was given the <b>traditional</b> <b>role</b> of writing press reports to be sent back home during the tour. When the team played in Worcester during the tour, the local press carried a report that Crawford planned to remain in South Africa. The 1906 Wisden carried the same story; in a comment on his success in 1905, it suggested that it was uncertain for how long he would play, and questioned whether, if he played Test cricket, he would do so for England or South Africa. The cricket historian Nigel Hart queries why Wisden mentioned South Africa; Crawford's only known connection came through his uncle, who had left South Africa five years before.|$|E
5|$|Sotomayor's {{circuit court}} rulings {{led to her}} being {{considered}} a political centrist by the ABA Journal and other sources and organizations. Several lawyers, legal experts, and news organizations identified her as someone with liberal inclinations. In any case, the Second Circuit's caseload typically skewed more toward business and securities law rather than hot-button social or constitutional issues. Sotomayor tended to write narrow, practiced rulings that relied on close application of the law to the facts of a case rather than import general philosophical viewpoints. A Congressional Research Service analysis found that Sotomayor's rulings defied easy ideological categorization, but did show an adherence to precedent and an avoidance of overstepping the circuit court's judicial role. Unusually, Sotomayor read through all the supporting documents of cases under review; her lengthy rulings explored every aspect of a case and tended to feature leaden, ungainly prose. Some legal experts have said that Sotomayor's attention to detail and re-examination of the facts of a case came close to overstepping the <b>traditional</b> <b>role</b> of appellate judges.|$|E

40|$|For {{students}} {{preparing to}} be actuaries, {{the most commonly}} known opportunities are <b>traditional</b> <b>roles</b> in insurance and consulting. Professional development {{at the university level}} must reflect the demands placed on the careers for which students are preparing for. To be prepared to fill an entry-level actuarial role upon graduation, emphasis is deservingly placed on these <b>traditional</b> <b>roles</b> as well as the exams and intensive analytical background needed to obtain them. However, there is an ever-increasing demand now placed on actuaries to fulfill <b>roles</b> beyond the <b>traditional</b> ones. Soft skills such as leadership and communication are just as important. With a greater scope of demands being placed on actuaries, there exist opportunities beyond the <b>traditional</b> <b>roles</b> which are so strongly articulated at the university level. This thesis discusses academic preparation, some descriptions of what some <b>traditional</b> versus nontraditional <b>roles</b> are, how <b>traditional</b> actuaries become non-traditional ones, and discussion of how students can prepare {{to get the most out}} of their career.

Each of these groups has its own <b>traditional</b> <b>roles</b> for women, as do the religions practiced in the country (Christian 20–30 percent, Muslim 15–20 percent, indigenous 35–50 percent).|$|R
