25|$|The polite {{thing would}} be to say 'No comment'. But the truth is that... let's put it this way, you've never seen two actors more {{completely}} subservient and prostrate themselves {{at the feet of}} a director. Stanley was absolutely thrilled with the film. He was still working on the film when he died. And he probably died because he finally relaxed. It was one of the happiest weekends of his life, right before he died, after he had shown the first cut to Terry, Tom and Nicole. He would have kept working on it, like he did on all of his films. But I know that from people around him personally, my partner who was his assistant for thirty years. And I thought about R. Lee Ermey for In the Bedroom. And I talked to Stanley a lot about that film, and all I can say is Stanley was adamant that I shouldn't work with him for all kinds of reasons that I won't get into because there is no reason <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> anyone, even if they are saying slanderous things that I know are completely untrue.|$|E

At the age of 12, Streep was selected to sing at a school recital, leading to her having opera lessons from Estelle Liebling. However, despite her talent, she remarked that [...] "I was singing something I didn't feel and understand. That was an important lesson—not <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> <b>To</b> find the thing that I could feel through". She quit after four years.

500|$|The {{song was}} {{recorded}} by the Kinks at least twice {{in the summer of}} 1964. The band's demo was in a [...] "bluesy" [...] style, while a full studio version recorded in June was slower and less emphatic than the final single. Although the band wanted to rerecord the song, their record company Pye refused to fund another session {{on the grounds that the}} band's first two singles had failed to chart. Ray Davies, however, hated the original recording of the track, threatening that he would refuse to perform or promote the single unless it was rerecorded. Manager Larry Page also refused to publish the original recording. When Pye stood its ground, the band's own management broke the stalemate by funding the session themselves. Ray Davies' adamant attitude on behalf of the career-making song effectively established him as the leader and chief songwriter of the Kinks. Davies later said, [...] "I was floundering around trying to find an identity.

According to a police affidavit, [...] "Johnson said the only reason for such killing would be because Obama is black." [...] During an August 25 interview with KCNC-TV, a CBS owned-and-operated television station in Denver, Johnson first denied being personally involved with the plot and, when asked whether he felt the men had serious plans {{to go through with}} the assassination, he said, [...] "Looking back at it, I don't want to say yes, but I don't want to say no."

[...] Johnson said the plan was for Adolf to, [...] "shoot Obama from a high vantage point using a [...] sighted at 750 yards". Johnson said the shooting was to take place during Obama's acceptance speech on August 28 at the Democratic National Convention in INVESCO Field at Mile High.

500|$|Joan O'Connell Hedman of Slant Magazine {{also gave}} a {{positive}} review feeling the episode to explore [...] "Torchwoods {{bread and butter}} topic: {{the intersection of the}} human and the alien, {{and what it means to}} be human in the aftermath." [...] She stated that the episode [...] "played to its strengths, namely Eve Myles' Gwen and how she relates to both human and alien" [...] and stated it to demonstrate [...] "how perfect Rhys is for Gwen". She felt that the episode was flawed in its [...] "cop-out" [...] ending and Jack's handling of Gwen but in her conclusion noted it be [...] "the first episode of Torchwood that left me choked up, crying with Gwen at the end". Airlock Alpha's Alan Stanley Blair felt the episode to be a vast improvement on its predecessors stating it be [...] "hard hitting, edgy and explores much bleaker and darker avenues to life in Torchwood". He also felt that the personal effect of Gwen's struggles on her domestic life was one of the most interesting aspects comparing it to the television series Angel which [...] "touched on some of these threads through the meta-story and vampire mythology" [...] but not [...] "on the scale of this [...] ". He concluded that the episode's conclusion was both to its credit and its biggest disappointment because it showed that there is [...] "no way to make everything all right" [...] but left its audience [...] "screaming for a happy ending that will never come". Jason Hughes of AOL TV was more mixed in his review. He felt that the episode was a [...] "vast improvement over last week's episode" [...] and stated that it lived up to Torchwoods reputation as [...] "the darker, more mature cousin of Doctor Who". However, he stated that the episode had [...] "some logistical problems" [...] and [...] "at least one ridiculously convenient coincidence that the emotional hook of the episode hinged on". He praised the [...] "tragic emotional impact of the moment when Jonah's mom told Gwen to promise her not <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> any other families" [...] and stated that he liked [...] "that there weren't any easy answers". io9's Charlie Jane Anders described [...] "Adrift" [...] as [...] "easily the best episode of the Doctor Who spin-off since the one where Martha Jones showed up".
