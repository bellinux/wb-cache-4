Family Credit and Housing Benefit are cash, and for child nutrition programmes {{we use the}} market value of the transfer. Since the demographic variables are alternative-invariant, what remains is a function of <b>transfer</b> <b>entitlement</b> only. These functions are comparable across programmes, and our estimates imply that Family Credit entitlement has less of a labour supply effect than child nutrition entitlement has, and Housing Benefit {{does not appear to have}} a different effect on labour supply than variation in other income. There is no reform to Housing Benefit, and identification relies on variation in real housing costs over time and across regions because the Housing Benefit formula was typically just up-rated with inflation. On the face of it, our results imply that Housing Benefit, although suffering from fixed stigma, seems to be close to cash, conditional on Housing Benefit participation.|$|E
30|$|The {{income levels}} {{associated}} with each state constitute the constraint which contributes to {{the determination of the}} choice of labour market state. Since we only observe the one alternative that is chosen, we need to predict incomes for each state from the income in the observed state. It would be computationally demanding to estimate the incomes {{associated with each}} labour market alternative jointly with the choice among alternatives. Since we only require consistent predictions of wages in order to estimate the determinants of each state, we adopt a two-step procedure. In the first step we estimate full-time and part-time wage equations which use a reduced form for labour market status to control for the endogeneity of hours and use these estimates to predict incomes in the part-time and full-time states. 10 Income for non-participants is computed from the welfare system and observed unearned (non-transfer) income. For participants, we compute the levels of tax liability and <b>transfer</b> <b>entitlement</b> using these predicted earnings at the specific discrete levels of hours of work.|$|E

Expanding <b>transfer</b> <b>entitlements</b> to full-time work has stronger participation effects. However, increasing the availability of in-work transfers to those lower down the hours distribution does cause moderate reductions in the probability of working full-time. This reflects the non-convexities in the budget constraints faced by single mothers.|$|R

40|$|In {{line with}} global trends Cash Transfers (CTs) are {{increasingly}} replacing in-kind assistance (such as food and seeds) across {{all sectors of}} humanitarian and development assistance in Zimbabwe. This study focused on assessing the impact of unconditional cash transfers in {{addressing the needs of}} vulnerable urban household headed by elderly women in Mucheke ward 2 of Masvingo. The study also sought to identify the needs and the coping strategies employed by the vulnerable urban household headed by elderly women. The study is a non-intervention descriptive study carried out on a small scale. It emerged from the study that remittances are dwindling for these households {{and at the same time}} dependency ratios are on the increase. Those receiving cash transfers are being innovative as they invest some of the cash into small income generating initiatives. It further emerged that the needs of the vulnerable urban elderly and non-elderly women are insufficiently met by the small amount of cash transfer which is more often than not unpredictable and inconsistently provided. Backdating of the cash <b>transfer</b> <b>entitlements</b> affects the labour constrained. It was also observed that utility bills for the 55 % of vulnerable urban household headed by elderly women gobble more of resources that the beneficiaries generate. The introduction of cash transfers improved social cohesion and household relationships and allowed women to make decisions on the use of the money. The study concluded and recommended that: Government, NGOs and donors need to work together to identify appropriate solutions to ensure that transfer values remain consistent in all locations, for example by building in reasonable allowances for exchange rate fluctuations into budgets. This also applies to those organisations whose budgets are not formulated in US Dollars. Computations for cash <b>transfer</b> <b>entitlements</b> should consider the beneficiary needs in line with the survival and or the livelihood promotion thresholds since the current cash transfers are too small to meaningfully leverage incomes for the vulnerable urban households headed by elderly and non elderly women. The cash transfer contributes 15 % to the household income for the vulnerable urban elderly women and 21 % to vulnerable urban household headed by the non-elderly women. There are some positive as well as negative impacts that have been realised as a result of cash transfers but more needs to be done in terms of reviewing the cash <b>transfer</b> <b>entitlements</b> as well as the CT policy framework which is good on paper (rhetoric) to be practically applied and supported. Comparatively, for two vulnerable groups, the assessment has shown that the cash transfers are modestly contributing to these householdsâ€™ income but would be better if the amount is increased to a standard that can lift the beneficiaries from the survival threshold to at least the livelihood protection threshold...|$|R

For these rights to have meaning, many parties must communicate. For example, potential buyers, potential trespassers, and authorities must understand {{the nature and extent}} of an owner 2 ̆ 7 s property. This communication involves costs, like the costs of fencing or of surveying the boundaries of a parcel of land before constructing a building. These costs must be balanced against the benefits of successful communication, which include the gains from <b>transferring</b> <b>entitlements</b> and the cost reductions of avoiding infringements of {{property rights}}. Prevention of infringement through successful communication may be cheaper than securing redress for infringed entitlements. For example, if the boundaries of a parcel of real property are not accurately communicated, an adjoining owner may construct a building that spans the property line. Even if the encroachment is small, the misplaced building may have to be demolished. Communication costs are a type of transaction cost, and should be addressed in an efficient manner-that is, additional communication costs should be incurred until the marginal costs exceed the marginal benefits...|$|R

30|$|As can be {{seen from}} Fig.  1, a considerable number of {{individuals}} exhibits schooling spells of less than six months.

Most spells last around two years with a further peak at three years. However, there are many spells that lie in between, indicating either measurement error, errors that may have occurred when <b>transferring</b> pension <b>entitlements</b> to the Western German pension system or uncompleted spells. Breaking down the descriptives by decades (1970 s, 1980 s, 1990 s) shows, however, that the distributions appear to be similar across decades with only some minor differences.

The results show that, while the CHST alters recent trends in net redistribution, the effects are modest when compared to the impacts of earlier measures such as the freeze in per capita EPF entitlements and the "cap on CAP", imposed in 1990. The federal government's recent decision to raise the CHST cash floor further reduces the CHST's effect on redistribution relative to the status quo as does the decision to adjust the allocation of the CHST slowly (rather than immediately) in the direction of equal per capita shares. Finally, the distinction between cash <b>transfers</b> and <b>entitlements</b> is important when measuring net redistribution from federal transfers to provinces. ...|$|R
40|$|This Article {{examines}} the probable fate that awaits the systematic implementation of ObamaCare. Any effort to pile a massive new <b>transfer</b> and <b>entitlement</b> program {{on top of}} a hundred years of previous reforms is likely to fall prey to the law of diminishing marginal utility of additional forms of government intervention. That consequence is all the more likely for legislation that has strong redistributivist objectives but which lacks any techniques for dealing with the massive costs increases embedded in the program. A recent history of the Massachusetts health care initiative provides some indication of the inability to constrain costs except through the imposition of price controls that could easily drive private carriers into bankruptcy. The well-known Dartmouth Atlas, moreover, provides no evidence that there are massive inefficiencies that these price controls can bleed out of the system. The complex system of private health care exchanges or the certain expansion of Medicaid and the unlikely contraction of Medicare are likely to add only greater pressures to an already unworkable system...|$|R
40|$|During the {{transition}} process, many existing social sector institutions and policies were significantly eroded and their underlying character changed. As a result, {{they often do}} not redistribute to the poorest, nor generally serve the role of facilitating economic change.

The analysis of eleven transition countries—comprising some of the most advanced {{as well as some of}} the poorest transition economies—shows that almost all countries have started to undertake reforms; however, their individual efforts vary. Reform does not only stand for cutting back, but also requires in some cases a building up and in others a redesign of social safety nets; it needs to address insurance issues, budgetary transfer programs, the performance of the health and education sector, as well as the labor market regime and the approach to tax administration.

40|$|Sen’s {{entitlement}} thesis {{rooted in}} social contract {{theory has been}} used to explain access to food, and is used by states to design social protection programs as <b>transfer</b> <b>entitlements</b> to diffuse food insecurities. Social protection programs have now burgeoned in several countries as a strategy to enable the poor to overcome risks, vulnerabilities and poverty. These social protection programs have inclusion and exclusion errors, which current theorization attributes mainly to political clientalism, social vulnerability, elite capture, targeting inefficiency, leakages and corruption, lack of information transparency and improper designing of social protection programs. This paper argues that the errors are due to a more fundamental assumption made in application of social contract and entitlement-based approach to social protection programing. It identifies an uncritical application of Sen’s entitlement thesis to social protection programs, as leading to inclusion and exclusion errors. The main problematic, the paper shows is that the social contract-led entitlement thesis works within the domain of formal rights situated within the state-citizen relations, and as such, misses out on the non-formal entitlements and non-state influences that impact materialization of social protection programs in practice. Evidences from flood prone Bahraich, Uttar Pradesh, India indicate that non-state rules linked with clientele and patronage relations, moral and local political economies trump over formal rights to mediate social protection entitlement outcomes. Rather than abstract state-citizen social contract, it is the moral contracts of reciprocal exchanges with influential patrons embedded in the moral economy of the villages that ultimately ground the social protection entitlement claims of poor villagers. Conceptualizing this process of access as cultures of entitlement, the paper builds a framework for reinterpretation of entitlements and their outcomes, suggesting a recalibration of application of Sen’s entitlement thesis to social protection programs. In conclusion it argues that Sen’s entitlement thesis which is pitched at transfer of economic resources through social protection from the state to the poor is inadequate. Learning from social movements currently leading the transparency and accountability struggles in India, it calls for an instituting and recognition of accountability as new cultural resource and entitlement. In conclusion it argues that information, and accountability as new cultural entitlements, when mobilized through collective agency of the poor can potentially challenge the current cultures of entitlements evidenced in this paper that presently underlie social protection outcomes...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} 25 years water markets in Australia {{have been used}} to <b>transfer</b> water <b>entitlements</b> and {{allocations}} between irrigators, helping them to manage the risks associated with water supply and the demand for structural change. More recently governments have entered entitlement markets to purchase water for the environment. This paper hypothesises that a focus on purchasing entitlements will not motivate a sufficient number of irrigators to engage in the provision of environmental water. It is hypothesised that governments may need to enter the allocation market to secure long-term arrangements for counter-cyclical provision of environmental water. Avoiding any negative impacts of interference on the traditional users of this market requires a greater understanding of how irrigators currently use allocations, and what drives their decisions to buy and sell. This paper provides the fmdings of qualitative research involving 39 irrigators in three states within the Murray-Darling Basin in Australia. The findings provide a preliminary assessment of the factors influencing irrigators' decisions to trade allocations and how these factors change across and within seasons. Irrigator attitudes toward government use of the allocation market to support counter-cyclic environmental water provision are also examined. Overall, irrigators appear comfortable with the notion of trading in allocations with the government, rather than in entitlements alone. ...|$|R

40|$|Discussions of {{information}} privacy typically {{rely on the}} idea that there is a trade off between privacy and availability {{of information}}. But privacy, under some circumstances, can lead to creation of more information. In this article, I identify such circumstances by exploring the ex ante incentives created by entitlements to personal data and evaluating the long-term effects of privacy. In so doing, I introduce an economic justification of information privacy law. Under the standard law 2 ̆ 6 economics account, as long as property rights are defined and transaction costs are low, initial right allocations should be irrelevant for social welfare. But initial allocations matter when either of these two conditions is absent. Allocations also matter for production of goods that do not yet exist. Personal information has these characteristics. While the costs of disseminating information are low, transaction costs to <b>transfer</b> an <b>entitlement</b> over it are not. In addition, availability of information requires disclosure—and thereby imposes costs. This analysis challenges the traditional economic objection to information privacy and provides a new justification for privacy rules by casting them as entitlements over personal information. The approach I develop here provides a framework to identify which types of information ought to be protected and how privacy law should protect them. To do so, it analyzes the placement and optimal protection of personal information entitlements while also examining the commonalities between information privacy and intellectual property. At a more abstract level, it sheds light on the desirability of a sectoral versus an omnibus information privacy law...|$|R

Odisha has a population of over 42 million, high levels of poverty, and poor maternal and child health concentrated in its Southern districts and among Scheduled Tribe and Scheduled Caste communities. Conducted between 2008 and 2012 with the Departments of Health and Family Welfare, and Women and Child Development, the study reviewed a wide range of literature including policy and programme documents, evaluations and studies, published and grey material, and undertook secondary analysis of state level household surveys. It identifies innovative and expanded provision of health services, reforms to the management and development of human resources for health, and the introduction of a number of cash <b>transfer</b> and <b>entitlement</b> schemes as contributing to closing the gap between maternal and child health and nutrition outcomes of Scheduled Tribes, and the Southern districts, compared to the state average. The institutional delivery rate for Scheduled Tribes has risen from 11. 7 % in 2005 – 06 to 67. 3 % in 2011, and from 35. 6 % to 79. 8 % for all women. The social gradient has also closed for antenatal and postnatal care and immunisation. Nutrition indicators though improving are proving slower to budge.

40|$|In an {{important}} article, Calabresi and Melamed distinguish two different techniques for protecting legal entitlements. One {{they call a}} 2 ̆ 2 property 2 ̆ 2 rule {{and the other a}} 2 ̆ 2 liability 2 ̆ 2 rule. According to Calabresi and Melamed, a right or entitlement is protected by a property rule when it can be appropriated by a non-owner only if he first purchases permission to do so from the owner of the right. When a right is protected by a rule of this sort, one who appropriates it without the owner 2 ̆ 7 s permission will always be subject to a special sanction—typically, a fine or imprisonment. If a right is protected by a liability rule, in contrast, a non-owner who unilaterally appropriates it need only compensate the owner, after the taking, for any loss the owner suffers. The compensatory amount which a nonowner must pay for taking a right protected by a liability rule is set by a representative of the state rather than by the owner of the right in a voluntary transaction between owner and taker. Calabresi and Melamed attempt to explain why some legal entitlements are protected by a property rule and others by a liability rule. They suggest that in certain cases the cost of negotiating the voluntary transfer of a right may be sufficiently high to frustrate the transfer. Where this is so, a property rule, which is intended to encourage transfers of this sort, is likely to promote an inefficient allocation of resources. This point is illustrated by automobile accidents and pollution torts. In both cases, a voluntary <b>transfer</b> of <b>entitlements</b> is almost certain to be prohibitively expensive: {{in the case of an}} automobile accident because of the cost of identifying the victim beforehand, and in the case of pollution torts because of freerider and hold-out complications which are likely to make any negotiated settlement enormously difficult and time-consuming...|$|R
40|$|Retrenchment of {{the public}} sector as a direct {{provider}} of rented accommodation has been accompanied by a growing reliance on housing associations as alternative providers of below-market rented accommodation in the UK. The most successful vehicle to date (in terms of transferred ownership of units) for growing the not-for-profit sector has been so-called ¿large-scale voluntary transfer¿ of dwellings formerly owned by local authorities. Since {{the turn of the century}} this has been accompanied by the rapid expansion of ¿arms-length management organizations¿ in England.

The point of departure for this article is an examination of how stock transfer separates ownership over social housing attributes and the relative valuation of property rights. We argue that stock transfer involves the de jure transfer of property to a new legal entity, but that a significant part of de facto property rights remain ¿un-transferred¿, or have been redistributed within the public sector and thus do not necessarily constitute a redrawing {{of the public}} domain boundary...|$|R
40|$|Most {{people do}} not hold those who {{intentionally}} flout property laws in particularly high regard. The overridingly negative view of the property lawbreaker as a 2 ̆ 2 wrongdoer 2 ̆ 2 comports with the status of property rights within our characteristically individualist, capitalist, political culture. This reflexively dim view of property lawbreakers is also shared, to a large degree, by property theorists, many of whom regard property rights as a relatively fixed constellation of entitlements that collectively produce stability and efficiency through an orderly system of ownership. In this Article, Professors Peihalver and Katyal seek partially to rehabilitate the reviled character of the intentional property lawbreaker, and to show how property outlaws have {{played an important role}} in the evolution and <b>transfer</b> of property <b>entitlements.</b> The authors develop a typology of the property outlaw by distinguishing between 2 ̆ 2 acquisitive 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 expressive 2 ̆ 2 outlaws. They show that both types of property outlaw have enabled the reevaluation of and, at times, productive shifts in, the distribution or content of property entitlements. What emerges from this study is a vision of property law that looks beyond its capacity for fostering order and stability, focusing instead on its dynamic function as a site for the resolution of conflict between owners and nonowners. The authors argue that, if property is to perform this function, the law should be careful not to overdeter nonviolent refusals to abide by existing property arrangements...|$|R
40|$|The central allocative {{decision}} {{confronting a}} judge in a nuisance dispute should not concern {{the identity of the}} initial entitlement recipient but rather the identity of the more efficient chooserthe litigant who can more efficiently allocate the entitlement. We show that liability rules can produce four basic allocations which differ centrally in the ways in which courts delegate to litigants the authority to ultimately allocate the entitlement. Two classes concern "single chooser" rules that vest (in the absence of an agreement to the contrary) the allocative decision solely in one of the litigants. The other two classes concern a new type of rule, "dual chooser" rules, that allow either party to veto the <b>transfer</b> of an <b>entitlement.</b> Dualchooser rules are more than a theoretical curiosity both because they exist in our current law and because at times they produce systematically greater allocative efficiency than either type of single-chooser rule. Two heads are sometimes better than one. A central result of the paper is that in choosing among different liability rules allocative concerns can be decoupled from distributive concerns. There exist an infinite number of liability rules which produce each of the four basic allocations, but every rule within a particular class divides differently between the litigants the expected value of the allocation. To successfully decouple, courts should at times impose "call option," "put option," "Pay or be Paid," and "Pay or Pay" rules. ...|$|R
40|$|This Article {{explores the}} {{consequences}} for good governance of poorly constructed legal infrastructure in the Tenth Amendment context, and recommends a simple jurisprudential fix: exchanging a property rule for the inalienability remedy rule that the Supreme Court used to protect the anticommandeering entitlement in New York v. United States. Grounded in a values-based theory of American federalism, it shows how the New York inalienability rule unnecessarily removes tools for resolving interjurisdictional quagmires - exemplified by the radioactive waste capacity problem {{at the heart of}} the New York litigation - by prohibiting novel forms of state-federal bargaining. In New York, the Court held that Congress lacked the authority to bind a state 2 ̆ 7 s participation in a regulatory scheme even if state officials had effectively waived Tenth Amendment-based objections during consensual negotiations with the federal government. In so doing, the Court articulated a reasonable entitlement to federal noninterference protected by an unreasonable inalienability rule. It is an inalienability rule because any number of collective-action problems would prevent the negotiated <b>transfer</b> of the <b>entitlement</b> except through representation by elected officials. It is unreasonable because the intergovernmental partnerships thus thwarted would help resolve pressing interjurisdictional problems without offending the Constitution. Indeed, the underlying values of federalism that give meaning to the Tenth Amendment would be better served by allowing a state to decide for itself whether to hold or trade its entitlement. Focusing on the facts and legacy of the New York decision, this Article concludes that, although its inalienability rule is defensible in exclusively state or federal jurisdictional contexts, it is dubious in contexts that require regulatory attention at both the local and national level. A property rule that would enable states to bargain with their anticommandeering entitlement would not offend the touchstone of Tenth Amendment jurisprudence, which has always been the prevention of federal coercion of the states. A probargaining property rule would be more consistent with the rest of the Court 2 ̆ 7 s federalism jurisprudence, more faithful to the full panoply of values that undergird American federalism, and better for state and federal governance in difficult interjurisdictional contexts...|$|R
40|$|The European Commission's {{proposed}} {{regulations for}} further {{reform of the}} cereals, rice, dried fodder, and dairy sectors have been published. The regulations cover: direct aid schemes; support for rural development; the common organisation {{of the market in}} cereals; the common organisation of the market in rice; the common organisation of the market in dried fodder; the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products; the levy on milk and milk products. In addition to reiterating the general concept behind the process of CAP reform, the explanatory memorandum sets out the impact of the proposed reforms. The Commission claims that the 'adjustments proposed will complement the EU's international objective of ensuring that developing countries fully benefit from the expansion of world trade, while maintaining food security'. This will be achieved through reducing export availability, 'thereby contributing to stronger world market prices, which {{is in the interest of}} the agricultural sector in developing countries'. The reform process will also 'provide a sustainable and predictable policy framework for the European Model of Agriculture'. The Commission also emphasises that the reform process will require additional budgetary expenditures since farmers' incomes will need to be maintained. With regard to individual products the cereals-sector proposal would result in: a 5 % reduction in the cereals intervention price to € 95. 30 /tonnee from 2004 / 05; the abolition of seasonal corrections; and the end of intervention for rye. Area payments will be increased from € 63 to € 66 /tonne with these payments being included in the single farm payment. For protein crops the current support payment will be maintained and converted into a crop specific area payment of € 55. 57 /ha. For rice a one-step reduction in the intervention price by 50 % to an effective support price of € 150 /tonne, in line with world prices, is proposed, with direct aid being increased from € 52 /tonnee to € 177 /tonne. € 102 of this will be part of the single-farm payment, paid on the basis of historical rights, while € 75 /tonne multiplied by a specified yield will be paid as crop-specific aid. A private storage scheme will be introduced, to be triggered when the market price falls below the effective support price. In addition special measures will be triggered when market prices fall below € 120 /tonne. Proposals are also put forward for durum wheat, dairy products, starch, potatoes, dried fodder, seeds and nuts. Against this background a single farm payment will replace most of the premia under different common organisations of the market. This will cover arable crops, beef and veal, milk and dairy, sheep and goats, starch potatoes, grain legumes, rice, seeds, dried fodder. As the Commission explains it 'this single farm payment will be broken down into payment entitlements in order to facilitate their <b>transfer.</b> Each <b>entitlement</b> will be calculated by dividing the reference amount by the number of hectares, which gave rise to this amount in the reference years'. The new payment system will be linked to cross compliance with EU standards in the fields of environment, food safety, animal health and welfare and occupational safety. Accompanying these measures the EU will strengthen the rural-development pillar of the CAP. Comment: The development of the most immediate significance to the ACP concerns the rice sector, where the reduction in the EU price is likely to lead to dramatic income losses for Guyana and Surinam. According to the FAPRI study (see last edition) rice-sector reform will also lead to a 20 % expansion in EU rice production, despite an estimated 41 % decline in the EU market price of rice. With such an increase in production, EU exports are likely to rise substantially. These predicted developments sit uneasily with the European Commission's assertion that reform will reduce export availability. The sustainability of the European Model of Agriculture will be achieved by reducing the attractiveness of the EU market to below that of the world market, thereby doing away with the need for both tariff protection and export refunds. It should be noted that when the European Commission asserts a reduction in production as a result of reform, this is in comparison with production levels which would have been attained without the introduction of reform and is not with reference to current production levels. With reference to current production levels, The FAPRI study suggests that post reform production levels will be higher in all major products except barley and beef. It should be borne in mind that with the budgetary ceiling fixed, further reform is likely to be more difficult to secure agreement on, since new expenditures will need to be financed from saving elsewhere in the CAP budget. This will require hard negotiations in the EU Council and this could well slow down the pace of reform, particularly if the US$/euro exchange rate makes export refunds more expensive. The European Commission's proposed regulations for further reform of the [...] ...|$|R
