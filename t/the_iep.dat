40|$|We have {{analyzed}} mechanisms {{used by the}} HCMV IE proteins {{to activate}} transcription. We have shown that <b>the</b> <b>IEPs</b> act as promiscuous co-activators of transcription. IEP 86 shows preferences in activating simple promoters by associating with multiple upstream bound factors. IEP 72 synergizes with IEP 86 without directly interacting with these factors. These mechanisms are conserved in the activation of complex viral and cellular promoters by <b>the</b> <b>IEPs.</b> <b>The</b> <b>IEPs</b> bridge to <b>the</b> basal complex by multiple interactions with TFIID, in a TAF-like fashion. IEP 72 and IEP 86 expressed during viral infection co-purify with TFIID over phosphocellulose, and co-immunoprecipitate with TFIID. IEP 72 and IEP 86 contact hTAFII 130 simultaneously, and simultaneous contact is required to fully rescue the ts transcriptional defect in TAFII 250 in the BHK- 21 cell line, ts 13. <b>The</b> <b>IEPs</b> do not rescue the defect in cell cycle progression in these cells. This effect is correlated with the inability of <b>the</b> <b>IEPs</b> to down-regulate <b>the</b> promoter of the cell cycle inhibitor p 21 /WAF 1 /CIP 1. Regardless of the inability to rescue the cell cycle defect, IEP expression in ts 13 cells at the non-permissive temperature rescues the cells from apoptosis, and this effect is independent of transcriptional activation. The promiscuous activity of <b>the</b> <b>IEPs</b> is thus due {{to their ability to}} co-activate transcription in a TAF-like fashion. We have taken the approach of studying protein-protein interactions between <b>the</b> <b>IEPs</b> and cellular proteins {{in order to understand the}} observed activities of <b>the</b> <b>IEPs.</b> <b>The</b> thesis has been guided by our lab 2 ̆ 7 s previous investigations into the functions of SV 40 large T antigen, and we have found that <b>the</b> <b>IEPs</b> are qualitatively very similar in mechanism to large T. However, <b>the</b> <b>IEPs</b> have not been independently correlated with transformation in any model system, so the comparison of <b>the</b> <b>IEPs</b> with T antigen also provides an opportunity to contrast the similarities between the mechanisms of the proteins with differences in their effects on host cell metabolism. ...|$|R

40|$|Researchers have {{identified}} a trend of brain waste, brain abuse and brain drain {{on the part of}} internationally educated professionals (IEPs) after they immigrate to Canada. University-based bridging programs have been implemented in the past decade to meet the need of this population to integrate to the new society. My dissertation attempts to inquire into the experiences, emotional experiences in particular, of <b>the</b> <b>IEPs</b> who studied in the university-based bridging programs in Ontario. I raised four questions: First, how do <b>the</b> <b>IEPs</b> perceive their new realities? Second, what are the anxieties of <b>the</b> <b>IEPs?</b> Third, what realities lead them to those anxieties and how do their anxieties affect their perception of the challenges they face? Fourth, what role does higher education play in mirroring and shaping <b>the</b> way <b>the</b> <b>IEPs</b> perceive and feel the realities? Using in-depth interviewing as the research method, I had three one-hour interviews with each of the five research participants who volunteered in this study. When analyzing the five cases, I focused on the conflicts, contentions and contradictions that the interview transcripts revealed of the participants experiences in relation to others. I resorted to theories in psychoanalysis in order to understand <b>the</b> <b>IEPs</b> anxieties when they encountered various challenges both internally and externally. I find that <b>the</b> <b>IEPs</b> anxieties are partly inherent in the process of immigration, partly reflective of their own modes of learning and the need of external support and partly the side effect of higher education which, questionably, attempts to reproduce the correlation between knowledge and privileges. I argue that the bridging programs and <b>the</b> <b>IEPs</b> need to learn from their anxieties and the social anxieties and engage in a critical exploration of the difficult knowledge of the-self-in-the-changing-world...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{describe}} teenage girls’ experiences and perceptions of participation and influence during learning processes. The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and the view that children are social actors with their own agency were central to the study. The girls, who were 13 years old when the study began, and 16 when it ended, were interviewed once per semester for three years. Classroom observations {{formed the basis of}} the interviews, which provided insight into the learning environment and its working methods. These, in turn, were discussed during the interviews. Nine girls were selected through <b>the</b> <b>IEPs</b> that <b>the</b> school had established for them. They attended regular classes for most of the school day, but received at least one session of special education in smaller groups each week. Their special needs were due to reading and writing difficulties. All of them received special support in English, while seven of the girls also received special support in mathematics. The girls described current events in their life, regarding both school and their spare time, as well as their thoughts about the future, and how efforts to accommodate their special educational needs have affected their schooling. In addition to the girls’ narratives, <b>the</b> <b>IEPs</b> and grades provided the school’s narrative about the girls. The theoretical basis of the thesis comprises cultural-historical ideas of teaching and learning, and the importance of relationships to group-based learning. Descriptive qualitative analyses were based on the teenage girls’ narratives and resulted in five themes; a sixth theme discussed the school’s assessment of the girls through <b>the</b> <b>IEPs</b> and their grades from lower secondary school. Feeling included or not in the group was the overarching theme of all the stories, which involved the girls’ perceptions of how they were treated by the people around them. The results indicate that the girls needed to have instructions repeated to them. There was also a need for continuous encouragement and affirmation {{in order for them to}} dare to take on assignments. When it came to collaborative learning together with classmates, the girls preferred to hide their perceived weaknesses, which only made them more dependent on the teacher’s aid. In addition, the girls felt that the teachers were unhappy with the way they handled their school work, and felt overlooked rather than “seen”. In both the stories and <b>the</b> <b>IEPs,</b> concentration difficulties were highlighted as a consistent problem. The analyses show that it is not possible to speak of concentration difficulties without further specification. Since the girls also explained that they were able to maintain concentration, it is necessary to identify which conditions allow pupils to maintain their skills, and when these skills are lost. One finding was that experiences of playing sports created unexpected development opportunities for performing under pressure, even in test situations. According to the girls, visual strengths could compensate for difficulties remembering comprehensive information. The teaching provided opportunities to demonstrate an understanding of facts through visual expression, but creative elements were not included in graded assessments. The study shows that the girls’ leisure-time experiences created opportunities for generalisation regarding learning strategies in school situations...|$|R
