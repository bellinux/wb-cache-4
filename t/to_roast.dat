5|$|Jane Bulcock {{and her son}} John Bulcock, {{both from}} Newchurch in Pendle, were accused and found guilty of the murder by {{witchcraft}} of Jennet Deane. Both denied that they had attended the meeting at Malkin Tower, but Jennet Device identified Jane as having {{been one of those}} present, and John as having turned the spit <b>to</b> <b>roast</b> the stolen sheep, the centrepiece of the Good Friday meeting at the Demdike's home.|$|E
5|$|In the Enchanted Forest, Hansel (Lord) and Gretel (Collins), {{are searching}} for {{kindling}} while their father (Lea) chops firewood. He gives Gretel a compass so they won't be separated, but when they return, he {{is nowhere to be}} found. As they search they run into The Evil Queen (Parrilla) and are captured. She tells the two that she can help find their father, on the condition that they retrieve an item belonging to her from The Blind Witch (Emma Caulfield). They must enter her gingerbread house when The Blind Witch is asleep and fetch The Evil Queen's leather satchel, but they must not eat a thing. They break in safely, but Hansel gives in to the temptation of taking a bite of a cupcake, causing The Blind Witch to wake up. While she cannot see the children, she can smell their scent. The Blind Witch locks them up and prepares the oven <b>to</b> <b>roast</b> them. The two, working together, are able to push the witch into her own oven as The Evil Queen, who is gleefully watching the events from her mirror, magically sends a bolt of fire through her mirror into the witch's oven, roasting her alive.|$|E
5|$|Michael decides {{the workers}} are {{stressed}} because they are reluctant to express their feelings, so he organizes a comedic roast of himself in the warehouse. Dwight tricks most of the employees into signing his apology letter by pretending it is a sign-in sheet, but Phyllis (Phyllis Smith) catches on and refuses to sign it. Each {{of the office and}} warehouse workers gleefully take jabs at Michael, who initially seems to enjoy the jokes, but grows increasingly uncomfortable and offended. When it comes time for him <b>to</b> <b>roast</b> his employees, Michael ends up storming out of the warehouse, visibly upset. After the roast, Michael takes a personal day (much to the concern of his employees, who start to feel bad about the scathing jokes towards Michael) and spends time at a playground to reflect, feeding pigeons by tossing whole slices of bread on the ground and making bird noises, despite the lack of birds in the winter weather. Dwight tricks Phyllis into signing his apology letter by bribing a mailman to ask her to sign for a fake package. Michael returns to the office, where he roasts each of his co-workers with one-liners. Stanley laughs heartily when Michael roasts him, breaking the tension. Michael tells his employees that they are the reason he got into the paper business, and they applaud him.|$|E
5000|$|In Vietnam {{coffee is}} often coated with oil (traditionally {{clarified}} butter) {{and a small}} amount of sugar prior <b>to</b> <b>roasting</b> <b>to</b> produce a [...] "butter roast". The roasting process results in an additional caramelized coating on the beans.|$|R

25|$|The {{roasted coffee}} beans may be ground at a roastery, {{in a grocery}} store, or in the home.

It is also possible, though uncommon, <b>to</b> <b>roast</b> raw beans at home.|$|E
25|$|While the {{standard}} modern English spelling {{of the word}} is barbecue, variations including barbeque and truncations such as bar-b-q or BBQ may also be found. The spelling barbeque is given in Merriam-Webster and the Oxford Dictionaries as a variant. In the southeastern United States, the word barbecue is used predominantly as a noun referring <b>to</b> <b>roast</b> pork, while in the southwestern states cuts of beef are often cooked.|$|E
25|$|The day is {{also called}} ziua pelinului ("mugwort day") or ziua bețivilor ("drunkards' day") {{and it is}} celebrated to ensure good wine in autumn and, for people and farm animals alike, good health and {{protection}} from the elements of nature (storms, hail, illness, pests). People would have parties in natural surroundings, with lăutari (fiddlers) for those who could afford it. Then it is customary <b>to</b> <b>roast</b> and eat lamb, along with new mutton cheese, and to drink mugwort-flavoured wine, or just red wine, to refresh the blood and get protection from diseases. On the way back, the men wear lilac or mugwort flowers on their hats.|$|E

25|$|According to Onstad, Roast Beef is one {{of several}} {{important}} foils to the increasingly central character of Ray. Ray's consistent optimism, sexual bravado, unwavering confidence, privileged upbringing, simple attitudes, and good luck makes him seem on the surface a complete antithesis of character <b>to</b> <b>Roast</b> Beef. Regardless, the two have been close friends since childhood, and it may be observed that as the strip progresses, each occasionally adopts the attitudes and perspectives of the other. The two do, of course, have a few points of dissent: Roast Beef is somewhat more sympathetic to Little Nephew than his Uncle Ray, and has taken issue with Ray's alcoholism.|$|E
25|$|Processing {{of coffee}} in India is {{accomplished}} using two methods, dry processing and wet processing. Dry processing is the traditional method of drying in the sun which is favoured for its flavour producing characteristics. In the wet processing method, coffee beans are fermented and washed, which is the preferred method for improved yields. As to the wet processing, the beans are subject to cleaning to segregate defective seeds. The beans of different varieties and sizes are then blended to derive the best flavour. The next procedure is <b>to</b> <b>roast</b> either through roasters or individual roasters. Then the roasted coffee is ground to appropriate sizes.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{method of}} liberating the metal from the tin ore necessitated two smeltings: {{the first was}} done {{at or near the}} streamworks and involved no more than a fire used <b>to</b> <b>roast</b> the ore; the second smelting was done at one of the Stannary towns. Little is known of the details of these practices, but their existence is confirmed by early documents that mention taxation of first and second smeltings. The introduction of the efficient blowing house process in around 1300 allowed the use of just one smelting. Later still reverberatory furnaces were used. Both types were in use at Eylesbarrow mine {{in the first half of}} the 19th century—the last place on Dartmoor where smelting was done.|$|E
5000|$|Apple Spätzle: a sweet variant, {{which can}} be found in the Allgäu and in the region of the Lake Constance. Steamed slices of apple or rather stewed apple are added <b>to</b> <b>roasted</b> Spätzle which is then {{sprinkled}} with sugar or cinnamon.|$|R
5000|$|A {{chestnut}} knife is used {{to score}} a chestnut with an [...] "X" [...] cut prior <b>to</b> <b>roasting,</b> so that steam does not build up inside and cause the nut to explode.

25|$|In Spain, {{sweet potato}} is called boniato. On {{the evening of}} All Souls' Day, in Catalonia (northeastern Spain) it is {{traditional}} <b>to</b> serve <b>roasted</b> sweet potato and chestnuts, panellets and sweet wine.

25|$|Domne Eafe {{had sent}} her {{daughter}} Mildrith to Chelles in France, to study under abbess Wilcoma, where she also collected relics. After having been treated harshly by the abbess, (including an attempt <b>to</b> <b>roast</b> her alive for refusing to marry a relative of the abbess) she fled back to Kent. On landing at Ebbsfleet, the imprint of her sandal was made in a rock, which later had a chapel built over it. Mildrith became a nun at Thanet, and later succeeded her mother to become the second Abbess. On her death (on July 13th) she {{was buried in the}} Church of St Mary, but her successor, Eadburh, built a second Church at Thanet, St Peter and St Paul, and translated her still incorrupt remains there.|$|E
25|$|Campfires {{have been}} used for cooking since time immemorial. Possibly the {{simplest}} method of cooking over a campfire {{and one of the most}} common is <b>to</b> <b>roast</b> food on long skewers that can be held above the flames. This is a popular technique for cooking hot dogs or toasting marshmallows for making s'mores. This type of cooking over the fire typically consists of comfort foods that are easy to prepare. There is also no clean up involved unlike an actual kitchen. Another technique is to use pie irons—small iron molds with long handles. Campers put slices of bread with some kind of filling into the molds and put them over hot coals to cook. Campers sometimes use elaborate grills, cast iron pots, and fire irons to cook. Often, however, they use portable stoves for cooking instead of campfires. :For more information, see Campfire cooking.|$|E
25|$|In January 1669, Morgan brought ten {{ships and}} 800 men to Isla Vaca as a {{rendezvous}} point before launching {{a raid on}} the Spanish city of Cartagena. Because {{he and his fellow}} buccaneers had just captured two French warships, they decided to celebrate in the easily accessible Ferret Bay on the northwest side of the island. They made a fire <b>to</b> <b>roast</b> several pigs and fired the cannons of their flagship as was typical for a buccaneer celebration. In the midst of their drunken revelry, the ship's gunpowder magazine was accidentally lit, triggering an explosion that blew up Morgan's flagship Oxford. In the explosion, Morgan, who was on board the ship, was thrown through the window of his quarters and into the sea. He survived the accident, but the Oxford sank, taking down with it the two captured French warships (which were tied to it) and about 200 of his men.|$|E
50|$|Rat-on-a-stick, also {{referred}} to as rat kebab, is a dish or snack consisting of a roasted rat served on a stick or skewer. The dish is consumed in Thailand and Vietnam.

25|$|FitzGerald's {{government}} {{lasted until}} January 1982 when it collapsed {{due to a}} controversial budget which proposed the application of Value Added Tax to children's shoes, previously exempt. FitzGerald, no longer having {{a majority in the}} Dáil, went to Áras an Uachtaráin to advise President Hillery to dissolve the Dáil and call a general election. However, the night the government collapsed the Fianna Fáil Front Bench issued a statement encouraging the President not to grant the dissolution and to allow Fianna Fáil to form a government. Phone calls were also made to the President by Brian Lenihan. Haughey, on attempting to contact his former colleague the President, and on failing to be put through to him, was reported to have threatened the President's aide de camp by telling him that he would be Taoiseach one day and when that happened, I intend <b>to</b> <b>roast</b> your fucking arse if you don't put me through immediately. Hillery considered such pressure to be gross misconduct, and granted the dissolution.|$|E

25|$|Coffee {{can also}} be {{incorporated}} with alcohol to produce a variety of beverages: it is combined with whiskey in Irish coffee, and it forms the base of alcoholic coffee liqueurs such as Kahlúa and Tia Maria.

50|$|Another {{aspect to}} take into account too is that cooking methods can affect the {{allergenicity}} of peanut. For instance, roasted peanuts have higher levels of Ara h1 than fried and boiled peanut preparations. When it comes <b>to</b> <b>roasting</b> peanuts, it increases the efficiency of Ara h1 extraction and/or the accessibility of the epitopes recognized by the antibodies used to measure the allergen.|$|R
