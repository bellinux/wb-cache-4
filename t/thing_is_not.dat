However, it sold a mere 30,000 copies that year and reached a peak chart position of 101. He left Caesars Palace in September that year after an incident where executive Sanford Waterman pulled a gun on him. He performed several charity concerts with Count Basie at the Royal Festival Hall in London. On November 2, 1970, Sinatra recorded the last songs for Reprise Records before his self-imposed retirement, announced the following June at a concert in Hollywood {{to raise money for the}} Motion Picture and TV Relief Fund. He finished the concert with a [...] "rousing" [...] performance of [...] "That's Life", and stated [...] "Excuse me while I disappear" [...] as he left the stage. He told LIFE journalist Thomas Thompson that [...] "I've got things to do, like the first <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> to do [...] at all for eight months... maybe a year", while Barbara Sinatra later claimed that Sinatra had grown [...] "tired of entertaining people, especially when all they really wanted were the same old tunes he had long ago become bored by". While he was in retirement, President Richard Nixon asked him to perform at a Young Voters Rally in anticipation of the upcoming campaign. Sinatra obliged and chose to sing [...] "My Kind of Town" [...] for the rally held in Chicago on October 20, 1972.|$|E

2500|$|In 1936, philosopher Alfred Ayer {{considered}} the standard philosophical question of other minds: {{how do we}} know that other people have the same conscious experiences that we do? In his book, Language, Truth and Logic, Ayer suggested a protocol to distinguish between a conscious man and an unconscious machine: [...] "The only ground I can have for asserting that an object which appears to be conscious is not really a conscious being, but only a dummy or a machine, is that it fails to satisfy one of the empirical tests by which the presence or absence of consciousness is determined." [...] (This suggestion is very similar to the Turing test, but is concerned with consciousness rather than intelligence. Moreover, it is not certain that Ayer's popular philosophical classic was familiar to Turing.) In other words, a <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> conscious if it fails the consciousness test.|$|E
2500|$|In his Phenomenology of Perception (first {{published}} in French in 1945), Merleau-Ponty developed {{the concept of}} the body-subject (le corps propre) {{as an alternative to the}} Cartesian [...] "ego cogito." [...] This distinction is especially important in that Merleau-Ponty perceives the essences of the world existentially. Consciousness, the world, and the human body as a perceiving thing are intricately intertwined and mutually [...] "engaged." [...] The phenomenal <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> the unchanging object of the natural sciences, but a correlate of our body and its sensory-motor functions. Taking up and [...] "communing with" [...] (Merleau-Ponty's phrase) the sensible qualities it encounters, the body as incarnated subjectivity intentionally elaborates things within an ever-present world frame, through use of its pre-conscious, pre-predicative understanding of the world's makeup. The elaboration, however, is [...] "inexhaustible" [...] (the hallmark of any perception according to Merleau-Ponty). Things are that upon which our body has a [...] "grip" [...] (prise), while the grip itself is a function of our connaturality with the world's things. The world and the sense of self are emergent phenomena in an ongoing [...] "becoming." ...|$|E

Sillard, one of Mitchel's biographers, quoted from the speech of Mitchel's defence Council Robert Holms, [...] "The foreman of the Grand Jury, gentlemen, having been asked if the jury had found bills against the prisoner—replied— 'Oh yes, we find him guilty of sedition.' 'Gentlemen,' said the officer of the court, 'he is not indicted for sedition.' 'Well,' said the fore man, 'we find him guilty of treason.' 'But, gentlemen,' again interrupted the officer, 'the charge against Mr Mitchel is for felony.' 'Oh, no matter!' said the foreman, 'sedition, treason, or felony, {{it is all the}} same to us."

2500|$|One {{consequence}} {{of this is that}} the target audience is extremely fluid: while some of his works are clearly published as children's literature (picture books, cassettes), the distinction between youth, young adult and adult literature is not easily made; traditional story-telling addresses the entire community at once. [...] The interplay of truth and fiction, always difficult concepts, is a recurring theme in Schami's writings. [...] Der ehrliche Lügner opens with the words: [...] "My name is Sadik, but not even that is certain." [...] Elsewhere we are told that the important <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> whether stories are true, but rather how we live with them (A Handful of Stars). [...] Although elements from fairy-tale worlds may appear in these stories, they are always rooted in daily life. [...] Schami has made a distinction between Illusion and Phantasie (illusion and vision). [...] Illusion is an unachievable dream, distorting the world to something impossible, whereas vision is the imaginative construction of achievable goals; rooted in reality it indicates something which can be striven for, but this reality means also accepting the other possibility, that there may not be a happy ending. [...] Asked by a radio interviewer whether literature is an escape from reality, Schami answers, yes: but one which enables the reader to return to reality better equipped.|$|E
