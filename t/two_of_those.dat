5|$|Beginning in the 1950s, Russian paleontologists began {{excavating}} Psittacosaurus {{remains at}} a locality {{near the village}} of Shestakovo in the oblast of Kemerovo in Siberia. Two other nearby localities were explored in the 1990s, one of which produced several complete skeletons. This species was named P. sibiricus in 2000 in a scientific paper written by five Russian paleontologists, but credit for the name is officially given to <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> authors, Alexei Voronkevich and Alexander Averianov. The remains were not completely described until 2006.

Quarterback Manuel completed <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> three pass attempts, gaining 37 yards and advancing deep into Virginia Tech territory. A pass interference penalty against Virginia Tech advanced the Seminoles to the Tech 11-yard line, and three rushing plays later, running back Ty Jones crossed the goal line for a touchdown.

5|$|Forecasts of {{hurricane}} activity are issued before each hurricane season by noted hurricane experts such as Dr. William M. Gray {{and his associates}} at Colorado State University (CSU). A normal season {{as defined by the}} National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), has eleven named storms, of which six reach hurricane strength and <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> become major hurricanes. On May 31, 1989, the CSU forecast that there would be seven named storms, four of which would intensify into a hurricane; there was no prediction of the number of major hurricanes. Prior to the season, the Weather Research Center (WRC) in Houston, Texas also issued a forecast, which called for ten named storms and six hurricanes.|$|E

Tudur Hen retained his prestige and lands {{after the death of}} Llywelyn in 1282 and the victory of the English.

5|$|Lieutenant Governor J. C. W. Beckham {{ascended to}} the office of governor, and he and Taylor waged a {{protracted}} court battle over the governorship.

Five went to trial; <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> were acquitted. Each of the remaining three were convicted in trials fraught with irregularities and were eventually pardoned by subsequent governors. The identity of Goebel's assassin remains a mystery.|$|E
5|$|Of the season's eight {{tropical}} cyclones, four reached hurricane status. Furthermore, <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> four strengthened into major hurricanes, {{which are}} Category3 or {{higher on the}} modern-day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. The strongest cyclone of the season, the third hurricane, peaked at Category4 strength with 150mph (240km/h) winds. With a minimum barometric pressure of , {{it was the most}} intense tropical cyclone recorded in the Atlantic basin until the 1924 Cuba hurricane. The hurricane caused 40fatalities after a brig went missing off the coast of North Carolina. Despite remaining offshore, Tropical Storm Five brought very strong winds to the Mexican city of Veracruz. Hurricane Eight brought strong winds and rough seas to North Florida and Georgia, causing significant damage in the latter.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} junking process was halted and the BBC {{established}} its Film and Videotape Library {{for the purpose}} of storage and preservation, archive selector Sue Malden began to audit what material remained in the BBC's stores.

5|$|Sixteen indictments were {{returned}} {{in connection with}} Goebel's assassination, including one against deposed governor Taylor. In May 1900, Taylor fled to Indianapolis, Indiana, and the governor, James A. Mount refused to extradite him for trial. Three others charged in the assassination turned state's evidence.

Kentucky's Secretary of State, Caleb Powers, was accused of being the mastermind behind the assassination. Henry Youtsey, the State Auditor of Kentucky, {{was said to have}} aided the assassin. James B. Howard, a participant in a bloody feud in Clay County was charged with being the actual assassin.|$|E
5|$|Sixteen people, {{including}} Taylor, {{were eventually}} indicted in {{the assassination of}} Governor Goebel. Three accepted immunity from prosecution in exchange for testimony. Only five ever went to trial, <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> being acquitted. Convictions were handed down against Taylor's Secretary of State Caleb Powers, Henry Youtsey, and Jim Howard. The prosecution charged that Powers was the mastermind, having a political opponent killed so that his boss, Governor Taylor, could stay in office. Youtsey was an alleged intermediary, and Howard, who {{was said to have}} been in Frankfort to seek a pardon from Taylor for the killing of a man in a family feud, was accused of being the actual assassin.|$|E
