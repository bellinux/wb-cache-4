Sélestat still has two old arsenals, Sainte-Barbe on the main square (1470) and Saint-Hilaire (1518). The first, with a large crenelated gable, is a fine example of Gothic architecture.|$|E
5|$|LeHand {{was born}} in Potsdam, New York, to DanielJ. and MaryJ. (née Graffin) LeHand, who were the {{children}} of Irish immigrants. The parents began their family at age 16 with a son, also called Daniel, followed by Bernard, Anna and finally Marguerite, when <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> 40s. When {{she was a young}} child, the family relocated to Somerville, a working class suburb of Boston, where LeHand was struck by rheumatic fever at age fifteen. It permanently damaged her heart, causing episodes of atrial fibrillation and leading to her premature death. Eleanor Roosevelt later stated that the disease had left her delicate and barred from strenuous exercise. She graduated from Somerville High School in 1917, where she took secretarial courses in preparation for a career. Although she never attended college, in 1937 Rosary College (now called Dominican University) recognized her professional achievements with an honorary Doctor of Laws, presented at the White House.|$|E

The French had also dug mines under the redoubts, ravelins and lunettes to blow them up. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> turn countermined by Dutch sappers. On 25 July Loudon's Highlanders, {{also known as the}} 64th Foot, made a sally from Fort Rover which took and destroyed a major French battery. Over the course of the siege, other British troops, engineers and artillery joined the allied garrison as well as some Austrian miners.|$|E

25|$|Immigrants {{may find}} {{that they are a}} part of a lower {{socioeconomic}} status group in the United States than <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> home country. Immigration research shows that it is rarely the poorest citizens of the sending countries that immigrate to the United States, simply because they cannot afford the associated costs. This is particularly true when they come from countries where the cost of living is not as high as in the United States. Individuals who may have held professional occupations in their country of origin may find themselves in low-paying jobs if their certifications are not recognized by the United States. When families migrate to the United States from a country with a patriarchal society, men in particular may experience a loss of status.|$|E

25|$|Circa 1986, viewers {{were made}} aware of another child, Kenny, who had moved away to New Zealand before 1985. In addition, the {{character}} of Lou Beale also featured heavily within a series of spin-off EastEnders novels by Hugh Miller, set prior to 1985 and published in 1986. Within the novelisations readers were introduced to further characters from Lou's history: sons Harry and Ronnie, a daughter Dora and siblings Elsie, Liz, Queenie and Terence. Kenny also appeared in the books. In the EastEnders novels, Harry, Dora and Ronnie moved away from home when <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> twenties and lost contact with their mother. The Beales' fruit and veg stall on Bridge Street market was passed to Ronnie after his father's death, and again passed to Pete when Ronnie moved away from Walford.|$|E
25|$|Public {{housing is}} {{overwhelmingly}} segregated {{between the two}} communities. Intercommunal tensions have forced substantial numbers of people to move from mixed areas into areas inhabited exclusively by one denomination, thus increasing the degree of polarisation and segregation. The extent of self-segregation grew very rapidly with {{the outbreak of the}} Troubles. In 1969, 69 per cent of Protestants and 56 per cent of Catholics lived in streets where <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> own majority; as the result of large-scale flight from mixed areas between 1969 and 1971 following outbreaks of violence, the respective proportions had by 1972 increased to 99 per cent of Protestants and 75 per cent of Catholics. In Belfast, the 1970s were a time of rising residential segregation. It was estimated in 2004 that 92.5% of public housing in Northern Ireland was divided along religious lines, with the figure rising to 98% in Belfast. Self-segregation is a continuing process, despite the Northern Ireland peace process. It was estimated in 2005 that more than 1,400 people a year were being forced to move as a consequence of intimidation.|$|E

2500|$|As {{the early}} {{members of the}} Western Sephardim {{consisted}} of persons who themselves (or whose immediate forebears) personally experienced an interim period as New Christians, which resulted in unceasing trials and persecutions of crypto-Judaism by the Portuguese and Spanish Inquisitions, the early community continued to be augmented by further New Christian emigration pouring out of the Iberian Peninsula in a continuous flow between the 1600s to 1700s. Jewish-origin New Christians were officially considered Christians due to their forced or coerced conversions; as such they were subject to {{the jurisdiction of the}} Catholic Church's Inquisitorial system, and were subject to harsh heresy and apostasy laws if they continued to practice their ancestral Jewish faith. Those New Christians who eventually fled both the Iberian cultural sphere and jurisdiction of the Inquisition were able to officially return to Judaism and open Jewish practice once <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> new tolerant environments of refuge.|$|E
2500|$|Beyond {{a simple}} {{condemnation}} of authoritarian value systems, Fromm used {{the story of}} Adam and Eve as an allegorical explanation for human biological evolution and existential angst, asserting that when Adam and Eve ate from the Tree of Knowledge, they became aware of themselves as being separate from nature while still being part of it. [...] This is why they felt [...] "naked" [...] and [...] "ashamed": [...] they had evolved into human beings, conscious of themselves, their own mortality, and their powerlessness before {{the forces of nature}} and society, and no longer united with the universe as <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> instinctive, pre-human existence as animals. [...] According to Fromm, the awareness of a disunited human existence is a source of guilt and shame, and the solution to this existential dichotomy is found in the development of one's uniquely human powers of love and reason. However, Fromm distinguished his concept of love from unreflective popular notions as well as Freudian paradoxical love (see the criticism by Marcuse below).|$|E

2500|$|There {{were two}} {{distinct}} family patterns {{that emerged in}} Christian Europe throughout the Middle Ages.

[...] The man involved was older, usually in his late twenties, and the girl was often still a teenager. [...] Their household would contain several generations, an occurrence demographers denote as a [...] "complex" [...] household. [...] In contrast, areas in Northwestern Europe gave rise to a familial structure that was unique for the time period. [...] The man and woman were typically around the same age, and would wait until <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> early twenties to marry. [...] Following the marriage, the couple would set up their own independent household (termed a [...] "nuclear" [...] household structure). [...] This led to a lower birthrate, as well as greater levels of economic stability for the new couple. [...] This also served as a check on the increasing population in Europe.
