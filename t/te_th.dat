The acid–base properties of both ligands were investigated {{as well as their}} coordination chemistry, especially with Cu 2 +, when possible in aqueous solution and in the solid state. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction structures of complexes were determined. Stability constants of the copper(II) and zinc(II) complexes showed that the complexes of both ligands with Cu 2 + are thermodynamically very stable, and they exhibit an important selectivity for Cu 2 + over Zn 2 +. The kinetic inertness in acidic medium of both copper(II) complexes was evaluated revealing a quite good resistance to dissociation (the half-life times of complexes with <b>te</b> 1 <b>th</b> and <b>te</b> 2 <b>th</b> are 50. 8 and 5. 8 min, respectively, in 5 M HCl and 30 °C). The coordination geometry of the metal center in the complexes was established in aqueous solution based on UV–visible, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, DFT studies, and NMR by using the zinc(II) complex analogues. The [Cu(te 1 th) ] 2 + and [Cu(te 2 th) ] 2 + complexes adopt trans-I and trans-III configurations both in the solid state and in solution, while the [Zn(te 2 th) ] 2 + complex crystallizes as the cis-V isomer but exists in solution as a mixture of trans-III and cis-V forms. Cyclic voltammetry experiments in acetonitrile point to a relatively easy reduction of [Cu(te 2 th) ] 2 + in acetonitrile solution (Epc = − 0. 41 V vs NHE), but the reduced complex does not undergo dissociation in the time scale of our electrochemical experiments.

Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) was used to derive monthly actual evapotranspiration (ET) and ETrF values during the growing season of 2012. The methodology was developed using medium resolution Landsat 7 ETM+ images. Meteorological data from the archive of the Institute for Research and Technology, Thessaly (I.

Filtering of reflectance values with the use of relative spectral responses (RSR) gives the opportunity to match the spectral measurements with Landsat ETM+ bands and compute VI like NDVI, SAVI, EVI and EVI 2 using the same remote sensing formulas as the ETM+ conventional procedures. New relationships are derived and NDVI, SAVI, EVI and EVI 2 are tested separately for each crop. Special attention is given to the constant L inside the SAVI relationship.

A total of 391 participants from areas of heavy and moderate fighting, were included. Higher concentrations for selected elements (Al, As, Ba, Bi, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ga, Li, Mg, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Pd, Ti, U, V, W, Zn i Zr), almost all connected with fire arms, were determinated in one or more samples, compared to other countries. Also, compared to subjects from areas exposed to moderate fighting, subjects from areas exposed to heavy fighting had significantly higher serum concentrations of Al, B, Eu, Hg, Rb, Re, Tl, Tm and Zr; significantly higher urine concentrations of As, Cu, Ge, Rh, Sc, Se and Si; and significantly higher hair concentrations of Ag, Al, As, Au, B, Ba, Bi, Cd, Ce, Co, Cr, Cs, Cu, Dy, Er, Eu, Fe, Ga, Gd, Ge, Hf, Hg, Ho, Ir, K, Li, Lu, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Nb, Nd, Ni, P, Pr, Pt, Rb, Re, Ru, Sb, Si, Sm, Sn, Sr, Ta, <b>Te,</b> <b>Th,</b> Tl, Tm, V, W, Yb, Zn and Zr.

40|$|International audienceChildren ingest house settled dust by normal hand {{to mouth}} activity. Because house dust {{contains}} some metals associated with health hazards, this pathway of exposure {{is an issue}} in health risk assessment. The concentration of metals in house dust is thus a matter of concern, together with their bioaccessibility, that is, the fraction absorbed by humans. This review examines articles studying the metal content (excluding Pb) in the household dust in ordinary homes. Relatively few articles report the concentrations and bioaccessibility of metals in settled dust. Ag, As, Al, Au, Ba, Be, Bi, Br, Ca, Cd, Ce, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hf, Hg, I, K, La, Li, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Ni, P, Rb, Sb, Sc, Se, Sm, Sn, Sr, <b>Te,</b> <b>Th,</b> Ti, U, V and Zn have been studied. Al, Ca, Fe, K, Mg, Na and P are found in concentrations exceeding 1000 μg. g− 1. Bioaccessibility is documented still more rarely and varies substantially between and within metals (Ag, 60 - 90 %; As, 10 - 90 %; Al, 10 - 80 %; Cd, 50 - 90 %; Co, 15 - 50 %; Cr, 10 - 50 %; Cu, 20 - 80 %; Fe, 5 - 45 %; Hg, 10 %; Mn, 40 - 60 %; Ni, 20 - 80 %; Sn, 5 - 10 %; U, 10 - 30 %; Zn, 80 - 90 %). It depends on chemical speciation, particle size and organic carbon, which {{play a role in}} metal partitioning among mineral and organic phases and thus in the digestion process. Digestion conditions: temperature, pH, duration and type of acid used are thus essential parameters that determine the metal concentrations measured in dust. House-dust concentrations of metals and metalloids vary throughout a home as well as between homes and across seasons and locations. House-dust metal content has also changed over time due to the decrease in industrial emissions in some regions and the evolution of automobile ones. Furthermore, soil metal concentration cannot predict indoor dust metal concentrations. It is thus difficult to predict metal content or its bioaccessibility. Local measurements are therefore essential for consideration of this background exposure...|$|E

An opportunity for such investigations has been provided by a project of the EuroGeoSurvey Geochemistry Expert Group aimed at the characterization of groundwater geochemistry using bottled mineral waters purchased in supermarkets all over Europe which included also the analysis for comparative purpose, of tap water. The initial tap water database of 24 sites has been subsequently increased to the final number of 157 distributed all over Italy and representative of end-user situations (either private houses and public places).

Some major elements (Ca, HCO 3 -, Mg), the dominant water type, display limited range of variation whereas for others (Na, Cl-) the scattering is wider (3 orders of magnitude). Only one sample for Cl and two samples for NO 3 - are above the recommended EU and Italian guidelines. Clear influence of bedrock geology and/aquifer composition is clear for some elements (e. g. As, F, Rb, V, U), other elements are indicator of mixing with deep formation water or sea-spray contribution (e. g. Br, l), others reflect also peculiar geographic area (e. g.

40|$|High-grade {{gold and}} uranium {{mineralization}} in the Witwatersrand basin is intimately associated with pyrobitumen, implying that hydrocarbons {{may have played}} a role in the genesis of these ores. The nature of the pyrobitumen in the Carbon Leader Reef was therefore investigated to determine if hydrocarbons were essential to the ore-forming process. The relative proportions of trace elements in pyrobitumen seams and nodules are, in large part, similar to those of organic-rich shales located within the sedimentary succession. This indicates a strong genetic relationship between the pyrobitumen and the shales. A network of veins and veinlets filled with pyrobitumen, and the occurrence of oil inclusions in detrital and authigenic quartz grains, provide compelling evidence that the pyrobitumen was derived from a mobile (liquid hydrocarbon) precursor that circulated in the Carbon Leader Reef. Uranium, Au, Sb, Pb, Ag, <b>Te,</b> <b>Th,</b> Bi, Se and W are enriched relative to their concentrations in the shales. This is particularly the case for U and Au. The pervasive and relatively homogeneous distribution of the uranium is consistent with the presence of ubiquitous, submicroscopic uraninite in the pyrobitumen documented in an earlier study. In contrast, the distribution of the gold is heterogeneous, indicating the presence of irregularly distributed gold micrograins. These grains are concentrated mainly in the interstices between pyrobitumen nodules. Secondary minerals, such as brannerite, monazite-(Ce) and galena, are also concentrated in these interstices. On the basis of this study, we propose that intrabasinal shale units of the Witwatersrand Supergroup were the source for the pyrobitumen in the Carbon Leader Reef. These shales produced and released liquid hydrocarbons during the burial of the sedimentary succession. Phyllosilicates enriched in trace metals were transferred from the shales into the newly produced liquid hydrocarbons and were transported stratigraphically upward by the latter into the Carbon Leader Reef. During migration, the liquid hydrocarbons dissolved detrital uraninite present in the basin, adding to the uranium budget. The liquid hydrocarbons were converted into pyrobitumen in response to further burial, and precipitated uraninite nanocrystals. Post-depositional, hydrothermal fluids interacted with the hydrocarbons and deposited gold by reduction on hydrocarbon surfaces. The interaction of these fluids with the hydrocarbons may have released U, Th, REE, Pb and Ti from the hydrocarbons and triggered the formation of secondary brannerite, monazite-(Ce) and galena. The results of this study provide convincing evidence that the hydrocarbon liquids that formed the pyrobitumen seams in the Carbon Leader Reef played an essential role in the remobilization and redeposition of uranium and gold, respectively, in the Witwatersrand Supergroup...|$|E
40|$|The overall {{objective}} of this work {{is the development of}} a District Information System (DIS) which could be used by stakeholders for the purposes of a district day-to-day water management as well as for planning and strategic decisionmaking. The DIS was developed from a GIS-based modeling approach, which integrates a generic crop model and a hydraulic model of the transport/distribution system, using land use maps generated by Landsat TM imagery. The main sub-objectives are: (i) the development of an operational algorithm to retrieve crop evapotranspiration from remote sensing data, (ii) the development of an information system with friendly user interface for the data base, the crop module and the hydraulic module and (iii) the analysis and validation of management scenarios from model simulations predicting the respective behavior. The Lake Karla watershed is used in this study, but the overall methodology {{could be used as a}} basis for future analysis elsewhere. Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) was used to derive monthly actual evapotranspiration (ET) values from Landsat TM imagery. Meteorological data from the archives of the Institute for Research and Technology, Thessaly (I. RE. <b>TE.</b> <b>TH)</b> has also been used. The methodology was developed using high quality Landsat TM images during 2007 growing season. Monthly ET values are used as an input to CROPWAT model. Outputs of CROPWAT model are then used as input for WEAP model. The developed scenario is based on the actual situation of the surface irrigation network of the Local Administration of Land Reclamation (LALR) of Pinios for the year of 2007. The DIS is calibrated with observed data of this year and the district parameterization is conducted based on the actual operation of the network. The operation of the surface irrigation network of Pinios LALR is simulated using Technologismiki Works, while the operation of closed pipe irrigation network of Lake Karla LALR is simulated using Watercad. Four alternative scenarios have been tested with the DIS: • Reduction of channel losses • Alteration of irrigation methods • Introduction of greenhouse cultivation • Operation of the future Lake Karla network. The results of the simulation for the historical period indicate that the water pumped from Pinios LALR is not enough to serve irrigation requirements. The spatial and temporal variation of the unmet and unsatisfied water demand has been estimated. Simulation of the four alternative scenarios indicated that the alteration of irrigation methods scenario mainly increases the efficiency of the irrigation network. © 2015 Copyright SPIE...|$|E

While cotton is grown for many years and farmers gained extensive experience in its production, the study illustrates that acquired knowledge is not enough to increase cotton yields to the expected levels. Manevska-Tasevska ([2013]) found a negative relationship here and explained it by the fact that more experienced farmers were more resistant to new technologies and practices.

Na regi?o ocorrem arenitos finos, grossos a conglomer?ticos ferruginisados agrupados na Forma??o Serra do Tucano e diab?sio do Complexo Vulc?nico Apoteri, crostas vermiformes, protopisol?ticas, pisol?ticas, material concrecion?rio solto e solos argilosos e arenosos, constitu?dos basicamente de quartzo, goethita+hematita, caulinita, anat?sio/rutilo e gibbsita. A Si ? elevada no diab?sio, nos arenitos e solos, enquanto o Fe ? mais alto nas crostas e no concrecion?rio, enquanto o Al e Ti os s?o nos solos. Os ?lcalis e P est?o abaixo do limite de detec??o nos litotipos later?ticos.

Os ETR est?o mais concentrados no arenito conglomer?tico, na crosta pisol?tica, no concrecion?rio 2 e nos solos, onde h? ocorr?ncia de anomalias positivas de Ce/Ce* e suaves e negativas de Eu. No estudo isot?pico as raz?es do 207 Pb/ 206 Pb s?o elevadas no arenito conglomer?tico e solos argilosos e as raz?es do 208 Pb/ 206 Pb s?o mais altas no diab?sio, arenitos conglomer?tico e grosso, no concrecion?rio e nos solo argiloso. A geoqu?mica permitiu diferenciar tr?s associa??es que definem a assinatura dos litotipos: 1) Fe e PF representando as crostas; 2) P, Ba, Co, Mn, V e Zn representam o diab?sio, e a 3) Al, Si, Ti Cs, Hf, Nb, Ta, Y Zr e ETR representando os solos. As crostas later?ticas encontradas na regi?o da Serra do Tucano possivelmente tiveram seu desenvolvimento ap?s o Mioceno, com individualiza??o dos f?cies vermiforme, protopisol?tico e pisol?tico ao longo do Quatern?rio, em condi??es similares ao clima atual. The {{objective of}} this dissertation {{was to investigate the}} genesis and evolution of the lateritic lithotypes, resulting from the weathering in savannah areas in the region of Tucano ridge. The structural and textual characteristics were studied and the mineralogy, the chemical composition of the chemical elements Al, Ca, Si, Fe, K, Mg, Na, P, Ti, PF, trace elements (As, Au, B, Ba, Be, Bi, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Cs, Ga, Ge, Hf, Hg, Li, Mn, Mo, Nb, Ni, Pb, Pd, Rb, Re, Sb, S, Se,Sc, Sn, Sr, Ta, <b>Te,</b> <b>Th,</b> Tl, U, V, W, Y, Zn, Zr and ETR) and Pb isotopes was analyzed. In the region there are from thin, thick sandstones to rusty conglomeratic (Fe oxidation), vermiform crusts, protopisolitic, pisolitic, loosed concretionary material and clay and sandy soils consisting primarily of quartz, goethite-hematite, kaolinite, anatase, rutile and gibbsite. In the southwestern (SW) of Tucano ridge there is Redondo Hill constituted of diabase. The Si is high in the diabase, in the sandstones and in the soils while Fe is higher in the crusts and in the concretionary whereas Al and Ti are high in the soils. The alkalis and P are below the limit of the lateritic lithotypes detection and they are higher in the diabase. The Ba, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Rb, Sc, Sr, W and Zn are more concentrated in the diabase. The Ag, As, Au, Bi, Ga, Hg, Sb, Se, Sn, Pb, Tl, Th and V are in the crusts and concretionary. The Hf, Nb and Zr are in the soils and the Mn in the conglomeratic and thick sandstones, in the pisolitic crust, in the concretionary and in the clay soils. The REE are more concentrated in the conglomeratic sandstone, in the pisolitic crust, in the concretionary 2 and in the soils where there are positive anomalies of Ce/Ce* and soft and negative ones of Eu. In the isotopic studies, higher rations of 207 Pb/ 206 Pb in the sandstones conglomeratic and clay soils and the rations of 208 Pb/ 206 Pb are higher especially in the diabase, in the thick sandstones to rusty conglomeratic, in the concretionary and in the clay soils. No estudo isot?pico as raz?es do 207 Pb/ 206 Pb s?o elevadas no arenito conglomer?tico e solos argilosos e as raz?es do 208 Pb/ 206 Pb s?o mais altas no diab?sio, arenitos conglomer?tico e grosso, no concrecion?rio e nos solo argiloso. The geochemistry allowed three associations that define the lithotypes signatures: 1) Fe and PF representing the crusts; 2) P, Ba, Co, Mn, V and Zn represent the diabase; and the 3) Al, Si, Ti, Cs, Hf, Nb, Ta, Y, Zr and REE represent the soils. The lateritic crusts found in the region of Tucano ridge possibly had their development after the Miocene, with the individualization of the vermiform facies, protopisolitic and pisolitic towards the quaternary in similar conditions to the present climate...|$|E

Fauchais, University of Limoges, Limoges Cedex, France; J. van der Mullen, University of Eindhoven, Eindhoven, the Netherlands; J. Heberlein, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MinnesotaThe multi-temperature Gibbs {{free energy}} {{minimization}} (GFEM) method {{has been compared}} to the Pseudo Kinetic Method (PKM) to calculate the composition of a nitrogen plasma at atmospheric pressure. When introducing only two temperatures <b>Te</b> and <b>Th</b> with their ratio e = 2, the GFEM method overestimates by more than two orders of magnitude the density of N 2 +. However when calculating the kinetic rate coefficient at different temperatures the thermodynamic relationship between them and the equilibrium constant is no more fulfilled. That is why an intermediate temperature T* between <b>Te</b> and <b>Th</b> has been introduced linked to the ratio of the electrons flux to that of neutrals and e has been assumed to vary with the electron density ne, equilibrium (e = 1) being achieved either for nemax = 1022 or 1023 m- 3. With nemax = 1022 m- 3 the agreement between the results obtained with the PKM and the GFEM method is fairly good. That is why this latter method has been used to calculate the composition of complex mixtures of Ar-CCl 4 and Ar-H 2 -CCl 4. Below 6000 K where complex molecules exist the variation of e between 2. 5 and 1. 5 does not affect very much the composition which, however, depends strongly on v (v = Tv/Th...|$|R

In the non-uniform case a momentum relaxation occurs as well. In view of such an application, a new model, based on an asymptotic procedure for solving the generalized kinetic equations of carriers and phonons is proposed, which gives naturally the displaced Maxwellian at the leading order. After that, balance equations for the electron number, hole number, energy densities, and momentum densities are constructed, which constitute now a system of five equations for the electron chemical potential, the temperatures and the drift velocities.

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this study}} is to check if it is {{possible}} to use the combined diffusion coefficients introduced by Murphy at equilibrium in a two-temperature model (electron temperature Te different from that of heavy species Th) such as that defined by Devoto or Bonnefoi for transport properties. Murphy's coefficients describe the diffusive mixing of two non reactive ionized gases while the Devoto's or Bonnefoi's simplified theories allow the calculation of transport coefficients (except diffusion) out of thermal equilibrium. It has to be noticed that in the latter case when <b>Te</b> tends towards <b>Th,</b> the results are those obtained with an equilibrium calculation. The two-temperature (2 -T) theory of transport properties was established by separating electrons and other species because of their mass difference. First, the exact combined diffusion coefficients of Murphy are calculated for an Ar-N 2 (50 wt%) mixture at atmospheric pressure. Then, expressions of combined diffusion coefficients are obtained using the simplified theory of Bonnefoi. The results of the calculation of combined diffusion coefficients from the simplified theory of transport properties, assuming equilibrium is achieved (<b>Te</b> = <b>Th),</b> is compared with those of Murphy at equilibrium. It is shown that large discrepancies occur when ionization is important. These results prove that the simplified 2 -T theory cannot be used for the treatment of diffusion. Thus, a new theory of transport coefficients has to be developed taking into account the coupling of electrons and heavy species and work is in progress...|$|R

The SF 6 arc plasma in decaying phase can be seen in a high voltage SF 6 gas circuit breaker during a large current interruption process. The TRV is often applied to the arc plasma, which may elevate the electron temperature Te than heavy particle temperature Th. This developed model solves energy equations for electrons and heavy particles, accounting for totally 122 reactions due to 19 species in SF 6 arc plasmas.
