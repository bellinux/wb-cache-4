The delay from neckbite to <b>thrusting,</b> the <b>thrusting</b> <b>phase</b> and the jerking phase were shorter in homosexual than heterosexual mountings, which may relate to the absence of penile intromission and ejaculation. Female koalas exhibited characteristic oestrous and rejection vocalisations that may attract partners or result in them being rejected. The female post-mating calls and calls outside oestrus were longest, followed by female oestrous bellows and male calls, with female rejection calls being the shortest. Rejection calls were higher frequency than the oestrous calls, in particular rejection of a female. Following separation of bellow acoustics into a grunt and a shorter inhalation component, female bellows could be successfully discriminated from male bellows for 64 % of the grunt phases, and 71 % of the inhalation phases (P < 0. 001). Most of the variation between individuals was in the duration, rather than the harmonic range, starting or mean frequency, which were similar for both homosexual and heterosexual copulations. It is concluded that homosexual and heterosexual interactions in female koalas contain the same behavioural components, and similar accompanying vocalisations, although the duration of the different components is specific to the gender and stage of copulation.

40|$|Synopsis Locomotion in {{a complex}} {{environment}} is often not steady, but the mechanisms used by animals to power and control unsteady locomotion (stability and maneuverability) are not well understood. We use behavioral, morphological, and impulsive perturbations to determine the compensations used during unsteady locomotion. At the level both of the whole-body and of joints, quasi-stiffness models are useful for describing adjustments to the functioning of legs and joints during maneuvers. However, alterations to the mechanics of legs and joints often are distinct for different phases of the step cycle or for specific joints. For example, negotiating steps involves independent changes of leg stiffness during compression and <b>thrust</b> <b>phases</b> of stance. Unsteady locomotion also involves parameters that {{are not part of}} the simplest reduced-parameter models of locomotion (e. g., the spring-loaded inverted pendulum) such as moments of the hip joint. Extensive coupling among translational and rotational parameters must be taken into account to stabilize locomotion or maneuver. For example, maneuvers with morphological perturbations (increased rotational inertial turns) involve changes to several aspects of movement, including the initial conditions of rotation and ground-reaction forces. Coupled changes to several parameters may be employed to control maneuvers on a trial-by-trial basis. Compensating for increased rotational inertia of the body during turns is facilitated by the opposing effects of several mechanical and behavioral parameters. However, the specific rules used by animals to control translation and rotation of the body to maintain stability or maneuver have not been fully characterized.

50|$|Swimming mammals, such as whales, dolphins,and sea lions, {{use their}} {{flippers}} {{to move forward}} through the water column. During swimming sea lions have a <b>thrust</b> <b>phase,</b> which lasts about 60% of the full cycle, and the recovery phase lasts the remaining 40%. A full cycle duration lasts about 0.5 to 1.0 seconds. Changing direction is a very rapid maneuver that is initiated by head movement towards {{the back of the}} animal that is followed by a spiral turn with the body. Due to their pectoral flippers being so closely located to their center of gravity, sea lions are capable of displaying astounding maneuverability in the pitch, roll, and yaw direction and are therefore not constrained, turning stochastically as they please. It is hypothesized that the increased level of maneuverability is caused by their complex habitat. Hunting occurs in difficult environments containing rocky inshore/kelp forest communities, with many niches for prey to hide, therefore requiring speed and maneuverability for capture. The complex skills of a sea lion are learned early on in ontogeny and most are perfected by the time the pups reach one year. Whales and dolphins are less maneuverable and more constrained in their movements. However, dolphins are capable of accelerating as fast as sea lions, but they are not capable of turning as quickly and as efficiently. For both whales and dolphins, their center of gravity does not line up with their pectoral flippers in a straight line, causing a much more rigid and stable swimming pattern.|$|E
50|$|Early models {{describing}} the kinematics {{of an individual}} target joint during the various phases of manipulation (notably Sandoz 1976) were based on studies that investigated joint cracking in MCP joints. The cracking was elicited by pulling the proximal phalanx away from the metacarpal bone (to separate, or 'gap' the articular surfaces of the MCP joint) with gradually increasing force until a sharp resistance, caused by the cohesive properties of synovial fluid, was met and then broken. These studies were therefore never designed to form models of therapeutic manipulation, and the models formed were erroneous in that they described the target joint as being configured at the end range of a rotation movement, during the orientation phase. The model then predicted that this end range position was maintained during the prethrust phase until the <b>thrust</b> <b>phase</b> where it was moved beyond the 'physiologic barrier' created by synovial fluid resistance; conveniently {{within the limits of}} anatomical integrity provided by restraining tissues such as the joint capsule and ligaments. This model still dominates the literature. However, after re-examining the original studies on which the kinematic models of joint manipulation were based, Evans and Breen argued that the optimal prethrust position is actually the equivalent of the neutral zone of the individual joint, which is the motion region of the joint where the passive osteoligamentous stability mechanisms exert little or no influence. This new model predicted that the physiologic barrier is only confronted when the articular surfaces of the joint are separated (gapped, rather than the rolling or sliding that usually occurs during physiological motion), and that it is more mechanically efficient to do this when the joint is near to its neutral configuration.|$|E

40|$|The Tertiary Piedmont Basin (TPB) {{stretches}} {{along the}} Piedmont-Liguria border {{and is a}} late- to post-orogenic basin that evolved in a piggy-back position on the Monferrato thrust belt. Its depositional story is strongly controlled by tectonic and eustatic events. The basin was filled with mainly marine sediments (upper Eocene-upper Miocene), which unconformably overlie the Ligurian Alps and the Northern Apennines. The early stage of sedimentation of TPB records a transgressive phase (time-transgressive from the eastern to the western sectors, upper Eocene-upper Oligocene), characterized by the deposition of alluvial fan and fan delta siliciclastic conglomerates and sandstones, marine shallow-water coarse to fine grained siliciclastic sediments, and reef limestones. The TPB reefal buildups, which developed close to the paleoshoreline, have a lower Rupelian-middle Chattian stratigraphic distribution and are restricted to {{the central part of}} the southern margin of the TPB. The Valzemola-San Bernardino reef is the younger and the westernmost settlement, while the Val Lemme reef represents the older and easternmost one. The depicted stratigraphic and geographic distribution may be the result of a combined climatic and tectonic control. The lack of reef settlements west of Valzemola-Bric S. Bernardino may be due to climatic condition unfavourable for the reef development (temperature cooler than those of the early Rupelian-middle Chattian time interval). The absence of reefs in the area to the east of Val Lemme may be the consequence of bottom instability and high sedimentation rates (unfavourable conditions for the reef development) caused by the syn-sedimentary tectonic activity along the Scrivia fault, during the time interval spanning from the late Eocene to the early Oligocene (notwithstanding the favourable climatic conditions).

According to some rumors, in flight, the missile follows a quasi-ballistic path, performing evasive maneuvers in the terminal phase of flight and releasing decoys in order to penetrate missile defense systems. The missile never leaves the atmosphere as it follows a relatively flat trajectory. The missile is controlled during the whole flight with gas-dynamic and aerodynamic control surfaces. It uses small fins to reduce its radar signature.|$|R
