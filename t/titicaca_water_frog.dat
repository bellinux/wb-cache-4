5|$|The lungs in {{amphibians}} are primitive {{compared to}} those of amniotes, possessing few internal septa and large alveoli, and consequently having a comparatively slow diffusion rate for oxygen entering the blood. Ventilation is accomplished by buccal pumping. Most amphibians, however, are able to exchange gases with the water or air via their skin. To enable sufficient cutaneous respiration, the surface of their highly vascularised skin must remain moist to allow the oxygen to diffuse at a sufficiently high rate. Because oxygen concentration in the water increases at both low temperatures and high flow rates, aquatic amphibians in these situations can rely primarily on cutaneous respiration, as in the <b>Titicaca</b> <b>water</b> <b>frog</b> and the hellbender salamander. In air, where oxygen is more concentrated, some small species can rely solely on cutaneous gas exchange, most famously the plethodontid salamanders, which have neither lungs nor gills. Many aquatic salamanders and all tadpoles have gills in their larval stage, with some (such as the axolotl) retaining gills as aquatic adults.|$|E
500|$|Some {{species of}} frog have adaptations {{that allow them}} to survive in oxygen {{deficient}} water. The <b>Titicaca</b> <b>water</b> <b>frog</b> (Telmatobius culeus) is one such species and has [...] wrinkly skin that increases its surface area to enhance gas exchange. It normally makes no use of its rudimentary lungs but will sometimes raise and lower its body rhythmically while on the lake bed to increase the flow of water around it.|$|E
50|$|Once common, the <b>Titicaca</b> <b>water</b> <b>frog</b> has {{declined}} drastically {{and is now}} facing extinction due to over-collecting for human consumption, pollution, and predation of tadpoles by introduced trout. It may also be threatened by the disease chytridiomycosis. It is estimated that it {{has declined}} by more than 80% {{in the last three}} <b>Titicaca</b> <b>water</b> <b>frog</b> generations, equalling 15 years. Several other species in the genus Telmatobius are facing similar risks.|$|E
50|$|In {{the last}} few years, mass deaths have {{occurred}} several times. In April 2015, thousands of dead <b>Titicaca</b> <b>water</b> <b>frogs</b> were found in Bolivia {{on the shore of}} Lake Titicaca and in October 2016 an estimated 10,000 were found dead in the Coata River (a Lake Titicaca tributary). At least in the latter case, scientists believe pollution killed the frogs.|$|R

5000|$|... #Caption: There are two Telmatobius {{species in}} the lake: The smaller, more coastal marbled water frog (pictured, at Isla del Sol) and the larger, more deep-water <b>Titicaca</b> <b>water</b> <b>frog.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Titicaca</b> <b>water</b> <b>frog</b> spends {{its entire}} life in {{oxygen-rich}} water that typically is 10 - 17 C. It mainly stays {{near the bottom}} {{and it does not}} surface to breathe if the water is well-oxygenated. It regularly performs [...] "push-ups" [...] to allow water to pass by its large skin folds, which absorb oxygen. It occurs even in deeper parts of Lake Titicaca, although the limit is unknown. The <b>Titicaca</b> <b>water</b> <b>frog</b> feeds on amphipods, insects, snails, tadpoles and fish (including Orestias). It has an extremely low metabolic rate; below that of all other frogs. Breeding is in shallow, coastal water where the female lays about 500 eggs.|$|E
50|$|Some {{amphibians}} utilizing cutaneous respiration {{have extensive}} folds of skin {{to increase the}} rate of respiration. Examples include the hellbender salamander and the Lake <b>Titicaca</b> <b>water</b> <b>frog.</b> Cutaneous respiration in hellbenders {{accounts for more than}} 90 percent of oxygen uptake and carbon dioxide excretion.|$|E

Earlier attempts of captive breeding were unsuccesful, but projects started in 2010 have succeeded in breeding the species at facilities in both Cochabamba (Bolivia) and Lima (Peru). In 2016, the project was expanded when a group of Titicaca water frogs was sent to Denver Zoo in the United States. Captives have lived for up to 20 years.|$|E
50|$|Lake Titicaca hosts several endemics, {{among them}} the highly {{endangered}} Titicaca flightless grebe and <b>Titicaca</b> <b>water</b> <b>frog.</b> A few species of hummingbirds, notably some hillstars, {{can be seen at}} altitudes above 4000 m, but far higher diversities can be found at lower altitudes, especially in the humid Andean forests ("cloud forests") growing on slopes in Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia and far northwestern Argentina. These forest-types, which includes the Yungas and parts of the Choc√≥, are very rich in flora and fauna, although few large mammals exist, exceptions being the threatened mountain tapir, spectacled bear and yellow-tailed woolly monkey.|$|E
50|$|Titicaca is {{the largest}} Andean lake and Junin {{is the largest}} lake fully within Peru. Each host several {{threatened}} endemics, including grebes (Titicaca flightless grebe and Junin grebe), giant aquatic frogs (<b>Titicaca</b> <b>water</b> <b>frog</b> and Lake Junin frog) and Orestias fish. Although the foothill and lower mountain rivers and streams are relatively rich in fish, few {{are found in the}} highest, which generally are dominated by a few genera of catfish, notably Astroblepus and Trichomycterus. There are few larger Andean crustacean, but the unusual aeglids occur up to 3500 m in Argentina, Bolivia and Chile. In addition to pollution and habitat loss, smaller aquatic natives in the Andes are often threatened by introduced, non-native trout.|$|E

50|$|All Telmatobius {{species are}} closely {{associated}} with water and most species are semi-aquatic, while a few are entirely aquatic. They are found in and near lakes, rivers and wetlands in the Andean highlands at altitudes between 1000 and(-) 5200 m. The genus includes two of the world's largest fully aquatic frogs, the Lake Junin frog (T. macrostomus) and <b>Titicaca</b> <b>water</b> <b>frog</b> (T. culeus), but the remaining are considerably smaller. Telmatobius contains more than 60 species; the vast majority seriously threatened, especially from habitat loss, pollution, diseases (chytridiomycosis and nematode infections), introduced trout, and capture for human consumption. The three Ecuadorian species have not been seen for years and may already be extinct: T. cirrhacelis last seen in 1981, T. niger in 1994 and T. vellardi in 1987.|$|E
50|$|Telmatobius gigas is a {{critically}} endangered species of frog in the Telmatobiidae family. It is endemic to the Huayllamarca River {{at an altitude}} of about 4000 m in the Carangas Province in Bolivia. Its tiny range makes it highly vulnerable to pollution, and it may also be threatened by over-harvesting for medicinal use and the disease chytridiomycosis. As suggested by its scientific name, this is a very large species of frog with a snout-vent length of up to 10.9 cm in females (males are smaller). In the genus Telmatobius, only two other threatened species, the <b>Titicaca</b> <b>water</b> <b>frog</b> (T. culeus) and Lake Junin frog (T. macrostomus), are larger. T. gigas is very closely related to the smaller and more widespread T. marmoratus, and they might be conspecific.|$|E

40|$|The recent genetic {{screening}} of <b>water</b> <b>frogs</b> (genus Pelophylax) in Belgium {{has shown that}} the invasion of two <b>water</b> <b>frog</b> species from Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean region, P. ridibundus and P. cf. bedriagae is widespread. Possibly other exotic <b>water</b> <b>frogs</b> are invading and establishing themselves through commercial trade. We used a genetic identification approach to rapidly detect and identify morphologically cryptic exotic <b>water</b> <b>frog</b> species in a large number of populations throughout the northern part of Belgium. Among a total of 944 individuals, we found 506 non-indigenous specimens, seven of which belonged to species not recorded before with certainty in Belgium or neighbouring regions in the wild. One of them was identified genetically as the Iberian green frog (P. perezi), but was most likely a P. perezi x P. esculentus hybrid. Six individuals of the Levantine frog (P. bedriagae) were found in a pond in the vicinity of a pet shop where the species is sold. All other exotic frogs belonged to four different haplotypes of P. ridibundus, established in Belgium since c. 1970, and two haplotypes of P. cf. bedriagae, a poorly-known eastern Mediterranean sister species of the latter. Overall, our study underscores the extent of exotic <b>water</b> <b>frog</b> invasions associated with the pet trade. Although two of the exotic species were recorded in small numbers, their early detection is essential with regards to adequate control and eradication of invasive species. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The western Palaearctic <b>water</b> <b>frogs</b> in {{the genus}} Pelophylax {{comprise}} several distinct species and three hybridogenetic hybrid forms. In this study, {{we focus on}} the Pelophylax esculentus complex, which consists of two sexual species, Pelophylax ridibundus and Pelophylax lessonae, and their hybridogenetic hybrid, Pelophylax esculentus. Specifically, we investigated taxonomic composition and ploidy level of <b>water</b> <b>frogs</b> sampled in three different types of wetland habitats in the Hortobagy National Park (HNP), eastern Hungary. Using variation in serum albumin intron 1 (SAI- 1) and 15 microsatellite loci, we detected the presence of all members of the P. esculentus complex in the studied localities. In one locality, all three taxa occurred syntopically, while in others <b>water</b> <b>frog</b> populations consisted of P. ridibundus and P. esculentus exclusively. The genomic composition of the 63 examined hybrid specimens analysed with microsatellites showed the occurrence of diploid genotypes only. We used a population genetic approach (allelic richness, gene diversity, multilocus genotypes and multilocus disequilibrium) to infer the breeding system of <b>water</b> <b>frogs</b> at HNP. Our data indicate that at least in two populations, hybrids form gametes with clonally transmitted P. ridibundus genome and produce a new hybrid generation by mating with P. lessonae...|$|R
50|$|The lake holds large {{populations of}} water birds and was {{designated}} as a Ramsar Site on August 26, 1998. Several threatened species such as the huge <b>Titicaca</b> <b>water</b> <b>frog</b> and the flightless Titicaca grebe are largely or entirely restricted to the lake, and the Titicaca orestias has likely become extinct (last seen in 1938) due to competition and predation by the introduced rainbow trout and the silverside Odontesthes bonariensis. In addition to the Titicaca orestias, native fish species in the lake's basin are other species of Orestias, and the catfish Trichomycterus dispar, T. rivulatus and Astroblepus stuebeli (the last species not in the lake itself, but in associated ecosystems). The many Orestias species in Lake Titicaca differ significantly in both habitat preference and feeding behavior. About 90% of the fish species in the basin are endemic, including 23 species of Orestias that only {{are found in the}} lake. In addition to the threatened Titicaca grebe, some of the birds associated with water at Titicaca are the white-tufted grebe, Puna ibis, Chilean flamingo, Andean gull, Andean lapwing, white-backed stilt, greater yellowlegs, snowy egret, black-crowned night-heron, Andean coot, common gallinule, plumbeous rail, various ducks, wren-like rushbird, many-colored rush-tyrant and yellow-winged blackbird.|$|E
