5|$|For 2006, Pescarolo {{were the}} only team to run the C60 in the newly-renamed Le Mans Series (LMS). Collard and Boullion started the season {{in exactly the same}} way they had {{finished}} the previous one, by winning the 1000km of Istanbul in the Pescarolo C60 Hybrid. The 1000km of Spa saw Collard and Boullion win again, despite starting the race from the pitlane after a crash in free practice. At the 24 Hours of Le Mans, Pescarolo entered two C60s, as usual; one driven by Hélary, Loeb and Franck Montagny, whilst the other was driven by Collard, Minassian and Comas. The Montagny/Hélary/Loeb car took second overall, beating one of the brand-new Audi R10 TDIs, whilst <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>car</b> finished fifth overall, and fourth in the LMP1 category. Having returned to the LMS, Collard and Boullion were joined by Hélary for the 1000km of Nürburgring, and the trio took another win for Pescarolo. Didier André replaced Hélary in the final two rounds, which were the 1000 km of Donington and 1000 km of Jarama, and Pescarolo won both races to complete a clean sweep. As a result, Pescarolo retained the LMP1 team's championship with the maximum score possible. The C60 was made obsolete by the new LMP1 regulations for 2007, and thus was retired, and replaced by the Pescarolo 01.|$|E
5|$|The video {{starts with}} Jason Wade in the driver's {{seat of a}} car, with {{the other members of}} Lifehouse in the car with him. The traffic is at a stand still in a tunnel, as a swarm of people have {{abandoned}} their vehicles and are walking through. Wade and the band members get out of the car, and begin walking in the opposite direction of the crowd {{to the other side of}} the tunnel. Wade pushes through the people, who are in a rush to get to the entrance of the tunnel and is constantly focused on his destination to get to the end. When he reaches the tunnel's end, he sees the wreckage of a car crash with firefighters and paramedics cleaning up the mess. Wade then sees a girl observing what appears to be herself, dead inside one of the crashed car. He then looks to the left, and sees an old man observing himself, dead on the ground. As Wade looks into <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>car,</b> he sees himself, also seemingly dead. Upon this, Wade frantically runs back into the tunnel towards his car. Then he sees himself in the car with the band members, however everyone seems to be frozen as he bangs on the windows. Suddenly Wade is inside the car again, and a police officer comes to the window, motioning him to continue driving, since he is stopped in the middle of the tunnel for no apparent reason.|$|E
25|$|On December 20, 2004, Abdul {{was driving}} her Mercedes on a Los Angeles-area freeway when she changed lanes and hit another vehicle. The driver and {{passenger}} took a photograph with {{a cell phone}} camera and wrote down the license plate number of the car, which was traced to Abdul. On March 24, 2005, Abdul was fined US$900 and given 24 months of informal probation after pleading no contest to misdemeanor hit-and-run driving. She was ordered to pay US$775 for damage to <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>car.</b>|$|E

25|$|Following the cars' {{export to}} America, the KZR-1s made their first {{appearance}} {{under the new}} name at the 24 Hours of Daytona; Lupberger and Toivonen were partnered by T. J. Bell in the A410-001 chassis, whilst Collins, Zwart and Vann drove the A410-002 chassis, which was also fitted with a BMW 4-litre V8 engine. Neither car had a successful race; the A410-001 was classified 38th overall, and ninth in the SRP class, but retired due to a blown engine after 15 hours and 429 laps, whilst <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>car</b> was classified 70th, and 16th in class, due to electrical issues after six hours and 116 laps. For the 12 Hours of Sebring, Kristian Kolby replaced Toivonen, and Justin Wilson replaced Zwart, and the team were a little more successful; Collins, Vann and Wilson finished sixth overall, whilst <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>car</b> was brought home in 29th overall, and tenth in class. For the 24 Hours of Le Mans, Team Ascari were only allowed to enter one KZR-1, selecting Lupberger, Collins and Bell to drive it; however, an accident caused by suspension failure after an hour, and 17 laps, forced the team to retire. Team Ascari's last entry of the season came at the Cadillac Grand Prix, but neither car competed in the race. Team Ascari were classified tenth in the ALMS Team's Championship, with 19 points.|$|E
25|$|The {{technology}} of the Montmartre line differs from conventional funicular railways {{in that it is}} derived from that of standard up-down elevators, with each car being equipped with its own counterweight, rather than relying on <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>car</b> for counterbalance. The benefit of this design is that it allows each car to function independently, with its own hoist and cables. This allows one car to remain in service if the other must be taken out of service for maintenance. At busy times, both cabins can ascend at the same time (usually, more passengers use the funicular to ascend than to descend).|$|E
25|$|On 24 March 1984, Bolte was {{involved}} in a serious head-on accident when he was driving home after an evening in the local hotel near his property at Bamganie. Bolte and the occupants of <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>car</b> were taken to the Ballarat Base Hospital, where blood samples were taken to test for alcohol levels. Whilst {{there was no evidence of}} alcohol in the blood of the other driver involved, there were indications of an alcohol content in excess of 0.05% in Bolte's blood. Subsequently, further samples were collected from the hospital by the police, but these were found to have been substituted, and the sample box containing them had been unlocked by an unknown person. An enquiry found that it would have been unfair to proceed with prosecution because of interference with the evidence.|$|E

25|$|Earlier in the season, Sue Ellen gets drunk {{after having}} seen J.R. {{in bed with}} Holly Harwood. She gets into a car and Ray Krebbs' cousin Mickey Trotter tries to stop her and they are {{involved}} in an accident, in a car belonging to J.R., just outside Southfork. Sue Ellen emerges with nothing worse than bruises, but Mickey is paralyzed from the neck down and in a coma. In the final episode of the season, Ray finds out that the driver of <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>car</b> was Walt Driscoll, J.R.'s rival. He also learns that Driscoll deliberately caused the accident, thinking that J.R. was driving, as a means of revenge for being put in jail by J.R. earlier in the year. An angered Ray comes to Southfork late at night demanding answers from J.R., who was not expecting to see him. J.R. asks him what is going on and Ray says he's going to kill J.R. for what happened. J.R. throws a candle holder at Ray, which misses him and knocks over another candle holder with lit candles in it. As the two brawl, the candles ignite a fire and the smoke starts to creep into both John Ross and Sue Ellen's bedrooms as they sleep. Sue Ellen had been given a sedative by the doctor earlier in the day so she doesn't wake up. J.R. notices the fire and tries to break free of Ray, finally knocking him out with a telephone, and runs upstairs to try to save his wife and son. Ray recovers and runs after J.R. but is consumed by smoke and falls. J.R. is hit with a falling beam as he gets upstairs and both men are unconscious as Southfork burns.|$|E

500|$|Following {{completion}} of the two Howmet TXs, the cars {{were brought to the}} 24 Hours of Daytona, the opening round of the 1968 International Championship for Makes. Before even entering competition the TX earned attention, and was featured prominently {{on the cover of the}} race program. [...] Although both cars were in attendance, only the newer (#GTP2) of the two was entered in the race; <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>car</b> (#GTP1) was kept as a spare. The driving team of Heppenstall, Dick Thompson, and Ed Lowther qualified with a lap time seventh fastest overall. Several competitors made early refueling stops allowing the Howmet to improve to third place but on lap 34 the turbine wastegate failed to reopen, giving the driver too much power for the corner he was in.

500|$|While in Edmonton, {{she became}} {{close to the}} Brownlee family. [...] On July5, 1933, {{while the rest of}} his family was vacationing at Sylvan Lake, Brownlee was taking MacMillan for a car ride when he noticed they were being followed. [...] In the {{pursuing}} vehicle were John Caldwell, a suitor of MacMillan's and third-year medical student at the University of Alberta, and Neil MacLean, a prominent Edmonton lawyer and Liberal Party supporter who had been opposing counsel in the acrimonious and high profile divorce proceeding of Brownlee's Minister of Public Works, Oran McPherson. [...] Brownlee made a series of sharp turns and reversals, in an effort to first ascertain whether he was indeed being followed and, once satisfied that he was, to evade <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>car.</b> [...] Unable to do so, he dropped MacMillan off at her home and returned to his.|$|E
500|$|Writing for a {{majority}} of the Court, Justice Clarence Thomas held that the 911 call contained sufficient indicia of reliability to justify the traffic stop. Although he acknowledged that this was a [...] "close case", Justice Thomas concluded that indicia of the 911 caller's reliability were stronger than those in Florida v. J.L., where the Court held a [...] "bare-bones" [...] tip was unreliable. Justice Thomas began his opinion by emphasizing that the Supreme Court had [...] "firmly rejected the argument that reasonable cause for an investigative stop can only be based on the officer’s personal observation, rather than on information supplied by another person.” By identifying the make, model, and license plate number of the pickup truck, Justice Thomas argued that [...] "the caller necessarily claimed eyewitness knowledge of the alleged dangerous driving," [...] and that basis of knowledge supported the tip's reliability. Furthermore, Justice Thomas concluded that [...] " [...] driver’s claim that another vehicle ran her off the road, however, necessarily implies that the informant knows <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>car</b> was driven dangerously." [...] Justice Thomas also noted that the calls made through the 911 emergency system are particularly reliable, because calls are recorded and individuals may face prosecution for making false reports.|$|E
500|$|Manor Marussia's Alexander Rossi {{was delighted}} with his result in twelfth, {{feeling that it}} could be [...] "the start of great things", after he had equalled the team's best result of the season. Daniel Ricciardo called for the FIA to clear up the {{regulations}} of the virtual safety car, following him being overtaken easily at the first restart by Nico Rosberg, saying that he had not gotten a warning {{about the end of the}} period. Kimi Räikkönen was equally displeased, complaining about the rules concerning driving standards. Following his on-track battle with Max Verstappen, he demanded clarification on whether Verstappen's aggressive driving style was legal, saying: [...] "I just wanted to ask if it's OK when you are next to another car, at some point on the exit of the corner are you allowed to always push <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>car</b> up on the kerbs [...] Apparently it's fine. As long as everybody has the same rules that's OK." [...] Concerning the collision between Nico Hülkenberg and Ricciardo, Force India revealed that damage to Hülkenberg's front wing had caused him to lose downforce and slide into the Red Bull. Following the turn one collision between their two drivers, Sauber's team principal Monisha Kaltenborn announced that she intended to [...] "have a word" [...] with her drivers, saying: [...] "The bottom line of this is that these kind of things simply must not happen. It is OK if you have decent and healthy competition which they do – both drivers are respectful to each other. [...] I'm upset. These mistakes shouldn't happen. We are much better than this." ...|$|E

2500|$|However, {{if there}} is an accident, a yellow caution flag is raised. [...] This means neither of the race cars is {{permitted}} to overtake and pass <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>car.</b> [...] The two race cars represent the input and output frequency of the PLL in a locked state. [...] Each driver will measure the phase difference (a distance in laps) between himself and the other race car. [...] If the hind driver is far away, he will increase his speed to close the gap. If he's too close to <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>car</b> he will slow down. The result is that both race cars will circle the track in lockstep with minimum phase difference between them. [...] Since neither car is allowed to lap the other, the cars make the same number of laps in a given time period. [...] Therefore the frequency of the two signals is the same.|$|E
