5|$|In <b>telecommunication</b> <b>networks,</b> {{heterodyning}} {{is used to}} move {{frequencies of}} individual signals to different channels which may share a single physical transmission line. This is called frequency division multiplexing (FDM). For example, a coaxial cable used by a cable television system can carry 500 television channels {{at the same time}} because each one is given a different frequency, so they don't interfere with one another. Continuous wave (CW) doppler radar detectors are basically heterodyne detection devices that compare transmitted and reflected beams.|$|E
5|$|Telecommunications {{in which}} {{multiple}} transmitters and multiple receivers {{have been designed}} to cooperate and to share the same physical channel are called multiplex systems. The sharing of physical channels using multiplexing often gives very large reductions in costs. Multiplexed systems are laid out in <b>telecommunication</b> <b>networks,</b> and the multiplexed signals are switched at nodes through to the correct destination terminal receiver.|$|E
5|$|It is {{estimated}} that the 51% of the information flowing through two-way telecommunications networks in the year 2000 were flowing through the Internet (most of the rest (42%) through the landline telephone). By the year 2007 the Internet clearly dominated and captured 97% of all the information in <b>telecommunication</b> <b>networks</b> (most of the rest (2%) through mobile phones). , an estimated 21.9% of the world population {{has access to the}} Internet with the highest access rates (measured {{as a percentage of the}} population) in North America (73.6%), Oceania/Australia (59.5%) and Europe (48.1%). In terms of broadband access, Iceland (26.7%), South Korea (25.4%) and the Netherlands (25.3%) led the world.|$|E

5|$|The {{effective}} capacity to exchange information worldwide through two-way <b>telecommunication</b> <b>networks</b> grew from 281 petabytes of (optimally compressed) information in 1986, to 471 petabytes in 1993, to 2.2 (optimally compressed) exabytes in 2000, and to 65 (optimally compressed) exabytes in 2007. This is the informational equivalent of two newspaper pages {{per person per}} day in 1986, and six entire newspapers {{per person per day}} by 2007. Given this growth, telecommunications play an increasingly important role in the world economy and the global telecommunications industry was about a $4.7 trillion sector in 2012. The service revenue of the global telecommunications industry was estimated to be $1.5 trillion in 2010, corresponding to 2.4% of the world’s gross domestic product (GDP).|$|E
5|$|During flight, the {{aircraft}} maintains a datalink with a satellite communication network for data and telephone calls. The datalink connects {{the aircraft}} and a ground station via satellite, which translates (changes) the signal's frequency and amplifies the signal; the ground station {{is connected to}} <b>telecommunication</b> <b>networks</b> which allows messages {{to be sent to}} and received from other locations, such as the airline's operations centre. Normal communications from Flight370 were last made at 1:07MYT and the datalink between the aircraft and satellite telecommunication network was lost at some point between 1:07 and 2:03, when the aircraft did not acknowledge a message sent from the ground station. Three minutes after the aircraft left the range of radar coverage—at 2:25—the aircraft's satellite data unit (SDU) transmitted a log-on message, which investigators believe occurred as the SDU started after a power interruption. Between the 2:25 message and 8:19, the SDU acknowledged two ground-to-aircraft telephone calls, which were not answered, and responded to automated, hourly requests from the ground station that were made to determine whether the SDU was still active. None of the communications from 2:25–8:19 contain explicit information about the aircraft's location. The aircraft's final transmission at 8:19 was a log-on message; the aircraft did not respond to a message from the ground station at 9:15. Investigators believe the 8:19 log-on message was made when the SDU was restarting after the aircraft ran out of fuel and the aircraft's auxiliary power unit was started.|$|E

In Macau, 30flights were delayed at Macau International Airport, and two bridges were closed. In Fuzhou in Fujian province, the storm knocked down 500trees.
