Cuba began negotiating arms purchases from the Eastern Bloc in March 1960.|$|E

This was accomplished via air and railway. Rhodesian operatives assisted in smuggling the gold reserves out of the country. The last of Schramme's mercenaries and gendarmes were evacuated on 25 January. Other gendarmes spent the remainder of 1963 in Northern Rhodesia.|$|E
5|$|In a book {{he wrote}} in the 1970s, Audisio argued that the {{decision}} to execute Mussolini taken at <b>the</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>in</b> Dongo of the partisan leaders on 28 April constituted a valid judgment of a tribunal under Article 15 of the CNLAI's ordinance on the Constitution of Courts of War. However, the lack of a judge or a Commissario di Guerra (required by the ordinance to be present) casts doubt on this assertion.|$|E

5|$|John, Duke of Berry (1340–1416) was Charles VI's {{uncle and}} a {{powerful}} figure in the kingdom, {{as well as the}} most famous and extravagant collector and commissioner of art of his day. He is still best known for commissioning the Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry, the famous International Gothic illuminated manuscript, and also commissioned the Holy Thorn Reliquary, now in the British Museum. The young king Charles had been forced to remove his uncle from governorships after the latter's rapacious conduct had led to unrest, and <b>the</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>in</b> 1391 marked their reconciliation after a period of bad relations. Lavish gifts among the Valois court circle were routine, and on this occasion Berry had special reason to be generous.|$|E

5|$|On 15 June {{the royal}} {{government}} and the remaining rebels, who were unsatisfied with the charters granted the previous day, agreed to meet at Smithfield, just outside the city walls.

The chronicler accounts of the encounter all vary on matters of detail, but agree on the broad sequence of events. The King and his party, at least 200 strong and including men-at-arms, positioned themselves outside St Bartholomew's Priory {{to the east of}} Smithfield, and the thousands of rebels massed along the western end.|$|E

5|$|The Mountain Grove Camp Meeting Association added a Chautauqua Day to {{the camp}} meeting in 1885, and it became highly popular. It {{occurred}} on the first Thursday of the meeting.

5|$|The neutral trading {{powers were}} {{still trying to}} arrange a peace. At Elateia, Philip had met with the same would-be peacemakers from Egypt and Rhodes who had been at <b>the</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>in</b> Heraclea, {{and again in the}} spring of 207 BC, but to no avail. Representatives of Egypt, Rhodes, Byzantium, Chios, Mytilene and perhaps Athens also met again with the Aetolians that spring. The war was going Philip's way, but the Aetolians, {{although}} now abandoned by both Pergamon and Rome, were not yet ready to make peace on Philip's terms. However, after another season's fighting, they finally relented. In 206 BC, the Aetolians, without Rome's consent, sued for a separate peace on conditions imposed by Philip.|$|E

5|$|The {{position}} that the general strike could be used, but {{only as a last}} resort, became dominant in the party during the mass strike debate. This caused much concern among the conservatives in the party, especially among many trade unionists. At a meeting in February 1906, the trade unionists were placated by party leaders, who said they would attempt to prevent a general strike at all costs. The FVdG reacted by publishing the secret protocols from <b>the</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>in</b> Die Einigkeit, greatly angering the party leadership.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, Taraki {{attended}} {{a conference of}} the Non-Aligned Movement in Havana, Cuba. On his way back he stopped in Moscow on 20 March and met with Brezhnev, foreign minister Andrei Gromyko and other Soviet officials. It was rumoured that Karmal was present at <b>the</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>in</b> an attempt to reconcile Taraki's Khalq faction and the Parcham against Amin and his followers. At the meeting, Taraki was successful in negotiating some Soviet support, including the redeployment of two Soviet armed divisions at the Soviet-Afghan border, the sending of 500 military and civilian advisers and specialists, and the immediate delivery of Soviet armed equipment sold at 25 percent below the original price. However, the Soviets were not pleased about the developments in Afghanistan and Brezhnev impressed upon Taraki the need for party unity. Despite reaching this agreement with Taraki, the Soviets continued to be reluctant to intervene further in Afghanistan and repeatedly refused Soviet military intervention within Afghan borders during Taraki's rule as well as later during Amin's short rule.|$|E

5|$|Knowing that {{he could}} not fight on without the support of the army, Jacobo Árbenz {{resigned}} on 27 June 1954, handing over power to Colonel Carlos Enrique Diaz. US ambassador John Peurifoy then mediated negotiations held in El Salvador between the army leadership and Castillo Armas which led to Armas being included in the ruling military junta on 7 July 1954, and was named provisional president a few days later. The US recognized the new government on 13 July. Elections were held in early October, from which all political parties were barred from participating, and Castillo Armas was the only candidate, winning the election with 99% of the vote. Among the outcomes of <b>the</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>in</b> El Salvador was a planned new constitution, which would roll back most of the progressive reform brought by the revolution.|$|E
5|$|Otto was {{crowned with}} the Holy Crown in Székesfehérvár on 6December 1304 by Benedict Rád, Bishop of Veszprém, and Anton, Bishop of Csanád. He {{was never able}} to {{strengthen}} his position in Hungary, because only the Kőszegis and the Transylvanian Saxons supported him. Charles seized Esztergom and many fortresses in the northern parts of Hungary (now in Slovakia) in 1306. His partisans also occupied Buda in June 1307. Ladislaus Kán, Voivode of Transylvania, seized and imprisoned Otto in Transylvania.

5|$|To {{co-ordinate}} {{planning for}} the proposed genocide, Heydrich hosted the Wannsee Conference, which brought together administrative leaders of the Nazi regime on 20 January 1942.

Eichmann attended the conference, oversaw the stenographer who took the minutes, and prepared the official distributed record of <b>the</b> <b>meeting.</b> <b>In</b> his covering letter, Heydrich specified that Eichmann would act as his liaison with the departments involved. Under Eichmann's supervision, large-scale deportations began almost immediately to extermination camps at Bełżec, Sobibor, Treblinka and elsewhere. The genocide was code-named Operation Reinhard in honour of Heydrich, who died in Prague in early June from wounds suffered in an assassination attempt.
