40|$|The article replies to the question, whether <b>the</b> <b>advertisement</b> {{can exist}} without ethical {{principles}} or ethics {{should be the}} basis of <b>the</b> <b>advertisement.</b> One can say that the ethical opinion of <b>the</b> <b>advertisement</b> does not depend on content and the form of advertising content exclusively, but also on recipientís consciousness. <b>The</b> <b>advertisement</b> appeals to <b>the</b> emotions more than to the intellect, thus restricting the area of conscious and based on rational premises choice, so it is morally bad. It is not that the moral evil immanently underlines <b>the</b> <b>advertisement,</b> but it concerns the mechanisms which cause that <b>the</b> <b>advertisement</b> turns out to be effective.

The only admissible form of <b>the</b> <b>advertisement</b> would be <b>the</b> reliable full information about the advantages and defects of the concrete advertised product. The most serious difficulty connected with the ethical opinion of <b>the</b> <b>advertisement</b> is <b>the</b> fact that <b>the</b> <b>advertisement</b> is <b>the</b> indispensable link of the present economy, and everyone who accepts the free market and perceives the positives of the economic growth, should also accept <b>the</b> <b>advertisement.</b> <b>The</b> <b>advertisement</b> constitutes <b>the</b> element of the economic activity, so in consequence the responsibility first of all lies with enterprises for its far-reaching results...|$|R

5|$|In 1981, actor James Garner claimed {{responsibility}} for the wording of the slogan during an interview with Playboy magazine. Garner, who narrated the original commercial, stated that his first action ever to be captured on film was to misread the line that had been provided to him.

5|$|In 2012 the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) in the UK banned some of Proactiv's {{advertising}} as misleading. A viewer {{complained that}} the celebrities were likely to have used the US version of Proactiv, which differs from the UK version. According to the ASA, the celebrities had signed statements saying they had used the UK version {{for a few weeks}} one to three years earlier, but <b>the</b> <b>advertisements</b> gave the appearance that they had continued to benefit from it, so the viewer's complaint was upheld.|$|E
5|$|Instead of {{producing}} {{a new series of}} spots on the television front, the chain reused the commercials originally produced by Crispin, Porter + Bogusky from the initial product run. These commercials were only played on Thursdays, specifically for the social media meme known as Throwback Thursday, events that feature historical personal stories or happenings that are routinely run on various sites such as Facebook or Instagram. The only major change to <b>the</b> <b>advertisements</b> was the addition of the hashtag TBT to the lower left-hand corner of the video.|$|E
50|$|For example, in {{political}} campaigns during important elections, undecided voters often see negative advertisements about {{a party or}} candidate for office. At the end of <b>the</b> <b>advertisement,</b> they also might notice that the opposing candidate paid for <b>the</b> <b>advertisement.</b> Presumably, this would make voters question the truthfulness of <b>the</b> <b>advertisement,</b> and consequently, {{they may not be}} persuaded initially. However, even though the source of <b>the</b> <b>advertisement</b> lacked credibility, voters {{will be more likely to}} be persuaded later (and ultimately, vote against the candidate disfavored by <b>the</b> <b>advertisement).</b>|$|R
40|$|An {{advertisement}} explicitly depicting behaviours {{associated with}} transmission of HIV was developed {{with the aim}} of reminding people of the continued threat posed by the virus to health. Evaluation of <b>the</b> <b>advertisement</b> was carried out to assess its impact on the target group of people, those aged 18 - 36 years. An international film festival provided the opportunity for <b>the</b> <b>advertisement</b> to be screened and an exit poll was carried out with a randomly selected 11 per cent sub-sample of the total audience of 2, 045. The results indicate that <b>the</b> <b>advertisement</b> reached and was assimilated by the target audience. Some differences were found based on socio-demographic variables, with women finding the portrayals in <b>the</b> <b>advertisement</b> more realistic than men. All audience reactions were positive with support expressed for wider dissemination of <b>the</b> <b>advertisement.</b> <b>The</b> <b>advertisement</b> has subsequently been released nationally through cinemas...|$|R

5|$|Published by Joseph Johnson, Mary {{itself was}} {{moderately}} successful, and sections {{of it were}} included in several collections of sentimental extracts that were popular at the time, such as The Young Gentleman and Lady's Instructor (1809). However, Johnson {{was still trying to}} sell copies of it in the 1790s and consistently listed it in <b>the</b> <b>advertisements</b> for her other works. It was not reprinted until the 1970s, when scholars became interested in Wollstonecraft and women's writing more generally.|$|E

5|$|Burger King {{introduced}} the Specialty Sandwich line under its Burger King and I promotional campaign {{developed by the}} J. Walter Thompson (JWT) agency. <b>The</b> <b>advertisements</b> featured customers and employees praising the new sandwiches accompanied with {{a brief description of}} the products being sold. Actor Stuart Pankin played a doorman in one commercial in the series. Another one of the promotions used was a scratch card game called What's my Specialty? where the customer would receive a card with their purchase in which they would have to match famous people to said person's profession. The commercial explained that if you expected to lose, you would be disappointed, as all cards were winners. Prizes included fries, sodas and sandwiches.|$|E

5|$|In August 2005, CP+B and Burger King {{became the}} target of lawyers of the band Slipknot, who alleged the mask-wearing rooster rockers were a blatant copy of the band's style. The band claimed that CP+B had {{approached}} Slipknot's record company, Roadrunner Records, with an offer to appear in another commercial for Burger King. The band declined {{on the grounds that}} they did not want to be associated with a burger chain and they felt that the Coq Roq advertisements were deliberately co-opting the band's signature look and style in order to influence its fans to purchase the chain's products. The band issued a cease and desist letter to CP+B and BK requesting <b>the</b> <b>advertisements</b> be pulled. When the two parties declined, the band sued for an undisclosed amount.|$|E
5|$|In the {{two years}} {{following}} the release of Horse in 1941, Kurosawa searched for a story he could use to launch his directing career. Towards the end of 1942, {{about a year after}} the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, novelist Tsuneo Tomita published his Musashi Miyamoto-inspired judo novel, Sanshiro Sugata, <b>the</b> <b>advertisements</b> for which intrigued Kurosawa. He bought the book on its publication day, devoured it in one sitting, and immediately asked Toho to secure the film rights. Kurosawa's initial instinct proved correct as, within a few days, three other major Japanese studios also offered to buy the rights. Toho prevailed, and Kurosawa began pre-production on his debut work as director.|$|E
5|$|The same update {{released}} {{alongside the}} Fury expansion pack introduced in-game advertisements, {{found in the}} loading screens before a race. This move was met with criticism from gaming news outlets, particularly as <b>the</b> <b>advertisements</b> almost doubled the loading time between levels, and while the game content loads at the same speed, the advert must finish playing before the race can begin. The adverts were removed soon after numerous complaints were made by players. In addition to the load time problems, there had been consternation about advertising being retroactively added into a game {{that had already been}} paid for.|$|E
5000|$|Since <b>the</b> <b>advertisement,</b> [...] "Not happy, Jan" [...] {{has entered}} the Australian vernacular to express displeasure, {{particularly}} at a problem caused by another's negligence or incompetence.

5|$|To {{compete in}} this market, Roberts needed more capital. He took MITS public in November 1973 with a stock {{offering}} of 500,000 shares at $1 each. The 1973 oil crisis caused {{a stock market}} downturn and MITS was only able to sell 250,000 shares. This allowed MITS {{to pay off the}} existing debt, but did not allow for any expansion. Roberts had developed several test equipment products such as a Waveform Generator and a Digital Voltmeter so he attempted to appeal to kit builders again by featuring the test equipment and digital clocks in <b>the</b> <b>advertisements,</b> instead of calculators. MITS was losing money, and by July 1974, the full page prominent ads were replaced with quarter-page ads {{in the back of the}} magazine.|$|E
5|$|Funding {{problems}} delayed construction even further. In February 1982, President Ronald Reagan proposed cutting Metro construction funds by 21.4 {{percent to}} just $295 million a year. Planned Green Line construction constituted 40.5 percent of Metro's construction budget, and the cuts threatened {{to cancel the}} entire Green Line. To African American community leaders, the cuts were evidence that Metrorail was meant for suburban white commuters while inner city African Americans were relegated to taking Metrobus. Despite the funding troubles, Metro planned to seek contractors in March 1982 for a $60 million contract to tunnel under the Anacostia River, a $60 million contract to build the Anacostia Station, and a $100 million contract to build the Navy Yard Station. But on March 16, 1982, Judge Ramsey barred Metro from spending any money {{on the construction of}} the Rosecroft Raceway route for the southern half of the Green Line. Judge Ramsey held that Metro had decided to shift the Green Line route without properly advertising the public hearings, which the transit system would now be required to hold (delaying construction of the Green Line and Anacostia Station by at least a year). Although Metro had advertised the hearings, Judge Ramsey said, <b>the</b> <b>advertisements</b> contained the same wording flaws that had precipitated the Maryland lawsuit. Metro subsequently scheduled new hearings for June 1982.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the late}} 1990s, both high demand and {{resulting}} high prices have fueled increased smuggling of slow lorises to Japan. Although pet shop employees declare that their slow lorises are captive-bred, <b>the</b> <b>advertisements</b> on the pet store websites indicate that their stocks come from Java, Sumatra, or China. New arrivals to the stores are also variable {{in size and}} age, which has further led the JWCS to suspect the slow lorises are imported illegally. Official, legal trade of slow lorises prior to CITES Appendix I coverage (from 1998 to 2006) was limited to just ten Sunda slow lorises from Malaysia and Myanmar. A review of 24surveys covering wildlife trade between 1990 and 2006 demonstrated 228slow lorises were {{known to have been}} traded unofficially each year and had come from Cambodia, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Laos. The major trade hubs were Jakarta, Medan, Singapore and Bangkok. Numerous illegal trade routes for each species were also documented prior to the 2007 CITES vote over Appendix I coverage in the Notification to Parties publication.|$|E

The prosecution estimated in the 2009 trial from emails and screenshots that <b>the</b> <b>advertisements</b> pay over 10 million SEK (US$1.4M) a year, but the indictment used the estimate {{from the police}} investigation.
