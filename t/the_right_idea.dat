5|$|The {{system of}} noble {{democracy}} became more firmly rooted {{during the first}} interregnum, {{after the death of}} Sigismund II Augustus, who following the Union of Lublin wanted to reassert his personal power, rather than become an executor of szlachta's will. A lack of agreement concerning the method and timing of the election of his successor was one of the casualties of the situation, and the conflict strengthened the Senate-magnate camp. After the monarch's 1572 death, to protect its common interests, szlachta moved to establish territorial confederations (kapturs) as provincial governments, through which public order was protected and basic court system provided. The magnates were able to push through their candidacy for the interrex or regent to hold the office until a new king is sworn, in the person of the primate, Jakub Uchański. The Senate took over the election preparations. The establishment's proposition of universal szlachta participation (rather than election by the Sejm) appeared at that time to be <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>idea</b> to most szlachta factions; in reality, during this first as well as subsequent elections, the magnates subordinated and directed, especially the poorer of szlachta.|$|E

This research is exploratory using the methodology of grounded theory. An in-depth analysis of a single case was used to test a theory of leading in complexity.

2500|$|Aristotle {{attempted}} {{to demonstrate the}} unity of God; but from the view which he maintained, that matter was eternal, it followed that God could not be the Creator of the world.

One other part of Aristotle's theory shocked {{the faith of the}} Mutakallamin [...] the Aristotelian theory of the soul. According to Aristotelianism, the human soul is simply man's substantial form, the set of properties that make matter into a living human body. This seems to imply that the human soul cannot exist apart from the body. Indeed, Aristotle writes, [...] "It is clear that the soul, or at least some parts of it (if it is divisible), cannot be separated from the body.

Regarding the attempted touchdown celebration, Marshall said, [...] "I know at the 1968 Olympics in Mexico, Tommie Smith and John Carlos raised that black glove and that fist as a silent gesture of black power and liberation.

30|$|As a {{grounded}} theory approach, {{one of the}} strengths of initial and focused coding {{is that it allows}} the researcher to compare the theory that has arisen from their data to existing theories. The ‘bureaucratic champions and unified childcare sector’ theory is congruent with the ‘policy entrepreneur’ literature that emerged from the work of Kingdon ([1984]). For Kingdon, policy entrepreneurs can be found inside and outside of government and across various policy sectors. Their success depends on a good reputation, good networking skills, and willingness to invest resources (most notably time) in a change process. A general theme running through this literature is that policy entrepreneurs engender systematic change by using <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>ideas</b> to exploit a ‘window of opportunity’ caused by some sort of upheaval. This study of Atlantic Canadian ECEC does bring an innovative element to the policy entrepreneur literature. It suggests that the effectiveness of policy entrepreneurs can be increased when (a) there is an alliance between those working both inside and outside of government and (b) the stakeholders outside of the government are relatively unified. A window of opportunity and <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>ideas</b> can only take policy entrepreneurs so far. The case of ECEC in PEI and New Brunswick indicates that the strategic decision to form an alliance of actors inside and outside of government as well as the good fortune of having a united set of stakeholders aids policy entrepreneurs in achieving systematic reform.|$|R
