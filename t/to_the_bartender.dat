25|$|In {{order to}} get to some of the items and {{progress}} through the game, Bart must use equipment such as rockets and cherry-bombs, which are bought with coins that can be collected by getting rid of aliens. Bart is controlled by the player both on foot and on a skateboard. To get rid of aliens, which are disguised as real humans, he needs to jump on their heads, although some are just regular humans. The game increases in difficulty for every level, and Bart meets up with a boss {{at the end of the}} first four. The levels are familiar to fans of The Simpsons and some of the television humor appears in the game: for example, in the first level Bart can make a prank call <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bartender</b> Moe in order for him to run outside so that the player can spray paint his purple apron (an example of an item that the aliens need) into a red color that the aliens do not want. The game also includes some minigames.|$|E

50|$|While {{the demon}} cruises for a fresh, {{undamaged}} body, Kate and Angel escape {{the basement and}} split up to search. Angel locates <b>the</b> <b>bartender</b> first and again battles the demon in its bartender host, which is still strong enough to injure Angel. Angel barely manages <b>to</b> throw <b>the</b> demon into a nearby burn barrel before collapsing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pavement.

Agreeing that <b>the</b> <b>bartender</b> had ample opportunity, Angel makes no mention of a body-hopping, parasitic demon being the real killer. After Angel thanks Kate for saving his life as well, she apologizes for searching his apartment. She wants the two of them to start over from the beginning with no secrets between them; Angel pauses almost imperceptibly, then agrees. He offers her his new business card and invites her to call if she has future problems, then characteristically disappears when her back is turned.|$|R
