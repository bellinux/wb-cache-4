500|$|Haynes {{began to}} have {{disagreements}} with the Apperson brothers for reasons that were never made public but were probably over money and design plans. Haynes wanted to produce luxury cars {{because much of the}} company's early clientele was wealthy, while the Appersons wanted to produce utilitarian vehicles that could be marketed to businesses. The disagreement led the two brothers to split from Haynes and start a company of their own in 1902. The loss of his partners necessitated that Haynes leave his position at Indiana Gas to devote more time to his growing business. Haynes was most interested in working on development, and turned over daily management to Victor Minich in 1903. Haynes spent most of his research efforts developing metals in an attempt to discover lighter and stronger alloys for automobile parts. He also investigated [...] other areas and published a 1906 paper on <b>the</b> <b>impurities</b> <b>in</b> gasoline and recommended that the sulfur content in the fuel be lowered to increase engine performance.|$|E

Use of coal in smelting started somewhat before the Industrial Revolution, based on innovations by Sir Clement Clerke and others from 1678, using coal reverberatory furnaces known as cupolas.

This has the advantage that impurities (such as sulphur ash) in the coal do not migrate into the metal. This technology was applied to lead from 1678 and to copper from 1687. It was also applied to iron foundry work in the 1690s, but in this case the reverberatory furnace was known as an air furnace. (The foundry cupola is a different (and later) innovation.) ...|$|E

Focusing on the strongly frustrated $J_ 1 $-$J_ 2 $ model and the spatially anisotropic $J_{ 1 a}$-$J_{ 1 b}$-$J_ 2 $ model, very distinct low energy behaviors reflect different levels of magnetic frustration. In the $J_ 1 $-$J_ 2 $ model, bound magnons appear trapped near <b>the</b> <b>impurity</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ground state and strongly reduce the ordered moments for sites proximal to <b>the</b> <b>impurity.</b> <b>In</b> contrast, local moments in the $J_{ 1 a}$-$J_{ 1 b}$-$J_ 2 $ model are enhanced on <b>the</b> <b>impurity</b> neighboring sites.

Graphene {{has long been}} known for its peculiar Dirac-like band structure which lends it many of its remarkable properties. It is a promising material for electronic and spintronic applications due to its high carrier mobility, low intrinsic spin-orbit interaction and small hyperfine coupling. However, extrinsic effects may easily dominate intrinsic mechanisms. The scattering mechanisms investigated here are those associated with non-magnetic, charged <b>impurities</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> substrate (e. g. SiO 2) beneath a planar n-type graphene layer. Such impurities cause an electric field that extends through the graphene and has a non-vanishing perpendicular component. Consequently, <b>the</b> <b>impurity,</b> <b>in</b> addition to <b>the</b> conventional spin-conserving scattering can give rise to spin-flip processes. The latter are a consequence of a spatially varying Rashba spin-orbit interaction caused by the electric field of <b>the</b> <b>impurity</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> substrate. This work focuses on the calculation of the elastic scattering cross-sections for these mechanisms. Additionally, relaxation times are estimated for assumed impurity concentrations...|$|R
