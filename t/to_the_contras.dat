5|$|Ferraro took {{a congressional}} trip to Nicaragua {{at the start}} of 1984, where she spoke <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Contras.</b> She decided that the Reagan Administration's {{military}} interventions there and in El Salvador were counterproductive towards reaching U.S. security goals, and that regional negotiations would be better.|$|E
5|$|The report {{published}} by the Tower Commission was delivered to the president on February 26, 1987. The Commission had interviewed 80 witnesses to the scheme, including Reagan, {{and two of the}} arms trade middlemen: Manucher Ghorbanifar and Adnan Khashoggi. The 200-page report was the most comprehensive of any released, criticizing the actions of Oliver North, John Poindexter, Caspar Weinberger, and others. It determined that President Reagan did not have knowledge of the extent of the program, especially about the diversion of funds <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Contras,</b> although it argued that the president ought to have had better control of the National Security Council staff. The report heavily criticized Reagan for not properly supervising his subordinates or being aware of their actions. A major result of the Tower Commission was the consensus that Reagan should have listened to his National Security Advisor more, thereby placing more {{power in the hands of}} that chair.|$|E
25|$|As arms flowed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>contras,</b> Savimbi's UNITA and the mujahideen, the Reagan Doctrine's advocates {{argued that}} the {{doctrine}} was yielding constructive results for U.S. interests and global democracy.|$|E
50|$|CIA {{involvement}} in trafficking is usually {{alleged to be}} connected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Contra</b> war in Nicaragua during the Reagan Administration, which acknowledged in 1986 that funds from cocaine smuggling had helped fund <b>the</b> <b>Contra</b> rebels, but stated that the smuggling was not authorized by the US government or resistance leaders.|$|R
50|$|From 1979 <b>to</b> 1990, <b>the</b> United States {{provided}} financial, logistical {{and military}} support <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Contra</b> rebels in Nicaragua, who used terrorist tactics in their {{war against the}} Nicaraguan government and carried out more than 1300 terrorist attacks. This support persisted despite widespread knowledge {{of the human rights}} violations committed by <b>the</b> <b>Contras.</b>|$|R

25|$|After the United States Congress {{approved}} {{an additional}} $24 million aid <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>contras</b> in December 1983, a new offensive was launched, named Plan Sierra. This offensive involved approximately 7000 {{members of the}} contra forces. As in earlier attacks, the initial objective of this offensive was to capture the border town of Jalapa to install a provisional government, which the CIA informed the contras would be immediately recognized by the United States Government. But this contra offensive was also repulsed by the Nicaraguan government forces.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. role Nicaragua was a {{controversial}} {{topic in the}} 1980s. The Reagan administration had sought to overthrow the socialist Daniel Ortega by funding the right-wing Contras, resulting in the Iran–Contra affair. Bush and Secretary of State Baker sought to find a bipartisan way to settle the issue, and {{with the support of}} Congress, they ended military aid <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Contras</b> in return for a promise from Ortega to hold full and free elections in 1990. In the election, Ortega was defeated by Violeta Chamorro of the National Opposition Union.|$|E
25|$|In 1982, {{legislation}} was enacted by US Congress to prohibit further direct aid <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Contras.</b> Reagan's officials attempted to illegally supply {{them out of}} the proceeds of arms sales to Iran and third party donations, triggering the Iran-Contra Affair of 1986–87. Mutual exhaustion, Sandinista fears of Contra unity and military success, and mediation by other regional governments led to the Sapoa ceasefire between the Sandinistas and the Contras on March 23, 1988. Subsequent agreements were designed to reintegrate the Contras and their supporters into Nicaraguan society in preparation for general elections.|$|E

Robinson has also been critical of the Chinese government for its treatment of political dissidents and for its policies in Tibet. He was a founder of the Canadian wing of Parliamentarians for East Timor. He was active in international parliamentary groups, including serving as rapporteur and chair of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe's Parliamentary Assembly Human Rights and Development Committee.|$|E
25|$|The Boland Amendment was a {{compromise}} because the U.S. Democratic Party {{did not have}} enough votes for a comprehensive ban on military aid. It covered only appropriated funds spent by intelligence agencies. Some of Reagan's national security officials used non-appropriated money of the National Security Council (NSC) to circumvent the Amendment. NSC officials sought to arrange funding by third parties. These efforts resulted in the Iran-Contra Affair of 1987, which concerned Contra funding through the proceeds of arms sales to the Islamic Republic of Iran. No court ever made a determination whether Boland covered the NSC and {{on the grounds that it}} was a prohibition rather than a criminal statute, no one was indicted for violating it. Congress later resumed aid <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Contras,</b> totaling over $300million. The Contra war ended when the Sandinistas were voted out of power by a war-weary populace in 1990. Sandinista leader Daniel Ortega was re-elected as President of Nicaragua in 2006 and took office again on January 10, 2007.|$|E
25|$|The Dirty War {{likewise}} {{served as}} cover for numerous ransom kidnappings, which continued {{even after the}} return of democracy in 1983 at {{the hand of a}} number of the same officers. The Director of Battalion 601, the Army Intelligence unit where most of these ransom kidnappings originated, was the hard-line General Guillermo Suárez Mason. His appointment as head of YPF of in 1981 was followed by a period of severe mismanagement at the state oil concern. He installed many of his hard-line Army Intelligence colleagues in managerial posts, and they in turn diverted large quantities of fuel into the director's newly established company Sol Petróleo – a dummy corporation used by Suárez Mason and his appointees for embezzlement as well as to divert funds <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Contras</b> and the fascist organization P2 (to which Suárez Mason belonged). YPF debts thus rose 142-fold during Suárez Mason's tenure, {{at the end of which}} in 1983 the company recorded a US$6 billion loss.|$|E
50|$|During his trial, North {{spent his}} last two years on active duty {{assigned}} to Headquarters Marine Corps in Arlington, Virginia. He resigned his Marine Corps commission in 1990 following his indictment for conspiring <b>to</b> defraud <b>the</b> United States by channeling the profits from US arms sales <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Contra</b> rebels in Nicaragua. After his trial and his appeal, all charges were dismissed.|$|R
50|$|After her death, Idania {{firepower}} increased thousandfold. In 1984, at {{the peak}} of <b>the</b> <b>Contra</b> war, one of the largest battalions of the Sandinista People's Army (Ejército Popular Sandinista), dispatched <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Northern Front <b>to</b> fight <b>the</b> <b>Contras,</b> was named after her.|$|R
500|$|At {{the same}} time that the American {{government}} was considering their options on selling arms to Iran, Contra militants based in Honduras waged a guerrilla war <b>to</b> topple <b>the</b> Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) revolutionary government of Nicaragua. Almost from the time he took office in 1981, a major goal of the Reagan administration was the overthrow of the left-wing Sandinista government in Nicaragua by backing <b>the</b> <b>Contra</b> rebels. <b>The</b> Reagan administration's policy towards Nicaragua produced a major clash between the executive and legislative arms as Congress sought to limit if not curb altogether the ability of <b>the</b> White House <b>to</b> support <b>the</b> <b>Contras.</b> [...] Direct U.S. funding of <b>the</b> <b>Contras</b> insurgency was made illegal through the Boland Amendment, <b>the</b> name given <b>to</b> three U.S. legislative amendments between 1982 and 1984 aimed at limiting U.S. government assistance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Contra's</b> militants. Funding ran out for <b>the</b> <b>Contras</b> by July 1984 and in October a total ban was placed in effect. The second Boland amendment in effect from 3 October 1984 to 3 December 1985 stated:During the fiscal year 1985 no funds available <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Central Intelligence Agency, the Department of Defense or any other agency or entity of the United States involved in intelligence activities may be obligated or expended for the purpose of or which may have the effect of supporting directly or indirectly [...] military or paramilitary operations in Nicaragua by any nation, organization, group, movement, or individual. In violation of the Boland Amendment, senior officials of the Reagan administration continued to secretly arm and train <b>the</b> <b>Contras</b> and provide arms to Iran, an operation they called [...] "the Enterprise". As <b>the</b> <b>Contras</b> were heavily dependent upon U.S. military and financial support, the second Boland amendment threatened <b>to</b> break <b>the</b> <b>Contra</b> movement and led to President Reagan in 1984 <b>to</b> order <b>the</b> National Security Council (NSC) <b>to</b> [...] "keep <b>the</b> <b>Contras</b> together 'body and soul'", no matter what Congress voted for.|$|R
25|$|In 1984 the Sandinista {{government}} filed a suit in the International Court of Justice (ICJ) {{against the}} United States (Nicaragua v. United States), {{which resulted in}} a 1986 judgment against the United States. The ICJ held that the U.S. had violated international law by supporting the contras in their rebellion against the Nicaraguan government and by mining Nicaragua's harbors. Regarding the alleged human rights violations by the contras, however, the ICJ took the view that the United States could only be held accountable for them if it would have been proven that the U.S. had effective control of the contra operations resulting in these alleged violations. Nevertheless, the ICJ found that the U.S. encouraged acts contrary to general principles of humanitarian law by producing the manual Psychological Operations in Guerrilla Warfare (Operaciones sicológicas en guerra de guerrillas) and disseminating it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>contras.</b> The manual, amongst other things, advised on how to rationalize killings of civilians and recommended to hire professional killers for specific selective tasks.|$|E
25|$|According to the CIIR report, Amnesty International and Americas Watch {{stated that}} there is no {{evidence}} that the use of torture was sanctioned by the Nicaraguan authorities, although prisoners reported the use of conditions of detention and interrogation techniques that could be described as psychological torture. The Red Cross made repeated requests to be given access to prisoners held in state security detention centers, but were refused. The CIIR was critical of the Permanent Commission on Human Rights (PCHR or CPDH in Spanish), claiming that the organisation had a tendency to immediately publish accusations against the government without first establishing a factual basis for the allegations. The CIIR report also questioned the independence of the Permanent Commission on Human Rights, referring to an article in The Washington Post which claims that the National Endowment for Democracy, an organization funded by the US government, allocated a concession of US$50,000 for assistance in the translation and distribution outside Nicaragua of its monthly report, and that these funds were administered by the Committee for Democracy in Central America (Prodemca), a US-based organization which later published full-page adverisements in the Washington Post and New York Times supporting military aid <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Contras.</b> The Permanent Commission denies that it received any money which it claims was instead used by others for translating and distributing their monthly reports in other nations.|$|E

500|$|In Poindexter's {{hometown}} of Odon, Indiana, a street was renamed to John Poindexter Street. Bill Breeden, a former minister, stole the street's sign {{in protest of}} the Iran–Contra affair. He claimed that he was holding it for a ransom of $30million, {{in reference to the}} amount of money given to Iran to transfer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Contras.</b> He was later arrested and confined to prison, making him, as satirically noted by Howard Zinn, [...] "the only person to be imprisoned {{as a result of the}} Iran–Contra Scandal".|$|E
500|$|A major legal {{debate that}} {{was at the center of}} the Iran–Contra affair {{concerned}} the question of whether the NSC was one of the [...] "any other agency or entity of the United States involved in intelligence activities" [...] covered by the Boland amendment with the Reagan administration arguing it was not, and many in Congress arguing it was. The majority of constitutional scholars have asserted the NSC did indeed fall within the purview of the second Boland amendment, through the amendment did not mention the NSC by name. More broadly was the constitutional question at stake, namely the power of Congress vs. the power of the presidency. The Reagan administration argued that because the constitution assigned the right to conduct foreign policy to the executive arm that its efforts to overthrow the government of Nicaragua were a presidential prerogative that Congress had no right to try to halt via the Boland amendments. By contrast congressional leaders argued that the constitution had assigned Congress control of the budget, and Congress had every right to use that power not to fund projects like attempting to overthrow the government of Nicaragua that they disapproved of. As part of the effort to circumvent the Boland amendment, the NSC established [...] "the Enterprise", an arms-smuggling network headed by a retired U.S. Air Force officer turned arms dealer Richard Secord that supplied arms <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Contras</b> that was ostensibly a private sector operation, but in fact was controlled by the NSC. To fund [...] "the Enterprise", the Reagan administration was constantly on the look-out for funds that came from outside the U.S. government as not to explicitly violate the letter of the Boland amendment, though the efforts to find alternative funding for the Contras violated the spirit of the Boland amendment. [...] Ironically, military aid <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Contras</b> was reinstated with Congressional consent in October 1986, a month before the scandal broke.|$|E

500|$|In late 1982, Congress {{passed a}} law which forbade the United States from funding groups aiming to {{overthrow}} the Sandinista government of Nicaragua. Then, in 1983, Bedell visited Nicaragua and Honduras along with Representative Robert G. Torricelli. During the trip, Bedell spoke with soldiers, generals, governmental officials {{and members of the}} contras. His conclusion {{at the end of the}} trip was that Ronald Reagan was aiding the contras in violation of federal law. He promised to hold hearings after returning to Congress. Bedell would later join other House Democrats in demanding documents from the White House related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>contras,</b> but the Reagan Administration refused to provide them. Bedell became angrier with the Reagan Administration as the decade wore on. He called his Central American policies [...] "sheer lunacy," [...] saying that the mining of harbors was an act of war.

500|$|In his exposé Veil: The Secret Wars of the CIA 1981–1987, {{journalist}} Bob Woodward {{chronicles the}} role of the CIA in facilitating the transfer of funds from the Iran arms sales to the Nicaraguan Contras spearheaded by Oliver North. According to Woodward, then–Director of the CIA William J. Casey admitted to him in February 1987 that he was aware of the diversion of funds <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>contras.</b> The controversial admission occurred while Casey was hospitalized for a stroke, and, according to his wife, was unable to communicate. On May 6, 1987, William Casey died the day after Congress began its public hearings on Iran–Contra. Independent Counsel, Lawrence Walsh later wrote: [...] "Independent Counsel obtained no documentary evidence showing Casey knew about or approved the diversion. The only direct testimony linking Casey to early knowledge of the diversion came from [...] North." [...] Gust Avrakodos, who was responsible for the arms supplies to the Afghans at this time, was aware of the operation as well and strongly opposed it, in particular the diversion of funds allotted to the Afghan operation. According to his Middle Eastern experts the operation was pointless because the moderates in Iran were {{not in a position to}} challenge the fundamentalists. However, he was overruled by Clair George.|$|E
500|$|While President Ronald Reagan was a {{supporter}} of the Contra cause, the evidence is disputed as to whether he authorized the diversion of the money raised by the Iranian arms sales <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Contras.</b> Handwritten notes taken by Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger on December 7, 1985, indicate that Reagan was aware of potential hostage transfers with Iran, as well as the sale of Hawk and TOW missiles to [...] "moderate elements" [...] within that country. Weinberger wrote that Reagan said [...] "he could answer to charges of illegality but couldn't answer to the charge that 'big strong President Reagan passed up a chance to free the hostages. After the weapon sales were revealed in November 1986, Reagan appeared on national television and stated that the weapons transfers had indeed occurred, but that the United States did not trade arms for hostages. The investigation was impeded when large volumes of documents relating to the scandal were destroyed or withheld from investigators by Reagan administration officials. On March 4, 1987, Reagan returned to the airwaves in a nationally televised address, taking full responsibility, and saying that [...] "what began as a strategic opening to Iran deteriorated, in its implementation, into trading arms for hostages".|$|E
25|$|On 4 January 1982, Reagan {{signed the}} top secret National Security Decision Directive 17 (NSDD-17), giving the CIA <b>the</b> {{authority}} <b>to</b> recruit and support <b>the</b> <b>contras</b> with $19 million in military aid. <b>The</b> effort <b>to</b> support <b>the</b> <b>contras</b> was {{one component of}} the Reagan Doctrine, which called for providing military support to movements opposing Soviet-supported, communist governments.|$|R
