5000|$|India and the West could {{together}} {{look for}} solutions to <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> share. Instead, Western commentators reproduce old colonial stories about India as an immoral culture. This {{gives them a}} twisted relationship to the Indian people. On the one hand, they keep turning towards the same class of Indian journalists, activists, and intellectuals for ‘local knowledge’. But these native informants merely talk {{the talk of the}} West to the West. On the other hand, more and more Indians are disgusted by the West’s condescending attitude towards their country. And this is then dismissed as hurt pride. If we want to bring our two peoples and cultures closer together in this new age, reason and empathy are our only hope. The madness of the current discourse about India must end. [...] - Jakob De Roover, University of Ghent, Belgium ...|$|E

I think we thought that because the population of Iraq hated Saddam Hussein, they would simply come out on the streets and everything would be fine... I don't think we quite estimated the degree of control that Saddam's people had in Iraqi society... So the kind of things we were planning for, with the benefit of hindsight, perhaps weren't quite the right things. But they were the right things in terms of <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> anticipated, which was the lack of food, water.

The President replied that [...] "the United States remains the most powerful, wealthiest nation on Earth, but we're only one nation, and that <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> confront, whether it's drug cartels, climate change, terrorism, you name it, can't be solved just by one country." [...] In addition, President Obama expressed a desire for the United States to seek friendship with all, harkening back to Franklin Delano Roosevelt's [...] "Good Neighbor Policy." [...] "I pledge to you that we seek an equal partnership. There is no senior partner and junior partner in our relations," [...] he said. [...] "There is simply engagement based on mutual respect and common interests and shared values." [...] Political policy analysts such as Ray Walser lamented this stance, arguing that portraying America as [...] "equal" [...] among {{the nations of the}} world would reduce its global stature.|$|E

He would always bring his bundles of books to teach in several regions of highland mining centers and the south of the country during the 1940s and 1950s. Due {{to the needs of the}} audience that he was teaching, Antonio developed a very simple linguistic style that he used in his books. He was aware that his books were not written for the country's intellectual elite but for the lay people who did not read on a regular basis or had access to any kind of information at all. He said, [...] "(...) I thought and knew that I had to deliver the book in the hands of our people, and that was my goal. (...) For me, the writer is just another laborer in society, not the privileged being who sits on an altar of mud. The writer, more than any other, should convey his thought somehow guiding the society (...)
