5|$|After an {{individual}} ascends the throne, {{he or she}} reigns until death. The only voluntary abdication, that of Edward VIII, had to be authorised by a special Act of Parliament, His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act 1936. The last monarch involuntarily removed from power was James VII and II, who fled into exile in 1688 during <b>the</b> <b>Glorious</b> Revolution.|$|E
5|$|After the French Revolution, she {{was renamed}} Vengeur du Peuple and {{took part in}} <b>the</b> <b>Glorious</b> First of June. There, she was {{disabled}} after a furious duel with HMS Brunswick and surrendered after losing hope of being rescued by a French ship. After a few hours, as British ships were beginning rescue operations, she listed and foundered, taking almost half her crew with her.|$|E
5|$|Finally, the 1681 Scottish Test Act {{required}} {{all public}} officials and MPs to swear unconditional {{loyalty to the}} King but with the crucial qualifier they 'promise to uphold the true Protestant religion.' Tolerance for James' personal Catholicism did not extend to Catholicism in general and his failure to understand this resulted in his deposition and exile by <b>the</b> <b>Glorious</b> Revolution.|$|E

5|$|For the sejm of 1606 {{the royal}} faction, hoping to take {{advantage}} of <b>the</b> <b>glorious</b> Battle of Kircholm victory and other successes, submitted a more comprehensive constructive reform program. Instead the sejm had become preoccupied with the dissident postulate of prosecuting instigators of religious disturbances directed against non-Catholics; advised by Skarga, the King refused his assent to the proposed statute.|$|E
5|$|John Benbow (10 March 16534 November 1702) was an English {{officer in}} the Royal Navy. He joined the navy aged 25 years, seeing action against Algerian pirates before leaving and joining the {{merchant}} navy where he traded until <b>the</b> <b>Glorious</b> Revolution of 1688, whereupon {{he returned to the}} Royal Navy and was commissioned.|$|E
5|$|Monmouth was {{executed}} for treason on 15 July 1685. Many {{of his supporters}} were tried during the Bloody Assizes, led by Judge Jeffreys, and were condemned to death or transportation. James II was then able to consolidate his power. He reigned until 1688, when he was overthrown in a coup d'état by William of Orange in <b>the</b> <b>Glorious</b> Revolution.|$|E

50|$|Hearts Divided is a 1936 American musical {{film about}} the real-life {{marriage}} between American Elizabeth 'Betsy' Patterson and Jérôme Bonaparte, brother of Napoleon.

5|$|On 16 May 1794, {{the fleet}} {{departed}} from Brest {{with the mission}} of protecting a convoy of ships carrying food to France, beginning the Atlantic campaign of May 1794. On 1 June, the French squadron encountered the British fleet, in an engagement known as <b>the</b> <b>Glorious</b> First of June. Vengeur was third in the French line of battle, after the flagship Montagne and between Achille and Northumberland.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Glorious</b> First of June {{demonstrated}} {{a number of}} the major problems inherent in the French and British navies {{at the start of the}} Revolutionary Wars. Both admirals were faced with disobedience from their captains, along with ill-discipline and poor training among their shorthanded crews, and they failed to control their fleets effectively during the height of the combat.|$|E
5|$|The statues were {{eventually}} taken down when Charles II {{came to the}} throne and were either repaired or replaced. A bronze statue of James II by Grinling Gibbons, depicting the king wearing the robes of a Roman emperor, stood just outside the garden in the Pebble Court from 1686 to 1898 (with a short interruption during <b>the</b> <b>Glorious</b> Revolution). It now occupies a spot in Trafalgar Square outside the National Gallery.|$|E

5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>Glorious</b> Revolution, Wright, a Jacobite, {{fell out}} of favour at the royal court. The Flemish-Spanish painter John Baptist Medina (1659–1710) came to Scotland in 1693 and became the leading Scottish {{portrait}} painter of his generation. Among his best known works are {{a group of about}} 30 oval bust-lengths, including a self-portrait, in Surgeons' Hall, Edinburgh. He trained his son, also John, and William Aikman (1682–1731), who became the leading Scottish portrait-painter of the next generation. Aikman migrated to London in 1723, and from this point until the late eighteenth century, most Scottish painters of note followed him.|$|E
5|$|At the Restoration the Privy Council {{established}} {{a force of}} {{an unknown number of}} infantry regiments and a few troops of horse. The Commonwealth fortresses were abandoned, but garrisons were placed in Edinburgh, Stirling, Dumbarton and Blackness castles. There were attempts to found a national militia on the English model. The standing army was mainly employed in the suppression of Covenanter rebellions and the guerilla war undertaken by the Cameronians in the East. Units included a regiment of foot guards, later known as the Scots Guards and Le Regiment of Douglas, formed and serving in France since 1633, it returned, eventually became the Royal Regiment of Foot. Pikemen became less important in the late seventeenth century and after the introduction of the socket bayonet, a process complete by 1702, disappeared altogether, while matchlock muskets were replaced by the more reliable flintlock. Three troops of Scots Dragoons were raised in 1678 and another three were added to make The Royal Regiment of Scots Dragoons in 1681. On the eve of <b>the</b> <b>Glorious</b> Revolution the standing army in Scotland was about 3,000 men in various regiments and another 268 veterans in the major garrison towns, at an annual cost of about £80,000. After <b>the</b> <b>Glorious</b> Revolution the Scots were drawn into King William II's continental wars, beginning with the Nine Years' War in Flanders (1689–97).|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the French Revolutionary War, Gibraltar served in the Channel Fleet, {{fighting}} at <b>the</b> <b>Glorious</b> First of June in 1794 before being sent to the Mediterranean in May 1795. In June, the ship was in an action off Hyères; then, in December 1796, she was badly damaged in a storm and had to return to England for major repairs. By June Gibraltar was back in the Mediterranean, serving in the navy's Egyptian campaign, where she remained during and beyond the Peace of Amiens, except for a short period when she was sent home for a refit.|$|E

5|$|Benbow only {{returned}} to the Navy after <b>the</b> <b>Glorious</b> Revolution in 1688. His first recorded commission was to the post of third lieutenant of HMS Elizabeth on 1 June 1689, {{under the command of}} Captain David Mitchell. His first command came on 20 September of that year, when he was appointed captain of HMS York. He was transferred to HMS Bonaventure on 26 October and then to HMS Britannia on 12 November.|$|E
5|$|Captain Renaudin {{was said}} in a naval {{registry}} to have swum to safety. He had in fact abandoned his ship with the first British boat, leaving his men behind in disregard for military customs and the 1765 standing order that Captains had to be last to abandon ship, and though his account insinuates {{that he was on}} a boat close to Vengeur when she foundered, he was actually dining in the mess of Culloden at the moment of the sinking. In 1795, Loutherbourg depicted the rescue of Vengeurs crew by British ships in his large canvas of the battle, Lord Howe's action, or <b>the</b> <b>Glorious</b> First of June.|$|E

The army is currently involved in a campaign against the Piper, who is trying to claim the Fourth Key.|$|E
