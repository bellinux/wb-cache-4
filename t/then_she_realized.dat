500|$|... "All Is Full of Love", {{the closing}} track of Homogenic, was the album's last song {{to be written}} and recorded. Produced by Björk, the {{original}} version of the song was replaced [...] "at the last minute" [...] by Howie B's version. It {{was inspired by the}} spring while producing the album in Málaga, Spain. After living in the mountains among other people for six months, Björk felt lonely, but a morning walk in April inspired her to write the track. She had a rough winter and <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>realized</b> it was spring after she could hear the birds singing. She wrote and recorded the song in half a day.|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>realized</b> {{that this}} sounded too personal, {{and she felt}} foolish.|$|E
60|$|Just {{an instant}} the girl hesitated, and <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>realized</b> the truth, and {{throwing}} her arms about his neck she drew {{his face to}} hers and kissed him--unashamed.|$|E

60|$|It rose doubtfully, it {{staggered}} and trembled, {{but it did}} get {{up without}} catching--this time. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>realized</b> that Kennicott had forgotten {{to turn off the}} houselights. Some one out front was giggling.|$|E
6000|$|But Barbara's attention, {{had wandered}} off again into that queer medley of thoughts, and feelings, {{out of which}} the little man had so {{abruptly}} roused her. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>realized</b> that the meeting was breaking up, and her mother saying: ...|$|E
60|$|Sadie frowned, {{because she}} had {{accepted}} her father's business code. His charges were high, {{but it had been}} his boast that Keller's delivered the goods one paid for. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>realized</b> that Bob had nearly succeeded in putting off the threatened talk.|$|E
5000|$|... "Grace Greene"—Annabels mom. She enjoys Annabels {{modeling}} and is clinging {{on to that}} part of Annabels life. Her other daughters, Whitney and Kirsten, had already quit modeling, so Annabel was all she had left.

50|$|Winnie, a {{teenager}} {{now is in}} a dry cornfield talking to the turtle, she still has a bottle of the spring water that Jesse gave to her and pours {{it all over the}} toad, but <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>realizes</b> that if they do try to kill it and it doesn't work, then they'll wonder, so she puts it into the woods and hides it.|$|R
50|$|After {{he takes}} her blood for the third time, she becomes violently ill. He tells her that she doesn’t have a disease, but {{that they are a}} {{different}} race of people who need blood to survive. Shea refuses to believe this at first. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>realizes</b> that <b>she</b> doesn’t have normal human bodily functions. <b>She</b> soon <b>realizes</b> that this is the truth and that her father was a being just like Jacques.|$|R
60|$|Carley {{wondered}} if she were not so constituted that such trickery alienated her. Deep in her heart she resented being made to show her cowardice. But <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>realized</b> {{that no one had}} really seen any evidence of her state. It was fun to them.|$|E
60|$|Kilmeny {{opened her}} eyes and looked {{straight}} into the mirror where, like a lovely picture in a golden frame, she saw herself reflected. For a moment she was bewildered. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>realized</b> what it meant. The lilies fell from her arm to the floor and she turned pale. With a little low, involuntary cry she put her hands over her face.|$|E
60|$|Tuppence shivered. His words woke a vague alarm in her. What {{if there}} WAS some one {{concealed}} in the house? Some one who might bar that door on them, {{and leave them}} to die like rats in a trap? <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>realized</b> the absurdity of her thought. The house was surrounded by police who, if they failed to reappear, would not hesitate to break in and make a thorough search. She smiled at her own foolishness--then looked up with a start to find Sir James watching her. He gave her an emphatic little nod.|$|E
50|$|<b>Then,</b> <b>she</b> starts {{looking for}} the intruder, and she find a poor, injured man. She takes him home, takes care of him and washes his feet. Finally, she falls asleep at his side, {{and she has a}} dream where the poor man is Jesus, who puts a little rock in her hand. When she wakes up, the man is not at her side, but the rock of her dream is in her hand. <b>Then,</b> <b>she</b> <b>realizes</b> that the dream was not a dream.|$|R
5000|$|Before he died, Papillio {{managed to}} whisper {{a clue to}} Nubia to [...] "find the other six." [...] At first, Flavia {{believes}} {{that this is a}} reference to the siege of Masada, of which there were only seven survivors, including Hepzibah. But <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>realizes</b> that, under Roman law, a will requires seven witnesses. The two murder victims must have been witnesses to Dives's real will, and they have to find the other five.|$|R
5000|$|Hannah Marie - Hannah {{is scared}} of monsters, but <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>realizes</b> monsters don't eat kids. Hannah's very kind and friendly, and it's implied {{that she has}} a crush on Orson, a young male vampire. In the first TV-special, her older cousin, Jimmy, and his friends scare her, but the monsters on the Fright Side help her get back at them in the end. Dresses as a fairy princess. She is voiced by Britt McKillip.|$|R
60|$|She did {{not sleep}} much until {{the night was}} half spent; but at last Nature overcame her terrors of the black abyss beneath and the hairy body of the wild beast at her side, and she {{fell into a deep}} slumber which outlasted the darkness. When she opened her eyes the sun was well up. At first she could not believe in the reality of her position. Her head had rolled from Korak's {{shoulder}} so that her eyes were directed upon the hairy back of the ape. At sight of it she shrank away. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>realized</b> that someone was holding her, and turning her head she saw the smiling eyes of the youth regarding her. When he smiled she could not fear him, and now she shrank closer against him in natural revulsion toward the rough coat of the brute upon her other side.|$|E
6000|$|Five {{thousand}} {{voices were}} singing [...] "Aloha Oe,"--"My love {{be with you}} till we meet again,"--and in that first moment of known love {{she realized that she}} and Steve were being torn apart. When would they ever meet again? He had taught her those words himself. She remembered listening as he sang them over and over under the hau tree at Waikiki. Had it been prophecy? And she had admired his singing, had told him that he sang with such expression. She laughed aloud, hysterically, at the recollection. With such expression!--when he had been pouring his heart out in his voice. She knew now, and it was too late. Why had he not spoken? <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>realized</b> that girls of her age did not marry. But girls of her age did marry--in Hawaii--was her instant thought. Hawaii had ripened her--Hawaii, where flesh is golden and where all women are ripe and sun-kissed.|$|E
60|$|It was a long, {{meandering}} talk, stupid, shameful, and unavoidable. Ann Veronica was apologetic to {{the bottom}} of her soul. At the same time she was wildly exultant at the resolution she had taken, the end she had made to her blunder. She had only to get through this, to solace Manning as much as she could, to put such clumsy plasterings on his wounds as were possible, and then, anyhow, she would be free--free to put her fate to the test. She made a few protests, a few excuses for her action in accepting him, a few lame explanations, but he did not heed them or care for them. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>realized</b> that it was her business to let Manning talk and impose his own interpretations upon the situation so far as he was concerned. She did her best to do this. But about his unknown rival he was acutely curious.|$|E
6000|$|Even <b>then</b> <b>she</b> {{scarcely}} <b>realized</b> that <b>she</b> was trapped. [...] "You?" [...] she cried. [...] "You, Baron? But I do not understand. You {{have followed}} me here?" ...|$|R
50|$|After {{his wife}} accepts a {{position}} in Geneva, Alfred devotes himself to the salmon project. Although painfully shy, he enjoys working with Harriet and they begin to make progress. Their enthusiasm is interrupted, however, when Harriet learns that her new boyfriend, British special forces captain Robert Meyers (Tom Mison), is missing in action. Devastated, Harriet withdraws to her apartment. When Alfred visits her, she gets upset, thinking he just wants her to return to work, but <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>realizes</b> {{he has come to}} comfort her, and the two embrace.|$|R
5000|$|By {{the end of}} Act I, Moreno and Nuti have {{independently}} {{confirmed that}} the play is based on their story, and Moreno wishes to stop it from going on. However, it continues, and Act II shows Rocca's arrival to tell Delia that he has realized their mutual hatred is concealed love; she rejects him and they fight, but <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>realizes</b> he is right, and they embrace. In the auditorium, Moreno and Nuti, still furious, catch sight {{of each other and}} likewise embrace. Act III is [...] "canceled." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{had seen}} {{that he could be}} gentle, in the sick child's case, and she {{suspected}} that he could be generous, {{but there was something about}} him that also hinted at force. Then she remembered some of the men with whom she had been brought into unpleasant contact in the cities--many who bore the unmistakable mark of the beast, the cheap swagger of others, and the inane attempts at gallantries which some of the rest indulged in. They were not all like that, she realized; there were true men everywhere; but now that her first shrinking from the grim and lonely land was lessening it seemed to her that it had, in some respects at least, a more bracing influence on those who lived in it than that other still very dear one on which she had turned her back. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>realized</b> that she was, after all, appraising its inhabitants by a single specimen. She had yet to learn that they are now and then a little too aggressively proud of themselves in western Canada, though it must be said that the boaster is usually ready to pour out the sweat of tensest effort with ax and saw or ox-team to prove his vaunting warranted.|$|E
60|$|So {{she kept}} on, {{now and then}} gazing at the smoke. As she grew nearer to the first {{monument}} she was surprised, then amazed, at its height and surpassing size. It was mountain-high--a grand tower--smooth, worn, glistening, yellow and red. The trail she had followed petered out in a deep wash, and beyond that she crossed no more trails. The sage had grown meager and the greasewoods stunted and dead; and cacti appeared on barren places. The grass had not failed, {{but it was not}} rich grass such as the horses and cattle grazed upon miles back on the slope. The air was hot down here. The breeze was heavy and smelled of fire, and the sand was blowing here and there. She had a sense of the bigness, the openness of this valley, and <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>realized</b> its wildness and strangeness. These lonely, isolated monuments made the place different from any she had visited. They did not seem mere standing rocks. They seemed to retreat all the time as she approached, and they watched her. They interested her, made her curious. What had formed all these strange monuments? Here the ground was level for miles and miles, to slope gently up to the bases of these huge rocks. In an old book she had seen pictures of the Egyptian pyramids, but these appeared vaster, higher, and stranger, and they were sheerly perpendicular.|$|E
5000|$|Claudia Zepeda as María del Mar Solís, a.k.a. [...] "La Matada" [...] (The Brainy). 15 years old, Aries.

50|$|SynopsisShabana plays {{a staunch}} Hindu woman, {{on her way}} to visit her grandchildren by train. In a hurry she forgets her wallet in her house and heads to the station. Deliberately she sits only in a taxi with Hindu deity's photos (She dislikes Muslims). But <b>then,</b> <b>she</b> <b>realizes</b> that the driver (Anup Soni) is a Muslim. She misses her train and her next train is in two hours. She goes to a canteen and orders the {{cheapest}} meal, a plate of rice with the change she has and leaves her table to wash her hand.

Later <b>she</b> <b>realizes</b> it, and leaves the place, ashamed at herself. At the railway station she notices that she had left her luggage and handbag in the canteen and goes back. There she finds her belongings near a table and a rice plate on it. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>realizes</b> that the Muslim man never stole her rice plate, he was, in fact, eating out of his own one, and yet he did not yell at her when she snatched it from him and spoke rudely to him. Later in the station, she offers place to a Muslim family, which shows that she had changed her attitude.|$|R
50|$|A woman (Allman) drives aimlessly alone {{through the}} Southwestern United States, running from her past. Drunk one early morning, she hits {{something}} on a remote road. Unsure if it was human or animal, alive or dead, she doesn't bother to check. She instead drives off in a panic and frantically tries to wash the blood off her car in a nearby, seemingly abandoned town. <b>Then,</b> <b>she</b> <b>realizes</b> <b>she</b> is being watched. A young hitchhiker (Kilpatrick), a lost soul herself, has wandered these desert roads for years. The hitchhiker blackmails the driver into giving her {{a ride to the}} ocean.

However, the driver realizes that her companion holds a secret that will profoundly change this journey.|$|R
5000|$|Vedder about [...] "Elderly Woman Behind the Counter in a Small Town":It's kind {{of about}} a lady, and she's getting on in years, and she's stuck in this small town. Small towns fascinate me: You either {{struggle}} like hell to get out, to {{some people want to}} stay 'cause then they're the big fish in the small pond, and then others just kind of get stuck there. So here she is working in this little place, and then an old flame comes in, and he's probably driving a nice car and looking kind of sharp—not a fancy car, but he's moved on. And <b>then</b> <b>she</b> sees him, and at first she doesn't even remember who he is, and <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>realizes</b> who it is. She's just too embarrassed to say 'hello'.|$|R

She went out with Jordan for a while, then broke up with him. Tamika was a nice girl, but she wasn't as interested in Jordan as Jordan was interested in her. She doesn't return in the second season because she moved away.|$|E
