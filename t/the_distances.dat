5|$|In modern thought, {{the orbits}} of the planets are viewed as the paths of those planets through mostly empty space. Ancient and medieval thinkers, however, {{considered}} the celestial orbs to be thick spheres of rarefied matter nested one within the other, each one in complete contact with the sphere above it and the sphere below. When scholars applied Ptolemy's epicycles, they presumed that each planetary sphere was exactly thick enough to accommodate them. By combining this nested sphere model with astronomical observations, scholars calculated what became generally accepted values at the time for <b>the</b> <b>distances</b> to the Sun (about 4 million miles), to the other planets, and {{to the edge of}} the universe (about 73 million miles).

5|$|American {{astronomer}} Edwin Hubble {{observed that}} <b>the</b> <b>distances</b> to faraway galaxies were strongly correlated with their redshifts.

Assuming the Copernican principle (that the Earth is not {{the center of the}} universe), the only remaining interpretation is that all observable regions of the universe are receding from all others. Since we know that the distance between galaxies increases today, it must mean that in the past galaxies were closer together.
