500|$|Keaton's casting {{caused a}} {{controversy}} among comic book fans, with 50,000 protest letters sent to Warner Bros. offices. Bob Kane, Sam Hamm and Michael Uslan also heavily questioned the casting. [...] "Obviously {{there was a}} negative response from the comic book people. I think <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> {{were going to make}} it like the 1960s TV series, and make it campy, because they thought of Michael Keaton from Mr. Mom and Night Shift and stuff like that." [...] Keaton studied The Dark Knight Returns for inspiration.|$|E
500|$|Discussing {{the impact}} of the {{government}} shutdown on the Republican Party, Gingrich later commented that, [...] "Everybody in Washington thinks that was a big mistake. They're exactly wrong. There had been no reelected Republican majority since 1928. Part of the reason we got reelected... is our base thought we were serious. And <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> were serious because when it came to a show-down, we didn't flinch." [...] In a 2011 op-ed in The Washington Post, Gingrich said that the government shutdown led to the balanced-budget deal in 1997 and the first four consecutive balanced budgets since the 1920s, as well as the first re-election of a Republican majority since 1928.|$|E
500|$|... 2001 earned Stanley Kubrick an Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, {{as well as}} {{nominations}} for Best Director and Original Screenplay (shared with Arthur C. Clarke). Anthony Masters was also nominated for Best Art Direction. An honorary award was made to John Chambers in that year for his make-up work on Planet of the Apes, and Clarke reports that he [...] "wondered, as loudly as possible, whether the judges had passed over 2001 because <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> had used real ape-men". The film won four Baftas, for Art Direction, Cinematography, Sound Track and as Best Road Show, and was a nominee in the Best Film category.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{horsemen}} {{stayed here}} till {{within a few}} minutes of your arrival. No doubt <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>we</b> should suppose they had all gone, and might venture out, and let them get a shot at us." ...|$|R
25|$|They said, we {{corrupted}} each other, {{and that}} <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> when <b>we</b> were parted, {{we would have}} bowed to them. But they found we were more stronger afterwards than we were before; the Lord our God did fit us for every condition.|$|R
5000|$|In 2007, an unfilmed script by the show's {{script editor}} Johnny Byrne was {{recovered}} and {{presented to the}} BBC as a possible Christmas reunion episode, but the BBC did not commission it. Peter Davison joked, [...] "Maybe <b>they</b> just <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> were too decrepit, I don't know!" ...|$|R
500|$|Fans of {{the band}} were equally {{polarized}} by A Thousand Suns. Initial signs of the fans' division over the band's new material occurred when [...] "The Catalyst" [...] was released as a single. MTV conducted a poll asking fans how they received the song; most responses were positive but a large amount were dissatisfied with it. Fans then therefore debated on {{what they thought of}} the new sound. Sara Ferrer of Orange County Reloaded said the album split the views of fans and critics into [...] "love-it versus hate-it groups". Montgomery expressed similar sentiments, saying the album [...] "alternately thrilled and thinned [...] substantial fanbase with its vast swaths of sonic sprawl (and overall lack of guitar solos)." [...] Shinoda shared his thoughts on the divided reception of the fans; he thanked the people who accepted the album and defended it from the criticism of those who disliked it. Commenting on fans' polarized response to the album, Bennington said, [...] " [...] is definitely something that we knew people would need to digest and get over the fact that it's not what <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> would do." ...|$|E
500|$|After touring {{in support}} of Ultramega OK the band signed with A Records, which caused a rift between Soundgarden and its {{traditional}} audience. Thayil said, [...] "In the beginning, our fans came from the punk rock crowd. They abandoned us when <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> sold out the punk tenets, getting on a major label and touring with Guns N' Roses. There were fashion issues and social issues, and people thought we no longer belonged to their scene, to their particular sub-culture." [...] The band later began work on its first album for a major label, but personnel difficulties caused {{a shift in the}} band's songwriting process, according to Cornell: [...] "At the time Hiro [...] excommunicated himself from the band and there wasn't a free-flowing system as far as music went, so I ended up writing a lot of it." [...] On September 5, 1989, the band released its second album, Louder Than Love, which saw it take [...] "a step toward the metal mainstream," [...] according to Steve Huey of Allmusic, describing it as [...] "a slow, grinding, detuned mountain of Sabbath/Zeppelin riffs and Chris Cornell wailing". Because of some of the lyrics, most notably on [...] "Hands All Over" [...] and [...] "Big Dumb Sex", the band faced various retail and distribution problems upon the album's release. Louder Than Love became the band's first album to chart on the Billboard 200, peaking at number 108 on the chart in 1990.|$|E
2500|$|Moore also {{publicly}} criticised {{details of}} the script before the film's release, pointing to apparent laziness in the writing. [...] "They don't know what British people have for breakfast, they couldn't be bothered [...] 'Eggy in a basket' apparently. Now the US have 'eggs in a basket,' which is fried bread with a fried egg in {{a hole in the}} middle. I guess <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> must eat that as well, and thought 'eggy in a basket' was a quaint and Olde Worlde version.", he stated.|$|E
6000|$|... "Evert has {{reasoned}} {{and talked}} {{so much to}} my father and mother," [...] continued the fiancée, blushing, [...] "that <b>they</b> have <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> had better be married at once. Do you know, Maud, {{that it has been}} settled this evening, that the ceremony is to take place to-morrow!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nor I," [...] the man growled. [...] "It {{is as much}} as I {{can do to keep}} {{my hands}} off my dagger now, for methinks that nine out often of the fellows {{loitering}} about would cut our throats willingly, if <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>we</b> had but a crown in our pockets." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What does it mean, Macumazahn?" [...] she asked, {{when the}} pair had gone by, as <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> unobserved, since <b>we</b> were {{standing}} {{where they could}} not see us.|$|R
2500|$|As {{captain of}} the {{national}} side, Wessels was similarly criticised for playing too conservatively in South Africa's first test series since readmission into international cricket. Although South Africa won the home series against India by 1–0, fans and critics sharpened their pencils and attacked the captain mercilessly for his team's apparent lack of passion and ambition. The fourth test in Cape Town, in particular, was condemned across the cricketing world. The two teams scored a total of 795 runs in 433.4 overs, {{at an average of}} only 1.83 runs per over and ended in a draw. Wessels commented on the criticism in his biography, saying: [...] "It was almost as if <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> should win every series 4–0. They simply don't understand that modern Test cricket is tough and competitive." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to road manager Don Opperman: [...] "The way I {{remember}} it, the 'ooos' and the 'boos' {{were mixed}} together, but Stevie was pretty disappointed. Stevie [...] just handed me his guitar {{and walked off}} stage, and I'm like, 'Are you coming back?' There was a doorway back there; the audience couldn't see the guys, but I could. He {{went back to the}} dressing room with his head in his hands. I went back there finally, {{and that was the end}} of the show." [...] According to Vaughan: [...] "It wasn't the whole crowd [...] It was just a few people sitting right up front. The room there was built for acoustic jazz. When five or six people boo, wow. It sounds like the whole world hates you. <b>They</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> were too loud, but shoot, I had four army blankets folded over my amp, and the volume level was on 2. I'm used to playin' on 10!" [...] The performance was filmed and later released on DVD in September 2004.|$|E
2500|$|Daly is popularly {{attributed}} in Marine Corps lore as yelling, [...] "Come on, you sons of bitches, do {{you want}} to live forever?" [...] to his men during the Battle of Belleau Wood. Daly later told a Marine Corps historian that his words were [...] "For Christ's sake men—come on! Do you want to live forever?" [...] The Chicago Tribune correspondent Floyd Gibbons, who was at Belleau Wood, reported hearing the words in his 1918 memoir And <b>They</b> <b>Thought</b> <b>We</b> Wouldn't Fight, which he attributed to an unnamed gunnery sergeant (Daly was a first sergeant at the time). Gibbons was attached to elements of Major Benjamin S. Berry's battalion (3rd Battalion 5th Marines) during the battle, but Daly was the First Sergeant of the 73rd Machine Gun Company, a part of 3rd Battalion 6th Marines under the command of Major Berton W. Sibley. Sibley's battalion attacked south of Berry's and were on the outskirts of Lucy-le-Bocage when Daly made the cry. Additionally, 6th Marines commander Colonel Albertus W. Catlin implied in his memoir that the yell came from an unnamed sergeant in Berry's battalion.. [...] For his actions at Belleau Wood, he was recommended for a third medal of honor. However, during the processing for his medal, someone thought that awarding three medals of honor to the same man was unacceptable, so Daly was instead awarded the Distinguished Service Cross and later the Navy Cross and French Médaille Militaire.|$|E
5000|$|Howler's {{first public}} {{performance}} {{was at the}} farmers market where they found financial success. In an interview with Minnesota Public Radio, Gatesmith explained, [...] "People thought the lyrics were really funny and <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>we</b> were being cute and kind of snide {{all at the same}} time. They're like, 'Well that's interesting.' [...] " ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'The maid {{took the}} matches and lit {{the fire with}} them. How they spluttered and flamed, to be sure! [...] "Now {{everyone}} can see," [...] <b>they</b> <b>thought,</b> [...] "that <b>we</b> are the grandest! How we sparkle! What a light-" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{talking about}} a personally-conducted tour of the Park that some folks in and around Crumville are getting up. Mr. Basswood, Ben's father, is {{at the head of}} it. It's a sort of church affair. They have got my folks interested, and my Uncle Dunston says he will go, and so will Laura, and Mrs. Wadsworth, and Jessie, and half a dozen others you know. <b>They</b> <b>thought</b> maybe <b>we</b> boys would want to go, too." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They might--if <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> were {{carrying}} anything of value. To such desperadoes all are fish that swim near their net." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she {{answered}} steadily; [...] "we must. The man you met {{has been at}} Appleyard when <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> were all asleep--and I'm afraid he'll be here again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nappy and Slugger {{certainly}} have the laugh on us for this," [...] said Fred, as they plowed along. [...] "Maybe <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> would lose our way completely in this darkness." ...|$|E
50|$|The Cyrenaics {{were known}} for their skeptical theory of knowledge. They reduced logic to a basic {{doctrine}} concerning the criterion of truth. <b>They</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>we</b> can know with certainty our immediate sense-experiences (for instance, that I am having a sweet sensation now) but can know nothing {{about the nature of}} the objects that cause these sensations (for instance, that the honey is sweet). They also denied that we can have knowledge of what the experiences of other people are like.|$|R
5000|$|... "They {{spent a lot}} {{of money}} on us making the records. A lot of people at the label {{genuinely}} seemed to love the band. The president of the label showed up at our gigs and got all psyched up and said this was not a vanity project on the part of the label. <b>They</b> really <b>thought</b> that <b>we</b> could sell some records. <b>They</b> really <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> could mass market Trip Shakespeare.|$|R
5000|$|However, in Hip Hop, {{today the}} term break refers to any segment of music (usually four {{measures}} or less) {{that could be}} sampled and repeated. A break is any expanse of music that is {{thought of as a}} break by a producer. In the words of DJ Jazzy Jay, [...] "Maybe those records breaks are sampled were ahead of their time. Maybe they were made specifically for the rap era; these people didn't know what they were making at that time. <b>They</b> <b>thought,</b> 'Oh, <b>we</b> want to make a jazz record'".|$|R
6000|$|... "No; {{because we}} are watchful and able to protect ourselves," [...] {{answered}} the captain. [...] "But this road leads to another village peopled by big, stupid beasts who might cause us trouble if <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> were afraid of them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I expect {{they would}} have tried to get us to surrender, by {{offering}} to let us pass if we would give them half of the gold <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> had with us. There is no chance of our being followed, I suppose, Dias?" ...|$|E
60|$|Felicity, Cecily, and Dan {{were sitting}} {{opposite}} us, staring at us when <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> {{would be too}} busy eating to see them. We tried to stare at them when THEY were eating; {{and as a result}} we were always catching each other at it and feeling cheap and embarrassed.|$|E
5000|$|... "So I had my West Mall getup, {{which was}} like a {{washboard}} and bongos. It wasn't very impressive, I'm sure. And Jeff had an upright and Davíd {{was trying to make}} cracks about Paul Simon. He thought Simon was on CBS, but actually he had just scored big with Rhythm of the Saints on Warner Bros., so those jokes were not funny. Everything Davíd said just fell to the floor and his voice got really tight and he couldn't sing very well; I'm sure <b>they</b> just <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> were ridiculous ultimately.|$|R
60|$|Up to {{this time}} the enemy had evidently failed to divine our intentions. From Columbus they could, of course, see our gunboats and {{transports}} loaded with troops. But the force from Paducah was threatening them from the land side, and it was hardly to be expected that if Columbus was our object we would separate our troops by a wide river. <b>They</b> doubtless <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> meant to draw a large force from the east bank, then embark ourselves, land on the east bank and make a sudden assault on Columbus before their divided command could be united.|$|R
6000|$|... "Wait," [...] he said, [...] "let us {{determine}} how many shall accompany us. It is not well that we be burdened by the women and children, for then indeed we might be overtaken by the Abyssinians. It would be far better to select a small guard of your bravest men, and leave word behind that we are riding WEST. Then, when the Abyssinians come they will be put upon the wrong trail should they have it in their hearts to pursue us, {{and if they do}} not they will at least ride north with less rapidity than as though <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>we</b> were ahead of them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{expected}} it so little, that I thought he meant some Richards; but no, he said Mr. Richard May, {{if he had}} nothing better in view--they liked him, and {{knew he was a}} very steady, good young gentleman, and if he took after his fathers that went before him--and <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> might like to have him settled near!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{thought the}} Colonial Office knew. We were {{confident}} that they knew. The Colonial Secretary had stated {{that he had been}} there. Later on it turned out that he meant Saskatchewan. Of course <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> knew. And we both thought that the Exchequer must know. We understood that they had collected a hut tax for ten years." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'In the High Street, {{round the}} corner. Crowds there; {{and here in}} our street only {{ourselves}} and a few men that hurried up after us. Mr. Audley shouted to them that we would get a ladder, but whether they could not hold on any more, or <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> were going quite away-- O Wilmet! I didn't see; but there was the most horrible thump and crash on the pavement.' ...|$|E
5000|$|Melaku {{left her}} family in her native Ethiopia to emigrate to Israel in 1984 {{at the age of}} 16. She recalls that her first defense of her rights in Israel was to insist on keeping her first name instead of {{adopting}} the Hebraicized [...] "Oshra", a name given to her on her arrival. [...] "When we arrived in Jerusalem, <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> that the people would greet us with open arms," [...] she remembers. [...] "But when we got here, everyone looked at us suspiciously and did not believe that we were really Jewish. I was shocked too, because I had never seen white Jews before. It was ironic really because <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>we</b> were the ones who weren't Jewish." ...|$|R
500|$|... "I {{had some}} criticisms of Dark Side of the Moon…" [...] noted David Gilmour. [...] "One {{or two of}} the {{vehicles}} carrying the ideas were not as strong as the ideas that <b>they</b> carried. I <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> should try and work harder on marrying the idea and the vehicle that carried it, so that they both had an equal magic… It's something I was personally pushing when we made Wish You Were Here." ...|$|R
60|$|So I {{went down}} the lines of our little force telling them the good news and showing them my plan. They listened and understood. We formed up, those who were left of us, not more than a {{thousand}} men perhaps, and advanced. The Easterns laughed when they saw us coming down the slope, for <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>we</b> were mad and that they would kill us every one, believing as they did that Peroa had no other army. When we were within bowshot we began to shoot, though sparingly, for but few arrows were left. Galled by our archery they marshalled their ranks to charge us again. With a shout we leapt forward to meet them, for now from the higher ground I saw the chariots of Peroa rushing to our rescue.|$|R
