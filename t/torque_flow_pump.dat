Torque tlow pumps yield to centrifugal pumps in terms of efficiency, but also provide reliable and continuous work throughout the period of operation. To estimate {{the reliability of the}} pump work it is necessary to focus attention on their cavitation qualities. To ensure in reliable continuous operation of the pumps it is requires to estimate numerically the degree of cavitation growth, as well as features of its origin. To perform the calculation it was constructed the computational domain, which consists of a free camera and the impeller. At the initial stage, we calculated the How in free of cavitation mode for single-phase medium using a standard k-r, turbulence model. In the next step we calculated the model of How with cavitation. This calculation is performed {{in a wide range of}} static pressures at the pump inlet. As a result of the calculation, the areas of origin and growth of cavitation were defined in the How part of the <b>torque</b> <b>flow</b> <b>pump</b> at different values of NPSH and the cavitation characteristic of the pump was obtained. The results of numerical studies are confirmed by the physical experiments taking place earlier. When you are citing the document, use the following link [URL]...|$|E
40|$|A torque {{converter}} was tested at four turbine/pump rotational speed ratios (0. 200, 0. 400, 0. 600, and 0. 800) {{all with a}} constant pump rotational speed {{in order to determine}} the effect of speed ratio on the <b>torque</b> converter <b>pump</b> <b>flow</b> field. Laser velocimetry was used to measure three components of velocity within the pump and a shaft encoder was employed to record the instantaneous pump angular position. Shaft encoder information was correlated with measured velocities to develop flow field blade-to-blade profiles and vector plots. Measurements were obtained in both the pump mid- and exit planes for all four speed ratios. Results showed large separation regions and jet/wake <b>flows</b> throughout the <b>pump.</b> The midplane <b>flow</b> was found to have strong counter-clockwise secondary components and the exit plane flow had strong clockwise secondary components. Mass flows were calculated from the velocity data and were found to decrease as the speed ratio was increased. Also, the vorticity and slip factors were calculated from the experimental data and are included. The mid-plane slip factors compare favorably to those for conventional centrifugal pumps but less slip was present in the exit plane than the mid-plane. Neither the slip factor nor the vorticity were seen to be strongly affected by the speed ratio. Finally, the torque core-to-shell and blade-to-blade torque distributions are presented for both planes...|$|R
