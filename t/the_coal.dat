5|$|However, the peels will degrade {{over time}} if they contain any iron sulfide (pyrite or marcasite). Shya Chitaley {{addressed}} {{this problem by}} revising the liquid-peel technique to separate the organic material preserved by <b>the</b> <b>coal</b> ball from the inorganic minerals, including iron sulfide. This allows the peel to retain its quality for a longer time. Chitaley's revisions begin after grinding the surface of <b>the</b> <b>coal</b> ball to a smooth finish. Her process essentially entails heating and then making multiple applications of solutions of paraffin in xylene to <b>the</b> <b>coal</b> ball. Each subsequent application has a greater concentration of paraffin in xylene to allow the wax to completely pervade <b>the</b> <b>coal</b> ball. Nitric acid, and then acetone, are applied to <b>the</b> <b>coal</b> ball. Following that, the process merges back into the liquid peel technique.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 19th century, {{scientific}} investigation began to indicate that the Glamorgan valleys were rich with coal deposits. Bute, who already owned coal mines in County Durham, commissioned further surveys in 1817 and 1823–24 which showed that there were potentially huge profits to be made from the reserves, both from <b>the</b> <b>coal</b> sitting beneath Bute's own lands, but also from <b>the</b> <b>coal</b> under common lands in the region that Bute could claim through his feudal titles. Bute set about consolidating his rights and existing investments during the late 1820s and 1830s, acquiring extensive rights to the coalfields in the process. Bute established and managed a few colleries – such as that at Rhigos – directly, but given the investment costs and attention they took up, generally preferred to lease out his coal fields and claim a royalty on <b>the</b> <b>coal</b> mined instead. The lessees might be iron-masters, who used <b>the</b> <b>coal</b> in their own operations, or colliery owners who sold <b>the</b> <b>coal</b> on to industrial or domestic customers. The profits increased from £872 {{in the second half of}} 1826, to £10,756 in 1848–49.|$|E

40|$|Blends {{of three}} Australian coking coals and polypropylene, polystyrene, {{polyacrylonitrile}} and polyphenylene sulfide were prepared {{and the extent}} to which the blends fused on heating was monitored using proton magnetic resonance thermal analysis in order to identify interactions between them that could affect their fluidity. Different plastics had different effects. Polystyrene strongly reduced the fluidity of all of <b>the</b> <b>coals,</b> confirming previous findings. Polypropylene did not affect the fluidity of <b>the</b> two coking <b>coals</b> of lower rank. Polyphenylene sulfide reduced the fluidity of <b>the</b> <b>coals</b> at temperatures near the solidification temperature of <b>the</b> <b>coals,</b> and polyacrylonitrile appeared to increase the fluidity of <b>the</b> <b>coals</b> at temperatures near the softening temperature of <b>the</b> <b>coals.</b> <b>The</b> very different effects different plastics have on coal fluidity show that the interaction between plastics and coals must be carefully examined before plastics are added to coking coal blends...|$|R
