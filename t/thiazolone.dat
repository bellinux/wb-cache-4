40|$|AbstractThe crystal {{structure}} of the complex of transketolase and thiamine <b>thiazolone</b> diphosphate has been determined at 2. 3 Å resolution. The complex has a structure which closely resembles that of this enzyme with the cofactor ThDP. This {{is consistent with the}} observation that the binding of the analogue to transketolase involves ground state rather than transition state interactions. Since thiamine <b>thiazolone</b> diphosphate resembles an expected intermediate in the catalytic pathway, the {{structure of the}} intermediate was modelled from the {{crystal structure}}. Based on this model, enzymic groups responsible for binding of the intermediate and proton transfer during catalysis are suggested...|$|E
40|$|Pyruvate:ferredoxin {{oxidoreductase}} and the pyruvate dehydrogenase multi-enzyme complex both catalyse the CoA-dependent {{oxidative decarboxylation}} of pyruvate but differ in size, subunit composition and mechanism. Comparison of the pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase from the protozoon Trichomonas vaginalis and the pyruvate dehydrogenase {{component of the}} Escherichia coli pyruvate dehydrogenase complex shows that both are inactivated by incubation with pyruvate under aerobic conditions {{in the absence of}} co-substrates. However, only the former is irreversibly inhibited by incubation with hydroxypyruvate, and only the latter by incubation with bromopyruvate. Pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase activity is potently, but reversibly, inhibited by addition of bromopyruvate in the presence of CoA, and it is suggested that the mechanism involves formation of an adduct between CoA and bromopyruvate in the active site of the enzyme. It is proposed that both enzymes are inactivated by pyruvate through a mechanism involving oxidation of an enzyme-bound thiamin pyrophosphate/substrate adduct to form a tightly bound inhibitory species, possibly thiamin <b>thiazolone</b> pyrophosphate as hypothesized by Sumegi & Alkonyi...|$|E

40|$|The {{synthesis}} of an analog of Leucine enkephalin bearing a thioamide linkage in position 3 was accomplished. Attempts to couple thiodipeptides to amines by {{the means of}} activating their free carboxyl function was showed to give substituted <b>thiazolones</b> which were not found suitable for the {{synthesis of}} thiopeptides. Many attempts to generate new thioacylating aminoacid derivatives are described. Three types of variously substituted thioacylbenzoxazolinones were efficiently synthesized and showed good thioacylating properties. At {{least one of them}} fulfill all the requirements for performing thiopeptide synthesis on a routine basis when applied to chiral aminoacid residues...|$|R
40|$|Highly potent and {{selective}} inhibitors of neuronal {{nitric oxide synthase}} (nNOS) possessing a 2 -aminopyridine group were recently designed and synthesized in our laboratory and were shown to have significant in vivo efficacy. In this work, analogs of our lead compound possessing 2 - and 4 -aminothiazole rings {{in place of the}} aminopyridine were synthesized. The less basic aminothiazole rings will be less protonated at physiological pH than the aminopyridine ring, and so the molecule will carry a lower net charge. This could lead to an increased ability to cross the blood-brain barrier thereby increasing the in vivo potency of these compounds. The 2 -aminothiazole-based compound was less potent than the 2 -aminopyridine-based analogue. 4 -Aminothiazoles were unstable in water, undergoing tautomerization and hydrolysis to give inactive <b>thiazolones...</b>|$|R
40|$|A novel {{variable}} selection and modeling method based on prediction is developed {{to construct the}} quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) between the molecular electronegativity distance vector based on 13 atomic types and the biological activities {{of a set of}} selective cyclooxygenase- 2 inhibitory molecules, <b>thiazolone</b> and oxazolone series (TOS). Two parameters, the interrelation coefficient between the independent variables and the correlation coefficient in the leave-one-out cross-validation (q), are introduced into the classical all-subset regression to improve its searching course. Using multiple linear regression, a 4 -variable linear model for the data set of 21 TOSs is developed with the correlation coefficient of 0. 9248 and the root mean square error of 0. 283 in modeling stage and the coefficient of 0. 8849 and the error of 0. 351 in the leave-one-out validation step, respectively. To further test the predictive ability of the model, 15 TOS compounds are picked up from the set of 21 TOSs to construct a training set which is used to build a QSAR model and then the model is employed to predict the biological activities of the remaining compounds...|$|E
40|$|N-(4 -methoxyphenyl) -N-thiocarbamoyl-beta-alanine was {{synthesized}} and its reactions with monochloroacetic acid, chloroacetaldehyde and alpha-haloketones were investigated. These reactions provided several N,N-disubstituted beta-alanine derivatives containing thiazole moyiety. Chemical {{properties of}} 3 -[(4 -methoxyphenyl) (4 -oxo- 4, 5 -dihydrothiazol- 2 -yl) amino]propanoic acid have been determined: the methylene group hydrogens of <b>thiazolone</b> ring can be exchanged by bromine atoms, the condensation with aldehydes gave 5 -substituted thiazolones. 3 -[{ 4 -(4 -chlorophenyl) thiazol- 2 -yl}(4 -methoxyphenyl) amino]propanoic acid {{was treated with}} mixture of hydrobromic and acetic acids and the methoxy group was replaced into hydroxy. Chalcone-type derivatives with thiazole fragment in the molecule were prepared by condensation of 3 -[(5 -acetyl- 4 -methylthiazol- 2 -yl) (4 -methoxyphenyl) amino]propanoic acid with aromatic and hetrocyclic aldehydes. The reaction of 3 -[(5 -acetyl- 4 -methylthiazol- 2 -yl) (4 -methoxyphenyl) amino]propanoic acid with hydrazine monohydrate and phenylhydrazine afforded corresponding hydrazone derivatives. Moreover, in this work, the antibacterial activity of the synthesized derivatives was tested.

40|$|Bovine, {{human and}} porcine heart {{mitochondria}} and isolated porcine heart pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC) pyruvate-dependently form N-hydroxy-N-arylacetamides from nitroso aromatic compounds, including carcinogenic 4 -biphenyl and 2 -fluorenyl derivatives. The PDHC-catalysed formation of N-hydroxyacetanilide (N-OH-AA) from nitrosobenzene (NOB), through a Ping Pong mechanism, is optimum at pH 6. 8 and is accelerated by thiamin pyrophosphate, but is inhibited by thiamin <b>thiazolone</b> pyrophosphate and ATP. Km pyruvate in {{the reaction is}} independent of pH over the range tested, whereas KmNOB increases at lower pH, owing to ionization of an active-site functional group of pKa 6. 3. The enzymic ionization decreases log (Vmax/KmNOB). Isolated pyruvate dehydrogenase (E 1), a constitutive enzyme of PDHC, forms N-OH-AA by itself and has comparable kinetic parameters {{to those of the}} PDHC-catalysed N-OH-AA formation. The catalytic efficiency of PDHC in the formation of N-hydroxy-N-arylacylamides, due to the steric limitation of the active site of E 1, is lowered both by bulky alkyl groups of alpha-oxo acids and by p-substituents (but not an o-substituent) on nitrosobenzenes. These nitroso compounds serve as electrophiles in the reaction in which the reductive acetylation step is rate-limiting. The reaction mechanism and other factors affecting N-hydroxy-N-arylacylamide formation are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Reaction of 1, 3 -Thiazole- 5 (4 H) -thiones and Diazomethane. Reaction of 4, 4 -dimethyl- 1, 3 -thiazol- 5 (4 H) -thiones 1 with {{diazomethane}} in Et 2 O at - 78 ° or 0 ° {{leads to}} a mixture of the corresponding 1, 4 -dithiane 10, 1, 3 -dithiole 11, thiirane 12, 4, 5 -dihydro- 5 -methylidene- 1, 3 -thiazole 13, and 1, 3 -thiazol- 5 (4 H) -one 14 (Scheme 3). The structures of 10 a, 11 a, and 11 b have been established by X-ray crystallography. The formation of the products can be explained via an intermediate thiocarbonyl ylide of type E (Scheme 4), generated by the 1, 3 -dipolar cycloaddition of diazomethane with the exocyclic C=S bond of 1 and elimination of N 2. Head-to-head dimerization of E yields 10, 1, 3 -dipolar cycloaddition of E and 1 gives the 'Schönberg product' 11, and cyclization of E leads to 12, which undergoes a desulfurization to give 13. The <b>thiazolone</b> 14 is formed by hydrolysis of E. The similarity of {{the ratio of the}} products at - 78 ° and at O° shows that, in contrast to the reaction of 1 and 2 -diazopropane, the elimination of N 2 in the primary cycloadduct already occurs at - 78 °...|$|E
40|$|The {{extent of}} cooperativity among the {{polypeptide}} chain {{components in the}} overall reaction catalyzed by the pyruvate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex from Escherichia coli has been studied. Selective inactivation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase component with thiamin <b>thiazolone</b> pyrophosphate demonstrates that no cooperativity between this component and the overall catalytic reaction occurs: the amount of overall complex activity is directly proportional to the fraction of active pyruvate dehydrogenase component. The transacetylase component has two lipoic acid residues on each of its polypeptide chains that can be modified by N-[3 H]ethylmaleimide {{in the presence of}} pyruvate and thiamin pyrophosphate. The kinetics of the loss of overall complex activity due to modification of the lipoyl residues on the transacetylase component by maleimide reagents shows that not all lipoic acids are coupled into the overall catalytic reaction and that acyl-group and electron pair transfer involving two or more lipoic acids per catalytic cycle must occur. Finally, full complex activity is found when only half the normal flavin content is present. The results indicate that extensive communication among lipoic acids in acyl-group and electron pair transfer must exist in the normal catalytic mechanism. These results are consistent with the average distances between catalytic sites measured by energy transfer experiments...|$|E
