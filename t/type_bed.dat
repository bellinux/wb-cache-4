5000|$|George Phineas Gordon (April 21, 1810 [...] - [...] January 27, 1878) was an American inventor, printer and {{businessman}} {{who developed the}} basic design {{of the most common}} printing press ever, the Gordon Letterpress.Born in Salem, New Hampshire, where his family had lived for more than one hundred years, he was educated there and at Boston before deciding to become an actor. Failing to achieve a livelihood at this, he moved to New York where he became an apprentice printer. Upon learning the trade, he opened a job printing shop of his own. Around 1835 he began to experiment in press design. His first patent for a job-press was granted in 1851. While this press had many flaws, he began to manufacture it as the [...] "Yankee" [...] job press. Subsequently he introduced the [...] "Turnover" [...] and the [...] "Firefly," [...] which could produce 10,000 printed cards an hour. About 1858 he produced the [...] "Franklin" [...] press, which has ever since been known as the Gordon Jobber. (Gordon claimed that Benjamin Franklin had revealed the basic design of the press to him in a dream.) It was strong, well built, and easy to operate. The Gordon Press solved the problem of clam-shell presses (which previously had [...] "snapped" [...] and endangered pressmen's fingers) by having the platen open on cams, so that it was flat and lagged for the pressman as he fed the sheet, before closing parallel to the <b>type</b> <b>bed.</b>|$|E

40|$|Aims: Compare {{the rate}} of growth of four {{microbial}} strains that cause disease in the equine, on four commonly used <b>types</b> of <b>bedding.</b> The moisture holding capacity of each <b>bedding</b> <b>type</b> was also tested. Methods and results: Microbial strains included, Streptococcus equi, Streptococcus zooepidemicus, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Dichelobacter nodosus and Dermatophilus congolensis. The <b>bedding</b> <b>types</b> tested were Pinus syvestrus (Scots pine shavings), Pinus nigra (Corsican pine shavings), Picea sitchensis (Sitka spruce shavings), Cannabis sativa (hemp) and chopped wheat straw. A suspension of each microbial strain was spread in triplicate on agar media and incubated in its optimal growth conditions. The viable count (colony forming unit per ml) was determined for each bacterial strain for the five different <b>bedding</b> <b>types.</b> Pinus syvestrus <b>bedding</b> resulted in significantly less (p= 0. 001) bacterial growth of all strains tested. Conclusions: Factors resulting in the inhibition of bacterial growth include the anti-bacterial effects reported in the Pinacea family and the physical properties of the bedding substrate. Research is currently focussed on the diagnosis and management of disease. Prevention of disease is also important for matters of biosecurity. Strategies should include the provision of a hygienic environment and the use of specific <b>types</b> of <b>bedding.</b> Significance and impact of the study; Bedding choice has implications for global equine health and disease prevention as well as potential benefits in other animal species...|$|R

In this research, an experimental study was carried out to investigate the hydraulic roughness characteristics in an open channel. The experimental flume (10 m length, 0. 30 m width and 0. 46 height) was carried out with two conditions; contain gravel bed and without gravel bed (as controller). Blocks of concrete foam were fabricated and laid on the bed surface for providing uniformly roughened along the open channel. A velocity flow meter was used to quantify the average velocity, and other parameters such as cross-section, hydraulic radius, wetted perimeter, and channel slopes were also calculated. Finally, the flow resistance, n obtained using the flume with gravel bed surface {{is higher than the}} flume without gravel bed surface. The flow conditions were declared as subcritical as the Froude number is less than 1 for both conditions in the flume. As a conclusion, it was identified that the hydraulic roughness n, was influenced by the <b>type</b> <b>bed</b> roughness, flow rate and channel slope...|$|E
30|$|Downhole {{geophysical}} {{borehole logging}} is an in situ nondestructive process of measuring the physical, chemical, and structural properties of penetrated geological formations and surrounding borehole annulus. The technique involves lowering of sonde (probe) into a borehole using suspended armored cable or wire device called wireline or logging cable. The logging cable {{is connected to}} the winch and transmits recorded signals to the digital computers for data visualization, monitoring, and recording. The measured subsurface properties are dependent on the type of the lowered probe. Geophysical logs have been widely used, especially in petroleum industry, as tools in unraveling information on aquifer and fluid characteristics, paleo-hydrogeology, and correlation and distribution of subsurface sedimentary strata. Because geophysical logging is a repeatable and comparable process, {{it can be used to}} provide continuous in situ information on the subsurface rock <b>type,</b> <b>bed</b> thickness, permeability, porosity, bulk density, resistivity, and the nature of saturating fluids (Hallenburg 1987; Repsold 1989; Mares et al. 1994; Keys 1997; Buckley 2000; Hearst et al. 2000; Buckley et al. 2001). In addition, geophysical logs can confirm the completion details, identify the individual water inflows, characterize salinity and freshness, determine freshwater–saline water interface, and identify problems in cased boreholes (Buckley et al. 2001). It can therefore act as a guide in borehole designs and rehabilitating process of damaged boreholes.|$|E

Paper <b>bedding</b> <b>types</b> contained significantly less endotoxin than did other bedding types; {{the highest levels of}} endotoxin were detected in hardwood and corncob beddings. The range of endotoxin content for each <b>bedding</b> <b>type</b> was: corncob <b>bedding,</b> 1913 to 4504 endotoxin units per gram (EU/g); hardwood bedding, 3121 to 5401 EU/g; corncob–paper mixed bedding, 1586 to 2416 EU/g; and paper bedding, less than 5 to 105 EU/g. Coliform counts varied from less than 10 to 7591 cfu/g in corncob beddings, 90 to 4010 cfu/g in corncob–paper mixed beddings, less than 10 to 137 cfu/g in hardwood beddings, and less than 10 cfu/g in paper beddings. Average dust content was less than 0. 15 % in all commercial <b>bedding</b> <b>types.</b> We conclude that paper bedding is the optimal <b>bedding</b> <b>type</b> for conducting LPS inhalation studies and that rodent bedding containing high levels of endotoxin may alter the results of respiratory and immunologic studies in rodents...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{potential}} of syngas production from used- and unused-plastic-waste Refuse-Derived Fuels (RDFs) by downdraft <b>type</b> fixed <b>bed</b> gasification technology is investigated. The {{purpose of this}} study is to investigate the syngas compositions of used- and unused-plastic-waste RDFs in the downdraft <b>type</b> fixed <b>bed</b> gasification system. It is found that used- and unused-plastic-waste RDFs can be successfully converted to generate the syngas consisting of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, hydrocarbon, hydrogen sulfide oxygen and water vapor. The performance of the downdraft <b>type</b> fixed <b>bed</b> gasification system is evaluated in terms of the composition of syngas and the rate of carbon monoxide production. The result can be concluded that syngas produced from the used- and unused-plastic-waste RDFs is the same. The HHV (Higher Heating Value) of the syngas from the unused-plastic-waste RDF (781 kJ/Nm 3) is slightly higher than that of the used one (500 kJ/Nm 3). It is also suggested that the gasification of used- and unused-plastic-waste RDFs is a clean alternative to fossil fuels. Moreover, the syngas can be directly used in the internal gas combustion engines...|$|R
40|$|Continental shelf sediments are {{globally}} {{important for}} biogeochemical activity. Quantification of shelf-scale stocks and fluxes of carbon and nutrients requires the extrapolation of observations made at limited points {{in space and}} time. The procedure for selecting exemplar sites to {{form the basis of}} this up-scaling is discussed in relation to a UK-funded research programme investigating biogeochemistry in shelf seas. A three-step selection process is proposed in which (1) a target area representative of UK shelf sediment heterogeneity is selected, (2) the target area is assessed for spatial heterogeneity in sediment and habitat <b>type,</b> <b>bed</b> and water column structure and hydrodynamic forcing, and (3) study sites are selected within this target area encompassing the range of spatial heterogeneity required to address key scientific questions regarding shelf scale biogeochemistry, and minimise confounding variables. This led to the selection of four sites within the Celtic Sea that are significantly different in terms of their sediment, bed structure, and macrofaunal, meiofaunal and microbial community structures and diversity, but have minimal variations in water depth, tidal and wave magnitudes and directions, temperature and salinity. They form the basis of a research cruise programme of observation, sampling and experimentation encompassing the spring bloom cycle. Typical variation in key biogeochemical, sediment, biological and hydrodynamic parameters over a pre to post bloom period are presented, with a discussion of anthropogenic influences in the region. This methodology ensures the best likelihood of site-specific work being useful for up-scaling activities, increasing our understanding of benthic biogeochemistry at the UK-shelf scale...|$|E
40|$|Results are {{presented}} {{from a number}} of fire experiments that were conducted in a room environment to study the fire characteristics of typical residential furnishings and assist in the design of a subsequent phase of a project involving fully furnished room fire experiments. The experiments were conducted in a 16 -m 2 test room (with dimensions 3. 8 m wide 74. 2 m long 72. 4 m high), which had a 1. 571. 5 -m window opening. The furnishings tested included mattresses, bed clothes, bed assemblies, upholstered seating furniture, clothing arrangements, books, plastic audio/video media and storage cases, toys, shoes, and a computer workstation setup. The smoke (gaseous products of combustion) from the room was collected using a hood system in order to measure the heat release rate (HRR) and optical density of the smoke. The test room was instrumented with load cells, heat flux gauges, thermocouples and velocity probes in order to take the following measurements: mass loss, total heat flux on gauge-installed flush with the internal surfaces (floor, walls, and ceiling), temperatures at numerous locations, and gas velocities in the window opening. Twin-size mattresses produced peak HRRs of approximately 3800 kW, and the maximum room temperature was approximately 9800 C. The HRRs of bed assemblies of various sizes and configurations ranged from 1800 kW for a twin-size bed to 6250 kW for a bunk bed. The maximum temperature and heat flux recorded in the experiments were 10710 C and 221 kW/m 2, respectively. Upholstered chairs and sofas had HRRs ranging from 630 kW for an ottoman to 3360 kW for a two-seat sofa. In tests with clothing, toys, shoes, books, a computer workstation, and CD/DVD media, the peak HRRs ranged from 440 kW for a bookcase to 2045 kW for toys. Furnishings containing a large proportion of rigid thermoplastic plastics, such as shoes and media cases, produced very dense smoke even at low HRRs. The effect of parameters such as bed clothes, mattress type, foundation <b>type,</b> <b>bed</b> assembly and chair size, material composition, and fuel package arrangement was evident in the results. Because the room dimensions and wall lining materials remained constant, temperatures were linearly proportional to the peak HRR (and exposure time) until the ventilation limit (approximately 4100 kW) was reached. 9 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

40|$|A {{large number}} of {{low-rise}} non-ductile masonry (unreinforced and partially reinforced) and reinforced concrete shear walls were built before seismic provisions have been introduced in modern building codes. During seismic evaluation of existing buildings, such walls are frequently found to be in need of seismic retrofit. This research investigates the in-plane cyclic inelastic behaviour of such low-rise walls, {{as well as that}} of comparable walls retrofitted using steel strips. Four concrete block masonry and two reinforced concrete walls of large scale were subjected to combined constant gravity load and incrementally increasing lateral deformation reversals. All the walls had an aspect ratio of 1. 0 and a height of 1800 mm. Masonry walls had a thickness of 190 mm, and concrete walls 100 mm. They were designed to simulate walls built using provisions in effect decades ago, before the enactment of earthquake-resistant design provisions. The first pair of masonry walls were unreinforced (URM), and the second pair were partially reinforced masonry (PRM). Three # 15 reinforcing bars, one in each exterior cell and one in the central cell, were used in the vertical direction of the PRM walls. One truss <b>type</b> <b>bed</b> joint reinforcement, No. 8 gauge, was placed in mortar joints every two courses. Each concrete wall was reinforced using 3 pairs of 9. 5 mm reinforcing bars, uniformly distributed along the length, in both directions. One wall from each pair was retrofitted using a steel strip system. The steel strip system consists of diagonal (220 x 3. 81 mm) and vertical (80 x 3. 81) strips attached to the walls using through-thickness bolts. Stiff steel angles and anchor bolts were used to connect the steel strips to the foundation and the top loading beam. The unretrofitted walls had a relatively low shear strength. However, the URM wall exhibited a very stable rocking response at an in-plane load of 61 kN. The PRM wall exhibited a non-ductile shear failure at a maximum load of 120 kN. The reinforced concrete wall showed flexural failure at 171 kN with buckling of the end re-bars. The ultimate strength of the retrofitted URM, PRM and R/C walls were respectively 7, 3. 8 and 2. 9 times that of the unretrofitted walls. These tests show that the steel-strip system is most effective to significantly increase the in-plane strength and ductility of low-rise unreinforced and partially reinforced masonry walls, and lightly reinforced concrete walls. The tests also demonstrated that the desirable in-plane rocking behaviour, observed in unreinforced brick masonry walls by other researchers, can also develop in concrete block walls. In the analytical part of this research, a truss model was developed for analysis of retrofitted low-rise walls. This model consists of an indeterminate truss having five members each representing part of the retrofitted wall. A step-by-step calculation procedure was used to find strength and deformation of each wall. The results of this analytical model were in good agreement with experimental results reported in this study. Based on this model a displacement based design procedure is proposed as a simple design procedure that may be used for retrofitting existing non-ductile low-rise walls. This design procedure proved to be easy and effective...|$|E
