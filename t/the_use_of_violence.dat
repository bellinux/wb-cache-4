5|$|In {{matters of}} self-defence, {{different}} interpretations of ancient Hindu texts have been offered. For example, Tähtinen suggests self-defence is appropriate, criminals are not {{protected by the}} rule of Ahimsa, and Hindu scriptures support <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> against an armed attacker. Ahimsa {{is not meant to}} imply pacifism.|$|E
5|$|In April 1858, Tubman was {{introduced}} to the abolitionist John Brown, an insurgent who advocated <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> to destroy slavery in the United States. Although she never advocated violence against whites, she agreed with his course of direct action and supported his goals. Like Tubman, he spoke of being called by God, and trusted the divine to protect him from the wrath of slaveholders. She, meanwhile, claimed to have had a prophetic vision of meeting Brown before their encounter.|$|E

During this time period, he was recalled by his religious superiors to Lima, where they questioned his arming the Asháninka, because of {{the view that the}} Catholic Church should not use violence. Gagnon responded that the Church had resorted to <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> in the past, and should not be hypocritical.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> state-sponsored <b>violence</b> against <b>the</b> {{union was}} widespread. President Woodrow Wilson's stroke, however, {{prevented}} federal officials from meeting steelmakers' demands to use federal troops {{to put down}} the strike. State and local authorities did intervene, and encouraged <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> widespread <b>violence</b> against <b>the</b> union. State militia violence was so bad that the U.S. Army was forced to occupy Gary, Indiana.|$|R
40|$|This study {{tests the}} ‘control-collaboration’ model {{detailed}} by Stathis Kalyvas in 'The Logic <b>of</b> <b>Violence</b> in Civil War '(2006). The control-collaboration model makes various theoretical claims {{on the relationship}} between territorial control and <b>the</b> <b>use</b> and motivations <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> (whether selective or indiscriminate). This study tests two of the key claims made in the model: 1. There is an inverse relationship between level of territorial control and <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> indiscriminate violence; and, 2. The loss off territory encourages <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> indiscriminate <b>violence.</b> <b>Using</b> data on civilian and child deaths taken from the ‘Syrian Martyr Database’, this study examines the relationship between territorial control and territorial loss, and <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> indiscriminate <b>violence</b> by incumbent (Syrian state) forces. Examining the levels of territorial control/loss and the extent of civilian and child casualties in Aleppo, Syria, results of the study largely support the theoretical assumptions outlined by Kalyvas. ...|$|R
5|$|The late Republic saw an {{increase}} in the centralisation of power into the hands of provincial governors, the use of military power to enforce political changes (e.g. the Sullan dictatorship), and <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence,</b> combined with exploitation of the suitably bribed or intimidated 'sovereign' assemblies, to grant supreme authority to victorious commanders. The increasing legitimisation of violence and centralisation of authority into fewer and fewer men would, with the collapse of trust in the Republic's institutions, put it on a path to civil war and its transformation into the autocratic Roman Empire.|$|E
5|$|Nonviolent Communication {{is based}} on the idea that all human beings have the {{capacity}} for compassion and only resort to violence or behavior that harms others when they do not recognize more effective strategies for meeting needs. Habits of thinking and speaking that lead to <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> (psychological and physical) are learned through culture. NVC theory supposes all human behavior stems from attempts to meet universal human needs and that these needs are never in conflict. Rather, conflict arises when strategies for meeting needs clash. NVC proposes that if people can identify their needs, the needs of others, and the feelings that surround these needs, harmony can be achieved.|$|E
5|$|Studio Ghibli {{released}} {{an adaptation of}} the series in 2006 titled Tales from Earthsea. The film very loosely combines elements of the first, third, and fourth books into a new story. Le Guin commented with displeasure on the film-making process, saying that she had acquiesced to the adaptation believing Hayao Miyazaki would be producing the film himself, which was eventually not the case. Le Guin praised the imagery of the film, but disliked <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence.</b> She also expressed dissatisfaction with the portrayal of morality, {{and in particular the}} use of a villain who could be slain as a means of resolving conflict, which she said was antithetical to the message of the book. The film received generally mixed responses.|$|E

40|$|In a cross-cultural, cross-temporal comparison, Ana Mitrovici juxtaposes {{the ritual}} games and {{spectacles}} of the Romans and the Aztecs. The display of conquered peoples by imperial powers is commonly {{examined in the}} light of post-colonial theories about power struggles and identity. In addition, with a spectacle like those examined here, the deliberate injection of peripheral images into the center of power shows the centers construction of power and self-identity very clearly. Using her comparison to show the functions of spectacle in imperial identity formation, Mitrovici highlights some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> and display within a borderlands complex...|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence,</b> {{with scores}} dead and injured, is totally {{incompatible}} with the policies and principles of any social democratic party anywhere in the world.

We are, as of today, ceasing the membership of the NDP, however we remain determined to cooperate with all the democrats in Egypt striving to achieve an open, democratic, inclusive and secular state.|$|E
5|$|After the Second Punic War, {{there was}} a great {{increase}} in income inequality. While the middle class was drafted to serve in increasingly long campaigns, their farms and homesteads fell into bankruptcy. And with Rome's great military victories, vast numbers of slaves were imported into Italy. In the middle of the second century BC, the tribunate of Tiberius Gracchus led to a breakup of the long-standing norms of the republican constitution. Graccus' legislation effectively established a parallel administration challenging the socio-political power of the old aristocracy and establishing a precedent that the popular assemblies could vote themselves whatever they wanted. His younger brother, Gaius Gracchus, further challenged the Senate's political preeminence, by threatening it with new judicial procedures. The Senate's violent reaction against both the Gracchi, which led to their deaths, also served to legitimise <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> for political ends.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the years}} {{scholars}} have postulated {{a number of}} theories about what Stowe {{was trying to say}} with the novel (aside from the obvious themes, such as condemning slavery). For example, as an ardent Christian and active abolitionist, Stowe placed many of her religious beliefs into the novel. Some scholars have stated that Stowe saw her novel as offering a solution to the moral and political dilemma that troubled many slavery opponents: whether engaging in prohibited behavior was justified in opposing evil. Was <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> to oppose the violence of slavery and the breaking of proslavery laws morally defensible? Which of Stowe's characters should be emulated, the passive Uncle Tom or the defiant George Harris? Stowe's solution was similar to Ralph Waldo Emerson's: God's will would be followed if each person sincerely examined his principles and acted on them.|$|E

5|$|The Great Silence was one {{of several}} Spaghetti Westerns {{produced}} between 1967 and 1968, along with Enzo G. Castellari's Kill Them All and Come Back Alone and One Dollar Too Many, Sergio Sollima's Run, Man, Run and Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West, to be showcased in Patrick Morin's made-for-television documentary Western, Italian Style. During the making of the film, Corbucci and Trintignant were interviewed; Corbucci discussed the nature of violence in his films and Spaghetti Westerns in general (comparing <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> in such films to the James Bond franchise), while Trintignant spoke of the unusual nature of his role and how he would practice drawing his gun – by pulling a sock (substituting for the gloves Silence wears in the film) off his hand and reaching for a long-steamed artichoke in his pocket.|$|E

40|$|Fifty-two years {{separate}} the fatal shootings by police of 69 anti-apartheid protestors at Sharpeville on 21 st March 1960 and of 34 striking miners at Marikana on 16 th August 2012. The {{parallels between the}} two ‘massacres’ are easy to overstate; but both involved <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> lethal <b>violence</b> by <b>the</b> police against people taking part in insurrectionary action. Drawing on Marenin’s (1982) work on the relative autonomy of the police, this paper argues that events at Marikana have {{to be seen in}} the context of South Africa’s failure to tackle the structural <b>violence</b> <b>of</b> apartheid and <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> direct, personal <b>violence</b> by the police before and since the country became a constitutional democracy in 1994...|$|R
40|$|This paper aims {{to analyze}} the {{conditions}} that {{paved the way for}} left-wing armed organizations during the 1960 ’s and 1970 ’s in Argentina. To achieve this goal, firstly, we will discuss the political conditions that triggered the popular reactive violence and subsequently the rationalized violence led by the guerilla organizations of the time. Secondly, we will discuss the socioeconomic determinants that could have motivated the origins of these organizations; and we will talk about whether Argentina was actually undergoing a deep economic crisis or if this point of view worked as a way to justify the origins of the armed struggle. At last, we will analyze some artistic productions developed during these years, having in mind that they can help understanding the assimilation that the revolutionary armed project of these organizations had and <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence's</b> legitimacy to intervene in politics...|$|R
