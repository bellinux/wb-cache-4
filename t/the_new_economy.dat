5|$|Beginning in March 2013, the {{majority}} of the airline's fleet will be retrofitted with new Business and Economy Class seats. The seats are nearly identical to the new Regional Business Class and new Long-haul Economy Class products offered by parent company Cathay Pacific. Seats in both classes will be fitted with StudioKA (a rebranded version of the StudioCX inflight entertainment system on board Cathay Pacific aircraft), which features a 12.1-inch (Business Class) or 9-inch (Economy Class) touchscreen display, Audio/Video on Demand (AVOD), support for iOS devices, and a USB port for connectivity to other devices. In-seat power outlets will be available to all passengers. The new Business Class will feature a 21-inch wide recliner seat with 45 inches (narrowbody aircraft) or 47 inches (widebody aircraft) of pitch, while <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>Economy</b> Class will be 18.1 inches wide with 30 inches (narrowbody aircraft) or 32 inches (widebody aircraft) of pitch. The retrofitting process is expected to be complete by the end of 2014.|$|E

25|$|Greenspan entered {{government}} in the 70s, and became Chairman of the Federal Reserve. In 1992, he visited the newly elected Bill Clinton. He persuaded him to let the markets grow, cut taxes, and to let the markets stabilise themselves {{with the help of}} computer technology, to create <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>economy.</b> This involved using computer models to predict risks and hedge against them, in accordance with the Californian Ideology. However, by 1996, the production figures had failed to increase, but profits were nevertheless rising, and Greenspan suggested that it wasn't working. After political attacks from all sides, Greenspan changed his mind and decided that perhaps <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Economy</b> was real after all, but that it couldn't be measured using normal economic measures, and so the apparent boom continued.|$|E

25|$|After the Yongle Emperor's {{overthrow}} of the Jianwen Emperor, China's countryside was devastated. The fragile new economy {{had to deal with}} low production and depopulation. The Yongle Emperor laid out a long and extensive plan to strengthen and stabilise <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>economy,</b> but first he had to silence dissension. He created an elaborate system of censors to remove corrupt officials from office that spread such rumors. The emperor dispatched some of his most trusted officers to reveal or destroy secret societies, bandits, and loyalists to his other relatives. To strengthen the economy, he fought population decline by reclaiming land, utilising the most he could from the existing labour force, and maximising textile and agricultural production.|$|E

25|$|Set {{against a}} {{backdrop}} of rapid economic development and social changes in post-Mao China, the protests reflected anxieties about the country's future in the popular consciousness and among the political elite. The reforms of the 1980s had led to a nascent market economy which benefitted some people but seriously disaffected others; the one-party political system also faced a challenge of legitimacy. Common grievances at the time included inflation, limited preparedness of graduates for <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>economy,</b> and restrictions on political participation. The students called for democracy, greater accountability, freedom of the press, and freedom of speech, though they were loosely organized and their goals varied. At the height of the protests, about a million people assembled in the Square.|$|E
25|$|Poetry {{and cruelty}} of life were harmonically {{combined}} {{in the works}} that Vittorio De Sica wrote and directed together with screenwriter Cesare Zavattini: among them, Shoeshine (1946), The Bicycle Thief (1948) and Miracle in Milan (1951). The 1952 film Umberto D. showed a poor old man with his little dog, who must beg for alms against his dignity in the loneliness of the new society. This work is perhaps De Sica's masterpiece {{and one of the}} most important works in Italian cinema. It was not a commercial success and since then it has been shown on Italian television only a few times. Yet it is perhaps the most violent attack, in the apparent quietness of the action, against the rules of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>economy,</b> the new mentality, the new values, and it embodies both a conservative and a progressive view.|$|E
25|$|Migration from Mongolia to the United Kingdom is {{a fairly}} recent {{phenomenon}} that is directly connected to {{the political and social}} changes that have taken place in Mongolia in the late 20th/ early 21st century. During the mid-1900s the only significant Mongolian diaspora existed in the former Soviet Union due to strong ties with each respective nation. However, after 1991 when the Soviet Union collapsed and began to form a democratic nation, migration trends from Mongolia began to change and the movement of Mongolians {{to other parts of the}} world (including the UK) became much more evident. Following these major changes to the political composition of Mongolia, many citizens of the nation found that they struggled in <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>economy,</b> many subsequently left the country in search of new lives in the United States and Western Europe. Migration to the UK specifically began in the 1990s and has continued ever since, the majority of Mongolians who moved to the UK in the 1990s were economic migrants who intended to earn money to support themselves and their family back home, in contrast to most migrants who moved to the UK prior to the year 2000 who were largely students seeking better standards of higher education. Evidence of a more established community has come to light in the increasing number of Mongolian-run bars, cafés, shops and organisations in the UK.|$|E
