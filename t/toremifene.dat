50|$|<b>Toremifene</b> (<b>toremifene</b> citrate; {{see figure}} 8), {{chemically}} designated as 2-(p-(Z)-4-chloro-1,2-diphenyl-1-butenylphenoxy)-N,N-dimethylethylamine citrate, is a chlorinated derivative of the nonsteroidal triphenylethylene antiestrogen tamoxifen with a chloro substituent at the ethylene side chain producing similar binding affinities {{to that of}} tamoxifen. The structure and activity relationship of <b>toremifene</b> {{is similar to that}} of tamoxifen, but it has a substantial improvement from the older drug in regards to DNA alkylation. The presence of the added chlorine atom reduces the stability of cations formed from activated allylic metabolites and thus decreases alkylation potential, and indeed <b>toremifene</b> does not display DNA adduct formation in rodent hepatocytes. <b>Toremifene</b> protects against bone loss in ovariectomized rat models and affects bone resorption markers clinically in a similar fashion to tamoxifen. <b>Toremifene</b> undergoes phase I metabolism by microsomal cytochrome P450 enzymes, like tamoxifen, but primarily by the CYP3A4 isoform. <b>Toremifene</b> forms its two major metabolites N-desmethyltoremifene and deaminohydroxy-toremifene (ospemifene) by undergoing N-demethylation and deamination-hydroxylation. N-desmethyltoremifene has similar efficacy as <b>toremifene</b> while 4-hydroxytoremifene has a higher binding affinity to the ER than <b>toremifene.</b> 4-hydroxytoremifene has a role similar to that of 4-hydroxytamoxifen.|$|E

50|$|Few {{tamoxifen}} {{users have}} suffered from increased rates of uterine cancer, hot flushes, and thromboembolisms. The drug can also cause hepatocarcinomas in rats. This is likely due to the ethyl group of the tamoxifen stilbene core that is subject to allylic oxidative activation causing DNA alkylation and strand scission. This problem is later corrected in <b>toremifene.</b> Tamoxifen is more promiscuous than raloxifene in target sites because {{of the relationship between}} ER's amino acid in Asp-351 and the antiestrogenic side chain of the SERM. The side chain for tamoxifen cannot neutralize Asp-351, so the site allosterically influences AF-1 at the proximal end of the ER. This issue is mended with the second generation drug raloxifene.|$|E
50|$|Selective {{estrogen}} receptor modulators (SERMs) are {{an important}} class of hormonal therapy agents which act as antagonists of the estrogen receptor and are used primarily for the treatment and chemoprevention of breast cancer. Some members of this family, such as tamoxifen, are actually partial agonists, which can actually increase estrogen receptor signalling in some tissues, such as the endometrium. Tamoxifen is currently first-line treatment for nearly all pre-menopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. Raloxifene is another partial agonist SERM which {{does not seem to}} promote endometrial cancer, and is used primarily for chemoprevention of breast cancer in high-risk individuals, as well as to prevent osteoporosis. <b>Toremifene</b> and fulvestrant are SERMs with little or no agonist activity, and are used for treatment of metastatic breast cancer.|$|E
50|$|It {{was another}} {{ten years before}} {{tamoxifen}} was approved in December 1977, not as a contraceptive but as a hormonal treatment to treat and prevent breast cancer. The discovery in 1987 that the SERMs tamoxifen and raloxifene, then thought to be antiestrogens because of antagonist effects in breast tissue, showed estrogenic effects in preventing bone loss in ovariectomized rats had a great effect on {{our understanding of the}} function of estrogen receptors and nuclear receptors in general. The term SERM was introduced to describe these compounds that have a combination of estrogen agonist, partial agonist, or antagonist activities depending on the tissue. <b>Toremifene</b> {{has been shown to be}} compatible with tamoxifen, and in 1996 it was approved for use in the treatment of breast cancer in postmenopausal women.|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: Expression of P-glycoprotein (Pgp), which confers the multidrug {{resistance}} (MDR) phenotype, {{is thought to}} contribute to the insensitivity of renal cell cancer (RCC) to chemotherapy. The development of Pgp inhibitors for clinical application has been hampered by unacceptable toxicity at doses required to achieve adequate cellular concentration. <b>Toremifene</b> is able to reverse MDR and sensitise RCC to vinblastine in vitro. However, in vivo <b>toremifene</b> is tightly bound to serum proteins, in particular the acute phase protein alpha 1 -acid glycoprotein (AAG), which may limit tissue availability. In this phase I-II study we assessed the tolerability of short courses of high dose <b>toremifene</b> in combination with vinblastine and evaluated the key determinants of MDR reversal in vivo. METHODS: Twenty-seven patients with metastatic RCC received escalating doses of oral <b>toremifene</b> for 3 days every 2 weeks in combination with vinblastine 6 mg/m 2 i. v. on day 3 of each cycle. The serum concentration of <b>toremifene,</b> its metabolites and AAG were measured and the effect of patients' serum on inhibition of Pgp in vitro was determined. RESULTS: Twenty-six patients were evaluable for response. Eight patients (31 %) had stable disease and 18 patients (69 %) progressive disease. The mean serum concentration of <b>toremifene</b> at 780 mg daily for 3 days was 7. 82 microM [standard deviation (SD) 2. 48, range 2. 50 to 14. 70], which exceeds that known to reverse MDR in vitro. The serum concentration of the major metabolite of <b>toremifene,</b> N-demethyltoremifene, which also reverses MDR, was 5. 13 microM (SD 1. 78, range 1. 80 to 9. 00). In 60 % of patients the pre-treatment AAG concentration was above that known to block the effects of <b>toremifene</b> in vitro. However, addition of serum from patients on <b>toremifene</b> to MCF- 7 adr cells in vitro inhibited Pgp-mediated efflux of rhodamine 123. CONCLUSIONS: We have shown that short course, high-dose <b>toremifene</b> in combination with vinblastine is generally well tolerated and that the concentration of <b>toremifene</b> required to reverse MDR in vitro is achievable in vivo...|$|E

40|$|AbstractEndocrine {{therapy is}} a {{cornerstone}} of medical treatment for estrogen receptor–positive breast cancer. The discovery of selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) > 40 years ago represented a revolutionary advance {{in the treatment of}} breast cancer.

40|$|Abstract Background In premenopausal women, {{endocrine}} adjuvant {{therapy for}} breast cancer primarily consists of tamoxifen alone or with ovarian suppressive strategies. <b>Toremifene</b> is a chlorinated derivative of tamoxifen, but with a superior risk-benefit profile. In this retrospective study, we sought to establish the role of <b>toremifene</b> as an endocrine therapy for premenopausal patients with estrogen and/or progesterone receptor positive breast cancer besides tamoxifen. Methods Patients with early invasive breast cancer were selected from the breast tumor registries at the Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital (China). Premenopausal patients with endocrine responsive breast cancer who underwent standard therapy and adjuvant therapy with <b>toremifene</b> or tamoxifen were considered eligible. Patients with breast sarcoma, carcinosarcoma, concurrent contralateral primary breast cancer, or with distant metastases at diagnosis, or {{those who had not}} undergone surgery and endocrine therapy were ineligible. Overall survival and recurrence-free survival were the primary outcomes measured. Toxicity data was also collected and compared between the two groups. Results Of the 810 patients reviewed, 452 patients were analyzed in the study: 240 received tamoxifen and 212 received <b>toremifene.</b> The median and mean follow up times were 50. 8 and 57. 3 [*]months, respectively. <b>Toremifene</b> and tamoxifen yielded similar overall survival values, with 5 -year overall survival rates of 100 % and 98. 4 %, respectively (p [*]=[*] 0. 087). However, recurrence-free survival was significantly better in the <b>toremifene</b> group than in the tamoxifen group (p [*]=[*] 0. 022). Multivariate analysis showed that recurrence-free survival improved independently with <b>toremifene</b> (HR[*]=[*] 0. 385, 95 % CI[*]=[*] 0. 154 - 0. 961; p [*]=[*] 0. 041). Toxicity was similar in the two treatment groups with no women experiencing severe complications, other than hot flashes, which was more frequent in the <b>toremifene</b> patients (p [*]=[*] 0. 049).

40|$|The {{spread of}} {{antibiotic}} resistance {{and the challenges}} associated with antiseptics such as chlorhexidine have necessitated the search for new antibacterial agents against oral bacterial pathogens.

In this study, we examined the effect of the FDA-approved anticancer agent <b>toremifene</b> against oral bacteria Porphyromonas gingivalis and Streptococcus mutans. We found that the drug was able to inhibit growth of both pathogens as well as prevent biofilm formation at concentrations ranging from 12. 5 to 25 µM. Moreover, <b>toremifene</b> was shown to eradicate preformed biofilms at concentrations ranging from 25 to 50 µM. In addition, we found that <b>toremifene</b> prevents P. gingivalis and S. mutans biofilm formation on titanium surfaces.

40|$|To {{assess and}} compare the gynaecological {{consequences}} {{of the use of}} 2 antioestrogens we examined 167 postmenopausal breast cancer patients before and during the use of either tamoxifen (20  mg/day, n = 84) or <b>toremifene</b> (40  mg/day, n = 83) as an adjuvant treatment of stage II–III breast cancer. Detailed interview concerning menopausal symptoms, pelvic examination including transvaginal sonography (TVS) and collection of endometrial sample were performed at baseline and at 6, 12, 24 and 36 months of treatment. In a subgroup of 30 women (15 using tamoxifen and 15 <b>toremifene)</b> pulsatility index (PI) in an uterine artery was measured before and at 6 and 12 months of treatment. The mean (±SD) follow-up time was 2. 3 ± 0. 8 years. 35 % of the patients complained of vasomotor symptoms {{before the start of the}} trial. This rate increased to 60. 0 % during the first year of the trial, being similar among patients using tamoxifen (57. 1 %) and <b>toremifene</b> (62. 7 %). Vaginal dryness, which was present in 6. 0 % at baseline, increased during the use of tamoxifen (26. 2 %) and <b>toremifene</b> (24. 1 %). Endometrial thickness increased from baseline (3. 9 ± 2. 7  mm) to 6. 8 ± 4. 2  mm at 6 months (P< 0. 001), and no difference emerged between the 2 regimens in this regard. Before the start of the antioestrogen regimen, the endometrium was atrophic in 71 (75. 5 %) and proliferative in 19 of 94 (20. 2 %) samples; 4 patients had benign endometrial polyps. During the use of antioestrogen altogether 339 endometrial samples were taken (159 in tamoxifen group, 180 in <b>toremifene</b> group). The endometrium was proliferative more often in the tamoxifen group (47. 8 %) than in the <b>toremifene</b> group (32. 2 %) (P< 0. 0001). 20 patients had a total of 24 polyps (17 in tamoxifen and 9 in <b>toremifene</b> group, P< 0. 05) during the use of antioestrogens. One patient in the <b>toremifene</b> group developed endometrial adenocarcinoma at 12 months, and one patient had breast cancer metastasis on the endometrium. Tamoxifen failed to affect the PI in the uterine artery, but <b>toremifene</b> reduced it by 15. 0 % (P< 0. 05) by 12 months. In conclusion, tamoxifen and <b>toremifene</b> cause similarly vasomotor and vaginal symptoms. Neither regimen led to the development of premalignant endometrial changes.

In addition, these drugs inhibit the growth of Cryptococcus neoformanswithin macrophages, a niche not accessible by current antifungal drugs. <b>Toremifene</b> and tamoxifen directly bind to the essential EF hand protein calmodulin, as determined by thermal shift assays with purified C. neoformans calmodulin (Cam 1), prevent Cam 1 from binding to its well-characterized substrate calcineurin (Cna 1), and block Cna 1 activation. In whole cells, <b>toremifene</b> and tamoxifen block the calcineurin-dependent nuclear localization of the transcription factor Crz 1. A large-scale chemical genetic screen with a library of C. neoformans deletion mutants identified a second EF hand-containing protein, which we have named calmodulin-like protein 1 (CNAG_ 05655), as a potential target, and further analysis showed that <b>toremifene</b> directly binds Cml...|$|E

Kipu voi olla jatkuvaa tai vaihdella kuukautiskierron mukaan. Kolmella naisella neljästä oireen voimakkuus on kierron vaiheen mukaan vaihtuva. Oire on yleensä hankalin kuukautiskierron jälkipuolella. Kipu voi tuntua voimakkaammalta liikuttaessa tai juostessa, jolloin oire voi varsinkin useita päiviä kestäessään haitata normaalia elämää, työntekoa ja harrastetoimintaa. Rintojen arkuutta voi helpottaa käyttämällä tukevia rintaliivejä myös ruokavaliolla voi olla merkitystä. Lääkäriin kannattaa hakeutua, jos omista toimenpiteistä huolimatta oire haitaa päivittäistä elämää. Esim. hormonihoidoilla oiretta voidaan joskus helpottaa. Tässä väitöstutkimuksessa selvitettiin toremifeeni-lääkityksen tehoa hankalan loppukierron mastalgian hoidossa. Toremifeeni on lääkeaine, joka toimii naishormoni estrogeenin vastavaikuttajana (antiestrogeeni). Lääkettä annosteltiin kuukautiskierron lopulla hankalasta rintojen kivusta kärsiville potilaille kuukautiskierron lopulla ja sen tehoa ja sivuvaikutuksia verrattiin lumelääkkeeseen (placeboon). Toremifeenin teho rintojen kivussa osoittautui hyväksi, selvästi lumelääkettä paremmaksi. Koetut sivuvaikutukset olivat lieviä eivätkä ne eronneet lumelääkkeestä. Tutkimuksessa selvitettiin myös naisen sukuhormonitasoissa tapahtuvia muutoksia kuukautiskierron lopulla toremifeenin käytön aikana. Estrogeeni, keltarauhashormoni ja prolaktiinitasojen havaittiin nousevan mastalgiasta kärsivillä naisilla. Rintojen magneettitutkimuksella osoitettiin rintojen verenkierron ja samalla turvotuksen vähenevän toremifeenin käytön aikana verrattuna lumelääkitykseen rintojen kivusta kärsivillä naisilla. Oireettomilla naisilla ei todettu muutoksia, kun verrattiin rintojen verenkiertoa ja tilavuutta kolmiulotteisella (3 D) ultraäänellä toremifeenin ja lumelääkkeen käytön aikana. Toremifeeni 20 mg annoksella kuukautiskierron lopulla on yksi vaihtoehto hankalan mastalgian hoitona ja sen teho samoin turvallisuus lyhytaikaisessa käytössä osoitettiin tässä väitöstutkimuksessa. Cyclic mastalgia, by definition, {{occurs in}} premenopausal women and connotes breast pain {{that is clearly}} related to the menstrual cycle. Premenstrual mastalgia may be severe enough to {{interfere}} with usual daily activities, {{and its effect on}} quality of life (QoL) is often underestimated. Hormonally active treatments are effective for patients with cyclic mastalgia. This book consists of five studies and presents the effects of the anti-oestrogen <b>toremifene</b> on mastalgia in the premenopausal breast. The aim of the first study was to evaluate the potential role of <b>toremifene</b> in the treatment of mastalgia, and to investigate its mechanism of action in this indication. The next aim was to evaluate if there are any measurable changes in luteal phase sex hormones attributable to <b>toremifene</b> in women with premenstrual mastalgia. The third aim was {{to find out if the}} effect of <b>toremifene</b> on the breast would be detectable with dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The fourth aim was to investigate the vascular and volume effects of <b>toremifene</b> on healthy premenopausal breasts by three dimensional (3 D) ultrasound. In the first study, a total of 62 premenopausal women suffering from cyclic mastalgia were randomized to receive <b>toremifene</b> 20 mg daily or placebo from day 15 of the menstrual cycle until menstruation for three consecutive cycles. After a wash-out cycle, the women were crossed over to receive placebo or <b>toremifene,</b> respectively, for three additional cycles. In the second and third study, the population was the same as previously described. However, only those participants who had given blood samples at all measuring points were included in the study. Forty-eight patients gave three blood samples during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle: the first at baseline, the second during the third toremifene/placebo cycle and third during the third placebo/toremifene cycle, respectively. The investigated hormones in the second study were: follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), oestradiol, progesterone, prolactin (PRL), androstenedione, total and free testosterone and in the third study inhibin A and B were investigated. In the fourth study, ten women with marked premenstrual mastalgia were randomized to receive either <b>toremifene</b> 20 mg or placebo from cycle day 15 until the next menstruation for three menstrual cycles. After a washout period, the treatment was crossed over for three additional cycles. The MRI evaluations were performed prior to menstruation at the end of each treatment phase. Breast pain and QoL scores were collected from one baseline cycle and from all treatment cycles. Nine participants were included in the final analysis. In the fifth study, twenty healthy premenopausal women were recruited. Following a single non-medicated baseline menstrual cycle, the participants received <b>toremifene</b> 20 mg/day from cycle day 15 until the second examination. The breast 3 D ultrasound evaluations were performed within 5 days prior to menstruation. Both breasts were assessed as four quadrants. The power Doppler setting was used and standardized with twenty degrees volume angle and maximum quality. In Study I, there was a 64 % reduction in median pain scores in the toremifene-treated cycles compared with a 26 % reduction in placebo-treated cycles. The median pain scores were 1. 8 (during <b>toremifene</b> treatment), 3. 7 (during placebo), and 5. 0 (baseline). Although the placebo effect was also significant, <b>toremifene</b> reduced the pain significantly more than placebo. The adverse reactions turned out to be mild and infrequent during the treatment and were evenly distributed between the arms. The overall QoL scores remained unchanged. In study IV, the median Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scores were 1. 83 during <b>toremifene</b> and 6. 33 during placebo. Once again, <b>toremifene</b> alleviated breast pain, but the difference was only of borderline significance (P= 0. 078). However, the QoL scores appeared to be slightly lower during <b>toremifene</b> when compared with placebo (P= 0. 047). This is likely to be a coincidental result due to the much smaller sample size in Study IV compared with Study I (9 vs. 56 patients, respectively). The median serum oestradiol and progesterone levels were significantly higher in the toremifene-treated cycles. The median serum PRL concentration was significantly higher during the <b>toremifene</b> treatment when compared with the baseline. There were no significant changes in other hormone concentrations evaluated. The concentrations of both inhibins were within normal range for the luteal phase and remained unchanged throughout the treatment cycles. The mechanism by which <b>toremifene</b> has a therapeutic effect in cyclic mastalgia does not seem to involve inhibition or stimulation of ovarian inhibin production. Both the enhancement ratio and the maximum slope of enhancement tended to be lower during the <b>toremifene</b> cycles when compared with placebo. These findings indicate that the therapeutic effect of <b>toremifene</b> in alleviating premenstrual mastalgia may at least partly be mediated though diminished blood flow to the breast. The 3 D measured volumes and all vascular indices in healthy breasts remained unchanged during the treatment with <b>toremifene</b> when compared with the baseline. The finding that <b>toremifene</b> significantly alleviated premenstrual breast pain over placebo with few mild adverse effects encourages its use for this indication. The short-term safety of 20 mg of <b>toremifene</b> administered daily during the luteal phase was addressed. The present results imply that the mechanism of action of <b>toremifene</b> in mastalgia is at least partly based on local effects, although the luteotropic effect was also evident...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} the non-steroidal antioestrogens {{tamoxifen}} and <b>toremifene</b> on voltage-gated cationic currents was examined in primary cultures of rat hypothalamic neurones and the C 1300 mouse neuroblastoma cell line using the whole-cell patch clamp technique. When applied to the external bathing solution both tamoxifen and <b>toremifene</b> were able to inhibit TTX-sensitive sodium currents with IC 50 values of 1 – 2 μM and delayed rectifier type potassium currents (IC 50, 2 – 3 μM). However, only <b>toremifene</b> showed a significant inhibition of the IA current (IC 50 3 μM). Inhibition of voltage-gated cationic currents was significantly impaired when tamoxifen was applied in a serum-containing solution.

40|$|Tissue {{infiltration}} {{is different}} in desmoid and fibroma tumours. Both produce high levels of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFbeta 1), which is related to extracellular matrix (ECM) accumulation which in turn regulates cell function and cell migration. Interactions between collagen, proteoglycans and cell surface fibronectin {{are involved in the}} assembly and functions of the ECM. As <b>toremifene</b> inhibits collagen and TGFbeta 1 synthesis, we tested it in normal, desmoid and fibroma fibroblasts. We will report the changes in glycosaminoglycan (GAG) and collagen synthesis, TGFbeta 1 activity, fibronectin mRNA expression and TGFbeta 1 receptors after <b>toremifene</b> treatment in normal, fibroma and desmoid fibroblasts. We evaluated GAG and collagen synthesis with 3 H-glucosamine and 3 H-proline incorporation, TGFbeta 1 activity with the ELISA method, TGFbeta 1 receptor affinity with 125 I-TGFbeta 1 binding and total RNA with Northern blot analysis. GAG and collagen synthesis, TGFbeta 1 activity and fibronectin levels were higher in fibroma and desmoid than normal fibroblasts. The increase was greater in desmoid than fibroma tumour cells. <b>Toremifene</b> treatment reduced GAG and collagen synthesis, TGFbeta 1 activity and fibronectin levels in all cell cultures. The percentage reduction in GAG was similar in all cultures; the reduction in collagen synthesis and TGFbeta 1 activity was the highest in desmoid fibroblasts. TGFbeta 1 receptors were higher in fibroma and desmoid cells than controls. <b>Toremifene</b> reduced TGFbeta 1 receptors only in desmoid fibroblasts, with no effect on the changes in type I, II, and III receptors. Our data show that <b>toremifene</b> modifies the ECM components that regulate cytokine activity and cell migration. The reduction in receptor number only in desmoid cells suggests that <b>toremifene</b> may reduce TGFbeta 1 's affinity for its receptors. Synthesis of a substance regulating protein kinase activity, which is directly involved in the link between TGFbeta 1 and its receptors, cannot be excluded...|$|E

40|$|Breast {{cancer is}} an {{important}} cause {{of morbidity and mortality}} in women. Although many risk factors are thought to influence the development of breast cancer, {{the most important of these}} are a family history of disease and reproductive and endocrine factors. The incidence of breast cancer is increasing in both developed and developing countries. However, earlier detection and improvements in treatment have resulted in a stabilisation of mortality rates in developed countries. Early detection is associated with decreased breast cancer mortality. Advanced breast cancer, however, is generally considered incurable. As such, the aim of pharmacotherapy for women with advanced disease is palliation of symptoms while minimising drug toxicity. In women with asymptomatic metastatic disease that is not rapidly progressive, hormone therapy is the treatment of first choice because of its better tolerability profile compared with most cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens. Antiestrogens are preferred as first-line hormone therapy because they are generally better tolerated than other hormone drugs such as aromatase inhibitors and progestins. Localised treatment also has a role in disease palliation. Surgery, as an adjunct to chemotherapy, can facilitate disease control, and irradiation is beneficial in patients with painful bone or CNS metastases. <b>Toremifene</b> is the first antiestrogen to be approved for the treatment of advanced breast cancer since tamoxifen became available about 20 years ago. Comparative clinical trials have demonstrated that <b>toremifene</b> has similar efficacy and tolerability to that of tamoxifen in postmenopausal patients with tumours of positive or unknown hormone receptor status and who do not have rapidly progressive disease. Like tamoxifen, <b>toremifene</b> also demonstrates partial estrogenic activity, producing beneficial effects on bone metabolism and the blood lipid profile. Tamoxifen, however, has been associated with an increased risk of endometrial cancer, and preclinical data suggest that <b>toremifene</b> has a lower carcinogenic potential than tamoxifen. In summary, the apparent lower carcinogenic potential of <b>toremifene</b> versus tamoxifen requires confirmation in clinical trials, but the overall clinical relevance of such a benefit in the setting of advanced disease is unclear. <b>Toremifene,</b> however, is an equally effective and well tolerated alternative to tamoxifen for primary hormone treatment of postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer.

Between December 2003 and June 2004, 15 women {{with a mean age}} of 53 years old with metastatic breast cancer were enrolled. The administration schedule was 80 mg/m 2 of paclitaxel given on Days 1, 8, and 15, and 120 mg/day of <b>toremifene</b> citrate orally administered starting on Day 18. On Days 32 and 39, paclitaxel was concurrently administered again. Toxicities, response rate, and time to treatment failure were assessed. All patients had been treated with endocrine or chemotherapy. Grade 3 leukopenia occurred in 2 patients on the administration of paclitaxel alone, and grade 3 febrile neutropenia occurred in 1 patient given the combination therapy. There was no grade 3 or greater non-hematological toxicity. There was no complete response and 1 partial response, producing a response rate of 6. 7 %.

40|$|The {{effect of}} clodronate on bone mineral density (BMD) was studied in 121 post-menopausal breast cancer women without {{skeletal}} metastases. In addition, two antioestrogens, tamoxifen and <b>toremifene,</b> were compared in their action on bone mineral density. Patients were randomized {{to have an}} adjuvant antioestrogen treatment either 20 mg of tamoxifen or 60 mg of <b>toremifene</b> daily for 3 years. In addition all patients were randomized to have 1600 mg of oral clodronate daily or to act as control subjects. BMD of the lumbar spine and femoral neck were measured by dual-energy radiographic absorptiometry before therapy and at 1 and 2 years. At 2 years, clodronate with antioestrogens markedly increased BMD in the lumbar spine and femoral neck by 2. 9 % and 3. 7 % (P = 0. 001 and 0. 006 respectively). There were no significant changes in BMD in the patients given antioestrogens only. No {{significant differences were found}} between tamoxifen and <b>toremifene</b> on bone mineral density.

40|$|Multidrug {{resistance}} (MDR) due to {{expression of}} a membrane-associated permeability glycoprotein (P-glycoprotein [Pgp]) prevents successful cytotoxic chemotherapy for breast cancer. Identification of MDR would facilitate selection of chemotherapy regimens and MDR modulators. This study aimed to evaluate 99 mTc-sestamibi imaging for predicting overexpression of Pgp in primary breast cancer and to measure the efficacy of <b>toremifene,</b> the MDR modulator, in vivo. Methods: Twenty patients with untreated breast cancer had 99 mTc-sestamibi imaging 20 and 120 min after tracer injection before and after a 3 -d course of <b>toremifene</b> (780 mg/d). Tumor samples were obtained during surgery for correlation of imaging and Pgp immunohistochemistry. Results: Sixteen of 20 tumors were visualized with sestamibi. Before <b>toremifene,</b> {{there was a significant}} inverse correlation (Spearman rank correlation coefficient [RS]) between staining intensity, based on the anti-Pgp monoclonal antibodies C 494 and C 219, and the tumor-to-background ratio (T/B) at 120 min (RS = − 0. 85; P 3 ̆c 0. 001 and RS = − 0. 71; P 3 ̆c 0. 001, respectively). However, the correlation between the T/B and immunohistochemistry at 20 min was significant only for C 494 (RS = − 0. 57; P 3 ̆c 0. 01). Similarly, before <b>toremifene,</b> there was an inverse correlation between staining intensity and the change in the T/B between 20 and 120 min (RS = − 0. 77; P 3 ̆c 0. 001 and − 0. 75; P 3 ̆c 0. 001 for C 494 and C 219). After <b>toremifene,</b> an inverse correlation between staining intensity and the T/B was seen only at 120 min and only with C 494 (RS = − 0. 68; P 3 ̆c 0. 01). However, the change in the T/B between 20 and 120 min correlated significantly with staining intensity for C 494 and C 219 (RS = − 0. 68; P 3 ̆c 0. 01 and − 0. 7; P 3 ̆c 0. 01 for C 494 and C 219, respectively). <b>Toremifene</b> did not significantly alter the overall T/B at either 20 or 120 min when data were compared before and after <b>toremifene.</b> Nevertheless, at 120 min, 8 of 8 tumors with low Pgp expression showed reduced uptake after <b>toremifene,</b> whereas 5 of 6 tumors with strong expression showed increased uptake (P 3 ̆c 0. 003). Moreover, there was a significant correlation between the change in the T/B and staining intensity with C 494 (RS = 0. 59; P 3 ̆c 0. 05) and C 219 (RS = 0. 56; P 3 ̆c 0. 05) at 120 min but not at 20 min. Conclusion: 99 mTc-Sestamibi accumulation in breast cancer correlates with Pgp expression. <b>Toremifene</b> has a dual effect on this accumulation, increasing it through an inhibitory effect on Pgp {{while at the same time}} reducing it by a direct competition with sestamibi. The latter implies that in response to Pgp modulation the efflux of various agents may be affected differently...|$|E
