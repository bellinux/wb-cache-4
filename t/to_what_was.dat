5|$|As well as {{providing}} {{power for the}} tram system, the station {{was a source of}} electricity for local homes. The building of a power station brought major environmental improvements <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> a highly polluted area, because electricity represented a much cleaner source of household energy than coal, which was used at the time. Local households gradually switched to the new power source. A partner in the enterprise of the Lemington power station was Sir Matthew White Ridley, who had considerable interests in coal and banking.|$|E
5|$|Biomechanical {{studies by}} Ken Carpenter in 2002 {{confirmed}} that the most likely function of the forelimbs in predation was grasping, as their great lengths would have permitted longer reach than for most other theropods. The rather large and elongated coracoid, indicating powerful muscles in the forelimbs, further strengthened this interpretation. Carpenter's biomechanical studies using bone casts also showed that Deinonychus could not fold its arms against its body like a bird ("avian folding"), contrary <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> inferred from the earlier 1985 descriptions by Jacques Gauthier and Gregory S. Paul in 1988.|$|E

One quarter of the Jewish population emigrated, with intellectuals particularly likely to leave, and those intellectuals who remained were more interested in politics than in theater: this was a period of social ferment, with Jewish socialists in Iaşi starting Der Veker (The Awakener).|$|E

SR78 was legally known as Route197 from Escondido to Ramona, and Route198 from Ramona to US99, which is now SR86. From the eastern junction of SR86 to the Riverside county line, the route was designated as Route146 in 1959.|$|E
