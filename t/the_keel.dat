The old keelsons were replaced and ten new ones laid, which ran the entire length of <b>the</b> <b>keel.</b> Both the bow and stern were also strengthened by heavy frames of double angle iron.|$|E

50|$|The {{ability to}} raise <b>the</b> <b>keels</b> was a useful feature for a survey vessel {{required}} to work in shallow waters. Lady Nelsons draught was 12 feet when she left England, fully provisioned for her voyage. This would draught would halve to six feet when <b>the</b> <b>keels</b> were raised. <b>The</b> <b>keels</b> were of timber construction with no added ballast.|$|R
5000|$|The {{channels}} between <b>the</b> <b>keels</b> {{are about}} equal to <b>the</b> <b>keels</b> in width and are crossed by numerous very slender raised threads, which extend {{up on the}} sides of <b>the</b> <b>keels</b> but do not cross them. About five of these threads fall in the space between two tubercles on the spire, in the first supra-peripheral groove.|$|R

5|$|The {{order for}} four Kamorta-class corvettes {{were placed in}} 2003 by the Indian Navy. Construction of the lead ship, INS Kamorta began in the year 2005 and <b>the</b> <b>keel</b> was laid down in 2006 at Garden Reach Ship Builders and Engineers, Kolkata.

INS Kiltan was laid down in 2010 and launched in 2013. While the last ship of its class, INS Kavaratti was laid down in 2012 and launched in 2015.

5|$|Cdr Katô Hirohasu {{pushed for}} the {{adoption}} of a new /45 calibre gun that was currently under development. After trials of the new gun, which were witnessed by both the Japanese Navy and Royal Navy, the Japanese made the decision on 29 Nov 1911 to use the new gun despite <b>the</b> <b>keel</b> having already been laid down on 17 January 1911, and the resulting need to quickly make a large number of alternations to the design, so as to not prolong the construction.|$|E
5|$|Tegetthoff {{was ordered}} by the Austro-Hungarian Navy in 1908. She was the second {{battleship}} of the class that shared her name to be built, the first dreadnoughts of the Austro-Hungarian Navy. <b>The</b> <b>keel</b> of Tegetthoff was laid down in Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino shipyard in Trieste on 24 September 1910. Following {{a year and a}} half of construction, Tegetthoff was launched on 21 March 1912. Following her fitting out, she was commissioned into the Austro-Hungarian navy on 14 July 1913.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>keel</b> for Napoli {{was laid}} down at Castellammare di Stabia on 21 October 1903. She was {{launched}} on 10 September 1905, and completed on 1 August 1908. Napoli {{served in the}} active duty squadron through 1910, which included her three sisters and the two s. At the time, these six battleships represented Italy's front-line battle fleet. The active duty squadron was typically in service for seven {{months of the year}} for training; {{the rest of the year}} they were placed in reserve.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>keel</b> of Kongō {{was laid}} down at Barrow-in-Furness by Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering on 17 January 1911. Under Japan's {{contract}} with Vickers, the first vessel {{of the class}} was constructed in the United Kingdom, with the remainder built in Japan. Kongō was launched on 18 May 1912, and then transferred to the dockyards of Portsmouth, England, where her fitting-out began in mid-1912. All parts used in her construction were manufactured in the U.K. Kongo was completed on 16 April 1913.|$|E
5|$|Work {{began on}} the pair of Pisa-class ships in August 1904, nearly a year before <b>the</b> <b>keel</b> of Amalfi, named after the eponymous city, was laid down on 24 July 1905 at the Cantieri navali Odero {{shipyard}} in Sestri Ponente. It was nearly three years before Amalfi was launched on 5 May 1908. The ship was completed on 1 September 1909, just over four years after her keel was laid.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the {{tendering}} process, {{the four}} G3 battlecruisers were ordered on 24 October 1921, without names, from John Brown, Swan Hunter, William Beardmore and Fairfield. Following the visit of an Admiralty delegation, detailed constructional drawings were sent to John Brown on 3 November with a request that copies be urgently circulated to the other successful contractors. Work at John Brown progressed on <b>the</b> <b>keel</b> blocks and hull plates for the subsequent two weeks. Notwithstanding other events, instructions and amendments continued to arrive from various departments within the Admiralty until 25 November.|$|E

5|$|Initial {{assessments}} of Belfasts damage showed that, while the mine had done little direct {{damage to the}} outer hull, causing only a small hole directly below one of the boiler rooms, {{the shock of the}} explosion had caused severe warping, breaking machinery, deforming the decks and causing <b>the</b> <b>keel</b> to hog (bend upwards) by three inches. On 4 January 1940 Belfast was decommissioned to Care and Maintenance status, becoming the responsibility of Rosyth Dockyard, and her crew dispersed to other vessels. By 28 June she had been repaired sufficiently to sail to Devonport, arriving on 30 June under the command of Lt Cdr H W Parkinson.|$|E
5|$|Kronan {{was one of}} {{the most}} heavily armed {{warships}} in the world in 1672 when she was launched, a three-decker with 110 guns. The ship had three full gundecks with guns from bow to stern. Altogether there were seven separate levels, divided by six decks. Furthest down in the ship, above <b>the</b> <b>keel,</b> was the hold, and immediately above it, but still below the waterline, lay the orlop; both were used primarily for storage. Above the orlop were the three gundecks, two of them covered, while about half of the topmost gundeck was open to the elements in the ship's middle, or waist. The bow had one deck, making up the forecastle, and the stern had two decks, including a poop deck.|$|E

Starting from her commissioning, Sankt Georg frequently served in the training squadron, along with the three s, though she alternated in the squadron with the armored cruiser Kaiser Karl VI. Once the summer training schedule was completed each year, the ships of the training squadron were demobilized in the reserve squadron, which was held {{in a state of}} partial readiness.|$|E
