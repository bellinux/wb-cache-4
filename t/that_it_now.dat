5|$|Guido Forti {{alleged that}} Shannon Racing had not paid him any money within the stipulated six-day {{deadline}} after {{the deal was}} concluded and refuted the claim <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>now</b> owned 51% of his team. As the team ran out of money, it was doubtful whether it would turn up at the British GP. In the end, Forti took part, only for the cars to complete a mere handful of laps each in practice and thus failing to set a time quick enough to qualify. This was because it was becoming increasingly in debt to Cosworth and {{was running out of}} engine mileage for its cars, only having enough to make a token effort at participation. The team made it to the next race - the German GP - but both cars remained unassembled in the pit garages throughout the weekend after the engine supply was finally cut off.|$|E

25|$|The Elmore {{was removed}} from the Portland-Tillamook route because of storms during the winter of 1915–16 and laid up at Astoria. In March 1916, it was hoped that weather {{conditions}} in April might allow to the boat to return to service on the route. When Elmore was returned to service in 1916, its schedule was changed so <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>now</b> departed Portland every Wednesday night for Tillamook.|$|E

On September 4, 1961, partly in response, Congress passed the Foreign Assistance Act, a Cold War Act (among many other measures) which prohibited aid to Cuba and authorized the President to impose a complete trade embargo against Cuba.|$|E

25|$|Around 1772, Arnold {{modified}} this escapement so <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>now</b> was pivoted vertically {{and acted}} on by a spring.

In a long and detailed article on this matter published in Australiana November 2014 Vol 36 No. 4, John Hawkins details the association between these two men and the probability that this instrument is one and the same, the world's first pocket chronometer originally destined for Cook's second voyage, purchased by Banks and lent to Phipps.|$|E
25|$|Post-apartheid South Africa {{has seen}} a loss of {{preferential}} treatment by the government for Afrikaans, in terms of education, social events, media (TV and radio), and general status throughout the country, given <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>now</b> shares its place as official language with ten other languages. Nevertheless, Afrikaans remains more prevalent in the media – radio, newspapers and television – {{than any of the}} other official languages, except English. More than 300 book titles in Afrikaans are published annually. South African census figures suggest a growing number of speakers in all nine provinces, a total of 6.85 million in 2011 compared to 5.98 million a decade earlier. The South African Institute of Race Relations (SAIRR) project that a growing majority will be Coloured Afrikaans speakers. Afrikaans speakers experience higher employment rates than other South African language groups, though half a million remain unemployed.|$|E

25|$|Several genera {{have been}} removed from Rafflesiaceae, so <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>now</b> {{consists}} of only three genera: Sapria, Rhizanthes, and Rafflesia. All of these are holoparasites and, as discussed below, finding their relationships by molecular phylogenetics has presented special challenges. Rafflesia and its relatives were the subject of several papers from 2004 to 2009, and as the world's largest flower, Rafflesia has attracted special interest. In 2009, Wurdack and Davis confirmed earlier work in which it was found that Rafflesiaceae is nested within Euphorbiaceae sensu stricto, a circumscription of Euphorbiaceae that excludes Phyllanthaceae, Picrodendraceae, Putranjivaceae, Pandaceae, and a few other very small groups that had been included in it until the 1990s. In order to preserve Rafflesiaceae, Wurdack and Davis split Euphorbiaceae sensu stricto into Euphorbiaceae sensu strictissimo and Peraceae, a new family comprising Pera and four other genera.|$|E
25|$|Under the Courts Ordinance Amendment 1885 (S.S.), the set-up of the Supreme Court {{was again}} altered so <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>now</b> {{consisted}} of the Chief Justice and three puisne judges. In 1907 {{the jurisdiction of the}} Supreme Court was given a major overhaul. The Court was split into two divisions – a Civil Division and a Criminal Division, each with both original and appellate jurisdiction. District Courts and Police Courts, which replaced the Magistrates' Courts, were also established. The Court of Requests, the jurisdiction of which had been drastically reduced in the intervening years, was abolished. The last major changes in the court system before World War II took place in 1934 when a Court of Criminal Appeal, essentially an extension of the Supreme Court's jurisdiction, was created, and in 1936 when it was declared that the Supreme Court would consist of a High Court and Court of Appeal.|$|E

On 20 May 1948, it became part of the 7th Tank Army. On 15 May 1957, {{the division}} became the 47th Guards Tank Division. It became a tank training division on 2 August 1960. On 11 January 1965, it became the 45th Guards Tank Training Division. On 30 November 1987, it became the 72nd Guards District Training Center. Taken over by Belarus with the dissolution of the Soviet Union, it became the 72nd Guards Joint Training Center for junior specialists on 30 November 1992. In 2001, the training center changed its name to reflect <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>now</b> also trained warrant officers and adopted tis current structure.
