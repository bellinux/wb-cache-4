5|$|Trooper Harper's {{official}} reports {{state that}} after he stopped the Pontiac, he ordered Acoli {{to the back of}} <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> for Trooper Foerster—who had arrived on the scene—to examine his driver's license. The reports then state that after Acoli complied, and as Harper was looking inside <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> to examine the registration, Trooper Foerster yelled and held up an ammunition magazine as Shakur simultaneously reached into her red pocketbook, pulled out a nine-millimeter weapon and fired at him. Trooper Harper's reports then state that he ran to the rear of his car and shot at Shakur who had exited <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> and was firing from a crouched position next to <b>the</b> <b>vehicle.</b>|$|E
5|$|With {{the design}} process complete, four street-ready race cars were constructed, with each vehicle {{possessing}} 65 panels and costing $250,000 to build. Two of the four cars were specialized versions. One version was the flap version, which had hydraulics and flaps to detail the close-up shots where <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> propelled itself through the air. The other version was the jet version, in which an actual jet engine was mounted onto <b>the</b> <b>vehicle,</b> fueled by six propane tanks. The visibility inside <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> was poor, so monitors were connected to cameras on <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> body. The professional drivers for the Tumblers practiced driving the vehicles for six months before they drove {{on the streets of}} Chicago for the film's scenes.|$|E

5|$|Heat {{levels on}} the speeder must be monitored, as {{although}} there are no set top speeds for the vehicles, they can explode if allowed to overheat. Heat builds up from acceleration and from collisions. To counteract this, the player may activate the onboard cooler, however, this will slow <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> down. Designated cooling strips along the track and the Ice power-up can cool <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> without a speed penalty, allowing the player to continue accelerating.|$|E
50|$|In Hungary, since 2009 {{this tax}} {{is based on}} <b>the</b> <b>vehicle's</b> engine {{performance}} and <b>the</b> <b>vehicle's</b> age. Before this so-called performance tax, this tax was based on <b>the</b> <b>vehicle's</b> weight and unofficially it was called a weight tax.|$|R
50|$|The third {{generation}} Saturn S-Series {{was also the}} first Saturn to use the Body Control Module (BCM), and the Powertrain Control Module (PCM) systems in tandem with each other. In the {{third generation}} Saturn S-Series models, the Powertrain Control Module (PCM) system was only used strictly for <b>the</b> <b>vehicle's</b> transmission system as well as <b>the</b> <b>vehicle's</b> engine, whereas <b>the</b> Body Control Module (BCM) system was only used strictly for <b>the</b> <b>vehicle's</b> interior functions like the digital trip odometer, <b>the</b> <b>vehicle's</b> speedometer, and other electronic functions in <b>the</b> <b>vehicle's</b> interior as well.|$|R
50|$|Active Body Control was {{designed}} to control <b>the</b> <b>vehicle's</b> stability {{through a combination of}} active springs and hydraulics at each wheel, plus sensors that monitor <b>the</b> <b>vehicle’s</b> movements. <b>The</b> <b>vehicle's</b> computer assesses <b>the</b> information from the sensors and adjusts the suspension accordingly.|$|R

5|$|Players {{control a}} monocle- and pith helmet–wearing Velociraptor driving a jeep. The {{aim of the}} game is to attain a high score by {{performing}} stunts, damaging the jeep during collisions, collecting orbs, and killing the other Velociraptor which run around the area. <b>The</b> <b>vehicle</b> is equipped with a spiked ball and chain which can be deployed from the tailgate as many times as the player wishes. Deploying the spiked ball increases the difficulty of maneuvering <b>the</b> <b>vehicle.</b> The ball can be released from the chain at any time, if done so during a turn the weapon is launched forward. Players kill other Velociraptor by ramming them with the jeep or crushing them with the spiked ball which is dragged behind <b>the</b> <b>vehicle.</b> Slain dinosaurs can be dragged to exporters by the spiked ball and chain to gain extra points. Exporters are teleporting devices which transport the slain dinosaurs to the future.|$|E

5|$|The Eastern Upper Peninsula Transportation Authority (EUPTA) {{operates}} the Drummond Island Ferry across the De Tour Passage {{in addition to}} two other ferries and the regional rural bus system for Luce and Chippewa counties. As part of the service between De Tour and Drummond Island, EUPTA operates up to three different vessels: the SS Drummond Islander, SS Drummond Islander III and the SS Drummond Islander IV. , fares start at $12 per car and increase based {{on the size of}} <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> transported, including a fuel surcharge. Passenger fares are $2 for adults and $1 for seniors or students; <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> driver's fare is included in <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> charge. Ferries leave Drummond Island at 10 minutes after the hour, from De Tour at 20 minutes to the hour, and run most of the day; some crossing times are only operated seasonally. M-134 is one of two highways in Michigan to use a ferry connection; the other is US10 between Ludington, Michigan, and Manitowoc, Wisconsin.|$|E
5|$|The M4 was {{developed}} to meet the need for a specialized mortar carrier based on the M2 Half Track Car, which the M21 soon replaced. The initial M4 was designed to carry a mortar. In emergencies, the mortar could be fired from <b>the</b> <b>vehicle.</b> The improved M4A1 had a reinforced floor so that the mortar could be fired from <b>the</b> <b>vehicle,</b> but the mounting faced to the rear and lacked traverse. This caused problems when the troops who operated the mortar mounted <b>the</b> <b>vehicle,</b> so the US 2nd Armored Division relocated the mortars so that they could fire from the front.|$|E
5|$|The Wreck {{experienced}} a major transition of ownership after the Centennial Celebration. Since Reck Club had financially maintained <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> {{for so long}} and Reck Club fell under the Dean of Students rather than the Athletic Association, <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> was sold from the Athletic Association to the Institute for zero dollars in 1987. The transaction further solidified Reck Club's responsibilities over the car but also made the car more than simply a football mascot. The Old Ford was officially an Institute icon.|$|E
