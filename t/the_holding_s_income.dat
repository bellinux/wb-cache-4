Theoretical bases constitute of reference books research, which includes the concepts of management, manager, managers roles and managers functions. Distribution of managers functions {{is based on the}} concept of authors Harold Koontz and Heinz Weihrich relating to planning, organizing, human resources, leadership and control. The practical part focuses on monitoring managers of middle management and their time planning individual functions and activities. Observations were made with the project manager and manager of purchasing and logistics. In the form were recorded the same and different activities within each managers functions. The result was that the project manager spent the most time on planning on the contrary the manager of purchasing and logistics focuses the most on organizing. Primary data were obtained based on the survey to subordinates and individual interviews with managers. The questionnaires and the interviews were compiled from questions relating to the managers functions and company KARSIT <b>Holding,</b> <b>s.</b> r. o.

We find that fishermen 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>income</b> here can be explained broadly under four major blocks of variables: geographical region, fishing inputs and catch, socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, and the nature of the relationship with fisheries extension services. In general, the Wilayat (local administrative units) failed to make any significant impact on fishermen 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>income.</b> The variable "Fishing inputs and catch," such as increases in engine power, boat length, weekly catch, and number of weekly trips, positively impacted fishermen 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>income</b> while increases in weekly fishing costs, number of crew members, and difficulty in getting ice had a significantly negative effect on the in come. Furthermore, socioeconomic and demographic characteristics also contributed significantly in determining the fishermen 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>income</b> level. The other important findings were related to extension services. The variables "Fishermen 2 ̆ 7 s exchange of information and cooperation with the ministry" and "Fishermen 2 ̆ 7 s involvement in the extension activities" were found to have positive effects on fishermen 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>income</b> levels.
