5|$|The Song {{government}} confiscated {{portions of}} land {{owned by the}} landed gentry {{in order to raise}} revenue for these projects, an act which caused dissension and loss of loyalty amongst leading members of Song society but did not stop the Song's defensive preparations. Financial matters were made worse by the fact that many wealthy, land-owning families—some of which had officials working for the government—used their social connections with those in office in order to obtain <b>tax-exempt</b> <b>status.</b>|$|E
5|$|Furry {{conventions}} {{are usually}} run and staffed by volunteers, though venues may require certain activities to be contracted out. Event funding typically relies on convention registrations. Many {{of the larger}} conventions are incorporated as non-profit organizations, usually to achieve <b>tax-exempt</b> <b>status</b> and safeguard the organizers' personal assets - in the US, some are 501(c)(3) charities, while others are registered as recreational clubs. The largest events may require up to a hundred volunteers, not including gofers. Volunteers are thanked for their participation during the closing ceremonies, which are usually well-attended, and often receive T-shirts or other benefits.|$|E

5|$|Aside from {{complaints}} {{regarding the}} high retail {{price for the}} three-record set, particularly in Britain – {{a result of the}} government's refusal to waive its tax surcharge – controversy soon surrounded the project's fundraising. Because the event had not been registered as a UNICEF benefit beforehand, and was therefore not granted <b>tax-exempt</b> <b>status</b> – the blame for which Harrison lay squarely at Klein's feet – most of the money generated was held in an Internal Revenue Service escrow account for ten years. In interview with Derek Taylor for his autobiography in the late 1970s, Harrison put this figure at somewhere between $8 million and $10 million. Before then, in early 1972, New York magazine reported that some of the proceeds remained unaccounted for and had found their way into Klein's accounts. Klein responded by suing the magazine for $150 million in damages, and although the suit was later withdrawn, the accusations attracted unwelcome scrutiny at a time when questions were also being asked about Klein's mismanagement of the Beatles' finances. That year, an estimated $2 million had gone to the refugees via UNICEF before the IRS audit of Apple got under way; finally, in 1981, $8.8 million was added to that total following the audit.|$|E
5|$|Voter {{approval}} of the referendum created a public–private partnership. The Washington State Public Stadium Authority was created to oversee public ownership of the stadium, exhibition center, and parking garage complex. Allen purchased the Seahawks and formed First & Goal Inc. to build and operate the facility. The budget for the project was $430million. Of this cost, $44million was allotted to build the Event Center, $26million for the parking garage, and $360million for the stadium. First & Goal was to cover cost overruns and pay up to $130million of the project while the contribution from the public was capped at $300million. The public funding package included new sports-related state lottery games, taxes on the facility's admissions and parking, sales tax credits and deferrals, and an eight-year extension of the 2% tax on hotel rooms in King County. The taxes on admissions and parking are set at 2% {{to pay off the}} project's tax-exempt bonds. Those taxes will be kept below the authorized 10% to preserve the <b>tax-exempt</b> <b>status,</b> but the percentage will be increased to the full amount when the bonds are completely paid in 2021. At such time, they will become dedicated funding sources for maintenance and modernization of the facilities.|$|E

Following these errors, Mangano fired Assessor Ted Jankowski, who had been originally appointed by Thomas Suozzi and had been criticized by Republicans, and who was considered to be at fault for the errors not being caught. To fix the assessment system further, former Smithtown Assessor Gregory Hild was appointed to review the system.|$|R

40|$|The Treasury Department is {{empowered}} to enforce “established public policy” {{with respect to}} tax-exempt charities. Under this public policy power, the Treasury has revoked the <b>tax-exempt</b> charitable <b>status</b> of organizations that discriminated against blacks, organizations whose members engaged in civil disobedience against war, and organizations involved in illegal activity. The Treasury interprets its public policy power as applying to any activity that violates clear public policy. Thus, presumably, the Treasury could use this power to deny <b>tax-exempt</b> charitable <b>status</b> to an organization that engages in conduct that violates assisted suicide laws, anti-abortion laws, or other sufficiently “established” public policies. The point at which a public policy is sufficiently established for purposes of applying the Treasury 2 ̆ 7 s public policy power is unclear. For example, could the Treasury revoke an organization 2 ̆ 7 s tax exempt charitable status {{on the ground that}} the organization engages in race-based affirmative action? Presently, neither Congress nor the United States Supreme Court has decided conclusively whether race-based affirmative action violates public policy. Even the present Democratic administration has expressed some misgivings about race-based affirmative action. But what if the Treasury were to read recent anti-affirmative action decisions and legislation, and determine that race-based affirmative action violates “established public policy”? Assuming the Treasury interprets recent trends against affirmative action as showing that organizations engaging in race-based affirmative action violate a clear policy on race, the Treasury could place a serious burden on affirmative action programs of private entities by revoking the entities 2 ̆ 7 <b>tax-exempt</b> charitable <b>status.</b> Using race-based affirmative action as the example, this Article highlights some of the problems and dangers with the Treasury 2 ̆ 7 s public policy power...|$|R

St. Matthew's Churches' lawyer says weekly services draw about 1,000 people. According to the Trinity Foundation, an evangelical watchdog group, the physical churches are only associated with the mail-based ministry as a cover that allows the lucrative operation to retain <b>tax-exempt</b> church <b>status.</b> The status was granted by the Internal Revenue Service in 2000 after a 17-year court battle.|$|R

RBS was granted <b>tax-exempt</b> (501(c)(3)) <b>status</b> by the Internal Revenue Service in 2002, and UVa's Alumni Fund, which had held RBS's assets in trust since 1992, turned them over to the RBS Board of Directors, and the school became fully independent.
