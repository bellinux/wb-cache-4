The {{landscape}} is littered with salesmen who say, 'Oh yeah, I {{was the first one}} to bring that in.' The first PBR I ever had was at the Jockey Club, <b>this</b> <b>really</b> old-school punk-rock bar on Killingsworth. As far as the very first ones, there was the Lutz and EJ's, and it's always been our thought that Lutz was first.|$|E

25|$|At {{the time}} of the bid, those {{involved}} in British sport were hopeful that there would also be a 2012 legacy of increased commitment to sport in the UK, with the social and health benefits they believe that could bring, but {{it will be difficult to}} assess whether or not <b>this</b> <b>really</b> happens.

25|$|As {{with most}} {{transportation}} improvements {{during the early}} nineteenth century, industry paved the way within individual states. After successful canal development projects further east in the United States, {{it would not be}} long until canals would soon be dug across the Midwest. The opening of the Erie Canal in 1825 paved the way for improvement projects across the United States and changed the course of American transportation history. The Erie Canal was an immediate financial success. <b>This</b> <b>really</b> set the precedent for future canals and proved canals could provide a viable contribution to local economies.|$|E
25|$|In the {{discussion}} of special relativity, forces played {{no more than a}} background role. Special relativity assumes the ability to define inertial frames that fill all of spacetime, all of whose clocks run {{at the same rate as}} the clock at the origin. Is <b>this</b> <b>really</b> possible? In a nonuniform gravitational field, experiment dictates that the answer is no. Gravitational fields make it impossible to construct a global inertial frame. In small enough regions of spacetime, local inertial frames are still possible. General relativity involves the systematic stitching together of these local frames into a more general picture of spacetime.|$|E
500|$|The music video, {{directed}} by Gavin Bowden, was first released December 7, 2000 on Vh1.com. It {{served as an}} official video for the song, after an unofficial version was released by DreamWorks as a [...] "temporary video" [...] that was played on MTV2. In an interview with MTV Radio, Wade explained {{the process of making}} the music video, and said, [...] "We shot the video at <b>this</b> <b>really</b> cool place in Crenshaw, in L.A., that was a bowling alley upstairs and a roller rink downstairs. It had <b>this</b> <b>really</b> weird, retro vibe to it. When they were setting up the different sets, we'd have to stop every 10 seconds because a bowling league would walk in. It was the coolest thing. At night, we got all of our friends to come down." ...|$|E

500|$|Many {{have the}} custom {{to have high}} quality tefillin and {{beautiful}} tefillin bags as a Hiddur Mitzvah.

While this was happening the edit of the raw footage was being assembled. As the edit evolved we narrowed down the techniques and look of the worlds. Before we even had picture lock we were dropping in rendered 3D shots; <b>this</b> <b>really</b> allowed us to fine tune both the edit and the effects to work together with the song. As this progressed we regularly sent tests to Warner Bros. and the Madonna camp." ...|$|E

500|$|Describing the packaging, Kellman {{noted that}} it [...] "was sharp but not elaborate– a {{clamshell}} box with each disc packaged in a paper LP-replica sleeve. While the box is a convenient and reasonably priced way to obtain most of Madonna's releases, an investment of that scope should entail all the stray hits from the same era. <b>This</b> <b>really</b> could have used a 12th disc", for adding all the other songs released by Madonna.

He said, [...] "She comes back to her apartment after being thrown out the window by Christopher Walken and she goes mental. Her apartment's all pink and beautiful, and kind of creepy and infantile, then she just smashes it all up and spray paints stuff and transforms into Catwoman.
