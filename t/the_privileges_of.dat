5|$|Despite {{the aim of}} the NCMP {{scheme to}} {{ameliorate}} the impacts of the first-past-the-post system, its legitimacy is highly doubted. It is based neither on a clear electoral mandate like ordinary MPs, nor on expertise or specialization (as in the case of NMPs). As a result, <b>the</b> <b>privileges</b> <b>of</b> NCMPs are severely curtailed and this limits their effectiveness as alternative voices in Parliament.|$|E
5|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>privileges</b> <b>of</b> U.S. {{citizenship}} {{is the opportunity}} to become a commissioned officer in the Marine Corps. When there is a draft, a non-citizen can be drafted as a resident alien, or can join in the ranks as a foreigner, but cannot be an officer without U.S. citizenship.|$|E

The Constitution does not require Parliament to show that is necessary or expedient to restrict free speech in the interest of these grounds.|$|E
5|$|In 1529 {{the king}} summoned Parliament {{to deal with}} annulment, thus {{bringing}} together those who wanted reform but who disagreed what form it should take; it {{became known as the}} Reformation Parliament. There were Common lawyers who resented <b>the</b> <b>privileges</b> <b>of</b> the clergy to summon laity to their courts; there were those who had been influenced by Lutheran evangelicalism and were hostile to the theology of Rome; Thomas Cromwell was both. Henry's Chancellor, Thomas More, successor to Wolsey, also wanted reform: he wanted new laws against heresy.|$|E
5|$|The Emperors Hadrian, Septimius Severus and Constantius I all held {{court in}} York during their various campaigns. During his stay 207–211AD, the Emperor Severus proclaimed York {{capital of the}} {{province}} of Britannia Inferior, {{and it is likely}} that it was he who granted York <b>the</b> <b>privileges</b> <b>of</b> a colonia or city. Constantius I died in 306AD during his stay in York, and his son Constantine the Great was proclaimed Emperor by the troops based in the fortress. In 311AD a bishop from York attended the Council at Arles to represent Christians from the province.|$|E

5|$|The {{son of a}} {{prominent}} Isle of Man family with strong naval connections, Heywood joined Bounty under Lieutenant William Bligh {{at the age of}} 15 and, although unranked was given <b>the</b> <b>privileges</b> <b>of</b> a junior officer. Bounty left England in 1787 on a mission to collect and transport breadfruit from the Pacific, and arrived in Tahiti late in 1788. Relations between Bligh and certain of his officers, notably Fletcher Christian, became strained, and worsened during the five months that Bounty remained in Tahiti.|$|E
5|$|A Non-constituency Member of Parliament (NCMP) is {{a member}} of a Singaporean {{opposition}} political party who, according to the Constitution and Parliamentary Elections Act, is declared to have been elected a Member of the Parliament of Singapore despite having lost in a general election by virtue of having been one of the best-performing losers. NCMPs enjoy most of <b>the</b> <b>privileges</b> <b>of</b> ordinary Members of Parliament. They are, however, not allowed to vote on several types of bills such as bills to amend the Constitution and motions of no confidence in the Government. An election candidate who has been offered an NCMP seat may decline to take it up.|$|E

5|$|Although Mariano Moreno was a criollo, a Spanish citizen {{born in the}} Americas, he did {{not work}} with the other criollos of Buenos Aires who sought to promote {{political}} changes against <b>the</b> <b>privileges</b> <b>of</b> the Spanish-born. Unlike the criollo politicians Manuel Belgrano and Juan José Castelli, he did not support viceroy Liniers or the Carlotist project, which sought the coronation of Carlota of Spain in the Americas. He joined mayor Martín de Álzaga instead, which allowed him to serve as legal adviser of the Cabildo. In that capacity, he wrote a petition to the King of Spain, so that the Buenos Aires Cabildo was named Protector of the Cabildos of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata. As a result, all petitions from local cabildos to the King or the Viceroy would be channeled through the Cabildo at the capital.|$|E
5|$|Being {{the last}} male {{member of the}} House of Árpád, Andrew was elected king {{after the death of}} King Ladislaus IV in 1290. He was the first Hungarian monarch to issue a {{coronation}} diploma confirming <b>the</b> <b>privileges</b> <b>of</b> the noblemen and the clergy. At least three pretenders—Albert of Austria, Mary of Hungary, and an adventurer—challenged his claim to the throne. Andrew expelled the adventurer from Hungary and forced Albert of Austria to conclude a peace within a year, but Mary of Hungary and her descendants did not renounce their claim. The Hungarian bishops and Andrew's maternal family from Venice were his principal supporters, but the leading Croatian and Slavonian lords were opposed to his rule.|$|E
5|$|Democracy {{essentially}} means {{rule of the}} people. To build {{a democratic}} society and rule, there must be citizen participation by an informed electorate. The freedom to speak and express is thus crucial {{for the formation of}} public opinion on political questions, and is indispensable to the discovery and spread of political truth. In Singapore, the right to freedom of speech and expression is guaranteed to citizens by Article 14(1)(a) of the Constitution, though it is subject to many qualifications. Parliament may by law impose restrictions on the right as it considers necessary or expedient {{in the interest of the}} security of Singapore, friendly relations with other countries, public order or morality, and restrictions designed to protect <b>the</b> <b>privileges</b> <b>of</b> Parliament or to provide against contempt of court, defamation or incitement to any offence.|$|E

5|$|In 1228, Andrew {{authorized}} his son, Béla, {{to revise}} his previous land grants. Pope Honorius also supported Béla's efforts. Béla confiscated {{the domains of}} two noblemen, Simon Kacsics and Bánk Bár-Kalán, who had taken part in the conspiracy to murder Queen Gertrude. In 1229, upon Béla's proposal, Andrew confirmed <b>the</b> <b>privileges</b> <b>of</b> the Cuman chieftains who had subjected themselves to Béla. Robert, Archbishop of Esztergom, made a complaint about Andrew to the Holy See, because Andrew continued to employ Jews and Muslims. Pope Gregory IX authorized the archbishop to perform acts of religious censure to persuade Andrew to dismiss his non-Christian officials. Under duress, Andrew issued a new Golden Bull in 1231, which confirmed that Muslims were banned from employment, and empowered the Archbishop of Esztergom to excommunicate the king if he failed to honor {{the provisions of the}} new Golden Bull. In {{the second half of the}} year, Andrew invaded Halych and restored his youngest son, Andrew, to the throne.|$|E
5|$|Juan Larrea {{was born}} on June 24, 1782, {{in the city of}} Mataró, Catalonia. His father was Martín Ramón de Larrea, {{who was in charge of}} customs {{operations}} in Mataró, and his mother was Tomasa Espeso. He studied mathematics and navigation, and focused his education towards a career in commerce. His father died in 1793, so Larrea became the patriarch of the family. They moved to Buenos Aires, where he established a warehouse for wines, leather, and sugar. He traded with Peru, Upper Peru, Paraguay, Chile and colonial Brazil. By 1806 he was a well respected businessman, and a syndic of the Royal Consulate. He promoted the role of deputies from Buenos Aires at the Madrid court, to better the representation of the Brazilian viceroyalty and reduce <b>the</b> <b>privileges</b> <b>of</b> peninsular merchants.|$|E
5|$|Melchior Balassa, one of {{the wealthiest}} lords in John Sigismund's realm, deserted to Ferdinand in December 1561. John Sigismund moved to seize Balassa's domains, but his army was routed at Hadad (now Hodod in Romania) on 4 March 1562. Stirred up by Balassa, the Székely commoners rose to restore their ancient liberties (including {{exemption}} from taxes), which had been restricted in the 1550s. John Sigismund's army routed them in May, and their leaders were impaled or mutilated. The Diet adopted new laws to restrict <b>the</b> <b>privileges</b> <b>of</b> the Székelys, including a ban on the employment of commoners as jurors. Two new royal castles named Székelytámad ("Székely-assault") and Székelybánja ("Székely-regret") were erected in the Székely Land. After Balassa's revolt, most counties outside Transylvania changed allegiance from John Sigismund to Ferdinand. To persuade Ferdinand to renounce the counties, John Sigismund even offered not to style himself king, but this was rejected in July 1562.|$|E

5|$|Ralph wrote {{a sermon}} for {{the feast of}} the Assumption of the Virgin and it survives in some fifty Latin manuscripts, {{probably}} because it was thought to have been written by Anselm of Canterbury, until shown to be Ralph's in 1927. A surviving English translation of the sermon is also preserved in the manuscript British Library, Cotton Vespasian D. xiv. The Latin version, which Ralph was a translation of his originally spoken French version, has been edited and published in 1997. Ralph also had the monks of Christ Church, Canterbury search for documents relating to <b>the</b> <b>privileges</b> <b>of</b> Canterbury and had those documents copied into a manuscript which still survives, BM MS Cotton Cleopatra E. His seal {{is one of the first}} to take the usual form for bishop's seals, with Ralph standing, in full vestments including a mitre, and performing a benediction with his right hand while holding his crosier in his left. The seal took the form of a pointed oval.|$|E
5|$|Subsequently, the House of Plantagenet from Anjou {{inherited}} the English throne under Henry II, adding England to the budding Angevin Empire of fiefs {{the family had}} inherited in France including Aquitaine. They reigned for three centuries, some noted monarchs being Richard I, Edward I, Edward III and Henry V. The period saw changes in trade and legislation, including {{the signing of the}} Magna Carta, an English legal charter used to limit the sovereign's powers by law and protect <b>the</b> <b>privileges</b> <b>of</b> freemen. Catholic monasticism flourished, providing philosophers, and the universities of Oxford and Cambridge were founded with royal patronage. The Principality of Wales became a Plantagenet fief during the 13th century and the Lordship of Ireland was given to the English monarchy by the Pope.|$|E
5|$|A Hungarian army {{under the}} command of Ispán Denis stormed into Sirmium once more in spring 1166. The Hungarians routed a Byzantine army, and {{occupied}} the whole province with the exception of Zimony. Emperor Manuel sent three armies against Hungary. The first army, which was {{under the command}} of protostrator Alexios Axuch and Stephen III's brother, Béla, was stationed by the Danube to distract attention from the movements of the two other units, which plundered Transylvania {{under the command of}} Leon Batatzes and John Doukas. The Byzantine campaign caused great devastation in the eastern territories of the Kingdom of Hungary, forcing Stephen III to seek reconciliation. Upon his request, Henry Jasomirgott, Duke of Austria, whose wife was Emperor Manuel's niece, mediated an armistice. At the end of the year, Stephen married the Duke's daughter Agnes. Around the same time, a Hungarian army invaded Dalmatia and captured Nikephoros Chalouphes, the Byzantine governor of the province. Stephen confirmed estates in Biograd na Moru and <b>the</b> <b>privileges</b> <b>of</b> Sebenico in 1166 and 1167, respectively, proving that the two towns accepted his suzerainty after the campaign.|$|E
