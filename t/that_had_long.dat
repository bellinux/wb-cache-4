5|$|Based on morphology, John McEachran and Neil Aschliman {{determined}} in a 2004 phylogenetic study that Platyrhinoidis and Platyrhina together form the most basal clade {{of the order}} Myliobatiformes, and are thus the sister group to all {{other members of the}} order (encompassing stingrays and their relatives). This finding affirmed that the thornback guitarfish is not closely related to the true guitarfishes of the family Rhinobatidae, a possibility <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>long</b> been considered by taxonomists.|$|E
5|$|In 1897 Feliks Tyszkiewicz, {{a member}} of an old Ruthenian/Lithuanian noble family <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>long</b> had a {{presence}} in Palanga, built the Neo-Renaissance-style palace that now houses the museum. Designed by the German architect Franz Heinrich Schwechten, it fell into disrepair after the disruptions of World War I and World War II. The palace was restored in 1957 according to plans by the architect Alfredas Brusokas. It opened as an amber museum in 1963 as a branch of the Lithuanian Museum of Fine Arts, with a small collection of about 480 pieces; it received its millionth visitor on August 13, 1970. The palace was incorporated into the Lithuanian Art Museum during the 1990s, and continues to expand.|$|E
5|$|In late 1164 Roger led a {{deputation}} from Henry II that {{visited the}} papal court, or curia, {{to try to}} persuade Alexander III that any decision on the deposition of Becket should take place in England under a papal legate, rather than in Rome. While Becket was in exile, Roger also managed to secure papal permission for archbishops of York to carry their cross in front of them anywhere in England, a right <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>long</b> been a bone of contention between Canterbury and York. Later, the pope rescinded the permission, but consistently refused to give primacy to either Canterbury or York in their struggles.|$|E

5|$|Noriega was extradited to France on April 26, 2010. Noriega's lawyers {{claimed the}} La Santé Prison, {{at which he}} was held, was unfit {{for a man of}} his age and rank; the French {{government}} refused to grant him prisoner of war status, which he had in the United States. On July 7, 2010, Noriega was convicted by the 11th chamber of the Tribunal Correctionnel de Paris and sentenced to seven years in jail. The prosecutor in the case had sought a ten-year prison term. In addition, the court ordered the seizure of €2.3million (approximately U.S. $3.6million) <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>long</b> been frozen in Noriega's French bank accounts.|$|E
5|$|Depending on the player's actions, {{the newly}} {{reformed}} Etrurian Army then continues through either the snowy tundras of Ilia and its many mercenary groups on Bern's contract, {{or through the}} Sacae plains where nomad tribes have allied with Bern. Both paths ultimately take the Etrurian Army to Bern's borders, where Roy discovers a shrine housing the Binding Blade, a powerful weapon that rules over the other eight Divine Weapons. Combined with the Fire Emblem, Roy is granted its incredible power and wields the Binding Blade in the final assault on Bern's capital. Zephiel is eventually killed by the Etrurian Army and his Divine Weapon is taken from him, but the war does not end with his death. Before his last battle, Zephiel had sent his remaining forces to gather somewhere in Elibe. The eight Divine Weapons suddenly emit a light that leads the Lycian Army to this location: an ancient temple <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>long</b> ago been built by the dragons.|$|E
5|$|More {{accelerated}} {{classes were}} added, but {{the core of}} the gifted curriculum remained the individualized approaches and learning by doing <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>long</b> been central to the Avery Coonley curriculum. Nature study was still prominent in the student's activities, with music, art, and drama. The traditional learning themes and school projects involving maple trees, Native Americans, ancient Egypt and other topics were preserved but adapted to serve the gifted curriculum. In early 1980, an early childhood (EC) program for three-year-olds was launched, designed to cater to the needs of gifted preschool children and prepare them to transition from home to kindergarten. Again departing from the prevailing educational theory, Avery Coonley introduced academics in the EC program, with the same focus on nature, music, movement, and practical skills as the higher grades.|$|E

5|$|The Lexus LS {{marked the}} first {{successful}} entrant of a Japanese manufacturer into the prestige luxury arena, a market <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>long</b> been dominated by established European and American brands. By 1991, with the LS 400 its top-selling model, Lexus had overtaken Mercedes-Benz and BMW in overall U.S. sales, and in 2000, the marque passed Cadillac as the luxury sales leader in the largest automotive market. Rival manufacturers responded with lower prices and added features. In particular, Mercedes-Benz reorganized its operations, shifting to a targeted-cost process similar to Lexus production methods, and dropped competing U.S. base prices by nearly 10 percent. To rival the LS 400, extra features were rushed for {{the launch of the}} 1991 Mercedes-Benz S-Class (W140), causing budget overruns and costing the job of Daimler-Benz's chief engineer, Wolfgang Peter. Approximately 5 percent of 1989 LS 400 sales went to buyers employed by rival manufacturers, including GM, Ford, and Chrysler. When the LS 400 was disassembled for engineering analysis, Cadillac engineers concluded that the vehicle could not be built using existing GM methods. Industry publications noted the LS 400's precise panel gaps, and the subject became a common evaluation standard in road tests. The LS 430's interior noise level was later used by rival makes as a measure of cabin quiet.|$|E
5|$|The most bitter {{legal battle}} began in 1809. Evans sued Samuel Robinson—a miller near Baltimore who was using Evans's {{improvements}} {{without a license}} to produce a very modest amount of flour—for damages of $2,500. That sum was deemed unjustifiably high and harsh by many, and Evans's actions rallied the Baltimore community against him, and when the case was finally heard in 1812 many appeared {{in support of the}} defendant. Evans's detractors presented evidence and witnesses at the trial to press the argument that Evans did not truly invent much of what his patents protected. Although the hopper-boy was undoubtedly original, the use of bucket chains and Archimedean screws had been used since ancient times and Evans had only modified some of their features and adapted them for use in a milling context. A now retired Thomas Jefferson weighed into the debate in letters to both Evans and his detractors, questioning the philosophy of patent law and what truly defined 'invention' and 'machine' (and to some extent the validity of his claims) but ultimately defended the purpose of patent law, which was to incentivize innovation by rewarding inventors for their development and sharing of new technology. And Jefferson noted that though Evans's designs consisted of devices <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>long</b> existed beforehand, everyone had access to these and yet only Evans had thought to modify and use them in conjunction to build an automatic mill. Ultimately the jury found in favor of Evans, but it was a pyrrhic victory as Evans had put most of the milling community offside in the process, and ultimately reduced his claim against Robinson to $1,000. In response, prominent Evans critic Isaac McPherson, made submission to Congress {{in the wake of the}} trial entitled Memorial to the Congress of Sundry Citizens of the United States, Praying Relief from the Oppressive Operations of Oliver Evans' Patent, seeking to limit the compensation Evans could seek for his patent's use or for Congress to void it altogether. Although the Senate drafted a bill that would roll-back some of Evans's patent rights, it did not pass, and he continued to vigorously pursue his patent fees. It would not be until the Patent Act of 1836 that many of these issues, including what constituted originality in the context of a patent, would be addressed.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 17th century, {{calculus}} was developed independently and almost simultaneously by Isaac Newton (1642–1727) and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646–1716).

Though not itself a branch of geometry, it is applicable to geometry, and it solved two families of problems <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>long</b> been almost intractable: finding tangent lines to odd curves, and finding areas enclosed by those curves. The methods of calculus reduced these problems mostly to straightforward matters of computation.|$|E

25|$|Brunelleschi, {{and others}} like him, {{developed}} {{a passion for the}} highly refined style of Roman architecture, in which the forms and decorations followed rules of placement and proportion <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>long</b> been neglected. They sought to rediscover and apply these rules. It was a time of architectural theorising and experimentation. Brunelleschi built two large churches in Florence demonstrating how the new style could be applied, San Lorenzo's and Santo Spirito. They are essays in the Classical, with rows of cylindrical columns, Corinthian capitals, entablatures, semi-circular arches and apsidal chapels.|$|E
25|$|Improved cargo {{security}} {{is also an}} important benefit of containerization. The cargo is not visible to the casual viewer and thus is less likely to be stolen; the doors of the containers are usually sealed so that tampering is more evident. Some containers are fitted with electronic monitoring devices and can be remotely monitored for changes in air pressure, which happens when the doors are opened. This reduced the thefts <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>long</b> plagued the shipping industry. Recent developments have focused on the use of intelligent logistics optimization to further enhance security.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{copper production}} in Ireland, identified at Ross Island {{in the period}} 2400–2200 BC, was associated with early Beaker pottery.
