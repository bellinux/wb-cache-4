5|$|Later, between 2009 and 2011, {{another team}} of astronomers {{observed}} WASP-13b and WASP-21b <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>what</b> caused some Hot Jupiters to have anomalously high radii. The RISE photometric {{camera on the}} Liverpool Telescope was used to detect further transits. Two partial transits and two full transits were observed during this period, although the quality of both full transits was slightly compromised because of passing cloud cover. The collected observations, along with the JGT observations {{that were used to}} confirm the planet, were scaled to filter out errors such as background noise. The data was then used to re-define WASP-13b's parameters, including its age, mass, radius, and density. The study also noted that a limb darkening effect was present, a characteristic that may affect future atmospheric studies of the planet.|$|E
5|$|During {{his initial}} {{research}} into cyberculture, Idol ordered Beyond Cyberpunk! from Gareth Branwyn. The HyperCard stack, which included collections of essays on cyberpunk culture, inspired Idol to include similar material within the Cyberpunk album {{as a special}} edition digipak feature. Discussing the matter with Branwyn, Idol received an initial bid {{for the job of}} producing the disk from the writer. While this bid was under consideration by Idol's management company, Idol had purchased a book-on-disk by Jaime Levy at a Los Angeles bookstore. At the time, Levy was the author and publisher of Electronic Hollywood, one of the first magazines produced on floppy disk. Impressed by its contents, Idol set about contacting her for the job of producing the disk. Successfully under-bidding Branwyn, she was then given the job and a master tape of recorded songs – which were not yet compiled into CD format – for use in sampling. Levy was given permission to include whatever content she desired. Meeting Idol <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>what</b> he was interested in presenting in the disk, his only concern was that the whole cyberpunk genre be represented as much as possible.|$|E

The curve is banked at an angle θ from the horizontal, and {{the surface of the}} road is considered to be slippery. The objective is <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>what</b> angle the bank must have so the ball does not slide off the road. Intuition tells us that, on a flat curve with no banking at all, the ball will simply slide off the road; while with a very steep banking, the ball will slide to the center unless it travels the curve rapidly.|$|E

While going through hospital records, Coley found a sarcoma case study of one patient named Fred Stein, whose tumor disappeared following a high fever from erysipelas infection, now known as Streptococcus pyogenes. This sparked Coley's interest and drove him <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>what</b> few examples of similar cancer treatment had been previously recorded. He discovered that other medical pioneers including Robert Koch, Louis Pasteur, and Emil von Behring, had recorded observations of erysipelas infection coinciding with cancer regression.|$|E

After he had convinced them of the capture of Fort Caroline by showing them some of the spoil he had taken, and some prisoners he had spared, the spokesman of the company asked for a ship and sailors with which to return to France. Menéndez replied that he would willingly have given them one had they been Catholics, and had he any vessels left; but that his own ships had sailed with artillery for Fort San Mateo and with the captured women and children for Santo Domingo, and a third was retained to carry dispatches to Spain.|$|E

The second scenario adds ties to Triggers sequel, Chrono Cross. In a New Game +, the group can explore several temporal distortions to combat shadow versions of Crono, Marle, and Lucca, and to fight Dalton, who promises in defeat to raise an army {{in the town of}} Porre to destroy the Kingdom of Guardia. The group can then fight the Dream Devourer, a prototypical form of the Time Devourer—a fusion of Schala and Lavos seen in Chrono Cross. A version of Magus pleads with Schala to resist; though she recognizes him as her brother, she refuses to be helped and sends him away.

500|$|The group {{purposely}} {{cut short}} {{the amount of}} time set aside for recording the album, and did not notify its label before beginning work on the record. The members hoped that these steps would bring them back to the days when they were a young, broke band who had to finish an album before the money ran out. [...] "There was something really interesting about that creative process when we were starting out," [...] explained Stump. [...] "The more time you have, the more potential you have for excess." [...] He felt that the process was reminiscent of the making of Take This to Your Grave because both albums were created using a [...] "first-thought, best-thought" [...] mentality: [...] "I think we were trying <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>what</b> making a record that way would sound like now, but with four adult Fall Out Boys."

[...] Like von Ziegesar, Meester has also claimed to relate to Blair on certain levels. Prior to the show's debut in 2007, the actress stated that, [...] "The only way to play Blair, or any character, and make her human, is <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>what</b> she is inside me. And I know I have my insecurities, too." [...] She went on to say that, [...] "The way Blair and I are not alike when it comes to insecurities is: She pays so much attention to hers!"

500|$|Robinson {{described}} [...] "Flicker" [...] {{as more of}} a [...] "journey" [...] than a pop song, {{saying that}} it goes [...] "to a lot of different places" [...] structure-wise.

[...] The song also contains influences of disco, opening with a [...] "summer-y disco guitar" [...] before moving into [...] "hands-in-the-air synth blasts" [...] as a critic for Vice magazine described. The pitch shifting of the samples was influenced by the works of Jay Dilla. The song's composition and arrangement was compared by Spin magazine's Garrett Kamps to the works of Boards of Canada, while other listeners compared the track's use of soul samples to that of [...] "The Glory," [...] a track from Kanye West's third album Graduation (2007).|$|E

She did not romanticise Britain's culinary past: [...] "Farm and factory labourers, artisans and clerical workers, still lived on a very restricted diet... their cooking facilities were so primitive and their equipment so scanty that only the most basic forms of cookery could be attempted". But her constant benchmarks were honest ingredients and uncomplicated cooking. She condemned—and explained the alternatives to—the artificial, the ersatz, the [...] "notorious Chorleywood bread", and [...] "all synthetic aids to flavouring... Nobody has ever been able to find out why the English regard a glass of wine added to a soup or stew as a reckless extravagance {{and at the same time}} spend pounds on bottled sauces, gravy powders, soup cubes, ketchups and artificial flavourings".|$|E

[...] He dropped out of an MFA program at Syracuse University when in 1968 he felt a [...] "call to arms" [...] to move to San Francisco, where the nascent [...] scene was blossoming amid the counterculture there.

500|$|Sarah Stegall {{proposed}} that the episode works on two separate layers. On the top-most superficial layer, it functions as an outright parody, mimicking both the stylings of The X-Files as well as Cops. However, on the other layer, she notes that [...] "it's a serious look at validation." [...] Throughout the episode, Mulder is attempting to capture the monster on camera and expose it to a national audience. However, all of the witnesses to the monster function as unreliable narrators: a Hispanic woman with [...] "a history of medications", a homosexual [...] "Drama Queen", a prostitute, a [...] "terrified morgue attendant, and Deputy Wetzel. Stegall argues {{that all of these}} characters are from [...] "the wrong side of the tracks" [...] and would not be accepted, let alone believed, by [...] "a placid, middle-class society". In the end, the only reliable witness is the camera, but Stegall points out that [...] "the camera, suspiciously, never quite manages to find [...]" [...] Furthermore, she reasons that Mulder's biggest fear is not finding the monster. To back this idea up, she points out that Mulder not only fails <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>what</b> he is looking for, but he also fails before a live audience.|$|E

[...] Finding and managing to open a hidden safe, Nico finds diagrams and a DVD, with the latter she plays back at her own apartment before showing it to Andre Lobineau, an old friend of hers, finding it contained a message from Vernon about what he found, believing the bizarre storms happening across the world are a sign of a global catastrophe in the making. [...] Finding out about an abandoned theatre on the Ile St Louis in Paris, connected to a mask the killer had with her when she fled Vernon's murder, Nico heads out to investigate it but gets captured by Petra and her boss, Susarro.|$|E
500|$|According to Crowley, every {{individual}} has a True Will, to {{be distinguished from}} the ordinary wants and desires of the ego. The True Will is essentially one's [...] "calling" [...] or [...] "purpose" [...] in life. Some later magicians have taken this to include the goal of attaining self-realization by one's own efforts, {{without the aid of}} God or other divine authority. This brings them close to the position that Crowley held just prior to 1904. [...] Others follow later works such as Liber II, saying that one's own will in pure form is nothing other than the divine will. [...] Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law for Crowley refers not to hedonism, fulfilling everyday desires, but to acting in response to that calling. [...] The Thelemite is a mystic. [...] According to Lon Milo DuQuette, a Thelemite is anyone who bases their actions on striving to discover and accomplish their true will, when a person does their True Will, it is like an orbit, their niche in the universal order, and the universe assists them. [...] In order for the individual to be able to follow their True Will, the everyday self's socially-instilled inhibitions may have to be overcome via deconditioning. [...] Crowley believed that in order to discover the True Will, one had to free the desires of the subconscious mind from the control of the conscious mind, especially the restrictions placed on sexual expression, which he associated with the power of divine creation. He identified the True Will of each individual with the Holy Guardian Angel, a daimon unique to each individual. [...] The spiritual quest <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>what</b> you are meant to do and do it is also known in Thelema as the Great Work.|$|E
