500|$|Pregnant {{and often}} ill, Mary Godwin {{had to cope}} with Percy's joy at the birth of his son by Harriet Shelley in late 1814 and his {{constant}} outings with Claire Clairmont. Shelley and Clairmont were almost certainly lovers, which caused much jealously on Godwin's part. Shelley greatly offended Godwin at one point when during a walk in the French countryside he suggested that they both <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>plunge</b> into a stream naked as it offended her principles. She was partly consoled by the visits of Hogg, whom she disliked at first but soon considered a close friend. Percy Shelley seems to have wanted Mary Godwin and Hogg to become lovers; Mary did not dismiss the idea, since in principle she believed in free love. In practice, however, she loved only Percy Shelley and seems to have ventured no further than flirting with Hogg. On 22 February 1815, she gave birth to a two-months premature baby girl, who was not expected to survive. On 6 March, she wrote to Hogg: ...|$|E
500|$|Wright {{frequently}} published science fiction, including Edmond Hamilton's first story, {{which appeared}} in August 1926, and work by J. Schlossel and Otis Adelbert Kline, [...] as well as weird and occult fiction. [...] The first magazine devoted entirely to science fiction joined Weird Tales on the newsstands on 10 March 1926, titled Amazing Stories and dated April. [...] Gernsback had delayed the launch {{a couple of years}} after his subscriber survey had shown only limited interest in an sf magazine, but finally decided to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>plunge.</b> [...] He ceased publication of Practical Electrics (recently retitled The Experimenter) but retained the editor, T. O'Conor Sloane, to edit the new magazine, though Gernsback had final say over the fiction content. [...] The first issue of Amazing consisted entirely of reprinted material, including Jules Verne's novel Off on a Comet, and stories by H.G. Wells and Edgar Allan Poe, but new fiction quickly appeared, with Clare Winger Harris and A. Hyatt Verrill each finding success in one of Gernsback's early reader competitions. [...] Both went on to become established writers. [...] Gernsback also introduced a letter column, and encouraged his readers to join in lively discussions there. [...] In the view of Mike Ashley, a historian of science fiction, this was [...] "the real secret of [...] the success of Amazing Stories and is the cause of the popularity of science fiction": the letter column gave science fiction fans, many of whom were lonely, a forum in which to make friends and talk about their interests. [...] The resulting community of like-minded readers gave birth to science fiction fandom, and also to a generation of writers who had grown up reading the genre.|$|E
