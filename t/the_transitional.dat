5|$|Somalia, from 1991 to 2006, {{is cited}} as a {{real-world}} example of a stateless society and legal system. Since the fall of Siad Barre's government in January 1991, {{there had been no}} central government in Somalia until the establishment of <b>the</b> <b>Transitional</b> National Government and its successor <b>the</b> <b>Transitional</b> Federal Government. Large areas of the country such as Puntland, Somaliland and Galmudug were internationally unrecognized and administered as autonomous regions of Somalia. The remaining areas, including the capital Mogadishu, were divided into smaller territories ruled by competing faction leaders. In many areas, there were no formal regulations or licensing requirements for businesses and individuals.|$|E

5|$|Although Ibn Haukal {{reports the}} sack of Samandar by Sviatoslav, the Rus' leader {{did not bother}} to occupy the Khazar heartlands north of the Caucasus Mountains permanently.

Therefore, Khazar {{successor}} statelets continued their precarious existence in the region.

President Yusuf requested that the African Union deploy military forces in Somalia. However, as the AU lacked the resources to do so, Yusuf brought in his own militia from Puntland. Along with the U.S. funding the ARPCT coalition, this alarmed many in south-central Somalia, and recruits flocked to the ascendant Islamic Courts Union (ICU).|$|E
