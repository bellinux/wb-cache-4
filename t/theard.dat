5000|$|In June 2015, Aux armes et cætera {{as well as}} both other Serge Gainsbourg reggae albums (Mauvaises nouvelles des étoiles and a live album), all {{featuring}} The Revolutionaries with Sly & Robbie, were reissued by the Mercury label in a Bruno Blum-produced, triple CD, [...] "Super DeLuxe", 10" [...] book set. The book {{text was}} written by Bruno Blum and features original producer Philippe Lerichomme photographs. Called Serge Gainsbourg & the Revolutionaries, it includes several previously unreleased mixes and versions, such as Javanaise Remake with the 1964 original version-styled [...] "sham-dam sham-dam" [...] backing vocals added in 2002. Other previously unreleased versions include Brigade des Stups, as well as alternate vocal takes of Marilou Reggae Dub, Vieille Canaille (Sam <b>Theard's</b> You Rascal You) and an incomplete Lola Rastaquouère. Previously unreleased recordings from the other two albums are also included, making this set the definitive, complete Gainsbourg reggae sessions set.|$|R
5000|$|In Jamaica in 1979, he {{recorded}} [...] "Aux Armes et cætera", a reggae {{version of the}} French national anthem [...] "La Marseillaise", with Robbie Shakespeare, Sly Dunbar and Rita Marley. Following harsh and anti-semitic criticism in right-wing newspaper Le Figaro by Charles de Gaulle biographer Michel Droit, his song earned him death threats from right-wing veteran soldiers of the Algerian War of Independence, who were opposed to their national anthem being arranged in reggae style. In 1979, a show had to be cancelled, because an angry mob of French Army parachutists came to demonstrate in the audience. Alone onstage, Gainsbourg raised his fist and answered [...] "The true meaning of our national anthem is revolutionary" [...] and sang it with the audience. The soldiers joined them, a scene enjoyed by millions as French TV news broadcast it, creating more publicity. Shortly afterward, Gainsbourg bought the original manuscript of [...] "La Marseillaise". He replied to his critics that his version was closer to the original as the manuscript shows the words [...] "Aux armes et cætera..." [...] for the chorus. This album, described by legendary drummer Sly Dunbar as [...] "Perhaps the best record he ever played on" [...] was his biggest commercial success, including major hits Lola Rastaquouère, Aux Armes Et Cætera and a French version of Sam <b>Theard's</b> jazz classic You Rascal You entitled Vieille Canaille. Rita Marley and the I-Three would record another controversial reggae album with him in 1981, Mauvaises nouvelles des étoiles. Bob Marley was furious, when he discovered that Gainsbourg made his wife Rita sing erotic lyrics. Posthumous new mixes, including dub versions by Soljie Hamilton and versions of both albums by Jamaican artists were released as double [...] "Dub Style" [...] albums in 2003, to critical praise in France as well as abroad and to international commercial success. Although belatedly, Aux Armes Et Cætera - Dub Style and Mauvaises Nouvelles Des Étoiles - Dub Style further posthumously established Gainsbourg as an influential icon in European pop music.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Theard</b> {{was born}} in New Orleans, Louisiana. He started working with a circus in 1923, and began {{performing}} in theatres and nightclubs.

[...] The song was covered by several artists.|$|E
5000|$|In early 1948 he left Page, formed his {{own small}} group, and was signed to Mercury Records where {{he cut his}} first single [...] "Fine As Wine" [...] with a B side [...] "Rock Around the Clock" [...] (not the same title made famous by Bill Haley), co-written with Sam <b>Theard.</b> For the Savoy label of Newark, New Jersey he {{recorded}} the instrumental [...] "Corn Bread," [...] which made #1 on the R&B charts in September 1948, and gave Singer a new popularity and nickname. His follow-up the following year, [...] "Beef Stew," [...] was a much smaller hit.|$|E
50|$|The {{song was}} written by Sam <b>Theard,</b> a New Orleans-born blues singer and songwriter, and was co-credited to Fleecie Moore, Jordan's wife, who never wrote a lyric in her life (however, her name was {{sometimes}} substituted for Jordan's to get around an inconvenient publishing contract; this strategy backfired when Louis and Fleecie divorced acrimoniously and she kept ownership of the songs he'd put her name on -- thus denying him any income from them). Jordan and the Tympany Five performed the song in the 1947 film Reet, Petite, and Gone, although the studio recording rather than a live performance {{is used in the}} soundtrack.|$|E

5000|$|Two other singles {{were taken}} from the album: Vieille canaille (a French version of You Rascal You written in the 1920s by Sam <b>Theard)</b> and Gainsbourg's own Lola Rastaquouère. A short European tour {{featuring}} the Jamaican group The Revolutionaries (see-line-up below) but not the I-Three followed in December 1979, culminating in a series of shows in Paris. At a show in Strasbourg, outraged paratroopers showed up in the concert hall and the show was cancelled. Serge Gainsbourg nevertheless came onstage on his own and courageously sang the regular national anthem, stating that he gave [...] "La Marseillaise its original revolutionary meaning back". The soldiers then sang along with him in a military salute posture. The event was shown on TV news, causing more controversy and sarcasm - and boosting album sales.The Paris shows at Le Palais were recorded by Philippe Lerichomme, mixed by Bruno Blum and engineer Thierry Bertomeu and issued as a double CD, Gainsbourg et cætera in 2006.|$|E
40|$|AbstractTheard gene encodes a β-subunit ofDrosophila nicotinic {{acetylcholine}} receptors specifically {{expressed in}} a subset of neurons. To identify thecis-regulatory region responsible for this cell-specific expression, various 5 ′ fragments of <b>theard</b> gene were fused to alacZ reporter gene and introduced into theDrosophila genome. A DNA fragment spanning ∼ 760 bp upstream and ∼ 140 bp downstream of a cluster of putative transcription start sites produced a pattern of β-galactosidase activity that resembles the distribution of ARD transcripts.
