6000|$|Mr. and Mrs. Ovid Vere had {{a little}} dinner party to {{celebrate}} their return. Teresa (advanced to the dignity of housekeeper) insisted on stuffing <b>the</b> <b>tomatoes</b> <b>and</b> cooking the macaroni with her own hand. The guests were Lord and Lady Northlake; Maria and Zo; Miss Minerva and Mr. Mool. Mr. Gallilee was present {{as one of the}} household. While he was in London, he and his children lived under Ovid's roof. When they went to Scotland, Mr. Gallilee had a cottage of his own (which he insisted on buying) in Lord Northlake's park. He and Zo drank too much champagne at dinner. The father made a speech; and the daughter sang, [...] "We're gayly yet." ...|$|E
60|$|A few {{palms and}} fields of {{feathery}} sugar cane bordered the road. Then Kit saw vines, tied to sticks and growing in hot dust, and {{by and by}} a thread of water in a deep barranco. Washerwomen knelt by the channel, beating wet clothes with stones, and Kit understood afterwards why his shirts wore out. Some {{of the women were}} young, but when he stopped for a moment at the bridge they did not look up. To beat the clothes was their job, and maize flour and goat's milk cheese are dear. Farther on, Kit saw others, carrying big earthen jars on their heads. They looked like Moorish women, for their feet and arms were very brown, and long black shawls half hid their faces. In the fields, barefooted men laboured among <b>the</b> <b>tomatoes</b> <b>and</b> vines. It was obvious the peons did not sleep in the afternoon; {{but for the most part}} their white clothes were good and they looked happy.|$|E

50|$|Skin <b>the</b> <b>tomatoes</b> <b>and</b> {{remove their}} cores. Using a blender, liquefy <b>the</b> <b>tomatoes</b> <b>and</b> garlic {{and add the}} vinegar and seasoning.

40|$|<b>The</b> use of <b>tomato</b> {{vibration}} analysis after impact excitation as a non-destructive physical quality measurement was investigated. For this purpose, an {{off-line test}} set-up was constructed that automatically impacts <b>the</b> <b>tomato</b> <b>and</b> captures <b>the</b> response. It is {{shown that the}} resonant frequency of the first elliptical mode of <b>the</b> <b>tomato</b> is related to its firmness. The exact location of the resonant frequency was obtained by first smoothing the spectra, and then taking the first derivative. It is shown that smoothing both increases the robustness of the estimates, and also lowers the number of erratic measurements. A comparison is made between measurements taken at the equator of <b>the</b> <b>tomato</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> bottom. Due to the non-homogeneity of a <b>tomato,</b> <b>the</b> measurements at the bottom were more reliable. (C) 2001 IMACS. Published by Elsevier Science B. V.

5000|$|Onions are sauteed {{with the}} heated butter or oil, then the green peppers. Once the onions become soft and lighter in colour, <b>the</b> <b>tomatoes</b> <b>and</b> peppers are added.

5000|$|... "Fight Like a Girl" [...] is {{a country}} song about female empowerment.

5000|$|Israeli {{salad is}} made of chopped raw tomato, onion and cucumber, and can also include pepper, carrot, scallion, leafy greens and parsley. The salad is dressed with either fresh lemon juice or olive oil, or both. Za'atar and yogurt are very common {{dressings}} at breakfast while sumac and tahini are common {{the rest of the}} day. Generally, the cucumbers are not peeled. The key is using very fresh vegetables and chopping them as finely as possible. [...] The ability to chop <b>the</b> <b>tomatoes</b> <b>and</b> cucumbers into the [...] "finest, most perfect dice" [...] is considered a mark of status among many kibbutz cooks.|$|E
50|$|While {{the dish}} {{originated}} from fishermen of the Neapolitan area, who would sautée the catch {{of the day}} in seawater together with tomatoes and extra virgin olive oil, the term itself most likely originated from Tuscany; Mezzadria peasants would make wine, but had to give most to the landlord, leaving little left for them to drink. The peasants were resourceful, however, and mixed the stems, seeds, and pomace left over from the wine production with large quantities of water, brought it to a boil, then hermetically sealed in a terracotta vase and fermented it for several days. Called l'acquarello or l'acqua pazza, the result was a water barely colored with wine, which the fisherman may have been reminded of when seeing the broth of the dish, colored slightly red by <b>the</b> <b>tomatoes</b> <b>and</b> oil.|$|E
5000|$|Though {{translated}} literally as [...] "oxtail soup" [...] (牛尾汤 Niúwěi tāng), {{this version}} of the dish is somewhere between a soup and a stew. One of the defining characteristics of oxtail soup is that it contains a large mass of solid ingredients, rather than ingredients that have been diced or shredded as is the norm with Chinese soup. Chunks of oxtail, potato, carrots, cabbage, tomato, and mushrooms are mixed in water, and salted to taste. The mixture should be heated at a slow boil, to allow time for the ingredients to release their flavors. In particular, <b>the</b> <b>tomatoes</b> <b>and</b> potatoes should largely disintegrate into the water, giving the broth a reddish-orange coloration and thickening it. As to be expected, oils from the oxtail lend most of the flavor. The soup is served with all of the ingredients.|$|E
