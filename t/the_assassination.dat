5|$|Although {{the exact}} details of <b>the</b> <b>assassination</b> remain disputed, the {{involvement}} of the Portuguese government, particularly Aginter Press or PIDE, is generally accepted by most historians and biographers and is supported by the Portuguese stay behind Gladio-esque army, known as Aginter Press, that suggested in 1990 that they were responsible for <b>the</b> <b>assassination.</b> Initially, due to the uncertainty regarding who was responsible, Mondlane's death created great suspicion within the ranks of the FRELIMO itself and a short power struggle which resulted in a dramatic swing to the political left.|$|E

5|$|Immediately after Luna's death, {{confusion}} reigned on both sides. The Americans {{even thought}} Luna {{had taken over}} to replace Aguinaldo. Luna's death was publicly declared only by 8 June, and a circular providing details of the event released by 13 June. While investigations were supposedly made concerning Luna's death, not one person was convicted. Later, General Pantaleon García {{said that it was}} he who was verbally ordered by Aguinaldo to conduct <b>the</b> <b>assassination</b> of Luna at Cabanatuan. His sickness at the time prevented his participation in <b>the</b> <b>assassination.</b> Aguinaldo would be firm in his stand that {{he had nothing to do}} with <b>the</b> <b>assassination</b> of Luna.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>assassinations</b> {{that took}} place during summer and autumn 1941, {{starting}} with Colonel Pierre-Georges Fabien's shooting of a German officer in the Paris Métro, caused fierce reprisals and executions of hundreds of French hostages.

5|$|Lorković was a keen {{advocate}} for the amalgamation of all Croatian parties into a 'super-party' to secede from the Kingdom of Yugoslavia and on 4 October 1934 swore his Ustaše oath.

5|$|On 14 June, Ilić went to Tuzla {{to bring}} the weapons to Sarajevo. Miško Jovanović hid the weapons in a large box of sugar. On 15 June, the two went {{separately}} by train to Doboj where Jovanović handed off the box to Ilić. Later that day, Ilić returned to Sarajevo by train, being careful to transfer to a local train outside Sarajevo and then quickly transfer to a tram to avoid police detection. Once at his mother's house, Ilić hid the weapons in a suitcase under a sofa. Then, on approximately 17 June, Ilić traveled to Brod (Dedijer puts it on 16 June, but trial records put it on 18 June). Questioned at trial, Ilić gave a confused explanation {{of the reason for}} his trip, first saying he had gone to Brod to prevent <b>the</b> <b>assassination</b> and then saying he had returned to Sarajevo from Brod to prevent <b>the</b> <b>assassination.</b> Dedijer puts forward the thesis (citing Bogijević) that Ilić went to Brod to meet an emissary of Apis, Djuro Ŝarac, who had instructions to cancel <b>the</b> <b>assassination</b> and then later Rade Malobabić was dispatched from Serbia to Sarajevo to reauthorize <b>the</b> <b>assassination.</b>|$|E

50|$|Nevertheless, having decided upon {{war with}} German support, Austria {{was slow to}} act publicly, and did not deliver the {{ultimatum}} until July 23, some three weeks after <b>the</b> <b>assassinations</b> on 28 June.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>assassination</b> of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, heir {{presumptive}} to the Austro-Hungarian throne, {{and his wife}} Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg, occurred on 28 June 1914 in Sarajevo when they were mortally wounded by Gavrilo Princip. Princip {{was one of a}} group of six assassins (five Serbs and one Bosniak) coordinated by Danilo Ilić, a Bosnian Serb and a member of the Black Hand secret society. The political objective of <b>the</b> <b>assassination</b> was to break off Austria-Hungary's South Slav provinces so they could be combined into a Yugoslavia. The assassins' motives were consistent with the movement that later became known as Young Bosnia. <b>The</b> <b>assassination</b> led directly to the First World War when Austria-Hungary subsequently issued an ultimatum to the Kingdom of Serbia, which was partially rejected. Austria-Hungary then declared war, triggering actions leading to war between most European states.|$|E
