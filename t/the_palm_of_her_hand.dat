25|$|In 1440, {{the poet}} Kabir was also {{said to have}} been born of a virgin widow (a Hindu), through <b>the</b> <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand.</b> Like Karna, Kabir was sent down the river in a basket; he was found and adopted by a family of Muslim weavers, downstream. This (presumably posthumous) account—which depicts Kabir as {{secretly}} descended from Hindus—was intended to legitimise Kabir's religious authority {{in the eyes of the}} Hindu population who venerated his works. This story is absent from Muslim and Sikh accounts of Kabir's work.|$|E
25|$|Pathologist Luca Lalli, from Perugia's {{forensic}} science institute, performed the autopsy on Kercher's body. Her injuries consisted of sixteen bruises and seven cuts. These included several bruises {{and a couple}} of insubstantial cuts on <b>the</b> <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand.</b> Bruises on her nose, nostrils, mouth, and underneath her jaw were compatible with a hand being clamped over her mouth and nose. Lalli's autopsy report was reviewed by three pathologists from Perugia's {{forensic science}} institute who interpreted the injuries, including some to the genital region, as indicating an attempt to immobilize Kercher during sexual violence.|$|E
25|$|Surmounted on {{the main}} altar is a {{beautiful}} statue of St. Lucy holding up her eyes on <b>the</b> <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand.</b> The exquisite stained glass windows when lit by sunlight create a panorama of colour further enhancing the transepts of the church. In a {{far corner of the}} church is a circular Baptismal Font of white marble carved with cherubs, and crowned by a statue of John the Baptist. On going up the narrow staircase that leads to the choir loft, one encounters 'Anthony Thomas', an enormous bell weighing 4300lbs. The bell has intricate engravings of elaborate floral wreaths and holy figures and symbols of Christianity, and it is the largest of the four bells shipped from Marseilles and christened at the cathedral in 1903. The choir loft also contains a unique pipe organ donated to the cathedral in 1934.|$|E
