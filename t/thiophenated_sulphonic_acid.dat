The sulphonated self-assembled polyaniline and derivatised polyaniline nanocomposites (SPAHs) were prepared by chemical oxidative polymerisation or electrical decomposition. The SPAHs prepared include those of polyaniline (PANi), poly-o-methoxyaniline (POMA) and poly- 2. 5 dimethoxyaniline (PDMA).

Ceric methane sulphonate was prepared as homogeneous solution as well as yellow crystalline solid in 2 M methane <b>sulphonic</b> <b>acid</b> under optimized conditions. The order of ease of chemical oxidation of these compounds is as follows: p-Ethoxy toluene > Toluene > p-isopropyl toluene > o-chloro toluene. The duration of chemical oxidation depends on the reaction temperature and the concentration of methane <b>sulphonic</b> <b>acid.</b> Higher concentration of methane <b>sulphonic</b> <b>acid</b> decreases the duration of oxidation.

Free-standing blend films of polypyrrole and plasticized polyvinyl chloride (PVC) were obtained by casting an homogeneous suspension of the two polymers in tetrahydrofuran. The maximum conductivity of the blend film is similar to 0. 3 S/cm, corresponding to a weight fraction of 0. 16 w/w polypyrrole. The blend film is semiconducting in the range 300 - 10 K. A TG-DTA scan indicates the blend film to be amorphous with a stepwise decomposition process similar to pristine PVC. The choice of a dual dopant system during synthesis and the plasticised polymer during subsequent processing were keys to obtaining homogeneous high-quality films.

40|$|Ordered {{mesoporous}} {{phenolic resins}} are an advanced class of ultra-stable mesoporous materials that offer potential {{applications in the}} field of catalysis. Two select examples of asymmetric catalysis will be presented. First, the Jacobsen catalyst N,N'-bis(3, 5 -di-tert-butylsalicylidene) - 1, 2 -cyclohexanediaminomanganese (III) chloride is covalently immobilized and highly dispersed on mesoporous phenolic resins through a direct and simple procedure. This novel catalytic system shows high catalytic activity and excellent enantioselectivity in the asymmetric epoxidation of diline. The heterogeneized Jacobsen catalyst is demonstrated to be a re-usable and zero-leaching catalyst system. In a second example, the mesoporous phenolic resins were functionalized with <b>sulphonic</b> <b>acid</b> groups and acted as novel support for the non-covalent immobilization of a L-phenylalanine derived chiral diamine organocatalyst for asymmetric aldol reactions. The immobilization is established by an acid-base interaction between the <b>sulphonic</b> <b>acid</b> group and the amine function.

AIM: This study examined the effect of dietary nucleosides and nucleotides supplementation on trinitrobenzene <b>sulphonic</b> <b>acid</b> induced colonic damage in experimental colitis. METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats were randomised into two groups and fed nucleic acid free 20 % casein diet (control) or this diet supplemented with 0. 5 % nucleoside-nucleotide mixture for four weeks. On the second week, colonic inflammation was induced in rats by intracolonic administration of 0. 25 ml of 50 % ethanol containing 25 mg of trinitrobenzene <b>sulphonic</b> <b>acid.</b> Additionally, other sets of rats were treated with 0. 25 ml of 50 % ethanol, 25 mg of trinitrobenzene <b>sulphonic</b> <b>acid</b> in 0. 25 ml saline, or 0. 25 ml of 0. 9 % saline. RESULTS: After two weeks, colon weight, macroscopic and microscopic damage scores, were significantly greater (p < 0. 05) in the nucleoside-nucleotide supplemented group compared with the non-supplemented control groups. The same variables seen in the trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid-ethanol group fed nucleoside-nucleotide free diet were greater (p < 0. 05) than {{in the rest of}} the groups fed nucleoside-nucleotide free diet and treated with ethanol, trinitrobenzene <b>sulphonic</b> <b>acid</b> in saline, or saline. Histologically, segmental ulceration and inflammation associated with significantly increased infiltration of polymorphonuclear leucocytes, macrophages, lymphocytes, fibroblasts were observed in the supplemented group compared with the controls. In the nucleoside-nucleotide supplemented group the epithelial damage, mucosal erosion, oedema, and coagulative necrosis of the muscularis propria was more extensive in comparison to the non-supplemented control groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that dietary nucleosides and nucleotides may aggravate colonic damage and inflammation in chemically induced experimental colitis in rats; and that nucleoside-nucleotide free diet combined with other pharmacological agents may offer a better response...|$|R

The isomeric products formed in both these reactions were separated by g. l. c.
