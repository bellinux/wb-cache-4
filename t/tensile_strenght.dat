40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} their strength potential, the fracture properties {{of different types of}} commercial boron fibers were measured before and after application of secondary strengthening treatments. The principal treatments employed were a slight chemical polish, which removed low strength surface flaws, and a heat treatment in oxygen, which contracted the fibers and thereby compressed intrinsic bulk flaws. Those fiber types most significantly strengthened were 200 to 400 micrometers (8 to 16 mil) diameter boron on tungsten fibers produced in a single chemical vapor deposition reactor. The slight polish increased average <b>tensile</b> <b>strenghts</b> from 3. 4 to 4. 4 CN/m 2 (500 to 640 ksi) and reduced coefficients of variation from about 15 to 3 percent. The oxygen heat treatment plus slight polish further improved average strengths to 5. 5 GN/m 2 (800 ksi) with coefficients near 3 percent. To ascertain whether these excellent properties could be retained after fabrication of B/Al composites, as produced and polished 203 micrometers (8 mil) fibers were thinly coated with aluminum, heat treated at B/Al fabrication temperatures, and then tested in tension and flexure at room temperature. The pre-polished fibers were observed to retain their superior strengths to higher temperatures than the as-produced fibers even though both were subjected to the same detrimental reaction with aluminum...|$|R

The fiber-reinforced metal matrix composites are a potential heat sink material for the PFC application, since the combination of different material properties can lead to versatile performances. In this article, the overall mechanical properties of two model composites based on theoretical predictions are presented. The matrix materials considered were a precipitation hardened CuCrZr alloy and reduced activation martensitic steel 'Eurofer'.

Antam Pomalaa Kolaka Southeast Sulawesi province during the period 2011 - 2012 period approximately 1 million tons of slag / year, with a nickel content in ore processing of nickel is between 1. 80 % to 2. 00 %. Visually, the physical form of this nickel slag aggregate resembles. Research {{on the use of}} nickel slag as an aggregate in concrete mixture is carried out using a cylindrical specimen with a diameter of 15 cm and 30 cm high by 48 pieces were tested at 28 days with some variations in the mix. Variation 01, 100 % natural aggregate, variation 02, nickel slag as coarse aggregate, variation 03, nickel slag as fine aggregate, and variation 04, nickel slag as coarse aggregate and fine aggregate. Aggregate gradation in the mixture is set and is designed so that it meets the specifications gradation mix for maximum aggregate size of 40 mm. The composition of the concrete mixture used is a mixture of concrete with the ratio of cement : fine aggegate : coarse aggregate is 1 : 2 : 3 in a weight ratio with cement water ratio (fas) is set at 0. 5. The results showed that when compared with the use of natural agregate, terak nickel is used only as a coarse agregate, a fine agregate only and combined agregate coarse and fine agregates resulting slump values ??fell 39. 47 %, an increase of 55. 26 %, and an increase of 34. 21 %.

40|$|The {{individual}} and combined {{influence on the}} bleaching of wool of the concentration of hydrogen peroxide, temperature and time of treatment have been studied, using a rotatable central design of experiments in which {{the values of the}} above variables covered the values used in industry. Mathematical treatment of the values of the optical, chemical and mechanical parameters has enabled equations to be derived, from which the value of any parameter can be computed when the values of the variables are within the range of the plan of experiments, resulting in a good agreement being obtained between experimental and calculated values. Use of these equations facilitates optimization of the process of wool bleaching, and bleaching conditions leading to the whitest 'wool have been suggested for an allowable chemical degradation (alkali solubilities of 25 % and 30 %). More severe conditions of bleaching do not necessarily produce a whiter wool, but cause greater chemical and mechanical degradation of the fibre. An excellent linear correlation has been found between thc chemical parameters modified by the bleaching operation ant between these wet <b>tensile</b> <b>strenght</b> of the fibre...|$|E

Title of the Thesis A {{study of}} a novel dry binder {{composed}} of α-lactose monohydrate, microcrystalline cellulose and corn starch This paper deals with {{a study of the}} novel dry binder Combilac®, which contains 70 % of α-lactose monohydrate, 20 % of microcrystalline cellulose and 10 % of native starch. These tests include flow properties, compressibility, lubricant sensitivity, <b>tensile</b> <b>strenght</b> and disintegration time of tablets. Compressibility is evaluated by means of the energy profile of compression proces and tablet strenght. The above-mentioned parameters are also evaluated in the physical mixture of α-lactose monohydrate, microcrystalline cellulose and native corn starch and results are compared. Combilac® and physical mixture cannot be compressed without lubricants due to high friction and sticking to the matrix. Combilac® shows much better flowability than the physical mixture of the used dry binders, its compressibility is better and the total energy is higher. Tablets possess a higher tensile strength and higher lubricant sensitivity. Disintegration time of Combilac® tablets is comparable with the disintegration time [...] ...|$|E
