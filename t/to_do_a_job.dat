500|$|Into Temptation {{marks the}} second film by {{independent}} filmmaker Patrick Coyle, who {{wrote and directed}} the 2003 drama film Detective Fiction. Coyle said Into Temptation was partially inspired by his father, James Patrick Coyle, a kind but belligerent {{man who had been}} encouraged by his mother to become a priest. James entered seminary but dropped out before ordination after he was drafted into serving overseas in World War II and met Margaret Mary Quinlan, who would become his wife and Patrick Coyle's mother. Coyle conceived of the script for Into Temptation while imagining what kind of priest his father would have been. His father strongly approved of the project, and told Coyle, [...] "Go make that movie. And tell the truth." [...] Coyle was also partially inspired by his childhood pastor and friend, the Reverend Damian Zuerlein, who performed the marriage ceremony for Coyle and his wife and baptized their children. Coyle said of him, [...] "He's just a young, energetic, competent, committed, devoted man working with a poor parish. And he loves his work. I was inspired by that." [...] Coyle said when writing Into Temptation, he did not intend to make a religious film, and said of protagonist Father John Buerlein, [...] "The character could have been a minister or a rabbi or a public defender. He's a good man trying <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> the best he can." ...|$|E

[...] After meeting French at Nauuwport Kitchener recorded (14 February 1902) [...] "he was quite cheerful and happy about progress made, though {{it appears to me}} slow".

2500|$|The United States, while {{attempting}} to erect an alliance {{in the form of}} a Middle East Defense Organization to keep the Soviet Union out of the Near East, [...] tried to woo Nasser into this alliance. The central problem for American policy in the Middle East was that this region was perceived as strategically important due to its oil, but the United States, weighed down by defense commitments in Europe and the Far East, lacked sufficient troops to resist a Soviet invasion of the Middle East. In 1952, General Omar Bradley of Joint Chiefs of Staff declared at a planning session about what to do in the event of a Soviet invasion of the Near East: [...] "Where will the staff come from? It will take a lot of stuff <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> there".|$|E
2500|$|Today {{legislation}} bans discrimination, that is {{unrelated to}} an employee's ability <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>job,</b> based on sex, race, ethnicity, national origin, age and disability. The Equal Pay Act of 1963 banned gender pay discrimination, amending the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. Plaintiffs must show an employing entity pays them less than someone {{of the opposite}} sex in an [...] "establishment" [...] for work of [...] "equal skill, effort, or responsibility" [...] under [...] "similar working conditions". Employing entities may raise a defense that pay differences result from a seniority or merit system unrelated to sex. For example, in Corning Glass Works v Brennan the Supreme Court held that although women plaintiffs worked at different times in the day, compared to male colleagues, the working conditions were [...] "sufficiently similar" [...] and the claim was allowed. One drawback is the equal pay provisions are subject to multiple exemptions for groups of employees found in the FLSA 1938 itself. Another is that equal pay rules only operate within workers of an [...] "enterprise", so that it has no effect upon high paying enterprises being more male dominated, nor child care being unequally shared between men and women that affects long term career progression. Sex discrimination includes discrimination based on pregnancy, and is prohibited in general by the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964.|$|E

He glared back at me. 'I appreciate that, but I {{want you to know}} that I'm not willing to do the same for you.' And then he left. Jim [...] snorted, 'I can't believe that he just said that.' There was no way I could ever drop the belt to him now: he'd just shown complete disrespect not only to me, but to the position of champion..." [...] This exchange is confirmed in Dave Meltzer's account: [...] "During the meeting, Hart told Michaels that he'd be happy to put him over at the end of the run, but Michaels told Hart flat-out that he wouldn't return the favor. Michaels and Hart spoke again on the subject on 10/12 in San Jose, when once again Michaels told Hart that he wasn't going <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> for him." [...] Additionally, in Forgiven Vince Russo stated, [...] "Well - no surprise here - Bret refused to do the job (get pinned) for Shawn in Canada.

2500|$|In a {{study by}} the Stirling Media Research Institute about {{violence}} in the media, Phil and Kathy's abusive relationship was analysed. The explanation for Phil's alcoholism, his wife abuse, and the problems he has in relating to his son, was largely accepted as plausible. Women found the depiction of family life and domestic violence realistic and believable and felt that soap operas such as EastEnders should deal with important social issues. They judged soap operas as suitable locations for educating the public about social issues such as domestic violence. Phil's attendance at an AA and subsequent reconciliation with Kathy was viewed, leading some male participants to question the plausibility of the speedy reunion, [...] "One session could hardly make Phil capable of going home and opening up his feelings to [...]" [...] Several focus groups attributed the need for [...] "such a quick dramatic fix" [...] as indicative of the ratings war with rival soap, Coronation Street. Phil's reconciliation with Kathy was also seen as [...] "implausible", though at the same time [...] "it was clearly accepted that according to the conventions of soap opera, there are no permanent solutions." [...] The study reported that much group discussion centred on the Alcoholics Anonymous group scene, which was, for the most part, seen as an accurate depiction of an AA group therapy session. In addition, Phil's portrayal of a suffering alcoholic was also seen as realistic and a [...] "typical portrayal of bottled-up masculinity". Comparatively, male participants were generally dismissive towards Kathy: [...] "She attracted little sympathy or understanding. Her tendency to take some responsibility for her own plight was not countered. Her tale of being abused by men and her history of rapes were at best mentioned in passing, at worst treated disparagingly. There was a quite widely shared sense of how men and women are characterised as radically different in EastEnders and other soap operas..." [...] A scene in which Kathy and her close friend Pat Evans (Pam St Clement) show their competence as electricians, a scene that allowed the characters to [...] "re-examine past mistakes and agree that life is hell, but you've got to keep struggling, mend the electrics ('wait for a man <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> and you'll wait forever') and have a laugh" [...] was felt, especially in middle-class male groups, [...] "to be a superficial kind of feminism in line with how soap operas underscore gender differences." [...] Gay men offered a major exception to this general indifference to Kathy's points of view; they readily espoused them.|$|E
