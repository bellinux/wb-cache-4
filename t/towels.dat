5|$|The {{first use}} of rally <b>towels</b> in {{professional}} sports was the Pittsburgh Steelers football team's Terrible Towel, in 1975. Minnesota Twins first used Homer Hanky <b>towels</b> in 1987. In recent years, other NHL hockey teams have used rally <b>towels</b> at home games, including Anaheim Ducks Fowl <b>Towels.</b>|$|E
5|$|Upon {{the sudden}} {{popularity}} of the Terrible Towel, Pittsburgh-area department stores sold out all gold and black hand <b>towels.</b> Because the hand <b>towels</b> were often sold as a set, with matching bath <b>towels,</b> stores were left with un-even sets. In the fall of 1978, Bernard Pollock, divisional marketing manager of Gimbel's Department Store {{came up with the}} idea of putting a Terrible Towel logo on hand <b>towels</b> and sold the idea to Cope. The first Terrible <b>Towels</b> hit the marketplace on December 20, 1978 at $6 apiece. Gimbel's could not stock them fast enough. Gimbel's has since gone out of business. The original version of The Terrible Towel was manufactured by Fieldcrest and distributed by St. Mary's Inc. of New York and was available in two colors: Gold and Black. The current manufacturer of the Towel is Little Earth Productions, Inc. of Pittsburgh, who took over from McArthur Towel & Sports Co. of Baraboo, Wisconsin in 2013. The current cost of a towel is approximately $12 (in May, 2017, at Steelers' online store).|$|E
5|$|In 1996, Cope {{gave the}} rights to The Terrible Towel to the Allegheny Valley School in Coraopolis, Pennsylvania. The school {{provides}} care for more than 900 people with intellectual and physical disabilities, including Cope's autistic son, Danny. Proceeds from the Terrible Towel have helped raise more than $2.2 million for the school. During the 2005 season, when the Steelers won their fifth Super Bowl, more than 1 million <b>Towels</b> were sold; some fans bought 200 <b>Towels</b> at a time.|$|E

5000|$|A rally <b>towel</b> is {{a sports}} {{paraphernalia}} item and {{a type of}} <b>towel</b> often used as a fan symbol in American sports events. The prototype of the modern rally NFL <b>towel,</b> created in 1975 by former Pittsburgh Steelers radio broadcaster Myron Cope, {{was known as the}} Terrible <b>Towel,</b> although Figo Carvella of New Castle, Pennsylvania originated the <b>towel</b> waving at Steelers games. He took a white dish <b>towel</b> called a [...] "mappena" [...] to the games and began twirling it around. Other fans followed suit and that eventually turned into the Myron Cope version.|$|R

5|$|On February 17, 1988, {{the present}} Ven Sayadaw Buddhanta Panya Vamsa of Htilin Monastery and Pitaka Kyaung {{initiated}} {{the ritual of}} daily face washing of the deity at dawn. This ritual commences every morning at 4 am or 4:30 am when monks wash the face and brush {{the teeth of the}} Buddha image. It is an elaborate ritual performed for over an hour by a senior monk dressed in monastic attire, assisted by several lay helpers, dressed in white and wearing formal headdress. As soon as the drums are struck, the senior monk residing in the adjoining monastery enters the sanctum and starts the formal face washing ritual with a succession of fresh <b>towels,</b> offered by devotees. He then performs the act of cleaning the Mahamuni's teeth with a large brush followed by one more sequence of cleaning with fresh <b>towels.</b> After this, sandalwood paste is applied to the image and it is again cleaned with <b>towels</b> and finally sprinkled with scented water. After the ceremony is completed, the used <b>towels</b> are returned to the devotees who keep these <b>towels</b> with reverence in their home shrines.|$|E
5|$|The term {{greenwashing}} {{was first}} used by environmentalist Jay Westerveld when objecting to hotelier's practice of placing notices in hotel rooms which asked their guests to reuse <b>towels</b> to “save the environment”. Westerveld noted {{that there was little}} else to suggest that the hoteliers were interested in reducing their environmental impacts, and that their interest in washing fewer <b>towels</b> seemed to be motivated by a concern to save costs rather than the environment. Since then greenwashing has become a central feature of debates about marketing communications and sustainability, with “awards” for greenwashing established and numerous campaigns, law and advices developed in an attempt to reduce or curb it.|$|E
5|$|Towel Power is a {{term used}} by the Vancouver Canucks of the National Hockey League (NHL) to {{describe}} the waving of rally <b>towels</b> by their fans. The tradition started in the 1982 Campbell Conference Finals when Vancouver played the Chicago Blackhawks. During game two of the series, head coach Roger Neilson waved a white towel {{on the end of}} a hockey stick in a mock surrender after being upset with the officiating. Neilson was ejected and the Canucks lost 4–1. When Vancouver returned home from Chicago for the following game fans supported both Neilson and the Canucks by waving <b>towels</b> first at the airport when the team arrived and then during the next game. The Canucks won the next three games and advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals where they were defeated by the New York Islanders. As part of the tradition, the Canucks hand out <b>towels</b> prior to playoff games for fans to help support the team.|$|E

They are used to add a decorative touch—usually to a bathroom—most commonly in the USA. They are generally not {{to be used to}} for drying, as regular washing ruins the added trim, and the <b>towel</b> buckles as well (because the <b>towel</b> usually shrinks differently than the trim).|$|R

5|$|Dog racing was {{originally}} {{an extension of}} hare coursing. Whippets began to be bred to race in the mid-nineteenth century. The first form of the sport was a rudimentary form of coursing known as 'ragging', and dogs who participated {{were said to be}} 'trained to the rag'. Dogs were kept on a leash by a person known as a slip, who was frequently also the race judge. The slip would release the dogs from their collars at the same time, and they would race towards their owners, who were standing {{at the opposite end of}} the track waving <b>towels.</b>|$|E

40|$|The <b>towel</b> test {{consists}} of covering an infant’s {{face with a}} <b>towel</b> and seeing if he/she can remove it with either arm.
