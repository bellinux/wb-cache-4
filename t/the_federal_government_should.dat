5|$|In {{the early}} days of the convention, Mason {{supported}} much of the Virginia Plan, which was introduced by Randolph on May 29. This plan would have a popularly elected lower house which would choose the members of the upper house from lists provided by the states. Most of the delegates had found the weak government under the Articles insufficient, and Randolph proposed that the new federal government should be supreme over the states. Mason agreed that <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>should</b> be more powerful than the states.|$|E
5|$|Hal {{is riding}} {{the school bus}} home one day when he is {{approached}} by Ginny Ryerson, the articulate, competitive star of the debate team. She urges him to join her and replace her former partner, Ben Wekselbaum, who has {{dropped out of high}} school after falling silent mid-speech and losing the New Jersey State High School Policy Debate Championship. Though Hal initially declines, he finds himself besotted with Ginny and agrees to be her partner. Hal and Ginny begin to study for the upcoming tournament and form arguments on either side of whether <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>should</b> support the teaching of sexual abstinence in public schools. When Hal finds himself unable to talk during a practice debate, he runs out of the room and hides in the janitorial closet, where Ginny joins him. Hal kisses her hopefully, and they make out, but she subsequently falls out of contact with him. Ginny's parents assure him that she is confident with the work they have already completed and that she will meet him on the day of the debate.|$|E

25|$|Bloomberg {{believes}} that the September 11, 2001 attacks were {{not intended to be}} solitary events. When he assumed office, he set up a Counterterrorism Bureau which works along with the NYPD intelligence division to gather information about terrorism affecting New York City worldwide. He {{believes that}} funding for Homeland Security by <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>should</b> be distributed by risk, where cities that are considered to have the highest threat for a terrorist attack would get the most money. Bloomberg is also a supporter of the USA PATRIOT Act.|$|E
25|$|A {{national}} {{poll by the}} Angus Reid organization {{released on}} November 25, 2014 revealed that Canadians in general were also split as well on whether the attack and shooting {{was an act of}} terrorism or mental illness. 38% felt that it was the result of mental illness, while 36% felt it was terrorism, with 25% undecided. Asked about what <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>should</b> do as a result, 54% felt that more initiatives should be done to prevent radicalization, while 34% favoured harsher punishments. On how to deal with homegrown terrorists, 54% felt that indefinite incarceration only motivated persons to commit crimes, while 46% felt it prevented violent crime.|$|E

25|$|One {{unforeseen}} {{result of}} the launch of Sputnik by the Soviet Union was the immediate emphasis on education for bright students in the United States, and this settled the question whether <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>should</b> get involved in public education at all. The National Defense Education Act (NDEA) was passed by Congress in 1958 with $1 billion US to bolster science, math, and technology in public education. Educators immediately pushed to identify gifted students and serve them in schools. Students chosen for gifted services were given intelligence tests with a strict cutoff, usually at 130, which meant that students who scored below the 130 were not identified.|$|E
25|$|Early toll {{roads were}} {{constructed}} and owned by joint-stock companies that sold stock to raise construction capital like Pennsylvania's 1795 Lancaster Turnpike Company. In 1808, Secretary of the Treasury Albert Gallatin's Report on the Subject of Public Roads and Canals suggested that <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>should</b> fund {{the construction of}} interstate turnpikes and canals. While many Anti-Federalists opposed the federal government assuming such a role, the British blockade in the War of 1812 demonstrated the United States' reliance upon these overland roads for military operations {{as well as for}} general commerce. Construction on the National Road began in 1815 in Cumberland, Maryland and reached Wheeling, Virginia in 1818, but political strife thereafter ultimately prevented its western advance to the Mississippi River. Nevertheless, the road became a primary overland conduit through Appalachian Mountains and was the gateway for thousands of antebellum westward-bound settlers.|$|E
25|$|In April 1874, Robert E. and Mary Lee's eldest son, George Washington Custis Lee, petitioned Congress {{for payment}} for the Arlington estate. Lee argued that tax sale of the entire {{property}} (rather than just that portion needed to pay the tax debt) amounted to confiscation and was unconstitutional. He also argued that the tax collectors' refusal to accept payment made the proceedings null and void. Finally, he asserted that <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>should</b> {{only be able to}} secure a life interest in the property (in other words, seize it only as long as Mary Lee lived) and could not assert title to the estate without the consent of the state of Virginia. He offered not to litigate the seizure of Arlington if paid. Lee's petition was referred to the United States House Committee on the Judiciary on April 6, but it was not acted on.|$|E

25|$|Even a brief perusal of the Atomic Energy Act reveals that, {{despite its}} comprehensiveness, {{it does not}} at any point {{expressly}} require the States to construct or authorize nuclear powerplants or prohibit the States from deciding, as an absolute or conditional matter, not to permit the construction of any further reactors. Instead, petitioners argue that the Act is intended to preserve the Federal Government as the sole regulator of all matters nuclear, and that 25524.2 falls {{within the scope of}} this impliedly pre-empted field. But as we view the issue, Congress, in passing the 1954 Act and in subsequently amending it, intended that <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Government</b> <b>should</b> regulate the radiological safety aspects involved in the construction and operation of a nuclear plant, but that the States retain their traditional responsibility in the field of regulating electrical utilities for determining questions of need, reliability, cost, and other related state concerns.|$|E

500|$|The protester {{argument}} {{appears to}} be that <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>should</b> {{not be able to}} tax income from labor because it would be a tax on an exercise of the freedoms mentioned in the quotation. The [...] "tax" [...] in this case was, in effect, a license fee imposed on door to door sales people under a city ordinance. The city was trying to exact the fee from Jehovah’s Witness members who were going door to door. Questions about the validity of federal income taxes were neither presented to nor decided by the Court.|$|E

500|$|In {{his first}} Senate speech in 1855, Wilson {{continued}} to align {{himself with the}} abolitionists, who wanted to immediately end slavery in the United States and its territories. In his speech, Wilson {{said he wanted to}} abolish slavery [...] "wherever we are morally and legally responsible for its existence" [...] including Washington D.C. Wilson also demanded repeal of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, believing <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>should</b> have no responsibility for enforcing slavery, and that once the act was repealed tensions between slavery proponents and opponents would abate, enabling those Southerners who opposed slavery to help end it in their own time.|$|E
500|$|With Grant, a Republican, elected {{president}} in 1868, and the 41st Congress as Republican-dominated as its immediate predecessors, Randall faced several more {{years in the}} minority. He served on the Banking and Currency Committee and {{began to focus on}} financial matters, resuming his long-standing policy against the power of banks. This placed Randall in the growing fight over the nature of the nation's currency—those who favored the gold-backed currency were called [...] "hard money" [...] supporters, while the policy of encouraging inflation through coining silver or issuing dollars backed by government bonds ("greenbacks") was known as [...] "soft money". Although he believed in a gold-backed dollar, Randall was friendly to greenbacks; in general, he favored allowing the amount of currency to remain constant, while replacing bank-issued dollar bills with greenbacks. He also believed <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>should</b> sell its bonds directly to the public, rather than selling them only to large banks, which then re-sold them at a profit. He was unsuccessful in convincing the Republican majority to adopt any of these measures.|$|E
