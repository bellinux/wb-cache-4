Ringworm infections caused by A.fulvescens in animals have been successfully treated with anti-fungal drugs such as Tinactin, which contains <b>tolnaftate</b> as its active ingredient, and Grisactin, which contains griseofulvin as its active ingredient. However, topical treatment of human A.fulvescens infections with tolnaftate-containing drugs has been shown to worsen the lesions, causing further inflammation and increased sensitivity. Treatment with griseofulvin has proven somewhat effective in reducing lesion sizes and appears to have a dose-dependent effect. It should be noted however that while lesions continue to heal after increased griseofulvin administration, there is some residual scarring of the infected area. Currently, there is no documentation providing evidence of an anti-fungal treatment that is completely effective against human dermatophytosis caused by A.fulvescens.|$|E

50|$|The {{treatment}} of M. gallinae involves both topical and oral antifungals. Topical antifungals, such as: Terbinafine, <b>Tolnaftate,</b> and orally administered Griseofulvin {{have been used}} successfully to treat M. gallinae infections in humans and animals.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tolnaftate</b> {{has been}} found to be {{generally}} slightly less effective than azoles when used to treat tinea pedis (athlete's foot). It is, however, useful when dealing with ringworm, especially when passed from pets to humans.|$|E
50|$|Tinea pedis {{is usually}} treated with topical medicines, like {{ketoconazole}} or terbinafine, and pills, or with medicines that contains miconazole, clotrimazole, or <b>tolnaftate.</b> Antibiotics {{may be necessary}} to treat secondary bacterial infections that occur in addition to the fungus (for example, from scratching).|$|E
50|$|Antifungal {{treatments}} include topical agents such as miconazole, terbinafine, clotrimazole, ketoconazole, or <b>tolnaftate</b> applied {{twice daily}} until symptoms resolve — usually within {{one or two}} weeks. Topical treatments should then be continued for a further 7 days after resolution of visible symptoms to prevent recurrence. The total duration of treatment is therefore generally two weeks, but may be as long as three.|$|E
5000|$|Tinea unguium {{presents}} {{a much greater}} therapeutic challenge as topical creams do not penetrate the nail bed. Historically, systemic griseofulvin treatment showed improvements in some patients with tinea unguium; however, failure was common even in lengthy treatment courses (e.g., > 1 yr). Current treatment modalities include oral terbinafine, oral itraconazole, and intermittent [...] "pulse therapy" [...] with oral itraconazole Fingernail infections can be treated in 6-8 weeks while toenail infections may take up to 12 weeks to achieve cure. Topical treatment by occlusive dressing combining 20% urea paste with 2% <b>tolnaftate</b> have also shown promise in softening the nail plate to promote penetration of the antifungal agent to the nail bed.|$|E
50|$|Treatment {{depends on}} the locus and {{severity}} of infection. For tinea pedis, many antifungal creams such as miconazole nitrate, clotrimazole, <b>tolnaftate</b> (a synthetic thiocarbamate), terbinafine hydrochloride, butenafine hydrochloride and undecylenic acid are effective. For more severe or complicated infections, oral ketoconazole was historically shown {{to be an effective}} treatment for T. rubrum infections but is no longer used for this indication due to the risk of liver damage as a side effect. Oral terbinafine, itraconazole or fluconazole have all been shown to be safer, effective treatments. Terbinafine and naftifine (topical creams) have been successfully treated tinea cruris and tinea corporis caused by T. rubrum. Trichophyton rubrum infections {{have been found to be}} susceptible to photodynamic treatment, laser irradiation, and photoactivation of rose bengal dye by green laser light.|$|E

50|$|There {{are many}} topical {{antifungal}} drugs {{useful in the}} treatment of athlete's foot including: miconazole nitrate, clotrimazole, <b>tolnaftate</b> (a synthetic thiocarbamate), terbinafine hydrochloride, butenafine hydrochloride and undecylenic acid. The fungal infection may be treated with topical antifungal agents, which can {{take the form of a}} spray, powder, cream, or gel. Topical application of an antifungal cream such as terbinafine once daily for one week or butenafine once daily for two weeks is effective in most cases of athlete's foot and is more effective than application of miconazole or clotrimazole. Plantar-type athlete's foot is more resistant to topical treatments due to the presence of thickened hyperkeratotic skin on the sole of the foot. Keratolytic and humectant medications such as urea, salicyclic acid (Whitfield's ointment), and lactic acid are useful adjunct medications and improve penetration of antifungal agents into the thickened skin. Topical glucocorticoids are sometimes prescribed to alleviate inflammation and itching associated with the infection.|$|E
40|$|<b>Tolnaftate</b> [2 -napthyl-N-methyl-N-(m-tolyl) thionocarbamate], an {{antifungal}} drug, {{is widely}} used to control superficial fungal infections in humans and other animals. In this study the effect of <b>tolnaftate</b> on aflatoxin biosynthesis by Aspergillus parasiticus NRRL 3240 was investigated. <b>Tolnaftate</b> changed the morphology of A. parasiticus to yeastlike forms and inhibited aflatoxin formation. The formation of aflatoxin G was blocked considerably, indicating a metabolic block in the conversion of aflatoxin B to aflatoxin G. The incorporation of [1 - 14 C]acetate into aflatoxin was significantly inhibited at a concentration of 1 mM <b>tolnaftate.</b> The presence of zinc in the resuspension buffer resulted in reversal of the tolnaftate-induced inhibition of aflatoxin G 1 biosynthesis...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of action of a new benzylamine antimycotic, butenafine hydrochloride, was studied in Candida albicans by using the thiocarbamate antimycotic <b>tolnaftate</b> as a reference drug. Butenafine completely inhibited {{the growth of a}} test strain of C. albicans at 25 micrograms/ml and was cidal at 50 micrograms/ml. <b>Tolnaftate</b> did not show any growth-inhibitory activity up to 100 micrograms/ml. Both butenafine and <b>tolnaftate</b> inhibited squalene epoxidation in C. albicans, with 50 % inhibitory concentrations being 0. 57 and 0. 17 microgram/ml, respectively. Butenafine, but not <b>tolnaftate,</b> induced the release of appreciable amounts of Pi from C. albicans cells at 12. 5 micrograms/ml. This effect of butenafine was augmented when the cells were pretreated with <b>tolnaftate.</b> The results suggest that the direct membrane-damaging effect of butenafine may {{play a major role in}} its anticandidal activity and that the drug-induced alteration in the cellular sterol composition renders the cell membrane more susceptible to the membrane-damaging effect of this drug...|$|E
30|$|ANOVA {{revealed}} that <b>tolnaftate</b> amount penetrating into 1  cm 2 of epidermis from the solution containing oleic acid was significantly greater (P< 0.05) {{than from the}} control solution. Linoleic, lauric and capric acids did not significantly enhance <b>tolnaftate</b> penetration into epidermis comparing to the control.|$|E
30|$|The donor {{solutions}} for in vitro skin penetration experiments were prepared by dissolving <b>tolnaftate</b> (1 %, w/w) in PEG 400 and following addition of oleic, linoleic, lauric or capric acid to comprise 10 % (w/w) of total amount. If necessary, slight heating (up to 50 °C) was employed. <b>Tolnaftate</b> 1 % (w/w) solution in PEG 400 {{was used as}} control.|$|E
40|$|<b>Tolnaftate,</b> an {{antifungal}} agent, has poor solubility and scarce permeability. The {{main objective}} {{of the study was}} to formulate and evaluate emulgel of <b>Tolnaftate</b> for improved topical drug delivery. Emulgel was formulated by preparing <b>Tolnaftate</b> emulsion and incorporated into Carbopol- 940 gel base with two different penetration enhancers i. e Eucalyptus oil (EO) and Transcutol at concentration of 1 %, 3 % and 5 % w/w separately. The formulations were evaluated for physic-chemical properties, in vitro drug release, ex vivo diffusion studies and antifungal activity against Candida albicans. The satisfactory physicochemical parameters were exhibited by optimised emulgel formulation containing 5 % EO (Batch-F 7). Further, it showed 88. 09 % ± 0. 24 in vitro drug release and 74. 87 % ± 0. 73 ex vivo diffusion at the end of 8 hours which were considerably higher than emulgel without penetration enhancer. When assessed for antifungal activity, the zone of inhibition of Batch-F 7 was significantly improved as compared to pure drug, emulgel without EO. This may be attributed to increased penetration of emulgel in fungi cells in presence of EO which translated into efficient antifungal activity. Therefore, it can be concluded that <b>Tolnaftate</b> emulgel was successfully prepared with simple and commercially feasible manufacturing process and can serve as potential topical delivery of <b>Tolnaftate...</b>|$|E
40|$|Piritetrate (M- 732), a new topical {{antifungal}} agent belonging chemically to the thiocarbamates, was demonstrated {{to possess a}} potent selective antidermatophytic activity. In terms of its MICs in susceptibility testing, mainly done by using Sabouraud dextrose agar plates, piritetrate exhibited several- to 10 -fold-stronger antidermatophytic activity than <b>tolnaftate,</b> a reference thiocarbamate. Furthermore, piritetrate was found to show a broader antifungal spectrum than tolnaftate; relatively many species and strains of dematiaceous fungi, dimorphic fungi, and some other filamentous fungi {{as well as a}} few strains of Cryptococcus neoformans were fairly susceptible to piritetrate, while almost all the tested species and strains were resistant to <b>tolnaftate.</b> All the tested species of the genus Candida were, however, resistant to both compounds. Variables which can influence antimicrobial activity caused few changes in the MICs of either compound against Trichophyton mentagrophytes; however, an increase in the inoculum size resulted in {{a significant increase in the}} MICs. The antidermatophytic activities of piritetrate and <b>tolnaftate</b> were fungistatic but not fungicidal. Piritetrate also exhibited a more potent in vitro anti-T. mentagrophytes activity than clotrimazole or tolciclate. Piritetrate and <b>tolnaftate</b> had no antibacterial activity. The in vivo activity of topically administered piritetrate against experimental dermal infection of guinea pigs with T. mentagrophytes was more effective than that of <b>tolnaftate</b> both mycologically and clinically. Piritetrate manifested no acute toxicity in laboratory animals when administered even in large quantities by the oral, intraperitoneal, and topical routes...|$|E
30|$|<b>Tolnaftate</b> was not {{penetrating}} into hydrophilic dermis (only traces below {{limit of}} quantitation were found) and no drug was detected in the acceptor fluid.|$|E
30|$|Separation of <b>tolnaftate</b> from {{endogenous}} compounds of skin matrix {{was accomplished}} on a LiChrospher® 100 RP- 18 Endcapped column, 125 × 4  mm, i.d., packed with 5  μm size particles (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) and maintained at 40 °C. A LiChrospher 100 RP- 18 e (5  μm) (LiChroCART 4 – 4) {{was used as}} a guard column. The flow rate of the mobile phase (70 % methanol and 30 % bi-distilled water) was 0.8  mL/min and the injection volume was 10 μL. <b>Tolnaftate</b> detection was set at λ = 257  nm.|$|E
30|$|Fatty acids {{classified}} as chemical penetration enhancers (CPEs) might cause the fluidization and perturbation of stratum corneum (SC) lipid matrix. The penetration of oleic, linoleic, lauric and capric acids into human skin was studied by time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) imaging {{and related to}} fatty acids enhancing effect on lipophilic model drug <b>tolnaftate</b> penetration into human epidermis and dermis ex vivo. Fatty acid enhancing effect on <b>tolnaftate</b> penetration into human skin was evaluated using Bronaugh-type flow-through diffusion cells. After in vitro penetration studies visualization and spatial localization of fatty acid molecules in human skin were performed using TOF-SIMS. Penetration of oleic, linoleic, lauric and capric acids into human skin was compared to the control skin sections by ion images and intensity profiles. Only oleic acid significantly (P< 0.05) enhanced <b>tolnaftate</b> penetration into epidermis (enhancing ratio equal to 1.867). CPE might {{have no effect on}} model drug penetration enhancement, but might penetrate itself into the skin.|$|E
30|$|As {{enhancing}} {{effect of}} fatty acids was investigated, a lipophilic model drug with appopriate physicochemical properties ensuring its penetration via lipoidal route {{had to be}} chosen. A thiocarbamate antifungal drug <b>tolnaftate</b> was selected as a model compound for in vitro skin penetration experiments. High hydrophobicity (XLogP = 5.5), low molecular weight (307.4  Da) and melting point of 109 - 112 °C (Eur. Pharm. 6.0; 01 / 2008 : 1158) are physicochemical properties which ensure tolnaftate’s capability of passive diffusion through SC via lipoidal intercellular route and accumulation in superficial layers of skin. Hydrophilic skin layers form a barrier to <b>tolnaftate</b> deeper penetration.|$|E
30|$|Oleic and {{linoleic}} acids {{are both}} unsaturated, having {{one and two}} double bonds, respectively. Central location of double bond conditions {{the formation of a}} ‘kink’ [50], and this is attributed to the most potential CPE – oleic acid. Oleic acid is considered to create fluid-like phase within intercellular space [54 – 57]. In our studies, oleic acid significantly enhanced <b>tolnaftate</b> penetration into epidermis (ER= 1.867) and its penetration into human skin was confirmed by TOF-SIMS analysis. Linoleic acid did not have a significant enhancing effect on <b>tolnaftate</b> penetration, while its penetration was confirmed by TOF-SIMS imaging.|$|E
40|$|The thiocarbamate antimycotics <b>tolnaftate</b> and {{tolciclate}} blocked sterol biosynthesis in fungal {{cells and}} cell extracts, with accumulation of squalene.

In whole Candida cells, ergosterol biosynthesis inhibition was not complete at drug concentrations up to 100 mg/liter, whereas full inhibition occurred in a cell-free test system. Rat liver cell-free cholesterol biosynthesis was much less sensitive to the drugs. The biochemical action of <b>tolnaftate</b> and tolciclate is thus {{similar to that of}} the allylamine antimycotics naftifine and terbinafine...|$|E

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of a topical formulation containing 2 % micronized griseofulvin applied 3 times daily for 3 weeks was evaluated {{in patients with}} superficial dermatophytoses. A double-blind parallel {{study was designed to}} compare the formulation to a standard therapy (<b>tolnaftate</b> 1 % cream) and a placebo ointment. One of the 3 preparations was assigned at random to a total of 52 subjects. Thirteen of 15 subjects treated with placebo ointment were judged to be treatment failures. Nine of 18 subjects treated with griseofulvin, and 9 of 19 subjects treated with <b>tolnaftate,</b> responded to treatment. Clinical response appeared {{to be related to the}} severity of the infection rather than to the anatomical location of the lesions. The results suggest that griseofulvin may be effective following topical application and demonstrate the usefulness of positive and negative controls when evaluating topical antifungal agents...|$|E
30|$|The {{diffusion}} cell method is a reliable method for measuring drug transport into/across the skin.

40|$|Haloprogin {{was shown}} to be a highly {{effective}} agent for the treatment of experimentally induced topical mycotic infections in guinea pigs. Its in vitro spectrum of activity also includes yeasts, yeastlike fungi (Candida species), and certain gram-positive bacteria. The in vitro and in vivo antifungal activity of haloprogin against dermatophytes was equal to that observed with <b>tolnaftate.</b> The striking differences between the two agents were the marked antimonilial and selective antibacterial activities shown by haloprogin, contrasted with the negligible activities found with <b>tolnaftate.</b> Addition of serum decreased the in vitro antifungal activity of haloprogin {{to a greater extent than}} that of tolnaftate; however, diminished antifungal activity was not observed when haloprogin was applied topically to experimental dermatophytic infections.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between sterol biosynthesis inhibition, membrane integrity, and cell growth inhibition in Candida albicans was examined for five squalene epoxidase inhibitors. The compounds were the thiocarbamates <b>tolnaftate</b> and tolciclate and the allylamines naftifine, terbinafine, and SDZ 87 - 469. All compounds inhibited sterol biosynthesis, with the concentrations {{that caused a}} 50 % decrease in the total sterol-to-squalene ratio ranging from {{less than or equal}} to 0. 01 microM for terbinafine and SDZ 87 - 469 to 500 microM for <b>tolnaftate.</b> At 100 microM, the compounds also caused up to a 30 % release of intracellular [14 C]aminoisobutyric acid. With terbinafine and SD 2 87 - 469, aminoisobutyric acid release further increased in cells grown at concentrations that inhibited ergosterol biosynthesis. It is suggested that inhibition of ergosterol synthesis may render the C. albicans membrane susceptible to further damage, including direct damage from squalene epoxidase inhibitors...|$|E
40|$|In Botrytis cinerea, multidrug {{resistant}} (MDR) strains {{collected in}} French and German vineyards {{were tested in}} vitro, at the germ-tube elongation stage, towards {{a wide range of}} fungicides. Whatever the MDR phenotype, resistance was recorded to anilinopyrimidines, diethofencarb, iprodione, fludioxonil, <b>tolnaftate</b> and several respiratory inhibitors (e. g., penthiopyrad, pyraclostrobin). In MDR 1 strains, overproducing the ABC transporter BcatrB, resistance extended to carbendazim and the uncouplers fluazinam and malonoben. In MDR 2 strains, overproducing the MFS transporter BcmfsM 2, resistance extended to cycloheximide, fenhexamid and sterol 14 alpha-demethylation inhibitors (DMIs). MDR 3 strains combined the overexpression of both transporters and exhibited the widest spectrum of cross resistance and the highest resistance levels. The four transport modulators, amitriptyline, chlorpromazine, diethylstilbestrol, and verapamil, known to affect some ABC transporters, were tested in B. cinerea. In our experimental conditions, the activity of several fungicides was only enhanced by verapamil. Interestingly, synergism was only recorded in MDR 2 and/or MDR 3 isolates treated with <b>tolnaftate,</b> fenhexamid, fludioxonil or pyrimethanil, suggesting that verapamil may inhibit the MFS transporter BcmfsM 2.
