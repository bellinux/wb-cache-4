25|$|At the {{beginning}} of 2007, The Vachons {{were back in the}} US. At a February 17 show for Grapple Masters Wrestling in Bristol, Vermont, The Vachons were supposed to appear for the show's opening promo. When the team was introduced, however, their rivals The Hellraisers come out instead. The Hellraisers began picking on a fan in the crowd, Albert, but then invited him to join them in the ring. They continued talking to Albert until <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>said</b> he was a fan of The Vachons causing The Hellraisers to attack him. The Vachons then ran to the ring to chase off The Hellraisers setting up two singles matches between the four wrestlers later that night. The match series ended in a tie with Hellraiser Misery defeating Damien Vachon in a Tables match and Pierre Vachon winning a Thumbtacks match against Hellraiser Pain. Both teams were scheduled to meet in a Dog Collar match for the GMW Tag Team Championship on March 10.|$|E

60|$|<b>The</b> <b>Young</b> <b>Man</b> <b>said,</b> of course, she couldn't. It {{was utterly}} {{out of the}} question.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I'll be dummed if I'll {{take two}} dollars out o' my hide," [...] one of <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> <b>men</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "I'm goin' to a hotel, ef I don't never lay up a cent." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And I suppose," [...] one of <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "that this Admirable Crichton of {{whom you}} are in search must be sober, honest, and truthful. Are you {{particular}} whether he is Huguenot or Catholic?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are better}} off than Pisani was, anyhow," [...] one of <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "for you are not {{hampered}} with proveditors, and anything that your captaincy may suggest will, you may be sure, receive our assent." ...|$|R
6000|$|... --Seymour's back in town, <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>said,</b> {{grasping}} again his spur of rock. Chucked {{medicine and}} going {{in for the}} army.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well, I think," [...] <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "You're {{the most}} immoral person I've lately had the {{privilege}} of conversing with." ...|$|E
60|$|It almost seemed, when <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>said</b> these words, as if {{he threw}} a defiant look towards the quiet strangers in the corner.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think that}} it is mental rather than bodily collapse," [...] <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> <b>man</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "A sudden failure of brain power. He was {{absolutely}} unable to make any effort to walk, or indeed to move his limbs at all. It was a sort of mental paralysis." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “If your judgement’s {{against this}} lady I promise never {{to look at}} her again. I mean the one in the third box from the passage, in white, with the red flowers,” <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> <b>man</b> <b>said</b> as Littlemore slowly rose and stood beside him. “The fellow with her is leaning forward. It’s he who makes me doubt. Will you have the glass?” ...|$|R
60|$|Selingman {{glared at}} <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> but <b>said</b> nothing. <b>The</b> others, too, were all remarkably bereft of words.|$|R
6000|$|... "I scarce {{thought you}} would try, Hetty," [...] <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>said.</b> You see, I'm not used {{to this kind of}} welcome in this house." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>said</b> that {{he should}} be very happy to serve them if they should require his services, and then bowed and went away.|$|E
6000|$|... "This is {{all very}} new and {{wonderful}} to me," [...] <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>said</b> in explanation; [...] "but I suppose it's quite commonplace to you--and Bill." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> <b>said</b> it was <b>the</b> funniest {{song that}} had ever been written, and that, if we liked, they would get Herr Slossenn Boschen, whom they knew very well, to sing it. They said it was so funny that, when Herr Slossenn Boschen had sung it once before the German Emperor, he (the German Emperor) had had to be carried off to bed.|$|R
6000|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> <b>said,</b> 'It isn't much of {{the riches}} {{of the world has}} stopped with yourself, old man,' and he looked at the old man's bare feet, and they all laughed. But Hanrahan did not laugh, but he sat down very quietly, without a word. Then one of them said, 'So you will stop with us after all, Hanrahan'; and the old man said: 'He will stop indeed, did you not hear me asking him?' ...|$|R
6000|$|And He {{followed}} {{swiftly and}} touched the hand of <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> and <b>said</b> to him, 'Why {{do you look at}} this woman and in such wise?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mademoiselle," [...] <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>said,</b> {{with an air}} of {{somewhat}} weary politeness, [...] "I {{regret to}} say that there is nothing more to be done!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have just}} come from Cape Town," [...] <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "Such a shock it was to me--about my poor brother! Oh! such a shock!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Sewell," [...] <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>said</b> abruptly, [...] "you {{told me once}} you-- {{that you}} {{sometimes}} had money put into your hands that you could lend." ...|$|E
6000|$|When the sun rose, the head-man {{came and}} looked for the dates, {{and there were no}} dates. And he woke <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man,</b> and <b>said</b> to him, 'Look at the tree.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I must do something," [...] <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> <b>man</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "for I {{have been}} kicking my heels about London since my ship was paid off two years ago. At first, of course, it didn't matter, for I {{have enough to}} live upon; but {{recently}} I have been fool enough {{to fall in love}} with a girl whose parents would never dream of allowing her to marry a half-pay lieutenant of the navy with no chance in the world of getting employed again, for I have no interest whatever." ...|$|R
6000|$|After that <b>the</b> three <b>young</b> <b>men</b> <b>said</b> to one another, [...] "We {{must now}} seek {{happiness}} elsewhere. And what better {{can we do}} than obey the words of Indra, the God of Air, who spake thus ?-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good Heavens!" [...] <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "this is dreadful; {{they had}} a {{thousand}} times better have been shot with their friends. What's to be done, sergeant?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is too {{bad that}} you should have to submit to any one's whims and tempers," [...] <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>said,</b> {{switching}} his stick angrily backwards and forwards.|$|E
6000|$|... "I feel {{absolutely}} well again, {{thank you}} very much," [...] <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "I will smoke a cigarette, if I may. The brandy, I thank you, no!" ...|$|E
60|$|Clyffurde was half-way {{down the}} stone steps when these words of de Marmont struck upon his ear. Instinctively he retraced his steps. There was a {{suggestion}} of impending danger to Crystal in what <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> had <b>said.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Binkley was the gay boy of the boarding-house. He was forty-nine, {{and owned}} a fishstall in a {{downtown}} market. But after six o'clock he wore an evening suit and whooped things up connected with the beaux arts. <b>The</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> <b>said</b> he was an [...] "Indian." [...] He {{was supposed to be}} an accomplished habitué of the inner circles of Bohemia. It was no secret that he had once loaned $10 to a <b>young</b> <b>man</b> who had had a drawing printed in Puck. Often has one thus obtained his entrée into the charmed circle, while the other obtained both his entrée and roast.|$|R
6000|$|He {{nodded and}} moved away with a light laugh. Bill turned a stony face to the Expressman. Suddenly a gleam of mirth came into his gloomy eyes. He bent over <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man,</b> and <b>said</b> in a hoarse, chuckling whisper:-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think it's {{more than}} fair; {{it is most}} kind," [...] <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "You are risking getting nothing for your labour {{if it turns out}} poor." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{just what}} I should like," [...] <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>said</b> enthusiastically; [...] "though I don't know how I should set to work if I did find a mine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This is Mr. Coulson, I believe?" [...] <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>said</b> with conviction, {{addressing}} a somewhat stout, gray-headed American, with white moustache, a Homburg hat, and clothes of distinctly transatlantic cut.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{would be}} a good thing to have a few with us, though," [...] one of <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "My place is only six miles off. I will ride over and bring back three with me; they are all good ones, and I should be sorry to find they were gone when I get back. I can lead one, my black boy can ride another and lead the third. It is likely enough some of the horses may give out, or get speared if the blacks make a fight of it, and half a dozen spare horses would come in very handy." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> <b>said</b> {{that her}} brow was the {{habitation}} of the lily, her eye {{the mirror of}} the heavens, her cheek the dwelling-place of the rose. True, in the ardour of their feelings and strength of their imaginations they used strong language; nevertheless {{it was impossible to}} overpraise the Norse maiden. Her nut-brown hair fell in luxuriant masses over her shapely shoulders, reaching far below the waist; her skin was fair, and her manners engaging. Hilda was undoubtedly blue-eyed and beautiful. She was just seventeen at this time. Those who loved her (and there were few who did not) styled her the sunbeam.|$|R
6000|$|... "My elder brother, Hugh," [...] {{returned}} <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man.</b> He <b>said</b> it in {{an altered}} and lower voice, and glanced at his mother, who raised her hands hurriedly, and put them together across her black gown, and looked eagerly at the visitor.|$|R
