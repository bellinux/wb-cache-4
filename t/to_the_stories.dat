5|$|After {{the demise}} of Thrilling Wonder Stories the old Wonder Stories title was revived for two issues, {{published}} in 1957 and 1963. These were both edited by Jim Hendryx Jr. They were numbered vol. 45, no. 1 and 2, continuing the volume numbering of Thrilling Wonder. Both were selections from past issues of Thrilling Wonder; the second one convinced Ned Pines, the publisher who had bought Wonder Stories from Gernsback in 1936 and who still owned the rights <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stories,</b> to start a reprint magazine called Treasury of Great Science Fiction Stories in 1964; a companion, Treasury of Great Western Stories, was added the next year.|$|E
5|$|After the {{publication}} of Casino Royale, Fleming used his annual holiday at his house in Jamaica to write another Bond story. Twelve Bond novels and two short-story collections were published between 1953 and 1966, the last two (The Man with the Golden Gun and Octopussy and The Living Daylights) posthumously. Much of the background <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> came from Fleming's previous work in the Naval Intelligence Division or from events he knew of from the Cold War. The plot of From Russia, with Love uses a fictional Soviet Spektor decoding machine as a lure to trap Bond; the Spektor had {{its roots in the}} wartime German Enigma machine. The novel's plot device of spies on the Orient Express was based on the story of Eugene Karp, a US naval attaché and intelligence agent based in Budapest who took the Orient Express from Budapest to Paris in February 1950, carrying papers about blown US spy networks in the Eastern Bloc. Soviet assassins already on the train drugged the conductor, and Karp's body was found shortly afterwards in a railway tunnel south of Salzburg.|$|E
5|$|Some reviewers {{compared}} Philosopher's Stone <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> of Roald Dahl, {{who died}} in 1990. Many writers since the 1970s had been hailed as his successor, but none had attained anything near his popularity with children and, in a poll conducted shortly after the launch of Philosopher's Stone, seven of the ten most popular children's books were by Dahl, including the one in top place. The only other really popular children's author of the late 1990s was an American, R. L. Stine. Some of the story elements in Philosopher's Stone resembled parts of Dahl's stories; for example, the hero of James and the Giant Peach lost his parents and {{had to live with}} a pair of unpleasant auntsone fat and one thin rather like Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, who treated Harry as a servant. However Harry Potter was a distinctive creation, able to take on the responsibilities of an adult while remaining a child inside.|$|E

25|$|Over the years, Wilhelm worked {{extensively}} on the prose, expanded and added detail <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> {{to the point that}} many grew to be twice the length of those in the earliest published editions. In the later editions, Wilhelm polished the language to make it more enticing to a bourgeois audience, eliminated sexual elements, and added Christian elements. After 1819, he began writing for children (children were not initially considered the primary audience), adding entirely new tales or adding new elements to existing tales, elements that were often strongly didactic.|$|E
25|$|Fraser Island {{has been}} {{inhabited}} by humans {{for as much}} as 5,000 years. Explorer James Cook sailed by the island in May 1770. Matthew Flinders landed near the most northern point of the island in 1802. For a short period the island was known as Great Sandy Island. The island became known as Fraser due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> of a shipwreck survivor named Eliza Fraser. Today the island is a popular tourism destination. Its resident human population was 194 at the 2011 Australian Census.|$|E
25|$|Ellen Austin {{supposedly}} {{came across}} a derelict ship, placed on board a prize crew, and attempted to sail with it to New York in 1881. According <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stories,</b> the derelict disappeared; others elaborating further that the derelict reappeared minus the prize crew, then disappeared again with a second prize crew on board. A check from Lloyd's of London records proved the existence of Meta, built in 1854, and that in 1880, Meta was renamed Ellen Austin. There are no casualty listings for this vessel, or any vessel at that time, that would suggest {{a large number of}} missing men were placed on board a derelict that later disappeared.|$|E

25|$|According {{to its own}} history, Shintō Musō-ryū {{was founded}} in the Keichō era (1594–1614) by Musō Gonnosuke, a samurai with {{considerable}} martial arts experience. A wandering warrior (Rōnin), Gonnosuke would eventually cross paths with the famous swordsman Miyamoto Musashi. The two men fought a duel in which Musashi defeated Gonnosuke with relative ease. Gonnosuke, a proud warrior who according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> had never been defeated, was deeply shocked by his defeat and retired to a cave for meditation and reflectation. This period of isolation led him to create a set of techniques for the jō, with a goal of defeating Musashi's two-sword style. These jo techniques constituted the core of Gonnosuke's new school (ryu), which he named Shintō Musō-ryū.|$|E
25|$|Sossianus Hierocles {{argued in}} the 3rdcentury that the doctrines {{and the life}} of Apollonius were more {{valuable}} than those of Jesus', a viewpoint reportedly held by both Voltaire and Charles Blount during the Age of Enlightenment. In his 1909 book The Christ, John Remsburg postulated that the religion of Apollonius disappeared because the proper conditions for its development did not exist. Buddhism, Christianity, and Islam thrived however, because the existing conditions were favorable. In his 1949 book The Hero with a Thousand Faces, comparative mythology scholar Joseph Campbell lists both Apollonius and Jesus as examples of individuals who shared similar hero stories, along with Krishna, Buddha, and others. Similarly, Robert M. Price in his 2011 The Christ-Myth Theory and its Problems, notes that the ancients often compared Jesus with Apollonius and that they both fit the mythic hero archetype. G. K. Chesterton (the writer and Christian apologist), however, noted that the unique trial, suffering and death of Christ stand in stark opposition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> about Apollonius which he felt were very likely spurious.|$|E

In an article for The A.V. Club, Zack Handlen stated that [...] "the humor of Plankton comes from how his operative ambitions are constantly thwarted by a naïve, trusting kid". In 2015, Entertainment Weeklys Hillary Busis named Plankton one of the most devious characters on television, adding in her commentary that he is [...] "voiced to wicked perfection by Doug Lawrence".
