5|$|The storm {{affected}} {{the town of}} Norfolk, where it became <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>damaging</b> storm since 1879. Despite the damage inland, the storm {{is best known for}} the unusually high number of shipwrecks and maritime incidents it caused. One ship, a schooner called the Manantico, capsized, killing the captain and one of its crew members. Three other ships were driven ashore on Virginia beaches from Dam Rock to Cape Henry, and numerous others were put in danger.|$|E

5|$|During {{the season}} at least 16 {{people were killed}} from {{tropical}} disturbances whilst overall damage was estimated at $ (2004USD; $ USD). <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>damaging</b> tropical disturbance was Cyclone Heta which caused at least $ (2004USD; $ USD) in damage to six different countries and left three dead. The deadliest tropical disturbance of the season was Tropical Depression 10F, which was responsible for eleven deaths and caused $ (2004USD; $ USD) in damage. Cyclone Ivy also caused 2 deaths and caused $ (2004USD; $ USD) worth of damage to Vanuatu. As {{a result of the}} impacts caused by Heta and Ivy, the names were retired from the tropical cyclone naming lists.|$|E
5|$|Severe Tropical Cyclone Gene was {{the deadliest}} storm {{as well as}} <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>damaging</b> {{tropical}} cyclone of the 2007–08 South Pacific cyclone season east of 160ºE.

Gene was also recognised by RSMC Nadi as the fifth tropical cyclone and fourth severe tropical cyclone to form within the South Pacific Ocean during the 2007-08 season.|$|E
5|$|The 1956 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season featured a {{low number of}} tropical cyclones, although every tropical storm and hurricane affected land. There were twelvetropical storms, a third of which became hurricanes. One of the hurricanes strengthened to {{the equivalent of a}} major hurricane, which is a Category3 or greater on the Saffir-Simpson scale. The strongest hurricane of the season was Betsy, which was also <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>damaging</b> storm of the season: it destroyed 15,000houses and left $40million in damage in Puerto Rico. Betsy was also the deadliest of the season, having killed 18people in the French West Indies, twofrom a shipwreck in the Caribbean Sea, and 16in Puerto Rico. Tropical Storm Dora struck Mexico in September and killed 27people.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>damage</b> in Minnesota {{occurred}} at the northern edge in Sibley and McLeod Counties. Winds ranged from 80-100 mph (128-160 km/h) in those two counties.|$|R
5|$|The Hamden tornado {{was by far}} {{the most}} {{destructive}} tornado of this family, and possibly <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>damaging</b> of the entire outbreak. It touched down at 5:38pm near the Wilbur Cross Parkway. Industrial cranes and cars were tossed through the air, and rows of houses, as well as an industrial park, were flattened. The tornado lifted just a few minutes later at 5:45. The damage path was only five miles long, stopping just short of the city of New Haven, but it damaged or destroyed almost 400 structures in its path.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} Hurricane Isabel in Maryland and Washington, D.C., were among <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>damaging</b> from a {{tropical}} cyclone in the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area, United States. Hurricane Isabel formed from a tropical wave on September 6, 2003, {{in the tropical}} Atlantic Ocean. It moved northwestward, and within an environment of light wind shear and warm waters, it steadily strengthened to reach peak winds of 165mph (265km/h) on September 11. After fluctuating in intensity for four days, Isabel gradually weakened and made landfall on the Outer Banks of North Carolina with winds of 105mph (165km/h) on September 18. It quickly weakened over land and became extratropical over western Pennsylvania the next day.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the season, a {{shift in}} the Hadley Circulation towards the Tasman Sea {{resulted}} in more frequent episodes of strong wind shear and regular pulses of dry air into the deep tropics, significantly hindering tropical cyclogenesis. The below-average activity was also reflected in an unusually low number of damaging storms. Only two systems, Trina and Waka, had significant effects on land. The former caused extensive flooding on Mangaia while the latter was regarded as one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>damaging</b> storms in the history of Tonga. Approximately $51.3million in damage was attributed to Waka as well as an indirect fatality, the only tropical cyclone-related death of the year, due to cardiac arrest.|$|E

50|$|The capital Khartoum was {{reported}} to be suffering its worst flooding in 25 years, after flash floods struck urban areas earlier in August. While Khartoum is vulnerable to flash floods because of poor drainage and urban planning, the 2013 floods were particular severe. More than 15,000 homes in Khartoum are reported destroyed, with thousands more <b>damaged.</b> <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>damage</b> in Khartoum occurred in Shar El-neel, Ombadah, and Karari. In Blue Nile, floods from heavy rains destroyed almost 12,000 houses in Damazine, El Roseires, Giessan, and Bau, with Damazine reporting <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>damage.</b>|$|R

5|$|Atlantic storms are {{becoming}} more destructive financially, since five of the ten most expensive storms in United States history have occurred since 1990. According to the World Meteorological Organization, “recent increase in societal impact from tropical cyclones has largely been caused by rising concentrations of population and infrastructure in coastal regions.” Pielke et al. (2008) normalized mainland U.S. hurricane damage from 1900–2005 to 2005 values and found no remaining trend of increasing absolute damage. The 1970s and 1980s were notable because of the extremely low amounts of damage compared to other decades. The decade 1996–2005 has the second most damage among the past 11 decades, with only the decade 1926–1935 surpassing its costs. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>damaging</b> single storm is the 1926 Miami hurricane, with $157billion of normalized damage.|$|E
5|$|Fabian was {{the strongest}} {{hurricane}} to hit Bermuda since Hurricane Arlene in 1963. It was both <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>damaging</b> and the first hurricane to cause a death on the island since 1926. The hurricane's powerful winds resulted in moderate damage and destroyed roofs throughout the island. A strong storm surge associated with the hurricane killed four people crossing a causeway on Bermuda, temporarily closing the only link between two islands. The endangered Bermuda petrel, {{better known as the}} cahow, was threatened by the hurricane, which destroyed ten nests, although volunteer work transported the species to a safer location. Strong swells resulted in damage in northern Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, and also caused four people to drown along the United States' Atlantic coast. In all, Fabian caused around US in damage and eight deaths.|$|E
5|$|In 1971, {{political}} friction increased {{between the}} Army and the Air Force over the {{close air support}} (CAS) mission. The Air Force asserted that the Cheyenne would infringe on the Air Force's CAS mission {{in support of the}} Army, which had been mandated with the Key West Agreement of 1948. The Department of Defense (DOD) conducted a study that concluded that the Air Force's A-X program, the Marine Corps' Harrier, and the Cheyenne were significantly different that they did not constitute a duplication of capabilities. On 22 October 1971, the Senate Armed Services subcommittee on Tactical Air Power conducted hearings to evaluate the CAS mission and the pending programs. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>damaging</b> testimony for the Army's program came from the commander of the Air Force's Tactical Air Command, General William W. Momyer, who cited helicopter casualty statistics of Operation Lam Son 719.|$|E
40|$|Radiation {{damage in}} zircon is caused {{primarily}} by Î±-particles from the chain decays of uranium and thorium and to certain extents by fission fragments of uranium {{present in the}} crystals as impurities. We have measured the damage by measuring the fission track densities and the d-spacing of the 112 -plane. It is found that the track density and hence radiation damage varies from 1. 4 Ã— 10 â�µ tracks/cmÂ² for the least damage zircon to 2. 6 Ã— 10 â�¸ tracks/cmÂ² for <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>damage</b> zircon studied. <b>The</b> d-value for 112 -plane {{is found to be}} 2. 5136 Ã… and 2. 5177 Ã… for the least <b>damage</b> to <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>damage</b> zircon respectively. Damage in zircon is healed by annealing as {{can be seen from the}} reduction in track density and the corresponding decreases in d-spacing of 112 -plane. The annealing temperature for complete erasure of the fission track varies from 980 Â°C to 700 Â°C for <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>damage</b> to least damage zircon respectively...|$|R
