2500|$|In 1993 {{after four}} years in Formula One with only one {{significant}} result for the engine, Bob Lutz of Lamborghini's parent company Chrysler, did a hand-shake deal with McLaren boss Ron Dennis for the team to test the LE3512 to evaluate its potential as a race winner. McLaren made {{a modified version of}} their [...] race car, the McLaren MP4/8 dubbed the MP4/8B, to test the engine (the test car took three months to modify to fit the longer and heavier V12). Testing was completed by triple World Champion Ayrton Senna, and future dual World Champion Mika Häkkinen at both the Silverstone Circuit in England and the Estoril circuit in Portugal. After his first drive of the car at Silverstone, Senna suggested certain changes to Forghieri (a less brutal 'top end' and a fatter mid-range), and he complied with engine power increased from [...] to approximately [...] and both drivers were very impressed despite the engine still being somewhat unreliable (Häkkinen reported a massive engine blow up while testing at Silverstone, though he did manage to lap the 5.226km (3.260mi) circuit some 1.4 seconds faster than the teams MP4/8 race car powered by a [...] Ford V8 engine). According to reports, Senna even wanted <b>to</b> <b>race</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> at the Japanese Grand Prix believing that while reliability might be a problem, at least he would be quicker than with the Ford powered race car (ironically Senna would win in both Japan and the last race in Australia with the existing MP4/8). Despite this however, Ron Dennis decided to go with Peugeot V10 engines in [...] due to a better commercial agreement that would give long term stability to the team {{and at the end of}} the 1993 season, the Lamborghini LE3512 was retired from Grand Prix racing after the company was sold by Chrysler to an Indonesian investor group led by Tommy Suharto.|$|E
5000|$|For 1965 {{there was}} again {{work on the}} frame and {{the body and the}} {{displacement}} of <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> was increased to 5046.8 cc - this version (151/4) is called the Tipo 154 by some. The driver [...] "Lucky" [...] Casner was killed during practice prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>race.</b> <b>The</b> <b>engine</b> went on <b>to</b> power the Tipo 65 less than 2 months later.|$|R
50|$|The Mk I and Mk II Mondeo have {{followed}} many other previous Ford models {{into the world}} of banger <b>racing</b> in <b>the</b> UK, and with many plenty of older cars being available for very little money, the Mondeo is now a popular and relatively easy car <b>to</b> <b>race.</b> <b>The</b> Zetec <b>engines</b> are converted to run off a carb set up and the Mondeo bodyshell is fairly tough, but they are proving rather rigid, with many drivers getting injured in high speed impacts. Mondeos are proving more popular than the Sierra and Mk III Granada.|$|R
5000|$|... 1999: The book Bitch: In Praise of Difficult Women by the American author Elizabeth Wurtzel was published. In the {{successful}} {{declaration of the}} word bitch, Wurtzel introduced her philosophy: [...] "I intend <b>to</b> scream, shout, <b>race</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine,</b> call when I feel like it, throw tantrums in Bloomingdale's if I feel like it and confess intimate details about my life to complete strangers. I intend to do what I {{want to do and}} be whom I want to be and answer only to myself: that is, quite simply, the bitch philosophy." ...|$|R
50|$|Speedway Dirt and Pavement racers drive karts built {{specifically}} for oval-track kart racing. Unlike sprint-style and enduro-style karts {{in which the}} driver sits {{in the center of}} the chassis, oval-track karts feature an extreme left driver offset for a high percentage of left-side weight which greatly helps handling on an oval track. <b>Engines</b> are on <b>the</b> right of the kart - reasoning being that the driver weighs more than <b>the</b> <b>engine.</b> This is contrary <b>to</b> <b>race</b> cars, which <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> would greatly outweigh the driver and the oval-kart driver offset theory would not work.|$|R
5000|$|At the 1954 Paris Motor Show, Talbot-Lago {{presented}} their last new engine: the new four-cylinder {{still had the}} typical twin laterally mounted camshafts, although it was upgraded to five main bearings. The new [...] 2,491 cc <b>engine</b> was called <b>the</b> T14 LS, {{but it did not}} have a car to go in until May 1955 when the Talbot-Lago 2500 Coupé T14 LS was finally presented. [...] In addition to its intended use for a road going car, <b>the</b> <b>engine’s</b> size, precisely conforming <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>racing</b> <b>engine</b> category of 2.5-litre engines without compressors, hint at Tony Lago’s other ambitions for the new power unit.|$|R
5000|$|Part {{of taking}} back the word bitch {{was fueled by}} the 1994 single, [...] "All Women Are Bitches" [...] by the all-woman band Fifth Column and later, by the 1999 book Bitch: In Praise of Difficult Women by Elizabeth Wurtzel. In her {{declaration}} of the word bitch, Wurtzel introduces her philosophy: [...] "I intend <b>to</b> scream, shout, <b>race</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine,</b> call when I feel like it, throw tantrums in Bloomingdale's if I feel like it and confess intimate details about my life to complete strangers. I intend to do what I {{want to do and}} be whom I want to be and answer only to myself: that is, quite simply, the bitch philosophy." ...|$|R
5000|$|Andre Simon's was {{the first}} Mercedes <b>to</b> leave <b>the</b> <b>race,</b> with <b>engine</b> failure. Of <b>the</b> other Mercedes, Fangio left <b>the</b> <b>race</b> with {{transmission}} problems on lap 50, leaving Stirling Moss in first and Ascari in second. Lap 80 saw Moss taken out by a minor problem in his car's sophisticated valve train, leaving Ascari in first. Ascari never made it past the pits to see that, however: his Lancia didn't make the chicane (possibly losing traction on oil from Moss's engine failure) and he flipped over the barrier and into the harbour. His Lancia was craned out of 25 feet of water while he {{spent the night in}} the hospital.|$|R
5000|$|Speed Dreams {{features}} computer-controlled opponents <b>to</b> <b>race</b> against, {{commonly called}} [...] "robots". These are software modules, written in C++, which control the behaviour of cars during {{any kind of}} practice, qualification or race session. [...] A module can virtually handle any number of single robot drivers; these share the source code but may have custom car setups and liveries, and even drive different cars.Robots may be programmed {{with any kind of}} function in order <b>to</b> compute <b>racing</b> variables: throttle, brake, steer, gearbox and clutch. [...] These values are sent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>race</b> <b>engine</b> by an open interface of Speed Dreams.Human players are treated just like any other robot: their variables are controlled by user-defined input devices and can be influenced by automated driving aids such as ABS, TCS or speed limiter for pit-stops.|$|R
5000|$|Robots shipped within Speed Dreams {{share some}} kinds of {{behavioural}} functions {{in order to achieve}} realism in the driving simulation.While being loaded, robots compute a racing line, which depends on the track's XML description. Initial fuel amount, conforming to a fuel and pit-stop strategy, is also estimated and requested <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>race</b> <b>engine.</b> During <b>the</b> <b>race</b> robots aim at following <b>the</b> <b>racing</b> line; however their behaviour can be influenced by the parameters received by <b>the</b> <b>race</b> engine; these include the position and the speed of other cars, which is taken into account by collision-avoidance and overtaking algorithms. Robots also have learning capability: they can improve their lap times basing on previously driven laps. A function to regain the track after accidents is also implemented in all official robot engines. Speed Dreams robots can handle a so-called [...] "skilling" [...] parameter, defined by the player: this way the user can alter the robots' performance and therefore their lap times.|$|R
50|$|At the start, Dennis Vitolo stalled his engine at turn 3. But he {{continued}} in <b>the</b> <b>race.</b> <b>The</b> Penske <b>Racing</b> driver Paul Tracy had {{a collision with}} a driver at the chicane. The driver, probably, was André Ribeiro. First caution came out, as Dennis Vitolo had a contact with a tyre wall. PJ Jones went to the pits {{at the time of}} the full course caution. Restart came out very soon, but Michel Jourdain, Jr. was spun by Al Unser, Jr. in the final corner. But he was back on the field. After 9 laps, the top 6 was: Alex Zanardi, Bobby Rahal, Jimmy Vasser, Maurício Gugelmin, Michael Andretti and Bryan Herta. At lap 16, Zanardi missed the hairpin. When he would come back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>race,</b> his <b>engine</b> had stalled. But he remained in <b>the</b> <b>race,</b> although, lost many positions. At lap 20, PJ Jones retired due to an engine failure. At lap 26, Vasser took the lead after overtaking Rahal at turn 10.|$|R
5000|$|... ==History== When {{the track}} opened, in 1947, {{it was a}} 1/2-mile dirt track. In 1964 the track was paved. Today the track is a 1/2-mile asphalt oval with an inner 1/4 mile. During the 1962 season the track's owner Harry Molenaar created a season-ending 100-lap <b>race</b> called <b>the</b> [...] "Tony Bettenhausen Memorial" [...] {{dedicated}} {{to the memory of}} former open wheel Indy car and local racer Tony Bettenhausen who died a year earlier in a racing accident. In 2000 the speedway was repaved {{for the first time in}} nearly 40 years and current owner Mike Mikuly bought the track and also installed cement walls to replace the old guard rails. In 2000 the Turbo Stox division was introduced with great success racing on Illiana's 1/4 mile. 2001 was also the last year for the Street Stock division at Illiana. For the 2003 season track owner Mike Mikuly decided to add a Limited Late Model division to Illiana Motor Speedway's <b>racing</b> card, bringing <b>the</b> track's number of <b>racing</b> divisions <b>to</b> four. <b>The</b> Limited Late Models run a crate (spec) <b>engine.</b> <b>The</b> crate <b>engine</b> is considered to be a lot cheaper <b>to</b> <b>race</b> than <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> used in <b>the</b> Super Late Model division. In 2004 track owner Mike Mikuly decided again to add another division <b>to</b> Illiana's weekly <b>racing</b> program; 4-cylinder Pure Stocks and would <b>race</b> on <b>the</b> tracks 1/4 mile. Illiana added the Legend cars to the weekly program in 2007. They <b>race</b> on <b>the</b> 1/4 mile. On June 24, 2016 the town of schererville announced it had purchased the track and would begin demolition of the speedway.|$|R
50|$|As {{of release}} 2.0, the pit stop {{simulation}} system remains unchanged from TORCS. When racing on tracks {{equipped with a}} pit lane, drivers are assigned a pit stop emplacement according to their position on the starting grid. Since most tracks don't provide enough emplacements for all <b>the</b> <b>race</b> competitors, robot drivers support pit stop sharing. To trigger pit stops, robots have to drive near their emplacement at sufficiently slow speed, then make the stop request <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>race</b> <b>engine,</b> which captures <b>the</b> car and keeps it still and unresponsive {{until the end of}} the process. The human robot automatically sends the request as soon as the other conditions are satisfied; the simulation is then paused, while the player is offered a menu where he can choose the parameters of the stop. Services offered during pit stops are repairing damage, refuelling and serving penalties; the stop's duration is automatically defined and depends on the amount of damage and of fuel to deal with. During pit stops no graphical animation is displayed.|$|R
50|$|Qualifying Engine: This engine {{has even}} {{more power than}} <b>the</b> <b>Racing</b> <b>Engine,</b> but can only be used during {{qualifying}} and must be rebuilt after every <b>race.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Racing</b> <b>Engine</b> must be purchased first.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>engine</b> {{was based}} on a {{production}} Honda K20A <b>engine.</b> For <b>the</b> first season <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> was tuned by Heini Mader <b>Racing.</b> <b>The</b> <b>engine</b> meets FIA Super 2000 regulations, like the WTCC the IFM supports.|$|R
50|$|At the 13th round it was {{announced}} that Pedrosa would switch to Bridgestone tires {{for the remainder of the}} season, and he also planned <b>to</b> start <b>racing</b> <b>the</b> pneumatic valved <b>engine</b> in <b>the</b> 14th round at Indianapolis.|$|R
50|$|Three Ernest Henry {{designed}} team {{cars were}} constructed {{for the event}} and a similar fourth test car served as a test, practice and spare car until its engine was ruined by fire before <b>the</b> <b>race.</b> During <b>the</b> <b>race</b> <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> in all three Sunbeam team cars failed and none finished.|$|R
50|$|Charles Kwan {{stayed with}} EKS Motorsport {{and the team}} entered two BMW 320is for the season, one for Kwan and one for Paul Chan. Charles drove {{one of his most}} memorable <b>races</b> at <b>the</b> Batu Tiga Speedway at Shah Alam this year. His engine had broken down during practice. Although his {{teammate}} Paul Chan kindly lent him his <b>engine</b> for <b>the</b> <b>race,</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> replacement work meant Charles did not take part in qualifying and had <b>to</b> start <b>the</b> <b>race</b> from <b>the</b> back of the grid. Amazingly, in <b>the</b> <b>race</b> he passed all the drivers in front of him to claim a superb victory.|$|R
5|$|Both Tigers {{suffered}} early mechanical failures, {{and neither}} finished <b>the</b> <b>race.</b> <b>The</b> <b>engines</b> {{had been prepared}} by Shelby but had not been properly developed, {{and as a result}} overheated; Shelby eventually refunded the development cost to Rootes. All three of the Le Mans Tigers have survived.|$|R
5000|$|... 3-litre {{versions}} of <b>the</b> XK <b>engine</b> were built from 1959 onwards for FIA sports car racing. It was also popular with small race car manufacturers such as Lister Cars {{who could not}} afford to produce their own engines. As well as endurance <b>racing,</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> was also used in Formula Libre racing.|$|R
50|$|There {{were many}} {{announcements}} prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>race,</b> Brabham announced {{they would use}} Yamaha engines for 1991, Footwork also announced a Porsche engine deal for 1991 and they also retained both drivers in Alex Caffi and Michele Alboreto. Prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>race,</b> <b>the</b> Life <b>Racing</b> <b>Engines</b> and EuroBrun teams withdrew from the sport. EuroBrun's Roberto Moreno joined the Benetton team replacing Alessandro Nannini, whose F1 career ended in a helicopter crash after the Spanish Grand Prix.|$|R
25|$|In 1990, {{the factory}} {{development}} was continued by Scott Brayton and Dominic Dobson, but neither won any <b>races.</b> <b>The</b> <b>engine</b> was utilized by other CART teams in 1991–1992, and was retired after {{the introduction of}} the Ford Cosworth XB with only one victory, that being Rahal's in 1989.|$|R
60|$|Milt let in <b>the</b> reverse, <b>raced</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine,</b> started {{backward}} with a {{burst of}} muddy water churned up by the whirling wheels.

50|$|In late 1970, Jones {{signed with}} a firm for whom McGuire was working, {{designed}} to promote drivers' interests and was selected {{to compete in a}} series of races in Brazil. However, in his first two <b>races</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> failed and in the third the gearbox broke, which meant the opportunity ended.|$|R
50|$|In late 2006, Mazda {{announced}} {{an agreement with}} Advanced Engine Research (AER) to develop the MZR-R motor for sports car <b>racing.</b> <b>The</b> <b>engine</b> is a 2.0 L turbocharged I4 based on the production MZR block http://www.b-kmotorsports.com/car-and-engine/. <b>The</b> <b>engine</b> will initially {{be used by the}} Mazda factory team in the American Le Mans Series as a replacement for their R20B rotary, then later sold to customer teams.|$|R
50|$|Cup Series {{cars are}} unique in {{automobile}} <b>racing.</b> <b>The</b> <b>engines</b> are {{powerful enough to}} reach speeds of over 200 mph, but their weight coupled with a relatively simple aerodynamic package make for poor handling. The bodies and chassis of the cars are strictly regulated to ensure parity, and electronics are traditionally spartan in nature.|$|R
50|$|On 28 July 1927, Barnard died in {{a flying}} {{accident}} while flying the Bristol Type 99A Badminton (G-EBMK). He was performance testing alternative propellers on the aircraft in preparation for entering the 1927 King's Cup <b>Race.</b> <b>The</b> <b>engine</b> failed after take-off from Filton Aerodrome, and the aircraft stalled from a height of about 80 ft.|$|R
50|$|Between 1975 and 1982, Kawasaki {{used the}} design to win four 250 cc and four 350 cc world championships before they retired from Grand Prix <b>racing.</b> <b>The</b> <b>engine</b> design {{was also used}} for a road legal {{production}} motorcycle inspired by the racer. The Kawasaki KR models were instrumental in establishing the company as a manufacturer of high-performance motorcycles.|$|R
50|$|For the 2016 season Mazda {{introduced}} the fourth generation Mazda MX-5. The car is {{built at the}} Hiroshima Mazda factory. The MX-5 Cup version is developed by Mazda North American Operations and Long Road <b>Racing.</b> <b>The</b> <b>engine</b> is a 2.0L SkyActiv.

50|$|Igor Sikorsky {{offered a}} kit {{to replace the}} lower wings with a smaller pair with less drag-producing struts and wires. One example with this {{modification}} and a 150 hp Hispano-Suiza upgrade, was entered in the 1927 National Air <b>Races.</b> Before <b>the</b> <b>races,</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> was upgraded again to a Hispano-Suiza 220 hp <b>engine,</b> which overwhelmed <b>the</b> cooling system with metal shavings, causing the aircraft {{to drop out of}} <b>the</b> <b>race.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> 993 GT2 <b>race</b> car {{featured}} a stripped interior, integrated rollcage for safety, minor {{adjustments to the}} bodywork and wings in order to decrease weight as well as increase downforce, and wider fenders <b>to</b> handle <b>racing</b> slicks. <b>The</b> suspension was modified <b>to</b> improve <b>racing</b> performance, while <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> was slightly tweaked for endurance.

5000|$|The car first {{appeared}} on a race track in July 1908 in the Coupe de l'Auto <b>race,</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> had a capacity of 1460 cc and delivered [...] at 1800 rpm. The top speed of the car was 59 mph, models with a six-cylinder engine were built during the 1910s. After World War I, De Bazelaire manufactured cars with a 2.1 litre S.C.A.P. engine.|$|R
5000|$|They are {{powered by}} small 4-cycle engines (200 cc), {{generally}} starting out as 5 hp Briggs & Stratton engines originally {{referred to as}} [...] "lawnmower" [...] engines, since that is where <b>the</b> first <b>engines</b> were taken from. After being modified for <b>racing,</b> <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> can produce anywhere from 7 to 30+ hp, depending on <b>the</b> <b>racing</b> class. Microstocks were originally designed to hit speeds between 45-65 mph; however, modified racing has pushed them over 100 mph in some cases.|$|R
