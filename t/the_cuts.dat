5|$|By {{executive}} order, Bevin required {{all state}} agencies to reduce spending {{in their current}} budgets by 4.5 percent. House Speaker Greg Stumbo argued that Bevin {{did not have the}} authority to order such reductions without legislative approval, but Senate President Robert Stivers defended Bevin's action, saying it amounted to simply not spending money that was previously allocated. Bevin later compromised with the state's public college and university presidents to reduce <b>the</b> <b>cuts</b> to 2 percent, but Attorney General Andy Beshear sued to stop <b>the</b> <b>cuts</b> entirely. On May 18, 2016, a Franklin Circuit Court judge ruled Bevin did have the authority to make <b>the</b> <b>cuts.</b> The Kentucky Supreme Court accepted the case on appeal, granting Beshear's request to bypass the Kentucky Court of Appeals for expediency. A hearing before the Supreme Court occurred on August 18. On September 21, 2016, the Supreme Court issued a 5–2 decision reversing the Franklin Circuit Court ruling and agreeing with Beshear that Bevin did not have the authority to make mid-year budget cuts without the approval of the General Assembly.|$|E
5|$|The {{collapse}} {{focused attention}} on the Harper government's cancellation of the Joint Emergency Preparedness Program, which provides funds to Canada's five HUSAR teams. The province and the National Fire Protection Association denounced <b>the</b> <b>cuts.</b> The Canadian Centre for Emergency Preparedness suggested that such cuts would necessitate Canada asking for assistance from the United States in similar situations. Also cancelled by the Conservative federal government was the Canadian Emergency Management College, established in 1954 to train first responders. A spokesperson for Public Safety Minister Vic Toews deflected criticism of <b>the</b> <b>cuts,</b> noting that 90 per cent of emergencies are managed municipally or provincially.|$|E

5|$|On January 26, 2016, Bevin {{delivered}} a budget {{address to the}} General Assembly detailing his two-year budget proposal. The proposal cut the allocation for most state agencies by 9 percent over the upcoming biennium, {{with most of the}} savings being redirected into the state pension system, which was among the worst funded in the nation. Public elementary and secondary education were spared from <b>the</b> <b>cuts,</b> as were social workers, public defenders, corrections officers, and Kentucky State Police employees, all of whom received raises under Bevin's proposal. Public colleges and universities were not exempt from <b>the</b> <b>cuts,</b> and Bevin called for a gradual move to performance-based funding for higher education, with all higher education funding tied to performance by 2020.|$|E

Based on recommendations specified by the Township Council, the Board of Education approved $544,391 in cuts. The school budget was rejected again in 2009, with the Council cutting $1 million from the $94.8 million originally proposed. After the 2010 school budget failed, the Township Council removed $6.1 million from the $95 million budget proposed by the school district, zeroing out {{what would have been}} an 8.2% increase in the school tax levy. The school board eliminated 77 positions to meet <b>the</b> <b>cuts</b> approved by the council.|$|E
5|$|Due to its graphic content, Ultime grida dalla savana has {{encountered}} censorship issues with certain countries' film boards. In Australia, the Office of Film and Literature Classification (OFLC) banned both an uncut and cut {{version of the}} film in 1976. An appeal filed later that year was denied. Ten years later, the home video distributor Palace Video brought the same cut print before the film board and it received an R18+ rating. <b>The</b> <b>cuts</b> include segments from the lion attack, the torture and murder of the indigenous man by mercenaries, {{the death of a}} fox by a pack of hounds, and the death of a stag by a hunter in the opening scene.|$|E
5|$|Funding {{problems}} delayed construction even further. In February 1982, President Ronald Reagan proposed cutting Metro construction funds by 21.4 {{percent to}} just $295 million a year. Planned Green Line construction constituted 40.5 percent of Metro's construction budget, and <b>the</b> <b>cuts</b> threatened {{to cancel the}} entire Green Line. To African American community leaders, <b>the</b> <b>cuts</b> were evidence that Metrorail was meant for suburban white commuters while inner city African Americans were relegated to taking Metrobus. Despite the funding troubles, Metro planned to seek contractors in March 1982 for a $60 million contract to tunnel under the Anacostia River, a $60 million contract to build the Anacostia Station, and a $100 million contract to build the Navy Yard Station. But on March 16, 1982, Judge Ramsey barred Metro from spending any money {{on the construction of}} the Rosecroft Raceway route for the southern half of the Green Line. Judge Ramsey held that Metro had decided to shift the Green Line route without properly advertising the public hearings, which the transit system would now be required to hold (delaying construction of the Green Line and Anacostia Station by at least a year). Although Metro had advertised the hearings, Judge Ramsey said, the advertisements contained the same wording flaws that had precipitated the Maryland lawsuit. Metro subsequently scheduled new hearings for June 1982.|$|E

5|$|GoldenEye was edited to be {{guaranteed}} a PG-13 rating from the MPAA and a 12 rating from the BBFC. <b>The</b> <b>cuts</b> included the visible bullet impact to Trevelyan's head {{when he is}} shot in the prologue, several additional deaths during the sequence in which Onatopp guns down the workers at the Severnaya station, more explicit footage and violent behaviour in the Admiral's death, extra footage of Onatopp's death, and Bond giving her a rabbit punch in the car. In 2006, the film was re-mastered and re-edited for the James Bond Ultimate Edition DVD in which the BBFC cuts were restored, causing the rating to be changed to 15. However, the original MPAA edits still remain.|$|E
5|$|In {{the ensuing}} debate, Kennedy asked Phillips {{what would happen}} if Nhu responded to <b>the</b> <b>cuts</b> by {{diverting}} money away from the army to prop up his personal schemes. When Kennedy asked if Nhu would blame the US for any resulting military deterioration, Phillips replied that the ARVN would revolt, because the ARVN officers who were on Viet Cong hit lists would not allow the communists to run loose. Phillips said that if Nhu tried to divert military aid away from the troops to prop up his personal schemes, the Americans could deliver the money straight to the countryside in suitcases.|$|E

The group had a large and active membership in the state at the time, and he used his position to encourage support of Democratic Party agenda. Paul McNutt was the national commander, {{and the two men}} became political allies. When McNutt became governor in 1930, he offered Minton a position {{at the head of a}} new utility regulation commission. As commissioner, Minton successfully imposed regulations that reduced state telephone bills by a combined total of $525,000. <b>The</b> <b>cuts</b> received widespread media coverage, and Minton was credited in the reports with the success.|$|E

Romney sought additional cuts in his last year as governor by vetoing nearly 250items in the state budget; a heavily Democratic legislature overrode all the vetoes.|$|E
5|$|When {{the first}} traffic flowed, crews had not {{finished}} some final tasks, such as painting stripes. Motorists saw a relocation with several mountain cuts built high up the canyon wall, {{with a view}} of the slide and former lake. The roadbed was not expected to last, as weather conditions had been unfavorable when the asphalt was laid. Two mountain cuts were unstable, requiring several months of work before they could be left unattended. During this time, the state stationed two full-time watches at <b>the</b> <b>cuts,</b> who would close the road while falling rocks were cleared. The cut through Billies Mountain was described by the construction crews as a new, man-made mountain pass.|$|E
5|$|After the battle, Persano was {{replaced}} by Admiral Giovanni Vacca; {{he was ordered to}} attack the main Austrian naval base at Pola, but the war ended before the operation could be carried out. After the end of the war, the government lost confidence in the fleet and drastically reduced the naval budget. <b>The</b> <b>cuts</b> were so severe that the fleet had great difficulty in mobilizing its ironclad squadron to attack the port of Civitavecchia in September 1870, as part of the wars of Italian unification. Instead, the ships were laid up and the sailors conscripted to man them were sent home. Terribile was rapidly surpassed, first by central battery and then turret ships, which made the first generation of ironclads like Terribile and her sister obsolete.|$|E

5|$|After the war, the Italian naval {{budget was}} slashed; <b>the</b> <b>cuts</b> were {{so severe that}} the fleet had great {{difficulty}} in mobilizing its ironclad squadron to attack the port of Civitavecchia in September 1870, {{as part of the}} wars of Italian unification. Instead, the ships were laid up and the sailors conscripted to man them were sent home. As the Italian fleet began to rebuild in the 1870s, the Regina Maria Pias returned to active service in a variety of roles, both in the main fleet and in Italy's overseas empire. All four ships were modernized in the late 1880s, and were thereafter used as training ships. Regina Maria Pia, Ancona, and San Martino were stricken from the naval register in 190304, while Castelfidardo lingered on as a torpedo training ship until 1910, when she too was sold for scrapping.|$|E
5|$|Harmáček began {{creating}} his new cuts in 2010. At the time, he {{was working}} as an English teacher in Plzeň, Czech Republic, and had no professional experience with film editing. Instead, he taught himself as the project progressed, beginning with Photoshop skills that he had developed in college. To remove the post-1977 changes, Harmáček was required {{to go through the}} film frame-by-frame, correcting colors and rotoscoping. Undoing some shots took only an hour, while others took hundreds. Lightsabers were color-corrected, shots of the Millennium Falcon cockpit were cropped, Boba Fett's voice was changed, and CGI characters and backgrounds were removed. Most of the source material used for Harmy's Despecialized Edition was taken from the 2011 Blu-ray release, while other sequences were upscaled from GOUT. To create <b>the</b> <b>cuts,</b> source material was taken from the 2011 Blu-ray releases, HDTV broadcasts of the 2004 DVDs, GOUT, digital broadcasts of the 1997 Special Edition, the 1993 LaserDiscs, digital transfers of a Spanish 35mm Kodak LPP and 70mm film cels, a 16mm print, and still images of the original matte paintings. Harmáček edited these sources together using programs such as Avisynth and Adobe After Effects.|$|E
