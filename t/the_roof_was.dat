5|$|Major repairs {{were carried}} out {{beginning}} in 1825. The floor-level was raised above flood-level, a full three feet. <b>The</b> <b>roof</b> <b>was</b> rebuilt, the south wall was rebuilt using the original materials, and the main features of the 12th-century chancel arch were discarded.|$|E
5|$|The inquiry did not {{question}} or raise {{concern with the}} areas of slab removal during original construction in 1980 when escalators were installed after <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> <b>was</b> completed. It is unclear {{if this was a}} contributing factor.|$|E
5|$|In World War II the {{building}} suffered some damage during the Allied bombing campaign, but was later severely damaged during the Battle for Berlin {{towards the end}} of the war. <b>The</b> <b>roof</b> <b>was</b> almost completely destroyed by fire and there was substantial water damage. The statues above the rear entrance, on Klosterstraße, were also destroyed. Assessments estimated that 50% of {{the building}} had suffered damage.|$|E
25|$|The typical {{house is}} {{constructed}} of clay bricks and <b>the</b> <b>roofs</b> <b>are</b> of slate. In some areas <b>the</b> slate <b>roof</b> <b>is</b> also replaced by timber.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>roof</b> <b>is</b> of Banffshire slate.|$|R
50|$|It protects <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> deck from rain before <b>the</b> <b>roofing</b> <b>is</b> installed.|$|R
5|$|The {{building}} has undergone various extensions and alterations {{since it was}} built. The {{building has}} a T shaped plan with the west projecting wing being a hall added in the late 13th century. The great hall has a 15th-century four bay open arch-braced collar-truss timber roof. <b>The</b> <b>roof</b> <b>was</b> covered with slate from local quarries until it was thatched in the mid 19th century. The current clay tiles {{were used in the}} early 20th century.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>roof</b> <b>was</b> {{originally}} thatched {{but now is}} tiled, and {{is supported}} by cruck bracing to the timber frame of six principal trusses. The design of the roof {{is similar to that}} in the other tithe barns of Glastonbury Abbey at Pilton, Manor Farm, Doulting and Glastonbury itself, which is now part of the Somerset Rural Life Museum. The carriage porch where wagons would have been unloaded is covered by the sloping roof.|$|E
5|$|The station, {{which had}} been subject to {{structural}} neglect prior to World War II, suffered extensive bomb damage and was hit by several incendiary devices which damaged the roof. A high explosive also hit platform 8. The original glass roof had been removed before the war {{in an attempt to}} save it; however, the factory in which <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> <b>was</b> stored was itself badly bombed, destroying the roof.|$|E
50|$|The church {{features}} a portico of Doric columns. <b>The</b> original <b>roof</b> <b>was</b> flat but was {{converted to a}} gable in 1864 as <b>the</b> original flat <b>roof</b> <b>was</b> found to be unsuitable in the tropical climate. The apex of <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> <b>is</b> topped by an octagonal shaped steeple.|$|R
50|$|The {{walls of}} the nave are thirteenth century but the massive wooden beams of <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> <b>were</b> unique to a Parish Church with a gothic character. The {{principle}} trusses of <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> <b>are</b> of collar form with the moulded braces pierced with openings of quatrefoil shape.|$|R
40|$|Distribution of {{stresses}} about rectangular openings excavated in {{bedded rock}} was investigated {{by means of}} photoelastic experiments using 37 kinds of models made of gelatine jelly. By those model experiments, influence of ratio of the breadth to {{the height of the}} opening, thickness and elastic modulus of immediate roof and high roof, thickness of packs in the goaf, and fissures contained in <b>the</b> immediate <b>roof</b> or <b>the</b> high <b>roof</b> on <b>the</b> distribution of stresses around the opening was studied. Influence of the thickness of immediate roof, height of caved rocks in the goaf or rigidity of face props in long wall working face were investigated as well. As the results of those experiments, following conclusions were obtained : 1. The tensile stresses of <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> in <b>the</b> bedded rock are larger than these stresses which arise in the non-bedded rock, and the tensile stresses on <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> <b>are</b> larger than <b>the</b> tensile stresses on the floor. 2. When <b>the</b> immediate <b>roof</b> <b>is</b> thick, <b>the</b> tensile stresses on <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> and <b>the</b> compressive stresses on the side walls are considerably smaller than those stresses which arise when <b>the</b> immediate <b>roof</b> <b>is</b> thin. 3. When <b>the</b> high <b>roof</b> <b>is</b> thick, <b>the</b> tensile stresses on <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> <b>are</b> still more small, and the compressive stresses on the side walls are a little larger than these stresses which arise when <b>the</b> high <b>roof</b> <b>is</b> thin. 4. When the modulus of elasticity of <b>the</b> immediate <b>roof</b> <b>is</b> large, <b>the</b> tensile stresses on <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> <b>are</b> larger and <b>the</b> compressive stresses on the side walls are smaller than these stresses which arise when the modulus of elastisity of <b>the</b> immediate <b>roof</b> <b>is</b> large. 5. <b>The</b> compressive stresses on the face decrease as the thickness of the packs in the goaf increases. However, the magnitudes of tensile stresses on <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> undergo only little change. 6. When <b>the</b> immediate <b>roof</b> <b>is</b> fissured, tensile stresses on <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> <b>are</b> almost equal to zero. 7. When <b>the</b> high <b>roof</b> <b>is</b> fissured, <b>the</b> tensile stresses are larger as compared with the case in which <b>the</b> high <b>roof</b> <b>is</b> not fissured. 8. The compressive stresses on the long wall face decrease as the height of caved rocks in the goaf increases. 9. The compressive stresses on the face decrease as the rigidity of face props increases...|$|R
5|$|A second market cross, {{known as}} the Butter Cross, which {{was built in the}} 15th century used to stand near the Yarn Market but was moved to the {{outskirts}} of the village in the 18th or 19th centuries. The Yarn Market is in the guardianship of English Heritage but is managed by the National Trust. In 1951 the Ministry of Works took over various properties including the Yarn Market from the Crown Estate. They carried out restoration works, however this was controversial as the shape of <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> <b>was</b> changed to more closely resemble the appearance of the original building, rather than that produced by subsequent revisions.|$|E
5|$|A {{survey in}} 1932 found that <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> <b>was</b> cracked and it {{eventually}} collapsed in 1935. In 1936 the roof structure was straightened, preserving the medieval trusses where possible, {{and covered with}} clay tiles. The restoration was undertaken by the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings, with the work being funded by Roger Clark of the local shoemakers C. & J. Clark who bought the derelict barn for £5. It has been owned by the National Trust since 1938. Designation as a Grade I listed building first took place in 1961. A survey in 2002 found minor repairs were needed to the doors and wall plate.|$|E
5|$|After {{four weeks}} of filming in Philadelphia, {{the cast and crew}} moved to Wildwood, New Jersey, which doubled for scenes set at the Atlantic City boardwalk. Filming then moved to San Francisco, California. The scene where Birdy and Al climb atop a {{refinery}} building was filmed on the rooftop of an abandoned gasworks in Hercules, California. The scene required Modine and Cage to hang {{off the edge of the}} roof secured by safety wires, while the sequence in which Birdy falls off <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> <b>was</b> performed by a stunt double.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>roof</b> <b>is</b> airy, lightweight, {{and made}} of membrane.|$|R
50|$|The {{home team}} determines if <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> <b>is</b> {{to be opened}} or closed 90 minutes before kickoff. <b>The</b> <b>roof</b> remains open unless {{precipitation}} or lightning is within {{the vicinity of the}} stadium, the temperature drops below 40 F, or wind gusts are greater than 40 mph, in which case <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> operators will close <b>the</b> <b>roof.</b> Once <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> <b>is</b> closed, it is not allowed to be reopened.|$|R
50|$|Nanango Court House is a symmetrically-planned timber {{building}} with a corrugated-iron roof and a wide verandah on three sides. <b>The</b> <b>roof</b> <b>is</b> low-pitched, with prominent gables and wide overhanging eaves. <b>The</b> verandah <b>roofs</b> <b>are</b> supported by grouped timber posts. The projecting entrance is distinguished by a small gable on paired timber posts. Behind it <b>is</b> a half-gabled <b>roof.</b> <b>The</b> main ridge of <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> <b>is</b> surmounted by a large ventilator, with a flagpole, which forms the dominant decorative element of the building.|$|R
5|$|Between 1848 and 1852, land speculators {{laid out}} streets and {{commercial}} plots surrounding the new station. Industry, {{made possible by}} the railroad connections to major cities, soon arrived: a plow company in 1850, a tannery in 1854, and an iron foundry soon after. The city of Ayer, named after Groton-born James Cook Ayer, was incorporated from parts of Groton and Shirley in 1871; the railroad station was then renamed Ayer Junction. The station received a small expansion that year, and a covered island platform was built between the W tracks. <b>The</b> <b>roof</b> <b>was</b> rebuilt with new trusses; the former iron supporting pillars were used to construct the upper story of the nearby Spaulding Block.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, the Allied bombing {{campaign}} and fierce {{fighting in the}} Battle of Berlin caused severe damage; <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> <b>was</b> almost completely destroyed as were the statues above the rear entrance, and there was substantial water damage. In {{the first phase of}} reconstruction in 1951, the statue of the goddess of Fortuna was removed, and is assumed to have been smelted in 1962. The remaining statues, urns, and other carvings on the exterior were removed in 1976–77 due to rain damage. It was completely refurbished in the 1990s and exterior restoration required replacement of some 180 sculptural elements, including the allegorical figures of the virtues, giant vases, window embrasures and one of the columns. The original mansard roof was reconstructed in 1998–99.|$|E
5|$|During the 1948 Summer Olympics, {{the stadium}} hosted the {{football}} preliminaries. For the next 50 years, the stadium changed little, although during the Second World War the North Bank terrace was bombed {{and had to}} be rebuilt; <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> <b>was</b> not restored until 1956. Floodlights were fitted in 1951, with the first floodlit match being a friendly against Hapoel Tel Aviv on 19 September of that year. The floodlights that adorn Dalymount Park, once stood at the Arsenal stadium. They were shipped to Dublin in 1962. The inaugural floodlit match saw Arsenal beat Bohemians 3–8. Undersoil heating was added in 1964. Unlike at many other grounds, Arsenal refused to install perimeter fencing, even at the height of hooliganism in the 1980s, which made it ineligible for use as an FA Cup semi-final venue.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>roof</b> protudes about 5 {{feet from}} the wall and is {{supported}} by solid molded brackets. <b>The</b> <b>roof</b> <b>is</b> tiled in a reddish colored clay. <b>The</b> <b>roof</b> <b>is</b> protruded by a Mission-style dormer, the window is surrounded by a pillar topped by a stone ball. The dormer rises in a step/curved pattern to an arch. The stylized window lights the waiting room below.|$|R

5|$|In the {{south-east}} {{corner of}} the walls is God's House tower. This is architecturally important as {{it was one of}} the first urban buildings to be built to hold gunpowder artillery – in this respect, it closely resembles Cow Tower in Norwich. The tower was built alongside God's House Gate and is three storeys high. The gunports designed for handcannon can be seen on the outside, and <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> <b>was</b> designed to hold larger cannon. Adjacent to the tower is God's House Gate, a two-storey building also equipped with a gun-port.|$|E
5|$|Maybeck {{designed}} a dining hall {{much like the}} living room, with Gothic stone walls and high peaked roof, and two opposing fireplaces, but its Gothic tables were unusually placed against the walls leaving the center area open. Benches were provided for diners to sit. The kitchen wing, , adjoined the dining room, connected through a wide butler's hall. Staff were provided rooms in the kitchen wing. Its foundation of cut stone reached {{to the top of}} the ground floor; the second story's wall was of rubble stone. <b>The</b> <b>roof</b> <b>was</b> topped by light gray slate. Initial critical reactions to the kitchen wing's exterior appearance led Hearst to surround it with shrubbery.|$|E
5|$|Meare Pool was drained {{after the}} Dissolution of the Monasteries {{and the fish}} house fell into disrepair. It {{suffered}} {{a fire in the}} 1880s, which destroyed the roof and gutted the interior. In 1893 some repairs were made to the walls, although <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> <b>was</b> not replaced until work was undertaken by the Ministry of Works in the 1920s, with further conservation being carried out in the 1960s. A piece of timber from the building was subject to dendrochronology testing in an attempt to provide a more specific date for the buildings construction, but the results proved inconclusive.|$|E

5|$|Musicals {{continued}} to dominate at the theatre in the post-Second World War period, including transfers {{of the successful}} Broadway productions Follow the Girls (1945; 572 performances) and the Lerner and Loewe musicals Brigadoon (1949; 685 performances) and Paint Your Wagon (1953; 478 performances). Leonard Bernstein's West Side Story opened in December 1958 for a run of 1,039 performances, transferring from Broadway via the Manchester Opera House. The London premiere of Fiddler on <b>the</b> <b>Roof</b> <b>was</b> on 16 February 1967, starring Chaim Topol, and the production ran at Her Majesty's for 2,030 performances. Forty years after the original stage adaptation, André Previn's musical adaptation of The Good Companions premiered on 11 July 1974, followed by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Alan Ayckbourn's initially unsuccessful collaboration, Jeeves, on 22 April 1975, which has since enjoyed considerable success.|$|E
5|$|Robert Wood, the {{engineer}} who {{signed off on}} {{the engineer}}ing report declaring the mall structurally sound just {{a few weeks before the}} roof collapse, was charged with two counts of criminal negligence causing death and one count of criminal negligence causing bodily harm. According to the inquiry, Wood had previously indicated in conversation that he was aware that <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> <b>was</b> at risk of caving in, but altered his final report at Nazarian's request so that the structural issues did not jeopardize the building's refinancing. His trial began in September 2016.|$|E
5|$|Rosenborg had {{originally}} planned to build additional commercial facilities and a tower hotel during the 2002 construction, {{but this was}} canceled. At the 2011 annual meeting, the plans were again launched by Skutle, who stated that construction might start as early as 2011. In March 2005, Rosenborg announced {{plans to build a}} retractable roof over the pitch and lay artificial turf. <b>The</b> <b>roof</b> <b>was</b> estimated to cost NOK100 million, and the club estimated that it could generate NOK30 million per year in increased revenue from concerts and events. By 2007, the roof plans were delayed, with management stating that it would be necessary to complete the construction of all stands before a roof was built, and that they believed the stadium would soon be expanded.|$|E
50|$|The ceiling framing, {{like the}} walls, {{is a mixture}} of timber and iron. The rafters and king-posts are iron, while the battens <b>are</b> timber. <b>The</b> gable <b>roof</b> <b>is</b> clad with 3-inch {{corrugated}} fibrous cement nailed to battens. <b>The</b> <b>roof</b> eaves <b>are</b> supported on timber and steel brackets. A corrugated iron awning over the eastern verandah is attached to <b>the</b> main <b>roof</b> and <b>is</b> supported on timber brackets. A large ventilator runs along the ridge of <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> and small circular one set into <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> <b>is</b> located near <b>the</b> north-west corner.|$|R
