5|$|Spathularia flavida may be {{distinguished}} from the velvet-foot fairy fan (Spathulariopsis velutipes) by differences in the stem: S.velutipes is fuzzy and brown rather than smooth and yellowish. The fuzziness {{is a result of}} a thin layer of intertwined hyphae that cover the stem, which project short hyphae outward from the surface. The closely related species S.neesi has an ochre color, spores <b>that</b> <b>measure</b> 60–80 by 1.5–2µm, and paraphyses that are branched on the upper parts. Neolecta irregularis is roughly similar in appearance to S.flavida, but lacks a sharply differentiated, spoon-shaped head, has a stem lighter in color than the head, and microscopically, has much smaller oval to elliptical spores <b>that</b> <b>measure</b> 5.5–8.5 by 3–4µm. Another yellowish earth-tongue fungus, Microglossum rufum, has a well-defined oval to spoon-shaped head, and sausage- to spindle-shaped spores that are 18–38 by 4–6µm.|$|E
5|$|Agaricus bitorquis, also edible, has {{a similar}} appearance, but can be {{distinguished}} by its double ring, {{and the lack of}} a fishy or briny odor. Additionally, A.bitorquis does not stain reddish when cut, and usually does not have a scaly or warty cap. The Hungarian species A.bernardiiformis, named for its similarity to A.bernardii, is distinguished from the latter by its smaller spores (6.2–8.2 by 5.4–6.2μm) and its club-shaped cheilocystidia <b>that</b> <b>measure</b> 17–35 by 7–9.5μm. MycoBank, however, considers the two species to be conspecific.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the renal {{function}} measured with either 99 mTc-DTPA or 99 mTc-EC dynamic scintigraphies with <b>that</b> <b>measured</b> using 99 mTc-DMSA static scintigraphy. METHODS: the values of relative renal function measured in 111 renal dynamic scintigraphies performed either with 99 mTc-DTPA (55 studies) or with 99 mTc-EC (56 studies) were compared with the relative function measured using 99 mTc-DMSA static scintigraphy performed within a 1 -month period. The comparisons were performed using Wilcoxon signed rank test. The number of 99 mTc-DTPA and 99 mTc-EC studies that presented relative renal function different by more than 5 % from <b>that</b> <b>measured</b> with 99 mTc-DMSA, using chi square test were also compared. RESULTS: the relative renal function measured with 99 mTc-EC is not statistically different from <b>that</b> <b>measured</b> with 99 mTc-DMSA (p = 0. 97). The relative renal function measured with 99 mTc-DTPA was statistically different from <b>that</b> <b>measured</b> using 99 mTc-DMSA, but with a borderline statistical significance (p = 0. 05). The number of studies with relative renal function different by more than 5 % from <b>that</b> <b>measured</b> with 99 mTc-DMSA is higher for the 99 mTc-DTPA scintigraphy (p = 0. 04) than for 99 mTc-EC. CONCLUSION: the relative renal function measured with 99 mTc-EC dynamic scintigraphy is comparable with <b>that</b> <b>measured</b> with 99 mTc-DMSA static scintigraphy, while the relative renal function measured with 99 mTc-DTPA dynamic scintigraphy presents a significant statistical difference from <b>that</b> <b>measured</b> with 99 mTc-DMSA static scintigraphy...|$|R

5|$|Characteristics {{typically}} {{used to identify}} Bovista pila in the field include its relatively small size, the metallic lustre of the endoperidium, {{and the presence of}} rhizomorphs. B.plumbea is similar in appearance, but can be distinguished by its typically smaller fruit body and the blue-gray color of its inner coat. Unlike B.pila, B.plumbea is attached to the ground by a mass of mycelial fibers known as a sterile base. Microscopically, B.plumbea has larger spores (5–7 by 4.5–6.0μm); with long pedicels (9–14μm). Another lookalike is the European B.nigrescens, which can most reliably be distinguished from B.pila by its microscopic characteristics. The spores of B.nigrescens are oval rather than spherical, rougher than those of B.pila, and have a hyaline (translucent) pedicel about equal in length to the spore diameter (5μm). The puffball Disciseda pila was named for its external resemblance to B.pila. Found in Texas and Argentina, it has much larger, warted spores <b>that</b> <b>measure</b> 7.9–9.4μm.|$|E
5|$|Mycena galericulata {{produces}} a white spore print. The spores are , 8–10 by 5.5–7μm, and amyloid—which means they will turn blue-black to black when stained with Melzer's reagent. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) have stout sterigmata, and measure 34–40 by 7–9μm. They may be either two-spored or four-spored. There are numerous club-shaped to rounded cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge), <b>that</b> <b>measure</b> 32–40 by 8–12μm; their apices or the entire enlarged portion bear rodlike projections that become increasingly elongated and branched in age. There are no pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face). The gill tissue {{has a very}} thin cuticle, under which is a narrow hypoderm, while {{the remainder of the}} tissue comprises densely matted tufts of mycelia, and stains deep vinaceous-brown in iodine.

Although the grassland habitat {{of the two}} species is similar, P.semilanceata does not grow directly on dung; rather, it is a saprobic species that grows on decaying grass roots. P.fimetaria also resembles P.hispanica, {{but it also has}} a mycenoid appearance and has a ring on the stem. In terms of microscopic characteristics, P.fimetaria has larger cheilocystidia <b>that</b> <b>measure</b> 20–32 by 4–8μm. P.hispanica differs from P.liniformans var. liniformans in that it lacks a gelatinous gill edge. P. liniformans var. americana has larger cheilocystidia, measuring 22–33 by 5.5–9μm, and it is known to grow only on soil around herbs, in the Northwest and Northeast USA and Chile. Deconica coprophila (formerly known as Psilocybe coprophila) is a small brownish mushroom that also grows on dung, but it does not contain psilocybin and does not have a bluing stem.|$|E
5|$|Rhythm game, or rhythm action, is a subgenre {{of action}} game that {{challenges}} a player's sense of rhythm. The genre includes dance games such as Dance Dance Revolution and music-based games such as Donkey Konga and Guitar Hero. Games in the genre challenge the player to press buttons at precise times: the screen shows which button the player {{is required to}} press, and the game awards points both for accuracy and for synchronization with the beat. The genre also includes games <b>that</b> <b>measure</b> rhythm and pitch, {{in order to test}} a player's singing ability, and games that challenge the player to control their volume by measuring how hard they press each button. While songs can be sight read, players usually practice to master more difficult songs and settings. Certain rhythm games offer a challenge similar to that of Simon says, in that the player must watch, remember, and repeat complex sequences of button-presses. Rhythm-action can take a minigame format with some games blending rhythm with other genres or entirely comprising minigame collections.|$|E
5|$|The capillitium {{refers to}} coarse, late-maturing, {{thick-walled}} {{cells in the}} gleba that develop pores or slits in their thick secondary walls. The capillitial hyphae are 1.5–9.5µm wide, thick-walled, often with a narrow lumen, and with or without surface ornamentation. The columella hyphae are 1.5–14µm wide (occasionally wider, up to 34µm), thick-walled, often with narrow lumen. Single thin-walled, about 1.5µm wide hyphae with clamps can be observed. The endoperidial hyphae are densely interwoven, thick-walled, and about 2–6µm wide. The whitish powder on newly expanded specimens consists of crystalline matter and thin-walled, 1.5–4µm wide, branched hyphae with clamps. The peristome hyphae are thick-walled, 2–11µm wide. The pseudoparenchymatous layer is built up by bladder-like, thin-walled hyphae of varying size. On the surface of newly expanded specimens crystals and thin-walled hyphae {{of the same kind}} as on the endoperidium are present. The crystals are calcium oxalate dihydrate that have the crystalline structure of a pyramid, and are arranged singly or in loose aggregates, 11 to 30µm in size. The fibrous layer has thick-walled hyphae 1.5–4µm wide. The mycelial layer in the inner, very thin part (seen as a glossy lining on the fibrous layer of newly expanded fruit bodies) consists of a dense web of thin-walled, 1.5–4µm wide, clamped hyphae. Thick-walled hyphae are also present, measuring 2–11 (sometimes up to 19)µm wide.
