5|$|English pronouns {{conserve}} many {{traits of}} case and gender inflection. The personal pronouns retain {{a difference between}} subjective and objective case in most persons (I/me, he/him, she/her, we/us, they/them) {{as well as a}} gender and animateness distinction in the third person singular (distinguishing he/she/it). The subjective case corresponds to the Old English nominative case, and the objective case is used both in <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> previous accusative case (in the role of patient, or direct object of a transitive verb), and in <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Old English dative case (in the role of a recipient or indirect object of a transitive verb). Subjective case is used when the pronoun {{is the subject of a}} finite clause, and otherwise the objective case is used. While grammarians such as Henry Sweet and Otto Jespersen noted that the English cases did not correspond to the traditional Latin based system, some contemporary grammars, for example , retain traditional labels for the cases, calling them nominative and accusative cases respectively.|$|E
5|$|Various {{advocacy}} groups have given Biden scores or grades {{as to how}} well his votes align with the positions of each group. The American Civil Liberties Union gives him an 80 percent lifetime score, with a 91 percent score for the 110th Congress. Biden opposes drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and supports governmental funding to find new energy sources. Biden believes action must be taken on global warming. He co-sponsored <b>the</b> <b>Sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Senate resolution calling on the United States {{to be a part}} of the United Nations climate negotiations and the Boxer-Sanders Global Warming Pollution Reduction Act, the most stringent climate bill in the United States Senate. Biden was given an 85percent lifetime approval rating from AFL-CIO, and he voted for the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a novel {{maximum power point}} tracking technique aimed at maximizing the power produced by photovoltaic systems. <b>The</b> largest part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> approaches presented in literature are based on <b>the</b> <b>sensing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> photovoltaic generator voltage. On the contrary, in this paper a current-based technique is proposed: <b>the</b> <b>sensing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> current in the capacitor placed in parallel with the photovoltaic source is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> innovative aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proposal. A dual control loop based on the sliding mode control ensures a very fast tracking of irradiation variations. Features <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proposed algorithm are supported by a theoretical analysis and simulations. The technique described in this paper is patent pending...|$|R

25|$|The {{narrative}} of the film differs considerably from the events of Nash's life, as filmmakers made choices for <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> story.

Third, mathematical truth is fixed by mathematical proof. These theses are defended. <b>The</b> philosophy <b>of</b> math-ematics defined by the three theses is compared with realism, nominalism and formalism...|$|R

25|$|Different ecclesiologies give {{shape to}} very {{different}} institutions. Thus, {{in addition to}} describing a broad discipline of theology, ecclesiology {{may be used in}} the specific sense of a particular church or denomination's character, self-described or otherwise.

25|$|In the Romance languages, <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{word had}} come to be {{extended}} to Baltic amber (fossil resin) from as early as the late 13th century.

25|$|Clausen {{argued that}} the poem, were one to remove lines 1–3 and 58–9, would read much like an epithalamium, or a poem written {{specifically}} for a bride {{on the way to}} her marital chamber. However, the addition of the aforementioned lines changes <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> poem, making it pastoral. Thus, Clausen claims that Virgil himself added these new lines to tweak the poem and make it suitable for inclusion in the Eclogues.|$|E
25|$|In {{theoretical}} investigation {{there is}} only one meaning that can rationally be attached to the expression Inflation: an increase in <b>the</b> quantity <b>of</b> money (in <b>the</b> broader <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> term, so as to include fiduciary media as well), that is not offset by a corresponding increase in the need for money (again in <b>the</b> broader <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> term), so that a fall in <b>the</b> objective exchange-value <b>of</b> money must occur.|$|R
