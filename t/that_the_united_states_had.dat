During the 1970s and 1980s, he was a major critic of the renewed arms race as détente was ended.|$|E

Selected as a relay swimmer only, he went to Los Angeles hoping to win the 4100m freestyle relay, an event <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>had</b> always won.|$|E
5|$|In {{his book}} The Technology Edge, {{published}} in 1983, O'Neill wrote about economic competition with Japan. He argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>had</b> to develop six industries to compete: microengineering, robotics, genetic engineering, magnetic flight, family aircraft, and space science. He also thought that industrial development {{was suffering from}} short-sighted executives, self-interested unions, high taxes, and poor education of Americans. According to reviewer Henry Weil, O'Neill's detailed explanations of emerging technologies differentiated the book from others on the subject.|$|E

The 1846 legislature met in the home of Henry Montgomery Knighton in Oregon City from December 1 through 19, with Asa Lovejoy serving as the speaker and leader.

The affair became a political scandal in the United States during the 1980s. The International Court of Justice, whose jurisdiction to decide the case was disputed by the United States, ruled <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>had</b> violated international law and breached treaties in Nicaragua in various ways.|$|E
5|$|On January 16, 1946, Novikov {{submitted}} to Stalin plans that would {{lay the groundwork}} for the modern Soviet air force and the industry that would supply it. On April 22, 1946, however, before these could be enacted, Novikov was stripped of his rank and titles and then arrested. The reason for this was that at the Potsdam conference it was discovered <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>had</b> better spy planes than the Soviet Union. He was interrogated and tortured the next day and again between May 4 and May 8, 1946 by Lavrentiy Beria before being forced to read a confession to the Politburo implicating Marshal Zhukov. Novikov was tried by the Military Collegium and sentenced to fifteen years in a labor camp.|$|E

5|$|The Winnebago War, {{also known}} as the Winnebago Uprising, was a brief {{conflict}} that took place in 1827 in the Upper Mississippi River region of the United States, primarily in what is now the state of Wisconsin. Not quite a war, the hostilities were limited to a few attacks on American civilians by a portion of the Winnebago (or Ho-Chunk) Native American tribe. The Ho-Chunks were reacting to a wave of lead miners trespassing on their lands, and to false rumors <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>had</b> sent two Ho-Chunk prisoners to a rival tribe for execution.|$|E

5|$|In 1999, {{the tribe}} {{filed suit in}} the United States Court of Federal Claims, seeking $14,000,000 in damages for breach of trust by DOI. The tribe argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>had</b> {{exclusive}} control over the buildings and allowed them to fall into disrepair, {{a violation of the}} trust relationship established by the 1960 statute. Additionally, the tribe claimed that the Snyder Act and the National Historic Preservation Act applied in this case. The Snyder Act deals with appropriations to the BIA, and the National Historic Preservation Act discussed federal assistance for preservation programs. The United States moved for dismissal on the basis of lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim. In addition, the United States claimed that the statute of limitations had run under both the Tucker Act and the Indian Tucker Act, the acts governing claims in the Federal Court of Claims. The trial court dismissed the suit on the failure to state a claim.|$|E
