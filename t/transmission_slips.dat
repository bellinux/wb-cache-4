However, the presence of an aggressive environment such as hydrogen increases the susceptibility to intergranular fracture. Further, {{there is a lack of}} systematic investigations exploring the role of hydrogen on the dislocation-grain-boundary (DGB) interactions. Thus, in this work, the effect of hydrogen on the interactions between a screw dislocation and tilt GBs in α-Fe were examined.

Further, there exists a strong correlation between the GB energy and the energy barrier for <b>slip</b> <b>transmission.</b> In other words, GBs with lower interfacial energy demonstrate a higher barrier for <b>slip</b> <b>transmission.</b> The introduction of hydrogen along the GB causes the energy barrier for <b>slip</b> <b>transmission</b> to increase consistently for all of the GBs examined.

In this work, strain fields across grain boundaries were measured using advanced digital {{image correlation}} techniques. In conjunction with strain measurements, grain orientations from electron back-scattered diffraction were used to establish the dislocation reactions at each boundary, providing the corresponding residual Burgers vectors due to <b>slip</b> <b>transmission</b> across the interfaces. A close correlation was found between the magnitude of the residual Burgers vector and the local strain change across the boundary. When the residual Burgers vector magnitude (with respect to the lattice spacing) exceeds 1. 0, the high strains {{on one side of the}} boundary are paired with low strains across the boundary, indicating the difficulties for slip dislocations to penetrate the grain interfaces.

A study was conducted on <b>slip</b> <b>transmission</b> using SEM, TEM, optical profilometry and four point probe resistivity measurements on un-deformed and deformed samples of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V-xB with five levels of boron. Optical profilometry was used to quantify the magnitude of offsets on slip traces which in turn provided information about the extent of planar or multiple slip. Studies on deformed samples reveal that while lath boundaries appear to easily permit dislocation <b>slip</b> <b>transmission,</b> colony boundaries are potent barriers to slip. From TEM studies it was also observed that while alloys containing lower boron underwent planar slip, deformation was more homogeneous in higher boron alloys due to multiple slip resulting from large number of colony boundaries.

40|$|The {{mechanical}} {{response to}} nanoinclentation near grain boundaries {{has been investigated}} in an Fe- 14 %Si bicrystal with a general grain boundary and two Mo bicrystals with symmetric tilt boundaries, In particular, the indentations performed on the Fe- 14 %Si show that as the grain boundary is approached, {{in addition to the}} occurrence of a first plateau in the load versus depth nanoindentation curve, which indicates grain interior yielding, a second plateau is observed, which is believed to indicate dislocation transfer across the boundary. It is noted that the hardness at the onset of these yield excursions increases as the distance of the tip to the boundary decreases, providing thus a new type of size effects, which can be obtained through nano indentation. The energy released during an excursion compares well to the calculated interaction energy of the piled-up dislocations. Hall-Petch slope values calculated from the excursions are consistent with macroscopically determined properties, suggesting that the Hall-Petch slope may be used to predict whether <b>slip</b> <b>transmission</b> occurs during indentation. No <b>slip</b> <b>transmission</b> was observed in the Mo bicrystals; however, the staircase yielding commonly found during initial loading was suppressed in the proximity of a grain boundary due to preferential dislocation nucleation at the boundary.

In the case of cipher <b>transmission,</b> these <b>slips</b> produce a loss of the synchronization between transmitter and receiver, which is accompanied {{by the loss of}} the information being transmitted. Self-synchronizing modes of block ciphers are used for the elimination of this phenomenon. An important characteristic of these mode types is the average number of bits that were transmitted between the end of the slip and the moment of synchronization recovery- so-called resynchronization interval. In this paper, the probability distribution of the occurrence of a synchronization sequence in the cryptogram is derived first. On this basis, formulas for computing the resynchronization interval of OCFB and modified SCFB statistical self-synchronizing modes of block ciphers are then derived.

During the 1960 s and 1970 s, one of the major topics of debate in macroeconomics dealt with the nature of this transmission mechanism. As attention shifted towards the role of expectations and inflation, research on the <b>transmission</b> mechanism <b>slipped</b> from its prominent position. Instead, monetary models of the 1980 s often simply assumed the inflation rate was under the direct control of the central bank, while models since the mid- 1990 s have often treated the output gap as if it were directly controlled. The linkages from the central bank’s actual instruments, such as the level of reserves, and macro variables such as output were ignored. That is, the transmission mechanism was treated as an uninteresting issue, or perhaps as one that was sufficiently well understood that it no longer attracted the attention of most researchers.

40|$|Duplex {{stainless}} steels (DSS) have become candidate materials for structural applications, where conventional austenitic {{stainless steels}} fail due to very high cycle fatigue (VHCF) in combination with corrosive attack. It seems that DSS exhibit a fatigue limit, which {{can be attributed to}} the two-phase austenitic–ferritic microstructure. Ultrasonic VHCF testing revealed that the phase boundaries are efficient obstacles for the <b>transmission</b> of <b>slip</b> bands and microstructural fatigue cracks up to 109 cycles and even beyond. The barrier strength is determined by the misorientation relationship between neighbouring grains but also by the strength of the individual phases. By thermal treatment at 475 °C, spinodal decomposition of the ferrite phase results in the formation of Cr-rich α′ precipitates. While during static loading these precipitates give rise to a loss in ductility (475 °C embrittlement), it was shown that the HCF strength can be increased and that there is also a tendency towards a beneficial effect on the VHCF behaviour. A more detailed analysis of the local plasticity sites by means of atom probe tomography (APT) revealed a dissolution of the α′ precipitates within operated slip bands. The dissolution might be an indication for a local softening mechanism that limits the VHCF strengthening effect of spinodal decomposition...|$|R

Coherency stress is predicted to dramatically alter the dislocation core configuration and impart additional strength regardless of the sign.
