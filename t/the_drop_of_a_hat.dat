25|$|As a {{young man}} Flanders seemed to be heading for a {{successful}} acting career. He contracted polio in 1943 while serving in the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve {{and for the rest}} of his life was reliant on a wheelchair. He made a career as a prolific broadcaster on radio and later television, and together with his old schoolfriend, the composer Donald Swann, he wrote successful songs in the late 1940s and early and mid-1950s for revues in the West End of London. In 1956 they themselves performed some of these songs, along with new songs, in a two-man revue, At <b>the</b> <b>Drop</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Hat.</b> This show, and its successor, At the Drop of Another Hat, ran with occasional short breaks from 1956 to 1967 and played in theatres throughout the British Isles, the US, Australia and elsewhere.|$|E

Usually deployed on the right wing, Robben often cuts inside on his left foot to move to a more central attacking position, and uses his speed and dribbling skills to take on defenders until he finds the space to make an attempt on goal.|$|E
500|$|We met land crabs, too, {{and were}} sadly disappointed. They were small, {{no larger than}} an {{ordinary}} edible crab, with bloated shells and moderately long pincers. Some were of beetroot purple, others yellow or orange, apparently two colour-phases of the same species. They were shy, freezing with pincers erect when alarmed, usually to be found within a short distance of their burrows and ready to scuttle down at <b>the</b> <b>drop</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>hat.</b> In rainy weather they promenaded more freely, sometimes appearing {{at the side of}} road with arms waving like diminutive but aggressive hitch-hikers. Fringed mandibles [...] suggest a permanently turned-down mouth, giving them a disgruntled, unhappy expression; they were disagreeable rather than sinister and fell far short of their reputation. The first land crab I met was sitting in a prickly pear bush, sadly munching one of the brilliant red fruits and dribbling juice. I could never take them seriously after that.|$|E

500|$|During {{the casting}} process, Keamy was {{described}} as a military type in his late-twenties who does not question orders. [...] Chris Carabott of IGN wrote that [...] "in a show that features characters fraught with uncertainty, Keamy is the polar opposite and his Marine mentality definitely sets him apart. [...] His team has a physical advantage {{and with the help of}} Mr. Widmore, they have a tactical advantage as well. [...] Keamy is like a bulldog being thrown into a cage full of kittens (except for [...] Sayid)". [...] Jay Glatfelter of The Huffington Post, stated that [...] "Keamy is Crazy! … out of all the bad guys on the Island—past, present, and future—Keamy has to be one of the most dangerous ones. [...] Not because of how big he is, or the weaponry, but his willingness to kill at <b>the</b> <b>drop</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>hat.</b> [...] That doesn't bode well for our Losties [...]" [...] Co-show runner/executive producer/writer Carlton Cuse has stated that he and the other writers create [...] "complex" [...] characters because they [...] "are interested in exploring how good and evil can be embodied in the same characters and [...] the struggles we all have to overcome the dark parts of our souls"; however, he later clarified that there is an exception: [...] "Keamy's bad, he knows he's bad, but he's ... a guy that does the job." [...] Damon Lindelof stated that [...] "the great thing about Keamy is that he is like a ... merciless survivor. [...] 's this great moment [...] where he just sort of hackie-sacks [...] over to where [...] Omar is standing. [...] Omar is certainly an acceptable casualty as far as Keamy is concerned." [...] According to a featurette in the Lost: The Complete Fourth Season – The Expanded Experience DVD set, Keamy likes [...] "heavy weaponry" [...] and [...] "physical fitness" [...] and dislikes [...] "negotiations" [...] and [...] "doctors".|$|E

2500|$|The opera also {{includes}} and parodies elements of melodrama, popular at the Adelphi Theatre. [...] There is a priggishly good-mannered poor-but-virtuous heroine, a villain who carries off the maiden, {{a hero in}} disguise and his faithful old retainer who dreams of their former glory days, the snake-in-the-grass sailor who claims to be following his heart, the wild, mad girl, the swagger of fire-eating patriotism, ghosts coming to life to enforce a curse, and so forth. [...] But Gilbert, in his customary topsy-turvy fashion, turns the moral absolutes of melodrama upside down: The hero becomes evil, the villain becomes good, and the virtuous maiden changes fiancés at <b>the</b> <b>drop</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>hat.</b> [...] The ghosts come back to life, foiling the curse, and all ends happily.|$|E

The color palette can shift from vibrant and inviting to grim and menacing at <b>the</b> <b>drop</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>hat,</b> the character designs are unique and appealing, the CG is very minimal, and the action sequences are some of the best that the shounen genre has ever produced, on-par with the best works of Studio Bones.

[...] For {{the first half of the}} season, Bush continued as the Tigers' starting shortstop. Halfway through the season, however, Cobb moved Bush from his regular shortstop position to second base.|$|E
