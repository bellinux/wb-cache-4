5|$|At {{the end of}} {{his first}} tour, Overton volunteered for a second tour in Korea in a fighter unit. For this tour, Overton joined the 16th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, 51st Fighter-Interceptor Wing at Suwon Air Base. For the first several weeks in <b>this</b> <b>assignment,</b> Overton saw little action. He flew 40 {{missions}} into MiG alley without making contact with any Soviet, Chinese or North Korean pilots. He flew an F-86 Sabre, tail number 50-631, nicknamed Dolph's Devil and Angel in Disguise.|$|E
5|$|Benjen Stark's horse {{returns from}} {{north of the}} Wall without him, much to the worry of his nephew, Jon Snow. Later, to Jon's {{disappointment}} and anger, he is told he has been assigned as a steward to the Lord Commander instead of a ranger, like his uncle. Jon suspects Ser Alliser Thorne's involvement, as revenge for Jon defying him; however, Sam believes that <b>this</b> <b>assignment</b> may mean he is being groomed for command. As Jon and Sam take their vows near a heart tree, Jon's direwolf brings him a dismembered hand.|$|E
5|$|In natural diamonds, several hydrogen-related IR {{absorption}} peaks {{are commonly}} observed; the strongest ones are located at 1405, 3107 and 3237cm−1 (see IR absorption figure above). The microscopic {{structure of the}} corresponding defects is yet unknown {{and it is not}} even certain whether or not those defects originate in diamond or in foreign inclusions. Gray color in some diamonds from the Argyle mine in Australia is often associated with those hydrogen defects, but again, <b>this</b> <b>assignment</b> is yet unproven.|$|E

5|$|It {{was during}} <b>this</b> <b>assignment</b> that she {{suffered}} a near-catastrophe {{when she ran}} aground on Pearl Rock, near Gibraltar in 1871 and nearly sank. Agincourt was leading the inshore column of ships, contrary to normal practice where the senior flagship lead the inshore column, and gently ran aground sideways when the senior flagship's navigator failed {{to compensate for the}} set of the tide. Warrior, immediately following her, nearly collided with her, but managed to sheer off in time.|$|E
5|$|Tall spined {{vertebrae}} {{from the}} Early Cretaceous of England were once {{considered to be}} {{very similar to those}} of Acrocanthosaurus, and in 1988 Gregory S. Paul named them as a second species of the genus, A. altispinax. These bones were originally assigned to Altispinax, an English theropod otherwise known only from teeth, and <b>this</b> <b>assignment</b> led to at least one author proposing that Altispinax itself was a synonym of Acrocanthosaurus. These vertebrae were later assigned to the new genus Becklespinax, separate from both Acrocanthosaurus and Altispinax.|$|E

5|$|The 94th Infantry Division {{then moved}} by {{railroad}} and motor to {{the vicinity of}} Krefeld, Germany, assuming responsibility for containing {{the west side of}} the Ruhr pocket from positions along the Rhine on 3 April. With the reduction of the pocket in mid-April, the 94th Infantry Division was assigned military government duties, first in the Krefeld and later in the Düsseldorf areas. Soldiers of the troop participated in <b>this</b> <b>assignment.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{practical}} {{method was}} {{considered for the}} scene in which Violet Beauregarde turns blue and swells up into a giant 10-foot blueberry. A suit with an air hose was considered at one point for {{the beginnings of the}} swelling scene, before {{the decision was made to}} do the entire transformation in CGI. The visual effects house Cinesite was recruited for <b>this</b> <b>assignment.</b> In some shots of AnnaSophia Robb's head, a facial prosthetic was worn to give the impression that her cheeks had swelled up as well. Because this decision was made late in the film's production, any traces of Violet's blueberry scene were omitted from trailers or promotional material.|$|E
5|$|After three years, on 15 November 1761, Schmitt {{received}} a commission a Fähnrich (ensign) in Infanterie-Regiment Nr. 15 Pallavicini. During his assignment with this regiment, he saw {{service in the}} last years of the Seven Years' War (1765–1763) in the Bohemian theatre. The lack of accurate maps had hampered the conduct of the Seven Years' War and, in 1764, Schmitt was assigned to a project to improve the map-making capacity of the military. The idea of the scientific soldier, or a soldier educated in the specifics of military operations, led to an investment in the training and education of officers. The development of map making, and Carlos Pallavicini was at the forefront of this movement. On 1 February 1769, after proving himself capable in <b>this</b> <b>assignment,</b> he was promoted to Oberleutnant (Lieutenant) and transferred to the reorganized General-Quartermaster staff.|$|E

5|$|Following <b>this</b> <b>assignment,</b> Shoup {{returned}} to the United States and completed his training. He then spent short stints at Marine bases in Quantico, Virginia, Pensacola, Florida, and San Francisco, California. From June 1929 to September 1931 he served with the Marine Detachment aboard , where he coached the boxing and wrestling squads. Following this duty {{he was assigned to}} the Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego. In May 1932 he was ordered to Puget Sound Navy Yard in Bremerton, Washington, where he was promoted to first lieutenant one month later. He served on temporary duty with the Civilian Conservation Corps in Idaho and New Jersey from June 1933 to May 1934, after which he {{returned to}} Bremerton.|$|E
5|$|Huene {{felt the}} {{vertebrae}} of BMNH R3078 had proportions different enough from Cetiosaurus to warrant its own genus. Also, {{the fusion of}} centra with minimal osseous proliferation is manifest in the caudal vertebrae of Cetiosauriscus. The Cetiosaurus specimen OUMNH J13695 has a low horizontal ridge on each of its lateral surfaces, creating a slightly subhexagonal transverse cross-section, and is also seen on Cetiosauriscus, {{as well as the}} anterior caudals of Haplocanthosaurus, and caudals 15 to 30 of Omeisaurus. Also, the area around the periphery of each articular face is flattened, creating a 'bevelled' appearance, and also occurs in Cetiosaurus and Haplocanthosaurus. A whiplash tail was apparently found in the same deposits but it is not certain it belongs to the same individual. Since there is no overlapping material, <b>this</b> <b>assignment</b> to Cetiosauriscus should be treated with caution.|$|E
5|$|In 1814, Egan (now {{bishop of}} Philadelphia) {{promoted}} de Barth {{to the position}} of Vicar General. Egan died shortly thereafter. Until a suitable bishop could be found, Carroll, now Archbishop of Baltimore, appointed de Barth as the apostolic administrator. De Barth tried to refuse <b>this</b> <b>assignment,</b> likely due to the ongoing disputes in Philadelphia between the clergy and the lay trustees of the city's parishes over who should control the churches, but he eventually accepted and took temporary control of the diocese. He spent little time in the city, leaving day-to-day control of the parishes there to Terrence McGill, a local priest.|$|E

5|$|Lindemann's next {{assignment}} (1 October 1922 – 30 September 1924) was {{aboard the}} battleship , {{where he served}} as a watch and division officer. During <b>this</b> <b>assignment,</b> he attended an officers' course at the ships' gunnery school in Kiel between 5 February and 3 May 1924. From here, Lindemann took command of the 1st Artillery Company of the 3rd Coastal Defense Department in Friedrichsort in Kiel from 1 October 1924 – 26 September 1926. His commanding officer was Korvettenkapitän (Lieutenant Commander) Otto Schultze, a former World War I U-boat commander and later Generaladmiral (general admiral) of the Kriegsmarine. In this position, Lindemann was promoted to Kapitänleutnant (captain lieutenant) on 1 January 1925.|$|E
5|$|Overton's first {{assignment}} {{was with the}} 31st Fighter Group at Turner Air Force Base in Albany, Georgia, commanded by David C. Schilling, and flying the F-84 Thunderjet, a fighter-bomber. Shortly after the beginning of <b>this</b> <b>assignment,</b> Overton nearly died in a training incident. On his third flight in the F-84, {{as he tried to}} set a record for completing an obstacle course in the shortest time, he was involved in a major crash. The crash threatened to end his career, but Schilling, determined to prevent Overton from being discharged, gave him extra assignments to keep him in the military.|$|E
5|$|Returning from Tarawa, Radford was reassigned {{as chief}} of staff to Towers, who was Commander, Air Force, Pacific Fleet. He {{assisted}} in planning upcoming operations, including Operation Flintlock, the invasion of the Marshall Islands. He had hoped to return to combat duty at the end of <b>this</b> <b>assignment,</b> but in March 1944 he was ordered to Washington, D.C. and appointed as Deputy Chief of Naval Operations. He assumed this new duty on 1 April, a role which was primarily administrative in nature. His duties included establishing a new integrated system for aircraft maintenance, supply, and retirement, for which he was appointed the head of a board to study aircraft wear and tear. After six months in this duty, Radford was returned to the Pacific theater by Admiral Ernest J. King, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and Commander in Chief, United States Fleet.|$|E

50|$|Before the April 2010 HLA {{nomenclature}} update, new HLA-DPB1 allele {{names were}} assigned within the existing nomenclature system. For example, the allele discovered after HLA-DPB1*9901 was assigned as DPB1*0102, the subsequent allele was named DPB1*0202, then *0302 and so on. <b>This</b> name <b>assignment</b> was decided {{because of the}} complex genetic characteristics of DPB1 alleles compared to alleles of other HLA loci. The majority of the HLA-DPB1 alleles cannot be simply grouped together by their nucleotide sequences. <b>This</b> name <b>assignment</b> {{has been the most}} confusing system within the HLA nomenclature. In the 2010 HLA nomenclature update, all DPB1 alleles, except DPB1*0202 and *0402, discovered after DPB1*9901 were reassigned with new numbers. For example, DPB1*0102 becomes DPB1*100:01and DPB1*0203 becomes DPB1*101:01.|$|R
5|$|Shepard and Slayton put Shepard down {{to command}} the next {{available}} moon mission, which was Apollo 13 in 1970. Under normal circumstances, <b>this</b> <b>assignment</b> {{would have gone to}} Cooper, as the backup commander of Apollo 10, but Cooper was swept aside. A rookie, Stuart Roosa, was designated the Command Module Pilot. Shepard asked for Jim McDivitt as his Lunar Module Pilot, but McDivitt, who had already commanded the Apollo 9 mission, balked at the prospect, arguing that Shepard did not have sufficient Apollo training to command a Moon mission. A rookie, Edgar Mitchell, was designated the Lunar Module Pilot instead.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{discovery}} of the earliest fragmentary remains that will {{come to be known as}} Deinosuchus, it was found that it was a relative of crocodiles, going as far as placing it in the same family (crocodylidae) in 1954, <b>this</b> <b>assignment</b> was mostly supported by dental features but was overturned in 1999 when the finding of new specimens from Texas and Georgia helped place Deinosuchus in a phylogenetic analysis, finding it in a basal position within the clade Alligatoroidea along with Leidyosuchus. This classification was bolstered in 2005 by {{the discovery}} of a well-preserved Deinosuchus brain case from the Blufftown Formation of Alabama, which shows some features reminiscent of those in the modern American alligator, Deinosuchus however, was not a direct ancestor of modern alligators.|$|E
5|$|The 2-satisfiability {{problem is}} to find a truth {{assignment}} to these variables that makes the whole formula true. Such an assignment chooses whether to make each of the variables true or false, so that at least one literal to true in every clause becomes true. For the expression shown above, one possible satisfying assignment is the one that sets all seven of the variables to true. Every clause has at least one non-negated variable, so <b>this</b> <b>assignment</b> satisfies every clause. There are also 15 other ways of setting all the variables so that the formula becomes true. Therefore, the 2-satisfiability instance represented by this expression is satisfiable.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{challenging}} objectives within large undergraduate science courses is highlighting the relevance of course content to real-world applications. However, when students recognize the role of course material in the world around them, it generates both interest and enthusiasm for the topic. This talk will focus on a new “Chemistry Connections Challenge” assignment that was recently introduced into a large second-year organic chemistry course (600 + students) at the University of Toronto, where students were invited to create a PowerPoint slide to share with the class that featured an interesting application of the lecture material. <b>This</b> optional <b>assignment</b> gave students a chance to explore exciting applications of organic chemistry while sharing that knowledge with their peers. The process of developing <b>this</b> new <b>assignment,</b> the workload requirements for instructors/TAs, and select student examples will be discussed. The impact of <b>this</b> unique <b>assignment</b> towards student learning and engagement will also be presented by sharing the data collected from student evaluations. This session will include a short active learning component that will encourage attendees to create a “Connections Challenge” slide in their own field of study to demonstrate the versatility of the assignment across all Science disciplines...|$|R
