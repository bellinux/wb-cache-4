50|$|<b>Teplizumab</b> (also {{known as}} MGA031 and hOKT3γ1(Ala-Ala)) is a humanized {{monoclonal}} antibody {{that is used}} as an immunosuppressive drug. The Fc region of this antibody has been engineered to have Fc receptor non-binding (FNB) properties. <b>Teplizumab</b> was originally developed at Columbia University, and was then further developed at MacroGenics, Inc.|$|E
5000|$|Newer {{monoclonal}} antibodies {{in development}} {{with the same}} mechanism of action include otelixizumab (also known as TRX4), <b>teplizumab</b> (also known as hOKT3γ1(Ala-Ala) [...] ), and visilizumab (with a tentative trade name of Nuvion). They are being investigated {{for the treatment of}} other conditions like Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and type 1 diabetes. Further development of <b>teplizumab</b> is uncertain, due to one-year data from a recent Phase III trial being [...] "disappointing".|$|E
50|$|Anti-CD3 antibodies, {{including}} <b>teplizumab</b> and otelixizumab, {{had suggested}} evidence of preserving insulin production (as evidenced by sustained C-peptide production) in newly diagnosed {{type 1 diabetes}} patients. A probable mechanism of this effect {{was believed to be}} preservation of regulatory T cells that suppress activation of the immune system and thereby maintain immune system homeostasis and tolerance to self-antigens. The duration of the effect is still unknown, however. In 2011, Phase III studies with otelixizumab and <b>teplizumab</b> both failed to show clinical efficacy, potentially due to an insufficient dosing schedule.|$|E

50|$|There are {{numerous}} agents currently under investigation that {{are capable of}} modulating T cells. Currently used agents include anti-thymocyte globulin(ATG) and alemtuzumab, which not only affect T cells, but are also capable of modulating many other aspects of the immune system, often resulting in long-term broad spectrum immune suppression. Antibodies specific for CD3 such as <b>teplizumab</b> and otelixizumab show increased specificity for T cells compared to ATG and alemtuzumab, but are still associated with infection and cytokine release syndrome. Targeting the αβ T cells with TOL101 may reduce these issues through two mechanisms. First, infections are expected to be reduced through the preservation of γδ T cells, which have been shown {{to play an important role}} in controlling viruses such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), often observed in antibody treated patients. Second, reductions in cytokine release are expected when targeting the αβ TCR because, unlike CD3 proteins, the αβ TCR contains none of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMS) required for T cell activation.|$|E
40|$|Type 1 {{diabetes}} (T 1 D) {{results from}} immune-mediated destruction of insulin-producing b-cells. The killing of b-cells is not currently measurable; b-cell functional studies routinely used {{are affected by}} environmental factors such as glucose and cannot distinguish death from dysfunction. Moreover, {{it is not known}} whether im-mune therapies affect killing. We developed an assay to identify b-cell death by measuring relative levels of unmethylated INS DNA in serum and used it to measure b-cell death in a clinical trial of <b>teplizumab.</b> We studied 43 patients with recent-onset T 1 D, 13 nondiabetic subjects, and 37 patients with T 1 D treated with FcR nonbinding anti-CD 3 monoclonal antibody (<b>teplizumab)</b> or placebo. Patients with recent-onset T 1 D had higher rates of b-cell death versus nondiabetic control subjects, but patients with long-standing T 1 D had lower levels.

40|$|Trials of immune therapies in new-onset type 1 {{diabetes}} (T 1 D) {{have shown}} success, but not all subjects respond, and the duration of response is limited. Our aim {{was to determine whether}} two courses of <b>teplizumab,</b> an Fc receptor–nonbinding anti-CD 3 monoclonal antibody, reduces the decline in C-peptide levels in patients with T 1 D 2 years after disease onset. We also set out to identify characteristics of responders. We treated 52 sub-jects with new-onset T 1 D with <b>teplizumab</b> for 2 weeks at diagno-sis and after 1 year in an open-label, randomized, controlled trial. In the intent to treat analysis of the primary end point, patients treated with <b>teplizumab</b> had a reduced decline in C-peptide at 2 years (mean 20. 28 nmol/L [95 % CI 20. 36 to 20. 20]) versus con-trol (mean 20. 46 nmol/L [95 % CI 20. 57 to 20. 35]; P = 0. 002), a 75 % improvement.

40|$|Aims/hypothesis: Type 1 {{diabetes}} {{results from}} a chronic autoimmune process continuing for years after presentation. We tested whether treatment with <b>teplizumab</b> (a Fc receptor non-binding anti-CD 3 monoclonal antibody), after the new-onset period, affects the decline in C-peptide production in individuals with type 1 diabetes. Methods: In a randomised placebo-controlled trial we treated 58 participants with type 1 diabetes for 4 - 12 months with <b>teplizumab</b> or placebo at four academic centres in the USA. A central randomisation centre used computer generated tables to allocate treatments. Investigators, patients, and caregivers were blinded to group assignment. The primary outcome was a comparison of C-peptide responses to a mixed meal after 1 year. We explored modification of treatment effects in subgroups of patients. Results: Thirty-four and 29 subjects were randomized to the drug and placebo treated groups, respectively. Thirty-one and 27, respectively, were analysed. Although the primary outcome analysis showed a 21. 7 % higher C-peptide response in the teplizumab-treated group (0. 45 vs 0. 371; difference, 0. 059 [95 % CI 0. 006, 0. 115] nmol/l) (p = 0. 03), when corrected for baseline imbalances in HbA 1 c levels, the C-peptide levels in the teplizumab-treated group were 17. 7 % higher (0. 44 vs 0. 378; difference, 0. 049 [95 % CI 0, 0. 108] nmol/l, p = 0. 09). A greater proportion of placebo-treated participants lost detectable C-peptide responses at 12 months (p = 0. 03). The <b>teplizumab</b> group required less exogenous insulin (p < 0. 001) but treatment differences in HbA 1 c levels were not observed. <b>Teplizumab</b> was well tolerated. A subgroup analysis showed that treatment benefits were larger in younger individuals and those with HbA 1 c < 6. 5 % at entry. Clinical responders to <b>teplizumab</b> had an increase in circulating CD 8 central memory cells 2 months after enrolment compared with non-responders. Conclusions/interpretations: This study suggests that deterioration in insulin secretion may be affected by immune therapy with <b>teplizumab</b> after the new-onset period but {{the magnitude of the}} effect is less than during the new-onset period. Our studies identify characteristics of patients most likely to respond to this immune therapy.

40|$|Individuals under 20 {{years old}} {{have the highest}} risk of {{developing}} type 1 diabetes because their beta cells are destroyed {{at a faster rate}} than any other age group. Previous studies have looked at delaying and slowing down the rate of beta cell destruction through the use of anti-CD 3 antibody treatments. Specifically, <b>Teplizumab</b> and Otelixizumab drug therapies have been used to treat individuals within 12 weeks of diagnosis. Previous studies done with <b>Teplizumab</b> and Otelixizumab have focused on individuals between 12 and 40 years old; however, there is little research done the effects of these treatments on individuals under 12 years old. Since type 1 diabetes is primarily diagnosed in children the purpose of this proposal is to further the knowledge of the preservation of beta cells in children with the use of <b>Teplizumab</b> and Otelixizumab drugs over 2 years. This study will also focus on the delay of onset type 1 diabetes with the use of <b>Teplizumab</b> in high-risk individuals under 20 years of age. The high-risk individuals will be determined by using genetic screening on individuals with an affected immediate family member. Individuals will also be tested to see if they carry insulin autoantibodies (IAA), protein tyrosine phosphate-related IA- 2 molecule (IA- 2 A), islet cell antibodies (ICA), and glutamic acid decarboxylase (GADA). Individuals that test positive for carrying the DR 3 /DR 4 alleles in the genetic screening and that have two or more autoantibodies present in their immune systems will be selected to participate. The purpose of this proposal is to further understand the impact of anti-CD 3 antibody treatment on young individuals diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and to further understand if treatment in young individuals with anti-CD 3 antibodies can delay or prevent the onset of type 1 diabetes...|$|E
40|$|Protege was a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, parallel, {{placebo-controlled}} 2 -year {{study of}} three intravenous <b>teplizumab</b> dosing regimens, administered daily for 14 days at baseline and again after 26 weeks, in new-onset type 1 diabetes. We {{sought to determine}} efficacy and safety of <b>teplizumab</b> immunotherapy at 2 years and to identify characteristics associated with therapeutic response. Of 516 randomized patients, 513 were treated, and 462 completed 2 years of follow-up. <b>Teplizumab</b> (14 -day full-dose) reduced the loss of C-peptide mean area under the curve (AUC), a prespecified secondary end point, at 2 years versus placebo. In analyses of prespecified and post hoc subsets at entry, U. S. residents, patients with C-peptide mean AUC andgt; 0. 2 nmol/L, those randomized 6 weeks after diagnosis, HbA(1 c) andlt; 7. 5 % (58 mmol/mol), insulin use andlt; 0. 4 units/kg/day, and 8 - 17 years of age each had greater teplizumab-associated C-peptide preservation than their counterparts. Exogenous insulin needs tended to be reduced versus placebo. Antidrug antibodies developed in some patients, without apparent change in drug efficacy. No new safety or tolerability issues were observed during year 2. In summary, anti-CD 3 therapy reduced C-peptide loss 2 years after diagnosis using a tolerable dose.

40|$|Pathogenesis of type 1 {{diabetes}} is multi-faceted, including, autoimmunity, genetics and environment. Autoimmunity directed against pancreatic islet cells results in slowly progressive selective beta-cell destruction ("Primary autoimmune insulitis"), culminating over years in clinically manifested insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). Circulating serum autoantibodies directed against the endocrine cells of the islets of Langerhans (Islet cell autoantibodies - ICAb) are an important hallmark of this disease. Assays for islet cell autoantibodies have facilitated the investigation and understanding of several facets in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diabetes. Their applications have extended into clinical practice and have opened new avenues for early preclinical prediction and preventive prophylaxis in IDDM/type 1 DM. Recently, surprisingly, differences in insulin content between T 1 DM islets, as well as, ′patchy′ or ′lobular′ destruction of islets have been described. These unique pathobiological phenomena, suggest that beta cell destruction {{may not always be}} inexorable and inevitably complete/total, and thus raise hopes for possible therapeutic interruption of beta cell autoimmunity - destruction and cure of {{type 1 diabetes}}. "Recurrent or secondary autoimmune insulitis" refers to the rapid reappearance of islet cell autoantibodies post pancreas transplant, and selective islet beta cell destruction in the grafted pancreas [never forgetting or "anamnestic" beta cell destructive memory], {{in the absence of any}} graft pancreas rejection [monozygotic twin to twin transplantation]. The one definite environmental factor is congenital rubella, because of which a subset of children subsequently develop type 1 diabetes. The putative predisposing factors are viruses, gluten and cow′s milk. The putative protective factors include gut flora, helminths, viral infections, and Vitamin D. Prevention of T 1 DM can include: Primary prevention strategies before the development of autoantibodies and Secondary prevention regimens after autoantibody development. Once islet cell autoantibodies have developed, the goal is to establish a therapeutic regimen to preserve at least 90 % of the beta cells, and prevent the development of hyperglycaemia. The targets for T 1 DM reversal should include autoimmunity, beta cell regeneration and protection of beta cell mass. Anti-CD 3 <b>teplizumab</b> and anti-CD 3 otelixizumab have been shown to provide C-peptide preservation. The unanswered questions in diabetes research include elimination of autoimmune memory responses, reestablishment of immune self-tolerance, and mechanisms of disease initiation...|$|E
