5|$|The {{route to}} Gerlachovský štít {{falls under the}} Tatra National Park ordinance, {{according}} to which hikers who depart from marked trails {{may be subject to}} fines unless they are UIAA members, or are led by an IFMGA-certified mountain guide. Camping is subject to similar restrictions. Rangers and some mountain guides are authorized to collect fines on the spot. Cairns that hikers build to mark the trailhead are periodically <b>taken</b> <b>apart.</b>|$|E
5|$|Early on, many barracks at Birkenau were <b>taken</b> <b>apart</b> by {{civilians who}} used the {{materials}} to rebuild their own homes, levelled out {{in the construction of}} Auschwitz II. The poorest residents sifted the crematoria ashes in search of nuggets from melted gold, before the warning shots were fired. The POW camp for the German prisoners of war was used by the Soviet NKVD until 1947. In the two years, the Soviets dismantled and exported the IG Farben factories to the USSR. Meanwhile, Soviet and Polish investigators worked to document the war crimes of the SS.|$|E
5|$|The second voyage was {{to reduce}} the {{garrison}} and replace HM Sloop Hound, John Burr Commander, with a smaller vessel, namely the 36-ton shallop Penguin, commander Samuel Clayton. She was a collapsible vessel and was no sooner built than <b>taken</b> <b>apart,</b> and the pieces were stowed in Endeavour. Endeavour sailed in November with Hugh Kirkland as the sailing master, and additionally the crew of Penguin, and four ship's carpenters whose job was to reassemble Penguin on arrival, which was 28 January 1773. On 17 April Endeavour and Hound sailed for England with their crew. One of Penguin's crew was Bernard Penrose who wrote an account. Samuel Clayton also wrote an account.|$|E

5|$|The {{skull of}} AMNHFARB6810, the best-preserved skull of Plateosaurus {{that has been}} <b>taken</b> <b>apart</b> during {{preparation}} and is thus available as separate bones, was described anew in 2011. The authors of that publication, palaeontologists Albert Prieto-Márquez and Mark A. Norell, refer the skull to P.erlenbergensis, a species erected in 1905 by Friedrich von Huene. If the P.erlenbergensis holotype is diagnostic (i.e., has enough characters to be distinct from other material), it is the correct name for the material assigned to P.longiceps Jaekel, 1913. However, according to the last detailed study of the holotype material of P.engelhardti by Markus Moser, P.erlenbergensis is a junior synonym of P.engelhardti.|$|E
5|$|Morgan {{collaborated with}} her early mentor and teacher Maybeck on {{plans for an}} eight-story Bavarian Gothic-style castle with two great towers and more minor turrets, some 61 {{bedrooms}} proposed for Wyntoon's largest building project. Hearst instructed Arthur Byne, his art agent based in Madrid, to find likely buildings he could purchase for their stonework, to give Wyntoon an ancient air. In December 1930, Byne discovered Santa Maria de Ovila, a 700-year-old Cistercian monastery, and Hearst paid $97,000 for it. The monastery was <b>taken</b> <b>apart</b> and removed illegally, but the Spanish government was changing hands and was not effective in stopping Hearst's hired men. Some 10,000 stones were shipped to a warehouse in San Francisco at a total cost of about $1million.|$|E
5|$|Raised-relief map: The raised-relief map {{may have}} existed in China since the 3rd century BC, if the {{accounts}} in the Records of the Grand Historian (by Sima Qian, 91 BC) about Qin Shi Huang's (r. 221–210 BC) tomb prove correct (if it is excavated). It {{is known that}} Ma Yuan (14 BC– 49 AD) created a raised-relief map in 32 AD made out of rice, a type of map described in detail during the Tang Dynasty (618–907) by Jiang Fang in his Essay on the Art of Constructing Mountains with Rice (c. 845). Xie Zhuang (421–466) of the Liu Song Dynasty (420–479) created a 0.93 m2 (10ft2) wooden raised-relief map of the empire (showing mountains and rivers) which could be <b>taken</b> <b>apart</b> and pieced together like a giant jigsaw puzzle. Shen Kuo also created his own raised-relief map using sawdust, wood, beeswax, and wheat paste.|$|E

5|$|The {{interior}} set of The Queen Victoria pub was <b>taken</b> <b>apart</b> {{and rebuilt}} exactly to scale on the George Lucas Stage, a fire stage at Elstree Film Studios, for interior scenes, filmed over four days. The interior set took seven weeks {{to build and}} two weeks {{to get into the}} studio. Controlled gas pipes were used to shoot jets of flames and a header was specially built to collapse on Phil. Salisbury had to ensure that the fire for the interior scenes matched that of the already-filmed exterior scenes. Producers decided to extend the 10 September episode featuring Peggy's departure by ten minutes, meaning it would clash with rival soap opera Coronation Street.|$|E
5|$|The {{mathematics}} of topology {{has inspired}} several artists in modern times. The sculptor John Robinson (1935–2007) created {{works such as}} Gordian Knot and Bands of Friendship, displaying knot theory in polished bronze. Other works by Robinson explore the topology of toruses. Genesis is based on Borromean rings – a set of three circles, no two of which link but in which the whole structure cannot be <b>taken</b> <b>apart</b> without breaking. The sculptor Helaman Ferguson creates complex surfaces and other topological objects. His works are visual representations of mathematical objects; The Eightfold Way {{is based on the}} projective special linear group PSL(2,7), a finite group of 168 elements. The sculptor Bathsheba Grossman similarly bases her work on mathematical structures.|$|E
5|$|The {{walls of}} the church were {{completely}} restored in 2003. At {{the same time the}} altar was moved closer to the congregation, making more room for the choir. The baptismal font was relocated from the chapel to the front, opposite the ambo. The tabernacle, which had been where the baptismal font is now, and the crucifixion scene were moved to the chapel, creating a chapel for adoration. The restoration works were directed by Franz Josef Hamm from Limburg. The new cross above the altar was created by a group of young people in preparation for confirmation. During the restoration the organ had to be <b>taken</b> <b>apart.</b> The parish decided not to restore it, but to have a new organ built.|$|E

5|$|Most of the {{population}} of the city was massacred during the sack; Theodosios writes that among the notables alone, over 4,000 were killed. The Arab commander, Abu Ishaq, had the commanding patrikios executed a week later, while the seventy men left with him along with other prisoners were reportedly taken out of the city and beaten to death with stones and clubs. One of the defenders, Niketas of Tarsos, who during the siege had insulted Muhammad daily, was <b>taken</b> <b>apart</b> and tortured to death. Only a few Mardaites from the Peloponnese along with some soldiers of the garrison were able to escape and, reaching Greece, inform admiral Adrianos of the events. The city itself was pillaged and practically destroyed. According to Ibn al-Athir, the Arabs remained there for about two months after the sack, before returning to their base, leaving the city in ruins. Ibn al-Athir also claims that a Byzantine squadron appeared before the city, but that it was driven off after a battle in which the Byzantines lost four ships.|$|E
5|$|Sue Hendrickson, amateur paleontologist, {{discovered}} {{the most complete}} (approximately 85%) and the largest Tyrannosaurus fossil skeleton known in the Hell Creek Formation near Faith, South Dakota, on August 12, 1990. This Tyrannosaurus, nicknamed Sue in her honor, was {{the object of a}} legal battle over its ownership. In 1997 this was settled in favor of Maurice Williams, the original land owner. The fossil collection was purchased by the Field Museum of Natural History at auction for $7.6 million, making it the most expensive dinosaur skeleton to date. From 1998 to 1999 Field Museum of Natural History preparators spent over 25,000 man-hours taking the rock off each of the bones. The bones were then shipped off to New Jersey where the mount was made. The finished mount was then <b>taken</b> <b>apart,</b> and along with the bones, shipped back to Chicago for the final assembly. The mounted skeleton opened to the public on May 17, 2000 in the great hall (Stanley Field Hall) at the Field Museum of Natural History. A study of this specimen's fossilized bones showed that Sue reached full size at age 19 and died at age 28, the longest any tyrannosaur is known to have lived. Early speculation that Sue may have died from a bite {{to the back of the}} head was not confirmed. Though subsequent study showed many pathologies in the skeleton, no bite marks were found. Damage to the back of the skull may have been caused by post-mortem trampling. Recent speculation indicates that Sue may have died of starvation after contracting a parasitic infection from eating diseased meat; the resulting infection would have caused inflammation in the throat, ultimately leading Sue to starve because she could no longer swallow food. This hypothesis is substantiated by smooth-edged holes in her skull which are similar to those caused in modern-day birds that contract the same parasite.|$|E
