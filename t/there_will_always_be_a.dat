25|$|Ricoeur also {{invoked the}} notion of distanciation when {{interpreting}} and understanding others. For Ricoeur, distanciation is two-fold: a) humans always interpret from a distanced position via their physical and experiential proximity to the experiences being discussed (i.e., they were not always there when it happened), and b) <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>always</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> distance between their experiences and their interpreted truths and meaning of those experiences. While imagination enables hermeneutic therapists to understand their clients and empathize with their experiences, <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>always</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> distance between what the therapist imagines and the actual embodied experience of the client. Ironically, it is this concept of distanciation that invokes the therapist's responsibility to make the attempt, to get as close as is possible, because without breaching that surface, truth and meaning are limited in their co-creation. Hermeneutic counseling theory states that a therapist and a client cannot work together to co-create meaning without empathically envisioning and understanding one another.|$|E

25|$|It is from Plato’s {{caution that}} {{in the modern era}} many are aware of {{political}} and ideological issues and the influences of representations. It is impossible to divorce representations from culture and the society that produces them. In the contemporary world there exist restrictions on subject matter, limiting the kinds of representational signs allowed to be employed, as well as boundaries that limit the audience or viewers of particular representations. In motion picture rating systems, M and R rated films are an example of such restrictions, highlighting also society’s attempt to restrict and modify representations to promote a certain set of ideologies and values. Despite these restrictions, representations still have the ability to take on {{a life of their own}} once in the public sphere, and can not be given a definitive or concrete meaning; as <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>always</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> gap between intention and realization, original and copy.|$|E
25|$|Once all {{the cars}} have formed on the grid, a light system above the track {{indicates}} {{the start of the}} race: five red lights are illuminated at intervals of one second; they are all then extinguished simultaneously after an unspecified time (typically less than 3 seconds) to signal the start of the race. The start procedure may be abandoned if a driver stalls on the grid, signalled by raising his arm. If this happens, the procedure restarts: a new formation lap begins with the offending car removed from the grid. The race may also be restarted {{in the event of a}} serious accident or dangerous conditions, with the original start voided. The race may be started from behind the Safety Car if officials feel a racing start would be excessively dangerous, such as extremely heavy rainfall. As of the 2017 season <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>always</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> standing restart.

After the season, speculation mounted regarding whether Feller would retire as a player.

2500|$|What characterizes spinors and distinguishes {{them from}} {{geometric}} vectors and other tensors is subtle. [...] Consider applying a rotation to the coordinates of a system. [...] No {{object in the}} system itself has moved, only the coordinates have, so <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>always</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> compensating change in those coordinate values when applied to any object of the system. [...] Geometrical vectors, for example, have components that will undergo the same rotation as the coordinates. [...] More broadly, any tensor associated with the system (for instance, the stress of some medium) also has coordinate descriptions that adjust to compensate for changes to the coordinate system itself. [...] Spinors do not appear at this level of the description of a physical system, when one is concerned only with the properties of a single isolated rotation of the coordinates. [...] Rather, spinors appear when we imagine that instead of a single rotation, the coordinate system is gradually (continuously) rotated between some initial and final configuration. [...] For any of the familiar and intuitive ("tensorial") quantities associated with the system, the transformation law {{does not depend on}} the precise details of how the coordinates arrived at their final configuration. [...] Spinors, on the other hand, are constructed {{in such a way that}} makes them sensitive to how the gradual rotation of the coordinates arrived there: they exhibit path-dependence. [...] It turns out that, for any final configuration of the coordinates, there are actually two ("topologically") inequivalent gradual (continuous) rotations of the coordinate system that result in this same configuration. [...] This ambiguity is called the homotopy class of the gradual rotation. [...] The belt trick puzzle (shown) famously demonstrates two different rotations, one through an angle of 2π and the other through an angle of 4π, having the same final configurations but different classes. [...] Spinors actually exhibit a sign-reversal that genuinely depends on this homotopy class. [...] This distinguishes them from vectors and other tensors, none of which can feel the class.|$|E
