40|$|In {{industry}} {{different methods}} of surface hardening {{are widely used}} to increase reliability and durability of friction unit parts. Among these methods are areas of focus based on deformcutting technology (DC) i. e. method of chip-free mechanical treatment. It is shown that DC method allows us to produce through- or partial-hardening surface layers of a large thickness (0, 4 … 1. 5 mm) on steel with no additional heat sources. The standard metal-cutting equipment and common tools are used for deform-cutting process. The significant heat generation in the deform-cutting zone and mechanical effect from the tool allow us to heat undercut layers to the phase transformation point to have the hardening structure {{as a result of}} heat removal to the cold balk. The hardening structure formation occurs at significant heating and cooling rate (106 C/c) with large degrees and rates of strain. The deform-cutting modes and working face tool grinding determine the type and properties of the hardening structure. To produce the hardening structure would require the heat transfer and force action augmentation while treatment. These researches deal with through- and partial surface hardening samples produced by turning steel 35 shafts. While <b>through</b> <b>hardening</b> the phase transformation carry among the whole thickness of the undercut layer; while partial hardening the hardening interlayer formed {{on the side of the}} cutting tool contact. The depth of hardening zone of samples with <b>through</b> <b>hardening</b> layers is 0, 5 mm; the depth of hardening zone of partial hardening samples is 0, 8 mm. Micro-hardness of the <b>through</b> <b>hardening</b> layers is 653 HV 0, 1 and 485 HV 0, 1 for the partial hardening layers. The metallographic analysis shows that the hardening zone formed while deform cutting has disperse structure; there are ferrite ghosts in it. The tempering at temperatures of 200 – 700 C showed that the micro-hardness of the hardening structures formed while deform cutting is larger than the micro-hardness of the samples after quenching. There special structures formed while deform cutting demand more in-depth study using different methods of physical-chemical analysis and mechanical testing. </p...|$|R

5|$|The main {{disadvantage}} to {{die casting}} {{is the very}} high capital cost. Both the casting equipment required and the dies and related components are very costly, as compared to most other casting processes. Therefore, to make die casting an economic process, a large production volume is needed. Other disadvantages are that the process is limited to high-fluidity metals, and casting weights must be between 30grams (1oz) and 10kg (20lb). In the standard die casting process the final casting will have {{a small amount of}} porosity. This prevents any heat treating or welding, because the heat causes the gas in the pores to expand, which causes micro-cracks inside the part and exfoliation of the surface. Thus a related disadvantage of die casting is that it is only for parts in which softness is acceptable.

40|$|Metakaolin (MK), a {{calcined}} clay, {{was included}} as a partial cement replacement material, at up to 20 % by weight of binder, in cement pastes and concrete, and its influence on the resistance to chloride ingress investigated. Reductions in effective chloride diffusion coefficients <b>through</b> <b>hardened</b> cement paste were obtained for binary blends and by combining OPC, MK and a second cement replacement material of pulverised fuel ash or ground granulated blast furnace slag. Steady state oxygen diffusion measurements <b>through</b> <b>hardened</b> cement pastes measured using an electrochemical cell showed that the interaction between charged species and the pore surfaces {{is a major factor}} in determining chloride diffusion rate. Rheology of the binder, particularly at high MK replacement levels, was found to have a dramatic influence on the diffusion performance of cement pastes. It was concluded that plasticising admixtures are essential for adequate dispersion of MK in cement pastes. Chloride concentration profile analysis of the concrete cylinders, exposed to sodium chloride solution for one year, was employed to obtain apparent chloride diffusion coefficients for concrete specimens. MK was found to reduce the depth of chloride penetration into concrete when compared with that of unblended mixes. Corrosion rate and corrosion potential measurements were taken on steel bars embedded in concrete exposed to a saline environment under conditions of cyclic wetting and drying. The initiation time for corrosion was found to be significantly longer for MK blended mixes than for plain OPC systems. The aggregate-paste interfacial zone of MK blended systems was investigated by steady state diffusion of chloride ions through mortar containing glass beads as model aggregate. For the model aggregate specimens tested the work confirmed the hypothesis that properties of the bulk paste are the controlling factors in ionic diffusion through mortar...|$|E
