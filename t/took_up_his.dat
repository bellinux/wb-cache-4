5|$|He was an {{accomplished}} athlete and helped his hometown club Grane SK to two Norwegian 4 × 1500 metres relay records. The records {{were set in}} 1921 and 1923, but broken by the team IL i BUL in 1926. His brother John, a bronze medalist in 1500 metres at the 1917 Norwegian championships, was on the relay team as well.

5|$|Sir Robert Menzies, the Australian politician, {{became the}} Lord Warden in 1965 and visited the castle {{on an annual}} basis, staying in the flat there. Elizabeth the Queen Mother {{followed}} Menzies in 1978, initially visiting the castle from the Royal Yacht, but from 1986 onwards taking over the entire castle for three days each July. This required moving furniture, silverware and other furnishings from London and caused difficulties for English Heritage, who managed the property.

At the August 1997 Road Wild event, Rodman appeared as the Impostor Sting hitting Luger with a baseball bat to help Hogan win the WCW World Heavyweight Championship.|$|E
5|$|Back in Australia, Minifie <b>took</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> scholarship, {{studying}} {{mathematics and}} science at the University of Melbourne. However, he soon withdrew from the course, opting to join his father's flour milling business, James Minifie & Co. Pty Ltd. In a ceremony at the Holy Trinity Church in Kew on 19 October 1921, Minifie married Nellie Frances Roberts; the couple would have four children. His father died the next year and, in collaboration with his brother James and his father's business partner, James Gatehouse, he continued to manage and run James Minifie & Co. Pty Ltd. Over the subsequent three decades, the trio were successful in furthering their business ventures, significantly expanding the company.|$|E
5|$|In 1954, {{after nine}} years in his senior {{position}} at Triplex, and 27 years at the company, Horne accepted the position of {{managing director of the}} British Industries Fair, a government-backed organisation promoting British goods worldwide; he <b>took</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> position in July 1955. Much of the work involved liaising with foreign buyers and delegations, and he accompanied the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh on visits to the annual fair. In 1956 the government withdrew its funding and the BIF closed. Horne received several attractive job offers, and chose the post of chairman and managing director of the toy manufacturers Chad Valley, where he was a success. In September that year he and Murdoch appeared in a one-off television programme Show for the Telly.|$|E

5|$|Jackson {{subsequently}} {{joined the}} Australian Army in March 1937 {{as a regular}} officer in the PMF. His older brother, Donald, was also a professional soldier, having entered the Royal Military College, Duntroon in 1934 and later also reached the rank of brigadier. After completing his own training at Duntroon, Jackson graduated into the infantry as a lieutenant in December 1939, following {{the outbreak of the}} Second World War two months earlier. Transferring to the 2nd AIF for overseas service, in July 1940 he <b>took</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> first appointment commanding a platoon in the 2/25th Battalion where he saw action in the Middle East in North Africa and Syria.|$|E
5|$|Kinkaid hoped {{his next}} {{assignment}} {{would be that}} of naval attaché to London, but that job went to Captain Alan G. Kirk. Kinkaid was offered and accepted the post in Rome instead. He <b>took</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> posting there in November 1938. In 1939, he was also accredited with the American embassy in Belgrade. Kinkaid reported that Italy was unprepared for war. Only in May 1940 did he warn that Italy was mobilizing. Soon after, he learned from Count Galeazzo Ciano that Italy would declare war on France and Britain between 10 and 15 June 1940. He provided accurate reports on the damage inflicted by the British in the Battle of Taranto. He returned to the U.S. in March 1941.|$|E
5|$|Lord Caldecote {{was forced}} to leave his {{position}} after only 8 months due to the fall of Neville Chamberlain's government, of which he was a part. He was replaced by Lord Simon, who <b>took</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> position on 12 May 1940. Simon frequently delegated to Schuster and accepted his advice on judicial appointments, such as that of Arthur Thompson Denning to the High Court in 1944. Schuster also had influence in committee appointments; when Simon was asked to select a chairman for the Committee on Reconstruction Priorities he delegated to Schuster, who chose Sir Walter Monckton.|$|E

5|$|On {{returning}} from his unsuccessful mission to Japan, Nuyts <b>took</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> {{position as the}} third Governor of Formosa, with his residence in Fort Zeelandia in Tayouan (modern-day Anping). One of his early aims was to force an opening for the Dutch to trade in China — something which had eluded them since they arrived in East Asia in the early 17th century. To further this goal, he took the Chinese trade negotiator Zheng Zhilong hostage and refused to release him until he agreed to give the Dutch trading privileges. More than thirty years later {{it was to be}} Zheng's son Koxinga who ended the reign of the Dutch on Formosa.|$|E
5|$|Rǫgnvaldr Guðrøðarson and {{his younger}} half-brother, Óláfr Guðrøðarson (died 1237), warred over the dynasty's island-kingdom in the early thirteenth century, until the former was slain battling Óláfr in 1229. Rǫgnvaldr Guðrøðarson's {{aforesaid}} son, Guðrøðr Rǫgnvaldsson, <b>took</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> father's claim to the throne, and at his height co-ruled the kingdom with Óláfr in 1231. Guðrøðr Rǫgnvaldsson was slain in 1231, however, and Óláfr ruled the entire island-kingdom peacefully afterwards until his own death in 1237. Óláfr was succeeded by his son, Haraldr Óláfsson, King of Mann and the Isles, who later travelled to Norway and married a daughter of Hákon, but lost his life at sea on his return voyage in 1248.|$|E
5|$|Shostakovich's musical {{influence}} on later composers outside the former Soviet Union {{has been relatively}} slight, although Alfred Schnittke <b>took</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> eclecticism and his contrasts between the dynamic and the static, and some of André Previn's music shows clear links to Shostakovich's style of orchestration. His influence {{can also be seen}} in some Nordic composers, such as Lars-Erik Larsson. Many of his Russian contemporaries, and his pupils at the Leningrad Conservatory were strongly influenced by his style (including German Okunev, Boris Tishchenko, whose 5th Symphony of 1978 is dedicated to Shostakovich's memory, Sergei Slonimsky, and others). Shostakovich's conservative idiom has grown increasingly popular with audiences both within and beyond Russia, as the avant-garde has declined in influence and debate about his political views has developed.|$|E

5|$|After the executions, Hancock was {{assigned}} {{command of the}} newly organized Middle Military Department, headquartered in Baltimore. In 1866, on Grant's recommendation, Hancock was promoted to major general and was transferred, later that year, to command of the military Department of the Missouri, which included the states of Missouri, Kansas, Colorado, and New Mexico. Hancock reported to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, and <b>took</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> new posting. Soon after arriving, he {{was assigned}} by General Sherman to lead an expedition {{to negotiate with the}} Cheyenne and Sioux, with whom relations had worsened since the Sand Creek massacre. The negotiations got off to a bad start, and after Hancock ordered the burning of an abandoned Cheyenne village in central Kansas, relations became worse than when the expedition had started. There was little loss of life on either side, but the mission could not be called a success.|$|E
5|$|Chadwick held honorary {{degrees from}} the {{universities}} of Glasgow, Uppsala, Yale, Leeds, Manchester, Surrey, Chicago, Harvard, Jena and the Augustinian University of Rome. He was made an honorary fellow of Queens' College, Cambridge, in 1958, just before he <b>took</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> Oxford Chair; and of Magdalene College, Cambridge, in 1962. He also treasured a stole {{given to him by}} Pope John Paul II in 1982, and this was placed on his coffin during his funeral at Christ Church on 25 June 2008. Two Festschriften were made in his honour, one for his contributions to the study of church history (Christian Authority, ed. Gillian Evans, 1988), the other for his ecumenical work (The Making of Orthodoxy, ed. Rowan Williams, 1989). In addition to his work on ARCIC he was involved in similar conversations with the Eastern Orthodox Churches. In 1974 Ladbrokes had Chadwick at odds of 7–1 for appointment as the next Archbishop of Canterbury; his brother Owen was at 6–1. In 1984 The Times reported that both brothers were reputed to have turned down more than one bishopric.|$|E
5|$|In 1930, Hart {{applied for}} and was {{appointed}} to the position of Administrator of Western Samoa, which was controlled by New Zealand under a mandate from the League of Nations. This was a difficult period for the colony as many of its citizens wanted independence. The Mau movement in particular was agitating for self-determination and employed tactics of civil disobedience as a means of opposing the New Zealand administration. After some heavy-handed management of protestors by his predecessor had resulted in several deaths amongst the movement, Hart made progress in improving relationships with the Mau when he <b>took</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> position in 1931. He also returned some financial stability to the colony which had struggled during the Great Depression. Hart was knighted as a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire for his services in Samoa shortly before completing his term as administrator and returning to New Zealand in July 1935.|$|E
