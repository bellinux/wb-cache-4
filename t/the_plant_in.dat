5|$|Linnaeus {{used the}} Latin name for <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>in</b> {{formally}} describing the genus, although Matthias de l'Obel had previously used the name in describing various species of Narcissi in his Icones stirpium of 1591, and other publications, as had Clusius in Rariorum stirpium (1576).|$|E
5|$|These were {{received}} at <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>in</b> large quantities from wholesalers, and in smaller quantities from the corporation's own network of warehouses that spanned the United States and Canada. These enabled material to be graded and pre-sorted locally before refining at the plant.|$|E
5|$|Adiantum viridimontanum largely reproduces asexually by {{branching}} {{rather than}} sexually through spores. While wind-blown spores {{can result in}} sexual reproduction for the species, most spores probably fall within a relatively short radius of <b>the</b> <b>plant.</b> <b>In</b> addition, reproduction through spore dispersal requires the spore to land in suitable conditions for generating a gametophyte, typically in bright sunlight on thin serpentine soils. These requirements allow A.viridimontanum to colonize recently disturbed sites on ultramafic outcrops, where bedrock has been exposed and competing plants have been removed. The populations appear stable, with the long life of individuals compensating for low recruitment rates.|$|E

5|$|Alex George {{described}} <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>in</b> his 1981 monograph of {{the genus}} Banksia as a variety of Banksia integrifolia, but later reclassified it as a separate species. Genetic studies show it {{to be related to}} Banksia plagiocarpa, Banksia oblongifolia and Banksia robur. The species is found in wet sclerophyll forest and rainforest margins on sandy soils. Banksia aquilonia regenerates after bushfire by regrowing from epicormic buds under its bark. It is rarely cultivated.|$|E
5|$|His {{research}} on plant evolution also progressed during this period; {{he worked on}} the genetics of forage grasses, looking at polyploidy and the evolution of the Poaceae and publishing numerous papers on the subject though the 1940s. He produced an artificial autotetraploid grass from the diploid species Ehrharta erecta through treatment with the chromosome doubling agent colchicine. He was able to establish <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>in</b> the field, and after 39 years of field trials was able to show that the autopolyploid was not as successful as its diploid parent in an unchanging environment.|$|E
5|$|Insects are a {{major factor}} in the low yields of African cowpea crops, and they affect each tissue {{component}} and developmental stage of <b>the</b> <b>plant.</b> <b>In</b> bad infestations insect pressure is responsible for over 90% loss in yield. The legume pod borer, Maruca vitrata, is the main pre-harvest pest of the cowpea. Other important pests include pod sucking bugs, thrips and the post-harvest cowpea weevil, Callosobruchus maculatus.|$|E

5|$|Marysville's economy {{historically}} {{relied on}} lumber production and agriculture, including {{the cultivation of}} strawberries, hay and oats. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, Marysville was not adversely impacted unlike other cities in the county and country because of its diverse industries, including sawmills, grain mills, a tannery, a fertilizer plant, and a berry packing plant. The city's largest employer in the early 1950s, the Weiser Lumber Company, was destroyed in a fire on May 6, 1955, causing $300,000 in damage. The lumber mill at the site was later acquired by Welco Lumber, who closed <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>in</b> 2007.|$|E
5|$|Not all co-evolved {{interactions}} between species involve conflict. Many cases of mutually beneficial interactions have evolved. For instance, an extreme cooperation exists between {{plants and the}} mycorrhizal fungi that grow on their roots and aid <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>in</b> absorbing nutrients from the soil. This is a reciprocal relationship as the plants provide the fungi with sugars from photosynthesis. Here, the fungi actually grow inside plant cells, allowing them to exchange nutrients with their hosts, while sending signals that suppress the plant immune system.|$|E
5|$|Persoonia levis {{is rarely}} seen in cultivation, {{mainly because of}} {{difficulties}} in propagation; seed germination is unpredictable, and cuttings have been nearly impossible to strike. Nevertheless, its colourful bark and leaves are attractive horticultural features. Well-drained sandy soils in sun or part shade are needed for <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>in</b> a garden situation. Once established, it tolerates moderate frosts and dry spells and grows fairly readily, albeit slowly, in suitable conditions. Plantsmen in England germinated seed as early as 1795.|$|E

5|$|All {{members of}} Cicuta except C.bulbifera contain {{high levels of}} the {{poisonous}} principle cicutoxin, an unsaturated aliphatic alcohol that is structurally {{closely related to the}} toxin oenanthotoxin found in the plant hemlock water dropwort. Cicutoxin is present at all stages of growth and {{in all parts of the}} plant, but is most concentrated in the roots which appear to be the most toxic in the early spring. Its primary toxic effect is to act as a stimulant in the central nervous system. It is a non-competitive gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor antagonist. Cicutoxin acts on the GABAA receptor causing a block of the chloride channel which results in neuronal depolarization. In the presence of cicutoxin this depolarization continues unabated causing cell overactivity. The hyperactivity in brain cells results in seizures. Cicutoxin is highly poisonous and water hemlock is considered one of North America's most toxic plants. Ingestion of Cicuta can be fatal in humans and there are reports in the medical literature of severe poisoning and death as early as 1670. A number of people have also died following ingestion of <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>in</b> the 20th and 21st century.|$|E
5|$|American {{officials}} later {{acknowledged that}} the evidence cited by the U.S. in its rationale for the Al-Shifa strike was weaker than initially believed: The facility had not been involved in chemical weapons production, and was not connected to bin Laden. The $30 million Al-Shifa factory, which had a $199,000 contract with the UN under the Oil-for-Food Programme, employed 300 Sudanese and provided {{over half of the}} country's pharmaceuticals, including medicines for malaria, diabetes, gonorrhea, and tuberculosis. A Sudanese named Salah Idris purchased <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>in</b> March 1998; while the CIA later said it found financial ties between Idris and the bin Laden-linked terrorist group Egyptian Islamic Jihad, the agency had been unaware at the time that Idris owned the Al-Shifa facility. Idris later denied any links to bin Laden and sued to recover $24 million in funds frozen by the U.S., {{as well as for the}} damage to his factory. Idris hired investigations firm Kroll Inc., which reported in February 1999 that neither Idris nor Al-Shifa was connected to terrorism.|$|E

5|$|Eriophorum angustifolium is a hardy, herbaceous, rhizomatous, {{perennial}} sedge, able {{to endure}} {{in a variety}} of environments in the temperate, subarctic and arctic regions of Earth. Unlike Gossypium, the genus from which cotton is derived, the bristles which grow on E.angustifolium are unsuited to textile manufacturing. Nevertheless, in Northern Europe, they were used as a substitute in the production of paper, pillows, candle-wicks, and wound-dressings. The indigenous peoples of North America use <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>in</b> cooking and in the treatment of digestive problems. Following a vote in 2002, Plantlife International designated E.angustifolium the County Flower of Greater Manchester, as part of its British County Flowers campaign.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, Frederick V. Coville called {{attention}} to the threatened state of <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>in</b> an article in Science. While investigating the species for horticultural purposes, he only found two herbarium specimens, those of Baird and Canby. (Coville apparently did not locate Kinn's West Virginia specimen, preserved at the Muhlenberg Herbarium.) Upon examination of the New Bloomfield site in 1918, he discovered the entire colony, except for one patch cut off by cultivation, was connected by roots, and that no seedlings were in evidence anywhere around the margins of the colony. Coville concluded that the plant was self-sterile and reproduced by extending rootstocks. After commercial nurserymen removed a truckload of box huckleberry from the New Bloomfield site in 1918, Coville was particularly anxious to preserve the species, as the New Bloomfield site was the only one then thought extant. (It was protected by the state from 1929, becoming the Hoverter and Sholl Box Huckleberry Natural Area.) However, Edgar T. Wherry was able to locate the Delaware colony, thought lost, in 1919, and send specimens for cross-pollination with specimens from the Pennsylvania colony.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius alnicola is an ectomycorrhizal species, and {{engages in}} a mutualistic {{association}} with certain plant species. In this association, the hyphae of the fungus permeate {{large volumes of}} soil and obtain scarce elements, especially phosphorus—which is often limiting for plant growth—which they pass on to <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>in</b> exchange for metabolic products of the plant's photosynthesis. The ectomycorrhizae that the fungus forms in association with Picea engelmannii {{have been shown to}} contain lactifers (latex-producing cells) and pigments similar to the fruit body. Fruit bodies of the fungus grow in groups on the ground under alders and conifers, usually appearing between July and October. It is a fairly common species in the western United States and Baja California. Additional collection locations in Mexico include Veracruz, Villarreal, and Tapia. A population in central and southern California is known to associate with oak trees. In the Rocky Mountains it is associated with the subalpine tree species Englemann Spruce (Picea engelmannii), while at lower elevations it is commonly found with white spruce (Picea glauca). It is also known to associate with Ponderosa Pine (Pinus ponderosa) and Douglas-fir (genus Pseudotsuga). The mushroom has also been collected from Bageshwar, in the state of Uttarakhand, India.|$|E

5|$|Leaving Rotblat {{in charge}} in Liverpool, Chadwick began {{a tour of}} the Manhattan Project {{facilities}} in November 1943, except for the Hanford Site where plutonium was produced, which he was not allowed to see. He became the only man apart from Groves and his second in command to have access to all the American research and production facilities for the uranium bomb. Observing the work on the K-25 gaseous diffusion facility at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, Chadwick realised how wrong he had been about building <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>in</b> wartime Britain. The enormous structure could never have been concealed from the Luftwaffe. In early 1944, he moved to Los Alamos, New Mexico, with his wife and their twins, who now spoke with Canadian accents. For security reasons, he was given the cover name of James Chaffee.|$|E
5|$|RNA {{interference}} is a {{vital part}} of the immune response to viruses and other foreign genetic material, especially in plants where it may also prevent the self-propagation of transposons. Plants such as Arabidopsis thaliana express multiple dicer homologs that are specialized to react differently when the plant is exposed to different viruses. Even before the RNAi pathway was fully understood, it was known that induced gene silencing in plants could spread throughout <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>in</b> a systemic effect and could be transferred from stock to scion plants via grafting. This phenomenon has since been recognized as a feature of the plant adaptive immune system and allows the entire plant to respond to a virus after an initial localized encounter. In response, many plant viruses have evolved elaborate mechanisms to suppress the RNAi response. These include viral proteins that bind short double-stranded RNA fragments with single-stranded overhang ends, such as those produced by dicer. Some plant genomes also express endogenous siRNAs in response to infection by specific types of bacteria. These effects may be part of a generalized response to pathogens that downregulates any metabolic process in the host that aids the infection process.|$|E
