5|$|Jonny Santos, who is {{best known}} as the vocalist and {{songwriter}} for the Grammy Award nominated industrial metal group Spineshank was displeased with the direction the band was going in and felt it had 'run its course'. Santos felt it was <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> on and left Spineshank, although he was unsure what direction he wanted with his music career. He would play with local bands and friends, while performing production and engineering duties in studios to 'pay the bills'. However, after leaving Spineshank, Santos lost everything and was basically homeless, 'couch surfing' from friend’s house to friend’s house.|$|E
5|$|Bringing {{dead and}} seriously wounded {{down from the}} top was {{difficult}} for both sides. UN litter-bearing teams of six men had to carry each wounded man on a stretcher down the mountain. A medical aide was also needed to administer care during the trip if the man was critically wounded, and riflemen often accompanied the groups to protect them from North Korean snipers along the trail. Critically wounded men often died before reaching the bottom where full medical care could be administered. This possibility was one of the factors that lowered morale in the 24th Infantry units fighting on Battle Mountain. Many men were afraid that if they were wounded there they would die before reaching adequate medical care. North Korean troops often did not have <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> dead and wounded from the peak at all, forcing both sides to bury casualties in shallow graves along the peak.|$|E
5|$|Data {{is visiting}} D'Sora, but she seems unhappy {{and he is}} acting erratically {{in order to find}} an {{appropriate}} response to make her happy. It becomes evident to the crew that the nebula is causing distortions in space; Picard orders the ship into warp to leave the nebula as quickly as possible but this speeds up the distortions. Whilst investigating them, Lieutenant Van Mayter (Georgina Shore) is killed when a distortion embeds her into the deck. Data discovers that dark matter is causing the distortions. The ship can detect the pockets at short range, but not in enough <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> out of the way. Worf proposes using a shuttle to lead the Enterprise out, and Picard insists on piloting it alone.|$|E

5000|$|This {{approach}} promotes {{that members}} of the EPG and PATs be trained in the CMMI, that an informal (SCAMPI C) appraisal be performed, and that process areas be prioritized for improvement. More modern approaches, that involve the deployment of commercially available, CMMI-compliant processes, can significantly reduce the <b>time</b> <b>to</b> achieve compliance. SEI has maintained statistics on the [...] "time <b>to</b> <b>move</b> up" [...] for organizations adopting the earlier Software CMM as well as CMMI. These statistics indicate that, since 1987, the median <b>times</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> from Level 1 to Level 2 is 23 months, and from Level 2 to Level 3 is an additional 20 months. Since the release of the CMMI, the median <b>times</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> from Level 1 to Level 2 is 5 months, with median movement to Level 3 another 21 months. These statistics are updated and published every six months in a maturity profile.|$|R
5|$|London finance {{industry}} {{is based in}} the City of London and Canary Wharf, the two major Central Business Districts in London. London {{is one of the}} pre-eminent financial centres of the world as the most important location for international finance. London took over as a major financial centre shortly after 1795 when the Dutch Republic collapsed before the Napoleonic armies. For many bankers established in Amsterdam (e.g. Hope, Baring), this was only <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> to London. The London financial elite was strengthened by a strong Jewish community from all over Europe capable of mastering the most sophisticated financial tools of the time. This unique concentration of talents accelerated the transition from the Commercial Revolution to the Industrial Revolution. By the end of the 19th century, Britain was the wealthiest of all nations, and London a leading financial centre. Still, as of 2016 London tops the world rankings on both the Global Financial Centres Index (GFCI) and The Global Cities Index.|$|E
5|$|The British {{garrison}} at Diego Garcia {{had not yet}} {{learned of}} the state of war between Britain and Germany, and so treated Emden to a warm reception. She remained there until 10 October, during which time her bottom was cleaned of fouling. She then resumed searching for merchant ships in the area west of Colombo. While operating there, Emden picked up Hampshires wireless signals again, and so departed for the Chagos Archipelago on 13 October. Meanwhile, the British had captured Markomannia on 12 October, depriving Emden of one of her colliers. On 15 October, Emden captured a British steamer off Minikoi and sank her the next day. Over the next five days, she captured five more vessels; one was used as a collier, three were sunk, and the fifth was sent to port with the crews of the other vessels. On 20 October, Müller decided it was <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> to a new area of operations.|$|E
5|$|The rise of African {{nationalism}} {{generated a}} white backlash in Southern Rhodesia, with the right-wing Rhodesian Front winning the December 1962 general election. The new government sought to preserve white minority rule by tightening security and establishing full {{independence from the}} United Kingdom. Mugabe met with colleagues at his house in Salisbury's Highbury district, where he argued that as political demonstrations were simply being banned, it was <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> towards armed resistance. Both he and others rejected Nkomo's proposal that they establish a government-in-exile in Dar es Salaam. He and Hayfron skipped bail to attend a ZAPU meeting in the Tanganyikan city. There, the party leadership met Tanganyika's President, Julius Nyerere, who also dismissed {{the idea of a}} government-in-exile and urged ZAPU to organise their resistance to white minority rule within Southern Rhodesia itself.|$|E

5|$|There are {{different}} types of starts for races of different distances. Middle- and long-distance races mainly use the waterfall start. This is when all athletes begin on a curved line that moves farther out at {{the outer edge of}} the track. Competitors are allowed to move towards the inside lane right away, as long as it is safe to do so. For some middle-distance races, such as 800m, each athlete starts in their own lane. Once the gun fires, they must run in the lane they began in until markers on the track notify them it is <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> towards the inside lane. For sprint races, athletes begin in start blocks and must stay in their own lane for the entire race.|$|E
5|$|As {{they had}} been {{compromised}} by the first lap pileup and were {{at the back of}} the field, Dillmann and Coletti chose to make their mandatory pit stops when the window opened at the end of the seventh lap for rear soft compound tyres. Haryanto and Abt made their stops on the next lap and Calado and Lancaster did the same on lap nine. Coletti's early pit stop resulted in him lapping faster than any other driver by two seconds. Other drivers became aware of the significance and Nasr went into the pit lane to keep his position from Calado and Ceccon and Richelmi did the same on the eleventh lap. This placed pressure on race leader Evans who was at this point three seconds a lap slower than Ceccon. Evans made his own pit stop on lap 12 for four soft compound tyres but did not retain first place as Ceccon made up enough <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> in front of him. Evans could not keep close to Ceccon and was three seconds behind the driver after one lap and his diminishing pace hurt the delayed Bird who became the leader when Evans made his pit stop. On lap 15, De Jong made a problematic pit stop: his rear jack failed which delayed him and then crossed the yellow line at the pit lane exit twice, earning him a drive-through penalty.|$|E
5|$|The 2nd New Zealand Division {{had moved}} into the front line in November in order to relieve the 8th Indian Division and would {{take part in the}} advance across the Sangro planned {{for the end of the}} month. The brigade {{subsequently}} occupied positions around Atessa, with the Māori Battalion in brigade reserve, occupying a series of low hills which formed the Sangro river valley. The Eighth Army's forward units had reached the Sangro in early November and General Harold Alexander—commander of the 15th Army Group—had planned for Lieutenant General Bernard Montgomery to strike across the river on its coastal plain on 20 November with V Corps. Montgomery shifted the 8th Indian Division to the right in secret to narrow the V Corps front and concentrate its power, bringing the newly arrived 2nd New Zealand Division into the gap. Heavy rain flooded the river, forcing the postponement of the offensive and giving the Germans <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> in reinforcements. In the early hours of 28 November the Eighth Army attack began, supported by heavy artillery concentrations. The New Zealanders advanced steadily, capturing the bulk of their objectives. The Māori Battalion, still in brigade reserve, stood to during the attack but was not required.|$|E

50|$|The {{other two}} less {{commonly}} referenced seek measurements are track-to-track and full stroke. The track-to-track measurement is the <b>time</b> required <b>to</b> <b>move</b> from one track to an adjacent track. This {{is the shortest}} (fastest) possible seek time. In HDDs this is typically between 0.2 and 0.8 ms. The full stroke measurement is the <b>time</b> required <b>to</b> <b>move</b> from the outermost track to the innermost track. This is the longest (slowest) possible seek time.|$|R

25|$|The {{last two}} metrics appear {{for example in}} routing a machine that drills a given set of holes in a printed circuit board.

The maximum metric corresponds to a machine that adjusts both co-ordinates simultaneously, so the <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> to a new point is the slower of the two movements.|$|E

40|$|We {{performed}} {{several experiments}} using a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) as {{an input device}} in the nondominant hand along with a mouse in the dominant hand. A PDA is a small hand-held palm-size computer like a 3 Com Palm Pilot or a Windows CE device. These are becoming widely available and are easily connected to a PC. Results of our experiments indicate that people can accurately and quickly select among a small numbers of buttons on the PDA using the left hand without looking, and that, as predicted, performance does decrease {{as the number of}} buttons increases. Homing <b>times</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> both hands between the keyboard and devices are only about 10 % to 15 % slower than <b>times</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> a single hand to the mouse, suggesting that acquiring two devices does not cause a large penalty.
