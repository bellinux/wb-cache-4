5|$|Johan Huizinga (1872–1945) {{acknowledged}} {{the existence of}} <b>the</b> <b>Renaissance</b> but questioned {{whether it was a}} positive change. In his book The Waning of the Middle Ages, he argued that <b>the</b> <b>Renaissance</b> was a period of decline from the High Middle Ages, destroying much that was important. The Latin language, for instance, had evolved greatly from the classical period and was still a living language used in the church and elsewhere. <b>The</b> <b>Renaissance</b> obsession with classical purity halted its further evolution and saw Latin revert to its classical form. Robert S. Lopez has contended that it was a period of deep economic recession. Meanwhile, George Sarton and Lynn Thorndike have both argued that scientific progress was perhaps less original than has traditionally been supposed. Finally, Joan Kelly argued that <b>the</b> <b>Renaissance</b> led to greater gender dichotomy, lessening the agency women had had during the Middle Ages.|$|E
5|$|Many {{argue that}} the ideas characterizing <b>the</b> <b>Renaissance</b> had their origin in late 13th-century Florence, in {{particular}} with the writings of Dante Alighieri (1265–1321) and Petrarch (1304–1374), {{as well as the}} paintings of Giotto di Bondone (1267–1337). Some writers date <b>the</b> <b>Renaissance</b> quite precisely; one proposed starting point is 1401, when the rival geniuses Lorenzo Ghiberti and Filippo Brunelleschi competed for the contract to build the bronze doors for the Baptistery of the Florence Cathedral (Ghiberti won). Others see more general competition between artists and polymaths such as Brunelleschi, Ghiberti, Donatello, and Masaccio for artistic commissions as sparking the creativity of <b>the</b> <b>Renaissance.</b> Yet it remains much debated why <b>the</b> <b>Renaissance</b> began in Italy, and why it began when it did. Accordingly, several theories have been put forward to explain its origins.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> English <b>Renaissance</b> is {{different}} from <b>the</b> Italian <b>Renaissance</b> in several ways. The dominant art forms of <b>the</b> English <b>Renaissance</b> were literature and music. Visual arts in <b>the</b> English <b>Renaissance</b> were much less significant than in <b>the</b> Italian <b>Renaissance.</b> <b>The</b> English period began far later than the Italian, which was moving into Mannerism and the Baroque by the 1550s or earlier. In contrast, <b>the</b> English <b>Renaissance</b> can only truly be said to begin, shakily, in the 1520s, and it continued until perhaps 1620.|$|R

5|$|The Swiss {{historian}} Jacob Burckhardt (1818–1897) in his The Civilization of <b>the</b> <b>Renaissance</b> in Italy (1860), by contrast, defined <b>the</b> <b>Renaissance</b> as {{the period}} between Giotto and Michelangelo in Italy, that is, the 14th to mid-16th centuries. He saw in <b>the</b> <b>Renaissance</b> {{the emergence of the}} modern spirit of individuality, which the Middle Ages had stifled. His book was widely read and became influential {{in the development of the}} modern interpretation of the Italian Renaissance. However, Buckhardt has been accused of setting forth a linear Whiggish view of history in seeing <b>the</b> <b>Renaissance</b> as the origin of the modern world.|$|E

25|$|Painting {{was one of}} {{the more}} {{distinguishing}} factors of <b>the</b> Portuguese <b>Renaissance,</b> being one of the more contrasting arts to <b>the</b> other <b>Renaissances</b> of Europe. Painting in <b>the</b> Portuguese <b>Renaissance</b> was largely sober and almost exclusively religious, being more inline with <b>the</b> Northern <b>Renaissance</b> in nature, not following the pomp and excess of the Italian and Spanish Renaissances.|$|R
25|$|Diplomats, merchants, students, humanists, scholars, and artists, {{from all}} over Europe, were drawn to Portugal during its <b>Renaissance.</b> <b>The</b> {{maritime}} trade of the Age of Discovery played a decisive role {{in the evolution of}} <b>the</b> Portuguese <b>Renaissance.</b> Trade intensified contacts with important centers of <b>the</b> Italian <b>Renaissance</b> and it allowed a new commercial bourgeoisie to prosper and have excess funds to become patrons of <b>the</b> Portuguese <b>Renaissance,</b> much like <b>the</b> other <b>Renaissances</b> of Europe.|$|R
5|$|There is {{debate about}} the extent to which <b>the</b> <b>Renaissance</b> {{improved}} on the culture of the Middle Ages.

25|$|In {{terms of}} architecture, much like many {{sections}} of the arts, <b>the</b> Portuguese <b>Renaissance</b> did not, for the most and initial part, follow the paths of <b>the</b> other <b>Renaissances,</b> which heavily focused on the sophistication and simplicity of the ancient Greeks and Romans.

5|$|In all, <b>the</b> <b>Renaissance</b> {{could be}} viewed as an attempt by intellectuals to study and improve the secular and worldly, both through the revival of ideas from antiquity, and through novel {{approaches}} to thought. Some scholars, such as Rodney Stark, play down <b>the</b> <b>Renaissance</b> in favor of the earlier innovations of the Italian city-states in the High Middle Ages, which married responsive government, Christianity and the birth of capitalism. This analysis argues that, whereas the great European states (France and Spain) were absolutist monarchies, and others were under direct Church control, the independent city republics of Italy took over the principles of capitalism invented on monastic estates and set off a vast unprecedented commercial revolution that preceded and financed <b>the</b> <b>Renaissance.</b>|$|E
5|$|In his {{published}} score Monteverdi lists around 41 {{instruments to}} be deployed, with distinct groups of instruments used to depict particular scenes and characters. Thus strings, harpsichords and recorders represent the pastoral fields of Thrace with their nymphs and shepherds, while heavy brass illustrates the underworld and its denizens. Composed {{at the point}} of transition from <b>the</b> <b>Renaissance</b> era to the Baroque, L'Orfeo employs all the resources then known within the art of music, with particularly daring use of polyphony. The work is not orchestrated as such; in <b>the</b> <b>Renaissance</b> tradition instrumentalists followed the composer's general instructions but were given considerable freedom to improvise.|$|E
