500|$|In pulpitis, an {{important}} distinction in regard to treatment is whether the inflammation is reversible or irreversible. Treatment of reversible pulpitis is by removing or correcting the causative factor. Usually, the decay is removed, and a sedative dressing is used to encourage the pulp {{to return to a}} state of health, either as a base underneath a permanent filling or as a <b>temporary</b> <b>filling</b> intended to last for a period while the tooth is observed to see if pulpitis resolves. Irreversible pulpitis and its sequalae pulp necrosis and apical periodontitis require treatment with root canal therapy or tooth extraction, as the pulp acts as a nidus of infection, which will lead to a chronic infection if not removed. [...] Generally, there is no difference in outcomes between whether the root canal treatment is completed in one or multiple appointments. The field of regenerative endodontics is now developing ways to clean the pulp chamber and regenerate the soft and hard tissues to either regrow or simulate pulp structure. This has proved especially helpful in children where the tooth root has not yet finished developing and root canal treatments have lower success rates.|$|E

50|$|Temporary {{restoration}} is a <b>temporary</b> <b>filling</b> of {{a prepared}} tooth until permanent restoration is carried out. It {{is used to}} cover the prepared part of the tooth, {{in order to maintain}} the occlusal space and the contact points, and insulation of the pulpal tissues and maintenance of the periodontal relationship. Sometimes permanent restoration is not done after tooth preparation; this may be to prepare for indirect restoration such as inlays and onlays.Temporary fillings are also used for 'stabilization' techniques where many restorations are needed, and the problem may become worse before it can be fully treated - so temporary fillings are placed in order to stop progression.|$|E
5000|$|This {{technique}} is used {{when most of}} the decay has been removed from a deep cavity, but some softened dentin and decay remains over the pulp chamber that if removed would expose the pulp and trigger irreversible pulpitis. Instead, the dentist intentionally leaves the softened dentin/decay in place, and uses a layer of protective temporary material which promotes remineralization of the softened dentin over the pulp and the laying down of new layers of tertiary dentin in the pulp chamber. A <b>temporary</b> <b>filling</b> is used to keep the material in place, and about 6 months later, the cavity is re-opened and hopefully there is now enough sound dentin over the pulp (a [...] "dentin bridge") that any residual softened dentin can be removed and a permanent filling can be placed.

5000|$|A root treated tooth may be eased {{from the}} {{occlusion}} {{as a measure}} to prevent tooth fracture prior to the cementation of a crown or similar restoration. Sometimes the dentist performs preliminary treatment of the tooth by removing all of the infected pulp of the tooth and applying a dressing and <b>temporary</b> <b>filling</b> to the tooth. This is called a pulpectomy. The dentist may also remove just the coronal portion of the dental pulp, which contains 90% of the nerve tissue, and leave intact the pulp in the canals. This procedure, called a [...] "pulpotomy", tends to essentially eliminate all the pain. A pulpotomy may be a relatively definitive treatment for infected primary teeth. The pulpectomy and pulpotomy procedures aim to eliminate pain until the follow-up visit for finishing the root canal. Further occurrences of pain could indicate the presence of continuing infection or retention of vital nerve tissue.|$|E

Teeth were kept in normal saline at room temperature and every day the intercuspal distance was measured under stereomicroscope for 20 days. Infractions as well as fractures were also noted. Data were analyzed in SPSS 17 using Repeated measurement ANOVA test to evaluate the intercuspal distance and expansion of each sample every day. Results: Intercuspal distance increased in all three groups but was significantly more in Coltosol F group. On the days 10 and 16 two teeth filled with Coltosol F had cusp fracture.

40|$|Objectives: <b>Temporary</b> <b>filling</b> {{materials}} {{are used in}} endodontics to prevent contamination of the root canal system during intertreatment visits. The objectives {{of this study were}} to evaluate coronal microleakage of four <b>temporary</b> <b>filling</b> materials Cavisol, Litark, Zinc Phosphate, reinforced zinc oxide-eugenol{IRM}) and to compare the sealing ability of the ready made <b>temporary</b> <b>filling</b> materials (Cavisol, Litark) and hand mixed materials (IRM, Zinc phosphate). Materials and methods: standardized class I access cavities (4 x 4 mm) were prepared in 80 intact human mandibular and maxillary permanent premolar teeth. They were divided randomly into four groups consisting of 20 samples. Cotton pellets were placed in the pulp chamber assuring that the opening could accommodate at least 4 mm of the <b>temporary</b> <b>filling</b> material. Each group was restored with one of the test materials and placed in incubator for 48 hours at 37 c. The specimens were then thermocycled (5 to 55 0 C for 500 cycles). Then the specimens were painted with two layers of nail varnish, with the exception of cavity margins and immersed in 2 % methylene blue dye for 10 days for leakage assessment. The teeth were sectioned mesiodistally, and the degree of dye penetration was evaluated under steromicroscope. Grading of the microleakage pattern was from 1 to 3, with 3 providing the best seal. Result were analyzed using one way ANOVA test to determine if a statistically significant difference existed between the groups of the tested materials. Results: The result indicated that microleakage along Cavisol and Litark samples was within grade 3; whereas IRM and zinc phosphate samples absorbed the dye into the bulk of the materials. Cavisol was found to exhibit V the best seal amongst the four tested materials followed by Litark, Zinc phosphate and IRM. Conclusion: Among the four materials tested, Cavisol was observed to provide a consistently tight seal followed by Litark, zinc phosphate and IRM. This indicated that the ready made <b>temporary</b> <b>filling</b> materials have the best sealing ability over hand-mixed ones. These emphasize further need for the importance of correctly placing a sufficient thickness of <b>temporary</b> <b>filling</b> materials in endodontic access cavities to ensure a tight seal. Recommendations: However, because it is not known how the sealing properties will be affected over longer observation periods, or when the material is exposed to the oral environment, this study must be considered preliminary.

40|$|Introduction. Besides anatomo-morphological {{characteristics}} of the root canal system, instrumentation techniques, obturation materials as well as <b>temporary</b> <b>filling</b> materials can influence the coronal microleakage. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess in vitro coronal microleakage of <b>temporary</b> <b>filling</b> materials in endodontically treated teeth by the method of colored solutions. Material and Methods. Forty extracted human teeth (single-rooted and multi-rooted) divided into two groups of (intact and caries affected) were used. The root canals were instrumented by step-back preparation technique and 2. 5 % NaOCl as irigant solution. Obturation was performed by lateral condensation technique with Apexit paste and gutta-percha. Cavit and Glass Ionomer Cement were used as <b>temporary</b> <b>filling</b> materials. The solution of 50 % AgNO 3 was used for microleakage assessment. The penetration of the color was evaluated using Light Microscope. Results. Of intact teeth, 60 % temporarily filled by Cavit showed the color penetration, while only 25 % of the teeth temporarily filled by combination of GIC and Cavit. The difference was statistically significant (p< 0. 05). In caries affected teeth, the penetration of the color was observed in 55 % of the samples when Cavit was used and in 32 % when combination of GIC and Cavit was used as <b>temporary</b> <b>filling</b> material. The difference was statistically significant (p< 0. 05). Less color penetration occured in single-rooted than in multi-rooted teeth in both groups, but the differences were not statistically significant. Conclusion. Glass Ionomer Cements in combination with Cavit provide better sealing of endodontically treated teeth. The least color penetration was observed in intact single-rooted teeth...|$|E
