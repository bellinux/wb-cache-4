500|$|... "Have You Seen This Snail?" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} television critics. Tom Shales of The Washington Post called the episode deeply hilarious {{and described the}} plot as a [...] "bittersweet riot". He drew attention to how the story {{is similar to the}} plot of [...] "Dumped", an earlier episode in which Gary deserted SpongeBob. David Johnson of the DVD Verdict positively reacted to the DVD release of the episode and said [...] "I'm not sure what <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>here.</b> Mr. Squarepants is so ridiculously popular, this disc will most definitely sell itself." [...] Aida Ekberg of Yahoo! Voices ranked Amy Poehler on her [...] "Top 10 SpongeBob SquarePants Guest Stars" [...] list and said [...] "I'm surprised more comedians haven't been guest stars on SpongeBob. Amy Poehler does a great job with her creepy grandma voice, playing pure evil masked behind plate after plate of chocolate chip cookies." [...] Paul Mavis of DVD Talk loved the scene [...] "When Gary realizes he has to escape from her crushing love (which equals constant overeating) or die like the other snail shells he finds" [...] He said [...] "it's both funny and rather touching." ...|$|E
500|$|Creator Matthew Weiner {{conceived}} {{the script for}} [...] "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes" [...] in 2000, while he {{was working as a}} writer for the sitcom Becker. The first draft of the episode was written as a spec script and was titled [...] "The Division". Two years later, Weiner sent the script to David Chase, the creator of The Sopranos, although Weiner's agents insisted that he not proceed with his plans. Chase later recruited him upon first glance. [...] "It was what you’re always hoping to see," [...] he recalled. [...] "It was lively and it had something new <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> <b>Here</b> was someone who had written a story about advertising in the 1960s, and was looking at recent American history through that prism." [...] Weiner set the pilot script aside for the next seven years to focus on The Sopranos. Neither HBO nor Showtime expressed interest in the project until the commencement of The Sopranos final season. During that time, AMC began looking into the television market for new programming. [...] "The network was looking for distinction in launching its first original series," [...] according to AMC Networks president Ed Carroll, [...] "and we took a bet that quality would win out over formulaic mass appeal." ...|$|E

2500|$|As {{part of a}} {{statement}} released by his office {{in support of a}} day to honor emergency first responders in 2007, Allard was quoted as saying: “First responders in Colorado have recently provided critical services in the face of blizzards and tornados. Since I don’t think first responders have really done anything significant in comparison to their counterparts who have dealt with real natural disasters, I have no idea what else <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>here</b> …” ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1964, John Bell {{showed that}} this {{assumption}} can be falsified, {{since it would}} imply a certain inequality between the probabilities of different experiments. Experimental results confirm the predictions of quantum mechanics, ruling out Einstein's basic assumption {{that led him to}} the suggestion of his hidden variables. These hidden variables may be [...] "hidden" [...] because of an illusion that occurs during observations of objects that are too large or too small. [...] This illusion can be likened to rotating fan blades that seem to pop in and out of existence at different locations and sometimes seem {{to be in the same}} place at the same time when observed. [...] This same illusion manifests itself in the observation of subatomic particles. [...] Both the fan blades and the subatomic particles are moving so fast that the illusion is seen by the observer. [...] Therefore, it is possible that there would be predictability of the subatomic particles behavior and characteristics to a recording device capable of very high speed tracking....Ironically this fact is one of the best pieces of evidence supporting Karl Popper's philosophy of invalidation of a theory by falsification-experiments. That is <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>here</b> Einstein's [...] "basic assumption" [...] became falsified by experiments based on Bell's inequalities. For the objections of Karl Popper to the Heisenberg inequality itself, see below.|$|E
