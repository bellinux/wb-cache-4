5|$|Greenlandic is a polysynthetic {{language}} <b>that</b> <b>allows</b> <b>the</b> {{creation of}} long words by stringing together roots and suffixes.

5|$|After the Cortex Vortex, a {{space station}} owned by Doctor Neo Cortex, is {{destroyed}} by Doctor Nitrus Brio's laser beam device, pieces of the station crash into a tropical mountain. This sets free an entity known as Uka Uka, the mastermind behind Cortex's previous schemes. He derides Cortex for failing to retrieve the crystals and gems, {{both of which are}} vast sources of world energy. However, feeling generous after being freed from prison, Uka Uka recruits Doctor Nefarious Tropy to join him and Cortex in their latest plan. Tropy has created the Time-Twisting Machine, a time machine <b>that</b> <b>allows</b> <b>the</b> villains to travel through time to find more gems and crystals scattered across the timeline.|$|E
5|$|Although figs flower asynchronously as a population, in {{most species}} {{flowering}} is synchronised within an individual. Newly emerged female wasps must {{move away from}} their natal tree {{in order to find}} figs in which to lay their eggs. This is to the advantage of the fig, since it prevents self-pollination. In Florida, individual F. aurea trees flower and fruit asynchronously. Within-tree asynchrony in flowering is likely to raise the probability of self-pollination, but it may be an adaptation <b>that</b> <b>allows</b> <b>the</b> species to maintain an adequate population of wasps at low population densities or in strongly seasonal climates.|$|E
5|$|As of the 1981–82 NHL season, the Vezina Trophy {{has been}} given to the most {{outstanding}} goaltender as voted by the general managers of the NHL teams.

5|$|Blue and Red Landers, {{recurring}} {{characters in}} many Compile games, increase the player's maximum life and power chip capacities, respectively. Blue Landers play multiple roles in The Guardian Legend. Some {{of them are}} not items but non-player characters that dispense advice to the player or exchange upgrades for power chips; others provide a password <b>that</b> <b>allows</b> <b>the</b> player to resume the game at a later time with their progress retained. These Blue Landers also serve as checkpoints; players can restart their game in these designated rooms after being defeated provided the system has not been turned off.|$|E
5|$|By {{length of}} story, Planetarian is the {{shortest}} of Key's games. Excluding the opening and ending sequences, there are 16 parts to the story; the first half is set within the planetarium while the latter half is set outside in the ruined city where the planetarium resides. The novel takes four hours and forty minutes to complete on auto play. After the game has been completed at least once, two new options appear on the title screen. The first is a feature <b>that</b> <b>allows</b> <b>the</b> player to view twenty images of CG artwork observed in the game. The second option allows the player to listen to eight of the nine music tracks featured in the game.|$|E
5|$|DX arrays {{have been}} made to form hollow {{nanotubes}} 4–20nm in diameter, essentially two-dimensional lattices which curve back upon themselves. These DNA nanotubes are somewhat similar in size and shape to carbon nanotubes, and while they lack the electrical conductance of carbon nanotubes, DNA nanotubes are more easily modified and connected to other structures. One of many schemes for constructing DNA nanotubes uses a lattice of curved DX tiles that curls around itself and closes into a tube. In an alternative method <b>that</b> <b>allows</b> <b>the</b> circumference to be specified in a simple, modular fashion using single-stranded tiles, the rigidity of the tube is an emergent property.|$|E
