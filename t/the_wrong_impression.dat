25|$|Dan Sandshrew, {{the head}} of Equal Vision, {{said that there was}} a debate over the artwork for the album. Conley was unsure about what do with the artwork, and went along with Newman and Soloway's ideas. The cover artwork is of a high school party with Saves the Day shown as social outcasts sitting on a couch. The album booklet {{continues}} the outcast theme, telling a story. Sandshrew felt that cover would give <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>impression,</b> and Newman regretted it after the album was released. Conley said people told the band that they had sold out because the cover art featured their faces. The band, and Luke Hoverman, designed the concept with Frank Davidson providing the layout. The photographs were taken by Hoverman with assistance from Lenny Zimkus. The CD art features Gabe Saporta kissing a girl, while the back cover has actor James Ransone passed out on a couch.|$|E
500|$|The Tigers {{retained}} Pérez for the 2007 season, although Leyland {{acknowledged that}} Pérez {{would have to}} improve his play: [...] "I recommended that we trade for him. I take responsibility. I don't want people to get <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>impression.</b> I like Neifi Pérez, {{but he did not}} perform well. It's that simple." [...] Pérez, however, continued to struggle, posting a [...]172 batting average over the 33 games he played in a Tigers' uniform. One bright spot came on June 12, 2007, when he saved Justin Verlander's no-hitter against the Milwaukee Brewers by turning a possible base hit into an inning-ending double play.|$|E
5000|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Chris Hicky. The video shows the band performing the song on a TV show and {{is set in the}} 1950/60's based on the band and audience's clothes. One difference between the video and the album version of the song is, in the video they sing [...] "would you get <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> if I asked you dance right now" [...] instead of [...] "would you get <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> if I called us a cab right now".|$|R
5000|$|Caleb Ruminer as Cameron [...] "Crash" [...] Mason, an ex-juvenile delinquent {{who was a}} drug dealer. He is Carter's boyfriend. He was hated by Carter's family initially, giving <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>impressions</b> when he shot Max {{in season}} 1 and {{eventually}} ruining his relationship with her. When the two make up later on, and after becoming friends with Max, proving he is reformed, he gets into trouble with his Uncle Shay, causing him out of fear to leave town and enlist in the army.|$|R
5000|$|In 2002, {{responding}} {{to a question about}} coveting oil fields, George Bush said [...] "Those are <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>impressions.</b> I have a deep desire for peace. That's what I have a desire for. And freedom for the Iraqi people. See, I don't like a system where people are repressed through torture and murder in order to keep a dictator in place. That troubles me deeply. And so the Iraqi people must hear this loud and clear, that this country never has any intention to conquer anybody." ...|$|R
500|$|Several titles were {{considered}} during production, including [...] "Shot Down in Flames" [...] and [...] "IV". The former was rejected because Martin thought {{it sounded like}} a title The Beta Band would use. Taylor supported the name [...] "IV" [...] because he liked [...] "giving people <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>impression</b> all the time", and defended his opinion, saying [...] "if [...] give us any time, they would see that we're very serious about comedy ... and serious things as well". The album was called [...] "Made in the Dark" [...] because it was a title the band agreed on. Taylor considered the eponymous track to be one of his favourite songs, and thought it was nice to name the album after a thoughtful song, in contrast to Coming on Strong and The Warning, which he described as being [...] "big, slightly jokey, macho phrases".|$|E
500|$|A {{scene in}} Series 2, Episode 4 showing Karen smoking a joint {{at a dinner}} party was {{controversial}} with censors at the writing stage; all scripts were required to be sent to Granada's Compliance department to ensure they maintained the ITC's code of conduct. The department would not allow Karen's drug use to be portrayed without some cost to her, so suggested that Karen and Adam could be arrested while rolling joints at the school reunion. Bullen thought the idea was [...] "ludicrous" [...] so added a scene where David berates Ramona for her drug use. Despite the measures taken, four people complained to the ITC about the glamorisation of drugs. The ITC dismissed the complaints. The scenes of Jo and Audrey smoking cannabis in Series 5, Episode 1 drew seven complaints to the ITC by people who thought it would give children <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>impression</b> of drugs. The ITC dismissed the complaints on the basis that the episode was broadcast after the watershed. Mark Lawson was unappreciative of the scene, writing that the drugs plot was a [...] "forced jollity" [...] compared to the other humorous scenes in the episode.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{concerns}} {{have been raised}} among intersex activists that LGBT or queer groups including them could give <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>impression</b> that all or most intersex people are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender. Another {{concern is that the}} addition is only cosmetic, and that among groups that do this, LGBT goals are always prioritized over intersex ones. Emi Koyama states: ...|$|E
5000|$|The New Thought {{movement}} {{grew out}} of the teachings of Phineas Quimby in the early 19th century. Although he never used the words 'law of attraction' his basic premise was similar, although restricted only to the field of health: [...] the trouble is in the mind, for the body is only the house for the mind to dwell in, and we put a value on it according to its worth. Therefore if your mind has been deceived by some invisible enemy into a belief, you have put it into the form of a disease, with or without your knowledge. By my theory or truth I come in contact with your enemy, and restore you to your health and happiness. This I do partly mentally and partly by talking till I correct <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>impressions</b> and establish <b>the</b> Truth, and the Truth is the cure.|$|R
5000|$|Experts {{agree that}} stock market {{simulators}} {{are good for}} beginners, but they also urge that beginners should be guided by insight from experienced traders or trainers, because compared to real or live trading, simulators could be deceptive or sometimes misleading, giving <b>the</b> beginner a <b>wrong</b> <b>impression</b> that live trading is an [...] "easy fill". Real trading is a practice to be avoided with respect to moral-religious principles and also criticized in the economic environment.|$|R
500|$|The lead-up to Adore {{was marked}} by {{conflicting}} statements as to the album's sound—Corgan initially said the band was heading {{in the direction of}} the heavy-metal-guitar-and-electronic music-driven [...] "The End is the Beginning is the End" [...] in summer 1997. while the band's management reported the album would be all-acoustic. In early 1998, Corgan called the sound [...] "arcane night music", elaborating, [...] "The people that say it's acoustic will be <b>wrong.</b> <b>The</b> people that say it's electronic will be <b>wrong.</b> <b>The</b> people that say it's a Pumpkins record will be wrong. I will try to make something that is indescribable". Further complicating the situation was the record label's initial insistence to use the Rick Rubin produced, upbeat, poppy song [...] "Let Me Give the World to You" [...] as the album's lead single, something Corgan strongly objected to, fearing it would give listeners <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> first <b>impression</b> of <b>the</b> album. Corgan had to drop the song off the track list altogether to avoid using it as a single.|$|R
2500|$|Recently, {{the term}} post-glacial rebound is {{gradually}} {{being replaced by}} the term glacial isostatic adjustment. This is in recognition that {{the response of the}} Earth to glacial loading and unloading {{is not limited to the}} upward rebound movement, but also involves downward land movement, horizontal crustal motion, changes in global sea levels and the Earth's gravity field, induced earthquakes, and changes in the rotational motion. An alternate term that is sometimes used is glacial isostasy, because the uplift near the centre of rebound is due to the tendency towards the restoration of isostatic equilibrium (as in the case of isostasy of mountains). Unfortunately, that term gives <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>impression</b> that isostatic equilibrium is somehow reached, so by appending [...] "adjustment" [...] at the end, the motion of restoration is emphasized.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} the APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting, {{the leaders}} in {{attendance}} gather for what is officially known as the APEC Leaders' Family Photo. A long-standing tradition for this photo involved the attending leaders dressing in a costume that reflects the culture of the host member. The tradition dates back to the first such meeting in 1993 when then-U.S.President Bill Clinton outfitted the leaders in leather bombardier jackets. However, at the 2010 meeting, Japan opted to have the leaders dress in smart casual rather than the traditional kimono. Similarly, when Honolulu was selected in 2009 as the site for the 2011 APEC meeting, U.S.President Barack Obama joked that he looked forward to seeing the leaders dressed in [...] "flowered shirts and grass skirts". However, after viewing previous photos, and concerned that having the leaders dress in aloha shirts might give <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>impression</b> during a period of economic austerity, Obama decided that it might be time to end the tradition. Leaders were given a specially designed aloha shirt as a gift but were not required to wear it for the photo. However at the 2013 conference in Bali, Indonesia, leaders are toned with Batik outfit.|$|E

40|$|A 65 -year-old {{with solvent}} {{exposure}} for 30 years had progressive memory disturbance from December 2000 and was admitted twice to our hospital. He first received interferon a and then imatinib mesilate for chronic myelogenous leukemia. He had difficulty drawing, copying, reading and writing. When he read and copied, {{he recognized the}} subject matter as separate fragments, and the whole was guessed at from the fragments. These clinical features were thought to correspond to apperceptive visual agnosia. We diagnosed him with Alzheimer Disease because of the slow clinical course and absence of acute mental defects, as characteristic of interferoninduced dementia. In visual analysis his visual attention focused not on whole images, but on parts. His range of visual attention became extremely narrow and consequently he recognized an image from its parts, {{and not as a}} whole. The correct location of each part in the whole was also incorrectly identified, and from the parts he came up with an incorrect impression of the whole picture that high familial memory inspired. <b>The</b> <b>wrong</b> visual <b>impression</b> was expressed and not compared with the subject. Thus, the dysfunction in his visual attention profoundly affected the abnormality of his visual processing...|$|R
