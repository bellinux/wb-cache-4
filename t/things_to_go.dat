5|$|Prussia {{tried to}} take {{opportunity}} of the Russian Empire's wars with the Ottoman Empire and Sweden and move the weak Commonwealth into its sphere of influence. Some factions in the Commonwealth deemed {{this as an opportunity}} to shake free from decades of Russian control. That said, Prussia did not expect much from the alliance, not even that it would pass. When the treaty was first proposed to the Great Sejm by Prussian ambassador Ludwig Heinrich Buchholtz on 13 October 1788, Prussians expected that it would cause long and fruitless debate which only outcome would be to ensure the weakening of Russian (and to a lesser degree, Austrian) position in Poland. Overall, for Prussia, the alliance with Poland was only one of several potential options; but for some Polish politicians it became a new, and increasingly, only available strategy. The reception of Prussian proposal by the Sejm exceeded their expectations, and it has significantly strengthened the Patriotic Party. For the next year or so, Prussians decided to delay taking any clear action, keeping their options open. Buchholtz was also reprimanded for allowing <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> too far, and another Prussian diplomat, Girolamo Lucchesini, was sent to Warsaw to aid him.|$|E
25|$|Near {{the end of}} the book, Jaypaw and Leafpool must go to WindClan to take Onestar {{a message}} from Firestar about not {{shedding}} unnecessary blood in a battle over something that may never happen, while Hollypaw convinces Mousefur and Firestar to do something to help RiverClan. When they arrive, WindClan queen Gorsetail's kits (Sedgekit, Thistlekit and Swallowkit) are missing and WindClan blames RiverClan, saying {{that there will be a}} battle if RiverClan does not return the kits. Jaypaw and Leafpool return to camp and Lionpaw tells his brother and sister about the tunnels, where he thinks the kits may have gone. They enter the caves, coincidentally meeting up with the WindClan apprentices Breezepaw and Heatherpaw, who share their motive for being there. Jaypaw is guided by the spirit of Fallen Leaves and the group finds the kits behind a boulder that blocked the tunnel. It starts raining and the tunnel floods, but Jaypaw figures a way out just in time and they return the kits, saving the Clans from an unnecessary battle. So Breezepaw, Heatherpaw, Jaypaw, Lionpaw, and Hollypaw return the kits back to WindClan and avert the battle. Then, once again, Lionpaw and Heatherpaw meet up again. They both talk about the future and how they want <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>go.</b>|$|E
500|$|After turning {{ten years}} old, Stan was {{diagnosed}} with [...] "cynicism", which in the series is treated as a serious medical disorder where the sufferer sees nothing but feces instead of people and animals and hear flatulence noises during music and voices. Stan's friendships with the other main characters ended, his parents divorced and he moved out of his home. This episode formed a cliffhanger and set off widespread speculation that the series {{was coming to an}} end, but the premiere of {{the second half of the}} season resolved the arc as Stan was erroneously diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome and discovers Jameson Irish Whiskey cures cynicism. After struggling to repair his life, he finally explains he doesn't want <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back to normal, when his parents get back together and his life is repaired, although the end of the episode implies Stan may be permanently bound to whiskey to continue an everyday life.|$|E

[...] "I {{found out that}} it was one <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> down there as a skilled {{prospector}} might <b>go</b> <b>to</b> examine a mine that was to be valued according to his report of the indications, but that it was entirely another <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> and play the spy in a poor devil's house in order to buy something he didn't know he was selling and wouldn't sell if he did." ...|$|R

500|$|The {{risks of}} Operation Barras were {{acknowledged}} by the MoD and by officers {{involved in the}} planning and the assault. It was described by an SAS soldier as [...] "not a clinical, black balaclava, Princes Gate type operation. It was a very grubby, green operation with lots of potential for <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> wrong". Despite the risks, Richard Connaughton observed in Small Wars & Insurgencies that the operation showed the Blair government was not averse {{to the possibility of}} casualties when they felt the cause was just. During the crisis and its immediate aftermath, the British government came under pressure from opposition politicians to end the deployment to Sierra Leone, and Dorman suggested that {{the success or failure of}} Operation Barras was [...] "inextricably linked" [...] to the fate of the wider British operation. He suggested that, had the British forces been defeated, the United Kingdom would have been forced to withdraw all its forces from Sierra Leone.|$|E
500|$|In April 2014, it was {{announced}} that Emmett/Furla/Oasis Films and Crystal Lake Entertainment were planning to produce an hour-long Friday the 13th television series. The series is intended to focus on a group of characters at Crystal Lake, who {{have to deal with the}} return of Jason Voorhees, as well as discover new information about him and his family. On August 2015, it {{was announced}} that the series was being developed by The CW. Steve Mitchell and Craig Van Sickle were hired to write the pilot, while Sean S. Cunningham, Randall Emmett, George Furla and Mark Canton would be the executive producers. On August 2016, the network announced that decided to not move forward with the series. The CW president Mark Pedowitz explained, “We had better pilots. The bottom line is we felt we had stronger <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> with, and we didn’t go forward with it. It was well-written, it was darker than we wanted it to be, and we didn’t believe it had sustainability... We didn’t believe that it was a sustainable script, a sustainable series. It was a very good pilot, but not a sustainable series." ...|$|E

It was described by an SAS soldier as [...] "not a clinical, black balaclava, Princes Gate type operation. It was a very grubby, green operation with lots of potential for <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> wrong". Richard Connaughton observed in the journal Small Wars & Insurgencies that the operation showed that Tony Blair's government was not averse {{to the possibility of}} casualties where they felt the cause was just. Geoff Hoon, British Secretary of State for Defence, summed up the effect of the operation at a press conference, stating that [...] " [...] sends a number of powerful messages. Firstly, it is a yet further demonstration of the refusal of successive British governments to do deals with terrorists and hostage takers. Secondly, we hope the West Side Group [...] and other rebel units in Sierra Leone will now [...] accept {{the rule of law and}} the authority of the democratically elected government of Sierra Leone. Thirdly, we hope all those who may in future consider taking similar actions against UK armed forces will think carefully about the possible consequences and realise there is nothing to be gained by such action". Andrew M. Dorman of King's College London suggested that the fate of the wider British operation in Sierra Leone depended heavily on the success or failure of Operation Barras and that, had the British forces been defeated, the United Kingdom would have been forced to withdraw all its forces from Sierra Leone. Dorman also suggests that a defeat would have [...] "raised questions" [...] regarding Tony Blair's policy of using armed force for humanitarian intervention.|$|E

2500|$|Several of the magazine's {{editorial}} assistants {{have become}} prominent in journalism, academia and literature, including Jean Strouse, Deborah Eisenberg, Mark Danner and A. O. Scott. Another former intern and {{a contributor to}} the Review, author Claire Messud, said: [...] "They’re incredibly generous about taking the time to go through things. So much of [...] is about people doing things quickly, with haste. One of the first <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> out the window is a type of graciousness. ... There’s a whole sort of rhythm and tone of how they deal with people. I’m sure it was always rare. But it feels incredibly precious now." ...|$|E

[...] A senior Hamas figure Ahmad Yousef, said: [...] "We do not fear the fall of President Mohamed Morsy. [...] We fear the dramatic changes that could cause <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> out of hand and lead to bloodshed. We only care about stability in Egypt regardless of who is in charge. Egypt is a lifeline to us; it's {{a major factor in}} the stability of the internal Palestinian situation – it is our backbone." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jim Shelly of The Mirror commented unfavourably on the [...] "horrible inevitability" [...] of Bradley's casting, {{as he had}} {{previously}} portrayed Nigel Bates in the BBC soap opera EastEnders. Shelley noted a trend for former EastEnders and Channel 4 soap Brookside actors being cast in Holby City. The show is filmed at Elstree Studios, where EastEnders is also filmed. Bradley has commented that it is [...] "strange" [...] making the same journey to a different show, and has noted differences between Elliot and his EastEnders character Nigel in that Elliot has a [...] "better wardrobe" [...] and is more intelligent. He has also commented that working on Holby City is [...] "harder" [...] than EastEnders, as the show is filmed with a single-camera set-up which takes longer, and there are [...] "more <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> wrong" [...] when working with medical props and simulating operations.|$|E

60|$|Vanessa {{began to}} arrive at the {{conclusion}} that a husband who added a roving disposition to a settled income was a mixed blessing. It was one <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the end of the world; it was quite another <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> make oneself at home there. Even respectability seemed to lose some of its virtue when one practised it in a tent.|$|R
6000|$|... "I hear; but we can't always git <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> 'xactly as we approves of," [...] replied Bounce, stooping down {{to arrange}} the embers of the {{previous}} night's fire.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{are not to}} come to business, and I do {{not want}} <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> easy. I believe you said some things of me in your {{newspaper}} that were very scurrilous." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'But, look here, Bishop,' {{continued}} Marriott, 'this is all rot. You can't do a {{thing like}} this, and then refuse to offer any explanation, and expect <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on just as usual.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Berries," [...] said Bob, {{opening a}} cotton flour bag. [...] "I {{reckoned}} Miss Margaret wanted some. Then I brought a pelt; looked {{the sort of}} <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> round her winter cap." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Madonna," [...] said I, [...] "it is an unwise <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> a-journeying {{by night}} with three unknown men, and of such villainous appearance. To me they seem {{no better than}} bandits." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] she proceeded. [...] "You may be {{surprised}} to hear it--but I don't mean to allow <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on in this way. My contemptible son-in-law shall return to his wife." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'What answer am I to {{have the}} honour of taking back? A month's relegation to Nitria on bread and water? You, I am sure, will not allow such <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> unpunished; indeed, if they do, there is an end to all {{authority}} and discipline.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. And {{of course}} I {{must go to}} Colonel Lapham. My notion would be to inquire pretty {{thoroughly}} about him, and then, if I liked the look of <b>things,</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> right down to Republic Street and let him see {{what he could do}} with me, if anything." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was a fool}} <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> North in winter. It's {{no country}} for a raw tenderfoot, and Allinson should have taken a {{stronger}} party. I know something about transport work in the bush." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Ay, and if {{it blows}} only a little harder <b>things</b> will begin <b>to</b> <b>go.</b> I don't mind as long as {{everything}} holds, but when <b>things</b> begin <b>to</b> <b>go</b> it's bad." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know. It's {{as real as}} {{anything}} to me until I try to write it down. I was thinking about it only last night in bed, after you had loaned me 'Treasure Island'; and I made up {{a whole lot of}} new <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> into the story." ...|$|E
6000|$|They both fell silent, {{watching}} the darkened world and following their thoughts until a bugle summoned {{them to a}} belated dinner. Bert was suddenly alarmed.
