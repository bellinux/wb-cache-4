It has been shown that male jacanas in larger harems yelled at higher rates during the periods of time when all copulations took place, while males that already received their clutch or were involved in chick care yelled at lower and rates. These yells attracted the female bronze-winged Jacana when she is far from the yeller. A study showed that females seem <b>to</b> use <b>yells</b> <b>to</b> assess male quality, as the males that yelled at the highest rates were able to receive the greatest number of copulations. Females may also respond <b>to</b> the <b>yells</b> of males in their territory since they could attract other females who could intrude on their territory.|$|R
