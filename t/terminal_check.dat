40|$|Microfluidic CD {{platforms}} are {{utilized to}} perform different biological processes and chemical analyses. In general, a microfluidic CD implements the centrifugal {{force that is}} created by the spinning of the platform to pump liquid through the microfluidic network of chambers and channels. Over the last few decades, {{a wide range of}} active and passive valving methods were proposed and tested on various microfluidic platforms. Most of the presented valves are too complex to design and involve lengthy fabrication processes. In this paper, easy to fabricate air and liquid check valves for centrifugal microfluidic platforms are presented: a <b>Terminal</b> <b>Check</b> Valve (TCV) and a Bridge Check Valve (BCV). To understand the characteristic of the proposed valves, theoretical and experimental studies are conducted. Moreover, to test the effectiveness of these valves, liquid swapping is demonstrated by integrating TCV and BCV chips with thermo-pneumatic (TA) pumping on a CD. The valves are shown to accurately control flow direction which makes them an excellent choice for a variety of complex microfluidic processes. The experimental and theoretical results also indicate that these valves require low pressure for actuation. Furthermore, the theoretical results confirm the ability to adjust the required actuation pressure by changing the valve chip size. Finally, as a proof of concept for implementing the check valves on a biological application, an enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) is performed. The result shows that the TOT and BCV valving chips enhance the operating range of the processes that can be performed on the microfluidic CD. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

This location information is basic and high value-added information, and this information services make prior GIS (Geography Information System) to be useful to anybody. The acquisition of this location information from moving object is very important part for these LBS. After this, when LBS is familiar to everybody, we can predict that LBS system load is so heavy for the acquisition of so many subscribers and vehicles.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a new {{protocol}} is proposed {{for reducing the}} power consumption of the battery-powered terminals in a mobile computing environment. We exploit the fact that, in a mobile data network mobile terminals do not continuously receive data and therefore they need not continuously operate their receivers.

The proposed energy-efficient protocol {{is based on a}} paging procedure wherein a dedicated channel is used to alert (page) the terminals with pending traffic. Each <b>terminal</b> may <b>check</b> its traffic condition whenever it decides to by monitoring the paging channel. The protocol is evaluated through an approximated theoretical model and through computer simulation.

A glide mode trajectory consists of two phases: a ballistic phase and a glide phase. At a predetermined point along the trajectory, the guidance vanes extend and there is a transition from ballistic phase to glide phase. Glide phase targeting logic is designed to ensure the largest possible angle of fall permitted by the cloud cover and the visibility. The target is acquired when the projectile is close enough to detect the laser illumination or when the projectile emerges from the cloud cover, whichever event occurs later in the trajectory. When a trajectory solution has been obtained, time-to-target and <b>terminal</b> velocity are <b>checked</b> to ensure that there will be enough time to maneuver and that the projectile is aerodynamically stable—that it will not stall while maneuvering.|$|R
