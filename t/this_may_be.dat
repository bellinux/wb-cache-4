5|$|Among ectoparasites, bats carry fleas and mites, {{as well as}} {{specific}} parasites such as bat bugs and bat flies (Nycteribiidae and Streblidae). However, {{they are one of}} the few non-aquatic mammalian orders that do not host lice. <b>This</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> due to competition from more effective, specialized parasites which occupy the same niche.|$|E

5|$|At an Ashfield Council {{meeting on}} 28 May 2013 the council passed a motion that a {{permanent}} {{outline of a}} rainbow be painted in Summer Hill Square, {{with the understanding that}} <b>this</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> periodically 'chalked in' by children, families and community members.|$|E
5|$|Female orangutans have eight-year {{intervals}} between births, {{the longest}} interbirth intervals among the great apes. Unlike many other primates, male orangutans {{do not seem}} to practice infanticide. <b>This</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> because they cannot ensure they will sire a female's next offspring because she does not immediately begin ovulating again after her infant dies.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} safety, it is best practice to have 360° coverage with the active warnings, improving the chance of the vehicle being seen from all sides. In some countries, such as the United States, <b>this</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> mandatory.|$|E

5|$|In rare individuals, {{paracetamol}} toxicity {{can result}} from normal use. <b>This</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> due to individual ("idiosyncratic") differences in the expression and activity of certain enzymes {{in one of the}} metabolic pathways that handle paracetamol (see paracetamol's metabolism).|$|E
5|$|In some church {{records the}} town is {{referred}} to as 'Norton Canonicorum' as an alternative to Midsomer Norton, and <b>this</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> because of the local Priory's link to Merton Priory in London until the dissolution of the monasteries in 1546.|$|E
5|$|It {{may also}} appear suspect because similar events are not {{observed}} in other ice ages (Hemming 2004), although <b>this</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> {{due to the}} lack of high-resolution sediments.|$|E

5|$|Low immune {{function}} {{has also been}} implicated in endometrial cancer. High blood pressure is also a risk factor, but <b>this</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> because of its association with obesity. Sitting regularly for prolonged periods is associated with higher mortality from endometrial cancer. The risk is not negated by regular exercise, though it is lowered.|$|E
5|$|Native Americans and Inuit {{are more}} likely to be {{infected}} with colds and develop complications such as otitis media than Caucasians. <b>This</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> explained by issues such as poverty and overcrowding rather than by ethnicity.|$|E
5|$|On systems which don't {{support the}} F571 extension, it is {{possible}} to emulate IS UNKNOWN p by going over every argument that could make the expression p Unknown and test those arguments with IS NULL or other NULL-specific functions, although <b>this</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> more cumbersome.|$|E

5|$|Outside Lhasa {{most of the}} Tibetans do not {{understand}} the Chinese language, so Tibetan is the natural language for basic instruction. However, <b>this</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> affected by the availability of teachers and the preference of the local administration.|$|E

5|$|The American {{goldfinch}} {{begins its}} breeding season {{later in the}} year than any other finch and later than any other native North American bird, besides occasionally the sedge wren. <b>This</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> related to the abundance of seeds in the late summer months, as seeds represent the majority of their diet.|$|E
