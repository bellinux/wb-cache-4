5|$|While Eisenhower {{appreciated}} Shoup's fiscal {{experience and}} apolitical outlook, Shoup was called upon most often by Kennedy. With Kennedy's relations with <b>the</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Chiefs</b> <b>of</b> Staff strained, particularly following the Cuban Missile Crisis, he called upon Shoup privately for many consultations. Shoup's biographer Howard Jablon wrote that Shoup was Kennedy's favorite general. In turn, Shoup {{was the most}} supportive of Kennedy of all of <b>the</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Chiefs</b> <b>of</b> Staff. Kennedy had asked Shoup to remain as Commandant {{for a second term}} in 1963, but Shoup declined in order to allow the advancement of other Marine generals.|$|E

5|$|At the Pacific Military Conference in March 1943, <b>the</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Chiefs</b> <b>of</b> Staff {{approved}} {{the latest version}} of General MacArthur's Elkton plan for an advance on Rabaul. Owing to a shortage of resources, particularly heavy bomber aircraft, the final stage of the plan, the capture of Rabaul itself, was postponed until 1944. By July 1943, the Joint Chiefs were considering the possibility of neutralising and bypassing Rabaul, but the navy would still need a forward fleet base. The Admiralty Islands, already a part of the Elkton plan, could serve this purpose, as they contained flat areas for airstrips, space for military installations, and Seeadler Harbour, which was large enough to accommodate a naval task force. On 6 August 1943, <b>the</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Chiefs</b> <b>of</b> Staff adopted a plan that called for the neutralisation rather than the capture of Rabaul, and scheduled the invasion of the Admiralty Islands for 1 June 1944.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time as the early nuclear arms control work, the Chairman of <b>the</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Chiefs</b> <b>of</b> Staff, General Nathan F. Twining, sent a memorandum, in August 1959, to the Secretary of Defense, Neil McElroy, which {{suggested}} that the Strategic Air Command (SAC) formally be assigned responsibility to prepare the national nuclear target list, and a single plan for nuclear operations. Up to that point, the Army, Navy, and Air Force had done their own target planning. This had led to the same objectives being targeted multiple times by the different services. The separate service plans were not mutually supporting as in, for example, the Navy destroying an air defense facility on the route of an Air Force bomber going to a deeper target. While Twining had sent the memo to McElroy, the members of <b>the</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Chiefs</b> <b>of</b> Staff disagreed on the policy during early 1960. Thomas Gates, who succeeded McElroy, asked President Dwight D. Eisenhower to decide the policy.|$|E

5|$|During the 1948 Revolt of the Admirals, {{a number}} of naval {{officers}} publicly disagreed with the administration's policy over cuts to naval aviation and amphibious warfare capability, resulting in the relief of the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Louis Denfeld, and his replacement by Admiral Forrest Sherman.

There were already 32 Silverplate B-29s in service with the Strategic Air Command, so the Air Materiel Command {{was directed to}} carry out Saddletree modifications on a further 80 B-29s, 36 B-50As, 23 B-50Bs and 18 B-36Bs. The B-36A could not carry nuclear weapons without major modifications.|$|E
5|$|Eisenhower favored Shoup {{because he}} feared other {{officers}} {{spent too much}} time in political affairs, and felt Shoup would reduce the influence of the military industrial complex. Immediately after his appointment, Shoup sought to place new officers in key positions, in an attempt to overhaul the leadership of the Marine Corps. He and Pate disagreed over some of the new appointments, as Shoup transferred many senior officers and encouraged others to retire. Shoup later wrote he felt <b>the</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Chiefs</b> <b>of</b> Staff had an undue weight in the direction of military strategy. He also sought to curtail politicking by lower-level Marine officers seeking career advancement.|$|E
