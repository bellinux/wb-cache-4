40|$|The use of syngas from waste or biomass {{gasification}} {{to generate}} electricity is a way which is attracting increasing attention {{especially with regard to}} the demands of regenerable energy consumption and to the reduction of waste disposal. In order to feed the syngas to a gas motor or a gas turbine the gas has to be cleaned. In future also the coupling of biomass gasification with a fuel cell will be applied, which needs a very efficient gas cleaning. The decomposition of <b>tars</b> and the <b>removal</b> of particles from the gas are the key issues of gas cleaning. Up to now these two steps are performed in two separate units. Normally, the tars are decomposed in catalytic beds or honeycomb structures. The catalytic decomposition is achieved at temperatures between 750 C and 900 C depending on the catalyst used. Particles are removed by filtration of the hot gas. Filtration at high temperatures and with high efficiencies is possible when using ceramic filter elements. Ceramic hot gas filters are well established in advanced coal gasification, such as the integrated gasification combined cycle process, as well as in waste and biomass gasification and pyrolysis processes. Since the catalytic reaction requires high temperatures the gas has to be reheated after the particles are removed in the filter or the hot unfiltered gas has to flow through the catalytic unit. If the gas is filtered first, reheating of the gas stream is an additional cost factor. Furthermore, pipes downstream of the filter can be plugged, if the temperature of the gas falls below the condensation temperature of the heavy hydrocarbons. Using the second way of hot unfiltered gas flows through the catalytic unit, there is the problem of deactivation of the catalyst by deposition of dust at higher dust concentrations.

"The April 20, 2010, {{explosion and}} collapse of the BP Deepwater Horizon oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico resulted in the release of millions of barrels of oil into Gulf waters. The response to this disaster involved the efforts {{of tens of thousands of}} workers in a variety of capacities across Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Texas, and in the Gulf of Mexico itself. The diverse work included oil and <b>tar</b> ball <b>removal</b> from beaches, oil skimming and booming near shores, burning of surface oil near the source of the oil release, surface application of dispersant by vessels and aircraft, and containment and recovery work on vessels at the release site. The nature of these activities raised concerns about potential occupational exposures to chemical and physical hazards and mental stressors. The Deepwater Horizon oil release was an unprecedented event in the United States in many respects, requiring response work across a vast area of multiple jurisdictions. The type, location, and quantities of oil released; the types and quantities of dispersant used; and climatic and geographical conditions differentiate this release from past oil spills. On May 28, 2010, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) received a request for a health hazard evaluation (HHE) from BP management concerning health effects experienced by responders to the oil release. The request was prompted by the May 26, 2010, hospitalization of seven fishermen who were working in BP's Vessels of Opportunity (VoO) program in the Gulf of Mexico. The fishermen had been hospitalized for symptoms that were initially believed to be related to exposures experienced during their response activities, particularly booming and skimming oil. In response to this request, we began an investigation on June 2, 2010, with an opening meeting held at the BP Operations Center in Houma, Louisiana. In attendance were representatives from NIOSH, BP, the Center for Toxicology and Environmental Health (CTEH), O'Brien's Response Management, the U. S. Coast Guard (USCG), and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). Objectives of this opening meeting were to discuss the initial investigations conducted by CTEH and OSHA into the events surrounding the hospitalization of the fishermen and to plan the NIOSH investigation. These plans included interviews, health symptom surveys, and on-site industrial hygiene assessments of response work activities similar to those performed by the fishermen. As the plans were developing, BP requested that we expand the scope of the HHE to include all major offshore response activities. In addition to oil booming and skimming conducted by workers on VoO vessels, these activities included aerial and vessel-based dispersant releases, in-situ surface oil burning, containment and recovery work at the oil source, and other related offshore oil removal activities. In the weeks that followed, teams of NIOSH industrial hygienists, medical officers, and other occupational health specialists conducted on-site investigations at locations throughout the Gulf region to collect quantitative and qualitative data on potential worker exposures, health symptoms, work practices and procedures, and work organization. On June 22, 2010, NIOSH received a request from BP for a second HHE to investigate potential hazards associated with onshore response work activities. In response to this request, teams of NIOSH personnel evaluated practices and procedures including wildlife cleanup operations, beach cleanup operations, and decontamination and waste management activities throughout the states of Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, and Florida. In contrast to the offshore evaluations, which relied on traditional industrial hygiene exposure assessment methodologies and quantitative exposure monitoring to identify potential hazards, the onshore assessment relied on qualitative assessment techniques, including the use of professional judgment and expertise during observations of onshore work activities. Health symptom surveys, however, were similar to those used for the offshore evaluations. The goals of the NIOSH HHE assessments were to describe acute health effects, evaluate occupational exposures in qualitative or quantitative assessments, and generate hypotheses regarding symptoms potentially related to work activities. These assessments were not intended to describe or investigate potential long-term or chronic health effects. The results of these investigations were reported in a series of nine interim reports and report summaries posted on the NIOSH website. The full reports were distributed electronically to key contacts for each work activity evaluated. Included in the reports were conclusions regarding the extent of hazards and exposures identified as well as recommendations for improving workplace conditions. Furthermore, all exposure and health symptom survey data were compiled in electronic spreadsheets and posted on the NIOSH website.

Introduction Environmental concerns {{such as the}} control of greenhouse gas emissions have led to an increased interest {{in the use of}} renewable energy. Biomass is widely used in combustion but can also be uti- lized in more advanced applications such as the production of a synthesis gas (syngas, a mixture of CO and H 2), which can be used for the production of liquid fuels such as Fisher-Tropsch or meth- anol. Lignocellulosic biomass may be a promising feedstock through the gasification processes [1, 2], but tar is also formed dur- ing gasification [3]. The tar content in the product gas is the major cumbersome and problematic parameter in the gasification pro- cesses [4]. Tar represents a complex mixture of over 100 com- pounds [5, 6]. It leads to fouling, coke deposition, and catalyst deactivation. Hence, <b>tar</b> conversion or <b>removal</b> {{is one of the main}} challenges for the successful development of commercial gasifica- tion technologies and has been extensively studied [7, 8]. Evans and Milne [5] defined three main classes of tars: primary tars (low temperature, oxygenated) and secondary and tertiary tars (benzene, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons [...] PAHs, etc.). In com- bustion and gasification reactors, the heaviest (tertiary) tars are ⇑ Corresponding author. Fax: + 33 3 83 37 81 20. E-mail address: pierre-alexandre. glaude@univ-lorraine. fr (P. -A. Glaude). abstract Anisole was chosen as the simplest surrogate for primary tar from lignin pyrolysis to study the gas-phase chemistry of methoxyphenol conversion. Methoxyphenols are one of the main precursors of PAH and soot in biomass combustion and gasification. These reactions are of paramount importance for the atmospheric environment, to mitigate emissions from wood combustion, and for reducing tar formation during gasification. Anisole pyrolysis and stoichiometric oxidation were studied in a jet-stirred reactor (673 - 1173 K, residence time 2 s, 800 Torr (106. 7 kPa), under dilute conditions) coupled with gas chromatography-flame ionization detector and mass spectrometry. Decomposition of anisole starts at 750 K and a conversion degree of 50 % is obtained at about 850 K under both studied conditions. The main products of reaction vary with temperature and are phenol, methane, carbon monoxide, benzene, and hydrogen. A detailed kinetic model (303 species, 1922 reactions) based on a combustion model for light aromatic compounds has been extended to anisole. The model predicts the conversion of anisole and the formation of the main products well. The reaction flux analyses show that anisole decomposes mainly to phenoxy and methyl radicals in both pyrolysis and oxidation conditions. The decomposition of phenoxy radicals is the main source of cyclopentadienyl radicals, which are the main precursor of naphthalene and heavier PAH in these conditions...|$|R

The amount and composition of farm residues, therefore, widely change during year, according to the single production process periodically achieved. Coupling high efficiency micro-cogeneration energy units with easy handling biomass conversion equipments, suitable to treat different materials, would provide many important advantages to the farmers and to the community as well, so {{that the increase in}} feedstock flexibility of gasification units is nowadays seen as a further paramount step towards their wide spreading in rural areas and as a real necessity for their utilization at small scale. Two main research topics were thought to be of main concern at this purpose, and they were therefore discussed in this work: the investigation of fuels properties impact on gasification process development and the technical feasibility of small scale gasification units integration with cogeneration systems. According to these two main aspects, the present work was thus divided in two main parts. The first one is focused on the biomass gasification process, that was investigated in its theoretical aspects and then analytically modelled in order to simulate thermo-chemical conversion of different biomass fuels, such as wood (park waste wood and softwood), wheat straw, sewage sludge and refuse derived fuels. The main idea is to correlate the results of reactor design procedures with the physical properties of biomasses and the corresponding working conditions of gasifiers (temperature profile, above all), in order to point out the main differences which prevent the use of the same conversion unit for different materials. At this scope, a gasification kinetic free model was initially developed in Excel sheets, considering different values of air to biomass ratio and the downdraft gasification technology as particular examined application. The differences in syngas production and working conditions (process temperatures, above all) among the considered fuels were tried to be connected to some biomass properties, such elementary composition, ash and water contents. The novelty of this analytical approach was the use of kinetic constants ratio in order to determine oxygen distribution among the different oxidation reactions (regarding volatile matter only) while equilibrium of water gas shift reaction was considered in gasification zone, by which the energy and mass balances involved in the process algorithm were linked together, as well. Moreover, the main advantage of this analytical tool is the easiness by which the input data corresponding to the particular biomass materials can be inserted into the model, so that a rapid evaluation on their own thermo-chemical conversion properties is possible to be obtained, mainly based on their chemical composition A good conformity of the model results with the other literature and experimental data was detected for almost all the considered materials (except for refuse derived fuels, because of their unfitting chemical composition with the model assumptions). Successively, a dimensioning procedure for open core downdraft gasifiers was set up, by the analysis on the fundamental thermo-physical and thermo-chemical mechanisms which are supposed to regulate the main solid conversion steps involved in the gasification process. Gasification units were schematically subdivided in four reaction zones, respectively corresponding to biomass heating, solids drying, pyrolysis and char gasification processes, and the time required for the full development of each of these steps was correlated to the kinetics rates (for pyrolysis and char gasification processes only) and to the heat and mass transfer phenomena from gas to solid phase. On the basis of this analysis and according to the kinetic free model results and biomass physical properties (particles size, above all) it was achieved that for all the considered materials char gasification step is kinetically limited and therefore temperature is the main working parameter controlling this step. Solids drying is mainly regulated by heat transfer from bulk gas to the inner layers of particles and the corresponding time especially depends on particle size. Biomass heating is almost totally achieved by the radiative heat transfer from the hot walls of reactor to the bed of material. For pyrolysis, instead, working temperature, particles size and the same nature of biomass (through its own pyrolysis heat) have all comparable weights on the process development, so that the corresponding time can be differently depending on one of these factors according to the particular fuel is gasified and the particular conditions are established inside the gasifier. The same analysis also led to the estimation of reaction zone volumes for each biomass fuel, so as a comparison among the dimensions of the differently fed gasification units was finally accomplished. Each biomass material showed a different volumes distribution, so that any dimensioned gasification unit {{does not seem to be}} suitable for more than one biomass species. Nevertheless, since reactors diameters were found out quite similar for all the examined materials, it could be envisaged to design a single units for all of them by adopting the largest diameter and by combining together the maximum heights of each reaction zone, as they were calculated for the different biomasses. A total height of gasifier as around 2400 mm would be obtained in this case. Besides, by arranging air injecting nozzles at different levels along the reactor, gasification zone could be properly set up according to the particular material is in turn gasified. Finally, since gasification and pyrolysis times were found to considerably change according to even short temperature variations, it could be also envisaged to regulate air feeding rate for each gasified material (which process temperatures depend on), so as the available reactor volumes would be suitable for the complete development of solid conversion in each case, without even changing fluid dynamics behaviour of the unit as well as air/biomass ratio in noticeable measure. The second part of this work dealt with the gas cleaning systems to be adopted downstream the gasifiers in order to run high efficiency CHP units (i. e. internal engines and micro-turbines). Especially in the case multi–fuel gasifiers are assumed to be used, weightier gas cleaning lines need to be envisaged in order to reach the standard gas quality degree required to fuel cogeneration units. Indeed, as the more heterogeneous feed to the gasification unit, several contaminant species can simultaneously be present in the exit gas stream and, as a consequence, suitable gas cleaning systems have to be designed. In this work, an overall study on gas cleaning lines assessment is carried out. Differently from the other research efforts carried out in the same field, the main scope is to define general arrangements for gas cleaning lines suitable to remove several contaminants from the gas stream, independently on the feedstock material and the energy plant size The gas contaminant species taken into account in this analysis were: particulate, tars, sulphur (in H 2 S form), alkali metals, nitrogen (in NH 3 form) and acid gases (in HCl form). For each of these species, alternative cleaning devices were designed according to three different plant sizes, respectively corresponding with 8 Nm 3 /h, 125 Nm 3 /h and 350 Nm 3 /h gas flows. Their performances were examined on the basis of their optimal working conditions (efficiency, temperature and pressure drops, above all) and their own consumption of energy and materials. Successively, the designed units were combined together in different overall gas cleaning line arrangements, paths, by following some technical constraints which were mainly determined from the same performance analysis on the cleaning units and from the presumable synergic effects by contaminants on the right working of some of them (filters clogging, catalysts deactivation, etc.). One of the main issues to be stated in paths design accomplishment was the <b>tars</b> <b>removal</b> from the gas stream, preventing filters plugging and/or line pipes clogging At this scope, a catalytic tars cracking unit was envisaged as the only solution to be adopted, and, therefore, a catalytic material which is able to work at relatively low temperatures was chosen. Nevertheless, a rapid drop in tars cracking efficiency was also estimated for this same material, so that an high frequency of catalysts regeneration and a consequent relevant air consumption for this operation were calculated in all of the cases. Other difficulties had to be overcome in the abatement of alkali metals, which condense at temperatures lower than tars, but they also need to be removed in the first sections of gas cleaning line in order to avoid corrosion of materials. In this case a dry scrubber technology was envisaged, by using the same fine particles filter units and by choosing for them corrosion resistant materials, like ceramic ones. Besides these two solutions which seem to be unavoidable in gas cleaning line design, high temperature gas cleaning lines were not possible to be achieved for the two larger plant sizes, as well. Indeed, as the use of temperature control devices was precluded in the adopted design procedure, ammonia partial oxidation units (as the only considered methods for the abatement of ammonia at high temperature) were not suitable for the large scale units, because of the high increase of reactors temperature by the exothermic reactions involved in the process. In spite of these limitations, yet, overall arrangements for each considered plant size were finally designed, so that the possibility to clean the gas up to the required standard degree was technically demonstrated, even in the case several contaminants are simultaneously present in the gas stream. Moreover, all the possible paths defined for the different plant sizes were compared each others on the basis of some defined operational parameters, among which total pressure drops, total energy losses, number of units and secondary materials consumption. On the basis of this analysis, dry gas cleaning methods proved preferable to the ones including water scrubber technology in al of the cases, especially because of the high water consumption provided by water scrubber units in ammonia adsorption process. This result is yet connected to the possibility to use activated carbon units for ammonia removal and Nahcolite adsorber for chloride acid. The very high efficiency of this latter material is also remarkable. Finally, as an estimation of the overall energy loss pertaining the gas cleaning process, the total enthalpy losses estimated for the three plant sizes were compared with the respective gas streams energy contents, these latter obtained on the basis of low heating value of gas only. This overall study on gas cleaning systems is thus proposed as an analytical tool by which different gas cleaning line configurations can be evaluated, according to the particular practical application they are adopted for and the size of cogeneration unit they are connected to. ...|$|R

40|$|Two metal oxides, {{naturally}} occurring ilmenite (iron titanium oxide) and manufactured nickel oxide supported on an α-Al 2 O 3 matrix (NiO/AL 2 O 3), were compared as catalysts for secondary biomass gas upgrading. The experiments {{were conducted in}} a Chemical-Looping Reforming (CLR) reactor, which combines biomass gas upgrading with continuous regeneration of coke deposits. The CLR system was fed with a tar-rich producer gas from the Chalmers 2 – 4 MW biomass gasifier, and the possibilities to reduce the tar fraction and to increase the yield of hydrogen were evaluated for temperatures between 700 °C and 880 °C. A system-wide molar balance was established, to enable calculations of <b>tar</b> <b>removal</b> efficiency on a mass basis; these results were further compared with those for the more widely used tar-to-reformed gas ratio, yielding tar concentrations in units of gtar/Nm 3 gas. Both materials exhibited activity with respect to tar decomposition and increased the yield of hydrogen. In addition, both <b>tar</b> <b>removal</b> and hydrogen production were increased with increases in temperature. All the phenolic compounds and {{a large proportion of}} the one-ring branched tars were decomposed at 800 ºC by the two catalysts, despite the fact that the tar load in the raw gas was as high as 30 gtar/Nm 3 gas. Results from the mole balance showed that it is important to specify on what basis the <b>tar</b> <b>removal</b> efficiency is calculated. The <b>tar</b> <b>removal</b> efficiency was calculated to 95 % for the Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalyst at 880 °C and to 60 % for the ilmenite catalyst at 850 °C on tar-to-reformed gas basis. When the produced permanent gases were removed from the reformed gas the same calculations yielded the <b>tar</b> <b>removal</b> efficiency of 86 % and 42 % respectively.

The material La 0. 8 Sr 0. 2 FeO 3 /gamma-Al 2 O 3 exhibited high levels of conversion of all tar surrogates investigated, whereas CuO/MgAl 2 O 4 showed less promising behavior. For this material, the C 2 H 4 conversion {{in the absence of}} aromatic compounds was very high, but in the presence of monoaromatic compounds, the conversion of aromatics and C 2 H 4 was poor.

40|$|With {{respect to}} global issues of {{sustainable}} energy, biomass is getting increased attention as a renewable energy source. Biomass gasification {{is the only}} process that produces a syn-gas mixture which has numerous opportunities for applications such as for gas turbines, engines, fuel cells, hydrocarbon synthesis, hydrogen production etc. One of the major issues in biomass gasification is {{to deal with the}} formation of tar. Tar is a term used to describe a complex mixture of condensable hydrocarbons and is undesirable due to its condensation causing blockage in the process equipments. The successful implementation of biomass gasification depends much on the effective and efficient <b>tar</b> <b>removal</b> from the producer gas. This paper addresses several issues on tar treatment with special emphasis on use of olivine as <b>tar</b> <b>removal</b> catalyst and use of non-thermal plasma for <b>tar</b> <b>removal.</b> In order to facilitate the study tar conversion, naphthalene is chosen as a model biomass tar compound {{which is one of the}} most stable and therefore the most difficult tar to decompose. Olivine, a naturally occurring mineral, is a very attractive inbed catalyst for fluidized bed biomass gasifiers as it shows high attrition resistance. A simple method of pre-treatment of olivine can improve the catalytic activity of olivine significantly. A naphthalene conversion of more than 81 % is observed over olivine catalyst which is pre-treated with air for 10 hours at a temperature of 900 °C. Chemical conversion of tar requires high temperatures to initiate the reactions. Apart from temperature, another approach to generate this reactive environment is by means of gas discharges. Atmospheric pressure gas discharges or non-thermal plasma as is commonly referred to, generates high energy electrons which dissociate molecules and thereby creates the necessary reactive environment. The major advantage of using non-thermal plasma is to do chemical conv~rsion of tars at low temperatures. The experimental results have indicated complete conversion of tar by pulsed corona processing at much lower temperature. The energy density requirement is observed to be 400 - 600 JIL for naphthalene removal from a fuel gas mixture at a temperature of 200 °C. This could be significantly reduced to 200 - 250 JIL by increasing the temperature to 400 °C. The investigations also indicate that the gaseous environment has strong influence on tar cracking reactions. For both the methods presented here, it is observed that presence of H, and CO in the gas mixture, do not improve the <b>tar</b> <b>removal</b> efficiency of the processes for high temperature processes...|$|E
40|$|Determinations {{of design}} {{parameters}} and investigation on operation {{performance of a}} <b>tar</b> <b>removal</b> system for gas cleaning of biomass producer gas have been undertaken. The presence of the tars in the producer gas has been the major hindrance for the commercialisation of the biomass gasification technology for power generation, hydrogen production, Fischer Tropsch (FT) synthesis, chemical synthesis and synthetic natural gas (SNG) synthesis. The characteristic of the tars to condense at reduced temperatures cause problems in the downstream processing as the tars can block and foul the downstream process equipment such as gas engines reactor channels, fuel cells, etc. Considerable efforts have been directed at the removal of tars from the producer gas where the tars can be either chemically converted into lighter molecular weight molecules or physically transferred from gas phase to liquid or solid phase. In the former, the tars have been removed in a scrubber by transferring them from the producer gas to a scrubbing liquid and then removed from the liquid to air in a stripper and finally recycled them into air to a gasifier to recover their energy. A <b>tar</b> <b>removal</b> test system involving a scrubber and stripper has been designed based on the predicted tar solubility in canola methyl ester (CME) as the scrubbing liquid and its measured properties (CME {{is a type of}} methyl ester biodiesel). The tar solubility has been predicted to decrease with increasing temperatures and thus its value increases at lower temperatures. In designing the test system, the design parameters are needed including equilibrium coefficients of the gas-liquid system, molar transfer coefficient and the optimum liquid to gas flow rate ratio. The equilibrium coefficients have been predicted based on thermodynamic theories where the required data are determined from CME composition and known properties of each component of the CME as well as the properties of the model tar (naphthalene). The molar transfer coefficients are then experimentally determined and the correlations as a function of liquid and gas flow rates are proposed which are consistent with literature. The optimum liquid to gas flow rate ratios {{have been found to be}} 21. 4 ± 0. 1 for the scrubber and 5. 7 ± 0. 1 for the stripper. Using these optimum ratios, the <b>tar</b> <b>removal</b> efficiencies in the scrubber and the stripper are 77 and 74 %, respectively. The analysis of the system performance has been achieved after an innovative method of determining tar concentrations in both the liquid and gas phase had been developed based on the concept of the density of liquid mixtures. However, these <b>tar</b> <b>removal</b> efficiencies are low due to the fact that the targeted tar concentration in the scrubber’s off-gas was large. As a result the system has been redesigned based on the determined design parameters and its operation performance retested. In the redesigned system, the <b>tar</b> <b>removal</b> efficiency in the scrubber and stripper is 99 %. The redesigned system would be integrated with the UC gasifier for downstream gas cleaning. Since 1 % of tars are not removed, a makeup tar free CME of 0. 0375 litres per hour for the 100 kW UC gasifier has been introduced in the recycle stream between the scrubber and stripper to avoid tar accumulation in the system...|$|E

Experiments were performed at 700 °C, after which the product stream was thoroughly condensed and the gas stream was analyzed. The results show a significant tar reduction for a fixed potassium-loaded char bed at a gas hourly space velocity (GC 1 HSV) of 237 h– 1. If the GC 1 HSV is reduced, the reduction in tar increases. A reduction of a factor of 10 was observed when the feed was also loaded with 5 wt % KOH.
