She reached out <b>to</b> <b>every</b> <b>single</b> person who was seen as essential in Marcos's campaign. Her efforts were not original, but extraordinary. No other politicians' wives shook hands with all the delegates, visited their homes, genuinely understood the concerns they had, aside from Imelda. She bombarded them with gifts when necessary.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time Japan's 10th Army was {{storming}} Yuhuatai, a rugged plateau situated {{directly in front of}} Zhonghua Gate on Nanking's southern side. The 10th Army's progress was slow and casualties were heavy as Yuhuatai was built like a fortress of interlocking pillboxes and trenches manned by three Chinese divisions, including the German-trained 88th Division, though the Chinese were also apt to counterattack and some Japanese units were forced to spend more time defending than attacking. Close <b>to</b> <b>every</b> <b>single</b> man that the 88th Division had deployed on Yuhuatai was killed in action, including three of its four regimental commanders and both of its brigade commanders, but in the process the Japanese were made to suffer 2,240 casualties including 566 dead. Yuhuatai was finally overrun at noon on December 12.|$|E

The first person to buy a ticket and enter the park was David MacPherson with ticket number 2, as Roy O. Disney arranged to pre-purchase ticket number 1 from Curtis Lineberry, the manager of admissions. However, an official picture of Walt Disney and two children, Christine Vess Watkins (age 5) and Michael Schwartner (7), inaccurately identifies them as the first two guests of Disneyland. Both received lifetime passes to Disneyland that day, and MacPherson was awarded one shortly thereafter, which was later expanded <b>to</b> <b>every</b> <b>single</b> Disney-owned park in the world. Approximately 50,000 guests attended the Monday opening day.|$|E

25|$|Philosophical {{attempts}} to rationalize why different substances have different properties (color, density, smell), exist in different states (gaseous, liquid, and solid), and react {{in a different}} manner when exposed to environments, for example to water or fire or temperature changes, led ancient philosophers to postulate the first theories on nature and chemistry. The history of such philosophical theories that relate to chemistry can probably be traced back <b>to</b> <b>every</b> <b>single</b> ancient civilization. The common aspect in all these theories was the attempt to identify {{a small number of}} primary classical element that make up all the various substances in nature. Substances like air, water, and soil/earth, energy forms, such as fire and light, and more abstract concepts such as ideas, aether, and heaven, were common in ancient civilizations even in absence of any cross-fertilization; for example in Greek, Indian, Mayan, and ancient Chinese philosophies all considered air, water, earth and fire as primary elements.|$|E

In his review of the soundtrack, Game-OSTs Simon Smith called it [...] "a soft jazz song with sultry smooth vocals and a nice tune", and praised it despite it not becoming one of his favorites. Mike Wilson, writing for RPGFan, {{referred to it as}} [...] "possibly the most beautiful vocal I've ever heard in a video game."

Scenes of Rihanna performing a show in Ischgl and having snowball fight with hear team at the town's streets are shown.

500|$|Across her {{speaking}} appearances, Lightning is {{voiced by}} Ali Hillis in English and Maaya Sakamoto in Japanese. Sakamoto {{was impressed by}} Lightning, whom she called [...] "cold" [...] and [...] "strong". She was asked to portray Lightning's strength and to betray the character's hidden vulnerabilities. She initially found it strange to voice Lightning, as {{she was used to}} gentler roles such as Aerith Gainsborough, a central character in Final Fantasy VII and its companion media. Commenting on the difficulty of balancing Lightning's depiction as a woman and a professionally trained warrior, Kitase noted that Sakamoto's acting helped to bring out Lightning's femininity. Hillis was given the role of Lightning after speaking a few of the character's lines during audition, and was then given a book about the Final Fantasy XIII universe, which she found a little [...] "overwhelming" [...] when she read it. One of the challenges Hillis faced was recapturing the emotion and energy of Sakamoto's Japanese performance in the character's English rendition. She tried to help the staff of the XIII games portray Lightning as a real person: [...] "I think that was my main priority, to make sure that Lightning had every single layer of who she was as a person, not just a game character, but a real person with layers and history and relationships <b>to</b> <b>every</b> <b>single</b> character in the game...even the Chocobo!" [...] Over the course of the XIII trilogy, Hillis felt that Lightning becomes [...] "a little more sarcastic ... a little more hardened to everything that's going on around her and ... into a real warrior".|$|E

Additional seasons would then advance a year and examine a new case. Despite working on [...] at the same time, Markus and McFeely remained involved with the series after writing the first script. When the showrunners joined the series, they went on a [...] "mini-camp" [...] with Markus and McFeely to develop the series from a pilot script written by the pair. They looked to several different influences outside of Marvel in developing the series, including Raiders of the Lost Ark, L.A. Confidential, and the works of author James Ellroy. Elaborating on deviating from the comics, Fazekas said, for example, [...] "if we're using a minor character or a bad guy from an old comic book, we don't have to adhere to what that character was in that comic book from 1945. Because there are so many different iterations of a specific character, you can't be true <b>to</b> <b>every</b> <b>single</b> one." [...] ABC asked the producers to not have the series follow a [...] "Gadget of the Week or Bad Guy of the Week" [...] model, and instead focus on telling the story of Carter balancing her personal and professional lives. Fazekas called this [...] "such a nice change" [...] from previous television experience, with the group feeling free to drop whole story ideas in favor of focusing on the series' central storyline.|$|E

500|$|Russo was not {{involved}} in the selection of the sourced songs used throughout the show, with Hawley already knowing the songs he wanted to use and working with music supervisor Maggie Phillips to get the license for them. With the influence of Pink Floyd's music on both Hawley and Russo, Hawley wanted to use their music in the season's finale, as Phillips noted it [...] "never quite fit in the other episodes". He chose the songs [...] "Breathe" [...] and [...] "On the Run", as [...] "they flow into each other on the record. There’s no pause in between those songs. So {{there was no way to}} go with just one song." [...] This posed an issue with the series' budget that became the hardest licensing struggle for the series. Phillips described [...] "an extremely difficult negotiation process, but we were working with some great people that recognized what we were doing was interesting. We ended up getting a price that we were able to persuade FX was worth it. But, it took months." [...] The songs were confirmed on the day of the final sound mix for the show. In case the songs could not have been secured, Hawley asked Phillips to choose an alternative from the works of The Flaming Lips. Phillips said she was [...] "not a huge fan of Flaming Lips, but I listened <b>to</b> <b>every</b> <b>single</b> song they’ve ever done". They ultimately decided that none of the songs would work for the sequence, so Russo composed original music to replace the Pink Floyd songs if necessary.|$|E
