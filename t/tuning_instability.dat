These varactors have a curved cantilever electrode that is actuated by a single pull-down electrode. The shape of the cantilever is designed such that its local stiffness is tailored to enable extended stable zipping. In a series-mounted varactor, the measured capacitance ratio was 16. 5 for actuation voltages between 0 and 46 V. However, the presence of an unexpected <b>tuning</b> <b>instability</b> at 32 V bias limited the practical tuning range in this varactor. This behaviour was attributed to fabrication imperfections. The first electrical self-resonant frequency of the same varactor was extrapolated to be 72. 6 and 17. 2 GHz at 20 and 329 fF, respectively. In a different shunt-mounted varactor, the quality factor (Q) was measured to be 91 (60 fF) and 176 (600 fF) at 2 GHz.

40|$|Protein-protein {{interactions}} mediate a {{vast number}} of cellular processes. Here, we present a regulatory mechanism in protein-protein interactions mediated by finely <b>tuned</b> structural <b>instability</b> and coupled with molecular mimicry. We show that a set of type III secretion (TTS) autoinhibited homodimeric chaperones adopt a molten globule-like state that transiently exposes the substrate binding site as a means to become rapidly poised for binding to their cognate protein substrates. Packing defects at the homodimeric interface stimulate binding, whereas correction of these defects results in less labile chaperones that give rise to nonfunctional biological systems. The protein substrates use structural mimicry to offset the weak spots in the chaperones and to counteract their autoinhibitory conformation.

40|$|Reliable {{detection}} of developing transverse instabilities in the Large Hadron Collider {{is one of}} the main operational challenges of the LHC's high intensity proton run. A full machine snapshot provided from the moment of instability is a crucial input to develop and fine <b>tune</b> <b>instability</b> models.

40|$|Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplex (OFDM) {{systems are}} very {{sensitive}} to frequency offset caused by <b>tuning</b> oscillator <b>instabilities</b> and Doppler shifts induced by the channel. The Schmidl and Cox Algorithm (SCA) is quite robust in estimating the frequency offset for systems with large OFDM symbol lengths. It uses two OFDM symbols for training with the first one having two identical halves. The frequency offset is estimated by correlating a received sequence of samples equal to half the OFDM symbol length with the following received samples. The effect of Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) in the estimation process is mitigated only if the number of samples used in the correlation, and hence the OFDM symbol size is large. However to be successfully applied to Broadband Fixed Wireless Access (BFWA) systems, OFDM should perform well even with smaller symbol lengths. In this paper we present the Residual Frequency Offset Correction Algorithm (RFOCA), which uses the SCA for initial frequency offset acquisition and follows it with a stage which reduces the initial residual frequency offset by tracking the phase of the decoded data.

Based on the self-consistent Vlasov-Poisson equations the dispersion relations of transverse multipole oscillations with quadrupolar, sextupolar and octupolar symmetry are solved numerically. The eigenfrequencies give the coherent space charge tune shift for linear or nonlinear resonances in circular accelerators. We find that for sufficiently large energy anisotropy some of the eigenmodes become unstable in the space-charge-dominated regime.

To alleviate these issues, we suggest a new approach and framework for mining sequential rule patterns for classification purpose. We introduce a space of rule pattern models and a prior distribution defined on this model space. From this model space, we define a Bayesian criterion for evaluating the interest of sequential patterns. We also develop a parameter-free algorithm to efficiently mine sequential patterns from the model space. Extensive experiments show that (i) the new criterion identifies interesting and robust patterns, (ii) the direct use of the mined rules as new features in a classification process demonstrates higher inductive performance than the state-of-the-art sequential pattern based classifiers...|$|R

Currently the STB ring is routinely operated with a booster-storage mode to supply high energy γ-rays for nuclear study produced via Bremsstrahlung using an internal target wire. Since finite range of a tagging counter array mounted in a bending section, the booster has to be also operated at another flat-top energy lower than 1. 2 GeV to extend the γ-ray energy toward lower side. Because characteristics of the STB ring have not been well understood, various beam properties such as betatron <b>tunes</b> and <b>instabilities</b> are not completely controlled at the moment. In order to improve performance of the machine and to study the beam dynamics in a circular accelerator, fundamental properties of the STB ring is now being measured. 1 LNS ACCELERATOR COMPLEX An injector S-band linac consisted with 19 accelerating structures provides multi-bunch beam with a long-pulse duration of 1 ~ 3 µs.

40|$|Wind turbine load {{alleviation}} {{has traditionally been}} addressed in the literature using either full-span pitch control, which has limited bandwidth, or trailing-edge flap control, which typically shows low control authority due to actuation constraints. This paper combines both methods and demonstrates the feasibility and advantages of such a combined control strategy on a scaled prototype {{in a series of}} wind tunnel tests. The pitchable blades of the test turbine are instrumented with free-floating flaps close to the tip, designed such that they aerodynamically magnify the low stroke of high-bandwidth actuators. The additional degree of freedom leads to aeroelastic coupling with the blade flexible modes. The inertia of the flaps was <b>tuned</b> such that <b>instability</b> occurs just beyond the operational envelope of the wind turbine; the system can however be stabilised using collocated closed-loop control.

40|$|An {{intelligent}} fault-tolerant {{control system}} for an {{unmanned aerial vehicle}} was developed {{that was designed to}} be capable of tolerating a number of different control actuator faults. The development of the control system focused on the simulation of the system using a nonlinear flight dynamic model with the aim to implement this control strategy in an operational UAS in the future. The nonlinear flight dynamic model was a high fidelity, six-degree-of-freedom model that made use of available wind tunnel data. The model considered the general equations of motion of an asymmetric rigid aircraft within the troposphere and also considered motor, and control actuator dynamics. The proposed control strategy consisted of a model reference fuzzy logic adaption algorithm combined with a daisy chain allocation algorithm. An equivalent desired first order behaviour was used to generate an ideal response to a control input and used as a reference for the adaption algorithm to follow. The allocation algorithm made use of secondary and tertiary control effectors that were used only after the primary control surface reached its physical limits of travel. A number of control actuator failures, of varying severity, were modelled that included elevator failures, aileron failures and combined aileron and elevator failures. The results showed the proposed control system was better able to tolerate the simulated failures when compared to the unmodified autopilot. For more severe failures {{it was found that the}} control allocation algorithm was a necessity and in some cases the adaption algorithm when used in isolation, induced control <b>instability.</b> <b>Tuning</b> of the adaption rates of the adaption algorithm was found to have a significant effect on the performance of the system.

It was, however, concluded that the proposed control strategy did provide a degree of fault-tolerance for the failure scenarios considered. It is recommended that research into the effects of adaption rates, auxiliary control functions (such as feedforward loops) and the use of health monitoring be considered for a more practical system. It is also recommended that extensive testing be conducted with hardware in the loop simulators before this system be implemented...|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} results of {{experiments}} on a 'fast beam-ion instability' at the Advanced Light Source (ALS). This ion instability, which can arise even when the ions are not trapped over multiple beam passages, will likely be important for many future accelerators. In our experiments, we filled the ALS storage ring with helium gas, raising the pressure approximately two orders of magnitude above the nominal pressure. With gaps in the bunch train large enough to avoid conventional (multi-turn) ion trapping, we observed a factor of 2 - 3 increase in the vertical beam size along with coherent beam oscillations which increased along the bunch train. Ion trapping has long been recognized as a potential limitation in electron storage rings. The ions, generated by beam-gas collisions, become trapped in the negative potential of the beam and accumulate over multiple beam passages. The trapped ions are then observed to cause a number of deleterious effects such as an increasing beam phase space, a broadening and shifting of the beam transverse oscillation frequencies (<b>tunes),</b> collective beam <b>instabilities,</b> and beam lifetime reductions. All of these effects are {{of concern for the}} next generation of accelerators, such as the B-factories or damping rings for future linear colliders, which will store high beam currents with closely spaced bunches and ultra-low beam emittances. One of the standard solutions used to prevent ion trapping is to include a gap in the bunch train which is long compared to the bunch spacing. In this case, the ions are first strongly-focused by the passing electron bunches and then over-focused in the gap. With a sufficiently large gap, the ions can be driven to large amplitudes where they form a diffuse halo and do not affect the beam. In this paper, we describe experiments that study a new regime of transient ion instabilities predicted to arise in future electron storage rings, and linacs with bunch trains. These future rings and linacs, which will be operated with higher beam currents, small transverse beam emittances, and long bunch trains, will use ion clearing gaps to prevent conventional ion trapping. But, while the ion clearing gap may suppress the conventional ion instabilities, it will not suppress a transient beam-ion instability where ions generated and trapped during the passage of a single train lead to a fast instability. While both conventional and transient ion instabilities have the same origin, namely ions produced by the beam, they have different manifestations and, more importantly, the new transient instability can arise even after the conventional ion instability is cured. This new instability is called the 'Fast Beam-Ion Instability' (FBII). In many future rings, the FBII is predicted to have very fast growth rates, much faster than the damping rates of existing and proposed transverse feedback systems, and thus is a potential limitation. To study the FBII, we performed experiments at the ALS, a 1. 5 GeV electron storage ring. At the nominal ALS pressure of about 0. 24 nTorr, the FBII is not evident. To study the instability, we intentionally added helium gas to the storage-ring vacuum system until the residual gas pressure was increased about 80 nTorr. This brought the predicted growth rate of the instability at least an order of magnitude above the growth rate of conventional multibunch instabilities driven by the RF cavities and above the damping rate of the transverse feedback system (TFB) in the ALS and, thereby, established conditions very similar to those in a future storage ring. We then filled the ring with a relatively short train of bunches, suppressing conventional ion instabilities. In the following, we will first briefly describe This paper describes the experiment and results in more detail...|$|R
