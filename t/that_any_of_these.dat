5|$|According to Plutarch, an army under Parmenion {{defeated}} the Illyrian king Grabos in 356 BC, {{shortly after the}} conclusion of the siege of Potidea. Grabos then became a subject ally of Macedon. The following year, Philip seems to have defeated Ketriporis, and reduced him to the status of a subject ally, although information for this campaign is very limited. He is also presumed to have {{defeated the}} Paionians at some point during this period, although there is no explicit record of this.

5|$|The use of {{elephants}} in circuses {{has also been}} controversial; the Humane Society of the United States has accused circuses of mistreating and distressing their animals. In testimony to a US federal court in 2009, Barnum & Bailey Circus CEO Kenneth Feld acknowledged that circus elephants are struck behind their ears, under their chins and on their legs with metal-tipped prods, called bull hooks or ankus. Feld stated that these practices are necessary to protect circus workers and acknowledged that an elephant trainer was reprimanded for using an electric shock device, known as a hot shot or electric prod, on an elephant. Despite this, he denied <b>that</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> practices harm elephants. Some trainers have tried to train elephants {{without the use of}} physical punishment. Ralph Helfer is known to have relied on gentleness and reward when training his animals, including elephants and lions.

25|$|Like many eastern spices, pepper was {{historically}} both a seasoning and a folk medicine. Long pepper, being stronger, {{was often}} the preferred medication, but both were used. Black pepper (or perhaps long pepper) was believed to cure several illnesses, such as constipation, insomnia, oral abscesses, sunburn and toothaches, among others. Various sources from the 5th century onward recommended pepper to treat eye problems, often by applying salves or poultices made with pepper directly to the eye. There is no current medical evidence <b>that</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> treatments has any benefit.|$|E
25|$|Many known {{complexity}} {{classes are}} suspected to be unequal, {{but this has}} not been proved. For instance P ⊆ NP ⊆ PP ⊆ PSPACE, but it is possible that P = PSPACE. If P is not equal to NP, then P is not equal to PSPACE either. Since there are many known complexity classes between P and PSPACE, such as RP, BPP, PP, BQP, MA, PH, etc., it is possible that all these complexity classes collapse to one class. Proving <b>that</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> classes are unequal would be a major breakthrough in complexity theory.|$|E

Although the MCC team included some notable county cricket players such as Mick Norman, John Barclay, Dan Piachaud and Nigel Popplewell, their matches on the 1976–77 tour were not first-class.

25|$|On October 7, 1822, Judge Elihu Bay convicted {{four white}} men for a {{misdemeanor}} in inciting slaves to insurrection during the Denmark Vesey slave conspiracy. These four white men were William Allen, John Igneshias, Andrew S. Rhodes, and Jacob Danders; they {{were sentenced to}} varied fines and reasonably short jail time. Historians have found no evidence <b>that</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> men was a known abolitionist; they {{do not seem to}} have had contact with each other or any of the plotters of the rebellion. William Allen received twelve months in prison and a $1,000 fine, which was the harshest punishment of the four. When tried in court, Allen admitted to trying to help the slave conspiracy, but said that he did so because he was promised a large sum of money for his services. Reports from the judge show that the court believed that Allen was motivated by greed rather than any sympathy for the slaves.|$|E
25|$|Several other {{ambulance}} services exist within Louisville-Jefferson County such as Anchorage EMS. Anchorage EMS is an ambulance taxing district (as {{well as a}} fire protection taxing district) that serves the City of Anchorage as well as eastern Jefferson County with advanced life support services. Other, private ambulance agencies such as Rural/Metro Corporation and Yellow EMS provide services for parts of areas near by or within Jefferson County. For example, the City of Jeffersontown in southeastern Jefferson County has for years outsourced its EMS needs. Currently a contract exists with Yellow EMS (YEMS) to provide emergency medical services within the Jeffersontown city limits. YEMS also provides additional assistance during extremely high call volume times to LMEMS and responds to many of LMEMS' low-priority calls. Although these jurisdictions maintain their own ambulance providers, Louisville-Jefferson County government is ultimately responsible for ensuring emergency care is available {{and in the case}} <b>that</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> providers cannot operate, LMEMS will ensure a response.|$|E

500|$|Ancient Indian, Greek, Egyptian, Babylonian and Chinese {{observers}} knew of Venus {{and recorded}} the planet's motions.

Venus was important to ancient American civilizations, in particular for the Maya, who called it Noh Ek, [...] "the Great Star" [...] or Xux Ek, [...] "the Wasp Star"; they embodied Venus {{in the form of the}} god Kukulkán (also known as or related to Gukumatz and Quetzalcoatl in other parts of Mexico). In the Dresden Codex, the Maya charted Venus's full cycle, but despite their precise knowledge of its course, there is no mention of a transit.

500|$|The name Gaius occurs {{three other}} {{times in the}} New Testament.

Next, a Gaius is mentioned residing in Corinth as being {{one of only a}} few people there (the others being Crispus and the household of Stephanas) who were baptised by Paul, who founded the Church in that city (1 Corinthians 1:14). Lastly, a Gaius is referred to in a final greeting portion of the Epistle to the Romans (Romans 16:23) as Paul's [...] "host" [...] and also host of the whole church, in whatever city Paul is writing from at the time (probably Corinth).
