50|$|In 1975, {{the city}} {{purchased}} five <b>thousand</b> <b>kilowatt</b> <b>hours</b> of electricity from Louisiana Power and Light Company to supplement energy needs at the municipally owned power plant. In June 1977, Patterson vetoed an ordinance passed {{a week earlier}} by the city council which would have allocated $100,000 for cost adjustments in city utility bills. Patterson said that his objection to the ordinance was not because he opposed lowering utility bills. Instead, he claimed that the law would have mainly aided high KWH users, was fiscally unsound, and would not likely have encouraged the conservation of energy.|$|E
50|$|All the SI prefixes are {{commonly}} {{applied to the}} watt hour: a kilowatt hour is 1,000 W⋅h (symbols kW⋅h, kWh or kW h; a megawatt hour is 1 million W⋅h, (symbols MW⋅h, MWh or MW h); a milliwatt hour is 1/1000 W⋅h (symbols mW⋅h, mWh or mW h) and so on.The kilowatt hour is commonly used by electrical distribution providers for purposes of billing, since the monthly energy consumption of a typical residential customer ranges from a few hundred to a few <b>thousand</b> <b>kilowatt</b> <b>hours.</b> Megawatt hours (MWh), gigawatt hours (GWh), and terawatt hours (TWh) are often used for metering larger amounts of electrical energy to industrial customers and in power generation. The terawatt hour and petawatt hour (PWh) units are large enough to conveniently express the annual electricity generation for whole countries and the world energy consumption.|$|E

50|$|According to {{statistics}} {{compiled by the}} South Korean agency Statistics Korea based on International Energy Agency (IEA) data, per capita electricity consumption fell from its peak in 1990 of 1247 <b>kilowatt</b> <b>hours</b> {{to a low of}} 712 <b>kilowatt</b> <b>hours</b> in 2000.

25|$|Economically, {{electric}} heat can {{be compared}} to other sources of home heating by multiplying the local cost per <b>kilowatt</b> <b>hour</b> for electricity by the number of kilowatts the heater uses. E.g.: 1500-watt heater at 12 cents per <b>kilowatt</b> <b>hour</b> 1.5×12=18 cents per hour.

50|$|The <b>kilowatt</b> <b>hour</b> (symbol kWh, kW⋅h or kW h) is a {{derived unit}} of energy equal to 3.6 megajoules. If the energy is being {{transmitted}} or used at a constant rate (power) {{over a period of}} time, the total energy in <b>kilowatt</b> <b>hours</b> is the power in kilowatts multiplied by the time in <b>hours.</b> The <b>kilowatt</b> <b>hour</b> is commonly used as a billing unit for energy delivered to consumers by electric utilities.|$|R

50|$|By {{converting}} cow manure into methane biogas via anaerobic digestion, {{the millions}} of cattle in the United States {{would be able to}} produce 100 billion <b>kiloWatt</b> <b>hours</b> of electricity, enough to power millions of homes across the United States.
