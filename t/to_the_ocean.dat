5|$|In Mananjary {{where the}} cyclone moved ashore, Alibera {{produced}} gusts of 250km/h (150mph). There, nearly every building was damaged or destroyed, including hospitals, government offices, and schools. About 80% of houses were destroyed. The cyclone {{shut down the}} city's water system, disrupted access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ocean,</b> cut communications, and blocked or damaged most roads. There were 15deaths in Mananjary alone. The storm damage in Mananjary prevented ships from delivering supplies. Residents in the region considered the storm {{to be the worst}} since 1925.|$|E

5|$|Observations of {{the surface}} have {{revealed}} {{that some of the}} molecular oxygen produced by radiolysis is not ejected from the surface. Because the surface may interact with the subsurface ocean (considering the geological discussion above), this molecular oxygen may make its way <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ocean,</b> where it could aid in biological processes. One estimate suggests that, given the turnover rate inferred from the apparent ~0.5 Gyr maximum age of Europa's surface ice, subduction of radiolytically generated oxidizing species might well lead to oceanic free oxygen concentrations that are comparable to those in terrestrial deep oceans.|$|E

5|$|The flora of {{the island}} {{is typical of the}} Outer Hebrides with heather, {{sphagnum}} moss, sedges, grass and bracken predominating. There is but a single tree– a 2-metre high poplar on a cliff overlooking Mingulay Bay. Sea holly, otherwise rare in the Western Isles, has grown on Mingulay since at least the late nineteenth century, and sea milkwort, normally only found at sea level is able to grow on the high cliff tops due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> spray and seagull manure. In spring and summer there are profusions of wild flowers around the deserted Village.|$|E
5|$|All {{but four}} of the streams lie within the large basin of the Columbia River, {{although}} the river itself does not flow through Idaho. Consequently, the predominant direction of the state's streamflow is northwest towards the Columbia River and its mouth at the Pacific Ocean. The only other major drainage basin in Idaho is the Great Salt Lake watershed in the state's southeastern corner, {{which is part of}} the Great Basin and has no outlet <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ocean.</b> The Bear River, the second-longest stream, is within this watershed, along with the Malad River, Deep Creek, and the Logan River.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{watertight}} bulkheads extended {{well above}} the water line, they were not sealed at the top. If too many compartments were flooded, the ship's bow would settle deeper in the water, and water would spill from one compartment to the next in sequence, rather like water spilling {{across the top of}} an ice cube tray. This was what happened to Titanic, which had suffered damage to the forepeak tank, the three forward holds and No.6 boiler room, a total of five compartments. Titanic was only designed to float with any two compartments flooded, but it could remain afloat with certain combinations of three or even four compartments (the first four) open <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ocean.</b> With five compartments, the tops of the bulkheads would be submerged and the ship would continue to flood.|$|E

5|$|Changes of {{sediment}} {{patterns in the}} creek have also created another problem. Stemming from the construction of structures interfering with stream flow, and increased runoff from the urban areas adjoining the creek, excessive erosion has created problems not limited to just the creek. The creek is eroding material from its bed and transporting it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ocean,</b> but naturally, sediment from the whole watershed flowed towards the main stem via a complex network of tributaries. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers warned in a 1997 study that up to $4.2million in damage occurs per year {{as a result of}} the pollution of Aliso Creek and its neighbor San Juan Creek. This includes physical damage to creek banks, bridges, pipes and other creekside structures.|$|E
5|$|Doctor Neo Cortex and his {{assistant}} Doctor Nitrus Brio create the Evolvo-Ray, a device they use to mutate the various animals living on the islands into beasts with superhuman strength. They experiment on Crash, a peaceful bandicoot who Cortex intends {{to be the leader}} of his growing military of animal soldiers. Despite Brio's warnings, Cortex subjects Crash to the untested Cortex Vortex in an attempt to control him. The Vortex rejects Crash, allowing him to escape. After Crash leaps out a window and falls <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> below, Cortex prepares a female bandicoot named Tawna for experimentation.|$|E
5|$|Growth is slow, and the veligers {{are carried}} by the ocean {{currents}} for up to 14 weeks. As the veligers mature, they develop their first shell (the smooth protoconch) and turn into very small juvenile snails, at which point they sink <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> floor. As {{is the case in}} all shelled mollusks, the mantle is what secretes the shell; shell growth begins at what will later become the apex of the shell, and typically rotates clockwise. As the animal gradually matures, the mantle continues to secrete shell material. Scotch bonnets complete maturation in one to six years. However, some have lived more than six years.|$|E

50|$|Endorheic lakes are {{bodies of}} water that do not flow into the sea. Most of the water falling on Earth finds its way <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>oceans</b> through a network of rivers, lakes and wetlands. However, there is a class of water bodies that are located in closed or endorheic {{watersheds}} where the topography prevents their drainage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>oceans.</b> These endorheic watersheds (containing water in rivers or lakes that form a balance of surface inflows, evaporation and seepage) are often called terminal lakes or sink lakes.|$|R
5|$|Human {{habitation}} on the Santa Ana River {{dates back}} 9,000 to 12,000 years ago, {{close to the}} early stages of the Holocene period. The first Native Americans to live in the area were nomadic tribes that traveled from place to place, grazing animals on fertile grasslands and gathering fruits and seeds for food. The ancestors of these early people originated from the Shoshone and Uto-Aztecan people of the northwestern United States. Eventually, the human population of the watershed reached a peak of about 15,000. About 8,000 years ago, the climate experienced a change becoming more arid and the originally nomadic tribes began to stay in individual places longer, becoming semi-nomadic. However, they did not establish agriculture, nor did they raise animals or live in villages. Like many Native American tribes in California, acorns were a staple food of many of the inland valley people. People closer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> often fished and hunted small animals, often from tide pools and coastal stream areas, for food.|$|E
5|$|Ledbury {{was engaged}} in escorting major {{warships}} and Fleet auxiliaries in the North Sea until late June 1942, when she was attached <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> escort of the convoy PQ17. Mariners that took part in convoys delivering supplies to Russia remember vividly the biting cold and the continual fear of attack by air or sea. The supplies were vital in that they were needed to keep Russia in the war following her invasion by German forces in 1941. The PQ17 convoy, which left Iceland {{at the end of}} June 1942, is known particularly for the tremendous losses among the merchant ships.|$|E
5|$|Like most of Southern California, the {{majority}} of San Diego's current area was originally occupied by chaparral, a plant community made up mostly of drought-resistant shrubs. The endangered Torrey pine has the bulk of its population in San Diego in a stretch of protected chaparral along the coast. The steep and varied topography and proximity <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> create {{a number of different}} habitats within the city limits, including tidal marsh and canyons. The chaparral and coastal sage scrub habitats in low elevations along the coast are prone to wildfire, and the rates of fire have increased in the 20th century, due primarily to fires starting near the borders of urban and wild areas.|$|E
