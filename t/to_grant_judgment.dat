CASE SUMMARY PROCEDURAL POSTURE: Plaintiffs, members of an environmental group, filed a motion for summary judgment, and two defendants, a president of a corporation and a president of a bank, filed cross-motions for summary judgment in their individual capacities in the action filed by the group in which the group asked defendants {{to take a look}} at the impact greenhouse gases had on the domestic environment. The action was filed under National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). OVERVIEW: The group generally alleged that defendants had provided, and continued to provide, financial support to international fossil fuel projects that emitted greenhouse gases. The group sought an injunction against defendants and a declaration that their programs were in violation of the NEPA. Defendants argued that the court had <b>to</b> <b>grant</b> <b>judgment</b> in their favor because the group improperly sought to apply NEPA to projects that were located in foreign countries. The court rejected the argument, finding that the claims did not involve extraterritoria...|$|E

A primary example of this was Grant's interference with Meade's direction of Maj. Gen. Philip Sheridan's Cavalry Corps.

Meade reported the conversation <b>to</b> <b>Grant,</b> who replied, [...] "Well, he generally knows what he is talking about. Let him start right out and do it."

The raid was less successful than hoped; although his raid managed to mortally wound Confederate cavalry commander Maj. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart at Yellow Tavern on May 11 and beat Maj. Gen. Fitzhugh Lee at Meadow Bridge on May 12, the raid never seriously threatened Richmond and it left Grant without cavalry intelligence for Spotsylvania and North Anna. Historian Gordon C. Rhea wrote, [...] "By taking his cavalry from Spotsylvania Court House, Sheridan severely handicapped Grant in his battles against Lee. The Union Army was deprived of his eyes and ears during a critical juncture in the campaign. And Sheridan's decision to advance boldly to the Richmond defenses smacked of unnecessary showboating that jeopardized his command." ...|$|R

40|$|Prepared for a {{symposium}} about the overuse of summary judgment in employment discrimination cases, this Article provides a grassroots empirical {{analysis of what}} is happening in equal pay cases {{on the front lines of}} the district courts.

Courts granted 68 % of summary judgment motions in equal pay cases—meaning that only about one-third of equal pay claims get past the dispositive motion “starting gate. ” In many cases, judges improperly <b>granted</b> summary <b>judgment</b> when material factual disputes existed about the prima facie standard of “equal work” and the credibility of the employer’s defenses. In other cases, the very structure of the EPA—especially courts’ overly strict interpretation of “equal work” and liberal application of the “factor other than sex” defense—caused it to be an ineffective remedy for modern pay discrimination...|$|R

50|$|In Waldman v. Stone, 698 F.3d 910 (6th Cir. 2012), the Sixth Circuit held, in {{an opinion}} by Judge Kethledge, that {{bankruptcy}} courts lack constitutional authority to enter final judgment on a state-law claim brought by a debtor {{to augment the}} estate, even where both parties consent to resolution by a bankruptcy court. The Sixth Circuit concluded that <b>to</b> <b>grant</b> final <b>judgment</b> on those claims would be to exercise the judicial power of the United States, which bankruptcy judges may not do because they lack the life tenure and salary protection guaranteed by Article III of the Constitution, and this infringement on {{the separation of powers}} cannot be waived by private litigants.

50|$|Whatever {{the grounds}} {{on which the}} {{rescission}} of a judgment may be sought at common law, it is abundantly clear, the court found, that at common law any cause of action relied on {{as a ground for}} setting aside a final judgment, must have existed at the date of the final judgment. There must be some causal connection between the circumstances which give rise to the claim for rescission and the judgment. If a judgment is obtained in respect of a disposition not for value, no ground exists for setting aside such judgment merely because the disposition was not made for value and it is proved that, immediately after such disposition, the judgment debtor's liabilities exceeded his assets. It is only if insolvency or liquidation supervenes that such a disposition acquires legal significance by reason of the provisions of section 26 of the Insolvency Act, read with, {{in the case of a}} company, section 181 of the Companies Act But it does not follow that a judgment in respect of such a disposition can on that account be set aside under common law, for, when the <b>judgment</b> was <b>granted,</b> no grounds existed for setting it aside.

40|$|This Case Note {{examines}} {{the doctrine of}} standing {{in light of the}} Fifth Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s decision in Friends of the Earth v. Crown Central Petroleum. The Crown Central decision addressed whether the environmental organization, Friends of the Earth (FOE), met the requirements of standing necessary to bring a lawsuit under the Clean Water Act. The Fifth Circuit in Crown Central seems to have created a new requirement for establishing the 2 ̆ 2 fairly traceable 2 ̆ 2 prong of the standing analysis. On a summary judgment motion, the Fifth Circuit denied standing to FOE because it did not present scientific evidence to establish an 2 ̆ 2 injury-in-fact. 2 ̆ 2 This Case Note argues that the Fifth Circuit misapplied the 2 ̆ 2 injury- in-fact 2 ̆ 2 analysis and improperly denied standing to FOE. This Case Note discusses the general background of the CWA, and the doctrine of standing as it applies to plaintiffs in environmental cases. Part III discusses the facts, procedural history, holding and reasoning of the Fifth Circuit in Crown Central. Part IV of this Case Note analyzes the court of appeals decision in Crown Central, and establishes that it had no basis upon which <b>to</b> <b>grant</b> summary <b>judgment</b> in favor of the defendant. This Case Note concludes that environmental organizations and citizens deserve an expanded doctrine of standing because the surrogate enforcer should be allowed to stand up for the environment and oppose those who blatantly violate our environmental laws...|$|R
