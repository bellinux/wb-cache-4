5|$|Most of the {{structures}} that make up animals, plants and microbes are made from three basic classes of molecule: amino acids, carbohydrates and lipids (often called fats). As these molecules are vital for life, metabolic reactions either focus on making these molecules during the construction of cells and tissues, or by breaking <b>them</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> using them {{as a source of}} energy, by their digestion. These biochemicals can be joined together to make polymers such as DNA and proteins, essential macromolecules of life.|$|E
5|$|Once Allied {{troops were}} on the ground, some German units used the Rommelspargel for defense, by cutting <b>them</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> using the logs to {{reinforce}} impromptu positions. Sturmmann Karl Vasold of the 12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend described how his unit dug in under fire in a tank trench and foxholes on the road from Buron to Villons-les-Buissons, and used cut-down Rommelspargel poles to cover their positions and protect them from enemy fire.|$|E

5|$|At the Springfield Derby, Duncan {{wins the}} race. Enraged, the furious jockeys chase after Homer and Bart {{wielding}} swords to hunt <b>them</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> destroy them. With {{the help of}} Marge and Lisa, who spray water on the jockeys with a hose, Homer is able to put the jockeys into a garbage bag and get them sent to the dump. Afterwards, Homer and Bart prepare for Duncan's retirement from racing {{to start a new}} life as a stud. President Clinton then shows up at the Simpsons's house to see Lisa, presenting her with a plaque. Clinton says that Ogdenville was wrong to use glowsticks and that Springfield Elementary's band is the true champion.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the change}} in career, the stalker (Doug Hutchison) catches up with Black, {{kidnapping}} Catherine. Black is able to track <b>them</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> rescue Catherine, stabbing the stalker {{to death in the}} process. Disturbed by both the abduction and Black's rage, Catherine moves out of their family home with Jordan for a time. Before they can reconcile, Catherine dies in a virus outbreak orchestrated by the Millennium Group, who Black discovers are attempting to control the possibility {{of the end of the}} world at the turn of the millennium. Disgusted by the group's motives and actions, Black breaks rank and returns to work with the FBI in order to take them down.|$|E
5|$|Murray {{skipped the}} World Group 1st round tie against Argentina, over fears he could {{exacerbate}} a knee injury, leaving the British {{team in a}} hopeless situation – they lost 4–1. Jamie was furious that Andy was letting <b>them</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> the Murrays would not {{speak to each other}} for two weeks. Seven months later, as the brothers prepared for the tie against Austria, Andy declared that he had healed the rift with Jamie. When Jamie Murray and Ross Hutchins were beaten in the doubles, John Lloyd suffered criticism for not playing Andy. Great Britain lost their World Group play-off to Austria 3–2 and were relegated to Europe/Africa Zone Group I.|$|E

5|$|Ferret-legging was an {{endurance}} test or stunt in which ferrets {{were trapped in}} trousers worn by a participant. Also known as put <b>'em</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> ferret-down-trousers, {{it seems to have}} been popular among coal miners in Yorkshire, England. Contestants put live ferrets inside their trousers; the winner is the one who is the last to release the animals. The world record is five hours and thirty minutes.|$|R
5|$|The Great Raid of 1840 was {{the largest}} Indian raid on white cities {{in the history of}} what is now the United States—though {{technically}} when it occurred it was in the Republic of Texas and not in the United States. The war party literally burned one city to the ground. They took over 3,000 horses and mules, {{and hundreds of thousands of}} dollars of other plunder, ranging from silver to cloth and mirrors. Unfortunately for the war party, the sheer volume of loot slowed <b>them</b> <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> made them vulnerable to attack from a militia that otherwise would never have caught them. Equally, the militia missed an opportunity to destroy the bulk of the raiding party when they concentrated on recovering and dividing the recovered bullion and other plunder.|$|E
5|$|After the Ottoman {{failure at}} the Battle of Vienna (11–12 September 1683), {{the people of}} Ravni Kotari and Kninska Krajina {{assembled}} {{under the leadership of}} Stojan's brother Ilija Janković and attacked the Ottomans. Pivljanin and his brother joined the band. The Venetians, in order to avoid a war, recalled Stojan Janković to Venice in October, calming Ilija, who is described as very restless and unmanageable. Dalmatian provveditore Lorenzo Dona sent colonel Ivan Radoš to the hajduks to calm <b>them</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> return them home. Radoš informed Dona on 10 November 1683 that he had met with Pivljanin, Vid Kalinić and Andrija Gilim at Kula Atlagića, who asked him to forward their request of forgiveness to the provveditore, then summoned Ilija Janković and Jovan Baljak. They all promised to follow Dona's command and stop hostility against Ottomans. When the hajduks calmed down by which time much of northern Dalmatia was in their handsthe Venetians returned Stojan to Ravni Kotari in December. In a letter dated 8December 1683, provveditore Dona forgave Pivljanin for desertion, and ordered his return in the list of cavalry bands which he had been part of, and gave him back wages for the intervening time.|$|E
5|$|During a {{time when}} they are both {{particularly}} vulnerable, Dimitri and Edmund's wife, Maria, sleep together. When Maria finds out she is pregnant, they have a DNA test done. Skye Chandler, who is in love with Edmund, tampers with test so it will show Dimitri is the father when it is in fact Edmund. After Maria confesses everything, a devastated Edmund tells Dimitri that he is dead to him and he will be bringing the child up as his own. Maria gives birth to a baby girl named Maddie and is later presumed dead in a plane crash. Dimitri discovers that Edmund is Maddie's father when he finds out their blood types do not match. He takes her to Vadzel, but Edmund tracks <b>them</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> takes back custody of Maddie. The brothers remain estranged for quite some time, but eventually manage to reconcile. Dimitri leaves Pine Valley permanently in 2001 with his current wife, Alex Devane.|$|E

5|$|Prompt Payment and Stealing a Ride are two 1911 American silent short comedy films {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. Prompt Payment focuses on a lawyer who evades his creditors, dons a disguise and plays against them {{in a game of}} poker. After winning a large sum of money from them, he excuses himself and returns to pay them with their own money. Stealing a Ride is listed as a comedy, but has a clear dramatic element. Susie and Johnnie are out sledding when Susie's parents are about to go out for a sleigh drive. The children ask to come along, but are refused. The children hitch their sleds {{to the back of the}} sleigh and follow along, only to fall off and get lost in the woods. The parents later track <b>them</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> bring them home. Both films were released together on a single reel on January 27, 1911 and were met with praise by critics. Both films are presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|Homer, {{who still}} wants to party, rents an airboat and forces his family to come with him. He races through a swamp, accidentally killing the state's most famous {{resident}} and reptile – an alligator named Captain Jack, whom Marge, Maggie, Lisa, and Bart saw on a tour earlier while Homer made a fool of himself at the concert. A sheriff quickly arrives {{on the scene and}} despite the fact that Homer is the sole guilty culprit, the entire family is charged for killing the alligator. The family members flee from the sheriff and during a car chase they are hit by a train that pushes their car on the rail for several miles. When the Simpsons get off of the rail, they escape to a restaurant where they are given employment. They live in a nearby trailer and progressively turn into hillbillies. The sheriff eventually tracks <b>them</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> kidnaps them while they are sleeping. For their crimes (and Homer's foolish attempt at defending himself in court), the family is put into forced labor. One night when they are working at a party held by a judge in front of the capitol, tending to the guests (and failing to escape), Captain Jack strolls out of the capitol's doors. It turns out that he was never dead but rather knocked out. The family is acquitted, though they are banned from entering the state of Florida again (and several other states, excluding Arizona and North Dakota).|$|E

25|$|The game {{is similar}} to Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit. Players race down freeways until they meet a police car. The police then try to chase <b>them</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> wreck their car.
