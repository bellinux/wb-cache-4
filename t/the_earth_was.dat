5|$|Irving's {{writings}} on Columbus are {{a mixture of}} history and fiction, a genre now called romantic history. Irving based them on extensive research in the Spanish archives, but also added imaginative elements aimed at sharpening the story. The first of these works {{is the source of}} the durable myth that medieval Europeans believed <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>was</b> flat. (See Myth of the flat earth.) According to the popular book, Columbus proved <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>was</b> round.|$|E
5|$|Another early {{application}} of the Reuleaux triangle, by Leonardo da Vinci circa 1514 (or possibly {{by one of his}} followers at his direction), was a world map in which the spherical surface of <b>the</b> <b>earth</b> <b>was</b> divided into eight octants, each flattened into the shape of a Reuleaux triangle.|$|E
5|$|Another pet project Johnson {{supported}} {{was prompted}} by his friendship with John Cleves Symmes, Jr., who proposed that <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>was</b> hollow. In 1823, Johnson proposed in the Senate that the government fund an expedition {{to the center of}} the Earth. The proposal was soundly defeated, receiving only twenty-five votes in the House and Senate combined.|$|E

5|$|Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>was</b> {{released}} on October 24, 2005 for the Xbox, and on March 27, 2006 for the PC. The game contains {{a number of}} software bugs, which have never been officially patched; these bugs are generally intermittent, and restoring from an earlier saved game can be enough to get past them. There is also an unofficial patch available that fixes some glitches and lowers the game's overall difficulty level. The Xbox version is officially compatible with the Xbox 360 in certain regions.|$|E
5|$|For natural uranium, about 49% of its {{alpha rays}} are emitted {{by each of}} 238U atom, and also 49% by 234U (since the latter is formed from the former) and about 2.0% of them by the 235U. When <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>was</b> young, {{probably}} about one-fifth of its uranium was uranium-235, but the percentage of 234U was probably much lower than this.|$|E
5|$|In {{development}} since 1999, {{the project}} was repeatedly delayed, going through several revisions and having {{some of its most}} ambitious and immersive features abandoned and the initially planned PlayStation 2 version cancelled. Although well received by most critics and regarded by some {{as one of the best}} horror video games of all time, Dark Corners of <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>was</b> a commercial failure. At least two additional Cthulhu Mythos games were planned by Headfirst Productions, including a direct sequel titled Call of Cthulhu: Destiny's End, but both were never completed due to Headfirst's bankruptcy.|$|E
50|$|Likewise, {{believing that}} <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>is</b> a sphere is less wrong than believing that <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>is</b> flat, but wrong nonetheless, {{since it is}} really an oblate {{spheroid}} or a reasonable approximation thereof. As the state of knowledge advanced, the statement of <b>the</b> <b>Earth's</b> shape became more refined, and each successive advance required a more careful and subtle investigation. Equating the wrongness of the theory that <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>is</b> flat with <b>the</b> wrongness of the theory that <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>is</b> a perfect sphere is wronger than wrong.|$|R

5|$|In the Christian world {{prior to}} Galileo's {{conflict}} with the Church, the majority of educated people subscribed either to the Aristotelian geocentric view that <b>the</b> <b>earth</b> <b>was</b> {{the center of the}} universe and that all heavenly bodies revolved around the Earth, or the Tychonic system that blended geocentrism with heliocentrism. Nevertheless, following the death of Copernicus and before Galileo, heliocentrism was relatively uncontroversial; Copernicus's work was used by Pope Gregory XIII to reform the calendar in 1582.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{earthworks}} {{were built}} up from local chalk; the ditches dug around the fortification {{would not have}} provided enough for the mound itself, and local tradition suggests that much of <b>the</b> <b>earth</b> <b>was</b> quarried instead from the nearby Gallows Pits in the town. The castle was constructed by hand, using workers digging with wooden shovels, and probably without pickaxes. It is estimated that the motte would have taken around 24,000 man days of effort to build.|$|E
5|$|The first {{quantitative}} {{estimate of}} the speed of light was made in 1676 by Rømer (see Rømer's determination {{of the speed of}} light). From the observation that the periods of Jupiter's innermost moon Io appeared to be shorter when <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>was</b> approaching Jupiter than when receding from it, he concluded that light travels at a finite speed, and estimated that it takes light 22 minutes to cross the diameter of Earth's orbit. Christiaan Huygens combined this estimate with an estimate for the diameter of the Earth's orbit to obtain an estimate of speed of light of , 26% lower than the actual value.|$|E

5|$|To the Edge of <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>was</b> {{printed on}} {{post-consumer}} waste paper using minimal {{volatile organic compound}} inks and included a package made of ecological friendly materials. The photography for the extended play was handled by Jacques Descloitres, a photographer working within the NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, with additional works produced by the band's previous collaborator Sean Mosher-Smith of the Echo Designlab. Descloitres provided satellite images of {{different areas of the}} Arctic Circle based largely on observations from the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer.|$|E
5|$|Wallace's 1904 book Man's Place in the Universe was {{the first}} serious attempt by a {{biologist}} to evaluate the likelihood of life on other planets. He concluded that <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>was</b> the only planet {{in the solar system}} that could possibly support life, mainly {{because it was the only}} one in which water could exist in the liquid phase. More controversially he maintained that it was unlikely that other stars in the galaxy could have planets with the necessary properties (the existence of other galaxies not having been proved at the time).|$|E
5|$|Before {{tools such}} as the {{telescope}} were invented, early study of the stars was conducted using the naked eye. As civilizations developed, most notably in Mesopotamia, Greece, Persia, India, China, Egypt, and Central America, astronomical observatories were assembled, and ideas {{on the nature of}} the Universe began to be explored. Most of early astronomy actually consisted of mapping the positions of the stars and planets, a science now referred to as astrometry. From these observations, early ideas about the motions of the planets were formed, and the nature of the Sun, Moon and the Earth in the Universe were explored philosophically. <b>The</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>was</b> believed to be the center of the Universe with the Sun, the Moon and the stars rotating around it. This is known as the geocentric model of the Universe, or the Ptolemaic system, named after Ptolemy.|$|E

50|$|If <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>were</b> a sphere, <b>the</b> {{limit for}} a central eclipse would be 1.0, {{but because of}} the {{oblateness}} of <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> (which causes <b>the</b> distance between <b>the</b> <b>Earth's</b> north and south poles to be slightly shorter than if <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>were</b> perfectly spherical), it is 0.9972.|$|R
5|$|Born {{near the}} eastern edge of the Cape Colony, Kruger took part in the Great Trek as a child during the late 1830s. He had almost no {{education}} apart from the Bible and, through his interpretations of scripture, believed <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>was</b> flat. A protégé of the Voortrekker leader Andries Pretorius, he witnessed the signing of the Sand River Convention with Britain in 1852 and over the next decade played a prominent role in the forging of the South African Republic, leading its commandos and resolving disputes between the rival Boer leaders and factions. In 1863 he was elected Commandant-General, a post he held for a decade before he resigned soon after the election of President Thomas François Burgers.|$|E
5|$|From 1830 to 1833, {{geologist}} Charles Lyell {{published his}} multi-volume work Principles of Geology, which, building on Hutton's ideas, advocated a uniformitarian {{alternative to the}} catastrophic theory of geology. Lyell claimed that, rather than being the products of cataclysmic (and possibly supernatural) events, the geologic features of the Earth are better explained {{as the result of}} the same gradual geologic forces observable in the present day—but acting over immensely long periods of time. Although Lyell opposed evolutionary ideas (even questioning the consensus that the fossil record demonstrates a true progression), his concept that <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>was</b> shaped by forces working gradually over an extended period, and the immense age of the Earth assumed by his theories, would strongly influence future evolutionary thinkers such as Charles Darwin.|$|E
5|$|In France, Champollion's success also {{produced}} enemies. Edmé-Francois Jomard was chief among them, and he spared no occasion to belittle Champollion's achievements behind his back, {{pointing out that}} Champollion {{had never been to}} Egypt and suggesting that really his lettre represented no major progress from Young's work. Jomard had been insulted by Champollion's demonstration of the young age of the Dendera zodiac, which he had himself proposed was as old as 15,000 years. This exact finding had also brought Champollion in the good graces of the Catholic Church which had been antagonized by the claims that Egyptian civilization might be older than the church-sanctioned chronology according to which <b>the</b> <b>earth</b> <b>was</b> only 6,000 years old.|$|E

5|$|South Slavic legends about Kraljević Marko or Krali Marko are {{primarily}} based on myths {{much older than}} the historical Marko Mrnjavčević. He differs in legend from the folk poems; in some areas he was imagined as a giant who walked stepping on hilltops, his head touching the clouds. He {{was said to have}} helped God shape the earth, and created the river gorge in Demir Kapija ("Iron Gate") with a stroke of his sabre. This drained the sea covering the regions of Bitola, Mariovo and Tikveš in Macedonia, making them habitable. After <b>the</b> <b>earth</b> <b>was</b> shaped, Marko arrogantly showed off his strength. God took it away by leaving a bag as heavy as the earth on a road; when Marko tried to lift it, he lost his strength and became an ordinary man.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>was</b> formed {{approximately}} 4.5billion years ago. As it cooled and a {{crust and}} oceans formed, its atmosphere transformed from being dominated by hydrogen to one composed mostly of methane and ammonia. Over the next billion years, the metabolic activity of life transformed the atmosphere into {{a mixture of}} carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and water vapor. These gases changed the way that light from the sun hit the Earth's surface and greenhouse effects trapped heat. There were untapped sources of free energy within the mixture of reducing and oxidizing gasses that {{set the stage for}} primitive ecosystems to evolve and, in turn, the atmosphere also evolved.|$|E
5|$|The Greeks {{used the}} word planēton {{to refer to the}} seven {{celestial}} bodies that moved with respect to the background stars and they held a geocentric view that these bodies moved about the Earth. In his work, The Republic (X.616E–617B), the Greek philosopher Plato provided the oldest known statement defining the order of the planets in Greek astronomical tradition. His list, in order of the nearest to the most distant from <b>the</b> <b>Earth,</b> <b>was</b> as follows: the Moon, Sun, Venus, Mercury, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and the fixed stars. In his dialogue Timaeus, Plato proposed that the progression of these objects across the skies depended on their distance, so that the most distant object moved the slowest.|$|E
