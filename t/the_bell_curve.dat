25|$|Smoothing, or spatial filtering, is {{the idea}} of {{averaging}} the intensities of nearby voxels to produce a smooth spatial map of intensity change across the brain or region of interest. The averaging is often done by convolution with a Gaussian filter, which, at every spatial point, weights neighboring voxels by their distance, with the weights falling exponentially following <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> <b>curve.</b> If the true spatial extent of activation, that is the spread of the cluster of voxels simultaneously active, matches the width of the filter used, this process improves the signal-to-noise ratio. It also makes the total noise for each voxel follow a bell-curve distribution, since adding together a large number of independent, identical distributions of any kind produces <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> <b>curve</b> as the limit case. But if the presumed spatial extent of activation does not match the filter, signal is reduced.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the early}} 20th century, raw scores on IQ tests have {{increased}} {{in most parts of}} the world. When a new version of an IQ test is normed, the standard scoring is set so performance at the population median results in a score of IQ 100.

40|$|Abstract — A new theorem {{shows that}} a {{bootstrap}} algorithm can estimate the impulsivity or tail thickness of symmetric a-stable (SαS) signals. SαS <b>bell</b> <b>curves</b> include <b>the</b> Gaussian <b>bell</b> <b>curve</b> as a special but non-impulsive case. Signals grow more impulsive as <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> <b>curve’s</b> tail thickness increases or as the tail-thickness parameterαfalls from 2 toward 0. <b>The</b> thin-tailed Gaussian <b>bell</b> <b>curve</b> hasα= 2. <b>The</b> algorithm computes a statistic from SαS samples and then matches the test statistic against a continuum of precomputed values to the find the estimated tail thicknesŝα. The theorem and a corollary show that the statistic is invertible {{because it is a}} continuous bijection. So the boostrapped̂α is a consistent estimator ofαin general. Simulations show that̂α is robust for signals withα∈[0. 2, 2] and that the estimator error decreases as the number of samples increases...|$|R

5000|$|What of {{the latest}} {{currents}} of thought? Are they likely to lead to, or at least encourage, further distortions of social policy? The indications are not all encouraging.

2500|$|The normal {{distribution}} is sometimes informally called <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> <b>curve.</b> However, many other distributions are bell-shaped (such as the Cauchy, Student's t, and logistic distributions).

40|$|Additive fuzzy {{systems can}} filter {{impulsive}} noise from signals. Alpha-stable statistics model the impulsiveness as a parametrized family of probability density functions or unit-area <b>bell</b> <b>curves.</b> <b>The</b> bell-curve parameter ct ranges through the interval (0, 2] and gives <b>the</b> Gaussian <b>bell</b> <b>curve</b> when 0 t = 2 and gives <b>the</b> Cauchy <b>bell</b> <b>curve</b> when ~t = 1. The impulsiveness grows as ~ falls and <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> <b>curves</b> have thicker tails. Only the Gaussian statistics have finite variances or finite higher moments. An additive fuzzy system can learn ellipsoidal fuzzy rule patches {{from a new}} pseudo-covariation matrix or measure of alpha-stable covariation. Mahalanobis distance gives a joint set function for the learned if-part fuzzy sets of the if-then rules. The joint set function preserves input correlations that factored set functions ignore. Competitive learning tunes the local means and pseudo-covariations of the alpha-stable statistics and thus tunes the fuzzy rules. Then the covariation rules can both predict nonlinear signals in impulsive noise and filter the impulsive noise in time-series data. The fuzzy system filtered such noise better than did a benchmark radial basis neural network. 1. Filtering impulsive noise Impulsive noise is not Gaussian. The bell-curve density of impulsive noise has thicker tails than a Gaussian <b>bell</b> <b>curve</b> has. <b>The</b> thicker tails give rise to more frequent bursts of noise. The Cauchy density f(x) = 1 /n(l+x 2) has this property and so do all alpha-stable probability densities [17] for index parameter ~ in 0 < ~t < 2. The Cauchy density is the special case when ct = 1. The thicker polynomial tails give an infinite variance and give infinite higher-order moments. The lower-order fractional moments are still finite. The Gaussian density is the special case of an alpha-stable density when ct = 2. It is unique in this family because it has exponential tails and has finite variance and higher-order moments. Fig. 1 shows how alpha-stable noise grows more impulsive as the index ~t falls from 2 to 1...|$|R
