At this point a dispute broke out over who would be responsible for the maintenance of the park. The £5,000 offer from the Treasury was conditional upon the CPF reassigning to <b>the</b> <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> the £200 annual maintenance grant that it currently gave to St Botolph's Aldersgate; the CPF maintained that it was happy to do so on condition that <b>the</b> <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> maintain the park in place of St Botolph's Aldersgate, but that <b>the</b> <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> was unwilling to do so. With all parties unable to agree on responsibility for maintenance, on 19 February 1898 the Treasury withdrew its offer altogether, leaving the appeal £5,000 short.|$|E
