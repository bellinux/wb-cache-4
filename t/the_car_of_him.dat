5000|$|In an {{interview}} in last nights Telegraph, G. W.

Instead of plowing through and running down the passengers, the Elwood stopped before reaching the draw tying up at the pivot pier, and rendered every possible assistance to the unfortunates. We threw overboard life preservers, planks and staging and succeeded in rescuing the only man who fell in the water and escaped with his life. While we were tied up at the pier we sent out a small boat and took aboard the man who was floating on the Elwood foot plank.Jas. Lee, captainAlex. Gordon, mateFrank J. Smith, fireman. Passenger G.

50|$|<b>Of</b> <b>the</b> 20 <b>cars</b> {{which started}} <b>the</b> race, Sutil had gained the most places by <b>the</b> second safety <b>car</b> period. <b>The</b> Force India started from 18th, rose one place after Kovalainen was pushed {{back to the}} pit lane, passed Piquet on the second lap and Bourdais a lap later. Sutil benefited as Button, Rosberg, Glock and Trulli made pit stops for repairs over the {{following}} laps, to sit in 11th by lap 14. Alonso, on extreme wet tyres behind Heidfeld, attempted to pass the BMW at the hairpin, but succeeded only in damaging his front wing and forming a stationary queue behind him. He also benefitted by overtaking three cars under yellow flags {{and would have been}} penalised if he had finished the race. Sutil took advantage of the situation and passed four cars to take seventh, behind Heidfeld and Webber. Running a long first stint until lap 53, he moved to fourth as <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> ahead <b>of</b> <b>him</b> made pit stops. Vettel gained 12 places from the start, battling with Barrichello and Nakajima early on before jumping several places on his first stint as his rivals made pit stops, eventually switching to dry tyres when he stopped on lap 52. Webber improved three places from the start to sit in sixth, ahead of Vettel, Barrichello and Nakajima.|$|R

50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Group 6 race in the 2005 Brian Redman International Challenge, there was a large incident consisting of most of the field: The driver starting fifth (Ray Mulacek, 1969 Chevrolet Camaro) accelerated well before the green flag and tried to force his way between the wall and <b>the</b> <b>car</b> in front <b>of</b> <b>him,</b> resulting in contact with the wall. A following car checked up and was rear-ended, causing a spin that led to further contact as following cars were unable to avoid the growing incident. After just a few seconds of green flag racing, the red flag was waved. Following the initial incident, the failure of trailing drivers to heed red flags being shown at 14 and 15 (under the bridge at the crest of the hill) may have compounded the issue. Luckily, nobody was seriously injured, with the worst injury being a broken arm.|$|R

40|$|We {{deal with}} the problem of {{deriving}} the microscopic equations governing <b>the</b> individual <b>car</b> motion based on the assumptions about the strategy of driver behavior. We suppose the driver behavior to be a result of a certain compromise between the will to move at a speed that is comfortable for him under the surrounding external conditions, comprising the physical state of the road, the weather conditions, etc., and the necessity to keep a safe headway distance between <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> in front <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> Such a strategy implies that a driver can compare the possible ways of his further motion and so choose the best one. To describe the driver preferences we introduce the priority functional whose extremals specify the driver choice. For simplicity we consider a single-lane road. In this case solving the corresponding equations for the extremals we find the relationship between the current acceleration, velocity and position <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> As a special case we get a certain generalization of the optimal velocity model similar to the "intelligent driver model" proposed by Treiber and Helbing.

50|$|In {{qualifying}} {{for the second}} Montreal race, Rosenqvist took his third pole position with Bird in second. Di Grassi took fifth while an driving error restricted Buemi to 13th. Rosenqvist kept his pole position advantage on the first lap while Sarrazin spun following contact with Piquet and Abt and blocked the track at the first turn. Buemi sustained minor rear-end damage from contact with Félix da Costa which caused his right-rear wheel guard to detach and flail. He was shown a black flag with an orange disc, requiring him to enter the pit lane for repairs. The loosework bodywork part fell off his car and his pit stop was short lived but he fell down the field. After ten laps of the race had been completed, Vergne mounted an attack on Rosenqvist for the lead as the French driver had more electrical energy to use than <b>the</b> Mahindra <b>car</b> ahead <b>of</b> <b>him</b> but could not find any space to move in front. The mandatory change for drivers to switch into their second cars began on lap 18 when Engel and Piquet became the first two drivers to enter the pit lane. Rosenqvist followed on the next lap with Vergne, López and both ABT Schaeffler Audi Sport <b>cars</b> <b>of</b> di Grassi and Abt opting to remain on track for an additional lap to allow all four drivers to run in clean air.|$|R

D'Ambrosio battled Abt and passed him to move into eighth place but the German driver regained the position after driving through the next few turns on the circuit. Heidfeld overtook Bird to take over third position and Dillmann started to battle the British driver. At the front of the field, Rosenqvist and Vergne pulled clear from Bird and Heidfeld. With both e.Dams drivers running {{at the rear of the}} pack, the team faced a predicament of pushing to secure the Teams' Championship or consolidate Buemi's hold on the driver's title. After ten laps of the race had been completed, Vergne mounted an attack on Rosenqvist for the lead as the French driver having more electrical energy to use than <b>the</b> Mahindra <b>car</b> ahead <b>of</b> <b>him</b> but could not find any space to move in front.

He discloses the method of payment as being through banks. Prasad does so and finds that a cheque from Nandu's bank for 10 lakhs was encashed by Pardhu's grandfather Satya Narayana Murthy (Nassar) for Poori's sister's marriage. He calls the house and tricks Nandu into responding to his real name. Nandu escapes, but Prasad breaks the news of Pardhu's death to the family and Nandu's real identity. Nandu comes back, amidst outrage from the other family members for his betrayal, and reveals the truth behind his masquerade. Murthy then takes Nandu into his study, where he acknowledges Nandu as his grandson Pardhu. He gives him a gun to seek out the actual killer. He is explained earlier that Pardhu's father's death was caused by the gun backfiring on him when he went hunting, due to a rock being lodged inside the barrel. Nandu calls up Baji Reddy, threatening that he had recorded the prior conversation on tape and that he would send it to the CBI if he didn't reveal who the real killer was. Baji Reddy reveals the killer as none other than Malli, who had in fact faked his death by paying off someone to drive <b>the</b> getaway <b>car</b> instead <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> It is also revealed that he shot Shiva Reddy dead on Baji Reddy's orders from the floor below and tipped off the cops. Nandu then reveals that he did not record the earlier conversation, but he has recorded the current one.

However, he was overtaken by Hülkenberg during the first stop, dropping him to eighth, where he remained {{until the end of}} the race. In Russia, he started in 14th position. He had made up six positions during the race to finish in eighth place, which became seventh as Räikkönen was penalised for causing an accident on the last lap. In the US Grand Prix, Maldonado started 13th, but had to take avoiding action in the first corner, which dropped him to 18th. Despite this, he managed to get back in the battle for the points, because of the high attrition in the race and two safety car periods, when he caught up <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> in front <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> In the end, he finished 8th. At the Brazilian Grand Prix, Maldonado ran into the side of Ericsson. Maldonado's Lotus team described the incident as an [...] "oops", but the stewards considered the incident to be serious so imposed a 5-second penalty on Maldonado.
