500|$|According to CART {{physician}} Dr. Steve Olvey, Zanardi's diagnosis when he {{left the}} track was [...] "extremely critical". His life had been endangered by the crash when the collision caused a <b>traumatic</b> <b>amputation</b> of both of his legs, resulting in the loss of 75% of his blood volume; last rites were given to him afterward. Upon arriving at Klinikum Berlin-Marzahn, Zanardi underwent a three-hour operation to clean and close the wounds. He also fractured his pelvis and suffered a concussion. Tagliani had a sore back {{as a result of the}} accident, and was released from the hospital after one day. On September 17, one of Zanardi's doctors said that his life was not in danger, although he had been placed under an induced coma in an attempt to prevent trauma shock. Doctors took Zanardi off the coma three days later, and left Klinikum Berlin-Marzahn on October 30.|$|E
2500|$|Preliminary {{assessment}} of injuries is usually {{done by the}} first ambulance crew on scene, with this role being assumed by the first Notarzt arriving at the scene. [...] As a rule, {{there will be no}} cardiopulmonary resuscitation, so patients who do not breathe on their own or develop circulation after their airways are cleared, will be tagged [...] "deceased". Also, not every major injury automatically qualifies for a red tag. [...] A patient with a <b>traumatic</b> <b>amputation</b> of the forearm might just be tagged yellow, have the bleeding stopped, and then be sent to a hospital when possible. [...] After the preliminary assessment, a more specific and definite triage will follow, as soon as patients are brought to a field treatment facility. There, they will be disrobed and fully examined by an emergency physician. This will take approximately 90 seconds per patient.|$|E
