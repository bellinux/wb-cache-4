500|$|As {{a result}} of {{repeated}} racial bigotry, Russell refused to respond to fan acclaim or friendship from his neighbors, thinking it was insincere and hypocritical. This attitude contributed to his legendarily bad rapport with fans and journalists. He alienated Celtics fans by saying, [...] "You owe the public the same it owes you, nothing! I refuse to smile and be nice to the kiddies." [...] This supported the opinion of many white fans that Russell (who was by then the highest-paid Celtic) was egotistical, paranoid and hypocritical. The already hostile atmosphere between Russell and Boston hit its apex when vandals broke into his house, covered the walls with racist graffiti, damaged his trophies and defecated in the beds. In response, Russell described Boston as a [...] "flea market of racism". In King Of The Court by Aram Goudsouzian, he was quoted saying, [...] "From my very first year I <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> playing for the Celtics, not for Boston. The fans could do or think whatever they wanted." [...] Referring {{to a time when}} the Celtics could not sell out the Boston Garden despite hockey’s popularity in the same stadium, Russell recalled “We [...] did a survey about what we could do to improve attendance. Over 50 percent of responses said 'There’s too many black players.'” In retirement, Russell described the Boston press as corrupt and racist; in response, Boston sports journalist Larry Claflin claimed that Russell himself was the real racist.|$|E

And I've always been a Democrat, really. But I don't like the Democrats a lot, either, because I'm a smoker, and I {{think a lot of the}} Democrats have come up with these rules for non-smoking." ...|$|E
2500|$|Because of {{the public}} controversy, on October 18, 2007, the Board of Trustees at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory {{suspended}} Watson's administrative responsibilities. On October 19, Watson issued an apology; on October 25, he resigned from his position as chancellor. In 2008, Watson was appointed chancellor emeritus of CSHL. As of 2009, he continues to advise and guide project work at the laboratory. In a 2008 BBC documentary, Watson said: [...] "I have never <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> a racist. I don't {{see myself as a}} racist. I am mortified by it. It was the worst thing in my life."

2500|$|Zorn {{was quoted}} in 1998 as saying [...] "Sometimes I {{get the feeling that}} people just don't see me as a {{composer}}, but it's what I've always been since I was eight years old... I've always <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> a composer, but the world has had a hard time looking at me as a composer because a lot of what I compose is controversial." [...] The establishment of Tzadik allowed him to release many compositions which he had been written over the previous two decades for classical ensembles. Zorn's earliest released [...] "classical" [...] composition (for five flutes), [...] "Christabel" [...] (1972) first appeared on Angelus Novus in 1998. Zorn credits the composition of his 1988 piece for string quartet [...] "Cat O' Nine Tails", commissioned and originally released by the Kronos Quartet (Short Stories), to awakening him to the possibilities of writing for classical musicians. This composition was featured on The String Quartets (1999) and Cartoon S/M (2000) along with variations on [...] "Kol Nidre", inspired by the Jewish prayer of atonement which was written {{at the same time as}} (but not part of) the first Masada Book. [...] (1998) was Zorn's first full-scale orchestral release featuring pianist Stephen Drury, the Hungarian Radio Children's Choir and the American Composers Orchestra conducted by Dennis Russell Davies.|$|E
60|$|Thus prepared, I <b>thought</b> <b>as</b> well <b>of</b> <b>myself,</b> <b>as</b> any knight errant {{that ever}} handled a sword and spear. I took my {{perspective}} glass {{and went up}} {{to the side of the}} hill, to see what I could discover; and I perceived very soon, by my glass, that there were one and twenty savages, three prisoners, and three canoes, and that their chief concern seemed to be the triumphant banquet upon the three poor human bodies, a thing which by this time I had observed was very common with them. I also remarked, that they did not land at that place from whence Friday made his escape, but nearer to the creek, where the shore was low, and where a thick wood came very close to the sea. My soul was then filled with indignation and abhorrence at such inhuman wretches, which put a period to all my former thoughts in their vindication, neither would I give myself time to consider their right of conquest, as I had done before: but descending from the mountain, I came down to Friday, and told him, I was resolved to go speedily to them, and kill them all; asking him again in the same breath, if he would stand by me; when by this time being recovered from his fright, and his spirits much cheered with the dram I had given him, he was very pleasant, yet seriously telling me, as he did before, When I bid die, he would die.|$|R

60|$|I was not sniffling, {{though my}} face {{might well have}} been drawn and {{twitching}} from the pain. But I called up all my resolution, set my teeth, and hobbled back and forth from galley to cabin and cabin to galley without further mishap. Two things I had acquired by my accident: an injured knee-cap that went undressed and from which I suffered for weary months, and the name of “Hump,” which Wolf Larsen had called me from the poop. Thereafter, fore and aft, I was known by no other name, until the term became a part of my thought-processes and I identified it with myself, <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> Hump, as though Hump were I and had always been I.|$|E

There was some talk of sending me to a specialist in Paris. In the end, they did not dare risk it. I overheard something that seemed to show that other people--friends--were looking for me. I learnt later that the nurse who had looked after me went to Paris, and consulted a specialist, representing herself to be me. He put her through some searching tests, and exposed her loss of memory to be fraudulent; but she had taken a note of his methods and reproduced them on me. I dare say I couldn't have deceived the specialist for a minute--a man {{who has made a}} lifelong study of a thing is unique--but I managed once again to hold my own with them.

He would be carrying out his dead wife's wishes, and of course in this there should be no delay. Oh, horrible! When I <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> Bernard's dead wife, and that woman living, I actually kicked the stool my feet were resting on. I vowed in my mind the thing should never be.

6000|$|The {{vibration}} of {{the monster}} ship increased to a strong, electric pulsation, the water hummed along her sides, she felt the swell of the open sea. A fine rain began to fall that hid the land--yes, and the life I was leaving. I made my way across the glistening deck to the saloon where, my newspapers and periodicals neglected, I sat all the morning beside a window gazing out at the limited, vignetted zone of waters around the ship. We were headed for the Old World. The wind rose, the rain became pelting, mingling with the spume of the whitecaps racing madly past: within were warmth and luxury, electric lights, open fires, easy chairs, and men and women reading, conversing as unconcernedly as though the perils of the deep had ceased to be. In all this I found an impelling interest; the naive capacity in me for wonder, so long dormant, had been marvellously opened up once more. I no longer <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> the important man of affairs; and when in {{the progress of the}} voyage I was accosted by two or three men I had met and by others who had heard of me it was only to feel amazement at the remoteness I now felt from a world whose realities were stocks and bonds, railroads and corporations and the detested new politics so inimical to the smooth conduct of [...] "business." ...|$|E

6000|$|I may declare {{in regard}} to these allusions that, {{whatever}} I then <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> a holder of the scales I had never scrupled to laugh out at the humour of Mrs. Highmore's pursuit of quality at any price. It had never rescued her even for a day from the hard doom of popularity, and though I never gave her {{my word for it}} there was no reason at all why it should. The public would have her, as her husband used roguishly to remark; not indeed that, making her bargains, standing up to her publishers and even, in his higher flights, to her reviewers, he ever had a glimpse of her attempted conspiracy against her genius, or rather as I may say against mine. It was not that when she tried to be what she called subtle (for wasn't Limbert subtle, and wasn't I?) her fond consumers, bless them, didn't suspect the trick nor show what they thought of it: they straightway rose on the contrary to the morsel she had hoped to hold too high, and, making but a big, cheerful bite of it, wagged their great collective tail artlessly for more. It was not given to her not to please, nor granted even to her best refinements to affright. I have always respected the mystery of those humiliations, but I was fully aware this morning that they were practically the reason why she had come to me. Therefore when she said with the flush of a bold joke in her kind, coarse face [...] "What I feel is, you know, that you could settle me if you only would." [...] I knew quite well what she meant. She meant that of old it had always appeared to be the fine blade, as some one had hyperbolically called it, of my particular opinion that snapped the silken thread by which Limbert's chance in the market was wont to hang. She meant that my favour was compromising, that my praise indeed was fatal. I had made myself a little specialty of seeing nothing in certain celebrities, of seeing overmuch in an occasional nobody, and of judging from a point of view that, say what I would for it (and I had a monstrous deal to say) remained perverse and obscure. Mine was in short the love that killed, for my subtlety, unlike Mrs. Highmore's, produced no tremor of the public tail. She had not forgotten how, toward the end, when his case was worst, Limbert would absolutely come to me with a funny, shy pathos in his eyes and say: [...] "My dear fellow, I think I've done it this time, if you'll only keep quiet." [...] If my keeping quiet in those days was to help him to appear to have hit the usual taste, for the want of which he was starving, so now my breaking out was to help Mrs. Highmore to appear to have hit the unusual.|$|E
60|$|We {{artists have}} taken over-much to heart that old commandment about seeking after the Kingdom of Heaven. Verlaine {{told me that}} he had tried to {{translate}} 'In Memoriam,' but could not because Tennyson was 'too noble, too Anglais, and when he should have been broken-hearted had many reminiscences.' About that time I found in some English review an essay of his on Shakespeare. 'I had once a fine Shakespeare,' he wrote, or some such words, 'but I have it no longer. I write from memory.' One wondered in what vicissitude he had sold it, and for what money; and an image of the man rose in the imagination. To be his ordinary self as much as possible, not a scholar or even a reader, that was certainly his pose; and in the lecture he gave at Oxford he insisted 'that the poet should hide nothing of himself,' though he must speak it all with 'a care of that dignity which should manifest itself, if not in the perfection of form, at all events with an invisible, insensible, but effectual endeavour after this lofty and severe quality, I was about to say this virtue.' It was this feeling for his own personality, his delight in singing his own life, even more than that life itself, which made the generation I belong to compare him to Villon. It was not till after his death that I understood the meaning his words should have had for me, for while he lived I was interested in nothing but states of mind, lyrical moments, intellectual essences. I would not then have been as delighted as I am now by that banjo-player, or as shocked as I am now by that girl whose movements have grown abrupt, and whose voice has grown harsh by the neglect of all but external activities. I had not learned what sweetness, what rhythmic movement, there is in those who have become the joy that is themselves. Without knowing it I had come to care for nothing but impersonal beauty. I had set out on life with the thought of putting my very self into poetry, and had understood this as a representation of my own visions and an attempt to cut away the non-essential, but as I imagined the visions outside myself my imagination became full of decorative landscape and of still life. I <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> something unmoving and silent living in the middle of my own mind and body, a grain of sand in Bloomsbury or in Connacht that Satan's watch fiends cannot find. Then one day I understood quite suddenly, as the way is, that I was seeking something unchanging and unmixed and always outside myself, a Stone or an Elixir that was always out of reach, and that I myself was the fleeting thing that held out its hand. The more I tried to make my art deliberately beautiful, the more did I follow the opposite of myself, for deliberate beauty is like a woman always desiring man's desire. Presently I found that I entered into myself and pictured myself and not some essence when I was not seeking beauty at all, but merely to lighten the mind of some burden of love or bitterness thrown upon it by the events of life. We are only permitted to desire life, and all the rest should be our complaints or our praise of that exacting mistress who can awake our lips into song with her kisses. But we must not give her all, we must deceive her a little at times, for, as Le Sage says in 'The Devil on Two Sticks,' the false lovers who do not become melancholy or jealous with honest passion have the happiest mistress and are rewarded the soonest and by the most beautiful. Our deceit will give us style, mastery, that dignity, that lofty and severe quality Verlaine spoke of. To put it otherwise, we should ascend out of common interests, the thoughts of the newspapers, of the market-place, of men of science, but only so far as we can carry the normal, passionate, reasoning self, the personality as a whole. We must find some place upon the Tree of Life high enough for the forked branches to keep it safe, and low enough to be out of the little wind-tossed boughs and twigs, for the Phoenix nest, for the passion that is exaltation and not negation of the will, for the wings that are always upon fire.|$|E
