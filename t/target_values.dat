5|$|In {{terms of}} iterations, no search {{algorithm}} that works only by comparing elements can exhibit better average and worst case performance than binary search. This {{is because the}} comparison tree representing binary search has the fewest levels possible as each level is filled completely with nodes if there are enough. Otherwise, the search algorithm can eliminate few elements in an iteration, {{increasing the number of}} iterations required in the average and worst case. This is the case for other search algorithms based on comparisons, as while they may work faster on some <b>target</b> <b>values,</b> the average performance over all elements is affected. This problem is solved by binary search, as dividing the array in half ensures that the size of both subarrays are as similar as possible.|$|E
2500|$|The Swiss Agency for Energy Efficiency (SAFE) uses {{a concept}} that {{promises}} to be of great use in the diagnosis and design of road lighting, [...] "consommation électrique spécifique (CES)", which can be translated into English as [...] "specific electric power consumption (SEC)". Thus, based on observed lighting levels {{in a wide range}} of Swiss towns, SAFE has defined <b>target</b> <b>values</b> for electric power consumption per metre for roads of various categories. Thus, SAFE currently recommends an SEC of 2 to 3 watts per meter for roads of less than 10 metre width (4 to 6 watts per metre for wider roads). Such a measure provides an easily applicable environmental protection constraint on conventional [...] "norms", which usually are based on the recommendations of lighting manufacturing interests, who may not take into account environmental criteria. In view of ongoing progress in lighting technology, target SEC values will need to be periodically revised downwards.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Weapon Systems Portfolio Selection (WSPS) can be {{considered}} as a multi-objective decision analysis (MODA) problem. Aiming at its challenging features because of, 1) interactions and independencies among weapon systems, 2) the uncertainty of the sample data set for assessment, and 3) the missing <b>target</b> <b>value</b> of the assessment criteria, the WSPS problem is solved form four perspectives: portfolio without the independencies or <b>target</b> <b>value,</b> portfolio with the independencies but without <b>target</b> <b>value,</b> portfolio with the independencies and <b>target</b> <b>value,</b> portfolio in a incomplete sample data with the independencies and with <b>target</b> <b>value.</b> The synergy concept is introduced to describe the independencies among systems and Grey Target (GT) and principal component analysis (PCA) method are employed in this study to deal with the missing <b>target</b> <b>value</b> and incomplete sample data set. Three hybrid multiobjective programming algorithms are proposed as GT-MOP 1, GT-MOP 2 and PCA-MOP 2 and non-dominated portfolios are generated as by sorting algorithm as a set of Pareto-optimal solutions. Finally, numerical experiments are given under four scenarios to illustrate the feasibilities and advantages of the three hybrid algorithms...|$|R

40|$|Target Costing is an {{effective}} management technique {{that has been used}} in manufacturing for decades to achieve cost predictability during new products development. Adoption of this technique promises benefits for the construction industry as it struggles to raise the number of successful outcomes and certainty of project delivery in terms of cost, quality and time. <b>Target</b> <b>Value</b> Design is a management approach that takes the best features of Target Costing and adapts them to the peculiarities of construction. In this paper the concept of <b>Target</b> <b>Value</b> Design is introduced {{based on the results of}} action research carried out on 12 construction projects in the USA. It has been shown that systemic application of <b>Target</b> <b>Value</b> Design leads to significant improvement of project performance – the final cost of projects was on average 15 % less than market cost. The construction industry already has approaches that have similarities with elements of the <b>Target</b> <b>Value</b> Design process or uses the same terminology, e. g. Partnering and Target Cost Contracts, Cost planning, etc. Following an exploration of the similarities and differences <b>Target</b> <b>Value</b> Design is positioned as a form of Target Costing for construction that offers a more reliable route to successful projects outcomes...|$|R
