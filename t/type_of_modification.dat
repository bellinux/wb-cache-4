5|$|Many {{proteins}} {{undergo a}} range of posttranslational modifications, when additional chemical groups {{are attached to the}} amino acids in proteins. Some modifications can produce hydrophobic lipoproteins, or hydrophilic glycoproteins. These <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>modification</b> allow the reversible targeting of a protein to a membrane. For example, the addition and removal of the fatty acid palmitic acid to cysteine residues in some signaling proteins causes the proteins to attach and then detach from cell membranes.|$|E
25|$|Archaeological {{features}} often leave earthworks - {{signs of}} some <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>modification</b> {{to the natural}} environment that often appear as cropmarks, soil marks, or even as plough marks in fields that, if historical, can indicate cultivation methods of the past, or, particularly if more recent, can lift archaeological material to the surface and, therefore, ruin the stratigraphic layering of materials from youngest to oldest). Features can be discovered by archaeologists both through excavation and through field survey.|$|E
25|$|Another <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>modification</b> {{is found}} in male diving beetles (of the family Dytiscidae), who are {{equipped}} with suction cup structures on their front legs. They use these to grab passing females and attach to their dorsal surfaces. To get the females to submit, males shake the females violently and keep them submerged underwater (diving beetles cannot go long without atmospheric oxygen). Unable to get air, female diving beetles submit to the male’s advances {{in order to avoid}} drowning (and they lose the energy to resist). Once the males attach, copulation can occur.|$|E

40|$|Femtosecond laser-induced {{structural}} changes in LiNbO 3 are studied. Depending on the laser processing parameters two different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>modification</b> are identified and their origin is discussed. Both <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>modification</b> {{can be described}} {{within the framework of}} induced lattice defects. For strong material damage a refractive index increase can be obtained due to the induced stress field. By appropriate tailoring of this stress field thermally stable and highly symmetric waveguides can be obtained well suited for nonlinear integrated-optical applications...|$|R

25|$|Chromatin {{undergoes}} various {{structural changes}} during a cell cycle. Histone proteins {{are the basic}} packer and arranger of chromatin and can be modified by various post-translational modifications to alter chromatin packing (Histone modification). Most of the modifications occur on the histone tail. The consequences in terms of chromatin accessibility and compaction depend both on the amino-acid that is modified and the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>modification.</b> For example, Histone acetylation results in loosening and increased accessibility of chromatin for replication and transcription. Lysine tri-methylation can either be correlated with transcriptional activity (tri-methylation of histone H3 Lysine 4) or transcriptional repression and chromatin compaction (tri-methylation of histone H3 Lysine 9 or 27). Several studies suggested that different modifications could occur simultaneously. For example, it was proposed that a bivalent structure (with tri-methylation of both Lysine 4 and 27 on histone H3) was involved in mammalian early development.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a movement and its modifications in the Czech tactile sign language {{in comparison with}} the Czech sign language. The theoretical part of the thesis summarizes general knowledge about the Czech sign language in its tactile form and presents various <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>modifications</b> <b>of</b> the movement. The practical part of the thesis demonstrates these <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>modifications</b> used by deafblind people who communicate in the Czech tactile sign language. A video of a conversation of deafblind people was made for a research. This video was analyzed in detail and the findings are described and illustrated by pictures and videos. The result of the research demonstrates different forms of the movement and its modifications in the Czech tactile sign language which are very individual and depends completely on specific situation of communication and communication partners...|$|R

40|$|This {{study has}} the aim to {{investigate}} the differences in dental modification {{between males and females}} in the Maya of Mesoamerica. With this study it is shown that gender ideology is expressed within dental <b>modifications.</b> The <b>types</b> <b>of</b> dental <b>modifications</b> are categorised by using the classifications composed by Javier Romero and modified by Vera Tiesler. A database is set up with the osteological information on 143 individuals from 21 random selected archaeological sites in Mesoamerica. In order to get a clear view from the entire Maya population, this study used samples from different contexts and different time periods. After gathering and bundling this data, statistical analysis is used {{to see if there is}} a significant difference in modification types between males and females. Within this analysis, it is shown that from the 76 <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>modifications</b> categorised by Romero and Tiesler, only 32 were represented in the sample. Nine <b>of</b> the 32 <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>modifications</b> consisted <b>of</b> enough teeth to be used within the actual analysis. From the nine analysed modifications, only two types showed a significant difference between males and females. Due to the fact that this is such a small portion of the total amount <b>of</b> <b>modifications,</b> one cannot say that these results are a good representation of the whole Maya population. The amount <b>of</b> teeth with <b>modifications</b> used within this study, is also not large enough to be representative for the entire Maya population. One could say that within the studied individuals, two <b>of</b> these <b>modification</b> occurs more among females, than among males. For the other <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>modification,</b> there is no statistical evidence to say which sex used them more. With this research not being representative enough for the entire Maya population, various proposals for research in the future are done...|$|R
