The multimedia installation, {{which ran}} from November 4, 2009, to March 28, 2010, filled {{a dark and}} empty museum gallery with recorded voices and explosions, along with flashes of light, simulating {{the experience of a}} mortar attack in Iraq. On three walls of the gallery, projectors cast two horizontal rows of windows, creating the illusion that viewers were inside a darkened warehouse. The eight-minute audio track started with <b>the</b> <b>bustle</b> <b>of</b> traffic and citizens in an Iraqi city, brought in children’s laughter, and subtly overlapped an excerpt from an Al Jazeera broadcast of President Obama speaking about the need to endure in Iraq. Listeners also noted an Islamic call to prayer, forebodingly drowned out by the approach of a helicopter. Without much warning, soldiers began yelling and shooting. When the gunfire ceased, a mother was heard wailing, and the episode ended in ominous silence (voices recorded for Out of Here belonged to a mixture of Iraqi-Americans, United States soldiers, and actors).|$|E

Ideally a villa commanded a view or vista, carefully framed by the architectural design. It might be located on a working estate, or in a [...] "resort town" [...] situated on the seacoast, such as Pompeii and Herculaneum.|$|E

Preferring solitude to <b>the</b> <b>bustle</b> <b>of</b> the dormitories, Amir boarded at a privately-owned home of a Surakartan resident. Later he met several future writers, including Armijn Pane and Achdiat Karta Mihardja; they soon {{found him to be}} a friendly and diligent student with complete notes and a spotless bedroom (sheets folded so well, Mihardja later recalled, that a [...] "lost fly could have easily slid over them"), but also a romantic prone to thinking wistfully beneath the lamplight and isolating himself from his classmates.|$|E

In 1886, her first year in charge, she added Tristan und Isolde to the canon. Amid <b>the</b> <b>bustle</b> <b>of</b> the festival Cosima refused to be distracted by the illness of her father, Liszt, who collapsed after attending a performance of Tristan and died several days later. Cosima supervised her father's funeral service and burial arrangements, but refused a memorial concert or any overt display of remembrance. According to Liszt's pupil Felix Weingartner, [...] "Liszt's passing was not of sufficient importance to dim the glory of the Festival, even for a moment".|$|E
500|$|Louise's {{father-in-law}} King Frederick William II {{gave the}} couple Charlottenburg Palace, but {{the crown prince}} and his new wife preferred to live at Paretz Palace, just outside Potsdam, where Louise kept herself busy with household affairs. Paretz was far from <b>the</b> <b>bustle</b> <b>of</b> court, as the couple were most content in the [...] "rural retirement" [...] of a country life. The marriage was happy, and Louise was well-beloved by the king, who called her [...] "the princess of princesses" [...] {{and gave her a}} palace in Oranienburg. The crown princess saw it as her duty to support her husband in all his pursuits, and the couple enjoyed singing together and reading from Shakespeare and Goethe. Louise soon became pregnant, disappointingly giving birth to a stillborn girl on 1 October 1794 at the age of eighteen. Nine healthy children would follow in quick succession, though two died in childhood: Crown Prince Frederick William (1795), Prince William (1797), Princess Charlotte (1798), Princess Frederica (1799), Prince Charles (1801), Princess Alexandrine (1803), Prince Ferdinand (1804), Princess Louise (1808), and Prince Albert (1809). The couple also used the Crown Prince's Palace in the capital.|$|E

In an effort to remove himself from <b>the</b> <b>bustle</b> <b>of</b> the city's center, the prominent New Bedford Quaker, Daniel Ricketson built a country estate {{in what is now}} Brooklawn Park. Literary greats, such as Henry David Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson, often visited Ricketson at his estate.

2500|$|Its tree-lined streets, {{historic}} mansions, and gilded mid-rises {{reflect the}} area's development in <b>the</b> <b>bustle</b> <b>of</b> Uptown's entertainment industry {{from the early}} 1900s, now undergoing a burgeoning revitalization. The diverse housing also includes ornate, imposing terra-cotta clad buildings, immortalized in the movies of early twentieth century Chicago as apartment hotels and boarding houses. Some of these 1920s, Jazz-Age hotels have since been converted to high-end condos and co-ops, adding to the tremendously diverse population of the area. [...] The Margate Park community, as well {{as much of the}} Uptown neighborhood of which it is a part, is a popular and thriving home to many of the city's LGBT residents.

[...] Designed in 1937 by architect Charles Kristen, its asymmetrical facade, clearly influenced by the 1933-34 Century of Progress Exposition in Chicago, features dazzling decoration, with yellow vertical piers on a backdrop of cobalt blue, as well as splashes of aqua. The building itself is architecturally significant for its deco facade.|$|E
2500|$|The Genesis flood {{narrative}} has {{similarities to}} ancient flood stories told worldwide. One {{of the closest}} parallels is the Mesopotamian myth of a world flood, recorded in The Epic of Gilgamesh. In the Hebrew Bible flood story (Genesis 6:5-22), God decides to flood the world and start over, due to mankind's sinfulness. However, God sees that a man named Noah was righteous (because he walked with God) and blameless among the people. God instructs Noah to build an ark, and directs him to bring {{at least two of}} every animal inside the boat, along with his family. The flood comes and covers the world. After 40 days, Noah sends a raven to check whether the waters have subsided, then a dove; after exiting the boat, Noah offers a sacrifice to God, who smells [...] "the sweet savour" [...] and promises never to destroy the earth by water again -and making the rainbow a symbol of this promise. Similarly, in the Mesopotamian Epic of Gilgamesh, <b>the</b> <b>bustle</b> <b>of</b> humanity disturbs the gods, who decide to send a flood. Warned by one of the gods, a man named Utnapishtim builds a boat and takes his family and animals inside. After the flood, Utnapishtim sends a dove, then a swallow, then a raven to check whether the waters have subsided. After exiting the boat, Utnapishtim offers a sacrifice to the gods, who smell [...] "the sweet savour" [...] and repent their choice to send the flood.|$|E
2500|$|The Velveteen Rabbit or How Toys Become Real was Margery Williams Bianco's first American work, and {{it remains}} her most famous. It has {{remained}} a classic piece of literature through numerous adaptations in children's theatre {{as well as on}} radio, television and in the movies. The author's trademark undercurrents of sentimentality and sadness persist in the tale of a small boy who finds a velveteen rabbit in his Christmas stocking. The boy quickly discards the toy after playing with it for a few hours in <b>the</b> <b>bustle</b> <b>of</b> Christmas and relatives. [...] In the nursery the rabbit is looked down on by the fancier wind up toys. He asks the skin horse, [...] "What is Real?" [...] The skin horse tells him, [...] "When a child loves you for a long, long time, not just to play with, but REALLY loves you, then you become Real." [...] The boy comes to adore the rabbit, and they are constant companions. This happy existence continues until the boy contracts scarlet fever. [...] The rabbit stays with him, whispering to him of the games they will play again when he is better. [...] As the boy gets better his family prepares {{to take him to the}} seaside. Although the rabbit looks forward to the seaside very much, the doctor insists he be thrown out and burned along with the other toys that may be infected. While the rabbit is waiting to be burned, he cries a real tear, from which a fairy emerges. The fairy tells the rabbit that he was real to the boy, because the boy loved him, but now she will make him truly real. [...] Later, the boy sees a real rabbit in the garden. [...] He thinks it looks like his old rabbit, but he does not know that it really is the velveteen rabbit he once loved.|$|E
