5|$|It is said <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{place from}} where the Hindu god Rama built a bridge across the sea to Lanka to rescue his wife Sita from her {{abductor}} Ravana. The Ramanathaswamy Temple, dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva, {{is located at the}} centre of the town and is closely associated with Rama. The temple, along with the town, is considered a holy pilgrimage site for both Shaivas and Vaishnavas.|$|E
5|$|New {{building}} techniques introduced {{with this}} set include a systematic way of building numbers. On {{the front of}} the building the year 1932 appears, which is a reference to when LEGO was founded. The number 3 also appears on the pavement of the set representing <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> 3rd set on the series from Lego set designer Jamie Berard (he had previously designed Café Corner and Green Grocer).|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} reasons for showing Oscar's head and {{shoulders}} within the frame during the flashback scenes, rather than letting the camera be the character's eyes. The first was <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> way Noé usually sees himself in dreams and when recalling past events. He also {{thought it would be}} easier for the viewer to care about a character who is visible, as many point-of-view films, in his opinion, look unintentionally funny.|$|E
50|$|Another {{noteworthy}} factor <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> first {{heavy metal}} album released by a Sri Lankan band.|$|R
50|$|Fossils {{have been}} {{discovered}} in strata formed from ancient cypress forests, suggesting <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> animal's preferred habitat.|$|R

5|$|Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) {{has been}} told by his lawyer that he should join a religion. He asks advice of people {{including}} Liz and Jack, going as far as attending church with Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer). When Eddie explains Irish Catholicism to Tracy, he decides <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> religion {{he was looking for}} and joins.|$|E
5|$|Wallace is {{grateful}} for an involuntary stop in Bali, which he finds {{one of the}} most interesting places of his trip, as Hindu customs and religion are still practised, while on Lombok he finds Australian birds such as cockatoos, observing <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> most westerly point of that family's range.|$|E
5|$|A UNPA {{could be}} created through a {{stand-alone}} treaty. This {{would have the}} advantage that as few as 20 or 30 economically and geographically diverse countries could establish a UNPA, and it could expand as more countries ratified the treaty. Strauss notes <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> method by which most international bodies, such the World Health Organization, International Labour Organization, and International Criminal Court, were founded. The way to get started presumably would be to hold a conference of plenipotentiaries to draft the treaty; then the ratification process would begin.|$|E
25|$|It may <b>be</b> that <b>the</b> Royal Wadi's {{resemblance}} to the hieroglyph for horizon showed <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> place to found the city.|$|R

5|$|An emaki of Murasaki Shikibu's diary is {{mentioned}} in the Meigetsuki ("Record of the clean moon"), the diary of the poet and scholar Fujiwara no Teika. According to this document, in 1233 several aristocrats close to cloistered Emperor Go-Horikawa planned {{to create a new}} emaki of The Tale of Genji (after the 12th century Genji Monogatari Emaki, the best known of these works), accompanied by another of Murasaki's diary. However, there is no conclusive evidence that the extant scrolls correspond to those mentioned by Fujiwara no Teika, even though the consistency of manufacturing dates suggests <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> case. The paintings of the emaki have been attributed to the painter Fujiwara Nobuzane and the captions to the excellent calligrapher Gokyōgoku (後京極良経, 1169–1206), despite definitive evidence.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} Devonian, land plants had {{stabilized}} freshwater habitats, allowing the first wetland ecosystems to develop, with increasingly complex food webs that afforded new opportunities. Freshwater habitats {{were not the}} only places to find water filled with organic matter and dense vegetation near the water's edge. Swampy habitats like shallow wetlands, coastal lagoons and large brackish river deltas also existed at this time, and there is much to suggest <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> kind of environment in which the tetrapods evolved. Early fossil tetrapods have been found in marine sediments, and because fossils of primitive tetrapods in general are found scattered all around the world, they must have spread by following the coastal lines — they could not have lived in freshwater only.|$|E
5|$|Compared to {{most other}} {{important}} crops, {{little is known}} about the domestication, dispersal and cultivation history of the cowpea. Although there is no archaeological evidence for early cowpea cultivation the centre of diversity of the cultivated cowpea is West Africa, leading an early consensus <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> likely centre of origin and place of early domestication. New research using molecular markers has suggested that domestication may have instead occurred in East Africa and currently both theories carry equal weight.|$|E
50|$|Adaraneeya Kathawak {{received}} mostly {{positive response}} from the critics. Most reviews praised director Priyantha Colombage and stated <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> best creation among his films.|$|R
2500|$|Huldrych Zwingli {{taught that}} <b>the</b> sacrament <b>is</b> purely {{symbolic}} and memorial in character, arguing <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> meaning of Jesus' instruction: [...] "Do this in remembrance of me".|$|R
50|$|Egg Island {{gained some}} fame in the 1980s when Arne Molander claimed <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> first island where Columbus landed in his 1492 voyage to the New World.|$|R
5|$|Conversely, Anthony Camp {{challenges}} {{the belief that}} Sophia had a child and provides a detailed summary of the available evidence. In his book Royal Babylon: the Alarming History of European Royalty, author Karl Shaw writes {{of the possibility that}} the Duke raped his sister, citing evidence from Charles Greville's diaries, as well as other factors. Historian Gillian Gill believes that Sophia secretly gave birth to the child and <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> reason Sophia never married. Alison Weir and others, however, write of a possible marriage between Sophia and Garth the same year as the child's birth, but {{there is no evidence to}} back this assertion other than the presence of a wedding ring in a portrait of an aged Sophia.|$|E
5|$|In addition, other {{characters}} have supporting roles {{in this game}} as well. Lakitu reprises {{his role as the}} referee, helping racers in various situations such as announcing laps, giving the signal to drive with its traffic lights hanging on a fishing pole, and taking characters back on track in case they fall off course. Other supporting characters appearing in this game include Shy Guys, Goombas, Nokis, Toadsworth, Piantas, Chain Chomps, Piranha Plants and more. It should also be noted <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> very first time that Toadette has appeared in the Mario franchise.|$|E
5|$|Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) convinces {{regional}} manager Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) {{that he needs}} to choose someone to act as an Assistant to the Assistant to the Regional Manager (A.A.R.M.). Jim designs several Dwight-oriented challenges as tryouts for the position, and it is inevitably found that Dwight is the most qualified. Angela Lipton (Angela Kinsey) is forced to bring her child, Phillip, to work, after her daycare turns her child away. Dwight, upon overhearing that Phillip has been eating the type of paper which he himself regards as the most flavorful, begins to think that Angela's son is actually his. To test this theory, Dwight offers the child either a check for one million dollars or a beet; Phillip picks the beet. Dwight tells Angela that he will marry her if the child is his, but she denies <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> case. Dwight then confers with Jim, asking whether he should propose to Angela or his girlfriend Esther, who he thinks is the more logical choice. Jim tells Dwight {{that he needs to}} put aside logic and follow his instincts. Dwight makes up his mind and proposes to Angela, who says yes. Angela finally reveals to Dwight that Phillip is indeed his son, explaining that she lied about his parentage in order to test Dwight's feelings for her.|$|E

50|$|Another aim of <b>the</b> design <b>was</b> to keep <b>the</b> {{complete}} {{purchase cost}} under US$6000 as <b>the</b> designer felt <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> maximum figure <b>that</b> most builders could justify without causing marital discord.|$|R
5|$|Millennium Group member Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) {{travels with}} his wife Catherine (Megan Gallagher) and {{daughter}} Jordan (Brittany Tiplady) to visit Catherine's parents in Arlington County, Virginia. Also present are Catherine's sister Dawn (Barbara Williams and her husband Gil. In Maryland, Henry Dion (Mike Starr) follows a woman home and murders her; he is later visited by a strange man hiding his face behind dark glasses—it becomes apparent <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{man who has been}} sending Black threatening polaroid pictures. Dion thanks the man (Paul Raskin) for finding the victim for him, but is chided for not committing the murder while Black was in the area. Dion takes the corpse into the woods to bury it, all the while speaking to it as though in conversation.|$|E
5|$|On 21 June 2009, Schumacher {{appeared}} on the BBC's motoring programme Top Gear as the Stig. Presenter Jeremy Clarkson hinted later in the programme that Schumacher was not the regular Stig, and the BBC has since confirmed <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> case. Schumacher was there on that occasion because Ferrari would not allow anyone else to drive the one-of-a-kind black Ferrari FXX that was featured in the show. The FXX was presented to Schumacher upon his retirement at Monza in 2006.|$|E

Mulder slips into the Center with the help of The Lone Gunmen and begins searching the data on the computers. Doggett soon arrives, realizing that the password leak was a trap. After a bitter argument (and upon both Scully and the Gunmen revealing to Mulder the arrival of black ops mercenaries on the scene), they leave before security arrives.|$|E
