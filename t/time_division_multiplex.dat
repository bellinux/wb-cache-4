The power cars were fitted with buffers and <b>Time</b> <b>Division</b> <b>Multiplex</b> equipment {{that allowed them to}} directly control a Class 91, and were moved over to the ECML where they were used on workings with Class 89 and then Class 91 locomotives from London to Leeds. After the Mk 4 stock had been delivered, the HST power cars had the TDM equipment removed, and then reverted to their normal duties. The power cars used for this project can be easily identified as they are still fitted with buffers. They were then transferred to Virgin Cross Country, and put in storage when Virgin replaced its HST fleet with Bombardier's Voyager (though Arriva, upon later taking over the franchise, acquired 10 power cars, 4 of which were buffered). Grand Central bought six of these for services from Sunderland to London, the remaining two having been integrated into Network Rail's New Measurement Train.|$|E

50|$|It was {{indicated}} in section 2.2 Analysis {{that the effect}} of constraining a pulse to only occur on clock boundaries is to introduce noise, that generated by waiting for the next clock boundary. This will have its most deleterious effect on the high frequency components of a complex signal. Whilst the case has been made for clocking in the ADC environment, where it removes one source of error, namely the ratio between the impulse duration and the summing interval, it is deeply unclear what useful purpose clocking serves in a single channel transmission environment since it is a source of both noise and complexity but it is conceivable that it would be useful in a TDM (<b>time</b> <b>division</b> <b>multiplex)</b> environment.|$|E

50|$|Sinn formed Ultronic Systems Corp. in December 1960, and was {{president}} and CEO from then until {{he left the}} company in 1970. By the fall of 1961 Ultronics had installed its first desk units (Stockmaster) in New York and Philadelphia, followed by San Francisco and Los Angeles. The Stockmaster desk units offered the user quick access and continuous monitoring of last sale, bid, ask, high, low, total volume, open, close, earnings, and dividends for each stock on the NYSE and the AMEX plus commodities from the various U.S. commodity exchanges. Ultimately Ultronics and General Telephone (which bought Ultronics in 1967) installed some 10,000 units world-wide. In June 1964 Ultronics and the British news company Reuters signed a joint venture agreement to market Stockmaster worldwide outside of North America. This venture lasted for 10 years and was very successful, capturing the worldwide market for U.S. stock and commodity price information.

50|$|Seven bit {{characters}} have {{the alternative to}} be sent erect, meaning that 0 stays as 0 and 1 stays as 1, or inverted where each 0 changes to 1 and 1 changes to 0. The standard specifies a marking pattern which says which characters are erect and which are inverted in a particular pattern, that enables the system phase, channel and subchannel to be determined. Since the system is synchronous there is no start bit, and a receiver has to examine the bit stream to tell where {{the start of a}} marked cycle is. When system phase is established the correct received bit can be assigned to the correct place in each character in each channel. The receiver can determine that system phase is established as each character will contain three one bits and four zero bits. In recommendation 342-2 here are two different marking lengths schemes. For the four character repetition cycle, Channel A is encoded ↓↑↑↑ (4333) and channel B is marked ↑↓↓↓ (3444). These are combined in a <b>time</b> <b>division</b> <b>multiplex</b> method with characters in the order A1 B4 A2 B1 A3 B2 A4 B3 resulting in a marking pattern ↓↓↑↑↑↓↑↓ (44333434 one bits) to match the first character from channel A at the start.|$|E
5000|$|One of the JERC's first {{decisions}} was {{to build}} an electronic exchange using the [...] "Switched Highways" [...] system, which employed <b>time</b> <b>division</b> <b>multiplex</b> techniques (TDM), {{while at the same}} time continuing research on alternative solutions to the problem of electronic switching. The [...] "Switched Highways" [...] system was invented by L.R.F Harris at Dollis Hill in 1952. It was also decided that the experimental equipment should provide the full service and maintenance facilities of a comparable electro-mechanical exchange. At the same time the techniques used had to be demonstrably capable of serving the largest existing exchanges. Moreover, the experiment was to be conducted in an exchange giving public service and therefore fully interconnected with the public network. This meant that it would need conversion equipment to enable it to inter-work with the existing system and to use the existing subscribers' apparatus and line plant. For these reasons the Highgate Wood installation was bigger than the small number of lines would have seemed to warrant and about 400,000 electronic components were fitted. Much of the control equipment could have served an exchange of about 7,000 lines. The exchange used both valves and transistors. There were approximately 5000 transistors and 500 valves. The valves were used in the more crucial areas, as the transistors of the day were not up to the required performance.|$|E
50|$|Just before World War II, Tommy Flowers MBE, {{employed}} at the GPO, {{had been working}} on VF (voice frequency) signalling, using valves (vacuum tubes), and this had led him to realise that valves could be very reliable if not switched on and off. This gave him the confidence during the war to build the world's first digital computer, called Colossus, at Bletchley Park. This computer used about a thousand valves and was a major factor in helping British Intelligence to break the German codes, though details of this were only released in 2000. After the war, the success of Colossus encouraged him to contemplate the possibility of telephone exchanges each using tens of thousands of valves. He was told that this was impossible and he could not say he had already done it with Colossus because he was bound by the Official Secrets Act. However, a fully electronic prototype <b>Time</b> <b>Division</b> <b>Multiplex</b> Model Exchange was constructed at the Post Office Research Station at Dollis Hill and then an experimental TDM exchange system was built and tested at Highgate Wood, North London, in 1962, but it was found to be beyond the technology of the time: the solid-state switching worked well, but the analogue transmission (which had worked on the short cable runs of a laboratory model at Dollis Hill) was too noisy for public service on the long cable runs of a large exchange. However, the principles would be used later, as transmission became digital, in the development of digital exchanges the world over, including System X.|$|E
