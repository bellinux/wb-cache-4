5|$|Many ligand {{transport}} proteins bind particular small biomolecules {{and transport}} {{them to other}} locations {{in the body of}} a multicellular organism. These proteins must have a high binding affinity when their ligand is present in high concentrations, but must also release the ligand when it is present at low concentrations in the <b>target</b> <b>tissues.</b> The canonical example of a ligand-binding protein is haemoglobin, which transports oxygen from the lungs to other organs and tissues in all vertebrates and has close homologs in every biological kingdom. Lectins are sugar-binding proteins which are highly specific for their sugar moieties. Lectins typically play a role in biological recognition phenomena involving cells and proteins. Receptors and hormones are highly specific binding proteins.|$|E

These ligands should behave as antagonists in the prostate with either no activity or agonist activity in other <b>target</b> <b>tissues,</b> so as to have little or no effects in the anabolic tissues or central nervous system (CNS). However discovering this new class of ligands might be challenging because the molecular mechanism of AR action is not well understood.|$|E

25|$|Estradiol {{has been}} {{tied to the}} {{development}} and progression of cancers such as breast cancer, ovarian cancer and endometrial cancer. Estradiol affects <b>target</b> <b>tissues</b> mainly by interacting with two nuclear receptors called estrogen receptor α (ERα) and estrogen receptor β (ERβ). One of the functions of these estrogen receptors is the modulation of gene expression. Once estradiol binds to the ERs, the receptor complexes then bind to specific DNA sequences, possibly causing damage to the DNA {{and an increase in}} cell division and DNA replication. Eukaryotic cells respond to damaged DNA by stimulating or impairing G1, S, or G2 phases of the cell cycle to initiate DNA repair. As a result, cellular transformation and cancer cell proliferation occurs.|$|E
25|$|Dydrogesterone is {{a highly}} {{selective}} progestogen, and due to its unique structure, unlike progesterone and many other progestins, binds almost exclusively to the progesterone receptor (PR). The affinity of dydrogesterone for the PR is relatively low at about 16% of that of progesterone. However, in vivo, dydrogesterone is much more potent in comparison, with an equivalent dose, in terms of endometrial proliferation, that is 10 to 20 times {{lower than that of}} progesterone. This is due to pharmacokinetic differences between the two drugs, namely improved bioavailability and metabolic stability with dydrogesterone as well as additional progestogenic activity of its metabolites. Although dydrogesterone binds to both isoforms of the PR and has similar activity as an agonist of the PRB as progesterone, its agonistic activity is weak {{in the case of the}} PRA. Hence, dydrogesterone shows selectivity for activation of the PRB. This could potentially confer a therapeutic advantage, as the two receptor isoforms induce different physiological responses in <b>target</b> <b>tissues.</b>|$|E
25|$|Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is {{the most}} {{abundant}} circulating androgen hormone and can be rapidly metabolized within <b>target</b> <b>tissues</b> into potent androgens and estrogens. Gonadal steroids generally regulate aggression during the breeding season, but non-gonadal steroids may regulate aggression during the non-breeding season. Castration of various species in the non-breeding season {{has no effect on}} territorial aggression. In several avian studies, circulating DHEA {{has been found to be}} elevated in birds during the non-breeding season. These data support the idea that non-breeding birds combine adrenal and/or gonadal DHEA synthesis with neural DHEA metabolism to maintain territorial behavior when gonadal testosterone secretion is low. Similar results have been found in studies involving different strains of rats, mice, and hamsters. DHEA levels also have been studied in humans and may play a role in human aggression. Circulating DHEAS (its sulfated ester) levels rise during adrenarche (~7 years of age) while plasma testosterone levels are relatively low. This implies that aggression in pre-pubertal children with aggressive conduct disorder might be correlated with plasma DHEAS rather than plasma testosterone, suggesting an important link between DHEAS and human aggressive behavior.|$|E

Such information allows the selection of proper operating parameters such as dye concentrations, laser power, and exposure time for optimal therapeutic effect. Combining the Monte Carlo method for energy absorption and the finite difference method for heat diffusion, the temperature distributions in <b>target</b> <b>tissue</b> and surrounding tissue in dye enhanced laser photothermal interaction are obtained. Different tissue configurations and dye enhancement are used in the simulation, and different incident beam sizes are also used to determine optimum beam sizes for various tissue configurations.

Our simulation indicates that with appropriate absorption enhancement of the <b>target</b> <b>tissue,</b> the temperature in the <b>target</b> <b>tissue</b> and in the surrounding tissue can be effectively controlled.

25|$|DHT {{was first}} {{synthesized}} by Adolf Butenandt {{and his colleagues}} in 1935. It was prepared via hydrogenation of testosterone, which had been discovered earlier that year. DHT was introduced for medical use as an AAS in 1953, and was noted to be more potent than testosterone but with reduced androgenicity. It was not elucidated to be an endogenous substance until 1956, when it was shown to be formed from testosterone in rat liver homogenates. The biological importance of DHT was not realized until the early 1960s, when it {{was found to be}} produced by 5α-reductase from circulating testosterone in <b>target</b> <b>tissues</b> like the prostate gland and seminal vesicles and was found to be more potent than testosterone in bioassays. The biological functions of DHT in humans became much more clearly defined upon the discovery and characterization of 5α-reductase type II deficiency in 1974.

2500|$|During the {{absorption}} {{process in the}} intestines, retinol is incorporated into chylomicrons as the ester form, and it is these particles that mediate transport to the liver.

2500|$|Epithelial {{cells in}} SS lesions are active {{participants}} in the induction and perpetuation of the inflammatory process. Environmental and hormonal factors, in concert with an appropriate genetic background, are believed to trigger SS, which dysregulates epithelial cells and allows aberrant homing and activation of dendritic cells (DCs), T cells, and B cells. Dendritic cells are antigen-presenting cells [...] which process antigen material and present it to other T cells. Following the migration of lymphocytes into the glands in response to chemokines and specific adhesion molecules, T cells interact with epithelial cells. Epithelial cells are further activated by proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IFN-γ, and TNF), which are produced by adjacent T cells. The early accumulation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells in the <b>target</b> <b>tissues,</b> which produce high levels of type 1 IFNs, seems to be important, as these cells can further dysregulate the immune response through abnormal retention of lymphocytes in the tissues and their subsequent activation.
