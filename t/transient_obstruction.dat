40|$|A 68 -year-old woman {{presented}} with a 4 -year unexplained intermittent abdominal pain recently complicated with rapidly <b>transient</b> <b>obstruction</b> episodes. Physical examination, plain radiograph and ultrasound of the abdomen were normal. At colonoscopy, a submucosal tumor (Fig. 1 A) 0. 5   cm in diameter prolapsing through the ileocecal valve was found. On removal of the tumor, after endoloop placement, a second tumor with the same endoscopic features but of 1. 5  cm length was discovered, overlying mucosa looking normal. The two tumors were removed by electrosurgical snare polypectomy, a yellowish color {{at the base of}} both tumors was noted (Fig. 1 B). Regarding the valvular location of the double resection a preventive Endoclip was placed (Fig. 1 C). At histology the two tumors were covered by normal mucosa and consisted of adipose tissue. The lipomas presumably had been prolapsing intermittently through the ileocecal valve causing <b>transient</b> <b>obstruction</b> [1]. In our case, as in a previously reported prolapsing terminal ileal lipoma [2], no further obstruction symptoms had been noted after endoscopic resection. Lipoma is a benign tumor, more frequent after the age of 50 years with a female predominance. Ileal location is about 60 % in all small intestine lipomas. Intestinal lipomas are asymptomatic in most cases; they may be responsible for abdominal pain, transit disorders or a König’s syndrome. The diagnosis of ileal lipoma is often carried out by radiological or endoscopic exploration. Their most frequent complication is represented by ileo-ileal or ileocecal invaginations and degeneration is quite exceptional [3]. For symptomatic lipomas, surgery is the treatment of reference...|$|E
40|$|We {{present an}} unusual case of {{recurrent}} cough syncope in a 43 -year-old woman, which was initially {{thought to be}} seizures. Syncopal episodes were triggered by paroxysms of cough and were characterized by unresponsiveness and myoclonic jerks in her extremities. She had a left-sided glomus jugulare tumor that extended into the posterior cranial fossa with evidence of worsening communicating hydrocephalus on brain imaging. We postulate that bouts of cough produced increased intracranial pressure both by raising intrathoracic and intraabdominal pressures {{as well as by}} <b>transient</b> <b>obstruction</b> to cerebrospinal fluid flow secondary to intermittent tonsillar herniation during cough. This resulted in diffuse decrease in cerebral blood flow causing syncope. The patient's syncopal episodes decreased in frequency once an external ventricular drain was placed followed by a ventriculoperitoneal shunt.

40|$|Acute 'pontine' cats were {{submitted}} to abrupt increases {{in blood pressure}} induced by a <b>transient</b> <b>obstruction</b> of the lower thoracic aorta. This stimulation regularly provoked a complex electrocortical response. The first part of it, which occurred 12 sec after {{the beginning of the}} pressure rise, consisted of an activation reaction accompanied by dilatation of the pupils and tonic contraction of the lower back muscle, preceded by arrest of respiration. The activation reaction and pupillary dilatation were absent in the cats with a brain stem section at the junction between the pons and the mesencephalon. The effects on the cerebrum are attributed to a passive increase in blood flow which is effective on ECoG and pupils only when the midbrain is connected to the brain. The second and third parts of the response, a burst of slow waves followed by a flattening of the record, were dependent of the hypotension which followed the end of the blood pressure rise. They were preserved in the cats with a lesion of the junction between the pons and the mesencephalon. They are attributed to a relative ischemia of the brain.

40|$|Biliary is {{the most}} common form of acute {{pancreatitis}} and is believed to result from <b>transient</b> <b>obstruction</b> of the bile and pancreatic ducts. The severity of the disease is determined by the extent and the intensity of the ensuing local and systemic inflammatory reaction, which depends on multiple factors possibly including the persistence of obstruction. Early ERCP with endoscopic sphincterotomy and disobstruction of the common bile duct has been proposed as a procedure to improve the outcome of acute pancreatitis. Over the last 20 years a number of clinical trials and meta-analyses have addressed the issue of early ERCP in acute pancreatitis producing conflicting results. Inconsistencies in the various clinical trials and meta-analyses should be interpreted within the context of several limitations, namely the difficulties in excluding patients with concurrent cholangitis and the unavailability of a reliable and accurate scoring system to predict the severity of acute pancreatitis early in the course of the disease. Reviewing the clinical trials and meta-analyses we conclude that, at present, strong evidence supports early ERCP in acute biliary pancreatitis only in the presence of cholangitis or persistent obstruction of the common bile duct when the predicted outcome of the disease is severe...|$|E
40|$|Spontaneous {{perforation}} of the {{collecting system}} constitutes a rare entity masked by {{the presentation of}} a typical renal colic. However, {{it should not be}} forgotten when managing patients with colic, since missed diagnoses may carry significant morbidity. We herein present a series of spontaneous perforation of the collecting system without an apparent obstruction site evident in helical CT urography. Four consecutive patients who presented with typical renal colic were initially subjected to KUB and renal ultrasound imaging and were ultimately diagnosed with perforation of the collecting system via contrast enhanced- helical CT urography. Despite thorough evaluation, the cause responsible obstructive was not discovered and an exclusion diagnosis of idiopathic collecting system perforation was assigned to all patients. Due to the rarity of a spontaneous perforation traditional retrograde urography was performed in an effort to identify the possible cause but was also unrevealing. All patients were successfully treated with endourological means. Perforation of the collecting system without an evident obstructive cause is a rare entity with obscure etiology. A reasonable but yet unconfirmed speculation is that of a <b>transient</b> <b>obstruction</b> capable of a significant increase of intraluminal pressures...|$|E
40|$|An unintentional {{embolization}} of retinal arteries is {{rare and}} has been documented as a complication after embolization of arteries supplying head and neck tumors. However, occlusion of the central retinal artery with severe loss of vision has never {{been reported to be}} a complication from embolization of tumor-supplying ethmoidal branches of the ophthalmic artery. A 40 year-old male patient with a history of right nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma underwent preoperative radiological embolization of an ethmoidal metastasis after having experienced a life-threatening sinus bleeding. Repeated probing of the ophthalmic artery with an endovascular microcatheter for particle embolization of the tumor-supplying arteries was performed under anticoagulation with heparin. Postoperatively, a standard ophthalmological examination including extended vascular evaluation by angiography was performed. After extended probing of the ophthalmic artery a marked reduction in its blood flow occurred. Despite post-interventional imaging showing persisting perfusion of the central retinal and ciliary arteries, the patient developed complete loss of vision on this side four days later. At this time fundoscopy and fluorescein angiography revealed a recanalized central artery occlusion, while indocyanin angiography showed infarctions of the choroid. Radiological intervention via the ophthalmic artery can result in complete loss of vision, even after limited and <b>transient</b> <b>obstruction</b> of the vessel...|$|E
40|$|Two elderly {{patients}} who had endoscopic sphincterotomy (EST) for their common duct stones developed acute cholangitis and, one of them also developed acute pancreatitis after the procedure. Despite {{the presence of an}} adequate sphincterotomy which allows subsequent spontaneous stone elimination, <b>transient</b> ductal <b>obstruction</b> during stone migration through the sectioned papilla is probably accountable for their complications. From the present reported experience, it is clear that expectant treatment of common duct stone after EST can be associated with definite hazards.

40|$|Objectives. Electrical {{stimulation}} of the dorsal aspect of the upper thoracic spinal cord is used increasingly to treat patients with angina pectoris refractory to conventional therapeutic strategies. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine whether spinal cord stimulation (SCS) in dogs affects regional myocardial blood flow and left-ventricular (LV) function before and during <b>transient</b> <b>obstruction</b> of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD). Methods. In anesthetized dogs, regional myocardial blood flow distribution was determined using radiolabeled microspheres and left-ventricular function was measured by impedance-derived pressure-volume loops. SCS was accomplished by stimulating the dorsal T 1 -T 2 segments of the spinal cord using epidural bipolar electrodes at 90 % of motor threshold (MT) (50 Hz, 0. 2 -ms duration). Effects of 5 -min SCS were assessed under basal conditions and during 4 -min occlusion of the LAD. Results. SCS alone evoked no change in regional myocardial blood flow or cardiovascular indices. Transient LAD occlusion significantly diminished blood flow within ischemic, but not in non-ischemic myocardial tissue. Left ventricular pressure-volume loops were shifted rightward during LAD occlusion. Cardiac indices were altered similarly during LAD occlusion and concurrent SCS. Conclusions. SCS does not influence the distribution of blood flow within the non-ischemic or ischemic myocardium. Nor does it modify LV pressure-volume dynamics in the anesthetized experimental preparation.

40|$|A 40 -year-old Hindustani male, with a past {{medical history}} of acetic acid intoxication, {{presented}} to the emergency department with cramping epigastric pain. The pain was reminiscent of the pain he had experi-enced 2 weeks before. At that time, his pain had resolved at presentation to the emergency department and he was discharged home with a proton pump inhibitor for the diagnosis of “peptic ulcer”. An ultrasound performed {{on the following day}} showed a dilated small intestine with intra-luminal fluid sugges-tive of a period of <b>transient</b> <b>obstruction.</b> The ultrasound (Fig. 1) and subsequent abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan (Fig. 2 a,b) made during the present visit to the emergency department, with his pain still present, depict two intra-luminal foreign bodies. A bezoar is an accumulation of ingested foreign material. Three major categories exist, depending on their composition: trichobezoar, formed by ingested hair, phar-macobezoar, formed by indigestible medication contents, and phytobezoar formed by indigestible food fibres, most commonly the diospyrobezoar, which consists of persim-mon fruit, which was eaten by our patient in large quantities [1, 2]. The indigestible food fibres form a mass and finally an obstructive ileus. Diagnosis is usually made by CT scan or ultrasound. Conservative treatment modalities described are endoscopic removal, pulverizing the bezoar with YAG laser therapy or extra-corporal shock wave lithotripsy, or chemical dissolution of the bezoar with for instance cellulase or Coca-Cola [2, 3].

40|$|Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, also {{referred}} to as stress-induced cardiomyopathy, is an acute condition associated with transient left ventricular dysfunction. Since it can be induced by increased emotional stress (such as losing a loved one or constant anxiety) it is also called the broken heart syndrome. This type of cardiomyopathy occurs in all age groups and both sexes, but it is most common in postmenopausal women. There are several clinical manifestations such as chest pain, sometimes with heart failure, and often with ST-segment changes that may present as acute coronary syndrome. It is characterized by absence of coronary artery obstruction, with transient regional wall motion abnormalities and minimal elevation of cardiac enzyme levels. Although wall motion abnormalities are reversible in almost all cases, and long-term prognosis is excellent, this condition is important because in the acute phase it may cause sudden cardiac death. Mechanisms and cause of this disease still remain unclear. Some possible causes of the disorder include: 1) coronary artery vasospasm, 2) microcirculatory dysfunction, 3) <b>transient</b> <b>obstruction</b> of the left ventricular outflow tract, and 4) excessive release of catecholamine, which seems to have the most important role.

40|$|Abstract. The histopathologic changes induced in F 344 rat kidney by oral {{administration}} of melamine for 13 -week and 2 -year periods in studies {{conducted by the}} National Toxicology Program, NIH, 25 from 1976 to 1983 have been re-evaluated and described in detail. A constellation of tubule changes extending from papilla to cortex consistently included tubule dilatation and tubule basophilia as salient features at the subchronic time point. By 2 years, these lesions had usually resolved into fibrotic scars, in which tubule loss and collagen deposition were prominent, running from superficial cortex into the medulla. These fibrotic lesions required discrimination from chronic scars resulting from infarcts and foci of chronic progressive nephropathy (CPN). A case is presented here for interpreting the constellation of histologic changes induced in rats by melamine as representing an ascending form of nephropathy. The term retrograde nephropathy {{is considered to be}} the appropriate nomenclature for both the acute and chronic lesions. The cause for the reflux, emanating from the lower urinary tract, appeared not to be infection as an inflammatory response was not prominent. It can be speculated that melamine precipitation in the lower urinary tract created pressure effects through <b>transient</b> <b>obstruction</b> leading to the renal changes. These changes were different from those involved in a major US outbreak of renal disease and death in cats and dogs associated with triazine-contaminated pet food, in which crystalluria from insoluble melamine/cyanuric acid complexes occurred in the kidney. However, the rat findings may be relevant to melamine-associated kidney disease recently reported in infants in China.

40|$|Allergic asthma is a {{respiratory}} disease induced {{by exposure to}} environmental agents that elicit allergic inflammation and <b>transient</b> airway <b>obstruction</b> and which produce the characteristic symptoms of cough and dyspnea. Prior to the advent of experimental models, asthma {{was believed to be}} caused primarily by the degranulation of mast cells and eosinophils primed by antigen-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE). More recent studies in mice have shown that T cells primarily mediate antigen-dependent airway obstruction and allergic inflammation through secretion of the cytokines interleukin 4 (IL- 4) and IL- 13. Our additional studies indicate that a major environmental link to asthma may be through exposure to environmental proteinases and especially airway infection by proteinase-producing organisms such as fungi. Pending verification in humans, these findings suggest entirely new therapeutic interventions in asthma that include the restricted use of anti-inflammatory therapy and universal application of anti-fungal agents...|$|R

This study evaluates the diagnostic potential of plasma aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin on the day of admission to hospital in 215 attacks of acute pancreatitis. The optimal diagnostic cut-off level for AST was 60 IU/ 1. A transient elevation above 60 IU/ 1 was recorded in 111 (84. 1 %) of 132 attacks associated with gallstones, but in only 12 (14. 5 %) of 83 attacks without stones, and was unrelated to the severity of the attack. Elevated levels of alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin were also more common in attacks associated with gallstones but were less reliable for the identification of cholelithiasis than AST. As a sensitive indicator of hepatocyte disruption, the early and transient rise in plasma AST is consistent with the concept of <b>transient</b> ampullary <b>obstruction</b> in gallstone pancreatitis, and may be useful in identifying patients who require urgent surgical or endoscopic disimpaction...|$|R

The auto-CPAP response to <b>transient</b> nasal <b>obstruction</b> was tested during sleep in patients with sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome (SAHS).  METHODS—Nasal obstruction was induced by local instillation of histamine. Fourteen nasal challenges were performed on eight patients, seven while the patients were on the "Morphée plus" apparatus and the other seven with the patients on the "Horizon" machine.  RESULTS—Nasal resistance increased initially by a mean (SD) of 166 (66) % during the trials with the "Morphée plus" and by 118 (44) % with the "Horizon" machine. The increase in nasal resistance was always accompanied by flow limitation with one exception. Mask pressure initially decreased to the minimal permitted value as nasal resistance increased with the "Morphée plus" device. A late increase of the positive pressure level occurred sometimes. Mask pressure did not change with increasing nasal resistance when the "Horizon" device was used.  CONCLUSION—Neither the "Morphée plus" nor the "Horizon" device abolished flow limited breaths and resulting sleep fragmentation. We conclude that, despite the different algorithm of pressure changes, these auto-CPAP machines do not adequately respond to an acute increase in nasal resistance. ...|$|R
40|$|The airway mucosal {{response}} to allergen in asthma involves influx of activated T helper type 2 cells and eosinophils, <b>transient</b> airflow <b>obstruction,</b> and airways hyperresponsiveness (AHR). The mechanism(s) underlying transient T cell activation during this inflammatory response is unclear. We present {{evidence that this}} response is regulated via bidirectional interactions between airway mucosal dendritic cells (AMDC) and T memory cells. After aerosol challenge, resident AMDC acquire antigen and rapidly mature into potent antigen-presenting cells (APCs) after cognate interactions with T memory cells. This process is restricted to dendritic cells (DCs) in the mucosae of the conducting airways, and is not seen in peripheral lung. Within 24 h, antigen-bearing mature DCs disappear from the airway wall, leaving in their wake activated interleukin 2 R � T cells and AHR. Antigen-bearing activated DCs appear in regional lymph nodes at 24 h, suggesting onward migration from the airway. Transient up-regulation of CD 86 on AMDC accompanies this process, which can be reproduced by coculture of resting AMDC with T memory cells plus antigen. The APC activity of AMDC can be partially inhibited by anti-CD 86, suggesting that CD 86 may {{play an active role}} in this process and/or is a surrogat...|$|R

40|$|A single deep {{inspiration}} (DI) {{is commonly}} followed by <b>transient</b> airflow <b>obstruction</b> in asthmatic patients. In some patients, however, DI {{results in a}} sustained response which suggests {{that more than one}} mechanism may be responsible. We have studied the characteristics of the response to repeated DI, and their modificatiion by various pharmacological agents, by measuring specific airway resistance (sRaw) in ten subjects who showed reproducible and consistent increases in sRaw after DI. Two types of reaction were observed: type A (n = 8) had an immediate maximum and usually short persistence; type B (n = 2) had a delayed maximum with a progressive increase. In type A reactions repetition of DI showed different patterns of response [...] either a reproducible reaction to each DI or a plateau effect. In type B reactions the response spontaneously increased with repeated DI. Type A responses to DI were inhibited completely by a beta-adrenergic stimulant (BAS), largely by an anticholinergic drug (AC, ipratropium bromide), but in no case by disodium cromoglycate (DSCG). Type B responses were inhibited completely by BAS, largely by DSCG, and partially by AC.

40|$|Although the {{protective}} effect of <b>transient</b> ureteral <b>obstruction</b> (UO) prior to ischemia on subsequent renal ischemia/ reperfusion (I/R) injury has been documented, the underlying molecular mechanism {{remains to be}} understood. We showed {{in the current study}} that 24 h of UO led to renal tubular hypoxia in the ipsilateral kidney in mice, with the accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) - 2 a, which lasted for a week after the release of UO. To address the functions of HIF- 2 a in UOmediated protection of renal IRI, we utilized the Mx-Cre/loxP recombination system to knock out target genes. Inactivation of HIF- 2 a, but not HIF- 1 a blunted the renal protective effects of UO, as demonstrated by much higher serum creatinine level and severer histological damage. UO failed to prevent postischemic neutrophil infiltration and apoptosis induction in HIF- 2 a knockout mice, which also diminished the postobstructive up-regulation of {{the protective}} molecule, heat shock protein (HSP) - 27. The renal protective effects of UO were associated with the improvement of the postischemic recovery of intrarenal microvascular blood flow, which was also dependent on the activation of HIF- 2 a. Our results demonstrated that UO protected the kidney via activation of HIF- 2 a, which reduced tubular damages via preservation of adequate renal microvascular perfusion after ischemia.

Exercise-induced bronchospasm is observed in healthy individuals as well as the asthmatic and allergic rhinitis patients. Research question: The study compared the effects of one session of submaximal aerobic exercise and a maximal one on the prevalence of exercise-induced bronchospasm in non-athletic students. Type of study: An experimental study, using human subjects, was designed. Methods: 20 non-athletic male students participated in two sessions of aerobic exercise. The prevalence of EIB was investigated among them. The criteria for assessing exercise-induced bronchospasm were ≥ 10 % fall in FEV 1, ≥ 15 % fall in FEF 25 - 75 %, or ≥ 25 % fall in PEFR. Results: The results revealed that the maximal exercise did not affect FEF 25 - 75 % and PEF, but it led to a meaningful reduction in FEV 1. Contrarily, the submaximal exercise affected none of these indices. That is, in both protocols the same result was obtained for PEF and FEF 25 - 75. Moreover, the prevalence of EIB was 15 % in the submaximal exercise and 20 % in the maximal one. Actually, this difference was significant. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that in contrast to the subjects who performed submaximal exercise, those who participated in the maximal protocol showed more changes in the pulmonary function indices and the prevalence of EIB was greater among them...|$|R

In this model, <b>transient</b> ureteral <b>obstruction</b> after E. coli bladder inoculation induces early bacterial multiplication in the kidney parenchyma, and the bacterial counts peak by 48 h. The inflammatory response (assessed by the increase in kidney weight) is somewhat delayed, starting 36 h after inoculation and peaking by 72 h. Groups of rats received 4 doses over 48 h of saline, ceftriaxone (100 mg/kg), or ceftriaxone (100 mg/kg) plus gentamicin (4 mg/kg). These treatments were initiated 24, 36, 48, or 72 h after bladder inoculation. Antibiotic treatment started at 24 h was significantly more effective in reducing bacterial counts in the kidney parenchyma than at any later therapy onset. Only when started 24 h after inoculation was the synergistic combination of ceftriaxone plus gentamicin more effective in reducing bacterial counts than ceftriaxone alone. Ceftriaxone and ceftriaxone plus gentamicin regimens started at 24 h reduced significantly (by 42 and 55 %, respectively) the incidence of acute exudative pyelonephritis {{when compared with the}} incidence in saline-treated controls. Early therapy onset (24 h) strikingly reduced the development of the inflammatory response. This reduction was less marked when antibiotic therapy was started at 36 h and no longer apparent when therapy onset was delayed up to 48 or 72 h. In conclusion, the efficacy of antibiotics in eradicating bacteria from the kidney parenchyma and in preventing acute exudative pyelonephritis was markedly hampered by the development of pyelonephritis...|$|R

Toxicity risk was escalated from 5 % to 10 % and 20 %, within three liver volume-irradiated strata, provided at least three patients were without toxicity at 3 months after SBRT. RESULTS: Forty-one patients with unresectable Child-Pugh A HCC (n = 31) or IHC (n = 10) completed six-fraction SBRT. Five patients (12 %) had grade 3 liver enzymes at baseline. The median tumor size was 173 mL (9 to 1, 913 mL). The median dose was 36. 0 Gy (24. 0 to 54. 0 Gy). No radiation-induced liver disease or treatment-related grade 4 / 5 toxicity was seen within 3 months after SBRT. Grade 3 liver enzymes were seen in five patients (12 %). Two patients (5 %) with IHC developed <b>transient</b> biliary <b>obstruction</b> {{after the first few}} fractions. Seven patients (five HCC, two IHC) had decline in liver function from Child-Pugh class A to B within 3 months after SBRT. Median survival of HCC and IHC patients was 11. 7 months (95 % CI, 9. 2 to 21. 6 months) and 15. 0 months (95 % CI, 6. 5 to 29. 0 months), respectively. CONCLUSION: Individualized six-fraction SBRT is a safe treatment for unresectable HCC and IHC...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND—Sphincter of Oddi {{dysfunction}} {{has been}} implicated {{as a cause}} of various forms of acute pancreatitis. However, there is no direct evidence to show that sphincter of Oddi dysfunction can cause obstruction of trans-sphincteric flow resulting in acute pancreatitis.  AIMS—To determine if induced sphincter of Oddi spasm can produce trans-sphincteric obstruction and, in combination with stimulated pancreatic secretion, induce acute pancreatitis.  METHODS—In anaesthetised possums, the pancreatic duct was ligated and pancreatic exocrine secretion stimulated by cholecystokinin octapeptide/secretin to induce acute pancreatitis. In separate animals, carbachol was applied topically to the sphincter of Oddi to cause <b>transient</b> sphincter <b>obstruction.</b> Sphincter of Oddi motility, trans-sphincteric flow, pancreatic duct pressure, pancreatic exocrine secretion, plasma amylase levels, and pancreatic tissue damage (histology score) were studied and compared with variables in ligation models.  RESULTS—Acute pancreatitis developed following stimulation of pancreatic exocrine secretion with peptides after pancreatic duct ligation (p< 0. 05). Neither pancreatic duct ligation nor stimulation of pancreatic exocrine secretion with cholecystokinin octapeptide/secretin alone resulted in acute pancreatitis. Topical carbachol stimulated sphincter of Oddi motility abolished trans-sphincteric flow, and increased pancreatic exocrine secretion (p< 0. 05) and pancreatic duct pressure to levels comparable with pancreatic duct ligation (p< 0. 001). Carbachol application (with or without combined peptide stimulation) elevated plasma amylase levels (p< 0. 01) and produced pancreatic tissue damage (p< 0. 05). Decompression of pancreatic duct ameliorated these effects (p< 0. 05).  CONCLUSION—Induced sphincter of Oddi dysfunction when coupled with stimulated pancreatic secretion causes acute pancreatitis. This may be an important pathophysiological mechanism causing various forms of acute pancreatitis.    Keywords: acute pancreatitis; sphincter of Oddi; cholecystokinin octapeptide; possu...|$|R
40|$|UNLABELLED: Remote ischemic {{preconditioning}} (RIPC), the repetitive <b>transient</b> mechanical <b>obstruction</b> {{of vessels}} at a limb remote to the operative site, {{is a novel}} strategy to mitigate distant organ injury associated with surgery. In the clinic, RIPC has demonstrated efficacy in protecting various organs against ischemia reperfusion (IR), but a common mechanism underlying the systemic protection has not been identified. Here, we reasoned that protection may rely on adaptive physiological responses toward local stress, as is incurred through RIPC. Standardized mouse models of partial hepatic IR and of RIPC to the femoral vascular bundle were applied. The roles of platelets, peripheral serotonin, and circulating vascular endothelial growth factor (Vegf) were studied in thrombocytopenic mice, Tph 1 (-) (/) (-) mice, and through neutralizing antibodies, respectively. Models of interleukin- 10 (Il 10) and matrix metalloproteinase 8 (Mmp 8) deficiency {{were used to assess}} downstream effectors of organ protection. The protection against hepatic IR through RIPC was dependent on platelet-derived serotonin. Downstream of serotonin, systemic protection was spread through up-regulation of circulating Vegf. Both RIPC and serotonin-Vegf induced differential gene expression in target organs, with Il 10 and Mmp 8 displaying consistent up-regulation across all organs investigated. Concerted inhibition of both molecules abolished the protective effects of RIPC. RIPC was able to mitigate pancreatitis, indicating that it can protect beyond ischemic insults. CONCLUSIONS: We have identified a platelet-serotonin-Vegf-Il 10 /Mmp 8 axis that mediates the protective effects of RIPC. The systemic action, the conservation of RIPC effects among mice and humans, and the protection beyond ischemic insults suggest that the platelet-dependent axis has evolved as a preemptive response to local stress, priming the body against impending harm...|$|R
40|$|The {{functional}} {{disorder of}} the gallbladder (GB) is a motility disorder caused initially either by metabolic abnormalities or by a primary motility alteration. The functional disorders of the sphincter of Oddi (SO) encompass motor abnormalities {{of either the}} biliary or the pancreatic SO. Dysfunction of the 1313 and/or billary SO produce similar patterns of pain. The pain caused by a dysfunction of the pancreatic SO can be {{similar to that of}} acute pancreatitis. The symptom-based diagnostic criteria of motility dysfunction of the GB and biliary SO are episodes of moderate to severe steady pain located in the epigastrium and right upper abdominal quadrant that last at least 30 minutes. GB motility disorder is suspected after gallstones and other structural abnormalities have been excluded. This diagnosis should then be confirmed by a decreased GB ejection fraction induced by cholecystokinin at cholescintigraphy and after disappearance of the recurrent biliary pain after cholecystectomy. Symptoms of biliary SO dysfunction may be accompanied by features of <b>transient</b> biliary <b>obstruction,</b> and those of pancreatic SO dysfunction are associated with elevation of pancreatic enzymes and even pancreatitis. Biliary-type SO dysfunction is more frequently recognized in postcholecystectomy patients. SO manometry is valuable to select patients with sphincter dysfunction; however, because of the high incidence of complications, these patients should be referred to an expert unit for such assessment. Thus invasive tests should be performed only in the presence of compelling clinical evidence and after noninvasive testing has yielded negative findings. The committee recommends that division of the biliary or pancreatic sphincters only be considered when the patient has severe symptoms, meets the required criteria, and other diagnoses are excluded...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: This article {{reports the}} results of {{segmental}} reversal of the small bowel on parenteral nutrition dependency in patients with very short bowel syndrome. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Segmental reversal of the small bowel {{could be seen as}} an acceptable alternative to intestinal transplantation in patients with very short bowel syndrome deemed to be dependent on home parenteral nutrition. METHODS: Eight patients with short bowel syndrome underwent, at the time of intestinal continuity restoration, a segmental reversal of the distal (n = 7) or proximal (n = 1) small bowel. The median length of the remnant small bowel was 40 cm (range, 25 to 70 cm), including a median length of reversed segment of 12 cm (range, 8 to 15 cm). Five patients presented with jejunotransverse anastomosis, and one each with jejunorectal, jejuno left colonic, or jejunocaecal anastomosis with left colostomy. RESULTS: There were no postoperative deaths. Three patients were reoperated early for wound dehiscence, acute cholecystitis, and sepsis of unknown origin. Three patients experienced <b>transient</b> intestinal <b>obstruction,</b> which was treated conservatively. Median follow-up was 35 months (range, 2 to 108 months). One patient died of pulmonary embolism 7 months postoperatively. By the end of follow-up, three patients were on 100 % oral nutrition, one had fluid and electrolyte infusions only, and, in the four other patients, parenteral nutrition regimen was reduced to four (range of 3 to 5) cyclic nocturnal infusions per week. Parenteral nutrition cessation was obtained in 3 of 5 patients at 1 years and in 3 of 3 patients at 4 years. CONCLUSION: Segmental reversal of the small bowel could be proposed as an alternative to intestinal transplantation in patients with short bowel syndrome before the possible occurrence of parenteral nutrition-related complications, because weaning for parenteral nutrition (four patients) or reduction of the frequency of infusions (four patients) was observed in the current study...|$|R
