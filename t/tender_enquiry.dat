40|$|Procurement of Goods and {{services}} at NIT Rourkela is a thorough and long process {{and is currently}} done manually. It involves {{a large number of}} activities including fund allocation to sub-heads, enlistment of Goods and Services, registration of Suppliers etc. The purchase process itself can be done in four different ways - Direct Purchase, Advertised <b>Tender</b> <b>Enquiry,</b> Limited <b>Tender</b> <b>Enquiry</b> and Single <b>Tender</b> <b>Enquiry.</b> Also, the entire process requires the approval of a number of staffs at various stages. For this project, this entire process needs to be automated {{in the form of a}} web-based application. The application would not only make it easy for the staffs and faculties to carry out the purchase process by reducing their workload and lessening the time delays in the process, but also ensure complete transparency. The application would consist of seven different modules for Managing login, Managing Chart of Accounts (Account Categories, Heads, Sub-Heads, Funds, Goods/Services and Suppliers), Managing Direct Purchase, Managing Advertised Tender Enquiries, Managing Limited Tender Enquiries, Managing Single Tender Enquiries and Managing Purchase Requisitions...|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Previous bidding studies have focussed on optimum bid pricing and several approaches have been proposed for this problem. Unfortunately, {{there are problems with}} each of these approaches and so to date there is no generally accepted approach to bid pricing. Furthermore. bid pricing is only {{one of a series of}} interrelated decisions that need to be addressed when formulating an overall bidding strategy. For many organisations decisions concerning whether or not to bid and the level of resources to allocate to bid preparation are equally important. Both of these areas, however, have received scant attention from the academic community, Together these observations suggest that radically different approaches for improving bidding performance should be investigated. Expert systems display several characteristics which suggest that they offer a possible route to further progress in work on bidding and this thesis explores the possible roles and benefits that expert systems can provide in this area. In particular this thesis describes a case study concerning the development of an expert support system for <b>tender</b> <b>enquiry</b> evaluation. The system was developed for use by the senior management of a large electro-mechanical engineering company to assist with their decisions concerning whether or not to bid and the level of resources to allocate to bid preparation. In the case considered the expertise of two senior managers involved in a sessing enquiries was developed into an expert supportsystem. Knowledge was elicited from these managers by asking them to consider previous tenders and specify the factors used in discriminating between them. Their responses were represented in repertory grids, A subsequent validation study suggested that the system developed provides an appropriate model of the organisation's consensual business perspective regarding its bid versus no bid and bid resourcing decisions. Furthermore, collaboration helped the organisation to clarify its bidding expertise in a changing business envirorunent. In particular, it highlighted the organisation's current bidding policy and forced the organisation to reconsider what its ideal policy should be. It also drew attention to some dissenting views amongst the organisation's senior management and highlighted possible weaknesses within their own expertise. frIn summary, the resulting expert support system was perceived to improve both the objectivity and consistency of the organisation's enquiry review group and was generally welcomed by the organisation. " It is concluded that expert systems are appropriate tools for modelling competitive bidding situations. However, owing to the nature of bidding domains and non-formal managerial domains in general. the case study suggests that several problems need to be addressed if commercially viable systems are to be developed. Most importantly of which are the identification of appropriate development and validation methodologies in domains characterised by multiple unarticulated experiential based models...|$|E

60|$|The thin grey {{smoke that}} rose in {{different}} directions was a beacon to the charitable visits of Miss Temple. It was evident {{that she was a}} visitor both habitual and beloved. Each cottage-door was familiar to her entrance. The children smiled at her approach; their mothers rose and courtesied with affectionate respect. How many names and how many wants had she to remember! yet nothing was forgotten. Some were rewarded for industry, some were admonished not to be idle; but all were treated with an engaging suavity more efficacious than gifts or punishments. The aged were solaced by her visit; the sick forgot their pains; and, as she listened with sympathising patience to long narratives of rheumatic griefs, it seemed her presence in each old chair, her <b>tender</b> <b>enquiries</b> and sanguine hopes, brought even more comfort than her plenteous promises of succour from the Bower, in the shape of arrowroot and gruel, port wine and flannel petticoats.|$|R
