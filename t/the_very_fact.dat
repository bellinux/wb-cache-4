5|$|At common law, if a party {{resisted}} arrest by {{an officer}} without warrant {{and who had}} no right to arrest him, and if in the course of that resistance the officer was killed, the offense of the party resisting arrest would be reduced from what would have been murder if the officer had had the right to arrest, to manslaughter. What would be murder if the officer had the right to arrest might be reduced to manslaughter by <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>fact</b> that he had no such right. So an officer, at common law, was not authorized to make an arrest without a warrant, for a mere misdemeanor not committed in his presence.|$|E

The brain tires of resistance, and when it meets again and again, incoherently active, the same phrases, the same ideas that it has already slain, exposed and dissected and buried, it becomes less and less energetic to repeat the operation. There must be something, one feels, in ideas that achieve persistently a successful resurrection. What Miss Miniver would have called the Higher Truth supervenes.|$|R

At notable Muslim gatherings, he argued that the Muslims, in their attempt to regenerate themselves, had failed to realise that mankind had entered a very important phase of its existence—an era of science and learning. Despite harsh criticism from the Islamic orthodoxy, he helped convince many Muslim communities to realise that <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>fact</b> was the source of progress and prosperity for the British. Therefore, modern education became the pivot of his movement for regeneration of the Indian Muslims. He tried to transform the Muslim outlook from a medieval one to a modern one.|$|E

500|$|I, the Supreme (orig. Spanish Yo el supremo) is a {{historical}} novel written by exiled Paraguayan author Augusto Roa Bastos. It is a fictionalized account of the nineteenth-century Paraguayan dictator José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia, who was also known as [...] "Dr. Francia." [...] The book's title derives {{from the fact that}} Francia referred to himself as [...] "El Supremo" [...] or [...] "the Supreme." [...] The first {{in a long line of}} dictators, the Supreme was a severe, calculating despot. [...] The central themes of the novel are power and language and the relation between the two.

[...] Yet this assertion is constantly challenged by <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>fact</b> that while he achieves power by means of writing and dictating, these very same methods can be used by others to dispute his authority. Not even his own identity, represented by the personal pronoun I, is safe and can easily be usurped as is demonstrated by the incident of the pasquinade.

40|$|Sofa, carpet, {{dressing}} table, to name more─Katherine Mansfield always {{sets up a}} rich {{variety of}} domestic objects to create images of morden wives and family in her stories. Although domestic objects {{are nothing more than}} ordinary and everyday life objects, for Mansfield, they are not only generate a unique atmosphere of dramatic settings, but also give vivid forms to conflicts between family members, in particular the husband and the wife. The significance of domestic objects, for husbands and wives, quite differs. Putting Victorian domesticity which conventionally models the woman as “the angel in the house” into a great contrast, Mansfield delicately scrutinizes the implicit social and psychological tensions between husbands and wives through specific items or objects. Concentrating on Mansfield's three short stories, including Bliss(1918), Mr. Reginald Peacock's Day(1920), and Marriage a la Mode(1921), this paper suggests that domestic objects, in which a construction of femininity is embodied from male perspectives, represent <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>facts</b> and depths of the husband's frustration and loneliness in response to the wife's growing self-realization and self-awareness of her own freedom and agency...|$|R
