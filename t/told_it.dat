5|$|The Philistines were infuriated by the riddle. The thirty groomsmen told Samson's {{new wife}} {{that they would}} burn her and her father's {{household}} {{if she did not}} discover the answer to the riddle and tell it to them. At the urgent and tearful imploring of his bride, Samson told her the solution, and she <b>told</b> <b>it</b> to the thirty groomsmen.|$|E
5|$|To {{defy the}} prophecies, Oleg sent the horse away. Many {{years later he}} asked where his horse was, and was <b>told</b> <b>it</b> had died. He asked to see the remains and {{was taken to the}} place where the bones lay. When he touched the horse's skull with his boot a snake slithered from the skull and bit him. Oleg died, thus {{fulfilling}} the prophecy.|$|E
5|$|Ivan ends {{his story}} {{deep in thought}} as Vasilisa begins to cry and Lukerya looks on in pain. He parts with the widows and {{continues}} homeward, thinking that his story troubled Lukerya and made Vasilisa weep not because he <b>told</b> <b>it</b> well but because the tale was relevant to them nineteen centuries later. As he rides the ferry to his village, Ivan comes to believe that truth and beauty serve as the connectors of all human history and he is filled with joy and awe at life itself.|$|E

5|$|One {{young boy}} {{reported}} having observed {{the ghost of}} Murrell collecting herbs at some point after this death; he passed this story on to his daughter, who <b>told</b> <b>it</b> to Maple. Hadleigh also had other ghost lore traditions, surrounding figures known as the White Lady and the Black Man, the latter being a prince and the former a woman who would allegedly invite passers by to join her in a waltz through the ruins of Hadleigh Castle.|$|E
5|$|The 5 o'clock wave is {{a fictional}} theory on {{the reasons for}} Wagga Wagga's {{sporting}} success. According to the local urban myth, at precisely 5 o'clock arrives a giant wave which flushes a secret nutrient into the Murrumbidgee River following the release {{of water from the}} Blowering and Burrinjuck Dams. The wave is said to continue down river at high speed, and indeed visitors are <b>told</b> <b>it</b> is so powerful that surfers can ride it along the meandering river until it reaches the town of Narrandera.|$|E
5|$|The Koryak {{of eastern}} Siberia {{have a story}} about the fly agaric (wapaq) which enabled Big Raven to carry a whale to its home. In the story, the deity Vahiyinin ("Existence") spat onto earth, and his spittle became the wapaq, and his saliva becomes the warts. After {{experiencing}} the power of the wapaq, Raven was so exhilarated that he <b>told</b> <b>it</b> to grow forever on earth so his children, the people, could learn from it. Among the Koryaks, one report said that the poor would consume the urine of the wealthy, who could afford to buy the mushrooms.|$|E

5|$|The Griffins, the Swansons, and Quagmire {{prepare for}} a road trip, ostensibly for a {{vacation}} in Maine. Quagmire distracts Bonnie and Lois as Peter alters course to Virginia instead. The group arrives at a bar in Stoolbend, Virginia, and discover that it was Cleveland who told the bartender the joke. Peter asks Cleveland where he first heard the joke, and Cleveland reveals that a Washington, D.C., bellhop named Sal Russo <b>told</b> <b>it</b> to him. The group sets out for D.C. with Cleveland in tow. They are attacked by a black car, whose occupants fire guns at them {{to prevent them from}} learning the joke's origin. Joe shoots out one of the car's tires, causing it to spin out of control and flip onto its roof. The Quahog group arrive at a Washington hotel and locate Sal, who is reluctant to reveal the source of the joke. He races away on a handcart through Washington. Losing track of Sal, they are soon captured by several men in black suits who pistol-whip them until they are unconscious.|$|E
5|$|The {{script was}} {{originally}} too long, {{and as a}} result many sequences had to be cut, some even after they had been filmed. These included a fight scene with the Doctor and Rosanna's steward (Simon Gregor), a longer fight sequence between Rory and Francesco, and some dialogue between the Doctor and Amy following the climax. In the original script, Amy and Rory cornered Francesco after suspecting him of killing a villager and Francesco climbed up the wall. Whithouse thought this would be a relatively easy stunt, but was <b>told</b> <b>it</b> would be too hard to accomplish and Whithouse revised it to when Francesco simply runs away. When discussing the script with Whithouse, Helen McCrory, who portrayed Rosanna, thought that she should hurt Amy at some point and it was added that she bites Amy while she is in the chamber.|$|E

25|$|Despite the {{cancellation}} of the project there remains some support for it, either in whole or part, chiefly from the Liberal Party at state and federal level.

50|$|Korea’s {{publishing}} world {{is concentrated in}} Paju Book City, an hour’s drive north of Seoul. Inspired by Hay-on-Wye, Paju is a turbocharged version {{of the town of}} books.

The national parliament discussed this law in October 2011.|$|E
25|$|The {{sinking of}} the ship was a severe blow to Britain during these {{early years of the}} war. When the {{officers}} heard the story of Lassie and what she did to rescue Cowan, they <b>told</b> <b>it</b> again and again to any reporter who would listen as it was inspirational and heart-warming. In 1938 the novel 'Lassie come home' was published by author Eric Knight and might have been inspired by this tale. Hollywood got hold of the story, and so a star was born.|$|E

25|$|Veteran {{republicans}} were {{critical of the}} IRA's Dublin leadership which, for political reasons, had refused to prepare for aggressive action {{in advance of the}} violence. On 24 August Joe Cahill, Seamus Twomey, Dáithí Ó Conaill, Billy McKee and several other future Provisional leaders came together in Belfast intending to remove the Belfast leadership and turn back to traditional militant republicanism. Although the pro-Goulding commander Billy McMillen stayed in command, he was <b>told</b> <b>it</b> was only for three months and he was not to have any communication with the IRA's Dublin based leadership.|$|E
25|$|The post-McGraw Giants were {{punctuated by}} two famous moments, the Shot Heard 'Round the World (1951) and The Catch by young superstar Willie Mays (1954). In the mid-1950s, the Polo Grounds was in {{disrepair}} and the Giants began to contemplate a move from New York. The Brooklyn Dodgers were considering {{a move to}} Los Angeles but were <b>told</b> <b>it</b> {{would not be allowed}} unless a second team moved to California as well. As a result, the Giants agreed to move to San Francisco and New York was left without a National League team until the New York Mets in 1962.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, the Chicago Cubs awarded Sosa's # 21 to new pitcher Jason Marquis, {{despite the fact}} that it was {{formerly}} worn by Sosa, who coincidentally later hit his 600th home run against Marquis. Ted Lilly, who had also signed with the Cubs that prior winter had requested #31 but was <b>told</b> <b>it</b> was not available as it was going to be retired for Greg Maddux and Fergie Jenkins, and they were just waiting for Maddux to retire. This caused some concern, due to Sosa's accomplishments with the Cubs, including his status as the Cubs' all-time home run leader.|$|E
