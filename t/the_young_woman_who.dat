500|$|Sargent's {{marriage}} was unhappy {{and ended in}} divorce in 1946. Before, during and after his marriage, Sargent was a continual womaniser, a {{fact that he did}} not deny. His liaisons with powerful women began early, in Stamford, when he was still conducting the Gilbert and Sullivan shows attended by the London gentry who came to join the Melton Mowbray hunt. Among his affairs were long-standing ones with Diana Bowes-Lyon, Princess Marina and Edwina Mountbatten. More casual encounters are typified by <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> said, [...] "Promise me that whatever happens I shan't have to go home alone in a taxi with Malcolm Sargent." ...|$|E

500|$|Bowie was {{the ninth}} of ten {{children}} born to Reason (or Rezin) and Elve Ap-Catesby Jones (or Johns) Bowie. His father had been wounded while fighting in the American Revolutionary War, and in 1782 married <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> had nursed him back to health. The Bowies first settled in Georgia and then moved to Kentucky. At the time of Bowie's birth, his father owned eight slaves, eleven head of cattle, seven horses, and one stud horse.

They sold that property in 1800 and relocated {{to what is now}} Missouri, before moving to Spanish Louisiana in 1802, where they settled on Bushley Bayou in what soon became Rapides Parish.|$|E
2500|$|Sarah Laumann was {{attacked}} {{on the night}} of September 3, 1919. Neighbors came to check on <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>woman,</b> <b>who</b> had lived alone, and broke into the home when Laumann did not answer. They discovered the 19-year-old lying unconscious on her bed, suffering from a severe head injury and missing several teeth. The intruder had entered the apartment through an open window, and attacked the woman with a blunt object. [...] A bloody axe was discovered on the front lawn of the building.

2500|$|Blixen's former {{secretary}} and house manager, Clara Svendsen wrote a book, Notes about Karen Blixen (...) in 1974, which {{told of the}} transformation of <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> moved to Africa into the sophisticated writer. Giving personal anecdotes about Blixen's life, Svendsen focused on the private woman behind her public image. Blixen's great-nephew, Anders Westenholz, an accomplished writer himself, wrote two books about her and her works: Kraftens horn: myte og virkelighed i Karen Blixens liv (1982) (translated into English as The Power of Aries: myth and reality in Karen Blixen's life and republished in 1987) and Den glemte abe: mand og kvinde hos Karen Blixen (1985) (The Forgotten Ape: man and woman in Karen Blixen).|$|E

2500|$|Swift's {{diatribe}} is {{in considerable}} {{contrast to the}} elegiac La Grisette, by Oliver Wendell Holmes [...] a century later. Written in 1836, shortly after he had returned to Boston from his medical studies in Paris, it expresses not only nostalgia for <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> had been his lover but also for Paris itself and all that it represented. It was a nostalgia shared by many of his American contemporaries who had studied there. Holmes' description of Clemence reflects a frequent 19th century perception of the grisette as an attentive and self-effacing companion to the starving artists and romantic [...] students of bohemia. Her early death, alluded to in the poem, was not unusual. Many grisettes died of tuberculosis both in real life and in their fictional portrayals, e.g. Mimi in Scènes de la vie de Bohème and Fantine in Les Misérables.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the same}} time, media {{reported}} that {{two men had}} been arrested during a raid at a nearby warehouse {{in connection with the}} case. The arrests were made by heavily armed police from the Delta Unit in an operation set up after receiving a lead from a member of the public. The two men, Chris Kenneth Giske, aged 37, and his unidentified colleague, aged 64, were charged with murder and being an accessory to murder. The 64-year-old had no prior criminal record, but Giske had multiple previous convictions for violent crimes, among them an unprovoked assault on a young woman with a crowbar in 2007. <b>The</b> <b>young</b> <b>woman,</b> <b>who</b> barely survived the attack, suffered a fractured skull, a crush fracture of the head, and a 7-cm cut to the face. Court-appointed psychiatrists, observing Giske at the time, stated that he had anti-social personality disorder, an emotional, unstable personality disorder, and panic disorder. The lawyer for the victim characterized the case as [...] "one of the worst cases I've seen that has not ended in murder". The 23-page psychiatric report from the trial revealed that Giske had suffered from audible hallucinations for over a decade. According to the report, [...] "the voices in his head had commanded him to go out and kill, or physically assault, random people." ...|$|E
