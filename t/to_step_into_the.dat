5|$|Fan {{attention}} {{became so}} intense that Tolkien had to take his phone number {{out of the public}} directory, and eventually he and Edith moved to Bournemouth, which was then a seaside resort patronized by the British upper middle class. Tolkien's status as a best-selling author gave them easy entry into polite society, but Tolkien deeply missed the company of his fellow Inklings. Edith, however, was overjoyed <b>to</b> <b>step</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> role of a society hostess, which had been the reason that Tolkien selected Bournemouth in the first place.|$|E

A {{few days after the}} burial, Leicester City began a winning streak to take them from bottom of the league to comfortably avoiding relegation, and they {{went on to win the}} league the following year. Mayor Peter Soulsby said:For too long, people in Leicester have been modest about their achievements and the city they live in.

5|$|Before the 2003–04 season began, the Spurs {{lost their}} {{perennial}} captain David Robinson to retirement. Embracing the lone team leader role, Duncan led a reformed Spurs team which included Slovenian center Rasho Nesterovič, defensive stalwart Bruce Bowen, Argentinian shooting guard Ginóbili and young French point guard Parker. Coming {{off the bench}} were clutch shooting power forward Robert Horry, versatile Hedo Türkoğlu and veterans Malik Rose and Kevin Willis. In retrospect, Robinson commented that at first, Duncan was reluctant <b>to</b> <b>step</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> void, still needing some time to truly develop his leadership skills. Statistically though, Duncan remained strong; after another convincing season with averages of 22.3 points, 12.4 rebounds, 3.1 assists and 2.7 blocks, he led the Spurs into the Western Conference Semifinals. There, they met the Los Angeles Lakers again, split the series 2–2, and in Game 5, Duncan made a toughly defended jump shot which put the Spurs ahead by one point with 0.4 seconds left to play. Despite the little time remaining, Lakers point guard Derek Fisher hit a buzzer beater for an upset Lakers win. In the end, the Spurs lost the series 4–2, and Duncan attributed the strong Lakers defense {{as one of the}} reasons for the loss.|$|E

5|$|The Mediterranean had at {{this time}} fallen {{into the hands of}} pirates, largely from Cilicia. Rome had {{destroyed}} many of the states that had previously policed the Mediterranean with fleets, but had failed <b>to</b> <b>step</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> gap created. The pirates had seized the opportunity of a relative power vacuum and had not only strangled shipping lanes but had plundered many cities on the coasts of Greece and Asia, and had even made descents upon Italy itself. After the Roman admiral Marcus Antonius Creticus (father of the triumvir Marcus Antonius) failed to clear the pirates to the satisfaction of the Roman authorities, Pompey was nominated his successor as commander of a special naval task force to campaign against them. It supposedly took Pompey just forty days to clear the western portion of the western Mediterranean of pirates, and restore communication between Iberia, Africa, and Italy. Plutarch describes how Pompey first swept their craft from the Mediterranean in a series of small actions and through the promise of honouring the surrender of cities and craft. He then followed {{the main body of the}} pirates to their strongholds on the coast of Cilicia, and destroyed them there in the naval Battle of Korakesion.|$|E

At the entrance, the three parts of the church form a U-shaped external narthex. In total, there are five octahedral domes and six doors. Two enter the narthex, two serve the side chapels and a single door is intended for the priest <b>to</b> <b>step</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> diaconicon.

25|$|The Daily Mail {{newspaper}} recruited Lady Sarah {{after one}} of its correspondents, Ralph Hellawell, was arrested by the Boers {{as he tried to}} get out of the besieged town of Mafeking to send his dispatch.

Baden-Powell asked her to leave Mafeking for her own safety after the Boers threatened to storm the British garrison. This she duly did, and set off on a madcap adventure in the company of her maid, travelling through the South African countryside. Eventually, she was captured by the Boers and returned to the town in exchange for a horse thief being held there.|$|E
25|$|The Hungarian-American {{business}} magnate George Soros warns in “Does the Euro have a Future?” {{that there}} is no escape from the “gloomy scenario” of a prolonged European recession and the consequent threat to the Eurozone’s political cohesion so long as “the authorities persist in their current course.” He argues that to save the Euro long-term structural changes are essential in addition to the immediate steps needed to arrest the crisis. The changes he recommends include even greater economic integration of the European Union. Soros writes that a treaty is needed to transform the European Financial Stability Fund into a full-fledged European Treasury. Following the formation of the Treasury, European Council could then ask the European Commission Bank <b>to</b> <b>step</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> breach and indemnify the European Commission Bank in advance against potential risks to the Treasury’s solvency. Soros acknowledges that converting the EFSF into a European Treasury will necessitate “a radical change of heart.” In particular, he cautions, Germans will be wary of any such move, not least because many continue to believe that they have a choice between saving the Euro and abandoning it. Soros writes however that a collapse of European Union would precipitate an uncontrollable financial meltdown and thus “the only way” to avert “another Great Depression” is the formation of a European Treasury.|$|E

25|$|The {{additional}} obligations imposed by European law on national border authorities {{when it comes}} to processing travellers who are third-country nationals (e.g. the obligation to stamp their travel documents) should not prevent the development of automated border control systems which are made available to such travellers. As shown by the examples listed above of automated border control systems which have been developed at external border crossing points of the Schengen Area, national border authorities have been able to adapt the design of their automated border control systems to allow third-country nationals to make use of them. One solution is to have a border guard physically positioned next to the automated border gates who can stamp travel documents where required: this approach has been adopted by the Finnish Border Guard at the automated border gates in Helsinki Airport, where eligible users (who are required to receive a passport stamp) include holders of Australian, Canadian, Japanese, New Zealand, South Korean and United States biometric passports, {{as well as by the}} Portuguese Serviço de Estrangeiros e Fronteiras at the automated border gates in Lisbon Airport where eligible users (who are required to receive a passport stamp) include holders of Angolan and Brazilian passports and holders of diplomatic/service passports. A similar but slightly different solution has been adopted by the Dutch Royal Marechaussee at the Privium iris recognition automated border gates at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport (where eligible users include registered EU/EEA/Swiss citizens, US citizens who are Global Entry members, and all nationals who are holders of diplomatic passports), as well as by the German Federal Police at the ABG Plus iris recognition automated border gates at Frankfurt Airport (where eligible users include registered EU/EEA/Swiss citizens and US citizens who are Global Entry members): when eligible third-country nationals use Privium/ABG Plus, after their iris is scanned and verified, a different gate opens to that for EU/EEA/Swiss citizens and the third-country national is directed to a lane which leads them to the front of the queue for manual passport checks at immigration desks, where the border officer stamps the user's passport. Another possible solution would be to design the automated border gates to print a paper slip with an entry or exit stamp on it, as well as the traveller's name and travel document number, whenever the user is a traveller who is subject to the requirement to have his or her travel document stamped. At the Port of Helsinki, the Finnish Border Guard has adapted the design of the automated border gates there to widen eligibility to include Russian citizens (who, as Annex I nationals, are required to have a visa) by requiring them to scan both the biodata page and the visa inside their passport, then <b>to</b> <b>step</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> gate for a facial image and fingerprint recognition, and after the gate opens to approach a border officer to have their passport stamped.|$|E
