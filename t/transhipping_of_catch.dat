40|$|The mean {{trophic level}} (MTL) <b>of</b> <b>catch</b> has been {{proposed}} to track changes in marine ecosystems resulting from fishing. Despite the ongoing debate surrounding its validity, catch MTL is a key indicator for measuring progress toward global biodiversity goals. Evaluations <b>of</b> <b>catch</b> MTL have found no linear correlation between trends in the indicator and the ecosystem state. I use simulation models and a method common in epidemiology to evaluate catch MTL as a strategic indicator for ecosystem changes {{even though it is}} not linearly related. The performance <b>of</b> <b>catch</b> MTL was ‘fair’ when applied globally, but varied considerably across individual simulated ecosystems. Catch MTL performed most reliably when the composition <b>of</b> the <b>catch</b> reflected the ecosystem and fishing pressure was constant over time. The inconsistent performance <b>of</b> <b>catch</b> MTL suggests it is not a reliable indicator of ecological change, but it still provides useful information about fisheries catch over time...|$|R

The literature review describes the different functions <b>of</b> <b>catch</b> crops {{in relation to the}} soil and the environment. In detail are discussed biotic and abiotic factors affecting the cultivation <b>of</b> <b>catch</b> crops and agronomic practices applied in their cultivation. In the thesis are discussed the economic costs associated with the cultivation <b>of</b> <b>catch</b> crops and the possibility of the use of subsidies for its cultivation. Described is also the division <b>of</b> <b>catch</b> crops by date of sowing and the definition of appropriate and inappropriate catch crops, for the individual production area in the Czech republic. The folloving section of the thesis deals with the evaluation of experiments conducted on the experimental field station in Žabčice. Experiments with catch crops were found out in 2006. There were ten catch crops: Sinapis alba L., Raphanus sativus L. var. oleiformis Pers., Phacelia tanacetifolia Benth., Fagopyrum vulgare Hill., Secale cereale L. var. multicaule Metzg. ex Alef., Panicum miliaceum L., Crambe abyssinica L. Hochst., Malva verticillata L., Phalaris canariensis L., Carthamus tictorius L. The thesis follows results from 2011 to 2014. There was <b>catch</b> crops ability <b>of</b> coverage of soil surface using digital image analysis evaluated. Further the dry matter yields <b>of</b> <b>catch</b> crops was evaluated and dry matter yields between autumn and spring sampling were compared. Field experiment was established at experimental field station in Žabčice in the years 2012 / 2013. The experiment was made to assess the yield of grain maize under different variants of soil tillage (direct seeding, loosening, strip tillage) in system, where Phacelia tanacetifolia was used as catch crop in comparison with soil tillage systems without Phacelia tanacetifolia (ploughing, loosening and strip tillage) ...|$|R
