40|$|In a {{previous}} paper, a tableau calculus has been presented, which constitute a decision procedure for hybrid logic with the converse and global modalities and a restricted {{use of the}} binder. This work extends such a calculus to multi-modal logic with <b>transitive</b> <b>relations</b> and relation inclusion assertions. The separate addition of either <b>transitive</b> <b>relations</b> or relation hierarchies to the considered decidable fragment of multi-modal hybrid logic can easily be shown to stay decidable, by resorting to results already proved in the literature. However, such results do not directly allow for concluding whether the logic including both features is still decidable. The existence of a terminating, sound and complete calculus for the considered logic proves that the addition of <b>transitive</b> <b>relations</b> and relation hierarchies to such an expressive decidable fragment of hybrid logic yields a decidable logic.

30|$|Several {{metrical}} {{fixed point}} theorems under arbitrary binary relations are proved by various authors such as Khan et al. [10], Ayari et al.

[30], which are generalizations of the relation-theoretic contraction principle due to Alam and Imdad [26]. Here we can {{point out that}} arbitrary binary relation is general enough and often does not work for certain contractions, so that various fixed/coincidence point theorems are proved in metric spaces equipped with different types of binary relations, for example, preorder (Roldán-López-de-Hierro and Shahzad [11]), <b>transitive</b> <b>relations</b> (Shahzad et al. [31]), finitely <b>transitive</b> <b>relations</b> (Berzig and Karapinar [32], Berzig et al.

40|$|Three {{students}} with moderate disabilities {{were taught to}} read and match-to-sample sight words comprising stimulus sets based upon the four food groups. We taught students conditional discriminations within four four-member sets using a single-sample/four-comparison procedure. Students were taught A-B, B-C, and C-D conditional discriminations {{for each of the}} four potential stimulus classes. Subsequent probes tested for relations based upon symmetry and one-node and two-node transitivity. The performances for all students indicated that symmetric relations emerged before one-node <b>transitive</b> <b>relations,</b> and that one-node <b>transitive</b> <b>relations</b> emerged before two-node <b>transitive</b> <b>relations.</b> These results are consistent with a pattern of responding, referred to as a “nodality effect,” in which relations with fewer nodes are demonstrated prior to the demonstration of relations with a greater number of nodes.

40|$|Rewriting is {{traditionally}} {{presented as a}} method to compute normal forms in varieties. Conceptually, however, its essence are commutation properties. We develop rewriting as a general theory of commutation for two possibly non-symmetric <b>transitive</b> <b>relations</b> modulo a congruence and prove a generalization of the standard Church-Rosser theorem. The theorems of equational rewriting, including the existence of normal forms, derive as corollaries to this result. Completion also is purely commutational and we show how to extend it to plain <b>transitive</b> <b>relations.</b> Nevertheless the loss of symmetry introduces some unpleasant consequences: unique normal forms do not exist, rewrite proofs cannot be found by don't-care nondeterministic rewriting and also simplification during completion requires backtracking. On the non-ground level, variable critical pairs have to be considered.

40|$|AbstractClasses are {{the basic}} units in {{object-oriented}} programs. Therefore, {{the quality of a}} class has a great impact on the overall quality of the software. Class cohesion is one of the important quality factors and it refers to the degree of relatedness of the class attributes and methods. Several class cohesion metrics are proposed in the literature, and a few of them empirically address the effect of considering <b>transitive</b> <b>relations</b> between class attributes and methods caused by method invocations. In this paper, we address this issue {{for one of the most}} popular class cohesion metrics, referenced as Lack of Cohesion (LCOM). Our empirical study involves applying the metric with and without considering <b>transitive</b> <b>relations</b> on classes of two open source Java applications and statistically analyzing the results.

40|$|Class {{cohesion}} metrics apply {{different approaches}} to quantify the relatedness of the attributes and methods in a class. These relations can be direct or transitive. Method invocations are among the key sources of potential <b>transitive</b> attribute-method <b>relations.</b> That is, a method is not only related to the attributes that it references, {{but it may also}} be transitively related to the attributes referenced by the methods that it invokes. A few of the existing class cohesion metrics capture this potential transitive cohesion aspect. In this paper, we classify the method invocations as direct or transitive. The definitions of the class representative models used by sixteen existing low-level design (LLD) metrics are extended to incorporate the cohesion caused by the two types of method invocations. The impact of incorporating the <b>transitive</b> <b>relations</b> due to the two types of method invocations on the cohesion values and on the ability of the LLD metrics to predict faulty classes are studied empirically. The results show that the <b>transitive</b> <b>relations</b> due to both types of method invocations featured a considerable degree of cohesion that is not captured by most of the existing LLD metrics. However, practically, incorporating <b>transitive</b> <b>relations</b> in cohesion measurement was found to be ineffective in improving the fault-prediction powers of most of the LLD metrics...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} count partial orders {{on a set}} of n points, it seems {{necessary}} to explicitly construct a representative of every isomorphism type. While that is done, one might as well determine their automorphism groups. In this note it is shown how several other types of binary relations can be counted, based on an explicit enumeration of the partial orders and their automorphism groups. A partial order is a transitive, reflexive, and antisymmetric binary relation. Here we determine the number of quasi-orders q(n) (or finite topologies or transitive digraphs or reflexive <b>transitive</b> <b>relations),</b> the number of “soft ” orders s(t) (or antisymmetric <b>transitive</b> <b>relations),</b> and the number of <b>transitive</b> <b>relations</b> t(n) on n points in terms of numbers of partial orders with a given automorphism group. 1 Introduction. A partial order on a set X with n elements is a binary relation on X which is transitive, reflexive and antisymmetric.
