5|$|Federal judges, when {{interpreting}} the Constitution, frequently use <b>The</b> <b>Federalist</b> Papers as a contemporary {{account of the}} intentions of the framers and ratifiers. They have been applied on issues ranging from the power of the federal government in foreign affairs (in Hines v. Davidowitz) to the validity of ex post facto laws (in the 1798 decision Calder v. Bull, apparently the first decision to mention <b>The</b> <b>Federalist).</b> , <b>The</b> <b>Federalist</b> had been quoted 291 times in Supreme Court decisions.|$|E

50|$|John Milledge (DR) had {{declined}} to run for re-election. As a result, many Democratic-Republican voters cast their votes for Baldwin and one of <b>the</b> <b>Federalists,</b> giving <b>the</b> <b>Federalists</b> enough votes to win both seats.|$|R
5000|$|As late as 1812, <b>the</b> <b>Federalists</b> {{came within}} one state of winning. A larger shift in electoral {{politics}} arguably {{came in the}} 1812-1816 period, as <b>the</b> <b>Federalists</b> became discredited after opposing the War of 1812.|$|R
50|$|These {{elections}} {{resulted in}} the Democratic-Republicans picking up 22 seats from <b>the</b> <b>Federalists.</b> This brought <b>the</b> Democratic-Republicans a solid majority of 68 seats, whereas <b>the</b> <b>Federalists</b> were only able to secure 38. Many state legislatures also changed to Democratic-Republican control, {{with the result that}} many new Democratic-Republicans were voted into <b>the</b> Senate. <b>The</b> <b>Federalists</b> never again succeeded in gaining a majority of seats in the House of Representatives, and it was soon normal for them to control fewer {{than a third of the}} seats until <b>the</b> national <b>Federalist</b> party disintegrated completely in the early 1820s.|$|R

50|$|As in the {{previous}} election, there was a breakaway faction of the Democratic-Republican Party allied with <b>the</b> <b>Federalists</b> known as <b>the</b> tertium quids or Constitutional Republicans, which ran candidates in several districts.

50|$|Religious {{tensions}} polarized Connecticut, as {{the established}} Congregational Church, in alliance with <b>the</b> <b>Federalists,</b> tried {{to maintain its}} grip on power.

25|$|Polk, {{and most}} of <b>the</b> <b>Federalists</b> in Delaware, joined the Adams/Clay faction, and began a National Republican, then Whig {{ascendancy}} in Delaware politics.

50|$|First Party System: This {{system can}} be {{considered}} to have developed {{as a result of}} the factions in the George Washington administration. The two factions were Alexander Hamilton and <b>the</b> <b>Federalists</b> and Thomas Jefferson and the Democratic-Republican Party. <b>The</b> <b>Federalists</b> argued for a strong national government with a national bank and a strong economic and industry system. The Democratic-Republicans argued for a limited government, with a greater emphasis on farmers and states' rights. After the 1800 Presidential election, the Democratic-Republicans gained major dominance for the next twenty years, and <b>the</b> <b>Federalists</b> slowly died off.|$|R
50|$|In effect, the Cortes session {{opened on}} 2 January 1874, but <b>the</b> <b>federalists</b> rose up against Don Emilio Castelar, who was {{supported}} by the captain general of Madrid, Don Manuel Pavía, former supporter of Prim, with whom he had rebelled in Villarejo de Salvanés. Two very different forces threatened to interrupt the deliberations of <b>the</b> Cortes: <b>the</b> <b>federalists,</b> eager to finish Castelar with mighty wrath, and the troops of General Pavía, supporter of Castelar, who had decided to show up in his support to avoid his defeat before <b>the</b> <b>federalists.</b>|$|R
50|$|Undaunted, <b>the</b> <b>Federalists</b> {{created a}} navy, with new frigates, {{and a large}} new army, with Washington in nominal command and Hamilton in actual command. To pay for it all they raised taxes on land, houses and slaves, leading to serious unrest. In one part of Pennsylvania the Fries' Rebellion broke out, with people refusing to pay the new taxes. John Fries {{was sentenced to death}} for treason, but {{received}} a pardon from Adams. In the elections of 1798 <b>the</b> <b>Federalists</b> did very well, but this issue started hurting <b>the</b> <b>Federalists</b> in 1799.|$|R

50|$|In 2008, {{with the}} release of their second full length Self-Titled record, <b>The</b> <b>Federalists</b> {{received}} numerous music reviews by local and nationally respected indie press including; Diablo Magazine, The Big Takeover, Recording Magazine, East Bay Express, and Performer Magazine. The single from their 2008 record, 'City Girl', received support from Bay Area radio stations such as; LIVE 105, KFOG, and 107.7 The Bone. LIVE 105 music director Aaron Axelsen was so impressed by <b>The</b> <b>Federalists</b> second record he asked them to play at BFD, LIVE 105's annual music festival at the Shoreline Amphitheater in June 2008.

5|$|Hamilton {{became the}} leading cabinet {{member in the}} new {{government}} under President Washington. He was a nationalist who emphasized strong central government and successfully argued that the implied powers of the Constitution provided the legal authority to fund the national debt, assume states' debts, and create the government-backed Bank of the United States. These programs were funded primarily by a tariff on imports, and later also by a highly controversial tax on whiskey. To overcome localism, Hamilton mobilized a nationwide network of friends of the government, especially bankers and businessmen, which became <b>the</b> <b>Federalist</b> Party. A major issue {{in the emergence of}} the American two-party system was the Jay Treaty, largely designed by Hamilton in 1794. It established friendly trade relations with Britain, to the chagrin of France and the supporters of the French Revolution. Hamilton {{played a central role in}} <b>the</b> <b>Federalist</b> party, which dominated national and state politics until it lost the election of 1800 to Jefferson's Democratic-Republican Party.|$|E
5|$|There was {{danger of}} {{invasion}} {{from the more}} powerful French forces, so Adams and <b>the</b> <b>Federalist</b> congress built up the army, bringing back Washington as its commander. Washington wanted Hamilton to be his second-in-command and Adams reluctantly accommodated. It became apparent that Hamilton was truly in charge due to Washington's advanced years.|$|E
2500|$|This in turn led to {{a debate}} between those who support Consumers' Co-operatives (known as <b>the</b> Co-operative <b>Federalists)</b> and those who favor Producers Co-operatives (pejoratively {{labelled}} ‘Individualist' co-operativists by <b>the</b> <b>Federalists</b> [...] ).|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Federalists</b> ran a mixed ticket {{consisting}} of 2 Federalists (Aaron Ogden and John Beatty) and 4 Democratic-Republicans (William Helms, Ebenezer Elmer, George Maxwell, and Adam Boyd), {{one of whom}} (William Helms) was also on the Democratic-Republican ticket. <b>The</b> <b>Federalists</b> capitalized on resentment over the replacement on the official Democratic-Republican ticket of Ebenezer Elmer, from South Jersey, with Thomas Newbold from Monmouth County and the retention of James Sloan. This ticket was formed too late to gain sufficient support, but <b>the</b> <b>Federalists</b> did do much better in state elections that year than they had in previous elections.|$|R

5|$|At {{his death}} in 1799 he left a {{critical}} legacy; he exemplified the core ideals of the American Revolution and the new nation: republican virtue and devotion to civic duty. Washington was the unchallenged public icon of American military and civic patriotism. He was also identified with <b>the</b> <b>Federalist</b> Party, which {{lost control of the}} national government in 1800 to the Jeffersonian Republicans, who were reluctant to celebrate the hero of the opposition party.|$|E
5|$|By February 1794 {{the still}} decommissioned, Marseillois had been renamed Vengeur du Peuple, {{probably}} {{a response to}} the participation of the city of Marseille in <b>the</b> <b>Federalist</b> revolts of 1793. She was recommissioned in Rochefort, and on 24 March 1794, Captain Jean François Renaudin took command. On 1 April 1794, she sailed to Île-d'Aix, where she joined up with Pelletier, and on 11 April, the squadron sailed on again, reaching Brest on 18 April, having been joined en route by Jemmapes. Upon their arrival the ships were assigned to the squadron under Admiral Villaret de Joyeuse.|$|E
50|$|In 1830, the Unitarian League {{was created}} by General José María Paz in order to defeat <b>the</b> <b>Federalists.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Federalists</b> faced Paz and his troops on May 31, 1831 and the Unitarianists were {{defeated}} after the Gauchos captured the Unitarianist commander.

50|$|The {{previous}} {{four years}} of American politics were dominated by {{the effects of the}} War of 1812. While the war had not ended in victory, the peace concluded in 1815 was satisfactory to the American people, and the Democratic-Republicans received the credit for its conclusion. <b>The</b> <b>Federalists</b> found themselves discredited by their opposition to the war and the secessionist rhetoric from New England embodied by the Hartford Convention of 1814-15. Furthermore, President Madison had succeeded in realizing certain measures favored by <b>the</b> <b>Federalists,</b> for example a national bank and protective tariffs. This gave <b>the</b> <b>Federalists</b> few issues to campaign on, and this resulted in an overwhelming victory for the Democratic-Republicans.|$|R
5000|$|At {{this time}} the {{politicians}} {{were divided into two}} opposing political parties: <b>the</b> <b>Federalists</b> and <b>the</b> Democratic-Republicans. The Democratic-Republican Party split into two opposing factions at the gubernatorial election of 1804: the [...] "Regulars" [...] who supported Morgan Lewis, and the [...] "Burrites" [...] who supported Vice President Aaron Burr. Lewis had been nominated for Governor by his party, but Burr, after being dropped from the presidential ticket in favor of Gov. George Clinton, ran against Lewis. Burr also received the support of the majority of <b>the</b> <b>Federalists</b> although his enemy Alexander Hamilton, the leader of <b>the</b> <b>Federalists,</b> advocated against it and supported Lewis.|$|R
