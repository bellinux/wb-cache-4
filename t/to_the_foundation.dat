5|$|In {{the dozen}} years {{following}} the disaster, more than 30 monuments and memorials were set up in Britain alone. These ranged from simple relics (e.g., Scott's sledging flag in Exeter Cathedral) <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>foundation</b> of the Scott Polar Research Institute at Cambridge. Many more were established {{in other parts of}} the world, including a statue sculpted by Scott's widow for his New Zealand base in Christchurch.|$|E
5|$|Maximus {{is among}} those Christians who were venerated as saints shortly after their deaths.

5|$|According to this {{traditional}} account, Rome had been {{ruled by a}} succession of kings. The Romans believed that this era, that of the Roman kingdom, began in 753 BC and ended in 510 BC. After {{the overthrow of the}} monarchy and the establishment of the Republic, the people of Rome began electing two consuls each year. According to the consular fasti, a list of the consuls going back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>foundation</b> of the Republic, the first consuls were chosen in 509 BC.|$|E
5|$|Demobilisation also {{included}} establishing {{arrangements for the}} medical care of ex-service personnel. After the war responsibility for medical treatment was gradually transferred from the services to the Repatriation Commission. The Army's hospitals were also transferred to the Commission, meeting its immediate need for facilities. It proved necessary to build new hospitals {{for the treatment of}} tuberculosis and mental disorders, however as the specialised Army hospitals established for the treatment of these conditions were respectively unsatisfactory and had to be returned to the Government of New South Wales. The Department of Social Services was responsible for providing assistance to veterans with a disability not caused by their military service, and this led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>foundation</b> of the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service in 1955.|$|E
5|$|Donnchadh's most {{important}} long-term patronage {{was a series}} of gifts to the Cluniac Abbey of Paisley that led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>foundation</b> of a monastery at Crossraguel (Crois Riaghail). At some date before 1227 he granted Crossraguel and a place called Suthblan to Paisley, a grant confirmed by Pope Honorius III on 23 January 1227. A royal confirmation by King Alexander III of Scotland dated to 25 August 1236 shows that Donnchadh granted the monastery the churches of Kirkoswald (Turnberry), Straiton and Dalquharran (Old Dailly). He may also have given the churches of Girvan and Kirkcudbright-Innertig (Ballantrae).|$|E

5|$|In June 2003 Wikipedia was {{transferred}} to a nascent non-profit organization, the Wikimedia Foundation, which was formed as a charitable institution to supervise Wikipedia and its associated wiki-based sites. When the foundation was established, its staff began to solicit public funding and Bomis turned Wikipedia over to the non-profit. All Bomis-owned hardware used to run Wikipedia-associated websites was donated to the Wikimedia Foundation, and Wales transferred Wikipedia-related copyrights from Bomis <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>foundation.</b> It was first headquartered in St. Petersburg, Florida, where Bomis was located. The foundation shifted Wikipedia's dependence away from Bomis, allowing it to purchase hardware for expansion.|$|E
5000|$|The {{third phase}} is similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> first phase, moving cards from <b>the</b> reserve <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>foundations.</b> <b>The</b> top cards of each reserve pile are {{available}} for play.

5|$|Roger did {{not like}} monks, and William of Newburgh said that he often {{referred}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>foundation</b> of Fountains Abbey as the worst mistake of Archbishop Thurstan's episcopate.

However, he also started the rebuilding of York Minster, which had been damaged by fire in 1137, and helped with {{the building of a}} church at Ripon.

5|$|Stela 8 is a well-preserved {{monument}} on {{the south}} side of Structure A-3. Here king Wat'ul Chatel wears jaguar claws on his hands and feet, together with other attributes of the Bearded Jaguar God. In one hand the king holds the head of the god K'awiil. The text describes a visitor named Hakawitzil, an early form of Jacawitz, the name of one of the patron gods of the Postclassic K'iche' Kingdom of Q'umarkaj in the Guatemalan Highlands. Schele and Mathews propose that the event depicted on this stela gave rise <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>foundation</b> legends of the K'iche' people.|$|E
5|$|Surviving Pictish {{sources for}} the period are few, limited to king lists, the {{original}} of which was prepared in the early 720s, {{and a number of}} accounts relating <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>foundation</b> of St Andrews, then called Cennrígmonaid. Beyond Pictland, the principal sources are the Irish annals, of which the Annals of Ulster and the Annals of Tigernach are the most reliable. These include materials from an annal kept at the monastery of Iona in Scotland. Óengus and the Picts appear occasionally in Welsh sources, such as the Annales Cambriae, and more frequently in Northumbrian sources, of which the Continuation of Bede's chronicle and the Historia Regum Anglorum attributed to Symeon of Durham are the most important.|$|E

5|$|The Nez Perce {{lost most}} of their horses after the Nez Perce War in 1877, and the breed fell into decline for several decades.

The modern breed maintains bloodlines tracing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>foundation</b> bloodstock of the registry; its partially open stud book allows the addition of some Thoroughbred, American Quarter Horse and Arabian blood.|$|E
5|$|The Scottish Reform Act 1832 {{increased}} the number of Scottish MPs and widened the franchise to include more of the middle classes. From the mid-century there were increasing calls for Home Rule for Scotland and the post of Secretary of State for Scotland was revived. Towards {{the end of the century}} Prime Ministers of Scottish descent included William Gladstone, and the Earl of Rosebery. In the later 19th century the growing importance of the working classes was marked by Keir Hardie's success in the Mid Lanarkshire by-election, 1888, leading <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>foundation</b> of the Scottish Labour Party, which was absorbed into the Independent Labour Party in 1895, with Hardie as its first leader.|$|E
5|$|The Third World Congress in 1951 {{resolved}} {{that the}} economies of the East European states and their political regimes had come to resemble that of the USSR more and more.
